<text>Timothy Michael Healy, KC (17 May 1855 – 26 March 1931) was an Irish nationalist politician, journalist, author, barrister and a controversial Irish Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. His political career began in the 1880s under Charles Stewart Parnell&#x27;s leadership of the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) and continued into the 1920s, when (on 5 December 1922) he was appointed as the first governor-general of the Irish Free State.

==Family background==

He was born in Bantry, County Cork, the second son of Maurice Healy, clerk of the Bantry Poor Law Union, and Eliza (née Sullivan) Healy. His elder brother, Thomas Healy (1854–1924), was a solicitor and Member of Parliament (MP) for North Wexford and his younger brother, Maurice Healy (1859–1923), with whom he held a lifelong close relationship, was a solicitor and MP for Cork City.

His father was descended from a family line which in holding to their Catholic faith, lost their lands, which he compensated by being a scholarly gentleman. 

Timothy Michael Healy was educated at the Christian Brothers school in Fermoy, and was otherwise largely self-educated, in 1869 at the age of fourteen going to live with his uncle, Timothy Daniel Sullivan MP, in Dublin.

==Early life==

He then moved to England finding employment in 1871 with the North Eastern Railway Company in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. There he became deeply involved in the Irish Home Rule politics of the local Irish community. After leaving for London in 1878 Healy worked as a confidential clerk in a factory owned by his relative, then worked as a parliamentary correspondent for &quot;The Nation&quot; newspaper owned by his uncle, writing numerous articles in support of Parnell, the newly emergent and more militant home rule leader, and his policy of parliamentary obstructionism.

Parnell admired Healy&#x27;s intelligence and energy after Healy had established himself as part of Parnell&#x27;s broader political circle. He became Parnell&#x27;s secretary but was denied contact to Parnell&#x27;s small inner circle of political colleagues.

Parnell, however, brought Healy into the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) and supported him as a nationalist candidate for a by-election to Wexford in 1880 following the death of William Archer Redmond, against John Redmond, the son of the deceased MP. After John Redmond stood aside, Healy was returned unopposed to parliament.

==Political career==
In parliament, Healy did not physically cut an imposing figure but impressed by the application of sheer intelligence, diligence and volatile use of speech when he achieved the &quot;Healy Clause&quot; in the Land Law (Ireland) Act 1881 which provided that no further rent should in future be charged on tenant&#x27;s improvements. By the mid-1880s Healy had already acquired a reputation for a scurrilousness of tone. He married his cousin Eliza Sullivan in 1882, they had three daughters and three sons and he enjoyed a happy and intense family life, closely interlinked both by friendship and intermarriage with the Sullivans of west Cork.

Through his reputation as a friend of the farmers, after having been imprisoned for four months following an agrarian case, and backed by Parnell, he was elected in a Monaghan by-election in June 1883, deemed to be the climax in the Healy–Parnell relationship. In 1884 he was called to the Irish bar as a barrister (in 1889 to the inner bar as King&#x27;s Counsel, in London in 1910). His reputation allowed him to build an extensive legal practice, particularly in land cases. He was elected for South Londonderry in 1885, but lost to a Liberal Unionist in 1886. In the 1887 North Longford by-election, he was returned unopposed.

Prompted by the depression in the prices of dairy products and cattle in the mid-1880 as well as bad weather for a number of years, many tenant farmers unable to pay their rents were left under the threat of eviction. Healy devised a strategy to secure a reduction in rent from the landlords which became known as the Plan of Campaign, organised in 1886 amongst others by Timothy Harrington.

==Invective rift==

Initially a passionate supporter of Parnell, he became disenchanted with his leader after Healy opposed Parnell&#x27;s nomination of Captain William O&#x27;Shea to stand for a by-election in Galway city. At the time O&#x27;Shea was separated from his wife, Katharine O&#x27;Shea, with whom Parnell was secretly living. Healy objected to this, as the party had not been consulted and he believed Parnell was putting his personal relationship before the national interest. When Parnell travelled to Galway to support O’Shea, Healy was forced to back down.

In 1890, O&#x27;Shea sued his wife for divorce, citing Parnell as co-respondent. Healy and most of Parnell&#x27;s associates rejected Parnell&#x27;s continuing leadership of the party, believing it was recklessly endangering the party&#x27;s alliance with Gladstonian Liberalism. Healy became Parnell&#x27;s most outspoken critic. When Parnell asked his colleagues at one party meeting &quot;Who is the master of the party?&quot;, Healy famously retorted with another question &quot;Aye, but who is the mistress of the party?&quot; – a comment that almost led to the men coming to blows. His savage onslaught in public reflected his conservative Catholic origin. A substantial minority of the Irish people never forgave him for his role during the divorce crisis, permanently damaging his own standing in public life. The rift prompted nine-year-old Dublin schoolboy James Joyce to write a poem called &quot;Et Tu, Healy?&quot;, which Joyce&#x27;s father had printed and circulated. Only three lines remain:

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;His quaint-perched aerie on the crags of Time&quot;
&quot;Where the rude din of this century&quot;
&quot;Can trouble him no more.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Estrangement==

Following Parnell&#x27;s death in 1891, the IPP&#x27;s anti-Parnellite majority group broke away forming the Irish National Federation (INF) under John Dillon. Healy was at first its most outspoken member, when in 1892 he won North Louth as an anti-Parnellites, who in all won seventy-one seats. But finding it impossible to work with or under any post-Parnell leadership, especially Dillon&#x27;s, he was expelled in 1895 from the INF executive committee, having previously been expelled from the Irish party&#x27;s minor nine-member pro-Parnellite Irish National League (INL) under John Redmond.

In the following decades, largely due to his expanding legal practice, he became a part-time politician and estranged from the national movement, setting up his own personal &#x27;Healyite&#x27; organisation, called the &quot;People&#x27;s Rights Association&quot;, based on his position as MP for North Louth (a seat he held until the December 1910 election when defeated by Richard Hazleton). He waged war during the 1890s with Dillon and his National Federation (INF) and then intrigued with Redmond&#x27;s smaller Parnellite group to play a substantial role behind the scenes in helping the rival party factions to reunite under Redmond in 1900.

Healy was extremely embittered by the fact that both his brothers and his followers were purged from the IPP list in the 1900 general election, and that his support for Redmond in the re-united party went unrewarded; on the contrary, Redmond soon found it wiser to conciliate Dillon. But two years later Healy was again expelled. He remained &quot;the enemy within&quot;, recruiting malcontent MPs to harass the party and survived politically by dint of his assiduous constituency work, as well as through the influence of his clerical ally Dr. Michael Cardinal Logue, Primate of All Ireland and Archbishop of Armagh. Healy remained rooted in the extended &#x27;Bantry Gang&#x27;, a highly influential political and commercial nexus based originally in West Cork, which included his key patron, the Catholic business magnate and owner of the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, William Martin Murphy, who provided a platform for Healy and other critics of the IPP.

==Coalition of a kind==

However, at least after 1903, Healy was joined in his estrangement from the party leadership by William O&#x27;Brien. O’Brien had been for years one of Healy&#x27;s strongest critics, but now he too felt annoyed both by his own alienation from the party and by Redmond&#x27;s subservience to Dillon. Involved with the Irish Reform Association 1904–5, they entered a loose coalition, which lasted throughout the life of the IPP. They were in agreement that agrarian radicalism brought little return, and with Healy practically becoming a Parnellite, they preferred to pursue a policy of conciliation with the Protestant class in order to further the acceptance of Home Rule. Redmond was sympathetic to this policy but was inhibited by Dillon. Redmond, in an act of , briefly re-united them with the party in 1908. Fiercely independent, both split off again in 1909, responding to real changes in the social basis of Irish politics. In 1908 Healy acted as counsel for Sir Arthur Vicars, former Ulster King of Arms, in connection with the 1908 investigation of the previous year&#x27;s theft of the Irish Crown Jewels.

By the 1910s, it looked as though Healy was to remain a maverick on the fringes of Irish nationalism. However, he came into notoriety once more when returned in the January 1910 general election in alliance with William O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s newly founded All-for-Ireland Party (AFIL), their alliance based largely on common opposition to the Irish party. He lost his seat in the following December 1910 election, but soon afterwards rejoined the O&#x27;Brienites, O’Brien providing the 1911 north-east Cork by-election vacancy created by the retirement of Moreton Frewen. Healy&#x27;s reputation was not enhanced when he represented as counsel his associate William Martin Murphy, the industrialist who sparked the 1913 Dublin Lockout. Healy assiduously cultivated relationships with power brokers in Westminster such as Lord Beaverbrook, and once they were introduced at Cherkley, was great friends with Janet Aitken for the remainder of his life.

==Realignment==

Redmond&#x27;s and the IPP&#x27;s powerful position of holding the balance of power at Westminster—and with the passing of the Third Home Rule Bill assured—left Healy and the AFIL critics in a weakened position. They condemned the bill as a &#x27;partition deal&#x27;, abstaining from its final vote in the Commons. With the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Healy brothers supported the Allied and the British war effort. Two had a son enlist in one of the Irish divisions, Timothy&#x27;s eldest son, Joe, fought with distinction at Gallipoli.

Having done much to damage the popular image and authority of constitutional nationalism, Healy after the Easter Rising was convinced that the IPP and Redmond were doomed and slowly withdrew from the forefront of politics, making it clear in 1917 that he was in general sympathy with Arthur Griffith&#x27;s Sinn Féin movement, but not with physical force methods. In September that year he acted as counsel for the family of the dead Sinn Féin hunger striker Thomas Ashe. He was one of the few King&#x27;s Counsel to provide legal services to members of Sinn Féin in various legal proceedings in both Ireland and England post the 1916 Rising. This included acting for those interned in 1916 in Frongoch internment camp in North Wales. In 1916, he also represented the family of Francis Sheehy Skeffington as an observer at the court martial of Captain Bowen-Colthurst, and he participated in the subsequent Royal Commission of Inquiry into the murders at Portobello Barracks.

During this time, Healy also represented Georgina Frost, in her attempts to be appointed a Petty Sessions clerk in her native County Clare. In 1920 the Bar Council of Ireland passed an initial resolution that any barrister appearing before the Dáil Courts would be guilty of professional misconduct. This was challenged by Tim Healy and no final decision was made on the matter. Before the December 1918 general election, he was the first of the AFIL members to resign his seat in favour of the Sinn Féin party&#x27;s candidate, and spoke in support of P. J. Little, the Sinn Féin candidate for Rathmines in Dublin.

==Governor-General==

He returned to considerable prominence in 1922 when, on the urging of the soon-to-be Irish Free State&#x27;s Provisional Government of W. T. Cosgrave, the British government recommended to King George V that Healy be appointed the first &#x27;Governor-General of the Irish Free State&#x27;, a new office representative of the Crown created in the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty and introduced by a combination of the Constitution of the Irish Free State and Letters Patent from the King. The constitution was enacted in December 1922. Healy was the uncle of Kevin O&#x27;Higgins, the Vice-President of the Executive Council and Minister for Justice in the new Free State.

Initially, the Government of the Irish Free State under Cosgrave wished for Healy to reside in a new small residence, but, facing death threats from the IRA, he was moved as a temporary measure into the Viceregal Lodge, the former &#x27;out of season&#x27; residence of the Lord Lieutenant, the former representative of the Crown until 1922.

Healy officially entered office as Governor-General on 6 December 1922. He never wore, certainly not in public in Ireland, the official ceremonial uniform of a Governor-General in the British Empire. At that time, in the 1920s, Healy was unique amongst viceregal representatives in the British Empire in this regard. Healy was also unique (along with his successor, James McNeill) amongst all the Governors-General in the British Empire in the 1920s in that he was never sworn in as a member of the Imperial Privy Council. Nor was he ever sworn into the Privy Council of Ireland, a body that ceased to exist in early December 1922. Thus, unusually for a Governor-General within the Empire, he never gained the prefix &#x27;The Right Honourable&#x27; nor the post-nominals &#x27;PC&#x27;.

Healy proved an able Governor-General, possessing a degree of political skill, deep political insight and contacts in Britain that the new Irish Government initially lacked, and had long recommended himself to the Catholic Hierarchy: all-round good credentials for this key symbolic and reconciling position at the centre of public life. He joked once that the government didn&#x27;t advise him, he advised the government: a comment at a dinner for The Duke of York (the future King George VI) that led to public criticism. However, the waspish Healy still could not help courting further controversy, most notably in a public attack on the new Fianna Fáil and its leader, Éamon de Valera, which led to republican calls for his resignation.

Much of the contact between governments in London and Dublin went through Healy. He had access to all sensitive state papers, and received instructions from the British Government on the use of his powers to grant, withhold or refuse the Royal Assent to legislation enacted by the Oireachtas. For instance, Healy was instructed to reject any bill that abolished the Oath of Allegiance. However, neither this nor any other bill that he was secretly instructed to block were introduced during his time as Governor-General. That role of being the UK government&#x27;s representative, and acting on its advice, was abandoned throughout the British Commonwealth in the mid-1920s as a result of an Imperial Conference decision, leaving him and his successors exclusively as the King&#x27;s representative and nominal head of the Irish executive. 

Concerning the Irish Boundary Commission (1924-25) which determined the border between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland, Healy made clear his opinion on how the border should be determined: 

Healy seemed to believe that he had been awarded the Governor-Generalship for life. However, the Executive Council of the Irish Free State decided in 1927 that the term of office of Governors-General would be five years. As a result, he retired from the office and public life in January 1928. His wife had died the previous year. He published his extensive two-volume memoirs in 1928. Throughout his life he was formidable because he was ferociously quick-witted, because he was unworried by social or political convention, and because he knew no party discipline. Towards the end of his life he mellowed and became otherwise more diplomatic.

He died on 26 March 1931, aged 75, in Chapelizod, County Dublin, where he lived at his home in Glenaulin, and was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery.

In his novel &quot;The Man Who Was Thursday&quot;, G. K. Chesterton describes one of his characters as a &quot;... little man, with a black beard and glasses – a man somewhat of the type of Mr Tim Healy ...&quot;.

<text>The American Psychiatric Association (APA) is the main professional organization of psychiatrists and trainee psychiatrists in the United States, and the largest psychiatric organization in the world. It has more than 38,000 members who are involved in psychiatric practice, research, and academia representing a diverse population of patients in more than 100 countries. The association publishes various journals and pamphlets, as well as the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM). The DSM codifies psychiatric conditions and is used mostly in the United States as a guide for diagnosing mental disorders.

The organization has its headquarters in Washington, D.C.

==History==

At a meeting in 1844 in Philadelphia, thirteen superintendents and organizers of insane asylums and hospitals formed the Association of Medical Superintendents of American Institutions for the Insane (AMSAII). The group included Thomas Kirkbride, creator of the asylum model which was used throughout the United States. The group was chartered to focus &quot;primarily on the administration of hospitals and how that affected the care of patients&quot;, as opposed to conducting research or promoting the profession.

In 1893, the organization changed its name to the American Medico-Psychological Association. In 1921, the association changed that name to the present American Psychiatric Association. The association was incorporated in 1927.

The cover of the publication &quot;Semi-Centennial Proceedings of the American Medical Psychological Association&quot;, which the association distributed in 1894 at its 50th annual meeting in Philadelphia, contained the first depiction of the association&#x27;s official seal. The seal has undergone several changes since that time.

The present seal is a round medallion with a purported likeness of Benjamin Rush&#x27;s profile and 13 stars over his head to represent the 13 founders of the organization. The outer ring contains the words &quot;American Psychiatric Association 1844.&quot; Rush&#x27;s name and an MD are below the picture.

An association history of the seal states:The choice of Rush (1746–1813) for the seal reflects his place in history. ... Rush&#x27;s practice of psychiatry was based on bleeding, purging, and the use of the tranquilizer chair and gyrator. By 1844 these practices were considered erroneous and abandoned. Rush, however, was the first American to study mental disorder in a systematic manner, and he is considered the father of American Psychiatry.

In 2015, the association adopted a new logo that depicts the serpent-entwined Rod of Asclepius superimposed over the image of two hemispheres of a human brain. The logo appears next to the words &quot;American Psychiatric Association&quot;, with the word &quot;Psychiatric&quot; in bold type; the tagline &quot;Medical leadership for mind, brain and body&quot; appears below the logo. The association will continue to use the seal bearing Rush&#x27;s profile for ceremonial purposes and for some internal documents.

==Organization and membership==
APA is led by the President of the American Psychiatric Association and a board of trustees with an executive committee.

APA reports that its membership is primarily medical specialists who are qualified, or in the process of becoming qualified, as psychiatrists. The basic eligibility requirement is completion of a residency program in psychiatry accredited by the Residency Review Committee for Psychiatry of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPS[C]), or the American Osteopathic Association (AOA). Applicants for membership must also hold a valid medical license (with the exception of medical students and residents) and provide one reference who is an APA member.

APA holds an annual conference attended by an American and international audience.

APA is made up of some 76 district associations throughout the country.

=== Foundation ===
APA operates a non-profit subsidiary called the American Psychiatric Association Foundation (APAF), offering community-based programs and research initiatives intended to better understand and support issues of mental health. Its strategic partners include the Council of State Governments (CSG) Justice Center, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the National Association of Counties (NACo).

==== Corporate Alliance ====
APAF partners with industry organizations to collaborate on mental health research and development through its Corporate Alliance. Current and recent members of the alliance include:

Donors to the foundation in 2019 include the Austen Riggs Center, BB&amp;T, Cenveo, McLean Hospital, Menninger Foundation, NeuroStar, Newport Academy, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Sheppard Pratt, and Silver Hill Hospital.

==Publications and campaigns==
APA position statements, clinical practice guidelines, and descriptions of its core diagnostic manual (the DSM) are published.

APA publishes several journals focused on different areas of psychiatry, for example, academic, clinical practice, or news.

===Top five Choosing Wisely recommendations===

In coordination with the American Board of Internal Medicine, the APA proposes five recommendations for physicians and patients. The list was compiled by members of the Council on Research and Quality Care. The APA places a primary focus on antipsychotic medications due to a rapid increase in sales, from $9.6 billion in 2004 to $18.5 billion in 2011.
# Do not prescribe antipsychotic medications to patients for any indication without appropriate initial evaluation and appropriate ongoing monitoring.
# Do not routinely prescribe 2 or more antipsychotic medications concurrently.
# Do not prescribe antipsychotic medications as a first-line intervention to treat behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.
# Do not routinely prescribe antipsychotic medications as a first-line intervention for insomnia in adults.
# Do not routinely prescribe antipsychotic medications as a first-line intervention for children or adolescents for any diagnosis other than psychotic disorders.

==Notable figures==
* Donald Cameron, was president of the American Psychiatric Association in 1952–53. He conducted coercive experiments widely denounced as unethical, including involuntary electroshock therapy, drug administration, and prolonged confinement and sensory deprivation funded as part of the Central Intelligence Agency Project MKUltra.
* Enoch Callaway, psychiatrist, pioneer in biological psychiatry.
* Mark S. Komrad, served on the APA Ethics Committee and member of the APA Assembly for eight years. 
* Adolf Meyer, former psychiatrist-in-chief at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, was the president of the American Psychiatric Association from 1927 to 1928 and was one of the most influential figures in psychiatry in the first half of the twentieth century.
* Mark Ragins: American psychiatrist in the recovery movement, founding member of the Village ISA. He won the 1995 van Ameringen Award for his outstanding contribution to the field of psychiatric rehabilitation and was named a Distinguished Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association in 2006.
* Herb Pardes past president and noted figure in American psychiatry.
* Eitan Schwarz, Distinguished Life Fellow
* Robert Spitzer was the chair of the task force of the third edition of the DSM.

==Drug company ties==
In his book &quot;Anatomy of an Epidemic&quot; (2010), Robert Whitaker described the partnership that has developed between the APA and pharmaceutical companies since the 1980s. APA has come to depend on pharmaceutical money. The drug companies endowed continuing education and psychiatric &quot;grand rounds&quot; at hospitals. They funded a political action committee in 1982 to lobby Congress. The industry helped to pay for the APA&#x27;s media training workshops. It was able to turn psychiatrists at top schools into speakers, and although the doctors felt they were independents, they rehearsed their speeches and likely would not be invited back if they discussed drug side effects. &quot;Thought leaders&quot; became the experts quoted in the media. As Marcia Angell wrote in &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; (2000), &quot;thought leaders&quot; could agree to be listed as an author of ghostwritten articles, and she cites Thomas Bodenheimer and David Rothman who describe the extent of the drug industry&#x27;s involvement with doctors. &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a summary about antipsychotic medications in October 2010.

In 2008, for the first time, Senator Charles Grassley asked the APA to disclose how much of its annual budget came from drug industry funds. The APA said that industry contributed 28 percent of its budget ($14 million at that time), mainly through paid advertising in APA journals and funds for continuing medical education.

The APA receives additional funding from the pharmaceutical industry through its American Psychiatric Association Foundation (APAF), including Boehringer Ingelheim, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, among others.

==Controversies==
In the 1964 election, &quot;Fact&quot; magazine polled American Psychiatric Association members on whether Barry Goldwater was fit to be president and published &quot;The Unconscious of a Conservative: A Special Issue on the Mind of Barry Goldwater&quot;. This led to a ban on the diagnosis of a public figure by psychiatrists who have not performed an examination or been authorized to release information by the patient. This became the Goldwater rule.

Supported by various funding sources, the APA and its members have played major roles in examining points of contention in the field and addressing uncertainties about psychiatric illness and its treatment, as well as the relationship of individual mental health concerns to those of the community. Controversies have related to anti-psychiatry and disability rights campaigners, who regularly protest at American Psychiatric Association offices or meetings. In 1970, members of the Gay Liberation Front organization protested the APA conference in San Francisco. In 2003 activists from MindFreedom International staged a 21-day hunger strike, protesting at a perceived unjustified biomedical focus and challenging APA to provide evidence of the widespread claim that mental disorders are due to chemical imbalances in the brain. APA published a position statement in response and the two organizations exchanged views on the evidence.

The APA&#x27;s DSM came under criticism from autism specialists Tony Attwood and Simon Baron-Cohen for proposing the elimination of Asperger&#x27;s syndrome as a disorder and replacing it with an autism spectrum severity scale. Roy Richard Grinker wrote a controversial editorial for &quot;The New York Times&quot; expressing support for the proposal.

The APA president in 2005, Steven Sharfstein, praised the pharmaceutical industry but argued that American psychiatry had &quot;allowed the biopsychosocial model to become the bio-bio-bio model&quot; and accepted &quot;kickbacks and bribes&quot; from pharmaceutical companies leading to the over-use of medication and neglect of other approaches.

In 2008 APA was the focus of congressional investigations on how pharmaceutical industry money shapes the practices of nonprofit organizations that purport to be independent. The drug industry accounted in 2006 for about 30 percent of the association&#x27;s $62.5 million in financing, half through drug advertisements in its journals and meeting exhibits, and the other half sponsoring fellowships, conferences and industry symposiums at its annual meeting. The APA came under increasing scrutiny and questions about conflicts of interest.

The APA president in 2009–10, Alan Schatzberg, was identified as the principal investigator on a federal study into the drug mifepristone for use as an antidepressant being developed by Corcept Therapeutics, a company Schatzberg had created and in which he had several million dollars&#x27; equity.

In 2021, the APA issued an apology for its historical role in perpetuating racism.

<doc id="160914" wikidata="Q130327" url="?curid=160914" title="Stamford Raffles">
<text>Sir Thomas Stamford Bingley Raffles (5 July 1781 – 5 July 1826) was a British colonial official who served as the governor of the Dutch East Indies between 1811 and 1816 and lieutenant-governor of Bencoolen between 1818 and 1824. Raffles was involved in the capture of the Indonesian island of Java from the Dutch during the Napoleonic Wars. It was returned under the Anglo–Dutch Treaty of 1824. He also wrote &quot;The History of Java&quot; in 1817, describing the history of the island from ancient times. The &quot;Rafflesia&quot; flowers were named after him.

Raffles also played a role in further establishing the British Empire&#x27;s reach in East and Southeast Asia. He secured control over the strategically located Singapore from local rulers in 1819 to secure British access along the Strait of Singapore and the nearby seas in the region, particularly the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. His actions were initially not endorsed by the British government and led to tensions between the British and the Dutch. The Anglo–Dutch Treaty of 1824 established their respective spheres of influence, the Dutch relinquishing their claims to Singapore while the British ceded Bencoolen to them. A transshipment port was subsequently established in Singapore for maritime trade between Europe and Asia.

While Raffles was largely credited for the founding of contemporary Singapore, the early running of day-to-day operations was mostly done by William Farquhar, who served as the first Resident of Singapore from 1819 to 1823. Raffles soon returned to England in 1824, where he died on his birthday in 1826 at the age of 45. His legacy while complex remains significant in Singapore, most notably the Raffles&#x27;s Landing Site, as well as his name being a common sight in numerous entities and institutions throughout the country. Others have argued against excessive reverence as he was an imperialist who projected colonialism onto the population of Singapore that predated his arrival.

==Early life==
Thomas Stamford Bingley Raffles was born on on board the ship &quot;Ann&quot;, off the coast of Port Morant, Jamaica, to Captain Benjamin Raffles (1739, London – 23 November 1811, Deptford) and Anne Raffles (née Lyde) (1755 – 8 February 1824, London). Benjamin served as a ship master for various ships engaged in the direct trade between England and the West Indies. Although some biographers have suggested that Benjamin was involved in the slave trade, modern historians have refuted such claims. When Benjamin ended his involvement in the West India trade in 1800, it caused his family considerable hardship.

The little money the family had went into sending the young Raffles to the Mansion House Academy, Hammersmith, a moderately priced boarding school, offering Latin, Greek, French, arithmetic, bookkeeping and geography, that specialised in preparing boys for clerkships or the army. In 1795, at the age of 14, Raffles started working in London as a clerk for the East India Company. Nine years later, in 1804, the 23-year-old Raffles married Olivia Mariamne Devenish, a widow ten years his senior, who was formerly married to Jacob Cassivelaun Fancourt, an assistant surgeon in Madras, who had died in 1800.

In 1805, he was sent to Prince of Wales Island, Malaya, starting his long association with Southeast Asia. He started as assistant secretary, under the Honourable Philip Dundas, the new governor of Penang. At this time, he also made the acquaintance of Thomas Otho Travers, who would accompany him for the next twenty years.

==Java Island==
===British invasion of Java===

His knowledge of the Malay language, as well as his wit and ability, gained him favour with Lord Minto, the governor-general of India, and he was sent to Malacca.

In 1811, after the annexation of the Kingdom of Holland by France during Napoleon&#x27;s war, Raffles had no choice but to leave the country. He mounted a military expedition against the Dutch and French in Java, in the Dutch East Indies. The war was swiftly conducted by Admiral Robert Stopford, General Frederick Augustus Wetherall, and Colonel Robert Rollo Gillespie, who led a well-organised army against an opposing army of mostly French conscripts with little proper leadership.

The previous Dutch governor, Herman Willem Daendels, had built a well-defended fortification at Meester Cornelis (now Jatinegara). His successor, Governor Jan Willem Janssens, who coincidentally had surrendered to the British five years earlier at the Cape Colony, mounted a brave but ultimately futile defence at the fortress. The British, led by Colonel Gillespie, stormed the fort and captured it within three hours. Governor Janssens attempted to escape inland but was captured.

The British invasion of Java took a total of forty-five days, during which Raffles was appointed the lieutenant-governor of the Dutch East Indies by Lord Minto before hostilities formally ceased. He took his residence at Buitenzorg, and despite having a small group of Britons as his senior staff, kept many of the Dutch civil servants in the governmental structure.

===Rule===

During the relatively brief period of British rule in Java, Raffles negotiated several peace treaties along with ordering several military expeditions against local rulers. Rumours of plans by the Yogyakarta Sultanate to launch an attack against the British led to uneasiness among Britons in Java. On 20 June 1812, Raffles led a 1,200-strong British force to capture the Royal Palace of Yogyakarta. Yogyakarta forces, surprised by the attack, were easily defeated; the palace fell in one day, and was subsequently sacked and burnt. Raffles ordered the much of the palace&#x27;s archives to be removed, taking them back with him. The attack was unprecedented in Javanese history, as it was the first time an indigenous palace had been captured by a European army, humiliating the Yogyakarta Sultanate.

Although peace returned to Central Java in the immediate aftermath of the attack, it may have fuelled the deep-seated instability and hostility to European involvement in the region that ultimately gave rise to the Java War during the 1820s. Raffles also ordered an expedition to Palembang, Sumatra to depose local sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II. The expedition was also ordered to occupy the nearby Bangka Island in order to establish a permanent British presence in the area, in case Java returned to Dutch rule after the end of the War of the Sixth Coalition in Europe.

During his lieutenant-governorship, Raffles placed some restrictions on the local slave trade in line with wider British policy across its Asian territories, although slavery remained widespread and Raffles himself was served by a large retinue of slaves at his official residences in Java. Raffles also attempted a replacement of the Dutch system of forced agricultural deliveries-in-kind with a cash-based land tenure system of land management, probably influenced by the earlier anti-feudal critiques of Dirk van Hogendorp He was advised by a holdover from the previous Dutch regime on Java, the president of the High Court of Java, Herman Warner Muntinghe, especially in the matter of the reform of the public finances of the colony, and its system of taxation.

Under Raffles&#x27;s aegis, a large number of ancient monuments in Java were systematically catalogued for the first time. The first detailed English-language account of Prambanan was prepared by Colin Mackenzie, while the Buddhist temple of Borobudur was surveyed and cleared of vegetation by H. C. Cornelius.

When his wife, Olivia, died on 26 November 1814, Raffles was devastated. In 1815, he left again for England shortly before the island of Java was returned to control of the Netherlands following the Napoleonic Wars, under the terms of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814. Raffles had been removed from his post by the East India Company ahead of the handover, and officially replaced by John Fendall Jr. on account of the poor financial performance of the colony during his administration, and allegations of financial impropriety on his own part. He sailed to England in early 1816 to clear his name and, en route, visited Napoleon, who was in exile at St. Helena, but found him unpleasant and unimpressive.

==Interlude in England==
In 1817, Raffles wrote and published &quot;The History of Java&quot;, describing the history of the island from ancient times as well as its geography, flora, and fauna.

In 1817, Raffles was created a Knight Bachelor by the Prince Regent George IV, whose daughter, Princess Charlotte, was particularly close to him. At the publication of the book, he also stopped using the name &#x27;Thomas&#x27;, preferring to use his middle name, &#x27;Stamford&#x27;, possibly to avoid confusion amongst his associates with Sir Thomas Sevestre, or his cousin, Thomas Raffles, who both bore the same first name.

On 22 February, he married his second wife, Sophia Hull, and later set sail to Bencoolen (present-day Bengkulu in Indonesia) to take up his new post with his new wife.

==Bencoolen and Malaya==

Raffles arrived in Bencoolen on Sumatra on 19 March 1818, where he was appointed as the lieutenant-governor of Bencoolen on 22 March 1818. Despite the prestige connected with the title of Lieutenant-Governor, Bencoolen was a colonial backwater, whose only real export was pepper, and only the murder of a previous Resident, Thomas Parr, gained it any attention back home in Britain. Raffles found the place wrecked, and set about reforms immediately, mostly similar to what he had done on Java; abolishing slavery and limiting cockfighting and such games. To replace the slaves, he used a contingent of convicts, already sent to him from India.

It was at this point that he realised the importance of a British presence that both challenged the Dutch hegemony in the area, and could remain consistently profitable, unlike Bencoolen or Batavia. However, the strategic importance of poorly maintained but well-positioned British possessions, such as Penang or Bencoolen, made it impossible for the British to abandon the unprofitable colonies in such proximity to the Dutch in Java.

The competition in the area, between Raffles and the aggressive Dutch commissioner-general, Cornelis Theodorus Elout, and later Raffles&#x27; former advisor on Java, Muntinghe, now a member of the new High Government of the Dutch East Indies, who Elout had put in power, certainly led at least in part to the later Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824. Raffles looked into alternatives in the area; namely Bangka, which had been ceded to the Dutch after its conquest by the British during its occupation of Java. Bintan was also under consideration. Despite the fact that Francis Light overlooked the island before settling upon Penang in 1786, the Riau Archipelago was an attractive choice just to the south of the Malay Peninsula, for its proximity to Malacca.

In his correspondences with Calcutta, Raffles also emphasised the need to establish a certain amount of influence with the native chiefs, which had greatly waned since the return of the Dutch. Raffles sent Thomas Travers as an ambassador to the Dutch, to possibly negotiate an expansion of British economic interests. When this failed, and when Raffles&#x27;s own expeditions into his new dominion found only treacherous terrain and few exportable goods, his desire to establish a better British presence was cemented.

However, the Anglo-Dutch Convention of 1814 was not completely clear, especially on the issue of certain possessions such as Padang. The Convention of 1814 only returned Dutch territory that was held before 1803, which did not include Padang. Raffles asserted the British claim personally, leading a small expedition to the Kingdom of Pagaruyung. Yet, as Raffles confirmed with the sultan regarding the absolute British influence of the area, he realised that the local rulers had only limited power over the well-cultivated and civilised country, and the treaty was largely symbolic, and had little actual force.

==Founding of modern Singapore==
Major-General William Farquhar, the British Resident of Malacca, had been attempting to negotiate commercial treaties with the local chiefs of the Riau Archipelago, especially before Raffles&#x27; arrival. Farquhar was compelled to sign the treaty not with the official head of the sultanate, but rather, the Raja Muda (Regent or Crown Prince) of Riau. He noted it as a success, and reported it as such to Raffles.

Raffles sailed to Malacca in late 1818, to personally secure a British presence in the Riau area, especially &quot;Singapura&quot;, which was favoured by him both through the readings of Malayan histories, and by Farquhar&#x27;s explorations. Despite Lord Hastings&#x27; less-than-stellar opinion of Raffles before (which had necessitated his trip to England to clear his name at the end of his tenure as Lieutenant-Governor of Java), the now well-connected and successful Raffles was able to secure permission to set up a settlement. At this point in Singaporean history, the name &quot;Lion City&quot; was applied. The city was in a strategically advantageous position; however, he was ordered not to provoke the Dutch, and his subsequent actions were officially disavowed by the British government.

In London, Lord Castlereagh attempted to quell Dutch fears, and continuing efforts were made to reach an agreement between the nations that eventually became the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of London of 1824. As well as the treaty, instructions were sent out to Raffles to undertake far less intrusive actions; however, the long distance between the Far East and Europe meant that the orders had no chance of reaching Raffles in time.

===Establishment===
After a brief survey of the Karimun Islands, on 29 January 1819, he established a post at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. It was established that there was no Dutch presence on the island of Singapore. Johor also no longer had any control of the area, so contact was made with the Temenggong Abdul Rahman. The contacts were friendly, and Raffles, knowledgeable about the muddled political situation, took advantage to provide a rudimentary treaty between the nominal chiefs of the area that called for the exclusivity of trade, and the British protection of the area. Members of Raffles&#x27;s party surveyed the island, and proceeded to request the presence of the sultan, or whoever at the time had supreme nominal power, to sign a formal treaty, while Major Farquhar was ordered to do the same in Rhio (Riau). 

The writings of Raffles and Farquhar indicate that the British found Temenggong Abdul Rahman with 400 to 500 residents in Singapore in January 1819. Another member of the 1819 expedition party, Captain John Crawford, recalled in his diary an encounter with “upwards of 100” of Chinese. British colonial documentations revealed that Temenggong Abdul Rahman had provided these Chinese who were Teochews the cost and expenses of opening gambier plantations at Mount Stamford (now Pearl’s Hill) prior to British arrival. He had also “in some instances” advanced money to the Teochew cultivators on the understanding he would be repaid in the form of gambier or other produce. Farquhar had the impressions that the Temenggong’s interests in these plantations were represented by a brother-in-law of his named Baba Ketchil and the first Captain China of Singapore, a Teochew merchant named Tan Heng Kim ((陈亨钦), was “one of the principal persons concerned”. 

A few days later, the formal treaty was signed by Hussein Shah who claimed to be the &quot;lawful sovereign of the whole of territories extending from Lingga and Johor to Mount Muar&quot;. Although Hussein Shah had had no previous contact with the British, he had certainly heard of the strength of the Royal Navy, and was in no position to argue against the terms. Raffles reassured him that the Dutch posed no threat in the area. Hussein Shah had been the crown Prince of Johor, but while he was away in Pahang to get married, his father died, and his younger brother was made sultan, supported by some of the court officials and the Dutch. To circumvent the situation of having to negotiate with a sultan influenced by the Dutch, Raffles decided to recognise, on behalf of the British Crown, Hussein Shah as being the rightful ruler of Johor.

Farquhar&#x27;s attempt to establish a more favourable treaty in Rhio (Riau) was met with greater challenge, as the Dutch were present, and made for a rather awkward position. The Dutch were alarmed, and sent a small contingent to the island. Despite a covert offer of against the Dutch offered by the Raja of Rhio (Riau), Farquhar returned, and an official protest was sent by the Raja to Java regarding the matter.

Raffles declared the foundation of what was to become modern Singapore on 6 February, securing the transfer of control of the island to the East India Company. With much pomp and ceremony, the official treaty was read aloud in languages representing all nations present, as well as the Malay and Chinese inhabitants.

Sultan Hussein Shah was paid 5,000 Spanish dollars a year, while Temenggong Abdul Rahman received 3,000 a year, both massive sums at the time, roughly equivalent to £287,000 and £172,000 now.

Farquhar was officially named the Resident of Singapore, and Raffles was named as &#x27;Agent to the Most Noble the Governor-General with the States of Rhio (Riau), Lingin (Lingga) and Johor&#x27;. Although ownership of the post was to be exclusively British, explicit orders were given to Farquhar to maintain free passage of ships through the Strait of Singapore, and a small military presence was established alongside the trading post. After issuing orders to Farquhar and the remaining Europeans, Raffles left the next day, 7 February 1819.

===Achin, and the early conflict with the Dutch===
Raffles also planned to start a British presence in Achin, on the northern tip of Sumatra. As soon as he had departed, the Raja of Rhio (Riau) sent letters to the Dutch, disclaiming the deal, protesting innocence, and blaming British encroachment. Meanwhile, in Malacca, the Dutch acted at once, commanding that no Malays could go to Singapore. Raffles&#x27;s bold claim of Singapore created a curious geographic situation: although Penang was clearly closer in distance to Singapore, Raffles, in his capacity as Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen, was nominally still in control. This undoubtedly irked the authorities in Penang, to the point where they refused to send any sepoys to Singapore to complete the garrison.

Official Dutch complaints came before the end of the month, and Raffles attempted to appease the situation by instructing Farquhar to not interfere with the politics of surrounding islands. Despite numerous threats and serious considerations by the Dutch governor-general Van der Capellen in Java, they did not take any military action. The confused political situation in Johore and Rhio also created a certain uneasiness and instability for the two nations. Tengku Long was claimed to be a pretender to the throne, and, since the succession laws in the Malay sultanates were not clear cut, treaties signed between native rulers and the European powers always seemed to be on the verge of invalidation; especially if a sultan should be deposed by one of his siblings or other pretenders.

Nonetheless, amidst uncertainty and intrigue, Raffles landed in Achin on 14 March 1819, with begrudging help of Penang. Once again, it seems that multiple people were in power, but none wanted to formally deal with the British. The hostile atmosphere created allowed Raffles to cancel the only meeting he was able to arrange, with Panglima Polim, a powerful divisional chief, fearing . As the influential merchant John Palmer, Raffles, and fellow commissioner John Monckton Coombs of Penang sat offshore, awaiting a response, Calcutta debated whether to reinforce the port city. Evacuation plans were made, but the Dutch never acted, and ultimately Lord Hastings prompted Colonel Bannerman, the governor of Penang, to send funds to bolster Singapore. Finally Raffles was capable of convincing his fellow commissioners to sign a treaty with Jauhar al-Alam Shah, the ruler of Achin, which installed a British Resident, as well as guaranteeing the exclusivity of bilateral trade.

By the time Raffles had returned to Singapore, on 31 May, much of the immediate crisis that the colony had caused in Penang and Calcutta had passed. By then, the initial five-hundred villagers had grown to become five-thousand merchants, soldiers, and administrators, packed onto the island. Raffles was determined to destroy the Dutch mercantile monopoly in the area, to replace it with a gateway for trade with China and Japan. The latter he had attempted but failed to reach an agreement with while governing Java.

===First year of Singapore===
While in Singapore, Raffles established schools and churches in the local languages. He allowed missionaries and local businesses to flourish. Certain colonial aspects remained: a European town was quickly built to segregate the population, separated by a river; carriage roads were built, and cantonments constructed for the soldiers. Otherwise, no other duties were imposed.

Confident that Farquhar would follow his instructions well, Raffles sailed for Bencoolen once again on 28 June.

==Bencoolen, once again==

Raffles was still the lieutenant-governor of Bencoolen when he returned. Raffles started more reforms that were, by now, almost trademarks of his rule over the colonies. Forced labour was abolished when he first arrived, and he declared Bencoolen a free port as well. The currency was regulated and, as he had an excess of out-of-work civil servants, they formed committees to advise him on the daily running of the colony. However, Bencoolen was not as self-sufficient as Singapore. The area was poor and disease-ridden: the first reports from the committees reflected very poorly upon the condition of the colony. Unlike the salutary neglect Raffles granted upon Singapore, he delayed European-inspired reforms, emphasising only the cultivation of whatever land was available.

Native authorities were given power in their respective districts, and were answerable only to the lieutenant-governor. The slave-debtor system was brought in, instead of the old slavery system that Raffles had abolished in Java, Borneo, and initially in Bencoolen. Slave-debtors were registered, and educational reforms started to focus on children, instead of the entire population. Raffles looked into a long-term plan for the slow reform of Bencoolen.

Unlike many other European adventurers, Raffles did not impose upon the colonised the alien language or culture of the coloniser. In addition to preserving the artifacts, fauna, and flora of his colonies, he also allowed religious freedom, which was especially important as the Malay states were largely Muslim. Christian schools were started by missionaries in all of his colonies.

===Consolidation of the Eastern Isles===
Colonel Bannerman&#x27;s death in Penang in October 1819 brought new opportunities for Raffles to expand his power to also include the other minor British factories and outposts; from Sumatra to Cochin China. He sailed to Calcutta, and as Lord Hastings sought to consolidate all of the small British possessions in the East Indies. During his sojourn, he had the opportunity to argue for free trade, and the protection of the private enterprise. Education and the retention of small British outposts were also discussed.

The Dutch claim on the Sultanate of Johore and hence, Rhio, and the diplomatic exchanges between Baron Godert van der Capellen and Calcutta continued throughout this time. The legitimacy of the British treaties was also questioned once again, but finally, as Singapore grew at an exponential rate, the Dutch gave up their claim on the island, allowing the colony to continue as a British possession. However, the pressures put upon Calcutta ensured that no single governor of all British possessions in the Strait or on Sumatra was appointed, and Raffles, whose health was slowly ailing, returned to Bencoolen.

==Administration of Bencoolen, 1820–1822==
Raffles returned to Bencoolen in ill-health, but as his health improved, he continued on his quest to learn about the island he now called home. He studied the Batak cannibals of Tapanuli, and their rituals and laws regarding the consumption of human flesh, writing in detail about the transgressions that warranted such an act, as well as their methods. He also noted the rise of the Sikh religion in certain parts of Sumatra.

By early 1820, Tengku Long had firmly established himself as the Sultan of Johor to the British, but the political situation in the area remained a befuddled mess, with the old sultan dying, and many new ones attempting to gain either the crown or regency. As Farquhar was involving himself poorly in local politics, Raffles appointed Travers as the Resident of Singapore, replacing Farquhar. Upon his arrival, Travers found the colony a delightful smörgåsbord of different races and cultures, numbering over six thousand. He also found that Singapore&#x27;s trade was slowly overtaking that of Java.

As in Java, Raffles collected samples of local species of plant and animal, as well as describing them in his journals. He located other tribes, and recorded their customs, especially their religions and laws. Bringing the island of Nias under British rule, he noted its civilised state and high production yields of rice.

Yet the production of food remained a problem. In Bencoolen, Raffles paid special attention to the agricultural methods of the Chinese, including an introduction to the only issue of &quot;Proceedings of the Agricultural Society&quot;. To remedy the shortages, his employer, the East India Company, concerned themselves only with profit-taking. Even as Raffles lived like a country gentleman, and ran his colony like an estate, his expenditure on nature preservation was seriously frowned upon. In both Calcutta and London, they discussed his removal from office, while Castlereagh continued negotiations with the Dutch regarding the ongoing diplomatic conflicts.

Luckily, the Singapore issue had its supporters in the House, so as negotiations continued in Europe, Raffles remained largely idle in Bencoolen. The only major issue, outside the politics of the local sultans, involved the replacement of Farquhar, who decided that he had no intention of leaving his post voluntarily, causing a moment of tension between him and Travers. Raffles&#x27;s request for Travers to deliver dispatches to India nullified the issue late in the year, and Farquhar remained in charge of Singapore, with its survival still in doubt for many in both India and London, who believed that it would either be handed over to the Dutch, or taken violently by force when Castlereagh&#x27;s negotiations had ended. Still William Farquhar stirred up more trouble, especially with local English merchants over trivial matters of self-importance, and overreaction over small infractions of white traders, for some of which he was reprimanded by Calcutta officially. Public works, commissioned by Raffles but undertaken by Farquhar, were becoming overwhelmingly expensive.

Personal tragedies also started for Raffles. His eldest son, Leopold Stamford (b. 1818), died during an epidemic on 4 July 1821. The oldest daughter, Charlotte (b. 1818), was also sick with dysentery by the end of the year, but it would be his youngest son, Stamford Marsden (b. 1820), who would perish first with the disease, on 3 January 1822, with Charlotte to follow ten days later. For the good part of four months, the couple remained devastated. The year would be eventful with the suicide of Castlereagh, and the appointment of Lord Amherst as the governor-general of India, replacing Hastings. As Raffles grew restless and depressed, he decided to visit Singapore before retiring and heading home to England. Accompanying him would be his wife Sophia and their only surviving child, Ella.

Raffles was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society (AAS) in 1822.

==Singapore (1822–1823)==

Raffles returned to Singapore in October 1822. Raffles was pleased with the fact that Singapore had grown exponentially in such a short period of time. The colony was a bustling hub of trade and economic activity. Even so, Farquhar&#x27;s administration was deemed unsatisfactory, for example, he allowed merchants to encroach on government areas, permitted vices such as gambling, and tolerated slave trade. In response, Raffles instituted new policies, and set up a committee headed by the colony&#x27;s engineer, Philip Jackson to draw up a plan, now known as the Jackson Plan or Raffles Town Plan, based on instructions by Raffles. The plan was still racially segregated, giving the best land to the Europeans. Yet it was considered remarkably scientific for the time. Raffles also supervised the levelling of a small hill south of Singapore River to create Commercial Square (now Raffles Place).

It was also during the re-planning and reconstruction of the port town that Farquhar dramatically argued with Raffles, who now considered him unfit for the position of Resident. Raffles dismissed Farquhar in April 1823, and took direct control. He had written to Calcutta declaring Farquhar to be incompetent in January 1823, and repeated efforts were made to persuade Calcutta to send a replacement for Farquhar; but they remained unanswered. Raffles made Johor a British protectorate, raising a protest from Van der Capellen. Eventually, Calcutta appointed John Crawfurd, who had followed Raffles for over twenty years, as the new Resident of Singapore, while Captain William Gordon MacKenzie took over Bencoolen. In March 1823, coincidentally the same day he was replaced, he received an official reprimand from London for the takeover of Nias.

Raffles convened a meeting on 1 April 1823, with the intention of opening a Malay college in Singapore, based on his observations on his years in southeast Asia, and his belief of the importance of both the local and the European languages. Raffles personally gave $2,000 towards the effort, the East India Company gave $4,000, with the contributions from various subscribers totalling $17,495. This would be the founding of Raffles Institution.

In the final few weeks of his stay in Singapore, in 1823, Raffles drafted a series of administrative regulations for Singapore that aimed to govern Singapore in a fair manner, but also reflected his stance on various moral and social issues. A registration system was first instituted for all land, regardless of ownership, and the repossession of the land by the government if land remained unregistered. This act asserted the power of the British government as it covered land previously owned by the Sultan as well. This is followed by laws regarding the port and freedom of trade. In May 1823, he outlawed gambling, imposed heavy taxation on what he considered social evils such as drunkenness and opium-smoking, and banned slavery. A police force and magistracy were also set up on British principles, turning a trading post into a proper city with some semblance of order. A specific regulation in the constitution called for the multi-ethnic population to remain as they were; and no crimes were entirely based on racial principles. Raffles worked on drafting laws, defining exactly &#x27;what&#x27; constituted a criminal act. However, Raffles tolerated the practice of regulated debt-slavery, which gave the appearance of free labour while remaining a cheap option for labour.
Finally, on 9 June 1823, feeling that his work in establishing Singapore was finished, he boarded a ship for home, but not before a stop in Batavia to visit his old home, and adversary, van der Capellen. A final stop in Bencoolen followed. Tragedy befell Raffles once more when his youngest daughter, Flora Nightingall, born on 19 September, died a little over one month later on 28 November while still in Bencoolen.

On 2 February 1824, Raffles and his family embarked on the East Indiaman for England. She caught fire from Bencoolen the evening after she sailed. All aboard were able to take to her boats and were saved, although the ship herself was totally destroyed. The fire claimed most of his drawings and papers.

The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 finally settled the score in the East Indies. The British gained dominance in the north, while the entirety of Sumatra became Dutch. The Malay Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent were both free of Dutch interference. Raffles finally returned to England on 22 August 1824, over a year after he left Singapore. His longest tenure in Singapore was only eight months, but he was considered the founder of Singapore nevertheless.

==Return to Britain and death==
Upon arrival in England in poor health, Sir Stamford and Lady Raffles convalesced in Cheltenham until September 1824, after which he entertained distinguished guests in both London and his home. He also made plans to stand for parliament, but this ambition was never realised. They moved to a London address at Berners Street at the end of November 1824, just in time to have a war of words with Farquhar, who had also arrived in the city, in front of the Court of Directors of the East India Company regarding Singapore. Despite raising several severe charges against Raffles, Farquhar was ultimately unable to discredit him; he was denied a chance to be restored to Singapore, but was given a military promotion instead.

With the Singapore matter settled, Raffles turned to his other great interests: botany and zoology. He was elected a member of the Linnean Society of London on 5 February 1825. Raffles was a founder (in 1825) and first president (elected April 1826) of the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and the London Zoo.

Meanwhile, he was not only not granted a pension, but was called to pay over twenty-two thousand pounds sterling for losses incurred during his administration. Raffles replied by clarifying his actions: and he decided to move to his country estate, Highwood, North London, but before the issue was resolved, he was already much too ill.

He died of apoplexy at Highwood House in Mill Hill, north London, on his 45th birthday, 5 July 1826. The most likely underlying cause of death is that of a dural arteriovenous fistula. His estate amounted to around ten thousand pounds sterling, which was paid to the company to cover his outstanding debt. Because of his anti-slavery position, he was refused burial inside the local parish church (St Mary&#x27;s Church, Hendon) by the vicar, Theodor Williams, whose family had made its money in Jamaica in the slave trade. A brass tablet was finally placed in 1887, but the actual whereabouts of his body was not known until 1914, when it was found in a vault. When the church was extended in the 1920s, his tomb was incorporated into the body of the building, and a square floor tablet with inscription marked the spot.

Raffles was survived by his second wife Sophia Hull and daughter Ella, and predeceased by his other four children in Bencoolen.

Ella died in 1840, aged nineteen. Sophia remained at Highwood House until her death in 1858, at the age of 72. Her tomb and memorial may be seen in St Paul&#x27;s Church graveyard, Mill Hill, close to the rear door of the church. All his other children remained buried overseas. Thirty-three years after his death, Raffles&#x27; substantial collection of Indonesian antiquities and ethnography was donated to the British Museum by his nephew, Rev William Charles Raffles Flint.

==Memorial sculpture in Westminster Abbey, London==

A life-size figure in white marble by Sir Francis Chantrey depicts Raffles in a seated position in Westminster Abbey, London, England. The sculpture was completed in 1832, and it is in the north choir aisle.

The inscription reads:To the memory of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, L.L.D. F.R.S. Lieut. Governor of Java and first President of the Zoological Society of London. Born 1781 Died 1826. Selected at an early age to conduct the government of the British conquests in the Indian ocean, by wisdom, vigour, and philanthropy, he raised Java to happiness and prosperity unknown under former rulers. After the surrender of that island to the Dutch, and during his government in Sumatra he founded an emporium at Singapore, where in establishing freedom of person as the right of the soil, and freedom of trade as the right of the port, he secured to the British flag the maritime superiority of the eastern seas. Ardently attached to science, he laboured successfully to add to the knowledge and enrich the museums of his native land, in promoting the welfare of the people committed to his charge, he sought the good of his country, and the glory of God.

==Legacy==
In Singapore, and in other parts of the world, his name lives on in numerous entities, including:

===Natural history===
* Raffles gave the scientific name to &quot;Macaca fascicularis&quot;, also known as the crab-eating macaque.
* He also gave the scientific name of the lesser mouse-deer (&quot;Tragulus kanchil&quot;).

A number of species are named after him:
* &quot;Chaetodon rafflesii&quot;, latticed butterflyfish
* &quot;Dinopium rafflesii&quot;, olive-backed woodpecker
* &quot;Megalaima rafflesi&quot;, red-crowned barbet
* &quot;Nepenthes rafflesiana&quot;, a species of pitcher plant
* &quot;Protanilla rafflesi&quot; Taylor, 1990, a species of ant
* &quot;Rafflesia&quot;, a genus of parasitic flowering plants, known for having the largest flowers in the world
* &quot;Theridion rafflesi&quot; Simon, 1899, spider from Sumatra

While in Sumatra Raffles commissioned artists to make drawings of his collections of animals and plants. The surviving drawings are held by the British Library.Most natural history specimens collected by Raffles were lost with the sinking of &quot;Fame.&quot; A few sent earlier, and some collected later, survive at the Natural History Museum, London and World Museum.

<text>The term Five Civilized Tribes was applied by the United States government in the early federal period of the history of the United States to the five major Native American nations in the Southeast: the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee (Creek), and Seminoles. White Americans classified them as &quot;civilized&quot; because they had adopted attributes of the Anglo-American culture.

The descriptor &quot;civilized&quot;, historically used to obscure the cultural imperialism of White settlers, is seldom used nowadays because of the derogatory implication that other Native tribes were uncivilized. Consequently, the grouping of these nations is referred to as The Five Tribes or simply Five Tribes.

Examples of such colonial attributes adopted by these five tribes included Christianity, centralized governments, literacy, market participation, written constitutions, intermarriage with White Americans, and chattel slavery practices, including purchase of enslaved Black Americans. For a period, the Five Civilized Tribes tended to maintain stable political relations with the White population. However, White encroachment continued and eventually led to the removal of these tribes from the Southeast, most prominently along the Trail of Tears.

In the 21st century, this term has been criticized by some scholars for its ethnocentric assumptions by Anglo-Americans of what they considered civilized, but representatives of these tribes continue to meet regularly on a quarterly basis in their Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes.

The descendants of these tribes, who primarily live in what is now Oklahoma, are sometimes referred to as the Five Tribes of Oklahoma, although several other federally recognized tribes are also located in that state.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;civilized tribes&quot; was adopted to distinguish the Five Tribes from other Native American tribes that were described as &quot;wild&quot; or &quot;savage&quot;. Texts written by non-indigenous scholars and writers have used words like &quot;savage&quot; and &quot;wild&quot; to identify Indian groups that retained their traditional cultural practices after European contact. As a consequence of evolving attitudes toward ethnocentric word usage and more rigorous ethnographical standards, the term &quot;Five Civilized Tribes&quot; is rarely used in contemporary academic publications.

George Washington believed that the only way Indians could survive in proximity to White settlers was for them to become civilized. The United States accordingly adopted a policy of civilizing Indians while Washington was president. The policy assumed that civilized Indians would require less land, and would need money, so that they would be willing to sell the excess land to White settlers. In White American terms, Indians became civilized by the men giving up hunting and becoming farmers, displacing the women who traditionally had been the primary farmers. They were expected to use draft animals and to give up maize as a main crop and instead raise wheat and cotton. The women were to become housekeepers, caring for children and weaving cotton for clothing. The Indians were also expected to acquire slaves and use them like their White plantation neighbors did.

The word &quot;civilized&quot; was used by White settlers to refer to the Five Tribes, who, during the 18th and early 19th centuries, actively integrated Anglo-American customs into their own cultures. Sociologists, anthropologists, and interdisciplinary scholars alike are interested in how and why these native peoples assimilated certain features of the alien culture of the White settlers who were encroaching on their lands. Historian Steve Brandon asserts that this &quot;adaptation and incorporation of aspects of white culture&quot; was a tactic employed by the Five Nations peoples to resist removal from their lands. While the term &quot;Five Civilized Tribes&quot; has been institutionalized in federal government policy to the point that the US Congress passed laws using the name, the Five Nations themselves have been less accepting of it in formal matters, and some members have declared that grouping the different peoples under this label is effectively another form of colonization and control by White society. Other modern scholars have suggested that the very concept of &quot;civilization&quot; was internalized by individuals who belonged to the Five Nations, but because much of Native North American history has been communicated by oral tradition, little scholarly research has been done to substantiate this.

In present-day commentary on Native American cultures, the term &quot;civilized&quot; is contentious and not commonly used in academic literature. Some commentators, including the Indian activist Vine Deloria Jr., have declared that it is demeaning and implies that the indigenous peoples of the North American continent were &quot;uncivilized&quot; before their contact with the habits, customs, and beliefs of Anglo-American settlers. The term is based on the assumption that different peoples possess objective &quot;degrees&quot; of civilization that may be assessed and raises the question of just what qualities define &quot;civilization&quot;. Consequently, it is considered a judgmental term whose meaning is dependent on the user&#x27;s perspective, and thus best avoided.

==History==
The Five Civilized Tribes is a term used for five major indigenous tribes who lived in the Southeastern United States. They lived in an area that had been influenced by the Mississippian culture. Prior to the arrival of white settlers, these tribes generally had matrilineal kinship systems, with property and hereditary positions passed through the mother&#x27;s family.

===First to 18th century===
Based on the development of surplus foods from cultivation, Mississippian towns had more dense populations, and they developed artisan classes, and hereditary religious and political elites. The Mississippian culture flourished in what is now the Midwestern, Eastern, and Southeastern United States from 800 to 1500 CE. Agriculture was the primary economic pursuit. The bulk of the tribes lived in towns, some covering hundreds of acres and populated with thousands of people. They were known for building large, complex earthwork mounds. These communities regulated their space with planned streets, subdivided into residential and public areas. Their system of government was hereditary. Chiefdoms were of varying size and complexity, with high levels of military organization.

===18th century===
President George Washington and Henry Knox, the first Secretary of War, implemented a policy of cultural transformation in relation to Native Americans. The Cherokee and Choctaw tended, in turn, to adopt and appropriate certain cultural aspects of the federation of colonies.

In 1776, assembled in Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, which was largely written by Thomas Jefferson. American independence was subsequently achieved by the victory of the Continental Army, led by George Washington, in the American Revolutionary War and codified in the Treaty of Paris in 1784.

The Five Tribes generally adopted cultural practices from Americans that they found useful. Tribal groups who had towns or villages closer to European-descendant Americans, or interacted more with them through trading or intermarriage, took up more of such new practices. Those towns that were more isolated tended to maintain their traditional cultures. George Washington promulgated a doctrine that held that Indian Americans were biologically equals, but that their societies were inferior. He formulated and implemented a policy to encourage civilizing them, which Thomas Jefferson continued and expanded. Historian Robert Remini wrote that the American leaders &quot;presumed that once the Indians adopted the practice of private property, built homes, farmed, educated their children, and embraced Christianity, these Native Americans would win acceptance from Americans of European descent.

George Washington&#x27;s six-point plan included: regulating the buying of Indian lands, promoting commerce with the tribes, promoting experiments to civilize or improve Indian society, authorizing presidential authority to bestow presents on the tribes, and punish those who violated Indian rights.

The US government appointed Indian agents, such as Benjamin Hawkins in the Southeast, to live among Indians and to encourage them, through example and instruction, to assimilate and adopt the lifestyle of White settlers. The tribes of the Southeast adopted Washington&#x27;s policy as they established schools, took up yeoman farming practices, converted to Christianity, and built homes similar to those of their colonial neighbors. These five tribes also adopted the practice of chattel slavery: holding enslaved African Americans as forced workers.

Following the establishment of independence following the American Revolutionary War, Americans pushed into the interior and into the Deep South, areas that were still largely dominated by Native Americans. The invention of the cotton gin made cultivation of short-staple cotton profitable in the interior, and settlers encroached on Native American lands in the Upper South, including western Georgia, and the future states of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. They demanded the chance to cultivate these lands for agriculture. Armed conflicts occurred between some of the tribes and the settlers, who kept pushing west and acquired additional territories through negotiated treaties with European colonial powers and sometimes by force.

===19th century===

In the early 19th century, under such leaders as Andrew Jackson, elected president in 1828, and others, the US government formally initiated Indian removal, forcing those tribes still living east of the Mississippi River, including the Five Tribes, to lands west of the river. Congress passed authorizing legislation in 1830, to fund such moves and arrange for new lands in what became known as Indian Territory to the west. Most members of the Five Tribes were forced to Indian Territory before 1840, many to what later became the states of Kansas and Oklahoma. The Cherokee Nation resisted removal until 1838 and lost thousands of members in removal, along what they called the Cherokee Trail of Tears. President Martin Van Buren had enforced the Treaty of New Echota, although the Senate had not ratified it, and a majority of the tribe said they had not agreed to its cessions of communal land.

Once the tribes had been relocated to Indian Territory, the US government promised that their lands would be free of American settlers. But settlers soon began to violate that, and enforcement was difficult in the western frontier.

====Freedmen of the Five Tribes====

The Five Tribes participated in Native American slave ownership that had enslaved Black people before and during the American Civil War. The Five Tribes largely supported the Confederacy, which had severed ties with the Union prior to the war, in large part because they were promised their own state if the Confederacy won. During removal to Indian Territory, &quot;the Five Tribes considered enslaved Black people an ideal way of transporting capital to the West&quot; because they were &quot;movable property.&quot;

After the end of the Civil War, the US required these tribes to make new peace treaties, and to emancipate their slaves, as slaves had been emancipated and were granted citizenship in the US. All Five Tribes acknowledged &quot;in writing that, because of the agreements they had made with the Confederate States during the Civil War, previous treaties made with the United States would no longer be upheld, thus prompting the need for a new treaty and an opportunity for the United States to fulfill its goal of wrenching more land&quot; from their grasp.

They were required to offer full citizenship in their tribes to those freedmen who wanted to stay with the tribes. Those who wanted to leave could become US citizens. By that time, numerous families had intermarried or had other personal ties with African Americans.

The Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 declared all slaves in the Confederacy, which were states that had separated from the Union, to be permanently free. The proclamation did not fully end slavery in the five border states that remained in the Union, but slavery everywhere in the nation was abolished with the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in December 1865.

The Civil Rights Act of 1866, passed over the veto of President Andrew Johnson, gave ex-slaves full citizenship, except for voting, in the United States. The Fourteenth Amendment was ratified to make clear that Congress had the legal authority to do so. The Fifteenth Amendment extended the franchise to all adult males; only adult males among Whites had previously had the franchise, and it was sometimes limited by certain requirements. The 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments are known as the &quot;civil rights amendments&quot;, the &quot;post-Civil War amendments&quot;, and the &quot;Reconstruction Amendments&quot;.

To help freedmen transition from slavery to freedom, including a free labor market, President Abraham Lincoln created the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, which assigned agents throughout the former Confederate states. The Bureau also founded schools to educate freedmen, both adults and children; helped freedmen negotiate labor contracts; and tried to minimize violence against freedmen. The era of Reconstruction was an attempt to establish new governments in the former Confederacy and to bring freedmen into society as voting citizens. Northern church bodies, such as the American Missionary Association and the Freewill Baptists, sent teachers to the South to assist in educating freedmen and their children, and eventually established several colleges for higher education. US Army occupation soldiers were stationed throughout the South via military districts enacted by the Reconstruction Acts; they tried to protect freedmen in voting polls and public facilities from violence and intimidation by White Southerners, which were common throughout the region.

The Chickasaw were allied with the Confederacy. After the Civil War, the US government required the nation also to make a new peace treaty in 1866. It included the provision that they emancipate the enslaved African Americans and provide full citizenship to those who wanted to stay in the Chickasaw Nation. The Chickasaw and Choctaw negotiated new treaties &quot;without a clause accepting their guilt, allowing them to declare that they had been forced into a Confederate alliance by American desertion.&quot; Unlike other tribes, Chickasaw tribal leaders never offered freedpeople citizenship. The slaves were freed and they could continue to live within the boundaries of the nation as second-class citizens, or they could move to Union states and no longer be associated with the tribe, which meant they did not participate in the Dawes Rolls of the 1890s, which registered tribal members.

The Choctaw-Chickasaw Freedmen Association of Oklahoma currently represents the interests of freedmen descendants in both of these tribes. The freed people of the Cherokee, Creek, and Seminole nations were able to enjoy most citizenship rights immediately after emancipation.

But the Chickasaw Nation and Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma never granted citizenship to their Freedmen. They enacted legislation similar to the US Black Codes, which set certain wages for ex-slaves and attempted to force freed people to find employment under Indian tribal members.

The only way that African Americans could become citizens of the Chickasaw Nation at that time was to have one or more Chickasaw parents, or to petition for citizenship and go through the process available to other non-Natives, even if they were known to have been of partial Chickasaw descent in an earlier generation. Because the Chickasaw Nation did not provide citizenship to their freedmen after the American Civil War, which they felt would be akin to formal adoption of individuals into the tribe, they were penalized by the US government. It took more than half of their territory, with no compensation. They lost territory that had been negotiated in treaties in exchange for their use after removal from the Southeast.

In the late 19th century, under the Dawes Act and related legislation, the US government decided to break up communal tribal lands, allocating 160-acre plots to heads of households of enrolled members of the tribes. It determined that land left over was &quot;surplus&quot; and could be sold, including to non-Native Americans. Allotment was also a means to extinguish Indian title to these lands, and the US government required the dissolution of tribal governments prior to admission of the territories as the US state of Oklahoma.

As American settlement increased in the Oklahoma Territory, pressure built to combine the territories and admit Oklahoma as a state.

In 1893, the government opened the &quot;Cherokee Strip&quot; to outside settlement in the Oklahoma Land Run.

===20th century===
In 1907, the Oklahoma Territory and the Indian Territory were merged to form the state of Oklahoma. Relative to other states, all Five Tribes are represented in significant numbers in the population of Oklahoma today.

In the late 20th century, the Cherokee Nation voted to restrict membership to only those descendants of persons listed as &quot;Cherokee by blood&quot; on the Dawes Rolls of the early 20th century. This decision excluded most Cherokee Freedmen; by this time, this term referred to descendants of the original group. At the time, registrars tended to classify any person with visible African American features as a Freedman, not inquiring or allowing them to document Indian descent.

===21st century===
Since the 20th century, the Freedmen have argued that the Dawes Rolls were often inaccurate in terms of recording Cherokee ancestry among persons of mixed race, even if they were considered Cherokee by blood within the tribe. The registrars confused appearance with culture. In addition, the Freedmen have argued that the post-Civil War treaties made between the tribes and the US granted them full citizenship in the tribes. The Choctaw Freedmen and Creek Freedmen have similarly struggled with their respective tribes over the terms of citizenship in contemporary times. The tribes have wanted to limit those who can benefit from tribal citizenship, in an era in which gaming casinos are yielding considerable revenues for members. The majority of members of the tribes have voted to limit membership, and as sovereign nations, they have the right to determine their rules. But descendants of freedmen believe their long standing as citizens since the post-Civil War treaties should be continued.

In 2017, the Cherokee Freedmen were granted citizenship again in the tribe. The Cherokee Nation was the first among the five tribes to update its constitution to include the Cherokee Freedmen as full citizens.

In 2018, the US Congress removed the blood quantum requirement for land allotment for the Five Tribes, though it had not been a tribal citizenship requirement. Historian Mark Miller noted:

Even so-called purely &#x27;descendancy&#x27; tribes such as the Five Tribes with no blood quantum requirement jealously guard some proven, documentary link by blood to distant ancestors. More than any single BIA requirement, however, this criterion has proven troublesome for southeastern groups [seeking federal recognition] because of its reliance on non-Indian records and the confused (and confusing) nature of surviving documents.

In July 2021, the Cherokee Freedmen asked Congress to withhold housing assistance money until the Five Civilized Tribes addressed the citizenship status of freedmen&#x27;s descendants. They took this action although the Cherokee Nation had already updated its constitution to end their exclusion of the Cherokee Freedmen as members.

Like other federally-recognized tribes, the Five Tribes have participated in shaping the current BIA Federal Acknowledgment Process for tribes under consideration for such recognition. They are suspicious of groups that claim Indian identity but appear to have no history of culture and community.

==Tribes==

===Cherokee===
The Cherokee, (; ) are people of the Southeastern United States, principally upland Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. They speak an Iroquoian language. In the 19th century, historians and ethnographers recorded their oral tradition that told of the tribe having migrated south in ancient times from the Great Lakes region, the base of most other Iroquoian-speaking peoples.

Of the three federally recognized Cherokee tribes, the Cherokee Nation and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians (UKB) have headquarters in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. The UKB are mostly descendants of &quot;Old Settlers&quot;, Cherokee who migrated to Arkansas and Oklahoma about 1817. They are related to the Cherokee who were forcibly relocated there in the 1830s under the Indian Removal Act. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians is on the Qualla Boundary in western North Carolina, and are descendants of those who resisted or avoided relocation. Although the Cherokee Nation sponsors some satellite communities, it does not recognize Cherokee heritage groups that are seeking federal recognition. The Cherokee tribe has 729,533 enrolled members.

===Chickasaw===
The Chickasaw are Indian people of the United States who originally resided along the Tennessee River and other parts of present-day Tennessee, in the southwest side of present-day Kentucky, west of present-day Huntsville, Alabama, and in parts of Mississippi. They spoke some French and some English. Some historians credit the Chickasaw intervention in the French and Indian War on the side of the British as decisive in ensuring that the United States became an English-speaking nation. Originating further west, the Chickasaw moved east of the Mississippi River long before European contact. All historical records indicate the Chickasaw lived in northeastern Mississippi from the first European contact until they were forced to remove to Oklahoma, where most now live.

The Chickasaw are related to the Choctaw, who speak a similar language, both forming the Western Group of the Muskogean languages. &quot;Chickasaw&quot; is the English spelling of &quot;Chikasha&quot; (), that either means &quot;rebel&quot; or &quot;comes from Chicsa&quot;. The Chickasaw are divided in two groups: the &quot;Impsaktea&quot; and the &quot;Intcutwalipa&quot;. The Chickasaw were one of the &quot;Five Civilized Tribes&quot; who went to the Indian Territory during the era of Indian removal. Unlike other tribes, who exchanged land grants, the Chickasaw received financial compensation from the United States for their lands east of the Mississippi River. The Chickasaw Nation is the thirteenth largest federally recognized tribe in the United States. The Chickasaw built some of the first banks, schools, and businesses in Indian Territory. They also signed a treaty with the Southern United States during the Civil War and brought troops to fight for the Confederates.

===Choctaw===
The Choctaw are Native American people originally from the Southeastern United States, including present-day Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana. There were about 20,000 members of this tribe when they were forced to move to Indian Territory. Many of them did not survive. They are of the Muskogean linguistic group. The word &quot;Choctaw&quot; (also rendered as &quot;Chahta&quot;, &quot;Chato&quot;, &quot;Tchakta&quot;, and &quot;Chocktaw&quot;) is possibly a corruption of the Spanish &quot;chato&quot;, meaning flattened, in allusion to the tribe&#x27;s custom of flattening the heads of infants. Noted anthropologist John Swanton, however, suggests that the name belonged to a Choctaw leader. They were descended from people of the Mississippian culture which was located throughout the Mississippi River Valley. Historians such as Walter Lee Williams have documented some early Spanish explorers encountering chiefs of the Mississippian culture, ancestors of some of the Five Tribes.

Although smaller Choctaw groups are located in the southern region, the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma and the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians are the two primary federally recognized tribes. This people historically cultivated beans, maize, and squash, like other settled Indians. They also hunted and fished for some of their diet. Since the early nineteenth century, the tribe has recovered and increased in number. The federally recognized tribes have about 231,000 members in total, making the Choctaw the third-largest Native American population in the United States. The capital of the Choctaw Nation is in Tuskahoma, Oklahoma.

===Muscogee===
The Muscogee, or Creek, are originally from present-day Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. They resided there from approximately 1500 AD until they were forcibly displaced by the American government in the early 19th century. &quot;Mvskoke&quot; is their name in the Muskogee language. The Muscogee Creek were not one tribe but a confederacy of several, each of which had their own distinct land and sometimes dialects or languages in the Muskogean family.

Starting in 1836, the US government forced them to remove west of the Mississippi along with the other Southeast tribes to what was designated as Indian Territory. About 20,000 Muscogee members were forced to walk the Trail of Tears, the same number as the Choctaw. Modern Muscogee live primarily in Oklahoma, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. Their language, &quot;Mvskoke&quot;, is a member of the Creek branch of the Muskogean language family.

Federally recognized tribes descended from the Creek Confederacy include the Muscogee Creek Nation, Kialegee Tribal Town, and Thlopthlocco Tribal Town in Oklahoma; Poarch Band of Creek Indians in Alabama, and Alabama–Quassarte Tribal Town.

The Seminole people originally included many of Creek origin, but developed as a separate culture, through a process of ethnogenesis, before Indian removal.

===Seminoles===
The Seminoles are a Native American people that developed in present-day Florida. Federally recognized tribes of this people now reside in Oklahoma and Florida.

The Seminole nation came into existence in the late 18th century and was composed of renegade and outcast Native Americans from Georgia, Mississippi, and Alabama, most significantly from among the loose Creek confederacy. They were joined by African Americans who escaped from slavery in South Carolina and Georgia. During Indian removal and the Seminole Wars, roughly 3,000 Seminoles were forced by the U.S. to remove west of the Mississippi River. The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma is made up of their descendants.

But approximately 300 to 500 Seminoles migrated to the Everglades of Florida, where they gained refuge and resisted removal. The US waged two more wars against the Seminoles in Florida in an effort to dislodge them, and about 1,500 US soldiers died. The Seminoles never surrendered to the US government, and consequently the Seminoles of Florida call themselves the &quot;Unconquered People&quot;.

For about twenty years after the move to Indian Territory (Oklahoma), the Seminoles refused to live with the Muscogee Creek tribe or under their government until they finally reached an agreement with the government to sign a treaty and live with them. The Seminoles favored the North during the Civil War and remained loyal to the Union. They moved north into Kansas during the war.

Seminole tribes include the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma and Seminole Tribe of Florida. In addition, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida was part of the Seminole Tribe in that state until 1962, when they gained independent federal recognition as a tribe. They speak the Mikasuki language, also called Seminole and related to Creek, or Muskogee, but the two languages are mutually unintelligible. Ancestors of each of these tribes were among Creek bands in the region in the eighteenth century, but the Seminoles developed an independent culture in Florida.

<text>Lorenzo Ghiberti (, , ; 1378 – 1 December 1455), born Lorenzo di Bartolo, was an Italian Renaissance sculptor from Florence, a key figure in the Early Renaissance, best known as the creator of two sets of bronze doors of the Florence Baptistery, the later one called by Michelangelo the &quot;Gates of Paradise&quot;. Trained as a goldsmith and sculptor, he established an important workshop for sculpture in metal. His book of &quot;Commentarii&quot; contains important writing on art, as well as what may be the earliest surviving autobiography by any artist.

Ghiberti&#x27;s career was dominated by his two successive commissions for pairs of bronze doors to the Florence Baptistery (Battistero di San Giovanni). They are recognized as a major masterpiece of the Early Renaissance, and were famous and influential from their unveiling.

==Early life==

Ghiberti was born in 1378 in Pelago, a comune 20 km from Florence. It is said that Lorenzo was the son of Cione di Ser Buonaccorso Ghiberti and Fiore Ghiberti. However, there is some doubt about whether Cione was Ghiberti&#x27;s actual father. At some point in their marriage, Fiore went to Florence and lived with a goldsmith by the name of Bartolo di Michele. Fiore and Bartolo maintained a common law marriage, so it is unknown who Ghiberti&#x27;s biological father was. There is no documentation of Cione&#x27;s death, but it is known that after his passing Fiore and Bartolo married in 1406. Regardless, Bartolo was the only father Lorenzo knew and they had a close and loving relationship. Bartolo was a clever and popular goldsmith in Florence, and trained Lorenzo in his trade. It was from this apprenticeship that Lorenzo learned the first principles of design.

Lorenzo was interested in many forms of art and did not confine himself to gold-working. He delighted in modeling copies of antique medals and also in painting. Lorenzo received formal training as a painter from Gherardo Starnina. He then went to work in the workshop of his stepfather. When the bubonic plague struck Florence in 1400, Ghiberti moved to Rimini.

In Rimini he was fortunate enough to receive employment by Carlo I Malatesta, where he assisted in the completion of frescoes on the walls of the castle. It is believed that this is where he gained his love for the art of painting. However, shortly after his arrival he received word from his friends back in his home town of Florence that the governors of the Baptistery were holding a competition and sending for masters who were skilled in bronze working. Despite his great appreciation for painting, Ghiberti asked Malatesta for leave. In 1401 he headed back to Florence to participate in a competition that was being held for the commission to make the second pair of bronze doors for the Baptistery of the Cathedral of Florence.

===Florence Baptistery doors===


Ghiberti first became famous when as a 21-year-old he won the 1401 competition for the first set of bronze doors, with Brunelleschi as the runner up. The original plan was for the doors to depict scenes from the Old Testament, but the plan was changed to depict scenes from the New Testament instead. However, the trial piece, which survives, depicts the sacrifice of Isaac.

To carry out this commission, he set up a large workshop in which many artists trained, including Donatello, Masolino, Paolo Uccello, and Antonio del Pollaiuolo. When his first set of twenty-eight panels was complete, Ghiberti was commissioned to produce a second set for another doorway in the church, this time with scenes from the Old Testament, as originally intended for his first set. Instead of twenty-eight scenes, he produced ten rectangular scenes in a completely different style. These were more naturalistic, with perspective and a greater idealization of the subject. Dubbed &quot;The Gates of Paradise&quot; by Michelangelo, this second set remains a major monument of the age of Renaissance humanism.

The &quot;Gates of Paradise&quot; had ten panels with several episodes from a particular story from the Old Testament portrayed on each of them. The list below shows where each story is placed on the Gates of Paradise.

==&quot;Gates of Paradise&quot; multiple descriptive panels==
&lt;br&gt;
The Story of Adam and Eve (Panel)
&lt;br&gt;

In the beginning of Genesis, God created the Universe &quot;(shown on the top of the image)&quot;.
When he created the universe, he created “The Garden of Eden”. This is where he created the first humans Adam and Eve. Adam and Eve are eating an apple from the forbidden tree. Eve was tricked by Lucifer, God&#x27;s fallen angel, the serpent from being told she would be like God if she ate the forbidden fruit &quot;(shown on left middle side)&quot;.
Lucifer, his most beautiful angel, became a fallen angel and the devil &quot;(shown on the bottom left)&quot;.

The Story of Cain and Abel (Panel)

Cain and Abel were the sons of Adam, the first man. Abel was younger than Cain. Out of jealousy, Cain was enraged with God preferring Abel&#x27;s sacrifice over his &quot;(shown at the top of the photograph)&quot;. Abel was known to be peaceful and is sitting calmly with the herd &quot;(shown on the middle left side)&quot;. Cain tricks Abel to follow him and murders him &quot;(shown on the bottom)&quot;.

The Story of Noah (Panel)
&lt;br&gt;
God did not like how the world was full of violence. He told Noah he was going to destroy the earth with a flood and that he needed to build an Ark &quot;(shown by the waves in the photograph)&quot;. He was told to bring two of each kind of animal and his family &quot;(shown on the left, right, and on the middle area)&quot;. There is a Moses laying next to a barrel signifying the drunks &quot;(shown on the bottom left)&quot;. There is Moses offering a sacrifice &quot;(shown on the bottom right)&quot;.

The Story of Abraham (Panel)

Three men came to Abraham. He clothed them, fed them, and gave them drinks. The three men were angels and they revealed themselves as messengers of God &quot;(shown at the bottom left)&quot;. They told him his wife Sarah, who was 80 years old, would bear a child. Once they had the child God order Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, but was ordered to stop by an angel &quot;(shown at the top)&quot;.

The Story of Isaac (Panel)
&lt;br&gt;
Isaac is the son of Abraham. He was going to be sacrificed before an angel stopped Abraham. Jacob is receiving Issac&#x27;s blessing &quot;(shown on the right)&quot;. Rebecca is listening to God tell her of her two sons who will have conflicts &quot;(shown on the rooftop)&quot;.

The Story of Joseph (Panel)
&lt;br&gt;

Joseph&#x27;s father&#x27;s name was Jacob and they lived in Canaan. Joseph was the second youngest of 11 brothers and his father spent more time with him because of it. Jacob had given Joseph a special robe, which his brothers became envious of. Joseph had two dreams he told his brothers about one where they were all killing him and the other was where they were bowing to him. They were enraged and were planning on killing him, but sold him to slavery and being owned by Egypt &quot;(shown at the bottom right)&quot;. Joseph was imprisoned and told people their meaning of their dreams. The Pharaoh sought Joseph to explain his dream. The Pharaoh told Joseph of his dreams of his city becoming low in food resources. Joseph suggest putting food aside each year for the upcoming low harvest &quot;(shown with people having plentiful food)&quot;.

The Story of Moses (Panel)
&lt;br&gt;
Moses was hidden by his birth mother in a basket in the Nile River. The Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter spotted Moses and took him from the basket &quot;(shown on the left with the river and people)&quot;. Moses became a child of the Pharaoh of Egypt. He was born an Israelite and his people were enslaved by people of Egypt. The ten plagues hit Egypt and people are shown to be frightened &quot;(shown by the people on the right)&quot;.

Saul was the king of Israel. God said Saul was not the chosen king to lead God&#x27;s people.
Samuel, a prophet, who was sent by God to search for a new king. David was brought back to Saul like David and had become his armor bearer and had him carry his shield. A war was between Israel and Egypt &quot;(shown throughout the photograph)&quot;. Goliath promised his armies work quit if someone could kill him. David was skilled at killing beast from protecting his sheep, as a herdsman, and hit Goliath with a rock and killed him with his own sword &quot;(shown at the bottom of the photograph)&quot;.

The Story of King Solomon (Panel)
&lt;br&gt;
King Solomon made an alliance with the Pharaoh king of Egypt and married his daughter &quot;(shown in the middle)&quot;. God Solomon any wish.

Two prostitutes came to the king. They both had a baby. One of the babies died. The mother of the dead baby claimed that the live baby was hers. Both women swore the live baby was theirs. King Solomon ordered the baby to be cut in half so they could share the baby. Its mother cried out for mercy on her baby, while the other shamelessly submitted. Solomon rewarded the one who cried out, since he believed she was truly the mother &quot;(shown on the middle left side, behind his wife)&quot;.

===Earlier doors by Andrea Pisano===

As recommended by Giotto, Andrea Pisano was awarded the commission to design the first set of doors at the Florence Baptistery in 1329. The &quot;south doors&quot; were originally installed on the east side facing the Duomo, and were transferred to their present location in 1452. These proto-Renaissance doors consist of 28 quatrefoil panels, with the twenty top panels depicting scenes from the life of St. John the Baptist. The eight lower panels depict eight virtues: hope, faith, charity, humility, fortitude, temperance, justice, and prudence. Pisano took six years to complete them, finishing in 1336. In 1453, Ghiberti and his son Vittorio were commissioned to add a door case to Pisano&#x27;s existing panels. Ghiberti died in 1455, eight years before the frame was finished leaving a majority of the work to Vittorio and other members of his workshop. There is a Latin inscription on top of the door: &quot;Andreas Ugolini Nini de Pisis me fecit A.D. MCCCXXX&quot; (Andrea Pisano made me in 1330). The South Doors were undergoing restoration during September, 2016.

===1401 competition===
In 1401, the Arte di Calimala (Cloth Importers Guild) announced a competition to design doors that eventually would be placed on the &quot;north side&quot; of the baptistry. The original location for these doors was the east side of the baptistry, but the doors were moved to the north side of the baptistry after Ghiberti completed his second commission, known as the &quot;Gates of Paradise&quot;.

These new doors would serve as a votive offering to celebrate Florence being spared from relatively recent scourges such as the Black Death in 1348. Each participant was given four tables of brass, and was required to make a relief of the “Sacrifice of Isaac” on a piece of metal that was the size and shape of the door panels. Each artist was given a year to prepare their panel, and the artist who was judged the best was to be given the commission. While many artists competed for this commission the jury selected only seven semifinalists which included Ghiberti, Filippo Brunelleschi, Simone da Colle, Francesco di Val d’Ombrino, Niccolo d’ Arezzo, Jacopo della Quercia da Siena, and Niccolo Lamberti. In 1402 at the time of judging, only Ghiberti and Brunelleschi were finalists, and when the judges could not decide, they were assigned to work together on them. Brunelleschi&#x27;s pride got in the way, and he went to Rome to study architecture, thereby leaving the then 21-year-old Ghiberti to work on the doors himself. Ghiberti&#x27;s autobiography, however, claimed that he had won, &quot;without a single dissenting voice.&quot; The original designs of &quot;The Sacrifice of Isaac&quot; by Ghiberti and Brunelleschi are on display in the museum of the Bargello in Florence. Differences between the &quot;Sacrifice of Isaac&quot; created by Brunelleschi and Ghiberti include the way that the panel was constructed and the overall efficiency of the panel. Brunelleschi&#x27;s panel consisted of individual pieces of the figures of the artwork being placed onto the bronze framework. In contrast to Brunelleschi&#x27;s method of creating the artwork on his panel, Ghiberti&#x27;s casting of the art had all of the figures, with the exception of Isaac, created as one piece. The pieces of the figures themselves were all hollowed out on the inside. Due to the methods of how Ghiberti made the panel, it ended up being stronger, used less bronze, and had less weight than Brunelleschi&#x27;s panel. By using less bronze, the panels were also more cost efficient. Including the aspect of the art itself, these differences were included on how the council of the competition decided on the victor.

==== After the competition ====
After the competition, Ghiberti&#x27;s father Bartolo assisted him greatly in perfecting the design of his door before it was cast. This commission brought immediate and lasting recognition to the young artist. In 1403 the formal contract was signed with Bartolo di Michele&#x27;s workshop, the same workshop he had previously been trained in, and overnight it became the most prestigious in Florence. Four years later in 1407, Lorenzo legally took over the commission and was prohibited from accepting additional commissions. He devoted much of his time to creating the gates, and was paid two-hundred florins a year for his work. To cast the doors, Lorenzo worked in a studio named the Aja or Threshing floor. The studio was located near the Hospital of Saint Maria Nuova, the oldest hospital that is still active in Florence today. At the Aja, Ghiberti built a large furnace to melt his metal in an attempt to cast the doors, however his first model was a failure. After this trial, he attempted once more to make a mold. On his second try he was successful and ended up using 34,000 pounds of bronze, costing a total of 22,000 ducats. This was a large sum in this time period.

It took Ghiberti 21 years to complete the doors. These gilded bronze doors consist of twenty-eight panels, with twenty panels depicting the life of Christ from the New Testament, and on April 19, 1424 they were placed on the side of the Baptistery. Twenty panels showing the life of Christ from the New Testament are depicted: the &quot;Annunciation, Nativity, Adoration of the Magi, Dispute with the Doctors, Baptism of Christ, Temptation of Christ, Chasing the Merchants Away, Christ Walking on Water, Transfiguration, Resurrection of Lazarus,&quot; &quot;Christ’s Arrival in Jerusalem, Last Supper, Agony in the Garden, Christ Being Captured, Flagellation, Christ on Trial with Pilate, Trip to Calvary, Crucifixion, Resurrection, and Pentecost.&quot; The eight lower panels show the four evangelists and the Church Fathers: Saint Ambrose, Saint Jerome, Saint Gregory and Saint Augustine. The panels are surrounded by a framework of foliage in the door case and gilded busts of prophets and sibyls at the intersections of the panels. Originally installed on the east side in place of Pisano&#x27;s doors, they were later moved to the north side. They are described by the art historian Antonio Paolucci as &quot;the most important event in the history of Florentine art in the first quarter of the fifteenth century&quot;.

The bronze statues over the northern gate depict &quot;John the Baptist preaching to a Pharisee and Sadducee&quot; and were sculpted by Francesco Rustici. Rustici may have been aided in his design by Leonardo da Vinci, who assisted him in the choice of his tools.

==== After completion of the doors ====
After the completion of these doors, Ghiberti was widely recognized as a celebrity and the top artist in this field. He was given many commissions, including some from the pope. In 1425 he got a second commission for the Florence Baptistery, this time for the &quot;east doors&quot;, on which he and his workshop (including Michelozzo and Benozzo Gozzoli) toiled for 27 years, excelling themselves. The subjects of the designs for the doors were chosen by Leonardo Bruni d&#x27;Arezzo, then chancellor of the Republic of Florence. They have ten panels depicting scenes from the Old Testament, and were in turn installed on the east side. The panels are large rectangles and were no longer embedded in the traditional Gothic quatrefoil, as in the previous doors. Ghiberti employed the recently discovered principles of perspective to give depth to his compositions. Each panel depicts more than one episode. &quot;The Story of Joseph&quot; portrays the narrative scheme of &quot;Joseph Cast by His Brethren into the Well&quot;, &quot;Joseph Sold to the Merchants&quot;, &quot;The merchants delivering Joseph to the pharaoh&quot;, &quot;Joseph Interpreting the Pharaoh&#x27;s dream&quot;, &quot;The Pharaoh Paying him Honour&quot;, &quot;Jacob Sends His Sons to Egypt&quot; and &quot;Joseph Recognizes His Brothers and Returns Home&quot;. According to Vasari&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot;, this panel was the most difficult and also the most beautiful. The figures are distributed in very low relief in a perspective space (a technique invented by Donatello and called &quot;rilievo schiacciato&quot;, which literally means &quot;flattened relief&quot;). Ghiberti uses different sculptural techniques, from incised lines to almost free-standing figure sculpture within the panels, further accentuating the sense of space.

The panels are included in a richly decorated gilt framework of foliage and fruit, with many statuettes of prophets and 24 busts. The two central busts are portraits of the artist and of his father, Bartolomeo Ghiberti.

The &quot;Annunciation&quot; panel portrays the scene with an angel dressed in robe, wings, and a trumpet appearing to Mary, which was shown in an expression of shock leaving a doorway. The &quot;Nativity&quot; panel depicts the birth of Christ with an ox, a donkey, Joseph and Mary, an angel, and the shepherds. All the characters in the panel are all depicted near a cave while all but Mary are showing reverence towards her. The &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; panel shows the three magi giving praise to Christ and Mary, with Joseph and angels in the background. In the &quot;Christ Among the Doctors&quot; panel, Christ is depicted as a child sitting upon a throne-like chair surrounded by the doctors in discussion with him. The narrative of the doctors being shocked of how intelligently Christ spoke is demonstrated by how all the doctors are speaking to each other in intense discussion around Christ. The &quot;Baptism of Christ&quot; panel, Christ is shown surrounded by spectators, a dove, and his cousin, John the Baptist, being baptized in a river. The background includes intensely detailed trees with leaves, rocks, and a flowing river. The &quot;Temptation of Christ&quot; panel is shown with Christ surrounded by angels while facing the fallen angel, Satan, standing upon rocks. Satan is depicted as a human with bat-like wings and robes. The &quot;Chasing the Merchants Away&quot; panel depicts the scene with by Christ pushing away a group of merchants with his fists raised inside the temple. The temple in the background is depicted by columns and arches with complex designs, the merchants are also shown holding goods while being pushed away. The &quot;Christ Walking on Water&quot; panel displays Jesus standing on water and the disciples at sea while Peter is drowning. The panel shows a ship detailed with sails shown to have the individual ropes from the mast as well as the ship itself having artistic designs. The ocean is also detailed with the waves flowing and where Jesus stands on the water, it bends down to show him standing on it. The &quot;Transfiguration&quot; panel shows Jesus standing with the prophets Moses and Elijah over his disciples Peter, James, and John. The awe of the three disciples are expressed by them being on the ground and looking away from Christ and the prophets. The &quot;Raising of Lazarus&quot; panel shows Lazarus leaving his tomb being surrounded by Christ, his sisters, and disciples. The awe of the sisters of Lazarus are shown by one of them on the ground and the other grabbing Lazarus while kneeling. The &quot;Entry into Jerusalem&quot; panel shows Christ riding upon a donkey being greeted by a large crowd with the gates of Jerusalem in the background. Each individual of the crowd has a distinct face with different hairstyles and clothes. The &quot;Last Supper&quot; panel shows the well known scene in the New Testament of Christ eating with the twelve disciples. The background is decorated grapes on the columns and drapes in the background while Christ is at the head of the table and the disciples sitting in unison. The &quot;Agony in the Garden&quot; panel shows Christ praying towards an angle and disciples sleeping behind him. The imagery of the garden is detailed with highly detailed bushes, rocks, and trees. The &quot;Christ Being Captured&quot; panel shows Christ being marked by Judas to be arrested by the Roman soldiers while disciples are struggling against the soldier. The soldiers each have individualized armor and weapons like a spear, axe, and a sword. The &quot;Flagellation&quot; panel depicts Jesus being flogged by the Roman soldiers holding rods in a swinging motion. The &quot;Crucifixion&quot; panel of the North Doors depicts the scene with Mary and John at the foot of the cross mourning with angels next to Christ hanging. Mary is shown to be in mourning with her looking down away from the cross. Although the overall quality of the casting is considered exquisite, there are some known mistakes. For example, in panel 15 of the North Doors (&quot;Flagellation&quot;) the casting of the second column in the front row has been overlaid over an arm, so that one of the flagellators appears trapped in stone, with his hand sticking out of it.

Michelangelo referred to these doors as fit to be the &quot;Gates of Paradise&quot; (It. &quot;Porte del Paradiso&quot;), and they are still invariably referred to by this name. Giorgio Vasari described them a century later as &quot;undeniably perfect in every way and must rank as the finest masterpiece ever created&quot;. Ghiberti himself said they were &quot;the most singular work that I have ever made&quot;.

== The bronze statues for Orsanmichele ==
=== St. John the Baptist ===
The St. John The Baptist statue sits in a niche of the Orsanmichele in Florence was built from 1412–-1416. This statue based on the St. John the Baptist.
Ghiberti&#x27;s masterpiece was commissioned by the Arte di Calimala guild, which was the wool merchants guild. They were one of the wealthiest in Florence.
This statue was a technological advance for its time. Ghiberti had incredible casting skill to be able to bond this 8’ 4” statue made of bronze.
Ghiberti&#x27;s statue was influenced by the gothic style in Italy, shown by the elegant curves from the sword and drapery.

=== St. Matthew ===
This statue was commissioned by the Arte del Cambio, the bankers guild and executed by Ghiberti between 1419–-1423.
The Saint Matthew statue reaches a height of 8’ 10” of bronze. It is also located in a niche in the Orsanmichele in Florence.
The guild specified they wanted their statue as tall or taller than the St. John the Baptist statue.

=== St. Stephen ===
St. Stephen for the Arte della Lana (Wool Manufacturers&#x27; Guild)

== Later life, family, and death ==
By 1417 Lorenzo Ghiberti was married to Marsila, the 16- year-old daughter of Bartolommeo di Lucca, a worthy comb-maker. Together they had two sons. In 1417 they had Tommaso Ghiberti, and a year later they had Vittorio Ghiberti. Ghiberti was wealthier than most of his contemporary artists, with his success bringing him great financial rewards. A surviving tax return of 1427 shows he owned a considerable amount of land both in Florence and outside the city. He also had a substantial amount of money invested in government bonds to his credit. Over the years, his real estate and monetary holdings continued to grow. While in Florence, Ghiberti, aged seventy-five, succumbed to a fever of unknown cause and was buried in the Basilica di Santa Croce on December 1, 1455.

Vittorio followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a goldsmith and bronze-caster, but never rose to great fame. Later, he had a son in which he named Buonaccorso who followed the (grand)paternal art. However, Buonaccorso had a different spin on his grandfather&#x27;s work, with his metal castings taking the form of artillery and cannonballs. His manufacture of these weapons made him famous, mainly for supplying the wars of Sarzana and Pisa. Vittorio shares the burial spot in the Santa Croce with his father. Their gravestone mentions them both, with its inscription honoring Lorenzo&#x27;s &quot;Battistero&quot; doors design, and Vittorio&#x27;s ornamental work on Andrea da Pisa&#x27;s doors (in addition to &#x27;being a very worthy aid&#x27; to his father).

Tommaso did join his father&#x27;s business, helping as a collaborator with Lorenzo&#x27;s assistants. After his father&#x27;s death it is unknown if he continued in the business, as he is not mentioned in any of the documents after 1447.

== Other works ==
He was also a collector of classical artifacts and a historian. He was actively involved in the spreading of humanist ideas. His unfinished &quot;Commentarii&quot; are a valuable source of information about Renaissance art and contains what is considered the first autobiography of an artist. This work was a major source for Vasari&#x27;s &quot;Vite&quot;.

Ghiberti&#x27;s &quot;Commentario&quot; includes the earliest known surviving autobiography of an artist. He discusses the development of art from the time of Cimabue through to his own work. In describing his second bronze portal for the Florence Baptistry, he states: &quot;In this work I sought to imitate nature as closely as possible, both in proportions and in perspective... the buildings appear as seen by the eye of one who gazes on them from a distance.&quot; The language Ghiberti used to describe his art has proved invaluable to art historians in understanding the aims Renaissance artists were striving for in their artworks.

Paolo Uccello, who was commonly regarded as the first great master of perspective, worked in Ghiberti&#x27;s workshop for several years, making it difficult to determine the extent to which Uccello&#x27;s innovations in perspective were due to Ghiberti&#x27;s instruction. Donatello, known for one of the first examples of central-point perspective in sculpture, also worked briefly in Ghiberti&#x27;s workshop. It was also about this time that Paolo began his lifelong friendship with Donatello. In about 1413 one of Ghiberti&#x27;s contemporaries, Filippo Brunelleschi, demonstrated the geometrical method of perspective used today by artists, by painting the outlines of various Florentine buildings onto a mirror. When the building&#x27;s outline was continued, he noticed that all of the lines converged on the horizon line.

Recent scholarship indicates that in his work on perspective, Ghiberti was influenced by the Arab polymath Alhazen who had written about the optical basis of perspective in the early eleventh century. His &quot;Book of Optics&quot; was translated into Italian in the fourteenth century as &quot;Deli Aspecti&quot;, and was quoted at length in Ghiberti&#x27;s &quot;Commentario terzo.&quot; Author A. Mark Smith suggests that, through Ghiberti, Alhazen&#x27;s &quot;Book of Optics&quot; &quot;may well have been central to the development of artificial perspective in early Renaissance Italian painting.&quot;

<doc id="160938" wikidata="Q712833" url="?curid=160938" title="Tony Canzoneri">
<text>Tony Canzoneri (November 6, 1908 – December 9, 1959) was an American professional boxer. A three-division world champion, he held a total of five world titles. Canzoneri is a member of the exclusive group of boxing world champions who have won titles in three or more divisions. Canzoneri fought for championships between bantamweight and light welterweight. Historian Bert Sugar ranked Canzoneri as the twelfth-greatest fighter of all time.

==Early life==
Canzoneri was born in Slidel, LA. By the time he was 11 in 1920, the family had moved to Johnston City, Illinois. In 1925, when he was 18, he lived in the Bedford–Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn (his occupation in the 1925 New York census is listed as &quot;prize fighter&quot;). The 1930 U.S. census shows the family in Marlboro, New York. In 1940 he was living on the Upper West Side, and the census indicates he had lived there since at least 1935. Although Staten Island claims him, no records seem to exist of his residence there. Staten Island, New York, although he may have campaigned most of his career there.

Canzoneri fit the mould of the typical American boxer of the era: He could box up to three or four times in one month and up to 24 or 25 times in one year, and he would seldom fight outside New York City, considered to be boxing&#x27;s mecca at the time. Of his first 38 bouts, only one was fought west of New York City, and was in New Jersey. His first professional fight and win was against Jack Gardner in July 27, 1925. Canzoneri claimed he got the first knockout scored in the new Madison Square Garden in a bout against Danny Terris on December 23 of the same year.

==Professional career==
===Two-division world champion===
Canzoneri won his first title, the World Featherweight title, with a 15-round decision over Benny Bass on February 10, 1928. He defended the title once and then went up in weight and challenged World Lightweight Champion Sammy Mandell, losing by a decision in ten rounds. In 1930, Mandell was knocked out in the first round by Al Singer and lost his title and Canzoneri, who had already beaten Singer by a ten-round decision before, challenged Singer for the title on November 14, 1930, knocking him out in the first round to become a two division world champion. In defeat, Singer made history by becoming the first man, and only man up until John Mugabi, to both win and lose the title by knockout in the first round.

===Three-division world champion===
Canzoneri&#x27;s first defense was a unification of sorts: He faced World Light Welterweight champion Jack Kid Berg, who was putting his title on the line and trying to take Canzoneri&#x27;s lightweight crown. Canzoneri became a three-division world champion by knocking Berg out in the third round on April 24, 1931. Canzoneri, Barney Ross and Henry Armstrong were the only boxing champions in history allowed to hold two or more world titles simultaneously. (Sugar Ray Leonard became both the vacant World Super Middleweight and the World Light Heavyweight Champion in one night in 1988, but he could keep only one and chose to keep the Super Middleweight title.)

===Regaining the light welterweight title===
Canzoneri lost his world Light Welterweight Championship to Johnny Jadick and he lost to Jadick again in a rematch. Meanwhile, Canzoneri kept retaining his lightweight belt, defending it against the likes of Billy Petrolle and his brother Frankie Petrolle.

Jadick lost his belt to Battling Shaw and Canzoneri once again challenged for the World Light Welterweight title while keeping his Lightweight title. He beat Shaw by decision and recovered the world Light Welterweight Championship. In his next bout, versus Ross, he lost both belts when Ross beat him by a ten-round decision. There was an immediate rematch and Ross won again, this time by decision in 15.

===Regaining the lightweight title===
On May 10, 1935, he fought for the world lightweight title against Lou Ambers. Canzoneri won the World Lightweight title by outpointing Ambers over 15 rounds. After successfully defending his Lightweight title once, he lost it again in a rematch with Ambers by a 15-round decision. There was a rubber match between the two and Ambers once again won a decision in 15 rounds.

===Later career===
Canzoneri went on boxing professionally until 1939, but he never again challenged for a world title. Among other world champions that he beat were Frankie Klick, Baby Arizmendi, Jimmy McLarnin and Kid Chocolate.

Canzoneri had a record of 137 wins, 24 losses, 10 draws and 3 no decisions (Newspaper Decisions: 4-0-0). During his era, many states and countries still had no scoring on boxing fights, so each time a fight would go the scheduled number of rounds without a knockout, no decision would be made as to the winner. Newspapers, however, would fill this gap, giving their own opinion of which boxer had won the fight. He had 44 knockouts, and only one loss by knockout. Canzoneri was managed by Sammy Goldman.

He died of a heart attack in Manhattan at the age of 51. He is a member of the International Boxing Hall Of Fame.

<doc id="160945" wikidata="Q460146" url="?curid=160945" title="Kate Markgraf">
<text>Kathryn Michele Markgraf (; born August 23, 1976) is the former General Manager of the United States women&#x27;s national soccer team and a retired American professional soccer defender. She previously played for the Chicago Red Stars in the WPS, the Boston Breakers in the WUSA, and the United States women&#x27;s national soccer team. She was a three-time Olympic medalist (2000, silver; 2004, gold; 2008, gold as team co-captain) and played in three FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup (1999, gold; 2003, bronze; 2007, bronze) tournaments. She started in 97% of her 201 United States Women&#x27;s National Team appearances in her 12-year career. She ended her career with a high school championship, state club championship, NCAA Division I championship, Olympic gold medals, and a FIFA World Cup Championship.

In 2023, she was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Markgraf was born in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan and attended Detroit Country Day School. At Detroit Country Day, she helped guide the soccer team to the state title in 1991, scoring 16 goals with 26 assists. She was also a volleyball player making the All-League team three times and was recruited at the Division III level. In soccer, she made the NSCAA All-American team one time and was chosen for the All-State team for all three seasons she played.

===University of Notre Dame===
Markgraf attended the University of Notre Dame and graduated with a degree in Science-Business. She was a three-time NSCAA All-American, a three-time all Big East selection, the 1997 Big East defensive player of the year, and the defensive MVP of the NCAA&#x27;s Final Four in 1995, the year in which her team won the NCAA women&#x27;s soccer championship. She also co-captained the team her senior year. She also earned Dean&#x27;s List for one semester.

==Playing career==

===Club, 2001–2010===
Markgraf was a member of the Boston Breakers in the WUSA league for three seasons, and she was named defender of the year for the Breakers in 2001. In 2005, she played professionally for KIF Örebro in the Swedish league alongside longtime USA teammate Kristine Lilly. She was scheduled to play with the Chicago Red Stars in the WUSA&#x27;s successor, Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer, in its inaugural 2009 season. However, the Red Stars announced in January 2009 that she would not play that season because she was expecting her second child. Ten months after giving birth to twins, she returned to the Red Stars in 2010, played nearly every minute of the season, and made the All-Star team. 2010 was her final professional season.

===International, 1998–2010===
In 1998, she made her international debut for the United States against Argentina, with Sobrero on the back of her jersey. She switched to Markgraf on the back of her jersey in 2004. She was the least experienced starter in the winning 1999 World Cup team and one of the youngest members of the team. The LA Times selected her to the All-World top 11 for her play at centerback that tournament. She started in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the 2004 Games in Athens, and was Co-Captain for the 2008 Games in Beijing. She won the silver medal in 2000, the gold in 2004, and the gold in 2008. She played 12 matches in 3 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, winning the title of World Champion in the 1999 World Cup hosted by the US. She was also a member of the teams that finished third in the 2003 World Cup hosted by the US and the 2007 World Cup hosted by China.

In July 2010, after nearly a two-year break from international competition, she made her 200th career international appearance, in a friendly match against Sweden. She became the 10th woman in FIFA history to earn her 200th cap, a mark no male player has reached. She subsequently announced her retirement from the sport at the end of the WPS season, ending her professional career after playing 201 times for her country.

====International goals====

==Broadcasting==
Markgraf was paired with Adrian Healey as a color commentator on ESPN&#x27;s secondary broadcast team for the telecasts of the 2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. She worked as a color commentator for NBC during the 2012 London Olympics and 2016 Rio Olympics. She has also worked as commentator for several US women&#x27;s national team games on Fox Soccer and ESPN, as well as for college soccer on the Big Ten Network. She worked for ESPN FC during the 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup as a studio analyst and often appeared on SportsCenter during the tournament. She continued to work for ESPN in 2016, this time as a color analyst for men&#x27;s soccer during the UEFA Euro 2016.

In 2012, Kate Markgraf traveled with Tony Sanneh to Ethiopia on behalf of the United States Department of State and US Soccer to work with Somalian youth in the Ethiopian city of Dire Dawa. In 2013, she went to Chile, and in 2014, she went to Peru, again on behalf of the United States Department of State and US Soccer.

==Coaching career==
In 2009, she was a volunteer assistant coach of the Marquette Golden Eagles. She now only coaches her twins&#x27; soccer team.

==Personal life==
She is a mother of three kids, a son named Keegan in September 2006 and a set of twins, a girl Carson and a boy Xavier, in the summer of 2009. As of 2008, Markgraf lived with her husband and their children in the Milwaukee area. She has served on the Juvenile Law Center Board and is a member of the Notre Dame Monogram Club Board of Directors, as well as co-sponsored Milwaukee College Prep (MCP; a charter school), a fundraiser benefiting under-served Milwaukee students. She has co-created life-skills programming for Milwaukee America-Scores and runs soccer clinics for various charities. In 2015, she graduated with a Masters in Kinesiology from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee with her research being selected to be presented at the Association for Applied Sport Psychology.

==Career==
===Acting career===
Pratt began acting at age eight, appearing in commercials for an interactive computer game and Nike. In 1997, she appeared in an episode of &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; titled &quot;The Neighborhood&quot;, in which she portrayed Kyla Jarvis, a ten-year-old girl who miraculously recovers after accidentally being shot in a drive-by shooting in her gang-ridden neighborhood, and reveals that she saw heaven where she met a guardian angel who gives her an important mission from God. With Walker&#x27;s help, Kyla Jarvis spreads the angel message of faith and love, uniting her local community into helping clean up their neighborhood and end the gang violence plaguing it. She appeared in an episode of &quot;Friends&quot;, followed by roles in &quot;Smart Guy&quot;, &quot;Sister, Sister&quot;, &quot;Family Matters&quot;, &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;, &quot;Moesha&quot;, and &quot;The Parkers&quot;.

In 2001, she won the role of Breanna Barnes in the UPN series &quot;One on One&quot; (2001–2006). During the run of &quot;One on One&quot;, Pratt also voiced Penny Proud, the lead character in the Disney Channel animated series &quot;The Proud Family&quot;. She later voiced the character for &quot;The Proud Family Movie&quot; in 2005. In addition to television roles, Pratt has appeared in several feature films, including &quot;Love &amp; Basketball&quot; (2000) and &quot;Fat Albert&quot; (2004). She played Maya Dolittle in &quot;Dr. Dolittle&quot; (1998) and &quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot; (2001), both of which starred Eddie Murphy, and reprised her role as Maya Dolittle (now the lead character) in the direct-to-DVD releases of &quot;Dr. Dolittle 3&quot; (2006), &quot;Dr. Dolittle: Tail to the Chief&quot; (2008), and &quot;Dr. Dolittle: Million Dollar Mutts&quot; (2009).

In February 2014, Pratt was voted #97 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Child Stars. In June 2014, she starred alongside Jessica Sula in a Freeform pilot called &quot;Recovery Road&quot; based on Blake Nelson&#x27;s novel of the same name. The show debuted on Freeform in January 2016, but was cancelled shortly afterwards, in May 2016.

In 2024, Pratt starred in the film adaptation of &quot;The Memo: What Women of Color Need to Know to Secure a Seat at the Table&quot; by Minda Harts. The psychological thriller film, titled &quot;The Memo&quot;, was produced by Valeisha Butterfield’s Seed Media.

As a member of the Disney Channel Circle of Stars, Pratt performed a cover version of &quot;Circle of Life&quot; that appeared on the &quot;DisneyMania 2&quot; album. She sang &quot;It&#x27;s All About Me&quot;, for the series soundtrack for &quot;The Proud Family&quot;, and &quot;A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes&quot; with the Disney Channel Stars.

<doc id="160949" wikidata="Q216108" url="?curid=160949" title="BBC Two">
<text>BBC Two is a British free-to-air public broadcast television channel owned and operated by the BBC. It is the corporation&#x27;s second flagship channel, and it covers a wide range of subject matter, incorporating genres such as comedy, drama and documentaries. BBC Two has a remit &quot;to broadcast programmes of depth and substance&quot; in contrast to the more mainstream and popular BBC One.

Like the BBC&#x27;s other domestic TV and radio channels, it is funded by the television licence, and is therefore free of commercial advertising. It is a comparatively well-funded public-service channel, regularly attaining a much higher audience share than most public-service channels worldwide.

Originally styled BBC2, it was the third British television station to be launched (starting on 21 April 1964), and from 1 July 1967, Europe&#x27;s first television channel to broadcast regularly in colour. It was envisaged as a home for less mainstream and more ambitious programming, and while this tendency has continued to date, most special-interest programmes of a kind previously broadcast on BBC Two, for example the BBC Proms, now tend to appear on BBC Four instead.

==History==
===Launch===
British television at the time of BBC2&#x27;s launch consisted of two channels: the BBC Television Service and the ITV network made up of smaller regional companies. Both channels had existed in a state of competition since ITV&#x27;s launch in 1955, and both had aimed for a populist approach in response. The 1962 Pilkington Report on the future of broadcasting noticed this, and that ITV lacked any culturally relevant programming. It therefore decided that Britain&#x27;s third television station should be awarded to the BBC.

Prior to its launch, the new BBC2 was promoted on the BBC Television Service: the soon-to-be-renamed BBC1. The animated adverts featured the campaign mascots &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, a mother kangaroo, and &quot;Custard&quot;, her joey. Prior to, and several years after, the channel&#x27;s formal launch, the channel broadcast &quot;Trade Test Transmissions&quot;, short films made externally by companies such as Shell and BP, which served to enable engineers to test reception, but became cult viewing.

The channel was scheduled to begin at 19:20 on 20 April 1964, showing an evening of light entertainment, starting with the comedy show &quot;The Alberts&quot;, a performance from Soviet comedian Arkady Raikin, and a production of Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;, culminating with a fireworks display. However, at around 18:45 a huge power failure, originating from a fire at Battersea Power Station, caused Television Centre, and indeed much of west London, to lose all power. BBC1 was able to continue broadcasting via its facilities at Alexandra Palace, but all attempts to show the scheduled programmes on the new channel failed. Associated-Rediffusion, the London weekday ITV franchise-holder, offered to transmit on the BBC&#x27;s behalf, but their gesture was rejected. At 22:00 programming was officially postponed until the following morning. As the BBC&#x27;s news centre at Alexandra Palace was unaffected, they did in fact broadcast brief bulletins on BBC2 that evening, beginning with an announcement by the newsreader Gerald Priestland at around 19:25. There was believed to be no recording made of this bulletin, but a videotape was discovered in early 2003.

By 11:00 on 21 April 1964, power had been restored to the studios and programming began, thus making &quot;Play School&quot; the first programme to be shown officially on the channel. The launch schedule, postponed from the night before, was then successfully shown that evening, albeit with minor changes. In reference to the power cut, the transmission opened with a shot of a lit candle which was then sarcastically blown out by presenter Denis Tuohy.

To establish the new channel&#x27;s identity and draw viewers to it, the BBC decided that a widely promoted, lavish series would be essential in its earliest days. The production chosen was &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; (1967), a no-expense-spared adaptation of the novels by John Galsworthy, featuring well-established actors Kenneth More and Eric Porter. Critically for the future of the fledgling channel, the BBC&#x27;s gamble was hugely successful, with an average of six million viewers per episode: a feat made more prominent by the fact that only 9 million were able to receive the channel at the time. In 1974, BBC2&#x27;s widely acclaimed singer-songwriter series, &quot;In Concert&quot;, was lauded by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as the only British music television program that &quot;produced television ideas&quot;.

===Technological advancements===
Unlike BBC1 and ITV, BBC2 was broadcast only on the 625-line UHF system, so was not available to viewers still using sets only capable of receiving the 405-line VHF system. This created a market for dual standard receivers which could switch between the two systems. Set manufacturers increased production of UHF sets in anticipation of a large market demand for the new BBC2, but the market did not materialise.

The early technical problems, which included being unable to transmit US-recorded videotapes due to a lack of system conversion from the US NTSC system, were resolved by a committee headed by James Redmond, although this problem was not unique to BBC2.

On 1 July 1967, during the Wimbledon Championships, BBC2 became the first channel in Europe to begin regular broadcasts in colour, using the PAL system. The thirteen-part series &quot;&quot; (1969) was created as a celebration of two millennia of western art and culture to showpiece the new colour technology. BBC1 and ITV later joined BBC2 on 625-line UHF band but continued to simulcast on 405-line VHF until 1985. BBC1 and ITV simultaneously introduced PAL colour on UHF on 15 November 1969, although they both had broadcast some programmes in colour &quot;unofficially&quot; since September 1969.

In 1979, the station&#x27;s adoption of the first computer-generated channel identification (ident) in Britain, with its use of the double striped, orange &#x27;2&#x27; logo, heralded the start of computer-generated logos. The ident, created in-house by BBC engineers, lasted until March 1986. 

As the switch to digital-only terrestrial transmission progressed, BBC Two was (in each region in turn) the first analogue TV channel to be replaced with the BBC multiplex, at first four, then two weeks ahead of the other four channels. This was required for those relay transmitters that had no current Freeview service giving viewers time to purchase the equipment unless they had already selected a satellite or cable service. The last region for BBC Two to end on analogue terrestrial television was Northern Ireland on 10 October 2012.

At the 2012 Edinburgh International Television Festival, BBC Two was named &quot;Terrestrial Channel of the Year&quot;.

A high-definition simulcast of BBC Two began broadcasting on 26 March 2013, replacing the standalone BBC HD channel. , there are three variations of BBC Two HD (Wales, Northern Ireland, and England).

==Operation==
The channel controllers have been:
* 1964–1965: Michael Peacock
* 1965–1969: David Attenborough
* 1969–1974: Robin Scott
* 1974–1978: Aubrey Singer
* 1978–1982: Brian Wenham
* 1982–1987: Graeme MacDonald
* 1987–1992: Alan Yentob
* 1992–1996: Michael Jackson
* 1996–1999: Mark Thompson
* 1999–2004: Jane Root
* 2004–2008: Roly Keating
* 2008–2014: Janice Hadlow
* 2014: Adam Barker (acting)
* 2014–2016: Kim Shillinglaw
* 2016–2022: Patrick Holland

Adam Barker served as Acting Controller of the channel after Janice Hadlow left the channel in March 2014 and until Kim Shillinglaw began as the new permanent occupant of the post.

From 2013, the Controller of BBC Two was given the expanded title Controller of BBC Two and BBC Four, with ultimate oversight of the BBC Four service added to their duties (a BBC Four &quot;Channel Editor&quot;, reporting up to this Controller, was allocated day-to-day operational control of Four).

The channel forms part of the BBC Television executive group and is answerable to the head of that department, and to the BBC Board.

On 20 January 2016, Kim Shillinglaw announced that she had decided to leave the BBC as the Controller of BBC Two &amp; BBC Four; as a result of the reorganisation, the posts of Controller of BBC Two and BBC Four were closed.

Patrick Holland became Channel Controller of BBC Two in March 2017, following his earlier appointment as Channel Editor in July 2016.

==Programming==

BBC Two&#x27;s historical scope was arts, culture, some comedy and drama, and appealing to audiences not already served by BBC One or ITV. Over its first thirty or so years the channel developed a reputation for screening highly praised and prestigious drama series, among these &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot; (1982), 1991&#x27;s highly successful &quot;The Men&#x27;s Room&quot;, the costume drama &quot;Middlemarch&quot; (1994) or 1996&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot;. The channel&#x27;s &quot;highbrow&quot; profile is also in part attributable to a long history of demanding documentaries of all types, beginning with &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot; in the 1960s. Like the early Channel 4, BBC Two also established for itself a reputation as a champion of independent and international cinema, under the &quot;Screen 2&quot; brand.

The channel has sometimes been judged, increasingly in more recent years, to have moved away from this original role and closer to the mainstream. Since the launch of the digital-only BBC Four, the BBC has been accused in particular of shifting its more highbrow output to the new channel, which, until the end of the UK&#x27;s digital TV switchover in October 2012, a minority (7.5% in the final quarter of 2010) of viewers did not receive. BBC Four&#x27;s remit is very similar to the earlier remit of BBC2, and contains many documentaries and arts programmes. It has been perceived by some that this strategy is to allow BBC Two to show more popular programmes and to secure higher ratings. Since 2004 there have been some signs of an attempt to return closer to parts of BBC Two&#x27;s earlier output with the arts strand &quot;The Culture Show&quot;. Its most popular programme at the moment is &quot;Top Gear&quot;, which now moved to BBC One.

Much of BBC Two&#x27;s output has previously or subsequently been shown on other channels. Some of these programmes are repeats of popular or flagship programmes from BBC Four in a late-night strand, originally called &quot;BBC Four on Two&quot; but now unbranded. Other programmes are moved to the channel as a result of their success on BBC Three or Four, so that subsequent series are well received. An example of this is the BBC Three series &quot;Torchwood&quot;, which was transferred to the channel following the success of the first series. BBC Two is also used as a testing ground for programmes prior to their moving to the flagship BBC One: such examples include &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; and popular comedies &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; and &quot;Miranda&quot;, which moved to BBC One after success on Two. Also in August 2014, &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot; moved to BBC One, due to its success the previous year on BBC Two. In 2017, &quot;Bake Off&quot; moved from BBC One to Channel 4.

Another founding part of BBC Two was to provide educational and community programming on the BBC, as part of its public service remit. The educational section of this commitment saw BBC2 broadcast a large amount of programming for the Open University, who co-produced programming with the corporation, and saw the channel broadcast BBC Schools programmes from 1983 until the programmes were transferred to the BBC Learning Zone in 2010.

As a result of the channel&#x27;s commitment to community broadcasting, the channel produced the symbolic &quot;Open Space&quot; series, a strand developed in the early 1970s in which members of the public would be allotted half an hour of television time, and given a level of editorial and technical training in order to produce for themselves a film on an issue most important to them. BBC2&#x27;s Community Programme Unit kept this aspect of the channel&#x27;s tradition alive into the 1990s in the form of &quot;Video Diaries&quot; and later &quot;Video Nation&quot;. The Community Programmes Unit was disbanded in 2004.

BBC Two has also given various programmes from around the world their first UK broadcasts, and have introduced many more to terrestrial audiences. International shows that have been broadcast on BBC Two include &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;24&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, &quot;American Dad!&quot;, &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, &quot;Moonlighting&quot;, &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;.

In January 2013, BBC Two ceased to show children&#x27;s programmes and replaced the weekday morning schedule with repeats of the previous BBC One daytime schedule, children&#x27;s programmes was returned in 2017 and 2022 in Saturday morning. It also began showing &quot;Sign Zone&quot; in the early hours; prior to 2013, this had been broadcast by BBC One. This was the only channel that broadcast Sign Zone in the early hours until the relaunch of BBC Three as a television channel in 2022.

From October 2013, BBC Two has shown classic programmes like &quot;Bergerac&quot;, &quot;Cagney and Lacey&quot;, &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot;, and &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; on weekday afternoons, with the retro logos from 1970s and 1980s, between the current programmes.

In October 2014, &quot;Russell Howard&#x27;s Good News&quot; and &quot;Backchat&quot; moved to BBC Two from BBC Three.

In 2014, BBC Two commissioned Britain&#x27;s first transgender sitcom, &quot;Boy Meets Girl&quot;, which follows the developing relationship between Leo, a 26-year-old man, and Judy, a 40-year-old transgender woman.

From 7 April 2015, the morning &quot;Sign Zone&quot; was shown before &quot;Victoria Derbyshire&quot; 8:00am-9:00 am including &quot;See Hear&quot; on Wednesday morning.

BBC Two is also known for broadcasting some news and current affairs programmes. It broadcasts BBC News updates every morning at 9 am, simulcasting the BBC News channel after it stops simulcasting &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; on BBC1. This includes an edition of &quot;BBC Business Today&quot; at 11:30 and &quot;Sportsday&quot; at 11:45, then fifteen minutes of &quot;BBC News Now&quot;, this had previously been between 2006-2010 an edition of &quot;World News Today&quot; and 2010-2011 &quot;GMT&quot;. At 12:15 pm during the Parliament session, political debate programme &quot;Politics Live&quot; is broadcast on BBC Two. On Wednesdays, due to the Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, the programme is broadcast at the earlier time of 11:15am. The programme is not broadcast on Fridays or when Parliament is on a holiday break, so the simulcast of &quot;BBC News Now&quot; continues until 1:00pm for the &quot;BBC News at One&quot; on BBC One. At 10:30pm, current affairs programme &quot;Newsnight&quot; provides reports and analysis of the stories behind the day&#x27;s headlines. BBC Two does not broadcast any news and current affairs programming at the weekend.

From 2017 until 2019, it broadcast the UK selection show for the Eurovision Song Contest, &quot;Eurovision: You Decide&quot;. The channel stopped broadcasting the show after the 2019 edition due to the fact that the BBC opted for an internal selection in collaboration with BMG Rights Management.

In 2020, it was reported that the programme &quot;Victoria Derbyshire&quot; would end, owing to the BBC&#x27;s £80m cuts. Since the beginning of the Coronavirus pandemic, Victoria Derbyshire has been presenting the first hour of BBC News, which continues until 13:00.

BBC Two is also known for broadcasting some BBC One programmes in a change to the schedules when that channel is broadcasting a BBC News Special. For example; during the Coronavirus pandemic, BBC1 aired press conferences from the UK government about major developments from the pandemic and the scheduled BBC One programming during those News Specials was broadcast on BBC Two. However, on 9 April 2021 – the day of the death of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh – BBC Two and BBC One both simulcast BBC News for the whole day. The same would happen on both 8 and 19 September 2022, following the death and state funeral respectively of Elizabeth II.

==Ratings and reception==

In a 2013 BBC Populus poll, BBC Two had the third-highest per-country TV channel quality rating among viewers surveyed in 14 countries, behind BBC One and Brazil&#x27;s TV Cultura.

==Presentation and former logos==
The 1991 idents featured a sans-serif numeral &quot;2&quot; at the centre of an initially art-related scene; however, the idents moved away from this style as the station&#x27;s style changed. Although highly praised, this expansive set of idents was ended in November 2001. The BBC corporate logo was updated within the idents in October 1997, though the idents moved away from the original viridian colour scheme in these latter years. The subsequent presentation style was introduced on 19 November 2001 and kept the same figure &quot;2&quot;, but in a yellow background and given a personality. At the time, BBC Two became the first BBC channel to feature a box logo.

In 2007, BBC Two debuted the new theme, a &quot;Window on the World&quot;, with the &quot;2&quot; numeral providing that view. Introduced on 18 February 2007, the new look also had the channel adopt a teal-coloured box logo, featuring the BBC logo above the word &quot;TWO&quot;, now in the font Avenir.

In 2014, in honour of the channel&#x27;s 50th anniversary, some of the 1990s idents were re-introduced and from 2015, BBC Two Northern Ireland opted to use nearly forty idents from the 1991–2001 set.

On 27 September 2018, the 1991–2001 idents were retired once again and BBC Two introduced a new set of idents, based on scenes incorporating a curve motif resembling the number 2. The new branding is designed to reflect BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;constant evolution, constant eclecticism, [and] constant sense of quality&quot;. The new idents are produced by various artists and studios, including Aardman Animations, The Mill and others. The new identity was developed by BBC Creative and Superunion.

===Regional variations===
BBC Two also has regional variations in Wales and Northern Ireland, which occasionally opt out of the national BBC Two feed to air programmes of local interest.

In November 2001, BBC Wales introduced a special opt-out service known as BBC 2W, which aired weekdays from 8.30 p.m. to 10 p.m. in the BBC Two Wales channel space on digital television, and carried a separate schedule of Welsh-produced programming in comparison to the analogue BBC Two Wales. BBC 2W was discontinued in 2008 due to the transition to digital terrestrial television, with the main BBC Two Wales schedule being carried on Freeview thereafter.

BBC Two Scotland operated until February 2019, when it was replaced by the national feed. Concurrently, a bespoke BBC Scotland channel was launched, which simulcasts the BBC Two schedule with opt-outs for local programming from 7:00 p.m. to midnight nightly, and occasionally during the afternoon for news and sports programmes.

==Availability outside the UK==
The Northern Irish version of BBC Two is widely available in the Republic of Ireland on satellite and cable, as well as being received directly in areas bordering Northern Ireland, or in coastal areas from Wales. The national version of BBC Two is also available on cable and IPTV in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Monaco and Liechtenstein. 
The channel is registered to broadcast within the European Union/EEA through the Luxembourgish Broadcasting Regulator – ALIA.

On 27 March 2013, it began being carried by British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) to members of HM Forces and their families around the world, replacing the BFBS2 TV channel, which already carried a selection of BBC Two programmes. It shares a channel with CBBC, which broadcasts from early morning until the early evening.

All feeds of BBC Two in both SD and HD are broadcast unencrypted on the Astra 2E and 2G satellites, allowing viewing across Belgium, the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and parts of France, Germany and Spain.

==Accessibility==
The BBC announced in May 2008 that it had achieved its aim for all programming to have subtitles for viewers with hearing difficulties. These are available on the BBC Red Button, and until 23 October 2012, via the Ceefax teletext service.

The BBC also offers audio description on some popular programmes for visually impaired-viewers as well as British sign language interpretation on some of its programmes for deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers. The percentage of the BBC&#x27;s total television output with audio description available is 10%, having been increased from 8% in 2008.

==BBC Two HD==

Originally, programmes from BBC Two were shown in high definition on the dedicated BBC HD channel, alongside programmes from BBC Three and BBC Four, as well as some select series from CBBC and CBeebies. However, in plans outlined by the director general Mark Thompson on 6 October 2011, BBC HD would close to be replaced by &quot;BBC Two HD&quot;, a high-definition simulcast of BBC Two that would work much the same way as BBC One HD. This move allowed the corporation to save £2.1 million, used to count towards its budget deficit following the freezing of the licence fee and the additional financial responsibility of addition services.

On 19 February 2013, it was announced that BBC Two HD would replace BBC HD from 6.05 a.m. on 26 March 2013. Channel numbers for the BBC&#x27;s HD channels also changed on Sky, to allow BBC One HD and BBC Two HD to sit side-by-side on channels 141, and 142 respectively on the EPG.

On 16 July 2013, the BBC indicated that it wants to launch Northern Irish, Scottish and Welsh variations of BBC Two HD; however, this would require the approval of the BBC Trust, with a proposal due to be presented within six months.

On 10 December 2013, BBC Two HD was swapped with the SD channel in England on Sky&#x27;s EPG for HD subscribers.

In October 2018, the BBC announced that regional variants of BBC Two HD in Wales and Northern Ireland would launch at the end of November that year on terrestrial, satellite (Wales only) and iPlayer. BBC Two HD in these regions were swapped with the SD channel on Sky&#x27;s EPG for HD subscribers. A Scotland variant was not launched, as BBC Two Scotland was discontinued in February 2019 in favour of the new BBC Scotland channel. BBC Two Northern Ireland HD later eventually launched on Sky and Freesat on 5 January 2023, with the SD version shutting down on Sky and Freesat on 24 January 2023.

<text>In statistics, an outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations. An outlier may be due to a variability in the measurement, an indication of novel data, or it may be the result of experimental error; the latter are sometimes excluded from the data set. An outlier can be an indication of exciting possibility, but can also cause serious problems in statistical analyses.

Outliers can occur by chance in any distribution, but they can indicate novel behaviour or structures in the data-set, measurement error, or that the population has a heavy-tailed distribution. In the case of measurement error, one wishes to discard them or use statistics that are robust to outliers, while in the case of heavy-tailed distributions, they indicate that the distribution has high skewness and that one should be very cautious in using tools or intuitions that assume a normal distribution. A frequent cause of outliers is a mixture of two distributions, which may be two distinct sub-populations, or may indicate &#x27;correct trial&#x27; versus &#x27;measurement error&#x27;; this is modeled by a mixture model.

In most larger samplings of data, some data points will be further away from the sample mean than what is deemed reasonable. This can be due to incidental systematic error or flaws in the theory that generated an assumed family of probability distributions, or it may be that some observations are far from the center of the data. Outlier points can therefore indicate faulty data, erroneous procedures, or areas where a certain theory might not be valid. However, in large samples, a small number of outliers is to be expected (and not due to any anomalous condition).

Outliers, being the most extreme observations, may include the sample maximum or sample minimum, or both, depending on whether they are extremely high or low. However, the sample maximum and minimum are not always outliers because they may not be unusually far from other observations.

Naive interpretation of statistics derived from data sets that include outliers may be misleading. For example, if one is calculating the average temperature of 10 objects in a room, and nine of them are between 20 and 25 degrees Celsius, but an oven is at 175 °C, the median of the data will be between 20 and 25 °C but the mean temperature will be between 35.5 and 40 °C. In this case, the median better reflects the temperature of a randomly sampled object (but not the temperature in the room) than the mean; naively interpreting the mean as &quot;a typical sample&quot;, equivalent to the median, is incorrect. As illustrated in this case, outliers may indicate data points that belong to a different population than the rest of the sample set.

Estimators capable of coping with outliers are said to be robust: the median is a robust statistic of central tendency, while the mean is not.

== Occurrence and causes ==

In the case of normally distributed data, the three sigma rule means that roughly 1 in 22 observations will differ by twice the standard deviation or more from the mean, and 1 in 370 will deviate by three times the standard deviation. In a sample of 1000 observations, the presence of up to five observations deviating from the mean by more than three times the standard deviation is within the range of what can be expected, being less than twice the expected number and hence within 1 standard deviation of the expected number – see Poisson distribution – and not indicate an anomaly. If the sample size is only 100, however, just three such outliers are already reason for concern, being more than 11 times the expected number.

In general, if the nature of the population distribution is known &quot;a priori&quot;, it is possible to test if the number of outliers deviate significantly from what can be expected: for a given cutoff (so samples fall beyond the cutoff with probability &quot;p&quot;) of a given distribution, the number of outliers will follow a binomial distribution with parameter &quot;p&quot;, which can generally be well-approximated by the Poisson distribution with λ = &quot;pn&quot;. Thus if one takes a normal distribution with cutoff 3 standard deviations from the mean, &quot;p&quot; is approximately 0.3%, and thus for 1000 trials one can approximate the number of samples whose deviation exceeds 3 sigmas by a Poisson distribution with λ = 3.

=== Causes ===
Outliers can have many anomalous causes. A physical apparatus for taking measurements may have suffered a transient malfunction. There may have been an error in data transmission or transcription. Outliers arise due to changes in system behaviour, fraudulent behaviour, human error, instrument error or simply through natural deviations in populations. A sample may have been contaminated with elements from outside the population being examined. Alternatively, an outlier could be the result of a flaw in the assumed theory, calling for further investigation by the researcher. Additionally, the pathological appearance of outliers of a certain form appears in a variety of datasets, indicating that the causative mechanism for the data might differ at the extreme end (King effect).

== Definitions and detection ==
There is no rigid mathematical definition of what constitutes an outlier; determining whether or not an observation is an outlier is ultimately a subjective exercise. There are various methods of outlier detection, some of which are treated as synonymous with novelty detection. Some are graphical such as normal probability plots. Others are model-based. Box plots are a hybrid.

Model-based methods which are commonly used for identification assume that the data are from a normal distribution, and identify observations which are deemed &quot;unlikely&quot; based on mean and standard deviation:
* Chauvenet&#x27;s criterion
* Grubbs&#x27;s test for outliers
* Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Q&quot; test
* ASTM E178: Standard Practice for Dealing With Outlying Observations
* Mahalanobis distance and leverage are often used to detect outliers, especially in the development of linear regression models.
* Subspace and correlation based techniques for high-dimensional numerical data

===Peirce&#x27;s criterion===

It is proposed to determine in a series of formula_1 observations the limit of error, beyond which all observations involving so great an error may be rejected, provided there are as many as formula_2 such observations. The principle upon which it is proposed to solve this problem is, that the proposed observations should be rejected when the probability of the system of errors obtained by retaining them is less than that of the system of errors obtained by their rejection multiplied by the probability of making so many, and no more, abnormal observations. (Quoted in the editorial note on page 516 to Peirce (1982 edition) from &quot;A Manual of Astronomy&quot; 2:558 by Chauvenet.)

===Tukey&#x27;s fences===
Other methods flag observations based on measures such as the interquartile range. For example, if formula_3 and formula_4 are the lower and upper quartiles respectively, then one could define an outlier to be any observation outside the range:
:formula_5
for some nonnegative constant formula_6.
John Tukey proposed this test, where formula_7 indicates an &quot;outlier&quot;, and formula_8 indicates data that is &quot;far out&quot;.

=== In anomaly detection ===

In various domains such as, but not limited to, statistics, signal processing, finance, econometrics, manufacturing, networking and data mining, the task of &quot;anomaly detection&quot; may take other approaches. Some of these may be distance-based and density-based such as Local Outlier Factor (LOF). Some approaches may use the distance to the k-nearest neighbors to label observations as outliers or non-outliers.

===Modified Thompson Tau test===

The modified Thompson Tau test is a method used to determine if an outlier exists in a data set. The strength of this method lies in the fact that it takes into account a data set&#x27;s standard deviation, average and provides a statistically determined rejection zone; thus providing an objective method to determine if a data point is an outlier.
How it works:
First, a data set&#x27;s average is determined. Next the absolute deviation between each data point and the average are determined. Thirdly, a rejection region is determined using the formula: 
:formula_9; 
where formula_10 is the critical value from the Student distribution with &quot;n&quot;-2 degrees of freedom, &quot;n&quot; is the sample size, and s is the sample standard deviation.
To determine if a value is an outlier:
Calculate formula_11.
If &quot;δ&quot; &gt; Rejection Region, the data point is an outlier.
If &quot;δ&quot; ≤ Rejection Region, the data point is not an outlier.

The modified Thompson Tau test is used to find one outlier at a time (largest value of &quot;δ&quot; is removed if it is an outlier). Meaning, if a data point is found to be an outlier, it is removed from the data set and the test is applied again with a new average and rejection region. This process is continued until no outliers remain in a data set.

Some work has also examined outliers for nominal (or categorical) data. In the context of a set of examples (or instances) in a data set, instance hardness measures the probability that an instance will be misclassified ( formula_12 where is the assigned class label and represent the input attribute value for an instance in the training set ). Ideally, instance hardness would be calculated by summing over the set of all possible hypotheses :

:formula_13

Practically, this formulation is unfeasible as is potentially infinite and calculating formula_14 is unknown for many algorithms. Thus, instance hardness can be approximated using a diverse subset formula_15:

:formula_16

where formula_17 is the hypothesis induced by learning algorithm formula_18 trained on training set with hyperparameters formula_19. Instance hardness provides a continuous value for determining if an instance is an outlier instance.

== Working with outliers ==
The choice of how to deal with an outlier should depend on the cause. Some estimators are highly sensitive to outliers, notably estimation of covariance matrices.

=== Retention ===
Even when a normal distribution model is appropriate to the data being analyzed, outliers are expected for large sample sizes and should not automatically be discarded if that is the case. Instead, one should use a method that is robust to outliers to model or analyze data with naturally occurring outliers.

=== Exclusion ===
When deciding whether to remove an outlier, the cause has to be considered. As mentioned earlier, if the outlier&#x27;s origin can be attributed to an experimental error, or if it can be otherwise determined that the outlying data point is erroneous, it is generally recommended to remove it. However, it is more desirable to correct the erroneous value, if possible. 

Removing a data point solely because it is an outlier, on the other hand, is a controversial practice, often frowned upon by many scientists and science instructors, as it typically invalidates statistical results. While mathematical criteria provide an objective and quantitative method for data rejection, they do not make the practice more scientifically or methodologically sound, especially in small sets or where a normal distribution cannot be assumed. Rejection of outliers is more acceptable in areas of practice where the underlying model of the process being measured and the usual distribution of measurement error are confidently known. 

The two common approaches to exclude outliers are truncation (or trimming) and Winsorising. Trimming discards the outliers whereas Winsorising replaces the outliers with the nearest &quot;nonsuspect&quot; data. Exclusion can also be a consequence of the measurement process, such as when an experiment is not entirely capable of measuring such extreme values, resulting in censored data.

In regression problems, an alternative approach may be to only exclude points which exhibit a large degree of influence on the estimated coefficients, using a measure such as Cook&#x27;s distance.

If a data point (or points) is excluded from the data analysis, this should be clearly stated on any subsequent report.

=== Non-normal distributions ===
The possibility should be considered that the underlying distribution of the data is not approximately normal, having &quot;fat tails&quot;. For instance, when sampling from a Cauchy distribution, the sample variance increases with the sample size, the sample mean fails to converge as the sample size increases, and outliers are expected at far larger rates than for a normal distribution. Even a slight difference in the fatness of the tails can make a large difference in the expected number of extreme values.

=== Set-membership uncertainties ===
A set membership approach considers that the uncertainty corresponding to the &quot;i&quot;th measurement of an unknown random vector &quot;x&quot; is represented by a set &quot;X&quot;i (instead of a probability density function). If no outliers occur, &quot;x&quot; should belong to the intersection of all &quot;X&quot;i&#x27;s. When outliers occur, this intersection could be empty, and we should relax a small number of the sets &quot;X&quot;i (as small as possible) in order to avoid any inconsistency. This can be done using the notion of &quot;q&quot;-relaxed intersection. As illustrated by the figure, the &quot;q&quot;-relaxed intersection corresponds to the set of all &quot;x&quot; which belong to all sets except &quot;q&quot; of them. Sets &quot;X&quot;i that do not intersect the &quot;q&quot;-relaxed intersection could be suspected to be outliers.

=== Alternative models ===
In cases where the cause of the outliers is known, it may be possible to incorporate this effect into the model structure, for example by using a hierarchical Bayes model, or a mixture model.

<doc id="160953" wikidata="Q4381964" url="?curid=160953" title="Rex the Runt">
<text>Rex the Runt is a stop-motion adult animated claymation pixilation comedy series, primarily consisting of a television show and two short films produced by Aardman Animations and Egmont Imagination for BBC Bristol, with EVA Entertainment co-producing the first series. Its main characters are four plasticine dogs: Rex, Wendy, Bad Bob and Vince.

Rex was first introduced as a minor character in &quot;Ident&quot; (1989), a short film directed by Richard Starzak for the &quot;Lip Synch&quot; series. During the seven years of development of the characters, Starzak produced three pilots, subtitled &quot;How Dinosaurs Became Extinct&quot; (1991), &quot;Dreams&quot; (1991) and &quot;North by North Pole&quot; (1996). The 1991 pilots were unknown to the Aardman crew at the time, as Starzak created them during his free time. Because of this, the series wasn&#x27;t pitched until the discovery of these shorts a year later, as the team found potential to turn these shorts into a full-fledged series.

Thirteen ten-minute episodes of the series aired over two weeks on BBC Two from December 1998. A second, thirteen-episode series aired from September 2001 on the same channel. As well as the core cast, guest voices included Paul Merton, Morwenna Banks, Judith Chalmers, Antoine de Caunes, Bob Holness, Simon Day, Bob Monkhouse, Jonathan Ross, Graham Norton, Arthur Smith, June Whitfield, Kathy Burke, Pam Ayres and Eddie Izzard.

The animation is unusual in that the models are almost two-dimensional and are animated to exaggerate this - they are flattened in appearance and animated on a sheet of glass with the backgrounds behind the sheet. This would be altered in the second series, as the models would become more three-dimensional.

==Characters==

===Main===

* Rex, the protagonist — a timid, irritable runt. He is quick-witted and usually comes up with plans to get out of the scrapes the gang finds themselves in. However, he can also annoy the others by being a smart aleck. His favourite superhero is Rocket Raymond. He is the leader of the gang, even having his name, Rex, translating to &quot;King&quot; in Latin.
* Bad Bob is a &quot;big, fat slob&quot;, interested in food and TV. His friends, and occasionally even he himself, describe him as a &quot;Big, fat, jelly-wobbly, fat bastard&quot;, usually getting cut off towards the end. He is distinguishable by his eye patch, which changes from eye to eye, and often carries around a revolver almost the size of himself. However grumpy he might be, he is intelligent and loyal. Bad Bob is also known to build unique gadgets and inventions out of knick-knacks and everyday household objects, such as using an empty can of beans as a form of time machine.
* Wendy is the only female housemate, distinguishable by her eyelashes, pink colour, noticeably hemispheric breasts, and wears a red (or starting with series 2, pink) bow on her head. She is cynical, sarcastic, and fiercely independent. Wendy provides solutions to problems albeit in a distant or non-caring way. She speaks in a Mancunian accent.
* Vince is the pet of the household, although all four are dogs. He is distinguished by his prominent buckteeth and mismatched eyes. He speaks in single words or short disjointed phrases, his favourites being &quot;Spaghetti&quot;, &quot;Tuesday&quot;, &quot;Jam&quot;, and &quot;Trousers&quot;. Vince suffers from &quot;Random Pavarotti Disease&quot;, causing him to randomly blurt out snatches of opera. While he appears to be unintelligent, he occasionally shows great ingenuity, for example by building an elaborate Heath Robinson machine designed to kill a mouse. The other members of the gang often respond to Vince&#x27;s random outbursts by irritably telling him to &quot;shut it&quot;. Vince often has a habit of copying what others have said, sometimes even if they have just said it in their minds, which Bad Bob finds really annoying.

===Others===

Many one-off and recurring characters in Rex The Runt are voiced by various well-known UK celebrities. These include:

* Doctor Dogg is a medical doctor. Moustachioed, complacent and greedy, he&#x27;s an opportunistic money-grabber, whose habitual charge for any treatment is &quot;ten quid&quot; - regardless of whether the cure works or does more harm than good. He isn&#x27;t above using the main characters in medical research. Voiced by Paul Merton.
* Arthur Dustcart, another semi-regular character, who first makes an appearance in the last episode of the first series, but appears quite frequently in the second. He is an ugly but experienced dustman, sporting sleepy mismatched eyes, a neckerchief, a pair of dirty underpants and a large nose with prominent nasal hair. Despite his grotesque appearance and smell, he and Wendy get on rather well, much to the annoyance of Rex. He becomes a friend of the household when he helps find Rex after he was turned into spaghetti. Voiced by Arthur Smith.
* Mrs. Bloomers, head of Kumfy Kennels. Treats dogs with care, until she put Vince in the kennel and he ate a chihuahua. Voiced by Morwenna Banks.
* Judith Poodle, hostess of a holiday program. Usually ends her sentences with &quot;Ruff!&quot;. Voiced by Judith Chalmers.
* Mr. Formal, the Runts&#x27; bank manager, until Bad Bob brought his gun and made him think they were bank robbers. Voiced by Bob Holness.
* Melting Blob Man, a three-year-old, but very smart slime creature who warned the Runts about the black hole.
* Constable Funnyname, a police dog who arrests Wendy in &quot;The Trials of Wendy&quot;. Voiced by Simon Day.
* Judge Pikelet, elderly judge in &quot;The Trials of Wendy&quot;. Voiced by June Whitfield
* Kylie Mandlebrotska, Rex&#x27;s old math teacher, until she fell into the black hole. Voiced by Kathy Burke.
* Easter Island Aliens, three space aliens from the planet Thribb, where the people look like the Moai statues from Easter Island. Voiced by Eddie Izzard.
* Morris the One-Gloved Mouse, invaded Rex&#x27;s kitchen in &quot;Mouse In Me Kitchen&quot;. Voiced by Phil Jupitus. 
* Osvaldo Halitosis, a moustached Morph in &quot;Patio&quot;, voiced by Graham Norton.
* Mr Chittock, angry neighbour to Rex, after the gang went into his house and drank his beer. Voiced by veteran alternative comedian Stephen Frost.
* Johnny Saveloy, a teenage sausage who was really very old but was kept in a state of artificial youth due to the Church of Chemicology. Voiced by Bob Monkhouse.
* Stinky Basil, a smarmy French talent-spotter. Voiced by Antoine De Caunes, known best in the UK for presenting the Channel 4 late-night adult entertainment show &quot;Eurotrash&quot;.
* Wayne The Zebra. Voiced by Bobby Ball.
* Tiddles The Destroyer. A mean fighting cat, long known to the gang, who despises Bad Bob. Voiced by Tommy Cannon.
* The Happy Rabbits, a band who may sing beautifully but are really cranky and will not let anybody stand in their way.
* Awards announcer in &quot;Wendy&#x27;s New Hair Do&quot; and Handsome Rex in &quot;Wendy&#x27;s Hot Date&quot;, voiced by Jonathan Ross.

==References to other Aardman productions==
Several episodes of &quot;Rex the Runt&quot; contain inside references to other projects created by Aardman Animations:
*In the episode &quot;Adventures on Telly Part I&quot;, Wallace (from the &quot;Wallace and Gromit&quot; series) is washing the windows on Rex&#x27;s house, until Bad Bob pushes his ladder over (in the film &quot;A Close Shave&quot;, Wallace operates a window washing business).
*Pib and Pog, two of Aardman&#x27;s lesser known creations, are present in the spectator gallery during the courtroom scene from &quot;The Trials of Wendy&quot; and are also present in the audience watching Rex&#x27;s band in &quot;Stinky&#x27;s Search for a Star&quot;.
*In the episode &quot;Johnny Saveloy&#x27;s Undoing&quot;, two of the jars containing the chemical essences of various stars are labelled &quot;Wallace&quot; and &quot;Gromit&quot;. Another jar on the top shelf reads &quot;Nick Park&quot;.
*The exorcist called upon in &quot;Patio&quot; is actually Morph, a character from an Aardman children&#x27;s show, wearing a trench coat, hat, and large moustache.
*There are two references in the episode &quot;Wayne the Zebra&quot;: A &quot;Chicken Run&quot;-style chicken (Edwina) is rejected during the auditions (with Bad Bob making a comment regarding the recent popularity of chickens, referring to the film&#x27;s success), and Bad Bob consults the Aardman book &quot;Cracking Animation&quot; (, published in the US as &quot;Creating 3-D Animation&quot;).
*The episode entitled &quot;A Crap Day Out&quot; may be a pun on the Wallace and Gromit short film &quot;A Grand Day Out&quot;.
*Both Wallace from Wallace and Gromit and Rex live on streets that sound similar to their names: whereas Wallace and Gromit live on &quot;West Wallaby Street&quot;, it can be seen from the various post that arrives for the household that Rex and company live at &quot;7, Marsupial Way, Rexford&quot;
*In the 2000 animated film Chicken Run, Nick and Fetcher can be seen eating Chuffy dog food.
* In the 2003 animated TV series &quot;Creature Comforts&quot;: in the episode &quot;Is Anyone Out There?&quot; a blue alien wears a T-shirt with Vince on it.
* In the 2006 film &quot;Flushed Away&quot;: young rat named Maximillian &quot;Shocky&quot; Malone wears a green T-shirt with Rex on it.
* In the 2015 film &quot;Shaun the Sheep Movie&quot;: Vince is one of the photographed animals marked as &#x27;contained&#x27; by Trumper.
* In the 2019 film &quot;A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon&quot;: During the end credits, the stars briefly form in the shape of Bad Bob.

== Production ==
As previously mentioned, &quot;Rex the Runt&quot; consisted mainly of two short films that were entirely animated by Richard Starzak during his free time. The animation from these shorts were very crude and bizarre, and featured different designs for the gang. At the time, the team at Aardman had never known about these films, and didn&#x27;t discover them until a year later, as they found potential to turn these shorts into a series. Each episode of the series cost $166,000.

The show was originally going to be on Saturday Zoo as comedy skits for the show, the main idea being that it was &quot;like a cartoon strip&quot;. Soon after, the BBC got interested in the series. From here, the episodes slowly got longer, until the 10-minute episodes that it eventually used.

With help from the crew, a third pilot (North by North Pole) was produced as a pitch for the BBC in 1996, this time with much smoother animation and a plotline that would later define how the series was going to be. Parts of this pilot were incorporated into the episode &quot;The Adventures On Telly, Part 2&quot; due to the footage being expensive to reshoot. Unfortunately, other than a screenshot of the title card, the full pilot has yet to be released to the public.

The production of Series 1 began between late 1997 and early 1998. It was produced at Wetherell Place, Aardman&#x27;s smallest studio space. The production office was on-site. A storyboard artist continually sketched boards for episodes to be shot later in the schedule, and there was a model-shop attached to the studio (where the models and props would be made). The unusual animation technique was laying the characters on top of a sheet of glass with the backgrounds behind the sheet (with the backgrounds being below the sheet, to show depth) angled away from the animators at 45 degrees. At any point, two to three episodes could be in production at any time, with each episode taking around four to six weeks to make. Some scenes, such as most of &quot;The Adventures On Telly, Part 3&quot; were filmed in front of a blue-screen to show a different background, such as space. The animation of Series 1 took 10 months, then went into post-production, and finally aired in December 1998.

The models did not use armatures due to of the strange form of animation, making them much easier to move around.

==Underdog==
Underdog is an advertising character (voiced by Joe Pasquale), first appearing in 2010, animated by Aardman Animations, in the same style as the Rex the Runt figures, but wearing bandages, promoting the personal injury claims company National Accident Helpline.

Underdog also has a friend named Cindy

== Reception ==
On IMDb, Rex the Runt received a rating of 7.9/10 from 367 users.

== Merchandise ==
&quot;Rex the Runt&quot; was eventually popular enough to have its own merchandise. Some known items of merchandise include:
*&quot;Rex the Runt&#x27;s Rainy Day Companion&quot;, a book written by Kevin Wrench and Andrew Franks
*Five &quot;Rex the Runt&quot; plushies, the characters being Rex, Wendy, Bad Bob, Vince and also Vince wearing his chicken bib and holding cutlery (as he is seen in &quot;Carbonara)&quot;
*Several DVDs released in different countries (with a few episodes from Season 2 being featured on &quot;Aardman&#x27;s Darkside&quot;, a DVD containing some of Aardman&#x27;s &quot;darker&quot; material)
*A bag in the shape of Vince
*Limited edition &quot;Rex the Runt&quot;-themed &quot;Starburst Juicy Gums&quot;
*A T-shirt with the logo and main cast on it
*A video game named &quot;Rex the Runt: Lost Marbles&quot;, based on the episode &quot;A Holiday in Vince&quot;, in which Rex, Wendy and Bad Bob must go inside Vince&#x27;s body to collect marbles and cure his &quot;Random Pavarotti Disease&quot;.
*Several toys exclusive to Japan such as a figurine of Wendy and a keychain of Rex wearing a crown.

== Cancelled content ==
There were many things that never happened, due to the series ending so quickly. The series’ creator, Richard Starzak, hoped to be able to do the following:

* A possible Series 3.
* More backstory for the characters, including an implied history between Wendy and Bad Bob.
* Expansion of episodes into 30-minutes.

<text>The Battle of White Mountain (; ) was an important battle in the early stages of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. It led to the defeat of the Bohemian Revolt and ensured Habsburg control for the next three hundred years.

It was fought on 8 November 1620. An army of 21,000 Bohemians and mercenaries under Christian of Anhalt was defeated by 23,000 men of the combined armies of Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor, led by Charles Bonaventure de Longueval, Count of Bucquoy, and the German Catholic League led by Johann Tserclaes, later Count of Tilly, at Bílá Hora (&quot;White Mountain&quot;) near Prague. Bohemian casualties were not severe but their morale collapsed and Imperial forces occupied Prague the next day.

==Prelude==
In the early 17th century most of the Bohemian estates, although under the dominion of the predominantly Catholic Holy Roman Empire, had large Protestant populations, and had been granted rights and protections allowing them varying degrees of religious and political freedom.

In 1617, as the health of Emperor Matthias deteriorated, his cousin Ferdinand – a devout Catholic and proponent of the Counter-Reformation – was named his successor as Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia. This led to deep consternation among many Bohemian Protestants, who feared not only the loss of their properties, but also of their traditional semi-autonomy, under which many of the estates had separate, individual constitutions governing their relationship with the Empire, and where the king was elected by the local leaders.

Ferdinand (who would become Emperor Ferdinand II following Matthias&#x27; death in 1619) saw Protestantism as inimical to the Empire, and wanted to impose absolutist rule on Bohemia while encouraging conversion to the Catholic faith. He also hoped to reclaim church properties which had been seized by Protestants at the start of the Reformation decades earlier.

Particularly galling to Protestants were perceived violations of Emperor Rudolf II&#x27;s 1609 Letter of Majesty, which had ensured religious freedom throughout Bohemia. In May 1618, wanting to air their grievances over this and other issues, a group of Bohemian noblemen met representatives of the Emperor at the royal castle in Prague; the meeting ended with two of the representatives and their scribe being thrown out a high window and seriously injured. This incident, known as the Third Defenestration of Prague, triggered the Bohemian Revolt.

In November 1619, Elector Palatine Frederick V, who like many of the rebels was a Calvinist, was chosen as King of Bohemia by the Bohemian Electorate.

==Battle==

In 1620, now fully established as emperor, Ferdinand II set out to conquer Bohemia and make an example of the rebels. King Frederick and his military commander, Prince Christian of Anhalt, had organized a Protestant army of 30,000 men; Ferdinand countered with a force of 25,000, many of them seasoned soldiers, under the capable leadership of Field Marshal Tilly, a Catholic Spanish-Flemish nobleman. Tilly&#x27;s army enjoyed the advantage of including two successful military leaders – Tilly himself and the future General Wallenstein. Tilly&#x27;s force was made up of two distinct groups: Imperial troops commanded by Charles Bonaventure de Longueval, Count of Bucquoy, and soldiers of the German Catholic League, directly under Tilly. All of the armies of the day employed numerous mercenaries, including, by some definitions, Tilly himself. Serving with the Catholic League as an official observer was the future &quot;father of modern philosophy&quot;, René Descartes.

After conquering most of western Bohemia, the Imperial army made for Prague, the Bohemian capital, then in rebel hands. The Bohemians attempted to block them by setting up defensive positions, which the Imperial army simply bypassed. Force-marching his men, Christian of Anhalt managed to get ahead of the Imperial army just before Prague. He thus gained an advantageous position on the &quot;White Mountain&quot;, actually a low plateau, but had little time to set up defensive works. Enthusiasm for joining battle was low on both sides. After the reverses of the previous several weeks, Christian of Anhalt&#x27;s army had been reduced to about 15,000 men, with little prospect of victory; the mercenaries on both sides had not been paid in months; and with winter approaching, cold wet weather made for less than ideal combat conditions.

On 8 November a small Imperial force was sent to probe the Protestant flank. To their surprise, the Bohemians retreated at their advance. Tilly quickly sent in reinforcements, and the Bohemian flank began to crumble. Anhalt tried to relieve the situation by sending forward infantry and cavalry led by his son Christian II. The cavalry charged into the Imperial infantry, causing significant casualties, but Tilly countered with his own cavalry, forcing the Bohemian horsemen to retire. The Bohemian infantry, who were only now approaching the Imperial army, saw the cavalry retreating, at which they fired one volley at extreme range before retreating themselves. A small group of Imperial cavalry began circling the Protestant forces, driving them to the middle of the battlefield. With the Bohemian army already demoralized, company after company began retreating, most without having actually entered the battle. Tilly and his Imperial cavalrymen advanced with 2,000 Bavarian hussars, steadily pushing Protestant forces back to the Star Palace (just west of Prague), where the rebels tried without success to establish a line of defense.

The Bohemian army was no match for the Emperor Ferdinand&#x27;s troops. The actual battle lasted only an hour and left the Bohemian army in tatters. Some 4,000 Protestants were killed or captured, while Imperial losses amounted to only about 700.

==Aftermath==

With the Bohemian army destroyed, Tilly entered Prague and the revolt collapsed. King Frederick fled the country with his wife Elizabeth after only a year on the throne (gaining him the mocking nickname &quot;the Winter King&quot;). Forty-seven leaders of the insurrection were put on trial, and twenty-seven of them were executed in Prague&#x27;s Old Town Square on what came to be called the &quot;Old Town Square execution&quot;. Amongst those executed were Kryštof Harant and Jan Jesenius. Today, 27 crosses have been laid into the cobblestones as a tribute to those executed. An estimated five-sixths of the Bohemian nobility went into exile soon after the Battle of White Mountain, and their properties were confiscated.

There remained a strong Protestant army in Silesia under the command of Johann Georg von Brandenburg, Duke of Krnov, which continued fighting the Imperial army in Moravia and in what today is Slovakia until 1623.

In 1621, the Emperor ordered all Calvinists and other non-Lutherans to leave the realm in three days or to convert to Catholicism. In 1622, he forbade practice of the Lutheran faith. In 1626, he ordered all Lutherans (most of whom had not been involved in the revolt) to convert or else leave the country. By 1627, Archbishop Harrach of Prague and Jaroslav Borzita of Martinice set out to convert the heretics, as they were termed, by peaceful means; most Bohemians converted, but a significant Protestant minority remained. 

Spanish troops, seeking to encircle their rebellious Dutch provinces, seized the Palatinate lands. With the prospect of Protestantism being overrun in Germany, Denmark entered the struggle. Sweden was to join the Protestant forces in 1630.

The population in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown declined by about a third until the end of the war.

The result of the 1620 battle brought two centuries of recatholicization of the Czech lands and the decline of the Czech-speaking aristocracy and elite as well as the Czech language (accompanied with the growing influence of German-speaking elites), a process that was slowed by the Czech National Revival starting in the late 18th century. Czech nationalist historians and writers such as Alois Jirásek have referred to the 17th and 18th century in the Czech lands as the Dark Age.

<text>In descriptive statistics, a box plot or boxplot is a method for demonstrating graphically the locality, spread and skewness groups of numerical data through their quartiles. In addition to the box on a box plot, there can be lines (which are called &quot;whiskers&quot;) extending from the box indicating variability outside the upper and lower quartiles, thus, the plot is also called the box-and-whisker plot and the box-and-whisker diagram. Outliers that differ significantly from the rest of the dataset may be plotted as individual points beyond the whiskers on the box-plot.
Box plots are non-parametric: they display variation in samples of a statistical population without making any assumptions of the underlying statistical distribution (though Tukey&#x27;s boxplot assumes symmetry for the whiskers and normality for their length). The spacings in each subsection of the box-plot indicate the degree of dispersion (spread) and skewness of the data, which are usually described using the five-number summary. In addition, the box-plot allows one to visually estimate various L-estimators, notably the interquartile range, midhinge, range, mid-range, and trimean. Box plots can be drawn either horizontally or vertically.

== History ==
The range-bar method was first introduced by Mary Eleanor Spear in her book &quot;Charting Statistics&quot; in 1952 and again in her book &quot;Practical Charting Techniques&quot; in 1969. The box-and-whisker plot was first introduced in 1970 by John Tukey, who later published on the subject in his book &quot;Exploratory Data Analysis&quot; in 1977.

==Elements==

A boxplot is a standardized way of displaying the dataset based on the five-number summary: the minimum, the maximum, the sample median, and the first and third quartiles.

* Minimum (&quot;Q&quot;0 or 0th percentile): the lowest data point in the data set excluding any outliers
* Maximum (&quot;Q&quot;4 or 100th percentile): the highest data point in the data set excluding any outliers
* Median (&quot;Q&quot;2 or 50th percentile): the middle value in the data set
* First quartile (&quot;Q&quot;1 or 25th percentile): also known as the &quot;lower quartile&quot; &quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot;(0.25), it is the median of the lower half of the dataset.
* Third quartile (&quot;Q&quot;3 or 75th percentile): also known as the &quot;upper quartile&quot; &quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot;(0.75), it is the median of the upper half of the dataset.

In addition to the minimum and maximum values used to construct a box-plot, another important element that can also be employed to obtain a box-plot is the interquartile range (IQR), as denoted below:

* Interquartile range (IQR) : the distance between the upper and lower quartiles

:: formula_1

A box-plot usually includes two parts, a box and a set of whiskers as shown in Figure 2.

===Box===
The box is drawn from &quot;Q&quot;1 to &quot;Q&quot;3 with a horizontal line drawn inside it to denote the median. Some box plots include an additional character to represent the mean of the data.

===Whiskers===
The whiskers must end at an observed data point, but can be defined in various ways. In the most straightforward method, the boundary of the lower whisker is the minimum value of the data set, and the boundary of the upper whisker is the maximum value of the data set. Because of this variability, it is appropriate to describe the convention that is being used for the whiskers and outliers in the caption of the box-plot.

Another popular choice for the boundaries of the whiskers is based on the 1.5 IQR value. From above the upper quartile (Q&quot;3), a distance of 1.5 times the IQR is measured out and a whisker is drawn &quot;up to&quot; the largest observed data point from the dataset that falls within this distance. Similarly, a distance of 1.5 times the IQR is measured out below the lower quartile (Q&quot;1) and a whisker is drawn &quot;down to&quot; the lowest observed data point from the dataset that falls within this distance. Because the whiskers must end at an observed data point, the whisker lengths can look unequal, even though 1.5 IQR is the same for both sides. All other observed data points outside the boundary of the whiskers are plotted as outliers. The outliers can be plotted on the box-plot as a dot, a small circle, a star, &quot;etc.&quot; (see example below).

There are other representations in which the whiskers can stand for several other things, such as:

* One standard deviation above and below the mean of the data set
* The 9th percentile and the 91st percentile of the data set
* The 2nd percentile and the 98th percentile of the data set

Rarely, box-plot can be plotted without the whiskers. This can be appropriate for sensitive information to avoid whiskers (and outliers) disclosing actual values observed.

The unusual percentiles 2%, 9%, 91%, 98% are sometimes used for whisker cross-hatches and whisker ends to depict the seven-number summary. If the data are normally distributed, the locations of the seven marks on the box plot will be equally spaced. On some box plots, a cross-hatch is placed before the end of each whisker.

==Variations==
Since the mathematician John W. Tukey first popularized this type of visual data display in 1969, several variations on the classical box plot have been developed, and the two most commonly found variations are the variable-width box plots and the notched box plots shown in Figure 4.

Variable-width box plots illustrate the size of each group whose data is being plotted by making the width of the box proportional to the size of the group. A popular convention is to make the box width proportional to the square root of the size of the group.

Notched box plots apply a &quot;notch&quot; or narrowing of the box around the median. Notches are useful in offering a rough guide of the significance of the difference of medians; if the notches of two boxes do not overlap, this will provide evidence of a statistically significant difference between the medians. The height of the notches is proportional to the interquartile range (IQR) of the sample and is inversely proportional to the square root of the size of the sample. However, there is an uncertainty about the most appropriate multiplier (as this may vary depending on the similarity of the variances of the samples). The width of the notch is arbitrarily chosen to be visually pleasing, and should be consistent amongst all box plots being displayed on the same page.

One convention for obtaining the boundaries of these notches is to use a distance of formula_2 around the median.

Adjusted box plots are intended to describe skew distributions, and they rely on the medcouple statistic of skewness. For a medcouple value of MC, the lengths of the upper and lower whiskers on the box-plot are respectively defined to be:
:formula_3
For a symmetrical data distribution, the medcouple will be zero, and this reduces the adjusted box-plot to the Tukey&#x27;s box-plot with equal whisker lengths of formula_4 for both whiskers.

Other kinds of box plots, such as the violin plots and the bean plots can show the difference between single-modal and multimodal distributions, which cannot be observed from the original classical box-plot.

== Examples ==

=== Example without outliers ===

A series of hourly temperatures were measured throughout the day in degrees Fahrenheit. The recorded values are listed in order as follows (°F): 57, 57, 57, 58, 63, 66, 66, 67, 67, 68, 69, 70, 70, 70, 70, 72, 73, 75, 75, 76, 76, 78, 79, 81.

A box plot of the data set can be generated by first calculating five relevant values of this data set: minimum, maximum, median (Q&quot;2), first quartile (Q&quot;1), and third quartile (&quot;Q&quot;3).

The minimum is the smallest number of the data set. In this case, the minimum recorded day temperature is 57°F.

The maximum is the largest number of the data set. In this case, the maximum recorded day temperature is 81°F.

The median is the &quot;middle&quot; number of the ordered data set. This means that exactly 50% of the elements are below the median and 50% of the elements are greater than the median. The median of this ordered data set is 70°F.

The first quartile value (&quot;Q&quot;1 or 25th percentile) is the number that marks one quarter of the ordered data set. In other words, there are exactly 25% of the elements that are less than the first quartile and exactly 75% of the elements that are greater than it. The first quartile value can be easily determined by finding the &quot;middle&quot; number between the minimum and the median. For the hourly temperatures, the &quot;middle&quot; number found between 57°F and 70°F is 66°F.

The third quartile value (&quot;Q&quot;3 or 75th percentile) is the number that marks three quarters of the ordered data set. In other words, there are exactly 75% of the elements that are less than the third quartile and 25% of the elements that are greater than it. The third quartile value can be easily obtained by finding the &quot;middle&quot; number between the median and the maximum. For the hourly temperatures, the &quot;middle&quot; number between 70°F and 81°F is 75°F.

The interquartile range, or IQR, can be calculated by subtracting the first quartile value (Q&quot;1) from the third quartile value (Q&quot;3):

: formula_5

Hence, formula_6

1.5 IQR above the third quartile is:

: formula_7

1.5 IQR below the first quartile is:

: formula_8

The upper whisker boundary of the box-plot is the largest data value that is within 1.5 IQR above the third quartile. Here, 1.5 IQR above the third quartile is 88.5°F and the maximum is 81°F. Therefore, the upper whisker is drawn at the value of the maximum, which is 81°F.

Similarly, the lower whisker boundary of the box plot is the smallest data value that is within 1.5 IQR below the first quartile. Here, 1.5 IQR below the first quartile is 52.5°F and the minimum is 57°F. Therefore, the lower whisker is drawn at the value of the minimum, which is 57°F.

=== Example with outliers ===

Above is an example without outliers. Here is a followup example for generating box-plot with outliers:

The ordered set for the recorded temperatures is (°F): 52, 57, 57, 58, 63, 66, 66, 67, 67, 68, 69, 70, 70, 70, 70, 72, 73, 75, 75, 76, 76, 78, 79, 89.

In this example, only the first and the last number are changed. The median, third quartile, and first quartile remain the same.

In this case, the maximum value in this data set is 89°F, and 1.5 IQR above the third quartile is 88.5°F. The maximum is greater than 1.5 IQR plus the third quartile, so the maximum is an outlier. Therefore, the upper whisker is drawn at the greatest value smaller than 1.5 IQR above the third quartile, which is 79°F.

Similarly, the minimum value in this data set is 52°F, and 1.5 IQR below the first quartile is 52.5°F. The minimum is smaller than 1.5 IQR minus the first quartile, so the minimum is also an outlier. Therefore, the lower whisker is drawn at the smallest value greater than 1.5 IQR below the first quartile, which is 57°F.

=== In the case of large datasets ===
An additional example for obtaining box-plot from a data set containing a large number of data points is:

==== General equation to compute empirical quantiles ====

: formula_9

: formula_10
:Here formula_11 stands for the general ordering of the data points (i.e. if formula_12, then formula_13 )

Using the above example that has 24 data points (&quot;n&quot; = 24), one can calculate the median, first and third quartile either mathematically or visually.

Median
: formula_14

First quartile
: formula_15

Third quartile
: formula_16

== Visualization ==
Although box plots may seem more primitive than histograms or kernel density estimates, they do have a number of advantages. First, the box plot enables statisticians to do a quick graphical examination on one or more data sets. Box-plots also take up less space and are therefore particularly useful for comparing distributions between several groups or sets of data in parallel (see Figure 1 for an example). Lastly, the overall structure of histograms and kernel density estimate can be strongly influenced by the choice of number and width of bins techniques and the choice of bandwidth, respectively.

Although looking at a statistical distribution is more common than looking at a box plot, it can be useful to compare the box plot against the probability density function (theoretical histogram) for a normal N(0,&quot;σ&quot;2) distribution and observe their characteristics directly (as shown in Figure 7).

<doc id="160962" wikidata="Q1195422" url="?curid=160962" title="Samuel Smiles">
<text>Samuel Smiles (23 December 1812 – 16 April 1904) was a British author and government reformer. Although he campaigned on a Chartist platform, he promoted the idea that more progress would come from new attitudes than from new laws. His primary work, &quot;Self-Help&quot; (1859), promoted thrift and claimed that poverty was caused largely by irresponsible habits, while also attacking materialism and &quot;laissez-faire&quot; government. It has been called &quot;the bible of mid-Victorian liberalism&quot; and had lasting effects on British political thought.

==Early life and education==
Born in Haddington, East Lothian, Scotland, Smiles was the son of Janet Wilson of Dalkeith and Samuel Smiles of Haddington. He was one of eleven surviving children. While his family members were strict Reformed Presbyterians, he did not practice. He studied at a local school, leaving at the age of 14. He apprenticed to be a doctor under Dr. Robert Lewins. This arrangement enabled Smiles to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh in 1829. There he furthered his interest in politics, and became a strong supporter of Joseph Hume.

His father died in the 1832 cholera epidemic, but Smiles was enabled to continue with his studies because he was supported by his mother. She ran the small family general store firm in the belief that the &quot;Lord will provide&quot;. Her example of working ceaselessly to support herself and his nine younger siblings strongly influenced Smiles&#x27;s future life, but he developed a benign and tolerant outlook that was sometimes at odds with that of his Reformed Presbyterian forebears.

In 1838 Smiles was offered the editorship of the reformist paper, the &quot;Leeds Times&quot;. He spent the next twenty years in the city, moving to live on Woodhouse Cliff in 1847.

==Career as a campaigner==
In 1837, he wrote articles for the &quot;Edinburgh Weekly Chronicle&quot; and the Leeds Times, campaigning for parliamentary reform. In November 1838, Smiles was invited to become the editor of the &quot;Leeds Times&quot;, a position he accepted and filled until 1842. In May 1840, Smiles became secretary to the Leeds Parliamentary Reform Association, an organisation that held to the six objectives of Chartism: universal suffrage for all men over the age of 21; equal-sized electoral districts; voting by secret ballot; an end to the need of MPs to qualify for Parliament, other than by winning an election; pay for MPs; and annual Parliaments.

As editor of the &quot;Leeds Times&quot;, he advocated radical causes ranging from women&#x27;s suffrage to free trade and parliamentary reform. By the late 1840s, however, Smiles became concerned about the advocation of physical force by Chartists Feargus O&#x27;Connor and George Julian Harney, although he seems to have agreed with them that the movement&#x27;s current tactics were not effective, saying that &quot;mere political reform will not cure the manifold evils which now afflict society&quot;.

On 7 December 1843, Samuel married Sarah Ann Holmes Dixon in Leeds. They had three daughters and two sons.

In 1845, he left the &quot;Leeds Times&quot; and became a secretary for the newly formed Leeds &amp; Thirsk Railway. After nine years, he worked for the South Eastern Railway.

In the 1850s, Smiles abandoned his interest in parliament and decided that self-help was the most important place of reform. In 1859, he published his book &quot;Self-Help; with Illustrations of Character and Conduct&quot;.

Smiles wrote articles for the &quot;Quarterly&quot;. In an article on railways, he argued that the railways should be nationalised and that third-class passengers should be encouraged. In 1861 Smiles published an article from the &quot;Quarterly&quot;, renamed &quot;Workers Earnings, Savings, and Strikes&quot;. He claimed poverty in many instances was caused by habitual improvidence:
In 1866, Smiles became president of the National Provident Institution but left in 1871, after suffering a debilitating stroke.

The Globe Permanent Benefit Building Society 493 New Cross Road Deptford SE14 Founded 1868 Incorporated 1878. Founded for the mutual benefit of investors and borrowers with the approval of the late Samuel Smiles. The 50th Anniversary Jubilee Report (1 August 1918) states that he was a founding Director and was involved for 3 years. All founders lived in Deptford or the neighbourhood as did the ten successors. 

==Writings==
In 1875, his book &quot;Thrift&quot; was published. In it, he said that &quot;riches do not constitute any claim to distinction. It is only the vulgar who admire riches as riches&quot;. He claimed that the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 was &quot;one of the most valuable that has been placed on the statute-book in modern times&quot;. He also criticised &quot;laissez-faire&quot;:
In 1871, he edited the letters written by his son, Samuel Smiles Jr (Born 1852), and sent home during his teenage sea voyage (taken for his health), as well as the log he kept of his journey to Australia and the United States between February 1869 and March 1871, and published them in London in book form, under the title &quot;A Boy&#x27;s Voyage Round the World&quot;.

In 1881 he claimed:
==&quot;Self-Help&quot;==
Smiles was not very successful in his careers as a doctor and journalist. He joined several cooperative ventures, but they failed for lack of capital. Disillusioned, he turned away from middle-class utopianism. He finally found intellectual refuge and national fame in the isolation of self-help.

The origins of his most famous book, &quot;Self-Help&quot;, lay in a speech he gave in March 1845 in response to a request by a Mutual Improvement Society, published as, &quot;The Education of the Working Classes&quot;. In it Smiles said:
The newly founded Routledge publishing house rejected publishing &quot;Self-Help&quot; in 1855. Twenty years later Smiles was seated next to George Routledge at a dinner, and he said to him, &quot;And when, Dr. Smiles, are we to have the honour of publishing one of your books?&quot;; Smiles replied that Mr. Routledge already had the honour of rejecting &quot;Self-Help&quot;. Although John Murray was willing to publish &quot;Self-Help&quot; on a half-profits system, Smiles rejected this as he did not want the book to lose its anecdotes. In 1859, Smiles self-published the book, retaining the copyright, while he paid John Murray a ten per cent commission. It sold 20,000 copies within one year of its publication. By the time of Smiles&#x27;s death in 1904 it had sold over a quarter of a million copies. &quot;Self-Help&quot; &quot;elevated [Smiles] to celebrity status: almost overnight, he became a leading pundit and much-consulted guru&quot;. Smiles &quot;suddenly became the fashion and he was deluged with requests that he should lay foundation stones, sit for his portrait, present prizes to orphan children, make speeches from platforms. The simple fellow was pleased with these invitations, but naturally he could not accept. He had his work to do ... his duty did not lie on any public platform ... It lay in his office with his Work&quot;.

==&quot;Conduct&quot; manuscript==
Smiles intended to publish a book titled &quot;Conduct&quot;, in 1896. He submitted it to his publisher, but John Murray declined to publish the book. In 1898, publication was denied again.

After the death of Smiles in 1904, the manuscript of &quot;Conduct&quot; was found in his desk and, on the advice of John Murray, was destroyed. No copy is known to exist.

==Later life, death and descendants==
Sir George Reid was commissioned to paint Smiles&#x27;s portrait, completed in 1877 and now in the collection of the National Gallery, London. Copies of his handwriting can be found in the archives of East Lothian Council.

When, in 1892, William Gladstone returned to power and, as prime minister, introduced his Second Irish Home Rule Bill, Smiles wrote to his son in Ulster: &quot;Don&#x27;t you rebel. Keep quiet, though I see your name among the agitators ... Your letter is frightfully alarming ... Gladstone has come into power and we are threatened with Civil War. This cannot be the result of good statesmanship. Yet there are Liberal members to cheer on the maniac. Alas, alas for Liberalism! ... Must I give you six months notice to withdraw my loans to the B.R. Co., for I want to keep the little money I have for wife and bairns, not for arming the Ulstermen&quot;. Smiles wrote to Lucy Smiles in 1893, &quot;This Home Rule Bill is horrid  ... I am quite appalled at that wretched hound, miscalled statesman, throwing the country into a state of turmoil. I cannot understand how so many persons in this part of Britain follow that maniac, just like a flock of sheep. He is simply bursting with self-conceit. Alas! Alas for Liberalism!&quot;

On 16 April 1904, Samuel Smiles died in Kensington in his 92nd year, London and was buried in Brompton Cemetery. Shortly before his death, he was reportedly offered a knighthood, which he declined to accept.

Smiles&#x27;s grandchildren include Sir Walter Smiles, an Ulster Unionist Party MP. Through that branch of the family, Smiles is also the great-great-grandfather of Bear Grylls, a well-known adventurer.
==Legacy==
&quot;Self-Help&quot; has been called &quot;the bible of mid-Victorian liberalism&quot;, and it raised Smiles to celebrity status almost overnight.

The Liberal MP J. A. Roebuck in 1862 called Smiles&#x27;s &quot;Workmen&#x27;s Earnings, Strikes and Savings&quot; &quot;a very remarkable book&quot; and quoted passages from it in a speech.

George Bernard Shaw, in his &quot;Fabian Essays in Socialism&quot; (1889), called Smiles &quot;that modern Plutarch&quot;.

American inspirational writer Orison Swett Marden was inspired by Samuel Smiles as a result of having read &quot;Self-Help&quot; during his youth. Decades later, he wrote &quot;Pushing to the Front&quot; (1894) and became a professional author as a result of Smiles&#x27;s influence.

The late nineteenth century and early twentieth century saw the rise of New Liberalism, Keynesian economics, and socialism, which all viewed thrift unfavourably. The New Liberal economists J. A. Hobson and A. F. Mummery in their &quot;Physiology of Industry&quot; (1889), claimed that saving resulted in the underemployment of capital and labour during trade depressions. &quot;General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot; (1936) by John Maynard Keynes, attempted to replace classical liberal economics.

Building societies adopted the message of being thrifty to self-improve represented in &quot;Thrift&quot;. In 1897, The Halifax printed the &quot;Misery Leaflet&quot; in which a worn-out house and a well-off house are each illustrated next to each other under the labels &quot;Want of Thrift&quot; and &quot;Thrift&quot;. The leaflet has &quot;Little and often fills the purse.&quot;, &quot;Before you marry have a house to live in.&quot;, and &quot;Providence will thrive where genius will starve. When fortune smiles take the advantage.&quot; written on the margins. In reality, the majority of people could not save because banks did not accept small deposits at the time.

In 1905, William Boyd Carpenter, Bishop of Ripon, praised Smiles: &quot;The Bishop said he had noticed a little tendency in some quarters to disparage the homely energies of life which at one time were so highly thought of. He recalled the appearance of &quot;Self-Help&quot;, by Samuel Smiles, who 40 or 50 years ago gave lectures at Leeds encouraging young men to engage in self-improvement. His books were read with extraordinary avidity, but there arose a school which taught the existence of the beautiful and to do nothing. That school disparaged thrift and did not pay much attention to character and, perhaps, not much attention to duty&quot;.

The Labour MP David Grenfell, in a debate on the Transitional Payments (Determination of Need) Bill, claimed that the 1932 bill &quot;discriminated not against the unthrifty, the idler, and the waster, but against the industrious, thrifty person, who had to pay a heavy penalty. The Minister of Labour penalized self-help. He poured contempt on Samuel Smiles and all his works&quot;.

The liberal Ernest Benn invoked Smiles in 1949 when praising the virtues of self-help.

In 1962, the director of the British Institute of Management, John Marsh, said that young men who entered industry needed a sense of service and duty; they must be &quot;men of character who know how to behave well as in phases of success&quot;; they must possess self-discipline in thinking and behaviour: &quot;There is something still to be said for Samuel Smiles&#x27;s doctrine of self-help&quot;.

The liberal economist F. A. Hayek wrote in 1976 that: &quot;It is probably a misfortune that, especially in the USA, popular writers like Samuel Smiles...have defended free enterprise on the ground that it regularly rewards the deserving, and it bodes ill for the future of the market order that this seems to have become the only defence of it which is understood by the general public. That it has largely become the basis of the self-esteem of the businessman often gives him an air of self-righteousness which does not make him more popular&quot;.

<doc id="160963" wikidata="Q1228792" url="?curid=160963" title="Five-number summary">
<text>The five-number summary is a set of descriptive statistics that provides information about a dataset. It consists of the five most important sample percentiles:
# the sample minimum &quot;(smallest observation)&quot;
# the lower quartile or &quot;first quartile&quot;
# the median (the middle value)
# the upper quartile or &quot;third quartile&quot;
# the sample maximum (largest observation)

In addition to the median of a single set of data there are two related statistics called the upper and lower quartiles. If data are placed in order, then the lower quartile is central to the lower half of the data and the upper quartile is central to the upper half of the data. These quartiles are used to calculate the interquartile range, which helps to describe the spread of the data, and determine whether or not any data points are outliers.

In order for these statistics to exist, the observations must be from a univariate variable that can be measured on an ordinal, interval or ratio scale.

==Use and representation==
The five-number summary provides a concise summary of the distribution of the observations. Reporting five numbers avoids the need to decide on the most appropriate summary statistic. The five-number summary gives information about the location (from the median), spread (from the quartiles) and range (from the sample minimum and maximum) of the observations. Since it reports order statistics (rather than, say, the mean) the five-number summary is appropriate for ordinal measurements, as well as interval and ratio measurements.

It is possible to quickly compare several sets of observations by comparing their five-number summaries, which can be represented graphically using a boxplot.

In addition to the points themselves, many L-estimators can be computed from the five-number summary, including interquartile range, midhinge, range, mid-range, and trimean.

The five-number summary is sometimes represented as in the following table: 
==Example==
This example calculates the five-number summary for the following set of observations: 0, 0, 1, 2, 63, 61, 27, 13.
These are the number of moons of each planet in the Solar System.

It helps to put the observations in ascending order: 0, 0, 1, 2, 13, 27, 61, 63. There are eight observations, so the median is the mean of the two middle numbers, (2 + 13)/2 = 7.5. Splitting the observations either side of the median gives two groups of four observations. The median of the first group is the lower or first quartile, and is equal to (0 + 1)/2 = 0.5. The median of the second group is the upper or third quartile, and is equal to (27 + 61)/2 = 44.
The smallest and largest observations are 0 and 63.

So the five-number summary would be 0, 0.5, 7.5, 44, 63.

===Example in R===
It is possible to calculate the five-number summary in the R programming language using the codice_1 function. The codice_2 function, when applied to a vector, displays the five-number summary together with the mean (which is not itself a part of the five-number summary). The codice_1 uses a different method to calculate percentiles than the codice_2 function.
===Example in Python===
This python example uses the codice_5 function from the numerical library codice_6 and works in Python 2 and 3. 

import numpy as np

def fivenum(data):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Five-number summary.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 return np.percentile(data, [0, 25, 50, 75, 100], method=&quot;midpoint&quot;)
»&gt; moons = [0, 0, 1, 2, 63, 61, 27, 13]
»&gt; print(fivenum(moons))
[ 0. 0.5 7.5 44. 63. ]
=== Example in SAS ===
You can use codice_7 in SAS to get the five number summary:

data fivenum;
input x @@;
datalines;
1 2 3 4 20 202 392 4 38 20
run;

ods select Quantiles;
proc univariate data = fivenum;
 output out = fivenums min = min Q1 = Q1 Q2 = median Q3 = Q3 max = max;
run;

proc print data = fivenums;
run;
=== Example in Stata ===
input byte y
0 
0 
1 
2 
63 
61 
27 
13
end 
list

tabstat y, statistics (min q max)

<text>John Graham Mellor (21 August 1952 – 22 December 2002), known professionally as Joe Strummer, was a British musician. He was the co-founder, lyricist, rhythm guitarist, and lead vocalist of punk rock band the Clash, formed in 1976. The Clash&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Give &#x27;Em Enough Rope&quot; (1978), reached No. 2 on the UK charts. Soon after, they achieved success in the US, starting with &quot;London Calling&quot; (1979) and peaking with &quot;Combat Rock&quot; (1982), which reached No. 7 on the US charts and was certified 2× platinum there. The Clash&#x27;s explosive political lyrics, musical experimentation, and rebellious attitude greatly influenced rock music in general, especially alternative rock. Their music incorporated punk with reggae, ska, dub, funk, rap and rockabilly.

Strummer&#x27;s other career highlights included stints with the 101ers, the Latino Rockabilly War, the Mescaleros and the Pogues, as well as solo music. His work as a musician allowed him to explore other interests such as acting, scoring television shows and films, and hosting the BBC Radio show &quot;London Calling&quot;. Strummer and the Clash were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 2003. In his remembrance, Strummer&#x27;s friends and family established the Joe Strummer Foundation (initially known as Strummerville), a non-profit organisation that gives opportunities to musicians and supports projects around the world that create empowerment through music.

==Early life==
Strummer was born John Graham Mellor in Ankara, Turkey, on 21 August 1952, the son of a Scottish mother and English father. His mother, Anna Mackenzie (1915–1986), was the daughter of a crofter and was born and raised in Bonar Bridge; she later became a nurse. His father, Ronald Ralph Mellor MBE (1916–1984), was born in Lucknow, India, where his father worked as a railway official and became a clerical officer who later attained the rank of second secretary in the foreign service. Through his father, Strummer had an Armenian great-grandfather and a German great-grandmother. At the age of nine, Strummer and his 10-year-old brother David began boarding at the City of London Freemen&#x27;s School in Surrey and rarely saw their parents during the next seven years. He later said, &quot;[A]t the age of nine I had to say good-bye to them because they went abroad to Africa or something. I went to boarding school and only saw them once a year after that – the Government paid for me to see my parents once a year. I was left on my own, and went to this school where thick rich people sent their thick rich kids. Another perk of my father&#x27;s job – it was a job with a lot of perks – all the fees were paid by the Government.&quot;

Strummer developed a love of rock music by listening to records by Little Richard, the Beach Boys, and Woody Guthrie. Strummer would even go by the nickname &quot;Woody&quot; for a few years. He would later refer to the Beach Boys as &quot;the reason [he] played music&quot;. By 1970, his brother had become estranged from the family. His suicide in July of that year profoundly affected Strummer, as did having to identify his body after it had lain undiscovered for three days. Strummer said, &quot;[David] was a year older than me. Funnily enough, you know, he was a Nazi. He was a member of the National Front. He was into the occult and he used to have these deaths-heads and cross-bones all over everything. He didn&#x27;t like to talk to anybody, and I think suicide was the only way out for him. What else could he have done[?]&quot;

After finishing his time at the City of London Freemen&#x27;s School in 1970, Strummer moved on to the Central School of Art and Design in London, where he briefly considered becoming a professional cartoonist and completed a one-year foundation course. During this time, he shared a flat in Palmers Green with friends Clive Timperley and Tymon Dogg. He said, &quot;I bought a ukulele. No kidding. I saved some money, £1.99 I think, and bought it down Shaftesbury Avenue. Then the guy I was busking with taught me to play &#x27;Johnny B. Goode&#x27;. [...] I was on my own for the first time with this ukulele and &#x27;Johnny B. Goode&#x27;. And that&#x27;s how I started.&quot;

In 1973, Strummer moved to Newport, South Wales. He did not study at Newport College of Art, but he met up with college musicians at the students&#x27; union in Stow Hill and became the vocalist for Flaming Youth before renaming the band the Vultures. The Vultures included three former members of Rip Off Park Rock &amp; Roll Allstars, the original college band co-founded by Terry Earl Taylor. For the next year, Strummer was the band&#x27;s part-time singer and rhythm guitarist. During this time, he also worked as a gravedigger in St Woolos Cemetery. While in Newport, he wrote and recorded on an old reel-to-reel tape recorder &quot;Crumby Bum Blues&quot;, which was later used in Julien Temple&#x27;s 2007 film &quot;Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten&quot;. In 1974, the band fell apart, and Strummer moved back to London, where he met up again with Dogg. He was a street performer for a while and then decided to form another band with his roommates called the 101ers, named after the address of their squat at 101 Walterton Road in Maida Vale. The band played many gigs in London pubs, performing covers of popular American R&amp;B and rock and roll songs. During this period, Strummer worked several occasional temporary jobs to fund the purchase of musical equipment, including time spent as a gardener in Hyde Park &quot;to get the money for the guitar&quot;. 

In 1975, he stopped calling himself Woody Mellor and adopted the stage name Joe Strummer, subsequently insisting that his friends call him by that name. The surname &quot;Strummer&quot; apparently referred to his role as rhythm guitarist in a self-deprecating way. Strummer was the lead singer of the 101ers and began to write original songs for the group. One song he wrote was inspired by the Slits&#x27; drummer Palmolive, who was his girlfriend at the time. The group liked the song &quot;Keys to Your Heart&quot;, which they picked as their first single.

==Career==
=== The Clash (1976–1986) ===

On 3 April 1976, the then-unknown Sex Pistols opened for the 101ers at a venue called the Nashville Room in London, and Strummer was impressed by them. Sometime after the show, Strummer was approached by Bernie Rhodes and Mick Jones. Jones was from the band London SS and wanted Strummer to join as lead singer. Strummer agreed to leave the 101ers and join Jones, bassist Paul Simonon, drummer Terry Chimes and guitarist Keith Levene. The band was named the Clash by Simonon and made their debut on 4 July 1976 in Sheffield, opening for the Sex Pistols at the Black Swan (also known as the Mucky Duck, now known as the Boardwalk). On 25 January 1977, the band signed with CBS Records as a three-piece after Levene was fired from the band and Chimes quit. Topper Headon later became the band&#x27;s full-time drummer.

During his time with the Clash, Strummer, along with his bandmates, became notorious for getting into trouble with the law. On 10 June 1977, he and Headon were arrested for spray-painting the band&#x27;s name on a wall in a hotel. On 20 May 1980, he was arrested for hitting a violent member of the audience with his guitar during a performance in Hamburg, Germany. This incident shocked Strummer, and had a lasting personal impact on him. Strummer said, &quot;It was a watershed—violence had really controlled me for once&quot;. He determined never again to fight violence with violence.

Before the album &quot;Combat Rock&quot; was released in 1982, Strummer went into hiding and the band&#x27;s management said that he had &quot;disappeared&quot;. Bernie Rhodes, the band&#x27;s manager, pressured Strummer to do so because tickets were selling slowly for the Scottish leg of an upcoming tour. It was planned for Strummer to travel, in secret, to Texas and stay with his friend, musician Joe Ely. Uneasy with his decision, Strummer instead decided to genuinely disappear and &quot;dicked around&quot; in France. During this time, Strummer ran the Paris Marathon in April 1982. He claimed his training regimen consisted of 10 pints of beer the night before the race. For this period of time, Strummer&#x27;s whereabouts were a mystery not only to the public, but to the band&#x27;s management as well. Strummer said later that this was a huge mistake and that you &quot;have to have some regrets&quot;. This was in spite of the popular success of the single &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot;. During this time, band members began to argue frequently, and with tensions high, the group began to fall apart.

In September 1983, Strummer issued the infamous &quot;Clash Communique&quot;, and fired Mick Jones. Topper Headon had earlier been kicked out of the band because of his heroin addiction, and Terry Chimes was brought back temporarily to fill his place until the permanent replacement, Pete Howard, could be found. This left the band with only two of its original members, Strummer and Simonon. Rhodes persuaded Strummer to carry on, adding two new guitarists. Under this lineup, they released the album &quot;Cut the Crap&quot; in 1985. The album was panned by fans and critics alike and Strummer disbanded the Clash.

At the band&#x27;s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Clash was said to be &quot;considered one of the most overtly political, explosive and exciting bands in rock and roll history&quot;.

Their songs tackled social decay, unemployment, racism, police brutality, political and social repression, and militarism in detail. Strummer was involved with the Anti-Nazi League and Rock Against Racism campaigns. He later also gave his support to the Rock Against the Rich series of concerts organised by the anarchist organisation Class War. The Clash&#x27;s &quot;London Calling&quot; album was voted best album of the 1980s by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine (although it was released in late 1979 in the UK, it was not released until 1980 in the US).

===Solo career and soundtrack work (1986–1999)===
A year later, Strummer worked on several songs for the 1986 film &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot;, including &quot;Love Kills&quot; and &quot;Dum Dum Club&quot;. Strummer also later worked with Mick Jones and his band Big Audio Dynamite, contributing to the band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;No. 10, Upping St.&quot; (1986), by co-writing most of the songs as well as producing the album along with Jones.

In 1987, he played a small part in the film &quot;Walker&quot;, directed by Alex Cox, as a character named &quot;Faucet&quot; and wrote and performed on the film&#x27;s soundtrack. He starred in another Cox film that same year called &quot;Straight to Hell&quot;, as the character Simms. &quot;Straight to Hell&quot; also featured London-Irish folk/punk band the Pogues, both as actors and contributors to the soundtrack. Strummer joined the Pogues for a tour in 1987/88, filling in for ailing guitarist Philip Chevron, who wrote (in May 2008) on the band&#x27;s online forum: &quot;When I was sick in late 1987, I taught Joe all the guitar parts in an afternoon and he was on tour in the US as deputy guitarist the next day. Joe wrote all the tabs in his meticulously neat hand on a long piece of paper which he taped to the top of the guitar so he could glance down occasionally when he was onstage.&quot; This tour would be the first of several collaborations with the band.

In 1989, Strummer appeared in Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s film &quot;Mystery Train&quot; as a drunken, short-tempered drifter named Johnny (whom most characters refer to as Elvis, much to Johnny&#x27;s dismay). He made a cameo appearance in Aki Kaurismäki&#x27;s 1990 film &quot;I Hired a Contract Killer&quot; as a guitarist in a pub, performing two songs (&quot;Burning Lights&quot; and &quot;Afro-Cuban Bebop&quot;). These were released as a promotional 7-inch single limited to a few hundred copies, credited to &quot;Joe Strummer &amp; the Astro Physicians&quot;. The &quot;Astro Physicians&quot; were in fact the Pogues (&quot;Afro-Cuban Bebop&quot; got a re-release on the Pogues&#x27; 2008 box set). During this time Strummer continued to act, write and produce soundtracks for various films, most notably the soundtrack for &quot;Grosse Pointe Blank&quot; (1997).

In 1989 Strummer produced a solo record with the band the Latino Rockabilly War. The album &quot;Earthquake Weather&quot; was a critical and commercial flop, and resulted in the loss of his contract with Sony Records. He also did the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Permanent Record&quot; with this band.

Strummer was asked by the Pogues, who were fracturing as a band, to help them produce their next album, released in 1990 as &quot;Hell&#x27;s Ditch&quot;. In 1991, he replaced Shane MacGowan as singer of the Pogues for a tour after MacGowan&#x27;s departure from the band. One night of this tour was professionally recorded, and three tracks (&quot;I Fought the Law&quot;, &quot;London Calling&quot;, and &quot;Turkish Song of the Damned&quot;) have seen release as b-sides and again on the Pogues&#x27; 2008 box set.

On 16 April 1994, Strummer joined Czech-American band Dirty Pictures on stage in Prague at the Repre Club in Obecni Dum at &quot;Rock for Refugees&quot;, a benefit concert for people left displaced by the war in Bosnia. Although the set appeared impromptu, Strummer and the band had spent the days leading up to the event rehearsing and &quot;hanging out&quot; in Prague. The show began with &quot;London Calling&quot; and without pause went into &quot;Brand New Cadillac&quot;. In the middle of the song, the power went out. Once the power was back on, Strummer asked the audience whether or not they would mind if the band started over. They then began again with &quot;London Calling&quot; and continued on for another half-hour.

After these self-described &quot;wilderness years&quot;, Strummer began working with other bands; he played piano on the 1995 UK hit of the Levellers, &quot;Just the One&quot; and appeared on the Black Grape single &quot;England&#x27;s Irie&quot; in 1996. In 1997, while in New York City, he worked with noted producer and engineer Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry on remixed Clash and 101ers reissue dub material. In collaboration with percussionist Pablo Cook, Strummer wrote and performed the soundtrack to &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; (Robert Wallace 1997) that was featured in the Cannes Film Festival in the same year.

In 1997, Strummer played the character of &quot;Brand New Cadillac&quot; songwriter Vince Taylor in &#x27;s road movie .

In 1998, he made a guest appearance on the animated television show, &quot;South Park&quot; and appeared on the album &quot;Chef Aid: The South Park Album&quot; featuring songs from and inspired by the series.

During this time, Strummer was engaged in a legal dispute with the Clash&#x27;s record label, Epic Records. The disagreement lasted nearly eight years and ended with the label agreeing to let him record solo records with another label. If the Clash were to reunite though, they would have to record for Sony. During the nineties, Strummer was a DJ on the BBC World Service with his half-hour programme &quot;London Calling&quot;. Samples from the series provide the vocals for &quot;Midnight Jam&quot; on Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros&#x27; final album &quot;Streetcore&quot;.

===The Mescaleros and other work (1999–2002)===

In the mid-to-late 1990s, Strummer gathered top-flight musicians into a backing band he called the Mescaleros. Strummer and the band signed with Mercury Records, and released their first album in 1999, which was co-written with Antony Genn, called &quot;Rock Art and the X-Ray Style&quot;. A tour of England, Europe, and North America soon followed.


In 2001, the band signed with Californian punk label Hellcat Records and released their second studio album, &quot;Global a Go-Go&quot;. The album was supported with a 21-date tour of North America, Britain, and Ireland. Once again, these concerts featured Clash material (&quot;London&#x27;s Burning&quot;, &quot;Rudie Can&#x27;t Fail&quot;, &quot;(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais&quot;), as well as covers of reggae and ska hits (&quot;The Harder They Come&quot;, &quot;A Message to You, Rudy&quot;) and the band regularly closed the show by playing the Ramones&#x27; &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot;. He covered Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;Redemption Song&quot; with Johnny Cash.

On 15 November 2002, Strummer and the Mescaleros played a benefit show for striking fire fighters in London, at Acton Town Hall. Mick Jones was in the audience, and joined the band on stage during the Clash&#x27;s &quot;Bankrobber&quot;. An encore followed with Jones playing guitar and singing on &quot;White Riot&quot; and &quot;London&#x27;s Burning&quot;. This performance marked the first time since 1983 that Strummer and Jones had performed together on stage.

Strummer&#x27;s final regular gig was at Liverpool Academy on 22 November 2002, yet his final performance, just two weeks before his death, was in a small club venue &#x27;The Palace&#x27; in Bridgwater, Somerset, near his home. Shortly before his death, Strummer and U2&#x27;s Bono co-wrote a song, &quot;46664&quot;, for Nelson Mandela as part of a campaign against AIDS in Africa.

==Personal life==
Strummer became a vegetarian in 1971, and remained so until his death in 2002.

In 1975, Strummer accepted £120 () to marry South African citizen Pamela Moolman so she could obtain British citizenship (before the British Nationality Act 1981 came into force) by doing so. He used the money to buy his signature Fender Telecaster. In 1978, he started a relationship with Gaby Salter shortly after her 17th birthday. The couple remained together for 14 years and had two daughters, Jazz and Lola, but did not marry as Strummer had been unable to locate and divorce Moolman. During his relationship with Salter, he had multiple affairs. In 1993, he began an affair with Lucinda Tait, which finally ended his relationship with Salter. He was married to Tait from 1995 until his death in 2002.

Strummer described himself as a socialist and explained, &quot;I believe in socialism because it seems more humanitarian, rather than every man for himself and &#x27;I&#x27;m alright Jack&#x27; and all those arsehole businessmen with all the loot. I made up my mind from viewing society from that angle. That&#x27;s where I&#x27;m from and there&#x27;s where I&#x27;ve made my decisions from. That&#x27;s why I believe in socialism.&quot;

==Death==
On 22 December 2002, aged 50, Strummer was found dead by his wife at his home in Broomfield, Somerset. An autopsy showed that he died from a heart attack caused by an undiagnosed congenital heart defect. His estate was valued at just under £1 million, and he left all the money to Tait, his wife. Strummer was cremated, and his ashes were given to his family.

==Legacy==
At the time of his death, Strummer was working on another Mescaleros album, which was released posthumously in October 2003 under the title &quot;Streetcore&quot;. The album features a tribute to Johnny Cash, &quot;Long Shadow&quot;, which was written for Cash to sing and recorded in Rick Rubin&#x27;s garage, as well as a remembrance of the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 (&quot;Ramshackle Day Parade&quot;), and a cover of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;Redemption Song&quot;, which Strummer had also recorded as a duet with Cash. The Cash/Strummer duet version appears on the 2003 box set &quot;Unearthed&quot;. Strummer and the Mescaleros were scheduled to open for Pearl Jam on the 2003 Riot Act Tour.
In November 2003, a video for &quot;Redemption Song&quot; was released, featuring graffiti artist REVOLT painting a memorial mural of Strummer on the wall of the Niagara Bar in the East Village of New York City. In 2013, the mural was destroyed due to construction; a new mural was unveiled that September, accompanied by a large celebration with Mick Jones in attendance.

Strummer was instrumental in setting up Future Forests (since rechristened the Carbon Neutral Company), dedicated to planting trees in various parts of the world to combat global warming. Strummer was the first artist to make the recording, pressing and distribution of his records carbon neutral through the planting of trees. In his remembrance, Strummer&#x27;s friends and family have established the Strummerville Foundation for the promotion of new music, which holds an annual festival with the same name. In December 2016, a blue plaque was erected by Seymour Housing Co-operative at 33 Daventry Street near Marylebone station where he used to live when it was a squat and the Slits and Malcolm McLaren all lived nearby.

In January 2003, the Clash were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. At the Grammy Awards in February 2003, &quot;London Calling&quot; was performed by Elvis Costello, Bruce Springsteen, Steven Van Zandt, Dave Grohl, Pete Thomas, and Tony Kanal in tribute to Strummer. In the same month at the rock club Debaser in Stockholm some of Sweden&#x27;s better known rock musicians paid their tribute to Strummer by performing songs written by the Clash (the exception was Nicke Borg and Dregen from Backyard Babies, who performed &quot;I Fought the Law&quot;, which the Clash had covered). At the end of the concert, the Swedish punk band Ebba Grön reunited for the tribute, aided by Mick Jones on guitar.

On 22 December 2003, a year after his death, a tribute show/benefit was held at Irving Plaza in NYC. Bands that played were: Ari Up; Clem Snide; the Detachment Kit; Dirty Mary; Hammel on Trial; Jesse Malin; New Blood Revival; the Realistics; Eugene Hütz; Radio 4; Secret Army; Ted Leo; Vic Thrill &amp; the Saturn Missile.

The Belfast punk rock group Stiff Little Fingers recorded a tribute song &quot;Strummerville&quot; on their 2003 album, &quot;Guitar and Drum&quot;. In 2004 Al Barr, lead singer of the Boston punk band Dropkick Murphys, named his son Strummer in honour of Strummer. German band Beatsteaks paid tribute to Strummer on their 2004 album &quot;Smack Smash&quot; with the song &quot;Hello Joe&quot;. In 2004, German punk band Die Toten Hosen released an EP called &quot;Friss oder stirb&quot;, which included a tribute song for Strummer called &quot;Goodbye Garageland&quot;; it is a lyrical co-production with Matt Dangerfield from London&#x27;s 77 punk band the Boys. Attila the Stockbroker&#x27;s Barnstormer released &quot;Comandante Joe&quot; on their 2004 album &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot;.

In February 2005 Cotswold Rail locomotive 47828 was named &quot;Joe Strummer&quot; by his widow Lucinda Tait at Bristol Temple Meads railway station. On 22 July 2005 Tait unveiled a plaque on the house in Pentonville, Newport where Strummer lived from 1973 to 1974 and where his first foray into recorded music, &quot;Crummy Bum Blues&quot; was recorded. &quot;That Was Clash Radio&quot;, a 2005 short story which Charles de Lint, wrote in response to Strummer&#x27;s death featuring Strummer in a minor role.

New Orleans–based rockers Cowboy Mouth released a song called &quot;Joe Strummer&quot; on their 2006 album &quot;Voodoo Shoppe&quot;. The Red Hot Chili Peppers also recorded a tribute song called &quot;Joe&quot; as part of the recording sessions for their album &quot;Stadium Arcadium&quot;, releasing the outtake as a B-side to their single &quot;Desecration Smile&quot; in 2007. A play by Paul Hodson called &quot;Meeting Joe Strummer&quot; premiered at the 2006 Edinburgh Festival, and toured the UK the following year.
In conjunction with the Strummer estate, Fender released the Joe Strummer Tribute Telecaster in 2007, combining elements of Strummer&#x27;s main guitars, namely an attempt at the &quot;road worn&quot; finish of his 1966 Telecaster, which he used until his death. The neck profile was an exact duplicate of Strummer&#x27;s &#x27;66 Telecaster, while the guitar&#x27;s finish was an approximation of the wear. The first 1,500 guitars came with a Shepard Fairey designed &quot;Customisation kit&quot; with stickers and stencils, which resembled some of the designs Strummer used on his guitars.

Boston punk rock band Street Dogs recorded a tribute song called &quot;The General&#x27;s Boombox&quot; on their 2007 album &quot;State of Grace&quot;. New Jersey&#x27;s the Gaslight Anthem recorded the song &quot;I&#x27;da Called You Woody, Joe&quot; on their 2008 album &quot;Sink or Swim&quot;. The Hold Steady reference Strummer&#x27;s impact in the song &quot;Constructive Summer&quot; on their 2008 album &quot;Stay Positive&quot;, singing &quot;Raise a toast to Saint Joe Strummer. I think he might have been our only decent teacher.&quot; In November 2009, Tonara, a town in Sardinia, Italy, dedicated a street to Joe Strummer.

On 22 December 2010, CJAM 99.1 FM, a radio station in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, declared the anniversary of Strummer&#x27;s death &quot;Joe Strummer Day to confront poverty in Windsor-Detroit.&quot; For 24-hours, the station played nothing but Strummer-related music, wrapping the sounds around reports about poverty in the Windsor-Detroit region. CJAM (which is located near the banks of the Detroit River, a kilometre from downtown Detroit) has since decided to make it an annual event and hosted its 10th annual Joe Strummer Day on 22 December 2019.

In January 2011 a motion was started to grant Strummer his own street in the Spanish city of Granada.

On 21 August 2012, which would have been Strummer&#x27;s 60th birthday, Hellcat Records released an exclusive 57-song digital download album titled &quot;Joe Strummer &amp; the Mescaleros: The Hellcat Years&quot;. The album features Strummer&#x27;s three Hellcat albums along with various b-sides and live songs, including Strummer&#x27;s 15 November 2002 concert with Mick Jones. In September 2012, Hellcat announced the re-release of remastered versions of Strummer&#x27;s three Hellcat records on both CD and vinyl. Hellcat released Strummer&#x27;s 15 November 2002 concert, &quot;Live at Acton Town Hall&quot; on 23 November 2012.
In 2012, marking 25 years of Childline (the free counselling service for children and young people in the UK), BT commissioned artists to design and decorate full-sized K6 red telephone box replicas, with Strummer featuring in an artwork titled &quot;London Calling&quot;.

In January 2013 Joe Strummer had a plaza named in his honour, Placeta Joe Strummer, in the Spanish city of Granada, about 650m south of the Alhambra. In June 2013 a mural of Strummer was unveiled on the corner of Portobello Road and Blenheim Crescent and attended by a number of Strummer&#x27;s former friends including Mick Jones and Ray Gange. In an October 2013 interview, Mick Jones confirmed that Strummer had intentions of reforming the Clash and new music was even being written. In the months prior to Strummer&#x27;s death, he and Jones got together to write new music. Jones said at the time he assumed the new songs would be used on albums with the Mescaleros. A few months following their work together, Jones ran into Strummer at an event and asked him what he intended to do with those songs. Strummer informed Jones that they were going to be used for the next Clash record.

In 2016, actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers portrayed Strummer in the film &quot;London Town&quot; which tells the story of a Clash-obsessed teenager who crosses paths with Joe Strummer by happenstance in 1979 and finds his life changing as a result. The film was met with mostly negative reviews.

It was discovered following Strummer&#x27;s death that he was an archivist of his own work, having barns full of writings and tapes. Over 20,000 items were stored in the Joe Strummer archive and on 28 September 2018, a 32-song compilation album titled &quot;Joe Strummer 001&quot; was released. The album, which was overseen by Strummer&#x27;s widow, Lucinda, and producer Robert Gordon McHarg III, features 32 songs, 12 of which had never been released. The set spans Strummer&#x27;s career from the 101ers to the Mescaleros and features some unheard demos from the Clash following the departure of Mick Jones, along with an unreleased song recorded by Jones and Strummer in 1986. The set also features two of Strummer&#x27;s final recordings.

In September 2018, Warner/Chappell Music signed a publishing contract with the Strummer estate. The deal includes Strummer&#x27;s solo career, &quot;Cut the Crap&quot; by the Clash, the soundtracks to three films, and his compositions with the 101ers and the Mescaleros.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Strummer at number 125 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

==Musical equipment==

Strummer&#x27;s main guitar throughout his career was a 1966 Fender Telecaster. Strummer bought the guitar in its original sunburst finish in 1975, with the £120 he was paid to marry Afrikaaner Pamela Moolman, thereby allowing Moolman to remain in Britain. After joining the Clash, the guitar&#x27;s body and pickguard were refinished in grey auto primer and then painted black. Over the years, the guitar would see numerous sticker configurations, with the most prominent and longest-lasting one stating &quot;Ignore Alien Orders&quot;. Years of heavy wear and taped on set lists remain on the guitar to this day, and the only known modifications to it included the installation of an individual, six-saddle bridge, and Fender &quot;f-style&quot; tuning machines.

The Fender Custom Shop created a Joe Strummer tribute Telecaster in 2007 with a reliced flat black finish and an exact replica of the neck profile of his &#x27;66 Telecaster.

Strummer was naturally left-handed, but was taught to play guitar right-handed by his friend Tymon Dogg. Strummer had reckoned his left-handedness on a right-hand guitar as a drawback and claimed it caused him to be underdeveloped as a guitarist, although his style of playing was unique.

He also used three Fender Esquire models, one from 1952, a white blonde with slab fretboard from the mid-1950s and another from early to mid-1960s with a white pick guard and rosewood fingerboard. The Esquire is a one-pickup version of the Telecaster. Prior to using any Telecaster oriented guitar, before buying his 1966 model, he used as main guitars a Gretsch White Falcon and a 1964 Hofner Verithin. For amplification Strummer was known to use amplifiers such as a Roland Jazz Chorus, a Selmer Bassman while he was in the 101ers, a Vox AC30 and various Marshall amplifiers, but his main amplifier was a Music Man HD 212,150. Strummer commented on his choice of amplifier with &quot;I don&#x27;t have time to search for those old Fender tube amps. The Music Man is the closest thing to that sound I&#x27;ve found&quot; and that the &quot;plastic motif on the front is repulsive.&quot;

<text>The State Council Information Office (SCIO) is the chief information office of the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and an external name of the Central Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party.

Historically, SCIO was the external name of the Office of External Propaganda (OEP) of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under an arrangement termed &quot;one institution with two names.&quot; In 2014, OEP was absorbed into the Central Propaganda Department, turning SCIO into an external nameplate.

== History ==
The SCIO was formed in 1991 when the CCP Central Committee decided that the External Propaganda Leading Group () of the CCP Central Committee should have the name of State Council Information Office externally. The External Propaganda Leading Group was transformed into the Office of External Propaganda (OEP, ), officially called in English as the International Communications Office. The office was created with the goal of improving the Chinese government&#x27;s international image following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. According to scholar Anne-Marie Brady, the SCIO became a separate unit from the CCP Central Propaganda Department but still connected to it and was the &quot;public face of this new direction in foreign propaganda work.&quot;

In May 2014, the OEP was formally abolished, with its functions absorbed into the CCP&#x27;s Central Propaganda Department. The SCIO turned into an external nameplate for the Propaganda Department, used primarily for activities of one of its bureaus. In September 2018, the Press Conference Hall of the SCIO from 225 Chaoyangmennei Street, Dongcheng District to the Beijing Telegraph Building in 11 West Chang’an Avenue, Xicheng District.

== Structure ==
Before its absorption to the Propaganda Department, the OEP had nine functional bureaus, with corresponding ones in the SCIO, as well as supervised organs. It oversaw the China Foreign Languages Publishing Administration, while its seventh bureau oversaw the China Society for Human Rights Studies (CSHRS), a front group established in 1993 dealing with human rights-related narratives towards China.

The SCIO oversees the China Internet Information Center. The SCIO formerly had responsibility for internet censorship in China, with its Internet Affairs Bureau overseeing internet censorship and the suppression of &quot;disruptive&quot; activity on the web in mainland China. In May 2011, the SCIO transferred the offices, namely its fifth and ninth bureaus, which regulated the internet to a new subordinate agency, the State Internet Information Office (SIIO). In May 2014, with the abolishment of the OEP, the SIIO (renamed in English as the Cyberspace Administration of China) was absorbed into the newly established Central Leading Group for Cybersecurity and Informatization.

Since the 2014 merger SCIO&#x27;s nine bureaus are now controlled by the Central Propaganda Department, sometimes used by the department&#x27;s bureaus as external nameplates. 

== List of directors ==
Every SCIO director except Zhao Qizheng have also served as deputy heads of the Central Propaganda Department.

<doc id="160970" wikidata="Q7363315" url="?curid=160970" title="Literal and figurative language">
<text>The distinction between literal and figurative language exists in all natural languages; the phenomenon is studied within certain areas of language analysis, in particular stylistics, rhetoric, and semantics. 
*Literal language is the usage of words exactly according to their direct, straightforward, or conventionally accepted meanings: their denotation.
*Figurative (or non-literal) language is the usage of words in a way that deviates from referencing just their conventionally accepted definitions - in order to convey a more complex meaning or a heightened effect. It is often created by language-users by presenting words in such a way that they are equated, compared, or associated by recipients with normally unrelated meanings. A common intended effect of figurative language is to elicit audience responses that are more emotional (like excitement, shock, laughter, etc.), aesthetic, or intellectual.

Literal usage confers meaning to words, in the sense of the meaning words have by themselves, for example as defined in a dictionary. It maintains a consistent meaning regardless of the context, with the intended meaning of a phrase corresponding exactly to the meaning of its individual words. On the other hand, figurative use of language (a later offshoot being the term &quot;figure of speech&quot;) is the use of words or phrases with a meaning that does make literal sense but that encourages certain mental associations or reflects a certain type of truth, perhaps a more artistically presented one.

The Ancient Greek philosopher of rhetoric Aristotle and later the Roman rhetorician Quintilian were among the early documented language analysts who expounded on the differences between literal and figurative language. A comprehensive scholarly examination of metaphor in antiquity, and the way its use was fostered by Homer&#x27;s epic poems &quot;The Iliad&quot; and &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, is provided by William Bedell Stanford, &quot;Greek Metaphor&quot;,

Frances Brooke&#x27;s 1769 novel &quot;The History of Emily Montague&quot; was used in the earliest &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED) citation for the figurative sense of &quot;literally&quot;; the sentence from the novel used was: &quot;He is a fortunate man to be introduced to such a party of fine women at his arrival; it is literally &quot;to feed among the lilies&quot;.&quot; This citation was also used in the OED&#x27;s 2011 revision.

Within literary analysis, the terms &quot;literal&quot; and &quot;figurative&quot; are still used; but within the fields of cognition and linguistics, the basis for identifying such a distinction is no longer used.

==Figurative language==

Uses of figurative language, or figures of speech, can take multiple forms, such as simile, metaphor, hyperbole, and many others. &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Encyclopedia of Literature&quot; says that figurative language can be classified in five categories: resemblance or relationship, emphasis or understatement, figures of sound, verbal games, and errors.

A simile is a comparison of two things, indicated by some connective, usually &quot;like&quot;, &quot;as&quot;, &quot;than&quot;, or a verb such as &quot;resembles&quot; to show how they are similar.

: Example: &quot;His cheeks were &quot;like roses&quot;, his nose &quot;like a cherry&quot;.../And the beard on his chin was &quot;as white as the snow.&quot;&quot; (emph added)—Clement Clark Moore

A metaphor is a figure of speech in which two &quot;essentially unlike things&quot; are shown to have a type of resemblance or create a new image. The similarities between the objects being compared may be implied rather than directly stated. The literary critic and rhetorician, I. A. Richards, divides a metaphor into two parts: the vehicle and the tenor.
: Example: &quot;Fog comes on little cat feet&quot;—Carl Sandburg In this example, “little cat feet” is the vehicle that clarifies the tenor, “fog.” A comparison between the vehicle and tenor (also called the &quot;teritium comparitionis&quot;) is implicit: fog creeps in silently like a cat.

An extended metaphor is a metaphor that is continued over multiple sentences.
: Example: &quot;The sky steps out of her daywear/Slips into her shot-silk evening dress./An entourage of bats whirr and swing at her hem, ...She&#x27;s tried on every item in her wardrobe.&quot; Dilys Rose

Onomatopoeia is a word designed to be an imitation of a sound.
: Example: “Bark! Bark!” went the dog as he chased the car that vroomed past.

Personification is the attribution of a personal nature or character to inanimate objects or abstract notions, especially as a rhetorical figure.
: Example: &quot;Because I could not stop for Death,/He kindly stopped for me;/The carriage held but just ourselves/And Immortality.&quot;—Emily Dickinson. Dickinson portrays death as a carriage driver.

An oxymoron is a figure of speech in which a pair of opposite or contradictory terms is used together for emphasis.
: Examples: Organized chaos, Same difference, Bittersweet.

A paradox is a statement or proposition which is self-contradictory, unreasonable, or illogical.
: Example: This statement is a lie.

Hyperbole is a figure of speech which uses an extravagant or exaggerated statement to express strong feelings.
: Example: They had been walking so long that John thought he might drink the entire lake when they came upon it.

Allusion is a reference to a famous character or event.
: Example: A single step can take you through the looking glass if you&#x27;re not careful.

An idiom is an expression that has a figurative meaning often related, but different from the literal meaning of the phrase.
:Example: You should keep your eye out for him.

A pun is an expression intended for a humorous or rhetorical effect by exploiting different meanings of words.
: Example: I wondered why the ball was getting bigger. Then it hit me.

==Standard pragmatic model of comprehension==
Prior to the 1980s, the &quot;standard pragmatic&quot; model of comprehension was widely believed. In that model, it was thought the recipient would first attempt to comprehend the meaning as if literal, but when an appropriate literal inference could not be made, the recipient would shift to look for a figurative interpretation that would allow comprehension. Since then, research has cast doubt on the model. In tests, figurative language was found to be comprehended at the same speed as literal language; and so the premise that the recipient was first attempting to process a literal meaning and discarding it before attempting to process a figurative meaning appears to be false.

==Reddy and contemporary views==
Beginning with the work of Michael Reddy in his 1979 work &quot;The Conduit Metaphor&quot;, many linguists now reject that there is a valid way to distinguish between a &quot;literal&quot; and &quot;figurative&quot; mode of language.

<doc id="160976" wikidata="Q2678" url="?curid=160976" title="Gomel">
<text>Gomel (, ) or Homyel (, ) is a city in south-eastern Belarus. It serves as the administrative centre of Gomel Region and Gomel District, though it is administratively separated from the district. As of 2024, it is the second-largest city in Belarus with 501,102 inhabitants.

==Etymology==
There are at least six narratives of the origin of the city&#x27;s name. The most plausible is that the name is derived from the name of the stream Homeyuk, which flowed into the river Sozh near the foot of the hill where the first settlement was founded. Names of other Belarusian cities are formed along these lines: for example, Polotsk from the river Palata, and Vitebsk from the river Vitsba.

The first appearance of the name, as &quot;Gomy&quot;, dates from 1142. Up to the 16th century, the city was mentioned as Hom&#x27;, Homye, Homiy, Homey, or Homyi. These forms are tentatively explained as derivatives of unattested &quot;*gomŭ&quot; of uncertain meaning. The modern name for the city has been in use only since the 16th or 17th century.

==History==
===Kievan Rus&#x27;===

Gomel was founded at the end of the 1st millennium AD on the lands of the Eastern Slavic tribal union of Radimichs. It lay on the banks of the Sozh River and the Homeyuk stream. Sozh&#x27;s high right bank, with bluffs carving through, provided a natural fortification. For some time, Gomel was the capital of the Gomel Principality, before it became part of the Principality of Chernigov. Gomel is first mentioned in the Hypatian Codex under the year 1142 as a territory of the princes of Chernigov. For some time, Gomel was ruled by the prince of Smolensk Rostislav Mstislavich before it was re-captured by Iziaslav III Davidovich, after whose death it belonged to Sviatoslav Olgovich and then to Sviatoslav&#x27;s son Oleg. Under Oleg, Gomel went to the Principality of Novgorod-Seversk. The next ruler was Igor Svyatoslavich—the protagonist of &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;. During this period, the town was a fortified point and the centre of a volost. In the 12th–13th centuries, the city&#x27;s area was no less than 40 ha, and it had developed various crafts and was connected by trading routes with the cities of northern and southern Rus&#x27;. Archeological data have shown that the city was badly damaged during the Mongol-Tatar invasion in the first half of the 13th century.

===Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===
In 1335, the Gomel region was annexed to the Great Duchy of Lithuania by Algirdas. From 1335 to 1406, it was under the ownership of Prince Patricia Narymuntovich and his sons, from 1406 to 1419 the city was ruled by the grand duke&#x27;s deputies, from 1419 to 1435 it belonged to Prince Svitrigaila, from 1446 to 1452 to Prince Vasiliy Yaroslavich, from 1452 to 1483 to the Mozhaysk prince Ivan Andreyevich, and from 1483 to 1505 to his son Semyon, who transferred it to the Grand Principality of Moscow.

During the Second Muscovite–Lithuanian War of 1500–1503, Lithuania tried to regain Gomel and other lands transferred to Moscow, but had suffered defeat and lost one-third of its territory. In 1535, Lithuanian and Polish forces under Jerzy Radvila, Jan Tarnowski and Andrzej Niemirowicz re-captured the city after the surrender of Moscow&#x27;s deputy, D. Shchepin-Obolensky. In the same year, the Great Duke of Lithuania Sigismund Kęstutaitis founded Gomel Starostwo. According to the peace agreement of 1537, Gomel together with its volost remained a Lithuanian possession. In 1535–1565, Gomel was the centre of the starostwo, and from 1565 onwards it was in Rechytsa Powiat of Minsk Voivodeship.
In 1560, the city&#x27;s first coat of arms was introduced. In 1569, Gomel became part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. From this moment on, the city became the arena of numerous attacks and battles between the Cossacks, Russia, and the Polish-Lithuania Commonwealth. In 1572, Gomel Starostwo was given to B. Sapega. At the beginning of the 1570s, Gomel was captured by the forces of Ivan the Terrible, but in 1576 it was re-captured by J. Radvila. In 1581, Gomel was again attacked by Russian troops, and in 1595–1596 it was in the hands of Severyn Nalyvaiko&#x27;s Cossacks.

After the beginning of the struggle against Orthodox Christianity in Lithuania, Orthodox Nikolayevskiy Cathedral was closed, following the order of Greek Catholic Eparch Josaphat Kuntsevych in 1621. In 1633, the city was besieged by Cossacks Bulgakov and Yermolin, in 1648 captured by Golovatskiy&#x27;s Cossack detachment, and in 1649 by Martyn Nebaba&#x27;s detachment. After that, Gomel got through several sieges in 1651 but in 1654 was captured by Ivan Zolotarenko&#x27;s detachment. He and his sons held the city until 1667 and then began to serve under Alexis of Russia, however, after the Truce of Andrusovo Gomel at last returned to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, where it first belonged to M. K. Radvila and then—till the annexation by the Russian Empire—to the Czartoryski family. During the Great Northern War, Russian forces under Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov stood in Gomel. In 1670, Gomel received Magdeburg rights. Towards the middle of the 17th century, the city fell into crisis mainly due to the struggles mentioned above. It suffered significant damage, the population decreased severely, and many crafts disappeared.

=== Russian Empire ===
Gomel became part of the Russian Empire after the first partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772 and was confiscated by the imperial treasury. In 1775, Empress Catherine II gave Gomel and Gomel eldership in the eternal hereditary possession of Russian military commander Pyotr Rumyantsev.
The period when Gomel was part of the Russian Empire was marked by rapid growth of the population, urban infrastructure, and industrial capacity, predominantly after the construction of railways in the late 19th century.

Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral, designed by architect John Clark, was built in 1809–1819. Nikolay Rumyantsev opened the first gymnasium, inn, glass, tile, weaving and spinning factories, and distilleries. Under his patronage a church, a synagogue, a pharmacy, a poorhouse, and a permanent wooden bridge across the Sozh river were built.

After the death of Nikolay Rumyantsev, the city came into the possession of his brother Sergei Petrovich Rumyantsev. However, due to lack of money, Sergei indebted Gomel with the state treasury of the Russian Empire. Subsequently, after not being able to pay off the debt, the treasury sold the city. The Gomel Palace was acquired by Prince Ivan Paskevich, and the rest of the city by Nicholas I (1838). Paskevich had an English garden made around the palace, which is still in place today. In 1856, the estate passed on to his son Fyodor Ivanovich Paskevich.

In 1842, the Prince Józef Poniatowski Monument, one of the most iconic monuments of Warsaw, was relocated from Warsaw to Gomel, before it was restored to Poland in 1922.
In 1852, Gomel became the county town of the former Belitsa County (renamed to Gomel County). This was preceded by the construction of the St. Petersburg–Kiev highway and St. Petersburg–Sebastopol telegraph line, both of which passed through Gomel, and the opening of a beet sugar factory. 

The construction of railways in the territory of Belarus in the late 19th century (Libau–Romny Railway in 1873 and the Polesia railway in 1888) made Gomel a major railway junction and &quot;drew many businessmen to the town, causing the establishment of banks, firms and factories, which in turn changed the pastoral and provincial character of a bygone Gomel into a trading and mercantile one&quot;

By 1913, Gomel had become a major industrial city with 104,500 inhabitants. Nearly 44% of its industrial output was metalworking, with large workshops servicing the rolling stock of the Libau–Romny Railway and the Polesia railway. Other significant industries were woodworking, match manufacturing, breweries, and churning.

=== Civil war and early Soviet era ===
Preceding the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, on 1 March 1918, the city was occupied (the Executive Committee of the Gomel Council of Workers&#x27; Deputies had left already on 21 February) by German forces. In March 1918, the city became part of Chernihiv Governorate of the Ukrainian State.&lt;ref name=&quot;153431/ Contraband&quot;&gt; Contraband, strikes, Bolsheviks ... Ten months of Ukrainian government in Polissya, Ukrayinska Pravda (19 September 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; After the overthrow of the Ukrainian State Gomel was administered by the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic for 25 days.

On 14 January 1919, Gomel was occupied by the Red Army. In March 1919, the largest uprising against the Bolsheviks occurred in Gomel, known as the short-lived Strekopytov Revolt. Rebels seized strategic facilities and executed members of the Soviet leadership in the city. The uprising was crushed by Red Army units dispatched to Gomel.

In 1919, Gomel became the centre of Gomel Governorate in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. After the end of hostilities, the restoration of industry and transportation began. In the 1920s, a number of large businesses were created: shipyards, a factory named &quot;Polespechat&quot;, a shoe factory named &quot;Trud&quot;, a bakery, and the first phase of a municipal power plant. In 1926, the city was passed to the Byelorussian SSR.

By 1940, 264 industrial enterprises had been established.

===World War II===

During World War II, Gomel was under Nazi German occupation from 19 August 1941 until 26 November 1943. The occupiers operated a Nazi prison and forced labour camps for prisoners of war and civilians, part of whom were Jews.

The city was taken by Rokossovsky&#x27;s Belorussian Front during the Gomel–Rechitsa Offensive. Eighty percent of the city had been destroyed, and the population of Gomel had dropped dramatically. According to the data of the registry, it numbered less than 15,000 inhabitants, compared to 144,000 in 1940.

=== Post-war period ===
After the war, the restoration of Gomel began promptly. The majority of pre-revolutionary buildings had been lost. City streets were considerably expanded, and buildings in a Stalinist style were erected. By 1950, almost all of the pre-war enterprises had resumed their work.

===Chernobyl disaster===
As a result of the disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant on 26 April 1986, Gomel suffered radioactive contamination. At the beginning of the 21st century, a research centre for radiation medicine and human ecology was built in Gomel to overcome and study the consequences of the catastrophe at Chernobyl.

The development of radiological dose values varies between individual villages in severely contaminated regions, depending on the surroundings and the economic orientation. In general, living is possible in these areas today, even in formerly closed-off zones, if appropriate dietary rules are observed.

=== Recent history ===

On 27 July 1990, the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic was drafted. Gomel became a city in the independent state of the Republic of Belarus the following year.

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Gomel became an important base for Russian forces.

== Population ==

In 2013, the city&#x27;s population numbered 515,325, indicating a positive population growth and hence a reversal of the demographic crisis that began in 1993.

=== Jewish community ===

After the annexation of Gomel by the Russian Empire and the creation of the Pale of Settlement, Gomel gradually became a centre of resettlement for the Jewish population of Russia. According to the 1897 census, 55% of the population of Gomel were Jews. In 1903, there was a violent pogrom against the Jewish population of the city. From that moment on, a gradual decrease of the number of Jews in the city began. 40,880 Jews lived in Gomel in 1939, when they comprised 29.4% of the total population. Most Jews had left the city in anticipation of German occupation, but still between 3,000 and 4,000 Gomel Jews fell victim to the Holocaust. The end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s saw mass emigration of Jews from Gomel, but at the same time restoration of Jewish institutions in the city by the remaining Jewish inhabitants.

==Geography==

Gomel is situated in the southeastern part of the country, on the right bank of the river Sozh, south-east of Minsk, east of Brest, south of Mogilev, west of Bryansk and north of Chernihiv.

The terrain on which the city as a whole is built, is flat. On the right bank of the river, is a gradually decreasing plain water-glacial and fluvial terrace of the Sozh river. The left bank is a low-lying alluvial plain. The highest elevation of 144 meters above sea level is found on the northern outskirts of Gomel, the lowest elevation of 115 m at the water boundary of the Sozh. Novobelitskiy district, which is located on the left bank of the river (i.e., towards the south), has elevations averaging 10–15 meters lower than the northern and central parts of the city. On the left bank of the Sozh many kilometers of beaches can be found.

Despite the city&#x27;s relatively flat topography, it does have some significant oscillations. For example, the bluffs along the right bank of the Sozh stand out among such natural features with a slope of over 70% in places, and the gypsum stacks of the Gomel Chemical Plant among the manmade ones. The highest mound has a prominence of roughly .

===Climate===

Gomel has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;, Trewartha &quot;Dcbo&quot;). Summers see occasional heat spells in the low and mid 30s, and are comparatively long, lasting from mid-May to early September, with more than 113 days averaging above and highs reaching on roughly 13 days per year. On 7 August 2010, Gomel recorded a temperature of , which is the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Belarus. Like the rest of the central band of the East European Plain, the city has its minimum of relative humidity in May, which results from the rapidly rising temperatures and increased air’s water holding capacity. Unlike the eastern portion thereof, however, it does not have a second minimum in July or August as the temperatures are not high enough to dry out the soil to the extent where evapotranspiration drops significantly, thus preventing the surface layers of the air from moisturizing. Precipitation is common year-round, but even more so in the summer. July in particular brings ample rainfall, often in the form of thunderstorms. Winters, on the other hand, beginning in December and ending in early March, are generally marked by persistently gray skies, subfreezing daily means, and rather moderate snow depths. Thaws are not by any means uncommon and only 48 days throughout the three winter months won’t have temperatures climb above freezing. Based on smoothed daily means, the period of air frost is about 116 days.

Coming with the prevailing westerlies, the frequent invasion of maritime air masses from the Atlantic moderates the climate, explaining the mild winters and relatively cool, somewhat cloudy summers compared to those farther inland. Overall, there is an average of 24 thunderstorms and 42 foggy days annually. Gomel’s bioclimatic type is upper supratemperate subhumid.

==Transportation==

The public transportation system uses over 1,000 buses and trolleybuses. Over 210 million passenger rides were registered in 2006. Taxi services ($10 for a one-way intracity ride) are available 24 hours a day. The city is an important railroad hub in the southeastern part of Belarus, as it is situated midway on the Minsk–Kyiv rail link. The strategic location of Gomel near the border with Russia and Ukraine provides a direct connection to both countries’ vast railroad networks.

The trolleybus network opened on 20 May 1962 and now consists of 23 routes (not counting variations). On 15 December 2010, following the construction of an overhead wire network in Egorenko, Sviridov, and Chechersk Streets, a new trackless trolley line opened to the terminus &quot;Klinkowski Neighborhood,&quot; which resulted in a change of the trolleybus routes 9, 16, and 17. The length of the network is about , and the total length of the trolleybus routes is . The rolling stock comprises ACSM-201, ACSM-321, MAZ-203T, and ACSM-213 types.
There are more than 60 bus routes totaling , and a number of express routes. The rolling stock consists mainly of MAZ-105, MAZ-107, MAZ-103 buses, and to a lesser extent MAZ-203, MAZ-206, and since 2014, the extra-large-capacity, low-floor MAZ-215. Express routes use Rodemich-A type buses. The 24 minibus lines use Ford Transit, GAZelle, Mercedes-Benz, and Peugeot vans.

Gomel Airport is located northeast of the city.

== Sports ==

Gomel is home to a wide range of sports facilities that have been developed and improved in recent years. These facilities, including eight stadiums and the Ice Palace, which has two ice arenas, support common activities such as hockey, track and field, and football. HK Gomel of the Belarusian Extraleague is the local pro hockey team. The Central Stadium is the home of Gomel&#x27;s local football club, FC Gomel. Gomel hosts multiple international competitions in these facilities, the annual &quot;Bells of Chernobyl&quot; competition being one of the many. In addition to sports facilities, Gomel has a multitude of Olympic Reserve Schools, which are more commonly referred to as sports schools.

Many of Gomel&#x27;s sports schools prepare athletes from a young age. Numerous champions have been trained by schools such as these. For example, one school, Gomel&#x27;s Olympic Reserve Number 4, has trained 97 World and European champions as well as two Olympic athletes. Gomel State College of Olympic Reserve, on the other hand, trains coaches rather than athletes. From this school, 44 graduates have participated in the Olympics, European championships, and World championships. Gomel also participates in the Deaflympics and, between the years 2007–2009, has been awarded: two gold medals, one silver medal, and two bronze medals.

==Education==
Since 1990, Francisk Skorina Gomel State University, Pavel Sukhoi State Technical University of Gomel, and Gomel State Medical University have attracted many international students from countries around the world, including the United States, Germany, China, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Syria, Russia, Ukraine, Egypt, Iran, and countries in Latin America. Gomel State Medical University provides classes in both English and Russian. Many prominent scientists work here as senior lecturers.

==Culture==

Throughout the eight hundred-year history of Gomel, only a few sights have been preserved. A small number belong to the 1700s and 1800s, while the main part belongs to the 20th and 21st centuries. Most of the architectural monuments of the 20th century date back to the 1950s. They are mostly concentrated downtown.

Some of the sights include the Rumyantsev-Paskevich Residence, the Winter Garden, St. Peter and Paul Cathedral, the Gomel Oblast (Regional) Museum of Local Lore, the Hunting Lodge, , the , and the .

The Ferris Wheel and the Ferris Tower, located in the park a few hundred meters from the palace complex, are popular for exploring the city. Since the topography of Gomel is relatively flat, the height of the surrounding buildings makes it easy to view the city from the wheel and the watchtower.

Gomel also hosts Sožski Karahod, a dance festival normally held every other year.

<text>Grodno ( ; Yiddish: גראָדנע; ; ) or Hrodna (, ) is a city in western Belarus. It is one of the oldest cities of Belarus. The city is located on the Neman River, from Minsk, about from the border with Poland, and from the border with Lithuania. Grodno serves as the administrative center of Grodno Region and Grodno District, though it is administratively separated from the district. the city has a population of 361,115 inhabitants.

The modern city of Grodno, founded in 1127, originated as a small fortress and trading outpost on the border of the Baltic tribal union of the Yotvingians. It was also a home to the Dregoviches Slavic tribe. It was a significant city in Black Ruthenia and later part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which joined the Polish-Lithuanian Union in 1385. Grodno faced numerous invasions, most notably by the Teutonic Knights. The city was a key trade, commerce, and cultural center in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and one of its royal residences, and &quot;de facto&quot; capital in the 1580s. The Kings of Poland and Grand Dukes of Lithuania allowed the creation of a Jewish commune in 1389, and the city received its charter in 1441. Grodno was the site of two battles during the Great Northern War.

Grodno has a rich history with various rulers and influences. In 1793, Grodno became the capital of the Grodno Voivodeship, but was annexed by Russia in 1795 after Third Partition of Poland. The city had a significant Jewish population before the Holocaust. After the First World War, it was briefly part of the Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic and the Republic of Lithuania before being taken over by Poland. During the Second World War, it was occupied by the Soviet Union and later by Nazi Germany. Since 1945, Grodno has been part of Belarus. Today, it has a diverse population, including Belarusians, Poles, and a small Jewish community. The city is known for its historical architecture, including the Old Grodno Castle, and is a center for Roman Catholicism and Polish culture in Belarus.

==Other names==
In Belarusian Classical Orthography (Taraškievica), the city is named as (Horadnia). In Latin, it was known as (), in Polish as , in Lithuanian as , in Latvian as , in German as , and in Yiddish as (Grodne).

==History==
===Early history===
Before arrival of the East Slavs to the Grodno Region in the 10th–11th centuries, the area was inhabited by Baltic tribe Yotvingians, who were heavily Lithuanized in the 5th-7th centuries already and especially during the formation of the State of Lithuania in the 13th century, and subsequently for a long time Grodno and its area was a part of the Ethnographic Lithuania (e.g. even in the 19th century the Lithuanian-inhabited areas were still nearby the present-day suburbs of Grodno city). The modern city of Grodno originated as a small fortress and a fortified trading outpost maintained by the Rurikid princes on the border with the lands of the Baltic tribal union of the Yotvingians. The first reference to Grodno dates to 1005.&lt;ref name=&quot;USSR/1965&quot;&gt;&quot;Археографический ежегодник за 1964 год&quot;. The Academy of Sciences of the USSR, 1965, pg. 271. The name derives from the Old East Slavic verb &quot;gorodit&quot;, i.e., &quot;to enclose, to fence&quot; (see &quot;grad&quot; for details) or Lithuanian &#x27;gardas&#x27;, i.e., &quot;a fence&quot; (see Lithuanian language dictionary for details), both from an old Indo-European word.&lt;/ref&gt;

The official foundation year is 1128. In this year Grodno was mentioned in the &quot;Kievan Chronicle&quot; as Goroden, and located at a crossing of numerous trading routes. The same chronicle also reports in the year 1183: &#x27;That same year all of Goroden burned, including all the stone churches, from a flash of lightning and a clap of thunder in a thunderstorm.&#x27; 

Grodno became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 13th century, and the local stronghold was rebuilt by Lithuanians. Prince Daniel of Galicia briefly captured the city in 1253 and once again attacked it in 1259. In 1276, Duke Traidenis gave shelter in Grodno to Yotvingians fleeing the Teutonic Knights&#x27; massacre. The city was unsuccessfully attacked by the Rus&#x27; princes and Tatars in 1277, then repeatedly attacked, with varying success, by the Teutonic Knights in 1283, 1296, 1306, 1311, 1312, 1328, 1361, 1363, 1373, 1375, 1377. In 1358 a convention took place in Grodno on border disputes between Lithuania and the Polish Duchy of Masovia.

Since 1385 Grodno formed part of the Polish–Lithuanian union. The famous Lithuanian Grand Duke Vytautas was the prince of Grodno from 1376 to 1392, and he stayed there during his preparations for the Battle of Grunwald (1410). During the Lithuanian Civil War of 1389–1392, the city was captured by Władysław II Jagiełło in 1390, and then by Vytautas in 1391, with Vytautas-allied Konrad von Wallenrode committing a massacre of 15 Polish prisoners-of-war. After the Ostrów Agreement of 1392, Vytautas expelled the Teutonic Knights, who in revenge captured the city, burned the castle and took 3,000 prisoners. The city was attacked one more time by the Teutonic Knights in 1402. Since 1413, Grodno had been the administrative center of a powiat in Trakai Voivodeship. Polish King Władysław II Jagiełło often stopped in Grodno, including in 1414, 1416, 1418 and 1425. In 1425, Polish-Teutonic talks concerning the borders took place there.

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===

To aid the reconstruction of trade and commerce, the grand dukes allowed the creation of a Jewish commune in 1389. It was one of the first Jewish communities in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1441 the city received its charter, based on the Magdeburg Law. In 1445, Casimir IV Jagiellon received a delegation from Kraków in Grodno announcing his election as king of Poland.
As an important centre of trade, commerce, and culture, Grodno was a notable royal city and was also one of the royal residences and political centers of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In the 1580s, Grodno was the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, when King Stephen Báthory of Poland moved his main residence and military headquarters there. Stephen Báthory rebuilt the Old Grodno Castle into an important royal residence and built the Renaissance Batorówka Palace. The Old and New Castles were often visited by the Commonwealth monarchs. Kings Casimir IV Jagiellon and Stephen Báthory died there, and the latter was initially buried at the local Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Grodno was one of the places where the Sejms of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were held, incl. the last Sejm in the history of the Commonwealth in 1793.

The city was the site of two battles, Battle of Grodno (1706) and Battle of Grodno (1708) during the Great Northern War.

After the Second Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and a subsequent administrative reform of the remainder of the Commonwealth, Grodno became the capital of the short-lived Grodno Voivodeship in 1793.

===Late modern period===
In 1795, Russia annexed the city in the Third Partition of Poland. It was in the New Castle on 25 November that year that the last Polish king and Lithuanian grand duke Stanisław August Poniatowski abdicated. In the Russian Empire, the city continued to serve its role as a seat of Grodno Governorate since 1801. The industrial activities started in the late 18th century by Antoni Tyzenhaus, continued to develop.

During the Napoleonic Wars and fights for Polish liberation, in 1812, Polish uhlans of Prince Józef Poniatowski entered Grodno, followed by the French led by Jérôme Bonaparte. The entry of the allied Polish and French troops was met with enthusiasm by the population, the &quot;Accession to the Confederation of the inhabitants of the Grodno district&quot; was announced, Napoleon&#x27;s name day was officially celebrated and an obelisk was erected in honour of the French.
In 1833, following the unsuccessful November Uprising, notable local Polish independence activist and insurgent Michał Wołłowicz was hanged by the Russians, and the local Dominican gymnasium was seized by the Tsarist authorities.

Local Poles took part in Polish national mourning after the Russian massacre of Polish protesters in Warsaw in 1861. The dean of Grodno, Józef Majewski, was deported to Tobolsk in Siberia for attempting to organise a procession to Różanystok, a regional Catholic pilgrimage destination. Count Aleksander Bisping was arrested and imprisoned here during the January Uprising (1863-1864) before his exile to Ufa. After the fall of the uprising, a ban on the use of Polish in public places was introduced in 1865, and martial law was in force in Grodno until 1871.

As a result of Russian discriminatory policies (see &quot;Pale of Settlement&quot;) the city experienced an influx of Jewish immigrants in the 19th century, and thus had a significant Jewish population before the Holocaust: according to Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 46,900, Jews constituted 22,700 (around 48%, or almost half of the total population).

===World War I and interwar period===

After the outbreak of World War I, Grodno was occupied by Germany (3 September 1915) and ceded by Bolshevist Russia under the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1918. After the war the German government permitted a short-lived state to be set up there, the first one with a &quot;Belarusian&quot; name—the Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic. This declared its independence from Russia in March 1918 in Minsk (known at that time as Mensk), but then the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic had to leave Minsk and fled to Grodno and later to the temporary Lithuanian capital Kaunas. All this time the military authority in the city remained in German hands until April 1919. Nevertheless, military units of the Lithuanian Armed Forces were formed in the German-controlled part of the Grodno Region in 1918–1919. For example, a Belarusian unit named 1st Belarusian Regiment, commanded by Alaksandar Ružancoŭ, was formed mainly from Grodno&#x27;s inhabitants in 1919 as a part of the Lithuanian Armed Forces and participated in Lithuania&#x27;s side during the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, thus large amount of its members were awarded with the highest state award of Lithuania – Order of the Cross of Vytis. In accordance with an agreement between Lithuania and Belarus (Rada BNR), the Grodno Region was joined to Lithuania. According to Lithuanian president Antanas Smetona, the Lithuanians considered granting an autonomy to the Belarusian territories within Lithuania (as requested by Belarusian side; there were Belarusian members in the Council of Lithuania and representation in the Government of Lithuania by Lithuanian Ministry for Belarusian Affairs).
After the outbreak of the Polish–Bolshevik War, the German commanders of the Ober Ost feared that the city might fall to Soviet Russia, so according to the 1919 Treaty of Białystok on 27 April 1919 they passed authority to Poland, which just regained independence several months earlier. The city was taken over by the Polish Army the following day and Polish administration was established in the city. The Poles disbanded the Lithuania&#x27;s 1st Belarusian Regiment (which refused to carry out Polish orders) in Grodno and publicly humiliated, looted and repressed soldiers of this unit, including officers, as well as Lithuanian and Belarusian symbols and flags in the city were torn down and publicly ridiculed, and were replaced with Polish equivalents. The city was lost by Poles to the Red Army on 20 July 1920 in what became known as the First Battle of Grodno. The city was also claimed by Lithuanian government, after it was agreed by the Soviet–Lithuanian Treaty of 1920 signed on 12 July 1920 in Moscow that the city would be transferred to Lithuania. However, Soviet defeat in the Battle of Warsaw made these plans obsolete, and Lithuanian authority was never established in the city. Instead, the Red Army organised its last stand in the city and the Battle of Neman took place there. On the Polish Army recaptured the city. After the Peace Treaty of Riga, Grodno remained in Poland.
Initially, prosperity was reduced due to the fact that the city remained only the capital of a powiat, while the capital of the voivodeship was moved to Białystok. However, in the late 1920s the city became one of the biggest Polish Army garrisons. This brought the local economy back on track. According to the 1921 Polish census, the population of the city was 49.9% Polish, 43.4% Jewish, 4.3% Belarusian, 2.0% Russian, 0.26% German and 0.05% Lithuanian.

===World War II===

During the Polish Defensive War of September to October 1939 the garrison of Grodno was mostly used for the formation of numerous military units fighting against the invading Wehrmacht. In the course of the Soviet invasion of Poland (initiated on 17 September 1939) heavy fighting took place in the city between Soviet and improvised Polish forces, composed mostly of march battalions and volunteers. In the course of the Battle of Grodno the Red Army lost some hundred men (according to Polish sources; according to Soviet sources – 57 killed and 159 wounded) and also 19 tanks and 4 APCs destroyed or damaged. The Polish side suffered at least 100 killed in action, military and civil, but losses still remain uncertain in detail (Soviet sources claim 644 killed and 1543 captives with many guns and machine guns etc. captured). Over 300 captured Polish defenders of the city, including Polish Army officers and youth, were massacred afterwards by the Soviets. After the Soviet forces surrounded the engaged Polish units, the escaping Polish units withdrew to Lithuania.
In accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, the city was occupied by the Soviet Union and annexed into the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. Several thousand of the city&#x27;s Polish inhabitants were deported to remote areas of the Soviet Union. On 1–2 October 1940, negotiations were held in Grodno between the Lithuanian and Belarusian communists to resolve territorial disputes between the Lithuanian SSR and Byelorussian SSR. The Lithuanians received less territories than they were appointed by the Supreme Soviet Decree of 3 August 1940 and on 6 November 1940 the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union adopted a new decree regarding the borders of the Byelorussian SSR and Lithuanian SSR. The Byelorussian SSR transferred cities and surroundings of Švenčionys, Dieveniškės, Druskininkai to the Lithuanian SSR that were mostly inhabited by Lithuanians and the Lithuanians began administrating them in January 1941. According to a 26 September 1940 meeting protocol of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Byelorussia, Panteleimon Ponomarenko, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Byelorussia, narrated during the meeting that previously he discussed with the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin the issue of the territorial transfers between the Byelorussian SSR and the Lithuanian SSR and Stalin said to him that if he will not transfer territories where there are many Lithuanians he will be punished.

On 23 June 1941, the city came under German occupation that lasted until 16 July 1944. It was administered as part of the Bialystok District. Surviving inmates of the Grodno prison were released and the scale of the NKVD prisoner massacres revealed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ipn/pdf&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
In the course of Operation Barbarossa in World War II, the majority of Jews were herded by the Nazis into the Grodno Ghetto and subsequently killed in extermination camps. The Germans also operated a Nazi prison in the city.

===Byelorussian SSR and Republic of Belarus===
Since 1945, the city has been a centre of one of the provinces of the Byelorussian SSR, now of the independent Republic of Belarus. Most of the Polish inhabitants were expelled or fled to Poland in 1944–1946 and 1955–1959. However, in 2019 Poles were still the second-most numerous nationality in the city (22%), after Belarusians.
The Grodno Old Town was severely damaged during World War II and post-war authorities lacked will to preserve its heritage. The Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which because of its founder (14th century) was commonly referred to as &quot;Vytautas&#x27; Church&quot;, was first turned into a warehouse and eventually in 1961 was blown up by a decision of the Grodno Executive Committee. The Grodno Town Hall (constructed in 1513) was demolished to expand Savieckaja Square. The early 17th century Baroque style Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Bernardine Monastery was demolished in 1951 also by a decision of the Grodno Executive Committee and the Grodno Regional Drama Theatre was built in its place.

In 2005, the reconstruction of the historical centre of Grodno began. In 2008, the Belarusian Voluntary Society for the Protection of Historical and Cultural Monuments declared violations of the Law on the Protection of Historical and Cultural Heritage: the destruction of the cultural layer in the historic Old Market Square, demolition of 28 Constructivist architecture buildings in Mickevich, Gorky and 17 September streets in order to replace them with a modern hotel complex and the main traffic flow is directed in dangerous proximity to the New and Old Castles, while the plans to rebuild the Grodno Town Hall and the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary (&quot;Vytautas&#x27; Church&quot;) are not being implemented.

The reconstruction of the Old Grodno Castle was started in 2017 and also received criticism due to the lacking of historical authenticity. For instance, the contemporary viewpoint was added near the central gates. Some specialists disputed the restoration project, they found significant mistakes in documentation that appeared because the constructor could not read historical inventory descriptions written in Polish and German. For example, the shape of the dome above the central tower, added levels between towers and galleries. Some authentic 16th century walls were demolished.

Despite its significant loss of heritage, the city still has the largest ensemble of historical buildings in Belarus and is still nicknamed the &quot;royal city&quot; and &quot;a grand-ducal-royal city&quot;, thus is a popular tourists destination. The Brest-Grodno area was declared visa-free zone for foreign visitors for the period up to 15 days. Nevertheless, the British, American, Lithuanian, Canadian authorities and Belarusian opposition representatives urged not to travel to Belarus because of the safety concerns due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws (resulting in arrests and detention) and Russo-Ukrainian War.

===Jewish community===
Jews began to settle in Grodno in the 14th century after the approval given to them by the Lithuanian Grand Duke Vytautas. During the next years, their status had changed several times and in 1495 the Jews were deported from the city and banned from settling in Grodno (the ban was lifted in 1503). In 1560 there were 60 Jewish families in Grodno. They were concentrated on the &quot;Jewish street&quot; with their own synagogue and &quot;hospital&quot;. In the year 1578 the great synagogue of Grodno was built by rabbi Mordehai Yaffe (Baal ha-Levush). The synagogue was severely damaged in a fire in 1599.
The community was not affected by the Khmelnytsky uprising but suffered during the 1655 Cossack uprising and during the war with Sweden (1703–1708). After Grodno was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1795 it was made part of the Pale of Settlement within which Jewish residency was allowed, and beyond which it was prohibited. Thus the Jewish population continued to grow and in 1907 there were 25,000 Jews out of a total population of 47,000.

In the period of independent Poland, a yeshiva had operated in the city (Shaar ha-Tora) under the management of Rabbi Shimon Shkop. Before the German-Soviet invasion of Poland there were about 25,000 Jews in Grodno out of 50,000 total population. During the German occupation of the city, on 1 November 1942 the Jews were concentrated in 2 ghettos. 15,000 men were confined to the old part of the city where the main synagogue was located. A high wall of 2 meters was built around the ghetto. The second ghetto was located in the Slovodka part of the city with 10,000 inhabitants. The head of the Judenrat was appointed Dr. Braur (or Brawer), the school&#x27;s headmaster, who served in this duty until his execution in February 1943 during a roundup for a deportation to Treblinka. Several local Jews were rescued by Poles who either hidden them in the city or transported them to other locations.

On 2 November 1942 the deportations to the death camps began and during 5 days in February 1943, 10,000 Jews were sent to Auschwitz. Later, on 13 February, 5,000 Jews were sent to Treblinka. During the deportations, many synagogues were looted and some people were murdered. The last Jews were deported in March 1943. By the end of the war, only one Jew had remained in the ghetto. However, a few hundred survived in the camps or in hiding in the area. Perhaps as many as 2000 survived, including those who fled or were deported to the USSR.

After the war, the Jewish community was revived. Most of the Jews emigrated after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Today there are several hundred Jews in the city with most of the community&#x27;s activity centralized in the main synagogue that had been returned to the community by the authorities in the 1990s. The head of the community is Rabbi Yitzhak Kaufman.

A memorial plaque, commemorating the 25,000 Jews who were murdered in the two ghettos in the city of Grodno was placed on a building in Zamkavaja vulica, where the entrance to the ghetto once was.

==Geography==
The following rivers flow through the city: the Neman River, the Lasosna River and the Haradničanka River with its branch the Yurysdyka River.

===Climate===
The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Dfb&quot; (Warm Summer Continental Climate).
==Religion, education and culture==
The city has one of the largest concentrations of Roman Catholics in Belarus. It is also a centre of Polish culture, with a significant number of Poles living in Belarus residing in the city and its surroundings.

The Eastern Orthodox population is also widely present. The city&#x27;s Catholic and Orthodox churches are important architectural treasures.

The city houses the Grodno State Medical University where many students from different parts of Belarus acquire academic degrees, as do a number of foreign students. Other higher educational establishments are Yanka Kupala State University of Grodno (the largest education centre in Grodno Province) and Grodno State Agrarian University. To support the Polish community, a Polish school was built in 1995, where all subjects are taught in Polish and students are able to pass exams to get accepted into Polish universities.

==Architecture==
The town was planned to be dominated by the Old Grodno Castle, first built in stone by Grand Duke Vytautas and thoroughly rebuilt in the Renaissance style by Scotto from Parma at the behest of Stefan Batory, who made the castle his principal residence. Batory died at this palace seven years later (December 1586) and originally was interred in Grodno. (His autopsy there was the first to take place in Eastern Europe.) After his death, the castle was altered on numerous occasions, although a 17th-century stone arch bridge linking it with the city still survives. The Wettin monarchs of Poland were dissatisfied with the old residence and commissioned Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann to design the New Grodno Castle, whose once sumptuous Baroque interiors were destroyed during World War II.

===Medieval===

The oldest extant structure in Grodno is the Kalozha Church of Sts. Boris and Gleb (Belarusian: &quot;Каложская царква&quot;). It is the only surviving monument of ancient Black Ruthenian architecture, distinguished from other Orthodox churches by prolific use of polychrome faceted stones of blue, green or red tint which could be arranged to form crosses or other figures on the wall.

The church was built before 1183 and survived intact until 1853, when the south wall collapsed, due to its perilous location on the high bank of the Neman. During restoration works, some fragments of 12th-century frescos were discovered in the apses. Remains of four other churches in the same style, decorated with pitchers and coloured stones instead of frescos, were discovered in Grodno and Vaŭkavysk. They all date back to the turn of the 13th century, as do remains of the first stone palace in the Old Castle.

===Baroque===

The Cathedral of St. Francis Xavier stands on Batory Square (now: Soviet Square). The cathedral was a Jesuit church until 1773. This specimen of high Baroque architecture, exceeding 50 metres in height, was started in 1678. Due to wars that rocked Poland-Lithuania at that time, the cathedral was consecrated only 27 years later, in the presence of Peter the Great and Augustus the Strong. Its late Baroque frescoes were executed in 1752.

The extensive grounds of the Bernardine monastery (1602–18), renovated in 1680 and 1738, display all the styles flourishing in the 17th century, from Gothic to Baroque. The interior is considered a masterpiece of so-called Vilnius Baroque. Other monastic establishments include the old Franciscan cloister (1635), Basilian convent (1720–51, by Giuseppe Fontana III), the church of the Bridgettine cloister (1642, one of the earliest Baroque buildings in the region) with the wooden two-storey dormitory (1630s) still standing on the grounds, and the 18th-century buildings of the Dominican monastery (its cathedral was demolished in 1874).

Other sights in Grodno include the Orthodox cathedral, a polychrome Russian Revival extravaganza from 1904; the botanical garden, the first in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, founded in 1774; a curiously curved building on the central square (1780s); a 254-metre-high TV tower (1984); and Stanisławów, a summer residence of the last Polish king.

The trolleybus system is operated by the city, and in 2009 it had 12 routes and carried around 66.5 million passengers per year. Additional routes have been opened subsequently, including routes 21 and 22 in November 2019.

<text>Mogilev (), also transliterated as Mahilyow (, ; , ; , ), is a city in eastern Belarus. It is located on the Dnieper River, about from the border with Russia&#x27;s Smolensk Oblast and from Bryansk Oblast. As of 2024, it has a population of 353,110. In 2011, its population was 360,918, up from an estimated 106,000 in 1956. It serves as the administrative centre of Mogilev Region, and is the third-largest city in Belarus.

== History ==

The city was first mentioned in historical records in 1267. From the 14th century, it was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and since the Union of Lublin (1569), part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, where it became known as &quot;Mohylew&quot;. In the 16th-17th centuries, the city flourished as one of the main nodes of the east–west and north–south trading routes.

In 1577, Grand Duke Stefan Batory granted it city rights under Magdeburg law. In 1654, during the Russo-Polish War (1654–1667), the townsmen negotiated a treaty of surrender to the Russians peacefully, if the Jews were to be expelled and their property divided up among Mogilev&#x27;s inhabitants. Tsar Aleksei Mikhailovitch agreed. However, instead of expelling the Jews, the Russian troops massacred them after they had led them to the outskirts of the town. During this war, the city was besieged twice by the Lithuanian army: in 1655, and In 1661, local residents started against the Russian military occupation. The city was set afire by Peter the Great&#x27;s forces in 1708, during the Great Northern War. After the First Partition of Poland in 1772, Mogilev became part of the Russian Empire and became the centre of the Mogilev Governorate. In 1938 it was decided Mogilev was to become the capital of Belarus because Minsk was too close to the then-Polish-Soviet border.

In the years 1915–1917, during World War I, the Stavka, the headquarters of the Russian Imperial Army, was based in the city and the Tsar, Nicholas II, spent long periods there as Commander-in-Chief.

Following the Russian Revolution, in 1918, the city was briefly occupied by Germany and placed under their short-lived Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic. In 1919, Mogilev was captured by the forces of Soviet Russia and incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR. Up to World War II and the Holocaust, like many other cities in Europe, Mogilev had a significant Jewish population: according to the Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 41,100, 21,500 were Jews (i.e. over 50 percent). In 1938 the leadership of Soviet Belarus decided to move the capital of the country from Minsk to Mogilev. Due to that, the now-Mogilev City Council building was built in 1938–1940 with the aim of being the government building. It was designed to resemble the Minsk Government building.

During Operation Barbarossa, the city was conquered by Wehrmacht forces on 26 July 1941 and remained under German occupation until 28 June 1944. Mogilev became the official residence of High SS and police leader (HSSPF) Erich von dem Bach. During that period, the Jews of Mogilev were ghettoized and systematically murdered by &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; and SS personnel. Heinrich Himmler personally witnessed the executions of 279 Jews on 23 October 1941. Later that month, a number of mentally disabled patients were poisoned with car exhaust fumes as an experiment; the method of killing was thereafter applied in several Nazi extermination camps. Initial plans for establishing a death camp in Mogilev were abandoned in favour of Maly Trostenets.

In 1944, with the Mogilev offensive, the devastated city was liberated by the Red Army and returned to Soviet control. Mogilev then was the site of a labour camp for German POW soldiers.

Since Belarus gained its independence in 1991, Mogilev has remained one of its principal cities.

==Demographics==

== Religion ==
Mohilev was the episcopal see of the Latin Catholic Archdiocese of Mohilev until its 1991 merger into the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Minsk-Mohilev.

It remains the see of the Eparchy (Eastern diocese) of Mogilev and Mstsislaw in the Belarusian Exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church.
== Economy ==
After World War II, a huge metallurgy centre with several major steel mills was built. Also, several major factories of cranes, cars, tractors and a chemical plant were established. By the 1950s, tanning was Mogilev&#x27;s principal industry, and it was a major trading centre for cereal, leather, salt, sugar, fish, timber and flint: the city has been home to a major inland port on the Dnieper river since and an airport since. Since the fall of the Soviet Union and the establishment of Belarus as an independent country, Mogilev has become one of that country&#x27;s main economic and industrial centres.

==Cityscape==

The town&#x27;s most notable landmark is the late 17th-century town hall, named the Ratuša (Rathaus), that was built during the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The grand tower of the town hall sustained serious damage during the Great Northern War and the Great Patriotic War. It was eventually demolished in 1957 and rebuilt in its pre-war form in 2008.

Another important landmark of Mogilev is the six-pillared St. Stanisław&#x27;s Cathedral, built in the Baroque style between 1738 and 1752 and distinguished by its frescoes.

The convent of St. Nicholas preserves its magnificent cathedral of 1668, as well as the original iconostasis, bell tower, walls, and gates. It is currently under consideration to become a UNESCO World Heritage site.

Minor landmarks include the archiepiscopal palace and memorial arch, both dating from the 1780s, and the enormous theater in a blend of the Neo-Renaissance and Russian Revival styles.

At Polykovichi, an urban part of Mogilev, there is a 350 metre tall guyed TV mast, one of the tallest structures in Belarus.

<text>Vitebsk or Vitsyebsk (, ; , ; ) is a city in northern Belarus. It serves as the administrative center of Vitebsk Region and Vitebsk District, though it is administratively separated from the district. As of 2024, it has 358,395 inhabitants, making it the country&#x27;s fourth-largest city. It is served by Vitebsk Vostochny Airport and Vitebsk Air Base.

==History==
===Middle Ages===
Vitebsk developed from a river harbor where the Vićba River (Віцьба, from which it derives its name) flows into the larger Western Dvina, which is spanned in the city by the Kirov Bridge.

Archaeological research indicates that Baltic tribes had settlements at the mouth of Vitba. In the 9th century, Slavic settlements of the tribal union of the Krivichs replaced them. According to the &quot;Chronicle of Michael Brigandine&quot; (1760), Princess Olga of Kiev founded Vitebsk (also recorded as Dbesk, Vidbesk, Videbsk, Vitepesk, or Vicibesk) in 974. Other versions give 947 or 914. Academician Boris Rybakov and historian Leonid Alekseyev have come to the conclusion, based on the chronicles, that Princess Olga of Kiev could have established Vitebsk in 947. Leonid Alekseyev suggested that the chroniclers, when transferring the date from the account of the Byzantine era (since the creation of the world) to a new era, obtained the year 947, later mistakenly written in copying manuscripts as 974. It was an important place on the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks. By the end of the 12th century, Vitebsk became a center of trade and commerce, and the center of an independent principality, following the Polotsk, and at times, the Smolensk and Kiev princes.

The official year of the founding of Vitebsk is 974, based on an anachronistic legend of founding by Olga of Kiev, but the first mention in historical records dates from 1021, when Yaroslav the Wise of Kiev gave it to Bryachislav Izyaslavich, Prince of Polotsk.

In the 12th and 13th centuries, Vitebsk functioned as the capital of the Principality of Vitebsk, an appanage principality which thrived at the crossroads of the river routes between the Baltic and Black seas. In 1320 the city was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as dowry of the Princess Maria, the first wife of Grand Duke of Lithuania Algirdas. By 1351 the city had erected a stone Upper and Lower Castle, the prince&#x27;s palace. In 1410 Vitebsk participated in the Battle of Grunwald.

===Modern era===
From 1503 it was the capital of the Vitebsk Voivodeship. In 1569 it became part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1597 Vitebsk was granted Magdeburg rights and a coat of arms by Sigismund III Vasa. However, the rights were taken away in 1623 after the citizens revolted against the imposed Union of Brest and killed Archbishop Josaphat Kuntsevych of Polotsk. In 1641 Władysław IV Vasa restored Magdeburg rights. The city was almost completely destroyed by the Russians in 1708, during the Great Northern War. In the First Partition of Poland in 1772, the Russian Empire annexed Vitebsk.
Under the Russian Empire, the historic centre of Vitebsk was rebuilt in the Neoclassical style.

The Battle of Vitebsk was fought west of the city on 26–27 July 1812 as Napoleon attempted to engage decisively with the Russian army. While the French were to occupy the town for over three months (the emperor celebrating his 43rd birthday there) the Russian army was able to slip away with minimal losses towards Smolensk.

Before World War II, Vitebsk had a significant Jewish population: according to Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 65,900, Jews constituted 34,400 (around 52%). The most famous of its Jewish natives was the painter Marc Chagall (1887-1985).

In 1919, Vitebsk was proclaimed to be part of the Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia (January to February 1919), but was soon transferred to the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and later to the short-lived Lithuanian–Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (February to July 1919). In 1924 it was returned to the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic.

===World War II===

During World War II, the city came under Nazi German occupation (11 July 1941 – 26 June 1944). During Operation Barbarossa, 22,000 Jews, or 58% of Vitebsk&#x27;s Jewish population, managed to successfully evacuate to the interior of the Soviet Union, thus saving themselves from the impending Holocaust. Much of the old city was destroyed in the ensuing battles between the Germans and Red Army soldiers. Most of the remaining local Jews perished in the Vitebsk Ghetto massacre of October 1941. The Germans also operated a Nazi prison, the Stalag 313 prisoner-of-war camp and forced labour camps in the city. The Soviets recaptured the city during the June 1944 Vitebsk–Orsha Offensive, as part of Operation Bagration.

===Post-war period===
In the first postwar five-year period the city was rebuilt. Its industrial complex covered machinery, light industry, and machine tools.

In 1959, a TV tower was commissioned and started broadcasting the 1st Central Television program.

In 1990, a club of voters &quot;For Democratic Elections&quot; was founded in Vitebsk.

===Independence of Belarus===
In January 1991, Vitebsk celebrated the first Marc Chagall Festival. In June 1992, a monument to Chagall was erected on his native Pokrovskaja Street and a memorial inscription was placed on the wall of his house.

Since 1992, Vitebsk has been hosting the annual Slavianski Bazaar, an international music festival. The main participants are artists from Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, with guests from many other countries, both Slavic and non-Slavic. There has been a remarkable improvement and expansion of the city. The central stadium was reconstructed, and the Summer Amphitheatre, the railway station and other historical sites and facilities were restored, and the Ice Sports Palace along with a number of new churches and other public facilities were built, together with the construction of new residential areas.

==Attractions==

The city has one of the oldest buildings in the country: the Annunciation Church. The building dates back to the period of Kievan Rus. The city at the time was pagan and did not belong to the Ukrainian or Russian Orthodox Church or the Kievan Rus state. It was constructed in the 1140s as a pagan church, rebuilt in the 14th and 17th centuries as a Roman Catholic Church, restored in 1883 and destroyed by the Soviet administration in 1961. The church was in ruins until 1992, when it was restored to its presumed original appearance.

Churches from the Polish-Lithuanian period were likewise destroyed, although the Resurrection Church (1772–77) has been rebuilt. The Orthodox cathedral, dedicated to the Intercession of the Theotokos, was erected in 1760. There are also the town hall (1775); the Russian governor&#x27;s palace, where Napoleon celebrated his 43rd birthday in 1812; the Neo-Romanesque Roman Catholic cathedral (1884–85); and an obelisk commemorating the centenary of the Russian victory over Napoleon.

Vitebsk is also home to a lattice steel TV tower carrying a horizontal cross on which the antenna mast is guyed. This tower, which is nearly identical to that at Grodno, but a few metres shorter (245 metres in Vitebsk versus 254 metres at Grodno) was completed in 1983. The city is also home to the Marc Chagall Museum and the Vitebsk regional museum.

===Climate===
Vitebsk has warm summer humid continental climate, Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;. Summers are generally warm, while winters are relatively cold but still warmer than in Moscow due to a stronger influence of maritime air from the Baltic Sea. Approximately of precipitation falls here per annum.

<text>Dame Emma Thompson (born 15 April 1959) is a British actress and screenwriter. Her work spans over four decades of screen and stage, and her accolades include two Academy Awards, three BAFTA Awards, two Golden Globe Awards and a Primetime Emmy Award. In 2018, she was made a dame (DBE) by Queen Elizabeth II for her contributions to drama.

Born to actors Eric Thompson and Phyllida Law, Thompson was educated at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she became a member of the Footlights troupe, and appeared in the comedy sketch series &quot;Alfresco&quot; (1983–1984). In 1985, she starred in the West End revival of the musical &quot;Me and My Girl&quot;, which was a breakthrough in her career. In 1987, she came to prominence for her performances in two BBC series, &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; and &quot;Fortunes of War&quot;, winning the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress for her work on both series. In the early 1990s, she often collaborated with then-husband, actor and director Kenneth Branagh, in films such as &quot;Henry V&quot; (1989), &quot;Dead Again&quot; (1991), and &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (1993).

For her performance in the Merchant-Ivory period drama &quot;Howards End&quot; (1992), Thompson won the BAFTA Award and the Academy Award for Best Actress. In 1993, she received two Academy Award nominations—Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress—for the respective roles of the housekeeper of a grand household in &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; and a lawyer in &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot;, becoming one of the few actors to achieve this feat. Thompson wrote and starred in &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; (1995), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay—making her the only person in history to win Oscars for both acting and writing—and once again won the BAFTA. Further critical acclaim came for her roles in &quot;Primary Colors&quot; (1998), &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003), &quot;Saving Mr. Banks&quot; (2013), &quot;Late Night&quot; (2019), and &quot;Good Luck to You, Leo Grande&quot; (2022).

Other notable film credits include the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series (2004–2011), &quot;Nanny McPhee&quot; (2005), &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot; (2006), &quot;An Education&quot; (2009), &quot;Men in Black 3&quot; (2012) and the spin-off &quot;Men in Black: International&quot; (2019), &quot;Brave&quot; (2012), &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (2017), &quot;Cruella&quot; (2021), and &quot;Matilda the Musical&quot; (2022). Her television credits include &quot;Wit&quot; (2001), &quot;Angels in America&quot; (2003), &quot;The Song of Lunch&quot; (2010), &quot;King Lear&quot; (2018) and &quot;Years and Years&quot; (2019). She portrayed Mrs. Lovett in a Lincoln Center production of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; in 2014. Authorised by the publishers of Beatrix Potter, Thompson has also written three Peter Rabbit children&#x27;s books.

==Early life and education==
Thompson was born in London on 15 April 1959. Her mother is Scottish actress Phyllida Law, while her English father, Eric Thompson, was an actor best known as the writer of the popular children&#x27;s television series &quot;The Magic Roundabout&quot;. Her godfather was the director and writer Ronald Eyre. She has a younger sister, Sophie, who is also an actress. The family lived in the West Hampstead district of London, and Thompson was educated at Camden School for Girls. She spent much time in Scotland during her childhood and often visited Ardentinny, where her grandparents and uncle lived.

In her youth, Thompson was intrigued by language and literature, a trait she attributes to her father, who shared her love of words. After successfully taking A levels in English, French and Latin, and securing a scholarship, she began studying for an English degree at Newnham College, Cambridge, arriving in 1977. Thompson believes that it was inevitable she would become an actor, remarking that she was &quot;surrounded by creative people and I don&#x27;t think it would ever have gone any other way, really&quot;. While there, she had a &quot;seminal moment&quot; that turned her to feminism and inspired her to take up performing. She explained in a 2007 interview how she discovered the book &quot;The Madwoman in the Attic&quot;, &quot;which is about Victorian female writers and the disguises they took on in order to express what they wanted to express. That completely changed my life.&quot; She became a self-professed &quot;punk rocker&quot;, with short red hair and a motorbike, and aspired to be a comedian like Lily Tomlin.

At Cambridge, Thompson was invited into the Cambridge Footlights, the university&#x27;s prestigious sketch comedy troupe, by its president, Martin Bergman, becoming its first female member. Also in the troupe were fellow actors Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, and she had a romantic relationship with the latter. Fry recalled that &quot;there was no doubt that Emma was going the distance. Our nickname for her was Emma Talented.&quot;
In 1980, Thompson served as the Vice President of Footlights, and co-directed the troupe&#x27;s first all-female revue, &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot;. The following year, she and her Footlights team won the Perrier Award at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe for their sketch show &quot;The Cellar Tapes&quot;. She graduated with upper second-class honours.

Thompson&#x27;s father died in 1982, aged 52. She has stated that this &quot;tore [the family] to pieces&quot;, and &quot;I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how much I regret his not being around&quot;. She added, &quot;At the same time, it&#x27;s possible that were he still alive I might never have had the space or courage to do what I&#x27;ve done ... I have a definite feeling of inheriting space. And power.&quot;

==Career==

===Early work and breakthrough (1980–1989)===
During Thompson&#x27;s years studying at Cambridge, she starred in a BBC Radio 4 comedy series called &quot;Injury Tim&quot;e. This was recorded and broadcast from 1980 to 1982

Thompson had her first professional role in 1982, touring in a stage version of &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;. She then turned to television, where much of her early work came with her Footlights co-stars Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry. The regional ITV comedy series &quot; There&#x27;s Nothing to Worry About!&quot; (1982) was their first outing, followed by the one-off BBC show &quot;The Crystal Cube&quot; (1983). &quot;There&#x27;s Nothing to Worry About!&quot; later returned as the networked sketch show &quot;Alfresco&quot; (1983–84), which ran for two series with Thompson, Fry, Laurie, Ben Elton, and Robbie Coltrane. She later collaborated again with Fry and Laurie on the acclaimed BBC Radio 4 series &quot;Saturday Night Fry&quot; (1988).

In 1985, Thompson was cast in the West End revival of the musical &quot;Me and My Girl&quot;, co-starring Robert Lindsay. It provided a breakthrough in her career, as the production earned rave reviews. She played the role of Sally Smith for 15 months, which exhausted her: she later remarked &quot;I thought if I did the fucking &quot;Lambeth Walk&quot; one more time I was going to fucking throw up.&quot; At the end of 1985, she wrote and starred in her own one-off special for Channel 4, &quot;Emma Thompson: Up for Grabs&quot;.

Thompson achieved another breakthrough in 1987, when she had leading roles in two television miniseries: &quot;Fortunes of War&quot;, a World War II drama costarring Kenneth Branagh, and &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot;, a dark comedy about a Scottish rock band with Robbie Coltrane. For these performances, Thompson won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress. The following year, she wrote and starred in her own sketch comedy series for BBC, &quot;Thompson&quot;, but this was poorly received. In 1989, she and Branagh—with whom she had formed a romantic relationship—starred in a stage revival of &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;, directed by Judi Dench and produced by Branagh&#x27;s Renaissance Theatre Company. Later that year, the pair starred in a televised version of the play.

Thompson&#x27;s first cinema appearance came in the romantic comedy &quot;The Tall Guy&quot; (1989), the feature-film debut from screenwriter Richard Curtis. It starred Jeff Goldblum as a West End actor, and Thompson played the nurse with whom he falls in love. The film was not widely seen, but Thompson&#x27;s performance was praised in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, where Caryn James called her &quot;an exceptionally versatile comic actress&quot;. She next turned to Shakespeare, appearing as Princess Katherine in Branagh&#x27;s screen adaptation of &quot;Henry V&quot; (1989). The film was released to great critical acclaim.

===&quot;Howards End&quot; and worldwide recognition (1990–1993)===
Thompson and Branagh are considered by American writer and critic James Monaco to have led the &quot;British cinematic onslaught&quot; in the 1990s. She continued to experiment with Shakespeare in the new decade, appearing with Branagh in his stage productions of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and &quot;King Lear&quot;. Reviewing the latter, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; praised her &quot;extraordinary&quot; performance of the &quot;hobbling, stooped hunchback Fool&quot;. Thompson returned to cinema in 1991, playing a &quot;frivolous aristocrat&quot; in &quot;Impromptu&quot; with Judy Davis and Hugh Grant. She was nominated for Best Supporting Female at the Independent Spirit Awards. Her second release of 1991 was another pairing with Branagh, who also directed, in the Los Angeles-based noir &quot;Dead Again&quot;. She played a woman who has forgotten her identity. Early in 1992, Thompson had a guest role in an episode of &quot;Cheers&quot; as Frasier Crane&#x27;s first wife.

A turning point in Thompson&#x27;s career came when she was cast opposite Anthony Hopkins and Vanessa Redgrave in the Merchant Ivory period drama &quot;Howards End&quot; (1992), based on the novel by E. M. Forster. The film explored the social class system in Edwardian Britain, with Thompson playing an idealistic, intellectual, forward-looking woman who comes into association with a privileged and deeply conservative family. She actively pursued the role by writing to director James Ivory, who agreed to an audition and then gave her the part. According to the critic Vincent Canby, the film allowed Thompson to &quot;[come] into her own&quot;, away from Branagh. Upon release, Roger Ebert wrote that she was &quot;superb in the central role: quiet, ironic, observant, with steel inside&quot;. &quot;Howards End&quot; was widely praised, a &quot;surprise hit&quot;, and received nine Academy Award nominations. Among its three wins was the Best Actress trophy for Thompson, who was also awarded a Golden Globe and BAFTA for her performance. Reflecting on the role, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the actress &quot;found herself an international success almost overnight&quot;.

For her next two films, Thompson returned to working with Branagh. In &quot;Peter&#x27;s Friends&quot; (1992), the pair starred with Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Imelda Staunton, and Tony Slattery as a group of Cambridge alumni who are reunited ten years after graduating. The comedy was positively reviewed, and Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that Thompson was its highlight: &quot;Even as a rather one-dimensional character, she exudes grace and an adroit sense of comic tragedy.&quot; She followed this with Branagh&#x27;s screen version of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (1993). The couple starred as Beatrice and Benedick, alongside a cast that also included Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves, and Michael Keaton. Thompson was widely praised for the on-screen chemistry with Branagh and the natural ease with which she played the role, marking another critical success for Thompson. Her performance earned a nomination for Best Female Lead at the Independent Spirit Awards.

Thompson reunited with Merchant–Ivory and Anthony Hopkins to film &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; (1993), a film which has been described as a &quot;classic&quot; and the production team&#x27;s definitive film. Based on Kazuo Ishiguro&#x27;s novel about a housekeeper and butler in interwar Britain, the story is acclaimed for its study of loneliness and repression, though Thompson was particularly interested in looking at &quot;the deformity that servitude inflicts upon people&quot;, since her grandmother had worked as a servant and made many sacrifices. She has named the film as one of the greatest experiences of her career, considering it to be a &quot;masterpiece of withheld emotion&quot;. &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; was a critical and commercial success, receiving eight Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and a second Best Actress nomination for Thompson.

Along with her Best Actress nomination at the 66th Academy Awards, Thompson was also nominated in the Best Supporting Actress category, making her the eighth performer in history to be nominated for two Oscars in the same year. It came for her role as the lawyer Gareth Peirce in &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; (1993), a drama about the Guildford Four starring Daniel Day-Lewis. The film was her second hit of the year, earning $65million and critical praise, and was nominated for Best Picture along with &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;.

===&quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; and established actress (1994–1999)===
In 1994, Thompson made her Hollywood debut playing a goofy doctor alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito in &quot;Junior&quot;. Although the male pregnancy storyline was poorly received by most critics and flopped at the box office, Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; praised the lead trio. She returned to independent cinema for a lead role in &quot;Carrington&quot;, which studied the platonic relationship between artist Dora Carrington and writer Lytton Strachey (played by Jonathan Pryce). Roger Ebert remarked that Thompson had &quot;developed a specialty in unrequited love&quot;, and the &quot;TV Guide Film &amp; Video Companion&quot; commented that her &quot;neurasthenic mannerisms, which usually drive us batty, are appropriate here&quot;.

Thompson&#x27;s Academy success continued with &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; (1995), generally considered to be the most popular and authentic of the numerous film adaptations of Jane Austen&#x27;s novels made in the 1990s. Thompson—a lifelong lover of Austen&#x27;s work—was hired to write the film based on the period sketches in her series &quot;Thompson&quot;. She spent five years developing the screenplay, and took the role of the spinster sister Elinor Dashwood despite, aged 35, being 16 years older than the literary character. Directed by Ang Lee and co-starring Kate Winslet, &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; received widespread critical acclaim and ranks among the highest-grossing films of Thompson&#x27;s career. Shelly Frome remarked that she displayed a &quot;great affinity for Jane Austen&#x27;s style and wit&quot;, and Graham Fuller of &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; saw her as the film&#x27;s auteur. Thompson received a third nomination for Best Actress and won the award for Best Adapted Screenplay, making her the only person in history to win an Oscar for both acting and screenwriting. She also earned a second BAFTA Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay.

Thompson was absent from screens in 1996, but returned the following year with Alan Rickman&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;The Winter Guest&quot;. Set over one day in a Scottish seaside village, the drama allowed Thompson and her mother (Phyllida Law) to play mother and daughter on screen. She then returned to America to appear in an episode of &quot;Ellen&quot;, and her self-parodying performance received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.

For her second Hollywood role, Thompson starred with John Travolta in Mike Nichols&#x27;s &quot;Primary Colors&quot; (1998), playing a couple based on Bill and Hillary Clinton. Thompson&#x27;s character, Susan, is described as that of an &quot;ambitious, long-suffering wife&quot; who has to deal with her husband&#x27;s infidelity. The film was critically well received but lost money at the box office. According to Kevin O&#x27;Sullivan of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, Americans were &quot;blown away&quot; by her performance and accent, and top Hollywood producers became increasingly interested in casting her. Thompson rejected many of the offers, expressing concerns about living in Los Angeles behind walls with bodyguards, and stated &quot;LA is lovely as long as you know you can leave&quot;. She also admitted to feeling tired and jaded with the industry at this point, which influenced her decision to leave film for a year. Thompson followed &quot;Primary Colors&quot; by playing an FBI agent opposite Rickman in the poorly received thriller &quot;Judas Kiss&quot; (1998).

===Continued screen work and further acclaim (2000–2011)===
When she became a mother in 1999, Thompson made a conscious decision to reduce her workload, and in the following years many of her appearances were supporting roles. She was not seen on screen again until 2000, with only a small part in the British comedy &quot;Maybe Baby&quot;, which she appeared in as a favour to its director, her friend Ben Elton.

For the HBO television film &quot;Wit&quot; (2001), however, Thompson happily took the lead role in what she felt was &quot;one of the best scripts to have come out of America&quot;. Adapted from Margaret Edson&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize winning play, it focuses on a self-sufficient Harvard University professor who finds her values challenged when she is diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Thompson was instrumental in bringing Mike Nichols to direct the project, and the pair spent months in rehearsal to get the complex character right. She was greatly drawn to the &quot;daredevil&quot; role, for which she had no qualms about shaving her head. Reviewing the performance, Roger Ebert was touched by &quot;the way she struggles with every ounce of her humanity to keep her self-respect&quot;, and in 2008 he called it Thompson&#x27;s finest work. Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; also described it as &quot;one of her most brilliant performances&quot;, adding &quot;we seem to be peering into a soul as embattled as its body.&quot; The film earned Thompson nominations at the Golden Globes, Emmys and Screen Actors Guild Awards.

Thompson&#x27;s only credit of 2002 was a voice role in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, where she voiced Captain Amelia. The animation earned far less than its large budget and was considered a &quot;box office disaster&quot;. This failure was countered the following year by one of Thompson&#x27;s biggest commercial successes, Richard Curtis&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Love Actually&quot;. As part of an ensemble cast that included Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, and Colin Firth, she played a middle-class wife who discovers her husband (played by Alan Rickman) has been unfaithful to her. The scene in which her stalwart character breaks down was described by one critic as &quot;the best crying on screen ever&quot;, and in 2013, Thompson mentioned that she gets commended for this role more than any other. She explained, &quot;I&#x27;ve had so much bloody practice at crying in a bedroom then having to go out and be cheerful, gathering up the pieces of my heart and putting them in a drawer.&quot; Her performance received a BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

Thompson continued with supporting roles in the 2003 drama &quot;Imagining Argentina&quot;, where she played a dissident-journalist abducted by the country&#x27;s 1970s dictatorial regime. Antonio Banderas played the husband who tries to find her, in a film that most critics disliked. The film was booed and jeered at when it was screened at the Venice Film Festival and received a scathing article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Thompson had greater success that year when she worked with HBO for a second time in the acclaimed miniseries &quot;Angels in America&quot; (2003). The show, also starring Al Pacino and Meryl Streep, deals with the AIDS epidemic in Reagan-era America. Thompson played three roles – a nurse, a homeless woman, and the title role of The Angel of America – and was again nominated for an Emmy Award. In 2004, she played the eccentric Divination teacher Sybill Trelawney in the third &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film, &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, her character described as a &quot;hippy chick professor who teaches fortune-telling&quot;. She later reprised the role in &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; (2007) and &quot;Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot; (2011), and has described her time working on the popular franchise as &quot;great fun&quot;.

The year 2005 saw the release of a project Thompson had been working on for nine years. Loosely based on the &quot;Nurse Matilda&quot; stories that she read as a child, Thompson wrote the screenplay for the children&#x27;s film &quot;Nanny McPhee&quot; – which centres on a mysterious, unsightly nanny who must discipline a group of children. She also took the lead role, alongside Colin Firth and Angela Lansbury, in what was a highly personal project. The film was a success, taking number one at the UK box office and earning $122million worldwide. Commenting on Thompson&#x27;s screenplay, film critic Claudia Puig wrote that its &quot;well-worn storybook features are woven effectively into an appealing tale of youthful empowerment&quot;.

The following year, Thompson appeared in the surreal American comedy–drama &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot;, playing a novelist whose latest character (played by Will Ferrell) is a real person who hears her narration in his head. Reviews for the film were generally favourable. Following a brief, uncredited role in the post-apocalyptic blockbuster &quot;I Am Legend&quot; (2007), Thompson played the devoutly Catholic Lady Marchmain in a 2008 film adaptation of &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;. Critics were unenthusiastic about the film, but several picked Thompson out as its highlight. Mark Kermode said &quot;Emma Thompson is to some extent becoming the new Judi Dench, as the person who kind of comes in for 15 minutes and is brilliant ... [but then] when she goes away, the rest of the movie has a real problem living up to the wattage of her presence&quot;.

Thompson received further acclaim for her work in the London-based romance &quot;Last Chance Harvey&quot; (2008), where she and Dustin Hoffman played a lonely, middle-aged pair who cautiously begin a relationship. Critics praised the chemistry between the two leads, and both received Golden Globe nominations for their performances. Thompson&#x27;s two 2009 films were both set in 1960s United Kingdom, and in both she made cameo appearances: as a headmistress in the critically praised drama &quot;An Education&quot; and as a &quot;tippling mother&quot; in Richard Curtis&#x27;s &quot;The Boat That Rocked&quot;.

Five years after the original, Thompson reprised the role of Nanny McPhee with 2010&#x27;s &quot;Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang&quot;. Her screenplay transported the story to Britain during World War II. Building on the first film&#x27;s success, it was another UK box office number one and the sequel was widely seen as an improvement. The same year, Thompson reunited with Alan Rickman for the BBC television film &quot;The Song of Lunch&quot;, which focused on two unnamed characters meeting at a restaurant 15 years after ending their relationship. Thompson&#x27;s performance earned her a fourth Emmy Award nomination.

===Career expansion and blockbuster films (2012–present)===
In 2012, Thompson made a rare appearance in a big-budget Hollywood film when she played the head Agent in &quot;Men in Black 3&quot; – a continuation of the sci-fi comedy franchise starring Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, and Josh Brolin. With a worldwide gross of $624million, &quot;MIB3&quot; ranks as Thompson&#x27;s highest-grossing release outside of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films. This mainstream success continued with the Pixar film &quot;Brave&quot;, in which Thompson voiced Elinor – the Scottish queen despairing at her daughter&#x27;s defiance against tradition. It was her second consecutive blockbuster release, and critics were generally kind to the film. Also in 2012, Thompson played Queen Elizabeth II in an episode of &quot;Playhouse Presents&quot;, which dramatised an incident in 1982 when an intruder broke into the Queen&#x27;s bedroom. Her first film of 2013 was the fantasy romance &quot;Beautiful Creatures&quot;, in which she played an evil mother. The film aimed to capitalise on the success of &quot;The Twilight Saga&quot;, but was poorly reviewed and a box office disappointment. Film critic Peter Travers was critical of Thompson&#x27;s performance and &quot;outrageously awful Southern accent&quot;, and feared &quot;the damage this crock may do to [her] reputation&quot;.

&quot;Saving Mr. Banks&quot;, which depicted the making of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, starred Thompson in a leading role as P. L. Travers, the curmudgeonly author of the source novel, alongside Tom Hanks as Walt Disney. Her performance, in contrast to her widely panned appearance in &quot;Beautiful Creatures&quot;, was received enthusiastically, with one journalist writing &quot;Emma Thompson is back, firing on all cylinders.&quot; She found it to be the best script she had read in years and was delighted to be offered the role. She considered it the most challenging of her career because she had &quot;never really played anyone quite so contradictory or difficult before&quot;, but found the inconsistent and complicated character &quot;a blissful joy to embody&quot;. The film was well-received, grossed $112million worldwide, and Thompson&#x27;s performance garnered critical acclaim. The review in &quot;The Independent&quot; expressed thanks that her &quot;playing of Travers is so deft that we instantly warm to her, and forgive her her snobbery&quot;, while &quot;Total Film&quot;″s critic felt that Thompson brought depth to the &quot;predictable&quot; film with &quot;her best performance in years&quot;. Thompson was nominated for Best Actress at the BAFTAs, SAGs and Golden Globes, and was awarded the Lead Actress trophy from the National Board of Review. Meryl Streep, her co-star in &quot;Angels in America&quot;, admitted to being &quot;shocked&quot; at Thompson&#x27;s failure to receive an Oscar nomination for &quot;Saving Mr. Banks&quot;.

The romantic comedy &quot;The Love Punch&quot; (2013) gave Thompson her second consecutive leading role, where she played half of a divorced couple who reunite to steal the man&#x27;s ex-boss&#x27;s diamond. In March 2014, she made her first stage appearance in 24 years – and her New York debut – in a Lincoln Center production of &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot;. She appeared in the musical for five nights, and her &quot;playful&quot; performance of Mrs Lovett was highly praised; the critic Kayla Epstein wrote that she &quot;not only held her own against more experienced vocalists, but wound up running off with the show&quot;. She received her sixth Primetime Emmy Award nomination, specifically for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for the televised performance. In 2014, Thompson provided the narration for Jason Reitman&#x27;s comedy-drama film, &quot;Men, Women &amp; Children&quot;.

The period drama &quot;Effie Gray&quot;, a project that she had been working on for many years, based on the true-life story of John Ruskin&#x27;s disastrous marriage, was written by Thompson but became the subject of a copyright suit before being cleared for cinemas. The American playwright Gregory Murphy said that Thompson&#x27;s screenplay was an infringement on his play and screenplay &quot;The Countess&quot;, which he claimed he had submitted to Thompson through a mutual friend in 2003 to consider the role of Elizabeth Eastlake in a proposed film of his play, and to Thompson&#x27;s husband Greg Wise through a casting director to consider the role of John Ruskin in the play&#x27;s 2005 West End production. In 2008, Thompson announced that she and Wise &quot;had written a script together about John Ruskin, the Victorian art critic, which we want to make into a film.&quot; After meeting with Thompson and her producers, Potboiler Productions, Murphy was offered a screenwriting fee and co-screenwriting credit with Thompson in settlement of his claim. This settlement offer was later abandoned by Thompson, Greg Wise and their partner Donald Rosenfeld, when their company Sovereign Films took over production of the film and instigated the suit, creating the independent entity Effie Film, LLC to litigate it. In March 2013, District Court Judge Thomas P. Griesa, after allowing Thompson to submit a second revised screenplay into evidence from which Murphy claimed &quot;some of the most troubling material&quot; had been removed, ruled that while there were similarities, the screenplays were &quot;quite dissimilar in their two approaches to fictionalising the same historical events&quot;. In response to Murphy&#x27;s attorney&#x27;s concerns that the completed film &quot;Effie Gray&quot; would not adhere to Thompson&#x27;s second revised screenplay, Judge Griesa concluded his ruling by saying that Thompson&#x27;s film would not infringe Murphy&#x27;s play or screenplay &quot;only to the extent that it does not substantially deviate from the November 29, 2011 screenplay,&quot; the date of Thompson&#x27;s second revised screenplay. In May 2013, &quot;Effie Gray&#x27;s&quot; Cannes Film Festival premiere was cancelled. In October 2013, the film was withdrawn from the Mill Valley Film Festival in California due to &quot;unforeseen circumstances&quot; according to producer Rosenfeld. In December 2013, Thompson said of the still unreleased &quot;Effie Gray&quot; that its &quot;time has probably passed,&quot; comparing it to another project of hers that &quot;didn&#x27;t happen either&quot;. &quot;Effie Gray&quot; was released in October 2014, to a modest reception. Thompson plays Elizabeth Eastlake and Greg Wise plays John Ruskin. They both declined to promote the film. Camilla Long, reviewing &quot;Effie Gray&quot; in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, wrote &quot;nothing fits together&quot; and &quot;no one seems to know why they made this film. Where is Thompson&#x27;s passion and commitment, or any hint of what she intended to achieve.&quot; Manohla Dargis in her review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;Effie Gray&quot; &quot;The cinematic equivalent of a Brazilian wax, the movie omits much of the story&#x27;s most interesting material to create something that&#x27;s been smoothly denatured.&quot;

Thompson&#x27;s first film of 2015 was &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot;, a comedy adapted from the book by Bill Bryson of which she co-starred with Robert Redford and Nick Nolte. She next starred in &quot;The Legend of Barney Thomson&quot;. Her role was a 77-year-old foul-mouthed, chain-smoking, Glaswegian former prostitute, the mother of the title character. Neither film was a critical success, although the latter received some positive reviews and &quot;Empire&quot; magazine wrote that Thomson was &quot;unforgettable&quot;. Later that year, she had a supporting role in the restaurant-based film &quot;Burnt&quot;. In 2016, she starred in the World War II-drama &quot;Alone in Berlin&quot;, based on the story of Otto and Elise Hampel. She also co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Baby&quot; and appeared in the film as a doctor.

In 2017, Thompson appeared in a supporting role as Mrs. Potts (originally voiced by Angela Lansbury in the 1991 animated film) in Disney&#x27;s live-action adaptation of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, directed by Bill Condon and starring her &quot;Harry Potter&quot; co-star Emma Watson in the leading role of Belle, alongside Dan Stevens as the Beast. The film received positive reviews and grossed $1.2billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing live-action musical film, the second highest-grossing film of 2017, and the 17th highest-grossing film of all time. She also had a supporting role as a hippy in the Noah Baumbach-directed dramedy &quot;The Meyerowitz Stories&quot;, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival to critical acclaim. She followed it with a starring role in the film &quot;The Children Act&quot;, a drama about a family who refuse cancer treatment for their son based on religious beliefs. She had a cameo role as Queen Elizabeth I in the 2017 Christmas special of the BBC sitcom &quot;Upstart Crow&quot;. In 2018, she provided the voiceover for Greenpeace&#x27;s palm-oil awareness commercial which Iceland (supermarket) picked to promote as their 2018 Christmas advertisement. The commercial was rejected by the advertising organisation Clearcast due to Greenpeace&#x27;s alleged involvement in politics, thus violating their code of conduct. Also that year, she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2018 Birthday Honours for services to drama. In 2018, she also starred in &quot;Johnny English Strikes Again&quot; as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom alongside Rowan Atkinson

Thompson starred in the comedy-drama &quot;Late Night&quot; (2019), which was written by Mindy Kaling (who also co-starred in that film) and featured her as a popular television host who hires a new writer to keep the show from getting replaced. The film received positive reviews, with Thompson being singled out for praise, and Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Variety&quot; remarked that &quot;Thompson truly seems like a born talk-show host. Even when she&#x27;s just riffing, she grounds &quot;Late Night&quot; in something real.&quot; She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. In the same year, she voiced as the Yeti Elder in the stop-motion animated film &quot;Missing Link&quot;, reprised her role as Agent O in a more substantial part in &quot;Men in Black: International&quot;, and co-produced and co-starred alongside Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding in the festive romantic comedy &quot;Last Christmas&quot;, which was based on the song of the same name by George Michael, and was written by Thompson, her husband Greg Wise, and Bryony Kimmings.

In 2021, Thompson starred opposite Emma Stone as the titular protagonist villain in &quot;Cruella&quot;, a Disney live-action spin-off/reboot of &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;, directed by Craig Gillespie, which was released on 28 May 2021 to positive reviews and has grossed $233million worldwide against its $100million budget. She won praise from critics for the role of the Baroness with Alonso Duralde from &quot;The Wrap&quot; writing, &quot;Thompson sinking every last tooth into a role that&#x27;s half Miranda Priestly and half Reynolds Woodcock.&quot; In 2022, Thompson starred opposite Daryl McCormack in the sex comedy-drama &quot;Good Luck to You, Leo Grande&quot;, written by Katy Brand and directed by Sophie Hyde.

Thompson plays the authoritarian headmistress Miss Trunchbull in the film adaptation of &quot;Matilda the Musical&quot;, which in turn is based on the novel of the same name by Roald Dahl. It is directed by Matthew Warchus, with a script written by Dennis Kelly and songs composed by Tim Minchin. Following its world premiere at the BFI London Film Festival on 5 October 2022, film critic Robbie Collin of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; wrote Thompson&#x27;s portrayal of Trunchbull is &quot;a deranged villain to remember&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; critic Peter Bradshaw stated &quot;the gleefully sly comedy kindred spirits of Thompson and Minchin come together to form the film&#x27;s bedrock of naughtiness&quot;. In 2022, she also starred alongside Lily James and Sajal Aly in the romantic comedy &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It?&quot;

In the upcoming film &quot;The Fisherwoman&quot;, directed by Brian Kirk, Thompson is attached to star alongside Laurel Marsden and Judy Greer. The film was shot in the 2024 winter in North Karelia, Finland, where Thompson praised the skills of the local working crew, even writing a laudatory letter dedicated to the Finns, published by &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot;. Because of this, the Finnish president Alexander Stubb personally called Thompson and thanked the actress &quot;for her beautiful words, trust in Finns and welcomed her back to Finland&quot;.

==Reception and acting style==
Thompson is regarded to be among the best actresses of her generation and one of Britain&#x27;s most recognisable actresses, held in high regard within Hollywood. Early in her career she was closely associated with her first husband, Kenneth Branagh. The public warmed to her after the separation, and she became one of the key actresses of the 1990s. Her status has continued to grow; in 2008, journalist Sarah Sands stated that Thompson has improved with age and experience, and Mark Kermode said of her performances, &quot;There is something about her which is — you just trust her. You just think &#x27;I&#x27;m in proper hands here.&#x27; ... She&#x27;s up there with the great, I mean really great, British female performers&quot;.

Thompson is particularly known for playing reticent women, and Sands describes her as &quot;the best actress of our times on suffering borne with poignant dignity&quot;. According to Kate Kellaway of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, she specialises in playing &quot;a good woman in a frock&quot;. She also plays many haughty characters, with a &quot;bracing, nanny-like demeanour&quot;, but she is noted for her ability to win the empathy of audiences. Thompson belongs to a group of highly decorated British actresses including Judi Dench, Kate Winslet and Helena Bonham Carter who are known for appearing in &quot;heritage films&quot; and typically showing &quot;restraint, rendering emotions through intellect rather than feelings, and a sense of irony, which demonstrates the heroine&#x27;s superior understanding&quot;. Projecting a typically &quot;British image&quot;, Thompson&#x27;s often dogmatic and tight-jawed manner has also been compared to that of Maggie Smith.

With a background in comedy, Thompson&#x27;s performances are typically delivered with an ironic touch. Ang Lee, director of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, stated that Thompson&#x27;s comedic approach may be her greatest asset as an actress, remarking, &quot;Emma is an extremely funny lady. Like Austen, she&#x27;s laughing at her own culture while she&#x27;s a part of it.&quot; Thompson has stated that the &quot;most moving things are often also funny, in life and in art&quot; which is present in her film work. She often brings her real personality to her roles, and Kellaway believes that her lack of conventional beauty contributes to her likeability as an actress.
==Writing==
In 2012, Thompson wrote &quot;The Further Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot; as an addition to the Peter Rabbit series by Beatrix Potter to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the publication of &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot;. She was approached by the publishers to write it, the first authorised Peter story since 1930 and the only one not written by Potter. The book falls in the middle of the earlier series, rather than at the end, and takes Peter Rabbit outside of Mr. McGregor&#x27;s garden and into Scotland. It was a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller. In 2013, Thompson wrote a second book in the series titled &quot;The Christmas Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot;. A third book, &quot;The Spectacular Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot;, was released in 2014. In 2018, Thompson said she would like to write about &quot;what it&#x27;s like being human now&quot;.

==Other work==

In 2014, Thompson was among a group of influential British women, which included Annie Lennox and Rita Ora, to feature in the latest iteration of British retailer Marks &amp; Spencer&#x27;s &#x27;Leading Ladies&#x27; marketing campaign.

==Acting credits and accolades==
Thompson has won two Academy Awards, for Best Actress in James Ivory&#x27;s &quot;Howards End&quot; (1992) and Best Adapted Screenplay for Ang Lee&#x27;s &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; (1995). Thompson has received numerous accolades including three BAFTA Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and a Primetime Emmy Award, in addition to nominations for two Grammy Awards, two Independent Spirit Awards, and six Screen Actors Guild Awards. In 2018, she was made a Dame (DBE) by Queen Elizabeth II for her contributions to drama.

==Personal life==
Thompson has stated that she feels Scottish, saying: &quot;not only because I am half Scottish but also because I&#x27;ve spent half my life [in Scotland]&quot;. She frequently returns to Scotland and visits Dunoon in Argyll and Bute. She owns a home nearby, on the shore of Loch Eck.

===Relationships===
Thompson&#x27;s first husband was actor and director Kenneth Branagh, whom she met in 1987 while filming the television series &quot;Fortunes of War&quot;. They married in 1989 and appeared in several films together, with Branagh often casting her in his productions. Dubbed a &quot;golden couple&quot; by the British press, their relationship received substantial media coverage. The pair attempted to keep the relationship private, refusing to be interviewed or photographed together. Thompson and Branagh announced their separation in September 1995. They cited their work schedules as the reason, but it later emerged that he was having an affair with actress Helena Bonham Carter.
Thompson was living alone as her relationship with Branagh deteriorated and she became depressed. While filming &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; in 1995, she began a relationship with her co-star Greg Wise. On how she was able to overcome her depression, she stated, &quot;Work saved me and Greg saved me. He picked up the pieces and put them together again.&quot; The couple have a daughter, Gaia, who was conceived via in vitro fertilisation when Thompson was 39.

Thompson and Wise married in Dunoon in 2003. The family&#x27;s permanent residence is in West Hampstead, London, on the same road as her childhood home. Also in 2003, Thompson and Wise informally adopted a Rwandan orphan and former child soldier named Tindyebwa Agaba. They met at a Refugee Council event when he was sixteen, and she invited him to spend Christmas at their home. &quot;Slowly,&quot; Thompson has commented, &quot;he became a sort of permanent fixture, came on holiday to Scotland with us, became part of the family.&quot; Agaba became a British citizen in 2009.

On 28 February 2020, Thompson and Wise were sworn in as honorary citizens of Venice and became legal residents of Italy. The couple had previously purchased a house in the city and indicated their intention to relocate to Italy permanently. They retain a home in West Hampstead.

===Views and activism===
Thompson has said of her religious views:

She is politically liberal and a supporter of the Labour Party; she told the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Andrew Marr Show&quot; in 2010 that she had been a member of the party &quot;all my life&quot;. Thompson endorsed Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in both the 2015 and 2016 Labour Party leadership elections. She has also expressed support for the now-defunct Women&#x27;s Equality Party.

Thompson has been a campaigner since her youth. Since becoming a public figure she has regularly voiced her views and been involved in many issues, prompting criticism that she is overly outspoken. She has justified her assertiveness by saying, &quot;[W]hat I feel is that we all need to speak up and a woman who has got a louder voice needs to shout very loudly indeed.&quot;

She is particularly active in human rights work. She is chair of the Helen Bamber Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, a patron of the Refugee Council, and has a therapy room in her office for traumatised refugees. In 2017, she marched in support of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, an Iranian-British charity worker who was held captive in Iran. Thompson is a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation, and &quot;Time&quot; magazine named her a &quot;European Hero&quot; in 2009 in recognition of &quot;her work to highlight the plight of AIDS sufferers in Africa&quot;.

She is an active environmentalist and a supporter of Greenpeace; in January 2009, as part of her campaign against climate change, she and three other members of the organisation bought land near the village of Sipson to deter the building of a third runway for Heathrow Airport. In August 2014, Thompson and her daughter Gaia went on a Greenpeace &quot;Save the Arctic&quot; expedition to raise awareness of the dangers of drilling for oil. She narrated The Real News Network&#x27;s &quot;The Doubt Machine: Inside the Koch Brothers&#x27; War on Climate Science&quot;, a documentary short about Koch Industries and its efforts to discredit climate research, which was released on 31 October 2016. She supported the London Extinction Rebellion rally against climate change in 2019, although she received some criticism for having flown to attend it. She is also an ambassador for the Galapagos Conservation Trust.

In 2010, Thompson criticised people who use &quot;sloppy language&quot;. Speaking with the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, she said: &quot;I went to give a talk at my old school and the girls were all doing their &#x27;likes&#x27; and &#x27;innits?&#x27; and &#x27;it ain&#x27;ts&#x27;, which drives me insane. I told them &#x27;Just don&#x27;t do it. Because it makes you sound stupid and you&#x27;re not stupid. There is the necessity to have two languages – one that you use with your mates and the other that you need in any official capacity.&quot;

<text>In statistics, the &quot;k&quot;th order statistic of a statistical sample is equal to its &quot;k&quot;th-smallest value. Together with rank statistics, order statistics are among the most fundamental tools in non-parametric statistics and inference.

Important special cases of the order statistics are the minimum and maximum value of a sample, and (with some qualifications discussed below) the sample median and other sample quantiles.

When using probability theory to analyze order statistics of random samples from a continuous distribution, the cumulative distribution function is used to reduce the analysis to the case of order statistics of the uniform distribution.

== Notation and examples ==

For example, suppose that four numbers are observed or recorded, resulting in a sample of size 4. If the sample values are

:6, 9, 3, 7,

the order statistics would be denoted

:formula_1

where the subscript enclosed in parentheses indicates the th order statistic of the sample.

The first order statistic (or smallest order statistic) is always the minimum of the sample, that is,

:formula_2

where, following a common convention, we use upper-case letters to refer to random variables, and lower-case letters (as above) to refer to their actual observed values.

Similarly, for a sample of size , the th order statistic (or largest order statistic) is the maximum, that is,

:formula_3

The sample range is the difference between the maximum and minimum. It is a function of the order statistics:

:formula_4

A similar important statistic in exploratory data analysis that is simply related to the order statistics is the sample interquartile range.

The sample median may or may not be an order statistic, since there is a single middle value only when the number of observations is odd. More precisely, if for some integer , then the sample median is formula_5 and so is an order statistic. On the other hand, when is even, and there are two middle values, formula_6 and formula_5, and the sample median is some function of the two (usually the average) and hence not an order statistic. Similar remarks apply to all sample quantiles.

== Probabilistic analysis ==

Given any random variables &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;, the order statistics X(1), X(2), ..., X(&quot;n&quot;) are also random variables, defined by sorting the values (realizations) of &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; in increasing order.

When the random variables &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; form a sample they are independent and identically distributed. This is the case treated below. In general, the random variables &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; can arise by sampling from more than one population. Then they are independent, but not necessarily identically distributed, and their joint probability distribution is given by the Bapat–Beg theorem.

From now on, we will assume that the random variables under consideration are continuous and, where convenient, we will also assume that they have a probability density function (PDF), that is, they are absolutely continuous. The peculiarities of the analysis of distributions assigning mass to points (in particular, discrete distributions) are discussed at the end.

=== Cumulative distribution function of order statistics ===

For a random sample as above, with cumulative distribution formula_8, the order statistics for that sample have cumulative distributions as follows
(where &quot;r&quot; specifies which order statistic):
formula_9
The proof of this formula is pure combinatorics: for the formula_10th order statistic to be formula_11, the number of samples that are formula_12 has to be between formula_13 and formula_14. In the case that formula_15 is the largest order statistic formula_11, there has to be formula_17 samples formula_11 (each with an independent probability of formula_19) and formula_20 samples formula_21 (each with an independent probability of formula_22). Finally there are formula_23 different ways of choosing which of the formula_24 samples are of the formula_11 kind.

The corresponding probability density function may be derived from this result, and is found to be

:formula_26

Moreover, there are two special cases, which have CDFs that are easy to compute.

:formula_27

:formula_28

Which can be derived by careful consideration of probabilities.

=== Probability distributions of order statistics ===

==== Order statistics sampled from a uniform distribution ====

In this section we show that the order statistics of the uniform distribution on the unit interval have marginal distributions belonging to the beta distribution family. We also give a simple method to derive the joint distribution of any number of order statistics, and finally translate these results to arbitrary continuous distributions using the cdf.

We assume throughout this section that formula_29 is a random sample drawn from a continuous distribution with cdf formula_30. Denoting formula_31 we obtain the corresponding random sample formula_32 from the standard uniform distribution. Note that the order statistics also satisfy formula_33.

The probability density function of the order statistic formula_34 is equal to

:formula_35

that is, the &quot;k&quot;th order statistic of the uniform distribution is a beta-distributed random variable.

:formula_36

The proof of these statements is as follows. For formula_34 to be between &quot;u&quot; and &quot;u&quot; + &quot;du&quot;, it is necessary that exactly &quot;k&quot; − 1 elements of the sample are smaller than &quot;u&quot;, and that at least one is between &quot;u&quot; and &quot;u&quot; + d&quot;u&quot;. The probability that more than one is in this latter interval is already formula_38, so we have to calculate the probability that exactly &quot;k&quot; − 1, 1 and &quot;n&quot; − &quot;k&quot; observations fall in the intervals formula_39, formula_40 and formula_41 respectively. This equals (refer to multinomial distribution for details)

:formula_42

and the result follows.

The mean of this distribution is &quot;k&quot; / (&quot;n&quot; + 1).

==== The joint distribution of the order statistics of the uniform distribution ====

Similarly, for &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;j&quot;, the joint probability density function of the two order statistics &quot;U&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) &lt; &quot;U&quot;(&quot;j&quot;) can be shown to be

:formula_43

which is (up to terms of higher order than formula_44) the probability that &quot;i&quot; − 1, 1, &quot;j&quot; − 1 − &quot;i&quot;, 1 and &quot;n&quot; − &quot;j&quot; sample elements fall in the intervals formula_39, formula_40, formula_47, formula_48, formula_49 respectively.

One reasons in an entirely analogous way to derive the higher-order joint distributions. Perhaps surprisingly, the joint density of the &quot;n&quot; order statistics turns out to be &quot;constant&quot;:

:formula_50

One way to understand this is that the unordered sample does have constant density equal to 1, and that there are &quot;n&quot;! different permutations of the sample corresponding to the same sequence of order statistics. This is related to the fact that 1/&quot;n&quot;! is the volume of the region formula_51. It is also related with another particularity of order statistics of uniform random variables: It follows from the BRS-inequality that the maximum expected number of uniform U(0,1] random variables one can choose from a sample of size n with a sum up not exceeding formula_52, which is thus invariant on the set of all formula_53
with constant product formula_54.

Using the above formulas, one can derive the distribution of the range of the order statistics, that is the distribution of formula_55, i.e. maximum minus the minimum. More generally, for formula_56, formula_57 also has a beta distribution: formula_58From these formulas we can derive the covariance between two order statistics:formula_59The formula follows from noting that formula_60and comparing that with formula_61where formula_62, which is the actual distribution of the difference.

==== Order statistics sampled from an exponential distribution ====

For formula_63 a random sample of size &quot;n&quot; from an exponential distribution with parameter &quot;λ&quot;, the order statistics &quot;X&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) for &quot;i&quot; = 1,2,3, ..., &quot;n&quot; each have distribution

::formula_64

where the &quot;Z&quot;&quot;j&quot; are iid standard exponential random variables (i.e. with rate parameter 1). This result was first published by Alfréd Rényi.

==== Order statistics sampled from an Erlang distribution ====

The Laplace transform of order statistics may be sampled from an Erlang distribution via a path counting method .

==== The joint distribution of the order statistics of an absolutely continuous distribution ====

If &quot;F&quot;&quot;X&quot; is absolutely continuous, it has a density such that formula_65, and we can use the substitutions

:formula_66

and

:formula_67

to derive the following probability density functions for the order statistics of a sample of size &quot;n&quot; drawn from the distribution of &quot;X&quot;:

:formula_68

:formula_69 where formula_70

:formula_71 where formula_72

== Application: confidence intervals for quantiles ==

An interesting question is how well the order statistics perform as estimators of the quantiles of the underlying distribution.

=== A small-sample-size example ===

The simplest case to consider is how well the sample median estimates the population median.

As an example, consider a random sample of size 6. In that case, the sample median is usually defined as the midpoint of the interval delimited by the 3rd and 4th order statistics. However, we know from the preceding discussion that the probability that this interval actually contains the population median is 

:formula_73

Although the sample median is probably among the best distribution-independent point estimates of the population median, what this example illustrates is that it is not a particularly good one in absolute terms. In this particular case, a better confidence interval for the median is the one delimited by the 2nd and 5th order statistics, which contains the population median with probability

:formula_74

With such a small sample size, if one wants at least 95% confidence, one is reduced to saying that the median is between the minimum and the maximum of the 6 observations with probability 31/32 or approximately 97%. Size 6 is, in fact, the smallest sample size such that the interval determined by the minimum and the maximum is at least a 95% confidence interval for the population median.
=== Large sample sizes ===

For the uniform distribution, as &quot;n&quot; tends to infinity, the &quot;p&quot;th sample quantile is asymptotically normally distributed, since it is approximated by

: formula_75

For a general distribution &quot;F&quot; with a continuous non-zero density at &quot;F&quot; −1(&quot;p&quot;), a similar asymptotic normality applies:

: formula_76

where &quot;f&quot; is the density function, and &quot;F&quot; −1 is the quantile function associated with &quot;F&quot;. One of the first people to mention and prove this result was Frederick Mosteller in his seminal paper in 1946. Further research led in the 1960s to the Bahadur representation which provides information about the errorbounds. The convergence to normal distribution also holds in a stronger sense, such as convergence in relative entropy or KL divergence.

An interesting observation can be made in the case where the distribution is symmetric, and the population median equals the population mean. In this case, the sample mean, by the central limit theorem, is also asymptotically normally distributed, but with variance σ2&quot;/n&quot; instead. This asymptotic analysis suggests that the mean outperforms the median in cases of low kurtosis, and vice versa. For example, the median achieves better confidence intervals for the Laplace distribution, while the mean performs better for &quot;X&quot; that are normally distributed.

==== Proof ====
It can be shown that

: formula_77

where

: formula_78

with &quot;Zi&quot; being independent identically distributed exponential random variables with rate 1. Since &quot;X&quot;/&quot;n&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;/&quot;n&quot; are asymptotically normally distributed by the CLT, our results follow by application of the delta method.

== Mutual Information of Order Statistics ==
The mutual information and f-divergence between order statistics have also been considered. For example, if the parent distribution is continuous, then for all formula_79
: formula_80
In other words, mutual information is independent of the parent distribution. For discrete random variables, the equality need not to hold and we only have 
: formula_81

The mutual information between uniform order statistics is given by 
: formula_82
where 
: formula_83
where formula_84 is the formula_85-th harmonic number. 
== Application: Non-parametric density estimation ==

Moments of the distribution for the first order statistic can be used to develop a non-parametric density estimator. Suppose, we want to estimate the density formula_86 at the point formula_87. Consider the random variables formula_88, which are i.i.d with distribution function formula_89. In particular, formula_90.

The expected value of the first order statistic formula_91 given a sample of formula_92 total observations yields,

: formula_93

where formula_94 is the quantile function associated with the distribution formula_95, and formula_96. This equation in combination with a jackknifing technique becomes the basis for the following density estimation algorithm,

 Input: A sample of formula_92 observations. formula_98 points of density evaluation. Tuning parameter formula_99 (usually 1/3).
 Output: formula_100 estimated density at the points of evaluation.

 1: Set formula_101
 2: Set formula_102
 3: Create an formula_103 matrix formula_104 which holds formula_105 subsets with formula_106 observations each.
 4: Create a vector formula_107 to hold the density evaluations.
 5: for formula_108 do
 6: for formula_109 do
 7: Find the nearest distance formula_110 to the current point formula_111 within the formula_85th subset
 8: end for
 9: Compute the subset average of distances to formula_113
 10: Compute the density estimate at formula_114
 11: end for
 12: return formula_107

In contrast to the bandwidth/length based tuning parameters for histogram and kernel based approaches, the tuning parameter for the order statistic based density estimator is the size of sample subsets. Such an estimator is more robust than histogram and kernel based approaches, for example densities like the Cauchy distribution (which lack finite moments) can be inferred without the need for specialized modifications such as IQR based bandwidths. This is because the first moment of the order statistic always exists if the expected value of the underlying distribution does, but the converse is not necessarily true.

== Dealing with discrete variables ==
Suppose formula_116 are i.i.d. random variables from a discrete distribution with cumulative distribution function formula_117 and probability mass function formula_118. To find the probabilities of the formula_119 order statistics, three values are first needed, namely
:formula_120

The cumulative distribution function of the formula_119 order statistic can be computed by noting that

:formula_122

Similarly, formula_123 is given by

:formula_124

Note that the probability mass function of formula_125 is just the difference of these values, that is to say

:formula_126

== Computing order statistics ==
The problem of computing the &quot;k&quot;th smallest (or largest) element of a list is called the selection problem and is solved by a selection algorithm. Although this problem is difficult for very large lists, sophisticated selection algorithms have been created that can solve this problem in time proportional to the number of elements in the list, even if the list is totally unordered. If the data is stored in certain specialized data structures, this time can be brought down to O(log &quot;n&quot;). In many applications all order statistics are required, in which case a sorting algorithm can be used and the time taken is O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;).

== Applications ==

Order statistics have a lot of applications in areas as reliability theory, financial mathematics, survival analysis, epidemiology, sports, quality control, actuarial risk, etc. There is an extensive literature devoted to studies on applications of order statistics in these fields.

For example, a recent application in actuarial risk can be found in, where some weighted premium principles in terms of record claims and kth record claims are provided.

<text>In internationalization, CJK characters is a collective term for graphemes used in the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean writing systems, which each include Chinese characters. It can also go by CJKV to include Chữ Nôm, the Chinese-origin logographic script formerly used for the Vietnamese language, or CJKVZ to also include Sawndip, used to write the Zhuang languages.

== Character repertoire ==
Standard Mandarin Chinese and Standard Cantonese are written almost exclusively in Chinese characters. Over 3,000 characters are required for general literacy, with up to 40,000 characters for reasonably complete coverage. Japanese uses fewer characters—general literacy in Japanese can be expected with 2,136 characters. The use of Chinese characters in Korea is increasingly rare, although idiosyncratic use of Chinese characters in proper names requires knowledge (and therefore availability) of many more characters. Even today, however, South Korean students are taught 1,800 characters.

Other scripts used for these languages, such as bopomofo and the Latin-based pinyin for Chinese, hiragana and katakana for Japanese, and hangul for Korean, are not strictly &quot;CJK characters&quot;, although CJK character sets almost invariably include them as necessary for full coverage of the target languages.

The sinologist Carl Leban (1971) produced an early survey of CJK encoding systems.

Until the early 20th century, Classical Chinese was the written language of government and scholarship in Vietnam. Popular literature in Vietnamese was written in the script, consisting of Chinese characters with many characters created locally. Since the 1920s, the script since then used for recording literature has been the Latin-based Vietnamese alphabet.

== Encoding ==
The number of characters required for complete coverage of all these languages&#x27; needs cannot fit in the 256-character code space of 8-bit character encodings, requiring at least a 16-bit fixed width encoding or multi-byte variable-length encodings. The 16-bit fixed width encodings, such as those from Unicode up to and including version 2.0, are now deprecated due to the requirement to encode more characters than a 16-bit encoding can accommodate—Unicode 5.0 has some 70,000 Han characters—and the requirement by the Chinese government that software in China support the GB 18030 character set.

Although CJK encodings have common character sets, the encodings often used to represent them have been developed separately by different East Asian governments and software companies, and are mutually incompatible. Unicode has attempted, with some controversy, to unify the character sets in a process known as Han unification.

CJK character encodings should consist minimally of Han characters plus language-specific phonetic scripts such as pinyin, bopomofo, hiragana, katakana and hangul.

CJK character encodings include:

* Big5 (the most prevalent encoding before Unicode was implemented)
* CCCII
* CNS 11643 (official standard of Republic of China)
* EUC-JP
* EUC-KR
* GB 2312 (subset and predecessor of GB 18030)
* GB 18030 (mandated standard in the People&#x27;s Republic of China)
* Giga Character Set (GCS)
* ISO 2022-JP
* ISO-2022-KR
* KS X 1001
* KPS 9566
* Shift-JIS
* TRON
* Unicode
The CJK character sets take up the bulk of the assigned Unicode code space. There is much controversy among Japanese experts of Chinese characters about the desirability and technical merit of the Han unification process used to map multiple Chinese and Japanese character sets into a single set of unified characters.

All three languages can be written both left-to-right and top-to-bottom (right-to-left and top-to-bottom in ancient documents), but are usually considered left-to-right scripts when discussing encoding issues.

== Legal status ==
Libraries cooperated on encoding standards for JACKPHY characters in the early 1980s. According to Ken Lunde, the abbreviation &quot;CJK&quot; was a registered trademark of Research Libraries Group (which merged with OCLC in 2006). The trademark owned by OCLC between 1987 and 2009 has now expired.

<text>In mathematics, an infinitesimal number is a non-zero quantity that is closer to 0 than any non-zero real number is. The word &quot;infinitesimal&quot; comes from a 17th-century Modern Latin coinage &quot;infinitesimus&quot;, which originally referred to the &quot;infinity-eth&quot; item in a sequence.

Infinitesimals do not exist in the standard real number system, but they do exist in other number systems, such as the surreal number system and the hyperreal number system, which can be thought of as the real numbers augmented with both infinitesimal and infinite quantities; the augmentations are the reciprocals of one another.

Infinitesimal numbers were introduced in the development of calculus, in which the derivative was first conceived as a ratio of two infinitesimal quantities. This definition was not rigorously formalized. As calculus developed further, infinitesimals were replaced by limits, which can be calculated using the standard real numbers.

In the 3rd century BC Archimedes used what eventually came to be known as the method of indivisibles in his work &quot;The Method of Mechanical Theorems&quot; to find areas of regions and volumes of solids. In his formal published treatises, Archimedes solved the same problem using the method of exhaustion.

Infinitesimals regained popularity in the 20th century with Abraham Robinson&#x27;s development of nonstandard analysis and the hyperreal numbers, which, after centuries of controversy, showed that a formal treatment of infinitesimal calculus was possible. Following this, mathematicians developed surreal numbers, a related formalization of infinite and infinitesimal numbers that include both hyperreal cardinal and ordinal numbers, which is the largest ordered field.

Vladimir Arnold wrote in 1990:

The crucial insight for making infinitesimals feasible mathematical entities was that they could still retain certain properties such as angle or slope, even if these entities were infinitely small.

Infinitesimals are a basic ingredient in calculus as developed by Leibniz, including the law of continuity and the transcendental law of homogeneity. In common speech, an infinitesimal object is an object that is smaller than any feasible measurement, but not zero in size—or, so small that it cannot be distinguished from zero by any available means. Hence, when used as an adjective in mathematics, &quot;infinitesimal&quot; means infinitely small, smaller than any standard real number. Infinitesimals are often compared to other infinitesimals of similar size, as in examining the derivative of a function. An infinite number of infinitesimals are summed to calculate an integral.

The modern concept of infinitesimals was introduced around 1670 by either Nicolaus Mercator or Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. The 15th century saw the work of Nicholas of Cusa, further developed in the 17th century by Johannes Kepler, in particular, the calculation of the area of a circle by representing the latter as an infinite-sided polygon. Simon Stevin&#x27;s work on the decimal representation of all numbers in the 16th century prepared the ground for the real continuum. Bonaventura Cavalieri&#x27;s method of indivisibles led to an extension of the results of the classical authors. The method of indivisibles related to geometrical figures as being composed of entities of codimension 1. John Wallis&#x27;s infinitesimals differed from indivisibles in that he would decompose geometrical figures into infinitely thin building blocks of the same dimension as the figure, preparing the ground for general methods of the integral calculus. He exploited an infinitesimal denoted 1/∞ in area calculations.

The use of infinitesimals by Leibniz relied upon heuristic principles, such as the law of continuity: what succeeds for the finite numbers succeeds also for the infinite numbers and vice versa; and the transcendental law of homogeneity that specifies procedures for replacing expressions involving unassignable quantities, by expressions involving only assignable ones. The 18th century saw routine use of infinitesimals by mathematicians such as Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange. Augustin-Louis Cauchy exploited infinitesimals both in defining continuity in his &quot;Cours d&#x27;Analyse&quot;, and in defining an early form of a Dirac delta function. As Cantor and Dedekind were developing more abstract versions of Stevin&#x27;s continuum, Paul du Bois-Reymond wrote a series of papers on infinitesimal-enriched continua based on growth rates of functions. Du Bois-Reymond&#x27;s work inspired both Émile Borel and Thoralf Skolem. Borel explicitly linked du Bois-Reymond&#x27;s work to Cauchy&#x27;s work on rates of growth of infinitesimals. Skolem developed the first non-standard models of arithmetic in 1934. A mathematical implementation of both the law of continuity and infinitesimals was achieved by Abraham Robinson in 1961, who developed nonstandard analysis based on earlier work by Edwin Hewitt in 1948 and Jerzy Łoś in 1955. The hyperreals implement an infinitesimal-enriched continuum and the transfer principle implements Leibniz&#x27;s law of continuity. The standard part function implements Fermat&#x27;s adequality.

== History of the infinitesimal ==
The notion of infinitely small quantities was discussed by the Eleatic School. The Greek mathematician Archimedes (c. 287 BC – c. 212 BC), in &quot;The Method of Mechanical Theorems&quot;, was the first to propose a logically rigorous definition of infinitesimals. His Archimedean property defines a number &quot;x&quot; as infinite if it satisfies the conditions ..., and infinitesimal if and a similar set of conditions holds for &quot;x&quot; and the reciprocals of the positive integers. A number system is said to be Archimedean if it contains no infinite or infinitesimal members.

The English mathematician John Wallis introduced the expression 1/∞ in his 1655 book &quot;Treatise on the Conic Sections&quot;. The symbol, which denotes the reciprocal, or inverse, of ∞, is the symbolic representation of the mathematical concept of an infinitesimal. In his &quot;Treatise on the Conic Sections&quot;, Wallis also discusses the concept of a relationship between the symbolic representation of infinitesimal 1/∞ that he introduced and the concept of infinity for which he introduced the symbol ∞. The concept suggests a thought experiment of adding an infinite number of parallelograms of infinitesimal width to form a finite area. This concept was the predecessor to the modern method of integration used in integral calculus. The conceptual origins of the concept of the infinitesimal 1/∞ can be traced as far back as the Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea, whose Zeno&#x27;s dichotomy paradox was the first mathematical concept to consider the relationship between a finite interval and an interval approaching that of an infinitesimal-sized interval.

Infinitesimals were the subject of political and religious controversies in 17th century Europe, including a ban on infinitesimals issued by clerics in Rome in 1632.

Prior to the invention of calculus mathematicians were able to calculate tangent lines using Pierre de Fermat&#x27;s method of adequality and René Descartes&#x27; method of normals. There is debate among scholars as to whether the method was infinitesimal or algebraic in nature. When Newton and Leibniz invented the calculus, they made use of infinitesimals, Newton&#x27;s &quot;fluxions&quot; and Leibniz&#x27; &quot;differential&quot;. The use of infinitesimals was attacked as incorrect by Bishop Berkeley in his work &quot;The Analyst&quot;. Mathematicians, scientists, and engineers continued to use infinitesimals to produce correct results. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the calculus was reformulated by Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Bernard Bolzano, Karl Weierstrass, Cantor, Dedekind, and others using the (ε, δ)-definition of limit and set theory.
While the followers of Cantor, Dedekind, and Weierstrass sought to rid analysis of infinitesimals, and their philosophical allies like Bertrand Russell and Rudolf Carnap declared that infinitesimals are &quot;pseudoconcepts&quot;, Hermann Cohen and his Marburg school of neo-Kantianism sought to develop a working logic of infinitesimals. The mathematical study of systems containing infinitesimals continued through the work of Levi-Civita, Giuseppe Veronese, Paul du Bois-Reymond, and others, throughout the late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries, as documented by Philip Ehrlich (2006). In the 20th century, it was found that infinitesimals could serve as a basis for calculus and analysis (see hyperreal numbers).

== First-order properties ==
In extending the real numbers to include infinite and infinitesimal quantities, one typically wishes to be as conservative as possible by not changing any of their elementary properties. This guarantees that as many familiar results as possible are still available. Typically, &quot;elementary&quot; means that there is no quantification over sets, but only over elements. This limitation allows statements of the form &quot;for any number x...&quot; For example, the axiom that states &quot;for any number &quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot; + 0 = &quot;x&quot;&quot; would still apply. The same is true for quantification over several numbers, e.g., &quot;for any numbers &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, &quot;xy&quot; = &quot;yx&quot;.&quot; However, statements of the form &quot;for any &quot;set&quot; &quot;S&quot; of numbers ...&quot; may not carry over. Logic with this limitation on quantification is referred to as first-order logic.

The resulting extended number system cannot agree with the reals on all properties that can be expressed by quantification over sets, because the goal is to construct a non-Archimedean system, and the Archimedean principle can be expressed by quantification over sets. One can conservatively extend any theory including reals, including set theory, to include infinitesimals, just by adding a countably infinite list of axioms that assert that a number is smaller than 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, and so on. Similarly, the completeness property cannot be expected to carry over, because the reals are the unique complete ordered field up to isomorphism.

We can distinguish three levels at which a non-Archimedean number system could have first-order properties compatible with those of the reals:

# An ordered field obeys all the usual axioms of the real number system that can be stated in first-order logic. For example, the commutativity axiom &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; = &quot;y&quot; + &quot;x&quot; holds.
# A real closed field has all the first-order properties of the real number system, regardless of whether they are usually taken as axiomatic, for statements involving the basic ordered-field relations +, ×, and ≤. This is a stronger condition than obeying the ordered-field axioms. More specifically, one includes additional first-order properties, such as the existence of a root for every odd-degree polynomial. For example, every number must have a cube root.
# The system could have all the first-order properties of the real number system for statements involving &quot;any&quot; relations (regardless of whether those relations can be expressed using +, ×, and ≤). For example, there would have to be a sine function that is well defined for infinite inputs; the same is true for every real function.

Systems in category 1, at the weak end of the spectrum, are relatively easy to construct but do not allow a full treatment of classical analysis using infinitesimals in the spirit of Newton and Leibniz. For example, the transcendental functions are defined in terms of infinite limiting processes, and therefore there is typically no way to define them in first-order logic. Increasing the analytic strength of the system by passing to categories 2 and 3, we find that the flavor of the treatment tends to become less constructive, and it becomes more difficult to say anything concrete about the hierarchical structure of infinities and infinitesimals.

== Number systems that include infinitesimals ==

=== Formal series ===

==== Laurent series ====
An example from category 1 above is the field of Laurent series with a finite number of negative-power terms. For example, the Laurent series consisting only of the constant term 1 is identified with the real number 1, and the series with only the linear term &quot;x&quot; is thought of as the simplest infinitesimal, from which the other infinitesimals are constructed. Dictionary ordering is used, which is equivalent to considering higher powers of &quot;x&quot; as negligible compared to lower powers. David O. Tall refers to this system as the super-reals, not to be confused with the superreal number system of Dales and Woodin. Since a Taylor series evaluated with a Laurent series as its argument is still a Laurent series, the system can be used to do calculus on transcendental functions if they are analytic. These infinitesimals have different first-order properties than the reals because, for example, the basic infinitesimal &quot;x&quot; does not have a square root.

==== The Levi-Civita field ====
The Levi-Civita field is similar to the Laurent series, but is algebraically closed. For example, the basic infinitesimal x has a square root. This field is rich enough to allow a significant amount of analysis to be done, but its elements can still be represented on a computer in the same sense that real numbers can be represented in floating-point.

==== Transseries ====
The field of transseries is larger than the Levi-Civita field. An example of a transseries is:

:formula_1

where for purposes of ordering &quot;x&quot; is considered infinite.

=== Surreal numbers ===
Conway&#x27;s surreal numbers fall into category 2, except that the surreal numbers form a proper class and not a set. They are a system designed to be as rich as possible in different sizes of numbers, but not necessarily for convenience in doing analysis, in the sense that every ordered field is a subfield of the surreal numbers. There is a natural extension of the exponential function to the surreal numbers.

=== Hyperreals ===

The most widespread technique for handling infinitesimals is the hyperreals, developed by Abraham Robinson in the 1960s. They fall into category 3 above, having been designed that way so all of classical analysis can be carried over from the reals. This property of being able to carry over all relations in a natural way is known as the transfer principle, proved by Jerzy Łoś in 1955. For example, the transcendental function sin has a natural counterpart *sin that takes a hyperreal input and gives a hyperreal output, and similarly the set of natural numbers formula_2 has a natural counterpart formula_3, which contains both finite and infinite integers. A proposition such as formula_4 carries over to the hyperreals as formula_5 .

=== Superreals ===

The superreal number system of Dales and Woodin is a generalization of the hyperreals. It is different from the super-real system defined by David Tall.

=== Dual numbers ===

In linear algebra, the dual numbers extend the reals by adjoining one infinitesimal, the new element ε with the property ε2 = 0 (that is, ε is nilpotent). Every dual number has the form &quot;z&quot; = &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;ε with &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; being uniquely determined real numbers.

One application of dual numbers is automatic differentiation. This application can be generalized to polynomials in n variables, using the Exterior algebra of an n-dimensional vector space.

=== Smooth infinitesimal analysis ===

Synthetic differential geometry or smooth infinitesimal analysis have roots in category theory. This approach departs from the classical logic used in conventional mathematics by denying the general applicability of the law of excluded middle – i.e., &quot;not&quot; (&quot;a&quot; ≠ &quot;b&quot;) does not have to mean &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot;. A &quot;nilsquare&quot; or &quot;nilpotent&quot; infinitesimal can then be defined. This is a number &quot;x&quot; where &quot;x&quot;2 = 0 is true, but &quot;x&quot; = 0 need not be true at the same time. Since the background logic is intuitionistic logic, it is not immediately clear how to classify this system with regard to classes 1, 2, and 3. Intuitionistic analogues of these classes would have to be developed first.

== Infinitesimal delta functions ==
Cauchy used an infinitesimal formula_6 to write down a unit impulse, infinitely tall and narrow Dirac-type delta function formula_7 satisfying formula_8 in a number of articles in 1827, see Laugwitz (1989). Cauchy defined an infinitesimal in 1821 (Cours d&#x27;Analyse) in terms of a sequence tending to zero. Namely, such a null sequence becomes an infinitesimal in Cauchy&#x27;s and Lazare Carnot&#x27;s terminology.

Modern set-theoretic approaches allow one to define infinitesimals via the ultrapower construction, where a null sequence becomes an infinitesimal in the sense of an equivalence class modulo a relation defined in terms of a suitable ultrafilter. The article by Yamashita (2007) contains bibliography on modern Dirac delta functions in the context of an infinitesimal-enriched continuum provided by the hyperreals.

== Logical properties ==
The method of constructing infinitesimals of the kind used in nonstandard analysis depends on the model and which collection of axioms are used. We consider here systems where infinitesimals can be shown to exist.

In 1936 Maltsev proved the compactness theorem. This theorem is fundamental for the existence of infinitesimals as it proves that it is possible to formalise them. A consequence of this theorem is that if there is a number system in which it is true that for any positive integer &quot;n&quot; there is a positive number &quot;x&quot; such that 0 &lt; &quot;x&quot; &lt; 1/&quot;n&quot;, then there exists an extension of that number system in which it is true that there exists a positive number &quot;x&quot; such that for any positive integer &quot;n&quot; we have 0 &lt; &quot;x&quot; &lt; 1/&quot;n&quot;. The possibility to switch &quot;for any&quot; and &quot;there exists&quot; is crucial. The first statement is true in the real numbers as given in ZFC set theory : for any positive integer &quot;n&quot; it is possible to find a real number between 1/&quot;n&quot; and zero, but this real number depends on &quot;n&quot;. Here, one chooses &quot;n&quot; first, then one finds the corresponding &quot;x&quot;. In the second expression, the statement says that there is an &quot;x&quot; (at least one), chosen first, which is between 0 and 1/&quot;n&quot; for any &quot;n&quot;. In this case &quot;x&quot; is infinitesimal. This is not true in the real numbers (R) given by ZFC. Nonetheless, the theorem proves that there is a model (a number system) in which this is true. The question is: what is this model? What are its properties? Is there only one such model?

There are in fact many ways to construct such a one-dimensional linearly ordered set of numbers, but fundamentally, there are two different approaches:

# Extend the number system so that it contains more numbers than the real numbers.
# Extend the axioms (or extend the language) so that the distinction between the infinitesimals and non-infinitesimals can be made in the real numbers themselves.

In 1960, Abraham Robinson provided an answer following the first approach. The extended set is called the hyperreals and contains numbers less in absolute value than any positive real number. The method may be considered relatively complex but it does prove that infinitesimals exist in the universe of ZFC set theory. The real numbers are called standard numbers and the new non-real hyperreals are called nonstandard.

In 1977 Edward Nelson provided an answer following the second approach. The extended axioms are IST, which stands either for Internal set theory or for the initials of the three extra axioms: Idealization, Standardization, Transfer. In this system, we consider that the language is extended in such a way that we can express facts about infinitesimals. The real numbers are either standard or nonstandard. An infinitesimal is a nonstandard real number that is less, in absolute value, than any positive standard real number.

In 2006 Karel Hrbacek developed an extension of Nelson&#x27;s approach in which the real numbers are stratified in (infinitely) many levels; i.e., in the coarsest level, there are no infinitesimals nor unlimited numbers. Infinitesimals are at a finer level and there are also infinitesimals with respect to this new level and so on.

== Infinitesimals in teaching ==
Calculus textbooks based on infinitesimals include the classic &quot;Calculus Made Easy&quot; by Silvanus P. Thompson (bearing the motto &quot;What one fool can do another can&quot;) and the German text &quot;Mathematik fur Mittlere Technische Fachschulen der Maschinenindustrie&quot; by R. Neuendorff. 

Pioneering works based on Abraham Robinson&#x27;s infinitesimals include texts by Stroyan (dating from 1972) and Howard Jerome Keisler (Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach). Students easily relate to the intuitive notion of an infinitesimal difference 1-&quot;0.999...&quot;, where &quot;0.999...&quot; differs from its standard meaning as the real number 1, and is reinterpreted as an infinite terminating extended decimal that is strictly less than 1.

Another elementary calculus text that uses the theory of infinitesimals as developed by Robinson is &quot;Infinitesimal Calculus&quot; by Henle and Kleinberg, originally published in 1979. The authors introduce the language of first-order logic, and demonstrate the construction of a first order model of the hyperreal numbers. The text provides an introduction to the basics of integral and differential calculus in one dimension, including sequences and series of functions. In an Appendix, they also treat the extension of their model to the &quot;hyperhyper&quot;reals, and demonstrate some applications for the extended model.

An elementary calculus text based on smooth infinitesimal analysis is Bell, John L. (2008). A Primer of Infinitesimal Analysis, 2nd Edition. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 9780521887182.

A more recent calculus text utilizing infinitesimals is Dawson, C. Bryan (2022), Calculus Set Free: Infinitesimals to the Rescue, Oxford University Press. ISBN 9780192895608.

== Functions tending to zero ==
In a related but somewhat different sense, which evolved from the original definition of &quot;infinitesimal&quot; as an infinitely small quantity, the term has also been used to refer to a function tending to zero. More precisely, Loomis and Sternberg&#x27;s &quot;Advanced Calculus&quot; defines the function class of infinitesimals, formula_9, as a subset of functions formula_10 between normed vector spaces by formula_11, as well as two related classes formula_12 (see Big-O notation) by formula_13, andformula_14.The set inclusions formula_15generally hold. That the inclusions are proper is demonstrated by the real-valued functions of a real variable formula_16, formula_17, and formula_18: formula_19 but formula_20 and formula_21.As an application of these definitions, a mapping formula_22 between normed vector spaces is defined to be differentiable at formula_23 if there is a formula_24 [i.e, a bounded linear map formula_25] such that formula_26in a neighborhood of formula_6. If such a map exists, it is unique; this map is called the &quot;differential&quot; and is denoted by formula_28, coinciding with the traditional notation for the classical (though logically flawed) notion of a differential as an infinitely small &quot;piece&quot; of &quot;F&quot;. This definition represents a generalization of the usual definition of differentiability for vector-valued functions of (open subsets of) Euclidean spaces.

== Array of random variables ==
Let formula_29 be a probability space and let formula_30. An array formula_31 of random variables is called infinitesimal if for every formula_32, we have:
:formula_33
The notion of infinitesimal array is essential in some central limit theorems and it is easily seen by monotonicity of the expectation operator that any array satisfying Lindeberg&#x27;s condition is infinitesimal, thus playing an important role in Lindeberg&#x27;s Central Limit Theorem (a generalization of the central limit theorem).

<doc id="160992" wikidata="Q1051366" url="?curid=160992" title="Catulli Carmina">
<text>(&quot;Songs of Catullus&quot;) is a cantata by Carl Orff dating from 1940–1943. He described it as &quot;ludi scaenici&quot; (scenic plays). The work mostly sets poems of the Latin poet Catullus to music, with some text by the composer. &quot;Catulli Carmina&quot; is part of &quot;Trionfi&quot;, the musical triptych that also includes the &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; and &quot;Trionfo di Afrodite&quot;. It is scored for a full mixed choir, soprano and tenor soloists, and an entirely percussive orchestra – possibly inspired by Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Les noces&quot; – consisting of four pianos, timpani, bass drum, 3 tambourines, triangle, castanets, maracas, suspended and crash cymbals, antique cymbal (without specified pitch), tam-tam, lithophone, metallophone, 2 glockenspiels, wood block, xylophone, and tenor xylophone/low xylophone.

==Dramatic structure==
The piece is divided into three parts: a prelude with Latin text by Orff, the central dramatic story using Catullus&#x27; poems, and a short postlude which recalls the music of the prelude.

In the prelude, groups of young women and young men sing to each other of eternal (&quot;eis aiona&quot; – &quot;forever&quot; – two words of Greek in the otherwise Latin text) love and devotion, along with quite explicit statements of the erotic activities they intend with each other. (In the texts distributed with programs and early recordings, such as the Turnabout (Vox) one, many lines in the translation are left blank.) A group of old men interrupts with sarcastic comments and charges the young people to listen to &quot;the songs of Catullus&quot;.

The story proper tells of Catullus, a lovesick young man who falls in love with Lesbia, a woman who does not remain faithful to him. The tenor and soprano soloists portray Catullus and Lesbia respectively. This story is based loosely on the factual relationship between Catullus and Clodia, with a text mostly constructed from the poems of Catullus, in which he did address Clodia by the pseudonym Lesbia. Catullus wrote many poems about this relationship and the ones selected for the cantata take the audience through its several phases.

In this listing, the poems are given the standard numbers. Subject to occasional textual variants, the poems are as written by Catullus, except for some interpolations in Latin (&#x27;O mea Lesbia&#x27; and the like, and exclamations of approval by the old men) and the curious extra words in poem 109.

===Act 1===
*&quot;Odi et amo&quot; (poem 85)
*&quot;Vivamus, mea Lesbia, atque amemus&quot; (poem 5)
*&quot;Ille mi par esse deo videtur&quot; (poem 51)
*&quot;Caeli! Lesbia nostra, Lesbia illa&quot; (poem 58)
*&quot;Nulli se dicit mulier mea nubere malle quam mihi&quot; (poem 70)

===Act 2===
*&quot;Jucundum mea vita&quot; (poem 109, with the apparently Italian words &quot;Dormi, dormi ancora&quot; interpolated)
*&quot;Desine de quoquam quicquam bene velle mereri&quot; (poem 73)

===Act 3===
*&quot;Odi et amo&quot; (poem 85)
*&quot;Amabo mea dulcis Ipsitilla&quot; (poem 32)
*&quot;Ameana, puella defututa&quot; (poem 41)
*&quot;Miser Catulle, desinas ineptire&quot; (poem 8)
*&quot;Nulla potest mulier tantum se dicere amatam&quot; (poem 87)
*&quot;Nunc est mens deducta tua mea, Lesbia, culpa&quot; (poem 75)

This selection and sequence of poems is apparently intended to tell the young people on stage that love will not last forever.

However, in the postlude, the young people have clearly decided to ignore the message and the cantata ends with their continued exclamations of &quot;eis aiona&quot; (meaning &quot;forever&quot;), to the exasperation of the old men.

==The music==
The orchestra only plays in the prelude and postlude, whereas in the Catullus play itself, the soloists are only accompanied by the chorus, which takes the part of a Greek chorus. The piece experiments with repeated phrases and syncopated rhythms even more so than &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;. Scholars have debated the reason why this is such a lesser-known work, compared to its predecessor. It has been suggested that, with the fall of Nazi Germany and the depressed feeling of Europe in the aftermath of World War II, for a long time it simply did not have the opportunity to be presented to any large audience.

<doc id="160993" wikidata="Q860609" url="?curid=160993" title="Generating function">
<text>In mathematics, a generating function is a representation of an infinite sequence of numbers as the coefficients of a formal power series. Generating functions are often expressed in closed form (rather than as a series), by some expression involving operations on the formal series. 

There are various types of generating functions, including ordinary generating functions, exponential generating functions, Lambert series, Bell series, and Dirichlet series. Every sequence in principle has a generating function of each type (except that Lambert and Dirichlet series require indices to start at 1 rather than 0), but the ease with which they can be handled may differ considerably. The particular generating function, if any, that is most useful in a given context will depend upon the nature of the sequence and the details of the problem being addressed.

Generating functions are sometimes called generating series, in that a series of terms can be said to be the generator of its sequence of term coefficients.

== History ==
Generating functions were first introduced by Abraham de Moivre in 1730, in order to solve the general linear recurrence problem.

George Pólya writes in &quot;Mathematics and plausible reasoning&quot;:
&quot;The name &quot;generating function&quot; is due to Laplace. Yet, without giving it a name, Euler used the device of generating functions long before Laplace [..]. He applied this mathematical tool to several problems in Combinatory Analysis and the Theory of Numbers.&quot;

==Definition==

===Convergence===
Unlike an ordinary series, the &quot;formal&quot; power series is not required to converge: in fact, the generating function is not actually regarded as a function, and the &quot;variable&quot; remains an indeterminate. One can generalize to formal power series in more than one indeterminate, to encode information about infinite multi-dimensional arrays of numbers. Thus generating functions are not functions in the formal sense of a mapping from a domain to a codomain. 

These expressions in terms of the indeterminate  may involve arithmetic operations, differentiation with respect to  and composition with (i.e., substitution into) other generating functions; since these operations are also defined for functions, the result looks like a function of . Indeed, the closed form expression can often be interpreted as a function that can be evaluated at (sufficiently small) concrete values of , and which has the formal series as its series expansion; this explains the designation &quot;generating functions&quot;. However such interpretation is not required to be possible, because formal series are not required to give a convergent series when a nonzero numeric value is substituted for . 

===Limitations===
Not all expressions that are meaningful as functions of  are meaningful as expressions designating formal series; for example, negative and fractional powers of  are examples of functions that do not have a corresponding formal power series.

==Types==

===Ordinary generating function (OGF)===

When the term &quot;generating function&quot; is used without qualification, it is usually taken to mean an ordinary generating function. The &quot;ordinary generating function&quot; of a sequence is:
formula_1
If is the probability mass function of a discrete random variable, then its ordinary generating function is called a probability-generating function.

===Exponential generating function (EGF)===

The &quot;exponential generating function&quot; of a sequence is
formula_2

Exponential generating functions are generally more convenient than ordinary generating functions for combinatorial enumeration problems that involve labelled objects.

Another benefit of exponential generating functions is that they are useful in transferring linear recurrence relations to the realm of differential equations. For example, take the Fibonacci sequence that satisfies the linear recurrence relation . The corresponding exponential generating function has the form
formula_3

and its derivatives can readily be shown to satisfy the differential equation as a direct analogue with the recurrence relation above. In this view, the factorial term is merely a counter-term to normalise the derivative operator acting on .

===Poisson generating function===
The &quot;Poisson generating function&quot; of a sequence is
formula_4

===Lambert series===
The &quot;Lambert series&quot; of a sequence is
formula_5Note that in a Lambert series the index starts at 1, not at 0, as the first term would otherwise be undefined. 

The Lambert series coefficients in the power series expansions
formula_6for integers are related by the divisor sum
formula_7The main article provides several more classical, or at least well-known examples related to special arithmetic functions in number theory. As an example of a Lambert series identity not given in the main article, we can show that for we have that formula_8

where we have the special case identity for the generating function of the divisor function, , given byformula_9

===Bell series===

The Bell series of a sequence is an expression in terms of both an indeterminate and a prime and is given by:
formula_10

===Dirichlet series generating functions (DGFs)===

Formal Dirichlet series are often classified as generating functions, although they are not strictly formal power series. The &quot;Dirichlet series generating function&quot; of a sequence is:
formula_11

The Dirichlet series generating function is especially useful when is a multiplicative function, in which case it has an Euler product expression in terms of the function&#x27;s Bell series:
formula_12

If is a Dirichlet character then its Dirichlet series generating function is called a Dirichlet -series. We also have a relation between the pair of coefficients in the Lambert series expansions above and their DGFs. Namely, we can prove that:
formula_13if and only if
formula_14where is the Riemann zeta function.

The sequence generated by a Dirichlet series generating function (DGF) corresponding to:formula_15has the ordinary generating function:formula_16

===Polynomial sequence generating functions===

The idea of generating functions can be extended to sequences of other objects. Thus, for example, polynomial sequences of binomial type are generated by:
formula_17where is a sequence of polynomials and is a function of a certain form. Sheffer sequences are generated in a similar way. See the main article generalized Appell polynomials for more information.

Examples of polynomial sequences generated by more complex generating functions include:

* Appell polynomials
* Chebyshev polynomials
* Difference polynomials
* Generalized Appell polynomials
* -difference polynomials

=== Other generating functions ===
Other sequences generated by more complex generating functions include:

* Double exponential generating functions. For example: Aitken&#x27;s Array: Triangle of Numbers
* Hadamard products of generating functions and diagonal generating functions, and their corresponding integral transformations

==== Convolution polynomials ====
Knuth&#x27;s article titled &quot;Convolution Polynomials&quot; defines a generalized class of &quot;convolution polynomial&quot; sequences by their special generating functions of the form
formula_18
for some analytic function with a power series expansion such that .

We say that a family of polynomials, , forms a &quot;convolution family&quot; if and if the following convolution condition holds for all , and for all :
formula_19

We see that for non-identically zero convolution families, this definition is equivalent to requiring that the sequence have an ordinary generating function of the first form given above.

A sequence of convolution polynomials defined in the notation above has the following properties:

* The sequence is of binomial type
* Special values of the sequence include and , and
* For arbitrary (fixed) formula_20, these polynomials satisfy convolution formulas of the form
formula_21

For a fixed non-zero parameter formula_22, we have modified generating functions for these convolution polynomial sequences given by
formula_23
where is implicitly defined by a functional equation of the form . Moreover, we can use matrix methods (as in the reference) to prove that given two convolution polynomial sequences, and , with respective corresponding generating functions, and , then for arbitrary we have the identity
formula_24

Examples of convolution polynomial sequences include the &quot;binomial power series&quot;, , so-termed &quot;tree polynomials&quot;, the Bell numbers, , the Laguerre polynomials, and the Stirling convolution polynomials.

== Ordinary generating functions ==

=== Examples for simple sequences ===

Polynomials are a special case of ordinary generating functions, corresponding to finite sequences, or equivalently sequences that vanish after a certain point. These are important in that many finite sequences can usefully be interpreted as generating functions, such as the Poincaré polynomial and others.

A fundamental generating function is that of the constant sequence , whose ordinary generating function is the geometric series
formula_25

The left-hand side is the Maclaurin series expansion of the right-hand side. Alternatively, the equality can be justified by multiplying the power series on the left by , and checking that the result is the constant power series 1 (in other words, that all coefficients except the one of are equal to 0). Moreover, there can be no other power series with this property. The left-hand side therefore designates the multiplicative inverse of in the ring of power series.

Expressions for the ordinary generating function of other sequences are easily derived from this one. For instance, the substitution gives the generating function for the geometric sequence for any constant :
formula_26

(The equality also follows directly from the fact that the left-hand side is the Maclaurin series expansion of the right-hand side.) In particular,
formula_27

One can also introduce regular gaps in the sequence by replacing by some power of , so for instance for the sequence (which skips over ) one gets the generating function
formula_28

By squaring the initial generating function, or by finding the derivative of both sides with respect to and making a change of running variable , one sees that the coefficients form the sequence , so one has
formula_29

and the third power has as coefficients the triangular numbers whose term is the binomial coefficient , so that
formula_30

More generally, for any non-negative integer and non-zero real value , it is true that
formula_31

Since
formula_32

one can find the ordinary generating function for the sequence of square numbers by linear combination of binomial-coefficient generating sequences:
formula_33

We may also expand alternately to generate this same sequence of squares as a sum of derivatives of the geometric series in the following form:
formula_34

By induction, we can similarly show for positive integers that
formula_35

where denote the Stirling numbers of the second kind and where the generating function
formula_36

so that we can form the analogous generating functions over the integral th powers generalizing the result in the square case above. In particular, since we can write
formula_37

we can apply a well-known finite sum identity involving the Stirling numbers to obtain that
formula_38

=== Rational functions ===
The ordinary generating function of a sequence can be expressed as a rational function (the ratio of two finite-degree polynomials) if and only if the sequence is a linear recursive sequence with constant coefficients; this generalizes the examples above. Conversely, every sequence generated by a fraction of polynomials satisfies a linear recurrence with constant coefficients; these coefficients are identical to the coefficients of the fraction denominator polynomial (so they can be directly read off). This observation shows it is easy to solve for generating functions of sequences defined by a linear finite difference equation with constant coefficients, and then hence, for explicit closed-form formulas for the coefficients of these generating functions. The prototypical example here is to derive Binet&#x27;s formula for the Fibonacci numbers via generating function techniques.

We also notice that the class of rational generating functions precisely corresponds to the generating functions that enumerate &quot;quasi-polynomial&quot; sequences of the form 
formula_39

where the reciprocal roots, formula_40, are fixed scalars and where is a polynomial in for all .

In general, Hadamard products of rational functions produce rational generating functions. Similarly, if
formula_41

is a bivariate rational generating function, then its corresponding &quot;diagonal generating function&quot;,
formula_42

is &quot;algebraic&quot;. For example, if we let
formula_43

then this generating function&#x27;s diagonal coefficient generating function is given by the well-known OGF formula
formula_44

This result is computed in many ways, including Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula or contour integration, taking complex residues, or by direct manipulations of formal power series in two variables.

=== Operations on generating functions ===

==== Multiplication yields convolution ====
Multiplication of ordinary generating functions yields a discrete convolution (the Cauchy product) of the sequences. For example, the sequence of cumulative sums (compare to the slightly more general Euler–Maclaurin formula)
formula_45
of a sequence with ordinary generating function has the generating function
formula_46
because is the ordinary generating function for the sequence . See also the section on convolutions in the applications section of this article below for further examples of problem solving with convolutions of generating functions and interpretations.

==== Shifting sequence indices ====

For integers , we have the following two analogous identities for the modified generating functions enumerating the shifted sequence variants of and , respectively:
formula_47

==== Differentiation and integration of generating functions ====

We have the following respective power series expansions for the first derivative of a generating function and its integral:
formula_48

The differentiation–multiplication operation of the second identity can be repeated times to multiply the sequence by , but that requires alternating between differentiation and multiplication. If instead doing differentiations in sequence, the effect is to multiply by the th falling factorial:
formula_49

Using the Stirling numbers of the second kind, that can be turned into another formula for multiplying by formula_50 as follows (see the main article on generating function transformations):
formula_51

A negative-order reversal of this sequence powers formula corresponding to the operation of repeated integration is defined by the zeta series transformation and its generalizations defined as a derivative-based transformation of generating functions, or alternately termwise by and performing an integral transformation on the sequence generating function. Related operations of performing fractional integration on a sequence generating function are discussed here.

==== Enumerating arithmetic progressions of sequences ====
In this section we give formulas for generating functions enumerating the sequence given an ordinary generating function , where , , and and are integers (see the main article on transformations). For , this is simply the familiar decomposition of a function into even and odd parts (i.e., even and odd powers):
formula_52

More generally, suppose that and that denotes the th primitive root of unity. Then, as an application of the discrete Fourier transform, we have the formula
formula_53

For integers , another useful formula providing somewhat &quot;reversed&quot; floored arithmetic progressions — effectively repeating each coefficient times — are generated by the identity
formula_54

===-recursive sequences and holonomic generating functions===

====Definitions====

A formal power series (or function) is said to be holonomic if it satisfies a linear differential equation of the form
formula_55

where the coefficients are in the field of rational functions, formula_56. Equivalently, formula_57 is holonomic if the vector space over formula_56 spanned by the set of all of its derivatives is finite dimensional.

Since we can clear denominators if need be in the previous equation, we may assume that the functions, are polynomials in . Thus we can see an equivalent condition that a generating function is holonomic if its coefficients satisfy a -recurrence of the form
formula_59

for all large enough and where the are fixed finite-degree polynomials in . In other words, the properties that a sequence be &quot;-recursive&quot; and have a holonomic generating function are equivalent. Holonomic functions are closed under the Hadamard product operation on generating functions.

====Examples====

The functions , , , , formula_60, the dilogarithm function , the generalized hypergeometric functions and the functions defined by the power series
formula_61

and the non-convergent
formula_62
are all holonomic.

Examples of -recursive sequences with holonomic generating functions include and , where sequences such as formula_63 and are &quot;not&quot; -recursive due to the nature of singularities in their corresponding generating functions. Similarly, functions with infinitely many singularities such as , , and  are &quot;not&quot; holonomic functions.

====Software for working with &quot;&quot;-recursive sequences and holonomic generating functions====

Tools for processing and working with -recursive sequences in &quot;Mathematica&quot; include the software packages provided for non-commercial use on the RISC Combinatorics Group algorithmic combinatorics software site. Despite being mostly closed-source, particularly powerful tools in this software suite are provided by the codice_1 package for guessing &quot;-recurrences&quot; for arbitrary input sequences (useful for experimental mathematics and exploration) and the codice_2 package which is able to find P-recurrences for many sums and solve for closed-form solutions to -recurrences involving generalized harmonic numbers. Other packages listed on this particular RISC site are targeted at working with holonomic &quot;generating functions&quot; specifically.
=== Relation to discrete-time Fourier transform ===
When the series converges absolutely,
formula_64
is the discrete-time Fourier transform of the sequence .

=== Asymptotic growth of a sequence ===
In calculus, often the growth rate of the coefficients of a power series can be used to deduce a radius of convergence for the power series. The reverse can also hold; often the radius of convergence for a generating function can be used to deduce the asymptotic growth of the underlying sequence.

For instance, if an ordinary generating function that has a finite radius of convergence of can be written as
formula_65

where each of and is a function that is analytic to a radius of convergence greater than (or is entire), and where then
formula_66
using the gamma function, a binomial coefficient, or a multiset coefficient. Note that limit as goes to infinity of the ratio of to any of these expressions is guaranteed to be 1; not merely that is proportional to them.

Often this approach can be iterated to generate several terms in an asymptotic series for . In particular,
formula_67

The asymptotic growth of the coefficients of this generating function can then be sought via the finding of , , , , and to describe the generating function, as above.

Similar asymptotic analysis is possible for exponential generating functions; with an exponential generating function, it is that grows according to these asymptotic formulae. Generally, if the generating function of one sequence minus the generating function of a second sequence has a radius of convergence that is larger than the radius of convergence of the individual generating functions then the two sequences have the same asymptotic growth.

==== Asymptotic growth of the sequence of squares ====
As derived above, the ordinary generating function for the sequence of squares is:
formula_68

With , , , , and , we can verify that the squares grow as expected, like the squares:
formula_69

==== Asymptotic growth of the Catalan numbers ====
The ordinary generating function for the Catalan numbers is
formula_70

With , , , , and , we can conclude that, for the Catalan numbers:
formula_71

=== Bivariate and multivariate generating functions ===
The generating function in several variables can be generalized to arrays with multiple indices. These non-polynomial double sum examples are called multivariate generating functions, or super generating functions. For two variables, these are often called bivariate generating functions.

==== Bivariate case ====
The ordinary generating function of a two-dimensional array (where and are natural numbers) is:
formula_72For instance, since is the ordinary generating function for binomial coefficients for a fixed , one may ask for a bivariate generating function that generates the binomial coefficients for all and . To do this, consider itself as a sequence in , and find the generating function in that has these sequence values as coefficients. Since the generating function for is:
formula_73the generating function for the binomial coefficients is:
formula_74Other examples of such include the following two-variable generating functions for the binomial coefficients, the Stirling numbers, and the Eulerian numbers, where and denote the two variables:
formula_75

==== Multivariate case ====
Multivariate generating functions arise in practice when calculating the number of contingency tables of non-negative integers with specified row and column totals. Suppose the table has rows and columns; the row sums are and the column sums are . Then, according to I. J. Good, the number of such tables is the coefficient of:
formula_76in:formula_77

=== Representation by continued fractions (Jacobi-type &quot;&quot;-fractions) ===

==== Definitions ====

Expansions of (formal) &quot;Jacobi-type&quot; and &quot;Stieltjes-type&quot; continued fractions (&quot;-fractions&quot; and &quot;-fractions&quot;, respectively) whose th rational convergents represent -order accurate power series are another way to express the typically divergent ordinary generating functions for many special one and two-variate sequences. The particular form of the Jacobi-type continued fractions (-fractions) are expanded as in the following equation and have the next corresponding power series expansions with respect to for some specific, application-dependent component sequences, and , where denotes the formal variable in the second power series expansion given below:
formula_78

The coefficients of formula_79, denoted in shorthand by , in the previous equations correspond to matrix solutions of the equations:
formula_80

where , for , if , and where for all integers , we have an &quot;addition formula&quot; relation given by:
formula_81

==== Properties of the &quot;&quot;th convergent functions ====

For (though in practice when ), we can define the rational th convergents to the infinite -fraction, , expanded by:
formula_82

component-wise through the sequences, and , defined recursively by:
formula_83

Moreover, the rationality of the convergent function for all implies additional finite difference equations and congruence properties satisfied by the sequence of , &quot;and&quot; for if then we have the congruence
formula_84

for non-symbolic, determinate choices of the parameter sequences and when , that is, when these sequences do not implicitly depend on an auxiliary parameter such as , , or as in the examples contained in the table below.

==== Examples ====

The next table provides examples of closed-form formulas for the component sequences found computationally (and subsequently proved correct in the cited references)
in several special cases of the prescribed sequences, , generated by the general expansions of the -fractions defined in the first subsection. Here we define and the parameters formula_85 and to be indeterminates with respect to these expansions, where the prescribed sequences enumerated by the expansions of these -fractions are defined in terms of the -Pochhammer symbol, Pochhammer symbol, and the binomial coefficients.

The radii of convergence of these series corresponding to the definition of the Jacobi-type -fractions given above are in general different from that of the corresponding power series expansions defining the ordinary generating functions of these sequences.

==Examples==
===Square numbers===
Generating functions for the sequence of square numbers are:

where is the Riemann zeta function.

==Applications==
Generating functions are used to:

* Find a closed formula for a sequence given in a recurrence relation, for example, Fibonacci numbers.
* Find recurrence relations for sequences—the form of a generating function may suggest a recurrence formula.
* Find relationships between sequences—if the generating functions of two sequences have a similar form, then the sequences themselves may be related.
* Explore the asymptotic behaviour of sequences.
* Prove identities involving sequences.
* Solve enumeration problems in combinatorics and encoding their solutions. Rook polynomials are an example of an application in combinatorics.
* Evaluate infinite sums.
===Various techniques: Evaluating sums and tackling other problems with generating functions===

====Example 1: Formula for sums of harmonic numbers====

Generating functions give us several methods to manipulate sums and to establish identities between sums.

The simplest case occurs when . We then know that for the corresponding ordinary generating functions.

For example, we can manipulate
formula_86
where are the harmonic numbers. Let
formula_87
be the ordinary generating function of the harmonic numbers. Then
formula_88
and thus
formula_89

Using
formula_90
convolution with the numerator yields
formula_91
which can also be written as
formula_92

====Example 2: Modified binomial coefficient sums and the binomial transform====

As another example of using generating functions to relate sequences and manipulate sums, for an arbitrary sequence we define the two sequences of sums
formula_93
for all , and seek to express the second sums in terms of the first. We suggest an approach by generating functions.

First, we use the binomial transform to write the generating function for the first sum as
formula_94

Since the generating function for the sequence is given by
formula_95
we may write the generating function for the second sum defined above in the form
formula_96

In particular, we may write this modified sum generating function in the form of
formula_97
for , , , and , where .

Finally, it follows that we may express the second sums through the first sums in the following form:
formula_98

====Example 3: Generating functions for mutually recursive sequences====

In this example, we reformulate a generating function example given in Section 7.3 of &quot;Concrete Mathematics&quot; (see also Section 7.1 of the same reference for pretty pictures of generating function series). In particular, suppose that we seek the total number of ways (denoted ) to tile a 3-by- rectangle with unmarked 2-by-1 domino pieces. Let the auxiliary sequence, , be defined as the number of ways to cover a 3-by- rectangle-minus-corner section of the full rectangle. We seek to use these definitions to give a closed form formula for without breaking down this definition further to handle the cases of vertical versus horizontal dominoes. Notice that the ordinary generating functions for our two sequences correspond to the series:
formula_99

If we consider the possible configurations that can be given starting from the left edge of the 3-by- rectangle, we are able to express the following mutually dependent, or &quot;mutually recursive&quot;, recurrence relations for our two sequences when defined as above where , , , and :
formula_100

Since we have that for all integers , the index-shifted generating functions satisfy{z^m}\.&lt;/math&gt;}}
formula_101
we can use the initial conditions specified above and the previous two recurrence relations to see that we have the next two equations relating the generating functions for these sequences given by
formula_102
which then implies by solving the system of equations (and this is the particular trick to our method here) that
formula_103

Thus by performing algebraic simplifications to the sequence resulting from the second partial fractions expansions of the generating function in the previous equation, we find that and that
formula_104
for all integers . We also note that the same shifted generating function technique applied to the second-order recurrence for the Fibonacci numbers is the prototypical example of using generating functions to solve recurrence relations in one variable already covered, or at least hinted at, in the subsection on rational functions given above.

===Convolution (Cauchy products)===

A discrete &quot;convolution&quot; of the terms in two formal power series turns a product of generating functions into a generating function enumerating a convolved sum of the original sequence terms (see Cauchy product).

#Consider and are ordinary generating functions. formula_105
#Consider and are exponential generating functions. formula_106
#Consider the triply convolved sequence resulting from the product of three ordinary generating functions formula_107
#Consider the -fold convolution of a sequence with itself for some positive integer (see the example below for an application) formula_108

Multiplication of generating functions, or convolution of their underlying sequences, can correspond to a notion of independent events in certain counting and probability scenarios. For example, if we adopt the notational convention that the probability generating function, or &quot;pgf&quot;, of a random variable is denoted by , then we can show that for any two random variables 
formula_109
if and are independent. Similarly, the number of ways to pay cents in coin denominations of values in the set {1, 5, 10, 25, 50} (i.e., in pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, and half dollars, respectively) is generated by the product
formula_110
and moreover, if we allow the cents to be paid in coins of any positive integer denomination, we arrive at the generating for the number of such combinations of change being generated by the partition function generating function expanded by the infinite -Pochhammer symbol product of
formula_111

====Example: Generating function for the Catalan numbers====

An example where convolutions of generating functions are useful allows us to solve for a specific closed-form function representing the ordinary generating function for the Catalan numbers, . In particular, this sequence has the combinatorial interpretation as being the number of ways to insert parentheses into the product so that the order of multiplication is completely specified. For example, which corresponds to the two expressions and . It follows that the sequence satisfies a recurrence relation given by
formula_112
and so has a corresponding convolved generating function, , satisfying
formula_113

Since , we then arrive at a formula for this generating function given by
formula_114

Note that the first equation implicitly defining above implies that
formula_115
which then leads to another &quot;simple&quot; (of form) continued fraction expansion of this generating function.

====Example: Spanning trees of fans and convolutions of convolutions====

A &quot;fan of order &quot; is defined to be a graph on the vertices with edges connected according to the following rules: Vertex 0 is connected by a single edge to each of the other vertices, and vertex formula_116 is connected by a single edge to the next vertex for all . There is one fan of order one, three fans of order two, eight fans of order three, and so on. A spanning tree is a subgraph of a graph which contains all of the original vertices and which contains enough edges to make this subgraph connected, but not so many edges that there is a cycle in the subgraph. We ask how many spanning trees of a fan of order are possible for each .

As an observation, we may approach the question by counting the number of ways to join adjacent sets of vertices. For example, when , we have that , which is a sum over the -fold convolutions of the sequence for . More generally, we may write a formula for this sequence as
formula_117
from which we see that the ordinary generating function for this sequence is given by the next sum of convolutions as
formula_118
from which we are able to extract an exact formula for the sequence by taking the partial fraction expansion of the last generating function.

===Implicit generating functions and the Lagrange inversion formula===
One often encounters generating functions specified by a functional equation, instead of an explicit specification. For example, the generating function for the number of binary trees on nodes (leaves included) satisfies

formula_119

The Lagrange inversion theorem is a tool used to explicitly evaluate solutions to such equations.

Applying the above theorem to our functional equation yields (with formula_120):

formula_121

Via the binomial theorem expansion, for even formula_122, the formula returns formula_123. This is expected as one can prove that the number of leaves of a binary tree are one more than the number of its internal nodes, so the total sum should always be an odd number. For odd formula_122, however, we get

formula_125

The expression becomes much neater if we let formula_122 be the number of internal nodes: Now the expression just becomes the formula_122th Catalan number.

===Introducing a free parameter (snake oil method)===
Sometimes the sum is complicated, and it is not always easy to evaluate. The &quot;Free Parameter&quot; method is another method (called &quot;snake oil&quot; by H. Wilf) to evaluate these sums.

Both methods discussed so far have as limit in the summation. When n does not appear explicitly in the summation, we may consider as a &quot;free&quot; parameter and treat as a coefficient of , change the order of the summations on and , and try to compute the inner sum.

For example, if we want to compute
formula_128
we can treat as a &quot;free&quot; parameter, and set
formula_129

Interchanging summation (&quot;snake oil&quot;) gives
formula_130

Now the inner sum is . Thus
formula_131

Then we obtain
formula_132

It is instructive to use the same method again for the sum, but this time take as the free parameter instead of . We thus set
formula_133

Interchanging summation (&quot;snake oil&quot;) gives
formula_134

Now the inner sum is . Thus
formula_135

Thus we obtain
formula_136
for as before.

===Generating functions prove congruences===
We say that two generating functions (power series) are congruent modulo , written if their coefficients are congruent modulo for all , i.e., for all relevant cases of the integers (note that we need not assume that is an integer here—it may very well be polynomial-valued in some indeterminate , for example). If the &quot;simpler&quot; right-hand-side generating function, , is a rational function of , then the form of this sequence suggests that the sequence is eventually periodic modulo fixed particular cases of integer-valued . For example, we can prove that the Euler numbers,
formula_137
satisfy the following congruence modulo 3:
formula_138

One useful method of obtaining congruences for sequences enumerated by special generating functions modulo any integers (i.e., not only prime powers ) is given in the section on continued fraction representations of (even non-convergent) ordinary generating functions by -fractions above. We cite one particular result related to generating series expanded through a representation by continued fraction from Lando&#x27;s &quot;Lectures on Generating Functions&quot; as follows:
}}&lt;/math&gt;
and that denotes the th convergent to this continued fraction expansion defined such that for all . Then:

# the function is rational for all where we assume that one of divisibility criteria of is met, that is, for some ; and 
# if the integer divides the product , then we have .

Generating functions also have other uses in proving congruences for their coefficients. We cite the next two specific examples deriving special case congruences for the Stirling numbers of the first kind and for the partition function which show the versatility of generating functions in tackling problems involving integer sequences.

====The Stirling numbers modulo small integers====

The main article on the Stirling numbers generated by the finite products
formula_139

provides an overview of the congruences for these numbers derived strictly from properties of their generating function as in Section 4.6 of Wilf&#x27;s stock reference &quot;Generatingfunctionology&quot;.
We repeat the basic argument and notice that when reduces modulo 2, these finite product generating functions each satisfy

formula_140

which implies that the parity of these Stirling numbers matches that of the binomial coefficient

formula_141

and consequently shows that is even whenever .

Similarly, we can reduce the right-hand-side products defining the Stirling number generating functions modulo 3 to obtain slightly more complicated expressions providing that
formula_142

====Congruences for the partition function====

In this example, we pull in some of the machinery of infinite products whose power series expansions generate the expansions of many special functions and enumerate partition functions. In particular, we recall that &quot;the&quot; partition function is generated by the reciprocal infinite -Pochhammer symbol product (or -Pochhammer product as the case may be) given by
formula_143

This partition function satisfies many known congruence properties, which notably include the following results though there are still many open questions about the forms of related integer congruences for the function:
formula_144

We show how to use generating functions and manipulations of congruences for formal power series to give a highly elementary proof of the first of these congruences listed above.

First, we observe that in the binomial coefficient generating function
formula_145
all of the coefficients are divisible by 5 except for those which correspond to the powers and moreover in those cases the remainder of the coefficient is 1 modulo 5. Thus, 
formula_146 
or equivalently
formula_147
It follows that
formula_148

Using the infinite product expansions of 
formula_149
it can be shown that the coefficient of in is divisible by 5 for all . Finally, since
formula_150
we may equate the coefficients of in the previous equations to prove our desired congruence result, namely that for all .

===Transformations of generating functions===
There are a number of transformations of generating functions that provide other applications (see the main article). A transformation of a sequence&#x27;s &quot;ordinary generating function&quot; (OGF) provides a method of converting the generating function for one sequence into a generating function enumerating another. These transformations typically involve integral formulas involving a sequence OGF (see integral transformations) or weighted sums over the higher-order derivatives of these functions (see derivative transformations).

Generating function transformations can come into play when we seek to express a generating function for the sums
formula_151

in the form of involving the original sequence generating function. For example, if the sums are
formula_152
then the generating function for the modified sum expressions is given by
formula_153
(see also the binomial transform and the Stirling transform).

There are also integral formulas for converting between a sequence&#x27;s OGF, , and its exponential generating function, or EGF, , and vice versa given by
formula_154

provided that these integrals converge for appropriate values of .

== Tables of special generating functions ==
An initial listing of special mathematical series is found here. A number of useful and special sequence generating functions are found in Section 5.4 and 7.4 of &quot;Concrete Mathematics&quot; and in Section 2.5 of Wilf&#x27;s &quot;Generatingfunctionology&quot;. Other special generating functions of note include the entries in the next table, which is by no means complete.

<text>NFL Europe League (simply called NFL Europe and known in its final season as NFL Europa) was a professional American football league that functioned as the developmental minor league of the National Football League (NFL). Originally founded in 1989 as the World League of American Football (or WLAF), the league was envisioned as a transatlantic league encompassing teams from both North America and Europe. Initially, the WLAF consisted of seven teams in North America and three in Europe. It began play in 1991 and lasted for two seasons before suspending operations; while the league had been &quot;wildly popular&quot; in Europe, it failed to achieve success in North America. After a two-year hiatus, it returned as a six-team European league, with teams based in England, Germany, the Netherlands, Scotland, and Spain. NFL Europa was dissolved in 2007 due to its continued unprofitability and the NFL&#x27;s decision to shift its focus towards hosting regular-season games in Europe; at the time of its closure, the league consisted of five German teams and one team based in the Netherlands.

The league operated under rules nearly identical to the NFL, but featured some differences and experimental rules changes designed to appeal to fans of association football (soccer) and rugby football. NFL teams were incentivized to allocate players through the granting of additional training camp positions for each allocated player, and each team in NFL Europe was required to employ a number of &quot;local&quot; players. Most of the league&#x27;s players were American, with &quot;local&quot; players tending to be converted rugby or soccer players playing at the punter or placekicker positions. Several NFL Europe alumni – including quarterbacks Brad Johnson, Kurt Warner, and Jake Delhomme – went on to have successful careers in the NFL, and three NFL Europe alumni (Adam Vinatieri, Dante Hall, and Brian Moorman) made the National Football League 2000s All-Decade Team.

The league&#x27;s schedule went through several formats throughout its existence, but each season always culminated in the championship World Bowl game. In its initial run, each team played a ten-game schedule, and the winners of each of the three divisions (Europe, North America East, and North America West), along with the team with the best record that didn&#x27;t win a division, would play in a four-team playoff. Following its revival as a six-team European league, the ten-game schedule was retained as double round-robin regular season. From 1995 to 1997, the World Bowl was played between the team with the best record in the first half of the season and the team with the best record in the second half of the season; from 1998 on, the two teams with the best records across the entire season played in the World Bowl. The Frankfurt Galaxy – the only team to play all 15 seasons of the league&#x27;s existence – won the most World Bowl titles (four) and recorded the most World Bowl appearances (eight), while the final league title was won by the Hamburg Sea Devils.

==History==
===Founding and origins===

In 1974, the National Football League (NFL) announced plans to launch a professional American football league in Europe, the Intercontinental Football League (IFL). Aiming for a launch in the spring of 1975, the IFL would feature six teams (located in Istanbul, Rome, Munich, West Berlin, Vienna, and Barcelona, respectively) and would be a satellite league of the NFL, with initial funds made by the NFL owners and the rosters consisting of &quot;second-line athletes and rookies from established NFL teams&quot;. The brainchild of Bob Kap, the proposed league had already sold six franchises and had secured the rights to loan players from the NFL. The league had also pre-selected four more cities for expansion teams, and Al Davis and Tex Schramm were assigned to head the committee that would put the league together. The IFL did not materialize – the Pro Football Researchers Association attributed this failure to Europe not being ready for American football, potential competition with the World Football League (WFL), a players&#x27; strike during the summer of 1974, and the recession. Another factor was the turmoil in Europe in 1974: Turkey had invaded Cyprus, the American ambassador to Cyprus had been assassinated, Basque separatists had assassinated the prime minister of Spain, and terrorist groups like the Red Brigades had engaged in kidnapping. The State Department discouraged NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle from pursuing the league, and the IFL also suffered a potentially fatal blow when Pan American World Airways, who Kap had brought on as a sponsor, pulled out of the project. Ultimately, Rozelle deemed the creation of the league &quot;impractical&quot;.

By 1980, the popularity of American football was increasing in Europe without any push by the NFL. The NFL capitalized on this newfound interest by holding American Bowl games (pre-season exhibition contests held overseas), and the popularity of these games, particularly in London, led to a renewed interest from Rozelle in creating an American football league in Europe. In 1989, the NFL announced plans to create an international spring football league. The NFL initially wanted the new league to be known as the International Football League, but it had to change the name after discovering that the name was already owned by Donald Trump and Charley Finley, who were allegedly in the process of forming their own league (which would never come to fruition). The name World League of American Football (WLAF) was eventually settled on; this name was chosen to avoid associating it with the dissolved World Football League, and the term &quot;American football&quot; was included in the league&#x27;s name because &quot;football&quot; in Europe typically refers to association football, known in the United States as soccer. The NFL and WLAF attempted to downplay its status as a minor league and refused to acknowledge the WLAF as a farm league of the NFL. The NFL approved the creation of the WLAF in July 1989, with Schramm to head up the project and the league expected to begin play in 1990 or 1991. The league was expected to have 12 teams (six in the United States, four in Europe, one in Canada and one in Mexico), and it secured a two-year television deal with ABC and a four-year television deal with USA Network to air regular and post-season games. Schramm was fired as league president in October 1990 due to differences between him and the NFL as to the direction the WLAF would take; Schramm had wanted the WLAF to be an &quot;independent, major international league which would be strong enough to stand on its own feet&quot;, while the NFL had wanted the WLAF to be a small league with close ties to the NFL.
On November 14, 1990, the WLAF announced it would begin play in 1991 with ten teams (six of them in the United States, three of them in Europe, and one in Canada) split into three divisions (North America West, North America East, and Europe). A 50-game schedule stretching from March 23, 1991, to May 27, 1991, was agreed upon, and a draft was held from February 14, 1991, to February 24, 1991. Unlike the NFL draft, the World League draft was a position-by-position draft – potential draftees were divided into ten position groups, meaning each of the ten teams would have the number-one pick at a position group. All players were to receive a base salary of $20,000, but players could receive more money by meeting performance-based incentives with a maximum total salary of $100,000. Each NFL team could allocate up to four players to the WLAF, although only two, the New Orleans Saints and Kansas City Chiefs opted to do so.

===WLAF/World League (1991–92)===

The World League of American Football, described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as the &quot;first trans-Atlantic major sports league&quot;, began play on March 23, 1991, with three games held in Frankfurt, Germany, Birmingham, Alabama, and Sacramento, California, respectively. After the conclusion of the regular season, the WLAF playoffs were held, featuring the three division champions (London Monarchs, New York/New Jersey Knights, and Birmingham Fire) and one wild-card team (Barcelona Dragons). London and Barcelona won their playoff games to meet in World Bowl &#x27;91 at Wembley Stadium, which London won 21–0.

Following its first season, the World League of American Football was at risk of folding. It suffered a loss of nearly $7 million, and none of its teams made a profit. In addition to the monetary loss for the league, television ratings on ABC and USA network were poor. According to Dan Rooney, the NFL chairman of the World League, cost estimates were accurate, but the league overestimated the amount of revenue the WLAF would make. The league&#x27;s television contracts were also at risk due to poor ratings, with USA Network having lost money. The WLAF averaged around 26,000 fans a game in its first season; the European teams had a higher attendance than the North American teams, bolstering the average. Ultimately, the NFL decided to bring the league back for a second season in 1992. The league name was shortened to World League by league officials, who felt the surprising success of the league in Europe made the &quot;American football&quot; part unnecessary, and the Raleigh-Durham Skyhawks folded, replaced by the Ohio Glory.

===NFL Europe/Europa (1995–2007)===
Although the league was &quot;wildly popular&quot; in Europe, with attendance averaging 45,000 for the London Monarchs, it was &quot;ignored&quot; in the United States. The World League suspended play for the 1993 and 1994 season before returning in 1995 as a six-team, exclusively European league. All three of the original European teams returned, along with the Birmingham Fire, who were rebooted as the Düsseldorf-based Rhein Fire, and two additional new teams (the Amsterdam Admirals and Scottish Claymores). Each team was required to have seven &quot;local&quot; players on their 40-man roster. Fox became a co-owner of the WLAF and a major financial contributor in return for broadcasting rights. The league was renamed the NFL Europe League (NFLEL) in 1998, and the London Monarchs were renamed the England Monarchs in an attempt to spur attendance, which had fallen below 10,000 per game. The Monarchs would fold the following season and were replaced by the Berlin Thunder.

NFL Europe commemorated its 10th season in 2002, but still remained far from being profitable. The league announced a three-year with the soccer club FC Barcelona to jointly promote American football in Europe and soccer in the United States; the Barcelona Dragons franchise was renamed FC Barcelona Dragons. The collaboration with FC Barcelona would prove to be unsuccessful, however, and the Barcelona Dragons would fold after the 2003 season due to declining attendance. The team&#x27;s attendance had fallen to under 7,000 per game, a 50% decline since the 1997 season, when the team had won the World Bowl. The Dragons were replaced by the Cologne Centurions in 2004, and the following year the Scottish Claymores folded; although the team boasted the largest following of any Scottish sports team outside the Old Firm, averaging 10,799 per game, the league had determined an additional German team could bring in 30,000 per game.

The Claymores were replaced the following year by the Hamburg Sea Devils, which left the Amsterdam Admirals as the only team in the league not to be based in Germany. This was part of a strategic pivot to Germany, which had been the most receptive country to the league and the sport in general. Accordingly, the league changed its name to NFL Europa in 2006, ahead of the league&#x27;s 15th season, to reflect the league&#x27;s focus on Germany and the Netherlands.

===Closure and legacy===

On July 29, 2007, less than a week after World Bowl XV, the NFL announced the closure of NFL Europa. The league had been losing a reported US$30 million a year, and the NFL had decided to shift their strategy in marketing football abroad towards holding NFL regular-season games outside the United States. The NFL owners who funded the league were reportedly dissatisfied with NFL Europa&#x27;s lack of revenue as well as its decreasing success in player development. The league had nearly folded in 2003, when eight of the 32 NFL owners voted against funding it, one short of the nine votes needed to end the league, and its gradual progression into a German-dominated league had run counter to the NFL&#x27;s goals of selling merchandise throughout the European continent. The league&#x27;s inability to garner a live television contract with local media markets also played a role in its demise, as the potential revenue from a deal could have helped the league financially.

Andrei S. Markovits and Lars Rensmann described the league as an &quot;abysmal failure&quot;, noting its poor quality of play, frequent name changes, and franchise relocations as well as the accessibility of regular NFL games in Europe as reasons for its collapse. Len Pasquarelli of ESPN.com noted that the league had strayed from its original goal, with the allocation system of players gradually being abused to amass training camp exemptions rather than to develop players. John Mara, the co-owner of the New York Giants, said that the league &quot;had some useful purpose in developing players&quot; and that it helped the NFL determine that there was an interest in American football in Europe.

Looking back on NFL Europe in 2017, Kevin Seifert of ESPN.com noted its strong record in developing quarterbacks: Kurt Warner (a Super Bowl champion and two-time MVP), Brad Johnson (who won a Super Bowl in 2002 with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers), Jake Delhomme (who led the Carolina Panthers to an NFC championship in 2003), and journeyman quarterback Jon Kitna all spent time in NFL Europe. Two NFL Europe alumni (kicker Adam Vinatieri and return specialist Dante Hall) were included on the NFL&#x27;s 2000s All-Decade Team. The league also provided an opportunity for the NFL to experiment with rules and to develop officials and coaches. Some NFL coaches and executives have suggested reviving the concept of a developmental league, and several independent leagues have been created to fill the need, but with little success. At a press conference before Super Bowl LI, league commissioner Roger Goodell said the NFL had been &quot;actively considering&quot; creating a new developmental league.

Since the closure of NFL Europa, the NFL has held regular-season games annually in London and has also hosted regular-season games in Mexico City and Toronto. The league is pursuing the goal of a franchise in London, as well as potential regular-season games in China. In 2021, the NFL announced it was looking for partners to host a regular-season game in Germany. In 2022, the league announced four regular-season games would be held in Germany, the first set for November 13, 2022 between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Seattle Seahawks to be played at Munich&#x27;s Allianz Arena. NFL.com writer Judy Battista noted Germany was the &quot;fastest-growing international community&quot; for the league, and attributed this in part to the popularity of the former NFL Europe&#x27;s German teams, but argued the large number of expats as well as the American military presence were greater factors.

In 2007, fans and former members of the Frankfurt Galaxy – the most successful of NFL Europe&#x27;s teams on the field and in crowd attendance – created the Frankfurt Universe. The new team was promoted to the German Football League 2 in 2011, and won promotion to the German Football League (GFL) in 2015. The European League of Football (ELF), a pan-European league that began play in 2021, signed an agreement with the NFL allowing them to utilize the branding of the former teams of NFL Europe. The ELF&#x27;s Barcelona Dragons, Berlin Thunder, Cologne Centurions, Hamburg Sea Devils, Frankfurt Galaxy, and Rhein Fire all share the names and imagery of their NFL Europe predecessors.

===Season structure and development===


This chart demonstrates the league&#x27;s table for the 2007 season. From 1998 to 2007, each team played 10 games (a home and away game against every other team in the league), and the top two teams at the end of the season (highlighted in green) qualified for the championship game, the World Bowl. The Hamburg Sea Devils won the game 37–28, securing the league&#x27;s championship.

From 1991 to 1992, the ten-team WLAF was split into three divisions: North America East, North America West, and Europe with a ten-game regular season schedule. All three division champions, in addition to the team with the best record who didn&#x27;t win its division, made the playoffs. The winners of the two playoff games played for the league championship in the World Bowl. The ten game schedule was retained upon the league&#x27;s return in 1995, but was modified with the new six-team format. Each team played every other team twice in a double round-robin regular season. Following the regular season, two teams would be selected for the World Bowl; the team that led the league&#x27;s standings after week five would host the game, and the team with the best overall record at the end of the season would be their opponent. This format was criticized for making the second half of the league&#x27;s season less competitive, and beginning with the 1998 season it was changed to have the two teams with the best overall records play in the World Bowl instead.

The league played under standard NFL rules, with several exceptions. In an effort to appeal to fans of rugby and soccer, the league instituted rules to speed up the pace of the game and awarded four points for field goals made from beyond 50 yards as opposed to the typical three points. Rule changes instituted upon the league&#x27;s revival in 1995 included the creation of the defensive two-point conversion, referred to by the league as the &quot;deuce&quot;, as well as only requiring receivers to have one foot in bounds on a completed pass. The regular-season overtime period consisted of a single 10-minute quarter where both teams were required to have control of the ball at least once, and the play clock was set to 35 seconds. Starting with the 1997 season, the league required the receiver to have two feet in bounds for a completed pass. Ties were possible in the league, with two (a 1992 game between the London Monarchs and Birmingham Fire and a 2006 game between the Berlin Thunder and Hamburg Sea Devils) occurring in league history.

NFL teams were allowed to allocate players to NFL Europe. In exchange for doing this, they were awarded with exemptions for training camp, allowing them to bring more players than would otherwise be allowed. A certain number of players on each team of NFL Europe were required to be &quot;local players&quot;, and at least two local players were required to be on the field at all times during games. Despite this, most of the league&#x27;s most prominent players were Americans; &quot;local players&quot; were often converted rugby or soccer players playing as punters or placekickers.

==Trophy and awards==
NFL Europe presented several awards and honors. The World Bowl trophy, awarded to the winners of the annual World Bowl game, was a 40-pound glass globe. The winning team also received championship rings Other awards included regular season most valuable player awards on offense and defense, a coach of the year award, and an award for the World Bowl MVP. The league also awarded offensive, defensive, special teams, and national players of the week, and named an all-league team at the end of the season.

==Television coverage==
===1991–92===
In the United States, television coverage was provided by the ABC and USA Network. The reported cost of the contracts varied. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, ABC committed to $28 million over two years, and USA Network committed to $25 million for the same length of time with an additional two-year option. Ratings were characterized as &quot;poor&quot; in the inaugural season, with ABC averaging a 2.1 rating and USA Network averaging a 1.2 rating. Television ratings in the United States were &quot;dismal&quot; during the league&#x27;s second season, with ABC averaging a 1.7 rating and USA Network averaging a 1.1 rating. As a result, ABC&#x27;s payment was reduced to $3 million while USA saw theirs lowered to $10 million. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, USA Network was &quot;not happy&quot; with this arrangement and did not heavily promote the league as a result.

International teams aired on different domestic networks. Montreal Machine games were aired in English on TSN and in French on RDS. Coverage in Europe was mostly on satellite television. Eurosport showed games on delay and Super Channel aired the 1991 World Bowl. In the United Kingdom, Channel 4 showed half-hour highlights of Monarchs games on Saturday mornings. Larry Eichel of &quot;the Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; wrote that &quot;The only way a Monarchs fan could watch the team&#x27;s first-round playoff game from the Meadowlands was to go to Wembley to see it on closed circuit.&quot;

===1995–2007===
The revived league&#x27;s United Kingdom television coverage was mainly on Sky Sports, with additional coverage also on Channel 4, STV, and Carlton. Eight European continental broadcasters also showed games, including Germany&#x27;s Vox and DSF.

Although the league no longer had any U.S. teams, it was covered on American television until its closure. Fox became a co-owner of the league in exchange for broadcasting rights, and following the relaunch all regular season games were broadcast on the FX network. Fox ended its joint ownership with the league in 2000, but continued to air some games as a television partner. In 2004, NFL Network began airing select NFL Europe games. This was expanded to cover all NFL Europe games – including the World Bowl – in 2006.

<text>In statistical hypothesis testing, a result has statistical significance when a result at least as &quot;extreme&quot; would be very infrequent if the null hypothesis were true. More precisely, a study&#x27;s defined significance level, denoted by formula_1, is the probability of the study rejecting the null hypothesis, given that the null hypothesis is true; and the &quot;p&quot;-value of a result, &quot;formula_2&quot;, is the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme, given that the null hypothesis is true. The result is statistically significant, by the standards of the study, when formula_3. The significance level for a study is chosen before data collection, and is typically set to 5% or much lower—depending on the field of study.

In any experiment or observation that involves drawing a sample from a population, there is always the possibility that an observed effect would have occurred due to sampling error alone. But if the &quot;p&quot;-value of an observed effect is less than (or equal to) the significance level, an investigator may conclude that the effect reflects the characteristics of the whole population, thereby rejecting the null hypothesis.

This technique for testing the statistical significance of results was developed in the early 20th century. The term &quot;significance&quot; does not imply importance here, and the term &quot;statistical significance&quot; is not the same as research significance, theoretical significance, or practical significance. For example, the term clinical significance refers to the practical importance of a treatment effect.

==History==

Statistical significance dates to the 18th century, in the work of John Arbuthnot and Pierre-Simon Laplace, who computed the &quot;p&quot;-value for the human sex ratio at birth, assuming a null hypothesis of equal probability of male and female births; see for details.

In 1925, Ronald Fisher advanced the idea of statistical hypothesis testing, which he called &quot;tests of significance&quot;, in his publication &quot;Statistical Methods for Research Workers&quot;. Fisher suggested a probability of one in twenty (0.05) as a convenient cutoff level to reject the null hypothesis. In a 1933 paper, Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson called this cutoff the &quot;significance level&quot;, which they named formula_1. They recommended that formula_1 be set ahead of time, prior to any data collection.

Despite his initial suggestion of 0.05 as a significance level, Fisher did not intend this cutoff value to be fixed. In his 1956 publication &quot;Statistical Methods and Scientific Inference,&quot; he recommended that significance levels be set according to specific circumstances.

===Related concepts===
The significance level formula_1 is the threshold for formula_2 below which the null hypothesis is rejected even though by assumption it were true, and something else is going on. This means that formula_1 is also the probability of mistakenly rejecting the null hypothesis, if the null hypothesis is true. This is also called false positive and type I error.

Sometimes researchers talk about the confidence level instead. This is the probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis given that it is true. Confidence levels and confidence intervals were introduced by Neyman in 1937.

==Role in statistical hypothesis testing==


Statistical significance plays a pivotal role in statistical hypothesis testing. It is used to determine whether the null hypothesis should be rejected or retained. The null hypothesis is the hypothesis that no effect exists in the phenomenon being studied. For the null hypothesis to be rejected, an observed result has to be statistically significant, i.e. the observed &quot;p&quot;-value is less than the pre-specified significance level formula_1.

To determine whether a result is statistically significant, a researcher calculates a &quot;p&quot;-value, which is the probability of observing an effect of the same magnitude or more extreme given that the null hypothesis is true. The null hypothesis is rejected if the &quot;p&quot;-value is less than (or equal to) a predetermined level, formula_1. formula_1 is also called the &quot;significance level&quot;, and is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given that it is true (a type I error). It is usually set at or below 5%.

For example, when formula_1 is set to 5%, the conditional probability of a type I error, &quot;given that the null hypothesis is true&quot;, is 5%, and a statistically significant result is one where the observed &quot;p&quot;-value is less than (or equal to) 5%. When drawing data from a sample, this means that the rejection region comprises 5% of the sampling distribution. These 5% can be allocated to one side of the sampling distribution, as in a one-tailed test, or partitioned to both sides of the distribution, as in a two-tailed test, with each tail (or rejection region) containing 2.5% of the distribution.

The use of a one-tailed test is dependent on whether the research question or alternative hypothesis specifies a direction such as whether a group of objects is &quot;heavier&quot; or the performance of students on an assessment is &quot;better&quot;. A two-tailed test may still be used but it will be less powerful than a one-tailed test, because the rejection region for a one-tailed test is concentrated on one end of the null distribution and is twice the size (5% vs. 2.5%) of each rejection region for a two-tailed test. As a result, the null hypothesis can be rejected with a less extreme result if a one-tailed test was used. The one-tailed test is only more powerful than a two-tailed test if the specified direction of the alternative hypothesis is correct. If it is wrong, however, then the one-tailed test has no power.

=== Significance thresholds in specific fields ===

In specific fields such as particle physics and manufacturing, statistical significance is often expressed in multiples of the standard deviation or sigma (&quot;σ&quot;) of a normal distribution, with significance thresholds set at a much stricter level (for example 5&quot;σ&quot;). For instance, the certainty of the Higgs boson particle&#x27;s existence was based on the 5&quot;σ&quot; criterion, which corresponds to a &quot;p&quot;-value of about 1 in 3.5 million.

In other fields of scientific research such as genome-wide association studies, significance levels as low as are not uncommon—as the number of tests performed is extremely large.

== Limitations ==

Researchers focusing solely on whether their results are statistically significant might report findings that are not substantive and not replicable. There is also a difference between statistical significance and practical significance. A study that is found to be statistically significant may not necessarily be practically significant.

=== Effect size ===
Effect size is a measure of a study&#x27;s practical significance. A statistically significant result may have a weak effect. To gauge the research significance of their result, researchers are encouraged to always report an effect size along with &quot;p&quot;-values. An effect size measure quantifies the strength of an effect, such as the distance between two means in units of standard deviation (cf. Cohen&#x27;s d), the correlation coefficient between two variables or its square, and other measures.

=== Reproducibility ===
A statistically significant result may not be easy to reproduce. In particular, some statistically significant results will in fact be false positives. Each failed attempt to reproduce a result increases the likelihood that the result was a false positive.

== Challenges ==
=== Overuse in some journals ===
Starting in the 2010s, some journals began questioning whether significance testing, and particularly using a threshold of =5%, was being relied on too heavily as the primary measure of validity of a hypothesis. Some journals encouraged authors to do more detailed analysis than just a statistical significance test. In social psychology, the journal &quot;Basic and Applied Social Psychology&quot; banned the use of significance testing altogether from papers it published, requiring authors to use other measures to evaluate hypotheses and impact.

Other editors, commenting on this ban have noted: &quot;Banning the reporting of &quot;p&quot;-values, as Basic and Applied Social Psychology recently did, is not going to solve the problem because it is merely treating a symptom of the problem. There is nothing wrong with hypothesis testing and &quot;p&quot;-values per se as long as authors, reviewers, and action editors use them correctly.&quot; Some statisticians prefer to use alternative measures of evidence, such as likelihood ratios or Bayes factors. Using Bayesian statistics can avoid confidence levels, but also requires making additional assumptions, and may not necessarily improve practice regarding statistical testing.

The widespread abuse of statistical significance represents an important topic of research in metascience.

=== Redefining significance ===
In 2016, the American Statistical Association (ASA) published a statement on &quot;p&quot;-values, saying that &quot;the widespread use of &#x27;statistical significance&#x27; (generally interpreted as &quot;&#x27;p&quot; ≤ 0.05&#x27;) as a license for making a claim of a scientific finding (or implied truth) leads to considerable distortion of the scientific process&quot;. In 2017, a group of 72 authors proposed to enhance reproducibility by changing the &quot;p&quot;-value threshold for statistical significance from 0.05 to 0.005. Other researchers responded that imposing a more stringent significance threshold would aggravate problems such as data dredging; alternative propositions are thus to select and justify flexible &quot;p&quot;-value thresholds before collecting data, or to interpret &quot;p&quot;-values as continuous indices, thereby discarding thresholds and statistical significance. Additionally, the change to 0.005 would increase the likelihood of false negatives, whereby the effect being studied is real, but the test fails to show it.

In 2019, over 800 statisticians and scientists signed a message calling for the abandonment of the term &quot;statistical significance&quot; in science, and the ASA published a further official statement declaring (page 2):

<doc id="160996" wikidata="Q2935213" url="?curid=160996" title="Camp Fire (organization)">
<text>Camp Fire, formerly Camp Fire USA and originally Camp Fire Girls of America, is a co-ed youth development organization. Camp Fire was the first nonsectarian, multicultural organization for girls in America. It is now gender-inclusive, and its programs emphasize camping and other outdoor activities.

Its informal roots extend back to 1910, with efforts by Mrs. Charles Farnsworth in Thetford, Vermont and Luther Gulick, M.D., and his wife, Charlotte Vedder Gulick, on Sebago Lake, near South Casco, Maine. Camp Fire Girls, as it was known at the time, was created as the sister organization to the Boy Scouts of America. The organization changed its name in 1975 to Camp Fire Boys and Girls when membership eligibility was expanded to include boys. In 2001, the name Camp Fire USA was adopted, and in 2012 it became Camp Fire.

Camp Fire&#x27;s programs include small group experiences, after-school programs, camping, as well as environmental education, child care, and service-learning; They aim to build confidence in younger children and provide hands-on, youth-driven leadership experiences for older youth.

==History==
In 1910, young girls in Thetford, Vermont watched their brothers, friends, and schoolmates—all Boy Scouts—practice their parts in the community&#x27;s 150th anniversary, which would be celebrated the following summer. The pageant&#x27;s organizer, William Chauncey Langdon, promised the girls that they too would have an organized role in the pageant, although no organization similar to the Boy Scouts existed for girls at the time.
Langdon consulted with Mrs. Charles Farnsworth [Charlotte Joy (Allen) Farnsworth, known as &quot;Madama&quot; ], preceptress of Horace Mann School near Thetford, Vermont. Both approached Luther Halsey Gulick M.D. about creating a national organization for girls. Gulick introduced the idea to friends, among them G. Stanley Hall, Ernest Thompson Seton, and James West, executive secretary of the Boy Scouts. After many discussions and help from Gulick and his wife Charlotte, Langdon named the group of Thetford girls the Camp Fire Girls.

In 1907, the Gulicks had established Camp WoHeLo, a camp for girls, on Lake Sebago, near South Casco, Maine. There were seventeen girls at the camp in the summer of 1910. Both the Vermont group and the Maine group would lead to the creation of the organization formally called Camp Fire Girls in 1912.

On March 22, 1911, Dr. Gulick organized a meeting &quot;to consider ways and means of doing for the girls what the Boy Scout movement is designed to do for the boys.&quot; On April 10, 1911 James E. West issued a press release from the Boy Scouts of America headquarters announcing that with the success of the Boy Scout movement, a group of preeminent New York men and women were organizing a group to provide outdoor activities for girls, similar to those in the Boy Scouts.

In 1911, the Camp Fire Girls planned to merge with the Girl Scouts of America, formed by Clara A. Lisetor-Lane of Des Moines, Iowa, and Girl Guides of America (of Spokane, Washington) to form the Girl Pioneers of America, but relationships fractured and the merger failed. Grace Seton quit the group over the rejection of her committee&#x27;s draft of a handbook, followed by Linda Beard in September 1911 over differences with the Gulicks. However, there was an organization meeting held by Lina Beard on February 7, 1912 in Flushing, New York of a Girl Pioneers of America organization.

Camp Fire Girls of America was incorporated in Washington, D.C, as a national agency on March 17, 1912.

In late 1912, Juliette Gordon Low proposed that the Camp Fire Girls merge with her group, Girl Guides of America, but was rejected in January 1913 as the Camp Fire Girls were then the larger group. By December 1913, Camp Fire Girls&#x27; membership was an estimated 60,000, many of whom began attending affiliated summer camps. The Bluebird program was introduced that year for younger girls, offering an exploration of ideas and creative play built around family and community. In 1989, the Bluebirds became Starflight.

The first official Camp Fire Girls handbook was published in 1913. During World War I, Camp Fire Girls helped to sell over one million dollars in Liberty Bonds and over $900,000 in Thrift Stamps; 55,000 girls helped to support French and Belgian orphans, and an estimated 68,000 girls earned honors by conserving food.

The first local Camp Fire Girls council was formed in 1918 in Kansas City, Missouri. Kansas City would later become the national headquarters for Camp Fire in 1977.

In 1926, Parker Brothers produced a Camp Fire Girls board game. There were no turns in the game; everyone played at the same time. The game ended when someone entered the &quot;Log Cabin Council Fire&quot;, which could only occur on an exact count. The winner of the game was the person who had collected the most &quot;Honor Beads&quot; on the way around the board (not necessarily the person who ended the game).


Camp Fire Girls celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1960 with the &quot;She Cares ... Do You?&quot; program. During the project, Camp Fire Girls planted more than two million trees, built 13,000 birdhouses, and completed several other conservation-oriented tasks. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Camp Fire Girls, in connection with their Golden Jubilee Convention celebration, a stamp designed by H. Edward Oliver was issued featuring the Camp Fire Girls insignia. A new program, Junior Hi, where twelve- and thirteen-year-old girls explored new interests as a group and as individuals, was created in 1962. This program name changed later to Discovery. That same year, the WoHeLo medallion became Camp Fire&#x27;s highest achievement and honor.

In 1969, Camp Fire Girls were allowed to be &quot;Participants&quot; in BSA&#x27;s Explorer Posts (for boys 14 and older). This arrangement ended in 1971, when the BSA made Explorers a co-ed program. By 1974, Camp Fire&#x27;s membership was at 274,000 in 1,300 communities of the United States. Camp Fire Girls expanded its horizons in 1975, welcoming boys to participate in all Camp Fire activities. While boys were invited to Camp Fire Girls Horizon Conferences in the late 1960s and early 1970s, official membership was not offered to them until 1975, when the organization became co-ed. Camp Fire decided that boys and girls should be together in one organization, so that they learn to play and work alongside each other and appreciate their similarities and differences in positive ways.

===Camp Fire===
In 1975, the Camp Fire Girls of America changed its membership policy to being co-ed and its name to Camp Fire Boys and Girls. In 1977, Camp Fire&#x27;s head office moved to its current location in Kansas City from New York. Teens in Action was introduced in 1988 as a one-time social issue campaign to energize the older teen program.

The first &quot;Absolutely Incredible Kid Day&quot;, a call to action for all adults to communicate their love and commitment to children through letters, took place in 1997. In 2003, to further its commitment to inclusiveness, Camp Fire USA began translating its curricula to Spanish. As a way to excite and educate children in Pre-K, the &quot;Little Stars&quot; program, first developed by Camp Fire Green Country, was introduced nationally in 2005. Designated for ages 3–5, &quot;Little Stars&quot; aims to builds confidence and a sense of belonging in children.

In 2012, Camp Fire underwent a re-branding, changing the traditional flame logo changed to a more contemporary &quot;Spark Mark.&quot;

==Programs==
Camp Fire has nationally developed youth development programs that are delivered through local and statewide councils and community partners across the nation. Programs are specific to community needs and some may not be available in all communities. The five outcome-based program areas include: Small-Group Clubs and Mentoring Opportunities; Leadership Development; Camping and Environmental Education; Child Care; and Self-Reliance and Service–Learning Classes.

===Small-group clubs===
In Small-Group Clubs and Mentoring Opportunities, boys and girls usually meet once a week for an hour, learning to work and play together through service projects. Camp Fire has numerous youth-development programs that are delivered through local and statewide councils and community partners.

The program levels are:
* Little Stars is for children ages three through five, and provides parents and preschool youth with a program-driven playgroup that gives them the opportunity to learn, grow and play.
* Starflight is for boys and girls in kindergarten through second grade. The children meet regularly in adult-supervised clubs. Meeting activities focus on the outdoors, creativity, service, acquiring new skills, learning more about themselves, and getting along with others.
*Adventure is for boys and girls in third through fifth grade. Adventure members earn Action Crafts beads for the new things they do and the good habits they learn. At this level, youth begin to accept more responsibility for choosing and planning their club activities.
* Discovery is for sixth through eighth grades, giving young people an opportunity to explore new interesting fields. Club members do much of their own planning and decision making, with the adult leader functioning more as an advisor than a supervisor. This is when Camp Fire youth are eligible to make and wear ceremonial attire, often gowns or tunics, worn only at Camp Fire ceremonials.
* Horizon is for high school-age youth in grades nine through twelve. Members participate in self-guided programs geared toward preparing them for adult responsibilities and community service. Members may earn the WoHeLo Award.

===Awards===
Official national recognition items are one of Camp Fire&#x27;s defining features, aimed to help children and adults build self-esteem and have pride in their accomplishments. For their participation, growth and achievements, youth receive items such as beads, emblems, pins, and certificates. At the early levels, Camp Fire leaders help youth choose activities and guide them in earning the recognition items. As teens, members select their own activities and develop their own action plans for earning recognition items. 

For adults, recognition items signify outstanding achievement or the number of years they have been adult Camp Fire USA members. Adults in programming or board positions are recognized on the local level for their important roles in Camp Fire.

====Beads====
Youth are able to earn beads while completing projects on the “Camp Fire Trails&quot; as well as emblems. Previously, once the participants earned ten of one type of bead, they were awarded a larger one of the same type to represent the ten smaller ones. By 2006, there was one bead for each of the Camp Fire Trails.

Bead colors
* Red – Sports, Games &amp; Science – Trail to the Future
* Brown – Outdoors &amp; Environment – Trail to Environment
* Green – Creativity – Trail to Creativity
* Yellow – Business &amp; Home – Trail to Family and Community
* Royal Blue – (formerly Citizenship, discontinued in 2003)
* Red, White &amp; Blue – (formerly Citizenship, replaced with Royal Blue in 2003) 
* Orange – (formerly Home Craft, discontinued in 2003)
* Turquoise – (formerly Science – Trail to Knowing Me, discontinued in 2003)
* Lime Green – Discovery level
* Purple – (small beads) Special Projects

====WoHeLo Award====
Established in 1962, the WoHeLo Award is a medallion named for Camp Fire&#x27;s watchword &quot;WoHeLo&quot;. WoHeLo is derived from the words &quot;work&quot;, &quot;health&quot;, and &quot;love&quot;. Each year, approximately 200 Camp Fire youth throughout the nation receive the WoHeLo Award. A member may apply for the award after completing four major long-term projects called Reflections, and three self-selected projects, called Advocacies, dealing with an area of concern of the youth member&#x27;s choosing. The first must be to Camp Fire; the second cannot be to Camp Fire; and the third can either be in Camp Fire or outside of Camp Fire. Each of the three Advocacies must involve leading, teaching, serving, and speaking out. Many councils have removed the requirement that Advocacies must be completed to the Camp Fire program, citing that opportunities do not always exist for members enrolled in all areas of the country. The third requirement for a Camp Fire WoHeLo Award is to &quot;know Camp Fire&quot;. Youth are required to read the History of Camp Fire, tour the office of their council, or follow another approved method of understanding the services Camp Fire provides.

In 2004, the WoHeLo Award was expanded to Teens in Action members, allowing all high-school-aged Camp Fire members to work toward the award.

===Service-Learning===
Service Learning has always been a large part of the Camp Fire curriculum. In 2008–2009, Camp Fire councils engaged a total of 2,864 older youth in service learning projects, totaling over 108,852 hours of work with 116 community partners. Working with Learn and Serve America, 27 Camp Fire councils were able to get 1,731 teens to help over 70,300 youth and family members from low-income housing understand emergency preparedness. The &quot;Gift of Giving&quot; program, for grades K–8, is the nation&#x27;s only organized and measurable introduction to service-learning. To date, over 100,000 children have participated in this program.

====Teens in Action====
The Teens in Action program is built on Camp Fire&#x27;s tradition of recognizing youth as part of the solution to today&#x27;s social challenges. Working together with young people, Teens in Action strives to improve the communities where youth live, to challenge them to learn new skills and provide leadership in areas never thought possible. Programs of this nature aim to inspire and honor community responsibility, contribute to the future of American volunteerism, and encourage a sense of caring for others.

The principles of Teens in Action are based on youth–adult partnerships and learning through empowering experiences. Its intent is to build strong ties between teens and their families, schools and communities, and to put a spotlight on issues of concern to youth. This program is based on the idea that young people are the key to the future and are making a difference in the world.

===Hold on to Health===
Hold on to Health is a Camp Fire program that helps to teach children to make healthy decisions regarding exercise and eating. It also encourages children to get their families and other youth involved in becoming healthy.

===Camp and environmental education===
Since Camp Fire&#x27;s inception, it has been about getting girls out in the wilderness to learn. The Gulick family had formed Camp WoHeLo before they had the idea to start the Camp Fire Organization.

Camp Fire is the largest coeducational nonsectarian camp provider, operating more than 110 environmental and camp programs throughout the United States, and annually serving more than 34,000 school-age youth. Its outdoor experiences help children work in groups, make friends and build self-esteem, while learning about ecology, conservation and the interrelationships of all living things. The Camp Fire camping and environmental education experience teaches youth to work in teams and make friends, while building self-esteem and good decision making skills. 

A common Camp Fire approach is to let the youth decide on their activities, allowing them to feel a sense of ownership with their camp schedule and helping them to become more proactive. It is Camp Fire&#x27;s belief that any program activity that the group does together is not as important or lasting as the effects of being with a group of peers and a supportive adult in an environment where they are able to share their feelings and learn from experience.

&quot;The organization shall endeavor to aid in the formation of habits making for health and vigor, the out-of-door habit, and the out-of-door spirit.&quot; Luther Gulick

====Counselor in Training program====
The Counselor in Training (CIT) program is available to all youth over 16 years of age who have an interest in becoming a counselor. The CIT program provides youth with leadership skills, self-confidence, decision-making skills and camping basics. Camp Fire&#x27;s CIT program and manual are frequently used by not only Camp Fire but also other organizations, and is approved by the American Camping Association.

===Community Family Club===
Community Family Club is a program designed by Camp Fire to provide developmental programs for the whole family. The goal is to include at least one adult family member or a supporting adult from the community with every child who attends. Siblings of all ages, infants through teens, are included. Community Family Clubs also provide opportunities to create strong partnerships with corporations, schools, faith-based communities, child care settings and other community organizations to advance the needs of children, youth, and families across the country. Families come together once a month to share a meal and participate in a recognition ceremony designed to recognize both individual and group accomplishments. The club then breaks into age-level groups for an activity session led by a team of parents who volunteer for the short-term assignment for that month. This program offers parents and guardians the ability to find a community support group for raising their families, and also provides positive family interaction base on structured, educational and fun experiences and activities.

===Absolutely Incredible Kid Day===
Started in 1997, Absolutely Incredible Kid Day (AIKD) is a national annual campaign in which adults write letters of love and support to the young people in their lives. This event is held the third Thursday of March, to correspond to the founding date of Camp Fire.

In previous years, Absolutely Incredible Kid Day developed a following, including athletes, entertainers, and celebrities who have championed the cause by writing letters to America&#x27;s youth, including former presidents Bill Clinton George W. Bush, Oprah Winfrey, Pro Football Hall of Fame Inductee Jerry Rice, and astronaut and former Senator John Glenn. On social media, Absolutely Incredible Kid Day uses the hashtags #KidDay and #AIKD.

===Past programs===
====Bluebirds, Blue Jays, Sparks====
Many names have been used within Camp Fire to identify different age groups. For many years, Camp Fire&#x27;s youngest elementary school members were known as Bluebirds.

In 1983, a club program for kindergarteners was introduced, called Sparks. In 1989, these two age groups were combined, and a new program level for kindergarten, first, and second graders called Starflight was created. The Little Stars program for pre-schoolers was added in 2005. The tradition of Bluebirds has been preserved as a Camp Fire mascot for all ages.

==Native American influence==
Native American culture influenced the early years of Camp Fire, serving as the inspiration for ceremonial activities and attire, camp and council names, respect for nature and the environment, and the use of symbols by many councils. For Camp Fire, Native American symbolism was a natural outgrowth of an appreciation for differences and cultural inclusiveness. The theory was that such symbolism enabled—and even encouraged—self-reflection and personal growth.

===Names===
All Camp Fire members between third and sixth grade are encouraged to choose a name that best reflects their personality and aspirations. At this time they are also encouraged to choose a symbol or &quot;symbolgram&quot;. Clubs are encouraged to choose a Native American name.

===Ceremonial attire===
Originally, the Camp Fire ceremonial gown was based on Native American women&#x27;s gowns, and was made optional in 1946. Today, a member may choose any style of ceremonial attire, particularly if it honors their ethnic background, such as tunics, kimonos, and Scandinavian skirts/aprons. The ceremonial attire is decorated with honor beads, earned emblems, and other personal items the member chooses. Sometimes the youth&#x27;s symbolgram, a symbol created by the youth to represent themself, is used on the ceremonial attire.

==In fiction and popular culture==
Throughout the years, Camp Fire has appeared in many novels written for youth. Irene Ellion Benson wrote one of the first books to incorporate Camp Fire, called &quot;How Ethel Hollister Became a Campfire Girl&quot;, published in 1912. Benson published six more books about Camp Fire between 1912 and 1918. In 1913, Margaret Vandercook started the &quot;Camp Fire Girls&quot; series, which portrayed many of Camp Fire&#x27;s activities, rituals, and ceremonies, including their summer camps. In the 1980s, Camp Fire was featured in the Carolyn Keene and Franklin Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys&quot; &quot;Camp Fire Stories&quot;. Laura Lee Hope also featured Camp Fire in a Bobbsey Twins. In 1991, Archie Comics published a special Archie comic in celebration of Camp Fire&#x27;s 75th anniversary with the Riverdale gang working as counselors there. British writers have also used Camp Fire and their rituals in British children&#x27;s fiction—author Elsie J. Oxenham often mentioned Camp Fire in her Abbey Series. In 1915, Angela Brazil incorporated the Camp Fire League into one of her fictional girls&#x27; boarding schools, &quot;For the Sake of the School&quot;.

<doc id="161000" wikidata="Q728968" url="?curid=161000" title="Henry Barrowe">
<text>Henry Barrow (or Barrowe) ( – 6 April 1593) was an English Separatist Puritan, or Brownist, who was executed for his views. He led the London underground church from 1587 to 1593; spent most of that time in prison; and wrote numerous works of Brownist apologetics, most notably &quot;A Brief Discoverie of the False Church&quot;.

==Life==
Barrow was born about 1550, in Norfolk, of a family related by marriage to Nicholas Bacon, and probably to John Aylmer, Bishop of London. He matriculated at Clare College, Cambridge (then called Clare Hall), in November 1566, and graduated B.A. in 1569–1570. Afterwards he &quot;followed the court&quot; for some time, leading a frivolous if not licentious life. According to John Cotton, Barrow gambled a lot and would boast of spending his winnings ‘in the bosoms of his courtesans’. He was a member of Gray&#x27;s Inn for a few years from 1576, but was never called to the bar.

Early in 1586, Barrow was converted to puritanism by a sermon in a church he had been walking past. Eighteen months later he attempted to write a rebuttal of one of Robert Browne&#x27;s separatist works, but instead was converted by it. Subsequently, he came into close relations with John Greenwood, the Separatist leader. He became associated with the London underground church, the illegal Brownist congregation that had been meetings secretly since the late 1560s.

Greenwood was imprisoned in The Clink, and when Barrow visited him on 19 November 1587 he was detained by the gaoler and brought before Archbishop John Whitgift. He insisted on the illegality of this arrest, refused either to take the &quot;ex officio&quot; oath or to give bail for future appearance, and was committed to the Gatehouse Prison. After nearly six months&#x27; detention and several irregular examinations before the high commissioners, he and Greenwood were formally indicted at the Newgate Sessions in May 1588 under the 1581 Recusancy Act (originally directed against Roman Catholics). They were fined £260, then moved to the Fleet prison.

Barrow was subjected to several more examinations, once before the Privy Council at Whitehall on 18 March 1589, as a result of petition to the Queen. On these occasions he maintained the principle of separatism, denouncing the prescribed ritual of the Church as &quot;a false worship,&quot; and the bishops as oppressors and persecutors.

During his imprisonments Barrow was engaged in written controversy with Robert Browne (down to 1588), who had yielded a partial submission to the established order, and whom he therefore counted as a renegade. He also wrote several treatises in defence of separatism and congregational independency, including:

*&quot;A True Description of the Visible Congregation of the Saints&quot;, &amp;c. (1589)
*&quot;A Plain Refutation of Mr Gifford’s Booke, intituled A Short Treatise Gainst the Donatistes of England&quot; (1590–1591)
*&quot;A Brief Discovery of the False Church&quot; (1590).

Others were written in conjunction with his fellow-prisoner, Greenwood. These writings were entrusted to friends and sent to the Netherlands for publication.

By 1590 the bishops had sent several conforming Puritan ministers to confer with these controversialists, but without effect. In 1592 Greenwood, Barrow and John Penry gained a temporary reprieve and began meeting at a house in the Borough and formally constituted the Southwark Independent Church.

Barrow and Greenwood were returned to the Clink in 1593. It was resolved to proceed on a capital charge of &quot;devising and circulating seditious books&quot;. As the law then stood, it was easy to secure a conviction. They were tried and sentenced to death on 23 March 1593. The day after the sentence, they were brought out as if for execution and respited. On 31 March they were taken to the gallows, and after the ropes had been placed about their necks, they were again respited. Finally, they were hanged early on the morning of 6 April. There is some evidence that Lord Treasurer Burghley endeavoured to save their lives and was frustrated by Whitgift and other bishops.

==Views==

The opinions of Browne and Barrow had much in common, but were not identical. Both maintained the right and duty of the Church to carry out necessary reforms without awaiting the permission of the civil power; and both advocated congregational independency. But the ideal of Browne was a spiritual democracy, towards which separation was only a means. Barrow, on the other hand, regarded the whole established church order as polluted by the relics of Roman Catholicism, and insisted on separation as essential to pure worship and discipline. Barrowe also differed from Robert Browne regarding church governance, preferring placing it in the hands of elders rather than the entire congregation, as he distrusted too much democracy.

Barrow has been credited by H. M. Dexter and others with being the author of the Marprelate Tracts; but this is not generally accepted.

<text>Pareto interpolation is a method of estimating the median and other properties of a population that follows a Pareto distribution. It is used in economics when analysing the distribution of incomes in a population, when one must base estimates on a relatively small random sample taken from the population.

The family of Pareto distributions is parameterized by

* a positive number κ that is the smallest value that a random variable with a Pareto distribution can take. As applied to distribution of incomes, κ is the lowest income of any person in the population; and 
* a positive number θ the &quot;Pareto index&quot;; as this increases, the tail of the distribution gets thinner. As applied to distribution of incomes, this means that the larger the value of the Pareto index θ the smaller the proportion of incomes many times as big as the smallest incomes.

Pareto interpolation can be used when the available information includes the proportion of the sample that falls below each of two specified numbers &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot;. For example, it may be observed that 45% of individuals in the sample have incomes below &quot;a&quot; = $35,000 per year, and 55% have incomes below &quot;b&quot; = $40,000 per year.

Let

:&quot;P&quot;&quot;a&quot; = proportion of the sample that lies below &quot;a&quot;;

:&quot;P&quot;&quot;b&quot; = proportion of the sample that lies below &quot;b&quot;.

Then the estimates of κ and θ are

:formula_1

and

:formula_2

The estimate of the median would then be

:formula_3

since the actual population median is

:formula_4

<text>Elizabeth Barry (1658 – 7 November 1713) was an English actress of the Restoration period.

Elizabeth Barry&#x27;s biggest influence on Restoration drama was her presentation of performing as the tragic actress. She worked in large, prestigious London theatre companies throughout her successful career: from 1675 in the Duke&#x27;s Company, 1682 – 1695 in the monopoly United Company, and from 1695 onwards as a member of the actors&#x27; cooperative usually known as Betterton&#x27;s Company, of which she was one of the original shareholders. Her stage career began 15 years after the first-ever professional actresses had replaced Shakespeare&#x27;s boy heroines on the London stage.

The actor Thomas Betterton said that her acting gave &quot;success to plays that would disgust the most patient reader&quot;, and the critic and playwright John Dennis described her as &quot;that incomparable Actress changing like Nature which she represents, from Passion to Passion, from Extream to Extream, with piercing Force and with easy Grace&quot;.

==Early career==
Barry&#x27;s first performance was at the age of 17 in Thomas Otway&#x27;s &quot;Alcibiades&quot;. Her performance was so poor that she was fired from the Duke&#x27;s Company. She then met John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester. Their relationship grew from professional colleagues to lovers. They had one child named Elizabeth, who was born in 1677 and died in 1689.

Barry drew on her relationship with Rochester for many of her sexual performances. While multiple sources confirm that Rochester was Barry&#x27;s lover, the only source for the coaching story is a &quot;Life&quot; of Barry published in 1741 – 65 years after the events – by Edmund Curll, well known for his fanciful and inaccurate biographies.

Barry was a successful comedian who created a variety of Restoration comedy heroines throughout her career, but her greatest impact on Restoration drama was as a tragic actress. Her capacity for projecting pathos was an inspiration to playwrights Thomas Otway and Thomas Southerne in the three famous tragic roles they wrote for her: Monimia in Otway&#x27;s &quot;The Orphan&quot; (1680), Belvidera in Otway&#x27;s &quot;Venice Preserved&quot; (1682), and Isabella in Southerne&#x27;s &quot;The Fatal Marriage&quot; (1694). These three roles, wrote the prompter John Downes, &quot;gain&#x27;d her the Name of Famous Mrs. Barry, both at Court and City, for whenever She Acted any of these three Parts, she forc&#x27;d Tears from the Eyes of her Auditory, especially those who have any Sense of Pity for the Distress&#x27;t.&quot; 

In his autobiography, many years later, Colley Cibber recalled the power of her voice: &quot;When distress of Tenderness possess&#x27;d her, she subsided into the most affecting Melody and Softness. In the Art of exciting Pity, she had a Power beyond all the Actresses I have yet seen, or what your Imagination can conceive.&quot; Elizabeth Howe has argued that it was Barry&#x27;s success in the role of Monimia that &quot;clinched the movement away from heroic drama and started the establishment of &#x27;she-tragedy&#x27; as a popular genre.&quot; Also known as pathetic tragedy, innocent women were represented as sexual objects and as victims of male lust.

Barry was always described as being a plain woman. Portraits suggest intelligence but heavy features and the playwright Thomas Shadwell writes in a letter in 1692 that it would have been better to have staged Nicholas Brady&#x27;s &quot;The Rape&quot; in Roman dress, &quot;and then w&#x27;th a Mantle to have covered her hips Mrs Barry would have acted ye part.&quot; Apparently, none of this mattered to contemporaries. Even though Barry was &quot;the ugliest Woman&quot; in the world off stage, wrote an anonymous author in &quot;A Comparison Between the Two Stages&quot; (1702), she was &quot;the finest Woman in the World upon the Stage.&quot;

Barry&#x27;s acting style was embedded in the influences from her own personality and life. Elizabeth as a person was seen to be beautiful and virtuous. Although many of the characters she played were virgins, it was known about her relationship with Rochester. It has also been known that she channeled her sexual relationship with Rochester through many of her performances. Also during this time, it was seen that Barry&#x27;s body had metaphorical meaning to the description of her character. When Barry starred in &quot;The Orphan&quot;, it was implied that &quot;the trope of the female breast to represent innocence or ruin (consider the many references to Monimia’s &quot;swelling breasts&quot; or &quot;white breasts&quot;). Thus Otway uses the dismemberment of the female body, expressed through the &quot;mangled breasts besmeared with blood&quot;, to signify the ruin of the state&quot;.

==Later career==
Later into Barry’s career, she was given more roles of a motherhood figure than a sexual object. Barry worked for the Duke&#x27;s Company from 1675 to 1682, taking the role of Cordelia opposite Thomas Betterton&#x27;s Lear in Nahum Tate&#x27;s 1681 adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;. After the Duke&#x27;s and the King&#x27;s companies were amalgamated in 1682, she continued as one of the star performers of the new United Company, which remained for 12 years the only theatrical company in London. The absence of rival companies left the actors in a weak bargaining position in relation to management.

One year after her performance in &quot;The Fatal Marriage&quot;, Barry decided to leave the United Company due to a salary dispute in 1695. She then proceeded to work for a new company with actor Thomas Betterton and actress Anne Bracegirdle. Barry was one of the original patent-holders of the actors&#x27; company, which opened at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields with the smash hit of William Congreve&#x27;s &quot;Love For Love&quot; in 1695 and continued to successfully challenge Rich&#x27;s United Company.There was a huge wage gap between men and woman performers as Betterton was paid £4 and 20s per week and Barry received only £2 and 10s shillings.

Barry officially retired from the stage in 1710 at 52 years old; her acting career lasted a total of 35 years. Her retirement fell short as she died three years later at the age of 55 due to a fever.

==Selected list of plays and roles==
==Fictional portrayals==
Barry is a supporting character in &quot;The Libertine&quot;, Stephen Jeffreys&#x27; play about John Wilmot&#x27;s life, as well as its 2004 film adaptation, in which she is portrayed by Samantha Morton. Barry also appears as a character in the 2015 play &quot;[exit Mrs Behn] or, The Leo Play&quot; by Christopher vanDer Ark.

<doc id="161004" wikidata="Q7079381" url="?curid=161004" title="Office of the Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines">
<text>The Office of the Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government (OMACG) was created in 1935 upon the initiative of President Manuel L. Quezon by the Philippine and American governments for the purposes of developing a system of national defense for the Commonwealth of the Philippines by 1946. OMACG&#x27;s recommendations were adopted by the Philippine National Assembly in Commonwealth Act Number 1, the National Defense Act of 1935.

The Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government was U.S. Major General Douglas MacArthur, who was assisted by Major Dwight Eisenhower and Major James Ord; along with four officers from the Philippine Department, under Major General Lucius Holbrook (1936-1938) and Major General Grunert (1940-1941), and retired Lieutenant Colonel Sidney L. Huff. and Major Fredreich Walter Seefeld ( U.S. Army Retired)

OMACG produced a plan calling for a gradual 10-year build up so that the Philippines would have small regular and reserve armies, an air force, and a fleet of torpedo boats (the Offshore Patrol). The tactical organization of this army was based on divisions of ~7,500 troops.

==War Plans and Seacoast Defenses==
The office drew up defense plans for the islands of Luzon, Cebu, Negros, Panay, Leyte, Mindanao, Bohol, Mindoro, and many of the smaller islands. The plans included the establishment of seacoast defenses along the seven straits which give access to the inland waters of the Philippines.

These plans did not involve the use of US forces, but were intended for use by district military commanders of the Philippine Army which was to be created under the National Defense Act.

The seacoast defenses, mentioned above, were to consist, naturally, of heavy coastal guns. These defenses were scheduled to be completed in April 1942. The War Department, at some time or other, had sent twenty-four 155 mm guns, without fire control equipment. Later, while assigned to USAFFE, MacArthur asked for four 12 inch, four 8 inch, and 22 additional 155 mm guns, as well as 30 searchlights. This request was received in December, too late to be acted upon before Japanese offensive actions in 1941.

==Staff Changes==
Upon the accidental death of Lieutenant Colonel Ord, in January 1938, Major Sutherland was brought in as his replacement. Lieutenant Colonel Eisenhower left in December 1939 and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Marshall. In October 1937, Captain Casey joined the group as an engineering advisor, and later Major Marquat was appointed as an antiaircraft advisor. These men would stay with MacArthur throughout the war.

==MacArthur&#x27;s Point Of View==
MacArthur argues, &quot;A small fleet will have distinct effect in compelling any hostile force to approach cautiously. The only naval task is that of inshore defense. This will be provided by flotillas of fast torpedo boats, supported by an air force.&quot;

MacArthur adds, &quot;These islands have enormous defensive advantages. Luzon has only 2 areas where a hostile army could land. Each of these positions is broken by strong defensive positions.

MacArthur continues, &quot;When developed the Philippine Army will be strong enough to oppose any conceivable expeditionary force. By 1946, the Islands will be in a favorable posture of defensive security.&quot;
