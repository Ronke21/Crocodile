<text>Karl Ernst Haushofer (27 August 1869 – 10 March 1946) was a German general, professor, geographer, and diplomat. Haushofer&#x27;s concept of Geopolitik influenced the ideological development of Adolf Hitler. Rudolf Hess was also a student of Haushofer, and during Hess and Hitler&#x27;s incarceration by the Weimar Republic after the Beer Hall Putsch, Haushofer visited Landsberg Prison to teach and mentor both Hess and Hitler. Haushofer also coined the political use of the term &quot;Lebensraum&quot;, which Hitler also used to justify both crimes against peace and genocide. At the same time, however, Gen. Haushofer&#x27;s half-Jewish wife and their children were categorized as &quot;Mischlinge&quot; under the Nuremberg Laws. Their son, Albrecht Haushofer, was issued a German Blood Certificate through the influence of Rudolf Hess, but was arrested in 1944 over his involvement with the July 20th plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler and overthrow the Nazi Party. During the last days of the war, Albrecht Haushofer was summarily executed by the SS for his role in the German Resistance.

After being interrogated by Fr. Edmund A. Walsh, who recommended to Robert H. Jackson that Haushofer be prosecuted at the Nuremberg Trials for complicity in Nazi war crimes, Karl and Martha Haushofer died together in a suicide pact outside of their home in the American Zone of Occupied Germany.

==Life and early career==
Haushofer belonged to a family of artists and scholars. He was born in Munich to Max Haushofer Jr, a well-known professor of economics, politician and author of both academic and literary works, and Adele Haushofer (née Fraas). His grandfather was the landscape painter Max Haushofer Sr. On his graduation from the Munich Gymnasium (high school), in 1887, Haushofer entered the 1st Field Artillery regiment &quot;Prinzregent Luitpold&quot; of the Bavarian Army and completed &quot;Kriegsschule&quot;, &quot;Artillerieschule&quot; and &quot;War Academy (Kingdom of Bavaria)&quot;. In 1896, he married Martha Mayer-Doss (1877–1946) whose father was Jewish. They had two sons, Albrecht Haushofer and Heinz Haushofer (1906–1988). In 1903, he accepted a teaching position at the Bavarian War Academy.

In November 1908, Haushofer was ordered to Tokyo as a military attaché to study the Imperial Japanese Army and as a military advisor in artillery instruction. He travelled with his wife via India and South East Asia and arrived in February 1909. He was received by Emperor Meiji and became acquainted with many important people in politics and the armed forces. In autumn 1909, he travelled with his wife for a month to Korea and Manchuria on the occasion of a railway construction. In June 1910, they returned to Germany via Russia and arrived one month later. However, shortly after returning to Bavaria, he began to suffer from a severe lung disease and was given a leave from the army for three years.

During his convalescence, from 1911 to 1913, Haushofer would work on his doctorate of philosophy from Munich University for a thesis on Japan titled &quot;Dai Nihon, Betrachtungen über Groß-Japans Wehrkraft, Weltstellung und Zukunft&quot; (&quot;Reflections on Greater Japan&#x27;s Military Strength, World Position, and Future&quot;). He established himself as one of Germany’s foremost experts regarding the Far East, and co-founded the geopolitical monthly &quot;Zeitschrift für Geopolitik&quot; (ZfG), which he would co-edit until it was suspended towards the end of World War II.

Haushofer continued his career as a professional soldier after the annexation of Bavaria by Germany, serving in the army of Imperial Germany and returning to teach War History at the Military Academy in Munich.

During World War I, he commanded a brigade on the Western Front. But he was disillusioned with Germany&#x27;s readiness for the tests of warfare.

When the United States entered the war, it cemented two especially bitter hatreds for Haushofer. The first was for the U.S. America was a &quot;deceitful, ravenous, hypocritical, shameless beast of prey,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Americans are truly the only people on this world that I regard with a deep, instinctive hatred.&quot;

At the same time, Haushofer developed an especially virulent strain of anti-semitic feeling. In letters to his wife Martha, whose own father was Jewish, Haushofer wrote of Jewish &quot;treason against Volk, race and country.&quot; He repeated false but common slanders alleging that Jews declined to fight for their country of citizenship, and were guilty of war
profiteering.

The solution to these ills besetting Germany, he declared, would be a powerful and charismatic leader. &quot;A man! A kingdom, an imperial crown for a man worthy of the name!&quot; &quot;You see how ready for a Caesar I am,&quot; he wrote in another letter to Martha, &quot;and what kind of a good instrument I would be for a Caesar, if we had one and if he knew how to make use of me.&quot;

Haushofer would both find and influence Germany&#x27;s next Caesar. After retiring from the army with the rank of &quot;Generalmajor&quot; (major general) in 1919, he forged a friendship with the young Rudolf Hess, who became his scientific assistant and later rose to be the deputy leader of the Nazi Party, second in authority only to Hitler.

In 1919, Haushofer successfully defended his second dissertation, and became Privatdozent for political geography at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, and was made a professor in 1933, although he declined a formal position and salary, because that would have affected his military pension.

==&quot;Geopolitik&quot; and relationship with Hitler==

Haushofer entered academia with the aim of restoring and regenerating Germany. He believed the Germans&#x27; lack of geographical knowledge and geopolitical awareness to be a major cause of Germany’s defeat in World War I, because Germany had found itself with a disadvantageous alignment of allies and enemies. His specialty was to combine the fields of geography, history, economics, demography, political science, and anthropology into a new discipline that came to be called Geopolitik. Haushofer himself could not plainly describe this &quot;new science,&quot; but its principal thrust was the view the state as a person or organism, shaped over time by its unique geography and history into a specific national character. In this context he coined the term &quot;Lebensraum&quot; - &quot;room to live&quot; - to describe the territory that a healthy and expanding state needed to sustain its population. This notion would be adopted by Hitler and the Nazi party in its most aggressive and militaristic interpretation.

In 1923, Hitler was jailed following his failed &quot;Beer Hall Putsch,&quot; and Rudolf Hess surrendered to be imprisoned alongside his leader in Landsberg Prison.

Haushofer became a teacher of politics and philosophy to both Hess and Hitler. According to scholar Holger Herwig, &quot;Like a dry sponge, Hitler soaked up what Haushofer offered.&quot;

Haushofer&#x27;s son Albrecht considered that his father&#x27;s most powerful contribution to Hess and Hitler was his own substantial credibility as a soldier and scholar: &quot;One has to imagine what it meant in the Bavaria of that time,&quot; he wrote, &quot;when a man of my father’s stature [general and professor] and popularity constantly traveled out to Landsberg.&quot;

From 1925 to 1931 and from 1933 to 1939, Haushofer broadcast monthly radio lectures on the international political situation. That &quot;Weltpolitischer Monatsbericht&quot; made him a household name in contemporary Germany, and he came to be known in circles far removed from academia. He was a founding member of the Deutsche Akademie, of which he served as president from 1934 to 1937. He was a prolific writer, publishing hundreds of articles, reviews, commentaries, obituaries and books, many of which were on Asian topics, and he arranged for many leaders in the Nazi party and in the German military to receive copies of his works.

After the establishment of the German Nazi government, Haushofer remained friendly with Hess, who protected Haushofer&#x27;s wife from the racial laws of the Nazis, which deemed her a &quot;half-Jew&quot;. During the prewar years, Haushofer was instrumental in linking Japan to the Axis powers, acting in accordance with the theories in his book &quot;Geopolitics of the Pacific Ocean&quot;.

Under Hitler&#x27;s regime, Haushofer became both rich and immensely influential. But his influence and his public profile shrank abruptly after his patron, Rudolf Hess, flew to Scotland in May 1941 in a doomed effort to make peace with the United Kingdom. Hess was purged from the Nazi Party, and the Haushofer family, with its close relationship with Hess and its Jewish background, once again came under suspicion.

In 1944 Haushofer&#x27;s son Albrecht was implicated in the July 20 Plot to assassinate Hitler. Karl was arrested on 28 July 1944, and imprisoned for a month at Dachau before he was released.

Albrecht went into hiding but was arrested on 7 December 1944 and put into the Moabit prison in Berlin. Karl wrote a personal letter to Hitler pleading for mercy for his son, but never sent it. During the night of 22–23 April 1945, with only days remaining in the war, he and other prisoners, among them Klaus Bonhoeffer, were walked out of the prison by an SS death squad and shot on the orders of Josef Goebbels. When his brother Heinz found his body, Albrecht was still clutching a sheaf of papers on which he had written dozens of poems in his last days trying to make sense of his life, his father&#x27;s work, and the war. Those eighty poems were eventually published as &quot;The Moabit Sonnets.&quot; In the thirty-eighth sonnet, titled &quot;The Father,&quot; Albrecht indicts his father for helping to unleash the horrors of Nazi brutality:

Karl Haushofer was devastated by Albrecht&#x27;s death. And yet - even though the Nazis had murdered his beloved son, and their war had left Germany in ruins around him, Haushofer continued to blame &quot;New York&#x27;s finance Jews&quot; for the destruction of his beloved Munich.

He was repeatedly arrested by the American forces he so detested. Beginning on 24 September 1945, Karl Haushofer was informally interrogated by Fr. Edmund A. Walsh on behalf of Nuremberg Trials prosecutor Robert H. Jackson to determine whether Haushofer should also stand trial. Fr. Walsh ultimately reported to Jackson that Haushofer was both legally and morally guilty of complicity in Nazi war crimes. Citing &quot;the role of geopolitics in corrupting education into a preparation for war&quot;, Walsh accused Haushofer and his associates of being &quot;basically as guilty as the better-known war criminals.&quot; In his later memoir of the Nuremberg Trials, Walsh further alleged that &quot;The tragedy of Karl Haushofer&quot; was his participation in the &quot;nationalizing&quot; of academic scholarship and of turning Geopolitik into a weapon supplying &quot;an allegedly scientific basis and justification for international brigandage.&quot;

==Death==
On the night of 10–11 March 1946, Karl Haushofer and his wife committed suicide in a secluded hollow on their Hartschimmelhof estate at Pähl/Ammersee. Both drank arsenic and his wife then hanged herself from a tree branch.

Haushofer left a detailed map to help his son, Heinz, find the bodies. In a suicide note, he declared that he wanted &quot;no form of state or church funeral, no obituary, epitaph, or identification of my grave... I want to be forgotten and forgotten.&quot;

Fr. Walsh visited their graves and wrote in his diary, &quot;I could not help but think of the deep tragedy of this death by night, alone, in a lonely gulley, of the last of the geopoliticians! What an inscrutable destiny, that after 19 [years of] teaching and warning [the] U.S.A. about the teachings of Haushofer, I should today be kneeling over his suicide&#x27;s body in one of the loneliest spots in Bavaria!&quot;

==Geopolitics==
Haushofer developed Geopolitik from widely varied sources, including the writings of Oswald Spengler, Alexander Humboldt, Karl Ritter, Friedrich Ratzel, Rudolf Kjellén, and Halford J. Mackinder.

Geopolitik contributed to Nazi foreign policy chiefly in the strategy and justifications for lebensraum. The theories contributed five ideas to German foreign policy in the interwar period:
* organic state
* lebensraum
* autarky
* pan-regions
* land power/sea power dichotomy.

Geostrategy as a political science is both descriptive and analytical like political geography but adds a normative element in its strategic prescriptions for national policy. While some of Haushofer&#x27;s ideas stem from earlier American and British geostrategy, German geopolitik adopted an essentialist outlook toward the national interest, oversimplifying issues and representing itself as a panacea. As a new and essentialist ideology, geopolitik resonated with the post-World War I insecurity of the populace.

Haushofer&#x27;s position in the University of Munich served as a platform for the spread of his geopolitical ideas, magazine articles, and books. In 1922, he founded the Institute of Geopolitics in Munich, from which he proceeded to publicize geopolitical ideas. By 1924, as the leader of the German geopolitik school of thought, Haushofer would establish the &quot;Zeitschrift für Geopolitik&quot; monthly devoted to geopolitik. His ideas would reach a wider audience with the publication of &quot;Volk ohne Raum&quot; by Hans Grimm in 1926, popularizing his concept of lebensraum. Haushofer exercised influence both through his academic teachings, urging his students to think in terms of continents and emphasizing motion in international politics, and through his political activities. While Hitler&#x27;s speeches would attract the masses, Haushofer&#x27;s works served to bring the remaining intellectuals into the fold.

Geopolitik was essentially a consolidation and codification of older ideas, given a scientific gloss:

*Lebensraum was a revised colonial imperialism;
*Autarky a new expression of tariff protectionism;
*Strategic control of key geographic territories exhibiting the same thought behind earlier designs on the Suez and Panama Canals; a view of controlling the land in the same way as those choke points control the sea
*Pan-regions (&quot;Panideen&quot;) based upon the British Empire, and the American Monroe Doctrine, Pan-American Union and hemispheric defense, whereby the world is divided into spheres of influence.
*Frontiers – His view of barriers between peoples not being political (borders) or natural placements of races or ethnicities but as being fluid and determined by the will or needs of ethnic/racial groups.
The key reorientation in each dyad is that the focus is on land-based empire rather than naval imperialism.

Ostensibly based upon the geopolitical theory of American naval expert Alfred Thayer Mahan, and British geographer Halford J. Mackinder, German geopolitik adds older German ideas. Enunciated most forcefully by Friedrich Ratzel and his Swedish student Rudolf Kjellén, they include an organic or anthropomorphized conception of the state, and the need for self-sufficiency through the top-down organization of society. The root of uniquely German geopolitik rests in the writings of Karl Ritter who first developed the organic conception of the state that would later be elaborated upon by Ratzel and accepted by Hausfhofer. He justified lebensraum, even at the cost of other nations&#x27; existence because conquest was a biological necessity for a state&#x27;s growth.

Ratzel&#x27;s writings coincided with the growth of German industrialism after the Franco-Prussian war and the subsequent search for markets that brought it into competition with Britain. His writings served as welcome justification for imperial expansion. Influenced by Mahan, Ratzel wrote of aspirations for German naval reach, agreeing that sea power was self-sustaining, as the profit from trade would pay for the merchant marine, unlike land power. Haushofer was exposed to Ratzel, who was friends with Haushofer&#x27;s father, a teacher of economic geography, and would integrate Ratzel&#x27;s ideas on the division between sea and land powers into his theories, saying that only a country with both could overcome this conflict.

Haushofer&#x27;s geopolitik expands upon that of Ratzel and Kjellén. While the latter two conceive of geopolitik as the state as an organism in space put to the service of a leader, Haushofer&#x27;s Munich school specifically studies geography as it relates to war and designs for empire. The behavioral rules of previous geopoliticians were thus turned into dynamic normative doctrines for action on lebensraum and world power.

Haushofer defined geopolitik in 1935 as &quot;the duty to safeguard the right to the soil, to the land in the widest sense, not only the land within the frontiers of the Reich, but the right to the more extensive &quot;Volk&quot; and cultural lands.&quot; Culture itself was seen as the most conducive element to dynamic special expansion. It provided a guide as to the best areas for expansion, and could make expansion safe, whereas projected military or commercial power could not. Haushofer even held that urbanization was a symptom of a nation&#x27;s decline, evidencing a decreasing soil mastery, birthrate and effectiveness of centralized rule.

To Haushofer, the existence of a state depended on living space, the pursuit of which must serve as the basis for all policies. Germany had a high population density, but the old colonial powers had a much lower density, a virtual mandate for German expansion into resource-rich areas. Space was seen as military protection against initial assaults from hostile neighbors with long-range weaponry. A buffer zone of territories or insignificant states on one&#x27;s borders would serve to protect Germany. Closely linked to that need was Haushofer&#x27;s assertion that the existence of small states was evidence of political regression and disorder in the international system. The small states surrounding Germany ought to be brought into the vital German order. These states were seen as being too small to maintain practical even if they maintained large colonial possessions and would be better served by protection and organization within Germany. In Europe, he saw Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Denmark, Switzerland, Greece and the &quot;mutilated alliance&quot; of Austro-Hungary as supporting his assertion.

Haushofer&#x27;s version of autarky was based on the quasi-Malthusian idea that the earth would become saturated with people and no longer able to provide food for all. There would essentially be no increases in productivity.

Haushofer and the Munich school of geopolitik would eventually expand their conception of lebensraum and autarky well past the borders of 1914 and &quot;a place in the sun&quot; to a New European Order, then to a New Afro-European Order, and eventually to a Eurasian Order. That concept became known as a pan-region, taken from the American Monroe Doctrine, and the idea of national and continental self-sufficiency. That was a forward-looking refashioning of the drive for colonies, something that geopoliticians did not see as an economic necessity but more as a matter of prestige, putting pressure on older colonial powers. The fundamental motivating force would be not economic but cultural and spiritual. Haushofer was, what is called today, a proponent of &quot;Eurasianism&quot;, advocating a policy of German–Russian hegemony and alliance to offset an Anglo-American power structure&#x27;s potentially dominating influence in Europe.

Beyond being an economic concept, pan-regions were a strategic concept as well. Haushofer acknowledges the strategic concept of the Heartland Theory put forward by the British geopolitician Halford Mackinder. If Germany could control Eastern Europe and subsequently Russian territory, it could control a strategic area to which hostile seapower could be denied. Allying with Italy and Japan would further augment German strategic control of Eurasia, with those states becoming the naval arms protecting Germany&#x27;s insular position.

==Relationship with Nazi leaders==

Biographers of both Haushofer and of Hitler disagree somewhat on the extent of Haushofer&#x27;s influence on Hitler: Ian Kershaw writes that &quot;[his] influence was probably greater than the Munich professor was later prepared to acknowledge,&quot; while Joachim C. Fest says that Haushofer&#x27;s contributions to Hitler&#x27;s ideation were important, but that &quot;Hitler&#x27;s version of [Haushofer&#x27;s] ideas was distinctly his own.&quot; Haushofer told Walsh that he viewed Hitler as a half-educated man who never correctly understood the &quot;Geopolitik&quot; principles explained by Hess, and saw Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop (in office: 1938-1945) as the principal distorter of geopolitik in Hitler&#x27;s mind.

Most writers on Haushofer agree that at the very least, through his teaching and his writing, he gave to Hitler and the Nazis intellectual legitimacy - providing Hitler and his cronies with a political and philosophical vocabulary that they would use to justify the goals that they pursued with war and terror. After World War II, Haushofer would deny that he had taught Hitler, and claimed that the National Socialist Party perverted Hess&#x27;s study of geopolitik.

Although Haushofer accompanied Hess on numerous propaganda missions and participated in consultations between Nazis and Japanese leaders, he claimed that Hitler and the Nazis only seized upon half-developed ideas and catchwords. Furthermore, the Nazi party and government lacked any official organ that was receptive to geopolitik, leading to selective adoption and poor interpretation of Haushofer&#x27;s theories. Ultimately, Hess and Konstantin von Neurath, the German Minister of Foreign Affairs (in office: 1932-1938), were the only officials Haushofer would admit had a proper understanding of geopolitik.

Father Edmund A. Walsh, professor of geopolitics and dean at Georgetown University, who interviewed Haushofer after Allied victory in preparation for the Nuremberg trials, disagreed with Haushofer&#x27;s assessment that Hitler and the Nazis terribly distorted geopolitik. He cites Hitler&#x27;s speeches declaring that small states have no right to exist, and the Nazi use of Haushofer&#x27;s maps, language and arguments. Even if distorted somewhat, Walsh felt that was enough to implicate Haushofer&#x27;s geopolitik.

Various more damning allegations about Haushofer&#x27;s involvement with political extremism have been presented over the years. Louis Pauwels, in his book &quot;Monsieur Gurdjieff&quot;, describes Haushofer as a former student of the Greek-Russian mystic George Gurdjieff. Others, including Pauwels, claimed that Haushofer created a Vril society and that he was a secret member of the Thule Society. It was theorized that Haushofer had co-written, or helped to write, &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. Rumors floated that Haushofer was Hess&#x27;s father, or, conversely, that the two men were lovers. Holger dismisses these unproven allegations as &quot;mythmaking&quot; and &quot;rumors.&quot;

Aware of some of these accusations, after the war Haushofer denied assisting Hitler in writing &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, saying that he only knew of it once it was in print, and that he never read it. But Walsh found, as scholars have since, that even if Haushofer did not directly assist Hitler, discernible new elements appeared in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, as compared to previous speeches made by Hitler. Geopolitical ideas of lebensraum, space for depth of defense, appeals for natural frontiers, balancing land and seapower, and geographic analysis of military strategy entered Hitler&#x27;s thought between his imprisonment and the publishing of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. Chapter XIV, on German policy in Eastern Europe, in particular displays the influence of the materials Haushofer brought Hitler and Hess while they were imprisoned. Hans Frank, the governor general of wartime Poland, quoted Hitler as telling him, &quot;Landsberg was my university education at state expense.&quot;

Haushofer was never a member of the Nazi Party, and did voice disagreements with the party. Haushofer came under suspicion because of his contacts with left-wing socialist figures within the Nazi movement (led by Gregor Strasser) and because of his advocacy of essentially a German–Russian alliance. The Nazi left-wing had some connections to the Communist Party of Germany and some of its leaders, especially those who were influenced by the National Bolshevist philosophy of a German–Russian revolutionary alliance, as advocated by Ernst Niekisch (1889-1967), Julius Evola (1898-1974), Ernst Jünger (1895-1998), Friedrich Hielscher (1902-1990) and other figures of the &quot;conservative revolution&quot;. Haushofer did profess loyalty to the Führer and make anti-Semitic remarks. However, his emphasis was always on space over race; he believed in environmental rather than racial determinism. In contrast to his personal hostility towards Jews, he declined to associate himself with anti-Semitism as a state policy, especially because his wife was half-Jewish. Haushofer claimed that after 1933 much of what he wrote was distorted under duress: his wife had to be protected by Hess&#x27;s influence (who managed to have her awarded &quot;honorary German&quot; status).),
and his son and grandson were imprisoned for two and a half months.

Several authors have explored more obscure angles on the contact between Haushofer and the Nazi establishment. Suggestions such as Haushofer&#x27;s connection to Gurdjieff&#x27;s occultism, or that he had studied Zen Buddhism, or had been initiated at the hands of Tibetan lamas – are subject of debate.

The influence of Haushofer on Nazi ideology is dramatized in the 1943 short documentary propaganda film, &quot;Plan for Destruction&quot;, which was nominated for an Academy Award.

<text>Tobias Vincent Maguire (born 27 June 1975) is an American actor and film producer. He is best known for starring as Spider-Man in Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy (2002–2007), a role he later reprised in &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021).

Maguire was born in Los Angeles and began his career in supporting roles. His breakthrough role was as Spider-Man in the 2002 film of the same name. He reprised the role in the sequels, &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;. Maguire would expand his career with dramatic roles in &quot;The Good German&quot; and &quot;Seabiscuit&quot;. He would also start producing films, including &quot;25th Hour&quot; and &quot;Seabiscuit&quot;.

Maguire received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama for war drama &quot;Brothers&quot; (2009). He established his own production company in 2012 called Material Pictures, and co-produced &quot;Good People&quot; (2012), &quot;Pawn Sacrifice&quot; (2014), and &quot;Babylon&quot; (2022).

==Early life==
Tobias Vincent Maguire was born on 27 June 1975, in Santa Monica, California, to Wendy Brown and Vincent Maguire. His parents were 18 and 20 respectively when he was born, and split when he was 3 years old. Maguire described his childhood as tough and lonely, with his father Vincent being convicted of robbing a bank in 1993. His parents married shortly after his birth but separated when he was two years old, and Maguire spent much of his childhood living with various family members and moved around often. Maguire grew up poor.

During his childhood, Maguire entertained the idea of becoming a chef and wanted to enroll in a home economics class as a sixth grader. His mother offered him $100 to take a drama class instead, and he agreed. The transient nature of his school years began to take a toll on Maguire emotionally, and after another relocation for his freshman year, he dropped out of high school and did not return. Instead, he pursued an acting career. In his teenage years, Maguire suffered from drug abuse and alcoholism.

Maguire&#x27;s first appearance in a feature film was in &quot;The Wizard&quot; (1989) as an extra. He was cast as the lead in the FOX TV series &quot;Great Scott!&quot; in 1992, which was canceled nine weeks after premiere.

Maguire met fellow child actor Leonardo DiCaprio in the 1980s while auditioning for the same roles. The pair would become close friends. For example, both auditioned for the same part in the 1990 TV series based on the 1989 comedy &quot;Parenthood&quot;. DiCaprio was cast, and Maguire later got a guest role at least partly on DiCaprio&#x27;s recommendation. The same scenario played out during casting for the 1993 movie &quot;This Boy&#x27;s Life&quot; (featuring Robert De Niro as the lead): DiCaprio got the main role of teenager Tobias &quot;Toby&quot; Wolff, and Maguire got a part as one of his friends.

===1995–2001: Critical acclaim===
Maguire then sought help for a drinking problem from Alcoholics Anonymous; he has been sober ever since.

As part of his recovery from alcoholism and learning to deal with his self-described &quot;addictive and compulsive nature&quot;, Maguire changed his career path slightly to obtain roles where he and DiCaprio would not always be in competition for the same part. The move paid off when Maguire was given the role of Paul Hood, a teenage boarding school student whose narration anchors the action in Ang Lee&#x27;s 1997 film &quot;The Ice Storm.&quot; This led to a variety of lead roles in films such as &quot;Pleasantville&quot;, &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot;, and &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;.

In the 1998 film &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; he portrayed a hitchhiker who meets Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo during their drive to Las Vegas. In &quot;Ride with the Devil&quot; (1999), opposite Jewel Kilcher, Maguire portrayed Jakob Roedel, the son of a unionist German immigrant who joins his Southern friends in the Missouri Riders, avenging the atrocities committed against Missourians by Kansas Jayhawkers and redleggers. Maguire voiced Lou in the movie &quot;Cats &amp; Dogs&quot; (2001).

===2002–2013: &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and stardom===

In 2002, Maguire starred in &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, based on the Marvel Comics superhero, Spider-Man. The film was a major success and made him a star. He reprised the role in the sequels &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; (2004) and &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; (2007), and also voiced Spider-Man for the video game adaptations of the films.

His performance as Spider-Man earned him glowing reviews. Mark Caro of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that, &quot;with his big, round, soulful eyes, Maguire always has been able to convey a sense of wonder, and his instinct for understatement also serves him well here.&quot; Due to script and production complications, a proposed fourth &quot;Spider-Man&quot; movie did not materialize. Sony&#x27;s Columbia Pictures decided to reboot the franchise. The film, titled &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, was released on 3 July 2012, with a different actor, Andrew Garfield, playing the lead.

Maguire had a lead role as the jockey John M. &quot;Red&quot; Pollard in &quot;Seabiscuit&quot;, about the famous racehorse Seabiscuit. In 2006, he starred in his first villainous role as Corporal Patrick Tully opposite George Clooney and Cate Blanchett in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;The Good German&quot;, based on the Joseph Kanon novel of the same name.

Maguire is also a producer whose production credits include &quot;25th Hour&quot; (2002), &quot;Whatever We Do&quot; (2003), and &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; (2003), for which he served as executive producer. In 2008, he made a cameo appearance in the action comedy film &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot; as a gay 18th century monk in love with Father O&#x27;Malley, played by Robert Downey Jr. in the faux trailer for &quot;Satan&#x27;s Alley&quot;. He was a last-minute replacement in the role, and due to previously scheduled commitments was only available to be on set for two hours to film his scenes. Near the end of &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot;, it is revealed that Maguire&#x27;s character has been nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for &quot;Satan&#x27;s Alley&quot;, which award he loses to Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) for his role in &quot;Tropic Blunder&quot;, presented by Kirk Lazarus.
In 2009, Maguire starred alongside Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman in the Jim Sheridan-directed war drama &quot;Brothers&quot; as Sam Cahill, a prisoner of war who returns from Afghanistan and starts believing that his wife has become romantically involved with his brother. He received critical acclaim and a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in the film. Of the nomination, Maguire said, &quot;I had no expectation about getting a nomination, but I was watching nonetheless. My wife and my son got really excited. I was sort of surprised – I was like, &#x27;Oh, wow.&#x27; And I couldn&#x27;t hear the latter part of my name.&quot; Maguire lost to Jeff Bridges for his role in &quot;Crazy Heart&quot;. Maguire was set to star as The Writer in &quot;Life of Pi&quot; (2012), directed by Ang Lee, but was cut from the film during production for being &quot;too famous&quot; compared to the rest of the cast. He was replaced by Rafe Spall, with whom Lee reshot the scenes that had already been shot with Maguire.

In 2012, Maguire was a co-producer of &quot;Good People&quot;. That same year, he also established his own production company, Material Pictures, which secured independent financing in 2013 to help it produce more feature films. Maguire and DiCaprio once again performed together in Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s remake of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (2013); DiCaprio played the title role, while Maguire played the story&#x27;s narrator, Nick Carraway.

===2014–present: Reduced output===
His next film, &quot;Pawn Sacrifice&quot; (2014), was also co-produced by Material Pictures. It was a Cold War thriller based on the true story of American chess prodigy Bobby Fischer, played by Maguire. The film details the events leading up to and including the world chess championship in 1972, when Fischer challenges Soviet chess grandmaster and world champion Boris Spassky, acted by Liev Schreiber. The film received mostly positive reviews.

Maguire reunited with Alec Baldwin after &quot;Cats &amp; Dogs&quot; (2001) in the animated movie &quot;The Boss Baby&quot; (2017), where he voiced the adult version of Tim Templeton. He also reprised his role as Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021) alongside successors Tom Holland and Andrew Garfield. He appeared in Damien Chazelle&#x27;s ensemble film &quot;Babylon&quot;, also serving as an executive producer. He reprised his role as Spider-Man in &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot; through archive footage.

==Personal life==
Maguire has been a vegetarian since 1992; in 2009, he became a vegan. He has made changes in his diet to either gain or lose weight for film roles: he dramatically decreased his calorie intake for &quot;Seabiscuit&quot;, followed by a rapid increase to regain weight for &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;. Maguire has been sober since age 19, having experienced &quot;some difficulty&quot; with alcohol in his late teens.

Maguire met jewelry designer Jennifer Meyer in 2003 while he was shooting &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; at Universal Studios, and they became engaged in April 2006. Their daughter was born in November that year. Meyer&#x27;s father, Universal studios head Ronald Meyer, reportedly helped Maguire regain his job after being fired from &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; in 2003. Maguire and Meyer married on 3 September 2007, in Kailua Kona, Hawaii. Their second child, a son, was born in May 2009. On 18 October 2016, the couple announced their separation after nine years of marriage. In 2020, Meyer filed for divorce after four years of separation.

===Poker===
In 2004, Maguire took up tournament poker. He has finished in the money in several events and has been tutored by poker professional Daniel Negreanu. Maguire was seen on ESPN&#x27;s coverage of the 2005, 2006, and 2007 World Series of Poker Main Event Championship. He was one of many celebrities, along with Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben Affleck, who participated in Molly Bloom&#x27;s high-stake poker games at The Viper Room in the mid-2000s, and received negative press coverage for allegedly demanding Bloom &quot;bark like a seal&quot; for a $1,000 poker chip after a tournament he won. Maguire&#x27;s actions at the game, as well as those of other celebrities, are portrayed by Michael Cera in the film &quot;Molly&#x27;s Game&quot; through the composite character &quot;Player X&quot;.

<doc id="163231" wikidata="Q9634" url="?curid=163231" title="1960 Winter Olympics">
<text>The 1960 Winter Olympics (officially the VIII Olympic Winter Games and also known as Squaw Valley 1960) were a winter multi-sport event held from February 18 to 28, 1960, at the Squaw Valley Resort (now known as Palisades Tahoe) in Squaw Valley (now known as Olympic Valley), California, United States. The resort was chosen to host the Games at the 1956 meeting of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Squaw Valley was an undeveloped resort in 1955, so the infrastructure and all of the venues were built between 1956 and 1960 at a cost of . The layout was designed to be intimate, allowing spectators and competitors to reach most of the venues on foot.

The 1960 Winter Games hosted athletes from 30 nations, competing in four sports and 27 events. Biathlon and women&#x27;s speed skating made their Olympic debuts. Bobsled was not on the Winter Olympic program for the only time; the organizers had decided the events did not warrant the cost of building a bobsled venue after a poll indicated that only nine countries were planning to participate. These Olympics became the first to be televised live, making them accessible to millions of viewers in real time, and introduced multiple technological innovations, including instant replay.

== Host city selection ==

Squaw Valley, now called Palisades Tahoe, was a struggling ski resort with minimal facilities, which made its selection to host the 1960 Winter Olympics a surprise. Wayne Poulsen and Alexander Cushing were inspired to bid for the Olympics by a newspaper article mentioning that Reno, Nevada, and Anchorage, Alaska, had expressed interest in the Games. Poulsen, president of the Squaw Valley Development Company, petitioned California Governor Goodwin Knight to support a bid to host the Olympic Games. Knight&#x27;s administration agreed and recommended that the California Legislature appropriate $1 million to the effort.

Based on the financial support received from the State of California, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) approved the bid on January 7, 1955. Cushing and the USOC received a resolution passed by the United States Congress and signed by President Dwight Eisenhower, calling on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to consider Squaw Valley&#x27;s bid for the 1960 Games. Preliminary reports were drafted and submitted to the IOC, which was considering bids from Innsbruck, Austria, St. Moritz, Switzerland and Chamonix, France. During the planning stages of the 1960 Olympics, Innsbruck was the leading choice for the Olympic site. Cushing, however, managed to secure the bid after winning over the International Olympic Committee in Paris with a scale model of his planned Olympic site.

Squaw Valley was provisionally awarded the right to host the Games, but IOC president Avery Brundage warned the Organizing Committee that unless more funds were secured by April 1956, the bid would be awarded to Innsbruck. Another $4 million was committed by the state legislature, which met Brundage&#x27;s requirements, and on April 4, 1956, the right to host the 1960 Winter Olympics was officially awarded to Squaw Valley. Competitors and officials from European nations were angered by the selection; they felt that the alpine ski courses were not up to specifications and that its base elevation of above sea level would prove too stressful on the athletes.
== Organization ==


Squaw Valley in 1956 consisted of one chair lift, two rope tows, and a fifty-room lodge. Cushing presented the site as a blank canvas of unspoiled environment, where a world-class ski resort could be constructed. The obscurity of the location was underscored at the closing ceremonies of the 1956 Winter Olympics. Traditionally the mayor of the current host city passes a flag to the mayor of the next host city signalling the transfer of the Games. Since Squaw Valley was an unincorporated village it had no city government. John Garland, an IOC member from California, was asked to stand in and received the flag from the mayor of Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo.

After winning the right to host the Games, the California Olympic Commission was formed. They were given four years to build venues, an Olympic Village, and expand infrastructure. With the expansion of roads, bridges, water and electrical capacity the resort of Squaw Valley was developed. Hotels, restaurants, administration buildings, a Sheriff&#x27;s office and a sewage pumping and treatment plant were all constructed to support the influx of visitors for the Games. Organizers wanted the Olympics to be intimate with the venues close to one another. The Blyth Memorial Ice Arena was built along with three outdoor skating rinks, a 400-meter speed skating oval and four dormitories to house athletes. One venue deemed impractical to build was the bobsled run. Organizers felt the lack of possible entrants (a pre-Olympic poll indicated that only nine countries were planning to participate) and the high cost of building the run were sufficient deterrents to leave the bobsled events off the 1960 Olympic program.

Several design innovations and new technologies were used for the 1960 Games. The speed skating, figure skating and ice hockey events were held on artificial ice for the first time in Olympic history. A refrigeration plant capable of heating 4,800 homes had to be built to generate and maintain the ice. The heat generated from the refrigeration plant was used to warm spectators, provide hot water, and melt the snow off of roofs. New timing equipment provided by Longines was installed that used a quartz clock to measure to the hundredths of a second. IBM provided a computer that was capable of tabulating results and printing them in English and French. Blyth Arena, site of the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the figure skating and ice hockey competitions, was built with a gap in the roof, which would slide closed as the cables supporting the roof contracted during cold weather.

Funding for Cushing&#x27;s initial bid to the IOC came from the California Legislature and investors in the &quot;Squaw Valley Development Company&quot;, who were owners of the existing resort. To fund the construction, organizers turned to the federal government, which provided about a quarter of the $80 million required to host the Games. The monies were used to build sports arenas and provide military support for security during the Games. Further funding was secured from private sponsorships and from the State of California. Governor Knight and his successor Edmund &quot;Pat&quot; Brown remained behind the project, seeing it as a means to showcase the state of California to the world. In the end, the 1960 Winter Olympics became the first to be televised live, making the games accessible to millions of viewers in real-time. The event signaled the rise of United States skiing to the level of world-famous European skiing, and Squaw Valley&#x27;s preparedness for the games showed the international community that United States ski resorts offered world-class facilities.

=== Television ===
Prior to the 1960 Winter Olympics only the Cold War standoff had been televised, notably at the 1952 Summer Olympics and the 1956 Summer Olympics. Other than that, 24 hours or so after the events the United States televised brief news updates on the sporting competition. The 1960 Winter Olympics were the first Olympic games that were broadcast live on US television with anchorman Walter Cronkite talking the audience through a limited coverage. Broadcasts of events to European audiences had begun in 1956. What was unprecedented was the sale of exclusive United States television rights to broadcast the games. The Organizing Committee decided to sell the television broadcast rights to CBS for $50,000. Unknown at the time was how lucrative the sale of broadcast rights would become. For example, CBS purchased the rights to broadcast the 1960 Summer Olympics for $550,000. During the games, CBS broadcast 15 and a quarter hours of television focusing on ice hockey, speed skating, figure skating, alpine skiing and ski jumping. The impact of television was felt during the games. In the men&#x27;s slalom event, officials who were unsure if a skier had missed a gate asked CBS if they could review tape of the event. This request gave CBS the idea for what is now known as instant replay.

==Politics==

Athletic competition between the Soviet Union and United States had grown intense during the 1950s. Their opposing ideologies and interests in nations such as East and West Germany, China and North and South Korea created a delicate situation as the 1960 Winter Games approached. Of particular interest was the question of whether China would be allowed to participate. Chinese athletes last competed at the 1952 Summer Games but had since withdrawn from the IOC due to a dispute over Taiwan&#x27;s participation as a separate country. The United States supported Taiwan while the Soviet Union stood behind China. Given that the 1960 Games were to be held in the US, there was concern among IOC members that the host nation would not allow China or any other Communist country to take part. In 1957, IOC president Avery Brundage, an American, announced that if the U.S. refused entry to any country recognized by the IOC, they would revoke Squaw Valley&#x27;s invitation to host the Games and he would resign the presidency. The U.S. did allow athletes from Communist countries to participate. China continued calls for Taiwan to be expelled from the IOC, demands that were refused until China broke off relations ending any hope they would participate in the 1960 Games.

Problems similar to the issue with China broke out over North Korea and East Germany. Prior to the Korean War the IOC had recognized the Olympic committee of Korea, which was headquartered in Seoul. North Korea was not recognized as a separate country by the IOC, which maintained the existence of one Olympic committee. A unified team compromise was proposed but rejected by North Koreans, which meant only athletes from South Korea participated due to their prior recognition. Pressure for full recognition of East Germany continued despite the fact that both East and West Germany had participated as a unified team in 1956. One of the conditions for a unified German team was that the athletes be represented by a neutral flag. Initially West German officials refused to agree to this stipulation citing the fact that the West German flag had been used at both the 1956 Winter and Summer Games, although that flag was also used by East Germany prior to 1959. Eventually the neutral flag was adopted and a unified German team participated.

== Events ==
The Games were held from February 18 to 28. Medals were awarded in 27 &quot;events&quot; contested in 4 sports (8 disciplines). The sport of biathlon was added to the program as were speed skating events for women. After a poll was taken indicating that only nine countries would send a bobsled team, the organizers determined that bobsled would be removed from the Olympic program. Despite petitions from the International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation to reconsider, the organizers felt they could not justify the costs of constructing a bobsled run for nine competing nations. It would be the only time in Winter Olympic history that the bobsled events were not held.

=== Opening ceremonies ===
The chairman of the Pageantry Committee was Walt Disney, who was responsible for producing both the opening and closing ceremonies at Blyth Memorial Arena. He organized an opening that included 5,000 entertainers, the release of 2,000 pigeons, and a military gun salute of eight shots, one for each of the previous Winter Olympic Games. The opening ceremonies were held on February 18, 1960, at Blyth Arena in the midst of a blizzard. The heavy snow fall caused traffic problems that delayed the ceremony by an hour. The festivities began with a sustained drum roll as the flags of each participating nation were raised on specially designed flag poles. Vice President Richard Nixon represented the United States government and declared the Games open. The Olympic cauldron was lit by Kenneth Henry, Olympic champion of the 500 meter speed skating race at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo. The Olympic oath was taken by Carol Heiss on behalf of all the athletes. As the national delegations left the stadium fireworks concluded the ceremonies.

===Closing ceremonies===
The Games were brought to a close on afternoon of February 28 in Blyth Memorial Arena in front of 20,000 people. Flags of the participating nations were followed by the athletes who marched as a group with no national distinctions, a tradition carried over from the 1956 Summer Olympics. The flag bearers made a semi-circle around the rostrum and the national anthems of Greece (even though the nation did not send a delegation to Squaw Valley), the United States, and Austria were played as their respective flags were raised. The Olympic Charter determinates that the Greek flag honors Greece as the originators of the Olympic Games, and it was displayed during the ceremony even despite Greece&#x27;s absence, which was the only time in Olympic history that the country failed to send a team. The United States flag represented the host nation and the Austrian flag was raised because Innsbruck, Austria was to be the host of the next games. IOC president Avery Brundage declared the Games closed, at which point the Olympic flame was extinguished. The Games concluded with the release of several thousand balloons.

== Sport competitions ==
=== Ice hockey ===
The ice hockey tournament took place at Blyth Arena and the Squaw Valley Olympic Skating Rink. Controversy over the amateur status of communist players overshadowed the event. Canadian Olympic officials objected to the use of &quot;professional amateurs&quot; by Eastern Bloc countries, and especially the Soviet Union. They alleged that the Soviets were giving their elite hockey players phantom jobs in the military that allowed them to play hockey full-time, which gave Soviet teams an advantage that they used to dominate Olympic hockey tournaments for more than 30 years. This issue started coming to light during the 1960 Games and would culminate in a Canadian boycott of the Olympic hockey tournament at the 1972 and 1976 Winter Olympics. The team from the United States won an improbable gold medal, defeating the favored Canadian and Soviet teams, who took silver and bronze respectively. This was the first Olympic gold medal in ice hockey for the United States and it would mark the last time a Soviet team did not win the Olympic tournament until the United States victory at the 1980 Winter Olympics.

=== Cross-country skiing ===
There were six cross-country skiing races at the 1960 Olympics, four for men and two for women, all held at the McKinney Creek Cross-Country Complex. Soviet women swept the 10 kilometer race, which was the first medal sweep for the Soviets in cross-country skiing at the Winter Olympics. They were however upset by Sweden in the 3×5 kilometer relay. Nordic countries dominated the men&#x27;s competition. Swedish lumberjack Sixten Jernberg added a gold and silver to the four medals he won in 1956. He would add two golds and a bronze in 1964 to finish his Olympic career with nine medals, which made him the most decorated Winter Olympian. The Finnish skier Veikko Hakulinen added a gold, silver and bronze to the two golds and two silvers he had won in 1952 and 1956.

=== Biathlon ===
Biathlon made its Olympic debut in 1960. The precursor to biathlon, military patrol, was on the Olympic program for the first Olympic Games in 1924. It was a demonstration sport at the 1928, 1936, and 1948 Winter Olympics, though the competition was only open to members of the armed forces. Military patrol fell out of favor in 1948 due to anti-military sentiments in the post World War II era. Biathlon took its place and was instated as a full Olympic sport in 1960. It encompassed a 20 kilometer cross-country race with four shooting stations at ranges from . Klas Lestander from Sweden became the first Olympic champion, Antti Tyrväinen from Finland and Soviet Aleksandr Privalov placed second and third respectively.

=== Nordic combined ===

The Nordic combined competition was held on February 21 at the Squaw Valley normal hill and the McKinney Creek Cross-Country Complex. The athletes had three jumps on February 21 followed by a 15 kilometer cross-country race. German skier Georg Thoma became the first non-Nordic athlete to win the event. He would win bronze medal in the Nordic combined in 1964. Tormod Knutsen of Norway and Nikolay Gusakov of the Soviet Union placed second and third, respectively. Gusakov&#x27;s wife, Maria Gusakova, competed in the cross-country events, winning a gold and silver.

=== Ski jumping ===
There was one ski jumping event at the 1960 Games, the men&#x27;s normal hill, which was held on February 28. In 1964, the competition would be expanded to include a men&#x27;s large hill event. Helmut Recknagel became the first German to win the event. In 1994 he would be joined by Jens Weißflog as the only German ski jumping Olympic champions. Niilo Halonen from Finland and Austrian Otto Leodolter earned the silver and bronze medals.

=== Figure skating ===

Held at Blyth Memorial Arena, the figure skating competition took place between February 19 and 26. Although this was not the first time figure skating had been held indoors, it would never be contested outdoors again. There were three events: men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s singles and the pairs competition. In the men&#x27;s event, David Jenkins of the United States, brother of 1956 Winter Olympic figure skating champion Hayes Jenkins, won the gold medal. It was his second Olympic medal, having won the bronze in 1956. Czechoslovakian Karol Divín took the silver medal, and Canadian Donald Jackson won the bronze. American Carol Heiss, winner of the silver medal in 1956, became the Olympic champion in 1960. A year later she married Hayes Jenkins and starred in &quot;Snow White and the Three Stooges&quot;. The Dutch skater Sjoukje Dijkstra took the silver medal; she would finish her amateur career with an Olympic gold medal in 1964. Barbara Ann Roles competed for the United States and won its third figure skating medal of the competition when she took the bronze. The Soviet Union made its Olympic figure skating debut by sending two couples to compete in the pairs competition; the result belied the fact that Soviet skaters would soon come to dominate this event. The competition was won by the Canadian pair of Barbara Wagner and Bob Paul who had won the last three world championships. The German pair Marika Kilius and Hans-Jürgen Bäumler followed their recent European championship victory with the Olympic silver medal, and the American husband-and-wife team of Ron and Nancy Ludington took the bronze.

=== Speed skating ===

Women were allowed to compete in the Olympic speed skating competition for the first time in 1960. Multiple nations had requested the inclusion of women&#x27;s speed skating events in the program for the 1956 Games, but the request was rejected by the IOC. The issue was revisited for the 1960 Games, and since women had been competing internationally since 1936 and there was a World Championship for women&#x27;s speed skating, the IOC agreed to four events; 500, 1,000, 1,500, and 3,000 meters (the same as the number of men&#x27;s events). Most of the events were held on the Squaw Valley Olympic Skating Rink, which was an outdoor skating oval, and featured artificial ice, a first for the Olympic speed skating competition. Given the altitude and the artificial ice, the rink was the fastest in the world, as evidenced by Norwegian Knut Johannesen&#x27;s world record in the 10,000 meter event. At 15:46.6 he was the first skater ever to break the 16-minute barrier, and eclipsed the previous world record by 46 seconds. Despite Johannesen&#x27;s victory, the Soviets dominated the speed skating events, winning all but two of the races. Yevgeny Grishin won both the 500 and 1,500 meter races, though he shared the 1,500 meter gold medal with Norwegian Roald Aas. Grishin said that &quot;watching the Soviet flag wave in the blue American sky&quot; was the proudest moment of his life. Lidiya Skoblikova from the Soviet Union was the other double gold medalist, when she won the 1,500 and 3,000 meter events. Polish skaters Helena Pilejczyk and Elwira Seroczyńska placed second and third in the 1,500 meter event, which were Poland&#x27;s only medals of the Games. They were just the second and third Poles ever to win Winter Olympic medals.

=== Alpine skiing ===

Despite the facilities being constructed from scratch at Squaw Valley, the resort did have steep mountain slopes in close proximity, resulting in some of the most difficult alpine skiing courses in Olympic history. Both men and women competed in the downhill, giant slalom and slalom with all 6 events held between February 20 and 26. The men&#x27;s downhill was won by Frenchman Jean Vuarnet who changed the sport by becoming the first Olympic champion to use metal skis. Swiss skier Roger Staub won the giant slalom and Ernst Hinterseer from Austria was the slalom champion. German Heidi Biebl won the women&#x27;s downhill, Yvonne Rüegg of Switzerland won the giant slalom and Anne Heggtveit from Canada won the slalom. Penny Pitou of the United States was the only multiple medal winner with two silvers in the downhill and giant slalom.

==Calendar==
:&quot;All dates are in Pacific Standard Time (UTC-8)&quot;

† The numeral indicates the number of event finals for each sport held that day.&lt;section end=&quot;Calendar&quot;/&gt;

==Venues==
The lack of facilities prior to the Olympics gave organizers freedom to tailor the layout of the venues to fit the needs of the athletes. Their vision was for an intimate Games in which athletes and spectators could walk between venues. This was accomplished with the exception of the cross-country events, which were held at McKinney Creek, a drive from Squaw Valley. In prior Winter Olympics the athletes were housed in hotels or billeted with local families. Since no such facilities existed in Squaw Valley, the organizers decided to build the first Olympic Village at the Winter Games. Competitors slept in one of four dormitories and ate together in a dining room. The complex was located centrally, with access to all the sporting facilities.

The peaks surrounding Squaw Valley were used for the alpine skiing events. The ladies&#x27; downhill and men&#x27;s slalom and giant slalom were on KT-22 mountain, while the ladies&#x27; slalom and giant slalom were contested on Little Papoose Peak. Squaw Peak was the site of the men&#x27;s downhill competition. Prior to the Games, concerns persisted that the courses would not meet international standards. To address these concerns, a test event was held in 1959 and the attending delegates from the International Ski Federation (FIS) left assured that the events would comply with FIS rules and specifications. Bleachers were constructed for officials, coaches and spectators, along with broadcast booths for radio and television. Papoose Peak Jumps was located on Little Papoose Peak directly opposite Blyth Memorial Arena. Designed by Heini Klopfer, the hill was innovative in that it had 40-, 60-, and 80–meter jumps. Tall trees on both sides protected athletes from the wind, and it was situated so that the sun would be at the jumper&#x27;s back during the competition.

McKinney Creek Stadium was built to host all of the cross-country races, which included the biathlon and a portion of the Nordic combined competition. It consisted of a timing building, two Quonset huts for competitors and course workers, a scoreboard, and bleachers to accommodate 1,200 people. Shooting ranges were interspersed throughout the biathlon course, and were supervised by non-commissioned officers of the United States military.

Season tickets for the Games ranged from $60 to $250, the latter included a reserved seat at the ice arena; the daily admission fee 

Blyth Memorial Arena was the centerpiece of the Games. It hosted the opening and closing ceremonies jointly with Squaw Valley Olympic Skating Rink, and also hosted the figure skating competition, a few of the speed skating events, as well as most of the games in the hockey tournament. All three of the sports were held indoors on artificial ice for the first time in Olympic history. At full capacity, the arena accommodated 11,000 people, 8,500 of whom were seated. One end of the stadium could be opened and closed, depending on the event. During the ceremonies it was open to allow for the entrance of the athletes; during the competitions it was closed to accommodate more spectators. A special machine was created to resurface the ice for all three competitions. It could lay a new ice surface on the 400-meter speed skating track in 45 minutes. In addition to resurfacing the ice, the machine created the snow dividers that delineated the racing lanes. The roof was designed on a suspension principle, using cables rather than vertical supports; this removed any visual impediments for the audience, but it weakened the strength of the roof. Given the amount of annual snowfall designers planned on using heat generated by the refrigeration plant to melt the snow. There were flaws in the design and miscalculations in the load the roof could bear, and during a particularly heavy snowfall in 1983, a portion of the roof collapsed and the building was subsequently demolished.

, three buildings from the 1960 Winter Olympics remain in Palisades Tahoe (formerly known as Squaw Valley). An expansion of the resort&#x27;s village, currently in the planning stages, would see two of these buildings demolished.

==Participating nations==
Athletes from 30 nations competed at the 1960 Games. South Africa competed at the Winter Games for the first time and was the first African country to participate; it would be the last until 1994. Athletes from West Germany (FRG) and East Germany (GDR) competed together as the United Team of Germany from 1956 to 1964. The number at the end of each country denotes the number of athletes each country sent.

<doc id="163234" wikidata="Q47209" url="?curid=163234" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets">
<text>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling. It is the second novel in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. The plot follows Harry&#x27;s second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, during which a series of messages on the walls of the school&#x27;s corridors warn that the &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; has been opened and that the &quot;heir of Slytherin&quot; would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families. These threats are found after attacks that leave residents of the school petrified. Throughout the year, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione investigate the attacks.

The book was published in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1998 by Bloomsbury and later in the United States on 2 June 1999 by Scholastic Inc. Although Rowling says she found it difficult to finish the book, it won high praise and awards from critics, young readers, and the book industry, although some critics thought the story was perhaps too frightening for younger children. Much like with other novels in the series, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; triggered religious debates; some religious authorities have condemned its use of magical themes, whereas others have praised its emphasis on self-sacrifice and the way one&#x27;s character is the result of one&#x27;s choices.

Several commentators have noted that personal identity is a strong theme in the book and that it addresses issues of racism through the treatment of non-human, non-magical, and non-living people. Some commentators regard the story&#x27;s diary that writes back as a warning against uncritical acceptance of information from sources whose motives and reliability cannot be checked. Institutional authority is portrayed as self-serving and incompetent.

The film adaptation of the novel, released in 2002, became (at the time) the fifth highest-grossing film ever and received generally favourable reviews. Video games loosely based on &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; were also released for several platforms, and most obtained favourable reviews.

==Plot==
While spending the summer with the Dursleys, the twelve-year-old Harry Potter is visited by Dobby, a house-elf. Dobby says Harry is in danger and must promise not to return to Hogwarts. When Harry refuses, Dobby uses magic to destroy a pudding made by Aunt Petunia. Believing that Harry created the mess, Uncle Vernon locks him in his room. The Ministry of Magic sends a notice accusing Harry of performing underage magic and threatening to expel him from Hogwarts.

The Weasley brothers Ron, Fred, and George arrive in their father&#x27;s flying car and take Harry to their home. When Harry and the Weasleys go to Diagon Alley for school supplies, they meet Gilderoy Lockhart, a celebrity author who is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. At King&#x27;s Cross station, Harry and Ron cannot enter Platform 9¾ to board the Hogwarts Express, so they fly to Hogwarts in the enchanted car.

During the school year, Harry hears a strange voice emanating from the castle walls. Argus Filch&#x27;s cat is found Petrified, along with a warning scrawled on the wall: &quot;The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir, beware&quot;. Harry learns that the Chamber supposedly houses a monster that attacks Muggle-born students, and which only the Heir of Slytherin can control. During a Quidditch match, a rogue Bludger strikes Harry, breaking his arm. Professor Lockhart botches an attempt to mend it, which sends Harry to the hospital wing. Dobby visits Harry and reveals that he jinxed the Bludger and sealed the portal at King&#x27;s Cross. He also tells Harry that house-elves are bound to serve a master, and cannot be freed unless their master gives them clothing.

After another attack from the monster, students attend a defensive duelling class. During the class, Harry displays the rare ability to speak Parseltongue, the language of snakes. Moaning Myrtle, a ghost who haunts a bathroom, shows Harry and his friends a diary that was left in her stall. It belonged to Tom Riddle, a student who witnessed another student&#x27;s death when the Chamber was last opened. During the next attack by the monster, Hermione Granger is Petrified.

Harry and Ron discover that the monster is a Basilisk, a gigantic snake that can kill victims with a direct gaze and Petrify them with an indirect gaze. Harry realizes the Basilisk is producing the voice he hears in the walls. After Ron&#x27;s sister Ginny is abducted and taken into the Chamber, Harry and Ron discover the Chamber entrance in Myrtle&#x27;s bathroom. When they force Lockhart to enter with them, he confesses that the stories he told of his heroic adventures are fabrications. He attempts to erase the boys&#x27; memories, but his spell backfires and obliterates his own memory.

Harry finds an unconscious Ginny in the Chamber. A manifestation of Tom Riddle appears and reveals that he is Lord Voldemort and the Heir of Slytherin. After explaining that he opened the Chamber, Riddle summons the Basilisk to kill Harry. Dumbledore&#x27;s phoenix Fawkes arrives, bringing Harry the Sorting Hat. While Fawkes blinds the Basilisk, Harry pulls the Sword of Gryffindor from the Hat. He slays the serpent, then stabs the diary with a Basilisk fang, destroying it and the manifestation of Riddle. Later, Harry liberates Dobby by tricking his master into giving him clothing. At the end of the novel, the Petrified students are cured and Gryffindor wins the House Cup.

==Publication and reception==

===Development===
J.K Rowling found it difficult to finish &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; because she was afraid it would not live up to the expectations raised by &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;. After delivering the manuscript to Bloomsbury on schedule, she took it back for six weeks of revision.

In early drafts of the book, the ghost Nearly Headless Nick sang a self-composed song explaining his condition and the circumstances of his unknown death. This was cut because the book&#x27;s editor did not care for the poem, which has been subsequently published as an extra on J. K. Rowling&#x27;s official website. The family background of Dean Thomas was removed because Rowling and her publishers considered it an &quot;unnecessary digression,&quot; and she considered Neville Longbottom&#x27;s own journey of discovery &quot;more important to the central plot.&quot;

Gilderoy Lockhart&#x27;s character was inspired by an acquaintance of Rowling who was, in her words, &quot;even more objectionable than his fictional counterpart&quot; and &quot;used to tell whopping great fibs about his past life, all of them designed to demonstrate what a wonderful, brave and brilliant person he was.&quot;

===Publication===

&quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; was published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999. It immediately took first place in UK bestseller lists, displacing popular authors such as John Grisham, Tom Clancy and Terry Pratchett, and making Rowling the first author to win the British Book Awards Children&#x27;s Book of the Year for two years in succession. In June 1999, it went straight to the top of three US bestseller lists, including in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

First edition printings had several errors, which were fixed in subsequent reprints. Initially, Dumbledore said Voldemort was the last remaining ancestor of Salazar Slytherin instead of his descendant. Gilderoy Lockhart&#x27;s book on werewolves is entitled &quot;Weekends with Werewolves&quot; at one point and &quot;Wanderings with Werewolves&quot; later in the book.

===Critical response===
&quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; was met with near-universal acclaim. On &quot;BookBrowse&quot;, a site that aggregates book reviews such as media reviews, the book received a from &quot;Critics&#x27; Opinion&quot;.

In &quot;The Times&quot;, Deborah Loudon described it as a children&#x27;s book that would be &quot;re-read into adulthood&quot; and highlighted its &quot;strong plots, engaging characters, excellent jokes and a moral message which flows naturally from the story&quot;. Fantasy author Charles de Lint agreed, and considered the second Harry Potter book to be just as good as &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, a rare achievement among series of books. Thomas Wagner regarded the plot as very similar to that of the first book, based on searching for a secret hidden under the school. However, he enjoyed the parody of celebrities and their fans that centres round Gilderoy Lockhart, and approved of the book&#x27;s handling of racism. Tammy Nezol found the book more disturbing than its predecessor, particularly in the rash behaviour of Harry and his friends after Harry withholds information from Dumbledore, and in the human-like behaviour of the mandragoras used to make a potion that cures petrification. Nevertheless, she considered the second story as enjoyable as the first.

Mary Stuart thought the final conflict with Tom Riddle in the Chamber was almost as scary as in some of Stephen King&#x27;s works, and perhaps too strong for young or timid children. She commented that &quot;there are enough surprises and imaginative details thrown in as would normally fill five lesser books.&quot; Like other reviewers, she thought the book would give pleasure to both children and adult readers. According to Philip Nel, the early reviews gave unalloyed praise while the later ones included some criticisms, although they still agreed that the book was outstanding.

Writing after all seven books had been published, Graeme Davis regarded &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; as the weakest of the series, and agreed that the plot structure is much the same as in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;. He described Fawkes&#x27;s appearance to arm Harry and then to heal him as a &quot;deus ex machina&quot;: he said that the book does not explain how Fawkes knew where to find Harry; and Fawkes&#x27;s timing had to be very precise, as arriving earlier would probably have prevented the battle with the basilisk, while arriving later would have been fatal to Harry and Ginny.

===Awards and honours===
Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; was the recipient of several awards. The American Library Association listed the novel among its 2000 Notable Children&#x27;s Books,
as well as its Best Books for Young Adults. In 1999, Booklist named &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; as one of its Editors&#x27; Choices, and as one of its Top Ten Fantasy Novels for Youth. The Cooperative Children&#x27;s Book Center made the novel a CCBC Choice of 2000 in the &quot;Fiction for Children&quot; category. The novel also won Children&#x27;s Book of the Year British Book Award, and was shortlisted for the 1998 Guardian Children&#x27;s Award and the 1998 Carnegie Award.

&quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; won the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize 1998 Gold Medal in the 9–11 years division. Rowling also won two other Nestlé Smarties Book Prizes for &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;. The Scottish Arts Council awarded their first ever Children&#x27;s Book Award to the novel in 1999, and it was also awarded Whitaker&#x27;s Platinum Book Award in 2001. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 23 on the BBC&#x27;s survey The Big Read.

==Main themes==
&quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; continues to examine what makes a person who he or she is, which began in the first book. As well as maintaining that Harry&#x27;s identity is shaped by his decisions rather than any aspect of his birth, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; provides contrasting characters who try to conceal their true personalities: as Tammy Nezol puts it, Gilderoy Lockhart &quot;lacks any real identity&quot; because he is nothing more than a charming liar. Riddle also complicates Harry&#x27;s struggle to understand himself by pointing out the similarities between the two: &quot;both half-bloods, orphans raised by Muggles, probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin.&quot;

Opposition to class, death and its impacts, experiencing adolescence, sacrifice, love, friendship, loyalty, prejudice, and racism are constant themes of the series. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; Harry&#x27;s consideration and respect for others extends to the lowly, non-human Dobby and the ghost Nearly Headless Nick. According to Marguerite Krause, achievements in the novel depend more on ingenuity and hard work than on natural talents.

Edward Duffy, associate professor at Marquette University, says that one of the central characters of &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; is Tom Riddle&#x27;s enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley – just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests Rowling intended this as a warning against passively consuming information from sources that have their own agendas. Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an instant messaging or chat room system, they agree about the dangers of relying too much on the written word, which can camouflage the author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart&#x27;s self-promoting books.

Antonello Fabio Caterino, an Italian forensic linguist and philologist, stated that the conversations Harry and Voldemort had through the diary could be considered a &quot;modern transposition&quot; of Petrarca&#x27;s &quot;Secretum&quot;, a text often compared to a diary, which details an imaginary dialogue between the writer and Augustine of Hippo. Caterino analysed similarities between themes found in both books, starting from the idea of a fragmented soul: Harry and Voldemort are both seeking Voldemort&#x27;s Horcruxes, which are fragments of his soul, and Petrarca also focuses on the concept &quot;animae fragmenta&quot;, meaning soul&#x27;s fragments.

Immorality and the portrayal of authority as negative are significant themes in the novel. Marguerite Krause states there are few absolute moral rules in Harry Potter&#x27;s world, for example Harry prefers to tell the truth, but lies whenever he considers it necessary – very like his enemy Draco Malfoy. At the end of &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, Dumbledore retracts his promise to punish Harry and Ron if they break any more school rules – after Professor McGonagall estimates they have broken over 100 – and lavishly rewards them for ending the threat from the Chamber of Secrets. Krause further states that authority figures and political institutions receive little respect from Rowling. William MacNeil of Griffith University, Queensland, Australia states that the Minister for Magic is presented as a mediocrity. In his article &quot;Harry Potter and the Secular City&quot;, Ken Jacobson suggests the Ministry as a whole is portrayed as a tangle of bureaucratic empires, saying that &quot;Ministry officials busy themselves with minutiae (e.g. standardising cauldron thicknesses) and coin politically correct euphemisms like &#x27;non-magical community&#x27; (for Muggles) and &#x27;memory modification&#x27; (for magical brainwashing).&quot;

This novel implies it begins in 1992: the cake for Nearly-Headless Nick&#x27;s 500th deathday party bears the words &quot;Sir Nicholas De Mimsy Porpington died 31 October 1492&quot;.

===Connection to &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;===
&quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; has many links with the sixth book of the series, &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;. In fact, &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; was the working title of &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; and Rowling says she originally intended to present some &quot;crucial pieces of information&quot; in the second book, but ultimately felt &quot;this information&#x27;s proper home was book six&quot;. Some objects that play significant roles in &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; first appear in &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;: the Hand of Glory and the opal necklace that are on sale in Borgin and Burkes; a Vanishing Cabinet in Hogwarts that is damaged by Peeves the Poltergeist; and Tom Riddle&#x27;s diary, which is later revealed to be a Horcrux. Additionally, these two novels are the ones with the most focus on Harry&#x27;s relationship with Ginny Weasley.

<doc id="163238" wikidata="Q407402" url="?curid=163238" title="Air Jamaica">
<text>Air Jamaica was the flag carrier of Jamaica. It was owned and operated by Caribbean Airlines from May 2011 until the cessation of operations in 2015. Caribbean Airlines Limited, headquartered in Piarco, Trinidad and Tobago, had administrative offices for Air Jamaica located at Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston, Jamaica.

The Jamaican government was formerly the owner of Air Jamaica. It sold the airline to Caribbean Airlines in 2011, which resulted in the Jamaican government owning 16% of Caribbean Airlines.

==History==
According to R.E.G. Davies in his &quot;Airlines of Latin America Since 1919&quot;, the first incarnation of Air Jamaica was founded on August 27, 1963, after the government of Jamaica decided not to invest in British West Indian Airways (BWIA). Dubbed Jamaica Air Service Ltd., its shareholders were the government of Jamaica (51 percent), the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), and BWIA (16 percent). BWIA&#x27;s employees in Jamaica were transferred to the new airline. Service to Miami and New York began on May 1, 1966.

BOAC, Britain&#x27;s major international airline at the time, and BWIA had continued to maintain the leased aircraft (this operating arrangement would not expire until the end of May 1969). The Jamaican government preferred a more independent approach and eventually prepared to establish a new company, Air Jamaica (1968) Ltd.

Air Jamaica was established in October 1968, and started operations on April 1, 1969, connecting Kingston (KIN) and Montego Bay (MBJ), with New York (JFK) and Miami (MIA). At that time the Jamaican government owned a substantial part of the airline, with Air Canada owning a minority share (40 percent) and providing aircraft (one Douglas DC-8-61 and three McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jetliners), pilots, technical, maintenance and logistical help.

During the 1970s, Air Jamaica expanded rapidly. Flights were added to Toronto (YYZ) and Montreal (YUL) in Canada, to Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport (SJU) in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Philadelphia (PHL) and many other destinations, especially across the Caribbean. Long-haul services to Europe were started on 1 April 1974. Air Jamaica used a Douglas DC-8 and three DC-9s for a large part of the 1970s, but the Boeing 727-200 became part of the fleet toward the end of the decade when the government bought out Air Canada&#x27;s share. Growth slowed in the 1980s. New routes were opened to Baltimore (BWI) and Atlanta (ATL).

In 1983, Air Jamaica was operating nonstop Boeing 747-100 jumbo jet service between Kingston and London Heathrow Airport (LHR) with this flight continuing on from London to Frankfurt, Germany (FRA) and was also flying nonstop Airbus A300 service between Kingston and John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York City.

In 1989, the Jamaican government announced plans for the privatization of the airline, which had been fully state owned since Air Canada divested its 40 percent shareholding in 1980. However, it was not until May 1994 that a partial selloff was announced when a group of Jamaican and Canadian investors known as the Air Jamaica Acquisition Group (AJAG) agreed to acquire a 70 percent share of the carrier for $26.5 million. Another five percent share was earmarked for employees. The government retained responsibility for liabilities, which were considerable.

A merger of Air Jamaica with other Caribbean airlines was already being proposed, with British Airways invited to take a 25 percent holding in the venture. In the first stage, Air Jamaica was to have merged its operations with those of Trinidad and Tobago Airways, parent of BWIA. Guyana Airways Corporation and Leeward Islands Air Transport were to later join the venture.

During the 1990s, Air Jamaica continued to expand. The airline took over the Kingston-Nassau, Bahamas (NAS) route, which had been left by British Airways, began a code sharing agreement with Delta Air Lines and opened a route to Phoenix (PHX, which was later dropped), and to Frankfurt (FRA), London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Santo Domingo (SDQ) and Ft. Lauderdale (FLL). The route to Phoenix was opened because Air Jamaica was looking to expand in the American west beyond its route to Los Angeles (LAX). In 1994 the company was partially privatized, the private investors were led by hotelier Gordon &quot;Butch&quot; Stewart with the government retaining 25 percent of the company and giving five percent to the airline&#x27;s employees. It continued operating Airbus jetliners, including the wide-body Airbus A340, and began a feeder service, a frequent flyer program (7th Heaven), and an inflight magazine, named &quot;SkyWritings&quot;. In 1996, the airline was flying nonstop service between Kingston and London Heathrow Airport with an Airbus A310 jetliner. In 1999, Air Jamaica was operating nonstop service between Montego Bay and Los Angeles with Airbus A320 aircraft.

In December 2004, after financial losses, the government of Jamaica resumed full ownership of Air Jamaica. It employed 2,522 people as of March 2007.

By March 2010, Air Jamaica had net losses in 40 of its 42 years of existence, and an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.54 billion.

In 2007, the new Jamaican government began to consider privatization of Air Jamaica, seeking to remove an unsustainable venture from its balance sheet.

In October 2007, Bruce Nobles, President and Chief Operational Officer of Air Jamaica from May 2002 to June 2003, was asked to return. He replaced William Rogers, who was interim President and CEO of the airline since the October 2007 resignation of CEO Michael Conway.

On 4 July 2009, &quot;The Jamaica Gleaner&quot; reported that U.S.-based Spirit Airlines had reached an agreement with the Jamaican government to acquire the national airline.

On 17 December 2009, it was reported that the Prime Minister of Jamaica had recently approached the government of Trinidad and Tobago regarding a possible merger or acquisition by Caribbean Airlines.

It was decided that Air Jamaica would cease to operate under Jamaican ownership and be primarily run by Caribbean Airlines until the transitional process was complete. Caribbean Airlines acquired the airline&#x27;s fleet and route rights on 1 May 2010, and opened a new hub at Kingston&#x27;s Norman Manley International Airport. The acquisition made Caribbean Airlines the largest airline in the Caribbean. On 27 May 2011, Jamaican Finance Minister Audley Shaw and Trinidadian Finance Minister Winston Dookeran signed the shareholding agreement, making Caribbean Airlines the national airline of Jamaica with access to all routes operated by the former Air Jamaica. On 1 July 2011, all Air Jamaica and Caribbean Airlines&#x27;s flights began operating under Caribbean Airlines&#x27;s &quot;BW&quot; IATA code.

The airline operated scheduled services from Kingston and Montego Bay to seven destinations in the Caribbean, Canada and the United States. The airline&#x27;s acquisition by Caribbean Airlines of Trinidad and Tobago was implemented on May 1, 2010. However the current owners intended to keep the name Air Jamaica for as long as they were in possession of the company.

The airline officially reopened operations on May 1, 2010, upon acquisition by Caribbean Airlines Limited. The new airline was owned by Caribbean Airlines Limited of which the government of Jamaica held 16 percent of shares. The acquisition by Caribbean Airlines also gave the company exclusive rights to the &quot;Air Jamaica&quot; name for one year, with options for annual renewal. On January 14, 2011, the Air Jamaica brand was relaunched at the Norman Manley International Airport with the unveiling of a new livery. The Boeing 737-800 aircraft, registered in Trinidad and Tobago, bore elements of Air Jamaica&#x27;s original livery along with alterations to align the corporate identity with Caribbean Airlines. Each aircraft will bear a sticker of Caribbean Airlines logo along with both Jamaican and Trinbagonian national flags.

Air Jamaica ceased all operations in 2015.

<doc id="163242" wikidata="Q6874638" url="?curid=163242" title="Mirror galvanometer">
<text>A mirror galvanometer is an ammeter that indicates it has sensed an electric current by deflecting a light beam with a mirror. The beam of light projected on a scale acts as a long massless pointer. In 1826, Johann Christian Poggendorff developed the mirror galvanometer for detecting electric currents. The apparatus is also known as a &quot;spot galvanometer&quot; after the spot of light produced in some models.

Mirror galvanometers were used extensively in scientific instruments before reliable, stable electronic amplifiers were available. The most common uses were as recording equipment for seismometers and submarine cables used for telegraphy.

In modern times, the term &quot;mirror galvanometer&quot; is also used for devices that move laser beams by rotating a mirror through a galvanometer set-up, often with a servo-like control loop. The name is often abbreviated as &quot;galvo&quot;.

== Kelvin&#x27;s galvanometer ==

The mirror galvanometer was improved significantly by William Thomson, later to become Lord Kelvin. He coined the term &quot;mirror galvanometer&quot; and patented the device in 1858. Thomson intended the instrument to read weak signal currents on very long submarine telegraph cables. This instrument was far more sensitive than any which preceded it, enabling the detection of the slightest defect in the core of a cable during its manufacture and submersion. 

Thomson decided that he needed an extremely sensitive instrument after he took part in the failed attempt to lay a transatlantic telegraph cable in 1857. He worked on the device while waiting for a new expedition the following year. He first looked at improving a galvanometer used by Hermann von Helmholtz to measure the speed of nerve signals in 1849. Helmholtz&#x27;s galvanometer had a mirror fixed to the moving needle, which was used to project a beam of light onto the opposite wall, thus greatly amplifying the signal. Thomson intended to make this more sensitive by reducing the mass of the moving parts, but in a flash of inspiration while watching the light reflected from his monocle suspended around his neck, he realised that he could dispense with the needle and its mounting altogether. He instead used a small piece of mirrored glass with a small piece of magnetised steel glued on the back. This was suspended by a thread in the magnetic field of the fixed sensing coil. In a hurry to try the idea, Thomson first used a hair from his dog, but later used a silk thread from the dress of his niece Agnes.

The following is adapted from a contemporary account of Thomson&#x27;s instrument:

== Moving coil galvanometer ==
Moving coil galvanometer was developed independently by Marcel Deprez and Jacques-Arsène d&#x27;Arsonval about 1880. Deprez&#x27;s galvanometer was developed for high currents, while D&#x27;Arsonval designed his to measure weak currents. Unlike in the Kelvin&#x27;s galvanometer, in this type of galvanometer the magnet is stationary and the coil is suspended in the magnet gap. The mirror attached to the coil frame rotates together with it. This form of instrument can be more sensitive and accurate and it replaced the Kelvin&#x27;s galvanometer in most applications. The moving coil galvanometer is practically immune to ambient magnetic fields. Another important feature is self-damping generated by the electro-magnetic forces due to the currents induced in the coil by its movements the magnetic field. These are proportional to the angular velocity of the coil.

== Modern uses ==

In modern times, high-speed mirror galvanometers are employed in laser light shows to move the laser beams and produce colorful geometric patterns in fog around the audience. Such high speed mirror galvanometers have proved to be indispensable in industry for laser marking systems for everything from laser etching hand tools, containers, and parts to batch-coding semiconductor wafers in semiconductor device fabrication. They typically control X and Y directions on and CO2 laser markers to control the position of the infrared power laser spot. Laser ablation, laser beam machining and wafer dicing are all industrial areas where high-speed mirror galvanometers can be found.

This moving coil galvanometer is mainly used to measure very feeble or low currents of order 10−9 A.

To linearise the magnetic field across the coil throughout the galvanometer&#x27;s range of movement, the d&#x27;Arsonval design of a soft iron cylinder is placed inside the coil without touching it. This gives a consistent radial field, rather than a parallel linear field.

<doc id="163246" wikidata="Q1048856" url="?curid=163246" title="All in the Family">
<text>All in the Family is an American sitcom television series that aired on CBS for nine seasons from January 12, 1971, to April 8, 1979, with a total of 205 episodes. It was later produced as &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;, a continuation series, which picked up where &quot;All in the Family&quot; ended and ran for four seasons through April 4, 1983.

Based on the British sitcom &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;, &quot;All in the Family&quot; was produced by Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin. It starred Carroll O&#x27;Connor, Jean Stapleton, Sally Struthers, and Rob Reiner. The show revolves around the life of a working-class man and his family. It broke ground by introducing challenging and complex issues into mainstream network television comedy: racism, antisemitism, infidelity, homosexuality, women&#x27;s liberation, rape, religion, miscarriage, abortion, breast cancer, the Vietnam War, menopause, and impotence. The series became arguably one of television&#x27;s most influential comedies, as it injected the sitcom format with more dramatic moments and realistic, topical conflicts.

&quot;All in the Family&quot; has been ranked as one of the best American television series. The show became the most watched show in the United States during summer reruns of the first season and topped the yearly Nielsen ratings from 1971 to 1976, the first television series to have held the position for five consecutive years. The episode &quot;Sammy&#x27;s Visit&quot; was ranked number 13 on &quot;TV Guide&#x27;s&quot; 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. &quot;TV Guide&#x27;s &quot;50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time ranked &quot;All in the Family&quot; as number four. &quot;Bravo&quot; also named the show&#x27;s protagonist, Archie Bunker, TV&#x27;s greatest character of all time. In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked &quot;All in the Family&quot; the fourth-best written TV series In 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; ranked &quot;All in the Family&quot; number 16 on its list of the 100 greatest TV shows.

==Premise==
&quot;All in the Family&quot; centers on a working-class White American family living in Queens, New York. Its patriarch, Archie Bunker (O&#x27;Connor), is an outspoken, narrow-minded man, seemingly prejudiced against everyone not like him or not holding his ideas of how people should be. Archie&#x27;s wife, Edith (Jean Stapleton), is sweet and understanding, which can make her appear naive and uneducated. Her husband often treats her dismissively and uses disparaging language, calling her &quot;dingbat.&quot;

Their one child, Gloria (Sally Struthers), is generally kind and good-natured like her mother but displays traces of her father&#x27;s stubbornness and temper. Unlike them, she is a feminist. Gloria is married to college student, later graduate student, later college instructor Michael Stivic (Reiner)–referred to as &quot;Meathead&quot; by Archie–whose values are likewise influenced and shaped by the counterculture of the 1960s. The two couples represent the real-life clash of values between the Greatest Generation and Baby Boomers. For much of the series, the Stivics live in the Bunkers&#x27; home to save money, providing abundant opportunity for the family members to irritate one another.

The show is set in the Astoria section of Queens, with the vast majority of scenes taking place in the Bunkers&#x27; home at 704 Hauser Street. Occasional scenes take place in other locations, especially during later seasons, such as Kelsey&#x27;s Bar, a neighborhood tavern that Archie spends a good deal of time at and eventually purchases, and the Stivics&#x27; home after Mike and Gloria move out.

Supporting characters represent the changing demographics of the neighborhood, especially the Jeffersons, a Black family, who live in the house next door in the early seasons and then leave the area for the higher-end Upper East Side of Manhattan after George (the husband) makes a fortune through his dry cleaning business. The Jeffersons then rented their home to Gloria and Mike.

==Cast==

===Main characters===
* Carroll O&#x27;Connor as Archie Bunker: Frequently called a &quot;lovable bigot,&quot; Archie was an assertively prejudiced blue-collar worker. A World War II veteran, Archie longs for better times when people sharing his viewpoint were in charge, as evidenced by the nostalgic theme song &quot;Those Were the Days,&quot; also the show&#x27;s original title. Despite his bigotry, he is portrayed as loving and decent, as well as a man who is simply struggling to adapt to the constantly changing world, rather than someone motivated by hateful racism or prejudice. His ignorance and stubbornness seem to cause his malapropism-filled arguments to self-destruct. He often rejects uncomfortable truths by blowing a raspberry. Former child actor Mickey Rooney was Lear&#x27;s first choice to play Archie, but Rooney declined the offer because of the strong potential for controversy and, in Rooney&#x27;s opinion, its poor chance for success. 
* Jean Stapleton as Edith Bunker, née Baines: Edith is Archie&#x27;s ditzy but kind-hearted wife. Archie often tells her to &quot;stifle&quot; herself and calls her a &quot;dingbat,&quot; and although Edith generally defers to her husband&#x27;s authority and endures his insults, on the rare occasions when Edith takes a stand, she proves to exhibit simple but profound wisdom. Despite their different personalities, they love each other deeply. Stapleton developed Edith&#x27;s distinctive voice. Stapleton remained with the show through the original series run but decided to leave at that time. During the first season of &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place,&quot; Edith was seen in five of the first fourteen episodes in guest appearances. After being set forth largely as an invisible character, Edith got written out as having suffered a stroke and died off camera in the following season, leaving Archie to deal with the death of his beloved &quot;dingbat.&quot; Stapleton appeared in all but four episodes of &quot;All in the Family&quot;. In the series&#x27; first episode, Edith is portrayed as being less of a dingbat and even sarcastically refers to her husband as &quot;Mr. Religion here ...&quot; after they come home from church—something her character would not be expected to say later. 
* Sally Struthers as Gloria Stivic, née Bunker: The Bunkers&#x27; college-age daughter is married to Michael Stivic. She has the generally kind nature of her mother but also the stubbornness of her father, which early in the series manifests as childishness and later as a more mature feminism. Gloria frequently attempts to mediate between her father and her husband, generally siding with the latter. The roles of the Bunkers&#x27; daughter and son-in-law (then named &quot;Dickie&quot;) initially went to Candice Azzara and Chip Oliver. After seeing the show&#x27;s pilot, ABC requested a second pilot after expressing dissatisfaction with both actors. Lear later recast the roles of Gloria and Dickie with Struthers and Reiner. Penny Marshall, Reiner&#x27;s wife, whom he married in April 1971 shortly after the program began, was considered for the role of Gloria. During early seasons of the show, Struthers was known to feel discontented with how static her part was, and in 1974, she sued to get out of her contract, but the character became more developed, thereby satisfying her. Struthers appeared in 157 of the 202 episodes during the first eight seasons—from January 12, 1971, to March 19, 1978. She later reprised the role in the spin-off series &quot;Gloria&quot;, which lasted one season in 1982–1983.
* Rob Reiner as Michael &quot;Meathead&quot; Stivic: Gloria&#x27;s Polish-American hippie husband is part of the counterculture of the 1960s. While good-hearted and well-meaning, he constantly spars with Archie and is equally stubborn, although his moral views are generally presented as more ethical and his logic somewhat sounder. He is the most-educated person in the household, which gives him a self-assured arrogance, and despite his intellectual belief in progressive social values, he tends to expect Gloria to defer to him as her husband. As discussed in &quot;All in the Family&quot; retrospectives, Richard Dreyfuss sought the part, but Norman Lear ultimately cast Reiner. Harrison Ford turned down the role, citing Archie Bunker&#x27;s bigotry. Reiner appeared in 174 of the 202 episodes of the series during the first eight seasons—from January 12, 1971, to March 19, 1978. Reiner is credited with writing three of the series&#x27; episodes.
* Danielle Brisebois as Stephanie Mills, nine-year-old daughter of Edith&#x27;s cousin Floyd and a regular throughout the ninth season. In addition to being thought cute and having a sweet side, she is smart and clever and makes her own remarks to Archie from time to time. The Bunkers take her in after her father abandons her on their doorstep in 1978. Her father later extorts money from the Bunkers to let them keep her. She remained with the show through its transition to &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; and appeared in all four seasons of the continuation.

===Supporting characters===

* Sherman Hemsley as George Jefferson, Isabel Sanford as his wife, Louise, and Mike Evans as their son, Lionel, Archie&#x27;s Black neighbors: George is Archie&#x27;s combative Black counterpart; Louise is a smarter, more assertive version of Edith. Lionel first appeared in the series&#x27; premiere episode &quot;Meet the Bunkers&quot;; Louise appeared later in the first season. Although George had been mentioned many times, he was not seen until 1973. Hemsley, who was Norman Lear&#x27;s first choice to play George, was performing in the Broadway musical &quot;Purlie&quot; and did not want to break his commitment to that show. Lear kept the role waiting for him until he finished with the musical. Plots frequently found Archie and George at odds with each other while Edith and Louise attempted to join forces to bring about resolutions. George and Louise later moved to an apartment in Manhattan in their own show, &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;. Lionel appeared in &quot;All in the Family&quot; as a college student and aspiring electrical engineer who early on did odd jobs around the neighborhood, including television and radio repair. 
* Mel Stewart as George&#x27;s brother Henry Jefferson: The two appeared together only once, in a 1973 episode in which the Bunkers host Henry&#x27;s going-away party, marking Stewart&#x27;s final episode and Hemsley&#x27;s first. After the Jeffersons were spun off into their own show in 1975, Stewart&#x27;s character was rarely referred to again and was never seen. In the closing credits of &quot;The First and Last Supper&quot; episode, Mel Stewart is incorrectly credited as playing George Jefferson. Stewart was actually playing George&#x27;s brother Henry Jefferson, who was pretending to be George for most of the episode. (Season 1–4, 8 episodes)
* Bea Arthur as Edith&#x27;s cousin Maude: Maude was white-collared and ultraliberal, the perfect foil to Archie, and one of his main antagonists. She appeared in two episodes: &quot;Cousin Maude&#x27;s Visit&quot;, in which she took care of the Bunker household when all four were sick, and &quot;Maude&quot; from the show&#x27;s second season, which was basically a backdoor pilot. Her spin-off series, &quot;Maude&quot;, began in fall 1972. (Season 2, 2 episodes)
* Betty Garrett and Vincent Gardenia as liberal Roman Catholic next-door neighbors Irene and Frank Lorenzo: Both first appeared as a married couple as Irene was trying to use the Bunkers&#x27; phone. During an argument earlier in the episode, Archie and Mike had broken the phone wire. Irene being a &quot;handyman&quot; of sorts with her own tools, which she carried in her purse, fixed it. Irene fixed many things at the Bunker house during her time on the show. She also had a sister who was a nun and appeared in one episode. &quot;Edith&#x27;s Christmas Story&quot; reveals that Irene has had a mastectomy. Archie got her a job as a forklift operator at the plant where he worked. Irene was a strong-willed woman of Irish heritage, and Frank was a jovial Italian househusband who loved cooking and singing. He also was a salesman, but what he sold was never mentioned. Gardenia, who also appeared as Jim Bowman in episode eight of season one (as the man who sold his house to the Jeffersons) and as Curtis Rempley in episode seven of season three (as a swinger opposite Rue McClanahan), became a semiregular along with Garrett in 1973. Gardenia stayed for only one season as Frank Lorenzo, but Garrett remained until her character was phased-out in late 1975. (Season 4–6)
* Allan Melvin as Archie&#x27;s neighbor and good friend Barney Hefner: Barney first appeared in 1972 as a recurring character. His appearances increased during subsequent seasons until he became a regular. He appeared as a regular in all four seasons of &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;. Melvin also appeared in first-season episode &quot;Archie in the Lock-up&quot; as a desk sergeant at a police precinct.

===Recurring characters===
* James Cromwell as Jerome &quot;Stretch&quot; Cunningham (1973–1976) &quot;The Funniest Man in The World&quot;, Archie&#x27;s friend and co-worker from the loading dock (Archie claims that he is known as the &quot;Bob Hope&quot; of the loading platform): What Archie did not know was that Stretch was Jewish, evident only after Stretch died and Archie went to the funeral. Archie&#x27;s eulogy (or &quot;urology&quot; as he called it) for his friend is often referred to as a rare occasion when he was capable of showing the humanity he tried so earnestly to hide. In the episode titled &quot;Archie in the Cellar&quot;, Billy Sands is referred to as Stretch Cunningham, the voice on the tape recorder telling jokes. Sands also appeared as other characters on the show during its run, in Kelsey&#x27;s Bar as a patron. (Season 5, 3 episodes)
* Liz Torres as Theresa Betancourt (1976–1977): A Puerto Rican nursing student who meets Archie when he is admitted to the hospital for surgery. She later rents Mike and Gloria&#x27;s former room at the Bunker house. She called Archie &quot;Papi&quot;. Torres joined &quot;All in the Family&quot; in the fall of 1976, but her character was not popular with viewers, and the role was phased out before the end of the season. (Season 7, 7 episodes)
* Billy Halop as Mr. Munson (1971–76), the cab driver who lets Archie drive his cab to make extra money. (Season 1–3 &amp; 5–6, 10 episodes)
* Bob Hastings as Kelcy or Tommy Kelsey, who owns the bar Archie frequents and later buys: Kelcy was also played by Frank Maxwell in the episode &quot;Archie Gets The Business&quot;. The name of the establishment is Kelcy&#x27;s Bar (as seen in the bar window in various episodes). Due to a continuity error, the end credits of episodes involving the bar owner spell the name &quot;Kelcy&quot; for the first two seasons and &quot;Kelsey&quot; thereafter, although the end credits show &quot;Kelcy&quot; in the &quot;Archie Gets the Business&quot; episode.
* Jason Wingreen as Harry Snowden, a bartender at Kelcy&#x27;s Bar who continues to work there after Archie purchases it as his business partner: Harry had tried to buy the bar from Kelcy, but Archie was able to come up with the money first, by taking a mortgage out on his house, which the Bunkers owned outright.
* Gloria LeRoy as Mildred &quot;Boom-Boom&quot; Turner, a buxom, middle-aged secretary at the plant where Archie works: Her first appearance was when Archie is lost on his way to a convention and Mike and Gloria suspect he and she could be having an affair. Archie gave her that moniker as she was walking by the loading dock. He said when she walked, &quot;Boom-Boom&quot;. She is not fond of Archie because he and Stretch leer at her and because of their sexist behavior, but later becomes friendly with him, occasionally working as a barmaid at Archie&#x27;s Place. Gloria LeRoy also appeared in a third-season episode as &quot;Bobbi Jo&quot; Loomis, the wife of Archie&#x27;s old war buddy &quot;Duke&quot;.
* Barnard Hughes as Father John Majeski, a local Catholic priest who was suspected by Archie one time of trying to convert Edith: He appeared in multiple episodes. The first time was when Edith accidentally hit Majeski&#x27;s car near the local supermarket with a can of cling peaches in heavy syrup. (Season 2,3 &amp; 4, 3 episodes)
* Eugene Roche appeared as practical jokester friend and fellow lodge member &quot;Pinky Peterson&quot;, one of Archie Bunker&#x27;s buddies, in three episodes, first in the episode &quot;Beverly Rides Again&quot;, then the memorable Christmas Day episode called &quot;The Draft Dodger&quot; (episode 146, 1976), and finally the episode &quot;Archie&#x27;s Other Wife&quot;. (Season 7 &amp; 9, 3 episodes)
* Sorrell Booke as Lyle Sanders, personnel manager at Archie Bunker&#x27;s workplace, Prendergast Tool and Die Company. He had appeared on the series as Lyle Bennett, the manager of a local television station, in the episode &quot;Archie and the Editorial&quot; in season three.
* Lori Shannon played Beverly La Salle, a transvestite entertainer, who appeared in three episodes: &quot;Archie the Hero&quot;, &quot;Beverly Rides Again&quot;, and &quot;Edith&#x27;s Crisis of Faith&quot;. In that third episode, Mike and Beverly are attacked, and Beverly dies in a hospital from injuries suffered during the fight.
* Estelle Parsons as Blanche Hefner (1977–1979), Barney&#x27;s second wife: Blanche and Archie are not fond of one another, though Edith likes her very much. The character is mentioned throughout much of the series after Barney&#x27;s first wife, Mabel, had died, though she only appeared in a handful of episodes during the last few seasons. Estelle Parsons also appeared in the season-seven episode &quot;Archie&#x27;s Secret Passion&quot; as Dolores Fencel. (Season 7 &amp; 9)
* Bill Quinn as Mr. Edgar van Ranseleer (Mr. van R), a blind patron and regular at the bar: He was almost never referred to by his first name. In a running joke, Archie usually waves his hand in front of Mr. van R&#x27;s face when he speaks to him. His role was later expanded on &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;, where he appeared in all four seasons.
* Burt Mustin as Justin Quigley, a feisty octogenarian/nonagenarian: Mr. Quigley first appeared in the episode: &quot;Edith Finds an Old Man&quot; (season four, episode three, September 23, 1973) where he runs away from an old age home. He temporarily moves in with the Bunkers but quickly leaves to share an apartment with his friend Josephine &quot;Jo&quot; Nelson, played by Ruth McDevitt. He appeared in several other episodes, including &quot;Archie&#x27;s Weighty Problem&quot;. Mr. Mustin previously appeared in a first-season episode as Harry Feeney, the night watchman at Archie&#x27;s workplace. (1, 4–6, 5 episodes)
* Nedra Volz as Aunt Iola, Edith&#x27;s aunt. She was mentioned several times in the eighth season and stayed with the Bunkers for two weeks. Edith wanted her to move in, but Archie would not allow it, though when he thought Iola did not have any place to go, he told her privately that she could always stay with them.
* Francine Beers and Jane Connell as Sybil Gooley, who worked at Ferguson&#x27;s Market: Frequently mentioned, usually by Edith, Sybil predicted that Gloria and Mike were having a baby boy by performing a ring on a string &quot;swing test&quot; over Gloria&#x27;s abdomen. Sybil also appeared in the episode &quot;Edith&#x27;s 50th Birthday&quot; and spilled the beans on her surprise party because she had not been invited. Archie and she did not get along, and he referred to her as a &quot;Big Mouth&quot;.
* Rae Allen and Elizabeth Wilson as Edith&#x27;s cousin Amelia DeKuyper: Archie detests Amelia and her husband, Russell, who are wealthy. Once, she sent Edith a mink and Archie wanted to send it back, until he found out how much it was worth. In another episode, Amelia and her husband visit the Bunkers to bring them gifts from a recent trip to Hawaii, but in a private moment, Amelia shares with Edith that, despite appearances, she and Russell are considering a divorce. The character was played by two different actresses in three episodes of the show.
* Richard Dysart and George S. Irving as Russell DeKuyper, Amelia&#x27;s husband. He is a plumbing contractor who continued the business started by Amelia&#x27;s father and uncles. He constantly flaunts his monetary wealth in front of Archie and looks askance at the way Archie lives, forgetting that he walked into a profitable plumbing business. He appeared in two of the episodes that featured Amelia.
* Clyde Kusatsu as Reverend Chong appeared in three episodes. He refused to baptize little Joey in season six, and then remarried Archie and Edith, and Mike and Gloria in season eight, and gave counsel to Stephanie in season nine as it was learned that she was Jewish. (Season 6, 8 &amp; 9, 3 episodes)
* Ruth McDevitt as Josephine &quot;Jo&quot; Nelson: She played the girlfriend of Justin Quigley, the older man Edith found walking around the supermarket. She appeared in three episodes from seasons four through six. Gloria and Mike adopted them as their god grandparents. Of most of the characters, Archie took a liking to Justin and Jo. She died following the end of the sixth season. (Season 4 &amp; 5, 3 episodes)
* William Benedict as Jimmy McNabb: The Bunkers&#x27; neighbor, he appeared in two episodes during the first and second seasons and was referred to many times during the first few seasons.
* Jack Grimes as Mr. Whitehead: A member of Archie&#x27;s lodge, he was the local funeral director. The death of Archie&#x27;s cousin Oscar in a season-two episode of &quot;All in the Family&quot; brings the very short, white-haired, and silver-tongued Whitehead with his catalog of caskets. (Season 2 &amp; 4, 2 episodes)

==History and production==

Lear said the idea for &quot;All in the Family&quot; came to him after read an article in &quot;Variety&quot; magazine on the successful British sitcom &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;. He said he immediately knew it portrayed a relationship just like the one between his father and himself. However, in a 2025 episode of the podcast &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About That!,&quot; Struthers disputed that claim, saying that idea originated with O&#x27;Connor, who had seen &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; during a visit to the U.K&quot;.&quot; O&#x27;Connor, she said, wanted to produce an American version but couldn&#x27;t get the necessary backing as an actor alone. Eventually he got the idea to Lear who backed it and put it into production without crediting O&#x27;Connor. She said she waited until after Lear died to share what she knew.

Lear bought the rights to the show and incorporated his own family experiences with his father into the show. Lear&#x27;s father would tell Lear&#x27;s mother to &quot;stifle herself&quot; and she would tell Lear&#x27;s father &quot;you are the laziest white man I ever saw&quot; (two &quot;Archieisms&quot; that found their way onto the show).

The original pilot was titled &quot;Justice for All&quot; and was developed for ABC. Tom Bosley, Jack Warden, and Jackie Gleason were all considered for the role of Archie Bunker. In fact, CBS wanted to buy the rights to the original show and retool it specifically for Gleason, who was under contract to them, but producer Lear beat out CBS for the rights and offered the show to ABC. Mickey Rooney was offered the role but turned it down as he felt the character was &quot;un-American&quot;.

In the pilot, Carroll O&#x27;Connor and Jean Stapleton played Archie and Edith Justice. Kelly Jean Peters played Gloria and Tim McIntire played her husband, Richard. It was taped in October 1968 in New York City. After screening the first pilot, ABC gave the producers more money to shoot a second pilot, titled &quot;Those Were the Days&quot;, which Lear taped in February 1969 in Hollywood. Candice Azzara played Gloria and Chip Oliver played her husband Dickie. D&#x27;Urville Martin played Lionel Jefferson in both pilots.

After stations&#x27; and viewers&#x27; complaints caused ABC to cancel &quot;Turn-On&quot; (a sketch comedy series developed by &quot;Laugh-In&quot;&#x27;s George Schlatter) after only one episode in February 1969, the network became uneasy about airing a show with a &quot;foul-mouthed, bigoted lead&quot; character, and rejected the series at about the time Richard Dreyfuss sought the role of Michael. Rival network CBS was eager to update its image and was looking to replace much of its then popular &quot;rural&quot; programming (&quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot;, &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; and &quot;Green Acres&quot;) with more &quot;urban&quot;, contemporary series and was interested in Lear&#x27;s project; by this point, Gleason was no longer under contract to CBS (his own show was among those eliminated), allowing Lear to keep Carroll O&#x27;Connor on as the lead. CBS bought the rights from ABC and retitled the show &quot;All in the Family&quot;. The pilot episode CBS developed had the final cast and was the series&#x27; first episode.

Lear wanted to shoot in black and white as &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; had been. While CBS insisted on color, Lear had the set furnished in neutral tones, keeping everything relatively devoid of color. As costume designer Rita Riggs described in her 2001 Archive of American Television interview, Lear&#x27;s idea was to create the feeling of sepia tones, in an attempt to make viewers feel as if they were looking at an old family album.

&quot;All in the Family&quot; was the first major American series to be videotaped in front of a live studio audience. In the 1960s, most sitcoms had been filmed in the single-camera format without audiences, with a laugh track simulating an audience response, with videotape at that time mainly reserved for news programming and variety shows. Lear employed the multiple-camera format of shooting in front of an audience, but used tape, whereas previous multiple-camera shows like &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; had used film. Due to the success of &quot;All in the Family&quot;, videotaping sitcoms in front of an audience became a common format for the genre during the 1970s, onward, until the advent of digital HD. The use of videotape also gave &quot;All in the Family&quot; the look and feel of early live television, including the original live broadcasts of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, to which &quot;All in the Family&quot; is sometimes compared.

For the show&#x27;s final season, the practice of being taped before a live audience changed to playing the already taped and edited show to an audience and recording their laughter to add to the original sound track, and the voice-over during the end credits were changed from Rob Reiner&#x27;s voice &quot;&quot;All in the Family&quot; was recorded on tape before a live audience.&quot; to Carroll O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s&quot;&quot;All in the Family&quot; was played to a studio audience for live responses.&quot; (typically, the audience was gathered for a taping of &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, and got to see &quot;All in the Family&quot; as a bonus.). Throughout its run, Norman Lear took pride in the fact that canned laughter was never used (mentioning this on many occasions); the laughter heard in the episodes was genuine.

===Theme song===

The series&#x27; opening theme song &quot;Those Were the Days&quot;, was written by Lee Adams (lyrics) and Charles Strouse (music). It was presented in a way that was unique for a 1970s series: Carroll O&#x27;Connor and Jean Stapleton were seated at a console or spinet piano (played by Stapleton) and sang the tune together on-camera at the start of every episode, concluding with applause from a studio audience. The song dates back to the first &quot;Justice For All&quot; pilot filmed in 1968, although on that occasion O&#x27;Connor and Stapleton performed the song off-camera and at a faster tempo than the series version.

Six different performances were recorded over the run of the series, including one version that includes additional lyrics. The song is a simple, pentatonic melody, that can be played exclusively with black keys on a piano, in which Archie and Edith were nostalgic for the simpler days of the past. A longer version of the song was released as a single on Atlantic Records, reaching number 43 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart in early 1972. The additional lyrics in this longer version lend the song a greater sense of sadness and make poignant reference to social changes taking place in the 1960s and early 1970s.

A few perceptible drifts can be observed when listening to each version chronologically. In the original version, the lyric &quot;Those Were The Days&quot; was sung over the tonic (root chord of the song&#x27;s key), and the piano strikes a dominant 7th passing chord in transition to the next part, which is absent from subsequent versions.

Jean Stapleton originally struck a slightly sour note (deliberately) on the word &quot;were&quot; in the phrase &quot;and you knew who you were then,&quot; which prompted laughter from the live audience; as the seasons progressed, she delivered this note as an increasingly exaggerated shriek. Carroll O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s pronunciation of &quot;welfare state&quot; added more of Archie&#x27;s trademark whining enunciation, and the closing lyrics (especially &quot;Gee, our old LaSalle ran great&quot;) were sung with increasingly deliberate articulation, as viewers had complained that they could not understand the words. Also in the original version, the camera angle was shot slightly from the right side of the talent as opposed to the straight on angle of the next version. Jean Stapleton performed the theme song without glasses beginning in season 6.

In addition to O&#x27;Connor and Stapleton singing, footage is also shown beginning with aerial shots of Manhattan, and continuing to Queens, progressively zooming in, culminating with a still shot of a lower middle-class semidetached home, presumably representing the Bunkers&#x27; house in Astoria, suggesting that the visit to the Bunkers&#x27; home has begun. The house shown in the opening credits is actually located at 89–70 Cooper Avenue in the Glendale section of Queens, New York.

A notable difference exists, between the Cooper Avenue house and the &quot;All in the Family&quot; set: the Cooper Avenue house has no porch, while the Bunkers&#x27; home featured a front porch. Since the footage used for the opening had been shot back in 1968 for the series&#x27; first pilot, the establishing shot of the Manhattan skyline was completely devoid of the World Trade Center towers, which had not yet been built. When the series aired two years later, the Trade Center towers, although under construction, had still not yet risen high enough to become a prominent feature on the Manhattan skyline. This did not happen until the end of 1971.

Despite this change in the Manhattan skyline, the original, somewhat grainy 1968 footage continued to be used for the series opening until the series transitioned into &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; in 1979. At that time, a new opening with current shots of the Manhattan skyline were used with the Trade Center towers being seen in the closing credits. This opening format – showing actual footage of the cities and neighborhoods in which the show was set – became the standard for most of Norman Lear&#x27;s sitcoms, including others in the &quot;All in the Family&quot; franchise – &quot;Maude&quot;, &quot;Good Times&quot;, and &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;.

At the end of the opening, the camera then returns to a last few seconds of O&#x27;Connor and Stapleton, as they finish the song. At the end of the original version, Edith smiles at Archie and Archie smiles off at a slight distance. In the longest running version (from season 2 to season 5), Edith smiles blissfully at Archie, and Archie puts a cigar in his mouth and returns a rather cynical, sheepish look to Edith. From season six through eight, Edith smiles and rests her chin on Archie&#x27;s shoulder.

In the final season, Edith hugs Archie at the conclusion. In the first three versions of the opening, Archie is seen wearing his classic trademark white shirt. In the final version of the opening for the series&#x27; ninth season, Archie is seen wearing a gray sweater-jacket over his white shirt. In all versions of the opening, the song&#x27;s conclusion is accompanied by applause from the studio audience.

In interviews, Norman Lear explained that the idea for the piano song introduction was a cost-cutting measure. After completion of the pilot episode, the budget would not allow an elaborate scene to serve as the sequence played during the show&#x27;s opening credits. Lear decided to have a simple scene of Archie and Edith singing at the piano.

The closing theme, an instrumental, was &quot;Remembering You&quot;, played by its composer Roger Kellaway, with lyrics later added by Carroll O&#x27;Connor. It was played over footage of the same row of houses in Queens as in the opening, but moving in the opposite direction down the street, and eventually moving back to aerial shots of Manhattan, suggesting the visit to the Bunkers&#x27; home has concluded. O&#x27;Connor recorded a vocal version of &quot;Remembering You&quot; for a record album, but though he performed it several times on TV appearances, the lyrics about the end of a romance were never heard in the actual series. In July 1986, vocalist Helen Merrill&#x27;s contrastingly jazz-flavored rendition, accompanied by a Kellaway-led trio and introduced by O&#x27;Connor, was featured on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;.

Except for some brief instances in the first season, scenes contained no background or transitional music.

===Setting and location===

Lear and his writers set the series in the Queens neighborhood of Astoria. The location of the Bunkers&#x27; house at 704 Hauser Street is fictitious. No Hauser Street exists in Queens. The address is not presented the way addresses are given in Queens: most address numbers are hyphenated, identifying the number of the nearest cross street. Nevertheless, many episodes reveal that the Bunkers live near the major thoroughfare Northern Boulevard, which was the location of Kelsey&#x27;s Bar and later Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place.

The exterior of the house shown at the show closing is a home located at 89-70 Cooper Avenue, Glendale, Queens, New York, across from St. John Cemetery ().

Many real Queens institutions are mentioned throughout the series. Carroll O&#x27;Connor, a Queens native from Forest Hills, said in an interview with the Archive of American Television that he suggested to the writers many of the locations to give the series authenticity. For example, Archie is said to have attended Flushing High School, a real school in Flushing, Queens, although in the &quot;Man of the Year&quot; episode of &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;, Archie attended Bryant High School in nearby Long Island City. As another example, the 1976 episode &quot;The Baby Contest&quot; deals with Archie entering baby Joey in a cutest-baby contest sponsored by the &quot;Long Island Daily Press&quot;, a then-operating local newspaper in Queens and Long Island.

The writers of &quot;All in the Family&quot; continued throughout the series to have the Bunkers and other characters use telephone exchange names when giving a telephone number. Most other series at the time, such as &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, were using the standard fictitious 555 telephone exchange at a time when the Bell System was trying to discontinue them. At different times throughout the series, the exchanges &quot;Ravenswood&quot; and &quot;Bayside&quot; – both valid in the area – were used for the Bunkers&#x27; telephone number. Actual residents of the Bunkers&#x27; age continued using exchange names into the early 1980s, which is referred to in the 1979 episode &quot;The Appendectomy&quot;, in which Edith gets confused between the two versions of a number she is dialing.

==Episodes==

&quot;Sammy&#x27;s Visit&quot;, first broadcast in February 1972, is a particularly notable episode, whose famous episode-ending scene produced the longest sustained audience laughter in the history of the show. Guest star Sammy Davis Jr. plays himself. Archie is moonlighting as a cab driver and Davis visits the Bunker home to retrieve a briefcase he left in Archie&#x27;s cab earlier that day. After hearing Archie&#x27;s bigoted remarks, Davis asks for a photograph with him. At the moment the picture is taken, Davis suddenly kisses a stunned Archie on the cheek. The ensuing laughter went on for so long that it had to be severely edited for network broadcast, as Carroll O&#x27;Connor still had one line (&quot;Well, what the hell — he said it was in his contract!&quot;) to deliver after the kiss. (The line is usually cut in syndication.)

===Syndication===
During the show&#x27;s sixth season, starting on December 1, 1975, CBS began airing reruns on weekdays at 3p.m. (EST), replacing long-running soap opera &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, which moved to ABC. The show would later move to 3:30p.m. and in September 1978, 10a.m. This lasted until September 1979, when Viacom distributed the reruns to the off-network market where many stations picked up the show. In 1991, Columbia Pictures Television began syndicating the show, and Columbia&#x27;s successor companies have continued to do so.

Since the late 1980s, &quot;All in the Family&quot; has been rerun on various cable and satellite networks including TBS (although it held the rights locally in Atlanta, as well), TV Land, Nick at Nite, and Sundance TV. From January 3, 2011, to December 31, 2017, the show aired on Antenna TV. As of January 1, 2018, the show began to air on GetTV. Since February 5, 2023, MeTV aired episodes of the show on Sunday nights at 8:00 pm ET/7:00 pm CT. All episodes have been airing nightly on the Catchy Comedy (formerly Decades) digital retro TV network.

The cast forfeited their residual rights for a cash payout early in the production run.

==Ratings==
&quot;All in the Family&quot; is one of three television shows (&quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and the reality music competition &quot;American Idol&quot; being the others) that have been number one in the Nielsen ratings for five consecutive TV seasons. The show remained in the top 10 for seven of its nine seasons.
The series finale was seen by 40.2 million viewers.

==Spin-offs==
, &quot;All in the Family&quot; has the most spin-offs for a US prime-time television series, directly spawning five other shows, three of which were very successful, as well as two of those spin-offs each having a spin-off of their own:

*The first spin-off was &quot;Maude&quot;, which debuted in September 1972. It features Edith&#x27;s acerbic cousin Maude Findlay (Bea Arthur), who first appeared on &quot;All in the Family&quot; in the December 1971 episode &quot;Cousin Maude&#x27;s Visit&quot;, visiting to take care of the influenza-suffering Bunkers. In March 1972, at the end of the series&#x27; second season, the character was again featured in the episode &quot;Maude&quot;. In this episode, a &quot;backdoor pilot&quot; for a new series, Archie and Edith visit her home in Westchester County to attend the wedding of her daughter Carol. Bill Macy played Maude&#x27;s husband Walter and Marcia Rodd played Carol; Rodd was replaced by Adrienne Barbeau for the series. The show lasted for six seasons and 141 episodes, airing its final episode in April 1978.
**&quot;Good Times&quot; is considered by some to be a spin-off of &quot;Maude&quot;, as the show&#x27;s focus was Florida Evans, a character first appearing on &quot;Maude&quot; during its initial seasons as the Findlays&#x27; black maid. But the character&#x27;s history and situation were changed for the new show. According to producer Allan Manings, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t really a spin-off.&quot; The show features no reference to Maude, changes the name of Florida&#x27;s husband from Henry to James, and sets the show in a Chicago housing project. It ran for six seasons from February 1974 to August 1979.
*The second and longest-lasting spin-off of &quot;All in the Family&quot; was &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;. Debuting on CBS in January 1975, &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; lasted 11 seasons and 253 episodes (more than &quot;All in the Family&#x27;s&quot; nine seasons and 208 episodes). The main characters were the Bunkers&#x27; black former next-door neighbors George and Louise Jefferson (Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford). George was the owner of seven successful dry-cleaning stores, and the series featured their life after moving from the Bunkers&#x27; working-class neighborhood to a luxury high-rise apartment building in Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side. 
**&quot;Checking In&quot; was spun off from &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, focusing on the Jeffersons&#x27; maid Florence Johnston, working as an executive housekeeper at the St. Frederick Hotel in Manhattan. It only lasted four weeks in April 1981, and the character returned to her old job as the Jeffersons&#x27; maid.
*&quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; was technically a spin-off, but was essentially a renamed continuation of the series, beginning in September 1979 following the final season of the original. It was primarily set in the titular neighborhood tavern which Archie Bunker purchased in the eighth season of &quot;All in the Family&quot;. It aired for four seasons, until April 1983.
*&quot;Gloria&quot; was the third spin-off of &quot;All in the Family&quot;, focusing on now-divorced Gloria, starting a new life as an assistant trainee to a couple of veterinarians in Foxridge, New York. It premiered in September 1982, and ran for one season.
*&quot;704 Hauser&quot; features the Bunkers&#x27; house with a new family, the Cumberbatches. It was an inversion of the formula of the original, featuring a liberal black couple with a conservative son, who is dating a Jewish woman. Gloria and Mike&#x27;s son Joey Stivic, now in his 20s, makes a brief appearance in the first episode. Five episodes aired in April and May 1994. The sixth episode was unaired.

== Specials ==

At the height of the show&#x27;s popularity, Henry Fonda hosted a special one-hour retrospective of &quot;All in the Family&quot; and its impact on American television. It included clips from the show&#x27;s most memorable episodes up to that time. It was titled &quot;The Best of &quot;All in the Family&quot;&quot; and aired on December 21, 1974.

On February 16, 1991, CBS aired a 90-minute retrospective, &quot;All in the Family 20th Anniversary Special&quot;, hosted by Norman Lear to commemorate the show&#x27;s 20th anniversary. It featured a compilation of clips from the show&#x27;s best moments, and interviews with the four main cast members. The special was so well received by the viewing audience CBS aired reruns of &quot;All in the Family&quot; during its summer schedule in 1991, garnering higher ratings than the new series scheduled next to it, Norman Lear&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Sunday Dinner&quot;. The latter was Lear&#x27;s return to TV series producing after a seven-year absence, and was canceled after the six-week tryout run due to being poorly received by audiences.

On May 22, 2019, ABC broadcast &quot;Live in Front of a Studio Audience: Norman Lear&#x27;s All in the Family and The Jeffersons&quot;, produced by Lear and Jimmy Kimmel and starring Woody Harrelson, Marisa Tomei, Jamie Foxx, Wanda Sykes, Ike Barinholtz, Kerry Washington and Ellie Kemper.

A second &quot;Live in Front of A Studio Audience&quot; special was announced in early November 2019 to air on Wednesday December 18, this time pairing the show with &quot;Good Times&quot;.

==Home media==
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment (formerly Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment) released the first six seasons of &quot;All in the Family&quot; on DVD in Region 1 between 2002 and 2007. No further seasons were released, because the sales figures did not match Sony&#x27;s expectations.

In June 2010, Shout! Factory announced that it had acquired the rights to the series and has since released the remaining three seasons.

In October 2012, Shout! Factory released &quot;All in the Family – The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1. The 28-disc boxed set features all 208 episodes of the series, as well as bonus features.

In February 2018, Sony released &quot;All in the Family- Seasons 1–5&quot; on DVD in Region 1. The 15-disc set features all episodes from the first five seasons.

==Cultural impact==

As one of US television&#x27;s most acclaimed and groundbreaking programs, &quot;All in the Family&quot; has been referenced or parodied in countless other forms of media. References on other sitcoms include &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and &quot;Family Guy&quot;.

Popular T-shirts, buttons, and bumper stickers showing O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s image and farcically promoting &quot;Archie Bunker for President&quot; appeared around the time of the 1972 presidential election. In 1998, &quot;All in the Family&quot; was honored on a 33-cent stamp by the USPS.

Archie and Edith Bunker&#x27;s chairs are on display in the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. The originals had been purchased by the show&#x27;s set designer for a few dollars at a local Goodwill thrift store and were given to the Smithsonian (for an exhibit on American television history) in 1978. It cost producers thousands of dollars to create replicas to replace the originals.

Then-US President Richard Nixon can be heard discussing the show (specifically the 1971 episodes &quot;Writing the President&quot; and &quot;Judging Books by Covers&quot;) on one of the infamous Watergate tapes.

Rapper Redman has made references to Archie Bunker in a few of his songs, specifically his smoking of large cigars.

&quot;Mad&quot; parodied the series in its 1973 special issue No. 11 entitled &quot;Gall in the Family Fare&quot;, which also included a free flexi-disc record so the reader could listen to the parody as they read it.

<text>Chinese names are personal names used by individuals from Greater China and other parts of the Sinophone world. Sometimes the same set of Chinese characters could be chosen as a Chinese name, a Hong Kong name, a Japanese name, a Korean name, a Malaysian Chinese name, or a Vietnamese name, but they would be spelled differently due to their varying historical pronunciation of Chinese characters.

Modern Chinese names generally have a one-character surname () that comes first, followed by a given name () which may be either one or two characters in length. In recent decades, two-character given names are much more commonly chosen; studies during the 2000s and 2010s estimated that over three-quarters of China&#x27;s population at the time had two-character given names, with the remainder almost exclusively having one character.

Prior to the 21st century, most educated Chinese men also used a courtesy name (or &quot;style name&quot;; ) by which they were known among those outside their family and closest friends. Respected artists or poets will sometimes also use a professional art name () among their social peers.

From at least the time of the Shang dynasty, the Chinese observed a number of naming taboos regulating who may or may not use a person&#x27;s given name (without being disrespectful). In general, using the given name connoted the speaker&#x27;s authority and superior position to the addressee. Peers and younger relatives were barred from speaking it. Owing to this, many historical Chinese figures—particularly emperors—used a half-dozen or more different names in different contexts and for different speakers. Those possessing names (sometimes even mere homophones) identical to the emperor&#x27;s were frequently forced to change them. The normalization of personal names after the May Fourth Movement has generally eradicated aliases such as the school name and courtesy name but traces of the old taboos remain, particularly within families.

==History==
Although some terms from the ancient Chinese naming system, such as () and (), are still used today, it used to be much more complex.

In the first half of the 1st millennium BC, during the Zhou dynasty, members of the Chinese nobility could possess up to four different namespersonal names ( ), clan names ( ), lineage names ( ), and &quot;style&quot; or &quot;courtesy&quot; names ( ) as well as up to two titles: standard titles ( ), and posthumous titles ( or ).

Commoners possessed only a personal name (), and the modern concept of a &quot;surname&quot; or &quot;family name&quot; did not yet exist at any level of society. The old lineage () and clan names () began to become &quot;family names&quot; in the modern sense and trickle down to commoners around 500 BC, during the late Spring and Autumn period, but the process took several centuries to complete, and it was not until the late Han dynasty (1st and 2nd centuries AD) that all Chinese commoners had surnames.

== Family names ==

Although there are currently over 6,000 Chinese surnames including non-Han Chinese surnames () in use in China, the colloquial expression for the &quot;Chinese people&quot; is Bǎixìng () &quot;Hundred Surnames&quot;, and a mere hundred surnames still make up over 85% of China&#x27;s 1.3 billion citizens. In fact, just the top three—Wang (), Li (), and Zhang ()—cover more than 20% of the population. This homogeneity results from the great majority of Han family names having only one character, while the small number of compound surnames is mostly restricted to minority groups. The most common compound surname still in use in ethnic Han families is Ouyang.

Chinese surnames arose from two separate prehistoric traditions: the and the (). The original were clans of royalty at the Shang court and always included the radical. The did not originate from families, but denoted fiefs, states, and titles granted or recognized by the Shang court. Apart from the Jiang () and Yao () families, the original have nearly disappeared but the terms ironically reversed their meaning. is now used to describe the surnames which replaced them, while is used to refer to maiden names.

The enormous modern clans sometimes share ancestral halls with one another, but actually consist of many different lineages gathered under a single name. As an example, the surname Ma () includes descendants of the Warring States–era bureaucrat Zhao She, descendants of his subjects in his fief of Mafu, Koreans from an unrelated confederation, and Muslims from all over western China who chose it to honor Muhammad.

Traditionally, a married woman keeps her name unchanged, without adopting her husband&#x27;s surname. A child would inherit his or her father&#x27;s surname. This is still the norm in mainland China, though the marriage law explicitly states that a child may use either parent&#x27;s surname. It is also possible, though far less common, for a child to combine both parents&#x27; surnames. Due to Western influence, the tradition of a woman changing her last name, or prepending her husband&#x27;s to her own, is reflected in some Hong Kong names and Macao names.

== Given names ==

Given names show much greater diversity than the surnames, while still being restricted almost universally to one or two syllables. Including variant forms, there are at least 106,000 individual Chinese characters, but as of 2006, in the People&#x27;s Republic of China Public Security Bureau only approximately 32,000 are supported for computer input and even fewer are in common use. Given names are chosen based on a range of factors, including possession of pleasing sound and tonal qualities, as well as bearing positive associations or a beautiful shape. Two-character &quot;&quot; may be chosen for each character&#x27;s separate meaning and qualities, but the name remains a single unit which is almost always said together even when the combination no longer &#x27;means&#x27; anything.

Today, two-character names are more common and make up more than 80% of Chinese names. However, this custom has been consistent only since the Ming dynasty. About 70% of all names were only one character long during the early Han and that rose beyond 98% after the usurping Wang Mang banned all two-character names outright. Although his Xin dynasty was short-lived, the law was not repealed until 400 years later, when northern invasions and interest in establishing lineages revived interest in such longer names. The Tang and Song saw populations with a majority of two-character names for the first time, but the Liao between them and the Yuan afterward both preferred single character names. The restoration of Han dominance under the Ming, promotion of Han culture under the Qing, and development of generation names established the current traditions.

Given names resonant of qualities which are perceived to be either masculine or feminine are frequently given, with males being linked with strength and firmness and females with beauty and flowers. It is also more common for female names to employ diminutives like &quot;Xiǎo&quot; or doubled characters in their formal names, although there are famous male examples such as Deng Xiaoping and Yo-Yo Ma. People from the countryside previously often bore names that reflect rural life—for example, Daniu (, &quot;Big Bull&quot;) and Dazhu (, &quot;Big Pole&quot;)—but such names are becoming less common.

It is also considered bad form to name a child after a famous person, although tens of thousands might happen to share a common name such as &quot;Liu Xiang&quot;. Similarly, owing to the traditional naming taboos, it is very uncommon in China to name a child directly after a relative, since such children would permit junior family members to inappropriately use the personal names of senior ones. Ancestors can leave a different kind of mark: Chinese naming schemes often employ a generation name. Every child recorded into the family records in each generation would share an identical character in their names. Sixteen, thirty-two, or more generations would be worked out in advance to form a generation poem. For example, the one selected in 1737 for the family of Mao Zedong read:

:::: &quot;Stand tall &amp; display unstintingly before gentlemen,&quot;
:::: &quot;And study &amp; method will expand the borders of our fortune&quot;.
:::: &quot;Ancestral favors bequeath kindness through the ages,&quot;
:::: &quot;Descendants forever obliged for their prosperity&quot;.

This scheme was in its fourteenth generation when Mao rejected it for the naming of his own children, preferring to give his sons the generational name An (, &quot;Lofty&quot;, &quot;Proud&quot;) instead. A similar practice was observed regarding the stage names of Chinese opera performers: all the students entering a training academy in the same year would adopt the same first character in their new &quot;given name&quot;. For example, as part of the class entering the National Drama School in 1933, Li Yuru adopted a name with the central character &quot;jade&quot; ().

Depending on the region and particular family, daughters were not entered into the family records and thus did not share the boys&#x27; generation name, although they may have borne a separate one among themselves. Even where generation names are not used, sibling names are frequently related. For example, a boy named Song () might have a sister named Mei (). In some families, the siblings&#x27; names have the same radical. For example, in the Jia () clan in &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;, a novel mirroring the rise and decline of the Qing dynasty, there is Zheng (), She (), and Min () in the first generation, Lian (), Zhen (), and Huan () in the second, and Yun (), Qin (), and Lan () in the third.

More recently, although generation names have become less common, many personal names reflect periods of Chinese history. For example, following the victory of the Communists in the Civil War, many Chinese bore &quot;revolutionary names&quot; such as Qiangguo () or Dongfeng (). Similarly, on Taiwan, it used to be common to incorporate one of the four characters of the name &quot;Republic of China&quot; () into masculine names. Periodic fad names like Aoyun () also appear. Owing to both effects, there has also been a recent trend in China to hire fortune tellers to change people&#x27;s names to new ones more in accordance with traditional Taoist and five element practices. In creating a new Chinese name, it is sometimes the practice to analyze the number of strokes in the characters used in the potential name and attempt to use characters that produce specific totals of strokes.

==Spelling==

The process of converting Chinese names into a phonetic alphabet is called romanization.

In mainland China, Chinese names have been romanized using the Hanyu Pinyin system since 1958. Although experiments with the complete conversion of Chinese to the Pinyin alphabet failed, it remains in common use and has become the transcription system of the United Nations and the International Organization for Standardization. Taiwan officially adopted Hanyu Pinyin as one of their romanisation schemes in 2009, although it continues to allow its citizens to use other romanisations on official documents such as passports, of which Hanyu Pinyin remains unpopular. The system is easily identified by its frequent use of letters uncommon in English, such as &quot;q&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, and &quot;z&quot;; when tones are included, they are noted via tone marks. In Pinyin, is written as Máo Zédōng.

Proper use of Pinyin means treating the surname and given name as precisely two separate words with no spaces between the letters of multiple Chinese characters. For example, &quot;&quot; is properly rendered either with its tone marks as &quot;Wáng Xiùyīng&quot; or without as &quot;Wang Xiuying&quot;, but should not be written as &quot;Wang Xiu Ying&quot;, &quot;Wang XiuYing&quot;, &quot;Wangxiuying&quot;, and so on. In the rare cases where a surname consists of more than one character, it too should be written as a unit: &quot;Sima Qian&quot;, not &quot;Si Ma Qian&quot; or &quot;Si Maqian&quot;. However, as the Chinese language makes almost no use of spaces, native speakers often do not know these rules and simply put a space between each Chinese character of their name, causing those used to alphabetical languages to think of the and &quot;&quot; as three words instead of two. Tone marks are also commonly omitted in practice.

Many overseas Chinese, Taiwanese and historic names still employ the older Wade–Giles system. This English-based system can be identified by its use of the digraphs &quot;hs&quot; (pinyin &quot;x&quot;) and &quot;ts&quot; (pinyin &quot;z&quot; and &quot;c&quot;) and by its use of hyphens to connect the syllables of words containing more than one character. Correct reading depends on the inclusion of superscript numbers and the use of apostrophes to distinguish between different consonants, but in practice both of these are commonly omitted. In Wade–Giles, is written as Mao Tse-tung, as the system hyphenates names between the characters. For example, Wang Xiuying and Sima Qian are written in Wade as &quot;Wang2 Hsiu4-ying1&quot; and &quot;Ssu1Ma3 Ch&#x27;ien1&quot;.

Pinyin and Wade–Giles both represent the pronunciation of Mandarin, based on the Beijing dialect. In Hong Kong, Macau, and the diaspora communities in southeast Asia and abroad, people often romanize their names according to their own native language, for example, Cantonese, Hokkien, and Hakka. This occurs amid a plethora of competing romanization systems. During British colonial rule, some adopted English spelling conventions for their Hong Kong names: &quot;Lee&quot; for , &quot;Shaw&quot; for , and so forth. In Macau, Chinese names are similarly sometimes still transliterated based on Portuguese orthography and Jyutping. It is common practice for the Chinese diaspora communities to use spaces in between each character of their name.

==Different names with the same spelling==
Although they come from different Chinese characters, it is common for many different Chinese names to have the same transliteration whether tone is marked or not.

For example, English spelling of the Chinese given name Ming has many different associated Chinese characters, all of which have different meanings. Therefore, when the name is written in Chinese, a person called Ming can have a completely different name from another person who is also called Ming.

Most &quot;mings&quot; share the same form between simplified and traditional Chinese.

*明 (meaning: bright, intelligent)
*名 (meaning: reputation)
*銘（铭）(meaning: poetic motto, inscribe)
*茗 (meaning: tea)
*命 (meaning: life, destiny)
*鳴（鸣）(meaning: sing)

==Alternative names==
From their earliest recorded history, the Chinese observed a number of naming taboos, avoiding the names of their elders, ancestors, and rulers out of respect and fear. As a result, the upper classes of traditional Chinese culture typically employed a variety of names over the course of their lives, and the emperors and sanctified deceased had still others.

Current naming practices are more straightforward and consistent, but a few pseudonyms or alternate names remain common.

When discussing Chinese writers, Chinese and Japanese scholars do not consistently use particular names, whether they are private names or alternative names.

===Milk name===
Traditionally, babies were named a hundred days after their birth; modern naming laws in the People&#x27;s Republic of China grant the parents a month before requiring the baby to be registered. Upon birth, the parents often use a &quot;milk name&quot; (, )—typically employing diminutives like , &quot;little&quot;) or doubled characters—before a formal name is settled upon, often in consultation with the grandparents. The milk name may be abandoned but is often continued as a form of familial nickname. A tradition sometimes attached to the milk name is to select an unpleasant name, to ward off demons who might wish to harm the child.

===Nickname===
Nicknames (, ) are acquired in much the same way they are in other countries. Not everyone has one. Most that do received theirs in childhood or adolescence from family or friends. Common Chinese nicknames are those based on a person&#x27;s physical attributes, speaking style, or behavior. Names involving animals are common, although those animals may be associated with different attributes than they are in English: for example, Chinese cows are strong, not stupid; foxes are devious, not clever; pigs are lazy, but not dirty. Similarly, nicknames that might seem especially insulting in English—such as &quot;Little Fatty&quot; ()—are more acceptable in Chinese. One especially common method of creating nicknames is prefixing &quot;Ā-&quot; () or &quot;Xiǎo&quot; () to the surname or the second character of the given name. &quot;Ā-&quot; is more common in the south and abroad, while &quot;Xiǎo&quot; is common throughout China. Both &quot;Ā-&quot; and &quot;Xiǎo&quot; are distinguished from &quot;Lǎo&quot; (, &quot;old&quot; but see below for usage). Nicknames are rarely used in formal or semi-formal settings, although a famous exception is A-bian.

===English alias in mainland China===
English is taught throughout China&#x27;s secondary schools and the English language section is a required component of the &quot;Gaokao&quot;, China&#x27;s college entrance examination. Many Chinese teenagers thus acquire Western names, commonly of English origin, which they may keep and use as nicknames even in Chinese-language contexts. Chinese may adopt English names for a variety of reasons, including foreigners&#x27; difficulty with Chinese tones and better integration of people working in foreign enterprises. Established English names chosen by Chinese may also be those rarely used by native English speakers.

===English alias in Chinese diaspora===
Hong Kong names often feature an English alias. 25.8% of Hongkongers have English given names as part of their legal names; a further 38.3% of Hongkongers go by English given names even though those are not part of their legal names; the two figures add up to a total of 64.1% of Hongkongers having English names, according to a survey of 2049 respondents in 2015. More unusual names made and adopted by Hongkongers are created by modifying normal English names – either by deleting, inserting or substituting specific letters (e.g. Kith, Sonija, Garbie), or by emulating the phonetic sounds of the Chinese name (e.g. Hacken Lee from Lee Hak-kan. English aliases are widely used at schools, at work, and in social circles. This is probably due to the influence from the prolonged British rule of Hong Kong from 1841 to 1997.

In Malaysia and Singapore, it is equally acceptable for Western names to appear before or after the Chinese given name, in Latin characters. Thus, the Singaporean President Tony Tan might see his name written as &quot;Tony Tan Keng Yam&quot; or &quot;Tan Keng Yam Tony&quot;. Individuals are free to register their legal names in either format on their identity cards. In general use, the English name first version is typically preferred as it keeps the correct order for both systems; however, for administrative purposes, the government agencies tend to place the English name last to organize lists of names and databases more easily, similar to the Western practice of organizing names with the last name first followed by a comma (&quot;Smith, John&quot;). In Singapore, there is an option to include the Chinese characters on one&#x27;s National Registration Identity Card.

In Indonesia, one of the countries with the largest Chinese diaspora population, the Indonesian Chinese in Indonesia and in diaspora has mostly adopted Indonesian-sounding variations of Chinese names due to decades of regulation and acculturation. Conversely, the usage of these Indonesian-sounding Chinese names are not restricted for surnames, and many are used liberally between other surnames since many Indonesian Chinese did not keep track of their Chinese (sur)names anymore, and even used by non-Chinese people (with some names being borrowing from regional languages and names).

Among Chinese diaspora residing in Western countries, it is becoming common practice for parents to give their children a Western name as their official first name, with the Chinese given name being officially recorded as a middle name.

===School name===
The school name () was a separate formal name used by the child while they were at school.

As binomial nomenclature is also called in Chinese, the school name is also sometimes now referenced as the to avoid confusion.

===Courtesy name===
Upon maturity, it was common for educated males to acquire a courtesy name (, or , ) either from one&#x27;s parents, a teacher, or self-selection. The name commonly mirrored the meaning of one&#x27;s given name or displayed his birth order within his family.

The practice was a consequence of admonitions in the &quot;Book of Rites&quot; that among adults it is disrespectful to be addressed by one&#x27;s given name by others within the same generation. The true given name was reserved for the use of one&#x27;s elders, while the courtesy name was employed by peers on formal occasions and in writing. The practice was decried by the May Fourth Movement and has been largely abandoned.

===Pseudonym===
Pseudonyms or aliases () or pen names () were self-selected alternative courtesy names, most commonly three or four characters long. They may have originated from too many people having the same courtesy name.

Some—but by no means most—authors do continue to employ stylized pen names. One example is the poet Zhao Zhenkai, whose pen name is &quot;Bei Dao&quot; ().

===Posthumous name===
Posthumous names () were honorary names selected after a person&#x27;s death, used extensively for royalty. The common &quot;names&quot; of most Chinese emperors before the Tang dynasty—with the pointed exception of Shi Huangdi—are their posthumous ones. In addition to emperors, successful courtiers and politicians such as Sun Yat-sen also occasionally received posthumous titles.

===Temple name===

The temple name () of the emperor inscribed on the spiritual tablets of the imperial ancestral temple often differed from his posthumous name. The structure eventually became highly restricted, consisting of a single adjective and either or . These common &quot;names&quot; of the emperors between the Tang and the Yuan are their temple ones.

===Era name===
The era name () arose from the custom of dating years by the reigns of the ruling emperors. Under the Han, the practice began of changing regnal names as means of dispensing with bad luck and attracting better. Almost all era names were literary and employed exactly two characters. By the Ming and Qing dynasties, emperors had largely dispensed with the practice and kept a single era name during their reign, such that it is customary to refer to Ming and Qing emperors by their era names.

== Forms of address ==
Within families, it is often considered inappropriate or even offensive to use the given names of relatives who are senior to the speaker. Instead, it is more customary to identify each family member by abstract hierarchical connections: among siblings, gender and birth order (big sister, second sister, and so on); for the extended family, the manner of relationship (by birth or marriage; from the maternal or paternal side).

The hierarchical titles of junior relatives are seldom used except in formal situations, or as indirect reference when speaking to family members who are even younger than the person in question. Children can be called by their given names, or their parents may use their nicknames.

When speaking of non-family social acquaintances, people are generally referred to by a title, for example Mother Li () or Mrs. Zhu (, ). Personal names can be used when referring to adult friends or to children, although, unlike in the West, referring to somebody by their full name (including surname) is common even among friends, especially if the person&#x27;s full name is only composed of two or three syllables. It is common to refer to a person as &quot;lǎo&quot; (, old) or &quot;xiǎo&quot; (, young) followed by their family name, thus Lǎo Wáng () or Xiǎo Zhān (). Xiǎo is also frequently used as a diminutive, when it is typically paired with the second or only character in a person&#x27;s name, rather than the surname. Because old people are well respected in Chinese society, &quot;lǎo&quot; (old) does not carry disrespect, offense or any negative implications even if it is used to refer to an older woman. Despite this, it is advisable for non-Chinese to avoid calling a person xiǎo-something or lǎo-something unless they are so-called by other Chinese people and it is clear that the appellation is acceptable and widely used. Otherwise, the use of the person&#x27;s full name, or alternatively, their surname followed by or is relatively neutral and unlikely to cause offense.

Within school settings and when addressing former classmates, it is common to refer to them as older siblings, e.g. elder brother Zhao () or e.g. elder sister Zhang () if they were of senior classes, or simply to show respect or closeness. The opposite (e.g. younger brother Zhao) is rarely used. This custom spawns from traditional forms of respectful address, where it was considered rude to directly address your seniors.

Whereas titles in many cultures are commonly solely determined by gender and, in some cases, marital status, the occupation or even work title of a person can be used as a title as a sign of respect in common address in Chinese culture. Because of the prestigious position of a teacher in traditional culture, a teacher is invariably addressed as such by his or her students (e.g. ), and commonly by others as a mark of respect. Where applicable, &quot;Teacher Surname&quot; is considered more respectful than &quot;Mr/Mrs/Miss Surname&quot; in Chinese. A professor is also commonly addressed as &quot;teacher&quot;, though &quot;professor&quot; is also accepted as a respectful title. By extension, a junior or less experienced member of a work place or profession would address a more senior member as &quot;Teacher&quot;.

Similarly, engineers are often addressed as such, though often shortened to simply the first character of the word &quot;engineer&quot; – . Should the person being addressed be the head of a company (or simply the middle manager of another company to whom you would like to show respect), one might equally address them by the title &quot;zǒng&quot; (), which means &quot;general&quot; or &quot;overall&quot;, and is the first character of titles such as &quot;Director General&quot; or &quot;general manager&quot; (e.g. ), or, if they are slightly lower down on the corporate hierarchy but nonetheless a manager, by affixing Jīnglǐ (, manager).

== Variations ==
===Unusual names===
Because the small number of Chinese surnames leads to confusion in social environments, and because some Chinese parents have a desire to give individuality, some Chinese have received unusual given names. As of April 2009, about 60 million Chinese people have unusual characters in their names. A 2006 report by the Chinese public security bureau stated that of about 55,000 Chinese characters used in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, only 32,232 of those are supported by the ministry&#x27;s computers. The PRC government has asked individuals with unusual names to change them so they can get new computer-readable public identity cards, and the diversity prevents them from receiving new identity cards if they do not change their names.

Beginning in at least 2003, the PRC government has been writing a list of standardized characters for everyday usage in life, which would be the pool of characters to select from when a child is given his or her name. Originally the limits were to go in place in 2005. In April 2009, the list had been revised 70 times, and it still has not been put into effect.

Wang Daliang, a China Youth University for Political Sciences linguistics scholar, said that &quot;Using obscure names to avoid duplication of names or to be unique is not good. Now a lot of people are perplexed by their names. The computer cannot even recognize them and people cannot read them. This has become an obstacle in communication.&quot; Zhou Youyong, the dean of the Southeast University law school, argued that the ability to choose the name of one&#x27;s children is a fundamental right, so the PRC government should be careful when making new naming laws.

While the vast majority of Han Chinese names consist of two or three characters, there are some Han Chinese with longer names, up to 15 characters. In addition, transliteration of ethnic languages into Chinese characters often results in long names.

=== Taiwan ===
Han family names in Taiwan are similar to those in southeast China, as most families trace their origins to places such as Fujian and Guangdong. Indigenous Taiwanese have also been forced to adopt Chinese names as part of enforced Sinicization. The popularity distribution of family names in Taiwan as a whole differs somewhat from the distribution of names among all Han Chinese, with the family name Chen () being particularly more common (about 11% in Taiwan, compared to about 3% in China). Local variations also exist.

Given names that consist of one character are much less common in Taiwan than on the mainland.

A traditional practice, now largely supplanted, was choosing deliberately unpleasant given names to ward off bad omens and evil spirits. For example, a boy facing a serious illness might be renamed Ti-sái (, &quot;Pig Shit&quot;) to indicate to the evil spirits that he was not worth their trouble. Similarly, a girl from a poor family might have the name Bóng-chī (, &quot;No Takers&quot;).

Nicknames (, &quot;gín-á-miâ&quot;, &quot;child names&quot;) are common and generally adopt the Southern Chinese practice of affixing the prefix &quot;A-&quot; () to the last syllable of a person&#x27;s name. Although these names are rarely used in formal contexts, there are a few public figures who are well known by their nicknames, including former president A-bian and the singer A-mei.

==Rendered in English==
===Word order===

For mainland Chinese, Western publications usually preserve the Chinese naming order, with the family name first, followed by the given name. This presentation of Chinese-character names is similar to those of Korean names; it differs from the presentation of Japanese names, which are usually reversed in English so they are family name last. For people with just a single given name or with compound surnames and a single given name, the western name order may add to the complication of confusing the surname and the given name.

The word order of Hong Kong names gets complicated when one has a legal English given name. For example, a person who has Kuo as his surname, Chi Yung as his Cantonese given name, and Peter as his legal English given name would have his name rendered as &quot;KUO, Chi Yung Peter&quot; on his Hong Kong identity card, however, the position and the use of a comma might be varied as &quot;KUO Chi Yung Peter&quot; or &quot;KUO Chi Yung, Peter&quot; on court papers. His name is much more likely to be printed as Peter Kuo Chi-yung (with a hyphen) or Peter Kuo on newspapers and academic journals.

===Hyphen or Spacing between given names===
Hong Kong names, Malaysian Chinese names and Singaporean Chinese names usually expressed in three parts (e.g., Goh Chok Tong), with spacing between their given names.

Unlike mainland Chinese, Taiwanese people usually place a dash between the two characters of the given name, similar to Korean names. This is also the case for the standard styling of Hong Kong Chinese names, where the given name is hyphenated.

===Comparison chart===

According to the &quot;Chicago Manual of Style&quot;, Chinese names are indexed by the family name with no inversion and no comma, unless it is of a Chinese person who has adopted a Western name.

==In Japanese==
In the Japanese language, Chinese names can be pronounced either approximating the original Chinese, the Local reading () of the characters, or using a Sino-Japanese On&#x27;yomi reading () to pronounce the Chinese characters. Local readings are often written in katakana rather than kanji, but not always. For example, (Mao Zedong) is pronounced &quot;Mō Takutō&quot; using an On&#x27;yomi reading, whereas Beijing () is spelled with kanji but pronounced &quot;Pekin&quot; (), with a local reading (which may also be considered a post-Tōsō-on reading), rather than &quot;Hokkyō&quot; (which would be the Kan-on reading).

<text>An optical telegraph is a line of stations, typically towers, for the purpose of conveying textual information by means of visual signals (a form of optical communication). There are two main types of such systems; the semaphore telegraph which uses pivoted indicator arms and conveys information according to the direction the indicators point, and the shutter telegraph which uses panels that can be rotated to block or pass the light from the sky behind to convey information.

The most widely used system was the Chappe telegraph, which was invented in France in 1792 by Claude Chappe. It was popular in the late eighteenth to early nineteenth centuries. Chappe used the term &quot;télégraphe&quot; to describe the mechanism he had invented – that is the origin of the English word &quot;telegraph&quot;. Lines of relay towers with a semaphore rig at the top were built within line of sight of each other, at separations of . Operators at each tower would watch the neighboring tower through a telescope, and when the semaphore arms began to move spelling out a message, they would pass the message on to the next tower. 

This system was much faster than post riders for conveying a message over long distances, and also had cheaper long-term operating costs, once constructed. Half a century later, semaphore lines were replaced by the electrical telegraph, which was cheaper, faster, and more private. The line-of-sight distance between relay stations was limited by geography and weather, and prevented the optical telegraph from crossing wide expanses of water, unless a convenient island could be used for a relay station. A modern derivative of the semaphore system is flag semaphore, signalling with hand-held flags.

==Etymology and terminology==
The word &quot;semaphore&quot; was coined in 1801 by the French inventor of the semaphore line itself, Claude Chappe. He composed it from the Greek elements σῆμα (sêma, &quot;sign&quot;); and from φορός (phorós, &quot;carrying&quot;), or φορά (phorá, &quot;a carrying&quot;) from φέρειν (phérein, &quot;to bear&quot;). Chappe also coined the word &quot;tachygraph&quot;, meaning &quot;fast writer&quot;. However, the French Army preferred to call Chappe&#x27;s semaphore system the &quot;telegraph&quot;, meaning &quot;far writer&quot;, which was coined by French statesman André François Miot de Mélito.

The word &quot;semaphoric&quot; was first printed in English in 1808: &quot;The newly constructed Semaphoric telegraphs (...) have been blown up&quot;, in a news report in the &quot;Naval Chronicle&quot;. The first use of the word &quot;semaphore&quot; in reference to English use was in 1816: &quot;The improved Semaphore has been erected on the top of the Admiralty&quot;, referring to the installation of a simpler telegraph invented by Sir Home Popham. Semaphore telegraphs are also called, &quot;Chappe telegraphs&quot; or &quot;Napoleonic semaphore&quot;.

==Early designs==

Optical telegraphy dates from ancient times, in the form of hydraulic telegraphs, torches (as used by ancient cultures since the discovery of fire) and smoke signals. Modern designs of semaphores developed via several paths, often simultaneously.

Possibly the earliest was by the British polymath Robert Hooke, who gave a vivid and comprehensive outline of visual telegraphy to the Royal Society in a 1684 submission in which he outlined many practical details. The system (which was motivated by military concerns, following the Battle of Vienna in 1683) was never put into practice.
One of the first experiments of optical signalling was carried out by the Anglo-Irish landowner and inventor, Sir Richard Lovell Edgeworth in 1767. He placed a bet with his friend, the horse racing gambler Lord March, that he could transmit knowledge of the outcome of the race in just one hour. Using a network of signalling sections erected on high ground, the signal would be observed from one station to the next by means of a telescope. The signal itself consisted of a large pointer that could be placed into eight possible positions in 45 degree increments. A series of two such signals gave a total 64 code elements and a third signal took it up to 512. He returned to his idea in 1795, after hearing of Chappe&#x27;s system.

While Edgeworth was developing his design, William Playfair, a Scottish political economist traveling in Europe in 1794, surreptitiously obtained the design and alphabet of the French system from a fleeing royalist. Playfair, who had numerous connections to British officials, provided a model of the system to the Duke of York, commander of British forces, then based in Flanders, and, according to the &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot;, &quot;hence the alphabet and plan of the machine came to England.&quot;

==Prevalence==

===France===

Credit for the first successful optical telegraph goes to the French engineer Claude Chappe and his brothers in 1792, who succeeded in covering France with a network of 556 stations stretching a total distance of . &quot;Le système Chappe&quot; was used for military and national communications until the 1850s.

====Development in France====
During 1790–1795, at the height of the French Revolution, France needed a swift and reliable military communications system to thwart the war efforts of its enemies. France was surrounded by the forces of Britain, the Netherlands, Prussia, Austria, and Spain, the cities of Marseille and Lyon were in revolt, and the British Fleet held Toulon. The only advantage France held was the lack of cooperation between the allied forces due to their inadequate lines of communication.

In mid-1790, the Chappe brothers set about devising a system of communication that would allow the central government to receive intelligence and to transmit orders in the shortest possible time. Chappe considered many possible methods including audio and smoke. He even considered using electricity, but could not find insulation for the conductors that would withstand the high-voltage electrostatic sources available at the time.

Chappe settled on an optical system and the first public demonstration occurred on 2 March 1791 between Brûlon and Parcé, a distance of . The system consisted of a modified pendulum clock at each end with dials marked with ten numerals. The hands of the clocks almost certainly moved much faster than a normal clock. The hands of both clocks were set in motion at the same time with a synchronisation signal. Further signals indicated the time at which the dial should be read. The numbers sent were then looked up in a codebook. In their preliminary experiments over a shorter distance, the Chappes had banged a pan for synchronisation. In the demonstration, they used black and white panels observed with a telescope. The message to be sent was chosen by town officials at Brûlon and sent by René Chappe to Claude Chappe at Parcé who had no pre-knowledge of the message. The message read &quot;si vous réussissez, vous serez bientôt couverts de gloire&quot; (If you succeed, you will soon bask in glory). It was only later that Chappe realised that he could dispense with the clocks and the synchronisation system itself could be used to pass messages.

The Chappes carried out experiments during the next two years, and on two occasions their apparatus at Place de l&#x27;Étoile, Paris was destroyed by mobs who thought they were communicating with royalist forces. Their cause was assisted by Ignace Chappe being elected to the Legislative Assembly. In the summer of 1792 Claude was appointed &quot;Ingénieur-Télégraphiste&quot; and charged with establishing a line of stations between Paris and Lille, a distance of 230 kilometres (about 143 miles). It was used to carry dispatches for the war between France and Austria. In 1794, it brought news of a French capture of Condé-sur-l&#x27;Escaut from the Austrians less than an hour after it occurred. The first symbol of a message to Lille would pass through 15 stations in only nine minutes. The speed of the line varied with the weather, but the line to Lille typically transferred 36 symbols, a complete message, in about 32 minutes. Another line of 50 stations was completed in 1798, covering 488 km between Paris and Strasbourg. From 1803 on, the French also used the 3-arm Depillon semaphore at coastal locations to provide warning of British incursions.

English military engineer William Congreve observed that at the Battle of Vervik of 1793 French commanders directed their forces by using the sails of a prominent local windmill as an improvised signal station. Two of the four sails of the mill had been removed to resemble the arm of the new telegraph.

====Chappe system technical operation====
The Chappe brothers determined by experiment that it was easier to see the angle of a rod than to see the presence or absence of a panel. Their semaphore was composed of two black movable wooden arms, connected by a cross bar; the positions of all three of these components together indicated an alphabetic letter. With counterweights (named &quot;forks&quot;) on the arms, the Chappe system was controlled by only two handles and was mechanically simple and reasonably robust. Each of the two 2-metre-long arms could display seven positions, and the 4.6-metre-long cross bar connecting the two arms could display four different angles, for a total of 196 symbols (7×7×4). Night operation with lamps on the arms was unsuccessful. To speed up transmission and to provide some semblance of security, a code book was developed for use with semaphore lines. The Chappes&#x27; corporation used a code that took 92 of the basic symbols two at a time to yield 8,464 coded words and phrases.

The revised Chappe system of 1795 provided not only a set of codes but also an operational protocol intended to maximize line throughput. Symbols were transmitted in cycles of &quot;2 steps and 3 movements.&quot;

* Step 1, movement 1 (setup): The operator turned the indicator arms to align with the cross bar, forming a non-symbol, and then turned the cross bar into position for the next symbol.
* Step 1, movement 2 (transmission): The operator positioned the indicator arms for current symbol and waited for the downline station to copy it.
* Step 2, movement 3 (completion): The operator turned the cross bar to a vertical or horizontal position, indicating the end of a cycle.

In this manner, each symbol could propagate down the line as quickly as operators could successfully copy it, with acknowledgement and flow control built into the protocol. A symbol sent from Paris took 2 minutes to reach Lille through 22 stations and 9 minutes to reach Lyon through 50 stations. A rate of 2–3 symbols per minute was typical, with the higher figure being prone to errors. This corresponds to only 0.4–0.6 wpm, but with messages limited to those contained in the code book, this could be dramatically increased. An additional benefit is that, if the code is kept secret, the content of transmitted messages can be concealed from both onlookers and system operators, even if they are aware that a message is being transmitted. This has remained an important feature of encrypted communications even as the technology for transmitting data has evolved.

====History in France====

After Chappe&#x27;s initial line (between Paris and Lille), the Paris to Strasbourg with 50 stations followed soon after (1798). Napoleon Bonaparte made full use of the telegraph by obtaining speedy information on enemy movements. In 1801 he had Abraham Chappe build an extra-large station to transmit across the English Channel in preparation for an invasion of Britain. A pair of such stations were built on a test line over a comparable distance. The line to Calais was extended to Boulogne in anticipation and a new design station was briefly in operation at Boulogne, but the invasion never happened. In 1812, Napoleon took up another design of Abraham Chappe for a mobile telegraph that could be taken with him on campaign. This was still in use in 1853 during the Crimean War.

The invention of the telegraph was followed by an enthusiasm concerning its potential to support direct democracy. For instance, based on Rousseau&#x27;s argument that direct democracy was improbable in large constituencies, the French Intellectual Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde commented:

The operational costs of the telegraph in the year 1799/1800 were 434,000 francs ($1.2 million in 2015 in silver costs). In December 1800, Napoleon cut the budget of the telegraph system by 150,000 francs ($400,000 in 2015) leading to the Paris-Lyons line being temporarily closed. Chappe sought commercial uses of the system to make up the deficit, including use by industry, the financial sector, and newspapers. Only one proposal was immediately approved—the transmission of results from the state-run lottery. No non-government uses were approved. The lottery had been abused for years by fraudsters who knew the results, selling tickets in provincial towns after the announcement in Paris, but before the news had reached those towns.
In 1819 Norwich Duff, a young British Naval officer, visiting Clermont-en-Argonne, walked up to the telegraph station there and engaged the signalman in conversation. Here is his note of the man&#x27;s information:

The network was reserved for government use, but an early case of wire fraud occurred in 1834 when two bankers, François and Joseph Blanc, bribed the operators at a station near Tours on the line between Paris and Bordeaux to pass Paris stock exchange information to an accomplice in Bordeaux. It took three days for the information to travel the 300 mile distance, giving the schemers plenty of time to play the market. An accomplice at Paris would know whether the market was going up or down days before the information arrived in Bordeaux via the newspapers, after which Bordeaux was sure to follow. The message could not be inserted in the telegraph directly because it would have been detected. Instead, pre-arranged deliberate errors were introduced into existing messages which were visible to an observer at Bordeaux. Tours was chosen because it was a division station where messages were purged of errors by an inspector who was privy to the secret code used and unknown to the ordinary operators. The scheme would not work if the errors were inserted prior to Tours. The operators were told whether the market was going up or down by the colour of packages (either white or grey paper wrapping) sent by mail coach, or, according to another anecdote, if the wife of the Tours operator received a package of socks (down) or gloves (up) thus avoiding any evidence of misdeed being put in writing. The scheme operated for two years until it was discovered in 1836.

The French optical system remained in use for many years after other countries had switched to the electrical telegraph. Partly, this was due to inertia; France had the most extensive optical system and hence the most difficult to replace. But there were also arguments put forward for the superiority of the optical system. One of these was that the optical system is not so vulnerable to saboteurs as an electrical system with many miles of unguarded wire. Samuel Morse failed to sell the electrical telegraph to the French government. Eventually the advantages of the electrical telegraph of improved privacy, and all-weather and nighttime operation won out. A decision was made in 1846 to replace the optical telegraph with the Foy–Breguet electrical telegraph after a successful trial on the Rouen line. This system had a display which mimicked the look of the Chappe telegraph indicators to make it familiar to telegraph operators. Jules Guyot issued a dire warning of the consequences of what he considered to be a serious mistake. It took almost a decade before the optical telegraph was completely decommissioned. One of the last messages sent over the French semaphore was the report of the fall of Sebastopol in 1855.

=== Sweden ===

Sweden was the second country in the world, after France, to introduce an optical telegraph network. Its network became the second most extensive after France. The central station of the network was at the Katarina Church in Stockholm. The system was faster than the French system, partly due to the Swedish control panel and partly to the ease of transcribing the octal code (the French system was recorded as pictograms). The system was used primarily for reporting the arrival of ships, but was also useful in wartime for observing enemy movements and attacks.

The last stationary semaphore link in regular service was in Sweden, connecting an island with a mainland telegraph line. It went out of service in 1880.

====Development in Sweden====
Inspired by news of the Chappe telegraph, the Swedish inventor Abraham Niclas Edelcrantz experimented with the optical telegraph in Sweden. He constructed a three-station experimental line in 1794 running from the royal castle in Stockholm, via Traneberg, to the grounds of Drottningholm Castle, a distance of . The first demonstration was on 1 November, when Edelcrantz sent a poem dedicated to the king, Gustav IV Adolf, on his fourteenth birthday. On 7 November the king brought Edelcrantz into his Council of Advisers with a view to building a telegraph throughout Sweden, Denmark, and Finland.

====Edelcrantz system technical operation====
After some initial experiments with Chappe-style indicator arms, Edelcrantz settled on a design with ten iron shutters. Nine of these represented a 3-digit octal number and the tenth, when closed, meant the code number should be preceded by &quot;A&quot;. This gave 1,024 codepoints which were decoded to letters, words or phrases via a codebook. The telegraph had a sophisticated control panel which allowed the next symbol to be prepared while waiting for the previous symbol to be repeated on the next station down the line. The control panel was connected by strings to the shutters. When ready to transmit, all the shutters were set at the same time with the press of a footpedal.

The shutters were painted matte black to avoid reflection from sunlight and the frame and arms supporting the shutters were painted white or red for best contrast. Around 1809 Edelcrantz introduced an updated design. The frame around the shutters was dispensed with leaving a simpler, more visible, structure of just the arms with the indicator panels on the end of them. The &quot;A&quot; shutter was reduced to the same size as the other shutters and offset to one side to indicate which side was the most significant digit (whether the codepoint is read left-to-right or right-to-left is different for the two adjacent stations depending on which side they are on). This was previously indicated with a stationary indicator fixed to the side of the frame, but without a frame this was no longer possible.

The distance that a station could transmit depended on the size of the shutters and the power of the telescope being used to observe them. The smallest object visible to the human eye is one that subtends an angle of 40 seconds of arc, but Edelcrantz used a figure of 4 minutes of arc to account for atmospheric disturbances and imperfections of the telescope. On that basis, and with a 32× telescope, Edelcrantz specified shutter sizes ranging from 9 inches () for a distance of half a Swedish mile () to 54 inches () for 3 Swedish miles (). These figures were for the original design with square shutters. The open design of 1809 had long oblong shutters which Edelcrantz thought was more visible. Distances much further than these would require impractically high towers to overcome the curvature of the Earth as well as large shutters. Edelcrantz kept the distance between stations under 2 Swedish miles () except where large bodies of water made it unavoidable.

The Swedish telegraph was capable of being used at night with lamps. On smaller stations lamps were placed behind the shutters so that they became visible when the shutter was opened. For larger stations, this was impractical. Instead, a separate tin box matrix with glass windows was installed below the daytime shutters. The lamps inside the tin box could be uncovered by pulling strings in the same way the daytime shutters were operated. Windows on both sides of the box allowed the lamps to be seen by both the upstream and downstream adjacent stations. The codepoints used at night were the complements of the codepoints used during the day. This made the pattern of lamps in open shutters at night the same as the pattern of closed shutters in daytime.

====First network: 1795–1809====
The first operational line, Stockholm to Vaxholm, went into service in January 1795. By 1797 there were also lines from Stockholm to Fredriksborg, and Grisslehamn via Signilsskär to Eckerö in Åland. A short line near Göteborg to Marstrand on the west coast was installed in 1799. During the War of the Second Coalition, Britain tried to enforce a blockade against France. Concerned at the effect on their own trade, Sweden joined the Second League of Armed Neutrality in 1800. Britain was expected to respond with an attack on one of the Nordic countries in the league. To help guard against such an attack, the king ordered a telegraph link joining the systems of Sweden and Denmark. This was the first international telegraph connection in the world. Edelcrantz made this link between Helsingborg in Sweden and Helsingør in Denmark, across the Öresund, the narrow strait separating the two countries. A new line along the coast from Kullaberg to Malmö, incorporating the Helsingborg link, was planned in support and to provide signalling points to the Swedish fleet. Nelson&#x27;s attack on the Danish fleet at Copenhagen in 1801 was reported over this link, but after Sweden failed to come to Denmark&#x27;s aid it was not used again and only one station on the supporting line was ever built.

In 1808 the Royal Telegraph Institution was created and Edelcrantz was made director. The Telegraph Institution was put under the jurisdiction of the military, initially as part of the Royal Engineering Corps. A new code was introduced to replace the 1796 codebook with 5,120 possible codepoints with many new messages. The new codes included punishments for delinquent operators. These included an order to the operator to stand on one of the telegraph arms (code 001-721), and a message asking an adjacent station to confirm that they could see him do it (code 001-723). By 1809, the network had 50 stations over of line employing 172 people. In comparison, the French system in 1823 had of line and employed over three thousand people.

In 1808, the Finnish War broke out when Russia seized Finland, then part of Sweden. Åland was attacked by Russia and the telegraph stations destroyed. The Russians were expelled in a revolt, but attacked again in 1809. The station at Signilsskär found itself behind enemy lines, but continued to signal the position of Russian troops to the retreating Swedes. After Sweden ceded Finland in the Treaty of Fredrikshamn, the east coast telegraph stations were considered superfluous and put into storage. In 1810, the plans for a south coast line were revived but were scrapped in 1811 due to financial considerations. Also in 1811, a new line from Stockholm via Arholma to Söderarm lighthouse was proposed, but also never materialised. For a while, the telegraph network in Sweden was almost non-existent, with only four telegraphists employed by 1810.

====Rebuilding the network====
The post of Telegraph Inspector was created as early as 1811, but the telegraph in Sweden remained dormant until 1827 when new proposals were put forward. In 1834, the Telegraph Institution was moved to the Topographical Corps. The Corps head, Carl Fredrik Akrell, conducted comparisons of the Swedish shutter telegraph with more recent systems from other countries. Of particular interest was the semaphore system of Charles Pasley in England which had been on trial in Karlskrona. Tests were performed between Karlskrona and Drottningskär, and, in 1835, nighttime tests between Stockholm and Fredriksborg. Akrell concluded that the shutter telegraph was faster and easier to use, and was again adopted for fixed stations. However, Pasley&#x27;s semaphore was cheaper and easier to construct, so was adopted for mobile stations. By 1836 the Swedish telegraph network had been fully restored.

The network continued to expand. In 1837, the line to Vaxholm was extended to Furusund. In 1838 the Stockholm-Dalarö-Sandhamn line was extended to Landsort. The last addition came in 1854 when the Furusund line was extended to Arholma and Söderarm. The conversion to electrical telegraphy was slower and more difficult than in other countries. The many stretches of open ocean needing to be crossed on the Swedish archipelagos was a major obstacle. Akrell also raised similar concerns to those in France concerning potential sabotage and vandalism of electrical lines. Akrell first proposed an experimental electrical telegraph line in 1852. For many years the network consisted of a mix of optical and electrical lines. The last optical stations were not taken out of service until 1881, the last in operation in Europe. In some places, the heliograph replaced the optical telegraph rather than the electrical telegraph.}

===United Kingdom===

In Ireland, Richard Lovell Edgeworth returned to his earlier work in 1794, and proposed a telegraph there to warn against an anticipated French invasion; however, the proposal was not implemented. Lord George Murray, stimulated by reports of the Chappe semaphore, proposed a system of visual telegraphy to the British Admiralty in 1795. He employed rectangular framework towers with six five-foot-high octagonal shutters on horizontal axes that flipped between horizontal and vertical positions to signal. The Rev. Mr Gamble also proposed two distinct five-element systems in 1795: one using five shutters, and one using five ten-foot poles. The British Admiralty accepted Murray&#x27;s system in September 1795, and the first system was the 15 site chain from London to Deal. Messages passed from London to Deal in about sixty seconds, and sixty-five sites were in use by 1808.

Chains of Murray&#x27;s shutter telegraph stations were built along the following routes: London–Deal and Sheerness, London–Great Yarmouth, and London–Portsmouth and Plymouth. The line to Plymouth was not completed until 4 July 1806, and so could not be used to relay the news of Trafalgar. The shutter stations were temporary wooden huts, and at the conclusion of the Napoleonic wars they were no longer necessary, and were closed down by the Admiralty in March 1816.

Following the Battle of Trafalgar, the news was transmitted to London by frigate to Falmouth, from where the captain took the dispatches to London by coach along what became known as the Trafalgar Way; the journey took 38 hours. This delay prompted the Admiralty to investigate further.

A replacement telegraph system was sought, and of the many ideas and devices put forward the Admiralty chose the simpler semaphore system invented by Sir Home Popham. A Popham semaphore was a single fixed vertical 30 foot pole, with two movable 8 foot arms attached to the pole by horizontal pivots at their ends, one arm at the top of the pole, and the other arm at the middle of the pole. The signals of the Popham semaphore were found to be much more visible than those of the Murray shutter telegraph. Popham&#x27;s 2-arm semaphore was modelled after the 3-arm Depillon French semaphore. An experimental semaphore line between the Admiralty and Chatham was installed in July 1816, and its success helped to confirm the choice.

Subsequently, the Admiralty decided to establish a permanent link to Portsmouth and built a chain of semaphore stations. Work started in December 1820 with Popham&#x27;s equipment replaced with another two-arm system invented by Charles Pasley. Each of the arms of Pasley&#x27;s system could take on one of eight positions and it thus had more codepoints than Popham&#x27;s. In good conditions messages were sent from London to Portsmouth in less than eight minutes. The line was operational from 1822 until 1847, when the railway and electric telegraph provided a better means of communication. The semaphore line did not use the same locations as the shutter chain, but followed almost the same route with 15 stations: Admiralty (London), Chelsea Royal Hospital, Putney Heath, Coombe Warren, Coopers Hill, Chatley Heath, Pewley Hill, Bannicle Hill, Haste Hill (Haslemere), Holder Hill, (Midhurst), Beacon Hill, Compton Down, Camp Down, Lumps Fort (Southsea), and Portsmouth Dockyard. The semaphore tower at Chatley Heath, which replaced the Netley Heath station of the shutter telegraph, is currently being restored by the Landmark Trust as self-catering holiday accommodation. There will be public access on certain days when the restoration is complete.

The Board of the Port of Liverpool obtained a local act of Parliament, the Liverpool Improvement Act 1825 (6 Geo. 4. c. clxxxvii), to construct a chain of Popham optical semaphore stations from Liverpool to Holyhead in 1825. The system was designed and part-owned by Barnard L. Watson, a reserve marine officer, and came into service in 1827. The line is possibly the only example of an optical telegraph built entirely for commercial purposes. It was used so that observers at Holyhead could report incoming ships to the Port of Liverpool and trading could begin in the cargo being carried before the ship docked. The line was kept in operation until 1860 when a railway line and associated electrical telegraph made it redundant. Many of the prominences on which the towers were built (&#x27;telegraph hills&#x27;) are known as Telegraph Hill to this day.

====British empire====

=====Ireland=====
In Ireland R.L. Edgeworth was to develop an optical telegraph based on a triangle pointer, measuring up to 16 feet in height. Following several years promoting his system, he was to get admiralty approval and engaged in its construction during 1803–1804. The completed system ran from Dublin to Galway and was to act as a rapid warning system in case of French invasion of the west coast of Ireland. Despite its success in operation, the receding threat of French invasion was to see the system disestablished in 1804.

=====Canada=====
In Canada, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent established the first semaphore line in North America. In operation by 1800, it ran between the city of Halifax and the town of Annapolis in Nova Scotia, and across the Bay of Fundy to Saint John and Fredericton in New Brunswick. In addition to providing information on approaching ships, the Duke used the system to relay military commands, especially as they related to troop discipline. The Duke had envisioned the line reaching as far as the British garrison at Quebec City, but the many hills and coastal fog meant the towers needed to be placed relatively close together to ensure visibility. The labour needed to build and continually man so many stations taxed the already stretched-thin British military and there is doubt the New Brunswick line was ever in operation. With the exception of the towers around Halifax harbour, the system was abandoned shortly after the Duke&#x27;s departure in August 1800.

=====Malta=====

The British military authorities began to consider installing a semaphore line in Malta in the early 1840s. Initially, it was planned that semaphore stations be established on the bell towers and domes of the island&#x27;s churches, but the religious authorities rejected the proposal. Due to this, in 1848 new semaphore towers were constructed at Għargħur and Għaxaq on the main island, and another was built at Ta&#x27; Kenuna on Gozo. Further stations were established at the Governor&#x27;s Palace, Selmun Palace and the Giordan Lighthouse. Each station was staffed by the Royal Engineers.

=====India=====
In India, semaphore towers were introduced in 1810. A series of towers were built between Fort William, Kolkata to Chunar Fort near Varanasi.The towers in the plains were tall and those in the hills were tall, and were built at an interval of about .

=====Van Diemen&#x27;s Land=====
In southern Van Diemens Land (Tasmania) a signalling system to announce the arrival of ships was suggested by Governor-In-Chief Lachlan Macquarie when he made his first visit in 1811 Initially a simple flag system in 1818 between Mt. Nelson and Hobart, it developed into a system with two revolving arms by 1829, the system was quite crude and the arms were difficult to operate. In 1833 Charles O&#x27;Hara Booth took over command of the Port Arthur penal settlement, as an &quot;enthusiast in the art of signalling&quot; he saw the value of better communications with the headquarters in Hobart. During his command the semaphore system was extended to include 19 stations on the various mountains and islands between Port Arthur and Hobart. Until 1837 three single rotating arm semaphores were used. Subsequently the network was upgraded to use signal posts with six arms - a pair top, middle and bottom. This enabled the semaphore to send 999 signal codes. Captain George King of the Port Office and Booth together contributed to the code book for the system. 
King drew up shipping related codes and Booth added Government, Military and penal station matters. In 1877 Port Arthur was closed and the semaphore was operated for shipping signals only, it was finally replaced with a simple flagstaff after the introduction of the telephone in 1880.

In the north of the state there was a requirement to report on shipping arrivals as they entered the Tamar Estuary, some 55 kilometers from the main port at this time in Launceston. The Tamar Valley Semaphore System was based on a design by Peter Archer Mulgrave. This design used two arms, one with a cross piece at the end. The arms were rotated by ropes, and later chains. The barred arm positions indicated numbers 1 to 6 clockwise from the bottom left and the unbarred arm 7,8,9, STOP and REPEAT. A message was sent by sending numbers sequentially to make up a code. As with other systems the code was decoded via a code book. On 1 October 1835 it was announced in the Launceston Advertiser - &quot;...that the signal stations are now complete from Launceston to George Town, and communication may he made, as well as received, from the Windmill Hill to George Town, in a very few minutes, on a clear day&quot;. The system comprised six stations - Launceston Port Office, Windmill Hill, Mt. Direction, Mt.George, George Town Port Office, Low Head lighthouse. The Tamar Valley semaphore telegraph operated for twenty-two and a half years closing on 31 March 1858 after the introduction of the electric telegraph.
In the 1990s the Tamar Valley Signal Station Committee Inc. was formed to restore the system. The works were carried out over several years and the semaphore telegraph was declared complete once more on Sunday 30 September 2001.

===Iberia===
==== Spain ====
In Spain, the engineer Agustín de Betancourt developed his own system which was adopted by that state; in 1798 he received a Royal Appointment, and the first stretch of line connecting Madrid and Aranjuez was in operation as of August 1800. Spain was spanned by an extensive semaphore telegraph network in the 1840s and 1850s. The three main semaphore lines radiated from Madrid. The first ran north to Irun on the Atlantic coast at the French border. The second ran east to the Mediterranean, then north along the coast through Barcelona to the French border. The third ran south to Cadiz on the Atlantic coast. These lines served many other Spanish cities, including: Aranjuez, Badajoz, Burgos, Castellon, Ciudad Real, Córdoba, Cuenca, Gerona, Pamplona, San Sebastian, Seville, Tarancon, Taragona, Toledo, Valladolid, Valencia, Vitoria and Zaragoza.

The rugged topography of the Iberian peninsula that facilitated the design of semaphore lines conveying information from hilltop to hilltop, made it difficult to implement wire telegraph lines when that technology was introduced in the mid 19th century. The Madrid-Cadiz line was the first to be dismantled in 1855, but other segments of the optical system continued to function until the end of the Carlist Wars in 1876.

==== Portugal ====
In Portugal, the British forces fighting Napoleon in Portugal soon found that the Portuguese Army had already a very capable semaphore terrestrial system working since 1808, giving the Duke of Wellington a decisive advantage in intelligence. The innovative Portuguese telegraphs, designed by , a mathematician, were of 3 types: 3 shutters, 3 balls and 1 pointer/moveable arm. He also wrote the code book &quot;Táboas Telegráphicas&quot;, the same for the 3 telegraph types. Since early 1810 the network was operated by &quot;Corpo Telegráfico&quot;, the first Portuguese military Signal Corps.

Once it had proved its success in France, the optical telegraph was imitated in many other countries, especially after it was used by Napoleon to coordinate his empire and army. In most of these countries, the postal authorities operated the semaphore lines. Many national services adopted signalling systems different from the Chappe system. For example, the UK and Sweden adopted systems of shuttered panels (in contradiction to the Chappe brothers&#x27; contention that angled rods are more visible). In some cases, new systems were adopted because they were thought to be improvements. But many countries pursued their own, often inferior, designs for reasons of national pride or not wanting to copy from rivals and enemies.

In 1801, the Danish post office installed a semaphore line across the Great Belt strait, &quot;Storebæltstelegrafen&quot;, between islands Funen and Zealand with stations at Nyborg on Funen, on the small island Sprogø in the middle of the strait, and at Korsør on Zealand. It was in use until 1865.
In the Kingdom of Prussia, Frederick William III ordered the construction of an experimental line in 1819, but due to opposition from the defence minister Karl von Hake, nothing happened until 1830 when a short three-station line between Berlin and Potsdam was built. The design was based on the Swedish telegraph with the number of shutters increased to twelve. &quot;Postrat&quot; Carl Pistor proposed instead a semaphore system based on Watson&#x27;s design in England. An operational line of this design running Berlin-Magdeburg-Dortmund-Köln-Bonn-Koblenz was completed in 1833. The line employed about 200 people, comparable to Sweden, but no network ever developed and no more official lines were built. The line was decommissioned in 1849 in favour of an electrical line.

Although there were no more government sponsored official lines, there was some private enterprise. Johann Ludwig Schmidt opened a commercial line from Hamburg to Cuxhaven in 1837. In 1847, Schmidt opened a second line from Bremen to Bremerhaven. These lines were used for reporting the arrival of commercial ships. The two lines were later linked with three additional stations to create possibly the only private telegraph network in the optical telegraph era. The telegraph inspector for this network was Friedrich Clemens Gerke, who would later move to the Hamburg-Cuxhaven electrical telegraph line and develop what became the International Morse Code. The Hamburg line went out of use in 1850, and the Bremen line in 1852.

In Russia, Tsar Nicolas I inaugurated a line between Moscow and Warsaw of length in 1833; it needed 220 stations staffed by 1,320 operators. The stations were noted to be unused and decaying in 1859, so the line was probably abandoned long before this.

In the United States, the first optical telegraph was built by Jonathan Grout in 1804 but ceased operation in 1807. This line between Martha&#x27;s Vineyard with Boston transmitted shipping news. An optical telegraph system linking Philadelphia and the mouth of the Delaware Bay was in place by 1809 and had a similar purpose; a second line to New York City was operational by 1834, when its Philadelphia terminus was moved to the tower of the Merchants Exchange. One of the principal hills in San Francisco, California is also named &quot;Telegraph Hill&quot;, after the semaphore telegraph which was established there in 1849 to signal the arrival of ships into San Francisco Bay.

==As first data networks==
The optical telegraphs put in place at the turn of the 18th/19th centuries were the first examples of data networks. Chappe and Edelcrantz independently invented many features that are now commonplace in modern networks, but were then revolutionary and essential to the smooth running of the systems. These features included control characters, routing, error control, flow control, message priority and symbol rate control. Edelcrantz documented the meaning and usage of all his control codes from the start in 1794. The details of the early Chappe system are not known precisely; the first operating instructions to survive date to 1809 and the French system is not as fully explained as the Swedish.

Some of the features of these systems are considered advanced in modern practice and have been recently reinvented. An example of this is the error control codepoint 707 in the Edelcrantz code. This was used to request the repeat of a specified recent symbol. The 707 was followed by two symbols identifying the row and column in the current page of the logbook that it was required to repeat. This is an example of a selective repeat and is more efficient than the simple go back n strategy used on many modern networks. This was a later addition; both Edelcrantz (codepoint 272), and Chappe (codepoint 2H6) initially used only a simple &quot;erase last character&quot; for error control, taken directly from Hooke&#x27;s 1684 proposal.

Routing in the French system was almost permanently fixed; only Paris and the station at the remote end of a line were allowed to initiate a message. The early Swedish system was more flexible, having the ability to set up message connections between arbitrary stations. Similar to modern networks, the initialisation request contained the identification of the requesting and target station. The request was acknowledged by the target station by sending the complement of the code received. This protocol is unique with no modern equivalent. This facility was removed from the codebook in the revision of 1808. After this, only Stockholm would normally initiate messages with other stations waiting to be polled.

The Prussian system required the Coblenz station (at the end of the line) to send a &quot;no news&quot; message (or a real message if there was one pending) back to Berlin on the hour, every hour. Intermediate stations could only pass messages by replacing the &quot;no news&quot; message with their traffic. On arrival in Berlin, the &quot;no news&quot; message was returned to Coblenz with the same procedure. This can be considered an early example of a token passing system. This arrangement required accurate clock synchronisation at all the stations. A synchronisation signal was sent out from Berlin for this purpose every three days.
Another feature that would be considered advanced in a modern electronic system is the dynamic changing of transmission rates. Edelcrantz had codepoints for faster (770) and slower (077). Chappe also had this feature.

==In popular culture==
By the mid-19th century, the optical telegraph was well known enough to be referenced in popular works without special explanation. The Chappe telegraph appeared in contemporary fiction and comic strips. In &quot;Mister Pencil&quot; (1831), a comic strip by Rodolphe Töpffer, a dog fallen on a Chappe telegraph&#x27;s arm—and its master attempting to help get it down—provoke an international crisis by inadvertently transmitting disturbing messages. In &quot;Lucien Leuwen&quot; (1834), Stendhal pictures a power struggle between Lucien Leuwen and the prefect M. de Séranville with the telegraph&#x27;s director M. Lamorte. In Chapter 60 (&quot;The Telegraph&quot;) of Alexandre Dumas&#x27; &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (1844), the title character describes with fascination the semaphore line&#x27;s moving arms: &quot;I had at times seen rise at the end of a road, on a hillock and in the bright light of the sun, these black folding arms looking like the legs of an immense beetle.&quot; He later bribes a semaphore operator to relay a false message in order to manipulate the French financial market. Dumas also describes in detail the functioning of a Chappe telegraph line. In Hector Malot&#x27;s novel &quot;Romain Kalbris&quot; (1869), one of the characters, a girl named Dielette, describes her home in Paris as &quot;...next to a church near which there was a clock tower. On top of the tower there were two large black arms, moving all day this way and that. [I was told later] that this was Saint-Eustache church and that these large black arms were a telegraph.&quot;

In the 21st century, the optical telegraph concept is mainly kept alive in popular culture through fiction such as the novel &quot;Pavane&quot; and Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Clacks&quot; in his Discworld novels, most notably the 2004 novel &quot;Going Postal&quot;.

<text>NYPD Blue is an American police procedural television series set in New York City, exploring the struggles of the fictional 15th Precinct detective squad in Manhattan. Each episode typically intertwines several plots involving an ensemble cast. The show was created by Steven Bochco and David Milch, and was inspired by Milch&#x27;s relationship with Bill Clark, a former member of the New York City Police Department who eventually became one of the show&#x27;s producers. The series was originally broadcast by ABC from September 21, 1993‚ to March 1, 2005. It was ABC&#x27;s longest-running primetime one-hour drama series until &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; surpassed it in 2016.

&quot;NYPD Blue&quot; was met with critical acclaim, praised for its grittiness and realistic portrayal of the cast&#x27;s personal and professional lives. However, the show garnered controversy for its depictions of nudity and alcoholism. In 1997, &quot;True Confessions&quot; (Season 1, Episode 4), written by Art Monterastelli and directed by Charles Haid, was ranked number 36 on &quot;&quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time&quot;. In 2009, &quot;Hearts and Souls&quot; (Season 6, Episode 5), Jimmy Smits&#x27; final episode as a main cast member, ranked 30th on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s &quot;100 Greatest Episodes of All Time&quot;.

==Main cast==

 
==Production and crew==
Produced by 20th Century Fox and Steven Bochco Productions, film production primarily took place in the greater Los Angeles area. The show did film in New York, but only for exterior shots that used New York landmarks. In the final season, the show was filmed only in Los Angeles to save money.

The series was shot on film and framed for a 16:9 ratio from the first episode, though it was not natively broadcast in HD until season 9. In 2016, the first eight seasons were remastered into a 2K resolution HD image for use in future syndication and streaming releases. The 90-minute versions of &quot;Lost Israel, Part 2,&quot; &quot;Honeymoon at Viagra Falls,&quot; and &quot;Hearts and Souls&quot; were not included in this project and are available only on the DVD releases, as standard definition 4:3 episodes. The streaming remastered editions use the 60-minute versions of those episodes.

Exterior shots of the 15th Precinct used the 9th Precinct building on East 5th Street in New York City, also used for &quot;Kojak&quot;.

The show was initially a vehicle for David Caruso. John Kelly was the main character, and the first season revolved around him and his professional and personal lives. Promotional shots for the show depicted Caruso in the foreground and other first-season characters set off behind him. Season two had the departure of John Kelly, and the show was thereafter built around an ensemble cast.

Dennis Franz, as Andy Sipowicz, a veteran New York City Police detective, evolved into the show&#x27;s lead character, who increasingly assumed a mentorship role to other characters as the series progressed. His co-stars included (season two and beyond) Jimmy Smits as Det. Bobby Simone (1994–1998), Rick Schroder as Det. Danny Sorenson (1998–2001), and Mark-Paul Gosselaar as Det. John Clark, Jr. (2001–2005).

===Music===

The show used an instrumental theme by prolific TV composer Mike Post which did not change throughout the run of the series. The theme begins with a percussion arrangement reminiscent of the sound of a New York City subway train departing a station and then proceeds to an oboe-dominated melody influenced by the Irish-American music used at NYPD ceremonies. Each episode had a cold open scene followed by the full-length theme song over the opening credits. The cold open and scene transitions used short instrumental breaks reminiscent of the main theme. As the series progressed, the musical start of the cold opens grew longer. By Season 7, each episode began with a fast-paced montage of typical Manhattan street scenes unrelated to the show&#x27;s characters, scored with an increasingly complex combination of scat singing and instrumental music riffing on the main theme. The specific variations were original to each episode and were not re-used. Some especially dramatic or dialogue-free scenes were scored during particular episodes, but otherwise the main body of scenes used only limited diegetic music. A section of the main theme played again over the closing credits.

==Plot==
===Season 1===
John Kelly and Andy Sipowicz are detectives in the 15th squad. Sipowicz is the elder partner, but is an alcoholic who drinks on the job, as well as off duty, and his behavior causes doubt that the partnership will last much longer. Kelly has a genuine affection for his partner, but becomes increasingly exasperated by Sipowicz&#x27;s behavior. In addition to his alcoholism, Sipowicz is a deeply negative, misogynist, homophobic bigot. In the pilot, Sipowicz is shot by a suspect he had attacked and humiliated earlier. This leads to his decision to sober up and save his job. While Sipowicz is recuperating, the squad&#x27;s lieutenant, Arthur Fancy, teams Kelly with a young cop from Anticrime, James Martinez.

Kelly&#x27;s personal life is as frenetic as his professional life. He is reluctantly going through a divorce from his wife, Laura, and is embarking on an affair with a uniformed cop, Janice Licalsi. To complicate matters further, Licalsi&#x27;s police-officer father is on the payroll of mob boss Angelo Marino. Licalsi, in an attempt to protect her father, has been ordered to do a &quot;hit&quot; on Kelly. Instead, Licalsi murders Marino, and the repercussions come back to haunt both Kelly and her.

Sipowicz, meanwhile, sobers up and begins a relationship with ADA Sylvia Costas. The other detective in the squad, Greg Medavoy, a married man, embarks on an affair with the squad&#x27;s new administrative aide, Donna Abandando.

===Season 2===

Licalsi is found guilty of the manslaughter of Marino and his driver, and is given a two-year sentence. Because of Kelly&#x27;s involvement with Licalsi, and the widely held belief that he withheld evidence that could have given her a longer sentence, he is transferred out of the 15th to working as a dispatcher and subsequently chooses to leave the department altogether. He is replaced by Bobby Simone, a widower whose previous job was that of driver for the police commissioner. This does not sit well with Sipowicz, but after learning that Simone took the assignment to be present for his wife, who was suffering from cancer, Sipowicz learns to accept his new partner and eventually builds a strong friendship with him. When Sipowicz&#x27;s relationship with Sylvia leads to marriage, he asks Simone to be his best man.

After an affair with a journalist whom he suspects has used information that he disclosed to her after an intimate moment to boost her career, Simone begins a relationship with another new member of the squad, Diane Russell. Sipowicz, as a recovering alcoholic, recognizes from Russell&#x27;s behavior that she also has a drinking problem. After much prompting, she begins attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). In another storyline, due to his low self-esteem and disbelief that a woman like Donna could love him, Medavoy&#x27;s relationship with her breaks down, due in no small part to Donna&#x27;s visiting sister.

===Season 3===
At the beginning of the season, Sylvia becomes pregnant with Andy&#x27;s child. A baby boy, Theo, is born towards the end of the season. This is contrasted with the fate that awaits Sipowicz&#x27;s older son, Andy Jr., who announces that he plans to join the police force in nearby Hackensack, New Jersey, after being discharged from the Air Force due to an injury. Sipowicz is finally bonding with his long-estranged son when Andy Jr. is gunned down trying to help people in a bar holdup. This causes the elder Sipowicz to fall off the wagon. Simone kills Andy Jr.&#x27;s murderers in an act of self-defense while attempting to arrest them.

Bobby and Diane, who had placed their relationship on hold while she attended AA, resume seeing each other. Diane begins drinking again when her abusive father beats her mother. Her father is eventually killed, and her mother becomes the prime suspect.

James Martinez and new detective Adrienne Lesniak begin an affair, but Lesniak later breaks it off, because her last relationship with a fellow cop ended disastrously, and tells Medavoy (Martinez&#x27;s partner and the squad gossip) that she is gay. After James is shot, recovers, and returns to work, and Lesniak and he get to know each other, she admits that the story she told Medavoy was a lie. Martinez later breaks up with her due to her controlling and unpleasant behavior, and Lesniak eventually leaves the squad. Medavoy leaves his wife, recognizing that she is holding him back, but it is too late to save his relationship with Donna, who leaves to take a job with Apple in California.

===Seasons 4–5===

During the next two seasons, a few minor cast changes are made: Donna is replaced by several PAAs, most notably by Gina Colon (played by Lourdes Benedicto), who eventually marries Martinez and is written out; and Det. Jill Kirkendall (played by Andrea Thompson) is partnered with Russell. Sipowicz&#x27;s battle with prostate cancer and the up-and-down Simone/Russell relationship, which includes Russell&#x27;s revelation that she had been sexually abused by her father, are prominent storylines. Also during this time, Franz won four Emmy Awards, and both Delaney and Clapp won an Emmy for supporting roles.

===Seasons 6–8===
Season six is a major turning point for the series, as Smits decided not to renew his contract and left the show. In episode five, &quot;Heart and Souls&quot;, just episodes after marrying Russell, Simone dies due to an enlarged heart and a subsequent infection caused by complications from a heart transplant. Smits was replaced by Rick Schroder, as Det. Danny Sorenson.

Two additional critical incidents occur during season six, the heroin overdose death of PAA Dolores Mayo (played by Lola Glaudini), and the death of Costas, who is accidentally gunned down by Mayo&#x27;s distraught father at the trial of the suspect accused in Mayo&#x27;s death. Costas&#x27;s final words to Sipowicz, &quot;Take care of the baby&quot;, led to his initial withdrawal from the squad. Yet, his keen perceptiveness allows him to gain a confession from the suspect in Mayo&#x27;s death, who had tried to buy his way out of trouble. Furthermore, Sipowicz reaches a level of understanding with PAA John Irvin (portrayed by Bill Brochtrup), whose homosexuality had been a stumbling block for Sipowicz in their interactions to that point.

The next two seasons had the continuation of Sipowicz&#x27;s relationship with Sorenson (in whom Sipowicz sees a resemblance to his late son), along with more changes in the squad. Departing during this time were Kirkendall (due to her unknowing involvement in her ex-husband&#x27;s dirty dealings), Martinez (following his promotion to uniformed sergeant), Fancy as squad leader (following his promotion to captain), and Russell (for a leave of absence to grieve the loss of Simone). Arriving to replace them are Det. Baldwin Jones (played by Henry Simmons), Det. Connie McDowell (played by Charlotte Ross), and Lt. Tony Rodriguez (played by Esai Morales). Also arriving in season eight was new full-time ADA Valerie Haywood (played by Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon).

At the end of season eight, Sorenson is approached by the owners of a strip club to work for them providing information. Still reeling from Russell&#x27;s abruptly ending their brief affair, he accepts the offer. After reporting to Lt. Rodriguez, Sorenson goes undercover, but then goes missing, after a stripper he was seeing turns up dead in his apartment (though not by his doing). The Sorenson character was written out at the start of season nine, at Schroder&#x27;s request; he wanted to spend more time with his family.
===Seasons 9–12===
Season nine initially tied-in with the September 11 terrorist attacks. In the &quot;Sorenson missing&quot; storyline, continuing from the previous season, a suspect trades immunity for a robbery and shooting in exchange for information on a buried rug in Brooklyn that turns out to contain Sorenson&#x27;s dead body.

Assisting on the investigation is Officer John Clark Jr., played by Mark-Paul Gosselaar. He is promoted to detective third grade for his heroic actions in the shootout that ended with the death of the hitman who had murdered Danny and an undercover federal agent; Sipowicz is promoted to detective first grade at the same time. Fancy had previously recommended Sipowicz for first grade at the same time as Simone for a high-profile case they both worked several years earlier; while Simone was promoted, the negative incidents in his past caused the department to deny Sipowicz&#x27;s promotion.

The newly minted Det. Clark becomes Sipowicz&#x27;s newest (and greenest) partner. As had occurred with Simone and Sorenson, initially tension exists between Clark and Sipowicz, largely due to an old feud from years earlier involving Sipowicz and Clark&#x27;s father, John Clark Sr. (Joe Spano), an average, by-the-book detective from a low crime precinct, who is enraged that his son chose to join the 15th Precinct to work with Andy. Season nine also has the introduction of Det. Rita Ortiz (played by Jacqueline Obradors). Two other actresses were first cast in roles as young, Latina detectives who were intended to be regular cast members; one was dropped in the pre-filming process over creative differences, and Vanessa Marcil made an appearance as Det. Maria Olivera in the Season 9 premiere, with the possibility of becoming a regular cast member. Producers were not convinced about Marcil, and made her character a one-time guest role, then continued casting until they hired Obradors. (Marcil did come back for another one-episode guest spot in Season 11).

The remaining four years had a continuing focus on Sipowicz as the main character, as had been the case since Simone&#x27;s death. Another unlikely romance developed between Sipowicz and Connie McDowell. This came about due to her ability to stand up to Sipowicz&#x27;s gruffness, and her tender relationship with Theo (played by Austin Majors). They eventually married, and after adopting McDowell&#x27;s sister&#x27;s baby daughter (following the sister&#x27;s murder by her husband, Connie&#x27;s brother-in-law), had a child of their own. The McDowell character eventually became an off-screen character in the second half of the 11th season and throughout the final season due to issues between Ross and show executives.

Rodriguez was written out halfway through the 11th season, after his IAB enemy Capt. Pat Fraker shot and nearly killed him in a drunken rage, then was acquitted; the acquittal, combined with him not making the Captain&#x27;s promotion list, caused him to retire and take a lucrative job in private security. Sgt. Eddie Gibson, played by former NYPD officer John F. O&#x27;Donohue, replaced Lt. Rodriguez as Squad Commander. Gibson had previously served in the squad both on night watch and briefly on the &quot;day tour&quot;. Haywood, after failing to convict Fraker for Rodriguez&#x27;s shooting, appeared in fewer episodes and then left at the end of the 11th season. Kelly Ronson, played by Jessalyn Gilsig, replaced McDowell and appeared in a handful of episodes in the closing stretch of Season 11. Ronson was never a main-credits character and did not return in Season 12. Lt. Thomas Bale, played by Currie Graham, replaced Gibson at the start of season 12. Det. Laura Murphy, played by Bonnie Somerville, replaced Ronson.

In the final few episodes, the storylines revolved around the impending retirement of Det. Medavoy and Sipowicz&#x27;s promotion to Sergeant and later assumption of command of the 15th Detective Squad. The series finale introduced two new young detectives named Quinn and Slovak, who echoed the first days of Irish-American Kelly and Polish-American Sipowicz.

==Controversy==

The series included more nudity and raw language than was common on broadcast television, which resulted in at least 30 of the network&#x27;s affiliates—mostly in smaller markets—not running the series when it debuted, with the show airing in many of those markets on a Fox affiliate or independent station live or delayed. 29 of the affiliates eventually saw the show&#x27;s ratings overrule their moral objections and began to air it by the time the third season started. WLOX in Biloxi, Mississippi was the only ABC affiliate that never aired any episodes of the series, choosing to pre-empt it with double-run syndicated sitcoms and leaving Fox affiliate WXXV-TV to run it instead.

In 2005, L. Brent Bozell III told &quot;TIME&quot; that the nudity on the series influenced him to establish the Parents Television Council, for which he served as president from 1995 to 2006. The PTC has directly criticized several episodes of the show for perceived vulgarity and filed complaints with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) over the use of obscene language in several episodes aired in early 2003, at the last half of the 10th season of the show, associating the series with a perceived increase in profanity and violence on prime-time television from the late 1990s to early 2000s. The FCC ruled that the language in the episodes was indecent but decided not to fine ABC, because the episodes aired before a 2004 ruling that obscenities would lead to an automatic fine. However, on January 25, 2008, the FCC fined ABC $1.4 million for the episode &quot;Nude Awakening&quot; (airdate February 25, 2003), due to scenes of &quot;adult sexual nudity&quot;. The fine was ultimately rejected by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on January 6, 2011.

According to &quot;NYPD Blue: A Final Tribute&quot;, a retrospective broadcast aired the same night as the last episode, the controversy was not limited to what was on the screen. David Milch, the show&#x27;s co-creator and head writer, was a controversial figure on the set during the seven years he was with the show. His working style and tendency to procrastinate or make last-minute, on-set changes contributed to a frustrating working environment for some of the cast and crew. Smits left the show when his contract ended because of it, as did Andrea Thompson. Milch cites his own alcoholism and other addictions as factors contributing to the difficult environment. His personal problems and &quot;exhaustion&quot; over the lengthy production of the episodes caused him to leave the series after the seventh season. In spite of the controversy, Milch is usually credited as a major creative force during the years he worked on the show; he won two Emmy Awards for his writing, shared another as executive producer, and shared in a further 10 nominations for his writing and production.

==Awards and nominations==

&quot;NYPD Blue&quot; has won 84 out of 285 award nominations. The series has garnered 84 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, winning 20 of them. Of the 20 wins, the series won the award for Outstanding Drama Series; Dennis Franz won four times for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series; Kim Delaney won for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series; Gordon Clapp won for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series; Shirley Knight and Debra Monk each won for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series and Paris Barclay won twice for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series. It has received thirteen Golden Globe Award nominations, with David Caruso, Franz and Jimmy Smits each winning for Best Actor – Television Series Drama and the series winning Best Television Series – Drama. The series received 23 Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, with Franz winning twice for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series and the cast winning for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; received 13 TCA Award nominations, winning once for Outstanding Achievement in Drama. Additional accolades include two Peabody Awards, the Producers Guild of America Award for Best Episodic Drama, the Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Episodic Drama, and the Satellite Award for Best Television Series – Drama.

==Critical reception==
&quot;NYPD Blue&quot; has generally received rave reviews from leading television critics. &quot;Variety&quot; even went as far as to say that broadcast television had lost its edge after &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; was cancelled. In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; placed the series at number 44 on its list of the 60 best television shows of all time, and &quot;Complex&quot; ranked it as the eighth best television drama of all time.

=== Average seasonal ratings ===


==Home media==
20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the first four seasons of &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; on DVD in Regions 1, 2, and 4. All of the sets contain the original master recordings, the original ABC broadcasts, and custom-made credits. After the release of the fourth season in 2006, Fox announced that they would be reviewing the possibility of further releases, citing the lack of sales.

On October 3, 2013, it was announced that Shout! Factory had acquired the rights to the series in Region 1. They have subsequently released seasons five to 12 on DVD.

In Region 2, Mediumrare acquired the rights to release the remaining eight seasons of the show on DVD in the United Kingdom.

Seasons 1-12 are available on Hulu, the American subscription video on demand service. However, the first six seasons are remastered in HD and cropped from 4:3 to 16:9, in similar fashion to &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. All 12 seasons are also available on Amazon Prime in their original formats (as of August 2023).

In Australia and New Zealand, all twelve seasons are streaming on Disney+ in 16:9. The same cropping is present for the UK and Ireland.
==Legacy== 
TV reviewer and author Alan Sepinwall informally began his career by blogging recaps and analyses of &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; episodes.

== Sequel ==
The sequel of the series was announced in October 2018. The pilot is a co-production between 20th Century Fox TV, which was behind the original series, and ABC Studios, and producers were casting its four main roles at the time of the announcement. The storyline would revolve around the murder of Andy Sipowicz, with his son Theo as a uniformed police officer who works to earn promotion to detective while investigating his father&#x27;s killing.

On May 10, 2019, it was reported that the sequel&#x27;s pilot would be retooled for a potential midseason pickup. On January 30, 2020, it was reported that the sequel was no longer in active development at ABC.

<doc id="163254" wikidata="Q17103697" url="?curid=163254" title="In Sickness and in Health">
<text>In Sickness &amp; In Health is a BBC television sitcom that ran between 1 September 1985 and 3 April 1992. It is a sequel to the successful &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;, which ran between 1966 and 1975, and &quot;Till Death...&quot;, which ran for one series of six episodes in 1981. The series includes 47 episodes, and, unlike its predecessor, all the episodes have survived and are available on DVD.

The show&#x27;s theme tune was performed by Chas and Dave and two versions of the lyrics were used – the original version in Series 1 and then revised from Series 2 onward to reflect the Else Garnett character&#x27;s death. The lyrics were changed again for the episodes set in Australia during the fourth series.

==Episode guide ==
===Series 1 (1985)===
This comedy series debuted in 1985 and took the former &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; characters Alf Garnett (Warren Mitchell) and his wife Else (Dandy Nichols) from their Wapping house to a lower-class one-level flat in West Ham. Else now uses a wheelchair due to Nichols&#x27; real-life ill health.

The council sends a black, gay man named Winston (Eamonn Walker), to do the housework and help care for Else. Despite Alf&#x27;s dual prejudices against Winston, eventually the two become used to one another, and Winston takes Alf to watch his beloved West Ham United. Nevertheless, Alf gives Winston the nickname &quot;Marigold&quot;.

Alf and Else&#x27;s daughter Rita (Una Stubbs) now lives with her husband Mike in his home town of Liverpool and often visits her parents, although Mike does not appear (as Tony Booth had no interest in reprising the role). Usually, Alf is seen drinking with his friend Arthur (Arthur English) in the local pub.

Although his beloved Conservative Party has returned to power, Alf is not happy with Margaret Thatcher being Prime Minister because, according to him, &quot;a woman&#x27;s place is in the home&quot;. He is also unhappy about Else needing to use a wheelchair and the fact he has to push her around everywhere and that, after a lifetime of hard work and paying contributions to the Welfare State, he has to fight the social security system for a decent living allowance.

Across the road lives Fred Johnson (Ken Campbell), a man stubborn like Alf, with whom he rarely gets along. When angry, Johnson bumps his head on the wall. His wife (first played by Eileen Kennally, from Series 1 to 3, then by Tricia Kelly in Series 4 and 5, and Yvonne D&#x27;Alpra in Series 6) suffers from anxiety. Much of the comedy surrounding the Johnsons is based on Mrs. Johnson&#x27;s sympathy towards Alf, often letting him walk all over them and much to the anger of Mr. Johnson.
===Christmas Special (1985)===
===Series 2 (1986)===
The first series ended on 13 October 1985 and was very popular in the ratings. On Boxing Day a Christmas special was aired, which was also successful. On 6 February 1986 Dandy Nichols died, aged 78.

When Dandy Nichols died, the decision was taken to continue the series, as the ratings and audience appreciation had been excellent. By the first episode of series two, her character has died of natural causes. Left alone after all the other mourners have gone home, Alf, the belligerent old curmudgeon who always treated his wife appallingly, gently touches the handle of her (now empty) wheelchair and sobs &quot;Silly old moo!&quot;. However, Alf quickly discovers his state pension has been cut (along with entitlement to other social security benefits) as a result of Else&#x27;s death. The lyrics of the theme tune (performed by Chas and Dave) were changed to reflect this:
&lt;poem&gt;
Now my &#x27;ol darlin, they&#x27;ve laid her down to rest
And now I&#x27;m missing &#x27;er with all me heart
But they don&#x27;t give a monkeys down the DHSS
And they&#x27;ve cornered half me pension for a start
So it won&#x27;t be very long until I&#x27;m by her side
Cos I&#x27;ll probably starve to death that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll do
For richer or for poorer – Bloody poorer that&#x27;s a fact!
That&#x27;s &#x27;cos in sickness and in health I said &quot;I do&quot;
In sickness and in health I said &quot;I do&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;
In series two, Carmel McSharry became a permanent member of the cast playing Mrs Hollingbery, a gossipy, Catholic pensioner who lives in the flat upstairs. She did make an appearance in the first series but this was very low-key, and she had not been named as Mrs Hollingbery either yet. Alf and Mrs Hollingbery don&#x27;t get on at first but later become close. The roles of the Johnsons increased, and several recurring characters were added including Mr Rabinsky (a tightfisted Jew), Mr Kittel (Renu Setna) a Muslim shopkeeper, Winston&#x27;s cousin, and the milkman. Alf&#x27;s crazy former neighbour Min Reed (Patricia Hayes) also returns for one episode, along with her sister Gwenneth (Irene Handl). 
===Christmas Special (1986)===
===Series 3 (1987)===
During the third series, Rita divorces Mike and moves back to London to marry a doctor (although Una Stubbs did not appear in the show after series two). Eamonn Walker also left at the end of series three. Three characters from the 1970s &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; also made a comeback - Mrs. Carey and her henpecked husband Wally (Pat Coombs and Hugh Lloyd, although Wally was now named Harry). Min also returns for an appearance, along with her sister Gwenneth who makes her second and final appearance in the series, as Handl died later that year. 
===Christmas Special (1987)===
===Series 4 (1989) ===
Alf gets a new lodger, Pele, and Mrs Hollingbery starts to get closer to Alf. Eventually, Alf begins courting her and they are soon engaged. Mrs Hollingberry learns that as a couple, they can purchase their house for £20,000. Later in the series, with Arthur in tow, they travel to the Outback to meet her wealthy long-lost brother Ricky (John Bluthal) so they can get his blessing on their engagement and provide them the money towards the purchase of the house. Alf soon comes to blows with her brother and they have a fight at a drinks party to celebrate his engagement to Mrs Hollingberry. Ricky expels them and sends them back to London with their plans in disarray.

===Christmas Special (1989)===
===Series 5 (1990) ===
Series five was broadcast in 1990. These episodes focused on the build-up to Alf and Mrs. Hollingberry&#x27;s big day which would end in disaster when the pair fall out at the altar over the &quot;revised terms and conditions&quot; of the ceremony. Alf objecting to the removal of the &quot;I obey&quot; clause by the wife. Just as she rejects and abandons him in the church, Alf is reminded by Fred that he has had a &quot;lucky escape&quot;, to which Alf angrily replies, &quot;What do you mean? I could have watched the bloody football!!&quot;.

===Christmas Special (1990)===
===Series 6 (1992) ===
In 1992, after over a year off the air, the sitcom returned for the sixth and final series of seven episodes in which Alf discovers a ton of banknotes and becomes very rich. During the final series, Arthur did not appear, due to Arthur English suffering from ill health, and so Alf gained a new friend, the Irishman Michael (played by James Ellis). Tricia Kelly departed, so Mrs. Johnson runs off with another woman. The character did briefly appear in this series, but was portrayed by Yvonne D&#x27;Alpra (the third person to play the role). The last episode aired on 3 April 1992.

==History==

===Cancellation===
On 29 September 1993, despite talks about the 7th series going forward, the show got axed by the BBC due to Alf&#x27;s behaviour.

===After the cancellation===
Warren Mitchell would continue to perform as Alf Garnett on special occasions; this meant on stage in front of a live audience, and similarly to an invited audience consisting largely of celebrities and public figures.

In 1997, a number of special shows were arranged for Granada Television, in which Alf would be in his front room in the company of Mrs Hollingberry or in the pub with a drinking partner. The material was written by Johnny Speight and Alf now grumbles about the Labour Party being returned to power under Tony Blair.

After Johnny Speight&#x27;s death in 1998, Warren Mitchell decided that he no longer wanted to play Alf.

===International versions===
In 1991 a Dutch version of the series, &quot;In voor en tegenspoed&quot; (&quot;In good times and in bad&quot;), debuted on Dutch TV. According to the end credits only the first 12 episodes are based on Speight&#x27;s original scripts. Two more series of episodes were written by Paul-Jan Nelissen and Marc Nelissen. The Dutch Alf Garnett is called Fred Schuit (played by Rijk de Gooyer). He lives in Amsterdam, supports AFC Ajax, drinks jenever for medicinal reasons, and does not trust a TV-set unless it is made in Eindhoven. The series was awarded two Awards of the Dutch Academy.

<doc id="163256" wikidata="Q5215774" url="?curid=163256" title="Dandy Nichols">
<text>Dandy Nichols (born Daisy Sander; 21 May 1907 – 6 February 1986) was an English actress best known for her role as Else Garnett, the long-suffering wife of the character Alf Garnett, in the BBC sitcom &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;.

== Early life and career ==
Born Daisy Sander in Fulham, London, she started her working life as a secretary in a London factory. Twelve years later, after drama, diction and fencing classes, she was spotted in a charity show by a producer, who offered her a job in his repertory theatre company in Cambridge. During her early career on stage she acted under the name Barbara Nichols but later changed it to Dandy, her childhood nickname.

When the Second World War broke out, Nichols returned to office work but later undertook a six-week tour with ENSA. When the war was over, she returned to the theatre and also began appearing in films: usually comedies and almost invariably as a maid or charlady. The latter role she took on in the music video &quot;Goody Two Shoes&quot; by Adam Ant.

Nichols&#x27;s successes in theatre include the Royal Court Theatre and Broadway productions of &quot;Home&quot;. Her big screen debut was in &quot;Hue and Cry&quot;, in 1947, followed with performances in &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;, &quot;The Fallen Idol&quot;, &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot;, &quot;The History of Mr Polly&quot;, &quot;Scott of the Antarctic&quot;, &quot;Mother Riley Meets the Vampire&quot; and Dickens&#x27; &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;.

== &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; ==
Dandy Nichols&#x27;s best-known role was Else Garnett in the landmark series &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;, where she played the long-suffering wife of the character Alf Garnett who was a parody of a working class Tory. The part was originally played in the pilot episode for the series (as part of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot;) by future &quot;EastEnders&quot; actress Gretchen Franklin. However, when it was commissioned as a series, Franklin was unable to break her contract for a West End play and Nichols was cast.

Nichols&#x27;s role seemed, at first, almost negligible: spending the best part of one early episode reading the telephone book as Alf embarked on another of his tirades. However, Else proved to be a perfect foil for Alf, and could put him down effortlessly with a withering look or cutting remark. Perhaps her finest hour – in an episode shown by the BBC in tribute to Dandy in 1986 – was when, in 1974, Else took a leaf out of Prime Minister Edward Heath&#x27;s book and went on a &quot;three-day week&quot;, forcing Alf to fend for and feed himself on her days off.

In the original scripts, Alf was to refer to his wife as a &quot;silly cow&quot;. This was firmly vetoed by BBC Head of Comedy Frank Muir, who thought this was inappropriate. Nichols said that it was &quot;a lot of silly fuss about a silly moo&quot; which was overheard by script writer Johnny Speight and became the series&#x27; most enduring catchphrase.

==&quot;In Sickness and in Health&quot;==
&quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; came to an end in 1975 but was revived in 1981, entitled &quot;Till Death...&quot;, and again in 1985. Nichols agreed to appear, but had been suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and had to use a wheelchair. Her illnesses were written into the scripts, and the series was appropriately renamed &quot;In Sickness and in Health&quot;. The series continued after her death, with Alf left on his own.

==Film career==
Nichols appeared in numerous films, which included &quot;Carry On Doctor&quot;, &quot;Ladies Who Do&quot;, &quot;The Holly and the Ivy&quot;, &quot;The Vikings&quot;, the Beatles&#x27; film &quot;Help!&quot;, &quot;Georgy Girl&quot;, &quot;Doctor in Clover&quot;, &quot;The Birthday Party&quot;, &quot;The Bed Sitting Room&quot;, &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot;, &quot;Confessions of a Window Cleaner&quot; and &quot;Britannia Hospital&quot; amongst others.

==Later years==
After her role in &quot;Till Death Do Us Part&quot;, Nichols found work in television, notably playing opposite Alastair Sim in William Trevor&#x27;s production of &quot;The Generals Day&quot;. She made appearances in &quot;Flint&quot;, &quot;The Tea Ladies&quot; and &quot;Bergerac&quot;. On stage, she appeared in Ben Travers&#x27;s comedy &quot;Plunder&quot;, as well as playing alongside Sir Ralph Richardson and Sir John Gielgud in David Storey&#x27;s &quot;Home&quot;, in both London and on Broadway.

==Personal life==
Nichols was married to the newspaper editor Stephen Bagueley Waters in 1942, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1955.

Nichols&#x27;s poor health led to a fall in her flat and she died three days later of pneumonia and heart disease on 6 February 1986 aged 78 at the London Hospital, Whitechapel.

<doc id="163257" wikidata="Q508514" url="?curid=163257" title="Teófilo Stevenson">
<text>Teófilo Stevenson Lawrence (; 29 March 1952 – 11 June 2012) was a Cuban amateur boxer who competed from 1966 to 1986.

Stevenson won the Val Barker Trophy (1972) as well was honored with the Olympic Order (1987) and is one of only three boxers to win three Olympic gold medals – alongside the Hungarian László Papp and the fellow Cuban Félix Savón.

== Early life ==

Teófilo Stevenson Lawrence was born in Puerto Padre, Cuba. His father, Teófilo Stevenson Patterson, was an immigrant from Saint Vincent. His mother Dolores Lawrence was a native Cuban, but her parents were immigrants from the Anglophone island of Saint Kitts. Teófilo senior arrived in Cuba in 1923, finding work wherever he could, before settling in Camagüey with Dolores, where he gave English lessons to top up his meagre earnings. Due to his large size, Teófilo senior was encouraged into boxing by local trainers, fighting seven times before becoming disillusioned by the corrupt payment structure on offer to young fighters.

Teófilo junior was a shiftless but bright child who at nine years old soon found himself sparring at the makeshift open-air gym his father had frequented. Under the tutelage of former national light heavyweight champion John Herrera, Teófilo junior began his career fighting far more experienced boxers, but according to Herrera, &quot;had what it took&quot;. Despite his growing involvement in the sport, Stevenson had yet to tell his mother about his activities. Eventually Teófilo Sr. broke the news to his wife, who was furious; but she agreed to acquiesce on the provision that the boy was accompanied by his father.

==Boxing career==
===Beginnings===

The young Stevenson continued to improve under Herrera in the mid-1960s, winning a junior title and gaining additional training in Havana. His victories drew the attention of Andrei Chervonenko, a head coach in Cuba&#x27;s newly implemented state sports system. Professional sports throughout the island had been outlawed since 1962 by government resolution 83-A, and all boxing activity had come under the guidance of the government sponsored National Boxing Commission. Chervonenko, a retired boxer himself, sent by the Soviet Union, who had created Cuba&#x27;s &quot;Escuela de Boxeo&quot; (Boxing school) in a derelict old gym in Havana, began to champion Stevenson&#x27;s progress.

Stevenson&#x27;s senior boxing career began at age seventeen with a defeat in the national championships against the experienced heavyweight Gabriel Garcia. Despite the setback, Stevenson went on to register convincing victories over Nancio Carrillo and Juan Perez, two of Cuba&#x27;s finest boxers in the weight division, securing a place in the national team for the 1970 Central American and Caribbean Boxing Championships. Defeat in the final after three victories was considered no shame, and Stevenson firmly established himself as Cuba&#x27;s premier heavyweight. Back in the gym Chervonenko and leading Cuban boxing coach Alcides Sagarra worked on Stevenson&#x27;s jab, which became his ultimate weapon, and paid dividends when the Cuban easily defeated East Germany&#x27;s Bernd Anders in front of a surprised Berlin crowd. The victory made the entire amateur boxing world take notice of Stevenson as a serious heavyweight contender.

===Munich Olympics 1972===
Stevenson, now twenty, joined the Cuban boxing team for the Munich Olympics of 1972. His opening bout against experienced Polish fighter Ludwik Denderys began dramatically when Stevenson knocked the other man down within thirty seconds of the opening bell. The fight was stopped moments later due to a large cut next to the Pole&#x27;s eye.

Proceeding to the quarter finals, Stevenson met American boxer Duane Bobick. Bobick, a gold medalist at the 1971 Pan American Games, had beaten Stevenson previously. After a close first round, Stevenson lost the second, but a ferocious display in the third round knocked Bobick to the canvas three times and the contest was stopped. The victory was viewed on television throughout Cuba, and is still considered Stevenson&#x27;s most memorable performance.

Stevenson easily defeated German Peter Hussing in the semifinal by TKO in the second round, and received his gold medal after Romanian Ion Alexe failed to appear in the final due to injury. The Cuban boxing team won three gold medals, their first in Olympic boxing history, as well as one silver and one bronze. The Munich games established Cuba&#x27;s dominance over the amateur sport that was to last decades. It also established Stevenson as the world&#x27;s premier amateur heavyweight boxer.

Less than two years after his successful performance at the Munich Olympics, Stevenson, then 22-years-old, was rewarded with a house for himself in Havana and another for himself and his family in Delicias. Stevenson later recalled: &quot;I had no idea the house in Delicias was going to be so big. When I was shown the plans, I said, &#x27;What is this? A bunker? AIBA president Anwar Chowdhry, when asked did the Cuban authorities acted properly in giving Stevenson two houses and two cars, said: &quot;These things should not be allowed. If gifts are to be given it should be for everybody—not for a few.&quot; Over tea in his office in Havana&#x27;s Sports City Coliseum, INDER president Conrado Martínez Corona defended the local practice of giving cars and apartments to top athletes. &quot;Our country has the obligation of solving the problems of all citizens—the problems of their nourishment, housing, education and health&quot;, he said. &quot;It&#x27;s a pity we can&#x27;t solve this problem in the way we need to for everybody.&quot;

===Prime years===
Stevenson did the same at the inaugural 1974 World Championships in Havana, Cuba, and then in the 1976 Summer Olympics, held in Montreal, Stevenson repeated the feat once again. By then, he had become a national hero in Cuba. This was the point where he was the closest to signing a professional contract, as American fight promoters offered him US$5 million to challenge world heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali. If he had accepted, it would have made Stevenson the second boxer to go straight from the Olympics into a professional debut with the world&#x27;s heavyweight crown on the line, after Pete Rademacher. Stevenson refused the offer, however, asking &quot;What is one million dollars compared to the love of eight million Cubans?&quot; Stevenson went to the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow and became the second boxer ever, after Papp, to win three Olympic boxing gold medals. The Moscow Games were the 19th occurrence of the modern Olympic Games.

Stevenson participated at the 1982 World Amateur Boxing Championships in Munich, but lost to the eventual silver medalist and future professional world champion Francesco Damiani from Italy. This fight ended an eleven-year unbeaten run by Stevenson and was the only occasion that he did not win the gold medal at the World Championships when he entered the competition.

His loss by a split decision to Aleksandr Lukstin of the Soviet Union in the finals of the 1983 Córdova Cardín, as the Soviet head coach Kontsantin Koptsev later admitted, was due to a plaster-like tape they handwrapped Lukstin&#x27;s fists with instead of a regular elastic-band hand wrapping.

Stevenson might have won a fourth gold medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics, but the Soviet Union boycotted the games, which were hosted by Los Angeles, in retaliation for the American boycott of the 1980 Moscow competition. Cuba followed the Soviet lead, and Stevenson did not compete. For consolation, he beat future Olympic champion Tyrell Biggs in February 1984 (breaking three ribs in the process) and won the super heavyweight gold at the 1984 Friendship Games, defeating Ulli Kaden of East Germany and, in the final, Valeriy Abadzhyan of the Soviet Union.
At the 1986 World Amateur Boxing Championships, he won the super heavyweight gold, defeating Alex Garcia from the United States in the final. Stevenson retired from boxing shortly after the 1988 Summer Olympics, which Cuba also boycotted.

=== Rivalry with Vysotsky ===
Stevenson was known for two fights with Soviet boxer Igor Vysotsky, who defeated him twice. Vysotsky later said in an interview with &quot;East Side Boxing&quot;:
Vysotsky was the only boxer out of hundreds of Stevenson&#x27;s opponents to ever stop him, let alone by knockout, and to defeat him twice, both times in his prime, without being avenged. And on top of it, Vysotsky scored his first victory over Stevenson at the Córdova Cardín, Cubans&#x27; home tournament, where they do their best to never let any foreigner get into the finals.

Stevenson&#x27;s second loss to Vysotsky happened six weeks before his knockout winning streak at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, which ended up with victories over John Tate and Mircea Șimon. After losing to Vysotsky for a second time he said, &quot;Nobody is invincible.&quot;

He finished his twenty-years-long career having 332 fights under his belt, with a record of 302 wins, 22 losses (only 1 by knockout,) and 8 draws. Various western estimates totaling his record to 500+ fights, including there hundreds of unaccounted tough sparrings with a degree of aliveness outstanding for amateur boxing, which paid off with such an excellent career (his fearsome reputation alone brought him 22 walkover wins, and a number of byes to skip unnecessary encounters with a limited opposition.)

=== 1984 and 1988 Summer Olympics ===
Stevenson might have captured more gold medals for his country, but the Cuban government for purely political reasons boycotted the 1984 Los Angeles Games and refused to attend the 1988 Seoul Games because North Korea was not allowed to cosponsor the event.
At his prime in the 1970s, Stevenson dominance in the amateur heavyweight division coincided with Muhammad Ali&#x27;s reign as the world&#x27;s heavyweight champion in professional boxing. Stevenson was often dubbed by the American media as Ali&#x27;s &quot;Communist twin&quot;, and speculations went back and forth as to their much anticipated fight if Stevenson would accept an offer to turn pro (which in essence meant to defect and to leave Cuba permanently). Along with Pete Rademacher, he was the only amateur boxer who was offered a shot at the world&#x27;s heavyweight title in his potential pro debut. Eventually Ali spent one week in Cuba with Stevenson, but their matchup would never happen. Stevenson, when he finally met Ali, suggested to Ali to arrange a three- or four-round fight. Ali refused to fight Stevenson&#x27;s way, implying he would face him off in a standard 15-round championship bout, in which he would have an edge by outlasting his opponent (although in 1971 Ali himself invited the recent Soviet heavyweight champion Kamo Saroyan, who visited the United States, for a two-round bout). When the aging Ali was going to fight Larry Holmes in 1980, and Stevenson was making his way to the third gold medal in Moscow, Stevenson commented to the press that now it was Ali who should have insisted on a three- or four-round fight.
Stevenson turned down several lucrative offers to go pro, which came from various internationally well-known U.S. boxing kingpins, most notably from Don King and Bob Arum. King&#x27;s top rival Arum almost succeeded and came the closest to pulling off an Ali-Stevenson matchup when the Cubans accepted his $1 million offer for five three-round exhibition fights. &quot;We plan to use this money for social problems,&quot; an INDER official said at the time. But the U.S. Treasury Department did not allow the series, saying that it violated terms of the U.S. embargo against Cuba. Apart from that attempt, Arum used a Jamaican promoter, Lucien Chen, as a mediator, to propose a $1 million fight against Leon Spinks. &quot;I envisioned a fight that would be attended by the two presidents, Fidel Castro and Jimmy Carter,&quot; Chen said.

Nevertheless, Stevenson&#x27;s professional debut never did happen, because he remained loyal to the Cuban revolutionary ideals, never accepting any payday for himself, no matter how big it appeared. After knocking out three opponents at the Munich Olympics in September 1972, including Duane Bobick of the United States, Stevenson was approached by an American promoter, who offered him $1 million to turn pro on the spot. &quot;I will not trade the Cuban people for all the dollars in the world,&quot; Stevenson was heard to say. &quot;Stevenson would have been phenomenal as a pro, he could have been in the same class as Muhammad Ali or Joe Frazier. But we&#x27;ll never know,&quot; said Don King.

=== Retirement ===
Stevenson finished his sports career in 1988. He started to work as a boxing trainer and sports functionary. He worked at the National Institute for Sports, Physical Education, and Recreation (INDER,) also he served as vice president of the Cuban Boxing Federation.

== Later life ==
In 1999, Stevenson was arrested for an altercation incident at Miami International Airport where, before boarding a United Airlines chartered jet of the Cuban national boxing team, he allegedly headbutted a 41-year-old United Airlines ticket counter employee, knocking out several of his teeth. According to Stevenson, an &quot;agitator&quot; approached him at the airport shouting insults against the Cuban government. Stevenson failed to attend the subsequent court proceedings, having travelled to Havana after his release from custody while on bail. The Cuban state newspaper &quot;Trabajadores&quot; blamed what it described as the &quot;Miami mafia&quot; (i.e. Cuban exiles, whose vast diaspora reside in Florida) for provoking the incident, alleging that the Cuban American National Foundation organised a public gathering to abuse Stevenson when he returned to Miami airport after his arrest. The newspaper believed that the motives for the alleged provocation were somehow to cast a shadow upon a Cuban sports star.

== Death ==
Stevenson died on 11 June 2012 of a heart attack in Havana at the age of 60. It was first reported by Cuban state media, stating &quot;the Cuban sporting family was moved today by the passing of one of the greatest of all time&quot;.

He was survived by his two children.

A forthcoming documentary by Brin-Jonathan Butler, &quot;Split Decision&quot;, contains the last known interview with Stevenson.

<doc id="163261" wikidata="Q550291" url="?curid=163261" title="Boeing YAL-1">
<text>The Boeing YAL-1 airborne laser testbed was a modified Boeing 747-400F with a megawatt-class chemical oxygen iodine laser (COIL) mounted inside. It was primarily designed to test its feasibility as a missile defense system to destroy tactical ballistic missiles (TBMs) while in boost phase. The aircraft was designated YAL-1A in 2004 by the U.S. Department of Defense.

The YAL-1 with a low-power laser was test-fired in flight at an airborne target in 2007. A high-energy laser was used to intercept a test target in January 2010, and the following month, successfully destroyed two test missiles. Funding for the program was cut in 2010 and the program was canceled in December 2011. It made its final flight on February 14, 2012, to Davis–Monthan Air Force Base near Tucson, Arizona, to be kept in storage at the &quot;boneyard&quot; operated by the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group. It was ultimately scrapped in September 2014 after all usable parts were removed.

== Development ==

=== Origins ===

The Airborne Laser Laboratory was a less-powerful prototype installed in a Boeing NKC-135A. It shot down several missiles in tests conducted in the 1980s.

The Airborne Laser program was initiated by the US Air Force in 1996 with the awarding of a product definition risk reduction contract to Boeing&#x27;s ABL team. In 2001, the program was transferred to the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and converted to an acquisition program.

The development of the system was being accomplished by a team of contractors. Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security provides the aircraft, the management team, and the systems integration processes. Northrop Grumman was supplying the COIL, and Lockheed Martin was supplying the nose turret and the fire control system.

In 2001, a retired Air India 747-200 was acquired by the Air Force and trucked without its wings from the Mojave Airport to Edwards Air Force Base where the airframe was incorporated into the System Integration Laboratory (SIL) building at Edwards&#x27; Birk Flight Test Center, to be used to fit check and test the various components. The SIL was built primarily to test the COIL at a simulated operational altitude, and during that phase of the program, the laser was operated over 50 times, achieving lasing durations representative of actual operational engagements. These tests fully qualified the system so that it could be integrated into the actual aircraft. Following the completion of the tests, the laboratory was dismantled, and the 747-200 fuselage was removed.

The aircraft was built as a 747-400F freighter at the Boeing Everett Factory with manufacturer&#x27;s serial number 30201 and fuselage line number 1238. The aircraft took its first flight on 6 January 2000. It was shortly thereafter delivered to Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security in Wichita, Kansas for initial conversion for military use. The aircraft took to the skies again on 18 July 2002. Ground testing of the chemical oxygen iodine laser (COIL) resulted in its successful firing in 2004. The YAL-1 was assigned to the 417th Flight Test Squadron Airborne Laser Combined Test Force at Edwards AFB.

=== Testing ===
Besides the COIL, the system also included two kilowatt-class Target Illuminator Lasers for target tracking. On March 15, 2007, the YAL-1 successfully fired this laser in flight, hitting its target. The target was an NC-135E &quot;Big Crow&quot; test aircraft that has been specially modified with a &quot;signboard&quot; target on its fuselage. The test validated the system&#x27;s ability to track an airborne target and measure and compensate for atmospheric distortion.

The next phase in the test program involved the &quot;surrogate high-energy laser&quot; (SHEL), a stand-in for the COIL, and demonstrated the transition from target illumination to simulated weapons firing. The COIL system was installed in the aircraft and was undergoing ground testing by July 2008.

In an April 6, 2009 press conference, the Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recommended the cancellation of the planned second ABL aircraft and said that the program should return to a Research and Development effort. &quot;The ABL program has significant affordability and technology problems and the program&#x27;s proposed operational role is highly questionable,&quot; Gates said in making the recommendation.

There was a test launch off the California coast on June 6, 2009. At that time it was anticipated that the new Airborne Laser Aircraft could be ready for operation by 2013 after a successful test. On August 13, 2009, the first in-flight test of the YAL-1 culminated with a successful firing of the SHEL at an instrumented test missile.

On August 18, 2009 the high-energy laser aboard the aircraft successfully fired in flight for the first time. The YAL-1 took off from Edwards Air Force Base and fired its high-energy laser while flying over the California High Desert. The laser was fired into an onboard calorimeter, which captured the beam and measured its power.

In January 2010, the high-energy laser was used in-flight to intercept, although not destroy, a test &quot;Missile Alternative Range Target Instrument&quot; (MARTI) in the boost phase of flight. On February 11, 2010, in a test at Point Mugu Naval Air Warfare Center-Weapons Division Sea Range off the central California coast, the system successfully destroyed a liquid-fuel boosting ballistic missile. Less than an hour after that first missile had been destroyed, a second missile—a solid-fuel design—had, as announced by the MDA, been &quot;successfully engaged&quot;, but not destroyed, and that all test criteria had been met. The MDA announcement also noted that ABL had destroyed an identical solid-fuel missile in flight eight days earlier. This test was the first time that a directed-energy system destroyed a ballistic missile in any phase of flight. It was later reported that the first February 11 engagement required 50% less dwell time than expected to destroy the missile, the second engagement on the solid-fuel missile, less than an hour later, had to be cut short before it could be destroyed because of a &quot;beam misalignment&quot; problem.

=== Cancellation ===

Secretary of Defense Gates summarized fundamental concerns with the practicality of the program concept:

I don&#x27;t know anybody at the Department of Defense, Mr. Tiahrt, who thinks that this program should, or would, ever be operationally deployed. The reality is that you would need a laser something like 20 to 30 times more powerful than the chemical laser in the plane right now to be able to get any distance from the launch site to fire ... So, right now the ABL would have to orbit inside the borders of Iran in order to be able to try and use its laser to shoot down that missile in the boost phase. And if you were to operationalize this you would be looking at 10 to 20 747s, at a billion and a half dollars apiece, and $100 million a year to operate. And there&#x27;s nobody in uniform that I know who believes that this is a workable concept.
The Air Force did not request further funds for the Airborne Laser for 2010; Air Force Chief of Staff Schwartz has said that the system &quot;does not reflect something that is operationally viable&quot;.

In December 2011, it was reported that the project was to be ended after 16 years of development and a cost of over US$5 billion. While in its current form, a relatively low power laser mounted on an unprotected airliner may not be a practical or defensible weapon, the YAL-1 testbed is considered to have proven that air mounted energy weapons with increased range and power could be another viable way of destroying otherwise very difficult to intercept sub-orbital ballistic missiles and rockets. On 12 February 2012, the YAL-1 flew its final flight and landed at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, where it was placed in storage at the &quot;boneyard&quot; operated by the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group until it was ultimately scrapped in September 2014 after all usable parts were removed.

As of 2013, studies were underway to apply the lessons of the YAL-1 by mounting laser anti-missile defenses on unmanned combat aerial vehicles that could fly above the altitude limits of the converted jetliner.

By 2015, the Missile Defense Agency had started efforts to deploy a laser on a high-altitude UAV. Rather than a manned jetliner containing chemical fuels flying at , firing a megawatt laser from a range of &quot;tens of kilometers&quot; at a boost-phase missile, the new concept envisioned an unmanned aircraft carrying an electric laser flying at , firing the same power level at targets potentially up to &quot;hundreds of kilometers&quot; away for survivability against air defenses. While the ABL&#x27;s laser required to generate one kW, the MDA wanted to reduce that to per kW, totaling for a megawatt. Unlike the ABL, which required its crew to rest and chemical fuel to be reloaded, an electric laser would need only power generating from fuel to fire, so a UAV with in-flight refueling could have near-inexhaustible endurance and armament. A &quot;low-power demonstrator&quot; was planned to fly sometime in or around 2021. Challenges in reaching required power levels on a platform with sufficient performance led to the MDA choosing not to pursue the concept.

== Design ==
=== COIL ===
The heart of the system was the COIL, comprising six interconnected modules, each as large as an SUV. Each module weighed about 6,500 pounds (3,000 kg). When fired, the laser used enough energy in a five-second burst to power a typical American household for more than an hour.

=== Use against ICBMs vs TBMs ===
The ABL was designed for use against tactical ballistic missiles (TBMs). These have a shorter range and fly more slowly than ICBMs. The MDA had suggested the ABL might be used against ICBMs during their boost phase. This could require much longer flights to get in position, and might not be possible without flying over hostile territory. Liquid-fueled ICBMs, which have thinner skins, and remain in boost phase longer than TBMs, might be easier to destroy.

If the ABL had achieved its design goals, it could have destroyed liquid-fueled ICBMs up to 600 km away. Tougher solid-fueled ICBM destruction range would likely have been limited to 300 km, too short to be useful in many scenarios, according to a 2003 report by the American Physical Society on National Missile Defense.

=== Intercept sequence ===
The ABL system used infrared sensors for initial missile detection. After initial detection, three low-power tracking lasers calculated missile course, speed, aimpoint, and air turbulence. Air turbulence deflects and distorts lasers. The ABL adaptive optics use the turbulence measurement to compensate for atmospheric errors. The main laser, located in a turret on the aircraft nose, could be fired for 3 to 5 seconds, causing the missile to break up in flight near the launch area. The ABL was not designed to intercept TBMs in the terminal or descending flight phase. Thus, the ABL would have had to be within a few hundred kilometers of the missile launch point. All of this would have occurred in approximately 8 to 12 seconds.

=== Operational considerations ===
The ABL did not burn through or disintegrate its target. It heated the missile skin, weakening it, causing failure from high-speed flight stress. The laser used chemical fuel similar to rocket propellant to generate the high laser power. Plans called for each 747 to carry enough laser fuel for about 20 shots, or perhaps as many as 40 low-power shots against fragile TBMs. To refuel the laser, YAL-1 would have to land. The aircraft itself could have been refueled in flight, which would have enabled it to stay aloft for long periods. Preliminary operational plans called for the ABL to be escorted by fighters and possibly electronic warfare aircraft. The ABL aircraft would likely have had to orbit near potential launch sites (located in hostile countries) for long periods, flying a figure-eight pattern that allows the aircraft to keep the laser aimed toward the missiles.

=== Use against other targets ===
In theory, an airborne laser could be used against hostile fighter aircraft, cruise missiles, or even low-Earth-orbit satellites (see anti-satellite weapon). However, the YAL-1 infrared target acquisition system was designed to detect the hot exhaust of TBMs in boost phase. Satellites and other aircraft have a much lower heat signature, making them more difficult to detect. Aside from the difficulty of acquiring and tracking a different kind of target, ground targets such as armored vehicles and possibly even aircraft are not fragile enough to be damaged by a megawatt-class laser.

An analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists discusses potential airborne laser use against low Earth orbit satellites. Another program, the Advanced Tactical Laser, envisions air-to-ground use of a megawatt-class laser mounted on an aircraft better suited for low altitude flight.

<doc id="163266" wikidata="Q591309" url="?curid=163266" title="Principality of Hutt River">
<text>The Principality of Hutt River, often referred to by its former name, the Hutt River Province, was a micronation in Australia, proclaimed on 21 April 1970 when farmer Leonard Casley declared his farm to be a sovereign state, the &quot;Hutt River Province&quot;. He claimed to have seceded from Australia, which occurred during his dispute with the authorities concerning wheat production quotas. A few years later, Casley began styling himself as &quot;Prince Leonard&quot; and granting family members royal titles, although he did not include the word &quot;principality&quot; in the official name until 2006. In 2017, Casley&#x27;s claim to rulership was taken over by his son Graeme, who dropped the claim to sovereignty on 3 August 2020.

The claimed territory was located north of Perth, near the town of Northampton in the state of Western Australia. It had an area of , making it larger than several recognised countries. It was not recognised as a country by the Australian Government nor any other national government, and the High Court of Australia and Supreme Court of Western Australia rejected submissions arguing that it was not subject to Australian laws.

The &quot;principality&quot; was a regional tourist attraction until it announced it was closed to tourists after 31 January 2020. It issued its own currency, stamps and passports (which are not recognised by the federal Australian government or any other government).

Leonard Casley died on 13 February 2019.

==History==

Leonard Casley (28 August 1925 – 13 February 2019) declared the principality an independent province in 1970 in response to a dispute with the government of Western Australia over what the Casley family considered draconian wheat production quotas. The Casley farm had around of wheat ready to harvest when the quotas were issued, which allowed Casley to sell only 1,647 bushels or approximately . Initially, the five families who owned farms at Hutt River banded together to fight the quota, and Casley lodged a protest with the Governor of Western Australia, Sir Douglas Kendrew. The governor did not assist.

Two weeks later, Casley claimed that the government introduced a bill into Parliament to &quot;resume&quot; his and the other families&#x27; lands under compulsory acquisition laws. At this point, Casley claimed that international law allowed them to secede and declare independence from the Commonwealth of Australia. Casley said that he nonetheless remained loyal to Queen Elizabeth II. At about this time, Casley claimed that in correspondence with the governor-general&#x27;s office, Casley was on one occasion inadvertently addressed as the &quot;Administrator of the Hutt River Province&quot;. Casley claimed that this constituted a legally binding recognition of the principality. Shortly thereafter, Casley styled himself &quot;His Majesty Prince Leonard I of Hutt&quot;. He did this because he believed it would enable him to take advantage of the British Treason Act 1495, which provides that the &quot;de facto&quot; king of a nation cannot be guilty of treason in relation to any act against the lawful king and that anyone who interfered with that monarch&#x27;s duties could be charged with treason.

Casley said that he continued to sell his wheat in open defiance of the quota. Casley believed that under Australian law the federal government had two years to respond to Casley&#x27;s declaration of sovereignty. Casley says the failure to respond gave the province &quot;&quot;de facto&quot; autonomy&quot; on 21 April 1972, but that the Western Australian government can still dispute the secession.

On 15 February 1977, despite Casley&#x27;s claims to sovereignty, he was successfully prosecuted for failing to comply with requirements to furnish the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) with required documents.

On 2 December 1977, Casley &quot;declared war&quot; on Australia, but notified authorities of the cessation of hostilities several days later. It may be more than coincidence that this declaration of war came in just a few months after a court decision where Casley was fined for failing to furnish the ATO with certain documents. The short state of war between the principality and Australia was a scheme whereby the Prince&#x27;s purpose was to argue that, under the Geneva Treaty Convention of 12 August 1949, a government should show full respect to a nation undefeated from a state of war.

In 1978, Casley appealed to the Supreme Court of Western Australia against a conviction for conducting a shop on his property without a permit. His appeal was dismissed, except to alter the penalty.

In 1970 and 1984, Casley unsuccessfully defended civil legal actions brought against him by private parties – in the former case an injunction was granted against him in relation to a land deal; in the latter case he was ordered to pay debts owed to a publishing company he had contracted to print copies of a book called &quot;The Man&quot;, which was about himself and his achievements. Casley did not suggest in these cases that he was not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of Australia. The principality released over 50 different sets of stamps and these postage stamps have a solid global following, and coins.

In about 2006, Casley was again successfully prosecuted by the Australian Taxation Office. He sought special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia, but his application was dismissed with the comment that his arguments were &quot;fatuous, frivolous and vexatious&quot;.

In September 2006, Casley decided to change the province&#x27;s name to &quot;Principality of Hutt River&quot;.

In January 2017, Casley announced that after ruling for 45 years, he would be stepping down, to be succeeded by his youngest son, Graeme. With a number of potential sons and daughters, the successor was nominated by Casley and approved by a crown committee. Some commentary at the time had expected his older son, Ian, to be the successor.

In June 2017, Casley was ordered by the Supreme Court of Western Australia to pay $2.7 million in unpaid tax, and his son Arthur Casley was ordered to pay $242,000 in unpaid tax.

In February 2019, Casley died, leaving his son, Graeme Casley, to succeed to the throne as &quot;Prince Graeme&quot; and inherit his $2.5 million debt to the Australian Taxation Office. In December 2019, citing declining revenue from agriculture as well as a drop in tourist numbers, the principality issued a media release to announce that it would be closing its borders with effect from 31 January 2020. The principality would no longer accept visitors, would cease to issue entry and exit visas and would stand down most government services and offices for the duration of the hiatus. The announcement included the following statement: &quot;It is with a heavy heart and after much thought and consultation with my Cabinet and ADC that I have to inform all that the Government of the Principality of Hutt River is about to go on hiatus. Our borders will be closed to all (including tourists) and all government external services will cease at close of business Friday 31 January 2020 until further notice.&quot;

On 3 August 2020, the principality was formally dissolved, amidst disputes with the Australian Taxation Office demanding the principality pay millions in unpaid taxes across its 50-year history as well as the financial market impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The principality&#x27;s owned land was sold off to settle the tax dispute.

== Status ==
The principality had no legal status as a matter of Australian law. In 2007, the High Court of Australia dismissed an application by Casley for leave to appeal against a judgment against him relating to his son Leonard&#x27;s failure to file tax returns. Leonard argued that he resided in the &quot;Hutt River Province&quot; and that it is not part of Australia and not subject to Australian taxation law. The court dismissed Casley&#x27;s application and found that his arguments were &quot;fatuous, frivolous, and vexatious.&quot;

The Australian government unequivocally stated on its website that it did not recognise the secession of the principality. Passports issued by the principality were not recognised by the Australian government. Leonard made unverified claims that they have been accepted on some occasions by some unspecified foreign countries, but there was a documented instance of a man being arrested in Germany for attempting to use a Hutt River Province &quot;diplomatic passport&quot;.

Casley claimed that the ATO sent him a tax demand in 2012 to which he simply responded with a document stating that he was a &quot;foreign national and non-resident of Australia&quot;. He also repeatedly claimed that he was classed by the ATO as a &quot;non-resident of Australia for income tax purposes&quot; and did not pay tax. In 2017, however, Justice Le Miere of the Supreme Court of Western Australia ordered Leonard to pay more than A$2.7 million in unpaid taxes, and Arthur Casley to pay more than A$242,000 in unpaid taxes. The judge said that their argument of sovereignty &quot;has no legal merit or substance. Anyone can declare themselves a sovereign in their own home but they cannot ignore the laws of Australia or not pay tax.&quot; An appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed.

Despite this, the principality continued to argue that it was an independent entity within the Australian legal system. The principality tried repeatedly to use a document purporting to be a letter from the Commonwealth Department of Territories admitting that the principality was a &quot;legal entity&quot;. The Australian government noted that Casley &quot;has used the document in various countries in the past and even sent a copy of it to Senator Evans in 1993&quot;. The Australian government also told foreign governments that &quot;We have seen the purported &#x27;Department of Territories Minute&#x27; before. The clumsy language, including a Malapropian use of &#x27;a moot point&#x27; gives it away for what it is, a poorly attempted forgery.&quot;

The principality claimed that all social security benefits were withdrawn from Hutt River&#x27;s residents at the time of secession by the Australian government. It further claimed that residents did not receive pensions, medical benefits, educational allowances, child endowments, or benefits normally paid to war veterans. Voting is compulsory by law in Australia, but Casley claimed to have successfully removed the names of Hutt River residents from the Australian electoral roll. Casley admitted that he made annual payments to the Shire of Northampton, the local government authority, although he chose to characterise these payments as &quot;gifts&quot; rather than council rates. The principality said that it levied its own income tax of 0.5 per cent on financial transactions by foreign companies registered in the province and personal accounts.

There were some occasions where organisations stated that the province had some sort of sovereignty:

* The National Museum of Australia contained an exhibition on the theme of &quot;Separation&quot; within Australia which included a Hutt River Province display which stated that Casley &quot;successfully seceded from Australia&quot;.
* Judy Lattas, a sociologist at Macquarie University, once stated that &quot;many officials in Western Australia, some quite high up, and even nationally in Australia are happy to play out the myth of Hutt River&#x27;s sovereignty&quot; by attending Hutt River functions, returning correspondence, and abandoning the claim for tax.
* In 2005, the Shire of Northampton listed the principality as having &quot;high historic and social significance as the site of Australia&#x27;s only independent principality.&quot;

The principality appears on Google Maps, but only as a &quot;tourist attraction&quot;. In 2010, Brendon Grylls, Western Australian Minister for Regional Development and Lands, was asked if his state had a &quot;position&quot; on the principality. He replied, &quot;only that Prince Leonard is an enigma.&quot;

===Treatment by overseas nations===

From 1984 to 2010, Australian diplomatic missions in 28 countries exchanged 120 diplomatic cables with Australia concerning activities relating to the principality.

In 2008, the Council of the European Union issued a memorandum identifying Hutt River passports among known &quot;fantasy passports ... issued by private organisations and individuals&quot; to which a visa should not be affixed.

Hong Kong does not recognise the principality, but its corporate registry did at one point recognise the principality as a place where a company could be incorporated. The Hong Kong Registry, however, were looking at reviewing their list of accredited places for company incorporation after the issue was raised in an adverse manner by Australian media.

In 2008, a 48-year-old French man who claimed to be an ambassador representing the principality to the United Arab Emirates, his 36-year-old female compatriot and a 28-year-old Pakistani man, were charged by the UAE over issuing travel documents and selling land in the principality to UAE residents under false pretences. Casley stated the man had no diplomatic standing in the Principality and had only made a single visit to the province.

In April 2016, the principality received a letter from Queen Elizabeth II which communicated the Queen&#x27;s good wishes on the anniversary of the founding of the principality 46 years before, on 21 April 1970. The letter from Buckingham Palace was signed by Sonia Bonici, Senior Correspondence Officer. It reads in part: &quot;I am to convey Her Majesty&#x27;s good wishes to you and to all concerned for a most enjoyable and successful celebration on 23rd and 24th of April to mark the forty-sixth anniversary of the Principality of Hutt River.&quot; The Queen was replying to a letter from Casley congratulating her on her 90th birthday.

== Statistics ==
The principality was situated north of Perth, along the Hutt River. It was about in size. Exports included wildflowers, stamps and coins and agricultural produce which is also exported overseas. Tourism was also important to the economy with 40,000 tourists, predominantly from overseas countries, visiting the principality every year.

While the principality had only 23 residents, it claimed a worldwide citizenry of 14,000.

After 2 September 2004, Hutt River Province/Principality accepted company registrations. At least one company experienced in the registration of entities in traditional offshore jurisdictions (British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands etc.) as tax havens was authorised to act as a registered agent for PHR incorporations. On 29 March 2005 the Hutt River Province International Business Company announced it would accept registrations of company trusts which have since been promoted worldwide by registered financial agents. Concerned that Hutt River registrations &quot;may be sold as part of a tax avoidance or evasion arrangement&quot;, in April 2012 the Australian Taxation Office warned potential purchasers that the registrations have no legal basis and &quot;could be illegal&quot;.

In 1997, the legislation committee presented a proposal for a constitution to Casley and his cabinet. Although he and the cabinet never officially adopted the proposal, there was a decree stating that any constitution would be in effect while under consideration, except for any clauses that conflict with the bill of rights, so the proposal essentially became a provisional constitution.

==Casley family==

Leonard Casley worked for a shipping company based in Perth, although he left school at 14, and described himself as a mathematician and physicist; he also claimed to have written articles for NASA. He was an adherent of hermeticism, a subject on which he privately published a number of research papers and books. He is the subject of a permanent exhibit at the National Museum of Australia in Canberra.

Casley was married to Shirley (née Butler) until her death on 7 July 2013, when the principality went into a period of mourning, closing some of its services. She was styled as &quot;Her Royal Highness Princess Shirley of Hutt, Dame of the Rose of Sharon&quot;, and she played host to dignitaries and diplomatic representatives visiting the principality each year, as well as receiving television crews and magazine journalists. She was the patroness and chair of the board of directors of the Red Cross of Hutt, a parallel organisation to the International Red Cross.

===Princes of Hutt River===

Hutt River had two sovereign princes over its 50-year existence, Casley as &quot;Prince Leonard&quot;, and his son Graeme Casley as &quot;Prince Graeme&quot;. Both abdicated.

==Currency==
The principality&#x27;s currency was the Hutt River Dollar, which was divided into 100 cents. The Hutt River Dollar was pegged at a one-to-one ratio with the Australian Dollar. All authorised principality coins were minted by Canada&#x27;s Lombardo Mint and the New Queensland Mint.

===First series: 1976–78===

Four denominations of coins, 5c, 10c, 20c and 50c, were issued from 1976 to 1978, but the 1978 issue was a proof only issue. There was also a silver $30 coin and a gold $100 coin, struck only in proof.

===Silver Jubilee $1 coin===
In 1977, $1 coins were struck to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. These coins are known as &quot;holey dollars&quot;. Coins of the same design were struck again in 1978, without the inscription &quot;Queen&#x27;s Jubilee&quot;.

===Later series===
In 2010, the principality issued a $30 gold- and silver-plated brass coin to mark the 40th anniversary of independence. Following the death of his wife in 2013, Casley authorised a special commemorative coin to celebrate her life.

===Commemorative coins===
All of these principality coins are contained in the standard catalogue of &quot;Unusual World Coins&quot; by Colin Bruce II, edited by Tom Michael and George Cuhaj. A A$100 denomination proof commemorative coin issue that contained one troy ounce of pure palladium sold for $299 in 1989; the 2012 value of the palladium content was $630.
==Postage stamps==

Over 50 different sets of postage stamps were issued, which have a global following.

<doc id="163267" wikidata="Q1453448" url="?curid=163267" title="Free State Project">
<text>The Free State Project (FSP) is an American political migration movement founded in 2001 to recruit at least 20,000 libertarians to move to a single low-population state (New Hampshire was selected in 2003) in order to make the state a stronghold for libertarian ideas. The &quot;New Hampshire Union Leader&quot; reports that the Free State Project is not a political party but a nonprofit organization.

Participants of the FSP signed a statement of intent declaring that they intended to move to New Hampshire within five years of the drive reaching 20,000 participants. This statement of intent was intended to function as a form of assurance contract. , 20,000 people have signed this statement of intent, completing the original goal, and 1,909 people are listed as &quot;early movers&quot; to New Hampshire on the FSP website, saying they had made their move prior to the 20,000-participant trigger. In the 2017–2018 term of the 400-member New Hampshire House of Representatives, 17 seats were held by Free Staters.

The FSP is a social movement generally based upon decentralized decision making. The group hosts various events, but most of FSP&#x27;s activities depend upon volunteers and no formal plan dictates to participants or movers what their actions should be in New Hampshire.

As of May 2022, approximately 6,232 participants have moved to New Hampshire for the Free State Project.

Eric Brakey is the Executive Director of the FSP as of 2024.

==Intent==
The FSP mission statement, adopted in 2005, states: 

&quot;Life, liberty, and property&quot; are rights that were enumerated in the October 1774 Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress and in Article 12 of the New Hampshire Constitution.

To become a participant of the Free State Project, a person is asked to agree to the Statement of Intent (SOI): 

The FSP is open to people with a minimum age of 18. United States citizenship is not required. People who promote violence, racial hatred, or bigotry are not welcome in the FSP.

==History==
The Free State Project was founded in 2001 by Jason Sorens, then a Ph.D. student at Yale University. Sorens published an article in &quot;The Libertarian Enterprise&quot; highlighting the failure of libertarians to elect any candidate to federal office and outlining his ideas for a secessionist movement, calling people to respond to him with interest. Sorens soon published a follow-up article backing away from secession, &quot;and it never played a role in the FSP’s philosophy from then on.&quot; Sorens has stated that the movement continues an American tradition of political migration, which includes groups such as Mormon settlers in Utah, Amish religious communities, and the &quot;Jamestown Seventy&quot;, an earlier effort to influence the politics of a particular state through deliberate migration.

The organization began without a specific state in mind. A systematic review started by narrowing potential states to those with a population of less than 1.5 million, and those where the combined spending in 2000 by the Democratic and Republican parties was less than the total national spending by the Libertarian Party in that year, $5.2 million. Hawaii and Rhode Island were eliminated from this list because of their propensity for centralized government.

In September 2003, a vote was held, and participants voted using the minimax Condorcet method to choose the state that they were to move to. New Hampshire was the winner, with Wyoming coming in second by a 57% to 43% margin. Alaska, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Vermont were also on the list. New Hampshire was chosen because the perceived individualist culture of the state was thought to resonate well with libertarian ideals.

In 2004, following the selection of New Hampshire, a splinter group called the Free Town Project formed to move to the small town of Grafton and advocate for legal changes there. Grafton&#x27;s appeal as a favorable destination was due to its absence of zoning laws and a very low property tax rate. Additionally, it was the home of John Babiarz, a prominent member of the Libertarian Party who had twice run for Governor. Though no records were kept of the number of Free Town Project participants who moved to Grafton, the town&#x27;s population grew from 1,138 in 2000 to 1,340 in 2010. Nearly all of the newcomers were men. Project participants fashioned homes out of yurts, recreational vehicles, trailers, tents, and shipping containers. The changes they voted in included a 30% reduction in the town&#x27;s already-small budget, denying funding to the county&#x27;s senior-citizens council. The libertarian newcomers additionally increased the city&#x27;s costs by filing lawsuits against it in an attempt to set legal precedents. The project has been associated with an increase in the number and aggressiveness of black bears in town, including entering homes, mauling people, and eating pets. A single, definitive cause for the abnormal behavior of the bears has not been proven, but it may be due to libertarian residents who refuse to buy and use bear-resistant containers, who do not dispose of waste materials (such as feces) safely, or who deliberately put out food to attract the bears to their own yards, but do not feel any responsibility for how their behavior affects their neighbors.

=== Free Town Project ===

In 2005, members of the Free Town Project were also briefly involved with Mentone, Texas. Mentone is in Loving County, at the time the least populous county in the United States. Three men, Lawrence Pendarvis, Bobby Emory, and Don Duncan, claimed to have bought 126 acres (51 ha) of land and registered to vote there, although the sheriff determined that the land was not sold to the group, as no deed had been filed at the county courthouse. He contacted the sellers, who said that the land had been sold to other buyers, after which the sheriff filed misdemeanor charges against the three men and threatened to arrest them if they returned.

On February 3, 2016, the Free State Project announced via social media that 20,000 people had signed the Statement of Intent. In a press conference later that day, then FSP president Carla Gericke officially announced that the move had been triggered and that signers were expected to follow up on their pledge. This concluded the Free Town Project, and the Free State Project organization changed focus from recruiting signers to encouraging them to move to New Hampshire, stating &quot;we want 20,000 movers&quot;.

==Electoral activity==
The Free State Project is not aligned with any political party and has no official position for or against any issues or candidates. That said, however, the Free State Project is defined as a movement that seeks to relocate people of broadly libertarian ideals, specifically. It receives its funding from individual donors interested in moving as part of the FSP or in attending one of their annual events. The FSP is a tax-exempt nonprofit educational organization, falling under category 501(c)(3), so all donations since July 20, 2009, are tax-deductible.

Several early movers have been elected to the 400-member New Hampshire House of Representatives. In 2006, Joel Winters became the first known Free Stater to be elected, running as a Democrat. He was re-elected in 2008 but defeated in 2010. In 2010, 12 Free Staters were elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives, all of them as Republicans. In 2012, 11 more were elected. In 2012, elected participants wrote and passed House Bill 418 which would require state agencies to consider open source software and data formats when making acquisitions; However, the bill died in the State Senate.

In 2014, 17 Free Staters were elected. In 2016, 15 of 32 Free Stater candidates were elected. In 2017, there were 17 Free Staters in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, and, in 2021, the New Hampshire Liberty Alliance, which ranks bills and elected representatives based on their adherence to what they see as libertarian principles, scored 150 representatives as &quot;A−&quot; or above rated representatives. Participants of the FSP also engage with other like-minded activist groups such as Young Americans for Liberty and Americans for Prosperity.

In 2022, the Croydon school board president and her husband, members of the Free State Project, attempted to cut the school budget by half in a surprise but licit maneuver on the day of the vote, in a district with typically low attendance for votes. The plan that passed offered students online learning from a facilitator or $9,000 to go to an alternate public or private school. This plan was claimed to be an “adequate education” under the NH constitutional requirement. In response, local residents organized to overturn the budget. They needed more than half of the eligible voters to vote in a special election and a majority of those voters to vote for the fully-funded budget. The new school budget was overruled 377 to 2, with just under two thirds of the eligible voters motivated to go to the polls, and the original budget was restored.

===Annual events===
The Free State Project organizes two annual events in New Hampshire:
* The New Hampshire Liberty Forum, a convention-style event with a wide variety of speakers, dinners and events.
* The Porcupine Freedom Festival, commonly abbreviated to just &quot;PorcFest&quot;, a weeklong summer festival that takes place at a campground. It was described by Libertarian philosophy professor Roderick Long as &quot;like Woodstock for rational people&quot;.

==Responses==

=== Support ===
On February 17, 2006, economist Walter Block publicly expressed his support for the FSP and was quoted as saying:
Jeffrey Tucker reflected about his experiences at the New Hampshire Liberty Forum in Nashua, saying in part: &quot;If you are willing to look past mainstream media coverage of American politics, you can actually find exciting and interesting activities taking place that rise above lobbying, voting, graft and corruption&quot;.

The project was endorsed by Ron Paul and Gary Johnson. In 2010, Lew Rockwell from the Mises Institute endorsed the project and referred to the city of Keene, New Hampshire as &quot;the northern capital of libertarianism&quot;. In 2011, Peter Schiff said he had considered moving to NH at one point.

Some Republicans have responded more favorably to the project. In September 2014, Republican Party Senate nominee Scott Brown, a former United States Senator from Massachusetts, said his election campaign needed &quot;Freestaters&quot; to support him in his one-minute closing statement at the Granite State Debate.

Maine state senator Eric Brakey partially attributed the Republican Party&#x27;s 2020 election gains to the Free State Project.

=== Criticism ===
Critics argue that the Free State Project is &quot;radical&quot;, a &quot;fantasy&quot;, or that they &quot;go too far&quot; in seeking to restrict government. The project has drawn criticism from some New Hampshire residents concerned about population pressure and opposition to increased taxation. In December 2012, state representative (D-Keene) said, &quot;Free Staters are the single biggest threat the state is facing today. There is, legally, nothing we can do to prevent them from moving here to take over the state, which is their openly stated goal. In this country you can move anywhere you choose and they have that same right. What we can do is to make the environment here so unwelcoming that some will choose not to come, and some may actually leave. One way is to pass measures that will restrict the &#x27;freedoms&#x27; that they think they will find here&quot;.

During and shortly after the Free Town Project was active in Grafton County, there were three bear attacks. Several media outlets have said that there was a relationship between the Free Town Project and the bear attacks, and a book was written on the subject by local state reporter Matt Hongoltz-Hetling.

In 2012, the Concord Police Department applied for $258,000 in federal government funding to buy a Lenco BearCat armored vehicle for protection against terrorist attacks, riots, or shooting incidents. The application mentioned &quot;Free Staters&quot; alongside Sovereign Citizens and Occupy New Hampshire as groups that &quot;are active and present daily challenges&quot;. The grant from the United States Department of Homeland Security was successful, but the Concord City Council revised the application to remove references to those political movements before unanimously approving of the grant.

A 2022 survey found relatively little awareness of the Free State Project in New Hampshire but generally negative opinions among those familiar: 49% of respondents had heard of the project, while 10% expressed a favorable view and 26% an unfavorable one.

=== Media coverage ===
The Free State Project was the centerpiece of the 2011 documentary film &quot;Libertopia&quot; as well as the 2014 crowdfunded documentary &quot;101 Reasons: Liberty Lives in New Hampshire&quot;.

In 2023, NBC Boston produced and released a docu-series about the Free State Project titled &quot;Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of New Hampshire&quot;, which includes interviews from members, supporters, and critics of the Free State Project.

<doc id="163268" wikidata="Q122232" url="?curid=163268" title="Ginger Baker">
<text>Peter Edward &quot;Ginger&quot; Baker (19 August 1939 – 6 October 2019) was an English drummer. His work in the 1960s and 1970s earned him the reputation of &quot;rock&#x27;s first superstar drummer&quot;, for a style that melded jazz and African rhythms and pioneered both jazz fusion and world music.

Baker gained early fame as a member of Blues Incorporated and the Graham Bond Organisation, both times alongside bassist Jack Bruce, with whom Baker would often clash. In 1966, Baker and Bruce joined guitarist Eric Clapton to form Cream, which achieved worldwide success but lasted only until 1968, in part due to Baker&#x27;s and Bruce&#x27;s volatile relationship. After working with Clapton in the short-lived band Blind Faith and leading Ginger Baker&#x27;s Air Force, Baker spent several years in the 1970s living and recording in Africa, often with Fela Kuti, in pursuit of his long-time interest in African music. Among Baker&#x27;s other collaborations are his work with Gary Moore, Masters of Reality, Public Image Ltd, Hawkwind, Atomic Rooster, Bill Laswell, jazz bassist Charlie Haden, jazz guitarist Bill Frisell, and Ginger Baker&#x27;s Energy.

Baker&#x27;s drumming is regarded for its style, showmanship, and use of two bass drums instead of the conventional single one, after the manner of the jazz drummer Louie Bellson. In his early days, he performed lengthy drum solos, most notably in the Cream song &quot;Toad&quot;, one of the earliest recorded examples in rock music. Baker was an inductee of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Cream in 1993, of the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 2008, and of the Classic Drummer Hall of Fame in 2016. Baker was noted for his eccentric, often self-destructive lifestyle, and he struggled with heroin addiction for many decades. He was married four times and fathered three children.

== Early life ==
Peter Baker was born in Lewisham, South London; he was nicknamed &quot;Ginger&quot; for his shock of flaming red hair. His mother, Ruby May (née Bayldon), worked in a tobacco shop. His father, Frederick Louvain Formidable Baker, was a bricklayer employed by his own father, who owned a building business, and was a lance corporal in the Royal Corps of Signals in World War II; he died in the 1943 Dodecanese campaign. Baker went to Pope Street School, where he was considered &quot;one of the better players&quot; in the football team, and then to Shooter&#x27;s Hill Grammar School. While at school he joined Squadron 56 of the Air Training Corps, based at Woolwich and stayed with them for two or three years.

==Career==

Baker began playing drums at around 15 years of age. In the early 1960s he took lessons from Phil Seamen, one of the leading British jazz drummers of the post-war era.

===Early bands===
In the 1960s he joined Blues Incorporated, where he met bassist Jack Bruce. The two clashed often, but would be rhythm section partners again in the Graham Bond Organisation, a rhythm and blues group with strong jazz leanings. Their relationship was so volatile that Baker once attacked Bruce with a knife during a concert.

In March 1963, Baker played in the Johnny Burch Octet with Burch, Jack Bruce, Mike Falana, Stan Robinson, John Mumford and others.

=== Cream ===
Despite this volatile relationship, Baker and Bruce reunited in 1966 when they formed Cream with guitarist Eric Clapton. A fusion of blues, psychedelic rock and hard rock, the band released four albums in a little over two years before breaking up in 1968.

=== Blind Faith ===

Baker then joined the short-lived &quot;supergroup&quot; Blind Faith, comprising Eric Clapton, bassist Ric Grech from Family, and Steve Winwood from Traffic on keyboards and vocals. They released only one album, &quot;Blind Faith&quot;, before breaking up.

=== Ginger Baker&#x27;s Air Force ===

In 1970 Baker formed, toured and recorded two albums with fusion rock group Ginger Baker&#x27;s Air Force.

=== 1970s ===
Following Air Force, Baker created the short-lived &quot;Ginger Baker Drum Choir&quot;, which released a sole single on Atco Records (and Polydor in Germany) in 1971. The 45 RPM record featured a three-piece drum ensemble and &quot;call and response&quot; vocals, with the song &quot;Atunde! (We are here)&quot; and &quot;Atunde! (part 2)&quot; on its A and B sides.

In November 1971, Baker decided to set up a recording studio in Lagos, then the capital of Nigeria. He decided that it would be an interesting experience to travel to Nigeria overland across the Sahara. Baker invited documentary filmmaker Tony Palmer to join him and the film &quot;Ginger Baker in Africa&quot; follows his odyssey as he makes his journey and finally arrives in Nigeria to set up his studio. After many frustrating setbacks and technical hitches, Batakota (ARC) studios opened at the end of January 1973, and operated successfully through the seventies as a facility for both local and western musicians. Paul McCartney and Wings recorded the song &quot;Picasso&#x27;s Last Words (Drink to Me)&quot; for &quot;Band on the Run&quot; at the studio, with Baker playing a tin can full of gravel.

Baker sat in with Fela Kuti during recording sessions in 1971 released by Regal Zonophone as &quot;Live!&quot; Fela also appeared with Baker on &quot;Stratavarious&quot; (1972) alongside Bobby Gass, a pseudonym for Bobby Tench from the Jeff Beck Group. &quot;Stratavarious&quot; was later re-issued as part of the compilation &quot;Do What You Like&quot; (1998). Baker formed Baker Gurvitz Army with brothers Paul and Adrian Gurvitz in 1974 (encouraged by manager Bill Fehilly). The band recorded three albums, &quot;Baker Gurvitz Army&quot; (1974), &quot;Elysian Encounter&quot; (1975) and &quot;Hearts on Fire&quot; (1976), and the band toured through England and Europe in 1975. The band broke up in 1976, not long after the death of Fehilly in a plane crash.

=== 1980s ===
After the failure of the recording studio in Lagos, Baker spent most of the early 1980s on an olive farm in a small town in Tuscany, Italy. During this period, he played little music.

In 1980, Baker joined Hawkwind after initially playing as a session musician on the album &quot;Levitation&quot;. He left in 1981, after a tour. Live material and studio demos from that period which Baker participated in were included on two Hawkwind albums, released later in the 1980s. In 1985, he worked with producer Bill Laswell on &quot;Horses &amp; Trees&quot; and then performed as a session musician on &quot;Album&quot; by Public Image Ltd.

Baker moved to Los Angeles in the late 1980s intending to become an actor. He unsuccessfully auditioned for the part of the Homeless Man in the 1989 &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic comedy film &quot;UHF&quot; and appeared in the 1990 TV series &quot;Nasty Boys&quot; as Ginger.

=== 1990s ===
In 1992 Baker played with the hard rock group Masters of Reality with bassist Googe and singer/guitarist Chris Goss on the album &quot;Sunrise on the Sufferbus&quot;.

BBM (Bruce Baker Moore) formed in 1993. The short-lived power trio with the line-up of Baker, Jack Bruce and Irish blues rock guitarist Gary Moore recorded the album &quot;Around the Next Dream&quot;, released 1994.

Baker lived in Parker, Colorado between 1993 and 1999, in part due to his passion for polo. Baker not only participated in polo events at the Salisbury Equestrian Park, but he also sponsored an ongoing series of jam sessions and concerts at the equestrian centre on weekends. His past drug history increasingly caused him problems with U.S. immigration, so in 1999 he sold his property in Parker and moved to South Africa. In 1994, he formed the Ginger Baker Trio with bassist Charlie Haden and guitarist Bill Frisell.

=== 2000s and 2010s ===
On 3 May 2005, Baker reunited with Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce for a series of Cream concerts at the Royal Albert Hall and Madison Square Garden. The London concerts were recorded and released as &quot;Royal Albert Hall London May 2-3-5-6, 2005&quot; (2005). In a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article written in 2009, Bruce is quoted as saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a knife-edge thing between me and Ginger. Nowadays, we&#x27;re happily co-existing in different continents [Bruce, who died in 2014, lived in Britain, while Baker lived in South Africa]  ... although I was thinking of asking him to move. He&#x27;s still a bit too close&quot;.
In 2008 a bank clerk, Lindiwe Noko, was charged with defrauding Baker of almost R500,000 ($60,000). Baker said he had hired Noko as a personal assistant, paying her £7 per day (about R100) for performing various errands, and alleged she used this position to uncover his private banking information and make unauthorised withdrawals. Noko claimed that the money was a gift after she and Baker became lovers. Baker replied, &quot;I&#x27;ve a scar that only a woman who had a thing with me would know. It&#x27;s there and she doesn&#x27;t know it&#x27;s there.&quot; Noko pleaded not guilty but was convicted of fraud. In October 2010 she was sentenced to three years of &quot;correctional supervision&quot;, a type of community service. Baker called the sentence &quot;a travesty&quot;.

His autobiography &quot;Hellraiser&quot; was published in 2009. Throughout 2013 and 2014, he toured with the Ginger Baker Jazz Confusion, a quartet comprising Baker, saxophonist Alfred &quot;Pee Wee&quot; Ellis, bassist Alec Dankworth, and percussionist Abass Dodoo. In 2014 Baker signed with Motéma Music to release the album &quot;Why?&quot;

== Documentaries ==
&quot;Ginger Baker in Africa&quot; (1971) documents Baker&#x27;s drive by Range Rover, from Algeria to Nigeria, across the Sahara. At his destination, Lagos, he sets up a recording studio and jams with Fela Kuti.

In 2012, the Jay Bulger documentary film &quot;Beware of Mr. Baker&quot; about Baker&#x27;s life had its world premiere at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, where it won the Grand Jury Award for best documentary feature. It received its UK premiere on BBC One on 7 July 2015.

== Style and technique ==
Baker cited Phil Seamen, Art Blakey, Max Roach, Elvin Jones, Philly Joe Jones and Baby Dodds as main influences on his style. Although he was generally considered a pupil of Seamen, Baker stated that he was largely self-taught and he only played some exercises with Seamen.

Baker&#x27;s early performance attracted attention for both his musicality and showmanship. While he became famous during his time with Cream for his wild, unpredictable, and flamboyant performances that were often viewed in a vein similar to that of Keith Moon from the Who, Baker also frequently employed a much more restrained and straightforward performance style influenced by the British jazz groups he heard during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Although he is usually categorised as having been a &quot;rock drummer&quot;, Baker himself preferred to be viewed as a jazz drummer, or as just &quot;a drummer&quot;.

Along with Moon, Baker was credited as one of the early pioneers of double bass drumming in rock. He recollected that in 1966 he began to adopt two bass drums in his setup after he and Moon watched drummer Sam Woodyard at a Duke Ellington concert. According to Baker:

Every drummer that ever played for Duke Ellington played a double bass drum kit. I went to a Duke Ellington concert in 1966 and Sam Woodyard was playing with Duke and he played some incredible tom-tom and two bass drum things, some of which I still use today and I just knew I had to get a two bass drum kit. Keith Moon was with me at that concert and we were discussing it and he went straight round to Premier and bought two kits which he stuck together. I had to wait for Ludwig to make a kit up for me, which they did—to my own specifications. So Moonie had the two bass drum kit some months before I did.

Baker preferred light, thin, fast-rebounding drum sticks (size 7A), usually held using a matched grip. Baker&#x27;s playing made use of syncopation and ride cymbal patterns characteristic of bebop and other advanced forms of jazz, as well as the frequent application of African rhythms.

In his early days, he developed what would later become the archetypal rock drum solo, with the best known example being the five-minute-long instrumental &quot;Toad&quot; from Cream&#x27;s debut album &quot;Fresh Cream&quot; (1966). Baker was one of the first drummers to move his left foot between his left bass drum pedal and hi-hat pedal to create various combinations. Somewhat atypically, Baker mounted all of the tom-toms on his drum kit in a vertical fashion, with the shells of the drums perpendicular to the floor, as opposed to the more common practice of angling the rack toms toward the player.

Baker&#x27;s most recent kit was made by Drum Workshop. He used Ludwig Drums until the late 1990s. All of his cymbals were made by Zildjian; the 22-inch rivet ride cymbal and the 14-inch hi-hats he used were the same ones he used during the last two Cream tours in 1968.

== Legacy ==

Baker&#x27;s style influenced many drummers, including John Bonham, Peter Criss, Neil Peart, Stewart Copeland, Ian Paice, Terry Bozzio, Dave Lombardo, Tommy Aldridge, Bill Bruford, Alex Van Halen, Danny Seraphine and Nick Mason.

&quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine described him as &quot;one of classic rock&#x27;s first influential drumming superstars of the 1960s&quot; and &quot;one of classic rock&#x27;s true drum gods&quot;. AllMusic described him as &quot;the most influential percussionist of the 1960s&quot; and stated that &quot;virtually every drummer of every heavy metal band that has followed since that time has sought to emulate some aspect of Baker&#x27;s playing&quot;. Although he is widely considered a pioneer of heavy metal drumming, Baker expressed his repugnance for the genre.

&quot;Drum!&quot; magazine listed Baker among the &quot;50 Most Important Drummers of All Time&quot; and has defined him as &quot;one of the most imitated &#x27;60s drummers&quot;, stating also that &quot;he forever changed the face of rock music&quot;. He was voted the third greatest drummer of all time in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reader poll and has been considered the &quot;drummer who practically invented the rock drum solo&quot;. In 2016, he was ranked 3rd on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;100 Greatest Drummers of All Time&quot;. According to author and columnist Ken Micallef in his book &quot;Classic Rock Drummers&quot;: &quot;the pantheon of contemporary drummers from metal, fusion, and rock owe their very existence to Baker&#x27;s trailblazing work with Cream&quot;. Neil Peart has said: &quot;His playing was revolutionary – extrovert, primal and inventive. He set the bar for what rock drumming could be. [...] Every rock drummer since has been influenced in some way by Ginger – even if they don&#x27;t know it&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Baker was infamous for his irascible personality and violent temper, as well as for confrontations with musicians and fans. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reporter David Fricke wrote in 2012 that even in old age, &quot;you get close to Baker at your peril.&quot;

Baker was married four times and fathered three children. Baker and his first wife, Liz Finch, had their first child, Ginette Karen, on 20 December 1960. Baker&#x27;s second daughter, Leda, was born 20 February 1968. Baker&#x27;s son, Kofi Streatfield Baker, was born in March 1969 and named after Baker&#x27;s friend, Ghanaian drummer Kofi Ghanaba. Kofi himself is also a drummer, notably playing with Uli Jon Roth and Glenn Hughes.

=== Illness and death ===

Baker struggled with heroin addiction throughout his life, having begun using the drug in the 1960s while a jazz drummer in London clubs. Each time he travelled to Africa, he would get sober temporarily only to relapse. He estimated that he stopped using the drug around 29 times during his life, but was only able to quit permanently after moving to a small Italian village in 1981 where he took up olive farming.

In February 2013, Baker said he had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from years of heavy smoking, and chronic back pain from degenerative osteoarthritis. In February 2016, Baker was diagnosed with &quot;serious heart issues&quot; and cancelled all future gigs. Writing on his blog, he said, &quot;Just seen doctor ... big shock ... no more gigs for this old drummer ... everything is off ... of all things I never thought it would be my heart ...&quot; In late March 2016, it was revealed that Baker was set for pioneering treatment. &quot;There are two options for surgery and, depending on how strong my old lungs are, they may do both.&quot; He added, &quot;Cardiologist is brilliant. Yesterday he inserted a tube into the artery at my right wrist and fed it all the way to my heart—quite an experience. He was taking pictures of my heart from inside—amazing technology ... He says he&#x27;s going to get me playing again! Thanks all for your support&quot;. In June 2016, it was reported he was recovering from open heart surgery, but had also suffered a bad fall, which had caused swollen legs and feet.

On 25 September 2019, Baker&#x27;s family reported that he was critically ill in hospital, and asked fans to keep him in their prayers. Baker died on 6 October 2019 at the age of 80, at a hospital in Canterbury from complications of COPD. On 23 October 2019, a private funeral service was held in Canterbury, Kent, with close family and friends.

<text>Claude Chappe (; 25 December 1763 – 23 January 1805) was a French inventor who in 1792 demonstrated a practical semaphore system that eventually spanned all of France. His system consisted of a series of towers, each within line of sight of others, each supporting a wooden mast with two crossarms on pivots that could be placed in various positions. The operator in a tower moved the arms to a sequence of positions, spelling out text messages in semaphore code. The operator in the next tower read the message through a telescope, then passed it on to the next tower. This was the first practical telecommunications system of the industrial age, and was used until the 1850s when electric telegraph systems replaced it.

==Early life ==

Claude Chappe was born in Brûlon, Sarthe, France, the son of Ignace Chappe, a &quot;contrôleur&quot; (intendant) of the Crown lands for Laval, and his wife Marie Devernay, daughter of a physician of Laval. He was raised for church service, but lost his sinecure during the French Revolution. He was educated at the &quot;Lycée Pierre Corneille&quot; in Rouen.

His uncle was the astronomer Jean-Baptiste Chappe d&#x27;Auteroche, famed for his observations of the Transit of Venus in 1761 and again in 1769. The first book Claude read in his youth was his uncle&#x27;s journal of the 1761 trip, &quot;Voyage en Siberie&quot;. His brother, Abraham, wrote &quot;Reading this book greatly inspired him, and gave him a taste for the physical sciences. From this point on, all his studies, and even his pastimes, were focused on that subject.&quot; Because of his astronomer uncle, Claude may also have become familiar with the properties of telescopes.

He and his four unemployed brothers decided to develop a practical system of semaphore relay stations, a task proposed in antiquity, yet never realized.

Claude&#x27;s brother, Ignace Chappe (1760–1829) was a member of the Legislative Assembly during the French Revolution. With his help, the Assembly supported a proposal to build a relay line from Paris to Lille (fifteen stations, about 120 miles), to carry dispatches from the war.

The Chappe brothers determined by experiment that the angles of a rod were easier to see than the presence or absence of panels. Their final design had two arms connected by a cross-arm. Each arm had seven positions, and the cross-arm had four more, permitting a 196-combination code. The arms were from three to thirty feet long, black, and counterweighted, moved by only two handles. Lamps mounted on the arms proved unsatisfactory for night use. The relay towers were placed from 12 to 25 km (10 to 20 miles) apart. Each tower had a telescope pointing both up and down the relay line.

Chappe initially called his invention a &quot;tachygraph&quot; (&quot;fast writer&quot;). However, the Army preferred to use the word &quot;telegraph&quot; (&quot;far writer&quot;), which was coined by French statesman André François Miot de Mélito. Today, in order to distinguish it from subsequent telegraph systems, the French name for Chappe&#x27;s semaphore telegraph system is named after him, and thus is known as a Telegraph Chappe. Alternatively, Chappe coined the phrase &quot;semaphore&quot;, from the Greek elements σῆμα (sêma, &quot;sign&quot;); and from φορός (phorós, &quot;carrying&quot;), or φορά (phorá, &quot;a carrying&quot;) from φέρειν (phérein, &quot;to bear&quot;).

In 1794, the first messages were successfully sent between Paris and Lille. In 1794 the semaphore line informed Parisians of the capture of Condé-sur-l&#x27;Escaut from the Austrians less than an hour after it occurred. Other lines were built, including a line from Paris to Toulon. The system was widely copied by other European states, and was used by Napoleon to coordinate his empire and army.

In 1805, Claude Chappe killed himself. He was said to be depressed by illness, and claims by rivals that he had plagiarized from military semaphore systems.

In 1824 Ignace Chappe attempted to increase interest in using the semaphore line for commercial messages, such as commodity prices; however, the business community resisted.

From 1844, the government of France funded trials of a new system of electric telegraph lines and committed to fully replacing the Chappe telegraph in 1846. Many contemporaries warned of the ease of sabotage and interruption of service by cutting a wire. The extent of the French optical telegraph meant that it took some time for the replacement to be completed. The two systems existed side-by-side for about a decade. One of the last messages sent over the Chappe telegraph was news of the fall of Sevastopol in 1855.

==Popular culture==
The Chappe semaphore figures prominently in Alexandre Dumas&#x27; &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;. The Count bribes an underpaid operator to transmit a false message.

==Memorials==

Rue Chappe in the 18th arrondissement of Paris, is named after Chappe. A bronze sculpture of him was erected at the crossing of Rue du Bac and Boulevard Raspail in Paris. As many statues displeased or offended Hitler, it was removed and melted down during the Nazi occupation of Paris, in 1941 or 1942.

<doc id="163271" wikidata="Q272952" url="?curid=163271" title="Bonnie Hunt">
<text>Bonnie Lynn Hunt (born September 22, 1961) is an American actress and comedian. Her film roles include &quot;Rain Man&quot;, &quot;Beethoven&quot;, &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s 2nd&quot;, &quot;Jumanji&quot;, &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, &quot;The Green Mile&quot;, &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;, and &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen 2&quot;.

Hunt has done voice work in &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, &quot;Zootopia&quot;, and the &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Cars&quot;, and &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchises. She starred in &quot;Grand&quot; and &quot;Davis Rules&quot;, as well as creating, producing, writing, and starring in &quot;The Building&quot;, &quot;Bonnie&quot;, and &quot;Life with Bonnie&quot;. From 2008 to 2010, she hosted &quot;The Bonnie Hunt Show&quot;.

==Early life==
Bonnie Lynn Hunt was born on September 22, 1961, in Chicago, Illinois, to Robert Edward Hunt (1927-1981), an electrician, and Alice E. Hunt (née Jatczak; 1925-2021). Her father was of Irish and Belgian ancestry and her mother is of Polish descent. She has three older brothers named Patrick, Kevin, and Tom, two older sisters named Cathy and Carol, and a younger sister named Mary.
She was educated in Catholic schools, attending Saint Ferdinand School and Notre Dame High School for Girls in Chicago, and worked part-time as a nurse&#x27;s aide.

In 1982, Hunt worked as an oncology nurse at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. In 1984, she co-founded an improvisational comedy troupe called An Impulsive Thing. Hunt also performed as a member of Chicago&#x27;s world-famous the Second City, joining in 1986.

In 1988, while a nurse, Hunt auditioned on her lunch break for the role of waitress Sally Dibbs in &quot;Rain Man&quot; and won it.

==Career==
In 1990, Hunt portrayed Carol Anne Smithson in &quot;Grand&quot;. She refused to become a cast member of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; because the series&#x27; producers generally frowned on her preferred improvisational style. In 1992, she was offered the part of B.J. Poteet, a replacement for Julia Duffy, on &quot;Designing Women&quot;. Instead, she chose to co-star in &quot;Davis Rules&quot;.

In 1993, Hunt teamed with good friend David Letterman to produce &quot;The Building&quot;. The series was also filmed live; mistakes, accidents, and forgotten lines were often left in the aired episode. In 1995, Hunt and Letterman reteamed for &quot;The Bonnie Hunt Show&quot; (later retitled &quot;Bonnie&quot;), which featured many of the same cast members as &quot;The Building&quot; and the same loose style. The show was praised by critics but was canceled after 11 of the 13 episodes produced were aired. In 2002, Hunt returned to television with &quot;Life with Bonnie&quot;. Her role on the series earned her a 2004 Emmy nomination (which was her first). Despite fair ratings, the series was canceled in its second season. Hunt announced on &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot; that ABC had offered her another sitcom, in which she would have portrayed a divorced detective. This pilot titled &quot;Let Go&quot; (also known as &quot;Crimes and Dating&quot;) was not picked up for the fall 2006 schedule.

She directed, co-wrote, and co-starred in &quot;Return to Me&quot;. It was filmed in her Chicago neighborhood and included bit parts for a number of her relatives. The film, which received a positive reception from critics, was largely influenced by Hunt&#x27;s blue-collar Catholic upbringing in Chicago.

Hunt portrayed Alice Newton in &quot;Beethoven&quot; and &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s 2nd&quot;, Sarah Whittle/Madam Serena in &quot;Jumanji&quot;, and Kate Baker in &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; and &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen 2&quot;. She portrayed the sister of Renée Zellweger&#x27;s character in &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; and Jan Edgecomb in &quot;The Green Mile&quot;. She portrayed Grace Bellamy in &quot;Loggerheads&quot;. She has provided her voice for a total of eight Pixar films: &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; as Rosie, &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; as Ms. Flint, &quot;Cars&quot;, &quot;Cars 2&quot;, and &quot;Cars 3&quot; as Sally Carrera, &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; and &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; as Dolly, and &quot;Monsters University&quot; as Karen Graves. In addition, Hunt voiced Bonnie Hopps in the Walt Disney Animation Studios&#x27; film, &quot;Zootopia&quot;, which marked her first non-Pixar animated film.

===&quot;The Bonnie Hunt Show&quot;===

In 2007, Hunt taped a pilot episode for Telepictures. The pilot was approved and the talk show was created. &quot;The Bonnie Hunt Show&quot; premiered on Monday, September 8, 2008. The set design was a tribute to Dean Martin and on the walls are pictures of historic television personalities, as well as Hunt&#x27;s family members. The series was inspired by the format of &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;, with the host and guests often interacting with the audience. Many of the series&#x27; staffers were longtime friends of Hunt from Chicago. The series typically started with an opening monologue followed by guest interviews and games played with the audience. Hunt&#x27;s mother Alice often appeared in webcasts from her home in Chicago. &quot;The Bonnie Hunt Show&quot; taped in Culver City, California, and was viewed in 17 of the top 20 US television markets in the United States. In its first year, &quot;The Bonnie Hunt Show&quot; was nominated for three Daytime Emmy Awards, for opening theme, hairstyle, and makeup. It won the Gracie Award for &quot;Outstanding Talk Show&quot; in 2009. In 2010, Hunt was nominated for &quot;Outstanding Talk Show Host&quot; at the Daytime Emmy Awards. The final episode aired on May 26, 2010.

==Personal life==
In 1988, Hunt married investment banker John Murphy. The couple separated in 2006; their divorce was officially finalized in 2008.

Hunt is a lifelong Chicago Cubs fan, having not missed an opening day at Wrigley Field since 1977. She was in attendance in Cleveland for the Cubs&#x27; historic Game 7 victory during the 2016 World Series.

Hunt is a supporter of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, of which she is an honorary board member.

<text>John Henry Bonham (31 May 1948 – 25 September 1980) was an English musician who was the drummer of the rock band Led Zeppelin. Noted for his speed, power, fast single-footed kick drumming, distinctive sound, and feel for groove, he is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential drummers in history.

Bonham was born in 1948 in Redditch, Worcestershire, and took up drums at age 5, receiving a snare drum at age 10 and a full drum set at age 15. He played with multiple local bands both at school and following school, eventually playing in two different bands with Robert Plant. Following the demise of the Yardbirds in 1968, Bonham joined Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page and bass guitarist John Paul Jones to form Led Zeppelin. 

Bonham showcased a hard-hitting hard rock style, but also handled funk and Latin-influenced grooves in later Led Zeppelin releases. Like Keith Moon of the Who, Bonham&#x27;s drum set grew in size following the band&#x27;s 1969 concert tours, including congas or timpani and a gong. His drum solo &quot;Moby Dick&quot; was featured on the group&#x27;s second album and was a staple of their concerts, often lasting just over 20 minutes. Outside of Led Zeppelin, Bonham played drums for other artists, including the Family Dogg, Screaming Lord Sutch, Lulu, Jimmy Stevens and Wings. Bonham played with Led Zeppelin until his sudden death at age 32, in September 1980 following a day of heavy drinking. The surviving members disbanded the group out of respect for Bonham.

A mostly self-taught drummer, Bonham was influenced by Max Roach, Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich. While he was primarily known for his hard-rock style during his lifetime, his reputation as a drummer has grown beyond that genre following his death. He has influenced various drummers, including Dave Grohl, Neil Peart, Chad Smith and Dave Lombardo. He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 as a member of Led Zeppelin. In 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named him the greatest drummer of all time.

==Early life==
John Henry Bonham was born on 31 May 1948, in Redditch, Worcestershire, England, to Joan and Jack Bonham. He began learning to play drums at age five, making a kit of containers and coffee tins, imitating his idols Max Roach, Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich. His mother gave him a snare drum when he was 10. He received his first drum kit, a Premier Percussion set, from his father at age 15. Bonham never took formal drum lessons, although he received advice from other Redditch drummers. While at school, between 1962 and 1963, Bonham joined the Blue Star Trio and Gerry Levene &amp; the Avengers.

Bonham attended Lodge Farm Secondary Modern School, where his headmaster wrote in his report that he would &quot;either end up a dustman or a millionaire.&quot; After leaving school in 1964, he worked for his father as an apprentice carpenter between drumming for local bands. In 1964, Bonham joined his first semi-professional band, Terry Webb and the Spiders, and met his future wife, Pat Phillips, around the same time. He played in other Birmingham bands such as The Nicky James Movement and The Senators, with whom he made a single, &quot;She&#x27;s a Mod&quot;, in 1964, at Hollick and Taylor Studios in Birmingham. Bonham took up drumming full-time. Two years later, he joined A Way of Life. After the band&#x27;s demise, Bonham joined a blues group called Crawling King Snakes, whose lead singer was Robert Plant.

In 1967, Bonham agreed to return to A Way of Life while keeping in touch with Plant. Plant formed Band of Joy and chose Bonham as the drummer. The band recorded demos but no album. In 1968, American singer Tim Rose toured Britain and asked Band of Joy to open his concerts. When Rose returned months later, Bonham joined Rose&#x27;s band. Bonham may have played on the April 1968 recording of Donovan&#x27;s &quot;Hurdy Gurdy Man&quot; although this is disputed.

== Career ==

===Led Zeppelin===

After the breakup of the Yardbirds in July 1968, guitarist Jimmy Page formed another band and recruited Plant, who in turn suggested Bonham. Page&#x27;s choices for drummer included Procol Harum&#x27;s B. J. Wilson and Paul Francis. However, on seeing Bonham drum for Tim Rose at a club in Hampstead, north London, in July 1968, Page and manager Peter Grant were convinced he was perfect for the project, first known as the New Yardbirds and later as Led Zeppelin. Bonham was initially reluctant. Plant sent eight telegrams to Bonham&#x27;s pub, the &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot;, in Walsall, which were followed by 40 telegrams from Grant. Bonham was also receiving more lucrative offers from Joe Cocker and Chris Farlowe but he accepted Grant&#x27;s offer. He recalled, &quot;I decided I liked their music better than Cocker&#x27;s or Farlowe&#x27;s.&quot;
During Led Zeppelin&#x27;s first tour of the United States in December 1968, Bonham became friends with Vanilla Fudge&#x27;s drummer, Carmine Appice. Appice introduced him to Ludwig drums, which he then used for the rest of his career. His hard hitting was evident on many Led Zeppelin songs, including &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (&quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot;), &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; (&quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot;), &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; (&quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;), &quot;Kashmir&quot; (&quot;Physical Graffiti&quot;), &quot;The Ocean&quot; (&quot;Houses of the Holy&quot;), and &quot;Achilles Last Stand&quot; (&quot;Presence&quot;). Page let Bonham use a double bass drum in an early demo of &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot; but scratched the track because of Bonham&#x27;s &quot;over-use&quot; of it. The studio recording of &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; captures his dynamics, similarly exhibited on &quot;No Quarter&quot;. On cuts from later albums, Bonham handled funk and Latin-influenced drumming. Songs like &quot;Royal Orleans&quot; and &quot;Fool in the Rain&quot; are examples, respectively displaying a New Orleans shuffle and a half-time shuffle.

His drum solo, first entitled &quot;Pat&#x27;s Delight&quot;, later &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, often lasted 20 minutes. In some sections, he used his bare hands on his drums to imitate the sound of a phased hand drum. Bonham&#x27;s sequence for the film &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; featured him in a drag race at Santa Pod Raceway to the sound of his solo, &quot;Moby Dick&quot;. In Led Zeppelin tours after 1969, Bonham included congas, orchestral timpani and a symphonic gong.

===Other projects===
In 1969, Bonham appeared on The Family Dogg&#x27;s &quot;A Way of Life&quot;, with Page and Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones. Bonham also played for Screaming Lord Sutch on &quot;Lord Sutch and Heavy Friends&quot; in 1970. He played on Lulu&#x27;s 1971 single &quot;Everybody Clap&quot;, written by Maurice Gibb and Billy Lawrie. In 1972, he played on a Maurice Gibb-produced album by Jimmy Stevens called &quot;Don&#x27;t Freak Me Out&quot; in the UK and &quot;Paid My Dues&quot; in the US, credited as &quot;Gemini&quot; (his star sign). He drummed for his Birmingham friend, Roy Wood, on &quot;Keep Your Hands on the Wheel&quot;, a single subsequently released on his 1979 album, &quot;On the Road Again&quot;, and on Wings&#x27; album &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; on the tracks &quot;Rockestra Theme&quot; and &quot;So Glad to See You Here&quot;. He was also featured on Paul McCartney &amp; Wings&#x27; &quot;Beware My Love&quot; demo version first recorded in 1975; it remained unreleased until 2014 with the release of the album &quot;Wings at the Speed of Sound&quot; boxset. Bonham was the best man of Black Sabbath&#x27;s Tony Iommi at his wedding ceremony.

In 1974, Bonham appeared in the film &quot;Son of Dracula&quot;, playing drums in Count Downe&#x27;s (Harry Nilsson) band. Bonham appeared in a drum line-up including Keith Moon and Ringo Starr on the soundtrack album.

== Personal life ==
Bonham had a younger brother, Mick Bonham (1950–2000), a disc jockey, author and photographer, and a younger sister, Deborah Bonham (born 1962), a singer-songwriter. Bonham&#x27;s mother, Joan, died aged 85–86 on 10 February 2011. She sang for The Zimmers, a 40-member band set up as a result of a BBC documentary on the treatment of the elderly. Bonham&#x27;s cousin Billy (born 1950) played keyboards for Terry Reid and Ace Kefford.

Bonham was married to Pat Phillips, and the couple had two children. Zoë Bonham (born 10 June 1975) is a singer-songwriter who appears at Led Zeppelin conventions. Jason Bonham (born 15 July 1966) is a drummer who has recorded or toured with Sammy Hagar and the Circle, Black Country Communion, UFO, Foreigner, and Bonham. Jason played with Led Zeppelin at their Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary reunion show on 15 May 1988 and again on 10 December 2007 at the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert. A 1973 film clip of seven-year-old Jason playing drums appears in the Led Zeppelin film &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;. He also played in the band covering &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; at Led Zeppelin&#x27;s 2012 Kennedy Center Award ceremony. Zoë and Jason appeared at the induction ceremony for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 with the surviving members of Led Zeppelin.

== Death ==

On 24 September 1980, Bonham was picked up by Led Zeppelin assistant Rex King to attend rehearsals at Bray Studios for a tour of North America, to begin 17 October in Montreal; it was the band&#x27;s first tour since 1977. During the journey, Bonham asked to stop for breakfast, where he drank four quadruple vodka screwdrivers (16 shots, totalling between 400 and 560 ml). He continued to drink heavily at rehearsals. The band stopped rehearsing late in the evening and then went to Page&#x27;s house, the Old Mill House in Clewer, Windsor. After midnight on 25 September, Bonham fell asleep; someone took him to bed and placed him on his side. Jones and the tour manager Benji LeFevre found him unresponsive the next afternoon. Bonham was pronounced dead at 32 years old.

The inquest on 27 October 1980 showed that in 24 hours, Bonham had consumed around 40 shots (1–1.4 litres) of 40% ABV vodka, after which he vomited and choked, a condition known as pulmonary aspiration. The finding was accidental death. A post-mortem found no other recreational drugs in Bonham&#x27;s body. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Bonham had recently overcome a heroin problem and was taking an unspecified medication for anxiety and depression at the time of his death.

Bonham&#x27;s remains were cremated and his ashes interred on 12 October 1980 in the graveyard at St Michael’s Church, Rushock, Worcestershire. Rather than replace Bonham, Led Zeppelin chose to disband. They said in a press release on 4 December 1980: &quot;We wish it to be known that the loss of our dear friend and the deep respect we have for his family, together with the sense of undivided harmony felt by ourselves and our manager, have led us to decide that we could not continue as we were.&quot;

==Artistry==

=== Equipment ===

Bonham initially used Premier drums, but in the late 1960s was introduced to Ludwig drums by Carmine Appice. Throughout the remainder of his career, Bonham endorsed Ludwig. At times, Bonham&#x27;s kick drum pedal squeaked. Jimmy Page later commented:

In 2005, Ludwig reissued Bonham drum kits in several styles and, in 2007, stainless steel kits similar to those Bonham used on the last Led Zeppelin tours in the 1970s.

Bonham used Paiste cymbals and Remo drumheads. His hardware was a mixture of Rogers and Ludwig, including the Ludwig Speed King pedal and Rogers Swiv-O-Matic series of hardware. Initially augmenting his kit in live performances with timbales and congas as well as the cowbell, he soon settled on his trademark timpani, gong and ching-ring mounted on his hi-hat stand as the percussion in his setup in addition to the aforementioned cowbell.

Bonham drum solos would often feature playing floor toms and cymbals with his bare hands. He started using this technique as well as developing a finger-control style, influenced from hearing jazz recordings by drummer Joe Morello, during the early 1960s with his first band the Blue Star Trio.

==Legacy==

===Reception===
For music critics who were not receptive to the hard rock aspects of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s sound, Bonham&#x27;s playing was sometimes characterized (along with the other elements of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s music) as bombastic and lacking a sense of swing. For example, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Jim Miller wrote the following in 1975, while reviewing &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot;: &quot;Bonham ... is a steak-and-potatoes percussionist, handpicked, one assumes, for his ability to supply a plodding, stolid, rock-solid bottom—no one has ever accused Led Zeppelin of swinging.&quot; In the 2012 documentary &quot;Beware of Mr. Baker&quot;, Eric Clapton reinforced the idea that Bonham&#x27;s playing lacked subtlety, and that Bonham and his contemporary Keith Moon of the Who were not equals in terms of musicianship to Ginger Baker, Clapton&#x27;s drummer in the 1960s rock band Cream. &quot;No, no, no, no, [scoffs]. Ginger was nothing like those players. His musical capabilities are full spectrum. He can write and compose and arrange, and he has an ear, and he is harmonic. He is a fully formed musician.&quot;

Since his death, however, Bonham&#x27;s reputation has continued to grow beyond the world of hard rock, and his playing is now commonly recognised by critics and musicians as worthy of close study. &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; had the following to say about Bonham in 2010. &quot;Like nearly every British rock musician in the mid-&#x27;60s, the members of Led Zeppelin played in groups specializing in amped-up versions of black American music like the blues, R&amp;B, jazz, and soul. To play that music convincingly, you had to swing, and few drummers in any genre have swung with as much swagger as John Bonham ... Despite all the deserved attention paid to his brilliant soloing ideas, his rhythmic sophistication, or his bass drum prowess, John Bonham was, above all else, a groover.&quot;

===Influence===
Rock drummers influenced by Bonham include Roger Taylor, Joey Kramer, Lee Kerslake, Neil Peart, Dave Grohl, Tommy Lee, Peter Criss, Chad Smith, Dave Lombardo, Brad Wilk, John Dolmayan, Ian Mosley, Yoshiki, and Shinya. Phil Collins, who became a drummer for Plant&#x27;s solo career, told Plant he wanted to play with him because he &quot;loved&quot; Bonham&#x27;s drumming. 

Grohl said: &quot;John Bonham played the drums like someone who didn&#x27;t know what was going to happen next—like he was teetering on the edge of a cliff. No one has come close to that since, and I don&#x27;t think anybody ever will. I think he will forever be the greatest drummer of all time.&quot; Smith remarked: &quot;To me, hands down, John Bonham was the best rock drummer ever. The style and the sound was so identifiable to one person. Any drum set that he would play, it sounded like him.&quot; Mike Portnoy said: &quot;He was one of the all-time greats. He was just rock solid, and one of a kind. His swing and his feel is unparalleled. Nobody played like John Bonham, and still to this day, nobody really can play like John Bonham – as much as everybody tries. He will forever be one of the greatest rock drummers in the history of music. And he deserves it.&quot; Other musicians also paid tribute. John Paul Jones said Bonham was a &quot;bass player&#x27;s dream&quot;. Page has commented: &quot;One of the marvellous things about John Bonham which made things very easy [for a producer] was that he really knew how to tune his drums, and I tell you what, that was pretty rare in drummers in those days. He really knew how to make the instrument sing, and because of that, he could just get so much volume out of it by just playing with his wrists. It was just an astonishing technique that was sort of pretty holistic if you know what I mean.&quot;

Bonham&#x27;s drumming has been widely sampled in hip hop music; for example, the Beastie Boys sampled &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, &quot;The Ocean&quot;, and &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; on their debut album &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot;. The drum beat of the popular song &quot;Return to Innocence&quot; by Enigma was sampled from the Led Zeppelin song &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;.

===Awards and tributes===

Bonham has been described by AllMusic as one of the most important, well-known, and influential drummers in rock. Bonham was ranked No. 1 on &quot;Classic Rock&quot;″s 2005 list of 50 Greatest Drummers in Rock, and &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; describes him as &quot;the greatest rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll drummer in history.&quot; Adam Budofsky, managing editor of &quot;Modern Drummer&quot;, writes: &quot;If the king of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll was Elvis Presley, then the king of rock drumming was certainly John Bonham.&quot;

In 2007, &quot;Stylus&quot; magazine rated Bonham number one of 50 great rock drummers, as did &quot;Gigwise.com&quot; in 2008, and in September 2008, Bonham topped Blabbermouth.net&#x27;s list of &quot;Rockers fans want brought back to life&quot;, ahead of Elvis Presley and Freddie Mercury. &quot;Rhythm&quot; magazine voted him the greatest drummer ever, topping a readers&#x27; poll to determine the &quot;50 greatest drummers of all time&quot; in October 2009. At the end of the BBC Two series &quot;I&#x27;m in a Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Band!&quot; on 5 June 2010, Bonham was named best drummer of all time.

&quot;Bonz: The Groove Remains the Same—A Night in Honor of John Henry Bonham&quot; was produced by Whitesnake drummer Brian Tichy in Los Angeles on 25 September 2010 – the 30th anniversary of his death. Notable drummers that appeared at the tribute included Steven Adler, Vinny Appice, Kenny Aronoff, Frankie Banali, Fred Coury, Jimmy D&#x27;Anda, James Kottak, Chris Slade, Chad Smith, Joe Travers, Simon Wright, and John&#x27;s son, Jason Bonham. Carmine Appice performed via video. In 1988, the Pulitzer laureate Christopher Rouse composed &quot;Bonham&quot; in tribute. 

A &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reader&#x27;s poll where he &quot;led the list by a significant margin&quot; in 2011, and in 2016, the same magazine ranked him as the greatest drummer of all time in a list of 100 Greatest Drummers of all time. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, even after all these years, Bonham still ranks as the best drummer of all time, mentioning that &quot;[his] beat still bangs like a mofo ... Nobody else has brought quite that balance of muscle, groove and showmanship.&quot;

The surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited to play Live Aid in 1985 and employed two drummers, Phil Collins and Tony Thompson, to take his place. In June 2017, John Bonham&#x27;s childhood home received a blue plaque in his honour.

On 31 May 2018, on what would have been Bonham&#x27;s 70th birthday, a statue was unveiled in his hometown of Redditch, England, to commemorate him. The work of sculptor Mark Richards, the bronze sculpture weighs around 2.5 tonnes and was installed in Mercian Square. It is covered in anti-graffiti paint and is emblazoned with the words: &quot;The most outstanding and original drummer of his time, John Bonham&#x27;s popularity and influence continue to resonate with the world of music and beyond.&quot; 
Following the installation of the bronze memorial on Church Green, a special music event was organised to celebrate Bonham&#x27;s birthday.

<text>Philomena ( ), also known as Saint Philomena (; ) or Philomena of Rome ( 10 January 291 10 August 304) was a virgin martyr whose remains were discovered on May 24–25, 1802, in the Catacomb of Priscilla. Three tiles enclosing the tomb bore an inscription, (i.e. &quot;Peace be unto you, Philomena&quot;), that was taken to indicate that her name (in the Latin of the inscription) was &quot;Filumena&quot; (), the English form of which is &quot;Philomena&quot;. Philomena is the patron saint of infants, babies, and youth, and is known as &quot;The Wonderworker&quot;.

The remains were moved to Mugnano del Cardinale in 1805. There, they became the focus of widespread devotion; several miracles were credited to Philomena&#x27;s intercession, including the healing of Pauline Jaricot in 1835, which received wide publicity. John Vianney attributed to her intercession the extraordinary cures that others attributed to him.

From 1837 to 1961, celebration of her feast day was approved for regional calendars, but was never included in the General Roman Calendar. The 1920 typical edition of the Roman Missal included a mention of her, under 11 August, in the section headed (&quot;Masses for some places&quot;), with an indication that the Mass to be used in those places was one from the common of a virgin martyr, without any proper. The Coptic Orthodox Church celebrate the feast of Saint Philomena on 10 August of the Gregorian calendar which is 4 Misra of the Coptic calendar.

==Biography==
On December 21, 1833, the Holy Office declared that there was nothing contrary to the Catholic faith in the revelations that Maria Luisa di Gesù, a Dominican tertiary from Naples, claimed to have received from Philomena herself.

According to Maria Luisa di Gesù, Philomena told her she was the daughter of a king in Greece who, with his wife, had converted to Christianity. At the age of about 13, she took a vow of virginity for Christ&#x27;s sake. When the Emperor Diocletian threatened to make war on her father, her father went with his family to Rome to ask for peace. The Emperor &quot;fell in love&quot; with the young Philomena and, when she refused to be his wife, subjected her to a series of torments: scourging, from whose effects two angels cured her; drowning with an anchor attached to her (two angels cut the rope and raised her to the river bank); and being shot with arrows (on the first occasion her wounds were healed; on the second, the arrows turned aside; and on the third, they returned and killed six of the archers, after which several of the others became Christians). Finally, the Emperor had her decapitated. The story goes that the decapitation occurred on a Friday at three in the afternoon, as with the death of Jesus. The two anchors, three arrows, the palm, and the ivy leaf on the tiles found in the tomb were interpreted as symbols of her martyrdom.

In the Neapolitan tertiary&#x27;s account, Philomena also revealed that her birthday was 10 January, that her martyrdom occurred on 10 August (the date also of the arrival of her relics in Mugnano del Cardinale), and that her name &quot;Filumena&quot; meant &quot;daughter of light&quot; (from Latin &quot;filia&quot; and &quot;lumen;&quot; however, it is usually taken to be derived from Greek φιλουμένη &quot;philouménē&quot; (hence Latin &quot;u&quot; for &quot;ου&quot;) meaning &quot;beloved.&quot;). Publication of this account gave rise to critical study both of the account itself and of the many archaeological finds, leading to uncertainty that her supposed tomb was in fact that of a martyr.

==Discovery of her remains==
On May 24, 1802, in the Catacombs of Priscilla on the Via Salaria Nova, an inscribed &quot;loculus&quot; (a space hollowed out of the rock) was found, and on the following day it was carefully examined and opened. The &quot;loculus&quot; was closed with three terracotta tiles on which was the following inscription: &quot;lumena paxte cumfi&quot;. It was and is generally accepted that the tiles had not been positioned in the sequence of the words and that the inscription originally read, with the leftmost tile placed on the right: &quot;pax tecum Filumena&quot; (&quot;Peace with you, Philomena&quot;). The skeleton of a female between thirteen and fifteen years old was found within the &quot;loculus&quot;. Embedded in the cement was a small glass vial with vestiges of what was taken to be blood. By the assumptions of the time, the remains were taken to be those of a virgin martyr named Philomena.

The belief that such vials were signs of the grave of a martyr was rejected by the investigations of Giovanni Battista De Rossi (1822–1894), but more recently, this original view has found advocates, such as theologian Mark Miravalle.

In 1805, Canon Francesco De Lucia of Mugnano del Cardinale requested relics for his oratory and, on 8 June, obtained the remains discovered in May 1802 (then reduced to dust and fragments). The relics arrived in Mugnano on August 10, and were placed in the Church of Our Lady of Grace. A new Church of Our Lady of Grace was built, containing a chapel to which the sacred relics were moved on 29 September 1805.

In 1827, Pope Leo XII gave the church in Mugnano del Cardinale the three inscribed terracotta slabs taken from the tomb.

==Veneration==
In his &quot;Relazione istorica della traslazione del sagro corpo di s. Filomena da Roma a Mugnano del Cardinale&quot;, written in 1833, Canon De Lucia recounted that wonders accompanied the arrival of the relics to his church: among them a statue that sweated some liquid continuously for three days. A miracle accepted as proved in the same year was the multiplication of the bone dust of the saint which provided for hundreds of reliquaries without the original amount experiencing any decrease in quantity.

Devotion to Philomena includes the wearing of the &quot;Cord of Philomena&quot;, a red and white cord, which had a number of indulgences attached to it, including a plenary indulgence on the day on which the cord was worn for the first time, indulgences that were not renewed in &quot;Indulgentiarum doctrina&quot;, the 1967 general revision of the discipline concerning them. There is also the chaplet of Saint Philomena, with three white beads in honour of the Christian Trinity and thirteen red beads in honour of the thirteen years of Philomena&#x27;s life. A sacramental associated with devotion to Philomena is the Oil of Saint Philomena, used for the putative healing of the body and soul.

In August 1876, the first issue of &quot;Messenger of Saint Philomena&quot; was published in Paris, France. On October 6, 1876, Louis Petit, a priest, founded the Confraternity of Saint Philomena in Paris. In November 1886, the Confraternity was raised to the rank of Archconfraternity by Pope Leo XIII. On May 21, 1912, Pope Pius X raised it to the rank of Universal Archconfraternity with the Apostolic brief &quot;Pias Fidelium Societates&quot; stating, regarding the historical authenticity of Philomena, that: &quot;The current statements (regarding St. Philomena) are and remain always fixed, valid and effective; in this way it has to be judged as normative; and if it is proceeded in another way, it will be null and void, whatever its authority.&quot;

===Liturgy===
In 1834, due to many supposed miracles, Pope Gregory XVI allowed the veneration of Saint Philomena and, in 1837, authorized the celebration of the feast of Saint Philomena on 11 August or, according to another source, 9 September, first in the Diocese of Nola (to which Mugnano del Cardinale belongs), and soon in several other dioceses in Italy.

The name &quot;Philomena&quot; was not included in the Roman Martyrology in which venerated persons are included immediately upon beatification or canonization. In the 1920 typical edition of the Roman Missal, Philomena is mentioned under 11 August with an indication that the Mass for her feast day was to be taken entirely from the common liturgy.

On February 14, 1961, the Holy See ordered that the name of Philomena be removed from all liturgical calendars. This order was given as part of an instruction on the application to local calendars of the principles enunciated in the 1960 Code of Rubrics that had already been applied to the General Roman Calendar. Section 33 of this document ordered the removal from local calendars of fourteen named feasts but allowed them to be retained in places with a special link to the feast. It then added: &quot;However, the feast of Saint Philomena, virgin and martyr (11 August), is to be removed from all calendars.&quot;

===Veneration by other saints===
* The spread of devotion to her in France and Italy was helped when John Vianney built a shrine in her honour and referred to her often, attributing to her the miracles that others attributed to him.
* Another help was the cure of the near-dying Pauline Jaricot, founder of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, at Philomena&#x27;s shrine on August 10, 1835. On July 6, 1835, the Miracle of Giovanna Cescutti took place in Venice.
* Damien of Molokai, who had an intense devotion to Philomena, named his church at Kalawao in honor of her.
* Many other saints were devoted to Philomena, including Peter Julian Eymard, Peter Chanel, Anthony Mary Claret, Madeleine Sophie Barat, Euphrasier Pelletier, John Neumann, and Anna Maria Taigi.

==Criticism==
Although correlation does not prove causation, the Holy See&#x27;s instruction to remove the name of Philomena even from local calendars followed the raising of questions by certain scholars, whose interest had been drawn to the phenomenon more especially in connection with the revelations of Sister Maria Luisa di Gesù. The questions were raised in particular by Orazio Marucchi, whose study in the late 19th Century won the support of Johann Peter Kirsch, an archaeologist and ecclesiastical historian who is the author of the 1911 article on Philomena in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;. Orazio Marucchi had argued that the inscription on the three tiles that had provided the Latin name &quot;Filumena&quot; belonged to the middle or second half of the second century, while the body that had been found was of the fourth century, when the persecutions of Christians had ended. Thus, on his theory, not only the name but also the leaf, the two anchors and the palm that decorated the three tiles, and which had been believed to indicate that Filumena was a martyr, had no relation to the person whose remains were found. The alleged disarrangement of the tiles would be explained by a fourth-century practice of re-using materials already engraved, with the aim of indicating that it was not the same person who was now buried in the place.

More recently, Mark Miravalle has argued that Marucchi&#x27;s conclusions should not be taken as the final word on the historicity of St. Philomena. His book, &quot;It Is Time to Meet St. Philomena&quot;, cites several specialists who disagree with Marucchi&#x27;s conclusions. Historian Michael S. Carter (who supports Miravalle&#x27;s position) has written about devotion to Saint Philomena within the broader context of veneration of &quot;catacomb martyrs&quot; and their relics in the history of the United States. Moreover, In April 2005, at the &quot;Conference of Philomenian Studies – 1805-2005&quot;, findings of a study carried out on the tiles by the Opificio delle Pietre Dure e Laboratori di Restauro (Factory of Hard Stones and Restoration Laboratories) of Florence were made public. The analysis confirmed that only one type of mortal lime could be found on the tiles, thus giving strong support to the theory that the tiles had not been re-arranged.

Others stress that the authenticity of her cult can be grounded on account of the miracles attributed to her, its long-standing papal approbation, and the saint&#x27;s continued popularity. This has been the position of the rector of the shrine in Mugnano del Cardinale and the view presented in the Italian-language &quot;Enciclopedia Dei Santi&quot;. Pilgrims from all over the world arrive continually at Philomena&#x27;s shrine in the Diocese of Nola, Italy, displaying an intense degree of popular devotion.

The website of &quot;The National Shrine of Saint Philomena, Miami, Florida&quot; (associated with the SSPX) sees &quot;the action taken in 1960 as the work of the devil in order to deprive the people of God of a most powerful Intercessor, particularly in the areas of purity and faith at a time when these virtues were so much being challenged as they continue to be up until now!&quot;

<text>The Passion of Saints Perpetua and Felicity () is a diary by Vibia Perpetua describing her imprisonment as a Christian in 203, completed after her death by a redactor. It is one of the oldest and most notable early Christian texts.

Along with the experiences of Perpetua and Felicity, the text also appears to contain, in his own words, the accounts of the visions of Saturus, another Christian martyred with Perpetua. An editor who states he was an eyewitness has added accounts of the martyrs&#x27; suffering and deaths. It survives in both Latin and Greek forms.

==Text and content==

===Summary of the Passion text===
The traditional view has been that Perpetua, Felicity and the others were martyred owing to a decree of Roman emperor Septimius Severus (193–211). This is based on a reference to a decree Severus is said to have issued forbidding conversions to Judaism and Christianity, but this decree is known only from one source, the Augustan History, an unreliable mix of fact and fiction. Early church historian Eusebius describes Severus as a persecutor, but the Christian apologist Tertullian states that Severus was well disposed towards Christians, employed a Christian as his personal physician, and had personally intervened to save several high-born Christians known to him from the mob. Eusebius&#x27; description of Severus as a persecutor likely derives merely from the fact that numerous persecutions occurred during his reign, including those known in the &quot;Roman martyrology&quot; as the martyrs of Madaura as well as Perpetua and Felicity in the Roman province of Africa, but these were probably as the result of local persecutions rather than empire wide actions or decrees by Severus.

The details of the martyrdoms survive in both Latin and Greek texts (see below). Perpetua&#x27;s account of events leading to their deaths, apparently historical, is written in the first person. A brief introduction by the editor (chapters i–ii) is followed by the narrative and visions of Perpetua (iii–ix), and the vision of Saturus (xi–xiii). The account of their deaths, written by the editor who claims to be an eyewitness, is included at the end (xiv–xxi).

Perpetua&#x27;s account opens with conflict between her and her father, who wishes her to recant her belief. Perpetua refuses, and is soon baptized before being moved to prison (iii). After the guards are bribed, she is allowed to move to a better portion of the prison, where she nurses her child and gives its charge to her mother and brother (iii), and the child is able to stay in prison with her for the time being (iii).

At the encouragement of her brother, Perpetua asks for and receives a vision, in which she climbs a dangerous ladder to which various weapons are attached (iv). At the foot of a ladder is a serpent, which is faced first by Saturus and later by Perpetua (iv). The serpent does not harm her, and she ascends to a garden (iv). At the conclusion of her dream, Perpetua realizes that the martyrs will suffer (iv).

Perpetua&#x27;s father visits her in prison and pleads with her, but Perpetua remains steadfast in her faith (v). She is brought to a hearing before the governor Hilarianus and the martyrs confess their Christian faith (vi). In a second vision, Perpetua sees her brother Dinocrates, who had died from cancer at the early age of seven (vii). She prayed for him and later had a vision of him happy and healthy, his facial disfigurement reduced to a scar (viii). Perpetua&#x27;s father again visits the prison, and Pudens (the warden) shows the martyrs&#x27; honor (ix).

The day before her martyrdom, Perpetua envisions herself defeating a savage Egyptian and interprets this to mean that she would have to do battle not merely with wild beasts but with the Devil himself (x).

Saturus, who is also said to have recorded his own vision, sees himself and Perpetua transported eastward by four angels to a beautiful garden, where they meet Jocundus, Saturninus, Artaxius, and Quintus, four other Christians who are burnt alive during the same persecution (xi–xii). He also sees Bishop Optatus of Carthage and the priest Aspasius, who beseech the martyrs to reconcile the conflicts between them (xiii).

As the editor resumes the story, Secundulus is said to have died in prison (xiv). The slave Felicitas gives birth to a daughter despite her initial concern that she would not be permitted to suffer martyrdom with the others, since the law forbade the execution of pregnant women (xv). On the day of the games, the martyrs are led into the amphitheatre (xviii). At the demand of the crowd they were first scourged before a line of gladiators; then a boar, a bear, and a leopard were set on the men, and a wild cow on the women (xix). Wounded by the wild animals, they gave each other the kiss of peace and were then put to the sword (xix). The text describes Perpetua&#x27;s death as follows; &quot;But Perpetua, that she might have some taste of pain, was pierced between the bones and shrieked out; and when the swordsman&#x27;s hand wandered still (for he was a novice), herself set it upon her own neck. Perchance so great a woman could not else have been slain (being feared of the unclean spirit) had she not herself so willed it&quot; (xix). The text ends as the editor extols the acts of the martyrs.

===Debate over editor===
Scholars generally believe that the &quot;Passio SS Perpetuae et Felicitatis&quot; narrative was in fact, written by Perpetua. If this is true, the text is important because Perpetua is one of the first Christian female writers before the fourth century whose works have survived. The personal account of a female martyr is also rare, as the stories of other female martyrs were recorded collectively. Perpetua&#x27;s style is described as &quot;emotional&quot;, &quot;personal&quot;, &quot;fragmented&quot; and &quot;colloquial&quot;, which is fitting with the circumstances under which she would have been writing. It should still be acknowledged that the style could have been crafted to give the impression of a female martyr&#x27;s diary.

Although some have suggested that the editor of the text is Tertullian, the editor&#x27;s identity remains uncertain. The writing style and content of the edited material do seem to suggest that the editor is male.

Many scholars have examined the male modification and transmission of a female martyrdom story that challenged power dynamics and gender hierarchies within the organized church. This issue of gender may have influenced the redaction tendencies of the editor. Brent Shaw argues that the editor of the story rewrites Perpetua&#x27;s experience in such a way that affirms the technical value of her martyrdom while simultaneously presenting her actions as unnatural. Furthermore, the dream vision of Saturus is considered to be the result of editorial activity, unlikely to have been written by Saturus himself because of its distinctive construction and impersonal bent. If the editor is male, he may have been seeking to show that men and women, rather than women alone, are responsible for the dreams and visions received in the narrative. Others argue that Felicity may have been the initial source for the dream, an attribution changed by the editor in order to circumvent the problematic implications of a female slave who can receive visions.

===Dating issues===
The date of their martyrdom is traditionally given as AD 203. The association of the martyrdom with a birthday festival of the Emperor Geta, however, might seem to place it after 209, when Geta was made &quot;Augustus&quot; (having held the junior title &quot;Caesar&quot; since 198 when his elder brother had been made &quot;Augustus&quot;), though before 211, when he was assassinated. The &quot;Acta&quot; notes that the martyrdom occurred in the year when Minucius Timinianus was proconsul in the Roman province of Africa, but Timinianus is not otherwise attested in history. Werner Eck notes that the Greek version of the &quot;Acta&quot; calls the proconsul Μινούκιος Ὀππιανός, or Minicius Opimianus, who is recorded as proconsul for 202/203.

==Christians challenging the traditions of the family within the text==

In the Passion, Christian faith motivates the martyrs to reject family loyalties and acknowledge a higher authority. In the text, Perpetua&#x27;s relationship with her father is the most prominently featured of all her familial ties, and she directly interacts with him four times (iii, v, vi, and ix). Perpetua herself may have deemed this relationship to be her most important, given what is known about its importance within Roman society. Fathers expected that their daughters would care for them, honor them, and enhance their family reputation through marriage. In becoming a martyr, Perpetua failed to conform to society&#x27;s expectations. Perpetua and Felicity also defer their roles as mothers to remain loyal to Christ, leaving behind young children at the time of their death.

Although the narrator does describe Perpetua as &quot;honorably married&quot;, no husband appears in the text. Possible explanations include that her husband was attempting to distance himself from the proceedings as a non-Christian, that he was away on business, or that her mention of him was edited out; because Perpetua was called the bride of Christ, omission of her husband may have been intended to reduce any sexual implications (xviii). Regardless, the absence of a husband in the text leads Perpetua to assume new family loyalties and a new identity in relation to Christ.

Perpetua belonged to an aristocratic family with Roman citizenship, as indicated by her name Vibia Perpetua. Perpetua&#x27;s execution alongside slaves demonstrated Christianity&#x27;s ability to transcend social distinctions, in contrast to the inequality that pervaded Roman religion and society. As Perpetua and Felicity were equal in martyrdom despite differences in class, they made the dramatic statement that Christianity transcended social structure.

==Evidence for Montanism in the text==

Some scholars believe that &quot;The Passion of Saints Perpetua and Felicity&quot; present a Montanist theology.
Montanism was a doctrine of early Christianity that arose in Phrygia, modern Turkey. The movement was founded by Montanus; a recent convert to Christianity, said by early church father Saint Jerome to have been previously a priest of Cybele, who had shared his ideas with followers. The group emphasized a belief in the continuing presence of the Holy Spirit visible in the prophetic words of Christians.

Perpetua and Saturus had received new dreams and prophesies within the text in accordance with the beliefs and tenets of Montanism. Further evidence for Montanism is that Perpetua and Felicity may have separated themselves from their partners in accordance with Montanist teachings, which allowed and sometimes even encouraged women to leave non-Christian husbands in favor of celibate lives devoted to preaching the Gospel. However, nothing in the text is explicitly Montanist. Opponents of the new prophecy accused its members of having avoided martyrdom, which makes the identification of the Passion text as Montanist less likely.

The editor&#x27;s additions may be an attempt to validate Montanist beliefs, praising prophecy and visionary gifts from the spirit. In the introduction for example, the editor includes a biblical reference to the sons and daughters who shall prophesy in the last days (i). The editor also asserts the importance of acknowledging and honoring both &quot;new prophecies&quot; and &quot;new visions&quot; (i).

Timothy David Barnes, in his &quot;Tertullian: An Historical and Literal Study&quot; (1973, Oxford University Press), initially defended the Montanist tone of the &quot;Passion&quot; as well as of the martyrs themselves. In his second edition (1982), he retracted this opinion, concluding that &quot;[t]he attempt to show that the martyrs, as well as the &#x27;Passion,&#x27; are Montanist must be pronounced unconvincing.&quot; Every single one of the purported &quot;Montanist&quot; features of the &quot;Passion&quot; were (and remain today) utterly compatible with orthodox Catholicism.

==Controversy over Dinocrates==
The account of Saint Perpetua comforting her dead brother has been a point of controversy. The text may imply that the pagan child had not been baptized. Augustine addresses his treatise &quot;On the soul and its origin&quot; to a certain monk Renatus who used this account to bolster his claim that unbaptized infants could attain paradise, if not the kingdom of heaven. Augustine in turn proposed an explanation for how Dinocrates could have been baptized but later estranged from Christ by his pagan father.

==In popular culture==
The once-flowering rambling rose &quot;Félicité et Perpétue&quot; (&quot;R. sempervirens&quot; x &#x27;Old Blush&#x27;) with palest pinks buds opening nearly white, was introduced by Robert Jacques in 1828.

A new translation by Walter H. Shewring in 1929 of &quot;The Passion of Perpetua and Felicity&quot; was printed in a new typeface by Eric Gill given the name Perpetua.

Three historical fiction novels have been written from the point of view of Perpetua. The first was &quot;The Martyrs of Carthage: a tale of the times of old&quot;, which was published in 1868 by Annie Webb-Peploe (writing as Mrs J.B. Webb). Another is Amy Peterson&#x27;s &quot;Perpetua: A Bride, A Martyr, A Passion&quot; (), published 2004. The third is Malcolm Lyon&#x27;s &quot;The Bronze Ladder&quot; (), published 2006.

National Geographic documentary entitled &quot;Jesus Rise to Power&quot; featured the story of Perpetua in its 2nd episode (Martyrs) which was aired in 2013.

BBC&#x27;s documentary series and book &quot;Andrew Marr&#x27;s History of the World&quot; recreates the death of Perpetua in Episode 3.

&quot;Catholic Heroes of the Faith: The Story of Saint Perpetua&quot; is a short animated movie that was released in 2009.

<doc id="163278" wikidata="Q39803" url="?curid=163278" title="Mario Vargas Llosa">
<text>Jorge Mario Pedro Vargas Llosa, 1st Marquess of Vargas Llosa (born 28 March 1936), more commonly known as Mario Vargas Llosa (; ), is a Peruvian novelist, journalist, essayist and former politician. Vargas Llosa is one of the Spanish Language and Latin America&#x27;s most significant novelists and essayists and one of the leading writers of his generation. Some critics consider him to have had a larger international impact and worldwide audience than any other writer of the Latin American Boom. In 2010, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature, &quot;for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual&#x27;s resistance, revolt, and defeat.&quot; He also won the 1967 Rómulo Gallegos Prize, the 1986 Prince of Asturias Award, the 1994 Miguel de Cervantes Prize, the 1995 Jerusalem Prize, the 2012 Carlos Fuentes International Prize, and the 2018 Pablo Neruda Order of Artistic and Cultural Merit. In 2021, he was elected to the Académie française.

Vargas Llosa rose to international fame in the 1960s with novels such as &quot;The Time of the Hero&quot; (&quot;La ciudad y los perros&quot;, literally &quot;The City and the Dogs&quot;, 1963/1966), &quot;The Green House&quot; (&quot;La casa verde&quot;, 1965/1968), and the monumental &quot;Conversation in The Cathedral&quot; (&quot;Conversación en La Catedral&quot;, 1969/1975). He writes, prolifically, across an array of literary genres, including literary criticism and journalism. His novels include comedies, murder mysteries, historical novels, and political thrillers. Several, such as &quot;Captain Pantoja and the Special Service&quot; (1973/1978) and &quot;Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter&quot; (1977/1982), have been adapted as feature films.

Many of Vargas Llosa&#x27;s works are influenced by the writer&#x27;s perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian. Increasingly, he has expanded his range, and tackled themes that arise from other parts of the world. In his essays, Vargas Llosa has made many criticisms of nationalism in different parts of the world.

Like many Latin American writers, Vargas Llosa has been politically active throughout his career. While he initially supported the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro, Vargas Llosa later became disenchanted with its policies, particularly after the imprisonment of Cuban poet Heberto Padilla in 1971, and now he identifies as a liberal and holds anti-left wing ideas. He ran for the Peruvian presidency in 1990 with the center-right &quot;Frente Democrático&quot; coalition advocating for liberal reforms, but lost the election to Alberto Fujimori. Since his exit from directly participating in politics in Peru, Vargas Llosa has advocated centre-right activists and candidates internationally.

Vargas Llosa is also one of the 25 leading figures on the Information and Democracy Commission launched by Reporters Without Borders.

==Early life and family==
Mario Vargas Llosa was born to a middle-class family on 28 March 1936, in the southern Peruvian provincial city of Arequipa. He was the only child of Ernesto Vargas Maldonado and Dora Llosa Ureta (the former a radio operator in an aviation company, the latter the daughter of an old criollo family), who separated a few months before his birth. Shortly after Mario&#x27;s birth, his father revealed that he was in a relationship with a German woman, from which Mario&#x27;s two younger half-brothers would be born: Enrique and Ernesto Vargas.

Vargas Llosa lived with his maternal family in Arequipa until a year after his parents divorced, when his maternal grandfather was named honorary consul for Peru in Bolivia. With his mother and her family, Vargas Llosa then moved to Cochabamba, Bolivia, where he spent the early years of his childhood. His maternal family, the Llosas, were sustained by his grandfather, who managed a cotton farm. As a child, Vargas Llosa was led to believe that his father had died—his mother and her family did not want to explain that his parents had separated. During the government of Peruvian President José Bustamante y Rivero, Vargas Llosa&#x27;s maternal grandfather obtained a diplomatic post in the northern Peruvian coastal city of Piura and the entire family returned to Peru. While in Piura, Vargas Llosa attended elementary school at the religious academy &quot;Colegio Salesiano&quot;. In 1946, at the age of ten, he moved to Lima and met his father for the first time. His parents re-established their relationship and lived in Magdalena del Mar, a middle-class Lima suburb, during his teenage years. While in Lima, he studied at the &quot;Colegio La Salle&quot;, a Catholic middle school, from 1947 to 1949.

When Vargas Llosa was fourteen, his father sent him to the Leoncio Prado Military Academy in Lima. At the age of 16, before his graduation, Vargas Llosa began working as a journalist for local newspapers. He withdrew from the military academy and finished his studies in Piura, where he worked for the local newspaper, &quot;La Industria&quot;, and witnessed the theatrical performance of his first dramatic work, &quot;La huida del Inca&quot;.

In 1953, during the government of Manuel A. Odría, Vargas Llosa enrolled in Lima&#x27;s National University of San Marcos, to study law and literature. While at the university, he was a member of a communist group, embracing the ideology due to corruption and inequality in Latin America. He married Julia Urquidi, his maternal uncle&#x27;s sister-in-law, in 1955 at the age of 19; she was 10 years older. Vargas Llosa began his literary career in earnest, in 1957, with the publication of his first short stories, &quot;The Leaders&quot; (&quot;Los jefes&quot;) and &quot;The Grandfather&quot; (&quot;El abuelo&quot;), while working for two Peruvian newspapers. Upon his graduation from the National University of San Marcos in 1958, he received a scholarship to study at the Complutense University of Madrid in Spain. 

In 1960, after his scholarship in Madrid had expired, Vargas Llosa moved to France, under the impression that he would receive a scholarship to study there. However, upon arriving in Paris, he learned that his scholarship request was denied. Despite Mario and Julia&#x27;s unexpected financial status, the couple decided to remain in Paris, where he began to write prolifically, even as a ghostwriter. Their marriage lasted only a few more years, ending in divorce in 1964. A year later, Vargas Llosa married his first cousin, Patricia Llosa, with whom he had three children: Álvaro Vargas Llosa (born 1966), a writer and editor; Gonzalo (born 1967), an international civil servant; and Morgana (born 1974), a photographer.

==Writing career==

===Beginning and first major works===
Vargas Llosa&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Time of the Hero&quot; (&quot;La ciudad y los perros&quot;), was published in 1963. The book is set among a community of cadets in a Lima military school, and the plot is based on the author&#x27;s own experiences at Lima&#x27;s Leoncio Prado Military Academy. This early piece gained wide public attention and immediate success. Its vitality and adept use of sophisticated literary techniques immediately impressed critics, and it won the &quot;Premio de la Crítica Española&quot; award. Nevertheless, its sharp criticism of the Peruvian military establishment led to controversy in Peru. Several Peruvian generals attacked the novel, claiming that it was the work of a &quot;degenerate mind&quot; and stating that Vargas Llosa was &quot;paid by Ecuador&quot; to undermine the prestige of the Peruvian Army.

In 1965, Vargas Llosa published his second novel, &quot;The Green House&quot; (&quot;La casa verde&quot;), about a brothel called &quot;The Green House&quot; and how its quasi-mythical presence affects the lives of the characters. The main plot follows Bonifacia, a girl who is about to receive the vows of the church and her transformation into &quot;la Selvatica&quot;, the best-known prostitute of &quot;The Green House.” The novel was immediately acclaimed, confirming Vargas Llosa as an important voice of Latin American narrative. &quot;The Green House&quot; won the first edition of the Rómulo Gallegos International Novel Prize in 1967, contending with works by veteran Uruguayan writer Juan Carlos Onetti and by Gabriel García Márquez. This novel, alone, accumulated enough awards to place the author among the leading figures of the Latin American Boom. Some critics still consider &quot;The Green House&quot; to be Vargas Llosa&#x27;s finest and most important achievement. Indeed, Latin American literary critic Gerald Martin suggests that &quot;The Green House&quot; is &quot;one of the greatest novels to have emerged from Latin America&quot;.

Vargas Llosa&#x27;s third novel, &quot;Conversation in The Cathedral&quot; (&quot;Conversación en La Catedral&quot;), was published in 1969, when he was 33. This ambitious narrative is the story of Santiago Zavala, the son of a government minister, and Ambrosio, his chauffeur. A random meeting at a dog pound leads the pair to a riveting conversation at a nearby bar known as &quot;The Cathedral&quot;. During the encounter, Zavala searches for the truth about his father&#x27;s role in the murder of a notorious Peruvian underworld figure, shedding light on the workings of a dictatorship along the way. Unfortunately for Zavala, his quest results in a dead end with no answers and no sign of a better future. The novel attacks the dictatorial government of Odría by showing how a dictatorship controls and destroys lives. The persistent theme of hopelessness makes &quot;Conversation in The Cathedral&quot; Vargas Llosa&#x27;s most bitter novel.

He lectured on Spanish American Literature at King&#x27;s College London from 1969 to 1970.

===1970s and the &quot;discovery of humor&quot;===
In 1971, Vargas Llosa published &quot;García Márquez: Story of a Deicide&quot; (&quot;García Márquez: historia de un deicidio&quot;), which was his doctoral thesis for the Complutense University of Madrid. Although Vargas Llosa wrote this book-length study about his then friend, the Colombian Nobel laureate writer Gabriel García Márquez, they did not speak to each other again. In 1976, Vargas Llosa punched García Márquez in the face in Mexico City at the &quot;Palacio de Bellas Artes&quot;, ending the friendship. Neither writer had publicly stated the underlying reasons for the quarrel. A photograph of García Márquez sporting a black eye was published in 2007, reigniting public interest in the feud. Despite the decades of silence, in 2007, Vargas Llosa agreed to allow part of his book to be used as the introduction to a 40th-anniversary edition of García Márquez&#x27;s &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;, which was re-released in Spain and throughout Latin America that year. &quot;Historia de un Deicidio&quot; was also reissued in that year, as part of Vargas Llosa&#x27;s complete works.

Following the monumental work &quot;Conversation in The Cathedral&quot;, Vargas Llosa&#x27;s output shifted away from more serious themes such as politics and problems with society. Latin American literary scholar Raymond L. Williams describes this phase in his writing career as &quot;the discovery of humor&quot;. His first attempt at a satirical novel was &quot;Captain Pantoja and the Special Service&quot; (&quot;Pantaleón y las visitadoras&quot;), published in 1973. This short, comic novel offers vignettes of dialogues and documents about the Peruvian armed forces and a corps of prostitutes assigned to visit military outposts in remote jungle areas. These plot elements are similar to Vargas Llosa&#x27;s earlier novel &quot;The Green House&quot;, but in a different form. &quot;Captain Pantoja and the Special Service&quot; is, therefore, essentially a parody of both &quot;The Green House&quot; and the literary approach that novel represents. Vargas Llosa&#x27;s motivation to write the novel came from actually witnessing prostitutes being hired by the Peruvian Army and brought to serve soldiers in the jungle.

From 1974 to 1987, Vargas Llosa focused on his writing, but also took the time to pursue other endeavors. In 1975, he co-directed an unsuccessful motion-picture adaptation of his novel, &quot;Captain Pantoja and the Secret Service&quot;. In 1976 he was elected President of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers and oldest human rights organisation, a position he held until 1979. During this time, Vargas Llosa frequently traveled to speak at conferences organized by international institutions such as the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the University of Cambridge, where he was Simón Bolívar Professor and an Overseas Fellow of Churchill College in 1977–78.

In 1977, Vargas Llosa was elected as a member of the Peruvian Academy of Language, a membership he still holds today. That year, he also published &quot;Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter&quot; (&quot;La tía Julia y el escribidor&quot;), based in part on his marriage to his first wife, Julia Urquidi, to whom he dedicated the novel. She later wrote a memoir, &quot;Lo que Varguitas no dijo&quot; (&quot;What Little Vargas Didn&#x27;t Say&quot;), in which she gives her personal account of their relationship. She states that Vargas Llosa&#x27;s account exaggerates many negative points in their courtship and marriage while minimizing her role of assisting his literary career. &quot;Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter&quot; is considered one of the most striking examples of how the language and imagery of popular culture can be used in literature. The novel was adapted in 1990 into a Hollywood feature film, &quot;Tune in Tomorrow&quot;.

===Later novels===
Vargas Llosa&#x27;s fourth major novel, &quot;The War of the End of the World&quot; (&quot;La guerra del fin del mundo&quot;), was published in 1981 and was his first attempt at a historical novel. This work initiated a radical change in Vargas Llosa&#x27;s style towards themes such as messianism and irrational human behaviour. It recreates the War of Canudos, an incident in 19th-century Brazil in which an armed millenarian cult held off a siege by the national army for months. As in Vargas Llosa&#x27;s earliest work, this novel carries a sober and serious theme, and its tone is dark. Vargas Llosa&#x27;s bold exploration of humanity&#x27;s propensity to idealize violence, and his account of a man-made catastrophe brought on by fanaticism on all sides, earned the novel substantial recognition.
Because of the book&#x27;s ambition and execution, critics have argued that this is one of Vargas Llosa&#x27;s greatest literary pieces.
Even though the novel has been acclaimed in Brazil, it was initially poorly received because a foreigner was writing about a Brazilian theme. The book was also criticized as revolutionary and anti-socialist. Vargas Llosa says that this book is his favorite and was his most difficult accomplishment.

After completing &quot;The War of the End of the World&quot;, Vargas Llosa began to write novels that were significantly shorter than many of his earlier books. In 1983, he finished &quot;The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta&quot; (&quot;Historia de Mayta&quot;, 1984). The novel focuses on a leftist insurrection that took place on 29 May 1962, in the Andean city of Jauja. Later the same year, during the Sendero Luminoso uprising, Vargas Llosa was asked by the Peruvian President Fernando Belaúnde Terry to join the Investigatory Commission, a task force to inquire into the massacre of eight journalists at the hands of the villagers of Uchuraccay. The commission&#x27;s main purpose was to investigate the murders in order to provide information regarding the incident to the public. Following his involvement with the Investigatory Commission, Vargas Llosa published a series of articles to defend his position in the affair. In 1986, he completed his next novel, &quot;Who Killed Palomino Molero&quot; (&quot;¿Quién mató a Palomino Molero?&quot;), which he began writing shortly after the end of the Uchuraccay investigation. Though the plot of this mystery novel is similar to the tragic events at Uchuraccay, literary critic Roy Boland points out that it was not an attempt to reconstruct the murders, but rather a &quot;literary exorcism&quot; of Vargas Llosa&#x27;s own experiences during the commission. The experience also inspired one of Vargas Llosa&#x27;s later novels, &quot;Death in the Andes&quot; (&quot;Lituma en los Andes&quot;), originally published in 1993 in Barcelona.

It was almost 20 years before Vargas Llosa wrote another major work: &quot;The Feast of the Goat&quot; (&quot;La fiesta del chivo&quot;), a political thriller, was published in 2000 (and in English in 2001). According to Williams, it is Vargas Llosa&#x27;s most complete and most ambitious novel since &quot;The War of the End of the World&quot;. Critic Sabine Koellmann sees it in the line of his earlier novels such as &quot;Conversación en La Catedral&quot; depicting the effects of authoritarianism, violence and the abuse of power on the individual. Based on the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo, who governed the Dominican Republic from 1930 until his assassination in 1961, the novel has three main strands: one concerns Urania Cabral, the daughter of a former politician and Trujillo loyalist, who returns for the first time since leaving the Dominican Republic after Trujillo&#x27;s assassination 30 years earlier; the second concentrates on the assassination itself, the conspirators who carry it out, and its consequences; and the third and final strand deals with Trujillo himself in scenes from the end of his regime. The book quickly received positive reviews in Spain and Latin America, and has had a significant impact in Latin America, being regarded as one of Vargas Llosa&#x27;s best works.

In 2003 he wrote &quot;The Way to Paradise&quot; in which he studies Flora Tristan and Paul Gauguin.

In 2006, Vargas Llosa wrote &quot;The Bad Girl&quot; (&quot;Travesuras de la niña mala&quot;), which journalist Kathryn Harrison argues is a rewrite (rather than simply a recycling) of Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; (1856). In Vargas Llosa&#x27;s version, the plot relates the decades-long obsession of its narrator, a Peruvian expatriate in Paris, with a woman with whom he first fell in love when both were teenagers.

In 2019 he published the novel &quot;Tiempos recios&quot; (&quot;Harsh Times&quot;), about the 1954 coup in Guatemala.

==Political career==
=== Turn to liberalism ===

Like many other Latin American intellectuals, Vargas Llosa was initially a supporter of the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro. He studied Marxism in depth as a university student and was later persuaded by communist ideals after the success of the Cuban Revolution. Gradually, Vargas Llosa came to believe that socialism was incompatible with what he considered to be general liberties and freedoms. The official rupture between the writer and the policies of the Cuban government occurred with the so-called &#x27;Padilla Affair&#x27;, when the Castro regime imprisoned the poet Heberto Padilla for a month in 1971. Vargas Llosa, along with other intellectuals of the time, wrote to Castro protesting the Cuban political system and its imprisonment of the artist. Vargas Llosa has identified himself with liberalism rather than extreme left-wing political ideologies ever since. Since he relinquished his earlier leftism, he has opposed both left- and right-wing authoritarian regimes.

=== Investigatory Commission ===
With his appointment to the Investigatory Commission on the in 1983, he experienced what literary critic Jean Franco calls &quot;the most uncomfortable event in [his] political career&quot;. Unfortunately for Vargas Llosa, his involvement with the Investigatory Commission led to immediate negative reactions and defamation from the Peruvian press; many suggested that the massacre was a conspiracy to keep the journalists from reporting the presence of government paramilitary forces in Uchuraccay. The commission concluded that it was the indigenous villagers who had been responsible for the killings; for Vargas Llosa the incident showed &quot;how vulnerable democracy is in Latin America and how easily it dies under dictatorships of the right and left&quot;. These conclusions, and Vargas Llosa personally, came under intense criticism: anthropologist Enrique Mayer, for instance, accused him of &quot;paternalism&quot;, while fellow anthropologist Carlos Iván Degregori criticized him for his ignorance of the Andean world. Vargas Llosa was accused of actively colluding in a government cover-up of army involvement in the massacre. American Latin American literature scholar Misha Kokotovic summarizes that the novelist was charged with seeing &quot;indigenous cultures as a &#x27;primitive&#x27; obstacle to the full realization of his Western model of modernity&quot;. Shocked both by the atrocity itself and then by the reaction his report had provoked, Vargas Llosa responded that his critics were apparently more concerned with his report than with the hundreds of peasants who later died at the hands of the Sendero Luminoso guerrilla organization.

=== Presidential candidacy ===

In 1987, he helped form and soon became a leader of the center-right party Movimiento Libertad. The following year his party entered a coalition with the parties of Peru&#x27;s two principal conservative politicians at the time, ex-president Fernando Belaúnde Terry (of the Popular Action party) and Luis Bedoya Reyes (of the &quot;Partido Popular Cristiano&quot;), to form the tripartite center-right coalition known as &quot;Frente Democrático&quot; (FREDEMO). He ran for the presidency of Peru in 1990 as the candidate of the FREDEMO coalition with the support of the United States. Many of Peru&#x27;s political elite in the twenty first century would begin their careers in FREDEMO. He proposed neoliberal policies similar to Fujimori that included a drastic economic austerity program that frightened most of the country&#x27;s poor; this program emphasized the need for privatization, a market economy, free trade, and most importantly, the dissemination of private property. 

Vargas Llosa, according to Rospigliosi, inspired some of the objectives drafted by the Peruvian Armed Forces in Plan Verde, specifically in the volume titled &quot;&quot;Driving Peru into the XXI century&quot;,&quot; which outlined Peru becoming a neoliberal country and called for the extermination of vulnerable populations deemed as economically burdensome. Members of the Peruvian Armed Forces who drafted Plan Verde initially expected Vargas Llosa to win the presidency and support their objectives. Although Vargas Llosa won the first round with 34% of the vote, Vargas Llosa was defeated by a then-unknown agricultural engineer, Alberto Fujimori, in the subsequent run-off. Vargas Llosa included an account of his run for the presidency in the memoir &quot;A Fish in the Water&quot; (&quot;El pez en el agua&quot;, 1993).

== Later life ==
Vargas Llosa has mainly lived in Madrid since the 1990s, but spends roughly three months of the year in Peru with his extended family. He also frequently visits London where he occasionally spends long periods. Vargas Llosa acquired Spanish citizenship in 1993, though he still holds Peruvian nationality. The writer often reiterates his love for both countries. In his Nobel speech he observed: &quot;I carry Peru deep inside me because that is where I was born, grew up, was formed, and lived those experiences of childhood and youth that shaped my personality and forged my calling&quot;. He then added: &quot;I love Spain as much as Peru, and my debt to her is as great as my gratitude. If not for Spain, I never would have reached this podium or become a known writer&quot;.

Mario Vargas Llosa served as a visiting professor of Latin American studies at Harvard University during the 1992–1993 academic year. Harvard later recognized Vargas Llosa by conferring upon him an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in 1999. In 1994 he was elected a member of the &quot;Real Academia Española&quot; (Royal Spanish Academy), he took up seat &quot;L&quot; on 15 January 1996. Vargas Llosa joined the Mont Pelerin Society in 2014. He is also a member of Washington, D.C.–based think tank, the Inter-American Dialogue.

=== Panama and Pandora Papers ===
Vargas Llosa was named in both the Panama Papers (2016) and Pandora Papers (2021) released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. According to IDL-Reporteros, the British Virgin Islands company Melek Investing Inc. was documented to be owned by Vargas Llosa, and was used for book royalty profits and the sale of real estate in London and Madrid. Following the Panama Papers leak in 2016, Carmen Balcells said on behalf of Vargas Llosa that investments were made &quot;without the consent of Messrs. Vargas Llosa&quot; while in the 2021 Pandora Papers leaks, Javier Martín, a representative of Vargas Llosa, said the writer &quot;was not aware of the ownership of that company&quot;. IDL-Reporteros provided a document showing Vargas Llosa&#x27;s signature on a &quot;Consent to Act as Director&quot; form for Melek Investing Inc. as part of the 2021 leak.

==Style of writing==

===Plot, setting, and major themes===
Vargas Llosa&#x27;s style encompasses historical material as well as his own personal experiences. For example, in his first novel, &quot;The Time of the Hero&quot;, his own experiences at the Leoncio Prado military school informed his depiction of the corrupt social institution which mocked the moral standards it was supposed to uphold. Furthermore, the corruption of the book&#x27;s school is a reflection of the corruption of Peruvian society at the time the novel was written. Vargas Llosa frequently uses his writing to challenge the inadequacies of society, such as demoralization and oppression by those in political power towards those who challenge this power. One of the main themes he has explored in his writing is the individual&#x27;s struggle for freedom within an oppressive reality. For example, his two-volume novel &quot;Conversation in The Cathedral&quot; is based on the tyrannical dictatorship of Peruvian President Manuel A. Odría. The protagonist, Santiago, rebels against the suffocating dictatorship by participating in the subversive activities of leftist political groups. In addition to themes such as corruption and oppression, Vargas Llosa&#x27;s second novel, &quot;The Green House&quot;, explores &quot;a denunciation of Peru&#x27;s basic institutions&quot;, dealing with issues of abuse and exploitation of the workers in the brothel by corrupt military officers.

Many of Vargas Llosa&#x27;s earlier novels were set in Peru, while in more recent work he has expanded to other regions of Latin America, such as Brazil and the Dominican Republic. His responsibilities as a writer and lecturer have allowed him to travel frequently and led to settings for his novels in regions outside of Peru. &quot;The War of the End of the World&quot; was his first major work set outside Peru. Though the plot deals with historical events of the Canudos revolt against the Brazilian government, the novel is not based directly on historical fact; rather, its main inspiration is the non-fiction account of those events published by Brazilian writer Euclides da Cunha in 1902. &quot;The Feast of the Goat&quot;, based on the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo, takes place in the Dominican Republic; in preparation for this novel, Vargas Llosa undertook a comprehensive study of Dominican history. The novel was characteristically realist, and Vargas Llosa underscores that he &quot;respected the basic facts, ... I have not exaggerated&quot;, but at the same time he points out &quot;It&#x27;s a novel, not a history book, so I took many, many liberties.&quot;

One of Vargas Llosa&#x27;s more recent novels, &quot;The Way to Paradise&quot; (&quot;El paraíso en la otra esquina&quot;), is set largely in Tahiti in France. Based on the biography of former social reformer Flora Tristan, it demonstrates how Flora and Paul Gauguin were unable to find paradise, but were still able to inspire followers to keep working towards a socialist utopia. Unfortunately, Vargas Llosa was not as successful in transforming these historical figures into fiction. Some critics, such as Barbara Mujica, argue that &quot;The Way to Paradise&quot; lacks the &quot;audacity, energy, political vision, and narrative genius&quot; that was present in his previous works.

===Modernism and postmodernism===
The works of Mario Vargas Llosa are viewed as both modernist and postmodernist novels. Though there is still much debate over the differences between modernist and postmodernist literature, literary scholar M. Keith Booker claims that the difficulty and technical complexity of Vargas Llosa&#x27;s early works, such as &quot;The Green House&quot; and &quot;Conversation in The Cathedral&quot;, are clearly elements of the modern novel. Furthermore, these earlier novels all carry a certain seriousness of attitude—another important defining aspect of modernist art. By contrast, his later novels such as &quot;Captain Pantoja and the Special Service&quot;, &quot;Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter&quot;, &quot;The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta&quot;, and &quot;The Storyteller&quot; (&quot;El hablador&quot;) appear to follow a postmodernist mode of writing. These novels have a much lighter, farcical, and comic tone, characteristics of postmodernism. Comparing two of Vargas Llosa&#x27;s novels, &quot;The Green House&quot; and &quot;Captain Pantoja and the Special Service&quot;, Booker discusses the contrast between modernism and postmodernism found in the writer&#x27;s works: while both novels explore the theme of prostitution as well as the workings of the Peruvian military, Booker points out that the former is gravely serious whereas the latter is ridiculously comic.

===Interlacing dialogues===
Literary scholar M. Keith Booker argues that Vargas Llosa perfects the technique of interlacing dialogues in his novel &quot;The Green House&quot;. By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates the illusion of a flashback. Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places. This technique is a staple of his repertoire, which he began using near the end of his first novel, &quot;The Time of the Hero&quot;. However, he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way in all of his novels. For example, in &quot;The Green House&quot; the technique is used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space. In contrast, &quot;Captain Pantoja and the Special Service&quot; employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts. This device is similar to both Virginia Woolf&#x27;s mixing of different characters&#x27; soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s counterpoint technique in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches. This was seen to occur yet again in Vargas Llosa&#x27;s most current work, &quot;Tiempos Recios,&quot; as two dialogues, one between Trujillo and Castillo Armas, and another between Trujillo and Abbes García, are juxtaposed.

===Literary influences===

Vargas Llosa&#x27;s first literary influences were relatively obscure Peruvian writers such as Martín Adán, Carlos Oquendo de Amat, and César Moro. As a young writer, he looked to these revolutionary novelists in search of new narrative structures and techniques in order to delineate a more contemporary, multifaceted experience of urban Peru. He was looking for a style different from the traditional descriptions of land and rural life made famous by Peru&#x27;s foremost novelist at the time, José María Arguedas. Vargas Llosa wrote of Arguedas&#x27;s work that it was &quot;an example of old-fashioned regionalism that had already exhausted its imaginary possibilities&quot;. Although he did not share Arguedas&#x27;s passion for indigenous reality, Vargas Llosa admired and respected the novelist for his contributions to Peruvian literature. Indeed, he has published a book-length study on his work, &quot;La utopía arcaica&quot; (1996).

Rather than restrict himself to Peruvian literature, Vargas Llosa also looked abroad for literary inspiration. Two French figures, existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre and novelist Gustave Flaubert, influenced both his technique and style. Sartre&#x27;s influence is most prevalent in Vargas Llosa&#x27;s extensive use of conversation. The epigraph of &quot;The Time of the Hero&quot;, his first novel, is also taken directly from Sartre&#x27;s work. Flaubert&#x27;s artistic independence—his novels&#x27; disregard of reality and morals—has always been admired by Vargas Llosa, who wrote a book-length study of Flaubert&#x27;s aesthetics, &quot;The Perpetual Orgy&quot;. In his analysis of Flaubert, Vargas Llosa questions the revolutionary power of literature in a political setting; this is in contrast to his earlier view that &quot;literature is an act of rebellion&quot;, thus marking a transition in Vargas Llosa&#x27;s aesthetic beliefs. Other critics such as Sabine Köllmann argue that his belief in the transforming power of literature is one of the great continuities that characterize his fictional and non-fictional work, and link his early statement that &#x27;Literature is Fire&#x27; with his Nobel Prize Speech &#x27;In Praise of Reading and Writing&#x27;.

One of Vargas Llosa&#x27;s favourite novelists, and arguably the most influential on his writing career, is the American William Faulkner. Vargas Llosa considers Faulkner &quot;the writer who perfected the methods of the modern novel&quot;. Both writers&#x27; styles include intricate changes in time and narration. In &quot;The Time of the Hero&quot;, for example, aspects of Vargas Llosa&#x27;s plot, his main character&#x27;s development and his use of narrative time are influenced by his favourite Faulkner novel, &quot;Light in August&quot;.

In addition to the studies of Arguedas and Flaubert, Vargas Llosa has written literary criticisms of other authors that he has admired, such as Gabriel García Márquez, Albert Camus, Ernest Hemingway, and Jean-Paul Sartre. The main goals of his non-fiction works are to acknowledge the influence of these authors on his writing, and to recognize a connection between himself and the other writers; critic Sara Castro-Klarén argues that he offers little systematic analysis of these authors&#x27; literary techniques. In &quot;The Perpetual Orgy&quot;, for example, he discusses the relationship between his own aesthetics and Flaubert&#x27;s, rather than focusing on Flaubert&#x27;s alone.

== Political views ==
Since distancing himself from left-wing politics, he has embraced right-wing politics. In 1989, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; would write that though Vargas Llosa&#x27;s party appeared center-right, &quot;he has ties with far-right politicians in other countries&quot;. Vargas Llosa has continued to be criticized due to his association with far-right groups and politicians. &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; would call Vargas Llosa &quot;a right-wing maverick&quot; while &quot;Jacobin&quot; would plainly describe him as a &quot;far-right novelist&quot;.

Vargas Llosa has described himself as a supporter of liberalism and said that the individuals who have had most impact on his political thought have included Karl Popper, Friedrich Hayek and Isaiah Berlin. According to &quot;The Nation&quot;, Vargas Llosa would condemn leftist groups entirely due to the controversies of some while minimizing similar actions by neoliberal governments.

He supported right-wing libertarian candidate Javier Milei in the 2023 Argentine general election.

=== Chile ===
Following the arrest of Augusto Pinochet for crimes against humanity in 1999, Vargas Llosa would write an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; asking why left wing dictators were also not being arrested. During the 2021 Chilean general elections, Vargas Llosa expressed support for conservative presidential candidate José Antonio Kast.

=== Brazil ===
During the 2022 Brazilian general election, Vargas Llosa expressed his endorsement for conservative leader Jair Bolsonaro. &quot;The case of Bolsonaro it&#x27;s a hard question. His jokes are very hard to endorse, for a liberal [...] Now, between Bolsonaro and Lula, I prefer Bolsonaro. Even with jokes from Bolsonaro, Lula no.&quot; said Vargas Llosa at a conference.

=== Mexico ===
A month after losing the election, at the invitation of Octavio Paz, Vargas Llosa attended a conference in Mexico entitled, &quot;The 20th Century: The Experience of Freedom&quot;. Focused on the collapse of communist rule in central and eastern Europe, it was broadcast on Mexican television from 27 August to 2 September. Addressing the conference on 30 August 1990, Vargas Llosa embarrassed his hosts by condemning the Mexican system of power based on the rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which had been in power for 61 years. Criticizing the PRI by name, he commented, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe that there has been in Latin America any case of a system of dictatorship which has so efficiently recruited the intellectual milieu, bribing it with great subtlety.&quot; He declared, &quot;Mexico is the perfect dictatorship. The perfect dictatorship is not communism, not the USSR, not Fidel Castro; the perfect dictatorship is Mexico. Because it is a camouflaged dictatorship.&quot; The statement, &quot;Mexico is the perfect dictatorship&quot; became a cliché in Mexico and internationally, until the PRI fell from power in 2000.

=== Peru ===
In April 2011, the writer took part in the 2011 Peruvian general election by saying he was going to vote for Alejandro Toledo (Peruvian former president 2001–2006). After casting his vote, he said his country should stay in the path of legality and freedom.

Since her introduction into politics, Vargas Llosa has had a complex opinion on conservative politician Keiko Fujimori, daughter of president of Peru Alberto Fujimori. During her candidacy in the 2011 Peruvian general election, Vargas Llosa said &quot;the worst option is that of Keiko Fujimori because it means the legitimation of one of the worst dictatorships that Peru has had in its history”, endorsing and calling for Peruvian voters to consider left-wing candidate Ollanta Humala. After Fujimori announced her candidacy for the 2016 Peruvian general election, Vargas Llosa said in 2014 &quot;Keiko is the daughter of a murderer and a thief who is imprisoned, tried by civil courts with international observers, sentenced to 25 years in prison for murder and theft. I do not want her to win the elections&quot;. However, in the second round of the 2021 Peruvian general election, Vargas Llosa expressed support for Keiko, sharing opposition to far-left candidate Pedro Castillo and describing Fujimori as the &quot;lesser of two evils&quot;. French intellectuals, who criticized his addition to the Académie Française, said that Vargas Llosa contributed to the Peruvian political crisis during the 2021 Peruvian general election.

=== Spain ===
In February 2008 he ended his support for the People&#x27;s Party in favor of the recently created Union, Progress and Democracy, claiming that certain conservative views held by the former party are at odds with his classical liberal beliefs. His political ideologies appear in the book &quot;Política razonable&quot;, written with Fernando Savater, Rosa Díez, Álvaro Pombo, Albert Boadella and Carlos Martínez Gorriarán. He continued to write, both journalism and fiction, and to travel extensively. He also taught as a visiting professor at a number of prominent universities. 

Vargas Llosa is opposed to Catalan independence from Spain. Attending an anti-independence rally in October 2017, he said: &quot;Spanish democracy is here to stay. No separatist conspiracy can destroy it.&quot; In 2021 he attended a rally against the pardon of the Catalan independence leaders in Madrid.

== Later personal life and interests ==
He has declared himself a music lover, ensuring that feels a special fondness for Gustav Mahler.

Vargas Llosa is an agnostic, &quot;I was not a believer, nor was I an atheist either, but, rather, an agnostic&quot;.

As for hobbies, he is fond of association football and is a supporter of Universitario de Deportes. The writer himself has confessed in his book &quot;A Fish in the Water&quot; since childhood he has been a fan of the &#x27;cream colored&#x27; team from Peru, which was first seen in the field one day in 1946 when he was only 10 years old. In February 2011, Vargas Llosa was awarded an honorary life membership of this football club, in a ceremony which took place in the Monumental Stadium of Lima.

Starting in 2015, Vargas Llosa was in a relationship with Filipina Spanish socialite and TV personality Isabel Preysler and divorced his first cousin Patricia Llosa. In December 2022, it was announced Vargas Llosa and Preysler had split up.

He was infected with COVID-19 and was hospitalized in April 2022.

==Impact==
Mario Vargas Llosa is considered a major Latin American writer, alongside other authors such as Octavio Paz, Julio Cortázar, Jorge Luis Borges, Gabriel García Márquez, Carlos Fuentes and Isabel Allende. In his book &quot;The New Novel in Latin America&quot; (&quot;La Nueva Novela&quot;), Fuentes offers an in-depth literary criticism of the positive influence Vargas Llosa&#x27;s work has had on Latin American literature. Indeed, for the literary critic Gerald Martin, writing in 1987, Vargas Llosa was &quot;perhaps the most successful ... certainly the most controversial Latin American novelist of the past twenty-five years&quot;.

Most of Vargas Llosa&#x27;s narratives have been translated into multiple languages, marking his international critical success. Vargas Llosa is also noted for his substantial contribution to journalism, an accomplishment characteristic of few other Latin American writers. He is recognized among those who have most consciously promoted literature in general, and more specifically the novel itself, as avenues for meaningful commentary about life. During his career, he has written more than a dozen novels and many other books and stories, and, for decades, he has been a voice for Latin American literature.

A number of Vargas Llosa&#x27;s works have been adapted for the screen, including &quot;The Time of the Hero&quot; and &quot;Captain Pantoja and the Special Service&quot; (both by the Peruvian director Francisco Lombardi) and &quot;The Feast of the Goat&quot; (by Vargas Llosa&#x27;s cousin, Luis Llosa). &quot;Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter&quot; was turned into the English-language film, &quot;Tune in Tomorrow&quot;. &quot;The Feast of the Goat&quot; has also been adapted as a theatrical play by Jorge Alí Triana, a Colombian playwright and director.

==Awards and honors==

Vargas Llosa has won numerous awards for his writing, from the 1959 &quot;Premio Leopoldo Alas&quot; and the 1962 &quot;Premio Biblioteca Breve&quot; to the 1993 &quot;Premio Planeta&quot; (for &quot;Death in the Andes&quot;) and the Jerusalem Prize in 1995. The literary critic Harold Bloom has included his novel &quot;The War of the End of the World&quot; in his list of essential literary works in the Western Canon.

An important distinction he has received is the 1994 Miguel de Cervantes Prize, considered the most important accolade in Spanish-language literature and awarded to authors whose &quot;work has contributed to enrich, in a notable way, the literary patrimony of the Spanish language&quot;. In 2002, Vargas was the recipient of the PEN/Nabokov Award. Vargas Llosa also received the 2005 Irving Kristol Award from the American Enterprise Institute and was the 2008 recipient of the Harold and Ethel L. Stellfox Visiting Scholar and Writers Award at Dickinson College.

On 7 October 2010 the Swedish Academy announced that the 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Vargas Llosa &quot;for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual&#x27;s resistance, revolt, and defeat.&quot; The decision to award Vargas Llosa the Nobel Prize in Literature was well received around the world.

On 18 November 2010, Vargas Llosa received the honorary degree Degree of Letters from the City College of New York of the City University of New York, where he also delivered the President&#x27;s Lecture.

On 4 February 2011, Vargas Llosa was raised into the Spanish nobility by King Juan Carlos I with the hereditary title of &quot;Marqués de Vargas Llosa&quot; (Marquess of Vargas Llosa).

On 25 November 2021, Vargas Llosa was elected to the Académie française.

<doc id="163282" wikidata="Q23517" url="?curid=163282" title="Ricky Gervais">
<text>Ricky Dene Gervais ( ; born 25 June 1961) is an English comedian, actor, writer, producer, director and musician. He co-created, co-wrote, and acted in the British television sitcoms &quot;The Office&quot; (2001–2003), &quot;Extras&quot; (2005–2007), and &quot;Life&#x27;s Too Short&quot; (2011–2013) with Stephen Merchant. He also created, wrote and starred in &quot;Derek&quot; (2012–2014) and &quot;After Life&quot; (2019–2022).

Gervais has won seven BAFTA Awards, five British Comedy Awards, two Emmy Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, and the Rose d&#x27;Or twice (2006 and 2019). In 2003, &quot;The Observer&quot; named Gervais one of the 50 funniest performers in British comedy. In 2007, he was placed at No. 11 on Channel 4&#x27;s 100 Greatest Stand-Ups, and at No. 3 in their 2010 list. In 2010, he was included in the &quot;Time 100&quot; list of World&#x27;s Most Influential People.

Gervais initially worked in the music industry. He attempted a career as a pop star in the 1980s as the singer of the new-wave act Seona Dancing. The band did have success in the Philippines with the song &quot;More to Lose&quot;. He also managed the then-unknown band Suede before turning to comedy. He appeared on &quot;The 11 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot; on Channel 4 between 1998 and 2000, garnering a reputation as an outspoken and sharp-witted social provocateur. In 2000, he was given a Channel 4 spoof talk show, &quot;Meet Ricky Gervais&quot;. He achieved greater mainstream fame the following year with his BBC television mock documentary series &quot;The Office,&quot; followed by &quot;Extras&quot; in 2005. He also wrote the &quot;Flanimals&quot; book series.

Gervais began his stand-up career in the late 1990s. He has performed five multi-national stand-up comedy tours. Gervais, Merchant and Karl Pilkington created the podcast &quot;The Ricky Gervais Show&quot;, which has spawned various spin-offs including &quot;An Idiot Abroad&quot; (2010–2012), starring Pilkington and produced by Gervais and Merchant. In 2016, he wrote, directed and starred in the comedy film &quot;David Brent: Life on the Road&quot;. Gervais has also starred in the Hollywood films &quot;For Your Consideration&quot; (2006), the &quot;Night at the Museum&quot; film series trilogy (2006–2014), &quot;Ghost Town&quot; (2008), and &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot; (2014). He wrote, directed, and starred in the 2009 romantic comedy film &quot;The Invention of Lying&quot; and the 2016 Netflix-released comedy film &quot;Special Correspondents&quot;. He hosted the Golden Globe Awards five times, in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2016, and 2020.

==Early life==
Gervais was born on 25 June 1961 at Battle Hospital in Reading, Berkshire. Gervais&#x27;s father was Lawrence Raymond &quot;Jerry&quot; Gervais (1919–2002), a Franco-Ontarian of French Canadian and Iroquois descent raised on a farm in Pain Court, Ontario, near Chatham, Ontario, who emigrated to the UK while on foreign duty during the Second World War. He worked as a labourer and hod carrier before he met Gervais&#x27;s English mother, Eva Sophia (née House; 1925–2000). They met during a blackout and settled in Whitley in Reading, having four children over a sixteen-year period. Eva died at age 74 of lung cancer. Ricky was the youngest child; his siblings are: schoolteacher Larry (1945–2019), Marsha, a teacher for special needs children (1948–), and painter–decorator Bob (1950–). Prompted by Bob, Gervais began to question the existence of God from about age eight.

Gervais has mentioned in interviews that, as an 11-year-old, he asked why his siblings were so much older than he was; his mother bluntly told him that he &quot;was a mistake&quot;. Gervais has spoken of his appreciation for his family&#x27;s extreme sense of humour. He told BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; that he and his brother Bob spent most of their mother&#x27;s funeral &quot;crying with laughter&quot;. They had been asked by the vicar to tell him something about their mother prior to the service, with Gervais saying, &quot;My brother, just winding up the vicar, said, &#x27;She was a keen racist.&#x27; And the vicar said, &#x27;I can&#x27;t say that!&#x27; So Bob went, &#x27;Oh, OK then... she liked gardening.&#x27;&quot;

Gervais attended Whitley Park Infants and Junior Schools and received his secondary education at Ashmead Comprehensive School. After a gap year, which he spent working as a gardener at the University of Reading, he attended University College London (UCL) in 1980. He intended to study biology but changed to philosophy after two weeks, and was awarded an upper second-class honours degree in the subject from University College London in 1983. During his time there, he met Jane Fallon, with whom he has been in a relationship since 1982.

==Career==
===Music===
For six months in 1983, during his final year as a student at University College London, Gervais and his best friend Bill Macrae formed the new wave pop duo Seona Dancing. They were signed by London Records, which released two of their singles—&quot;More to Lose&quot; and &quot;Bitter Heart&quot;. The songs failed to make an impact on the UK Singles Chart. Despite not being successful in the UK, Seona Dancing did manage to score a hit in the Philippines with &quot;More to Lose&quot;. Gervais also worked as the manager for Suede before they became successful in the 1990s.

In 2013, Gervais performed a live tour as David Brent along with his band Foregone Conclusion, Brent&#x27;s fictional band in &quot;The Office&quot;. He and the band performed songs written under the Brent character, including &quot;Equality Street&quot; and &quot;Free Love Freeway&quot;. Gervais also produced a series of YouTube videos, &#x27;Learn Guitar with David Brent&#x27;, featuring acoustic guitar versions of nine songs.

In 2016, as part of the &quot;Life on the Road&quot; film promotion, Gervais published the &quot;David Brent Songbook&quot; of 15 songs, which he also recorded for the album &quot;Life on the Road&quot; as David Brent and Foregone Conclusion.

===Radio===
Gervais worked as an assistant events manager for the University of London Union (ULU), then was head of speech at the alternative radio station Xfm. Needing an assistant, he interviewed the first person whose curriculum vitae he read: Stephen Merchant. In 1998 Gervais&#x27;s position was made redundant when the station was taken over by the Capital Radio group. Around this time he was also a regular contributor to Mary Anne Hobbs&#x27;s Radio 1 show, performing vox pop interviews in unlikely locations.

After the first series of &quot;The Office&quot;, Gervais and Merchant returned to Xfm in November 2001 for a Saturday radio show, where they began working with Karl Pilkington, who produced the shows and later collaborated with them on their series of podcasts.

In October 2017, Gervais began hosting the weekly radio show &quot;Ricky Gervais Is Deadly Sirius&quot; on Sirius XM, which ran until 2019.

====Podcast====

On 5 December 2005, &quot;Guardian Unlimited&quot; began offering free weekly podcasts, including &quot;The Ricky Gervais Show&quot; featuring Gervais, Merchant and Karl Pilkington. Throughout January and February 2006 the podcast was consistently ranked the number 1 podcast in the world. It appeared in the 2007 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records as the world&#x27;s most-downloaded podcast, with an average 261,670 downloads per episode during its first month. Two more series, each with six podcasts, were released between February and September 2006.

In late 2006, three more free podcasts were released. Together called &quot;The Podfather Trilogy&quot;, they debuted individually at Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas. These three were known by Gervais and Merchant as &quot;The Fourth Season&quot;. In October 2007 another free full-length podcast was released through iTunes, after being originally given out for free during a performance of Gervais&#x27;s &quot;Fame&quot; stand-up tour in London. On 25 November 2007 Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington released another free podcast of just over one hour.

In August 2008, Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington recorded their fifth series of audiobooks, totalling four chapters, which were released on 16 September 2008, and described as the &quot;Guide To...&quot; series. As of May 2011, there are 12 &#x27;Guides&#x27;: to Medicine, Natural History, Arts, Philosophy, The English, Society, Law &amp; Order, The Future, The Human Body, The Earth, The World Cup 2010 and Comic Relief. The conversations typically begin on topic and go out on tangents about other subjects.

In 2021, Gervais launched a paid-for audio series, &quot;Absolutely Mental&quot;, of his conversations with philosopher Sam Harris. Season 2 was also launched in 2021, followed by season 3 in March 2022.

===Television===
====Early television appearances====

Gervais has contributed to the BAFTA-winning &quot;The Sketch Show&quot; (ITV), penning several sketches. His mainstream-TV on-screen debut came in September 1998 as part of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Comedy Lab&quot; series of pilots. His one-off show &quot;Golden Years&quot; focused on a David Bowie-obsessed character called Clive Meadows.

Gervais then came to much wider national attention with an obnoxious, cutting persona featured in a topical slot that replaced Ali G&#x27;s segments on the satirical Channel 4 comedy programme &quot;The 11 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot; in early 1999, in which his character used as many expletives as was possible and produced an inordinate number of politically incorrect statements. Among the other regular featured comedians on the show was Mackenzie Crook, later a co-star of &quot;The Office&quot;. Two years later, Gervais went on to present his comedy chat show for Channel 4 called &quot;Meet Ricky Gervais&quot;, which was poorly received and cancelled after six episodes, and Gervais has since mocked it.

Throughout this time, Gervais also wrote for the BBC sketch show &quot;Bruiser&quot; and &quot;The Jim Tavare Show&quot;.

====&quot;The Office&quot;====

&quot;The Office&quot; started when Stephen Merchant had to make his short film while on a BBC production course. In August 1999 he made a docu-soap parody, set in an office, with help from Ash Atalla who was shown a 7-minute video called &#x27;The Seedy Boss&#x27;. Thus the character of David Brent was created. Merchant passed this tape on to the BBC&#x27;s Head of Entertainment Paul Jackson at the Edinburgh Fringe, who then passed it on to Head of Comedy Jon Plowman, who eventually commissioned a full-pilot script from Merchant and Gervais.

The first six-episode series of &quot;The Office&quot; aired in the UK in July and August 2001 to little fanfare or attention. Word-of-mouth, repeats and DVDs helped spread the word, building up momentum and anticipation for the second series, also comprising six episodes. Following the success of &quot;The Office&quot; second series, Gervais was named the most powerful person in TV comedy by &quot;Radio Times&quot;.

In 2004, &quot;The Office&quot; won the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy as well as Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy for Gervais, who said in a 2015 BBC interview that the award was the gateway to America for him.

&quot;The Office&quot; brand has since been remade for audiences in Sweden, France, Germany, Quebec, Brazil, Chile, The Czech Republic, Finland, India, Israel, Poland and the United States. Gervais and Merchant are producers of the American version, and they also co-wrote the episode &quot;The Convict&quot; for the show&#x27;s third season. Gervais has said that the episode &quot;Training&quot; is his favourite, where Brent plays his guitar and sings. In 2021, on the show&#x27;s 20th anniversary, he suggested the show would not have been produced in 2021 due to cancel culture: &quot;I mean, now it would be cancelled. I&#x27;m looking forward to when they pick out one thing and try to cancel it. Someone said they might try to cancel it one day, and I say, &#x27;Good let them cancel it—I&#x27;ve been paid!&#x27;&quot;

====&quot;Extras&quot;====

&quot;Extras&quot; had its debut on the BBC on 21 July 2005; directed by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, the sitcom ran for twelve episodes and starred Gervais as Andy Millman, a background artist. Millman is more self-aware and intentionally humorous than Gervais&#x27;s &quot;The Office&quot; character David Brent. Guest stars on the first series of &quot;Extras&quot; include Ross Kemp, Les Dennis, Patrick Stewart, Vinnie Jones, Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Stiller, Kate Winslet and Francesca Martinez. A second series began on 14 September 2006 in the UK and featured appearances by Daniel Radcliffe, Dame Diana Rigg, Orlando Bloom, Sir Ian McKellen, Chris Martin, Keith Chegwin, Robert Lindsay, Warwick Davis, Ronnie Corbett, Stephen Fry, Richard Briers, Patricia Potter, Sophia Myles, Moira Stuart, David Bowie, Robert De Niro and Jonathan Ross.
A Christmas special of &quot;Extras&quot; aired on 27 December 2007 in the UK and on 16 December 2007 in the US, featuring guest appearances by George Michael, Clive Owen, Gordon Ramsay, Jonathan Ross and David Tennant.

A &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article remarks that, in making &quot;Extras&quot;, Gervais was influenced by Larry David&#x27;s &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, particularly in the format of celebrities making fools of themselves or subverting their public personas.

In 2007, Gervais won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series for his portrayal of Andy Millman in the second series of &quot;Extras&quot;. As Gervais was not present at the awards ceremony, the trophy was accepted on his behalf by Steve Carell, the actor who starred as regional manager Michael Scott—the counterpart to Gervais&#x27;s David Brent—on the American adaptation of &quot;The Office&quot;.

====&quot;The Ricky Gervais Show&quot;====
&quot;The Ricky Gervais Show&quot; is an animated TV show adapted from the podcast of the same name that debuted on US cable network HBO on 19 February 2010. In the UK, the first series began airing on 23 April 2010 on Channel 4. The show was developed using original podcast recordings from &quot;The Ricky Gervais Show&quot; starring Gervais, Stephen Merchant, and Karl Pilkington. After receiving an enthusiastic following in the US, HBO recommissioned the show for a second series, which aired in 2011, and a third series in 2012.

====&quot;Life&#x27;s Too Short&quot;====
&quot;Life&#x27;s Too Short&quot; began airing on BBC Two on 10 November 2011. Gervais and Stephen Merchant wrote this sitcom from an idea by Warwick Davis. It is described by Gervais as being about &quot;the life of a showbiz dwarf&quot; and as &quot;a cross between &quot;Extras&quot; and &quot;The Office&quot;&quot;. The show stars actor Davis playing a fictionalised version of himself, as well as Gervais and Merchant. Premium cable channel HBO, which co-produced the series with the BBC, had the US rights and began airing the series on 19 February 2012.

====&quot;An Idiot Abroad&quot;====

&quot;An Idiot Abroad&quot; is a travel documentary produced by Gervais and Stephen Merchant in which a reluctant Karl Pilkington travels around the world, with his reactions to people and places recorded. Occasionally, Gervais and Merchant call to surprise him with a new place to visit or task to do. Pilkington reports back mostly complaining about the situation. Gervais says there is no planning; a camera crew follows his friend around filming for many hours, which Gervais edits down to an hour each episode.

Two series and a Christmas special have aired; series one involves Pilkington visiting the Seven Wonders of the World. In the second show, he chooses to complete tasks from a bucket list provided by Gervais, and in the special, Warwick Davis joins Pilkington on a journey following Marco Polo&#x27;s route from Italy to China.

====&quot;Derek&quot;====

In November 2011, Gervais filmed in London a 35-minute pilot episode for a potential comedy-drama series called &quot;Derek&quot;, which aired on Channel 4 on 12 April 2012. The pilot is solely written and directed by Gervais and features him in the title role of Derek Noakes, a 49-year-old retirement home worker, who &quot;loves animals, Rolf Harris, Jesus, &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;, &quot;Million Pound Drop&quot;, and &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;.&quot; The character first appeared in a 2001 Edinburgh Festival Fringe sketch as an aspiring comedian who loves animals and still lives with his mother. Gervais&#x27;s co-host Karl Pilkington makes his acting debut as Derek&#x27;s friend and facilities-caretaker Dougie who also works in the retirement home. British comedian Kerry Godliman plays Derek&#x27;s best friend Hannah and David Earl plays Kev.

Gervais said that the series is about &quot;kindness [being] more important than anything else&quot;. He added: &quot;It&#x27;s about the forgotten—everyone&#x27;s forgotten. It&#x27;s all these arbitrary people who didn&#x27;t know each other, and they&#x27;re in there now because they&#x27;re in the last years of their life. And it&#x27;s about the people who help them, who themselves are losers and have their own problems. It&#x27;s about a bunch of people with nothing, but making the most of it, and they&#x27;re together.&quot; He chose to set the sitcom in a retirement home after he watched &quot;Secret Millionaire&quot;—&quot;It was always these people with huge problems who were helping other people. I thought about having Derek help old people because no one cares about old people in this country ... I think it&#x27;s perfect for now.&quot;

Channel 4 commissioned a full series of &quot;Derek&quot; that aired in early 2013. &quot;Derek&quot; was recommissioned for a second series, which premiered on 23 April 2014. &quot;Derek&quot; ended with a one-off final special, broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK on 22 December 2014.

====&quot;After Life&quot;====
On 9 May 2018, it was announced that Netflix had given a production order for the first season of the comedy drama &quot;After Life&quot;. It was created and directed by Gervais, who also starred in it and executive-produced it with Duncan Hayes, with Charlie Hanson as producer; the series premiered on 8 March 2019. On 3 April 2019, Netflix renewed the series for a second season, which launched on 24 April 2020. In May 2020, it was announced that Gervais had signed a new deal with Netflix, including a third season of &quot;After Life&quot;. Before the announcement Gervais said, &quot;For the first time ever, I would do a series three, because the world&#x27;s so rich. I love the characters, I love all the actors in it, I love my character, I love the town, I love the themes… I love the dog!&quot;

===Stand-up comedy===
Gervais began his stand-up career in the late 1990s. His first successful show was at the Café Royal as part of the 2001 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Titled &quot;Rubbernecker&quot;, it also featured Jimmy Carr, Robin Ince and Stephen Merchant.

Gervais toured the UK in 2003 with his stand-up show &quot;Animals&quot;. The &quot;Politics&quot; tour followed a year later. Both shows were recorded for release on DVD and television broadcast. The third part of the themed live trilogy, &quot;Fame&quot;, took place in 2007. It started in Glasgow in January and ended in Sheffield in April. Blackpool reported selling out of tickets within 45 minutes of them going on sale. &quot;Newsnight Review&quot;&#x27;s panel saw &quot;Animals&quot; during its Bloomsbury run and covered it in January 2003. They were not favourable, with &quot;Private Eye&quot; editor Ian Hislop saying it was &quot;cobbled together ... banal ... a bit flat&quot;. After this, Gervais closed each show by calling Hislop an &quot;ugly little pug-faced cunt&quot;. &quot;Fame&quot; was the subject of some controversy in January 2007 when Gervais included a routine, ostensibly about how people will do anything to become famous, referring to the murder of prostitutes in Ipswich.
Gervais&#x27;s fourth show was entitled &quot;Science&quot;, and commenced with an eleven-date tour in August 2009 at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in Glasgow. The DVD was released on 15 November 2010. In November 2009, he headlined the sixth annual New York Comedy Festival at Carnegie Hall. In 2013, Gervais announced that his next stand-up show would be called &quot;Humanity&quot;. In December 2014, he said he was too busy to do the tour due to producing two films. In May 2016, Gervais performed stand-up in London, starting with some low key warm-ups with cast members from &quot;Derek&quot;. He said: &quot;Finally, I&#x27;m going to do some stand-up. The first in about six years if you don&#x27;t count hosting the Golden Globes&quot;.

He continued his &quot;Humanity&quot; show throughout 2017 and into 2018. He appeared at SF Sketchfest as part of the tour, which devoted a night in honour of him, alongside comedic legend and mentor Christopher Guest. His next tour and Netflix special &quot;SuperNature&quot; was announced in late 2018, where Gervais warned people not to travel to see &quot;work in progress&quot; as it would be a &quot;shambles&quot;. &quot;SuperNature&quot; shows continued through 2019 and 2020. Following significant cancellations and postponements as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the &quot;SuperNature&quot; tours resumed in August 2021. &quot;SuperNature&quot; received criticism for jokes about transgender people. It won the Best Stand-Up Show at the National Comedy Awards. In May 2023, in the world-wide tour of his comedy special, &quot;Armageddon&quot;, he was reported to have a earned £1.41 million for a single stand-up gig, at the Hollywood Bowl, the highest-grossing one-off gig ever by a British comedian. The show was released on Netflix on 25 December 2023 but faced controversy for making a joke about cancer patients. The special later won for &quot;Best Performance in Stand-Up Comedy on Television&quot; at the 81st Golden Globe Awards, but Gervais didn&#x27;t attend the ceremony.

====Animation====
One of the first animations Gervais voiced was the character of Penguin in Robbie the Reindeer&#x27;s &quot;Legend of the Lost Tribe&quot;. He had a starring role in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Valiant&quot;, with Ewan McGregor, John Cleese and Jim Broadbent, as pigeon Bugsy.

Gervais guest-starred in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; entitled &quot;Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife&quot;. He is the only British comic to write and star in a &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode. The episode was the highest-rated in Sky One&#x27;s history; it revolved around the angle that Gervais was the episode&#x27;s sole writer (and the first guest star on the show to also receive a writing credit for the episode of his appearance). Gervais clarified the extent of his input in a joint interview (with Christopher Guest) for &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; magazine (January 2006): &quot;No, all I did was put down a load of observations on an email and they made it look like a &quot;Simpsons&quot; script. I&#x27;m going to get the credit, but I think everyone in the industry knows it was a joint effort&quot;. Asked in a separate interview about how his idea for the episode (in which Homer swaps Marge on a game show) came about, Gervais replied: &quot;I&#x27;ve always been fascinated with reality game shows but I think it was my girlfriend&#x27;s idea. We watch &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; at the moment, we watch &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity, Get Me out of Here...&quot; we watch all those reality TV shows—&quot;The Office&quot; came out of those docu-soaps&quot;. Gervais, a longstanding &quot;Simpsons&quot; fan, presented a segment to mark the show&#x27;s 20th anniversary on BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;The Culture Show&quot; on 16 June 2007.

In 2012, Gervais made a guest appearance on &quot;Family Guy&quot; in the episode titled &quot;Be Careful What You Fish For&quot;. In the episode, Gervais plays a dolphin named Billy Finn who gives Peter Griffin a Mercedes-Benz hood ornament, and Peter half-heartedly promises a favour to him. Soon, Billy moves to Quahog but outstays his welcome at Peter&#x27;s. Peter tries to reunite Billy with his ex-wife in hopes that he will return to the ocean. The episode also featured Lucy Davis, with whom Gervais starred in &quot;The Office&quot;.

====Guest star on television series====
Gervais had a cameo role in Simon Pegg&#x27;s and Jessica Hynes&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Spaced&quot; as Dave, an estate agent who mistakenly places the advertisement for a property for a couple that turns out to be the premise of the show. Gervais has also guest-starred on &quot;Alias&quot; (in the third-season episode &quot;Façade&quot;) as Daniel Ryan, a former Royal Navy bomb-disposal specialist turned rogue Irish Republican Army bomb-maker. He has also made guest appearances on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

Louis C.K. had Gervais play Dr Ben, his doctor, on two episodes of his series &quot;Louie&quot;. Gervais broke into his trademark hysterical laugh every time his character made Louie the butt of a joke. In early 2015, Gervais guest-starred in &quot;Galavant&quot;, a four-week comedy mini-series, as Xanax the magician. It aired on ABC and Gervais got to show off his singing skills.

====Entertainment====

Gervais made a cameo appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in a Digital Short, during which he joked that &quot;The Office&quot; was adapted from a Japanese programme of the same name (with Steve Carell reprising his role as Michael Scott). The sketch re-creates scenes from the American and British pilot episode with Japanese elements (although in an exaggerated way). &quot;It&#x27;s funny&quot;, Gervais laughs at the end, &quot;because it&#x27;s racist&quot;.

Gervais hosted the 67th, 68th, 69th, 73rd and 77th Golden Globe Awards. His appearance in 2010 made him the first master of ceremonies since 1995. He stated: &quot;I have resisted many other offers like this, but there are just some things you don&#x27;t turn down.&quot; His performance as host received a mixed response, with positive reviews from the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; and the Associated Press, but also some negative comments from &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;. His 2011 hosting of the awards was controversial for his jokes that were at the expense of many of the nominees, similar to the New York Friars Club roast-style jokes. His jibes were described as setting &quot;a corrosive tone&quot; by one critic, though some celebrities were seen crying from laughter, leaving the overall reaction to be &#x27;mixed&#x27;. Gervais responded: &quot;They are my friends, but I had to play the outsider.&quot; His 2020 hosting performance, particularly the opening monologue, garnered both praise and criticism from the public and press. He later responded to the negative media coverage by tweeting: &quot;I always knew that there were morons in the world that took jokes seriously, but I&#x27;m surprised that some journalists do.&quot; He also stated several times during the opening monologue that it would be his final appearance as host, though he made a similar declaration during his first hosting performance in 2010.

Gervais was a guest judge on Jerry Seinfeld&#x27;s NBC show &quot;The Marriage Ref&quot; alongside Larry David and Madonna. He has also been a regular guest on Seinfeld&#x27;s &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot;. &quot;Talking Funny&quot;, which first aired on 28 April 2011, starred Gervais and fellow standup comedians Louis C.K., Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld having an informal round-table discussion on stand-up comedy. This one off HBO special was well received by critics &amp; audience alike. In 2013, Gervais guest starred in &quot;David Blaine: Real or Magic&quot;, a television special where Blaine proceeded to run a large needle through his forearm in front of Gervais.

====Talk shows====
In January 2006, Gervais interviewed Larry David in a one-off special, &quot;Ricky Gervais Meets... Larry David&quot;. On 25 and 26 December 2006 he interviewed Christopher Guest and Garry Shandling which aired on Channel 4. There are no plans for further episodes of &quot;Meets...&quot;, although editions with Monty Python co-founder John Cleese and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening were recorded in 2006 for broadcast in 2007. A source claimed, &quot;The Shandling experience put him off for good&quot;.

In January 2009, Gervais was a guest on BravoTV &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; season 15 with James Lipton, where at one point of the interview he answered Lipton&#x27;s question as David Brent, his character from &quot;The Office&quot;. Brent obliged the audience by singing his song &quot;Freelove Freeway&quot; with a guitar supplied to him by Lipton.

Gervais has been on &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot; 26 times. In 2008, he helped Letterman read out the &quot;Late Show&quot; Top Ten List, Top Ten Stupid Things Americans Say To Brits. In mid-2014, upon hearing that Letterman was up for retirement, Gervais jokingly tried to discourage him by suggesting they go on a road trip where they would spend all their money.

Gervais has appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; many times over the years. He has been on Graham Norton&#x27;s couch with Stephen Merchant, co-creator and co-writer of &quot;The Office&quot;, to promote &quot;Cemetery Junction&quot;. Another appearance saw him talk about his series &quot;Life&#x27;s Too Short&quot;; Johnny Depp, who was there to promote his own film, was also present.

===Video games===
Gervais is one of two featured comedians (the other being Katt Williams) in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; who performs at the Split Sides comedy club on the virtual stand-up stage and as an interviewee on the in game radio station &quot;We Know The Truth&quot;. For the stand-up bit a special three-minute act was written, recorded and fully motion-captured.

===Books===
====&quot;Flanimals&quot;====
Gervais released a children&#x27;s book in 2004, &quot;Flanimals&quot; (illustrated by Rob Steen), which depicted nonsense animals. After the success of this book, he released its sequel &quot;More Flanimals&quot; in 2005, with &quot;Flanimals of the Deep&quot; coming the next year. A new Flanimals book, &quot;&quot;, was released in October 2007. &quot;Flanimals: Pop Up&quot; was also published in 2009.

====Published television scripts====
&quot;The Office&quot; scripts have been released in book form, with series one issued in 2002, and the remaining episodes following in 2003. &quot;Extras: The Illustrated Scripts: Series 1 &amp; 2&quot; has been released, as well.

====Other books====
&quot;The World of Karl Pilkington&quot; was presented by Gervais and Merchant. These were essentially transcripts of Xfm shows podcasts and featured illustrations by Pilkington.

===Film===
Gervais&#x27;s film career has included supporting roles as the voice of a pigeon, Bugsy, in 2005&#x27;s &quot;Valiant&quot;, as a studio executive in 2006&#x27;s &quot;For Your Consideration&quot;, as museum director Dr. McPhee in 2006&#x27;s &quot;Night at the Museum&quot; and its sequels &quot;Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian&quot; and &quot;Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb&quot;, and as &quot;Ferdy the Fence&quot; in the 2007 film &quot;Stardust&quot;. Gervais starred in &quot;Ghost Town&quot; (2008) as a dentist who sees spirits, and was in Lowell, Massachusetts during May 2008 filming his next project, &quot;The Invention of Lying&quot; (2009), in which he starred alongside Jennifer Garner, Rob Lowe and Louis C.K.. The social comedy, was co-written and co-directed by Gervais and Matt Robinson. Gervais and collaborator Stephen Merchant made a film called &quot;Cemetery Junction&quot;, set in 1970s Britain, about class, love and fulfilment. The film was released in April 2010. Gervais starred in &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot; (2014) as Dominic Badguy, the partner of the movie&#x27;s villain, Constantine.

Gervais directed and starred in, &quot;Special Correspondents&quot;, which began filming in May 2015. The comedy stars Eric Bana as a journalist and Gervais as his assistant. They pretend to report news from a war torn country but in actuality they are safe in New York. The film was released on Netflix. Gervais directed and starred in the 2016 film &quot;David Brent: Life on the Road&quot;, a mockumentary following David Brent, a character first seen in &quot;The Office&quot; series, as he lives his dream of being a rockstar. On 5 November 2015 Gervais signed up to play Ika Chu, a villainous cat, in an animated film &quot;Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank&quot;, originally known as &quot;Blazing Samurai&quot;. The movie is about a dog (Hank) played by Michael Cera, who wants to be a warrior and fights with Ika Chu for the town of Kakamucho.

In 2023, the BBC aired &quot;7 Minutes&quot;, a short film about two people wanting to commit suicide at the same train station. Directed by Gervais, the film is part of the station&#x27;s &quot;Comedy Shorts&quot; series and was released in May 2023. In March 2023, Gervais had teased the project when he tweeted a photograph from the setting.

===Other appearances===

On 2 July 2005, Gervais appeared at the Live 8 event held in London&#x27;s Hyde Park, where he performed his famous dance from &quot;The Office&quot;.

===Concert for Diana and Live Earth===
On 1 July 2007, Gervais performed at the Concert for Diana at Wembley, a music event celebrating the life of Princess Diana 10 years after her death. Towards the end of the event—after a pre-recorded introduction from Ben Stiller—Gervais appeared along with fellow &quot;Office&quot; star Mackenzie Crook. They performed &quot;Free Love Freeway&quot;, a song previously heard in the fourth episode of series one of &quot;The Office&quot;. Due to a technical problem, Gervais then had to fill time until he was able to re-introduce Elton John to close the show, so he did the David Brent dance, as well as singing the &quot;Little Fat Man&quot; song as performed by David Bowie in episode two of the second series of &quot;Extras&quot;.

In July 2007, following Gervais&#x27;s appearance at the memorial concert for the Princess of Wales, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ran a column by &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; television critic Jim Shelley entitled &quot;Call Me Crazy... But Has Ricky Gervais Lost It?&quot;, where he described Gervais as a &quot;tiresome embarrassment&quot;. The following week, &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that Gervais had responded with &quot;an exhilaratingly foul-mouthed tirade&quot; on his website, concluding with the sentence &quot;yes I am resting on my fucking laurels you cunt!&quot; In this video, Gervais mocked Jim Shelley typing the words &quot;resting on his laurels&quot; as Gervais jokingly lashed out by stating that he was resting on his laurels and that he was not going to make another show for television, quipping: &quot;What&#x27;s the point? What is there to beat?&quot;

==Personal life==
Gervais has homes in Hampstead, London, and Marlow, Buckinghamshire. He also has an apartment in the Barbizon 63 building in Manhattan, New York City. He has been in a relationship with producer and author Jane Fallon since 1982, and states they have chosen not to marry because &quot;there&#x27;s no point in us having an actual ceremony before the eyes of God because there is no God&quot; or have children because they &quot;didn&#x27;t fancy dedicating 16 years of [their] lives… and there are too many children, of course&quot;.

He has been vegan for some time. He is an atheist and a humanist, abandoning religion at the age of eight. In December 2010, he wrote an op-ed for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; explaining his atheism. He is an honorary associate of the British National Secular Society and a patron of Humanists UK, a British charity that promotes the humanist worldview and campaigns for a secular state and on human rights issues. On 3 September 2019, he received the 2019 Richard Dawkins Award, which recognises people who proclaim &quot;the values of secularism and rationalism, upholding scientific truths wherever it may lead.&quot; Gervais received the award during a Centre for Inquiry-sponsored ceremony at London&#x27;s Troxy Theatre. Richard Dawkins praised Gervais as a &quot;witty hero of atheism and reason&quot;.

Gervais is a fan of the UFC and Reading Football Club. He is a music fan and has stated that his hero is David Bowie, with his favourite song being &quot;Letter to Hermione&quot;. He has also stated that his first experience of a live music gig was watching Iggy Pop. In 2013, he wrote that Lou Reed was &quot;one of the greatest artists of our time&quot; following Reed&#x27;s death.

Gervais is one of the 100 contributors to the book, &quot;Dear NHS: 100 Stories to Say Thank You&quot;, of which all proceeds go to NHS Charities Together and The Lullaby Trust.

Gervais is a supporter of gay rights and has praised the introduction of same-sex marriage in England and Wales as &quot;a victory for all of us&quot;, saying &quot;anything that promotes equality, promotes progress ... You can&#x27;t take equality &#x27;too far&#x27;.&quot;

Gervais has attracted criticism for the content of his stage routines and social media posts which have been called transphobic.

In June 2017, Gervais endorsed Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 UK general election. He tweeted: &quot;OK. I&#x27;m not telling you how to vote, but this is a fact. The only vote that will keep Theresa May out is a vote for Jeremy Corbyn. Cheers.&quot;

===Social media===
Gervais joined Twitter in December 2009 when he first hosted the 66th Golden Globes. After a two-year hiatus, he returned to the platform in September 2011. In 2012, Gervais won a Shorty Award for Lifetime Achievement for his popular presence on social media. As of July 2022, he was followed by 15 million fans whom he calls &#x27;Twonks&#x27;.

Gervais uses social media to promote his work to his fans. After ten years, he brought back his character Brent on his YouTube channel in a web series &quot;Learn Guitar with David Brent&quot;. He also posts contests or questions to his fans as promotion for his series.

Gervais uses social media to raise awareness of animal welfare. He tweets links to petitions to rescue animals from captivity, he highlights animals involved in scientific and biomedical research, and he encourages people to adopt dogs instead of buying them from breeders. He won the Genesis Award from the Humane Society in March 2015 for his contribution to raising awareness for animal welfare on social media. In 2014, he was named most influential London Twitter user.

===Charity work===
In 2002, Gervais took part in a charity boxing match against Grant Bovey, for the UK charity telethon &quot;Comic Relief&quot;. He was trained for the three-round contest by boxing trainer siblings Kellie and Eugene Maloney, at their Fight Factory gymnasium. It was the second televised charity boxing match, the first being Bob Mortimer against Les Dennis. The fight was televised by the BBC, and Gervais came out on top by a split decision verdict. He donated his £5,000 prize money to the training of a Macmillan nurse who specialised in cancer support.

Gervais is a supporter of animal rights and has stated that he will leave his fortune to animal charities. Gervais named an Asian black bear, also known as a moonbear, Derek, after the protagonist from his series &quot;Derek&quot;. In December 2013, Gervais bought a $1000 cake shaped like a moonbear to raise funds for Animal Asia. Gervais is active in the prevention of illegal wildlife trade; he supported the handing over of ivory trinkets to the Metropolitan police in London.

In 2015, Gervais donated a signed acoustic guitar to help raise funds for Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary in Ontario, Canada, with a special call-out to Pockets Warhol. The guitar, which was signed by Gervais, was purchased by Danny Young from the United Kingdom, who has since had the guitar signed by several celebrities in order to raise further funds for the Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary. Celebrities who signed the guitar include: Brian May, Will Ferrell, Bryan Cranston, Dhani Harrison, Peter Frampton, Ricky Warwick and Steve Cutts.

In 2017, Gervais was awarded the Lord Houghton Award for Service to Animal Welfare from Animal Defenders International. Gervais was also awarded the Humane Society International Cecil Award in 2018 for his frequent social media efforts to end trophy hunting.

In 2021, Gervais joined the Rewriting Extinction campaign to fight the climate and biodiversity crisis through comics. Gervais created the comic story &quot;Bullfight&quot; in collaboration with the illustrator Rob Steen. The comic was released in the book &quot;The Most Important Comic Book on Earth: Stories to Save the World&quot; on 28 October 2021 by DK.

== Influences ==
Gervais has cited Laurel &amp; Hardy, Groucho Marx, Peter Cook and Christopher Guest as significant influences. The decision of John Cleese to stop making his acclaimed 1970s comedy sitcom &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; after 12 episodes—when it was at its creative height—inspired Gervais in keeping his own sitcoms (&quot;The Office&quot;, &quot;Extras&quot; and &quot;Derek&quot;) to 12 episodes each. His comedy is observational and satirises everyday life.

<doc id="163283" wikidata="Q76480" url="?curid=163283" title="Heinrich Mann">
<text>Luiz Heinrich Mann (; March 27, 1871 – March 11, 1950), best known as simply Heinrich Mann, was a German writer known for his socio-political novels. From 1930 until 1933, he was president of the fine poetry division of the Prussian Academy of Arts. His fierce criticism of the growing Fascism and Nazism forced him to flee Germany after the Nazis came to power during 1933. He was the elder brother of writer Thomas Mann.

==Early life==
Born in Lübeck, as the oldest child of Senator Thomas Johann Heinrich Mann, grain merchant and finance minister of the Free City of Lübeck, a state of the German Empire, and Júlia da Silva Bruhns. He was the elder brother of the writer Thomas Mann with whom he had a lifelong rivalry. The Mann family was an affluent family of grain merchants of the Hanseatic city of Lübeck. After the death of his father, his mother relocated the family to Munich, where Heinrich began his career as a &quot;freier Schriftsteller&quot; (free writer). In 1914, he married a Czech actress, Maria &quot;Mimi&quot; Kanova. They divorced in 1930. Mimi, being Jewish, died from the consequences of a five-year detention in the concentration camp Theresienstadt.

==Work and exile==
Mann&#x27;s essay on Émile Zola and the novel &quot;Der Untertan&quot; (published over the years 1912–1918) earned him much respect during the Weimar Republic in the left-wing circles, since they demonstrated the author&#x27;s anti-war and defeatist stance during the World War I, and since the latter satirized Imperial German society; both the novel and the essay became a major impulse for Thomas Mann to write &quot;Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man&quot;, a work supporting the efforts of the German Empire in the war and condemning Heinrich as one of &quot;Civilisation&#x27;s Literary Men&quot; (&quot;Zivilisationsliteraten&quot;), the writers who served the West in its struggle against German &quot;Culture&quot;; later Thomas called the novel an example of &quot;national slander&quot; and &quot;ruthless ruthless aestheticism&quot;, while the novel had such admirers as Kurt Tucholsky. During the revolution, Heinrich became a major supporter of Kurt Eisner, a social democrat revolutionary who proclaimed Bavaria a Socialist republic; after Eisner&#x27;s assassination by a far-right activist, Mann spoke at Eisner&#x27;s funeral.

Later, in 1930, his book &quot;Professor Unrat&quot; was freely adapted into the movie &quot;Der Blaue Engel&quot; (&quot;The Blue Angel&quot;). Carl Zuckmayer wrote the script, and Josef von Sternberg was the director. Mann wanted his paramour, the actress Trude Hesterberg, to play the main female part as the &quot;actress&quot; Lola Lola (named Rosa Fröhlich in the novel), but Marlene Dietrich was given the part, her first sound role. The film helped her achieve her breakthrough, including in Hollywood, and became an icon in film history.

Together with Albert Einstein and other celebrities during 1932, Mann was a signatory to the &quot;Urgent Call for Unity&quot;, asking the voters to reject the Nazis. Einstein and Mann had previously co-authored a letter during 1931 condemning the murder of Croatian scholar Milan Šufflay.

Mann became &quot;persona non grata&quot; in Nazi Germany and left even before the Reichstag fire of 1933. He went to France where he lived in Paris and Nice. During the German occupation, he made his way to Marseille, where he was aided by Varian Fry in September 1940 to escape to Spain. Assisted by Justus Rosenberg, he and his wife Nelly Kröger, his nephew Golo Mann, Alma Mahler-Werfel and Franz Werfel hiked for six hours across the border at Port Bou. After arriving in Portugal, the group stayed in Monte Estoril, at the Grande Hotel D&#x27;Itália, between September 18 and October 4, 1940. On October 4, 1940, they boarded the &quot;S.S. Nea Hellas&quot;, headed for New York City. 
He then lived poor and sickly in Los Angeles, supported by his brother Thomas, who lived in Pacific Palisades (Thomas Mann House). The relationship between the two brothers was always difficult, because Thomas was more successful, received the 1929 Nobel Prize in Literature, had a rich wife, and the brothers differed considerably politically. Heinrich styled himself as a socialist revolutionary, Thomas, perhaps precisely because of this, at least in his younger years, gave himself a conservative image. They also had little appreciation for each other&#x27;s very different writing styles and topics. While Heinrich was considered a womanizer and philanderer who preferred lower-class women, Thomas valued respectability and looked down on his brother&#x27;s constant string of mistresses and prostitutes, whom Heinrich described quite openly in some of his novels and short stories, but at the same time was fascinated by young men. In 1911, Heinrich had accompanied his brother and sister-in-law to Venice, where they stayed at the Grand Hôtel des Bains on the Venice Lido. There he witnessed Thomas&#x27; obsession with a handsome Polish boy, Władysław (Władzio) Moes. Thomas processed his experience in the novella &quot;Death in Venice&quot; (1912). 

The Nazis burnt Heinrich Mann&#x27;s books as &quot;contrary to the German spirit&quot; during the infamous book burning of May 10, 1933, which was instigated by the then Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.

==Later life==

During the 1930s and later in American exile, Mann&#x27;s literary popularity waned. Nevertheless, he wrote &quot;Die Jugend des Königs Henri Quatre&quot; and &quot;Die Vollendung des Königs Henri Quatre&quot; about the French King Henry IV as part of the Exilliteratur. The two novels describe the life and importance of the highly controversial, yet successful and womanizing king, who is ultimately murdered. This work was acclaimed by his brother Thomas Mann, who spoke of the &quot;great splendour and dynamic art&quot; of the work. The plot, based on Europe&#x27;s early modern history from a French perspective, anticipated the end of French–German enmity, similar to how the king had tried to end the religious wars.

His second wife, (1898–1944), died by suicide in Los Angeles.

Heinrich Mann died on March 11, 1950, sixteen days before his 79th birthday, in Santa Monica, California, lonely and without much money, just months before he was to relocate to East Berlin to become president of the East German Academy of Arts. His ashes were later taken to East Germany and were interred at the Dorotheenstadt Cemetery in a grave of honor.

==Popular culture==
Mann was portrayed by Alec Guinness in the television adaptation of Christopher Hampton&#x27;s play &quot;Tales from Hollywood&quot; (1992).

In &quot;Die Manns – Ein Jahrhundertroman&quot; (2001) he was played by Jürgen Hentsch.

<text>Rafael Leónidas Trujillo Molina ( ; ; 24 October 1891 – 30 May 1961), nicknamed &quot;El Jefe&quot; (; meaning the boss), was a Dominican military officer and dictator who ruled the Dominican Republic from August 1930 until his assassination in May 1961. He served as president from 1930 to 1938 and again from 1942 to 1952, ruling for the rest of his life as an unelected military strongman under figurehead presidents. His rule of 31 years, known to Dominicans as the Trujillo Era ( or &quot;La Era de Trujillo&quot;), was one of the longest for a non-royal leader in the world, and centered around a personality cult of the ruling family. It was also one of the most brutal; Trujillo&#x27;s security forces, including the infamous SIM, were responsible for perhaps as many as 50,000 murders. These included between 17,000 and 35,000 Haitians in the infamous Parsley massacre in 1937, which continues to affect Dominican-Haitian relations to this day.

During his long rule, the Trujillo government&#x27;s extensive use of state terrorism was prolific even beyond national borders, including the attempted assassination of Venezuelan President Rómulo Betancourt in 1960, the abduction and disappearance in New York City of the Basque exile Jesús Galíndez in 1956, and the murder of Spanish writer José Almoina in Mexico, also in 1960. These acts, particularly the presumed murder of Galíndez, a naturalized US citizen, the attempted murder of Betancourt, a staunch critic of Trujillo, and the murder of the Mirabal sisters, who were among his most notable opponents, in 1960, eroded relations between the Dominican Republic and the international community and ushered in OAS sanctions and economic and military assistance to Dominican opposition forces. After this momentous year, large segments of the Dominican establishment, including the military, turned against him.

On 30 May 1961, Trujillo was assassinated by a group of conspirators led by general Antonio Imbert Barrera. In the immediate aftermath, Trujillo&#x27;s son Ramfis took temporary control of the country, executing most of the conspirators. By November 1961, the Trujillo family was pressured into exile by the titular president Joaquín Balaguer, who introduced reforms to open up the regime. The murder ushered in civil strife which concluded with the Dominican Civil War and a US-OAS intervention, eventually stabilised under a multi-party system in 1966.

The Trujillo era unfolded in a Hispanic Caribbean environment particularly susceptible to dictators. In the countries of the Caribbean Basin alone, his dictatorship overlapped with those in Cuba, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Venezuela and Haiti. In perspective, the Trujillo dictatorship has been judged more prominent and more brutal than its contemporaries. Trujillo remains a polarizing figure in the Dominican Republic, as the sheer longevity of his rule makes a detached evaluation difficult. While his supporters credit him for bringing long-term stability, economic growth and prosperity, doubling life expectancy of average Dominicans and multiplying the GDP, critics denounce the heavy-handed and violent nature of his regime, including the murder of tens of thousands, and xenophobia towards Haitians, as well as the Trujillo family&#x27;s nepotism, widespread corruption and looting of the country&#x27;s natural and economic resources.

==Early life==
Rafael Leónidas Trujillo y Molina was born on 24 October 1891 in San Cristóbal, Dominican Republic, into a lower-middle class family.

His father was José Trujillo Valdez, the son of Silveria Valdez Méndez of colonial Dominican origin and José Trujillo Monagas, a Canary Islander sergeant who arrived in Santo Domingo as a member of the Spanish reinforcement troops during the annexation era.
Trujillo&#x27;s mother was Altagracia Julia Molina Chevalier, later known as &quot;Mamá Julia&quot;, daughter of peasant Pedro Molina Peña, also of colonial Dominican origin, and teacher Luisa Erciná Chevalier, whose parents were of creole Haitian origin.

Chevalier, Trujillo&#x27;s maternal grandmother, was the daughter of Justin Victor Turenne Carrié Blaise, who was of French descent, and Eleonore Juliette Chevallier Moreau, who was part of Haiti&#x27;s mulatto class. From her mother&#x27;s side, Chevalier was granddaughter of Louise Moreau and her husband Bernard Chevallier Louverture, a mulatto Haitian high-ranking officer and politician that established in San Cristóbal with the Haitian occupation, from whom countless Dominican families descend, who was the son of French nobleman Jean Baptiste Chevallier, Marquis de Pouilboreau and his wife Marie-Noëlle Louverture, the sister of Toussaint Louverture, the Father of the Nation of Haiti. 

Trujillo was the third of eleven children; he also had an adopted brother, Luis Rafael &quot;Nene&quot; Trujillo (1935–2005), who was raised in the home of Trujillo Molina.

In 1897, at the age of six, Trujillo was registered in the school of Juan Hilario Meriño. One year later, he transferred to the school of Pablo Barinas, where he was educated by disciples of Eugenio María de Hostos and remained there for the rest of his primary schooling. As a child, he was obsessed with his appearance and would place bottle caps on his clothes that mimicked military decorations. At the age of 16, Trujillo got a job as a telegraph operator, which he held for about three years. Shortly after Trujillo, aided by his brother José Arismendy &quot;Petán&quot;, turned to petty crime: cattle rustling, check counterfeiting, and postal robbery. He spent several months in prison, which did not deter him, as he later formed a violent gang of robbers called &quot;The 42&quot;.

==Rise to power==

In 1916, the United States began its occupation of the Dominican Republic following 28 revolutions in 50 years. At the time, Trujillo was twenty-five years old and worked as a &quot;guarda campestre&quot; (overseer) at a sugar cane plantation in Boca Chica. The occupying force soon established a Dominican army constabulary to impose order. Trujillo joined the newly created National Guard in 1918 with the help of his employer along with US Major James J. MacLean, who was his maternal uncle Teódulo Pina Chevalier&#x27;s friend, and was soon promoted to second lieutenant and began training with the US Marines. Allegations of forgery were ignored when Trujillo applied and he was later acquitted by a panel of Marines following plausible accusations against him, including the alleged rape and subsequent extortion of a 16-year-old girl. Colonel Richard Malcolm Cutts trained Trujillo further and many Marine leaders praised his abilities at the time, approving his rise among the ranks: he was promoted to lieutenant in 1919 and assigned to the San Pedro de Macorís garrison; he was later promoted to captain in 1922 while stationed in San Francisco de Macorís and given command of the National Guard 10th Company. In 1923 he was promoted to major and appointed Inspector of the 1st military district.

President Horacio Vásquez named Trujillo the commander of the National Police in 1924, he was named brigadier general in 1928, Trujillo militarized the police, turning it into an army. It evolved into a &quot;de facto&quot; independent body under his control. A rebellion or &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; against President Vásquez broke out in February 1930 in Santiago. Trujillo secretly cut a deal with the rebel leader Rafael Estrella Ureña. In return for Trujillo letting Estrella take power, Estrella would allow Trujillo to run for president in new elections. As the rebels marched toward Santo Domingo, Vásquez ordered Trujillo to suppress them. However, feigning &quot;neutrality&quot;, Trujillo kept his men in barracks, allowing Estrella&#x27;s rebels to take the capital virtually unopposed. On 3 March, Estrella was proclaimed acting president, with Trujillo confirmed as head of the police and of the army. As per their agreement, Trujillo became the presidential nominee of the Patriotic Coalition of Citizens (Spanish: &quot;Coalición patriotica de los ciudadanos&quot;), with Estrella as his running mate. The other candidates became targets of harassment by the army. When it became apparent that the army would allow only Trujillo to campaign unhindered, the other candidates pulled out. Ultimately, the Trujillo-Estrella ticket was proclaimed victorious with an implausible 99% of the vote. In a note to the State Department, American ambassador Charles Boyd Curtis wrote that Trujillo received far more votes than there were actual voters. Upon taking office on 16 August, Truijllo assumed dictatorial powers which he retained for the next three decades.

==In government==
Two and a half weeks after Trujillo ascended to the presidency, the destructive Hurricane San Zenón hit Santo Domingo and left 2000 dead. As a response to the disaster, Trujillo placed the Dominican Republic under martial law and began to rebuild the city. He renamed the rebuilt capital of the Dominican Republic, Ciudad Trujillo (&quot;Trujillo City&quot;) in his honor and had streets, monuments, and landmarks to honor him throughout the country.

On 16 August 1931, the first anniversary of his inauguration, Trujillo made the Dominican Party, founded two weeks earlier, the nation&#x27;s sole legal political party. However, the country had effectively become a one-party state with Trujillo&#x27;s inauguration. Government employees were required by law to &quot;donate&quot; 10% of their salaries to the national treasury and there was strong pressure on adult citizens to join the party. Members had to carry a membership card, nicknamed the &quot;Palmita&quot; since the cover had a palm tree on it, and a person could be arrested for vagrancy without one. Those who did not join or contribute to the party did so at their own risk. Opponents of the régime were mysteriously killed.

In 1934, Trujillo, who had promoted himself to generalissimo of the army, was up for re-election. By then, there was no organized opposition left in the country, and he was re-elected unopposed. In addition to the widely rigged (and regularly uncontested) elections, he instated &quot;civic reviews&quot; with large crowds shouting their loyalty to the government, which would in turn create more support for Trujillo.

==Personality cult==

In 1936, at the suggestion of Mario Fermín Cabral, the Congress of the Dominican Republic voted overwhelmingly to change the name of the capital from Santo Domingo to Ciudad Trujillo. The province of San Cristóbal was renamed to &quot;Trujillo&quot; and the nation&#x27;s highest peak, Pico Duarte to Pico Trujillo. Statues of &quot;El Jefe&quot; were mass-produced and erected across the Dominican Republic, and bridges and public buildings were named in his honor. The nation&#x27;s newspapers had praise for Trujillo as part of the front page, and license plates included slogans such as &quot;¡Viva Trujillo!&quot; and &quot;Año del Benefactor de la Patria&quot; (Year of the Benefactor of the Nation). An electric sign was erected in Ciudad Trujillo so that &quot;Dios y Trujillo&quot; could be seen at night as well as in the day. Eventually, even churches were required to post the slogan &quot;Dios en el cielo, Trujillo en la tierra&quot; (God in Heaven, Trujillo on Earth). As time went on, the order of the phrases was reversed (Trujillo on Earth, God in Heaven). Trujillo was recommended for the Nobel Peace Prize by his admirers, but the committee declined the suggestion.
Trujillo was eligible to run again in 1938, but, citing the United States example of two presidential terms, he stated, &quot;I voluntarily, and against the wishes of my people, refuse re-election to the high office.&quot; In fact, a vigorous re-election campaign had been launched in the middle of 1937 but the international uproar that followed the Haitian massacre later that year forced Trujillo to announce his &quot;return to private life.&quot; Consequently, the Dominican Party nominated Trujillo&#x27;s handpicked successor, 61-year-old vice-president Jacinto Peynado, with Manuel de Jesús Troncoso his running mate. They appeared alone on the ballot in the 1938 election. Trujillo kept his positions as generalissimo of the army and leader of the Dominican Party. It was understood that Peynado was merely a puppet, and Trujillo still held all governing power in the nation. Peynado increased the size of the electric &quot;Dios y Trujillo&quot; sign and died on 7 March 1940, with Troncoso serving out the rest of the term. However, in 1942, with US President Franklin Roosevelt having run for a third term in the United States, Trujillo ran for president again and was elected unopposed. He served for two terms, which he lengthened to five years each. In 1952, under pressure from the Organization of American States, he ceded the presidency to his brother, Héctor. Despite being officially out of power, Rafael Trujillo organized a major national celebration to commemorate 25 years of his rule in 1955. Gold and silver commemorative coins were minted with his image.

==Oppression==
Brutal oppression of actual or perceived members of the opposition was the key feature of Trujillo&#x27;s rule from the very beginning in 1930 when his gang, &quot;The 42&quot;, led by Miguel Angel Paulino, drove through the streets in their red Packard &quot;carro de la muerte&quot; (&quot;car of death&quot;). Trujillo also maintained an execution list of people throughout the world who he felt were his direct enemies or who he felt had wronged him. He even once allowed an opposition party to form and permitted it to operate legally and openly, mainly so that he could identify those who opposed him and arrest or kill them.

Imprisonments and killings were later handled by the SIM, the Servicio de Inteligencia Militar, efficiently organized by Johnny Abbes, who operated in Cuba, Mexico, Guatemala, New York, Costa Rica, and Venezuela. Some cases reached international notoriety such as the disappearance of Jesús de Galíndez and the murder of the Mirabal sisters, which further eroded Trujillo&#x27;s critical support by the US government. After Trujillo approved an assassination attempt on the Venezuelan President Rómulo Ernesto Betancourt Bello, the Organization of American States and the United States blocked Trujillo&#x27;s access to US sugar quota profits. 

In April 1962, after the flight of the Trujillo family from the country, Attorney General Eduardo Antonio Garcia Vasquez reported that in the previous five years, the former regime was responsible for 5,700 deaths, either as known murders, or of those missing but presumed dead. The SIM often denied victims&#x27; families the remains of their loved ones, disposing of them clandestinely. In the aftermath of Trujillo&#x27;s assassination, very few of those arrested and killed in the subsequent crackdown had their remains returned, the majority believed by investigators from Vasquez&#x27;s office to have been tossed to sharks, or were stuffed into an incinerator at nearby San Isidro airbase.

==Immigration==
Trujillo was known for his open-door policy, accepting Jewish refugees from Europe, Japanese migration during the 1930s, and exiles from Spain following its civil war. At the 1938 Évian Conference the Dominican Republic was the only country willing to accept many Jews and offered to accept up to 100,000 refugees on generous terms. In 1940 an agreement was signed and Trujillo donated of his properties for settlements. The first settlers arrived in May 1940; eventually, some 800 settlers came to Sosúa and most moved later on to the United States.

Refugees from Europe broadened the Dominican Republic&#x27;s tax base and added more whites to the predominantly mixed-race nation. Trujillo&#x27;s government favored white refugees over others while Dominican troops expelled illegal immigrants, resulting in the 1937 Parsley Massacre of Haitian migrants.

==Environmental policy==

The Trujillo regime greatly expanded the Vedado del Yaque, a nature reserve around the Yaque del Sur River. In 1934 he banned the slash-and-burn method of clearing land for agriculture, set up a forest warden agency to protect the park system, and banned the logging of pine trees without his permission. In the 1950s the Trujillo regime commissioned a study on the hydroelectric potential of damming the Dominican Republic&#x27;s waterways. The commission concluded that only forested waterways could support hydroelectric dams, so Trujillo banned logging in potential river watersheds. After his assassination in 1961, logging resumed in the Dominican Republic. Squatters burned down the forests for agriculture, and logging companies clear-cut parks. In 1967, President Joaquín Balaguer launched military strikes against illegal logging.

Trujillo encouraged foreign investment in the Dominican Republic, particularly from Americans. He gave a concession with mineral rights in the Azua Basin to Clem S. Clarke, an oilman from Shreveport, Louisiana.

==Foreign policy==


Trujillo tended toward peaceful coexistence with the United States government. During World War II, Trujillo symbolically sided with the Allies and declared war on Germany, Italy and Japan on 11 December 1941. While there was no military participation, the Dominican Republic thus became a founding member of the United Nations. Trujillo encouraged diplomatic and economic ties with the United States, but his policies often caused friction with other nations of Latin America, especially Costa Rica and Venezuela. He maintained friendly relations with Franco of Spain, Perón of Argentina, and Somoza of Nicaragua. Towards the end of his rule, his relationship with the United States deteriorated.

===Hull–Trujillo Treaty===
Early on, Trujillo determined that Dominican financial affairs had to be put in order, and that included ending the United States&#x27;s role as collector of Dominican customs—a situation that had existed since 1907 and was confirmed in a 1924 convention signed at the end of the occupation.

Negotiations started in 1936 and lasted four years. On 24 September 1940, Trujillo and the American Secretary of State Cordell Hull signed the Hull–Trujillo Treaty, whereby the United States relinquished control over the collection and application of customs revenues, and the Dominican Republic committed to deposit consolidated government revenues in a special bank account to guarantee repayment of foreign debt. The government was free to set custom duties with no restrictions.

This diplomatic success gave Trujillo the occasion to launch a massive propaganda campaign that presented him as the savior of the nation. A law proclaimed that the &quot;Benefactor&quot; was also now the &quot;Restaurador de la independencia financiera de la Republica&quot; (Restorer of the Republic&#x27;s financial independence).

===Haiti===
Haiti formerly occupied what is today called the Dominican Republic for 22 years – from 1822 to 1844. Prior to their occupation, Spanish colonial rule prevailed. Encroachment by Haiti was an ongoing process, and when Trujillo took over, specifically the northwestern border region had become increasingly &quot;Haitianized&quot;. The border was poorly defined. In 1933, and again in 1935, Trujillo met the Haitian President Sténio Vincent to settle the border issue. By 1936, they reached and signed a settlement. At the same time, Trujillo plotted against the Haitian government by linking up with General Calixte, Commander of the Garde d&#x27;Haiti, and Élie Lescot, at that time the Haitian ambassador in Ciudad Trujillo (Santo Domingo). After the settlement, when further border incursions occurred, Trujillo initiated the Parsley Massacre.

====Parsley massacre====

Known as &quot;La Masacre del Perejil&quot; in Spanish, the massacre was started by Trujillo in October 1937. Claiming that Haiti was harboring his former Dominican opponents, he ordered an attack on the border that slaughtered tens of thousands of Haitians as they tried to escape. The number of dead is still unknown, but it is now calculated between 12,000 and 30,000. The Dominican military used machetes to murder and decapitate many of the victims; they also took people to the port of Montecristi, where many victims were thrown into the sea to drown with their hands and feet bound.

The Haitian response was muted, but its government eventually called for an international investigation. Under pressure from Washington, Trujillo agreed to a reparation settlement in January 1938 of US$750,000. By the next year, the amount had been reduced to US$525,000 (US$ million in 2025); 30 dollars per victim, of which only two cents were given to survivors because of corruption in the Haitian bureaucracy.

In 1941, Lescot, who had received financial support from Trujillo, succeeded Vincent as President of Haiti. Trujillo expected that Lescot would be his puppet, but Lescot turned against him. Trujillo unsuccessfully tried to assassinate him in a 1944 plot and then published their correspondence to discredit him. Lescot fled into exile in 1946 after demonstrations against him.

===Cuba===
In 1947, Dominican exiles, including Juan Bosch, had concentrated in Cuba. With the approval and support of Cuba&#x27;s government, led by Ramón Grau, an expeditionary force was trained with the intention of invading the Dominican Republic and overthrowing Trujillo. However, international pressure, including from the United States, made the exiles abort the expedition. In turn, when Fulgencio Batista was in power, Trujillo initially supported anti-Batista supporters of Carlos Prío Socarrás in Oriente Province in 1955; however, weapons Trujillo sent were soon inherited by Fidel Castro&#x27;s insurgents when Prío allied with Castro; Dominican-made Cristóbal carbines and hand grenades became the rebels&#x27; standard weapons.

After 1956, when Trujillo saw that Castro was gaining ground, he started to support Batista with money, planes, equipment, and men. Trujillo, convinced that Batista would prevail, was very surprised when Batista showed up as a fugitive after he had been ousted. Trujillo kept Batista until August 1959 as a &quot;virtual prisoner&quot;. Only after paying US$3–4 million could Batista leave for Portugal, which had granted him a visa.

Castro made threats to overthrow Trujillo, and Trujillo responded by increasing the budget for national defense. A foreign legion was formed to defend Haiti, as it was expected that Castro might invade the Haitian part of the island first and remove François Duvalier as well. A Cuban plane with 56 fighting men landed near Constanza, Dominican Republic, on Sunday, 14 June 1959, and six days later more invaders brought by two yachts landed at the north coast. However, the Dominican Army prevailed.

In turn, in August 1959, Johnny Abbes attempted to support an anti-Castro group led by Escambray near Trinidad, Cuba. The attempt, however, was thwarted when Cuban troops surprised a plane he had sent when it was unloading its cargo.

===Betancourt assassination attempt===
By the late 1950s, opposition to Trujillo&#x27;s regime was starting to build to a fever pitch, especially among a younger generation who had no memory of the poverty and instability that had preceded the dictatorship. Many clamored for democratization. The Trujillo regime responded with greater repression. The Military Intelligence Service (SIM) secret police, led by Johnny Abbes, remained as ubiquitous as before. Other nations ostracized the Dominican Republic, compounding the dictator&#x27;s paranoia.

Trujillo began to interfere more and more in the domestic affairs of neighboring countries. He expressed great contempt for Venezuela&#x27;s president Rómulo Betancourt; an established and outspoken opponent of Trujillo, Betancourt associated with Dominicans who had plotted against the dictator. Trujillo developed an obsessive personal hatred of Betancourt and supported numerous plots by Venezuelan exiles to overthrow him. This pattern of intervention led the Venezuelan government to take its case against Trujillo to the Organization of American States (OAS), a move that infuriated Trujillo, who ordered his agents to plant a bomb in Betancourt&#x27;s car. The assassination attempt, carried out on Friday, 24 June 1960, injured but did not kill the Venezuelan president.

The Betancourt incident inflamed world opinion against Trujillo. Outraged OAS members voted unanimously to sever diplomatic relations with his government and impose economic sanctions on the Dominican Republic. The brutal murder on Friday, 25 November 1960, of the three Mirabal sisters, Patria, María Teresa and Minerva, who opposed Trujillo&#x27;s dictatorship, further increased discontent with his repressive rule. The dictator had become an embarrassment to the United States, and relations became especially strained after the Betancourt incident.

==Personal life==
Trujillo&#x27;s &quot;central arch&quot; was his instinct for power. This was coupled with an intense desire for money, which he recognized as a source of and support for power. Up at four in the morning, he exercised, studied the newspaper, read many reports, and completed papers before breakfast. At the office by nine, he continued his work, and took lunch by noon. After a walk, he continued to work until 7:30 pm. After dinner, he attended functions, held discussions, or was driven around incognito in the city &quot;observing and remembering.&quot; Until Santo Domingo&#x27;s National Palace was built in 1947, he worked out of the Casas Reales, the colonial-era Viceregal center of administration. Today the building is a museum; on display are his desk and chair, along with a massive collection of arms and armor that he bought. He was methodical, punctual, secretive, and guarded; he had no true friends, only associates and acquaintances. For his associates, his actions towards them were unpredictable.
Trujillo and his family amassed enormous wealth. He acquired cattle lands on a grand scale, and went into meat and milk production, operations that soon evolved into monopolies. Salt, sugar, tobacco, lumber, and the lottery were other industries which he or his family members dominated. Family members also received positions within the government and the army, including one of Trujillo&#x27;s sons who was made a colonel in the Dominican Army when he was only four years old. Two of Trujillo&#x27;s brothers, Héctor and José Arismendy, also held positions in his government. José Arismendy Trujillo oversaw the creation of the main radio station, &quot;La Voz Dominicana&quot;, and later the television station, the fourth in the Caribbean.

By 1937 Trujillo&#x27;s annual income was about $1.5 million ($ million in ); at the time of his death the state took over 111 Trujillo-owned companies. His love of fine and ostentatious clothing was displayed in elaborate uniforms and suits, of which he collected almost two thousand. Fond of neckties, he amassed a collection of over ten thousand. Trujillo doused himself with perfume and liked gossip.
His sexual appetite was rapacious, and he preferred mulatta women with full bodies.
Trujillo was married three times and kept other women as mistresses. On 13 August 1913, Trujillo married Aminta Ledesma Lachapelle, with whom he had 2 daughters, Julia, who died as an infant, and Flor de Oro, who died of lung cancer in 1978. On 30 March 1927, Trujillo married Bienvenida Ricardo Martínez, a girl from Monte Cristi and the daughter of Buenaventura Ricardo Heureaux. A year later he met María de los Angeles Martínez Alba (nicknamed &quot;la españolita&quot;, or &quot;the little Spanish girl&quot;), and had an affair with her. He divorced Bienvenida in 1935 and married Martínez. A year later he had a daughter with Bienvenida, named Odette Trujillo Ricardo.

Trujillo&#x27;s three children with María Martínez were Rafael Leónidas Ramfis, who was born on 5 June 1929, María de los Ángeles del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús (Angelita), born in Paris on 10 June 1939, and Leónidas Rhadamés, born on 1 December 1942. Ramfis and Rhadamés were named after characters in Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Aida&quot;.

In 1937, Trujillo met Lina Lovatón Pittaluga, an upper-class debutante with whom he had two children, Yolanda in 1939, and Rafael, born on 20 June 1943.

In spite of Trujillo&#x27;s indifference to the game of baseball, the dictator invited many black American players to the Dominican Republic, where they received good pay for playing on first-class, un-segregated teams. The great Negro league star Satchel Paige pitched for the Dragones de Ciudad Trujillo, a team organized by Trujillo. Paige later claimed, jokingly, that his guards positioned themselves &quot;like a firing squad&quot; to encourage him to pitch well. Los Dragones won the 1937 Dominican championship at Estadio Trujillo in Ciudad Trujillo.

Trujillo was energetic and fit. He was generally quite healthy but suffered from chronic lower urinary infections and, later, prostate problems. In 1934, Dr. Georges Marion was called from Paris to perform three urologic procedures on Trujillo.

Over time Trujillo acquired numerous homes. His favorite was &quot;Casa Caobas&quot;, on &quot;Estancia Fundacion&quot; near San Cristóbal. He also used &quot;Estancia Ramfis&quot; (which, after 1953, became the Foreign Office), &quot;Estancia Rhadames&quot;, and a home at Playa de Najayo. Less frequently he stayed at places he owned in Santiago de los Caballeros, Constanza, La Cumbre, San José de las Matas, and elsewhere. He maintained a penthouse at the &quot;Embajador Hotel&quot; in the capital.

While Trujillo was nominally a Roman Catholic, his devotion was limited to a perfunctory role in public affairs; he placed faith in local folk religion.

He was popularly known as &quot;El Jefe&quot; (&quot;The Chief&quot;) or &quot;El Benefactor&quot; (&quot;The Benefactor&quot;) but was privately referred to as &quot;Chapitas&quot; (&quot;Bottlecaps&quot;) because of his indiscriminate wearing of medals. Dominican children emulated Trujillo by constructing toy medals from bottle caps.

==Assassination==

On 30 May 1961, Trujillo was shot dead when his blue 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air was ambushed on a road outside the Dominican capital. He was the victim of an ambush plotted by a number of men, including Salvador Estrella Sadhalá, General Juan Tomás Díaz, Pedro Livio Cedeño, Antonio de la Maza, Amado García Guerrero and General Antonio Imbert Barrera.

=== Aftermath ===
The plotters failed to take control, as the later-executed General José René Román Fernandez (&quot;Pupo Román&quot;) betrayed his co-conspirators by his inactivity, and contingency plans had not been made. On the other side, Johnny Abbes, Roberto Figueroa Carrión, and the Trujillo family put the SIM to work to hunt the members of the plot and brought back Ramfis Trujillo from Paris to step into his father&#x27;s shoes. The response by the SIM was swift and brutal. Hundreds of suspects were detained, many tortured. On 18 November the last executions took place when six of the conspirators were executed in the &quot;Hacienda María Massacre&quot;. Imbert was the only one of the seven assassins who survived the manhunt. A co-conspirator named Luis Amiama Tio also survived.

US President John F. Kennedy learned of Trujillo&#x27;s death during a diplomatic meeting with French President Charles de Gaulle.

Trujillo&#x27;s funeral was that of a statesman with the long procession ending in his hometown of San Cristóbal, where his body was first buried. Dominican President Joaquín Balaguer gave the eulogy. The efforts of the Trujillo family to keep control of the country ultimately failed. The military uprising on 19 November of the Rebellion of the Pilots and the threat of US intervention set the final stage and ended the Trujillo regime. Ramfis tried to flee with his father&#x27;s body aboard his boat &quot;Angelita&quot;, but was turned back. Balaguer allowed Ramfis to leave the country and to take his father&#x27;s body to Paris. There, the remains were interred in the Cimetière du Père Lachaise on 14 August 1964, and six years later moved to Spain, to the Mingorrubio Cemetery in El Pardo on the north side of Madrid.

=== United States&#x27; involvement ===
The role of the United States&#x27; Central Intelligence Agency in the killing has been debated. Imbert insisted that the plotters acted on their own. However, Trujillo was certainly assassinated with weapons supplied by the CIA. In a 1975 report to the Deputy Attorney General of the United States, CIA officials described the agency as having &quot;no active part&quot; in the assassination and only a &quot;faint connection&quot; with the groups that planned the killing.

US involvement appears to go deeper than supplying weapons. In the 1950s, the CIA gave José Figueres Ferrer money to publish a political journal, &quot;Combate&quot; and to found a left-wing school for Latin American opposition leaders. Funds passed from a shell foundation to the Jacob Merrill Kaplan Fund; then to the &quot;Institute of International Labor Research&quot; (IILR) headed by Norman Thomas, six-time US presidential candidate for the Socialist Party of America; and finally to Figueres, Sacha Volman, and Juan Bosch. Sacha Volman, treasurer of the IILR, was a CIA agent.

Cord Meyer was a CIA official responsible for manipulating international groups. He used the contacts with Bosch, Volman, and Figueres for a new purpose, as the United States moved to rally the Western Hemisphere against Cuba&#x27;s Fidel Castro, Trujillo had become expendable. Dissidents inside the Dominican Republic argued that assassination was the only certain way to remove Trujillo.

According to Chester Bowles, the Undersecretary of State, internal Department of State discussions in 1961 on the topic were vigorous. Richard N. Goodwin, Assistant Special Counsel to the President, who had direct contacts with the rebel alliance, argued for intervention against Trujillo. Quoting Bowles directly: &quot;The next morning I learned that in spite of the clear decision against having the dissident group request our assistance Dick Goodwin following the meeting sent a cable to CIA people in the Dominican Republic without checking with State or CIA; indeed, with the protest of the Department of State. The cable directed the CIA people in the Dominican Republic to get this request at any cost. When Allen Dulles found this out the next morning, he withdrew the order. We later discovered it had already been carried out.&quot;

An internal CIA memorandum states that a 1973 Office of Inspector General investigation into the murder disclosed &quot;quite extensive Agency involvement with the plotters.&quot; The CIA described its role in &quot;changing&quot; the government of the Dominican Republic &quot;as a &#x27;success&#x27; in that it assisted in moving the Dominican Republic from a totalitarian dictatorship to a Western-style democracy.&quot;

Juan Bosch, the earlier recipient of CIA funding, was elected president of the Dominican Republic in 1962 and was deposed in 1963.

Even after the death of Trujillo, the unusual events continued. In November 1961, Mexican police found a corpse they identified as Luis Melchior Vidal Jr., godson of Trujillo. Vidal was the unofficial business agent of the Dominican Republic while Trujillo was in power. Under the cover of the American Sucrose Company and the Paint Company of America, Vidal had teamed up with the US-American Joel David Kaplan to operate as arms merchants for the CIA.

Joel David Kaplan was the nephew of the previously mentioned Jacob Merrill Kaplan. The older Kaplan earned his fortune primarily through operations in Cuba and the Dominican Republic.

In 1962, the younger Kaplan was convicted of killing Vidal, in Mexico City. He was sentenced to 28 years in prison. Kaplan escaped from a Mexican prison using a helicopter. The dramatic event was the basis for the Charles Bronson action film &quot;Breakout&quot;.

The Mexican police requested for the FBI to arrest and remand Joel Kaplan on 20 August 1971. Kaplan&#x27;s attorney claimed that Kaplan was a CIA agent. Neither the FBI nor the US Department of Justice has pursued the issue. The Mexican government never initiated extradition proceedings against Kaplan.
