<doc id="158890" wikidata="Q3724781" url="?curid=158890" title="Quo warranto">
<text>In the English-American common law, quo warranto (Medieval Latin for &quot;by what warrant?&quot;) is a prerogative writ issued by a court which orders someone to show what authority they have for exercising some right, power, or franchise they claim to hold. The writ of &quot;quo warranto&quot; still exists in the United States, although it is uncommon, but it has been abolished in England and Wales. &quot;Quo warranto&quot; is also used, with slightly different effect, in the Philippines.

==Early history==
With the spread of royal justice in the 12th and 13th centuries, private franchises and liberties were increasingly called upon to uphold the king&#x27;s peace: to act against &quot;malefactors and peace breakers, so that it may appear that you are a lover of our peace&quot;. From 1218 onwards, royal Eyres also began using the old writ of  – a court order to show proof of authority, as for example (literally) &quot;By what warrant are you the sheriff?&quot; – to investigate the origins of such franchises. An inquest of 1255 began examining such liberties nationwide; and the same enquiry was taken up again by King Edward I of England in 1278, when he decreed in the Statute of Gloucester that &quot;We must find out what is ours, and due to us, and others what is theirs, and due to them&quot;.

From one point of view this can be seen as an attempt to investigate and recover royal lands, rights, and franchises in England, in particular those lost during the reign of his father, King Henry III of England. From another, it was less of an attack on franchises as a clarification of them: in Hilda Johnstone&#x27;s words, &quot;Edward&#x27;s aim, it is clear, was from the first not abolition but definition&quot;.

A similar ambiguity surrounds the role of the justices that, from 1278 to 1294, Edward dispatched throughout the Kingdom of England to inquire &quot;by what warrant&quot; English lords claimed their liberties and exercised jurisdiction, including the right to hold a court and collect its profits. Some of the justices demanded written proof in the form of charters, others accepted a plea of &quot;immemorial tenure&quot;; and resistance and the unrecorded nature of many grants meant that eventually, by the (18 Edw. 1) (1290), the principle was generally accepted that those rights peacefully exercised since 1189 – the beginning of the reign of Richard I, which is the legal definition in England of the phrase &quot;time immemorial&quot; – were legitimate.

===Publication===
The pleas from the reigns of Edward I, Edward II and Edward III were published by the Record Commission in 1818.

==Later developments==
The most famous historical instance of was the action taken against the Corporation of London by Charles II in 1683. The King&#x27;s Bench adjudged the charter and franchises of the City of London to be forfeited to the Crown, though this judgment was reversed by the London, Quo Warranto Judgment Reversed Act 1689 shortly after the Glorious Revolution.

But the remodelling of the City of London was only part of a wider remodelling of some forty chartered parliamentary boroughs by the Crown – a policy taken up again in 1688 by James II, when some thirty-five new charters were issued after quo warranto produced the surrender of the old ones. This Quo Warranto remodelling or &#x27;dissolution&#x27; of the parliamentary corporations gave point to the claim by William III that &quot;our expedition is intended for no other design but to have a free and lawful parliament assembled&quot;, and underpinned the charge in the Bill of Rights that James had been &quot;violating the freedom of election by members to serve in parliament&quot;.

==Modern ==
While remains in use in the United States, the Philippines, and other jurisdictions, in some jurisdictions that have enacted judicial review statutes, the prerogative writ of has been abolished.

=== Australia ===
 writs have been abolished in the Australian states of New South Wales (as of the Supreme Court Act 1970) and Queensland (as of the Judicial Review Act 1991).

=== England and Wales ===
The writ of and its replacement, the information in the nature of a &quot;quo warranto&quot; are either obsolete or have been abolished. Section 30 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 grants to the High Court the power to issue an injunction to restrain persons from acting in offices in which they are not entitled to act and to declare the office vacant if necessary.

=== United States ===
 could be brought against a corporation when it misuses its franchise. In 1890, the Supreme Court of Ohio wrote:

In 1876, the Pennsylvania senate passed a resolution instructing the Attorney General to begin proceedings to revoke the charter of the Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York Railroad.

In the modern United States, usually arises in a civil case as a plaintiff&#x27;s claim (and thus a &quot;cause of action&quot; instead of a writ) that some governmental or corporate official was not validly elected to that office or is wrongfully exercising powers beyond (or &quot;ultra vires&quot;) those authorized by statute or by the corporation&#x27;s charter.

In New York State, the former writ of has been codified. Per Executive Law § 63-b, only the Attorney General, at his or her discretion, &quot;may maintain an action, upon his own information or upon the complaint of a private person, against a person who usurps, intrudes into, or unlawfully holds or exercises within the state a franchise or a public office, civil or military, or an office in a domestic corporation.&quot;

=== Philippines ===
A petition was, before the appointment of Jose Calida as Solicitor General, a very seldom used Philippine extraordinary writ. Its name derives from the Latin question , which means &quot;by what authority?&quot; In its early days, during the American colonial period, was mostly used to challenge a democratic election, that is, to make the claim that the person who is holding an office is a usurper, and that someone else deserves the office, e.g., due to electoral fraud or ineligibility. Indeed, this is the only way the term is used in law professor Ernesto C. Salao&#x27;s widely cited 858-page book &quot;The 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines&quot; (2001 ).

It has come to be understood that it can be used in extraordinary cases to unseat judicial appointees, and impeachable officials, not only to challenge elections. Some, such as Ranhilio Aquino, argue this due to the fact that the President and Vice President were explicitly enumerated as vulnerable to by the Supreme Court sitting as the Presidential Electoral Tribunal, and, unlike many other constitutions, Article 11 of the 1987 Constitution does not exclusively grant the power of impeachment to Congress.

==== of non-elected appointees ====
 petitions, when successful, do not &quot;remove&quot; someone from office—they declare the very appointment itself null and void , meaning that the office was never legally held as it has been declared to have been assumed under false pretenses. This is precisely what happened in the highly controversial &quot;quo warranto&quot; petition against Maria Lourdes Sereno. Sereno had served on the Supreme Court of the Philippines as &quot;de facto&quot; Chief Justice of the Philippines from 2012 to 2018, and as a regular Associate Justice since August 2010, when she was appointed by President Benigno Aquino III. Instead of removing Sereno from office by the mechanism of impeachment, Callida chose to use what one justice called this &quot;road less travelled&quot; of .

==== Corporate franchise ====
 was also used, once again by Calida, to challenge the continued operation of ABS-CBN after the expiration of its Congressional franchise. This use of in a dispute over licensure was as novel as it was literal: it strips away the traditions surrounding the use of and refocuses on the meaning of its name, asking by what legal authority does ABS-CBN continue to operate. However, the expiration of the franchise and later actions by the National Telecommunications Commission made Calida&#x27;s petition moot.

<doc id="158892" wikidata="Q1738296" url="?curid=158892" title="Kellogg College, Oxford">
<text>Kellogg College is a graduate-only constituent college of the University of Oxford in England. Founded in 1990 as Rewley House, Kellogg is the university&#x27;s 36th college and the largest by number of students both full and part-time. Named after the Kellogg Foundation, as benefactor, the college hosts research centres including the Institute of Population Ageing and the Centre for Creative Writing. It is closely identified with lifelong learning at Oxford.

Kellogg is lodged in a group of formal Victorian era buildings in residential Norham Manor. As with most of the university&#x27;s graduate colleges, the college has an egalitarian spirit which is reflected by a lack of formal separation between fellows and students. The college has no high table and, uniquely among Oxford&#x27;s colleges, its grace is in Welsh (in commemoration of its official founding on St. David&#x27;s Day). It is also unique in having its own tartan.

The president of the college is Jonathan Michie who is Professor of Innovation &amp; Knowledge Exchange. Michie succeeded the founder of the college, Geoffrey Thomas, as president.

==History==
Kellogg College was the first home for part-time students at the University of Oxford and many of the students who join the college continue to work in their professions while they study. The college continues to promote ideals of access, openness, and inclusivity. the student body numbers 1139 students, of whom 268 are attending full-time and 871 part-time. The college has accepted both women and men as students since its foundation.

The college came into being on 1 March 1990 (as Rewley House) and was renamed in honour of Will Keith Kellogg on 1 October 1994, in recognition of the financial support given by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation to the university over the preceding decade. The college has close connections with the university&#x27;s departments for continuing education, medicine, education, computer science, and law, and other departments active in areas of professional and part-time study. Until 2021, the Director of the Department for Continuing Education was &quot;ex officio&quot; President of Kellogg College.

The college can trace its origins back to the start of the university extension movement in the 1870s. In 1878, Arthur Johnson was the first to deliver an &quot;Oxford Extension Lecture&quot;. The movement grew out of a drive to liberalise Oxford which gained momentum in the 1850s. As a consequence, the university slowly began to open itself to religious nonconformists, poorer men, and women. It is this movement that forms the historical background of Kellogg. The Oxford Extension movement is sometimes credited with taking &quot;Oxford to the masses&quot;. Lectures were given in town halls, public libraries and village school rooms across the country. The aim of the extension movement was twofold: social and political. It aimed at educating the larger community to achieve a better informed democracy.

Kellogg College celebrated its &quot;coming of age&quot; in 2011 and celebrated its 25th anniversary in March 2015.

In November 2019 Charles, Prince of Wales was announced as Honorary Fellow to celebrate Kellogg&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 2020. He visited the college in March 2020 to receive his award.

==Buildings==
Until 2009 the college shared Rewley House in Wellington Square with the Department for Continuing Education. In May 2004, the college acquired a site for a new permanent home, located between Banbury Road and Bradmore Road, in the Norham Manor area of North Oxford, a 10-minute walk from Wellington Square. The existing Victorian buildings have been renovated to provide a dining hall, residential accommodation, offices, study facilities, and research space. The college offices moved to the Banbury Road site in April 2006.

=== The Hub ===
The Hub opened on 2 May 2017 and was shortlisted for an RIBA (Royal Institute of British Architects) South Regional Award. It is the first Passivhaus-certified project at the University of Oxford. The Hub Café is cashless, requiring all payments to be made by card.

=== Geoffrey Thomas House ===
Geoffrey Thomas House is located at 60 Banbury Road and is named after the first college president Geoffrey Thomas. The building was designed by William Wilkinson and constructed in 1865–1866. A rear extension was constructed in 1902.

Geoffrey Thomas House houses the college library on the ground and first floor. Facilities include six reading-rooms, all with wireless connectivity and three with power points for the desk-based use of laptops, and a computer room with printing/copying facilities.

=== Seminar rooms ===
The Mawby Room is located between 60 and 62 Banbury Road, and was named after Russell Mawby. It is located to the immediate left of the main reception area, and provides movable furniture, a lectern and a projector.

=== Accommodation ===
Kellogg College provides accommodation for both full-time and part-time students. In addition to accommodation owned by the college, the college is also able to offer university-owned accommodation.

==Administration==
Together with Reuben and St Cross, Kellogg is one of only three Oxford colleges without a royal charter. It is officially a society of the university rather than an independent college. The main difference from an independent college is that the Director of the Department for Continuing Education is &quot;ex officio&quot; President; in other colleges, the head of house is elected and appointed by the governing body directly. For accounting purposes, the societies are considered departments of the university.

==Sport==
Kellogg maintains a strong presence: former Heineken Cup winner Dom Waldouck was elected as the university&#x27;s Rugby Captain for 2018 while Johanna Dombrowski was a recent President of Oxford University RFC women&#x27;s team. 

=== Rowing ===

Kellogg students row for Christ Church Boat Club in college competitions and also row in the university Boat Races against Cambridge. In 2013, Kellogg students rowed in the victorious men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, women&#x27;s lightweight and reserve boats. Later in 2016, alumnus Paul Bennett won a gold medal for Great Britain in the Rio Olympics as did current student Grace Clough in the Paralympics.

=== Gym ===
Whilst Kellogg College does not have its own dedicated gym, members of the college are provided with free access to the University Sports Centre on Iffley Road. Additionally, as Kellogg College is a postgraduate-only college, all of its members are eligible to join The Oxford University Club free of charge. For an additional fee, members may utilise the onsite gym.

=== Punting ===
Kellogg College has its own punt, currently moored at the Cherwell Boathouse on Bardwell Road. The punt is free to use by members of the college, but must be booked in advance.

=== Cricket ===

Kellogg College has a cricket team, &quot;The Cougars&quot;, which plays in the Cuppers intercollegiate competition. The club was established in 2022. In its second year The Cougars progressed past 27 teams to reach the final of the intercollegiate Twenty20 league.

=== Football ===

Kellogg&#x27;s football club was founded in Michaelmas 2012 and has been competing in the third division of the university&#x27;s Middle Common Room Football League since.

==Traditions==
===Coat of arms===
===College grace===
Kellogg&#x27;s College grace has the distinction of being the only grace in the Welsh language at any Oxbridge college. It was chosen to commemorate the foundation of the college on St David&#x27;s Day in 1990. The Welsh text, written by W.D. Williams, and its translation read:

===Tartan===
The Kellogg College tartan was designed by Robert Collins for the Burns Supper 2013. It is registered with the Scottish Register of Tartans and may only be worn by fellows, students and alumni of Kellogg College and those invited to do so by the president of the college. The tartan is composed of four colours; red, white and blue of the college crest, and gold representing an ear of wheat.

<text>Backyard [[cricket]], also known as bat ball, street cricket, beach cricket, corridor cricket, garden cricket, gully cricket (on the Indian subcontinent) and box cricket (in instances of shorter grounds), is an informal variant of cricket. It is typically played in various non-traditional venues such as gardens, backyards, streets, parks, carparks, beaches, and any area not specifically designed for the sport.

Backyard cricket has connections to the pastimes of Australian, South African and New Zealand and English children who frequently lived on properties with large backyards, providing the facility to play this informal game of sport often with friends, family and neighbors. In South Asia, backyard cricket is very popular.

== Overview ==

Though loosely based upon the game of cricket, many aspects are improvised: the playing ground, the rules, the teams, and the equipment. Quite often there are no teams at all; the players take turns at batting and there is often no emphasis on actually scoring runs. 

Equipment and field:
*The bat can be anything, as long as it can hit the ball and can be suitably held in the hands. However, usage of a bat is necessary. 
*A ball is the other essential item. 
**Tennis balls are often used as they are less likely to inflict injuries or cause damage than a cricket ball. They are also much cheaper and more readily available than a leather cricket ball and are easier to hit due to their slower air-speed and relative lightness. Tennis balls also bounce more than normal cricket balls, especially at low speeds. 
**Sometimes a tennis ball will be heavily taped on one side to give the ball extra &#x27;swing&#x27;. This is known as a &#x27;swing ball&#x27; or &#x27;tape ball&#x27;—swing balls may be made with: gaffer tape, electrical tape, plumbing tape or any other kind of tape available. A completely taped tennis ball is very popular for street cricket in Pakistan as the electric tape makes the ball heavier and less bouncy as compared to a normal tennis ball but it is still relatively harmless as compared to a real cricket ball. 
*The pitch can be any stretch of ground that is reasonably flat. 
*The wicket may be any convenient object – a chair, a cardboard box, a set of long twigs or sticks, a rubbish bin, tree or a drawing on the wall. Often, the wicket is by no means close to the official size, but it is used anyway. 
**A wicket at the non-striker&#x27;s end is generally a single stump if proper stumps are available and in the absence of larger objects may be just a hat or a shoe. Its main purpose is to mark the bowler&#x27;s crease, but can be instrumental when there are two batters and one may be run out. 

Games with relatively few players typically forgo the teams and innings format of professional cricket, opting instead for a batters-vs-everyone format.

Garden/backyard cricket in South Africa and Australia is considered by many to be the pinnacle event of social and sporting excellence in the summer period. Many games are paired with a barbecue which often has a carnival atmosphere. It is historically very popular on Australia Day.

== Rules ==

As a generally informal contest, the rules are flexible but usually agreed upon by the players prior to playing it. Below are listed some of the most common rules.

Backyard cricket allows for rules to be changed, and the rules being played by will depend on the context and physical environment of the game, and the traditions and experience of the players. However, some rules are relatively common: 
*No ducks – A batter cannot be given out without scoring. Dismissals are ignored until the batter scores at least one run. 
**First/Trial ball rule; Can&#x27;t get out first ball: A stricter alternative to &quot;no ducks&quot; whereby a batter cannot be given out on the first ball they face (known as &quot;trial ball&quot; in the subcontinent). This and the &quot;no golden ducks&quot; rule are commonly applied to those with little cricketing skill.
* Equipment and field
**Wicket material – If stumps are unavailable or unsuitable, any other material object may be used, with garbage bins (especially wheelie bins) being common, and some people also use stickers or paint lines on them to restrict the &quot;stump area&quot; of the object to a more realistic size.
**Pitch – The pitch should be between 11 and 33 yards (10 to 30 meters), with limiting factors such as backyard size often dictating the length.
*Ways of getting out:
**One Hand, One Bounce – If the batter has hit the ball into the ground, but it has only bounced once, they can still be given out caught, but only if the fielder catches the ball with one hand; even if the hand hits the ground, the player is out. Another variation of this rule is a one-handed catch off the roof or fence, or some other specific structure local to the backyard in which the game is played is also out.
***One Hand, One Bounce, One Beer – An alternate to the rule of One Hand, One Bounce, where the fielder must also be in possession of a beverage (traditionally a beer) in order to enact the rule and get the batter out. However, spilling a significant proportion of the beverage may be deemed enough to nullify the catch.
***&#x27;Current&#x27; rule: Fielders can hold the ball in a hand and step on the wicket, rather than hitting the wicket with the ball, to effect a runout.
**No LBW – As many backyard cricket games are without umpires, or self-umpired, or played with juniors, teams may agree to not use the relatively difficult LBW rule. 
***Another alternative is &quot;Auto-LBW&quot;, by which the batter is &quot;always&quot; deemed to be out in almost any possible LBW scenario; it also has the effects of discouraging purely defensive batting, and typically increases the rotation of batters.
*** Three hits on the body can get the batter out in gully cricket, wicket and bete-ombro.
**Six and Out – If the ball is hit over the fence, the batter is out, and is obliged to retrieve the ball. The six runs are awarded to the batter to reflect the great shot that they have hit. This rule is especially popular in small backyards (where the rule may be applied to &quot;any&quot; ball that lands over the fence, not just sixes), and encourages the batter to exercise control and restraint by aiming for fours instead of sixes. In street cricket, the rule applies if the ball goes into the neighbour&#x27;s front garden/yard. Six-and-out is also often extended to include nearby fragile objects such as windows and cars which are declared out-of-bounds; if a ball hits an out-of-bounds object on the full it is deemed six-and-out, even if no damage is evident.
**Automatic Wickie — (also known as Electric Wickie/Keeper) If playing in front of a garage door or similar, the structure takes on the role of wicket keeper. Any balls making contact with the Auto Wickie without bouncing, or &quot;on the full&quot;, is considered out. Catches (i.e. from snicks) also apply.
**Retire at X – All batters must retire (end their turn) once they reach a certain pre-declared number of runs (such as 20, 50 or 100). This prevents anyone &quot;hogging the bat&quot;, and helps ensure everyone gets a chance to bat.
*Lost Ball – If a lost ball cannot be found, and if there is no replacement ball, the match ends effective immediately. If losing the ball was the result of hitting a six-and-out the batter is declared the loser. Other scenarios may result in the match deemed a No Contest, or the highest-scoring batter declared the winner.

*Running to score runs
**Hit and Run — (also known as &quot;Tip and Run&quot;, &quot;tip and go&quot;, &quot;tippy-go&quot;, &quot;tippany&quot; or &quot;tippety&quot;) Like in baseball, if the batter&#x27;s bat makes contact with the ball, they must run.
**No running between wickets – Players may agree that batters don&#x27;t run between the wickets, a rule often applied on hot summer days or if players are injured, aged, or otherwise infirmed. As a result, batters typically cannot be run out, but they can still be stumped if found out of their crease. In order to score, they must hit 4&#x27;s (or 6&#x27;s if allowed).
*Rules for fielders:
**Dogs – Dogs are considered fielders, and they effectively switch teams with each innings to constantly remain on the fielding team. If a dog catches the ball (the one-bounce rule is also often allowed), or if the dog (or any other pet) is hit by the ball on-the-full, the batter is declared out. It is the responsibility of the fielding team to chase dogs when required, but ultimately it is the responsibility of the bowler to clean the ball of any slobber.

*Extra Player – If both teams have an even number of players and there is one extra person, they are considered a joker player (&quot;Kacha limbu.&quot;) The joker is part of both teams. The joker is also known as Bothey. The joker is required to field in both innings, but they are not allowed to bowl. However, they are allowed to bat on both sides of the team. They are allowed to bat in any order. Depending on the agreement of both captains, they can be restricted to bat last. 
*Toss – The coin toss plays an important role in backyard cricket like it does in international play. The captain that wins the toss may choose to bat first, or choose the first player. The cricket bat itself is often used in place of a coin, where the call is in respect to whether the bat tossed in the air lands with its flat side upwards or downwards.

If the game is not played individually, the person who owns the bat and ball may choose to bat first. 
== Beach cricket ==
Play on an actual beach can be achieved either by using the flat strip of hard-packed sand along the surf line as the pitch, or by only &quot;bowling&quot; gentle full tosses to avoid the problem of the ball not bouncing off loose sand. If there are no true stumps available, then a bin, deckchair, boogie board or cool box may be used. Tennis balls are often used in place of cricket balls as they float in the water and don&#x27;t get bogged in the sand as easily.

In beach cricket the creases and the boundary are normally drawn in the sand in a line which extends well past the side of the agreed pitch to prevent them becoming obliterated in the first over. The batters will frequently redraw the line. Sometimes, play is shifted along the beach to a new pitch as the packed sand of the original pitch is turned up, thus reducing the standard of or even completely disabling bowling. The tide plays a big part in the standard of the pitch in beach cricket. During low tide, the pitch tends to be on the semi-wet sand, and is deemed superior than cricket played in high tide (when the pitch is on dryer, looser sand). In particularly long matches, the play will shift up and down the beach depending on the tide.

== History ==

A major element of contemporary street cricket is the use of a tennis ball; in Pakistan, tennis balls began to be covered in tape in the late 20th century and turned into a &quot;tape ball&quot;. Tape ball cricket is played to the greatest extent in Pakistan, where it likely originated.

Several street variants of cricket exist in Latin America, such as bete-ombro and plaquita. In nearby Suriname, there is a game called &quot;bat-en-bal&quot; which is likely derived from cricket; in bat-en-bal, one end of the pitch has a set of stumps.

In March 2024, the first season of the Indian Street Premier League (ISPL) took place, which featured several elements of Indian street cricket such as the use of a tennis ball. The ISPL&#x27;s goal is to prioritize the advancement of poorer cricket players and support the growth of tennis ball cricket.

<doc id="158894" wikidata="Q213512" url="?curid=158894" title="Bill Cosby">
<text>William Henry Cosby Jr. ( ; born July 12, 1937) is an American retired comedian, actor, and media personality. Often cited as a trailblazer for African Americans in the entertainment industry, Cosby was a film, television, and stand-up comedy star, with his longest-running live-action role being that of Cliff Huxtable in the sitcom &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; (1984–1992). He also released several stand-up comedy albums and was a popular spokesperson in advertising for decades. Cosby was well known in the United States for his fatherly image and gained a reputation as &quot;America&#x27;s Dad&quot;. Since 2014, dozens of allegations of sexual assault have been made against him.

Cosby began his career as a stand-up comic at the Hungry I nightclub in San Francisco in 1961, and primarily performed observational comedy in a conversational style. He released numerous standup specials starting with &quot;Bill Cosby Is a Very Funny Fellow...Right!&quot; (1963) and starred in the comedy film &quot;Bill Cosby: Himself&quot; (1983). Cosby still holds the record for winning the most Grammy Awards for Best Comedy Album, with seven wins. His acting career began with a starring role in the NBC secret-agent show &quot;I Spy&quot; (1965–1968), which broke new ground for African Americans when he made history by winning three Primetime Emmy Awards for Best Actor in a Drama Series, becoming the first black actor to do so. 

Cosby made his film debut starring in &quot;Man and Boy&quot; (1971) followed by &quot;Hickey &amp; Boggs&quot; (1972), &quot;Uptown Saturday Night&quot; (1974), &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot; (1975), &quot;A Piece of the Action&quot; (1977), &quot;Leonard Part 6&quot; (1987), and &quot;Ghost Dad&quot; (1990). He produced and starred in a series of television sitcoms such as &quot;The Bill Cosby Show&quot; (1969–1971), &quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot; (1972–1985) and &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; (1984–1992) as well as its the spin-off &quot;A Different World&quot; (1987–1993), &quot;The Cosby Mysteries&quot; (1994–1995), and &quot;Cosby&quot; (1996–2000). He hosted &quot;Kids Say the Darndest Things&quot; (1998–2000). During his prolific career he advertised numerous products including the Jell-O ice pop treats Pudding Pop.

Over 60 women have accused Cosby of rape, drug-facilitated sexual assault, sexual battery, child sexual abuse and sexual harassment. Those allegations gained traction in 2014, after a set which made mention of them by fellow comedian Hannibal Buress went viral. Numerous allegations followed with Cosby maintaining his innocence and repeatedly denying the allegations made against him. Despite receiving numerous awards and honorary degrees, several of them were revoked following the allegations. Reruns of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and other programs featuring Cosby were pulled from syndication. In 2018, Cosby was convicted of aggravated sexual assault against Andrea Constand. He was imprisoned until the conviction was vacated in June 2021 by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania on the basis of Cosby&#x27;s 5th Amendment and 14th Amendment due process rights having been violated. In 2022, Cosby was found civilly liable for having sexually assaulted Judy Huth when she was 16.

== Early life and further education ==
William Henry Cosby Jr. was born on July 12, 1937, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He is one of four sons of Anna Pearl (née Hite), a maid, and William Henry Cosby Sr., who served as a mess steward in the U.S. Navy.
Cosby was the class president as well as captain of both the baseball and track-and-field teams at Mary Channing Wister Public School in Philadelphia. Teachers noted his propensity for joking around instead of studying, and he described himself as the class clown. Cosby attended Philadelphia&#x27;s Central High School, a magnet school and academically rigorous college prep school, where he ran track and played baseball, football, and basketball. He transferred to Germantown High School but failed the tenth grade.

In 1956, Cosby enlisted in the Navy and served as a hospital corpsman at the Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia; at Naval Station Argentia in Newfoundland, Canada; and at the National Naval Medical Center in Maryland. He worked in physical therapy with Navy and Marine Corps personnel who were injured during the Korean War. He served until 1960 and became a petty officer 3rd class.

Cosby earned his high school equivalency diploma through correspondence courses and was awarded a track-and-field scholarship to Temple University in 1961. At Temple, he studied physical education while he ran track and played fullback on the college&#x27;s football team. Cosby began bartending at a Philadelphia club, where he earned bigger tips by making the customers laugh. He then began performing on stage and left his university studies to pursue a career in comedy.

Cosby resumed his formal education in 1971. Temple University granted him his bachelor&#x27;s degree on the basis of what it referred to as life experience. He then began graduate work at UMass Amherst, receiving his Master of Arts (MA) degree in 1972.

He returned to UMass Amherst, and in 1976, while producing &quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot;, he earned his Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) degree. His dissertation was titled &quot;An Integration of the Visual Media Via &#x27;Fat Albert And The Cosby Kids&#x27; into the Elementary School Curriculum as a Teaching Aid and Vehicle to Achieve Increased Learning&quot;.

==Career==

=== Stand-up comedy ===

Cosby lined up stand-up jobs at clubs in Philadelphia and then in New York City, where he appeared at The Gaslight Cafe beginning in 1961. He booked dates in cities such as Chicago, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. In the summer of 1963, he received national exposure on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. This led to a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records which, in 1964, released his debut LP, &quot;Bill Cosby Is a Very Funny Fellow...Right!&quot;, the first of a series of comedy albums. His album &quot;To Russell, My Brother, Whom I Slept With&quot; was number one on &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 40 Greatest Comedy Albums of All Time&quot;, calling it &quot;stand-up comedy&#x27;s masterpiece&quot;.

Cosby&#x27;s comedy genres included observational comedy, satire, surreal humor and deadpan. While many comics of the time were using the growing freedom of that decade to explore controversial and sometimes risqué material, Cosby was making his reputation with humorous recollections of his childhood. Many Americans wondered about the absence of race as a topic in Cosby&#x27;s stories. As Cosby&#x27;s success grew, he had to defend his choice of material regularly; as he argued, &quot;A white person listens to my act and he laughs and he thinks, &#x27;Yeah, that&#x27;s the way I see it too.&#x27; Okay. He&#x27;s white. I&#x27;m Negro. And we both see things the same way. That must mean that &quot;we are alike. Right?&quot; So I figure this way I&#x27;m doing as much for good race relations as the next guy.&quot;

In 1983, Cosby released the live comedy performance film &quot;Bill Cosby: Himself,&quot; in which he gave his views ranging from marriage to parenthood. The film also showcased Cosby&#x27;s conversational style of stand-up comedy; for most of the performance, Cosby was seated center-stage, only getting up to emphasize a joke. Nearly all of Cosby&#x27;s routine in the film concerned the trials and tribulations of parenting, frequently illustrated with anecdotes involving his own family. Many of the comedic routines presented in the film were precursors to Cosby&#x27;s most popular sitcom, &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. The film was well regarded by comedians and critics, with some calling it &quot;the greatest stand up concert movie ever.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed Cosby&#x27;s concert film &quot;Bill Cosby: Himself&quot; as number8 on its list of &quot;The 25 Best Stand-Up Specials of All Time&quot;, acknowledging the significance of the film while still saying: &quot;Yes, it&#x27;s damned near impossible to watch anything the tainted comedian has done and not think of the headlines, the heckling, the revelations and what is, by any definition, monstrous behavior.&quot; They also placed Cosby at number8 on their list of &quot;The Best Stand-up Comics of All Time&quot;, saying: &quot;Bill Cosby is not likely to perform again; listening to his records will never have that gentle, sweet sense of nostalgia for anyone; and while it is impossible to disconnect the performer from the man, scrubbing his name from the annals of stand-up would be impossible.&quot;

Cosby performed his first TV stand-up special in 30 years, &quot;Bill Cosby: Far from Finished&quot;, on Comedy Central on November 23, 2013. His last show of the &quot;Far from Finished&quot; tour was performed at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre in Atlanta, Georgia on May 2, 2015. In 2014, Cosby was set to release his new standup special &quot;Bill Cosby 77&quot; on Netflix. The release of the film was canceled due to allegations of sexual assault against Cosby. His last known standup performance prior to his conviction was held at the LaRose Jazz Club in Philadelphia on January 23, 2018.

=== Television and film ===

In 1965, Cosby was cast alongside Robert Culp in the &quot;I Spy&quot; espionage adventure series on NBC. &quot;I Spy&quot; became the first weekly dramatic television series to feature an African American in a starring role. At first, Cosby and NBC executives were concerned that some affiliates might be unwilling to carry the series. At the beginning of the 1965 season, four stations declined the show; they were in Georgia, Florida, and Alabama. Viewers were taken with the show&#x27;s exotic locales and the authentic chemistry between the stars. It became one of the ratings hits of the season. &quot;I Spy&quot; finished among the twenty most-watched shows that year, and Cosby was honored with three consecutive Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. When accepting his third Emmy for the show, Cosby told the audience: &quot;Let the message be known to bigots and racists that they don&#x27;t count!&quot;

During the series&#x27; run, Cosby continued to do stand-up comedy performances and recorded half a dozen record albums for Warner Bros. Records. He also began to dabble in singing, recording &quot;Silver Throat: Bill Cosby Sings&quot; in 1967. In June 1968, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine reported that Cosby had turned down a five-year, $3.5million contract renewal offer and would leave the label in August that year to record for his own record label.

In July 1968, Cosby narrated &quot;Black History: Lost, Stolen, or Strayed&quot;, a CBS documentary addressing the representation of black people in popular culture. Andy Rooney wrote the Emmy-awarded script for Cosby to read. Georgetown University professor Michael Eric Dyson said it was one of &quot;the rare exceptions when Cosby took off the gloves and blinders, to discuss race in public with candor and discernment&quot;. Due to its popularity and controversial nature, it was rebroadcast less than a month later.

Tetragrammaton Records, a division of the Campbell, Silver, Cosby (CSC) Corporation—the Los Angeles–based production company founded by Cosby, his manager Roy Silver, and filmmaker Bruce Post Campbell—produced films as well as records, including Cosby&#x27;s television specials, the &quot;Fat Albert&quot; cartoon special and series, and several motion pictures. CSC hired Artie Mogull as President of the label. Tetragrammaton was fairly active during 1968–69 but ceased trading during the 1970s.

Throughout the 1960s Cosby pursued a variety of additional television projects and appeared as a regular guest host on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and as the star of an annual special for NBC. In 1969, he returned with another series, &quot;The Bill Cosby Show&quot;, a situation comedy that ran for two seasons. Cosby played a physical education teacher at a Los Angeles high school. While only a modest critical success, the show was hit with ratings, finishing eleventh in its first season. Cosby was lauded for using African American performers such as Lillian Randolph, Moms Mabley, and Rex Ingram as characters. According to commentary on the Season1 DVDs for the show, Cosby was at odds with NBC over his refusal to include a laugh track in the show, as he felt viewers had the ability to find humor for themselves when watching a TV show.

For the PBS series &quot;The Electric Company&quot;, Cosby recorded several segments teaching reading skills to young children. Cosby resumed his formal education in 1971; he began graduate work at UMass Amherst. In 1972, he was back in prime time with a variety series, &quot;The New Bill Cosby Show&quot;. However, this show lasted only a season. More successful was a Saturday-morning cartoon, &quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot;, hosted by Cosby and based on his own childhood. That series ran from 1972 to 1979, then ran as &quot;The New Fat Albert Show&quot; in 1979, and finally ran as &quot;The Adventures of Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot;. Cosby would use his experience producing &quot;Fat Albert&quot; in his educational endeavors; his dissertation for his Ed. D. at UMass Amherst discussed the use of &quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot; as a teaching tool in elementary schools.

During the 1970s, Cosby and other African-American actors, including Sidney Poitier, joined forces to make successful comedy films to counter the violent &quot;blaxploitation&quot; films of the era, such as &quot;Uptown Saturday Night&quot; in 1974; &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot; in 1975; and in 1976, &quot;Mother, Jugs &amp; Speed&quot;, co-starring Raquel Welch and Harvey Keitel.

In 1976, Cosby starred in &quot;A Piece of the Action&quot; with Poitier; and &quot;California Suite&quot;, a compilation of four Neil Simon plays. He also hosted &quot;Cos&quot; in 1976. In addition, he produced an hour-long variety show featuring puppets, sketches, and musical numbers. It was during this season that ABC decided to take advantage of this phase of Cosby&#x27;s career, by joining with Filmation producers of &quot;Fat Albert&quot; to create live-action segments starring Cosby, for the 1972 animated film &quot;Journey Back to Oz&quot;; it subsequently aired in syndication. Cosby was also a regular on children&#x27;s public television programs starting in the 1970s, hosting the &quot;Picture Pages&quot; segments that lasted into the early 1980s.
Cosby&#x27;s greatest television success came in September 1984 with the debut of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. Cosby, an advocate for family-oriented humor, co-produced the series, held creative control and involved himself in every aspect of production. Plots were often based on ideas that Cosby suggested while in meetings with the writing staff. The show had parallels to Cosby&#x27;s actual family life: like the characters Cliff and Clair Huxtable, Cosby and his wife Camille were college-educated and financially successful, and they had five children. On the show, Cosby played the role of an obstetrician. Much of the material from the pilot and first season of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; was taken from his video &quot;Bill Cosby: Himself&quot;, released in 1983. The series was an immediate success, debuting near the top of the ratings and staying there for most of its eight-season run.

In 1987, Cosby attempted to return to film with the spy spoof &quot;Leonard Part 6&quot;. Although Cosby himself was the producer and wrote the story, he realized during production that the film was not going to be what he wanted and publicly denounced it, warning audiences to stay away. The film was however marked the first project for Columbia to be greenlighted by studio executive David Puttman. Later in the 1980s, Cosby served as an advisor to the Los Angeles Student Film Institute.

After &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; went off the air in 1992, Cosby embarked on a number of other projects, which included a revival of the classic Groucho Marx game show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; (1992–93), the TV-movie &quot;I Spy Returns&quot; (1994), and &quot;The Cosby Mysteries&quot; (1994). In the mid-1990s, he appeared as a detective in black-and-white film noir-themed commercials for Turner Classic Movies. During this time, he reunited with Sidney Poitier starring in &quot;Ghost Dad&quot; (1990) and appeared in minor roles in Robert Townsend&#x27;s superhero comedy &quot;The Meteor Man&quot; (1993), and Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s coming of age film &quot;Jack&quot; (1996). In addition, he was interviewed in Spike Lee&#x27;s HBO project &quot;4 Little Girls&quot; (1997), a documentary about the 1963 racist bombing of a church in Birmingham, Alabama which injured 22 people, killing four girls.

Also in 1996, he started up a new show for CBS, &quot;Cosby&quot;, again co-starring Phylicia Rashād, his onscreen wife on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. Cosby co-produced the show for Carsey-Werner Productions. It centered on Cosby as Hilton Lucas, an iconoclastic senior citizen who tries to find a new job after being downsized and, in the meantime, gets on his wife&#x27;s nerves. Madeline Kahn co-starred as Rashād&#x27;s goofy business partner Pauline. Cosby was hired by CBS to be the official spokesman of its Detroit affiliate WWJ-TV during an advertising campaign from 1995 to 1998. Cosby also hosted a CBS special, &quot;Kids Say the Darndest Things&quot;, on February 6, 1995, which was followed after as a full-season show, with Cosby as host, from January 9, 1998, to June 23, 2000. After four seasons, &quot;Cosby&quot; was canceled. Its last episode aired April 28, 2000. &quot;Kids Say the Darndest Things&quot; was terminated the same year.

A series for preschoolers, &quot;Little Bill&quot;, created by Cosby as a semi-biographical representation of his childhood growing up in Philadelphia, made its debut on Nickelodeon in 1999. The network renewed the popular program in November 2000. In 2001, Cosby&#x27;s agenda included the publication of a new book, as well as delivering the commencement addresses at Morris Brown College, Ohio State University, and at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Also that year, he signed a deal with 20th Century Fox to develop a live-action feature film centering on the popular Fat Albert character from his 1970s cartoon series. Co-written and executive produced by Cosby, &quot;Fat Albert&quot; was released in theaters in December 2004. Cosby makes an appearance in the film as himself.

In May 2007, Cosby spoke at the commencement of High Point University. In the summer of 2009, Cosby hosted a comedy gala at Montreal&#x27;s &quot;Just for Laughs&quot;, the largest comedy festival in the world. During this time he also made an appearance in Mario Van Peebles film &quot;Baadasssss!&quot; in 2003.

=== Advertising ===

Cosby was a popular spokesperson for advertising from the 1960sbefore his first starring television roleuntil the early 2000s. He started with White Owl cigars, and later endorsed Jell-O pudding and gelatin, Del Monte, Ford Motor Company, Coca-Cola (including New Coke), American Red Cross, Texas Instruments, E. F. Hutton &amp; Co., Kodak, and the 1990 United States Census. , Cosby held the record for being the longest-serving celebrity spokesperson for a product, through his work with Jell-O. In 2011, he won the President&#x27;s Award for Contributions to Advertising from the Advertising Hall of Fame.

Cosby was one of the first black people to appear in the United States as an advertising spokesperson. He was known for his appeal to white consumers in the second half of the 20th century, in an industry seen as slow to accept diversity. In spite of making contradictory soft drink pitches and endorsing a disgraced financial company, he continued to be considered effective and believable. In the 1980s, studies found Cosby the &quot;most familiar&quot; and &quot;most persuasive&quot; spokesperson, to the point where Cosby attributed his wealth to these contracts primarily, over his television series.

Cosby&#x27;s first advertisement was for White Owl cigars. His agent approached them in 1965, before the debut of &quot;I Spy&quot;, but after several appearances on the late-night talk program &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, a signifier of success in American comedy. He told agent Norman Brokaw of William Morris Agency that he liked their tagline, &quot;We&#x27;re going to get you.&quot; Cosby later said there were no commercials &quot;with a black person holding something, buying a product, so the absence of pictures, in retrospect, said a lot&quot;. Despite the stigma among advertisers around using a black spokesperson, sales of the product rose. According to an entry in &quot;Ad Age Encyclopedia&quot;, the public acceptance of Cosby and Robert Culp appearing as equals on &quot;I Spy&quot; made it possible for advertisers to show black people and white people together in their commercials.

In 1974, Cosby began promoting Jell-O pudding for General Foods. Cosby said comedian Jack Benny, whose program the brand sponsored, was the only previous spokesman for Jell-O, but Kate Smith, Lucille Ball, and Andy Griffith have also pitched the brand. In previous campaigns since the brand&#x27;s launch in 1902, it was targeted towards parents rather than to children, a practice from which the company departed in 2001. Cosby&#x27;s early commercials were created at the Young &amp; Rubicam advertising agency by Curvin O&#x27;Reilly. Cosby&#x27;s Jell-O Pudding commercials were not permitted to be used in child directed television because celebrity endorsements were prohibited in advertising to children. Sales immediately responded to the Cosby advertising with growth after what had been a long decline. In 1979, General Foods introduced Pudding Pops, the company&#x27;s first frozen dessert product. With Cosby as spokesperson, it sold US$100 million its first year. After introducing Gelatin Pops and frozen Fruit Bars, the company&#x27;s frozen desserts sales reached $300 million. Cosby was engaged to promote the flagging Jell-O gelatin product line in the mid-1980s, when General Foods introduced a holdable Jell-O product called &quot;Jigglers&quot;. Sales increased seven percent during the first year of the promotion.

Cosby appeared in commercials for Coca-Cola&#x27;s 1979 campaign, &quot;Have a Coke and a Smile,&quot; and made a guest appearance at the Great Get-Together, a major bottlers&#x27; convention held that year. This campaign continued into 1981. Cosby returned as Coca-Cola&#x27;s spokesperson in its 1982 &quot;Coke Is It&quot; campaign, a series of commercials mocking the Pepsi Challenge. Cosby continued to be a Jell-O spokesman through the 1990s. He was present for the lighting of the brand&#x27;s first billboard in New York&#x27;s Times Square in 1998. In 1999, Cosby&#x27;s 25th year as spokesman for Jell-O, was also the final year he appeared in its advertising. The company distributed 120,000 copies of his picture book series, &quot;Little Bill&quot;, into American public libraries. Despite the transitions of advertising agencies and despite the 1989 merger of General Foods into Kraft, the then-newly merged company Kraft General Foods let Cosby remain with Jell-O as their spokesperson. He appeared at the Utah State Senate in 2001 to designate Jell-O the official state snack, and made a promotional visit to the Jell-O Gallery in 2004. In 2010, Cosby returned to Jell-O as executive producer for the company&#x27;s &quot;Hello Jell-O&quot; campaign. In return, the brand sponsored his weekly web show &quot;OBKB&quot;, a children&#x27;s interview series similar to &quot;Kids Say the Darndest Things&quot;. As of 2002, Cosby&#x27;s time with Jell-O was considered the longest-standing celebrity endorsement in American advertising history.

Cosby has not appeared in advertising roles since the widespread publicization of his sexual assault allegations in 2014.

== Sexual assault cases ==
=== 1965–1996 allegations ===
The earliest allegation against Cosby dates back to December 1965: in 2005, Kristina Ruehli came forward as Jane Doe #12 in the Andrea Constand case and alleged that Cosby had drugged and assaulted her at that time in his Beverly Hills home. Further, Ruehli said she had told her boyfriend about the incident, and had told her daughter in the 1980s.

In the early 1980s, Joan Tarshis told freelance reporter John Milward about an alleged sexual assault by Cosby. Milward did not write about the allegations. In 1996, &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate Victoria Valentino gave a videotaped interview in which she made sexual assault allegations against Cosby. The interview was conducted for an exposé on the lives of &quot;Playboy&quot; models, which was never published.

After the allegations resurfaced in 2014, Wendy Williams recalled that during her radio show in 1990, she referred to sexual assault allegations against Cosby that had been published in the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; tabloid. Williams said Cosby called her boss in the middle of the broadcast demanding that Williams be fired.

=== Later allegations and investigations (2000–2006) ===
On February 1, 2000, according to a statement provided by Detective Jose McCallion of the New York County District Attorney&#x27;s Special Victims Bureau, Lachele Covington, who was 20 years old at the time, filed a criminal complaint against Cosby alleging that on January 28, 2000, at his Manhattan townhouse, he had tried to put her hands down his pants and then exposed himself. Covington also alleged that Cosby grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hands down her pants. Cosby was questioned and insisted &quot;it was not true&quot;. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) referred her complaint to the D.A., but they declined to prosecute.

In January 2004, Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee, accused Cosby of drugging and fondling her; however, in February 2005, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania&#x27;s District Attorney said there would be no charges due to insufficient credible and admissible evidence. Constand then filed a civil claim in March 2005, with thirteen women as potential witnesses if the case went to court. Cosby settled out of court for an undisclosed amount in November 2006. After learning that charges were not pursued in the Constand case, California lawyer Tamara Lucier Green, the only publicly named woman in the prior case, came forward with allegations in February 2005 that Cosby had drugged and assaulted her in the 1970s. Cosby&#x27;s lawyer said Cosby did not know her and that the events did not happen.

In a July 2005 &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; interview, Beth Ferrier, one of the anonymous &quot;Jane Doe&quot; witnesses in the Constand case, alleged that in 1984 Cosby had drugged her coffee and she awoke with her clothes partially removed. In 2005, Shawn Upshaw Brown, a woman with whom Cosby admitted to having an extramarital affair in the 1970s, claimed in the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; that Cosby drugged and raped her the last time the two were together sexually. Brown is the mother of Autumn Jackson, who claims to be Cosby&#x27;s illegitimate daughter. Jackson was convicted in 1997 of extortion after she threatened to make the claims public in the &quot;Globe&quot; tabloid. In 2015, Brown went into more detail with her renewed allegations in an interview.

On June 9, 2006, &quot;Philadelphia&quot; magazine published an article by Robert Huber which gave graphic detail about Constand&#x27;s allegations, and the similar stories told by Green and Ferrer about how they stated that they too were drugged and sexually assaulted. With these severe allegations against Cosby, Huber wrote: &quot;His lawyers have gotten it pushed to the back burner, down to a simmer, and maybe it will amount to nothing, yet there is also the possibility that it will bubble up to destroy him.&quot; The article was titled &quot;Dr. Huxtable &amp; Mr. Hyde&quot;, in allusion to both Cosby&#x27;s character Cliff Huxtable on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and to a person having two starkly distinct &quot;Jekyll and Hyde&quot; personalities. This article also presented Barbara Bowman, who had come forward after having read about Constand&#x27;s story, saying she could not sit in silence any longer. Details of Bowman&#x27;s similar drug and sexual assault allegations were published in the magazine&#x27;s November 1, 2006, issue. Bowman reported two incidents that happened around early 1986, wherein she was eighteen years old and working as an aspiring model and actress after her agent had introduced her to Cosby and he had become her good friend and mentor, saying that she escaped his attacks, returned home to Denver and Cosby thereafter subverted her career.

=== Hannibal Buress remarks (October 2014) ===

On October 16, 2014, as part of a comedy routine in Philadelphia, Hannibal Buress addressed Cosby&#x27;s legacy of &quot;talk[ing] down&quot; to young black men about their mode of dress and lifestyle. Buress criticized the actor&#x27;s public moralizing by saying: &quot;Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby, so that kind of brings you down a couple notches.&quot;

The audience appeared to respond to Buress&#x27;s accusation as an incredulous joke, then he encouraged everyone to search &quot;Bill Cosby rape&quot; on Google when they got home. Buress had been using the same Cosby routine for the previous six months with little response, but word of the October performance spread rapidly after being posted on &quot;Philadelphia&quot; magazine&#x27;s website. Media coverage intensified, with numerous publications tackling the question of how Cosby had managed to maintain, as Buress called it in his routine, a &quot;teflon image&quot; despite more than a decade of public sexual abuse accusations.

Shortly afterward, &quot;USA Today&quot; reported that either Cosby or his representative posted a request for Twitter followers to &quot;Go ahead. Meme me!&quot; The tweet was deleted after a large number of the submitted memes made reference to the accusations against Cosby.

=== Additional assault allegations ===
After Buress&#x27;s remarks came to the attention of journalist Joan Tarshis, in November 2014, model Janice Dickinson, actress Louisa Moritz, actor Lou Ferrigno&#x27;s wife Carla, Florida nurse Therese Serignese, &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmates Valentino and Sarita Butterfield, actress Michelle Hurd, and eleven other women also made accusations of alleged assaults by Cosby committed against them between 1965 and 2004. Charlotte Laws wrote a November 2014 article published by &quot;Salon&quot; accusing Cosby of assaulting a friend of hers, with whom she subsequently had lost contact. The following month, in a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article, model Beverly Johnson alleged that she was drugged by Cosby during a 1986 audition, and that she knew other women with similar accounts.

Cosby&#x27;s attorney said Dickinson&#x27;s account differed from prior accounts she had given of the incident and released a statement that said in part: &quot;Mr. Cosby does not intend to dignify these allegations with any comment.&quot; A follow-up statement dismissed the allegations as &quot;unsubstantiated&quot; and an example of &quot;media vilification&quot;. A joint statement from Cosby and Constand, who had received a civil settlement in 2006, clarified the statement released a few days prior by stating that it did not refer to Constand&#x27;s case, which was resolved years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;billcosby.com/2014/11/1744&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Cindra Ladd alleged that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in 1969. In May 2015, Lili Bernard claimed that Cosby sexually assaulted her in the early 1990s, and that she had been interviewed by police in Atlantic City, New Jersey, regarding the allegation. Because the state of New Jersey has no statute of limitations for rape, Bernard hoped charges would be brought, but media reports noted that &quot;it wasn&#x27;t clear...if what [Bernard] says happened to her happened in New Jersey.&quot;

On July 27, 2015, &quot;New York&quot; magazine&#x27;s cover featured images of 35 women sitting in chairs with the last chair empty, suggesting there may be more victims who have not come forward yet. The 35 women told &quot;their stories about being assaulted by Bill Cosby, and the culture that wouldn&#x27;t listen&quot;. Eleven other women known to &quot;New York&quot; who alleged sexual assault by Cosby declined to be photographed and interviewed for the feature. According to &quot;Vox&quot;, the stories span &quot;more than five decades&quot; and are &quot;remarkably similar, typically involving the comedian offering a woman a cup of coffee or some sort of alcoholic beverage—which may be spiked with drugs—and allegedly sexually assaulting the victim as she&#x27;s impaired or unconscious.&quot;

On September 17, 2015, A&amp;E broadcast the documentary &quot;Cosby: The Women Speak&quot;, a program in which thirteen alleged victims were interviewed. By October 24, nearly sixty women had claimed they were sexually abused by Cosby, and the terms &quot;sociopath&quot; and &quot;serial rapist&quot; were used to describe him. Jewell Allison, one of Cosby&#x27;s accusers, described him as a &quot;sociopath&quot; and stated: &quot;We may be looking at America&#x27;s greatest serial rapist that ever got away with this for the longest amount of time. He got away with it because he was hiding behind the image of Cliff Huxtable.&quot;

=== Aftermath ===
Cosby has repeatedly denied the allegations and maintained his innocence. In November 2014, he responded to a question about the allegations and said: &quot;I don&#x27;t talk about it.&quot; In past interviews that were made public, Cosby declined to discuss the accusations. However, he told &quot;Florida Today&quot;: &quot;People shouldn&#x27;t have to go through that and shouldn&#x27;t answer to innuendos.&quot; In May 2015, he said: &quot;I have been in this business 52 years and I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this. Reality is a situation and I can&#x27;t speak.&quot;

In the wake of the allegations, numerous organizations have severed ties with Cosby, and honors and titles that were previously awarded to him have been revoked. Reruns of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and other shows featuring Cosby have also been pulled from syndication by many organizations. Twenty-five colleges and universities have rescinded honorary degrees.

In July 2015, PAVE: Promoting Awareness and Victim Empowerment, a nonprofit group focusing on sexual assault prevention, launched a WhiteHouse.gov petition, calling upon President Barack Obama to revoke Cosby&#x27;s Presidential Medal of Freedom (which Cosby received from President George W. Bush in July 2002). Later the same month, in response to a question at a news conference, President Obama said:

==== Trial, conviction, and conviction overturn ====
With the exception of Andrea Constand&#x27;s allegations, most of the sexual assault allegations against Cosby have fallen outside of the statutes of limitations for criminal prosecution. Numerous civil lawsuits have been brought against him. Attorney Gloria Allred has represented 33 of Cosby&#x27;s alleged victims. In July 2015, some of the court records from Andrea Constand&#x27;s 2005 civil suit against Cosby were unsealed and released to the public. The full transcript of his deposition was also released to the media by a court reporting service. In his testimony, Cosby admitted to casual sex with a series of young women involving the recreational use of the sedative methaqualone (Quaalude); he further acknowledged that his dispensation of the prescription drug was illegal.

On April 26, 2018, following a jury trial, Cosby was found guilty of three counts of aggravated indecent assault against Andrea Constand. An initial trial on the charges had ended in a mistrial when the jurors could not reach a unanimous verdict. On September 25, 2018, he was sentenced to three to ten years in state prison and a $25,000 fine, together with court costs of both trials. After a brief period in the Montgomery County Correctional Facility, Cosby was moved to a state prison, SCI Phoenix in Skippack Township, Pennsylvania, on September 25, 2018, where he was confined to a single cell. On January 28, 2019, Cosby was moved from administrative segregation into the general population. On December 10, 2019, the verdict was upheld by the Pennsylvania Superior Court on the initial level of appeal.

On June 23, 2020, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed to hear a further level of appeal of Cosby&#x27;s sexual assault conviction based on questions about testimony from a witness being &quot;more prejudicial than probative&quot;. The court would hear his appeal on arguments of whether it was proper for the judge to allow five prosecution witnesses to testify in the case about prior, unrelated instances of sexual assault, and to permit the jury to learn of a deposition in which Cosby admitted to giving Quaaludes to other women in the past to facilitate sexual encounters. The court also agreed to review whether Cosby&#x27;s rights were violated by being prosecuted in the Constand matter, after a former prosecutor had informed Cosby that he would not be prosecuted for the assault, resulting in Cosby&#x27;s agreeing to testify without claiming his self-incrimination privilege in his accuser&#x27;s civil lawsuit.

On June 30, 2021, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned Cosby&#x27;s conviction, citing violations of his due process rights. According to Justice David Wecht, &quot;Even though society has a strong interest in prosecuting crimes, it has an even stronger interest in ensuring that the constitutional rights of the people are vindicated.&quot; The following situation was cited: previously in February 2005, District Attorney Bruce Castor declared in a press release that due to insufficient evidence rendering a conviction &quot;unattainable&quot;, he &quot;declines to authorize the filing of criminal charges&quot; against Cosby regarding allegations Andrea Constand made against him. Castor said he did so to compel Cosby to testify in a civil lawsuit, brought by Constand, without the right to not incriminate himself as accorded by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, so that Constand could win damages from Cosby. Cosby testified that he had given Constand Benadryl, and that he had separately provided Quaaludes to women he wanted to have sex with. Cosby settled the civil lawsuit by paying $3.38 million. Six of the seven Pennsylvania Supreme Court justices interpreted Castor&#x27;s 2005 press release as a promise not to prosecute Cosby, which led Cosby to provide testimony in his civil lawsuit that was later used as key evidence in his criminal trial; thus, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court concluded that Cosby&#x27;s due process rights were violated. The court further barred prosecution of Cosby &quot;on these particular charges&quot;.

Cosby was released from prison on the same day that his conviction was overturned. He had served nearly three years before Pennsylvania&#x27;s Supreme Court overturned his conviction. In November 2021, the District Attorney filed papers with the Supreme Court of the United States seeking to have the Court consider whether to overturn the decision of the state supreme court. Cosby&#x27;s attorney filed a response in late January 2022, urging the Supreme Court to decline review. On March 7, 2022, the court declined to review the decision of the Pennsylvania court.

Cosby&#x27;s legal issues continued following his release from prison. In 2014, Judy Huth had filed a civil suit against Cosby in California, alleging that he had sexually assaulted her in 1975, when she was 16 years old. The trial began in 2022, and the jury ruled in Huth&#x27;s favor. Cosby was ordered to pay $500,000 in compensatory damages.

== Legacy ==

=== Influence on other comedians ===
Before the 2014 allegations, younger, well-established comics like Jerry Seinfeld had credited Cosby as an innovator both as a practitioner of stand-up comedy, as well as a person who paved the way for comics to break into sitcom television.

Seinfeld said of Cosby: &quot;He opened a door for all of us, for all of the networks to even consider that this was a way to create a character, was to take someone who can hold an audience just by being up there and telling their story. He created that. He created the whole idea of taking a quote-unquote &#x27;comic&#x27; and developing a TV show just from a persona that you see on stage.&quot;

Comedian Larry Wilmore also saw a connection between &quot;Bill Cosby: Himself&quot; and the later success of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s clear that the concert is the template for &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;.&quot;

=== Impact of sexual assault allegations on Cosby&#x27;s legacy ===
Joan Tarshis, who had accused Cosby of raping her, within a &quot;Salon.com&quot; article, compared Cosby&#x27;s damaged legacy to that of O. J. Simpson, saying: &quot;When you hear O. J. Simpson&#x27;s name, you don&#x27;t think &#x27;Oh, great football player&#x27;. That doesn&#x27;t come to mind first. I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s not going to be &#x27;Oh, great comedian&#x27;. It&#x27;s going to be &#x27;Oh, serial rapist&#x27;.&quot;

In 2015, &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine released an issue with the allegations against Cosby as the cover story, discussing the importance of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and if it is possible to separate Bill Cosby from Cliff Huxtable. The cover depicted a photograph of the Huxtables with a cracked frame, symbolizing the show&#x27;s damaged and complicated legacy.

In late 2018, the Christmas song &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; was pulled from several radio stations amid controversy that its lyrics allegedly promote sexual predation. Susan Loesser, daughter of composer Frank Loesser, blamed Bill Cosby for backlash against its lyric &quot;say, what&#x27;s in this drink?&quot;. Loesser said, &quot;Bill Cosby is ruining it for everybody...Ever since Cosby was accused of drugging women, I hear the date rape thing all the time...I think it would be good if people looked at the song in the context of the time. It was written in 1944. It was a different time.&quot;

The 2022 premiere of the 21st season of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; touched on the Cosby cases, with the plot being centered around the murder of an entertainer (in this case a singer) released from prison after his conviction was overturned in a manner resembling Cosby&#x27;s. Like Cosby, he had been accused of many counts of rape yet maintained his innocence but was shot and killed by a victim looking for revenge.

In 2022, W. Kamau Bell released the Showtime documentary &quot;We Need to Talk About Cosby&quot;, which explores Cosby&#x27;s life and career up to his sexual assault cases, through conversations with comedians, journalists, and survivors. A representative for Cosby issued a statement days prior to the series&#x27;s premiere, stating: &quot;Mr. Cosby has spent more than 50 years standing with the excluded; made it possible for some to be included; standing with the disenfranchised; and standing with those women and men who were denied respectful work because of race and gender within the expanses of the entertainment industries, continues to be the target of numerous media that have, for too many years, distorted and omitted truths... intentionally. Mr. Cosby vehemently denies all allegations waged against him. Let&#x27;s talk about Bill Cosby. He wants our nation to be what it proclaims itself to be: a democracy.&quot;

==Personal life==

Cosby married Camille Hanks on January 25, 1964. Together, they had five children, Erika (b. 1965), Erinn (b. 1966), Ennis (1969–1997), Ensa (1973–2018), and Evin (b. 1976). Their only son, Ennis, was murdered on January 16, 1997, while changing a flat tire on the side of Interstate 405 in Los Angeles. Cosby&#x27;s daughter Ensa died of renal disease on February 23, 2018, while awaiting a kidney transplant. The Cosbys have three grandchildren. Cosby, a Protestant, maintains homes in Shelburne, Massachusetts, and Cheltenham, Pennsylvania.

Cosby hosted the Los Angeles Playboy Jazz Festival from 1979 to 2012. Known as a jazz drummer, he can also be seen playing bass guitar with Jerry Lewis and Sammy Davis Jr. on Hugh Hefner&#x27;s 1970s talk show. His story, &quot;The Regular Way&quot;, was featured in &quot;Playboy&quot;″s December 1968 issue. Cosby has become an active member of The Jazz Foundation of America. Cosby became involved with the foundation in 2004. For several years, he has been a featured host for its annual benefit, A Great Night in Harlem, at the Apollo Theater in New York City.

Cosby and his wife have collected more than three hundred works of African-American art since 1967. The works went on display in &quot;Conversations&quot;, an exhibit at the National Museum of African Art in 2014. The show was controversial because of the sexual assault allegations made against Cosby.

Cosby is a supporter of his alma mater, Temple University, particularly its men&#x27;s basketball team, the Temple Owls, whose games Cosby frequently attended prior to his arrest. He is also a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity; he was initiated in the fraternity&#x27;s Beta Alpha Alpha graduate chapter in White Plains, New York, in 1988, and served briefly on the board of directors for the CDC Foundation.

In 2016, Cosby&#x27;s attorneys reported that he is now legally blind. In April 2017, Cosby agreed to be interviewed by the National Newspaper Publishers Association, because, as Andrew Wyatt, his spokesman, stated, &quot;they grew comfortable that the NNPA Newswire would be more interested in &#x27;facts over sensationalism&#x27;.&quot; In the interview, both Cosby and one of his former publicists confirmed the loss of eyesight, noting that it occurred at some point in 2015.

Following his release from prison in 2021, Cosby was reported to be attempting to make a post-prison comeback. Plans for the comeback included a comedy tour that would go from the United States to Canada to London, with Cosby&#x27;s team having contacted a number of promoters and comedy clubs about performance opportunities. It was also reported that Cosby was working on a five-part docuseries that covers his legacy and his experience in prison, and that he was planning on releasing a book. Later in September, it was reported that Cosby put his plans for a comeback on hold due to ongoing legal problems.

=== Politics and views ===
Cosby received an award at the celebration of the 50th-anniversary commemoration of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; ruling—a ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court that outlawed racial segregation in public schools. Later, in May 2004, he made public remarks critical of African Americans who put higher priorities on sports, fashion, and &quot;acting hard&quot; than on education, self-respect, and self-improvement. He pleaded for African American families to educate their children on the many different aspects of American culture. In the Pound Cake speech, Cosby asked that African American parents teach their children better morals at a younger age. As reported in &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, Cosby &quot;told reporters during a special session of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation&#x27;s 34th annual legislative conference [that] parenting needs to come to the forefront. If you need help and you don&#x27;t know how to parent, we want to be able to reach out and touch you.&quot; Richard Leiby of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported, &quot;Bill Cosby was anything but politically correct in his remarks Monday night at a Constitution Hall bash commemorating the 50th anniversary of the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision.&quot;

Cosby was again criticized, and was largely unapologetic, for his stance when he made similar remarks during a speech at a July1 meeting of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition that commemorated the anniversary of &quot;Brown v. Board&quot;, where he said: &quot;...you&#x27;ve got to stop beating up your women because you can&#x27;t find a job, because you didn&#x27;t want to get an education and now you&#x27;re [earning] minimum wage.&quot; During that speech, he admonished blacks for not assisting or concerning themselves with the individuals who are involved with crime or have counterproductive aspirations. He further described those who needed attention as blacks who &quot;had forgotten the sacrifices of those in the Civil Rights Movement&quot;.

In 2005, Georgetown University sociology professor Michael Eric Dyson wrote a book, &quot;Is Bill Cosby Right? Or Has the Black Middle Class Lost Its Mind?&quot; In the book, Dyson wrote that Cosby was overlooking larger social factors that reinforce poverty and associated crime; factors such as deteriorating schools, stagnating wages, dramatic shifts in the economy, offshoring and downsizing, chronic underemployment, and job and capital flight. Dyson suggested that Cosby&#x27;s comments &quot;betray classist, elitist viewpoints rooted in generational warfare&quot;. However, Cornel West defended Cosby and his remarks, saying: &quot;He&#x27;s speaking out of great compassion and trying to get folk to get on the right track, &#x27;cause we&#x27;ve got some brothers and sisters who are not doing the right things, just like in times in our own lives, we don&#x27;t do the right thing... He is trying to speak honestly and freely and lovingly, and I think that&#x27;s a very positive thing.&quot;

In a 2008 interview, Cosby mentioned Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Oakland, California, and Springfield, Massachusetts among the cities where crime was high and young African American men were being murdered and jailed in disproportionate numbers. Cosby stood his ground against criticism and affirmed that African American parents were continuing to fail to inculcate proper standards of moral behavior. The Obama presidency had the potential to affect television shows, but people had differing reactions to that. After Barack Obama was elected president, Cosby said he was &quot;not all that optimistic that Obama&#x27;s presidency will make a major difference in terms of onscreen diversity&quot;, saying &quot;they would die before putting another show on about a black family and black pride.&quot;

Cosby has also been critical of conservative Republican politicians in regard to their views on socioeconomic and racial issues. In a 2013, CNN interview regarding voting rights, Cosby stated &quot;this Republican Party is not the Republican Party of 1863, of Abraham Lincoln, abolitionists and slavery, is not good. I think it&#x27;s important for us to look at the underlying part of it. What is the value of it? Is it that some people are angry because my people no longer want to work for free?&quot; Cosby&#x27;s social commentary led to the unsealing of documents in a previous civil suit by a woman who had accused Cosby of sexual assault, which in turn sparked renewed interest in older allegations. The judge ruled that releasing the sealed documents was justified by the &quot;stark contrast between Bill Cosby, the public moralist and Bill Cosby, the subject of serious allegations concerning improper (and perhaps criminal) conduct&quot;.

==Awards and honors==

Cosby received various awards and numerous honorary degrees for his work as a standup comedian and actor in both television and film including five Primetime Emmy Awards, eight Grammy Awards, two Daytime Emmy Awards, and two Golden Globe Awards. He also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from George W. Bush in 2002, and the Bob Hope Humanitarian Award in 2003. He also received a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1977.

Due to the sexual assault allegations against Cosby, numerous awards and honors were rescinded, including the Kennedy Center Honor that he received in 1998 and was rescinded in 2018, as well as the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, which he received in 2009 and was rescinded in 2018. On May 3, 2018, Cosby was expelled as a member of the Actors Branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, along with Roman Polanski and Harvey Weinstein, due to their breach of the academy&#x27;s standards of conduct.

==Works==
===Filmography===
Cosby had a starring role in the television secret-agent show &quot;I Spy&quot; (1965–1968) opposite Robert Culp, and made history when Cosby won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1966, making him the first African American to earn an Emmy Award for acting. Cosby&#x27;s acting career continued as he starred in the sitcom &quot;The Bill Cosby Show&quot;, which ran for two seasons from 1969 to 1971.

In 1972, using the Fat Albert character developed during his stand-up routines, Cosby created, produced, and hosted the animated comedy television series &quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot; which ran until 1985, centering on a group of young friends growing up in an urban area. Throughout the 1970s Cosby starred in various films including Sidney Poitier&#x27;s &quot;Uptown Saturday Night&quot; (1974), and &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot; (1975), and Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;California Suite&quot; (1978) alongside Richard Pryor. He also starred in the original cast of &quot;The Electric Company&quot; alongside Rita Moreno and Morgan Freeman from 1971 to 1973.

Beginning in the 1980s, Cosby produced and starred in &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, which was rated as the number-one show in America from 1985 through 1989. The sitcom highlighted the experiences and growth of an affluent African American family, and Cosby gained a reputation as &quot;America&#x27;s Dad&quot; for his portrayal of Cliff Huxtable on the sitcom. Cosby produced the spin-off sitcom &quot;A Different World&quot;, which aired from 1987 to 1993. His 1983 comedy film &quot;Bill Cosby: Himself&quot; was well regarded by comedians and critics, with some calling it the greatest stand-up concert movie ever. Cosby also starred in &quot;The Cosby Mysteries&quot; (1994–1995), the sitcom &quot;Cosby&quot; (1996–2000) and hosted &quot;Kids Say the Darndest Things&quot; (1998–2000). He then created and produced the animated children&#x27;s program &quot;Little Bill&quot; (1999–2004).

===Discography===

Cosby released a number of albums, including live recordings of his stand-up comedy as well as studio albums of both vocal and instrumental music. He charted a number of times on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, including the 1967 single &quot;Little Ole Man (Uptight, Everything&#x27;s Alright)&quot; from his album &quot;Silver Throat: Bill Cosby Sings&quot;.

<text>PLOS (for Public Library of Science; PLoS until 2012 ) is a nonprofit publisher of open-access journals in science, technology, and medicine and other scientific literature, under an open-content license. It was founded in 2000 and launched its first journal, &quot;PLOS Biology&quot;, in October 2003. 

As of 2024, PLOS publishes 14 academic journals, including 7 journals indexed within the Science Citation Index Expanded, and consequently 7 journals ranked with an impact factor.

PLOS journals are included in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). PLOS is also a member of the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA), a participating publisher and supporter of the Initiative for Open Citations, and a member of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE).

== History ==


The Public Library of Science began in 2000 with an online petition initiative by Nobel Prize winner Harold Varmus, formerly director of the National Institutes of Health and at that time director of Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center; Patrick O. Brown, a biochemist at Stanford University; and Michael Eisen, a computational biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The petition called for all scientists to pledge that, from September 2001, they would discontinue submission of articles to journals that did not make the full text of their articles available to all, free and unfettered, either immediately or after a delay of no more than six months. Although tens of thousands signed the petition, most did not act upon its terms; and in August 2001, Brown and Eisen announced that they would start their own nonprofit publishing operation. In December 2002, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation awarded PLOS a $9 million grant, which it followed in May 2006 with a $1 million grant to help PLOS achieve financial sustainability and launch new free-access biomedical journals.

The PLOS organizers turned their attention to starting their own journal along the lines of the UK-based BioMed Central, which has been publishing open-access scientific articles in the biological sciences in journals such as &quot;Genome Biology&quot; since 2000. The PLOS journals are what is described as &quot;open-access content&quot;; all content is published under the Creative Commons &quot;attribution&quot; license. The project states (quoting the Budapest Open Access Initiative) that: &quot;The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.&quot;

As a publishing company, the Public Library of Science officially launched its operation on 13 October 2003, with the publication of a print and online scientific journal entitled &quot;PLOS Biology&quot;, and has since launched 11 more journals. 
One, &quot;PLOS Clinical Trials&quot;, has since been merged into &quot;PLOS ONE&quot;. Following the merger, the company started the PLOS Hub for Clinical Trials to collect journal articles published in any PLOS journal that related to clinical trials; the hub was discontinued in July 2013. 

PLOS became a signatory of the SDG Publishers Compact in 2023, and has taken steps to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These include the introduction of five new open-access journals in 2021 to publish research relevant to the SDGs: &quot;PLOS Climate&quot;, &quot;PLOS Water&quot;, &quot;PLOS Sustainability and Transformation&quot;, &quot;PLOS Digital Health&quot;, and &quot;PLOS Global Public Health&quot;.

In 2011, the Public Library of Science became an official financial supporting organization of Healthcare Information For All by 2015, a global initiative that advocates unrestricted access to medical knowledge, sponsoring the first HIFA2015 Webinar in 2012.

In 2012, the organization quit using the stylization &quot;PLoS&quot; to identify itself and began using only &quot;PLOS&quot;.

In 2016, PLOS confirmed that its chief executive officer, Elizabeth Marincola, would be leaving for personal and professional reasons at the end of that year. In May 2017, PLOS announced that their new CEO would be Alison Mudditt with effect from June.

In 2021, PLOS announced a policy that required changes in reporting for researchers working in other countries as an attempt to address neo-colonial parachute research practices.

== Financial model ==
To fund the journals, PLOS charges an article processing charge (APC) to be paid by the author or the author&#x27;s employer or funder. In the United States, institutions such as the National Institutes of Health and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute have pledged that recipients of their grants will be allocated funds to cover such author charges. The Global Participation Initiative (GPI) was instituted in 2012, by which authors in &quot;group-one countries&quot; are not charged a fee and those in &quot;group-two countries&quot; are given a fee reduction. (In all cases, decisions to publish are based solely on editorial criteria.)

PLOS was launched with grants totaling US$13 million from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Sandler Family Supporting Foundation. PLOS confirmed in July 2011 that it no longer relies on subsidies from foundations and is covering all of its operational costs. Since then, the PLOS balance sheet has improved from $20,511,000 net assets in 2012–2013 to $36,591,000 in 2014–2015.

==Publications==
== Other partners ==

In April 2017, PLOS was one of the founding partners in the Initiative for Open Citations.

== Headquarters ==
PLOS has its main headquarters in Suite 225 in the Koshland East Building in Levi&#x27;s Plaza in San Francisco. Previously, the company had been located at 185 Berry Street. In June 2010, PLOS announced that it was moving to a new location in order to accommodate its rapid growth. The move to the Koshland East Building went into effect on 21 June 2010.

<text>The  (; &#x27;Nicholas Quarter&#x27;) is an old quarter of the German capital of Berlin, founded . Together with nearby Cölln, they jointly make up Alt-Berlin, the reconstructed historical heart of the city. Located in the Mitte locality (in the homonymous district), it is five minutes away from Alexanderplatz and Berlin Palace.

==Geography==
Situated on the eastern shore of the river Spree, it is bounded by the streets &quot;Rathausstraße&quot;, &quot;Spandauer Straße&quot; and &quot;Mühlendamm&quot;. The neighborhood itself is named for the eponymous deconsecrated (&#x27;St. Nicholas Church&#x27;) at its heart. This is Berlin&#x27;s oldest church and was dedicated to Saint Nicholas.

==History==
The two settlements of Old Berlin as well as Cölln on the other side of the Spree originated along an old trade route, the (&#x27;Mills Dam&#x27;), a ford where the river could be easily crossed. The , originally a late Romanesque basilica, was erected about 1230. The area around the church with its medieval alleys in the main had been preserved throughout the centuries, until it was destroyed by air raids and the Battle of Berlin during World War II.

At Berlin&#x27;s 750th anniversary in 1987 the house-building was restored in a peculiar mixture of reconstructed historic houses and concrete slab &quot;Plattenbau&quot; blocks, giving the area an unmistakable appearance. Today the small area is famous for its traditional German restaurants and bars.

==Places of interest==

Beside Saint Nicholas&#x27; Church, the best-known building of the quarter is the &quot;Ephraim-Palais&quot;, built in 1766 for Veitel-Heine Ephraim, the financier of King Frederick II of Prussia. The Rococo façade at the intersection of &quot;Mühlendamm&quot; and &quot;Poststraße&quot; became famous as Berlin&#x27;s &quot;finest corner&quot;, until the house was demolished in 1936 for the laying out of the enlarged &quot;Mühlendamm&quot; street. Parts of the façade were stored in the western outskirts of Berlin, West Berlin authorities delivered them to East Berlin&#x27;s magistrate in 1982 to support the reconstruction. The palace was rebuilt between 1983 and 1987, about away from its original site. Today, it serves as a museum.

On the other side of the &quot;Poststraße&quot; is the &quot;Knoblauchhaus&quot; from 1760, with a neoclassical façade from the 19th century. One of the few preserved historic original buildings, it was the residence of the notable Knoblauch family with members like the architect Eduard Knoblauch or the physicist Karl-Hermann Knoblauch. It is home of a Biedermeier museum, the oldest civic museum of Berlin.

On the banks of the Spree stands the red sandstone (&#x27;House of the Prince-elector&#x27;), erected in 1897 at the site of an older building, where John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg died on December 23, 1619. As he believed a White Lady haunted the (&#x27;City Palace&#x27;), he had fled to the home of his valet before dying there.

<doc id="158901" wikidata="Q593248" url="?curid=158901" title="Chlorite">
<text>The chlorite ion, or chlorine dioxide anion, is the halite with the chemical formula of . A chlorite (compound) is a compound that contains this group, with chlorine in the oxidation state of +3. Chlorites are also known as salts of chlorous acid.

==Compounds==

The free acid, chlorous acid HClO2, is the least stable oxoacid of chlorine and has only been observed as an aqueous solution at low concentrations. Since it cannot be concentrated, it is not a commercial product. The alkali metal and alkaline earth metal compounds are all colorless or pale yellow, with sodium chlorite (NaClO2) being the only commercially important chlorite. Heavy metal chlorites (Ag+, Hg+, Tl+, Pb2+, and also Cu2+ and ) are unstable and decompose explosively with heat or shock.

Sodium chlorite is derived indirectly from sodium chlorate, NaClO3. First, the explosively unstable gas chlorine dioxide, ClO2 is produced by reducing sodium chlorate with a suitable reducing agent such as methanol, hydrogen peroxide, hydrochloric acid or sulfur dioxide.

==Structure and properties==
The chlorite ion adopts a bent molecular geometry, due to the effects of the lone pairs on the chlorine atom, with an O–Cl–O bond angle of 111° and Cl–O bond lengths of 156 pm.
Chlorite is the strongest oxidiser of the chlorine oxyanions on the basis of standard half cell potentials.

==Uses==
The most important chlorite is sodium chlorite (NaClO2), used in the bleaching of textiles, pulp, and paper. However, despite its strongly oxidizing nature, it is often not used directly, being instead used to generate the neutral species chlorine dioxide (ClO2), normally via a reaction with HCl:

:5 NaClO2 + 4 HCl → 5 NaCl + 4 ClO2 + 2 H2O

== Health risks ==
In 2009, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, or OEHHA, released a public health goal of maintaining amounts lower than 50 parts per billion for chlorite in drinking water after scientists in the state reported that exposure to higher levels of chlorite affect sperm and thyroid function, cause stomach ulcers, and caused red blood cell damage in laboratory animals. Some studies have indicated that at certain levels chlorite may also be carcinogenic. 

The federal legal limit in the United States allows chlorite up to levels of 1,000 parts per billion in drinking water, 20 times as much chlorite as California’s public health goal.

==Other oxyanions==
Several oxyanions of chlorine exist, in which it can assume oxidation states of −1, +1, +3, +5, or +7 within the corresponding anions Cl−, ClO−, , , or , known commonly and respectively as chloride, hypochlorite, chlorite, chlorate, and perchlorate. These are part of a greater family of other chlorine oxides.

<doc id="158904" wikidata="Q654953" url="?curid=158904" title="Ariana Afghan Airlines">
<text>Ariana Afghan Airlines Co. Ltd. () also known simply as Ariana, is the flag carrier and largest airline of Afghanistan. Founded in 1955, Ariana is state owned and the oldest airline in the country. The company has its main base at Kabul International Airport, from which it operates domestic flights and international connections to destinations in China, India, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. The carrier is headquartered in Shāre Naw district, Kabul. Ariana Afghan Airlines has been on the list of air carriers banned in the European Union .

==History==

===Early years===

The airline was set up on 27 January 1955. It was established as &quot;Aryana Airlines&quot; with the assistance of &quot;Indamer Co. Ltd.&quot;, which initially held a 49% stake, and the government of Afghanistan owned the balance. At the beginning, services were operated to Bahrain, India, Iran, and Lebanon, with a fleet of three Douglas DC-3s. In 1957, Pan American World Airways became the minor shareholder of the airline when it took over the 49% interest from Indamer. Domestic scheduled services started the same year. By , a fleet of three DC-3s was being used for linking Kabul with Amritsar, Delhi, Jeddah, and Karachi, as well as with some points within Afghanistan, while a single DC-4 operated the Kabul–Kandahar–Tehran–Damascus–Beirut–Ankara–Prague–Frankfurt service, the so-called &quot;Marco Polo&quot; route. In the early 1960s, from US aid to Afghanistan was used to capitalise the company.

By , the airline had 650 employees. At this time, the fleet comprised one Boeing 727-100C, one CV-440, one DC-3 and two Douglas DC-6s that worked on routes serving the Middle East, India, Pakistan, the USSR, and Istanbul, Frankfurt, and London. Domestic services were then operated by &quot;Bakhtar Alwatana&quot;, which was established by the government in 1967 for this purpose.
The carrier&#x27;s first widebody aircraft, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, entered the fleet in early . By , the aircraft fleet consisted of the DC-10 and two Boeing 727-100Cs. In the mid-1980s, during the Soviet–Afghan War, the carrier was forced to sell the DC-10 to British Caledonian, as the Soviets wanted the carrier to fly the Tupolev Tu-154 as a replacement. In , Ariana was taken over by Bakhtar Afghan Airlines, which became the country&#x27;s new national airline. In 1986, &quot;Bakhtar&quot; ordered two Tupolev Tu-154Ms; the airline took possession of these aircraft in . In , &quot;Bakhtar&quot; was merged back into &quot;Ariana&quot;, thus creating an airline which could serve both short and long haul routes.

===Operational crisis===

Following the fall of Kabul to the Taliban in 1996 and the proclamation of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, the country faced substantial economic sanctions from the international sector during the Taliban regime. The sanctions, along with the Taliban government&#x27;s control of the company and the grounding of many of the carrier&#x27;s international flights, had a devastating effect on the economic health of the company through the 1990s. The fleet was reduced to only a handful of Russian and Ukrainian built An-26s, Yakovlev Yak-40s and three Boeing 727s, which were used on the longest domestic routes. In October 1996, Pakistan provided a temporary maintenance and operational base at Karachi. With no overseas assets, by 1999 Ariana&#x27;s international operations consisted of flights to Dubai only; also, limited cargo flights continued into China&#x27;s western provinces. However, sanctions imposed by UN Security Council Resolution 1267 in November 1999 forced the airline to suspend overseas operations. In , Ariana was grounded completely.

According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;:
According to people interviewed by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Viktor Bout&#x27;s companies helped in running the airline.

===21st century===

Following the overthrow of the Taliban government during Operation Enduring Freedom, Ariana began to rebuild its operations in . About a month later, the UN sanctions were finally lifted, permitting the airline to resume international routes again. In 2002, the government of India gave the carrier a gift of three ex-Air India Airbus A300s. Ariana&#x27;s first international passenger flight since 1999 landed at Indira Gandhi International Airport in , followed by routes to Pakistan and Germany in June and October the same year, respectively. In 2005, India signed an agreement on aviation cooperation with Afghanistan, with Air India training 50 officials for Ariana.

==== EU ban ====
Due to safety regulations, Ariana was mostly banned from flying into European Union airspace in , with the European Commission allowing the carrier to fly only a single France-registered Airbus A310 into the member states; the ban was extended to the entire fleet in October of that year. The ban was confirmed in subsequent updates of the list released in late 2009 and . In , all Afghanistan-registered aircraft were banned from operating in the European Union. Ariana is still included in the list .

==== Taliban takeover ====
All commercial flights were cancelled following the Taliban taking over the capital city of Kabul in 2021. Domestic flights resumed in September.

==Destinations==
, Ariana Afghan Airlines served five domestic and eight international destinations in Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, India, Pakistan, and China; most of the routes radiate from Kabul.

<text>Equity, formerly officially titled the British Actors&#x27; Equity Association, is the trade union for the performing arts and entertainment industries in the United Kingdom.

Formed by a group of West End performers in 1930, the union grew to include performers and stage management nationwide, as well as gaining recognition in audio, film, and television. Equity incorporated the Variety Artistes&#x27; Federation in 1967, and now represents most professionals whose work is presented on stage or screen.

As of 2021, it had just over 46,000 members, including actors, singers, dancers, variety artistes and other performers, models, theatre directors, choreographers, designers, and stage management.

Equity requires its members to have unique professional names to avoid confusion with other artists and entertainers.

==History==
Equity was created in 1930 by a group of West End performers, including Godfrey Tearle, May Whitty and Ben Webster. They were advised by Robert Young, the &quot;Actors&#x27; MP&quot;. Like many other British trade unions, Equity operated a closed shop policy, so it was not possible for someone to join unless they had a record of sufficient paid work and most jobs were reserved for Equity card holders. To allow new members to join, there were a limited number of non-card-holding jobs on regional productions. While working on these productions, actors held a provisional membership card, and could apply for full membership upon completing the requisite number of weeks, subsequently allowing them to work in the West End or on film and television.

As a result of reforms of trade unions by Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Conservative government and the introduction of European legislation, closed-shop unions became illegal in the UK and Equity discontinued their closed-shop policy in the 1980s. However, to join Equity in the present day, evidence of sufficient paid professional work must still be provided. In 1976, Equity introduced a policy of refusing to sell programmes to the SABC, an action that led to a virtual ban of British television in apartheid-era South Africa, which was not lifted until 1993.

The Clarence Derwent Awards are theatre awards given annually by Equity on Broadway in the US and Equity UK in London&#x27;s West End.

In regard to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, Equity released a statement: &#x27;Equity stands full square behind our sister union.&#x27;

<doc id="158909" wikidata="Q2332569" url="?curid=158909" title="Cult Awareness Network">
<text>The Cult Awareness Network (CAN) was an anti-cult organization founded by deprogrammer Ted Patrick that provided information on groups it considered &quot;cults&quot;, as well as support and referrals to deprogrammers. It operated (initially under the name “Citizens’ Freedom Foundation”) from the mid 1970s to the mid 1990s in the United States.

The Cult Awareness Network was the most notable organization to emerge from the anti-cult movement in America. In the 1970s, a growing number of large and small New Religious Movements caused alarm in some sections of the community, based in part on the fear of &quot;brainwashing&quot; or &quot;mind control&quot; allegedly employed by these groups. The Cult Awareness Network presented itself as a source of information about &quot;cults&quot;; by 1991 it was monitoring over 200 groups that it referred to as &quot;mind-control cults&quot;. It also promoted a form of coercive intervention by self-styled &quot;deprogrammers&quot; who would, for a significant fee, forcibly detain or even abduct the cult member and subject them to a barrage of attacks on their beliefs, supposedly in order to counter the effects of the brainwashing. The practice, which could involve criminal actions such as kidnapping and false imprisonment, generated controversy, and Ted Patrick and others faced both civil and criminal proceedings.

After CAN lost a lawsuit and filed for bankruptcy in 1996, lawyer and Scientologist Steven L. Hayes acquired the rights to CAN&#x27;s name, logo, PO box, and hot-line phone number, and licensed the name to the &quot;Foundation for Religious Freedom&quot;, who established the New Cult Awareness Network. Hayes made the purchase with funds raised from private donations, not from the Church of Scientology, although a number of scientologists had been among the most active participants in a coalition of religious freedom advocates from whom he had collected money. The Church of Scientology had previously been one of CAN&#x27;s main targets.

==History==
In the United States in the early 1970s there was an increasing number of New Religious Movements. In 1971, Ted Patrick founded FREECOG (Parents Committee to Free Our Sons and Daughters from the Children of God). In 1974, he founded the more wide-ranging &quot;Citizen&#x27;s Freedom Foundation&quot; (CFF), and began offering &#x27;deprogramming&#x27; services to people who wanted to break a family member&#x27;s connection to an NRM. The deprogramming methods involved abduction, physical restraint, detention over days or weeks, food and sleep deprivation, prolonged verbal and emotional abuse, and desecration of the symbols of the victim&#x27;s faith. The perpetrators&#x27; justification for these actions was that the individual had been &quot;brainwashed&quot;, and was not amenable to reason.

Brainwashing theory denied the possibility of authentic spiritual choice for an NRM member, proposing instead that such individuals were subject to systematic mind control programs that overrode their capacity for independent volition. Ted Patrick&#x27;s theory of brainwashing was that individuals were hypnotized by brainwaves projected from a recruiter&#x27;s eyes and fingertips, after which the state was maintained by constant indoctrination, a totalistic environment and self-hypnosis. Most academic research, however, indicated that the reasons for people joining, remaining in, or leaving NRMs were complex, varied from group to group and individual to individual, and generally reflected the continued presence of a capacity for individual responsibility and choice.

Patrick&#x27;s organizations were later merged to become the Cult Awareness Network. CAN became the most prominent group in the emerging national anti-cult movement of the 70s and 80s. The anti-cult movement lobbied for state and national legislative action to legitimize its activities, and although this had very limited success, the movement was nevertheless able to forge alliances with a number of governmental agencies. This was primarily on the back of its propagation of the &quot;cult/mind control ideology&quot;, which succeeded in turning affiliation with NRMs into an issue of public—rather than private—concern, and gave a pseudo-legitimacy to the anti-cultists&#x27; more extreme claims and actions. By 1991, the Cult Awareness Network had twenty-three chapters dedicated to monitoring over two hundred groups that it referred to as &quot;mind control cults&quot;.

Although CFF and CAN were in favor of deprogramming, they distanced themselves from the practice from the late 1970s onwards. Despite this apparent repudiation, however, they continued the practice. In the 1980s, CAN referred thousands of paying clients to activist members who kept lists of deprogrammers. The total number that occurred is unknown, but in 1980 Ted Patrick claimed to have been hired over 2000 times as a professional abductor. Many other operators emerged both during and after the period in which he was active, many of them trained by him. Deprogramming was an integral part of the anti-cult ideology and economy, and was seen as an effective response to the demand emanating from people who wanted a family member extracted, but it also clashed with the need for anti-cult organizations to present themselves as &#x27;educational&#x27; associations (CFF, for example, received tax-exempt status as an educational trust). This, along with its tenuous legal and moral status, meant that deprogramming tended to be publicly disavowed, while its practice continued clandestinely. The Cult Awareness Network became the subject of controversy when Patrick and other CAN-associated figures, such as Galen Kelly and Donald Moore, were convicted of crimes committed in the course of deprogrammings.

Patricia Ryan, the daughter of US Congressman Leo J. Ryan (D-Millbrae, California), who died from gunfire while investigating conditions at the Peoples Temple compound in Jonestown, Guyana, was president of CAN from 1990 to 1993. Actor Mike Farrell served on the board of advisors of CAN.

In 1990, the Cult Awareness Network established the &quot;John Gordon Clark Fund&quot;, in honor of psychiatrist John G. Clark, who had given testimony about Scientology and other groups. The fund was established to assist former members of destructive cults.

Detractors Susan E. Darnell, Anson D. Shupe, and Church of Scientology attorney Kendrick Moxon charged that CAN deliberately provided a distorted picture of the groups it tracked.

In 1991, &quot;Time&quot; magazine quoted then CAN director Cynthia Kisser in its article &quot;The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power&quot;. Kisser stated: &quot;Scientology is quite likely the most ruthless, the most classically terroristic, the most litigious and the most lucrative cult the country has ever seen. No cult extracts more money from its members&quot;. This quote has since been referenced verbatim in other secondary sources discussing Scientology. These comments and other forms of criticism from CAN garnered the attention of the Church of Scientology and Landmark Education, and both separately began litigation proceedings against the organization.

CAN declared bankruptcy after a jury found that CAN conspired to violate the civil rights and religious liberties of Jason Scott, a Pentecostalist, who had been forcibly kidnapped and subjected to a failed deprogramming by Rick Ross, a CAN-referred deprogrammer, and others. The court ordered CAN to pay a judgment of 1 million USD. The large award was intended to deter similar conduct in the future; the court noted that the defendants were unable to appreciate the maliciousness of their conduct towards the deprogrammee, and portrayed themselves, throughout the entire process of litigation, as victims of the alleged agenda of the plaintiff&#x27;s attorney, Church of Scientology attorney Kendrick Moxon.

In 1996, CAN went bankrupt and its assets were bought by a coalition of organizations and individuals, including Scientologists. The bankruptcy trustee told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that he put CAN&#x27;s name-brand assets on the auction block only because Kisser herself asked to buy them. As a result of a legal settlement with Landmark Education, CAN agreed not to sell copies of &quot;Outrageous Betrayal&quot;, a book critical of Werner Erhard, for five years after it emerged from bankruptcy proceedings. Following its bankruptcy, the files of the &quot;Old CAN&quot; were made available to scholars for study and transferred to a university library.

===Deprogramming referral kickback scheme – NARDEC===
The National Resource Development and Economic Council (NARDEC) was formed in the mid-1980s and had become institutionalized as a special unit within CAN by 1987. The unit&#x27;s role was to provide referrals to deprogrammers in exchange for a &quot;kickback&quot; – either in cash or in the form of a tax-deductible &quot;donation&quot; or &quot;commissions&quot; which were then funneled back to national CAN headquarters.

Journalist Nora Hamerman, in writing about the Dobkowski deprogramming, referred to CAN as &quot;a clearinghouse for kidnap-for-hire rings&quot;, with her phrase affirmed by scholarly researchers as &quot;an apt description&quot; of CAN.
Hamerman referred to the &quot;financial symbiosis between CAN and coercive deprogrammers&quot;. 

CAN-associated deprogrammers included Steven Hassan, Carol Giambalvo, Rick Ross, Ted Patrick, Galen Kelly David Clark, and Robert Point.

==Reception==

The Jason Scott case in 1995 demonstrated the ongoing involvement of the &quot;Old CAN&quot; in deprogramming referrals. Also, in 1993, the trial of deprogrammer Galen Kelly revealed that the &quot;Old CAN&quot; had, contrary to its stated policy, paid Kelly a monthly stipend during the 1990s.

Sociologist Anson Shupe, Susan E. Darnell, and Church of Scientology attorney Kendrick Moxon have alleged that the &quot;Old CAN&quot; could be described as a criminal organization operating in large part for the profit to certain actors, and that it cultivated a hypocritical and deceptive public persona. They alleged that despite public denials, the &quot;Old CAN&quot; operating policy included routine referrals to coercive deprogrammers, citing, among others, FBI wiretap evidence documenting frequent, casual contact between coercive deprogrammers and Cynthia Kisser, the executive director of the &quot;Old CAN&quot;. They further allege money laundering, and personal enrichment by some &quot;Old CAN&quot; officials, as well as the use of legal and illegal drugs by deprogrammers during deprogrammings, and occurrences of sexual intercourse between deprogrammers and deprogrammees. Shupe and Darnell expanded on these topics in their 2006 book &quot;Agents of Discord&quot;, referencing their prior work with Kendrick Moxon.

In chapter 8 of &quot;The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements&quot;, Shupe, Bromley, and Darnell state that the &quot;Old CAN&quot; countered fiscal challenges by soliciting donations for referrals whereby exit counsellors or deprogrammers either made donations themselves, or had client families make donations to the &quot;Old CAN&quot;, and that these donations made up as much as one-third of &quot;Old CAN&quot; revenues. While the &quot;Old CAN&quot; was set up as a tax-exempt organization serving educational purposes, coercive deprogramming referrals remained an integral part of its economy and response pattern, a contradiction that was concealed, but not resolved by the &quot;Old CAN&quot; publicly renouncing deprogramming while covertly engaging in referrals. The authors state that ironically the &quot;Old CAN&quot; was finally &quot;undone by the same kind of civil suit strategy it had employed against [new religious movements], in a case involving the same type of coercive practices it accused cults of employing, and with the result that its name and assets were purchased by members of one of its most bitter enemies&quot;, the Church of Scientology.

=== Landmark Education ===
According to the (Old) Cult Awareness Network&#x27;s executive director, Landmark Education and the Church of Scientology were the two groups for which CAN received the highest number of inquiries from concerned relatives – twenty-five per month per group. In an interview, CAN&#x27;s executive director emphasized that the label &quot;cult&quot; with regard to Landmark Education was not important; but rather greater scrutiny of its practices was needed. Specifically, CAN stressed concerning characteristics, such as &quot;the long hours during which the participant is in the organization&#x27;s total control, receiving input from only one source, removed from any support system except for the seminar group itself&quot;. In 1994, Landmark Education Corporation sued the Cult Awareness Network for 40 million USD, claiming that CAN had labeled Landmark Education as a cult. The case itself involved a dispute over the legality and applicable usage of what William Joseph Matthews termed &quot;cult indoctrination procedures&quot;. CAN later settled and made a statement that it did not consider Landmark Education a cult, as part of the settlement agreement.

During the litigation proceedings between Landmark Education and the Cult Awareness Network, Landmark Education spent months attempting to compel legal journalist Steven Pressman to respond to deposition questions aimed at obtaining the confidential sources he used for research on his book about Werner Erhard, &quot;Outrageous Betrayal&quot;. Though the deposition questions were brought under the pretext of compelling discovery for use in Landmark Education&#x27;s lawsuit against CAN, Pressman concluded that the deposition questioning was mainly a form of harassment. The discovery commissioner who entered an interim order in the matter, commented that &quot;it does not appear that the information sought [from Mr. Pressman] is directly relevant or goes to the heart of the [CAN] action, or that alternative sources have been exhausted or are inadequate&quot;. The action against Pressman was dropped after the Cult Awareness Network litigation was settled. As a result of the Cult Awareness Network settlement with Landmark Education, CAN agreed to cease selling copies of &quot;Outrageous Betrayal&quot; for at least five years. From the resolution of CAN&#x27;s board of directors: &quot;In the interests of settling a dispute and in deference to Landmark&#x27;s preference, however, CAN now agrees not to sell the Pressman Book for at least five years after CAN emerges from bankruptcy&quot;. CAN&#x27;s executive director maintained that the purpose of Landmark Education&#x27;s lawsuits was not to recover lost funds, but to &quot;gag critics&quot;. Along with Scientology, Landmark Education was granted access to Cult Awareness Network&#x27;s files, which contained phone records and data on individuals who had previously sought information on these groups.

=== Church of Scientology&#x27;s response ===
The Church of Scientology had long characterized the Cult Awareness Network as both an opponent of religious freedom and a &quot;hate group&quot;. In 1990, a woman named Jolie Steckart, posing as Laura Terepin, applied to volunteer for the (original) Cult Awareness Network. Bob Minton later hired a private investigator to look into this, and in 1998 discovered that she was actually a &quot;deep undercover agent&quot;, who was managed by David Lee, a private investigator hired by the Church of Scientology. Steckart had also attempted to infiltrate the Scientology-critical organization FACTNet.

In 1991, over fifty Scientologists from across the United States filed civil suits against the Cult Awareness Network, many of whom used the same carbon copy claims through influence from the Los Angeles, California law firm Bowles &amp; Moxon. In addition, Scientologists filed dozens of discrimination complaints against CAN, with state human rights commissions in the United States. The Cult Awareness Network, which ran on a budget of 300,000 USD per year, was unable to cope with this amount of litigation. By 1994, it had been dropped by all of its insurance companies, and still owed tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees. Kendrick Moxon, chief attorney for the Church of Scientology, had stated that the lawsuits were brought to address discrimination against individuals who wanted to reform the Cult Awareness Network. These fifty individuals had all simultaneously tried to join the organization. When the Cult Awareness Network&#x27;s executive director turned down the applications for fear that the new Scientologist applicants would overtake control of CAN, they sued in separate lawsuits claiming religious discrimination. Though Moxon handled the litigation for all of the lawsuits, the Church of Scientology maintained that it did not provide the financial backing for the suits. Moxon did acknowledge that his firm Moxon &amp; Bowles had represented the plaintiffs in the case at virtually no charge, and that Scientology churches &quot;helped a little bit, but very little&quot;, with the litigation costs.

Daniel Leipold, the attorney who represented CAN in the suits, believed that the Church of Scientology did indeed have a role in the financial backing of the suits, stating, &quot;for every nickel we spent, they spent at least a dollar&quot;.
Leipold also stated that when he began to take statements from some of the Scientologist plaintiffs in the process of his defense of CAN, &quot;[s]everal of the plaintiffs said they had not seen or signed the lawsuits, even though the court papers bore their signatures&quot;. One Scientologist plaintiff told CAN attorneys that he could not recall how he initially got the contact information of CAN officials, or who had asked him to write to the organization. Another Scientologist later fired his lawyer and asked a judge to dismiss his own case against CAN, saying that Eugene Ingram, a private investigator for the Church of Scientology, had paid him three hundred dollars to have lunch where he agreed to be a plaintiff and signed a blank page for Church of Scientology attorneys. CAN attorney Leipold stated, &quot;Scientology planned, instigated, coordinated and sponsored a plan to subject CAN to multiple lawsuits in multiple jurisdictions in order to overwhelm and eliminate it or take it over and control it&quot;. Frank Oliver, who was until 1993 an operative in the Church of Scientology&#x27;s Office of Special Affairs division (OSA), asserted that his last assignment with the OSA branch was to assist Kendrick Moxon in developing a special unit to target the Cult Awareness Network. Oliver stated that this unit was tasked with recruiting plaintiffs to sue the Cult Awareness Network, with the intention that these lawsuits would put CAN out of business. In 1995, members of the Church of Scientology picketed the home of ex-Scientology staff members Robert Vaughn Young and Stacy Young. A Scientology spokeswoman called it &quot;a peaceful First Amendment demonstration to protest the Youngs&#x27; involvement with the Cult Awareness Network&quot;. In a 2005 interview with the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, a Church of Scientology spokesperson stated that the Church was not responsible for the litigation leading to CAN&#x27;s bankruptcy.

Church of Scientology leader David Miscavige appeared in his first ever interview with the media on the program &quot;Nightline&quot; on February 14, 1992, and was interviewed by Ted Koppel. Miscavige stated that he believed Scientology did not &quot;lend itself well to the press&quot;, and he criticized a piece on Scientology that aired on &quot;Nightline&quot; shortly before his interview. In his criticism of the piece, Miscavige asserted that &quot;Nightline&quot; correspondents had only interviewed members of CAN, stating, &quot;For instance, something that isn&#x27;t mentioned in there is that every single detractor on there is part of a religious hate group called Cult Awareness Network and their sister group called American Family Foundation. Now, I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve heard of these people, but it&#x27;s the same as the KKK would be with the blacks. I think if you interviewed a neo-Nazi and asked them to talk about the Jews, you would get a similar result to what you have here.&quot; Koppel then posited the notion that others critical of Scientology were less apt to come forward and speak publicly due to fears of potential recrimination from the Church. In 1994, the Cult Awareness Network opened a counter-suit against the Church of Scientology, eleven individual Scientologists and the Los Angeles law firm of Bowles and Moxon.

== Jason Scott case ==

In 1995, CAN, and two co-defendants were found guilty of negligence and conspiracy to violate the civil rights and religious liberties of Jason Scott, then a member of the Life Tabernacle Church, a small United Pentecostalist congregation in Bellevue, Washington. Rick Alan Ross was acquitted in the criminal trial. A CAN volunteer had referred Ross to Scott&#x27;s mother, endorsing his ability as a deprogrammer. The mother thereupon retained Ross&#x27;s services. In a civil trial, Ross was ordered to pay more than 3 million USD in damages; CAN, having referred Ross to Scott&#x27;s mother, was ordered to pay a judgement of 1 million USD. The court found that CAN volunteers had routinely referred callers to deprogrammers.

CAN appealed the decision but a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the award, two of the three judges finding against CAN, with the third judge dissenting. The full 9th Circuit court then voted against reconsidering the case. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a final appeal by CAN in March 1999.

Ross went into bankruptcy, but emerged in December 1996 when Scott reconciled with his mother and settled with Ross for five-thousand dollars and 200 hours of Ross&#x27;s services &quot;as an expert consultant and intervention specialist&quot;. Scott fired his attorney Kendrick Moxon the next day and retained long-time Church of Scientology opponent Graham Berry as his lawyer instead.

After Scott fired Moxon, Moxon filed emergency motions in two states and alleged Scott had been influenced by supporters of CAN to hire Berry as his lawyer. &quot;He&#x27;s really been abused by CAN and disgustingly abused by this guy Berry&quot;, said Moxon in a statement in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Moxon, who had argued in the case that Ross and associates had hindered a competent adult&#x27;s freedom to make his own religious decisions, immediately filed court papers seeking to rescind the settlement and appoint a guardian for Scott, whom he called &quot;incapacitated&quot;. That effort failed.

Scott stated that he felt he had been manipulated as part of the Church of Scientology&#x27;s plan to destroy CAN. According to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Scott and his relatives felt Moxon was not paying enough attention to Scott&#x27;s financial judgment, and was instead focused on a &quot;personal vendetta&quot; against CAN. Moxon himself was a Scientologist and former official of the Church of Scientology. &quot;Basically, Jason said he was tired of being the poster boy for the Scientologists. My son has never been a member of the Church of Scientology. When he was approached by Moxon, he was lured by his promises of a $1 million settlement, so he went for it&quot;, said Scott&#x27;s mother Katherine Tonkin in a statement to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.

=== Demise of the &quot;Old CAN&quot; ===
Scott sold his $1,875,000 USD judgment against CAN for $25,000 USD to Gerry Beany, a Scientologist represented by Moxon, whereby Beany had the largest claim against CAN in the bankruptcy proceeding. In satisfaction of that debt, CAN agreed to give Beany all of CAN&#x27;s files and records. Beany, in turn, donated the records to the Foundation for Religious Freedom.

That bankruptcy was the demise of the &quot;Old CAN&quot;, marking the end of the cult wars—at least in North America. Controversies surrounding new religious movements continued, but the debate thereafter largely moved to other arenas than the courts.

== Waco siege ==

According to Alexander Cockburn, the role of the Cult Awareness Network and its representatives &quot;may well have been crucial&quot; in the law enforcement actions during the 1993 Waco siege. A series of newspaper articles in the &quot;Waco Tribune-Herald&quot; and allegations of child abuse by CAN Executive Director Priscilla Coates were followed by increasing interest and investigation by law enforcement.

On 8 April 1993, during the siege of the Branch Davidians compound, CAN president Patricia Ryan (daughter of slain U.S. Representative Leo Ryan) stated that the FBI should use any means necessary to arrest David Koresh, including lethal force. Throughout the siege, representatives from CAN offered unsolicited assistance to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and FBI. Representatives also made numerous media appearances, including making statements that the FBI commander felt &quot;could set back negotiations substantially&quot;. The siege ultimately ended on April 19 with the death of 76 people, including Koresh.

In a 1996 joint hearing before the United States Congress on the Waco siege entitled &quot;Activities of Federal Law Enforcement Agencies Toward the Branch Davidians&quot;, it was stated into the record that publicists for the New Alliance Party had circulated a report to Congress and the media called &quot;What is the Cult Awareness Network and What Role Did it Play in Waco?&quot; Testimony was also entered into the record stating, &quot;Their report relied on [conspiracy theorist] Linda Thompson, organizations created or funded by the Church of Scientology and the Unification Church, long-time cult apologist Dean Kelley, and others who would minimize public concern about destructive cult phenomena&quot;.

==&quot;60 Minutes&quot; special report==

In 1997, two years after the Scott case, CBS News aired a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; special on the case. Among other things, it discovered that a signatory who had been responsible for one of the most damaging affidavits against CAN had renounced his testimony. &quot;60 Minutes&quot; also reported that a private investigator could find no evidence regarding CAN&#x27;s alleged use of deprogrammers. Given this evidence sociologist Stephen Kent concludes that the case against CAN was &quot;weak&quot;.

<doc id="158914" wikidata="Q191939" url="?curid=158914" title="Arsenopyrite">
<text>Arsenopyrite (IMA symbol: Apy) is an iron arsenic sulfide (FeAsS). It is a hard (Mohs 5.5–6) metallic, opaque, steel grey to silver white mineral with a relatively high specific gravity of 6.1. 

When dissolved in nitric acid, it releases elemental sulfur. When arsenopyrite is heated, it produces sulfur and arsenic vapor. With 46% arsenic content, arsenopyrite, along with orpiment, is a principal ore of arsenic. When deposits of arsenopyrite become exposed to the atmosphere, the mineral slowly converts into iron arsenates. Arsenopyrite is generally an acid-consuming sulfide mineral, unlike iron pyrite which can lead to acid mine drainage.

The crystal habit, hardness, density, and garlic odour when struck are diagnostic. Arsenopyrite in older literature may be referred to as &quot;mispickel&quot;, a name of German origin. It is also sometimes referred to as mundic, a word derived from Cornish dialect and which also refers to a copper ore, as well as a form of deterioration in aggregate concrete made with mine tailings.

Arsenopyrite also can be associated with significant amounts of gold. Consequently, it serves as an indicator of gold bearing reefs. Many arsenopyrite gold ores are refractory, i.e. the gold is not easily cyanide leached from the mineral matrix.

Arsenopyrite is found in high temperature hydrothermal veins, in pegmatites, and in areas of contact metamorphism or metasomatism.

==Crystallography==

Arsenopyrite crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system and often shows prismatic crystal or columnar forms with striations and twinning common. Arsenopyrite may be referred to in older references as orthorhombic, but it has been shown to be monoclinic. In terms of its atomic structure, each Fe center is linked to three As atoms and three S atoms. The material can be described as Fe3+ with the diatomic trianion AsS3−. The connectivity of the atoms is more similar to that in marcasite than pyrite. The ion description is imperfect because the material is semiconducting and the Fe-As and Fe-S bonds are highly covalent.

==Related minerals==
Various transition group metals can substitute for iron in arsenopyrite. The arsenopyrite group includes the following rare minerals:
*Clinosafflorite: 
*Gudmundite: 
*Glaucodot or alloclasite: or 
*Iridarsenite: 
*Osarsite or ruarsite: or

<doc id="158916" wikidata="Q111044" url="?curid=158916" title="Chalcopyrite">
<text>Chalcopyrite ( ) is a copper iron sulfide mineral and the most abundant copper ore mineral. It has the chemical formula CuFeS2 and crystallizes in the tetragonal system. It has a brassy to golden yellow color and a hardness of 3.5 to 4 on the Mohs scale. Its streak is diagnostic as green-tinged black.

On exposure to air, chalcopyrite tarnishes to a variety of oxides, hydroxides, and sulfates. Associated copper minerals include the sulfides bornite (Cu5FeS4), chalcocite (Cu2S), covellite (CuS), digenite (Cu9S5); carbonates such as malachite and azurite, and rarely oxides such as cuprite (Cu2O). It is rarely found in association with native copper. Chalcopyrite is a conductor of electricity.

Copper can be extracted from chalcopyrite ore using various methods. The two predominant methods are pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy, the former being the most commercially viable.

== Etymology ==
The name chalcopyrite comes from the Greek words , which means copper, and , which means striking fire. It was sometimes historically referred to as &quot;yellow copper&quot;.

== Identification ==
Chalcopyrite is often confused with pyrite and gold since all three of these minerals have a yellowish color and a metallic luster. Some important mineral characteristics that help distinguish these minerals are hardness and streak. Chalcopyrite is much softer than pyrite and can be scratched with a knife, whereas pyrite cannot be scratched by a knife. However, chalcopyrite is harder than gold, which, if pure, can be scratched by copper. Additionally, gold is malleable, while chalcopyrite is brittle. Chalcopyrite has a distinctive black streak with green flecks in it. Pyrite has a black streak and gold has a yellow streak.

== Chemistry ==
Natural chalcopyrite has no solid solution series with any other sulfide minerals. There is limited substitution of zinc with copper despite chalcopyrite having the same crystal structure as sphalerite.

Minor amounts of elements such as silver, gold, cadmium, cobalt, nickel, lead, tin, and zinc can be measured (at parts per million levels), likely substituting for copper and iron. Selenium, bismuth, tellurium, and arsenic may substitute for sulfur in minor amounts. Chalcopyrite can be oxidized to form malachite, azurite, and cuprite.

== Structure ==
Chalcopyrite is a member of the tetragonal crystal system. Crystallographically the structure of chalcopyrite is closely related to that of zinc blende ZnS (sphalerite). The unit cell is twice as large, reflecting an alternation of Cu+ and Fe3+ ions replacing Zn2+ ions in adjacent cells. In contrast to the pyrite structure chalcopyrite has single S2− sulfide anions rather than disulfide pairs. Another difference is that the iron cation is not diamagnetic low spin Fe(II) as in pyrite.

In the crystal structure, each metal ion is tetrahedrally coordinated to 4 sulfur anions. Each sulfur anion is bonded to two copper atoms and two iron atoms.

== Paragenesis ==

Chalcopyrite is present with many ore-bearing environments via a variety of ore forming processes.

Chalcopyrite is present in volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposits and sedimentary exhalative deposits, formed by deposition of copper during hydrothermal circulation. Chalcopyrite is concentrated in this environment via fluid transport. Porphyry copper ore deposits are formed by concentration of copper within a granitic stock during the ascent and crystallisation of a magma. Chalcopyrite in this environment is produced by concentration within a magmatic system.

Chalcopyrite is an accessory mineral in Kambalda type komatiitic nickel ore deposits, formed from an immiscible sulfide liquid in sulfide-saturated ultramafic lavas. In this environment chalcopyrite is formed by a sulfide liquid stripping copper from an immiscible silicate liquid.

Chalcopyrite has been the most important ore of copper since the Bronze Age.

== Occurrence ==

Even though Chalcopyrite does not contain the most copper in its structure relative to other minerals, it is the most important copper ore since it can be found in many localities. Chalcopyrite ore occurs in a variety of ore types, from huge masses as at Timmins, Ontario, to irregular veins and disseminations associated with granitic to dioritic intrusives as in the porphyry copper deposits of Broken Hill, the American Cordillera and the Andes. The largest deposit of nearly pure chalcopyrite ever discovered in Canada was at the southern end of the Temagami Greenstone Belt where Copperfields Mine extracted the high-grade copper.

Chalcopyrite is present in the supergiant Olympic Dam Cu-Au-U deposit in South Australia.

Chalcopyrite may also be found in coal seams associated with pyrite nodules, and as disseminations in carbonate sedimentary rocks.

== Extraction of copper ==

Copper metal is predominantly extracted from chalcopyrite ore using two methods: pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy. The most common and commercially viable method, pyrometallurgy, involves &quot;crushing, grinding, flotation, smelting, refining, and electro-refining&quot; techniques. Crushing, leaching, solvent extraction, and electrowinning are techniques used in hydrometallurgy. Specifically in the case of chalcopyrite, pressure oxidation leaching is practiced.

=== Pyrometallurgical processes ===
The most important method for copper extraction from chalcopyrite is pyrometallurgy. Pyrometallurgy is commonly used for large scale, copper rich operations with high-grade ores. This is because Cu-Fe-S ores, such as chalcopyrite, are difficult to dissolve in aqueous solutions. The extraction process using this method undergoes four stages:

# Isolating desired elements from ore using froth flotation to create a concentration
# Creating a high-Cu sulfide matte by smelting the concentration
# Oxidizing/converting the sulfide matte, resulting in an impure molten copper
# Refining by fire and electrowinning techniques to increase purity of resultant copper

Chalcopyrite ore is not directly smelted. This is because the ore is primarily composed of non-economically valuable material, or waste rock, with low concentrations of copper. The abundance of waste material results in a lot of hydrocarbon fuel being required to heat and melt the ore. Alternatively, copper is isolated from the ore first using a technique called froth flotation. Essentially, reagents are used to make the copper water-repellent, thus the Cu is able to concentrate in a flotation cell by floating on air bubbles. In contrast to the 0.5–2% copper in chalcopyrite ore, froth flotation results in a concentrate containing about 30% copper.

The concentrate then undergoes a process called matte smelting. Matte smelting oxidizes the sulfur and iron by melting the flotation concentrate in a 1250°C furnace to create a new concentrate (matte) with about 45–75% copper. This process is typically done in flash furnaces. To reduce the amount of copper in the slag material, the slag is kept molten with an addition of SiO2 flux to promote immiscibility between concentration and slag. In terms of byproducts, matte smelting copper can produce SO2 gas which is harmful to the environment, thus it is captured in the form of sulfuric acid. Example reactions are as follows:

# 2CuFeS2 (s) +3.25O2(g) → Cu2S-0.5FeS(l) + 1.5FeO(s) + 2.5SO2(g)
# 2FeO(s) + SiO2(s) → Fe2SiO4(l)

Converting involves oxidizing the matte once more to further remove sulfur and iron; however, the product is 99% molten copper. Converting occurs in two stages: the slag forming stage and the copper forming stage. In the slag forming stage, iron and sulfur are reduced to concentrations of less than 1% and 0.02%, respectively. The concentrate from matte smelting is poured into a converter that is then rotated, supplying the slag with oxygen through tuyeres. The reaction is as follows:

2FeS(l)+3O2(g)+SiO2(s) -&gt; Fe2SiO4(l) + 2SO2(g) + heat

In the copper forming stage, the matte produced from the slag stage undergoes charging (inputting the matte in the converter), blowing (blasting more oxygen), and skimming (retrieving impure molten copper known as blister copper). The reaction is as follows:

Cu2S(l) + O2(g) -&gt; 2Cu(l) + SO2(g) + heat

Finally, the blister copper undergoes refinement through fire, electrorefining or both. In this stage, copper is refined to a high-purity cathode.

=== Hydrometallurgical processes ===
Chalcopyrite is an exception to most copper bearing minerals. In contrast to the majority of copper minerals which can be leached at atmospheric conditions, such as through heap leaching, chalcopyrite is a refractory mineral that requires elevated temperatures as well as oxidizing conditions to release its copper into solution. This is because of the extracting challenges which arise from the 1:1 presence of iron to copper, resulting in slow leaching kinetics. Elevated temperatures and pressures create an abundance of oxygen in solution, which facilitates faster reaction speeds in terms of breaking down chalcopyrite&#x27;s crystal lattice. A hydrometallurgical process which elevates temperature with oxidizing conditions required for chalcopyrite is known as pressure oxidation leaching. A typical reaction series of chalcopyrite under oxidizing, high temperature conditions is as follows:

i) 2CuFeS2 + 4Fe2(SO4)3 -&gt; 2Cu2++ 2SO42- + 10FeSO4+4S

ii) 4FeSO4 + O2 + 2H2SO4 -&gt; 2Fe2(SO4)3 +2H2O

iii) 2S + 3O2 +2H2O -&gt; 2H2SO4

(overall) 4CuFeS2+ 17O2 + 4H2O -&gt; 4Cu2++ 2Fe2O3 + 4H2SO4

Pressure oxidation leaching is particularly useful for low grade chalcopyrite. This is because it can &quot;process concentrate product from flotation&quot; rather than having to process whole ore. Additionally, it can be used as an alternative method to pyrometallurgy for variable ore. Other advantages hydrometallurgical processes have in regards to copper extraction over pyrometallurgical processes (smelting) include:

* The highly variable cost of smelting
* Depending on the location, the amount of smelting availability is limited
* High cost of installing smelting infrastructure
* Ability to treat high-impurity concentrates
* Increase of recovery due to ability of treating lower-grade deposits on site
* Lower transport costs (shipping concentrate not necessary)
* Overall lower cost of copper production

Although hydrometallurgy has its advantages, it continues to face challenges in the commercial setting. In turn, smelting continues to remain the most commercially viable method of copper extraction.

<text>Maxims of equity are legal maxims that serve as a set of general principles or rules which are said to govern the way in which equity operates. They tend to illustrate the qualities of equity, in contrast to the common law, as a more flexible, responsive approach to the needs of the individual, inclined to take into account the parties&#x27; conduct and worthiness. They were developed by the English Court of Chancery and other courts that administer equity jurisdiction, including the law of trusts. Although the most fundamental and time honored of the maxims, listed on this page, are often referred to on their own as the &#x27;maxims of equity&#x27; or &#x27;the equitable maxims&#x27;, it cannot be said that there is a definitive list of them. Like other kinds of legal maxims or principles, they were originally, and sometimes still are, expressed in Latin.

==Role of maxims==
Maxims of equity are not a rigid set of rules, but are, rather, general principles which can be derived from in specific cases. Snell&#x27;s &quot;Equity&quot;, an English treatise, takes the view that the &quot;Maxims do not cover the whole ground, and moreover they overlap, one maxim contains by implication what belongs to another. Indeed it would not be difficult to reduce all under two: &#x27;Equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy&#x27; and &#x27;Equity acts &quot;in personam&quot; [on persons].

Jeffrey Hackney has argued that maxims are more harmful than helpful in understanding equitable principles:
==List of maxims==
===Equity looks on as done that which ought to have been done===
Sometimes phrased as &quot;equity regards as done what should have been done&quot;, this maxim means that when individuals are required, by their agreements or by law, to perform some act of legal significance, equity will regard that act as having been done as it ought to have been done, even before it has actually happened. This makes possible the legal phenomenon of equitable conversion.

The consequences of this maxim, and of equitable conversion, are significant in their bearing on the risk of loss in transactions. When parties enter a contract for a sale of real property, the buyer is deemed to have obtained an equitable right that becomes a legal right only after the deal is completed. (For an English example, see &quot;Walsh v Lonsdale&quot;.)

Due to his equitable interest in the outcome of the transaction, the buyer who suffers a breach may be entitled to the equitable remedy of specific performance (although not always, see below). If he is successful in seeking a remedy at law, he is entitled to the value of the property at the time of breach regardless of whether it has appreciated or depreciated.

The fact that the buyer may be forced to suffer a depreciation in the value of the property means that he bears the risk of loss if, for example, the improvements on the property he bought burn down while he is still in escrow.

Problems may sometimes arise because, through some lapse or omission, insurance coverage is not in force at the time a claim is made. If the policyholder has clearly been at fault in this connection, because, for example, he has not paid premiums when he should have, then it will normally be quite reasonable for an insurer to decline to meet the claim. However, it gets more difficult if the policyholder is no more at fault than the insurer. The fair solution in the circumstances may be arrived at by applying the principle that equity regards that as done that ought to be done. In other words, what would the position have been if what should have been done had been done?

Thus, we know in one case, premiums on a life insurance policy were overdue. The insurer&#x27;s letter to the policyholder warning him of this fact was never received by the policyholder, who died shortly after the policy consequently lapsed. It was clear that if the notice had been received by the policyholder, he or his wife would have taken steps to ensure the policy continued in force, because the policyholder was terminally ill at the time and the coverage provided by the policy was something his wife was plainly going to require in the foreseeable future. Since the policyholder would have been fully entitled to pay the outstanding premium at that stage, regardless of his physical condition, the insurer (with some persuasion from the Bureau) agreed that the matter should be dealt with as if the policyholder had done so. In other words, his widow was entitled to the sum assured less the outstanding premium. In other similar cases, however, it has not been possible to follow the same principle because there has not been sufficiently clear evidence that the policy would have been renewed.

Another illustration of the application of this equitable principle was in connection with motor vehicle insurance. A policyholder was provided with coverage on the basis that she was entitled to a &quot;no claims&quot; discount from her previous insurer. Confirmation to this effect from the previous insurer was required. When that was not forthcoming, her coverage was cancelled by the brokers who had issued the initial coverage note. This was done without reference to the insurer concerned whose normal practice in such circumstances would have been to maintain coverage and to require payment of the full premium until proof of the no claims discount was forthcoming. Such proof was eventually obtained by the policyholder, but only after she had been involved in an accident after the cancellation by the brokers of the policy. Here again, the fair outcome was to look at what would have happened if the insurer&#x27;s normal practice had been followed. In such circumstances, the policyholder would plainly have still had a policy at the time of the accident. The insurer itself had not acted incorrectly at any stage. However, in the circumstances, it was equitable for it to meet the claim.

===Equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy===
When seeking an equitable relief, the one that has been wronged has the stronger hand. The stronger hand is the one that has the capacity to ask for a legal remedy (judicial relief). In equity, this form of remedy is usually one of specific performance or an injunction (injunctive relief). These are superior remedies to those administered at common law such as damages. The Latin legal maxim is &quot;ubi jus ibi remedium&quot; (&quot;where there is a right there must be a remedy&quot;).

The maxim is necessarily subordinate to positive principles and cannot be applied either to subvert established rules of law or to give the courts a jurisdiction hitherto unknown, and it is only in a general not in a literal sense that the maxim has force.

Case law dealing with the principle of this maxim at law include &quot;Ashby v White&quot; (K.B. 1703) and &quot;Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents&quot; (U.S. 1971). The application of this principle at law was important to the decision of &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;, wherein it was invoked to establish that Marbury had a cause of action to his commission in the first place in order for Chief Justice Marshall to make his more wide-ranging decision. The United States&#x27; &quot;Bivens&quot; doctrine, however, has been sharply limited over time, such as in &quot;Egbert v. Boule&quot; (U.S. 2022), in favor of requiring causes of action to be explicitly authorized by statute.

===Equity will not allow a wrongdoer to profit by a wrong===
This principle is the basis for much of the law of restitution. In &quot;Jehon v Vivian&quot; (1876) Law Rep. 6 Ch. App. 742, Lord Chancellor Hatherley stated that &quot;this court never allows a man to make profit by a wrong.&quot;

The U.S. Supreme Court likewise stated in &quot;Root v. Railway Company&quot; (1881) that &quot;it would be inequitable that [a wrongdoer] should make a profit out of his own wrong.&quot; In &quot;Liu v. Securities and Exchange Commission&quot; (2020), the Supreme Court called this a &quot;foundational principle.&quot;

=== Equity does not punish ===
Lord Justice James stated in &quot;Vyse v. Foster&quot; (Ch.App. 1871) that &quot;This Court is not a Court of penal jurisdiction. It compels restitution of property unconscientiously withheld; it gives full compensation for any loss or damage through failure of some equitable duty; but it has no power of punishing anyone.&quot;

This is largely because equity is civil in nature, and not criminal. Criminal equity formerly existed in the infamous Star Chamber, but ceased to exist when that court was abolished. As such, equity generally will not enjoin a crime — nor enjoin a criminal proceeding. As stated in &quot;Mayor of York v. Pilkington&quot; (Ch. 1742), the Court of Chancery &quot;has not originally, and strictly, any restraining power over criminal prosecutions&quot;.

This maxim means that punitive or exemplary damages are generally not available in equity — at least historically. The U.S. Supreme Court reiterated this principle as a limit on restitution in &quot;Liu v. Securities and Exchange Commission&quot; (2020), citing the &quot;equitable principle that the wrongdoer should not be punished by ‘pay[ing] more than a fair compensation to the person wronged.’ &quot;Tilghman v. Proctor&quot;, 125 U.S. 136, 145–146 (1888).&quot;

Indeed, equity may step in to block contract terms that create penal damages. This also relates to the maxim that &quot;equity abhors a forfeiture&quot; (see below). However, in many jurisdictions equity will not block an &quot;in terrorem&quot; clause in a will (stating that beneficiaries who challenge the will forfeit whatever was left for them).

===Equity is a sort of equality===
&quot;Aequitas est quasi aequalitas&quot;
Where two persons have an equal right, the property will be divided equally. 

This maxim flows from the fundamental notion of equality or impartiality due to the conception of Equity and is the source of many equitable doctrines. The maxim is of very wide application. The rule of ordinary law may give one party an advantage over the other. But the court of equity, where it can, puts the litigating parties on a footing of equality. Equity proceeds in the principle that a right or liability should as far as possible be equalized among all interested.
In other words, two parties have equal right in any property, so it is distributed equally as per the concerned law.

===One who seeks equity must do equity===
To receive equitable relief, the petitioning party must be willing to complete all of its own obligations as well. The applicant to a court of equity is just as much subject to the power of that court as the defendant. This maxim may also overlap with the clean hands maxim (see below).

===Delay defeats Equity, or Equity aids the vigilant not the indolent===
&quot;Vigilantibus non dormientibus aequitas subvenit&quot;.

A person who has been wronged must act relatively swiftly to preserve their rights. Otherwise, they are guilty of laches, an untoward delay in litigation with the presumed intent of denying claims. This differs from a statute of limitations, in that a delay is particularized to individual situations, rather than a general prescribed legal amount of time. In addition, even where a limitation period has not yet run, laches may still occur. The equitable rule of laches and acquiescence was first introduced in &quot;Chief Young Dede v. African Association Ltd.&quot;

Alternatives:
*Delay defeats equity
*Equity aids the vigilant, not those who sleep on their rights

===Equity imputes an intention to fulfill an obligation===
Generally speaking, near performance of a general obligation will be treated as sufficient unless the law requires perfect performance, such as in the exercise of an option. Text writers give an example of a debtor leaving a legacy to his creditor equal to or greater than his obligation. Equity regards such a gift as performance of the obligation so the creditor cannot claim both the legacy and payment of the debt.

Where a claimant is under an obligation to do one thing but does another, his action may be treated as close enough approximation of the required act. A claimant who has undertaken an obligation, will, through his later conduct be interpreted as fulfilment of that obligation.

===Equity acts &quot;in personam&quot; (i.e. on persons rather than on objects)===
In England, there was a distinction drawn between the jurisdiction of the law courts and that of the chancery court. Courts of law had jurisdiction over property as well as persons and their coercive power arose out of their ability to adjust ownership rights. Courts of equity had power over persons. Their coercive power arose from the ability, on authority of the crown, to hold a violator in contempt, and take away his freedom (or money) until he purged himself of his contumacious behavior. This distinction helped preserve a separation of powers between the two courts.

Nevertheless, courts of equity also developed a doctrine that an applicant must assert a &quot;property interest&quot;. This was a limitation on their own power to issue relief. This does not mean that the courts of equity had taken jurisdiction over property. Rather, it means that they came to require that the applicant assert a right of some significant substance as opposed to a claim for relief based on an injury to mere emotional or dignitary interests.

===Equity abhors a forfeiture===
Today, a mortgagor refers to his interest in the property as his &quot;equity&quot;. The origin of the concept, however, was actually a mirror-image of the current practice.

At common law, a mortgage was a conveyance of the property, with a condition subsequent, that if the grantor paid the secured indebtedness to the grantee on or before a date certain (the &quot;law&quot; day) then the condition subsequent would be void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect. As was inevitable, debtors would be unable to pay on the law day, and if they tendered the debt after the time had passed, the creditor owed no duty to give the land back. So then the debtor would run to the court of equity, plead that there was an unconscionable forfeiture about to occur, and beg the court to grant an equitable decree requiring the lender to surrender the property upon payment of the secured debt with interest to date. And the equity courts granted these petitions quite regularly and often without regard for the amount of time that had lapsed since the law day had passed. The lender could interpose a defense of laches, saying that so much time had gone by (and so much improvement and betterment had taken place) that it would be inequitable to require undoing the finality of the mortgage conveyance. Other defenses, including equitable estoppel, were used to bar redemption as well.

This unsettling system had a negative impact on the willingness of lenders to accept real estate as collateral security for loans. Since a lender could not re-sell the property until it had been in uncontested possession for years, or unless it could show changed circumstances, the value of real estate collateral was significantly impaired. Impaired, that is, until lawyers concocted the bill of foreclosure, whereby a mortgagee could request a decree that unless the mortgagor paid the debt by a date certain (and after the law date set in the mortgage), the mortgagor would thereafter be barred and foreclosed of all right, title and equity of redemption in and to the mortgaged premises.

To complete the circle, one needs to understand that when a mortgagor fails to pay an installment when due, and the mortgagee accelerates the mortgage, requiring immediate repayment of the entire mortgage indebtedness, the mortgagor does not have a right to pay the past-due installment(s) and have the mortgage reinstated. In &quot;Graf v. Hope Building Corp.&quot;, the New York Court of Appeals observed that in such a case, there was no forfeiture, only the operation of a clause fair on its face, to which the mortgagor had freely assented. In the latter 20th Century, New York&#x27;s lower courts eroded the &quot;Graf&quot; doctrine to such a degree that it appears that it is no longer the law, and that a court of conscience has the power to mandate that a default be excused if it is equitable to do so. Of course, now that the pendulum is swinging in the opposite direction, we can expect courts to explain where the limits on the newly expanded equity of redemption lie...and it is probably not a coincidence that the cases that have eroded &quot;Graf v. Hope Building Corp.&quot; have been accompanied by the rise of arbitration as a means for enforcing mortgages.

===Equity does not require an idle gesture===
Also: Equity will not compel a court to do a vain and useless thing. It would be an idle gesture for the court to grant reformation of a contract and then to deny to the prevailing party an opportunity to perform it as modified.

===He who comes into equity must come with clean hands===
It is often stated that one who comes into equity must come with clean hands (or alternatively, equity will not permit a party to profit by his own wrong). In other words, if you ask for help about the actions of someone else but have acted wrongly, then you do not have clean hands and you may not receive the help you seek. For example, if you desire your tenant to vacate, you must have not violated the tenant&#x27;s rights.

However, the requirement of clean hands does not mean that a &quot;bad person&quot; cannot obtain the aid of equity. &quot;Equity does not demand that its suitors shall have led blameless lives.&quot; The defense of unclean hands only applies if there is a nexus between the applicant&#x27;s wrongful act and the rights he wishes to enforce.

In &quot;D &amp; C Builders Ltd v Rees&quot;, a small building firm did some work on the house of a couple named Rees. The bill came to £732, of which the Rees had already paid £250. When the builders asked for the balance of £482, the Rees announced that the work was defective, and they were only prepared to pay £300. As the builders were in serious financial difficulties (as the Rees knew), they reluctantly accepted the £300 &quot;in completion of the account&quot;. The decision to accept the money would not normally be binding in contract law, and afterwards the builders sued the Rees for the outstanding amount. The Rees claimed that the court should apply the doctrine of promissory estoppel, which can make promises binding even when unsupported by consideration. However, Lord Denning refused to apply the doctrine, on the grounds that the Rees had taken unfair advantage of the builders&#x27; financial difficulties, and therefore had not come &quot;with clean hands&quot;.

===Equity delights to do justice and not by halves===
When a court of equity is presented with a good claim to equitable relief, and it is clear that the plaintiff &quot;also&quot; sustained monetary damages, the court of equity has jurisdiction to render legal relief, e.g., monetary damages. Hence equity does not stop at granting equitable relief, but goes on to render a full and complete collection of remedies.

===Equity will take jurisdiction to avoid a multiplicity of suits===
Thus, &quot;where a court of equity has all the parties before it, it will adjudicate upon all of the rights of the parties connected with the subject matter of the action, so as to avoid a multiplicity of suits.&quot; This is the basis for the procedures of interpleader, class action, and the more rarely used Bill of Peace.

===Equity follows the law===
This maxim, also expressed as &quot;Aequitas sequitur legem&quot;, means more fully that &quot;equity will not allow a remedy that is contrary to law.&quot;

The Court of Chancery never claimed to override the courts of common law. Story states &quot;where a rule, either of the common or the statute law is direct, and governs the case with all its circumstances, or the particular point, a court of equity is as much bound by it as a court of law, and can as little justify a departure from it.&quot; According to Edmund Henry Turner Snell, &quot;It is only when there is some important circumstance disregarded by the common law rules that equity interferes.&quot; Cardozo wrote in his dissent in &quot;Graf v. Hope Building Corporation&quot;, 254 N.Y 1 at 9 (1930), &quot;Equity works as a supplement for law and does not supersede the prevailing law.&quot;

Maitland says, &quot;We ought not to think of common law and equity as of two rival systems.&quot; &quot;Equity had come not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it. Every jot and every tittle of law was to be obeyed, but when all this had been done yet something might be needful, something that equity would require.&quot; The goal of law and equity was the same but due to historical reasons they chose a different path. Equity respected every word of law and every right at law but where the law was defective, in those cases, equity provides equitable right and remedies.

In modern-day England and Wales, this maxim no longer applies; as per section 49(1) of the Senior Courts Act 1981, the law follows equity instead:

:Subject to the provisions of this or any other Act, every court exercising jurisdiction in England or Wales in any civil cause or matter shall continue to administer law and equity on the basis that, wherever there is any conflict or variance between the rules of equity and the rules of the common law with reference to the same matter, the rules of equity shall prevail.

===Equity will not assist a volunteer ===
A volunteer is defined in equity as one who has not offered consideration for a benefit they have received or expect to receive. For example, if a person A expects from past conversations and friendship to receive property under any will of person B, but person B dies before writing this into their will, person A, having not made any contribution to person B, will not be able to seek equity&#x27;s aid. 

This maxim is very important in restitution. Restitution developed as a series of writs called special assumpsit, which were later additions in the courts of law, and were more flexible tools of recovery, based on equity. Restitution could provide means of recovery when people bestowed benefits on one another (such as giving money or providing services) according to contracts that would have been legally unenforceable.

However, pursuant to the equitable maxim, restitution does not allow a volunteer or &quot;officious intermeddler&quot; to recover. 

Those successfully pleading benefit from an estoppel (promise relied on to their detriment) will not be considered volunteers for the purpose of this maxim.

===Equity will not complete an imperfect gift===
If a donor has failed to fulfil all the required legal formalities to effect a transfer, meaning the gift is an imperfect gift, equity will not act to provide assistance to the donee. This maxim is a subset of equity will not assist a volunteer.

However, there are certain relaxations to the maxim, including the rule of Re Rose of where the donor has &quot;done all in his power to divest himself of and to transfer&quot; the property, and the more recent but controversial use of unconscionability as a method of dispensing a formality requirement.

Note the exception in &quot;Strong v Bird&quot; (1874) LR 18 Eq 315. If the donor appoints the intended donee as executor of his/her will, and the donor subsequently dies, equity will perfect the imperfect gift.

===Where equities are equal, the law will prevail===
Equity will provide no specific remedies where the parties&#x27; causes are to be seen to be equal, or where neither has been wronged.

The significance of this maxim is that applicants to the chancellors often did so because of the formal pleading of the law courts, and the lack of flexibility they offered to litigants. Law courts and legislature, as lawmakers, through the limits of the substantive law they had created, thus inculcated a certain status quo that affected private conduct, and private ordering of disputes. Equity could alter that status quo, ignoring the clearly imposed limits of legal relief, or legal defences. But courts applying equity are reluctant to do so. This maxim reflects this. If the law firmly denied a cause of action or suggested equities between the parties were as a matter of policy equal, equity would provide no relief; if the law did provide relief, then the applicant would be obligated to bring a legal, rather than equitable action. This maxim overlaps with the previously mentioned &quot;equity follows the law.&quot;

===Equity will not allow a statute to be used as a cloak for fraud===
Equity prevents a party from relying upon a presence or absence of a statutory formality if to do so would be unconscionable and unfair. This can occur in secret trusts and constructive trusts.

===Equity will not allow a trust to fail for want of a trustee===
If there is no trustee, whoever has legal title to the trust property will be considered the trustee.

===Equity regards the beneficiary as the true owner===
Due to limits in old Common Law, no remedy was had for beneficiaries if, for example, a trustee ran off with the trust property. To remedy this and protect intended recipients of trust property, Equity regarded the beneficiary as the true (eventual) owners of the trust property.

===Between equal equities the first in order of time shall prevail===
Comparing timing with legal and equitable claims, &quot;[u]nder the common law, an earlier claim had priority over a later claim if both claims were legal claims . . . The same was true if both claims were equitable . . . [order in time] only mattered under the common law where [one party] had a legal claim and a competing earlier claim to the property was purely equitable.&quot;

<text>William Daniel &quot;Bill&quot; Sprouse Jr. (aka Willy Sprouse Jr., 12 December 1948 – 5 September 1975) was a Christian evangelist, singer and songwriter, and the musical force behind two groups (both called The Road Home) in the early 1970s. Bill recorded several songs for Maranatha! Music and traveled extensively sharing the Gospel through his music. He was severely overweight and died at age 26. Sprouse is best known for his songwriting, including &quot;Shotgun Angel&quot;, &quot;Since I Met Jesus&quot; and &quot;Psalm Five&quot;.

&quot;Since I Met Jesus&quot; first appeared on the compilation &quot;Maranatha 4&quot;, along with songs by such labelmates as Love Song and The Way. The track was later released on &quot;Best of Maranatha Vol. 1&quot;, &quot;Maranatha Country Roundup&quot;, &quot;Calvary Classics Vol. 1&quot;, &quot;Maranatha Collection Vol. 2&quot;, and &quot;Long Play Country Gospel&quot;. It was played on the influential country station KFAT in Gilroy, CA. &quot;Long Play Country Gospel&quot; also contains five other tracks written by Sprouse but performed by other artists, and is currently available on iTunes—the only Sprouse vocal performance currently in print.

Prior to joining Maranatha, Sprouse led a secular incarnation of The Road Home which played extensively in Orange County, California. They released an album on ABC/Dunhill Records titled &quot;Peaceful Children&quot; [DS 50104] in 1971. He is credited as &quot;Willy Sprouse Jr.&quot; on percussion, vocals, and keyboard. Their song &quot;Love&#x27;s Gonna Get You Anyway&quot; was supposedly sampled on the title track of DJ Krush&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Meiso&quot;, featuring Black Thought and Malik B. of The Roots.

<doc id="158934" wikidata="Q573565" url="?curid=158934" title="Catholic Church sexual abuse cases">
<text>There have been many cases of sexual abuse of children by priests, nuns, and other members of religious life in the Catholic Church. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the cases have involved many allegations, investigations, trials, convictions, acknowledgement and apologies by Church authorities, and revelations about decades of instances of abuse and attempts by Church officials to cover them up. The abused include mostly boys but also girls, some as young as three years old, with the majority between the ages of 11 and 14. Criminal cases for the most part do not cover sexual harassment of adults. The accusations of abuse and cover-ups began to receive public attention during the late 1980s. Many of these cases allege decades of abuse, frequently made by adults or older youths years after the abuse occurred. Cases have also been brought against members of the Catholic hierarchy who covered up sex abuse allegations and moved abusive priests to other parishes, where abuse continued.

By the 1990s, the cases began to receive significant media and public attention in several countries, including in Canada, United States, Chile, Australia, Ireland, and much of Europe and South America. Pope John Paul II was criticised by representatives of the victims of clergy sexual abuse for failing to respond quickly enough to the Catholic sex abuse crisis. After decades of inaction, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor brought the scandal to a head when she tore up a photo of John Paul II on a 1992 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The protest drew praise from critics of the church but also the ire of many Catholics, which greatly damaged her career and had a strong possibility of putting her life in danger. Her protest would see increased positive reappraisal as corruption and suppression efforts by the church related to abuse became more popularly known.

In 2002, an investigation by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, which later inspired the film &quot;Spotlight,&quot; led to widespread media coverage of the issue in the United States. Widespread abuse has also been exposed in Europe, Australia, and Chile, reflecting worldwide patterns of long-term abuse as well as the Church hierarchy&#x27;s pattern of regularly covering up reports of abuse.

From 2001 to 2010, the Holy See examined sex abuse cases involving about 3,000 priests, some of which dated back fifty years. Diocesan officials and academics knowledgeable about the Catholic Church say that sexual abuse by clergy is generally not discussed, and thus is difficult to measure. Members of the Church&#x27;s hierarchy have argued that media coverage was excessive and disproportionate, and that such abuse also takes place in other religions and institutions, a stance that dismayed representatives from other religions who saw it as a device to distance the Church from controversy.

In a 2001 apology, John Paul II called sexual abuse within the Church &quot;a profound contradiction of the teaching and witness of Jesus Christ&quot;. Benedict XVI apologised, met with victims, and spoke of his &quot;shame&quot; at the evil of abuse, calling for perpetrators to be brought to justice, and denouncing mishandling by church authorities. In January 2018, referring to a particular case in Chile, Pope Francis accused victims of fabricating allegations; by April, he was apologizing for his &quot;tragic error&quot;, and by August was expressing &quot;shame and sorrow&quot; for the tragic history. He convened a four-day summit meeting with the participation of the presidents of all the episcopal conferences of the world, which was held in Vatican City from 21 to 24 February 2019, to discuss preventing sexual abuse by Catholic Church clergy. In December 2019, Pope Francis made sweeping changes that allow for greater transparency. In June 2021, a team of U.N. special rapporteurs for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) criticized the Vatican, pointing to persistent allegations that the Catholic Church had obstructed and failed to cooperate with domestic judicial proceedings to prevent accountability for abusers and compensation for victims.

Some Christian media and institutions have alleged an anti-Catholic bias by the reporting media. A report issued by Christian Ministry Resources (CMR) in 2002 stated that contrary to popular opinion, most American churches being accused of child sexual abuse are Protestant, and that sexual violence is most often committed by volunteers rather than by priests themselves. The report also criticized the way the media reported sexual crimes, stating that the Australian media reported on sexual abuse allegations against Catholic clergy but ignored such allegations against Protestant churches. According to Thomas G. Plante, &quot;no evidence exists to suggest that Catholic priests sexually abuse children or minors in general in greater proportion to the general population of adult males or even male clergy from other religious traditions.&quot;

== International extent of abuse ==
Sexual abuse in the Catholic Church has been reported as far back as the 11th century, when Peter Damian wrote the treatise &quot;Liber Gomorrhianus&quot; against such abuses and others. In the late 15th century, Katharina von Zimmern and her sister were removed from their abbey to live in their family&#x27;s house for a while partly because the young girls were molested by priests. In 1531, Martin Luther claimed that Pope Leo X had vetoed a measure that cardinals should restrict the number of boys they kept for their pleasure, &quot;otherwise it would have been spread throughout the world how openly and shamelessly the Pope and the cardinals in Rome practice sodomy.&quot;

The sexual abuse of children below the age of consent by priests has received significant media and public attention in the United States, Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, Belgium, France, Germany, and Australia. Cases have also been reported in other nations throughout the world. Many of the cases span several decades and are brought forward years after the abuse occurred.

Although nationwide inquiries have been conducted only in the United States, Australia, and Ireland, cases of clerical sexual abuse of minors have been reported and prosecuted in New Zealand, Canada and other countries. In 1995, Austrian Cardinal Hans Hermann Groër resigned from his post as Archbishop of Vienna over allegations of sexual abuse, although he remained a Cardinal.

In Ireland, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse issued a report that covered six decades (from the 1950s). It noted &quot;endemic&quot; sexual abuse in Catholic boys&#x27; institutions, saying that church leaders were aware of abuses and that government inspectors failed to &quot;stop beatings, rapes and humiliation.&quot; The report noted the &quot;centrality of poverty and social vulnerability in the lives of the victims of abuse.&quot;

In Australia, according to Broken Rites, a support and advocacy group for church-related sex abuse victims, there have been over one hundred cases in which Catholic priests have been charged for child sex offenses. A 2012 police report claimed that 40 suicide deaths were directly related to abuse by Catholic clergy in the state of Victoria. In January 2013, an Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse was called to investigate institutional sexual abuse of minors related, but not exclusive, to matters concerning clergy of the Catholic Church.

Of the Catholic sexual abuse cases in Latin America, the most widely known is the sexual scandal of Father Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, a Roman Catholic congregation. The revelations took place after the Legion spent more than a decade denying allegations and criticizing the victims who claimed abuse.

In Tanzania, Father Kit Cunningham and three other priests were exposed as pedophiles after Cunningham&#x27;s death. The abuse took place in the 1960s but was only publicly revealed in 2011, largely through a BBC documentary.

Church officials and academics knowledgeable about the Third World Roman Catholic Church say that sexual abuse by clergy is generally not discussed, and thus is difficult to measure. This may be due in part to the more hierarchical structure of the Church in Third World countries, the &quot;psychological health&quot; of clergy in those regions, and because Third World media, legal systems and public culture are not as apt to thoroughly discuss sexual abuse. In the Philippines, where at least 85% of the population is Catholic, the revelations of sexual abuse by priests, including child sexual abuse, followed the United States&#x27; widespread reporting in 2002.

Academic Mathew N. Schmalz notes India as an example: &quot;you would have gossip and rumors, but it never reaches the level of formal charges or controversies.&quot; Traditionally, the Roman Catholic Church has held tight control over many aspects of church life around the globe, but it left sex abuse cases to be handled locally. In 2001, the church first required that sex abuse cases be reported to Rome. In July 2010, the Vatican doubled the length of time after the 18th birthday of the victim in which clergymen can be tried in a church court. It also streamlined the processes for removing abusive priests.

According to a 2004 research study by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, 4,392 Catholic priests and deacons in active ministry between 1950 and 2002 have been plausibly (neither withdrawn nor disproven) accused of underage sexual abuse by 10,667 individuals. Estimating the number of priests and deacons active in the same period at 110,000, the report concluded that approximately 4% have faced these allegations. The report noted that &quot;It is impossible to determine from our surveys what percent of all actual cases of abuse that occurred between 1950 and 2002 have been reported to the Church and are therefore in our dataset.&quot; The Augustin Cardinal Bea, S.J. specializes in abuse counseling and is considered an expert on clerical abuse; he states &quot;approximately 4% of priests during the past half century (and mostly in the 1960s and 1970s) have had a sexual experience with a minor.&quot; According to &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine, this figure is similar to the rate of frequency in the rest of the adult population.

In 2014, the Permanent Representative of the Holy See to the UN, Silvano Maria Tomasi, appeared before the Committee against Torture and reported that during the previous ten years, 3420 cases of abuse against minors had been investigated and 884 priests had been removed from their positions and reduced to lay status. Allegations of and convictions for sexual abuse by clergy have occurred in many countries. There are no accurate figures available on the number of sexual abuse cases in different regions. But, in 2002 &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported, &quot;clearly the issue has been most prominent in the United States.&quot; The US is the country with the highest number of reported Catholic sex abuse cases.

After the United States, the country with the next highest number of reported cases is Ireland. A significant number of cases have also been reported in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and countries in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia.

In response to the attention, members of the church hierarchy have argued that media coverage has been unfair, excessive, and disproportionate. According to a Pew Research Center study, in 2002 the media coverage was focused on the US, where a series in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; initiated widespread coverage in the region. However, by 2010 the focus had shifted to Europe.

In September 2011, a submission was lodged with the International Criminal Court alleging that the Pope, Cardinal Angelo Sodano (Dean of the College of Cardinals), Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone (Cardinal Secretary of State), and Cardinal William Levada (then-current Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith) had committed a crime against humanity by failing to prevent or punish perpetrators of rape and sexual violence in a &quot;systematic and widespread&quot; concealment which included failure to co-operate with relevant law enforcement agencies. In a statement to the Associated Press, the Vatican described this as a &quot;ludicrous publicity stunt and a misuse of international judicial processes.&quot; Lawyers and law professors emphasized that the case is likely to fall outside the court&#x27;s jurisdiction.

In 1996, Philip Jenkins, professor at the Department of Religion and History at Penn State University, questioned the theses of increased sexual abuse among priests, saying the percentage of priests accused of molesting minors is 1.8%, much of which is not about pedophilia alone.

On 13 May 2017, the 100th anniversary of the apparition of Mary at Fatima, where three little children were supposedly shown a vision of Hell and told that &quot;The sins which cause most souls to go to hell are the sins of the flesh,&quot; Pope Francis acknowledged that the Vatican had a backlog of 2000 sex abuse cases.

== Major cases ==
In the late 1940s, the American priest Gerald Fitzgerald founded the Congregation of the Servants of the Paraclete, a religious order that treats Roman Catholic priests who struggle with personal difficulties such as substance abuse and sexual misconduct. In a series of letters and reports to high-ranking Catholic leaders starting in the 1950s, Fitzgerald warned of substantial problems with abusive priests. He wrote, for example, &quot;[sexual abuse] offenders were unlikely to change and should not be returned to ministry.&quot; He discussed the problem with Pope Paul VI (1963–1978) and &quot;in correspondence with several bishops&quot;.

In 2001, the Vatican first required that sex abuse cases be reported to the Vatican hierarchy; before that, it left management of the cases to local dioceses. After the 2002 revelation by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; that cases of abuse were widespread in the Church in Massachusetts and elsewhere, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; did a year-long investigation. It reported in 2004 that even after these revelations and public outcry, the institutional church had moved allegedly abusive priests out of the countries where they had been accused but assigned them again to &quot;settings that bring them into contact with children, despite church claims to the contrary&quot;. Among the investigation&#x27;s findings was that nearly half of 200 cases &quot;involved clergy who tried to elude law enforcement.&quot;

The cases received significant media and public attention in the United States, Ireland where abuse was reported as widespread, Canada, and throughout the world. In response to the attention, members of the church hierarchy have argued that media coverage has been excessive and disproportionate. According to a Pew Research Center study, media coverage was generated mostly in the United States, beginning in 2002, with a series in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; that published hundreds of news reports. By contrast, in 2010 much of the reporting focused on child abuse in Europe.

=== Americas ===

==== Central America ====

=====Costa Rica=====

Different scandals of sexual abuse involving members of the Catholic clergy have been made public in Costa Rica, as more than ten priests have been formally accused. However, one of the most recent and most dramatic events due to its media exposure occurred in 2019 when judicial accusations against the priests Mauricio Víquez and Manuel Guevara led to the search and seizure of the Episcopal Conference by the Judicial Investigation Department on 7 March 2019. Víquez, who was the Episcopal Conference&#x27;s spokesman and professor at the University of Costa Rica, was dismissed from the clerical state by the Holy See and the process for removal of his university tenure was started. He fled in January 2019 and was a fugitive overseas reason for which an international arrest warrant was issued against him. He was captured in Mexico in August 2019 and condemned in 2022 to 20 years in prison for rape and abuse of an 11-year-old boy. In the case of Guevara, parish priest of Santo Domingo de Heredia, was arrested by the authorities.

Another priest wanted for sexual abuse, Jorge Arturo Morales Salazar, was arrested by the authorities while trying to escape through the Panama border and held on preventive custody. Other notable cases are Father Enrique Delgado, popular figure due to his TV show &quot;La Hora Santa&quot; (The Holy Hour) who was sentenced to prison for rape and sexual abuse against three minors, Father Enrique Vazquez who escaped the country in 1998 apparently with financial help from San Carlos&#x27; bishop Angel Sancasimiro, was captured serving as a priest in Honduras in 2007, but the charges couldn&#x27;t be pressed due to the age difference of less than 28 years between the victims of 13–16 years and the perpetrator of 20 years, and Father Minor Calvo, another TV personality with his TV show &quot;An encounter with Christ&quot; and as director of the Catholic radio station Radio maria who was found in a car with a teenager in the La Sabana Park at midnight. Although Calvo was convicted for corruption and embezzlement he was not convicted for sexual abuse.

=====Dominican Republic=====
Józef Wesołowski, a Polish citizen who had been a nuncio (papal ambassador), was laicized in 2014 because of accusations of sexual abuse of minors during the five years he served as Vatican ambassador in Santo Domingo. The Holy See refused to waive his diplomatic immunity to allow him to be judged in Santo Domingo, but charged him before the Vatican criminal tribunal. However, in July 2015 the trial was postponed due to Wesolowski&#x27;s ill health; he died on 27 August 2015 before a trial could be held.

=====El Salvador=====

In November 2015, in El Salvador&#x27;s sole non-military Catholic diocese, the Archdiocese of San Salvador, Fr. Jesus Delgado, biographer and personal secretary to Archbishop Oscar Romero was dismissed by the Archdiocese after investigations revealed that he had molested a girl, now 42 years of age, when she was between the ages of 9 and 17. Due to the statute of limitations, Delgado could not face criminal charges. In December 2016, a canonical court convicted Delgado and two other El Salvador priests, Francisco Galvez and Antonio Molina, of committing acts of sex abuse between the years 1980 and 2000 and laicized them from the priesthood.

In November 2019, the Archdiocese acknowledged sex abuse committed by Fr. Leopoldo Sosa Tolentino in 1994 and issued a public apology to his victim. Tolentino was suspended from ministry and began the canonical trial process. Another El Salvador priest, José Adonay Chicas Campos, was laicized in 2019 after pleading guilty to sex abuse in a criminal trial at the Vatican and sentenced to 16 years in prison.

=====Honduras=====

In 2018 Pope Francis accepted the resignation of auxiliary bishop Juan José Pineda, a close aide of Cardinal Maradiaga, following revelations of sexual abuse of the seminarians and financial scandal.

==== North America ====

=====Canada=====

In the late 1980s, allegations were made of physical and sexual abuse committed by members of the Christian Brothers, who operated the Mount Cashel Orphanage in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. The government, police, and church had colluded in an attempt to cover up the allegations, but in December 1989 they were reported in the &quot;St. John&#x27;s Sunday Express&quot;. Eventually more than 300 former pupils came forward with allegations of physical and sexual abuse at the orphanage. The religious order that ran the orphanage filed for bankruptcy in the face of numerous civil lawsuits seeking damages. Since the Mount Cashel scandal, a number of priests across Canada have been accused of sexual abuse.

In August 2005, Father Charles Henry Sylvestre of Belle River, Ontario, pleaded guilty to 47 counts of sexual abuse of females, aged between nine and fourteen years old, between 1952 and 1989. Sylvestre was given a sentence in October 2006 of three years, and died 22 January 2007 after three months in prison.

In 2011, Basilian priest Father William Hodgson Marshall, who died in 2014 at the age of 92, pled guilty to 16 counts of indecent assault of minors and one count of sexual assault for incidents that occurred between 1952 and 1986 when he taught at Assumption and Holy Names high schools in Windsor, plus other Catholic high schools in Toronto and Sudbury. He was sentenced to two years in prison, and served 16 months of his sentence before being released on probation in 2012. However, Marshall, who was given the nickname &quot;Happy Hands&quot; in the 1950s due to his tendency to touch students, later pled guilty to more sex abuse charges stemming from his time in Saskatchewan. On 30 April 2020, the Canadian Supreme Court rejected an appeal from the Basilian Fathers of Toronto to not give Marshall victim Rod MacLeod a required payment of just over $2.5 million, including $500,000 in punitive damages, stemming from a sexual-assault case in the 1960s. The payment was first ordered by a jury in April 2018.

On 25 August 2020, British Columbia justice David Crossin ordered the office of the Bishop of Kamloops and retired priest Erlindo Molon, who was by then 88 years old, to pay $844,140 in damages to Rosemary Anderson, who claimed Molon raped her 70 to 100 times in 1976 and 1977, beginning when she was 26 years old. Anderson claimed Molon offered her counselling to help her deal with her father&#x27;s death. During the lawsuit, former Kamloops bishop, and future Vancouver Archbishop, Adam Exner now 90, conceded on the stand that Molon &quot;was molesting people&quot;, including Anderson. Exner also stated that Molon was not stripped of his priesthood status until after Anderson told him that Molon raped her and suggested that she marry him.

By 1912, thousands of First Nations children attended residential schools, many of which were run by the Catholic Church. In 1990, Manitoba leader Phil Fontaine revealed that he had been sexually and physically abused in a Catholic residential school. He claimed that sexual abuse was common in residential schools in general. &quot;In my grade three class, if there were 20 boys, every single one of them would have experienced what I experienced. They would have experienced some aspect of sexual abuse.&quot;
Canadian author and artist, Michael D. O&#x27;Brien, has also spoken out about his painful experiences of residential school abuse, revealing that &quot;the sexual exploitation of the young has been epidemic in Catholic residential schools and orphanages.&quot;

===== Mexico =====
Of the Catholic sexual abuse cases in Latin America, the most widely known is the scandal of Father Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, a Roman Catholic congregation in 1970s. He had been sexually abusing at least 60 minors and fathered six children with three women. The revelations took place in 1998 after the Legion spent more than a decade denying allegations and criticizing the victims who claimed abuse. He was forced to retire from the ministry by Pope Benedict XVI in 2006.

Luis Esteban Zavala Rodríguez, a priest in Irapuato, was condemned to 65 years and three months in prison and fined MXN $61,000 in January 2021 for raping a 12-year-old girl as she took catechism classes at a church in the city.

===== United States =====
The United States has been the focus of many scandals and subsequent reforms. BishopAccountability.org, an &quot;online archive established by lay Catholics&quot;, have reported over 3,000 civil lawsuits against the church, some of these cases have resulted in multimillion-dollar settlements with many claimants, totaling more than $3 billion since 1950.

While the church in the United States claims to have addressed the issue, some disagree. Mark Honigsbaum of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote in 2006 that, &quot;despite the National Review Board&#x27;s own estimates that there have been some 5,000 abusive priests in the US, to date 150 have been successfully prosecuted.&quot; Some critics of the church, such as Patrick Wall, attribute this to a lack of cooperation from the church. In California, for example, the archdiocese has sought to block the disclosure of confidential counseling records on two priests, arguing that such action would violate their First Amendment right on religious protection. Paul Lakeland claims Church leaders who enabled abuse were too frequently careless about their own accountability and the accountability of perpetrators.

In 2004, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange settled nearly 90 cases for $100 million. In July 2007, its parent archdiocese, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles reached a settlement of 45 lawsuits for $60 million. By July 2007, a $660 million agreement was made with more than 500 alleged victims.

In September 2007, the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego reached a $198.1 million &quot;agreement with 144 childhood sexual abuse victims&quot;.

In July 2008, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Denver agreed &quot;to pay $5.5 million to settle 18 claims of childhood sexual abuse.&quot;

In 1998, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas paid $30.9 million to twelve victims of one priest ($ in present-day terms). From 2003 to 2009, nine other major settlements, involving over 375 cases with 1551 claimants/victims, resulted in payments of over US$1.1 billion. The Associated Press estimated the settlements of sex abuse cases from 1950 to 2007 totaled more than $2 billion. Addressing &quot;a flood of abuse claims&quot; five dioceses (Tucson, Arizona; Spokane, Washington; Portland, Oregon; Davenport, Iowa, and San Diego) got bankruptcy protection. Eight Catholic dioceses have declared bankruptcy due to sex abuse cases from 2004 to 2011.

Although bishops had been sending sexually abusive priests to facilities such as those operated by the Servants of the Paraclete since the 1950s, there was scant public discussion of the problem until the mid-1960s. Even then, most of the discussion was held among the Catholic hierarchy with little or no coverage in the media. A public discussion of sexual abuse of minors by priests took place at a meeting sponsored by the National Association for Pastoral Renewal held on the campus of the University of Notre Dame in 1967, to which all U.S. Catholic bishops were invited.

Various local and regional discussions of the problem were held by Catholic bishops in later years. However, it was not until the 1980s that discussion of sexual abuse by Roman Catholic clerics began to be covered as a phenomenon in the news media of the United States. According to the Catholic News Service, public awareness of the sexual abuse of children in the United States and Canada emerged in the late 1970s and the 1980s as an outgrowth of the growing awareness of physical abuse of children in society.

In September 1983, the&quot; National Catholic Reporter &quot;published an article on the topic. The subject gained wider national notoriety in October 1985 when Louisiana priest Gilbert Gauthe pleaded guilty to 11 counts of molestation of boys. After the coverage of Gauthe&#x27;s crimes subsided, the issue faded to the fringes of public attention until the mid-1990s, when the issue was again brought to national attention after a number of books on the topic were published.

In 2002, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;″s Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of sexual abuse cases involving Catholic priests drew the attention, first of the United States and ultimately the world, to the problem. Other victims began to come forward with their own allegations of abuse, resulting in more lawsuits and criminal cases. Since then, the problem of clerical abuse of minors has received significantly more attention from the Church hierarchy, law enforcement agencies, government and the news media. One study shows that the Boston Globe coverage of the cases &quot;had a negative and long-lasting effect&quot; on Catholic school enrollment, and explained &quot;about two-thirds of the decline in Catholic schooling.&quot;

In 2003, Archbishop Timothy M. Dolan of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee authorized payments of as much as US$20,000 to sexually abusive priests to convince them to leave the priesthood.

In July 2003, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Louisville paid $25.7 million to &quot;settle child sexual-abuse allegations made in 240 lawsuits naming 34 priests and other church workers.&quot; In 2003, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston also settled a large case for $85 million with 552 alleged victims. In 2004, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange settled nearly 90 cases for $100 million.

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas paid $30.9 million in 1998 to twelve victims of one priest ($ in present-day terms).

In April 2007, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon agreed to a $75 million settlement with 177 claimants and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle agreed to a $48 million settlement with more than 160 victims. In July 2007, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles reached a $660 million agreement with more than 500 alleged victims, in December 2006, the archdiocese had a settlement of 45 lawsuits for $60 million.

As recently as 2011, Fr Curtis Wehmeyer was allowed to work as a priest in Minnesota despite many people having reported concern about his sexual compulsion and suspicious behavior with boys. Wehmeyer was employed as a priest without proper background checks. Wehmeyer was later convicted of sexually abusing two boys. After Wehmeyer&#x27;s arrest there were complaints the responsible clergy were more concerned with how to spin the story in a favorable light than in helping victims.

In July 2018, Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C. resigned from the College of Cardinals (the first Cardinal to do so since 1927) following allegations of abuse and attempted homosexual rape at a seaside villa. In August, a &quot;systematic coverup&quot; of sex abuse by more than 300 priests in Pennsylvania parishes was revealed. Reviewers of the situation indicated that many more victims and perpetrators were likely undiscovered. In March 2018, Archbishop Anthony Apuron of Guam was removed from office by the Vatican. Apuron had been accused of sexually molesting altar boys in the late 1970s. Moreover, in the latest case, priest Louis Brouillard was charged for having raped altar boys during &quot;sleepovers&quot; as a teenager. Over fifteen priests, two archbishops, and a bishop have been recognized in sex abuse cases, from the 1950s until the 1990s.

Addressing &quot;a flood of abuse claims&quot; five dioceses (Tucson, Arizona; Spokane, Washington; Portland, Oregon.; Davenport, Iowa, and San Diego) got bankruptcy protection. Eight Catholic dioceses declared bankruptcy due to sex abuse cases from 2004 to 2011.

On January 19, 2023, a man named Scott Verti filed a lawsuit alleging about 100 instances of abuse at St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Church in Fort Collins, Colorado, from 1998 to 2003. Due to the 2021 state law in Colorado, a three-year window period was opened to allow sexual allegations to be brought forward dating back as far as 1960. The defendant Timothy Evans, a priest was accused of sexual abuse when Verti was 13 to 18 years old.

====== &quot;Jay Report&quot; ======
In the United States, the 2004 &quot;John Jay Report,&quot; commissioned from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and funded by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), was based on volunteer surveys completed by the Roman Catholic dioceses in the United States. The 2004 &quot;John Jay Report&quot; was based on a study of 10,667 allegations against 4,392 priests accused of engaging in sexual abuse of a minor between 1950 and 2002.

====== Withholding names of accused clergy ======
On 29 December 2019, it was revealed that numerous bishops across the United States withheld hundreds of names from their accused clergy list.

====== Allowing accused clergy to leave country ======
On 6 March 2020, a joint investigation conducted by ProPublica and the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; was published which revealed that the Catholic Church transferred more than 50 credibly accused U.S. Catholic clergy to other countries after sex abuse accusations surfaced against them.

===== Vatican report on Theodore McCarrick =====
The &quot;Report on the Holy See&#x27;s institutional knowledge and decision-making related to former Cardinal Theodore Edgar McCarrick (from 1930 to 2017)&quot;, the Holy See&#x27;s Secretariat of State&#x27;s report published in November 2020, stated that Pope John Paul II was made aware of allegations against McCarrick but did not believe them, and that Benedict XVI, after receiving further complaints, also made little effort to stop McCarrick. The report absolved Pope Francis, but placed blame on both Pope John Paul II and Benedict XVI for Theodore McCarrick&#x27;s rise in power they both were aware of sexual abuse allegations against him.

==== South America ====

===== Argentina =====
In 2009, priest Julio César Grassi was sentenced to 15 years in prison for two counts of sexual abuse against two minors during his time at a foundation for children in need.

On 17 August 2019, Argentina Bishop Sergio Buenanueva of San Francisco, Cordoba, acknowledged the history of sex abuse within the Catholic Church in Argentina. Buenanueva, who was labeled as a &quot;Prelate&quot; for the Argentine Catholic Church, also stated that the church&#x27;s sex abuse crisis in Argentina, which is Pope Francis&#x27; native country, was &quot;just beginning&quot;.

A three-judge court cleared former priest Carlos Eduardo José, 62, of sexual abuse charges from 1999 to 2008 in Caseros, Buenos Aires because the statute of limitations had expired by March 9, 2021. The accusations date from 2009 but the church took no action until 2019. Three other complaints against the same priest by other students were earlier dismissed by other courts on statute of limitations grounds.

===== Bolivia =====
A priest in Bolivia was arrested after being accused of sexually assaulting students at a seminary in 2013. The arrest comes following a scandal where former priest Alfonso Pedrajas confessed to having abused 85 children in Bolivia during the 1970s and 1980s in his personal diary prior to his death of cancer in 2009.

In 2023, the Pope sent Monsignor Jordi Bertomeu to Bolivia to investigate the matter. Bertomeu had previously investigated accusations against priests in Chile in 2018.

===== Chile =====

Early in 2018, Pope Francis met with Bishop Juan Barros from Chile concerning the charges of sexual abuse by Fr. Fernando Karadima, and accusations of cover-up by Barros. Many laypersons and victims of sexual abuse came forward to condemn Barros for covering up the sex crimes. When Pope Francis visited the bishop, he was asked by local reporters about the sexual abuse scandal surrounding Barros. Pope Francis quickly condemned the charges a &quot;slander&quot;, stating, &quot;The day they bring me proof against Bishop Barros, I will speak. There is not one piece of evidence against him. It is calumny. Is that clear?&quot;
Following the pope&#x27;s defense of Barros, Boston Cardinal Sean Patrick O&#x27;Malley, a key Vatican advisor on clergy abuse, acknowledged that Francis&#x27; comments about Barros were &quot;a source of great pain&quot; for victims. Francis then appointed Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta to investigate the allegations of abuse in the Chilean church. Upon receiving Scicluna&#x27;s report, Francis wrote on 12 April that he had &quot;made serious mistakes in the assessment and perception of the situation, especially because of a lack of truthful and balanced information&quot;. He also declared that the Chilean church hierarchy was collectively responsible for &quot;grave defects&quot; in handling sexual abuse cases and the resulting loss of credibility suffered by the church. Following Francis&#x27; remarks, 33 Chilean bishops offered their resignation. Pope Francis later apologized to the victims of the sex abuse scandal. In late April 2018, three victims were invited to the Vatican.

On 11 June 2018, Francis accepted the resignations of Bishop Juan Barros Madrid of Osorno, and on 28 June those of Bishops Horacio Valenzuela of Talca and Alejandro Goić Karmelić of Rancagua. In September, he accepted those of those of Carlos Eduardo Pellegrín Barrera of Chillán and Cristián Contreras Molina of San Felipe.
Karadima was laicized on 28 September 2018.

On 13 October 2018, Pope Francis laicized two former archbishops: Francisco José Cox Huneeus of La Serena and Marco Antonio Órdenes Fernández of Iquique.

In March 2019, Cardinal Ricardo Ezzati Andrello resigned as required upon turning 75 amid allegations of sexual abuse.

On 21 August 2019, Chile&#x27;s nuncio announced that the Vatican had launched an investigation into claims that Bernardino Piñera, an influential Chilean priest who is also a paternal uncle of Chilean President Sebastian Piñera, sexually abused at least one child 50 years prior.

===== Colombia =====

In 2021, an investigation by Vorágine and CONNECTAS revealed a list of 43 priests from the Archdiocese of Medellín accused of child molestation and sexual abuse, only three of whom had been sentenced by justice. In 2022, the AFP news agency reported one of the most serious cases revealed to date in the country, involving a network of pederasty that would include at least 38 abusive priests in the city of Villavicencio, of which 19 of them had been suspended two years before by the Vatican in the midst of the canonical investigation. The Constitutional Court in a historic decision had ordered in Judgment T-091 of 2020 the Colombian Catholic Church to reveal its &quot;secret file&quot; of complaints, to journalists or citizens who required it. From that date the hierarchs of the church have not fully complied with that instruction.

=== Asia ===

==== East Timor ====
Richard Daschbach was convicted in Oecussi District Court in 2021 on charges of having sexually abused Timorese girls over decades.

First accusations of sexual abuse of minors by Bishop Ximenes Belo appeared in the Dutch magazine &quot;De Groene Amsterdammer&quot; on 28 September 2022.

==== India ====
In 2002, Mathew N. Schmalz noted that Catholic Church sexual abuse cases in India are generally not spoken about openly, stating &quot;you would have gossip and rumors, but it never reaches the level of formal charges or controversies.&quot;

In 2014, Raju Kokkan, the vicar of the Saint Paul&#x27;s Church in Thaikkattussery, Thrissur, Kerala, was arrested on charges of raping a nine-year-old girl. According to Kerala Police, Kokkan had raped the child on several different occasions, including at least thrice in his office during the month of April. Kokkan promised to gift the child expensive vestments for her Holy Communion ceremony before sexually assaulting her. The abuse was revealed after the victim informed her parents that she had been raped by Kokkan on 25 April 2014. The priest subsequently fled to Nagercoil in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu, and was arrested by police on 5 May. Following the arrest, the Thrissur Archdiocese stated that the vicar had been removed from his position within the Church. Between February and April 2014, three other Catholic priests were arrested in the state of Kerala on charges of raping minors.

In 2016, the Catholic Church reappointed a convicted and jailed priest in the Ootacamund Diocese in Tamil Nadu, with little regard for victims rights and children&#x27;s safety.

In 2017, Father Robin Vadakkumchery of St Sebastian church in Kannur was arrested in Kochi on the charge of repeatedly raping a 15-year-old girl who later gave birth to a child. The baby is reported to have been taken to an orphanage without the mother&#x27;s consent. He has been sentenced to 20 years in prison by a special court constituted under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 in Thalassery.

In 2018, after much public outcry, Bishop Franco Mulakkal was arrested on 21 September by the Kerala Police. The Vatican had just &#x27;temporarily&#x27; relieved him from his pastoral responsibilities. The nun who complained against Bishop Mulakkal had mentioned to the police that he had repeatedly had raped her on multiple occasions between 2014 and 2016. Mulakkal was found not guilty by a Kerala trial court in 2022, though a challenge to the acquittal was filed by the nun&#x27;s lawyers in 2023. After the challenge was filed, Mulakkal retired as bishop in June 2023.

====Singapore====
In 2013, Singapore-born psychotherapist and author Jane Leigh, a single mother of two who now lives in Melbourne, alleged in her autobiography &quot;My Nine Lives Last&quot; that she was sexually abused by Roman Catholic priests when she was a teenager. Starting from when she was 12 years old, she was abused for two and half years during the secluded one-on-one outings by a 34-year-old priest whom she initially met at neighbourhood mass held at her home when she was 12, he allegedly did so while picking or dropping her off when her parents were at work. After she reported the matter to her mother, she was berated for tempting the priest and sent to another Catholic priest for counselling. Consequently, church stated that they will conduct the investigations.

In 2022, a prominent member of the Catholic order in his mid-60s was jailed 5 years for sexually abusing 2 teenage boys on multiple occasions. The offences took place between 2005 and 2007. The identity of the perpetrator and his victims were not revealed due to a gag order imposed by the court. Additionally, the perpetrator&#x27;s religious superior was issued a written advisory by the police for not reporting the offences to the police after learning about them.

=== Europe ===

==== Austria ====

In November 2010, an independent group in Austria that operates a hotline to help people exit the Catholic Church released a report documenting physical, sexual, and emotional abuse perpetrated by Austrian priests, nuns, and religious officials. The report is based on hotline calls from 91 women (28%) and 234 men (72%), who named 422 perpetrators of both sexes, 63% of whom were ordained priests.

====Belgium====
In June 2010, Belgian police raided the Belgian Catholic Church headquarters in Brussels, seizing a computer and records of a Church commission investigating allegations of child abuse. This was part of an investigation into hundreds of claims that had been raised about alleged child sexual abuse committed by Belgian clergy. The claims emerged after Roger Vangheluwe, who had been the Bishop of Bruges, resigned in 2009 after admitting that he was guilty of sexual molestation. The Vatican protested against the raids. In September 2010, an appeals court ruled that the raids were illegal.

==== Croatia ====
There are three main known contemporary cases of sexual abuse in the Croatian Catholic Churches: in Archdiocese of Zagreb, Archdiocese of Rijeka and Archdiocese of Zadar. The convicted individuals are Ivan Čuček (2000), Drago Ljubičić (2011), and Nediljko Ivanov (2012) respectively.

====France====

Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, the Archbishop of Lyon, was convicted on 7 March 2019 of failing to report sex abuse allegedly committed by priest Bernard Preynat and was given a six-month suspended prison sentence. On 5 July 2019, Pope Francis laicized the priest whom Barbarin was accused of protecting. Despite Barbarin&#x27;s conviction being overturned on appeal, the scandal resulted in Pope Francis accepting his resignation as Archbishop of Lyon on 6 March 2020.

On 14 January 2020, Preynat, who was previously convicted on another sex abuse charge in 2016, confessed during his criminal trial that he had a habit of &quot;caressing&quot; Boy Scouts he oversaw when he served as scout chaplain in the Lyon suburb of Sainte-Foy-lès-Lyon and that he did so in a way which brought him &quot;sexual pleasure&quot;. On 15 January, Preynat, who is accused of molesting 80 Boy Scouts between 1971 and 1991, stated that the Vatican let him complete his seminary education for becoming a priest after he had undergone therapy at the Vinatier Psychiatric Hospital between 1967 and 1968, and that he had warned that Vatican about his sexual impulses. After Preynat&#x27;s 2016 conviction for abuse committed between 1986 and 1991, which also resulted in only an 18-month suspended prison sentence, Barbarin reportedly appointed him to a higher position within the Archdiocese of Lyon.

On 9 November 2019, the Conference of French Bishops approved a resolution agreeing that every French Catholic Bishop would pay compensation for abuse which took place in the French Catholic Church. On 16 March 2020, Preynat received a five-year prison sentence after being convicted of sexually assaulting boy scouts. On 11 November 2020, Jean-Marc Sauve, the head of the independent commission set up by the Catholic Church in France to investigate claims of sex abuse, acknowledged his commission&#x27;s sex abuse hotline, which closed on 31 October 2020, received 6,500 calls reporting sex 
abuse in a period of 17 months. On 16 December 2020, former Apostolic nuncio to France Luigi Ventura received a suspended eight-month prison sentence for sexually harassment, which includes probation and a required payment of €13,000 to the victims, as well as €9,000 in legal fees.

On 3 October 2021, an independent commission set up by the Bishops&#x27; Conference of France released a report estimating that the ranks of the 115,000 Catholic priests and other religious officials in France since the 1950s have included about 3,000 abusers. The report estimates that 216,000 children were abused by Catholic priests between 1950 and 2020, and that accounting for abuse by other Catholic church employees increases the total number to around 330,000. Around 80% of the victims were boys.

====Germany====

In September 2018, a report by the German Catholic Church found that 3,677 children in Germany, mostly 13 or younger, had been sexually abused by Catholic clergy between 1946 and 2014. In August 2020, at 1,412 people in Germany accused members of Catholic religious orders of sexually abusing them as children, teenagers, and as wards. At least 654 monks, nuns and other members of religious orders were accused of abuse. Around 80% of the victims were male and 20% female. The orders were among the last Catholic church organizations in Germany to address sex abuse. Despite the facts that women make up the largest membership of German religious orders, male religious order members had the largest share of sex abuse accusations.

In May 2021, Cardinal Reinhard Marx offered his resignation, citing collective failure in dealing with sexual abuse as his main reason. Subsequently, Pope Francis denied his offer, while emphasizing the importance of Marx&#x27;s repentance in his subsequent tenure.

====Ireland====

In the Republic of Ireland, starting in the 1990s, there were a series of criminal cases and government enquiries related to allegations that priests had abused hundreds of minors over previous decades. State-ordered investigations documented &quot;tens of thousands of children from the 1940s to the 1990s&quot; who suffered abuse, including sexual abuse at the hands of priests, nuns, and church staff in three dioceses.

In many cases, senior clergy had moved priests accused of abuse to other parishes. By 2010, a number of in-depth judicial reports had been published, but with relatively few prosecutions. The abuse was occasionally made known to staff at the Department of Education, the police, and other government bodies. They have said that prosecuting clergy was extremely difficult given the &quot;Catholic ethos&quot; of the Irish Republic. In addition, in 2004, the Christian Brothers had sued for a civil settlement that barred prosecution of any of its members or the naming of any Christian Brother in the government investigatory report. Christian Brothers had a higher number of allegations made against their order than were made against others. Neither were any victims named in the report.

In 1994, Micheal Ledwith resigned as President of St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth when allegations of sexual abuse by him were made public. The June 2005 &quot;McCullough Report&quot; found that a number of bishops had rejected concerns about Ledwith&#x27;s inappropriate behavior towards seminarians &quot;so completely and so abruptly without any adequate investigation&quot;, although his report conceded that &quot;to investigate in any very full or substantial manner, a generic complaint regarding a person&#x27;s apparent propensities would have been difficult&quot;.

Fr Brendan Smyth was reported to have sexually abused and indecently assaulted 20 children in parishes in Belfast, Dublin and the United States, during the period between 1945 and 1989. Controversy over the handling of his extradition to Northern Ireland led to the 1994 collapse of the Fianna Fáil/Labour coalition government.

In December 2010, Archdiocese of Dublin &quot;singing priest&quot; Tony Walsh was sentenced to 123 years in prison for 14 child abuse convictions involving sex-related offences dating from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s. However, the sentences were to be served concurrently, netting to a maximum of 16 years. By the time he pleaded guilty in December 2018 to indecently assaulting a teenage boy with a crucifix on a date in 1983, Walsh had already been in prison for 13 years.

Six reports by the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church have up until 2011 established that six Irish priests were convicted between 1975 and 2011.

In August 2018, a list was published which revealed that over 1,300 Catholic clergy in Ireland had been accused of sexual abuse, of which 82 had been convicted. In May 2020, it was revealed that prior to the 2004 merger with the Scout Association of Ireland (SAI) which formed Scouting Ireland, Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland (CBSI) covered up sex abuse committed by people who served in the organization. In a period spanning decades, both the CBSI and SAI shielded 275 known or suspected predators who abused children after becoming aware of the reported acts of abuse. Scouting Ireland backed the findings of the report and issued an apology.

====Italy====

In October 2018, Italian victim rights group &quot;Rete l&#x27;Abuso&quot; released a statement saying that since 2000 the Italian justice system had handled about 300 cases of abusive priests and nuns, with 150 to 170 convictions.

====Norway====
After revelations by Norwegian newspaper &quot;Adresseavisen,&quot; the Catholic Church in Norway and the Vatican acknowledged in 2010 that Georg Müller had resigned in July 2009 from the position of Bishop of Trondheim which he held from 1997 because of the discovery of his abuse of an altar boy two decades earlier. The Vatican cited Canon law 401 §2, but as is customary gave no details. The Norwegian Catholic Church was made aware of the incident at the time but did not alert the authorities. Norwegian law did not allow a criminal prosecution of Müller so long after the event.

====Poland====

During 2013, the public in this deeply Catholic country became concerned about reports of child sex abuse scandals within the Church, some of which reached the courts, and the poor response by the church. The Church resisted demands to pay compensation to victims.
In October 2013, the Catholic Church in Poland explicitly refused to publish data on sexual abuse, but said that, &quot;if the data were to be published, the scale would be seen to be very low&quot;. Bishop Antoni Dydycz said that priests should not be pressed to report sexual abuse to state authorities, invoking the ecclesiastical &quot;seal of confession&quot;, which bans them from revealing what is said in the rite of confession.

On 27 September 2018, Bishop Romuald Kamiński of the Warsaw-Praga Diocese issued an apology to those who had been sexually abused by priests in his Diocese and that church leaders in Poland had completed work on a document to address the abuse of minors and suggest ways to prevent it. According to Archbishop Wojciech Polak, the head of Poland&#x27;s Catholic Church, the document will also include data on the scale of priestly sex abuse in Poland. By early 2019, however, the document still had not been made public. On 8 October 2018, a victims group mapped out 255 cases of alleged sex abuse in Poland.

Statistics were released on 14 April 2019, commissioned by the Episcopal Conference of Poland and with data from over 10,000 local parishes. It was found that from 1990 to mid-2018, abuse reports about 382 priests were made to the Church, with 625 children, mostly under 16, sexually abused by members of the Catholic clergy. There were opinions that the figures underestimated the extent of the problem, and failed to answer questions church officials had avoided for years. Marek Lisinski, the co-founder of &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid&quot;, which represents victims of clerical abuse, said &quot;Tell us how [the priests] hurt those children and how many times they were transferred to different parishes before you paid notice&quot;. The data were released a few weeks after Pope Francis had called for &quot;an all-out battle against the abuse of minors&quot;. After pressure from the Pope, in the preceding years Poland&#x27;s Church had publicly apologised for abuses, and accepted the need to report those accused of such crimes. In earlier times, clergy to whom sexual abuse of minors was reported were not required by their superiors to notify the police, but to investigate themselves, and if necessary inform the Vatican.

On 11 May 2019, Polak issued an apology on behalf of the entire Catholic Church in Poland. The same day, &quot;Tell No One&quot;, a documentary detailing accounts of sex abuse by Catholic Church clergy in Poland, went viral, reaching 8.1 million viewers on YouTube by 13 May. Among many, the film featured a priest known as Father Jan A., whose case is being reviewed by the Diocese of Kielce, who confessed to molesting many young girls. The film also alleges that Rev. Dariusz Olejniczak, a priest who was sentenced for molesting 7-year-old girls, was allowed to continue working with young people despite his conviction. On 14 May 2019, Poland&#x27;s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, which has long had an alliance with the nation&#x27;s Catholic Bishops, agreed to increase penalties for child sex abuse by raising the maximum prison sentence from 12 years to 30 years and raising the age of consent from 15 to 16. Prosecutor and PiS lawmaker Stanislaw Piotrowicz, who heads the Polish Parliament&#x27;s Justice Commission, has also been criticized for playing down the actions of a priest who was convicted for inappropriately touching and kissing young girls.

On 25 June 2020, Pope Francis appointed Grzegorz Rys, Archbishop of Łódź, Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Kalisz, relieving its Bishop, Edward Janiak, age 67, of his responsibilities while under investigation for protecting priests who committed acts of sex abuse. On 17 October, Pope Francis accepted Janiak&#x27;s resignation.

In February 2019, three protestors toppled a statue of Rev. Henryk Jankowski following revelations that he sexually abused Barbara Borowiecka when she was a girl. Jankowski, who also had a criminal investigation involving the sexual abuse of a boy dropped against him in 2004, had been defrocked in 2005. However, he died in 2010 without ever being convicted of sex abuse. It has also been acknowledged that Lech Walesa&#x27;s personal chaplain Rev. Franciszek Cybula had been accused of committing acts of sex abuse while serving in the as well. On 13 August 2020, Pope Francis removed Gdansk Archbishop Slawoj Leszek Glodz, who was among those who covered up abuse committed by Jankowski and Cybula. Glodz had also presided over Cybula&#x27;s funeral. Despite the fact that Glodz turned 75, the required age for Catholic Bishops to offer their resignation, the move was described as &quot;cleaning house&quot;, as it is highly unusual for the pope to accept such a resignation on a prelate&#x27;s actual birthday.

On 6 November 2020, The Holy See&#x27;s nuncio to Poland announced that following an investigation by the Holy See regarding sex abuse allegations, Cardinal Henryk Gulbinowicz was now &quot;barred from any kind of celebration or public meeting and from using his episcopal insignia, and is deprived of the right to a cathedral funeral and burial.&quot; Gulbinowicz was also ordered to pay an &quot;appropriate sum&quot; to his alleged victims.
Gulbinowicz is the former archbishop of Wrocław, whose support of the trade union Solidarity played a critical role in the collapse of communism in Poland. On 16 November 2020, 10 days after the Vatican sanctions, Gulbinowicz died. But as a result of the Vatican displinary action, he could not have a funeral in Wroclaw&#x27;s Cathedral of St. John the Baptist or to be buried in the cathedral.

==== Portugal ====
In 1993, a priest of the Diocese of Funchal, Frederico Cunha, was convicted  for the murder of 15-year-old Luís Correia. His corpse was found at the bottom of the Caniçal cliff, in Ponta de São Lourenço, on the eastern end of the island of Madeira, with signs of aggression. During the trial, four witnesses, now adults, told the court how they had been sexually abused by the priest.

Bishop Teodoro de Faria protested against the detention of Frederico Cunha and described him as &quot;innocent like Jesus Christ&quot;, who was also unfairly attacked by the Jews Father Frederico also compared himself to Jesus Christ, saying that like the son of God, he was a &quot;victim of injustice and absurdity&quot; . Prominent figures from the Church were laudatory witnesses. The then  President of the Regional Government of Madeira, Alberto João Jardim, accused &quot;certain mainland &quot;media  of using the case &quot;to denigrate the image of Madeira&quot;. In April 1998, Cunha escaped to Rio de Janeiro, where he still lives at ease. The  sentence officially expired on April 8, 2018.

A report published in February 2023 revealed that at least 4,815 children had been sexually abused by clergy in the Catholic church in Portugal since 1950.

====United Kingdom====

In 2013, Cardinal Keith O&#x27;Brien, the Archbishop of Saint Andrews and Edinburgh, resigned following publication of allegations he had engaged in inappropriate and predatory sexual conduct with priests and seminarians under his jurisdiction and abused his power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Devenney18/05/2013&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2020, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse released a report which stated that the Catholic Church of England and Wales &quot;swept under the carpet&quot; allegations of past child sex abuse by numerous Catholic clergy in England and Wales. According to the report &quot;there was no acknowledgement of any personal responsibility&quot; by Vincent Nichols, since 2014, a cardinal and the senior Catholic cleric in England and Wales. The report said that Nichols cared more about the impact of abuse on the Church&#x27;s reputation than on the victims, and lacked compassion towards them.

=====Northern Ireland=====
In Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry started in January 2014. It was the largest inquiry in UK legal history into sexual and physical abuse in certain institutions (including non-Catholic ones) that were in charge of children from 1922 to 1995. The De La Salle Brothers and the Sisters of Nazareth admitted early in the inquiry to physical and sexual abuse of children in institutions in Northern Ireland that they controlled, and issued an apology to victims. A 2017 report also stated that the local police, who had also poorly investigated claims of sex abuse at the non-Catholic Kincora Boys&#x27; Home, had played a role in assisting the local Catholic officials in covering up reported sexual abuse activity at four Catholic-run homes for boys in the Belfast area and that these four homes had contained the highest level of reported sex abuse of all the 22 homes which were investigated.

=== Oceania ===

==== Australia ====
The Catholic church in Australia had been criticised for mishandling childhood sexual abuse cases which are severe in nature and widespread in extent. Catholic priests were charged by 2011 in over 100 cases of childhood sexual abuse in Australia. The Catholic Church had secretly paid equivalent of $276.1 million by 2017 in compensation to thousands of childhood sexual abuse victims of priests and religious brothers. Inquiries established that historically Australian Catholic church officials often, where cardinal George Pell knew about sex abuse in Catholic church as early as 1973, ignored or punished the child victim, did not investigate allegations, documents were destroyed or not kept, failed to prevent future abuse by clergy who had come to their attention by transferring clergy and religious members to new parishes or dioceses which did not know of their past and not stripping them of their religious status. John Paul II and Benedict XVI made apologies for abuse in Australia.

Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse (2015–17) found that 7% of all Catholic priests in Australia were &quot;alleged perpetrators of child sex abuse&quot;, average age of victims was 11.5 for boys and 10.5 for girls. Royal Commission found that 46% (92 out of 201) of Catholic Churches had child sexual abuse cases. Royal Commission had 4,756 child sexual abuse cases from 4,444 victims against 1,880 accused, in 62% cases the accused were Catholic priests and religious brothers and the rest were members of church. Abuse victim Amber Louise criticized Church&#x27;s &quot;Towards Healing protocol&quot;, started in 1996 to &quot;establish a compassionate and just system for dealing with complaints of abuse&quot;, who told the Royal Commission that the program delayed reporting her complaint. In June 2019, 18 months after being ordered to do so by the Royal Commission, the Australian Catholic Church published its National Catholic Safeguarding Standards closely mirroring Royal Commission&#x27;s recommendations and government&#x27;s National Principles for Child Safe Organizations.

In 2019, Fr Vincent Gerald Ryan, who had previously served 14 years in jail for sexually abusing 34 boys from 1973 to 1991, was jailed for at least 14 months for sex abuse he committed against two altar boys.

In September 2020, the Australian state of Queensland passed legislation which makes it so religious institutions, such as the Catholic church, and their members are no longer able to use the sanctity of confession as a defence against failing to report material information about the sexual abuse of children. Under the new Queensland law, clergy who refuse to report confessions of sex abuse will face a maximum sentence of three years in prison. In October 2020, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found that the church had failed to intervene against Thomas Butler, a Marist Brother known as Brother Patrick, when students reported that he sexually abused them within the three-year period he taught at Queensland capital Brisbane&#x27;s Marist College Ashgrove. Butler had received sex abuse complaints in between 1991 and 1993. Provincial of the Marist Brothers in Australia, Brother Peter Carroll, delivered an apology at the royal commission&#x27;s public hearing.

==Governmental and legal responses==

=== Ireland ===

In an address before the Irish parliament on 11 May 1999, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern announced a comprehensive program to respond to the scandal of abuse in the nation&#x27;s Catholic-run childcare institutions. Ahern&#x27;s speech included the first official apology to those who had been abused physically and sexually while they had been in the care of these institutions. The Taoiseach asked the abuse victims for forgiveness, saying: &quot;On behalf of the State and of all citizens of the State, the Government wishes to make a sincere and long overdue apology to the victims of childhood abuse for our collective failure to intervene, to detect their pain, to come to their rescue.&quot;

In response to the furor aroused by the media reports of abuse in Irish government institutions run by religious orders, the Irish government commissioned a study which took nine years to complete. On 20 May 2009, the commission released its 2600-page report, which drew on testimony from thousands of former residents and officials from more than 250 institutions. The commission found that there were thousands of allegations of physical abuse of children of both sexes over a period of six decades. Over the same period, around 370 former child residents alleged they had suffered various forms of sexual abuse from religious figures and others. The report revealed that government inspectors had failed in their responsibility to detect and stop the abuse. The report characterized sexual molestation as &quot;endemic&quot; in some church-run industrial schools and orphanages for boys.

In the wake of the broadcast of a BBC Television documentary, &quot;Suing the Pope&quot;, which highlighted the case of Seán Fortune, one of the most notorious clerical sexual offenders, the Irish government initiated an official inquiry into the allegations of clerical sexual abuse in the Irish Roman Catholic Diocese of Ferns. The inquiry resulted in the publication of the Ferns Report in 2005.

In response to the Ferns Report, Ireland&#x27;s Prime Minister Brian Cowen stated that he was &quot;ashamed by the extent, length, and cruelty&quot; of child abuse, apologized to victims for the government&#x27;s failure to intervene in sexual abuse and severe beatings in schools for much of the 20th century. Cowen also promised to reform the Ireland&#x27;s social services for children in line with the recommendations of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse report. Irish President Mary McAleese and Cowen made further motions to start criminal investigation against members of Roman Catholic religious orders in Ireland.

In November 2009, Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse reported its findings in which it concluded that:


In 2009, The Murphy Report is the result of a three-year public inquiry conducted by the Irish government into the Sexual abuse scandal in Dublin archdiocese, released a few months after the report of the Ryan report. The Murphy report stated that, &quot;The Commission has no doubt that clerical child sexual abuse was covered up by the Archdiocese of Dublin and other Church authorities&quot;. It found that, &quot;The structures and rules of the Catholic Church facilitated that cover-up.&quot; Moreover, the report asserted that, &quot;State authorities facilitated that cover-up by not fulfilling their responsibilities to ensure that the law was applied equally to all and allowing the Church institutions to be beyond the reach of the normal law enforcement processes.&quot; The report criticized four archbishops – John Charles McQuaid who died in 1973, Dermot Ryan who died in 1984, Kevin McNamara who died in 1987, and retired Cardinal Desmond Connell – for not giving allegations and information on abusers to legal authorities.

=== United Nations ===
The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, in early 2014, issued a report asserting that the pope and the Roman Catholic Church have not done enough and protect their reputation rather than protect children. A joint statement of the panel said,Committee chair Kirsten Sandberg enumerated some major findings, including that abusive priests were sent to new parishes or other countries without police being informed, that the Vatican never insisted on bishops reporting abuse to police, and that known abusers still have access to children. Barbara Blaine of SNAP said,
The UN report prompted discussions of specific areas of controversy, including a veil of secrecy among bishops and Vatican statements denying canonical legal responsibility.

British author and Catholic social activist Paul Vallely contended that the UN report had been hurt by the Commission having gone well beyond the issue of child abuse by investigating other issues unrelated to sexual abuse, such as contraception. However, he also found that the report brought substantial pressure on the Vatican to redress major issues, such as the absence of appropriate institutional protocol for the reporting of sexual abuse cases to police.

===United States===
The Associated Press estimated the settlements of US Church sex abuse cases from 1950 to 2007 totaled more than US$2 billion. The figure was more than $3 billion in 2012 according to BishopAccountability.

==== Civil lawsuits ====

In July 2003, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Louisville paid $25.7 million to &quot;settle child sexual-abuse allegations made in 240 lawsuits naming 34 priests and other church workers.&quot;

According to &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, the Archdiocese of Boston secretly settled child sexual abuse claims against at least 70 priests from 1992 to 2002. In 2003, the Archdiocese of Boston also settled a large case for $85 million with 552 alleged victims.

In April 2007, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon agreed to a $75 million settlement with 177 claimants and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle agreed to a $48 million settlement with more than 160 victims.

In July 2008, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Denver agreed &quot;to pay $5.5 million to settle 18 claims of childhood sexual abuse.&quot;

Addressing &quot;a flood of abuse claims&quot; five dioceses (Tucson, Arizona; Spokane, Washington; Portland, Oregon; Davenport, Iowa, and San Diego) got bankruptcy protection. Eight Catholic dioceses have declared bankruptcy due to sex abuse cases from 2004 to 2011.

The cost to the Church of providing for victim restitution settlements increased rapidly. Taking into account sums awarded to victims by juries, out-of-court settlements and legal fees, estimates went from $0.5 billion by the late 1990s to more than $2.6 billion in 2009. Roman Catholics spent $615 million on sex abuse cases in 2007.

The great number of compensatory settlements levied on the Church made it necessary for dioceses to reduce their ordinary operating expenses, some even closing churches and parochial schools to raise the funds to make these payments. Several dioceses chose to declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a way to litigate settlements while protecting enough church assets needed for the maintaining of operations. In some cases, the dioceses filed bankruptcy just before civil suits against them were about to go to trial. This had the effect of producing the mandate that forced pending and future lawsuits against the Church to be settled in bankruptcy court. In 2007, the sexual abuse scandal cost each of the 195 dioceses &quot;an average of $300,000 annually.&quot;

Several dioceses adopted the preemptive practice of transferring the majority of their assets to their parishes and foundations before declaring bankruptcy, thereby decreasing the money available for settlement compensation. The Vatican&#x27;s complicit involvement in this practice varied by case. In some cases, the Vatican had to approve the transfer of large amounts to foundations in order to shield them from seizure; in others it guided and supervised such transactions.

====Resignations, retirements, and laicizations====
Some of the accused priests were forced to resign. Some priests whose crimes fell within statutes of limitation are in jail. Some have been laicized. Others – because they are elderly, because of the nature of their offenses, or because they have had some success fighting the charges – cannot be laicized under canon law. Some priests live in retreat houses that are carefully monitored and sometimes locked.

Bernard Francis Law, Cardinal and Archbishop of Boston, Massachusetts, United States, resigned after Church documents were revealed which suggested he had covered up sexual abuse committed by priests in his archdiocese. On 13 December 2002, Pope John Paul II accepted Law&#x27;s resignation as Archbishop and reassigned him to an administrative position in the Roman Curia, naming him archpriest of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, and he later presided at one of the Pope&#x27;s funeral masses. Law&#x27;s successor in Boston, Archbishop (later Cardinal) Seán P. O&#x27;Malley, sold some of the archdiocese&#x27;s real estate properties and drew on existing financial courses to pay the $127356.4 million in claims against the archdiocese. Though these were closed parish properties, their closing was unrelated to the case as they were closed previous to the case.

Two bishops of Palm Beach, Florida, resigned due to child abuse allegations. Resigned bishop Joseph Keith Symons was replaced by Anthony O&#x27;Connell, who later also resigned in 2002.

=== Comparisons to other environments ===
==== Comparison to Protestant Churches and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses ====
A report which Christian Ministry Resources (CMR) released in 2002 stated that contrary to popular opinion, there are more allegations of child sexual abuse in Protestant congregations than there are in Catholic ones, and that sexual violence is most often committed by volunteers rather than by priests. It also criticized the way the media reported sexual crimes in Australia. The Royal Commission in Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse revealed that between January 1950 and February 2015, 4,445 people alleged incidents of child sexual abuse in 4,765 claims. The media reportedly reported that as many as 7% of priests were accused of being a child sexual abuser, but ignored the same report on the Protestant Churches and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses; Gerard Henderson stated:
One of the authors of an investigation by &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; drew parallels between the handling of sexual assaults in the Church and how medical authorities handled similar abuse and assaults by doctors and psychologists. In both systems, the abusers are in positions of trust, admiration, and authority; the abuse is treated as an illness; the perpetrator is allowed to return to practice following an apology or rehabilitation program; and the incidents are hidden from the public for the good of the organization.

====Comparison to schools====

Hofstra University researcher Charol Shakeshaft, the author of a 2002 report on sexual offenses in schools, said sexual violence is much more prevalent in schools than in the Church. Ernie Allen, former president of the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children, stated: &quot;we don&#x27;t see the Catholic Church as a hotbed of this [sexual abuse and pedophilia] or as a place that has a bigger problem [with this issue] than anyone else.&quot; A 2017 report on sexual abuse in the United States, funded by Department of Justice, claimed that an &quot;estimated 10% of K–12 students will experience sexual misconduct by a school employee by the time they graduate from high school&quot;. In 2019, &quot;Juris Magazine&quot;, the journal of the Duquesne Law School, compared reports and concluded that sexual abuse by school teachers is proportionally higher than by Catholic priests – while about 4% Catholic priests and other clerics per year commit sexual abuse, this number rose to 5–7 % in the case of public school teachers. The magazine also argued that while &quot;Catholic priest sexual abuse has been documented as far back as the 1950s, there have been very few reported cases after 2002, as the church has implemented practices to handle this issue.&quot;

===Debate over causes===

There have been many debates over the causes of sex abuse cases.

====Clerical celibacy====
Opinion seems divided on whether there is any definite link or connection between the Roman Catholic institution of celibacy and incidents of child abuse by Catholic clergy.

A 2005 article in the conservative Irish weekly the &quot;Western People&quot; proposed that clerical celibacy contributed to the abuse problem by suggesting that the institution of celibacy has created a &quot;morally superior&quot; status that is easily misapplied by abusive priests: &quot;The Irish Church&#x27;s prospect of a recovery is zero for as long as bishops continue blindly to toe the Vatican line of Pope Benedict XVI that a male celibate priesthood is morally superior to other sections of society.&quot; Christoph Schönborn and Hans Küng have also said that priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals within the Catholic Church.

Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said, &quot;We don&#x27;t see the Catholic Church as a hotbed of this or a place that has a bigger problem than anyone else. I can tell you without hesitation that we have seen cases in many religious settings, from traveling evangelists to mainstream ministers to rabbis and others.&quot; Philip Jenkins, a long-time Catholic turned Episcopalian, asserts that his &quot;research of cases over the past 20 years indicates no evidence whatever that Catholic or other celibate clergy are any more likely to be involved in misconduct or abuse than clergy of any other denomination—or indeed, than non-clergy. However determined news media may be to see this affair as a crisis of celibacy, the charge is just unsupported.&quot;

==== Failure to disclose ====

Church authorities are often accused of covering up cases of sex abuse. In many cases, as discussed in the sections on different countries, clergy discovered by Church authorities to be criminally offending are not reported to civil authorities such as the police. They are often merely moved from one diocese to another, usually without any warning to the authorities or the congregations at the destination. While offending clergy could be subject to action such as laicization, this is rare; the intention of the Church until recent times has been to avoid publicity and scandal at all costs.

In some cases offenders may confess their wrongdoing to a priest under the Sacrament of Penance. Church canon law unconditionally prohibits a priest hearing such a confession from making any disclosure about the existence or content of the confession to anybody, including Church and civil authorities—the &quot;Seal of the Confessional&quot;. This obligation is taken very seriously throughout the Catholic Church; for example all serving archbishops in Australia told the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse that they would not report to police a colleague who admitted in the confessional to child rape. This is not always in contradiction with civil law; the law in many, but not all, countries confers confessional privilege, a rule of evidence that forbids judicial inquiry into certain communications between clergy and members of their congregation.

====Gay priests and homosexuality====

According to the John Jay Report, 80.9% of the abuse victims in the United States were male, and a study by Thomas Plante found the number may be as high as 90%. A number of books, such as &quot;The Rite of Sodomy: Homosexuality and the Roman Catholic Church&quot;, have argued that homosexual priests view sex with minors as a &quot;rite of passage&quot; for altar boys and other pre-adult males. William Donohue of the Catholic League said that the Church&#x27;s child sexual abuse problem was really a &quot;homosexual crisis&quot;, which some have dismissed as unwarranted by stating a lack of correlation between a man identifying as homosexual and any particular likelihood he will abuse children. Research on pedophilia in general shows a majority of abusers identify themselves as heterosexual, and the Causes and Context Study of the John Jay Institute found no statistical support for linking homosexual identity and sexual abuse of minors. Additionally &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported &quot;the abuse decreased as more gay priests began serving the church.&quot;

====Impact of psychology from previous decades====
Some bishops and psychiatrists have asserted that the prevailing psychology of the times suggested that people could be cured of such behavior through counseling. Thomas Plante, a psychologist specializing in abuse counseling and considered an expert on clerical abuse, states &quot;the vast majority of the research on sexual abuse of minors didn&#x27;t emerge until the early 1980s. So, it appeared reasonable at the time to treat these men and then return them to their priestly duties. In hindsight, this was a tragic mistake.&quot;

Robert S. Bennett, the Roman Catholic Washington attorney who headed the National Review Board&#x27;s research committee, identified &quot;too much faith in psychiatrists&quot; as one of the key problems concerning Catholic sex abuse cases. About 40% of the abusive priests had received counseling before being reassigned.

==== Moral relativism ====
In 2019, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI published a letter (in German and then translated into English) in which he provided a unified perspective on several issues that, together, he believes contributed to the sexual abuse scandal. One of the chief reasons put forth by the Pope was the push by several prominent theologians for relativistic perspectives on morality where &quot;there could no longer be anything that constituted an absolute good, any more than anything fundamentally evil; (there could be) only relative value judgments.&quot;

====Pedophilia and ephebophilia====
In &quot;Sexual Addiction and Compulsivity: The Journal of Treatment and Prevention&quot;, Cimbolic &amp; Cartor (2006) noted that because of the large share of post-pubescent male minors among cleric victims there is need to further study the differential variables related to ephebophilia (sexual interest in mid-to-late adolescents, generally ages 15 to 19) versus pedophilia (sexual interest in prepubescent children, generally those 13 years of age or younger) offenders. Cartor, Cimbolic &amp; Tallon (2008) found that 6 percent of the cleric offenders in the John Jay Report are pedophiles, 32 percent ephebophiles, 15 percent attracted to 11- and 12-year-olds only (both male and female), 20 percent indiscriminate, and 27 percent mildly indiscriminate. Professor of psychology Thomas Plante (2004) criticized these findings, citing a report by Stephen Joseph Rossetti which found that only about 1% of Catholic priests have had a sexual experience with a child, while an additional 1% has had a sexual experience with an adolescent – totaling 2% of all Catholic clergy. This report also found that 80 percent to 90 percent of sexual abuse of children perpetrated by Catholic priests is directed towards adolescent boys; therefore, pedophilia among Catholic clergy appears to be rare with ephebophilia being more typical.

They also found distinct differences between the pedophile and ephebophile groups. They reported that there may be &quot;another group of offenders who are more indiscriminate in victim choice and represent a more heterogeneous, but still a distinct offender category&quot; and suggested further research to determine &quot;specific variables that are unique to this group and can differentiate these offenders from pedophile and ephebophile offenders&quot; so as to improve the identification and treatment of both offenders and victims.

All victims in the John Jay report were minors. Using a non-standard definition of &quot;pre-pubescent&quot;, the Causes and Context Study of the John Jay College estimated that only a small percentage of offender priests were true pedophiles. The study classified victims as pre-pubescent if they were age 10 or younger, whereas the age bracket specified in the current guidelines issued by the American Psychiatric Association is &quot;generally age 13 or younger&quot;. A recent book estimates that if the latter definition were used instead of the former, the percentage of victims classified as prepubescent would have been 54% rather than the 18% figure cited by the Causes and Context report, and that a higher percentage of priests would therefore have been classified as pedophiles.

====Statement of Pope Francis====
In July 2014, Pope Francis was quoted as having said in an interview that about 8,000 Catholic clergy (2% of the total), including bishops and cardinals, were pedophiles. The Vatican indicated the interview had not been recorded nor notes taken during it and that quotes may have been misattributed in a deliberate attempt to manipulate readers. They stated that Pope Francis had not indicated that any cardinal abusers remained in their position.

====Shortage of priests====
It has been argued that a shortage of priests caused the Roman Catholic hierarchy to act in such a way to preserve the number of clergy and ensure that sufficient numbers were available to man their congregations despite serious allegations that some of these priests were unfit for duty.

====Purported declining standards in the prevailing culture====
In &quot;The Courage To Be Catholic: Crisis, Reform, and the Future of the Church&quot;, author George Weigel claims that it was the infidelity to orthodox Roman Catholic teaching, the &quot;culture of dissent&quot; of priests, women religious, bishops, theologians, catechists, Church bureaucrats, and activists who &quot;believed that what the Church proposed as true was actually false&quot; was mainly responsible for the sexual abuse of parishioners&#x27; children by their priests. Cardinal Theodore Edgar McCarrick, a retired Archbishop of Washington who was himself later laicized due to sexual misconduct, blamed the declining morals of the late 20th century as a cause of the high number of child molestations by priests.

The hypothesis that a purported decline in general moral standards was associated with an increase in abuse by clergy was promoted by a study by John Jay College funded by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The study claimed that the liberal 1960s caused the increase in abuse, and the conservative Reagan years led to its decline. The study was branded the &#x27;Woodstock Defence&#x27; by critics who said that the study&#x27;s own figures showed a surge in abuse reported from the 1950s, and the passage of time meant that reports of abuse from earlier decades were unlikely.

====Seminary training====
The 2004 John Jay Report, a report commissioned by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, stated &quot;the problem was largely the result of poor seminary training and insufficient emotional support for men ordained in the 1940s and 1950s.&quot; A report by the National Review Board issued simultaneously with the &quot;John Jay Report&quot; pointed to two major deficiencies on the part of seminaries: failure to screen candidates adequately, followed by failure to &quot;form&quot; these candidates appropriately for the challenges of celibacy. These themes are taken up by a recent memoir by Vincent J. Miles that combines a first-hand account of his life in a minor seminary during the 1960s with a review of the scientific literature about sexually abusive behavior. Miles identifies specific aspects of seminary life that could have predisposed future priests to engage in such behavior.

====Male dominated culture of the church====
Italian academic wrote in &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; that a greater presence of women in the Vatican could have prevented clerical sexual abuse from taking place.

This view has been challenged and severely criticized by several scholars for denying the cases of nuns implicated in sexual abuse and pedophilia. In 1986, a history scholar from Stanford University recovered archival information about investigations from 1619 to 1623 involving nuns in Vellano, Italy, secretly exploiting illiterate nuns for several years. In 1998, a religious research national survey on revealed a very high number of nuns reporting childhood victimizations of sexual abuse by other nuns. It was further noted that the majority of nun-abuse victims are of the same sex. In 2002, Markham examined the sexual histories of nuns to find several cases of nuns sexually abusing children.

===Church responses===
The responses of the Catholic Church to the sex abuse cases can be viewed on three levels: the diocesan level, the episcopal conference level, and the Vatican. Responses to the scandal proceeded at levels in parallel, with the higher levels becoming progressively more involved as the gravity of the problem became more apparent. For the most part, responding to allegations of sexual abuse in a diocese was left to the jurisdiction of the local bishop or archbishop. According to Thomas Plante, a psychologist specializing in abuse counseling and considered an expert on clerical abuse, &quot;unlike most large organizations that maintain a variety of middle management positions, the organizational structure of the Catholic Church is a fairly flat structure. Therefore, prior to the Church clergy abuse crisis in 2002, each bishop decided for himself how to manage these cases and the allegations of child sexual abuse by priests. Some have handled these matters very poorly (as evidenced in Boston) while others have handled these issues very well.&quot;

After the number of allegations exploded following &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; series of articles, the breadth and depth of the scandals became apparent in dioceses across the United States. The U.S. bishops felt compelled to formulate a coordinated response at the episcopal conference level. Although the Vatican did not respond immediately to the series of articles published by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; in 2002, it has been reported that Vatican officials were, in fact, monitoring the situation in the U.S. closely.

John L. Allen Jr., senior correspondent for the &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot;, characterized the reaction of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) as calling for &quot;swift, sure and final punishment for priests who are guilty of this kind of misconduct.&quot; In contrast to this, Allen characterized the Vatican&#x27;s primary concern as wanting to make sure &quot;that everyone&#x27;s rights are respected, including the rights of accused clergy&quot; and wanting to affirm that it is not acceptable to &quot;remedy the injustice of sexual abuse with the injustice of railroading priests who may or may not be guilty.&quot;

====&quot;Communis Vita&quot;====
On 26 March 2019, Pope Francis made public an apostolic letter titled &quot;Communis Vita&quot; (Community Life). The letter, which was issued on 19 March 2019, amends Canon Law and requires superiors to a local religious to dismiss any member of their &quot;religious house&quot; if they have been absent for 12 months and out of contact. Canon Law already required superiors to track them down and encourage them to return to their local order after they have been absent for six months. The policy officially came into effect on 10 April 2019. Parish transfers of abusive priests have existed in numerous Catholic sex abuse cases.

====Diocesan responses====

=====Ireland=====

In 2009, eighteen religious orders agreed to pay €1.2 billion compensation to childhood victims of sexual abuse, a 10 times increase from the €128 million compensation agreed in 2002, on the condition that the identities of abusers must be kept secret, and victims will forgo the right to sue church and government. Money was raised mainly by selling church property to government.

Catholic Church Commission on Child Sexual Abuse (Ireland), also known as the Hussey Commission, was established by church in 2001 to investigate how complaints about clerical abuse of minors have been handled over the last three decades. In 2010 Vatican announced an investigation into Irish Catholic Establishment&#x27;s handling of the sex abuse and subsequent scandal.

=====Philippines=====
After the media in Philippines began reporting on sexual abuses by local catholic priests, in 2002 the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Philippines apologized for sexual misconduct committed by its priests over the last two decades and committed to drafting guidelines on how to deal with allegations of such offenses. CBCP President Archbishop Orlando Quevedo stated that over the previous two decades nearly 200 of country&#x27;s 7,000 catholic priests may have committed &quot;sexual misconduct including child abuse, homosexuality and affairs&quot;.

In August 2011, after women&#x27;s rights group GABRIELA assisted a 17-year-old girl in filing sexual abuse allegations against a Catholic priest in Butuan, the local bishop, Juan de Dios Pueblos, took the accused priest under his custody without handing him over to civil and church authorities. This behavior was also heavily criticized by retired Archbishop Oscar Cruz, who blamed Pueblos for showing his priests the &quot;wrong way&quot;.

=====United States=====
According to the John Jay Report, one in four child sex abuse allegations were made within 10 years of the incident. Half were made between 10 and 30 years after the incident and the remaining 25% were reported more than 30 years after the incident. The Report points at: failure by the RCC hierarchy in the United States to grasp the seriousness of the problem, overemphasis on the need to avoid a scandal, use of unqualified treatment centers for clergy removed for rehabilitation, a sort of misguided willingness by bishops to forgive sexual misconduct as a moral failing and not treat it a crime, allowance of recidivism upon reassignment of the priest, and insufficient accountability of the hierarchy for inaction.

======Rehabilitation efforts======
Since 2002, a major focus of the lawsuits and media attention has been criticism of the approach taken by bishops when dealing with allegations of sexual abuse by priests. As a general rule, the allegations were not reported to legal authority for investigation and prosecution. Instead, many dioceses directed the offending priests to seek psychiatric treatment and for assessment of the risk of re-offending. In 2004, according to the John Jay report, nearly 40% of accused priests participated in psychiatric treatment programs. The remaining priests did not undergo abuse counseling because allegations of sexual abuse were only made after their death. The more allegations made against a priest, the more likely he was to participate in treatment.

Some bishops repeatedly moved offending priests from parish to parish after abuse counseling, where they still had personal contact with children. According to the USCCB, Catholic bishops in the 1950s and 1960s viewed sexual abuse by priests as &quot;a spiritual problem, one requiring a spiritual solution, i.e. prayer&quot;.

However, starting in the 1960s, the bishops came to adopt an emerging view based on the advice of medical personnel who recommended psychiatric and psychological treatment for those who sexually abused minors. This view asserted that with treatment, priests who had molested children could safely be placed back into ministry, although perhaps with certain restrictions such as not being in contact with children. This approach viewed pedophilia as an addiction, such as alcoholism which can be treated and restrained.

Some of the North American treatment facilities most frequently used for this purpose included the Saint Luke Institute in Maryland; centers operated by the Servants of the Paraclete in Jemez Springs, New Mexico, and St. Louis, Missouri; John Vianney Center in Downingtown, Pennsylvania.; the Institute of Living in Hartford, Connecticut; and the Southdown Institute near Toronto, Ontario, in Canada. This approach continued into the mid-1980s, a period which the USCCB characterizes as the &quot;tipping point in the understanding of the problem within the church and in society&quot;. According to researcher Paul Isley, however, research on priest offenders is virtually nonexistent and the claims of unprecedented treatment success with clergy offenders have not been supported by published data.

======Prevention efforts======

The USCCB perceived a lack of adequate procedures for the prevention of sexual abuse of minors, the reporting of allegations of such abuse and the handling of those reports. In response to deficiencies in canonical and secular law, both ecclesiastical and civil authorities have implemented procedures and laws to prevent sexual abuse of minors by clergy and to report and punish it if and when it occurs. In June 2002, the USCCB adopted a zero tolerance policy to future sex abuse that required responding to allegations of sexual abuse. It promulgated a Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People that pledged the Catholic Church in the U.S. to providing a &quot;safe environment&quot; for all children in Church-sponsored activities.

The Charter instituted reforms to prevent future abuse by requiring background checks for Church employees. The Charter requires dioceses faced with an allegation to alert the authorities, conduct an investigation and remove the accused from duty. A &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; article reported nearly two-thirds of the bishops attending the conference had covered for sexually abusive priests. According to &quot;Catholic News Service&quot; by 2008, the U.S. church had trained &quot;5.8 million children to recognize and report abuse,&quot; run criminal checks on volunteers and employees and trained them to create a safe environment for children.

Analysing the results of prevention reforms implemented in the 1990s and 2000s, the John Jay report from May 2011 found a &quot;marked decrease in the incidence and a sustained suppression of abusive behavior&quot; in the 1980s, and stated that sexual abuse in the Catholic Church declined sharply in the 1980s and continued to decline in the 1990s and 2000s. The report recorded 975 sexual abuse cases by Catholic priests between 1985 and 1989, 253 between 1995 and 1999, and 73 for the years 2004–2008. According to the report, there have been &quot;continuing very low levels of sexual abuse of minors&quot; in the Catholic Church ever since the early 2000s; The report also stated that though &quot;more cases of sexual abuse continue to be reported to dioceses today, almost all of these allegations are of abuse that occurred decades earlier.&quot; A majority of sexual abuse cases in the Catholic Church involve incidents that occurred between 1950 and 1969; the overwhelming majority of these cases involve priests who were ordained before 1970. In comparison, less than 2% of sexual abuse cases in the Catholic Church concerned priests ordained after 1989.

======Reception by the laity======

A 2006 study by Jesuit Georgetown University Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate (CARA) found lay Catholics were unaware of the specific steps that the church has decided to take, but 78% strongly approved reporting allegations of sexual abuse to civil authorities and 76% strongly approved of removing people credibly accused of sexual abuse of a minor.

In 2005, Kathleen McChesney of the USCCB said &quot;In 2004, at least 1,092 allegations of sexual abuse were made against at least 756 Catholic priests and deacons in the United States... What is over is the denial that this problem exists, and what is over is the reluctance of the Church to deal openly with the public about the nature and extent of the problem.&quot;

In early 2009, the sexual impropriety including molesting boys by Marcial Maciel Degollado, the founder of the Legion of Christ, a Roman Catholic congregation of pontifical right made up of priests and seminarians studying for the priesthood, was disclosed publicly. In March, the Vatican ordered an apostolic visitation of the sexual abuse scandal in the Legion of Christ. In June 2009 Vatican authorities named five bishops from five different countries, each one in charge of investigating the Legionaries in a particular part of the world.

====Episcopal responses====

=====United Kingdom=====
The 2001 Lord Nolan recommendations, accepted in full by the bishops, became model guidelines for other bishops&#x27; conferences around the world, and a model for other institutions in Britain. One guideline was that in each parish there should be a &quot;safeguarding officer&quot;, a lay person who would vet through the Criminal Records Bureau, a government agency, anyone in the parish who had access to young people or vulnerable adults, and would be a contact for anyone with any concerns.

=====United States=====
In June 2002, the USCCB established the &quot;Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People&quot;, a comprehensive set of procedures for addressing allegations of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy. The charter includes guidelines for reconciliation, healing, accountability, reporting, and prevention of future acts of abuse.

The USCCB&#x27;s National Review Board for the Protection of Children and Young People now requires dioceses faced with an allegation of child sexual abuse (where the victim is currently a minor) to alert the authorities, conduct an investigation, and (in the case of an admission of guilt or finding of guilt by an appropriate investigation) remove the accused from duty.

The Board also approached John Jay College of Criminal Justice to conduct a descriptive study of the nature and scope of the problem of child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church as well as the costs to the church of the scandal. Data collection commenced in March 2003, and ended in February 2004. The findings of this study are discussed elsewhere on this page.

====Holy See&#x27;s Response====
John L. Allen Jr., Vatican correspondent for the &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot;, commented that many American Catholics saw the Vatican&#x27;s initial silence on &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; stories as showing a lack of concern or awareness about the issue. However, Allen said that he did not know anyone in the Roman Curia who was not at least horrified &quot;by the revelations that came out of the &quot;Globe&quot; and elsewhere&quot; or who would defend &quot;Cardinal Law&#x27;s handling of the cases in Boston&quot; or &quot;the rather shocking lack of oversight that revealed itself&quot; though &quot;they might have different analyses of what should have happened to him&quot;. Allen described the Vatican&#x27;s perspective as being somewhat skeptical of the media handling of the scandal. In addition, he asserted that the Vatican viewed American cultural attitudes toward sexuality as being somewhat hysterical as well as exhibiting a lack of understanding of the Catholic Church.

According to Allen, cultural differences between the Vatican and American Catholics complicated the process of formulating a comprehensive response to the sexual abuse scandal: &quot;there is a lot about the American culture and the American Church that puzzles people in the Vatican, and there is much about the Vatican that puzzles Americans and English speakers generally.&quot;

=====Motu Proprio &quot;Vos estis lux mundi&quot;=====

On 9 May 2019, Pope Francis issued the Motu Proprio &quot;Vos estis lux mundi&quot; requiring both clerics and religious brothers and sisters, including Bishops, throughout the world to report sex abuse cases and sex abuse cover-ups by their superiors. Under the new Motu Proprio, all Catholic dioceses throughout the world are required to establish stable mechanisms or systems through which people may submit reports of abuse or its cover-up by June 2020. All metropolitan Archdioceses are also required to send reports to the Holy See on the progress of the investigation, whether in their Archdiocese or suffragan dioceses, every 30 days and to complete the investigation within 90 days unless granted an extension. The law is effective for a three-year experimental period with a &quot;vacatio legis&quot; of 1 June 2019. According to Canon law professor Kurt Martens:

===== Rescript &quot;On the confidentiality of legal proceedings&quot; =====
On 17 December 2019, Pope Francis issued a canon law instruction &quot;On the confidentiality of legal proceedings&quot; lifting the &quot;pontifical secret&quot; in the cases relating to: violence or abuse of authority in forcing sexual acts, sexual abuse of minors or vulnerable persons, crimes of paedophilia involving children under 18 years of age or with incapacitated subjects and the concealment of those conducts from ecclesiastical or civil inquiries. Under the new provisions, are excluded from the pontifical secret all the stages of the canonical trials, from the denunciation, to the phase of the preliminary investigations, to the phase of the proper debate, and up to the final decision, as well as any witness statements and documents produced in trial. It concerns both the procedures that take place at the local level, and those that take place in Rome, at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.

The instruction provides however that the information obtain in a canonical trial be treated in such a way as to ensure its security, integrity and confidentiality with a view to protecting the good name, image and privacy of all persons involved. According to Archbishop Juan Ignacio Arrieta, Secretary of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts: &quot;the fact that knowledge of these criminal actions is no longer bound by the &quot;pontifical secret&quot; does not mean that it provides the freedom to make it public by those in possession of it, which in addition to being immoral, would undermine the right to a good reputation&quot;. Moreover, the Instruction does not in any way counter the absolute duty of the Priest to observe the sacramental seal nor the duty of observe the confidentiality of information acquired outside of confession within the whole forum called &quot;extra-sacramental&quot;.

The professional secrecy of those involved in a canonical trial should not constitute an obstacle to &quot;the fulfilment of the obligations laid down in all places by the laws of the State, including any reporting obligations [of possible news of a crime], and the execution of the enforcement requests of the civil courts&quot; which, naturally, could oblige the delivery of documentary material to the civil courts. In this regard, Giuseppe Dalla Torre, former president of the Vatican City State Tribunal, observed that:

According to Archbishop Charles Scicluna, adjunct secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the abolition of pontifical secrecy means that:
Dalla Torre underlined that this instruction is a canonical instrument which does not affect the application of the civil laws, as it regards the conduction of the trials and the cooperation with ecclesiastica authorities:

===== Response by year =====

======1962======

Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani, Secretary of the Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office, sent a letter which became known as the Crimen sollicitationis. In this letter, addressed to &quot;all Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops and other Local Ordinaries, including those of Eastern Rite&quot;, the Holy Office laid down procedures to be followed in dealing with cases of clerics (priests or bishops) of the Catholic Church accused of having used the sacrament of Penance to make sexual advances to penitents; its rules were more specific than the generic ones in the Code of Canon Law.

In addition, it instructed that the same procedures be used when dealing with denunciations of homosexual, pedophile or zoophile behaviour by clerics. It repeated the rule that any Catholic who failed for over a month to denounce a priest who had made such advances in connection with confession was automatically excommunicated and could be absolved only after actually denouncing the priest to the Ordinary of the place or to the Holy Congregation of the Holy Office, or at least promising seriously to do so.

======1983======
The Vatican promulgated a revised Code of Canon Law which included a canon (1395, §2) which explicitly named sex with a minor by clerics as a canonical crime &quot;to be punished with just penalties, not excluding dismissal from the clerical state if the case so warrants.&quot; According to De delictis gravioribus, the letter sent in May 2001 by then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (who later became Pope Benedict XVI) – Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and according to Father Thomas Patrick Doyle, who has served as an expert witness on Pontifical Canon Law, Crimen sollicitationis was in force until May 2001.

======2001======
In April, Pope John Paul II issued a letter stating that &quot;a sin against the Sixth Commandment of the Decalogue by a cleric with a minor under 18 years of age is to be considered a grave sin, or &#x27;delictum gravius.&#x27;&quot; In the letter, &quot;Sacramentorum sanctitatis tutela&quot; (Safeguarding the Sanctity of the Sacraments), &quot;§1 Reservation to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) is also extended to a delict against the sixth commandment of the Decalogue committed by a cleric with a minor below the age of eighteen years. §2 One who has perpetrated the delict mentioned in §1 is to be punished according to the gravity of the offense, not excluding dismissal or deposition.&quot; In other words, the CDF was given a broader mandate to address the sex abuse cases only from 2001 – prior to that date, the 1917 Code of Canon Law permitted sexual abuse cases by the clergy to be handled by the Congregation, for the Congregation to open cases itself, or for the Ordinary to handle judgement. All priestly sex crimes cases were placed under the CDF which, in the majority of cases, then recommended immediate action.

The &quot;Guide to Understanding Basic CDF Procedures concerning Sexual Abuse Allegations&quot; explain briefly the procedures which have been derived from the 1983 Code of Canon Law and put in place since 30 April (the same day). Among the points made:
* Every allegation of sexual abuse of a minor by a priest is investigated by the local diocese and, if there is even a &quot;semblance of truth&quot; the case is referred to the Vatican CDF. &quot;The local bishop always retains power to protect children by restricting the activities of any priest in his diocese.&quot;
* Civil law concerning reporting of crimes to the appropriate authorities should always be followed.
* The CDF may authorise the local bishop to try the case. If a priest (who has the right of appeal to the CDF) is found guilty, a number of canonical penalties are possible, including dismissal from the clerical state. &quot;The question of damages can also be treated directly during these procedures.&quot;
* Some cases can be referred directly to the Pope, who can issue a decree of dismissal from the priesthood ex officio.
* Other disciplinary measures short of dismissal are available where the priest has undertaken to live a life of prayer and penance, but he can be dismissed if he breaks the conditions imposed.
* The CDF continues to update the 2001 law (Motu Proprio Sacramentorum Sanctitatis tutela) in the light of special faculties granted to the CDF by Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI.

In May, in line with the 1983 Code of Canon Law and the 1990 Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, a letter from the CDF was sent to the Catholic bishops.

======2002======
The Vatican instituted reforms to prevent future United States abuse by requiring background checks for all church employees who have contact with children. Since then, in the US, over 2 million volunteers and employees; 52,000 clerics; 6,205 candidates for ordination have had their backgrounds evaluated.

In June, the USCCB established the &quot;Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People&quot;, a comprehensive set of procedures for addressing allegations of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy. (More details in the Episcopal Responses section above.).

======2003======
Pope John Paul II stated that &quot;there is no place in the priesthood and religious life for those who would harm the young&quot;.

In April, the Pontifical Academy for Life organized a three-day conference, entitled &quot;Abuse of Children and Young People by Catholic Priests and Religious&quot;, where eight non-Catholic psychiatric experts were invited to speak to near all Vatican dicasteries&#x27; representatives. The panel of experts overwhelmingly opposed implementation of policies of &quot;zero-tolerance&quot; such as was proposed by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. One expert called such policies a &quot;case of overkill&quot; since they do not permit flexibility to allow for differences among individual cases.

======2004======

In June, Louisville, Kentucky lawyer William McMurry filed suit against the Vatican on behalf of three men alleging abuse as far back as 1928, accusing church leaders of organizing a cover-up of cases of sexual abuse of children.

======2005======
In August, Pope Benedict was personally accused in a lawsuit of conspiring to cover up the molestation of three boys in Texas by Juan Carlos Patino-Arango in Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston. He sought and obtained immunity from prosecution as head of state of the Holy See. The Department of State &quot;recognize[d] and allow[ed] the immunity of Pope Benedict XVI from this suit.&quot; See International position of the Pope for information on head-of-state immunity of a pope.

In November, the Vatican published &quot;Criteria for the Discernment of Vocation for Persons with Homosexual Tendencies&quot;, issuing new rules which forbid ordination of men with &quot;deep-seated homosexual tendencies&quot;. While the preparation for this document had started ten years before its publication, this instruction is seen as an official answer by the Catholic Church to what was seen as a &quot;pedophile priest&quot; crisis. The US National Review Board cited the preponderance of adolescent males among the victims of clerical sexual abuse of minors in its report. The document was criticized by the National Association of Catholic Diocesan Lesbian and Gay Ministries for what some see as its implying that homosexuality is tied to the sexual abuse of children.

======2007======
Archbishop Csaba Ternyak, secretary of the Congregation for Clergy, put the following question to the experts: &quot;[T]o what degree one can talk about the rehabilitation of the offender, what are the most effective methods of treatment, and on what grounds we can say that a person who has never offended is at risk to sexually molest someone?&quot;

Ternyak spoke about the way that the crisis had damaged the priest-bishop relationship. He noted that there was a &quot;sense of gloom&quot; felt by the overwhelming majority of priests who had not been accused of any abuse but nonetheless who perceived that their bishops had turned against them and therefore had &quot;become disillusioned about the effectiveness of the laws of the Church to defend their dignity and their inalienable rights&quot;. Ternyak also noted that &quot;there have been more than a few suicides among accused priests.&quot;

======2008======
In April, during a visit to the United States, Pope Benedict XVI admitted that he was &quot;deeply ashamed&quot; of the clergy sex abuse scandal that has devastated the American church. Benedict pledged that pedophiles would not be priests in the Roman Catholic Church. Pope Benedict also apologized for child abuse scandal in Australia.

In November, the United States Court of Appeals in Cincinnati denied the Vatican&#x27;s claim of sovereign immunity, and allowed a lawsuit against the Catholic Church government by three men who claim they were sexually abused as children by priests in the Louisville, Kentucky, US archdiocese to proceed. The Vatican did not appeal the ruling.

======2009======
Two researchers reported that abuse cases had &quot;steeply declined&quot; after 1985 and that responses to abuse had changed substantially over 50 years, with suspension becoming more common than reinstatement.

In a statement, read by Archbishop Silvano Maria Tomasi at a meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva on 22 September 2009, the Holy See stated that the majority of Catholic clergy who had committed acts of sexual abuse against under-18-year-olds should not be viewed as pedophiles, but as homosexuals who are attracted to sex with adolescent males. The statement said that rather than pedophilia, &quot;it would be more correct to speak of ephebophilia; being a homosexual attraction to adolescent males ... Of all priests involved in the abuses, 80 to 90% belong to this sexual orientation minority which is sexually engaged with adolescent boys between the ages of 11 and 17.&quot;

However, Margaret Smith and Karen Terry, two researchers who worked on the John Jay Report, cautioned against equating the high incidence of abuse by priests against boys with homosexuality, calling it an oversimplification and &quot;an unwarranted conclusion&quot; to assert that the majority of priests who abused male victims are gay. Though &quot;the majority of the abusive acts were homosexual in nature ... participation in homosexual acts is not the same as sexual identity as a gay man.&quot; She further stated that &quot;the idea of sexual identity [should] be separated from the problem of sexual abuse... [A]t this point, we do not find a connection between homosexual identity and the increased likelihood of subsequent abuse from the data that we have right now.&quot; Tomasi&#x27;s move angered many gay rights organisations, who claimed it was an attempt by the Vatican to redefine the Church&#x27;s past problems with pedophilia as problems with homosexuality.

Empirical research shows that sexual orientation does not affect the likelihood that people will abuse children. Many child molesters cannot be characterized as having an adult sexual orientation at all; they are fixated on children.

======2010======
In April 2010, in response to extensive negative publicity and criticism of the Pope, the Vatican entered what the Associated Press called &quot;full damage control mode&quot;. Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican&#x27;s secretary of state, during a visit to Chile, linked the scandal to homosexuality. In response to widespread criticism of that statement, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said Bertone&#x27;s statement went outside the remit of &quot;church authorities&quot;, while maintaining that &quot;the statement was aimed at &#x27;clarifying&#x27; Cardinal Bertone&#x27;s remarks and should not be seen as the Holy See &#x27;distancing&#x27; itself from them.&quot; He also noted that 10 per cent of the cases concerned paedophilia in the &quot;strict sense&quot;, and the other 90 per cent concerned sex between priests and adolescents. Giovanni Maria Vian, editor of &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot;, the Vatican&#x27;s official newspaper, said the continuing criticism of Pope Benedict XVI and the Vatican in handling the clerical sex abuse crisis is part of a media campaign to sell newspapers. The Pope issued a statement that the &quot;Church must do penance for abuse cases&quot;.

Msgr. Charles J. Scicluna explained in an interview with the Italian newspaper &quot;Avvenire&quot;: &quot;Between 1975 and 1985 I do not believe that any cases of pedophilia committed by priests were brought to the attention of our Congregation. Moreover, following the promulgation of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, there was a period of uncertainty as to which of the &quot;delicta graviora&quot; were reserved to the competency of this dicastery. Only with the 2001 &quot;Motu Proprio&quot; did the crime of pedophilia again become our exclusive remit... In the years (2001–2010) the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) had &quot;considered accusations concerning around three thousand cases of diocesan and religious priests, which refer to crimes committed over the last fifty years.&quot;

Pope Benedict issued an apology to those who had suffered from child abuse in Ireland in March 2010. The letter stated that the Pope was &quot;truly sorry&quot; for what they had suffered, and that &quot;nothing can undo the wrong you have endured. Your trust has been betrayed and your dignity violated.&quot; Nevertheless, the letter was not enough to satisfy many critics, who felt that the letter failed to address their concerns, and mistakenly presented the abuse as an issue within the Church in Ireland, rather than acknowledging that it was a systemic problem.

In July 2010, the Vatican issued a document to clarify their position. They doubled the length of time after the 18th birthday of the victim that clergymen can be tried in a church court and to streamline the processes for removing abusive priests. However, the new rules that applied globally were criticized as being less strict than those that were already in place in the United States.

======2011======
In May, the Vatican published new guidelines, drawn up by Cardinal William Levada, the head of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, on dealing with the clergy sexual abuse cases. The guidelines tell the bishops and heads of Catholic religious orders worldwide to develop &quot;clear and coordinated&quot; procedures for dealing with the sexual abuse allegation by May 2012. The guidelines instruct the bishops to cooperate with the police and respect the relevant local laws in investigating and reporting allegations of sexual abuse by the clergy to the civic authorities, but do not make such reporting mandatory. The guidelines also reinforce bishops&#x27; exclusive authority in dealing with abuse cases. Victims advocacy groups criticized the new guidelines as insufficient, arguing that the recommendations do not have the status of church law and do not provide any specific enforcement mechanisms.

======2014======
The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors () was instituted by Pope Francis on 22 March 2014 for the safeguarding of minors. It is headed by Boston&#x27;s cardinal archbishop, Sean P. O&#x27;Malley, O.F.M. Cap.

In November 2014, Pope Francis laicized and excommunicated abusive priest Father Jose Mercau of Argentina.

======2018======
At the beginning of 2018, Francis denied overwhelming reports of widespread sexual abuse by priests in Chile. In the face of the resulting outcry, he introduced an investigation that led to every bishop in Chile submitting his resignation; only a few of these were accepted, however.

At mid-year, amidst a series of abuse scandals in many countries, including the revelation that over a 50-year period, more than 300 priests were plausibly accused of abuse in the state of Pennsylvania alone, Pope Francis spoke of his &quot;shame&quot;, without however offering concrete steps to remove abusive priests or sanction those who took part in cover-ups.

======2019======

From 21 to 24 February 2019, a four-day Catholic Church summit meeting was held in Vatican City, called the Meeting on the Protection of Minors in the Church () with the participation of the presidents of all the episcopal conferences of the world to discuss preventing sexual abuse by Catholic Church clergy.

On 26 March 2019, one month after the summit was held, Pope Francis adopted:
* Vatican Law No. CCXCVII &quot;On the protection of minors and vulnerable persons&quot;;
* the Motu Proprio &quot;On the protection of minors and vulnerable persons&quot;;
* the &quot;Guidelines of the Vicariate of Vatican City on the protection of minors and vulnerable persons&quot;.

According to Andrea Tornielli, these:
Law No. CCXCVII requiries Vatican City officials, including those in the Roman Curia, and diplomatic personnel of the Holy See, such as the Apostolic Nuncios, to report sex abuse. Failure to do so can result in a fine of up to 5,000 euros (about $5,600) or, in the case of a Vatican gendarme, up to six months in prison. In addition, all crimes related to child abuse, including mistreatment, are persecutable &quot;ex officio&quot;, even when the purported victim does not file an official report. The law also extends the statute of limitations to 20-year prescription that, in the case of and offence against a minor, begin to count from on his or her eighteenth birthday. In addition, the Governorate of the Vatican City State is required to set up, within the Vatican Department of Health and Welfare, service to support and assist the victims of abuse, providing them with medical and psychological assistance and informing them of their rights and of how to enforce them.

The motu proprio extends the application of the Vatican law to the Roman Curia and its personnel. It requires that, when recruiting staff, the candidate&#x27;s suitability to interact with minors must be ascertained.

The Guidelines for the Vicariate of Vatican City are addressed to the canons, parish priests and coadjutors of the two parishes located within the Vatican, as well as to the priests, deacons and educators of the Saint Pius X Pre-Seminary, to all the religious men and women who reside in the Vatican, and to all those who work within the ecclesiastical community of the Vicariate of Vatican City. The guidelines require that, in the course of pastoral activities, those persons must always be visible to others when they are in the presence of minors, and that it is strictly forbidden to establish a preferential relationship with a single minor, to address a minor in an offensive way or to engage in inappropriate or sexually allusive conduct, to ask a minor to keep a secret, to photograph or to film a minor without the written consent of his parents. The Vicar of Vatican City has also the obligation to report to the Promoter of Justice any news of abuse that is not manifestly unfounded, and to remove the alleged perpetrator of the abuse from pastoral activities as a precautionary measure.

===Criticisms of the church===

In 2010, the BBC reported that the major causes of the scandal were the cover-ups and other alleged shortcomings in the way in which the church hierarchy has dealt with the abuses. Particularly, the actions of Catholic bishops in responding to allegations of clerical abuse were harshly criticized.

In September 2010, Pope Benedict XVI lamented that the Roman Catholic Church had not been vigilant enough or quick enough in responding to the problem of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy. Pope Benedict laicized 400 priests for abuses in two years of his papacy. A representative of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), a group representing abuse victims, criticized the pope&#x27;s remarks as &quot;disingenuous&quot; because, in her opinion, the church had in fact been &quot;prompt and vigilant&quot; in concealing the scandal. After Benedict&#x27;s resignation in 2013, he was criticized by SNAP for allegedly protecting the church&#x27;s reputation &quot;over the safety of children&quot;. Representatives from the Center for Constitutional Rights (at the time engaged in an International Criminal Court case against Pope Benedict in which they were acting for SNAP), alleged that Pope Benedict had been directly involved in covering up some of the crimes.

====Failure to prevent current and future acts of abuse====
Mary Dispenza further states that crimes against children took place in the past, they take place now and they will continue to take place in the future unless Pope Francis and the bishops act decisively to ensure that child safety has higher priority than protecting priests and the image of the Catholic Church.

====Holy See&#x27;s denial of canonical competence====

A Vatican spokesman stated, &quot;When individual institutions of national churches are implicated, that does not regard the competence of the Holy See...The competence of the Holy See is at the level of the Holy See.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BostonGlobe11/2/1013&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing canons 331 and 333 of the &quot;1983 Code of Canon Law&quot;, James Carroll of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; asserted that &quot;On the question of how far papal authority extends, the canon law of the Catholic Church could not be clearer&quot; and alleged that the Holy See&#x27;s denial of competency contravenes canon law. Canon 331 states that &quot;The vicar of Christ... possesses full, immediate, and universal ordinary power in the Church, which he is always able to exercise freely&quot;, and canon 333 states that &quot;...By virtue of his office, the Roman pontiff not only possesses power over the universal church, but also obtains the primacy of ordinary power over all particular churches and groups of them.&quot;

Silvano Tomasi, the Holy See&#x27;s permanent observer to the U.N. stated that the Vatican was not responsible for abusive priests because &quot;priests are citizens of their own states, and they fall under the jurisdiction of their own country&quot; but the United Nations report differed claiming that since priests are &quot;bound by obedience to the pope&quot; under canon law, then the Holy See is accountable. The report also urged the Vatican to insist that priests and bishops involve the police in all abuse reports and end a &quot;code of silence&quot; leading to whistleblowers being &quot;ostracized, demoted and fired&quot;.

==== Lack of transparency in the doctrinal congregation ====
To place the cases under the competence of the Vatican&#x27;s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith has been criticized by some as making the process more secretive and lengthening the time required to address the allegations. For example, in his biography of John Paul II, David Yallop asserts that the backlog of referrals to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith for action against sexually abusive priests is so large that it takes 18 months to merely get a reply.

Vatican officials have expressed concern that the church&#x27;s insistence on confidentiality in its treatment of priestly sexual abuse cases was seen as a ban on reporting serious accusations to the civil authorities. Early in 2010 Cardinal Claudio Hummes, the head of the Congregation for Clergy, finally said that instances of sexual abuse by priests were &quot;criminal facts&quot; as well as serious sins and required co-operation with the civil justice system. Italian academic Lucetta Scaraffia described the conspiracy involved in hiding the offense as &quot;omerta&quot;, the Mafia code of silence, and said that &quot;We can hypothesise that a greater female presence, not at a subordinate level, would have been able to rip the veil of masculine secrecy that in the past often covered the denunciation of these misdeeds with silence&quot;.

Some parties have interpreted the &quot;Crimen sollicitationis&quot; – a 1962 document (&quot;Instruction&quot;) of the Holy Office (which is now called the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith) codifying procedures to be followed in cases of priests or bishops of the Catholic Church accused of having used the sacrament of Penance to make sexual advances to penitents – as a directive from the Vatican to keep all allegations of sexual abuse secret, leading to widespread media coverage of its contents. Daniel Shea, the US lawyer who found the document, said that the document &quot;proves there was an international conspiracy to hush up sex abuse issues&quot;. The Vatican responded that the document was not only widely misinterpreted, but moreover had been superseded by more recent guidelines in the 1960s and 1970s, and especially the 1983 Code of Canon Law.

====Non-removal of accused from church====
The Catholic hierarchy has been criticized for not acting more quickly and decisively to remove, laicize and report priests accused of sexual misconduct. Cardinal Roger Mahony of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, said: &quot;We have said repeatedly that ... our understanding of this problem and the way it&#x27;s dealt with today evolved, and that in those years ago, decades ago, people didn&#x27;t realize how serious this was, and so, rather than pulling people out of ministry directly and fully, they were moved.&quot;

One early opponent of the treatment of sexually abusive priests was Father Gerald Fitzgerald, the founder of The Congregation of the Servants of the Paraclete. Although Fitzgerald started the Servants of the Paraclete to assist priests who were struggling with alcohol and substance abuse problems, he soon began receiving priests who had sexually abused minors. Initially, Fitzgerald attempted to treat such priests using the same spiritual methods that he used with his other &quot;guests&quot;. However, as he grew convinced of the futility of treating sexually abusive priests, Fitzgerald came to oppose vehemently the return of sexual abusers to duties as parish priests. He wrote regularly to bishops in the United States and to Vatican officials, including the pope, of his opinion that many sexual abusers in the priesthood could not be cured and should be laicized immediately.

Eventually, Fitzgerald lost control of the Servants of the Paraclete. The center began to employ medical and psychological professionals who added psychiatry and medical treatment to the spiritual regimen of treatment favored by Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald continued to oppose these modifications to his treatment regimen until his death in 1969.

Bishop Manuel D. Moreno of Tucson, Arizona, United States repeatedly attempted to have two local abusive priests laicized and disciplined, pleading unsuccessfully in a letter of April 1997 with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to have one laicized; he was first suspended in 1990 and convicted by the church in 1997 of five crimes, including sexual solicitation in the confessional. The two were finally laicized in 2004. Bishop Moreno had been strongly criticized for failing to take action until details of his efforts became public.

In a &quot;New York Times&quot; article, Bishop Blase J. Cupich, chairman of the United States Bishops Committee for the Protection of Children and Young People, is quoted explaining why Father Fitzgerald&#x27;s advice &quot;went largely unheeded for 50 years&quot;: First, &quot;cases of sexually abusive priests were considered to be rare.&quot; Second, Father Fitzgerald&#x27;s, &quot;views, by and large, were considered bizarre with regard to not treating people medically, but only spiritually, and also segregating a whole population with sexual problems on a deserted island.&quot; And finally, &quot;There was mounting evidence in the world of psychology that indicated that when medical treatment is given, these people can, in fact, go back to ministry.&quot; This was a view which Cupich characterized as one that &quot;the bishops came to regret&quot;.

In 2010, several secular and liberal Catholics were calling for Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s resignation, citing the actions of then Cardinal Ratzinger&#x27;s blocking of efforts to remove a priest convicted of child abuse. The pope did eventually resign in 2013, although he said that he did so because of his declining health.

In 2012, William Lynn of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia was found guilty of one count of endangering the welfare of a child and sentenced to three to six years in prison. Lynn became the first United States church official to be convicted of child endangerment because of his part in covering up child sex abuse allegations by clergy.

====Secrecy among bishops====
As reported by the &quot;Boston Globe,&quot; some bishops had facilitated compensation payments to victims on condition that the allegations remained secret. For example,

In November 2009, the Irish Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse reported its findings in which it concluded that:
the Dublin Archdiocese&#x27;s pre-occupations in dealing with cases of child sexual abuse, at least until the mid 1990s, were the maintenance of secrecy, the avoidance of scandal, the protection of the reputation of the Church, and the preservation of its assets. All other considerations, including the welfare of children and justice for victims, were subordinated to these priorities. The Archdiocese did not implement its own canon law rules and did its best to avoid any application of the law of the State.

In April 2010, Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins wanted to prosecute the Pope for crimes against humanity due to what they see as his role in intentionally covering up abuse by priests. In a CNN interview a few days later, however, Dawkins declined to discuss the international crime law court&#x27;s definition of crimes against humanity, saying it is a difficult legal question.
In April 2010, a lawsuit was filed in the Milwaukee Federal Court by an anonymous &quot;John Doe 16&quot; against the Vatican and Pope Benedict XVI. The plaintiff accused Ratzinger and others of having covered up abuse cases to avoid scandal to the detriment of the concerned children.
In February 2011, two German lawyers initiated charges against Pope Benedict XVI at the International Criminal Court. As one of the reasons for the charges they referred also to the &quot;strong suspicion&quot; that Joseph Ratzinger, as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, covered up the sexual abuse of children and youths and protected the perpetrators.

Internal division became public, with Christoph Cardinal Schönborn accusing Cardinal Angelo Sodano of blocking Ratzinger&#x27;s investigation of a high-profile case in the mid-1990s.

In the trial of the French bishop Pierre Pican, who received a suspended jail sentence for failing to denounce an abusive priest, the retired Cardinal Dario Castrillon Hoyos wrote a letter to support Pican in his decision. Exposed to heavy critiques, Hoyos claimed to have had the approval of Pope John Paul II.

In 2011, Hoyos was heavily criticized again. This time, the Congregation for the Clergy was blamed of having opposed in 1997 to the newly adapted rules of the Irish bishops, demanding the denouncement of every abusive priest to the police. The Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin described the cooperation with the Congregation for the Clergy as &quot;disastrous&quot;.

An article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published 27 December 2019, accuses former American Cardinal Theodore Edgar McCarrick of paying bribes totaling US$600,000 to Pope John Paul II ($50,000) and Pope Benedict XVI ($291,000) and 100 Vatican employees to cover-up sexual misconduct accusations against him.

==Coverage==

===Media coverage===
The media coverage of Catholic sex abuse cases is a major aspect of the academic literature. In 2002, the discovery that the sex abuse by Catholic priests was widespread in the U.S. received significant media coverage. For the first 100 days, &quot;The New York Times&quot; had 225 pieces, including news and commentary, and the story appeared on its front page on 26 occasions. Walter V. Robinson, an American journalist and journalism professor, led &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; coverage of the Roman Catholic sex abuse cases, for which the newspaper won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. Robinson was also a Pulitzer Prize finalist in Investigative Reporting in 2007.

In Ireland, television journalism similarly played a key role in helping public awareness of widespread sexual abuse of children by priests. British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) produced the documentary &quot;Sex Crimes and the Vatican&quot; by a victim which included the claim that all allegations of sex abuse are to be sent to the Vatican rather than the civil authorities, and that &quot;a secret church decree called &#x27;Crimen sollicitationis&#x27; ... imposes the strictest oath of secrecy on the child victim, the priest dealing with the allegation, and any witnesses. Breaking that oath means instant banishment from the Catholic Church – excommunication.&quot; Documentary also quoted the 2005 Ferns Report.

==== Accusations of biased and excessive coverage ====

Some critics have stated that the oversaturation of Church sex abuse stories has led to the perception that the Catholic Church is more rife with pedophilia than in reality. A &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;-NBC News poll found that 64 percent of those queried thought Catholic priests &quot;frequently&quot; abused children; however, there is no data that indicates that priests commit abuse more often than the general population of males. Anglican writer Philip Jenkins supported many of these arguments stating that media coverage of the abuse story had become &quot;a gross efflorescence of anti-catholic rhetoric&quot;.

Commentator Tom Hoopes wrote that during the first half of 2002, the 61 largest newspapers in California ran nearly 2,000 stories about sexual abuse in Catholic institutions, mostly concerning past allegations. During the same period, those newspapers ran four stories about the federal government&#x27;s discovery of the much larger – and ongoing – abuse scandal in public schools. Santa Clara University professor Thomas Plante states that the extensive media attention sexual abuse in the Catholic Church has spread many myths and misconceptions, such as the belief that Catholic priests are more likely to be pedophiles than laic men in general. His research found out that the percentage of Catholic priests who sexually abuse minors is not greater than the percentages of male clergy from other religious traditions who sexually victimize minors. At the same time, he comments that the Catholic Church has historically acted in a highly defensive and arrogant manner regarding this topic, which could have provoked excessive media coverage.

====Publications====
A number of memoirs and non-fiction books have been written about these issues, including Andrew Madden&#x27;s &quot;Altar Boy: A Story of Life After Abuse&quot;, Carolyn Lehman&#x27;s &quot;Strong at the Heart: How it Feels to Heal from Sexual Abuse&quot;, Larry Kelly&#x27;s &quot;The Pigeon House&quot; which deals with abuse in the Pigeon House TB Sanatorium at Ringsend;, and Kathy O&#x27;Beirne&#x27;s bestseller &quot;Kathy&#x27;s Story&quot;, which details physical and sexual abuse suffered in a Magdalene laundry in Ireland. Writing in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Ed West has asserted that Kathy Beirne&#x27;s story is &quot;largely invented&quot;, based on Hermann Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Kathy&#x27;s Real Story&quot;, a book by the journalist on the &quot;Irish Daily Mail&quot;; Kelly is also former editor of &quot;The Irish Catholic&quot;.

====Films and documentaries====
The Magdalene laundries were the subject of a drama film called &quot;The Magdalene Sisters&quot; (2002), which generated controversy as it was early in the revelations about abuses at Catholic homes. In 2006, a documentary called &quot;Deliver Us From Evil&quot; directed by Amy Berg and produced by Berg and Frank Donner was made about sexual abuse; it primarily focused on one priest and his crimes. It showed how far some clergy went to cover up the many reports of sexual abuse. In Ireland, the documentary series, &quot;Suffer the Children&quot; (UTV, 1994), was released.

A daily updated list of films and documentaries is available at the &quot;Literature List Clergy Sexual Abuse&quot; composed by journalist and author .

====Music====
In 2005, Limp Bizkit released the album &quot;The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)&quot;, which focuses on dark lyrical subject matter, including Catholic sex abuse cases, terrorism and fame. Comedian Tim Minchin has the songs &quot;The Pope Song&quot;, and &quot;Come Home (Cardinal Pell)&quot;.

<text>The London Corresponding Society (LCS) was a federation of local reading and debating clubs that in the decade following the French Revolution agitated for the democratic reform of the British Parliament. In contrast to other reform associations of the period, it drew largely upon working men (artisans, tradesmen, and shopkeepers) and was itself organised on a formal democratic basis.

Characterising it as an instrument of French revolutionary subversion, and citing links to the insurrectionist United Irishmen, the government of William Pitt the Younger sought to break the Society, twice charging leading members with complicity in plots to assassinate the King. Measures against the society intensified in the wake of the naval mutinies of 1797, the 1798 Irish Rebellion and growing protest against the continuation of the war with France. In 1799, new legislation suppressed the Society by name, along with the remnants of the United Irishmen and their franchise organisations, United Scotsmen and the United Englishmen, with which the diminishing membership of the LCS had associated.

== Early influences and foundation of the society ==
In the last decades of the 18th century the percolation of Enlightenment thinking and the dramas of American independence and the French Revolution stimulated in Britain, as elsewhere in Europe, new clubs and societies committed to principles of popular sovereignty and constitutional government. In the north of England the Non-Conformist, principally Unitarian, currents in the new disenfranchised mill towns and manufacturing centres, supported the Society for Constitutional Information (SCI). This had been founded by, among others, Major John Cartwright, author of &quot;Take Your Choice&quot; (1776) which called for manhood suffrage, the secret ballot, annual elections and equal electoral districts.

In 1788, prominent Unitarian members of the CIS, Richard Price and Joseph Priestley among them, formed the Revolution Society. Ostensibly convened to commemorate the centennial of the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the society called for the repeal of the Corporation Act 1661 and Test Act 1673 on the grounds that &quot;the right of private judgement, liberty of conscience, trial by jury, freedom of the press and freedom of election ought ever to be held sacred and inviolable&quot;. After 1792 the radical momentum shifted from the Revolution Society back to the SCI and, more decidedly, to a new London society.

During the American Revolutionary War, Thomas Hardy, a Scottish shoemaker in London, was convinced of the American cause by the pamphlets of Dr. Richard Price, a Unitarian minister and prominent reformer. A gift of the pamphlet library of the SCI, including a reprint of a proposal from a &quot;Correspondence Committee&quot; of the Irish Volunteer movement to restore &quot;the purity and vigour&quot; of the Irish constitution through parliamentary reform, persuaded him of the need for a workingman&#x27;s reform club.

At the first meeting of his &quot;Correspondence Society&quot; on 25 January 1792, Hardy led seven friends in a discussion that determined that &quot;gross ignorance and prejudice in the bulk of the nation was the greatest obstacle to obtaining redress&quot; from the &quot;defects and abuses that have crept into the administration of our Government&quot;; and that to remove that obstacle it should be the aim of those subscribing:to instil into [the public] in a legal and constitutional way by means of the press, a sense of their rights as freemen, and of their duty to themselves and their posterity, as good citizens, and hereditary guardians of the liberties transmitted to them by their forefathers.

Hardy is said to have been distinguished in radical company by never speaking &quot;but to the purpose at hand&quot; and by his &quot;high organising ability&quot;.

In promoting the new society, Hardy and his friends rode a wave of popular political engagement lifted by the two-part publication (March 1791, February 1792) of Thomas Paine&#x27;s &quot;Rights of Man&quot;. Selling as many as a million copies, Paine&#x27;s reply to Edmund Burke in defence of the French Revolution (and of Dr. Richard Price) was &quot;eagerly read by reformers, Protestant dissenters, democrats, London craftsman, and the skilled factory-hands of the new industrial north&quot;.

== Organisation and membership ==
===Democratic structure===
From the beginning, the LCS was viewed with suspicion by the British government, and was infiltrated by spies on the government payroll. In addition to domestic subversion, the state authorities feared collaboration with French agents, against whose entry and circulation within the country they had introduced the Aliens Act 1793. Partly in response to the surveillance, and in express &quot;imitation of the societies in and about Sheffield&quot; whose cutlers had repudiated deference to Whig constitutionalists, the society adopted a decentralised, democratic structure. The LCS organised in &quot;divisions&quot; each comprising neighbourhood &quot;tithings&quot; of not more than ten members. Each division met twice a week to conduct business and discuss historical and political texts. 

In contrast to some of Whig-establishment reform clubs, the organisation allowed all subscribers to participate in open debate, and to elect members to leadership positions such as tithing-man, divisional secretary, sub-delegate, or delegate. Rules also ensured that discussion was not monopolised. Francis Place recalled that &quot;no one could speak a second time [on a subject] until every one who chose had spoken once&quot;.

The LCS issued its first public statement in April 1792. In addition to Sheffield (the &quot;Faubourg Saint Antoine to an English Revolution&quot;) sister societies existed, or by 1793 had sprung to life, in Manchester, Norwich, and Stockport.

===Social composition===
By May 1792 the LCS comprised nine separate divisions, each with a minimum of thirty members. The height of its popularity in late 1795 it may have had between 3,500 and 5000 member organised in 79 divisions In contrast to the SCI with its annual 4 guinea subscription, in levying just a penny a week the LCS opened its proceedings to workers of almost every condition. Those, however, who as independent tradesmen were not subject to the political disapproval of employers took the leading role. They were the committeemen.[John] Ashley, a shoemaker, [John] Baxter, a journeyman silvermith; [John] Binns, a plumber, John Boyne, a Holborn bookseller, Alexander Galloway, a mathematical machine- maker . . ., Thomas Evans, a colourer of prints and (later) a patent brace-maker, Richard Hodgson, a master hatter, John Lovett, a hairdresser, [John] Luffman, a goldsmith, [John] Oxlade, a master book-binder ... While the LCS remained primarily a forum for &quot;a politically conscious and articulate artisan population&quot;, men of a more prominent social and professional standing did join, drawn in many cases from existing debating societies. They brought with them important political connections and skills. Barristers such as Felix Vaughan and attorneys like Joseph Gerrald (who had practiced law in Philadelphia, and there associated with Paine) were especially useful given near continuous entanglement of members in court proceedings. Among the physicians were SCI member James Parkinson, a prolific propagandist, and John Gale Jones, an accomplished orator. But the Society&#x27;s egalitarian constitution accorded them no definitive preference. Hardy in particular was wary of placing them in positions of authority lest ordinary members be discouraged from &quot;exerting themselves in their own cause&quot;.

=== Male fraternity ===
Women participated in some of popular debating societies from which the LCS recruited. For short periods they created their own, bringing to public notice demands for equal education, equal rights and protection of female occupations. While it counted among its members men like Thomas Spence and Dr William Hodgson (&quot;The Female Citizen&quot;) who did advocate political rights and equality for women, the LCS appears to have been a male fraternity. The venues in which its divisions met – taverns and coffee houses – were predominantly male spaces, and reference to women in records of their proceedings are few.

In August 1793, the Society&#x27;s General Committee approved a motion calling for the formation of a female Society of Patriots. By September, a government spy reported that there was a Society of Women meeting in Southwark. The LCS arranged to send two of its delegates to instruct them. But it does not appear that female patriots were ever admitted as members to the LCS itself. Women did turn out for major LCS demonstrations.

===Noted members===
The society had an early celebrity recruit, the ex-slave, free West-Indian black and abolitionist, Olaudah Equiano. In 1791–92, Equiano was touring the British Isles with his autobiography, &quot;The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa the African&quot;. Drawing on abolitionist networks he brokered connections for the LCS, including what may have been the society&#x27;s first contacts with the United Irishmen. In Belfast (where civic outrage had defeated plans to commission vessels for the Middle Passage) Equiano was hosted by the leading United Irishman, publisher of their Painite newspaper the &quot;Northern Star&quot;, Samuel Neilson.

Paine subscribed to the Society; as did the radical poet William Blake; Joseph Ritson the noted antiquarian and founder of modern vegetarianism; and Basil William Douglas, Lord Daer, who held concurrent membership of the Society for Constitutional Information and the Scottish Association of the Friends of the People.

===London&#x27;s sans-culottes===
Despite such notables, the government were assured by their most trusted informer, &quot;&#x27;Citizen&#x27; Groves&quot;, that the real body of the club was made of &quot;the very lowest order of society&quot;. They took little persuading that within the LCS English Jacobins were leading on the equivalent to the sans-culottes of the revolutionary Paris sections. Some of the working class membership did take the republican doctrines of Paine to their extreme, posing the claims of an absolute political democracy against those of monarchy and aristocracy.

Of these radical democrats, the most renowned was Thomas Spence. Originally from Newcastle, where he had protested the enclosure of commons, Spence re-issued as &quot;The Real Rights of Man&quot; a penny pamphlet he had produced in 1775, &quot;Property in Land Every One&#x27;s Right&quot;. His vision was of a society based on common ownership of land administered democratically, by men and women alike, at the parish level. In 1797, in response to Thomas Paine&#x27;s &quot;Agrarian Justice,&quot; he wrote &quot;The Rights of Infants&quot; which, in the course of vindicating the right of children to freedom from want and abuse, proposed an unconditional and universal basic income.

==Political equality not social &quot;levelling&quot;==
From the outset, the LCS contended with the charge that a &quot;full and equal representation of the people&quot; in Parliament represented a &quot;levelling&quot; of all distinctions of rank and property. This was delivered, and (with considerable Church and aristocratic patronage) circulated widely, in a short three-penny pamphlet &quot;Village Politics: Addressed to All the Mechanics, Journeymen, and Day Labourers in Great Britain&quot; (1793). Written by Hannah More as &quot;Burke for Beginners&quot;, it is an imagined conversation in which a mason learns from a blacksmith that to declare for &quot;Liberty and Equality&quot; is to associate with &quot;levellers&quot; and &quot;republicans&quot;, rogues who hide from him the simple truth that if everyone is digging potatoes on their half acre no one would be available to mend his broken spade.

Against this onslaught, the LCS produced &quot;An Explicit Declaration of the Principles and View of the L.C.S&quot;. But for having to address the &quot;frantic&quot; notions of &quot;alarmists&quot;, it claimed that those who would &quot;restore the House of Commons to a state of independence&quot; would never even conceive &quot;so wild and detestable a sentiment&quot; as &quot;the equalization of property&quot;. We know and are sensible that the Wages of every an are his Right; that Difference of Strength, of Talents, and of Industry, do and ought to afford proportional Distinction of Property, which, when acquired and confirmed by the Laws, is sacred and inviolable.The LCS did not pronounce on social questions, confident that key to addressing inequities lay in reform of the constitution. It was sufficient to observe that it was from the &quot;partial, unequal, and therefore inadequate Representation, together with the corrupt method in which Representatives are elected;&quot; that &quot;oppressive Taxes, unjust Laws, restrictions of Liberty, and wasting of the Public Money, have ensued.&quot;

==The Conventions and Pitt&#x27;s &quot;Reign of Terror&quot;==
===The first Edinburgh Convention===
At the end of November 1792 the LCS published an &quot;Address of the London Corresponding Society to the other Societies of Great Britain, united for obtaining a Reform in Parliament&quot; expressing confidence in the prospects for obtaining a reformed, democratic franchise through &quot;moral force&quot;. A national convention was called for Edinburgh in December.

The LCS delegates&#x27; host in the Scottish capital, and perhaps the most radical delegate present, Thomas Muir of the Society of the Friends of the People, himself said nothing that was not strictly constitutional. An address which he presented from the United Irishmen (largely drawn up by William Drennan) was made acceptable to the Convention only by redacting any suggestion of &quot;Treason or Misprison of Treason against the Union [of Scotland] with England&quot;. Beginning with the title &quot;Convention&quot;, and including an oath to &quot;live free or die&quot;, the &quot;imitation of French forms&quot; did cause the authorities some alarm. Minor prosecutions were instituted.

===The Edinburgh treason trials===
By the time LCS delegates attended their second reform convention in Edinburgh in October 1793, the political climate had changed dramatically. From 1 February 1793 the Crown was at war with the new French Republic. Any association with Paris or defence of its policies, foreign or domestic, was now regarded as treasonable. In May 1793 the House of Commons refused by 282 votes to 41 even to consider petitions asking for reform.

At a time when reformers were beginning to mobilise a broad swath of opinion in Britain in favour of a reformed Parliament and a strictly constitutional monarchy, they were being forced, by their early embrace of the French revolution, to defend policies in France they did not advocate at home: the execution of the king and of regime opponents, the confiscation of the property of the Church and nobility. Against the institution of the Terror, the French Republic paid no heed to the entreaties in Paris of Thomas Muir or, from his place in the French National Convention, of Thomas Paine.

After Muir returned to Scotland, he was charged with treason. Although the prosecutorial evidence amounted to little more than a presentation of his political views, in August 1793 a jury of landlords upheld the charge and Muir was sentenced to 14 years transportation. Convicted of sedition, the same fate befell the secretary of a second Edinburgh convention in October, 1793, William Skirving, and the two LCS delegates.

Joseph Gerrald and LCS chairman Maurice Margarot had been elected as delegates to the convention by the LCS&#x27;s first open-air meeting, attended by some 4,000 persons in a field off the Hackney Road. Gerrald had published earlier in the year &quot;A Convention the Only Means of Saving Us from Ruin.&quot; With ancient precedents sought in the Anglo-Saxon &quot;mycelgemot&quot; (popular assemblies) and &quot;wittengamot&quot; (delegated representatives), the pamphlet&#x27;s laid out a three-stage sequence, from local gatherings to regional delegations to national convention. There was the scarcely disguised suggestion that such a convention would have a representative legitimacy greater than the corrupted, unreformed Parliament.

As the son of a wine importer, Margarot (who alone survived to return to England in 1810) had continental connections, including residence in Paris during the first year of the revolution. These allowed the authorities to draw upon him the suspicion of being a French spy.

===The London treason trials===

The weight of repression substantially reduced popular societies in the provinces. In London, Hardy and Margarot&#x27;s successor as chairman, John Baxter, undaunted, had drawn up addresses to &quot;the friends of peace and parliamentary reform&quot; and to &quot;His Majesty&quot; calling for an end to the war against France. Prime Minister, William Pitt, responded by having the papers of the London societies seized and examined by a secret committee of the House of Commons.

In May 1794, hard on the committee&#x27;s &quot;Report on Radical and Reform Societies&quot;, charges of treason were laid against thirty leading radicals including Hardy, Thomas Spence, the dramatist Thomas Holcroft, the poet, public lecturer and journalist John Thelwall, and sometime parliamentary candidate John Horne Tooke. Their trials in November misfired. The juries in London were not as ready as those in Edinburgh to accept the mere expression of political opinion as evidence of plots against King and Parliament. When the evidence running to four printed volumes failed to impress in the case of Hardy, the courts were unable to take seriously the charges against his associates: Horne Tooke jeered at the Attorney-General and clowned in the dock, and the Lord Chief Justice slept through the prosecution&#x27;s summary against Thelwall.

The process did deliver Hardy a blow: during his trial his wife was attacked in their home by a loyalist &quot;Church and King mob&quot; and subsequently died in childbirth. On his release, Hardy did not return to his position in the Society.

Beginning in the course of these trials further arrests were made. Paul Thomas LeMaitre, John Smith, George Higgins and Dr. Robert Thomas Crossfield, were indicted as accomplices in the so-called &quot;Popgun Plot&quot;, an alleged conspiracy to assassinate King George III by means of a poison dart fired from an airgun. In May 1796, their cases similarly collapsed. 

The reformers were not allowed to celebrate their victory. The LCS bookseller John Smith provocatively renamed his shop &quot;The Pop Gun&quot;, and sold a pamphlet that explained that the government required three instruments: 1) soldiers (&quot;by profession slaughterers&quot;), 2) clergymen (who &quot;hallow with the sanction of Divinity state robbery&quot;), and 3) lawyers (who &quot;thrive on misery&quot; and are the &quot;tyrants of property&quot;). He was given two years hard labour on bread and water for seditious libel.

In advance of the treason trials, habeas Corpus had been suspended and six members of the Society detained, including Thomas Spence. Invoking the presence of &quot;a traitorous and detestable conspiracy ... formed for subverting the existing laws and constitution, and for introducing the system of anarchy and confusion which has so fatally prevailed in France&quot;, in May 1794 Parliament had allowed the Privy Council to direct detentions &quot;any law or statute to the contrary notwithstanding&quot;

==Radicalisation and dissolution==
===The final rally===
In the summer of 1795, weariness with the war combined with failed harvests to trigger renewed protest—including an attack on the Prime Minister&#x27;s residence in Downing Street. The Society was growing again: from 17 divisions in March to 79 in October. General Meetings were attended by tens of thousands.

The LCS called a &quot;monster meeting&quot; for 26 October 1795 at Copenhagen Fields, Islington. Veteran reformers Joseph Priestley, John Thelwall and Charles James Fox, joined Hardy&#x27;s successor as LCS secretary John Ashley (another shoemaker); chairman John Binns (a plumber&#x27;s labourer), John Gale Jones (surgeon), and William Duane (Irish-American editor of &quot;The Telegraph&quot;) in addressing crowds estimated at upwards of 200,000. 

For the Society, Binns and Ashley declared that should the British nation, in the face of &quot;the continuation of the present detestable War, the horrors of an approaching Famine, and above all, the increased Corruption, and Inquisitorial measures, demand strong and decisive measures&quot;, the London Corresponding Society would be &quot;the powerful organ&quot; ushering in &quot;joyful tidings of peace ... universal suffrage and annual parliaments&quot;. Three days later, George III, in procession to the state Opening of Parliament, had the windows of his carriage smashed by crowd shouting &quot;No King, No Pitt, No war&quot;. 

===The &quot;Gagging Acts&quot;===
Seizing upon this incident, and in response to their earlier humiliation in the courts, the government introduced the so-called &quot;Gagging Acts&quot; of 1795. The Seditious Meetings Act 1795 and the Treason Act 1795 made writing and speaking as much treason as overt acts, and made inciting hatred of the government a &quot;high misdemeanour&quot;. They also required licences for public meetings, lectures and reading rooms. These restrictions, with the encouragement given to magistrates to use public order powers to close taverns and bookshops regarded as centres of radical activity, wound down the Society&#x27;s extensive publishing programme—some eighty separate pamphlets and broadsides and two periodicals —and, in general, &quot;hamstrung&quot; its propaganda activity.

The rally in LCS membership and activity in the summer of 1795 was brief. The problem was not alone Pitt&#x27;s &quot;reign of terror&quot;.

===The fall of Paine===
As an immediate leader of popular opinion there had been no rival to Paine. But following the purge and mass execution of the Girondins in June 1793, in France Paine found himself a prisoner of the revolution he had defended. In prison, and prior to an obscure American exile, he had produced his second great work, published in 1796 and 1797. &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; submitted the Christian bible and churches to the same type of deconstructive logical analysis that &quot;The Rights of Man&quot; had applied to the monarchy and aristocracy. The social historian G. D. H. Cole noted that only &quot;the broadest-minded Unitarian could tolerate it, and the dissenters [the Non-Conformists] who till then had been consistent if timid recruits to the reform movement, were henceforth as horrified as the bishops themselves&quot;.

Already in 1795 disgruntled Methodists had withdrawn from the LCS to form the Friends of Religious and Civil Liberty. Prominent among them was Richard Lee, a bookseller reputedly expelled from the LCS for refusing to stock Paine&#x27;s newest work and yet subsequently prosecuted for publishing the regicidal handbill &quot;King Killing&quot;, and Edward Iliff&#x27;s &quot;A summary of the duties of citizenship, written expressly for the members of the London Corresponding Society&quot;.

===United Britons===
The government&#x27;s closure of peaceful avenues for reform agitation, and the prospect of French assistance, encouraged a radical rump to consider the threat implicit in the Copenhagen Fields address: to achieve universal male suffrage and annual parliaments by physical force. In this, they were supported by the United Irishmen. In the summer of 1797, following the Spithead and Nore mutinies, in which the government had been quick to see the hand of radical societies, the Irish priest James Coigly arrived from Manchester. In Manchester Goigly and a cotton spinner from Belfast, James Dixon, had helped convert the town&#x27;s Corresponding Society into the republican, United Englishmen. Bound by a test that promised to &quot;Remove the diadem and take off the crown ... [and to] exalt him that is low and abuse him that is high&quot;. the United men went on to organise in Stockport, Bolton, Warrington and Birmingham. Like the United Scotsmen. in their constitutions the new societies were &quot;direct copies of the United Irishmen&quot;. 

Presenting himself as an emissary of the United Irish executive in Dublin, Coigly met with leading members of the LCS, among them the Irishmen Edward Despard, the brothers Benjamin and John Binns, William Henry Hamilton, and Alexander Galloway who had succeeded as the Society&#x27;s chairman when, in protest against the violent turn in rhetoric, Francis Place resigned. Meetings were held at Furnival&#x27;s Inn, Holborn, where United delegates from London, Scotland and the regions were reported to have committed themselves &quot;to overthrow the present Government, and to join the French as soon as they made a landing in England&quot; (in December 1796 only weather had prevented a major French landing in Ireland).

In March 1798 Coigly was arrested in a party with O&#x27;Connor, Benjamin Binns, and John Allen at Margate just as they were to embark for France. Found on his person was an address (composed by Dr. Crossfield) to the French Directory from the &quot;United Britons&quot;. While its suggestion of a mass movement primed for insurrection had been scarcely credible, it was sufficient proof of the intent to invite and encourage a French invasion. Coigly was hanged in June.

===Turn against United conspiracy, and final suppression===
On 30 January 1798, the LCS had issued an Address to the United Irishmen, declaring that &quot;If to Unite in the Cause of Reform upon the Broadest Basis be Treason ... We, with you, are Traitors&quot;. Yet the disillusionment with France was widespread and by the time of Coigly&#x27;s arrest the majority view was that the entire business of coordinating with the Directory and the United Irish was a destructive diversion. The Central Committee of Delegates suspected that the government exaggerated the threat of a French invasion, but agreed that in the event members would join their local, government-approved, militias.

On 19 April 1798, just as this was being resolved in a pub in Drury Lane, the committee was raided by the police. Together with parallel raids on corresponding societies in Birmingham and Manchester, a total of 28 persons were arrested, among them Thomas Evans, Edward Despard, John Bone, Benjamin Binns, Paul Le Maitre, Richard Hodgson and Alexander Galloway. The next day, Pitt renewed the suspension of habeas corpus absolving the government of the need to present evidence of complicity in Coigly&#x27;s mission. The prisoners were held without charge until hostilities with France were (temporarily) halted with the Treaty of Amiens in 1801.

According to Francis Place (who, for the good name of the LCS and the reform movement as a whole, had threatened to inform on United conspirators) this stroke extinguished the society. Members made no attempt to meet again, not even in any division and abandoned their delegates. A final act of Parliament, the Unlawful Societies Act 1799 (39 Geo. 3. c. 79), &quot;for the more effectual suppression of societies established for seditious and treasonable Purposes; and for better preventing treasonable and seditious practices&quot;, referenced and banned the LCS by name, along with the United Englishmen, the United Scotsmen, the United Britons, and the United Irishmen.

Despard, who had protested a betrayal of the United Britons as &quot;dishonourable&quot;, was executed for treasonable association with their remnants—the so-called Despard Plot—in 1803.

== Legacy ==
In &quot;The Making of the English Working Class&quot; (1963), in which he proposes to &quot;rescue the poor stockinger, the Luddite cropper, the &#x27;obsolete&#x27; hand-loom weaver, [and] the &#x27;utopian&#x27; artisan ... from the enormous condescension of posterity&quot;, E. P. Thompson identified the London Corresponding Society as a key incident in the emergence of a &quot;working-class consciousness&quot; in England. It was a waypoint in the developing sense among English working people that they have &quot;an identity of interests as between themselves, and as against other men whose interests are different from (and usually opposed to) theirs&quot;. At the same time, it is suggested that the LCS demonstrated, as Hardy had wished, that the working class was &quot;capable of civility, rational thought, informed debate, and peaceable assembly&quot;.

These were achievements that prefigured and contributed to the popular agitation that secured passage of the 19th century Reform parliamentary bills. Francis Place survived to be active in the agitation for the first of these, the Reform Act 1832. In 1839, Place was invited by the London Working Men&#x27;s Association to become one of the London delegates to the National Convention of what might be considered as the &quot;industrial&quot; working-class continuity of the Correspondence movement of the 1790s, the Chartists.

<doc id="158936" wikidata="Q1229735" url="?curid=158936" title="Cover-up">
<text>A cover-up is an attempt, whether successful or not, to conceal evidence of wrongdoing, error, incompetence, or other embarrassing information. Research has distinguished personal cover-ups (covering up one&#x27;s own misdeeds) from relational cover-ups (covering up someone else&#x27;s misdeeds).

The expression is usually applied to people in positions of authority who abuse power to avoid or silence criticism or to deflect guilt of wrongdoing. Perpetrators of a cover-up (initiators or their allies) may be responsible for a misdeed, a breach of trust or duty, or a crime.

== Definitions and related terms ==
While the terms are often used loosely, &quot;cover-up&quot; involves withholding incriminatory evidence, while &quot;whitewash&quot; involves releasing misleadingly exculpatory evidence, and a &quot;frameup&quot; involves falsely blaming an innocent person. Misprision is the failure of mandated reporters to disclose crimes they are aware of (e.g., a military officer failing to proactively report evidence of treason, or a hospital failing to report child abuse).

A cover-up involving multiple parties is a type of conspiracy.

&quot;Snowjob&quot; is an American and Canadian colloquialism for deception or a cover-up; for example, Helen Gahagan Douglas described the Nixon Administration as &quot;the greatest snow job in history&quot;.

==Modern usage==

When a scandal breaks, the discovery of an attempt to cover up the truth is often regarded as even more reprehensible than the original deeds.

Initially, a cover-up may require a lot of effort, but it will be carried out by those closely involved with the misdeed. Once some hint of the hidden matter starts to become known, the cover-up gradually draws all the top leadership, at least, of an organization into complicity in covering up a misdeed or even crime that may have originally been committed by a few of its members acting independently. This may be regarded as tacit approval of that behaviour.

It is likely that some cover-ups are successful, although by definition this cannot be confirmed. Many fail, however, as more and more people are drawn in and the possibility of exposure makes potential accomplices fearful of supporting the cover-up and as loose ends that may never normally have been noticed start to stand out. As it spreads, the cover-up itself creates yet more suspicious circumstances.

The original misdeed being covered may be relatively minor, such as the &quot;third-rate burglary&quot; which started the Watergate scandal, but the cover-up adds so many additional crimes (obstruction of justice, perjury, payoffs and bribes, in some cases suspicious suicides or outright murder) that the cover-up becomes much more serious than the original crime. This gave rise to the phrase, &quot;it&#x27;s not the crime, it&#x27;s the cover-up&quot;.

Cover-ups do not necessarily require the active manipulation of facts or circumstances. Arguably the most common form of cover-up is one of non-action. It is the conscious failure to release incriminating information by a third party. This passive cover-up may be justified by the motive of not wanting to embarrass the culprit or expose them to criminal prosecution, or even the belief that the cover-up is justified by protecting the greater community from scandal. Yet, because of the passive cover-up, the misdeed often goes undiscovered and results in harm to others ensuing from its failure to be discovered. 

Real cover-ups are common enough, but any event that is not completely clear is likely to give rise to a thicket of conspiracy theories alleging covering up of sometimes the weirdest and most unlikely conspiracies.

==Typology==

The following list is considered to be a typology since those who engage in cover-ups tend to use many of the same methods of hiding the truth and defending themselves. This list was compiled from famous cover-ups such as the Watergate Scandal, the Iran-Contra Affair, My Lai Massacre, the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;, the cover-up of corruption in New York City under Boss Tweed (William M. Tweed and Tammany Hall) in the late 19th century, and the tobacco industry cover-up of the health hazards of smoking. The methods in actual cover-ups tend to follow the general order of the list below.

; Initial response to allegation

# Flat denial
# Convince the media to bury the story
# Preemptively distribute false information
# Claim that the &quot;problem&quot; is minimal

# Attack the critic&#x27;s motive
# Attack the critic&#x27;s character

; Withhold or tamper with evidence

# Prevent the discovery of evidence
# Destroy or alter the evidence
# Make discovery of evidence difficult
# Create misleading names of individuals and companies to hide funding
# Lie or commit perjury
# Block or delay investigations
# Issue restraining orders
# Claim executive privilege

; Delayed response to allegation

# Deny a restricted definition of wrongdoing (e.g. torture)
# Limited hang out(i.e., confess to minor charges)
# Use biased evidence as a defense
# Claim that the critic&#x27;s evidence is biased
# Select a biased blue ribbon commission or &quot;independent&quot; inquiry

; Intimidate participants, witnesses or whistleblowers
# Bribe or buy out the critic
# Generally intimidate the critic by following him or her, killing pets, etc.
# Blackmail: hire private investigators and threaten to reveal past wrongdoing (&quot;dirt&quot;)
# Death threats of the critic or his or her family
# Threaten the critic with loss of job or future employment in industry
# Transfer the critic to an inferior job or location
# Intimidate the critic with lawsuits or SLAPP suits
# Murder; assassination

; Publicity management

# Bribe the press
# Secretly plant stories in the press
# Retaliate against hostile media
# Threaten the press with loss of access
# Attack the motives of the press
# Place defensive advertisements
# Buy out the news source

; Damage control

# Claim no knowledge of wrongdoing
# Scapegoats: blame an underling for unauthorized action
# Fire the person(s) in charge

; Win court cases

# Hire the best lawyers
# Hire scientists and expert witnesses who will support your story
# Delay with legal maneuvers
# Influence or control the judges

; Reward cover-up participants

# Hush money
# Little or no punishment
# Pardon or commute sentences
# Promote employees as a reward for cover-up
# Reemploy the employee after dust clears

== In criminal law ==
Depending on the nature of cover-up activities, they may constitute a crime in certain jurisdictions. 

Perjury (actively telling lies to the court, as opposed to refusing to answer questions) is considered a crime in virtually all legal systems. Likewise, obstruction of justice, that is, any activity that aims to cover-up another crime, is itself a crime in many legal systems. 

The United States has the crime of making false statements to a federal agent in the context of any matter within the federal jurisdiction, which includes &quot;knowingly and willfully&quot; making a statement that &quot;covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact&quot;.

== Examples ==
* The Dreyfus Affair
* Armenian genocide denial
* Katyn massacre
* The Iran–Contra affair
* The Luzhniki disaster
* The Chernobyl disaster
* The My Lai Massacre
* The Roman Catholic sex abuse cases of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.
* The Watergate scandal
* Russian doping scandals
* Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal

== Alleged cover-ups ==
Conspiracy theories generally include an allegation of a cover-up of the facts of some prominent event. Examples include:

* John F. Kennedy assassination
* TWA Flight 800 conspiracy theories 
* Korean Air Lines Flight 007 alternate theories
* M/S &quot;Estonia&quot;
* New World Order
* Pusztai affair
* Roswell incident
* September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks
* Attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi
* UFOs in general
* Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal, 2012
* Mamasapano clash
*Death of Jeffrey Epstein
*Origin of COVID-19
*2022 Nord Stream pipeline sabotage
*2023 Ohio train derailment

<text>Carver Dana Andrews (January 1, 1909 – December 17, 1992) was an American film actor who became a major star in what is now known as film noir and later in Western films. A leading man during the 1940s, he continued acting in less prestigious roles and character parts into the 1980s. He is best known for his portrayal of obsessed police detective Mark McPherson in the noir mystery &quot;Laura&quot; (1944) and his critically acclaimed performance as World War II veteran Fred Derry returning home in &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (1946).

== Early life ==
Andrews was born on a farmstead near Collins, (county seat town of Covington County), in southern Mississippi, the third of 13 children of Charles Forrest Andrews, a Baptist minister, and his wife, Annis (&quot;née&quot; Speed). The family subsequently relocated west to Huntsville, Texas, the birthplace of his younger siblings, including fellow Hollywood actor Steve Forrest (born William Forrest Andrews, 1925-2013).

Andrews attended college at Sam Houston State University nearby in Huntsville and studied business administration in Houston. During 1931, he traveled to the West Coast to Los Angeles, California to pursue opportunities as a singer. He worked various jobs, such as at a gas refueling station in the nearby community of Van Nuys. To help the struggling Andrews study music at night, &quot;The station owners stepped in ... with a deal: $50 a week for full-time study, in exchange for a five-year share of possible later earnings&quot;, which he started repaying after signing with Goldwyn. The founder of the Hollywood Community Theater, Neely Dickson, disputed the gas station story, saying it was invented by Samuel Goldwyn Studio publicists and that Andrews was discovered at her theater. &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; also attempted to debunk the story.

== Career ==
=== Sam Goldwyn and 20th Century Fox ===
In 1938, Andrews was spotted in the play &quot;Oh Evening Star&quot; and Samuel Goldwyn (c.1879/1882-1974), signed the promising actor to a contract, but felt he needed time to develop experience. Andrews continued at the Pasadena Playhouse of Pasadena, California, working in over 20 productions and proposed to his second wife Mary Todd. After twelve months, Goldwyn sold part of Andrews&#x27; contract to 20th Century-Fox, where he was put to work on the first of two B pictures; his first role was in &quot;Lucky Cisco Kid&quot; (1940). He then appeared in &quot;Sailor&#x27;s Lady&quot; (1940), developed by Goldwyn, but released by Twentieth Century-Fox.

Andrews was loaned to Edward Small to appear in the Western film / bio-pic &quot;Kit Carson&quot; (1940), before Goldwyn used him for the first time in a Goldwyn studio production of director William Wyler&#x27;s &quot;The Westerner&quot; (1940), featuring Gary Cooper.

Andrews had supporting roles in subsequent Twentieth Century-Fox films &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; (1941), directed by John Ford; then also &quot;Belle Starr&quot; (1941), co-starring with Randolph Scott and Gene Tierney, billed third; and &quot;Swamp Water&quot; (1941), starring Walter Brennan and Walter Huston and directed by Jean Renoir.

His next film for Goldwyn was the Howard Hawks directed comedy &quot;Ball of Fire&quot; (1941), again teaming with Gary Cooper, with Andrews playing the villain, a gangster.

=== Leading man ===
Back at Fox, Andrews was given his first lead, in the B-picture war movie &quot;Berlin Correspondent&quot; (1942). He was second lead to Tyrone Power in &quot;Crash Dive&quot; (1943) and then appeared as a lynching target in the 1943 film adaptation of &quot;The Ox-Bow Incident&quot; with Henry Fonda, giving a performance that Bosley Crowther of the New York Times called &quot;heart-wringing,&quot; writing that Andrews &quot;does much to make the picture a profoundly distressing tragedy.&quot;

Andrews then went back to Goldwyn for &quot;The North Star&quot; (1943), directed by Lewis Milestone. He worked on a government propaganda film &quot;December 7th: The Movie&quot; (1943), then was used by Goldwyn again in &quot;Up in Arms&quot; (1944), supporting Danny Kaye.

Andrews was reunited with Milestone at Fox for &quot;The Purple Heart&quot; (1944), then was in &quot;Wing and a Prayer&quot; (1944) for Henry Hathaway.

=== Critical success and noir ===
One of his roles was as a detective infatuated with a presumed murder victim, played by Gene Tierney, in &quot;Laura&quot; (1944), produced at Fox and directed by Otto Preminger. He co-starred with Jeanne Crain in the movie musical &quot;State Fair&quot; (1945), a huge hit, and was reunited with Preminger for the film noir &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; (1945). Andrews made another war movie with Milestone, &quot;A Walk in the Sun&quot; (1945), then was loaned to Walter Wanger for a western, &quot;Canyon Passage&quot; (1946), directed by Jacques Tourneur and co-featuring Susan Hayward.

Andrews&#x27; second film with William Wyler, also for Goldwyn, became his best known: &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (1946). It was both a popular and critical success. Upon release, the topical film about American society&#x27;s problems in re-integrating military veterans after World War II outgrossed the longstanding box office success of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939) in the U.S. and Britain. In 2007, the film ranked number 37th on AFI&#x27;s Top 100 Years...100 Movies.

Andrews appeared in &quot;Boomerang!&quot; (1947), directed by Elia Kazan; &quot;Night Song&quot; (1947), at RKO; and &quot;Daisy Kenyon&quot; (1947) for Preminger. In 1947, he was voted the 23rd most popular actor in the U.S.

Andrews starred in the anti-communist &quot;The Iron Curtain&quot; (1948), reuniting him with Gene Tierney, then &quot;Deep Waters&quot; (1948). He made a comedy for Lewis Milestone at Enterprise Pictures, &quot;No Minor Vices&quot; (1948), then traveled to England for &quot;Britannia Mews&quot; (1949). Andrews was in &quot;Sword in the Desert&quot; (1949), then Goldwyn cast him in &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot; (1949) with Susan Hayward. He played a fast-fisted police officer in the film noir &quot;Where the Sidewalk Ends&quot; (1950), also with Tierney and Preminger. Around this time, alcoholism began to damage Andrews&#x27;s career, and on two occasions it nearly cost him his life behind the wheel.

&quot;Edge of Doom&quot; (1950), another film noir for Goldwyn, was a flop. Andrews was then loaned to RKO to make &quot;Sealed Cargo&quot; (1951), in which his brother Steve Forrest has an uncredited role. (In a &quot;Word of Mouth&quot; commentary for Turner Classic Movies, Forrest stated, &quot;I&#x27;d have given my eye teeth to have worked with him.&quot;) Back at Fox, Andrews was in &quot;The Frogmen&quot; (1951), then Goldwyn cast him in &quot;I Want You&quot; (1951), an overwrought attempt to repeat the success of &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;, during the Cold War era Korean War&quot;.&quot;

From 1952 to 1954, Andrews was featured in the radio series &quot;I Was a Communist for the FBI&quot;, about the experiences of Matt Cvetic, an FBI informant who infiltrated the Communist Party of the United States of America.

=== Career decline ===
Andrews&#x27; film career waned in the 1950s. &quot;Assignment: Paris&quot; (1952) was not widely seen. He made &quot;Elephant Walk&quot; (1954) in Ceylon, a film better known for Vivien Leigh&#x27;s nervous breakdown and replacement by Elizabeth Taylor. &quot;Duel in the Jungle&quot; (1954) was an adventure tale, &quot;Three Hours to Kill&quot; (1954) and &quot;Smoke Signal&quot; (1955) were Westerns, &quot;Strange Lady in Town&quot; (1955) was a Greer Garson vehicle, and &quot;Comanche&quot; (1956) another Western.

By the mid-1950s, Andrews was acting almost exclusively in B-movies. However, his acting in two late-cycle film noirs for Fritz Lang during 1956, &quot;While The City Sleeps&quot;, &quot;Beyond a Reasonable Doubt&quot;, and a horror film, &quot;Curse of the Demon&quot; (1957), and a noir, &quot;The Fearmakers&quot; (1958), for Jacques Tourneur, are well regarded. Around this time, he also appeared in &quot;Spring Reunion&quot; (1957), &quot;Zero Hour!&quot; (1957) and &quot;Enchanted Island&quot; (1958).

In 1952, Andrews toured with his wife, Mary Todd, in &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;, and in 1958, he replaced Henry Fonda (his former co-star in &quot;The Oxbow Incident&quot; and &quot;Daisy Kenyon&quot;) on Broadway in &quot;Two for the Seesaw&quot;.

=== Television ===
Andrews began appearing on television on such shows as &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; (&quot;Right Hand Man&quot;, &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot;), &quot;General Electric Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Barbara Stanwyck Show&quot;, &quot;Checkmate&quot;, &quot;The DuPont Show of the Week&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (&quot;No Time Like the Past&quot;), &quot;The Dick Powell Theatre&quot;, &quot;Alcoa Premiere&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, and &quot;Theatre of Stars&quot;.

Andrews continued to make films like &quot;The Crowded Sky&quot; (1960) and &quot;Madison Avenue&quot; (1961). He then went to Broadway for &quot;The Captains and the Kings&quot;, which had a short run in 1962.

In 1963, he was elected president of the Screen Actors Guild.

In 1965, Andrews resumed his film work with support roles in &quot;The Satan Bug&quot; and &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot;. Although he had the lead in films such as &quot;Crack in the World&quot; (1965), &quot;Brainstorm&quot; (1965), and &quot;Town Tamer&quot; (1965), he was increasingly cast in supporting roles: &quot;Berlin, Appointment for the Spies&quot; (1965), &quot;The Loved One&quot; (1965), &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot; (1965), and &quot;Johnny Reno&quot; (1966). He occasionally played leads in low-budget films like &quot;The Frozen Dead&quot; (1966), &quot;The Cobra&quot; (1967) and &quot;Hot Rods to Hell&quot; (1967), however, by the late 1960s he had evolved into a character actor, as in &quot;The Ten Million Dollar Grab&quot; (1967), &quot;No Diamonds for Ursula&quot; (1967), and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Brigade&quot; (1968).

By the end of the decade, Andrews returned to television to play the leading role of college president Tom Boswell on the NBC daytime soap opera &quot;Bright Promise&quot; from its premiere on September 29, 1969, until March 1971.

=== Later career ===
Andrews spent the 1970s in supporting roles of Hollywood films such as &quot;The Failing of Raymond&quot; (1971), &quot;Innocent Bystanders&quot; (1972), &quot;Airport 1975&quot; (1974), &quot;A Shadow in the Streets&quot; (1975), &quot;The First 36 Hours of Dr. Durant&quot; (1975), &quot;Take a Hard Ride&quot; (1975), &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot; (1976), &quot;The Last Hurrah&quot; (1977), and &quot;Good Guys Wear Black&quot; (1978)

He also appeared regularly on TV in such shows as &quot;Ironside&quot;, &quot;Get Christie Love!&quot;, &quot;Ellery Queen&quot;, &quot;The American Girls&quot;, &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot;, and &quot;The Love Boat&quot;.

It was at this time, the 1970s, that Andrews became involved in the real estate business, telling one newspaper reporter, for example, that he owned &quot;a hotel that brings in $200,000 a year.&quot;

Andrews&#x27;s final roles included &quot;Born Again&quot; (1978), &quot;Ike: The War Years&quot; (1979), &quot;The Pilot&quot; (1980), &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; (1982–83) and &quot;Prince Jack&quot; (1985).

== Personal life ==
Andrews married Janet Murray on December 31, 1933. Murray died less than two years later in October 1935 as a result of pneumonia. Their son, David, was later a radio announcer and musical director who himself died early from a cerebral hemorrhage in February 1964 at the age of 30. Four years after the death of his first wife Janet Murray, on November 17, 1939, Andrews married stage actress Mary Todd (born June 8,1916 in Santa Monica, California-January 17, 2003, in California), who later guest-starred in 1976 on &quot;The Bob Braun Show&quot;, a talk show on local television station WCPO-TV (channel 9), in Cincinnati, Ohio, 1967-1984. The couple had three children: Katharine, Stephen, and Susan, in addition to earlier son David from his first marriage.

Andrews struggled with alcoholism but eventually won the battle and worked actively later with the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, using his experience as a teaching tool. Several years later, during 1972, he appeared in a television public service advertisement concerning the subject of alcohol abuse. During the last years of his life, Andrews also suffered from senility / dementia factors of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, which was increasingly occurring in the elder American population with scientific research then in its infancy. He spent his final years living at the John Douglas French Center for Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease in Los Alamitos, (Orange County), California.

On December 17, 1992, Andrews died of congestive heart failure and pneumonia, at the age of 83 years old. His wife Mary Todd Andrews died a decade later in January 2003 at the age of 86 years old, noted in the entertainment magazine / newspaper &quot;Variety&quot;, the following month.

<text>The Teapot Dome scandal was a political corruption scandal in the United States involving the administration of President Warren G. Harding. It centered on Interior Secretary Albert Bacon Fall, who had leased Navy petroleum reserves at Teapot Dome in Wyoming, as well as two locations in California, to private oil companies at low rates without competitive bidding. The leases were the subject of an investigation by Senator Thomas J. Walsh. Convicted of accepting bribes from the oil companies, Fall became the first presidential cabinet member to go to prison, but no one was convicted of paying the bribes.

Before the Watergate scandal, Teapot Dome was regarded as the &quot;greatest and most sensational scandal in the history of American politics&quot;. It permanently damaged the reputation of the Harding administration, already hurt by its handling of the Great Railroad Strike of 1922 and Harding&#x27;s 1922 veto of the Bonus Bill. 

Congress subsequently passed permanent legislation granting itself subpoena power over tax records of any U.S. citizen, regardless of position. These laws are also considered to have empowered Congress generally.

==History==

To ensure that the Navy would always have enough fuel, President Taft designated several oil-producing areas as naval oil reserves. In 1921, President Harding issued an executive order to transfer control of Teapot Dome Oil Field in Natrona County, Wyoming, and the Elk Hills and Buena Vista Oil Fields in Kern County, California, from the Navy Department to the Department of the Interior. This was not implemented until the next year, when Interior Secretary Fall persuaded Navy Secretary Edwin C. Denby to implement the order.

Later in 1922, Fall leased oil production rights at Teapot Dome to Harry F. Sinclair of Mammoth Oil, a subsidiary of Sinclair Oil Corporation. He also leased the Elk Hills reserve to Edward L. Doheny of Pan American Petroleum and Transport Company. Both leases were issued without competitive bidding; leasing without bids was legal under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920.

The lease terms were very favorable to the oil companies, and secret transactions associated with the two deals made Fall a rich man. He received a no-interest loan from Doheny of $100,000
in November 1921 (equivalent to $ million in ). He received other gifts from Doheny and Sinclair totaling about $404,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). While the leases were legal, these transactions were not. Fall attempted to keep them secret, but a sudden improvement in his standard of living raised suspicions. He paid up his ranch taxes, for example, which had been as much as 10 years past due. Carl Magee, who later founded &quot;The Albuquerque Tribune&quot;, wrote about this sudden affluence and also brought it to the attention of the Senate investigation.

==Investigation and outcome==

In April 1922, a Wyoming oil operator wrote to his senator, John B. Kendrick, angered that Sinclair had been given a contract to the lands in a secret deal. Kendrick did not write back to the man, but two days later on April 15, he introduced a resolution calling for an investigation of the deal. In March 1923, the U.S. Senate launched their first investigation into Teapot Dome. Republican Senator Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin led an investigation by the Senate Committee on Public Lands. At first, La Follette believed Fall was innocent. However, his suspicions were aroused after his own office in the Senate Office Building was ransacked.

Democrat Thomas J. Walsh of Montana, the most junior minority member, led a lengthy inquiry. For two years, Walsh pushed forward while Fall stepped backward, covering his tracks as he went. No evidence of wrongdoing was initially uncovered, as the leases were legal enough, but records kept disappearing mysteriously. By 1924, the remaining unanswered question was how Fall had become so rich so quickly and easily.

Harding-era U.S. Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty and others in the Harding Administration were implicated by Alien Property Custodian Thomas W. Miller for pressuring him to deposit funds in the Midland National Bank, which Daugherty&#x27;s brother Mally &quot;Mal&quot; S. Daugherty served as president of, when Daughterty refused to investigate the Teapot Dome Scandal. On January 17, 1927, in the &quot;McGrain v. Daugherty&quot; ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a contempt conviction against Mally Daughterty which was related to a contempt citation which was issued against him in 1924. for his refusal to cooperate with a U.S. Senate committee investigating his brother&#x27;s failures to prosecute the perpetrators in the Teapot Dome Scandal. However, the Supreme Court decision to uphold Mal&#x27;s contempt conviction would also result in the Midland Bank case against Daugherty passing into history.

Money from the bribes had gone to Fall&#x27;s cattle ranch and investments in his business. Finally, as the investigation was winding down with Fall apparently innocent, Walsh uncovered a piece of evidence Fall had failed to cover up: Doheny&#x27;s $100,000 loan to Fall. This discovery broke open the scandal. Civil and criminal suits related to the scandal continued throughout the 1920s. In 1927, the Supreme Court ruled that the oil leases had been corruptly obtained. The Court invalidated the Elk Hills lease in February 1927, and the Teapot Dome lease in October. Both reserves were returned to the Navy.

In 1929, Fall was found guilty of accepting bribes from Doheny. Conversely, in 1930, Doheny was acquitted of paying bribes to Fall. Further, Doheny&#x27;s corporation foreclosed on Fall&#x27;s home in the Tularosa Basin of New Mexico, because of &quot;unpaid loans&quot; that turned out to be that same $100,000 bribe. Sinclair served six months in jail on a charge of jury tampering.

Although Fall was to blame for this scandal, Harding&#x27;s reputation was permanently sullied because of his involvement with people associated to it. Evidence proving Fall&#x27;s guilt only arose after Harding&#x27;s death in 1923.

The Teapot Dome oil field was idle for 49 years following the scandal, but went back into production in 1976. After Teapot Dome had earned over $569 million in revenue from the of oil extracted over the previous 39 years, the Department of Energy in February 2015 sold the oil field for $45 million to New York–based Stranded Oil Resources Corp.

==Legacy==
The scandal had occurred before Calvin Coolidge became president after Harding&#x27;s death, and the investigations increased his reputation for honesty. Coolidge easily won the 1924 United States presidential election.

The Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;McGrain v. Daugherty&quot; (1927) for the first time explicitly established that Congress had the power to compel testimony.

In response to the scandal, the Revenue Act of 1924 gave the chairman of the United States House Committee on Ways and Means the right to obtain the tax records of any taxpayer. The Federal Corrupt Practices Act, which regulates campaign finance, was strengthened in 1925.

A reference to Teapot Dome was made in season 3 episode 1 of the Showtime TV series “Yellowjackets,&quot; with a high school character unable to recall any details of the scandal.

==Comparison==

The Teapot Dome scandal has historically been regarded as the worst such scandal in the United States – the &quot;high water mark&quot; of cabinet corruption. It is often used as a benchmark for comparison with subsequent scandals. In particular it has been compared to the Watergate scandal, in which a cabinet member, Attorney General John N. Mitchell, went to prison, the second time in American history that a member of the cabinet has been incarcerated. During the first Trump administration, news outlets compared alleged misconduct by members of the Trump cabinet, and specifically by Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, to the Teapot Dome scandal.

<text>Vurt is a 1993 science fiction novel written by British author Jeff Noon. The debut novel for both Noon and small publishing house Ringpull, it went on to win the 1994 Arthur C. Clarke Award and was later listed in &quot;The Best Novels of the Nineties&quot;.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Vurt&quot; tells the story of Scribble and his &quot;gang&quot;, the Stash Riders, as they search for his missing sister Desdemona. The novel is set in an alternate version of Manchester, England, in which society has been shaped by Vurt, a hallucinogenic drug/shared alternate reality, accessed by sucking on colour-coded feathers. Through some (never explained) mechanism, the dreams, mythology, and imaginings of humanity have achieved objective reality in the Vurt and become &quot;real&quot;.

Before the novel begins, Scribble and his sister take a shared trip into a vurt called English Voodoo, but upon awakening Scribble finds his sister has disappeared. Out of that trip comes an amorphous semi-sentient blob which Mandy, a fellow Stash Rider, nicknames &quot;The Thing from Outer Space&quot;. From that point on, Scribble is on a mission to find a rare and contraband Curious Yellow feather so that he might find his sister.

==Characters==
* Scribble – the protagonist and first-person narrator
* Desdemona – Scribble&#x27;s sister
* Beetle – the driver, muscle, and unofficial leader of the Stash Riders
* Bridget – shadowgirl, fellow Stash Rider, Beetle&#x27;s lover, and powerful psychic
* Mandy – the newest addition to the Stash Riders
* The Thing From Outer Space – a creature from the Vurt-world
* Game Cat – the maestro, the near mythical being who knows and shares the inside info in his &quot;Game Cat&quot; periodical

==Literary significance and reception==
&quot;Vurt&quot; achieved both critical and commercial success, attracting praise from the science fiction community as well as the literary arena. It has been stylistically compared to William Gibson&#x27;s cyberpunk novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, as well as Anthony Burgess&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;.

In &quot;High Anxieties&quot;, a book exploring the modern concept of addiction, Scribble is used as an example of a character who has traded addiction for a chance at transcendence. Brodie &quot;et al.&quot; liken Scribble&#x27;s incorporation of Vurt technology into his biological body as a metaphor for the revelation potentially gained through drug use. They point out that the exchange rate between the real and the Vurt is tempered by Hobart&#x27;s Constant, or &quot;H&quot;—which is &quot;not incidentally&quot;, Brodie argues, &quot;slang for heroin.&quot;

The book has attracted criticism due to its implausible science and &quot;wild and kaleidoscopic&quot; yet unsatisfying plot. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; felt &quot;Vurt&quot; was undeserving of receiving the 1994 Arthur C. Clarke Award, saying the book&#x27;s &quot;sentimental incest and adolescent self-congratulation ... is never really startling or disturbing.&quot;

==Allusions and references==
Jeff Noon says &quot;Vurt&quot; originally began as an adaptation of Octave Mirbeau&#x27;s &quot;The Torture Garden&quot;, an anti-authoritarian novel written at the turn of the 20th century. Noon, recently exposed to virtual reality technology by the magazine Mondo 2000, depicts the torture garden as a virtual world. Noon also credits Joseph Campbell&#x27;s book &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; for inspiring the narrative structure of &quot;Vurt&quot;.

The character of Desdemona is based on the character of the same name from William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Othello&quot;.
The Curious Yellow feather is a possible allusion to the 1967 Swedish film &quot;I Am Curious (Yellow)&quot;, which uses non-linear narrative structures and postmodern techniques like the novel. It might also be a reference to computer worms (the Vurt is riddled with virtual reality serpents which propagate from game to game, like computer worms replicate themselves by hijacking computer programs).

&quot;Vurt&quot; has been described as a retelling of Orpheus&#x27; visit to the Underworld. Orpheus and Scribble are both poets and musicians, and each attempts to rescue their idealised lovers from an alternate reality. As Joan Gordon points out, cyberspace represents &quot;the underside of the human condition&quot; and therefore the journey to virtual reality is comparable to the mythic journey to commune with the dead. In addition, the myth of Orpheus, like &quot;Vurt&quot;, explores what it means to be human in relation to the non-human; Orpheus encountered the dead, and Scribble the virtual simulations created by computers.

There are multiple allusions to stories by Lewis Carroll, such as a club the main character walks into, referred to as the Slithy Tove, which is a quote from Carroll&#x27;s poem, Jabberwocky.

==Adaptations==

===Comic books===
There have been a few comic adaptations of the novel, including &quot;Vurt – The Comic Remix&quot;, with art by Lee O&#x27;Connor.

===Games===
In August 2015, Ravendesk Games conducted a Kickstarter campaign, successfully funding a tabletop role-playing game version of &quot;Vurt&quot;. The campaign reached its goal in only ten days, suggesting an ongoing public awareness and cult-like fondness for the novel. Featuring all-new material by Jeff Noon himself, the RPG was officially released in October 2017 to critical praise.

===Film and television===
Although Noon began the screenplay for the film version of &quot;Vurt&quot; in 2002, with Iain Softley scheduled to direct, in 2005 he stated on his public website that &quot;Of the Vurt film, all has gone silent at the moment. Don&#x27;t hold your breath.&quot;

In 2018, Netflix optioned the rights to &quot;Vurt&quot; from Ravendesk Entertainment to create a television series, the pilot for which was written by &quot;Stranger Things&quot; writer/producer, Paul Dichter; however, after more than two years in development, the series was never greenlit for production.

===Stage===
In 2000, Liam Steel directed &quot;Vurt: The Theatre Remix&quot;, which ran for three weeks at Contact Theatre in Manchester.

==20th anniversary edition==
In 2013, 20th anniversary edition of the novel was published, featuring three new stories and a foreword by Lauren Beukes.

<text>In academic publishing, a preprint is a version of a scholarly or scientific paper that precedes formal peer review and publication in a peer-reviewed scholarly or scientific journal. The preprint may be available, often as a non-typeset version available free, before or after a paper is published in a journal.

==History==
Since 1991, preprints have increasingly been distributed electronically on the Internet, rather than as paper copies. This has given rise to massive preprint databases such as arXiv and HAL (open archive) etc. to institutional repositories. The sharing of preprints goes back to at least the 1960s, when the National Institutes of Health circulated biological preprints. After six years the use of these Information Exchange Groups was stopped, partially because journals stopped accepting submissions shared via these channels. In 2017, the Medical Research Council started supporting citations of preprints in grant and fellowship applications, and Wellcome Trust started accepting preprints in grant applications.

In February 2017, a coalition of scientists and biomedical funding bodies including the National Institutes of Health, the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust launched a proposal for a central site for life-sciences preprints. In February 2017, SciELO announced plans to set up a preprints server – SciELO Preprints. In March 2017, the National Institutes for Health issued a new policy encouraging research preprint submissions. In April 2017, Center for Open Science announced that it will be launching six new preprint archives. At the end of the 2010s, libraries and discovery tools increasingly integrate Unpaywall data, which indexes millions of preprints and other green open access sources and manages to serve over half of the requests by users without the need for subscriptions.

During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for published research on the disease spurred a wave of research articles being released as preprints, bypassing the peer-review and publication process, which was proving too slow in the context of an active and novel pandemic. The release of COVID-related preprint articles, along with other COVID-related articles published by traditional journals, contributed to the largest ever single-year increase in scholarly articles.

==Role==
===Academic practices===
Publication of manuscripts in a peer-reviewed journal often takes weeks, months or even years from the time of initial submission, owing to the time required by editors and reviewers to evaluate and critique manuscripts, and the time required by authors to address critiques. The need to quickly circulate current results within a scholarly community has led researchers to distribute documents known as preprints, which are manuscripts that have yet to undergo peer review. The immediate distribution of preprints allows authors to receive early feedback from their peers, which may be helpful in revising and preparing articles for submission. Preprint are also used to demonstrate the precedence of the discoveries and a way to protect the intellectual property (a prompt availability of the discovery can be used to block patenting or discourage competing parties).

Most publishers allow work to be published to preprint servers before submission. A minority of publishers decide on a case-by-case basis or interpret the Ingelfinger Rule to disqualify from submission. Yet, many journals prohibit or discourage the use of preprints in the references as they are not considered as credible sources.

Some journal-independent review services (Peerage of Science, Peer Community In, Review Commons, eLife Preprint Review) offer peer review on preprints. These peer-reviews are either a first step before publication in a journal (Peerage of Science, Review Commons, eLife Preprint Review) or result in a formal editorial decision (Peer Community In) without precluding submission in journals.

===Stages of printing===
While a preprint is an article that has not yet undergone peer review, a postprint is an article which has been peer reviewed in preparation for publication in a journal. Both the preprint and postprint may differ from the final published version of an article. Preprints and postprints together are referred to as e-prints or eprints.

The word reprint refers to hard copies of papers that have already been published; reprints can be produced by the journal publisher, but can also be generated from digital versions (for example, from an electronic database of peer-reviewed journals), or from eprints self-archived by their authors in their institutional repositories.

===Tenure and promotion===
In academia, preprints are not likely to be weighed heavily when a scholar is evaluated for tenure or promotion, unless the preprint becomes the basis for a peer-reviewed publication.

Some important results in mathematics have been published only on the preprint server arXiv. After nearly a century of effort by mathematicians, Grigori Perelman published a series of preprint papers on the arXiv between 2002 and 2003, in which he presented a proof of the Poincaré conjecture. He was offered both the $1 million Millennium Prize and the Fields Medal for the result, but he declined both prizes.

=== Advantages of preprints ===
The advantages of preprints can be summarized as: prompt dissemination of outcomes, contributes to free flow of information, increase chances of early feedback and comments, increase number of citations, chances of academic collaborations, make authors enthusiastic, may reduce predatory publishing, increases transparency, may publish negative outcomes and controversies, may receive DOI, link to ORCID, plagiarism check, chance to receive grants and awards, promotion of young researchers, early credit, good place for hypothesis, and early detection of science misconduct.

=== Disadvantages of preprints ===
The disadvantages of preprints could be summarized as: lack of peer-review, absence of quality (in controversy), concerns about premature data, media coverage not properly presenting the inherent uncertainty of preprints, risk of double citation (by publishing a peer-reviewed article, the preprint may also be cited), lack of ethical and statistical guidelines, lack of respect for COPE or ICMJE guidelines, breach of intellectual property regulations in some countries, possible harm to health in certain cases, information overload, breach of Ingelfinger rule (a strategy conducted to discourage dissemination of research reports before they are published in the journal), rush to post low-quality research.

== Types of preprint servers ==
The preprint servers can be grouped in three categories: general (accepting practically all preprints, frequently with bias towards some topic, publisher e.g. Authorea), field-specific (e.g. bioRxiv, ChemRxiv) and regional (e.g. AfricArxiv, Arabixiv). Additionally, preprints can be categorised by the owner (private publishing company e.g. &quot;PeerJ PrePrints,&quot; libraries e.g. EarthArXiv, universities e.g. arXiv or independent non-profit organisations e.g. HAL). While many preprint servers appeared, some had been terminated. The canceled servers were operated mainly by profit publishing companies (e.g. Nature Publishing Group closed Nature Precedings or O&#x27;Reilly&amp;SAGE closed PeerJ PrePrints) or were regional (e.g. INArxiv limited to Indonesia). Moreover, multiple writing platforms (e.g. Authorea) developed separate preprint servers as a part of their service. For more complete list (over 60 preprints servers) see: List of preprint repositories.

<text>CiteSeerX (formerly called CiteSeer) is a public search engine and digital library for scientific and academic papers, primarily in the fields of computer and information science.

CiteSeer&#x27;s goal is to improve the dissemination and access of academic and scientific literature. As a non-profit service that can be freely used by anyone, it has been considered part of the open access movement that is attempting to change academic and scientific publishing to allow greater access to scientific literature. CiteSeer freely provided Open Archives Initiative metadata of all indexed documents and links indexed documents when possible to other sources of metadata such as DBLP and the ACM Portal. To promote open data, CiteSeerX shares its data for non-commercial purposes under a Creative Commons license.

CiteSeer is considered a predecessor of academic search tools such as Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search. CiteSeer-like engines and archives usually only harvest documents from publicly available websites and do not crawl publisher websites. For this reason, authors whose documents are freely available are more likely to be represented in the index.

CiteSeer changed its name to ResearchIndex at one point and then changed it back.

== History ==

=== CiteSeer and CiteSeer.IST ===
CiteSeer was created by researchers Lee Giles, Kurt Bollacker and Steve Lawrence in 1997 while they were at the NEC Research Institute (now NEC Labs), Princeton, New Jersey, US. CiteSeer&#x27;s goal was to actively crawl and harvest academic and scientific documents on the web and use autonomous citation indexing to permit querying by citation or by document, ranking them by citation impact. At one point, it was called ResearchIndex.

CiteSeer became public in 1998 and had many new features unavailable in academic search engines at that time. These included:
* Autonomous Citation Indexing automatically created a citation index that can be used for literature search and evaluation.
* Citation statistics and related documents were computed for all articles cited in the database, not just the indexed articles.
* Reference linking, allowing browsing of the database using citation links.
* Citation context showed the context of citations to a given paper, allowing a researcher to quickly and easily see what other researchers have to say about an article of interest.
* Related documents were shown using citation and word based measures, and an active and continuously updated bibliography is shown for each document.

CiteSeer was granted a United States patent # 6289342, titled &quot;Autonomous citation indexing and literature browsing using citation context&quot;, on September 11, 2001. The patent was filed on May 20, 1998, and has priority to January 5, 1998. A continuation patent (US Patent # 6738780) was filed on May 16, 2001, and granted on May 18, 2004.

After NEC, in 2004 it was hosted as CiteSeer.IST on the World Wide Web at the College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University, and had over 700,000 documents. For enhanced access, performance and research, similar versions of CiteSeer were supported at universities such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Zürich and the National University of Singapore. However, these versions of CiteSeer proved difficult to maintain and are no longer available. Because CiteSeer only indexes freely available papers on the web and does not have access to publisher metadata, it returns fewer citation counts than sites, such as Google Scholar, that have publisher metadata.
CiteSeer had not been comprehensively updated since 2005 due to limitations in its architecture design. It had a representative sampling of research documents in computer and information science but was limited in coverage because it was limited to papers that are publicly available, usually at an author&#x27;s homepage, or those submitted by an author. To overcome some of these limitations, a modular and open source architecture for CiteSeer was designed – CiteSeerX.

=== CiteSeerX ===
CiteSeerX replaced CiteSeer and all queries to CiteSeer were redirected. CiteSeerX is a public search engine and digital library and repository for scientific and academic papers, primarily with a focus on computer and information science. However, recently CiteSeerX has been expanding into other scholarly domains such as economics, physics and others. Released in 2008, it was loosely based on the previous CiteSeer search engine and digital library and is built with a new open source infrastructure, SeerSuite, and new algorithms and their implementations. It was developed by researchers Isaac Councill and C. Lee Giles at the College of Information Sciences and Technology, Pennsylvania State University. It continues to support the goals outlined by CiteSeer to actively crawl and harvest academic and scientific documents on the public web and to use a citation inquiry by citations and ranking of documents by the impact of citations. Currently, Lee Giles, Prasenjit Mitra, Susan Gauch, Min-Yen Kan, Pradeep Teregowda, Juan Pablo Fernández Ramírez, Pucktada Treeratpituk, Jian Wu, Douglas Jordan, Steve Carman, Jack Carroll, Jim Jansen, and Shuyi Zheng are or have been actively involved in its development. Recently, a table search feature was introduced. It has been funded by the National Science Foundation, NASA, and Microsoft Research.

CiteSeerX continues to be rated as one of the world&#x27;s top repositories, and was rated number 1 in July 2010. It currently has over 6 million documents with nearly 6 million unique authors and 120 million citations.

CiteSeerX also shares its software, data, databases and metadata with other researchers, currently by Amazon S3 and by rsync. Its new modular open source architecture and software (available previously on SourceForge but now on GitHub) is built on Apache Solr and other Apache and open source tools, which allows it to be a testbed for new algorithms in document harvesting, ranking, indexing, and information extraction.

CiteSeerX caches some PDF files that it has scanned. As such, each page includes a DMCA link which can be used to report copyright violations.

== Current features ==

=== Automated information extraction ===
CiteSeerX uses automated information extraction tools, usually built on machine learning methods such ParsCit, to extract scholarly document metadata such as title, authors, abstract, citations, etc. As such, there are sometime errors in authors and titles. Other academic search engines have similar errors.

=== Focused crawling ===
CiteSeerX crawls publicly available scholarly documents primarily from author webpages and other open resources, and does not have access to publisher metadata. As such, citation counts in CiteSeerX are usually less than those in Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search who have access to publisher metadata.

=== Usage ===
CiteSeerX has nearly one million users worldwide based on unique IP addresses and has millions of hits daily. Annual downloads of document PDFs were nearly 200 million for 2015.

=== Data ===
CiteSeerX data is regularly shared under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license with researchers worldwide and has been and is used in many experiments and competitions.

Thanks to its OAI-PMH endpoint, CiteSeerX is an open archive and its content is indexed like an institutional repository in academic search engines, for instance BASE and Unpaywall consumers.

== Other SeerSuite-based search engines ==
The CiteSeer model had been extended to cover academic documents in business with SmealSearch and in e-business with eBizSearch. However, these were not maintained by their sponsors. An older version of both of these could be once found at BizSeer.IST but is no longer in service.

Other Seer-like search and repository systems have been built for chemistry, ChemXSeer and for archaeology, ArchSeer. Another had been built for robots.txt file search, BotSeer. All of these are built on the open source tool SeerSuite, which uses the open source indexer Lucene.

<doc id="158950" wikidata="Q6746739" url="?curid=158950" title="Managing Urban America">
<text>Managing Urban America (first published in 1979) is a book that provides an academic overview and introduction to local urban planning and management in the United States, written by David R. Morgan, Robert E. England and John Peter Pelissero.

The book is divided into four parts (following the introductory material):
*&quot;The Environment of Urban Management&quot;
*&quot;Making and Implementing Urban Policy&quot;
*&quot;Internal Management Processes&quot;
*&quot;The Urban Future&quot;

The publishers claim that the book is &quot;the dominant&quot; textbook in its field, and it is used in well over a hundred college classes, as well as being cited in professional journals.

==Individualism and government==
In recent editions, the book stipulates that groups have urged decentralization and citizen participation. It emphasizes an important need for individuals to exercise a greater degree of control over local services and facilities, and ask how much democracy really exists in the United States. The book states that the U.S. is entering an executive era, and legislatures are increasingly writing laws in broad terms which allow a great deal of flexible interpretation by those who implement the laws.

The authors claim that &quot;until recently, many assumed that city governments would continue to grow and prosper&quot;. A report from the International City Management Association had suggested that the inevitability of growth was so widely accepted that it functioned as fact. At the time, the concept of virtually endless growth was common, both from the perspective of commercial land development, and from planners seeking to facilitate such growth.

==Fiscal issues==
Federal aid began to shrink in the 1970s. Later, between 1980 and 1987, under Reagan&#x27;s New federalism, federal aid dropped 55%, while cuts were made to government-funded services and tax rates were increased. Cities were now left on their own in a new era of &quot;fend-for-yourself federalism&quot;. City tax bases started shrinking as poverty remained high, while employment opportunities were limited.

The authors claim that fiscal stress produces dissatisfaction that leads to the public&#x27;s disenchantment with elected officials. Noting the rapid deterioration of the public infrastructure, they predict a possible long-term decline, due not to a lack of resources, but an inability to use existing resources efficiently or effectively. They conclude that, in order to solve the problem, government must be transformed, and draw a connection between the complications caused by bureaucratic disputes within the various agencies of government, and the resulting problems faced by cities.

Morgan and England sought comments from various officials on their views of cities and urban decay — such as Sidney J. Barthelemy, mayor of New Orleans, who responded by saying that &quot;cities are seen as hopeless places.&quot; Michael White, mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, commented, &quot;Cities are becoming a codename for crumbling neighborhoods.&quot; John Herbers said, &quot;The failure of Washington and the states is a major reason some urban areas continue in distress.&quot;

Morgan and England suggests that wealthy have moved out of the cities, leaving only those who are so poor they cannot leave. This is known as urban exodus. The authors note, &quot;Many local officials frequently object to what they feel are excessive restrictions accompanying federal grants. Officials view the grant process as complex, overly detailed, slow, cumbersome and ineffective.&quot;

Former Flint, Michigan city manager Brian Rapp and community development director Frank Patitucci believe, &quot;The most important consequence of overregulation is excessive administrative costs. If the man-hours required for federal reporting and accounting could be devoted to running programs, performance could be improved immeasurably.&quot;

Knoxville mayor Victor Ashe: &quot;Congress has decided that it can impose anything that it wants. It&#x27;s going to drive us all into bankruptcy.&quot; The authors thus argue that political accountability is reduced because citizens are confused about which government is responsible for which activities.

The status quo usually carries the day. Off-budget enterprises have placed the Detroit government into the hands of businesses.

As an example, in 1976 the regional council for the Oklahoma City metropolitan area (ACOG) received 90% of its funds from the federal government, but by 1988 this had dropped to 24%.

===View on Urban Political Structure===

Managing Urban America affirms that Americans want governmental change and that the government favors some groups and puts others at a disadvantage. Throwing the rascals out might not be enough. Basic institutions have to be changed. The problem of corruption has been compounded by the political machine. Through political organization, those holding office have found it possible to perpetuate themselves in power.

The book urges that politics should be based on public rather than on private motives and should stress honesty.

It suggests that the modern reform movement is not a product of the working-class but of upper-income and business groups who seek a political climate favorable to their growth and economic development. These are not true social reformers, however; they are interested in perpetuating the political agenda of the business community. Edward Banfield and James Q. Wilson both add, &quot;Government must become more democratic.&quot;

Putting legislation on the ballot through a referendum is an attempt to make local government more responsive to the people. The same is true of the recall process, whereby a petition can force a new election. The initiative enables electors to force a public vote on an amendment or ordinance. Skeptics feel that voters are not well enough informed to vote intelligently. A recent International City Management Association survey showed strong support for direct democracy.

===Scrutiny on Urban Policymaking===

The literature suggests America is in the midst of a new age of skepticism regarding government. Some argue that an effective policy can be produced only through a small elite group while others worry about popular participation, but most agree that policymaking is vital to a community&#x27;s well-being.

Morgan and England fear politicians tend to see themselves not as people required to respond to group demands but as people who once elected, may pursue their own agendas. Business interests are likely to fall into this category, the authors contend.

The discretion of administrative officials can be enormous, and the authors see government as gravitating towards policies with more immediate payoffs while avoiding those that require long-term planning.

According to Robert Salisbury, &quot;A mayor is the head of locally oriented economic interests. City managers, like mayors and council-members, are overwhelmingly white males. The typical manager has been at his job for over 5 years and has served as an executive for over 10 years. In cities over 50,000 population, the city manager is likely to earn over $110,000.&quot;

==Editions==
There have been six editions of the book. The 5th edition ( (paperback)) was printed in 1999. The 6th edition () was published in 2007. The editions are updates; no chapters have been added or deleted.

<text>New Urbanism is an urban design movement that promotes environmentally friendly habits by creating walkable neighbourhoods containing a wide range of housing and job types. It arose in the United States in the early 1980s, and has gradually influenced many aspects of real estate development, urban planning, and municipal land-use strategies. New Urbanism attempts to address the ills associated with urban sprawl and post-WW II suburban development.

New Urbanism is strongly influenced by urban design practices that were prominent until the rise of the automobile prior to World War II; it encompasses basic principles such as traditional neighborhood development (TND) and transit-oriented development (TOD). These concrete principles emerge from two organizing concepts or goals: building a sense of community and the development of ecological practices.

New Urbanists support regional planning for open space; context-appropriate architecture and planning; adequate provision of infrastructure such as sporting facilities, libraries and community centres; and the balanced development of jobs and housing. They believe their strategies can reduce traffic congestion by encouraging the population to ride bikes, walk, or take the train. They also hope to increase the supply of affordable housing and rein in suburban sprawl. The &quot;Charter of the New Urbanism&quot; also covers issues such as historic preservation, safe streets, green building, and the redevelopment of brownfield land. The ten Principles of Intelligent Urbanism also phrase guidelines for New Urbanist approaches.

Architecturally, New Urbanist developments are often accompanied by New Classical, postmodern, or vernacular styles, although that is not always the case. The movement&#x27;s principles are reflected in the field of Complementary architecture.

==Background==
New Urbanism began to solidify in the 1970s and 80s with the urban visions and theoretical models for the reconstruction of the &quot;European&quot; city proposed by architect Léon Krier, and the pattern language theories of Christopher Alexander. The term &quot;new urbanism&quot; itself started being used in this context in the mid-1980s, but it wasn&#x27;t until the early 1990s that it was commonly written as a proper noun capitalized.

In 1991, the Local Government Commission, a private nonprofit group in Sacramento, California, invited architects Peter Calthorpe, Michael Corbett, Andrés Duany, Elizabeth Moule, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, Stefanos Polyzoides, and Daniel Solomon to develop a set of community principles for land use planning. Named the &quot;Ahwahnee Principles&quot; (after Yosemite National Park&#x27;s Ahwahnee Hotel), the commission presented the principles to about one hundred government officials in the fall of 1991, at its first Yosemite Conference for Local Elected Officials.

In 2009, co-founders Elizabeth Moule, Hank Dittmar, and Stefanos Polyzoides authored the Canons of Sustainable Architecture and Urbanism to clarify and detail the relationship between New Urbanism and sustainability. The Canons are &quot;a set of operating principles for human settlement that reestablish the relationship between the art of building, the making of community, and the conservation of our natural world&quot;. They promote the use of passive heating and cooling solutions, the use of locally obtained materials, and in general, a &quot;culture of permanence&quot;.

==Defining elements==
Andrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, two of the founders of the Congress for the New Urbanism, observed mixed-use streetscapes with corner shops, front porches, and a diversity of well-crafted housing while living in one of the Victorian neighborhoods of New Haven, Connecticut. They and their colleagues observed patterns including the following:

* The neighborhood has a discernible center. This is often a square or a green and sometimes a busy or memorable street corner. A transit stop would be located at this center.
* Most of the dwellings are within a five-minute walk of the center, an average of roughly .
* There are a variety of dwelling types — usually houses, rowhouses, and apartments — so that younger and older people, singles and families, the poor and the wealthy may find places to live.
* At the edge of the neighborhood, there are shops and offices of sufficiently varied types to supply the weekly needs of a household.
* A small ancillary building or garage apartment is permitted within the backyard of each house. It may be used as a rental unit or place to work (for example, an office or craft workshop).
* An elementary school is close enough so that most children can walk from their home.
* There are small playgrounds accessible to every dwelling — not more than a tenth of a mile away.
* Streets within the neighborhood form a connected network, which disperses traffic by providing a variety of pedestrian and vehicular routes to any destination.
* The streets are relatively narrow and shaded by rows of trees. This slows traffic, creating an environment suitable for pedestrians and bicycles.
* Buildings in the neighborhood center are placed close to the street, creating a well-defined outdoor room.
* Parking lots and garage doors rarely front the street. Parking is relegated to the rear of buildings, usually accessed by alleys.
* Certain prominent sites at the termination of street vistas or in the neighborhood center are reserved for civic buildings. These provide sites for community meetings, education, and religious or cultural activities.

==Terminology==
Several terms are viewed either as synonymous, included in, or overlapping with the New Urbanism. The terms Neotraditional Development or Traditional Neighborhood Development are often associated with the New Urbanism. These terms generally refer to complete New Towns or new neighborhoods, often built in traditional architectural styles, as opposed to smaller infill and redevelopment projects. The term Traditional Urbanism has also been used to describe the New Urbanism by those who object to the &quot;new&quot; moniker. The term &quot;Walkable Urbanism&quot; was proposed as an alternative term by developer and professor Christopher Leinberger. Many debate whether Smart Growth and the New Urbanism are the same or whether substantive differences exist between the two; overlap exists in membership and content between the two movements. Placemaking is another term that is often used to signify New Urbanist efforts or those of like-minded groups. The term Transit-Oriented Development is sometimes cited as being coined by prominent New Urbanist Peter Calthorpe and is heavily promoted by New Urbanists. The term sustainable development is sometimes associated with the New Urbanism as there has been an increasing focus on the environmental benefits of New Urbanism associated with the rise of the term sustainability in the 2000s, however, this has caused some confusion as the term is also used by the United Nations and Agenda 21 to include human development issues (e.g., developing country) that exceed the scope of land development intended to be addressed by the New Urbanism or Sustainable Urbanism. The term &quot;livability&quot; or &quot;livable communities&quot; was popular under the Obama administration, though it dates back at least to the mid-1990s when the term was used by the Local Government Commission.

Planning magazine discussed the proliferation of &quot;urbanisms&quot; in an article in 2011 titled &quot;A Short Guide to 60 of the Newest Urbanisms&quot;. Several New Urbanists have popularized terminology under the umbrella of the New Urbanism including Sustainable Urbanism and Tactical Urbanism (of which Guerrilla Urbanism can be viewed as a subset). The term Tactical Urbanism was coined by Frenchman Michel de Certau in 1968 and revived in 2011 by New Urbanist Mike Lydon and the co-authors of the Tactical Urbanism Guide. In 2011 Andres Duany authored a book that used the term Agrarian Urbanism to describe an agriculturally-focused subset of New Urbanist town design. In 2013 a group of New Urbanists led by CNU co-founder Andres Duany began a research project under the banner of Lean Urbanism which purported to provide a bridge between Tactical Urbanism and the New Urbanism.

Other terms have surfaced in reaction to the New Urbanism intended to provide a contrast, alternative to, or a refinement of the New Urbanism. Some of these terms include Everyday Urbanism by Harvard Professor Margaret Crawford, John Chase, and John Kaliski, Ecological Urbanism, and True Urbanism by architect Bernard Zyscovich. Landscape urbanism was popularized by Charles Waldheim who explicitly defined it as in opposition to the New Urbanism in his lectures at Harvard University. &quot;Landscape Urbanism and its Discontents&quot;, edited by Andres Duany and Emily Talen, specifically addressed the tension between these two views of urbanism.

==Organizations==

The primary organization promoting the New Urbanism in the United States is the Congress for the New Urbanism (CNU). The Congress for the New Urbanism is the leading organization promoting walkable, mixed-use neighborhood development, sustainable communities and healthier living conditions. CNU members promote the principles of CNU&#x27;s Charter and the hallmarks of New Urbanism, including:

* Livable streets arranged in compact, walkable blocks.
* A range of housing choices to serve people of diverse ages and income levels.
* Schools, stores and other nearby destinations reachable by walking, bicycling or transit service.
* An affirming, human-scaled public realm where appropriately designed buildings define and enliven streets and other public spaces.

The CNU has met annually since 1993 when they held their first general meeting in Alexandria, Virginia, with approximately one hundred attendees. By 2008 the Congress was drawing two to three thousand attendees to the annual meetings.

The CNU began forming local and regional chapters circa 2004 with the founding of the New England and Florida Chapters. By 2011 there were 16 official chapters and interest groups for 7 more. , Canada hosts two full CNU Chapters, one in Ontario (CNU Ontario), and one in British Columbia (Cascadia) which also includes a portion of the north-west US states.

While the CNU has international participation in Canada, sister organizations have been formed in other areas of the world including the Council for European Urbanism (CEU), the Movement for Israeli Urbanism (MIU) and the Australian Council for the New Urbanism.

By 2002 chapters of Students for the New Urbanism began appearing at universities including the Savannah College of Art and Design, University of Georgia, University of Notre Dame, and the University of Miami. In 2003, a group of younger professionals and students met at the 11th Congress in Washington, D.C., and began developing a &quot;Manifesto of the Next Generation of New Urbanists&quot;. The Next Generation of New Urbanists held their first major session the following year at the 12th meeting of the CNU in Chicago in 2004. The group has continued meeting annually with a focus on young professionals, students, new member issues, and ensuring the flow of fresh ideas and diverse viewpoints within the New Urbanism and the CNU. Spinoff projects of the Next Generation of the New Urbanists include the Living Urbanism publication first published in 2008 and the first Tactical Urbanism Guide.

The CNU has spawned publications and research groups. Publications include the &quot;New Urban News&quot; and the &quot;New Town Paper&quot;. Research groups have formed independent nonprofits to research individual topics such as the Form-Based Codes Institute, The National Charrette Institute and the Center for Applied Transect Studies.

In the United Kingdom New Urbanist and European urbanism principles are practised and taught by The Prince&#x27;s Foundation for the Built Environment. They have also been broadly supported in the final report of the Building Better Building Beautiful Commission, Living with Beauty, and by organisations such as Create Streets.

Around the world, other organisations promote New Urbanism as part of their remit, such as INTBAU, A Vision of Europe, Council for European Urbanism, and others.

The CNU and other national organizations have also formed partnerships with like-minded groups. Organizations under the banner of Smart Growth also often work with the Congress for the New Urbanism. In addition the CNU has formed partnerships on specific projects such as working with the United States Green Building Council and the Natural Resources Defense Council to develop the LEED for Neighborhood Development standards, and with the Institute of Transportation Engineers to develop a Context Sensitive Solutions (CSS) Design manual.

Founded in 1984, the Seaside Institute is a nonprofit promoting the New Urbanist movement, based in Seaside, Florida. The organization&#x27;s primary goal is to inspire livable communities that are centered around sustainability, connectivity, and adaptability. Since 1993, the Seaside Institute has awarded the Seaside Prize to professionals who have made a significant impact on how communities can be built and rebuilt to reflect New Urbanist principles.

Emerging New Urbanist (ENU) empowers, includes, fosters, and advances the goals of the Charter of the New Urbanism.

==Criticism==

New Urbanism has drawn both praise and criticism from all parts of the political spectrum. It has been criticized both for being a social engineering scheme and for failing to address social equity and for both restricting private enterprise and for being a deregulatory force in support of private sector developers.

Journalist Alex Marshall has decried New Urbanism as essentially a marketing scheme that repackages conventional suburban sprawl behind a façade of nostalgic imagery and empty, aspirational slogans. In a 1996 article in &quot;Metropolis&quot; magazine, Marshall denounced New Urbanism as &quot;a grand fraud&quot;. The attack continued in numerous articles, including an opinion column in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in September of the same year, and in Marshall&#x27;s first book, &quot;How Cities Work: Suburbs, Sprawl, and the Roads Not Taken&quot;.

Critics have asserted that the effectiveness claimed for the New Urbanist solution of mixed income developments lacks statistical evidence. Independent studies have supported the idea of addressing poverty through mixed-income developments, but the argument that New Urbanism produces such diversity has been challenged from findings from one community in Canada.

Some parties have criticized the New Urbanism for being too accommodating of motor vehicles and not going far enough to promote cleaner modes of travelling such as walking, cycling, and public transport. The Charter of the New Urbanism states that &quot;communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car&quot;. Some critics suggest that communities should exclude the car altogether in favor of car-free developments. Steve Melia proposes the idea of &quot;filtered permeability&quot; (see Permeability (spatial and transport planning)) which increases the connectivity of the pedestrian and cycling network resulting in a time and convenience advantage over drivers while still limiting the connectivity of the vehicular network and thus maintaining the safety benefits of cul de sacs and horseshoe loops in resistance to property crime.

In response to critiques of a lack of evidence for the New Urbanism&#x27;s claimed environmental benefits, a rating system for neighborhood environmental design, LEED-ND, was developed by the U.S. Green Building Council, Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Congress for the New Urbanism (CNU), to quantify the sustainability of New Urbanist neighborhood design. New Urbanist and board member of CNU Doug Farr has taken a step further and coined Sustainable Urbanism, which combines New Urbanism and LEED-ND to create walkable, transit-served urbanism with high performance buildings and infrastructure.

Criticizing the lack of evidence for low greenhouse gas emissions results, Susan Subak has pointed out that while New Urbanism emphasizes walkability and building variety, it is the scale of dwellings, especially the absence of large houses that may determine successful, low carbon outcomes at the community level.

New Urbanism has been criticized for being a form of centrally planned, large-scale development, &quot;instead of allowing the initiative for construction to be taken by the final users themselves&quot;. It has been criticized for asserting universal principles of design instead of attending to local conditions.

==Examples==
===United States===


New Urbanism is having a growing influence on how and where metropolitan regions choose to grow. At least fourteen large-scale planning initiatives are based on the principles of linking transportation and land-use policies, and using the neighborhood as the fundamental building block of a region. Miami, Florida has adopted the most ambitious New Urbanist-based zoning code reform yet undertaken by a major U.S. city.

More than six hundred new towns, villages, and neighborhoods, following New Urbanist principles, have been planned or are currently under construction in the U.S. Hundreds of new, small-scale, urban and suburban infill projects are under way to reestablish walkable streets and blocks. In Maryland and several other states, New Urbanist principles are an integral part of &quot;smart growth&quot; legislation.

In the mid-1990s, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) adopted the principles of the New Urbanism in its multibillion-dollar program to rebuild public housing projects nationwide. New Urbanists have planned and developed hundreds of projects in infill locations. Most were driven by the private sector, but many, including HUD projects, used public money.

====Prospect New Town====
Founded in the mid-1990s, Prospect New Town is Colorado&#x27;s first full-scale New Urbanist community. Developer Kiki Wallace worked with the firm of Duany Plater Zyberk &amp; Company to develop the neighborhood that was formerly his family&#x27;s tree farm. Currently in its final phase of development, the neighborhood is intended to have a population of approximately 2,000 people in 585 units on 340 lots. The development includes a town center interwoven into the center of the residential area, with businesses ranging from restaurants to professional offices. The streets are oriented to maximize the view of the mountains, and the traditional town center is no more than five minutes on foot from any place in the neighborhood.

====University Place in Memphis====
In 2010, University Place in Memphis, Tennessee became the second only U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) LEED certified neighborhood. LEED ND (neighborhood development) standards integrates principles of smart growth, urbanism, and green building and were developed through a collaboration between USGBC, Congress for the New Urbanism, and the Natural Resources Defense Council. University Place, developed by McCormack Baron Salazar, is a 405-unit, , mixed-income, mixed use, multigenerational, HOPE VI grant community that revitalized the severely distressed Lamar Terrace public housing site.

====The Cotton District====
The Cotton District in Starkville, Mississippi was the first New Urbanist development, begun in 1968 long before the New Urbanism movement was organized. The District borders Mississippi State University, and consists mostly of residential rental units for college students along with restaurants, bars and retail. The Cotton District got its name because it is built in the vicinity of an old cotton mill.

====Seaside====
Seaside, Florida, the first fully New Urbanist town, began development in 1981 on of Florida Panhandle coastline. It was featured on the cover of the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; in 1988, when only a few streets were completed, and it has become internationally famous for its architecture, as well as the quality of its streets and public spaces.

Seaside is now a tourist destination, and it appeared in the film &quot;The Truman Show&quot; (1998). Lots sold for US$15,000 in the early 1980s. Slightly over a decade later, in the mid-1990s, the price had escalated to about US$200,000. Today, most lots sell for more than $1 million, and some houses top $5 million.

====Mueller Community====
The Mueller Community is located on the site of the former Robert Mueller Municipal Airport in Austin, Texas, which closed in 1999. Per the developer, the value of the Mueller development upon completion will be $1.3 billion, and will comprise of non-residential development, of retail space, 4,600 homes, and of open space. An estimated 10,000 permanent jobs within the development will have been created by the time it is complete. In 2012, the Mueller Community had more electric cars per capita than any other neighborhood in the United States – a fact partially attributable to an incentive program.

====Stapleton====
The site of the former Stapleton International Airport in Denver and Aurora, Colorado, closed in 1995, is now being redeveloped by Forest City Enterprises. Stapleton is expected to be home to at least 30,000 residents, six schools, and of retail. Construction began in 2001. Northfield Stapleton, one of the development&#x27;s major retail centers, recently opened.

====San Antonio====
In 1997, San Antonio, Texas, as part of a new master plan, created new regulations called the Unified Development Code (UDC), largely influenced by New Urbanism. One feature of the UDC is six unique land development patterns that can be applied to certain districts: Conservation Development; Commercial Center Development; Office or Institutional Campus Development; Commercial Retrofit Development; Tradition Neighborhood Development; and Transit Oriented Development. Each district has specific standards and design regulations. The six development patterns were created to reflect existing development patterns.

====Mountain House====
Mountain House, one of the latest New Urbanist projects in the United States, is a new town located near Tracy, California. Construction started in 2001. Mountain House will consist of 12 villages, each with its own elementary school, park, and commercial area. In addition, a future train station, transit center, and bus system are planned for Mountain House.

====Mesa del Sol====
Mesa del Sol, New Mexico—the largest New Urbanist project in the United States—was designed by architect Peter Calthorpe, and is being developed by Forest City Enterprises. Mesa del Sol may take five decades to reach full build-out, at which time it should have: 38,000 residential units, housing a population of 100,000; a industrial office park; four town centers; an urban center; and a downtown that would provide a twin city within Albuquerque.

====I&#x27;On====
Located in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, I&#x27;On is a traditional neighborhood development, mixed with a new urbanism styled architecture, reflecting on the building designs of the nearby downtown areas of Charleston, South Carolina. Founded on April 30, 1995, I&#x27;On was designed by the town planning firms of Dover, Kohl &amp; Partners and Duany Plater-Zyberk &amp; Company, and currently holds over 750 single family homes. Features of the community include extensive sidewalks, shared public greens and parks, trails, and a grid of narrow, traffic calming streets. Most homes are required to have a front porch of not less than in depth. Floor heights of , raised foundations, and smaller lot sizes give the community a dense, vertical feel.

====Haile Plantation====
Haile Plantation, Florida, is a 2,600-household, development of regional impact southwest of the city of Gainesville, within Alachua County. Haile Village Center is a traditional neighborhood center within the development. It was originally started in 1978 and completed in 2007. In addition to the 2,600 homes the neighborhood consists of two merchant centers (one a New England narrow street village and the other a chain grocery strip mall), as well as two public elementary schools and an 18-hole golf course.

====Celebration, Florida====
In June 1996, the Walt Disney Company unveiled its town of Celebration, near Orlando, Florida. Celebration opened its downtown in October 1996, relying heavily on the experiences of Seaside, whose downtown was nearly complete. Disney shuns the label New Urbanism, calling Celebration simply a &quot;town&quot;.

Celebration&#x27;s Downtown has become one of the area&#x27;s most popular tourist destinations making the community a showcase for New Urbanism as a prime example of the creation of a &quot;sense of place&quot;.

====Jersey City====
The construction of the Hudson Bergen Light Rail in Hudson County, New Jersey has spurred transit-oriented development. In Jersey City, at least three projects are planned to transform brownfield sites, two of which have required remediation of toxic waste by previous owners:
*Bayfront, once site of a Honeywell plant is a site on the Hackensack River, near the planned West Campus of New Jersey City University.
*Canal Crossing, named for the former Morris Canal, was once partially owned by PPG Industries, and is a site west of Liberty State Park.
*Liberty Harbor is on the north side of the Morris Canal.

====Old York Village, Chesterfield Township, New Jersey====
The sparsely developed agricultural Township of Chesterfield in New Jersey covers approximately and has made farmland preservation a priority since the 1970s. Chesterfield has permanently preserved more than of farmland through state and county programs and a township-wide transfer of development credits program that directs future growth to a designated &quot;receiving area&quot; known as Old York Village. Old York Village is a neo-traditional, new urbanism town on incorporating a variety of housing types, neighborhood commercial facilities, a new elementary school, civic uses, and active and passive open space areas with preserved agricultural land surrounding the planned village. Construction began in the early 2000s and a significant percentage of the community is now complete. Old York Village was the winner of the American Planning Association National Outstanding Planning Award in 2004.

==== Civita ====
Civita is a sustainable, transit-oriented master-planned village under development in the Mission Valley area of San Diego, California, United States. Located on a former quarry site, the urban-style village is organized around a community park that cascades down the terraced property. Civita development plans call for of parks and open space, 4,780 residences (including approximately 478 affordable units), an approximately retail center, and for an office/business campus.

Sudberry Properties, the developer of Civita, incorporated numerous green building practices in the Civita design. In 2009, Civita achieved a Stage 1 Gold rating for the U.S. Green Building Council&#x27;s 2009 LEED-ND (Neighborhood Development) pilot and received the California Governor&#x27;s Environmental and Economic Leadership Award. In 2010, Civita was designated as a California Catalyst Community by the California Department of Housing and Community Development to support innovation and test sustainable strategies that reflect the interdependence of environmental, economic, and community health.

==== Del Mar Station ====
Del Mar Station, which won a Congress for the New Urbanism Charter Award in 2003, is a transit-oriented development surrounding a prominent Metro Rail stop on the Gold Line, which connects Los Angeles and Pasadena. Located at the southern edge of downtown Pasadena, it serves as a gateway to the city with 347 apartments, out of which 15% are affordable units. Approximately of retail is linked with a network of public plazas, paseos, and private courtyards. The , US$77 million project sits above a 1,200-car multi-level subterranean parking garage, with 600 spaces dedicated to transit. A light rail right-of-way, detailed as a public street, bisects the site. It was designed by Moule &amp; Polyzoides.

==== Norfolk, VA, East Beach ====
East Beach in Norfolk, VA, was designed and built in the style of traditional Atlantic coastal villages. The Master Plan for East Beach was developed in the style of “New Urbanism” by world renowned TND master planners Duany Plater-Zyberk. Newly constructed homes reflect traditional classic detail and proportion of Tidewater Virginia homes, and are built with materials that will withstand the test of time and forces of Mother Nature and the Chesapeake Bay.

===Other countries===
New Urbanism is closely related to the Urban village movement in Europe. They both occurred at similar times and share many of the same principles although urban villages has an emphasis on traditional city planning. In Europe many brown-field sites have been redeveloped since the 1980s following the models of the traditional city neighbourhoods rather than Modernist models. One well-publicized example is Poundbury in England, a suburban extension to the town of Dorchester, which was built on land owned by the Duchy of Cornwall under the overview of Prince Charles. The original masterplan was designed by Leon Krier. A report carried out after the first phase of construction found a high degree of satisfaction by residents, although the aspirations to reduce car dependency had not been successful. Rising house prices and a perceived premium have made the open market housing unaffordable for many local people.

The Council for European Urbanism (CEU), formed in 2003, shares many of the same aims as the U.S.&#x27;s New Urbanists. CEU&#x27;s Charter is a development of the Congress for the New Urbanism Charter revised and reorganised to relate better to European conditions. An Australian organisation, Australian Council for New Urbanism has since 2001 run conferences and events to promote New Urbanism in that country. A New Zealand Urban Design Protocol was created by the Ministry for the Environment in 2005.

There are many developments around the world that follow New Urbanist principles to a greater or lesser extent:

====Europe====

*Le Plessis-Robinson, a 21st-century example of neo-traditionalism, in the south-west of Paris. This city is in the process of transforming itself, destroying old modern blocklike buildings and replacing them with traditional buildings and houses in one of the biggest worldwide projects with Val d&#x27;Europe. In 2008 the city was nominated best architectural project of the European Union.
* Poundbury, in Dorset, England, is a neotraditionalist urban extension focussed on high quality urban realm and the expression of traditional modes of urban or village life.
* Tornagrain, between Inverness and Nairn, Scotland, The design is based on the architectural and planning traditions of the Highlands and the rest of Scotland.
*Val d&#x27;Europe, east of Paris, France. Developed by Disneyland Resort Paris, this town is a kind of European counterpart to Walt Disney World Celebration City.
*Jakriborg, in Southern Sweden, is a recent example of the New Urbanist movement.
*Brandevoort, in Helmond, in the Netherlands, is a new example of the New Urbanist movement.
*&quot;Sankt Eriksområdet&quot; quarter in Stockholm, Sweden, built in the 1990s.
*Other developments can be found at Heulebrug, part of Knokke-Heist, in Belgium, and Fonti di Matilde in San Bartolomeo (outside of Reggio Emilia), Italy.
*Kartanonkoski, in Vantaa, Finland, is the only example of neotraditional architecture in Finland implemented on a larger scale. The area has around 4000 inhabitants and its architecture has been mainly influenced by Nordic Classicism.
*Vauban and its surrounding city Freiburg serve as centers for innovation integrating solar roofs, carbon neutral buildings, Passivhaus, and point-access block single-exit apartment blocks into the fabric of New Urbanist architecture and neighborhoods.

====Americas====
*Mahogany Bay Village, Belize, is New Urbanist community on Ambergris Caye, Belize. 
*Orchid Bay, Belize, is one of the largest New Urbanist projects in Central America and the Caribbean.
*Las Catalinas, Costa Rica, is a coastal town in the Guanacaste Province of Northwest Costa Rica. Envisioned as a compact, walkable beach town, Las Catalinas was founded in 2006 by Charles Brewer and incorporates many of the principles of New Urbanism.
*McKenzie Towne is a New Urbanist development which commenced in 1995 by Carma Developers LP in Calgary.
*Cornell, within the city of Markham, Ontario, was designed with walkable neighborhoods, density to support public transit, a variety of housing types and retail.
*New Amherst is a new urbanist development in the town of Cobourg, Ontario.
*UniverCity, beside the Simon Fraser University campus on Burnaby Mountain in Burnaby, British Columbia, is a sustainable community that is designed to be walkable, dense, and well connected to public transit networks.
*Mount Pleasant Village in the city of Brampton, Ontario was designed as a mixed-use neighbourhood surrounding a train station and with a central square.

====Asia====

*The structure plan for Thimphu, Bhutan, follows Principles of Intelligent Urbanism, which share underlying axioms with the New Urbanism.

====Africa====
There are several such developments in South Africa. The most notable is Melrose Arch in Johannesburg. Triple Point is a comparable mixed-use development in East London, in Eastern Cape province. The development, announced in 2007, comprises 30 hectares. It is made up of three apartment complexes together with over 30 residential sites as well as 20,000 sq m of residential and office space. The development is valued at over R2 billion ($250 million). There have been cases where market forces of urban decay are confused with new urbanism in African cities . This has led to a form of suburban mixed-use development that does not promote walkability.

====Australia====
Most new developments on the edges of Australia&#x27;s major cities are master planned, often guided expressly by the principles of New Urbanism. The relationship between housing, activity centres, the transport network and key social infrastructure (sporting facilities, libraries, community centres etc.) is defined at structure planning stage.
*Jindee, Western Australia, a new coastal development north of Perth which has been designed using Smart Code. 
*Tullimbar Village, New South Wales, is a new development which follows the principles of New Urbanism.

Another important factor or principle of New Urbanism that guides Australia&#x27;s major cities is how good their foot circulation seems to be which is guided by the wayfinding systems that are implemented. Kenneth B. Hall Jr. and Gerald A. Porterfield said in their book, &quot;Community by Design,&quot; the way to gain good circulation is to take some thoughtful consideration to things like wayfinding, sight lines, transition, visual clues, and reference points. Circulation design should work to create an interesting and informative system that utilizes subtle elements as well as technical ones. City of Port Philip, Australia, is a good example of wayfinding where they have come up with a comprehensive pedestrian signage system, specifically for their local areas of St Kilda, South Melbourne and Port Melbourne. The city&#x27;s wayfinding system consists of 26 individually designed panels that are placed on some major streets such as St Kilda and St Kilda East, linking St Kilda Junction and Balaclava Station to the foreshore via Fitzroy, Carlisle and Acland Streets. City of Port Philip also created directional signage systems that makes use of the already existing street furniture such as trash cans to help provide for 130 directional indicators across Port Melbourne.

===== 20-minute neighbourhoods =====
Melbourne followed up a 2014 plan by launching 20-minute neighbourhoods in January 2018, aiming to provide for most daily needs within a 20-minute walk from home, together with safe cycling and public transport options. Another definition has used the time taken to cycle, or take a bus. In Melbourne the concept was initiated in the suburbs of Croydon South, Strathmore, and Sunshine West. The concept has since expanded to other cities, such as Singapore and Hamilton in New Zealand. Critics have pointed out that Melbourne&#x27;s plan excludes jobs and that a previous target for public transport use has been shelved. The concept has been equated with localism.

Dubai launched the 20-minute city project in 2022, where residents are able to access daily needs &amp; destinations within 20 minutes by foot or bicycle. The plan involves placing 55% of the residents within 800 meters of mass transit stations, allowing them to reach 80% of their daily needs and destinations.

==American definition==
Federal grants are defined and governed by the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977, as incorporated in Title 31 Section 6304 of the U.S. Code. A Federal grant is a:

&quot;...legal instrument reflecting the relationship between the United States Government and a State, a local government, or other entity when 1) the principal purpose of the relationship is to transfer a thing of value to the State or local government or other recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by a law of the United States instead of acquiring (by purchase, lease, or barter) property or services for the direct benefit or use of the United States Government; and 2) substantial involvement is not expected between the executive agency and the State, local government, or other recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in the agreement.&quot;
When an awarding agency expects to be substantially involved in a project (beyond routine monitoring and technical assistance), the law requires use of a cooperative agreement instead. When the government is procuring goods or services for its own direct benefit, and not for a broader public purpose, the law requires use of a federal contract.

The preference for use of goods, products, and materials produced in, and services offered in, the United States which applies to federal procurement policy is also applied to the use of federal grants.

==Types of grants==

*Categorical grants may be spent only for narrowly defined purposes and recipients often must match a portion of the federal funds. 33% of categorical grants are considered to be formula grants. About 90% of federal aid dollars are spent for categorical grants.
**Project grants are grants given by the government to fund research projects, such as a research project for medical purposes. An individual must acquire certain qualifications before applying for such a grant and the normal duration for project grants is three years.
**Formula grants provide funds as dictated by a law.
*Block grants are large grants provided from the federal government to state or local governments for use in a general purpose.
*Earmark grants are explicitly specified in appropriations of the U.S. Congress. They are not competitively awarded and have become highly controversial because of the heavy involvement of paid political lobbyists used in securing them. In FY1996 appropriations, the Congressional Research Service found 3,023 earmarks totaling $19.5 billion, while in FY2006 it found 12,852 earmarks totaling $64 billion.

* Pass-Through Grants - Pass-through grants are funds provided by the federal government to a primary recipient, such as a state government, which then distributes the funds to sub-recipients, such as local governments or nonprofit organizations. This type of grant allows for the decentralization of fund distribution and administration.

For charitable grants and funds for schools and organizations see: Grant writing and Grants.

There are over 900 grant programs offered by the 26 federal grant-making agencies. These programs fall into 20 categories:

* Agriculture
* Arts
* Business and Commerce
* Community Development
* Consumer Protection
* Disaster Prevention and Relief
* Education Regional Development
* Employment, Labor, and Training
* Energy
* Environmental Quality

== State and local government grants ==
State and local governments also provide grants to support various projects and initiatives within their jurisdictions. These grants often focus on areas such as economic development, education, public safety, healthcare, and infrastructure.

=== State grants ===
State grants are financial awards provided by individual states to support projects and programs that benefit residents. These grants can be used for purposes such as education, environmental conservation, public health, and community development. Each state has its own agencies and programs that administer these grants.

=== Local government grants ===
Local government grants are offered by counties, cities, and municipalities to support local initiatives. These grants often target community-specific needs, such as housing, transportation, public safety, and cultural programs. Local governments may also pass through federal and state grant funds to local organizations.

== Private foundation grants ==
Private foundations are nonprofit organizations that provide grants to support various causes and initiatives. These foundations are typically funded by individuals, families, or corporations and have specific focus areas, such as education, health, social services, arts, and the environment.

=== Independent foundations ===
Independent foundations, also known as private foundations, are established by individuals or families and operate independently of government control. Examples include the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the Ford Foundation. These foundations often have substantial endowments and provide grants to nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, and other entities that align with their mission and goals.

=== Corporate foundations ===
Corporate foundations are philanthropic arms of corporations that provide grants to support charitable activities. These foundations are funded by the parent company and focus on areas that align with the corporation’s values and business interests. Examples include the Coca-Cola Foundation and the Walmart Foundation.

=== Community foundations ===
Community foundations are public charities that provide grants to support local community needs. These foundations pool donations from multiple sources, including individuals, families, and businesses, to create endowment funds that support a wide range of community initiatives. Examples include the Cleveland Foundation and the Silicon Valley Community Foundation.

== Corporate grants ==
In addition to corporate foundations, many corporations provide grants directly through their corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs. These grants are often used to support community development, environmental sustainability, education, and employee volunteerism.

=== Direct corporate grants ===
Corporations may offer direct grants to nonprofit organizations, schools, and other entities. These grants are typically aligned with the company’s CSR goals and business priorities. For example, a technology company might provide grants to support STEM education programs.

=== In-kind donations ===
Some corporations provide in-kind donations instead of or in addition to monetary grants. In-kind donations can include products, services, technology, and expertise that support the recipient organization&#x27;s operations and programs.

== Nonprofit organization grants ==
Many nonprofit organizations provide grants to support specific causes and initiatives. These organizations raise funds from various sources, including private donors, foundations, and government grants, and redistribute them through grant programs.

=== Nonprofit grantmakers ===
Nonprofit grantmakers, such as the United Way and the American Heart Association, provide grants to support programs and services that align with their mission. These grants often focus on areas such as health, education, social services, and disaster relief.

=== Philanthropic networks ===
Philanthropic networks and collaboratives, such as Grantmakers for Education and the Environmental Grantmakers Association, consist of multiple foundations and grantmakers that work together to fund projects and initiatives within specific focus areas.

== Educational institution grants ==
Educational institutions, including colleges and universities, often provide grants to support research, scholarships, and educational programs. These grants are funded through a combination of federal and state grants, private donations, and institutional funds.

=== Research grants ===
Many universities and research institutions offer grants to support academic research projects. These grants are often funded by federal agencies, private foundations, and corporate sponsors. Examples include research grants provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

=== Scholarship and fellowship grants ===
Educational institutions provide scholarships and fellowships to support students’ educational pursuits. These grants can be merit-based, need-based, or specific to certain fields of study. They are funded through endowments, private donations, and institutional funds.

== Information provided in grant applications==
Award information in grants generally includes:
* Estimated funding
* Expected number of awards
* Anticipated award size
* Period of performance

Eligibility information includes:
* Eligible applicants
* Cost sharing

==Criticism==
Federal and state grants frequently receive criticism due to what are perceived to be excessive regulations and not include opportunities for small business, as well as for often giving more money per person to smaller states regardless of population or need. These criticisms include problems of overlap, duplication, excessive categorization, insufficient information, varying requirements, arbitrary federal decision-making, and grantsmanship (a funding bias toward entities most familiar with how to exploit the system, rather than to those most in need). Research also suggests that federal grants are often allocated politically, with more money going to areas represented by the political party commanding a majority in Congress or that controls the presidency.

<text>Maranatha! Music is a Christian music record label which was founded as a nonprofit ministry of Calvary Chapel in 1971. The label is distributed by Capitol Christian Music Group, a division of Universal Music.

==Background==
In the early 1970s Calvary Chapel was home to more than 15 musical groups that were representative of the Jesus movement. In 1971, Maranatha! Music was founded as a nonprofit outreach of Calvary Chapel to popularize and promote a new, folk-rock style of hymns and worship songs influenced by the Jesus people. Some of the early Maranatha! recording groups were Sweet Comfort Band, Love Song, Chuck Girard, Children of the Day, The Way, Debby Kerner, Mustard Seed Faith, Karen Lafferty, and Daniel Amos. The label&#x27;s first release was a various artists compilation entitled &quot;The Everlastin&#x27; Living Jesus Music Concert&quot;, in 1971. The first release is also known as Maranatha! 1 as it became part of what would be called the Maranatha Series.

Maranatha! also branched into the children&#x27;s market segment. Premier products included Psalty the Singing Songbook and &quot;The Kids Praise Album!&quot;. In the early 1990s this segment represented about 40% of company revenues.

In the 1980s, Maranatha! launched Broken Records, a label focusing on modern rock, punk and alternative music. The &quot;Colours&quot; series contained instrumental music in the vein of New Age artists, but the label avoided the term.

==Awards==
In 1990, Maranatha! was awarded the National Religious Broadcasters&#x27; President&#x27;s Award. In 1991, the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Gospel Music Association.

<doc id="158966" wikidata="Q821198" url="?curid=158966" title="Berlin (band)">
<text>Berlin is an American new wave/synth-pop band formed in Los Angeles in 1978. The band gained commercial success in the 1980s with singles including &quot;The Metro&quot;, &quot;Sex (I&#x27;m a ...)&quot;, &quot;No More Words&quot; and the chart-topping &quot;Take My Breath Away&quot; from the 1986 film &quot;Top Gun&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song and a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. The group disbanded right after reaching global success. The best-known lineup consisted of singer Terri Nunn, bass guitarist and vocalist John Crawford, keyboardist David Diamond, guitarist Ric Olsen, keyboardist Matt Reid, and drummer Rob Brill.

==History==
===Early years===
The genesis of Berlin was the rock band the Toys, formed in 1976 in Orange County, California, by John Crawford (bass guitar), Dan Van Patten (drums), Chris Ruiz-Velasco (guitar), and Tyson A. Cobb (vocals). After a few shows, the band changed its name to Berlin and stayed together for about three years but ultimately regrouped, discharging Cobb as lead singer. After a brief time when Toni Childs was lead singer, Terri Nunn joined the band after answering an ad through the Musicians Contact Service in Hollywood in 1979. Despite its name, Berlin did not have any known major connections with the sometime capital of Germany; the name was chosen to make them seem European and exotic. Terri Nunn explained in a 2003 interview, &quot;...Berlin started that way [electronic], and in a sense helped to bring that to America. &#x27;Cause when we started, it was going on in Europe, but it wasn&#x27;t really happening here yet.&quot; The band was inspired by the keyboard-oriented groups Kraftwerk, Devo, Sparks and The Screamers.

The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;A Matter of Time&quot;, was released in 1979 on Renegade Records and they appeared on television for the first time on the short-lived &quot;Hollywood Heartbeat&quot;, hosted by former Fleetwood Mac guitarist Bob Welch. Nunn left the group later that year to pursue an acting career, and was replaced by Virginia Macolino. The band released the 1980 album &quot;Information&quot;, with Macolino as lead vocalist, but the band struggled to sign with a mainstream label without Nunn. As band manager, Perry Watts-Russell explained, &quot;Unfortunately, the record labels that had shown interest in December 1979, when Terri was the singer, were no longer keen to sign the band. So, by later that year, Berlin had effectively broken up, and John had formed and was the lead singer in another group, Fahrenheit, with Dan Van Patten. But he had some songs that he thought were better suited to Terri&#x27;s voice, and he asked me if I thought she might be interested in singing them. We asked and she was.&quot;

===Eventual success===
Nunn rejoined the band as singer in 1980, after which they signed to independent label Enigma Records. They then released a double A-sided single, &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; / &quot;The Metro&quot;. The single was intended as a one-off, since Crawford was by then focusing on his new band, Fahrenheit, and regarded Berlin as a &quot;just for fun&quot; side project. However, the single was a success, helping to finance the EP album, &quot;Pleasure Victim&quot;, which was recorded on a $2,900 budget. The EP included their first significant hit: the controversial synth-driven &quot;Sex (I&#x27;m a ...)&quot; (1982), which was banned by some radio stations due to its graphic lyrics. The song was intentionally written and composed to get airplay on Los Angeles area radio station KROQ, which specialized in playing music that was not heard on other stations, and of which members of the group were fans. Due to the attention brought on by the single, wider release offers were made by larger record labels for &quot;Pleasure Victim&quot;. Geffen Records&#x27; offer was accepted and the label re-released &quot;Pleasure Victim&quot; worldwide in early 1983. The label also re-released &quot;The Metro&quot;, which then became another hit. By this point, the band consisted of core members Nunn, Crawford, and long-time keyboardist/guitarist David Diamond, augmented by guitarist Ric Olsen, keyboardist Matt Reid, and a series of drummers. Van Patten still contributed heavily to &quot;Pleasure Victim&quot; but was ultimately replaced by Rod Learned, who performed on &quot;Pleasure Victim&quot;&#x27;s opening track and later appeared with the band during their performance at the 1983 US Festival. Learned&#x27;s tenure in the band proved short-lived, and by the following year, new drummer Rob Brill had joined the group in his place.

In 1984, the band released their next album, &quot;Love Life&quot;, and the single &quot;No More Words&quot;, whose subsequent video saw Terri Nunn and bandmates re-enact a Bonnie and Clyde-style car chase and shoot-out, became their first top-40 hit. &quot;Take My Breath Away&quot; (for the movie &quot;Top Gun soundtrack&quot;), co-written and produced by Giorgio Moroder, became their best-selling single in 1986 and a huge international hit, but also their last big hit.

===Members===

Aside from Nunn, members of the band were founding member John Crawford (primary songwriter, bass guitar and synthesizer), and David Diamond (synthesizer &amp; guitar). Ric Olsen (lead guitar) was brought in during the final recording of &quot;Pleasure Victim&quot;. Other members added were Matt Reid (synthesizer), Rod Learned (drums: 1982–1983) and Rob Brill (drums: 1983–1987). Berlin&#x27;s breakout EP, 1982&#x27;s &quot;Pleasure Victim&quot;, featured Nunn, Crawford, and Diamond, as well as guitarist Olsen, drummer, synthesist and producer Dan Van Patten and guitarist Chris Ruiz-Velasco. Before &quot;Pleasure Victim&quot; was completed, Van Patten and Ruiz-Velasco parted ways with Nunn, Crawford, and Diamond. Ric Olsen was brought in to complete tracks on &quot;Pleasure Victim&quot;.

===Dissolution and re-formation===

Berlin officially disbanded in 1987, because of both the lack of success of their album &quot;Count Three &amp; Pray&quot; and personal disagreements over the single &quot;Take My Breath Away&quot;. Nunn viewed it as a fresh new song that allowed the band to perform globally, while others disliked it as it had not been written or composed by any of them. Later, after the release of the 1991 solo album &quot;Moment of Truth&quot;, Nunn retained the legal rights to usage of the band&#x27;s name after legal wranglings with the founding member of the group, John Crawford. Drummer Rob Brill and John Crawford formed the alternative hard rock trio, The Big F, along with guitarist Mark Christian. They released two studio albums (&quot;The Big F&quot; and &quot;Is&quot;). Nunn recreated Berlin, with a new lineup of musicians, in 1997. In 1999, Berlin opened for The Go-Go&#x27;s on their West Coast reunion tour.

===After 2000===

In 2000–2001, Berlin contributed to several artist tribute albums. The only track to make it on to a full Berlin release is a cover of Marilyn Manson&#x27;s &quot;The Dope Show&quot;, which is included on Berlin&#x27;s &quot;4play&quot; album as well as the Marilyn Manson tribute album &quot;Anonymous Messiah&quot; (2001, Vitamin Records). Other tributes include material by Madonna, Blondie and Depeche Mode.

In 2004, Berlin was featured on the VH1 show, &quot;Bands Reunited&quot; where the roughly pre-&quot;Love Life&quot; era lineup of the band (John Crawford, Terri Nunn, David Diamond, Ric Olsen, Matt Reid and Rod Learned) agreed to reunite as a band and as friends. They played one show at The Roxy in California to a sold-out crowd.

The band, featuring Nunn supported by other members who were not part of the classic line-up, toured with rock band INXS during the summer of 2011. Gerald Casale of Devo created a video for Berlin which was scheduled to debut at a late November 2011 performance. Nunn herself was scheduled both to debut a radio show on KCSN-FM, and to record a new album, in 2012.

In July 2013, it was announced that a new album called &quot;Animal&quot; would be released on September 17, from which a single &quot;It&#x27;s The Way&quot; would also be issued.

In an August 9, 2016, interview with &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, Nunn announced the original members (Crawford, Nunn and Diamond) had been writing new material, and planning a tour and new album for 2017.

On the 80s Cruise 2018, Ric Olsen, David Diamond and John Crawford performed with the Nunn-fronted version of Berlin. Rather than replacing any of the existing members, Diamond and Crawford are merging with Nunn&#x27;s current Berlin incarnation to form a six-person line-up. They performed two new songs from their forthcoming album. They jokingly announced the album&#x27;s title would be &quot;Woke&quot;, a suggestion from VJ Mark Goodman during a Q &amp; A session on the cruise, and that the album would be released in July 2018. Although an official name has not been determined, the new album was scheduled for release later that year.

In May 2019, Terri Nunn announced that she and co-founders John Crawford and David Diamond would be reuniting for a new album, &quot;Transcendance&quot;, to be released on August 2, 2019.

Berlin was among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. The accuracy of this report was disputed by Vinny Vero, a music producer who works for the reissue label Cherry Red. Vero observed that Berlin&#x27;s album masters were “safe and sound” while working on reissues of another Geffen recording artist. Later the same year, Universal located two session reels containing 11 unique or early versions of songs recorded in 1983 between &quot;Pleasure Victim&quot; and &quot;Love Life&quot;, as well as an unreleased outtake from &quot;Love Life&quot;.

On August 2, 2019, Berlin featuring Terri Nunn released their eighth album, &quot;Transcendance&quot;.

On November 27, 2020, Berlin released their ninth album, &quot;Strings Attached&quot;, which includes re-recordings of previous songs backed by a full orchestra.

On December 31, 2020, Terri Nunn performed as a solo act at Donald Trump&#x27;s Mar-a-Lago New Year&#x27;s Eve Party along with Vanilla Ice. Soon thereafter, Nunn expressed deep regret for participating in the event, stating not only that she did not intend it to be an endorsement or support of any political party, but also that she was unaware of the laxness of COVID laws in the State of Florida and was astonished to find that masks and social distancing were not required at the event, as she had been led to believe otherwise.

<text>The Mon (; Thai Mon: ဂကူမည်; , ; , ) are an ethnic group who inhabit Lower Myanmar&#x27;s Mon State, Kayin State, Kayah State, Tanintharyi Region, Bago Region, the Irrawaddy Delta, and several areas in Thailand (mostly in Pathum Thani province, Phra Pradaeng and Nong Ya Plong). The native language is Mon, which belongs to the Monic branch of the Austroasiatic language family and shares a common origin with the Nyah Kur language, which is spoken by the people of the same name that live in Northeastern Thailand. A number of languages in Mainland Southeast Asia are influenced by the Mon language, which is also in turn influenced by those languages.

The Mon were one of the earliest to reside in Southeast Asia, and were responsible for the spread of Theravada Buddhism in Mainland Southeast Asia. The civilizations founded by the Mon were some of the earliest in Thailand as well as Myanmar and Laos. The Mon are regarded as a large exporter of Southeast Asian culture. Historically, many cities in Myanmar, Thailand, and Laos today, including Yangon, Pathum Thani, Lamphun, Lampang and Vientiane were founded either by the Mon people or Mon rulers.

Nowadays, the Mon are a major ethnic group in Myanmar and a minor ethnic group in Thailand. The Mons from Myanmar are called Burmese Mon or Myanmar Mon. The Mons from Thailand are referred as Thai Raman or Thai Mon. The Mon dialects of Thailand and Myanmar are mutually intelligible.

==Ethnonyms==
The Mon have been referred to by different names by different groups throughout history. During the pre-colonial era, the Burmese called them &quot;Talaing&quot; (တလိုင်း), which was adopted by the British during the colonial era. The term &quot;Peguan&quot; was also used by Europeans when Pegu was the capital of Lower Myanmar.

The use of &quot;Talaing&quot; has been found on inscriptions dating back to the 11th century, but it is now considered a pejorative term and is no longer widely used, except in the context of specific historical terms, such as the eponymous song genre in the Mahagita, the corpus of Burmese classical songs. The etymology of Talaing is debated; it may be derived from Mon, or is a reference to Telinga or Kalinga, a geographic region in southeast India. During the 12th century, the term acquired a derogatory connotation within the Mon community, when it became used by the Mon as a disparaging epithet for the mixed offspring of Mon women and foreign men.

The term &quot;Mon&quot; (spelt in Mon and in Burmese), which is synonymous with the Burmese word for &#x27;noble,&#x27; was likely derived from Old Mon &quot;rmeñ&quot; by way of Middle Mon &quot;rman&quot; (ရာမန်). The ethnonym &quot;rmeñ&quot; was first recorded in the Kyanzittha’s New Palace Inscription of AD 1102 in Myanmar. Derivatives of this ethnonym have been found in 6th to 10th-century Old Khmer and 11th-century Javanese inscriptions. The geographic term Rāmaññadesa, which now refers to the Mon heartland on the Burmese coast, was coined by King Dhammazedi in 1479.

The Mon of Myanmar are divided into three sub-groups based on their ancestral region in Lower Myanmar, including &quot;Mon Nya&quot; (; from Pathein (the Irrawaddy Delta) in the west, &quot;Mon Tang&quot; (; ) in Bago in the central region, and &quot;Mon Teh&quot; (; ) at Mottama in the southeast.
==History==
===Prehistory===
The Mon people, who descended from Proto-Austroasiatic people, are believed to have migrated from the Yangtze Kiang valley in Southern China to Southeast Asia between 3,000 and 2,000 BCE, along the Mekong, Salween, Sittaung, Irrawaddy, Ping and Chao Phaya rivers. They eventually settled in locations including as far south as Malaya. Along the way, they brought with them the practice of riverine agriculture, including the cultivation of wet rice. Modern linguistic research by Sidwell (2021) suggests that the locus of Proto-Austroasiatic people was in the Red River Delta area of Northern Vietnam, around 4,000-4,500 years before present.

===Early history===


The Mon are believed to have been one of the earliest peoples of Mainland Southeast Asia. They established some of the earliest civilizations in the region, including Dvaravati in Central Thailand, which spread its culture into Northeastern Thailand, Sri Gotapura in Central Laos (modern Sikhottabong, Vientiane Prefecture), the Hariphunchai Kingdom in Northern Thailand, and the Thaton Kingdom in Lower Myanmar.The Mon were the first to receive Theravada Buddhist missionaries from Sri Lanka, in contrast to their Hindu contemporaries such as Cham peoples. They adopted the Pallava script, and the oldest form of the Mon script was discovered in a cave in modern-day Saraburi, dating back to around 550 CE. Although no remains have been found from the Thaton Kingdom, it is widely mentioned in Bamar and Lanna chronicles.

According to the Northern Thai Chronicles, the city of Lavo (modern Lopburi) was founded by Phaya Kalavarnadishraj in 648 CE. He reportedly came from Takkasila, which is assumed to be the city of Tak or Nakhon Chai Si. Another historical figure, Phaya Kakabatr, is believed to have also come from Takkasila and established the Chula Sakarat era in 638 CE, which was used by the Siamese and Burmese until the 19th century. Phaya Kalavarnadishraj, the son of Phaya Kakabatr, founded Lavo a decade later. By the late 7th century, Lavo had expanded to the north. The legendary Queen Camadevi, who was said to be a daughter of a Lavo king, according to the Northern Thai Chronicle Cāmadevivaṃsa, came to rule as the first queen of Hariphunchai (modern Lamphun) around 750-800 CE. A few years later, her son Prince Anantayot founded Khelang Nakhon (modern Lampang), playing a significant role in the history of the Hariphunchai Kingdom.

After the year 1000 CE, the Dvaravati Mon people faced constant pressure from Tai migrations from the north and Khmer invasions from the east. Many Dvaravati Mons fled to join other Mon civilizations in the present-day Lower Myanmar, while their descendants, the Nyah Kur people, still reside in Northeastern Thailand. Despite the pressure from the Northern Thai people, the Hariphunchai kingdom managed to survive as a Mon outpost in Northern Thailand.
In 1057 CE, King Anawrahta of the Pagan Kingdom conquered the Thaton Kingdom of the Mon people in Lower Burma. The Mon culture and script had a significant influence on the Bamar, bringing the Mons under Bamar control for the first time. Despite this, the Mon remained a majority in Lower Burma.

On one hand, the Hariphunchai Kingdom of the Mon prospered during the reign of King Aditayaraj in the early twelfth century. He is said to have fought wars with Suryavarman II of Angkor between 1113 and 1150 CE and constructed the Hariphunchai stupa

In 1289, Mangrai also known as &quot;Mengrai&quot; was visited by merchants from the Mon kingdom of Haripunchai. Hearing of the wealth of that kingdom, he determined to conquer it, against the advice of his counselors. As it was thought impossible to take the city by force, Mangrai sent a merchant named Ai Fa as a mole to gain the confidence of its Phaya Yi Ba. In time, Ai Fa became the Chief Minister and managed to undermine the King&#x27;s authority. In 1292, taking advantage of discontent among the people, Mangrai defeated the Mon kingdom of Haripunchai and added it to his kingdom. Phaya Yi Ba, the last king of Hariphunchai, was forced to flee south to Lampang. A few years later, Phaya Yi Ba&#x27;s son, King Boek of Lampang, attacked Chiang Mai with a large army. King Mangrai and his second son, Prince Khram, led the defence against the Lampang army. Prince Khram defeated King Boek in personal combat on elephant-back at Khua Mung, a village near Lamphun. King Boek fled by way of the Doi Khun Tan mountain range between Lamphun and Lampang, but he was caught and executed. King Mangrai&#x27;s troops occupied the city of Lampang, and Phaya Yi Ba was made to flee further south, this time to Phitsanulok. The Mon culture was integrated into Lan Na culture. The Lan Na adopted the Mon script and religion.

=== 13th to 15th centuries ===

In 1287, the collapse of the Pagan Kingdom created a power vacuum. Wareru, who was born to a Mon mother and a Tai father in Donwun Village in the Thaton District, went to Sukhothai for trade and later eloped with the daughter of the king. He established himself as king of the Mon in Martaban (present-day Mottama), and later moved the capital to Pegu. His Hanthawaddy Kingdom, which existed from 1287 to 1539, was a period of prosperity and power for the Mon.

In the mid-14th century, King Binnya U ruled over the Mon kingdom and successfully defended against an invasion by Lan Na. Despite losing control over the Tenasserim region, he was able to re-establish his capital at Pegu. After his death in 1384, King Razadarit, Binnya U&#x27;s son, took over and formed an alliance with the kingdom of Arakan. King Razadarit was known for his administration skills and successfully repelling invasions from the Ava Kingdom during his reign. He made significant contributions to the Shwedagon Pagoda and is considered one of the most celebrated Mon kings in history, with his reign lasting from 1384 to 1421.

After King Razadarit&#x27;s death, there were brief disputes over the succession in Pegu. Eventually, King Razadarit was succeeded by his daughter, Queen Shin Sawbu, in 1453. Queen Shin Sawbu, was a skilled politician and maintained harmony between rival kingdoms. She is remembered for her good nature, renovation of the Shwedagon Pagoda, and construction of important monasteries, such as the Kyaikmaraw near Moulmein.

King Dhammazedi, who succeeded Queen Shin Sawbu in 1470, was a just and wise ruler. He is remembered for his generosity, having donated a significant amount of gold to the Shwedagon Pagoda, as well as for building important temples in the vicinity of Pegu, including the Shwegugyi Pagoda.

=== 16th to 17th centuries ===
In the early sixteenth century, the Bamar regained their momentum at Taungoo, leading to the fall of Hanthawaddy to King Tabinshwehti in 1539. This was after a devastating attack on Lower Burma, in which the northern army overran the Irrawaddy Delta and captured Pegu. The siege of Pegu lasted four years and involved Portuguese mercenaries fighting on both sides. The History of Kings attributes Tabinshwehti&#x27;s success, in part, to the decadence of the Mon king, Dhammazedi&#x27;s heir.

As a result of the fall of Pegu, large numbers of Mon refugees fled to Ayutthaya, where the Mon aristocracy joined the court and exercised considerable influence. Meanwhile, back in Burma, the fall of Martaban in 1541 was accompanied by massacre and pillage on a large scale, as was the capture of the old Pyu capital of Prome the following year. This marked the first time, since before the Mongol invasions, that most of Lower and Central Burma was under the control of a Bamar monarch. King Tabinshwehti, founder of the new Toungoo dynasty, celebrated by decorating the Shwedagon and other pagodas with huge amounts of plundered gold.

Although Tabinshwehti&#x27;s made efforts to win over the Mon people, the Bamar monarch consistently emphasized his claim to Bamar nationality and sovereignty. Nevertheless, Tabinshwehti was relatively more tolerant than later Toungoo kings who outlawed the Mon language and persecuted the Mon people.

Following Tabinshwehti&#x27;s coronation in 1546, Ayutthaya launched several raids on Lower Burma, including the successful capture of Tavoy in 1548. With the Toungoo dynasty in disarray after Tabinshwehti&#x27;s death in 1550, the Mon launched another bid for independence under the leadership of the legendary Mon rebel, the Smim Htaw. The Smim Htaw managed to capture the ancient settlement of Dagon and drive the Burmese from Pegu, but a series of intra-Mon disputes allowed Tabinshwehti&#x27;s general, Bayinnaung, to recapture the city.

Despite Bayinnaung allowing the Mon people to rule over townships and villages and accept them into the military, he did not grant them the right of national self-determination, and therefore the Mon became subservient to the Bamar. Significant Mon uprisings took place during Bayinnaung&#x27;s reign, including in 1551 and 1564 when the royal palace at Pegu was destroyed.

Following the death of King Bayinnaung, his successor King Nanda instituted oppressive policies against the Mon people, leading to the Mon chiefs Phaya Kiat and Phaya Ram attempting to assassinate Naresuan of Phitsanulok in 1584. However, they learned that Naresuan was not responsible for the policies and instead joined his campaigns against the Toungoo court. 

In the 17th century, the Bamar king Anaukpetlun launched a counter-attack against the Mon rebels and captured their stronghold at Syriam. Eventually, the Mon lands were retaken, and the capital was moved to Pegu. An unsuccessful Mon uprising occurred in Martaban in 1661, which led to the pursuit of fleeing Mon refugees into Ayutthaya via the Three Pagodas Pass.

=== 18th to 19th centuries ===
In the early eighteenth century, the power of the Bamar declined rapidly. The Mon rebels joined forces with the Gwe Shan to restore their former Hanthawaddy Kingdom, and in 1740, a monk with Taungoo royal lineage was made king of Pegu. Binnya Dala succeeded him in 1747, and with French support, the Mon established an independent kingdom called the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. However, the kingdom fell to Bamar King Alaungpaya in 1757, who invaded and devastated the kingdom, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of Mon civilians, including learned Mon monks, pregnant women, and children. The victorious Bamar soldiers massacred over 3,000 Mon monks in the capital city alone. During the Konbaung dynasty of Burma, the Mon people experienced harsh rule and massacres that led to a significant migration to Siam and Lanna. In addition to facing widespread violence and persecution, the Mon rebelled multiple times, including at Dagon during the reign of Hsinbyushin, resulting in the destruction of the city. In 1814, the Mon rebelled again, but were harshly put down yet again. These uprisings played a major role in the large wave of Mon migration from Burma to Siam.

On the one hand in Siam side, after the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767, two descendants of Mon aristocrats who moved to Siam in 1584; Phraya Pichai and Phraya Chakri became the left and right-hand man of King Taksin of Thonburi, and they largely helped Taksin&#x27;s campaigns in the liberation of Siam from Burmese occupation and reuniting Siam. King Taksin himself also was a Sino-Mon descent and his maternal grandmother was a sister to chief of Siam&#x27;s Mon community.

After the collapse of Taksin&#x27;s Thonburi Kingdom, Phraya Chakri founded the Chakri dynasty and ascended the throne in 1782 as Rama I. Rama I was born to Thongdi, a leading Mon nobleman serving the royal court in Ayutthaya in 1737. Rama I&#x27;s queen consort Amarindra was born to a wealthy Mon family who migrated to Siam in the earlier times. Rama I founded Bangkok City and moved the capital from Thonburi to Bangkok. When a huge wave of Mon migrations from Burma (now Myanmar) to Siam (now Thailand) happened in 1814, his grandson, the Prince Mongkut (later Rama IV) proceeded to welcome the Mon himself at the Siam-Burma border.

The Mon in Thailand settled mainly in certain areas of Central Thailand, such as Pak Kret in Nonthaburi, Phra Pradaeng in Samut Prakan and Ban Pong, among other minor Mon settlements. Mon communities built their own Buddhist temples. Over time, the Mons were effectively integrated into Siamese society and culture, although maintaining some of their traditions and identity.

=== 19th to 20th centuries ===

Burma was conquered by the British in a series of wars. After the Second Anglo-Burmese War in 1852, the Mon territories in Burma were completely under the control of the British. The British aided the Mons to free themselves from the rule of the Bamar monarchy. Under Bamar rule, the Mon people had been massacred after they lost their kingdom and many sought asylum in the Thai Kingdom. The British conquest of Burma allowed the Mon people to survive in Southern Burma.

In 1947, Mon National Day was established to commemorate the founding of Hanthawady, the last Mon Kingdom which was centered in Pegu. The holiday is observed on the full moon of the 11th month of the Mon lunar calendar, except in Phrapadaeng, Thailand where it coincides with the Songkran festival.

The Mon soon became anti-colonialists. Following the grant of independence to Burma in 1948, they sought self-determination. U Nu, the first Prime Minister of Burma refused the Mon self-determination. Mon separatist groups have risen in revolt against the central Burmese government on a number of occasions, initially under the Mon People&#x27;s Front and from 1962 through the New Mon State Party (NMSP). The BSSP-led government established a partially autonomous Mon State in 1974 out of portions of Tenasserim and Pegu regions. Resistance continued until 1995 when NMSP and ruling SLORC agreed a cease-fire and, in 1996, the Mon Unity League was founded.

=== 21st century ===
Nowadays, the Mon are a major ethnic group in Myanmar and a minor ethnic group in Thailand. The Mons from Myanmar are called Burmese Mon or Myanmar Mon. The Mons from Thailand are referred as Thai Raman or Thai Mon. A recent study shows that there is a close genetic relationship between central Thai and Mon people in Thailand, who migrated from southern Myanmar.

Due to the post-independence internal conflict in Myanmar, many ethnic Mon from conflict zones have migrated to the First World countries via the refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar borders and in Malaysia. The Myanmar Mon refugee communities can be found in the United States (the largest community being in Fort Wayne, Indiana and the second largest being Akron, Ohio), Australia, Canada, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the Netherlands.

==Language==
The Mon language is part of the Monic group of the Austroasiatic languages (also known as Mon–Khmer language family), closely related to the Nyah Kur language and more distantly related to Khmer and Vietnamese. The writing system is based on Indic scripts. The Mon language is one of the earliest documented vernacular languages of Mainland Southeast Asia.

Many languages in the region have been influenced by the Mon language. Tai Tham alphabet and Burmese alphabet are adaptations of the Mon script. Tai Tham alphabet is primarily used for Northern Thai language, Tai Lue language, Khün language and Lao Tham language. The Burmese alphabet is used for Burmese language, Shan language, S&#x27;gaw Karen language and other languages.

Historically, the Tai adopted the Mon alphabet, which the Tai developed into their own writing systems as the Tai Tham alphabet, for the Thai Yuan people in the northern Thailand.

Although Thai adopted more features from the Old Khmer alphabet than from the Mon, plenty of vocabulary in Thai language today were derived from the Mon language. Burmese has derived and borrowed vocabulary from the Mon language, especially related to administration, architecture, cloth, cuisine and flowers.

Nowadays, the Mon language is recognised as an indigenous language in both Myanmar and Thailand. Due to the fall in number of Mon language speakers in the recent decades, Mon was classified as a &quot;vulnerable&quot; language in UNESCO&#x27;s 2010 &quot;Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger.&quot;

The language has an estimated 800,000 Thousand - 1,000,000 Million speakers
==Culture==

=== Symbol ===
The symbol of the Mon people is the hongsa (, ), a mythological water bird that is often illustrated as a swan. It is commonly known by its Burmese name, &quot;hintha&quot; (, ) or its Thai name: &quot;hong&quot; (หงส์). The hongsa is the state symbol of Myanmar&#x27;s Bago Region and Mon State, two historical Mon strongholds. Also, the hongsa is the city symbol of Thailand&#x27;s Pak Kret City, a historical Mon settlement area.

=== Music===
Mon culture and traditional heritages includes spiritual dances, musical instruments such as the kyam or &quot;crocodile xylophone&quot;, the la gyan hsaing gong chime, the saung harp and a flat stringed instrument. Mon dances are usually played in a formal theater or sometimes in an informal district of any village. The dances are followed by background music using a circular set of tuned drums and claps, crocodile xylophone, gongs, flute, flat guitar, harp, violin, etc.
===Art===
====Pottery====
The Mon people in Thailand have been producing pottery for over 200 years. Their ancestors settled in Koh Kret and Nakhon Sawan, using their pottery making skills to earn a living in both places. The area is known for its high-quality clay and the Mon pottery, including containers and decorative items, is a symbol of their heritage and expertise. The pottery is made of porous earthenware in light orange to red color and features unique designs inspired by nature. Despite technological advancements, the Mon continue to preserve this traditional handicraft.

====Floral umbrellas====
Floral umbrellas have a long history in Mon culture, dating back to ancient times. In fact, inscriptions have been discovered in northern Thailand that mention the use of umbrellas and palm-leaf manuscripts in Mon religious ceremonies during the Hariphunchai Kingdom, which lasted from the 7th to the 13th century. Today, floral umbrellas are still used in various ceremonies and festivals throughout Mon communities, such as weddings, ordinations, and temple fairs, and remain an important part of Mon cultural heritage.

===Literature===
Mon literature is a rich collection of works created by the Mon people in Myanmar and Thailand, including chronicles, poems, songs, folktales, and religious texts. &quot;Lik Smin Asah&quot; is a legendary tale about the establishment of the city of Pegu, &quot;Sangada&quot; is a well-known Mon folktale that has been adapted into Thai and Laotian literature as &quot;Sangsinchay&quot;, and &quot;Rājādhirāj&quot; or &quot;Razadarit&quot; is a chronicle of the Mon king translated into Burmese as &quot;Razadarit Ayedawbon&quot; and into Thai as &quot;Rachathirat.&quot; Mon literature is considered important cultural heritage in Myanmar and Thailand. These works are highly valued for their cultural and historical significance.

=== Religion ===
The Mon people have a mix of spiritual beliefs and Theravada Buddhism as their religion, with a majority of them practicing the mixture. Before Buddhism, three traditional beliefs were followed in the Mon Kingdom, including belief in Kalok (spirits), Isi (holy hermits), and Hinduism. The Mon people traditionally believed in various types of Kaloks (spirits), including family/clan kalok, guardian kalok of the house, town, village, farms, forest, and mountain. Kalok is considered to be a spirit, demon, or immaterial being that can take on a visible form.

=== Festivals ===
Festivals celebrating Mon culture are an important part of the Mon community in Myanmar and Thailand. One such festival is the Loi Hamod Festival, which has its roots in the Hariphunchai era and is believed to be the precursor to the Loi Krathong Festival. While the festival is still observed in some Mon communities in Lamphun Province, it is now referred to as &quot;Jong Gring&quot;, which is derived from other Mon cultural practices and means &quot;Loi Krathong&quot;. However, the Jong Gring tradition of Mon people in Lamphun is different from the general Loi Krathong festival, as it resembles the ancient &quot;Loi Hamod&quot; tradition of Mon people in Hariphunchai, which involves offering food, both fresh and dried, and lighting some lanterns and small krathongs.

Another traditional Mon festival is the Luknoo Festival, which marks the end of the monsoon season and the beginning of the new year. It involves the launch of homemade rockets, food offerings to spirits, and cultural activities such as music, dance, and games. The festival is an important part of Mon culture and helps to connect with the community, preserve traditions, and bring good luck for the coming year.

The Mon Floating Boat Festival is another traditional festival celebrated during the Mon New Year. It features boat races, music, dance, feasting, releasing lanterns, and gift exchanging. The festival brings the Mon community together to make offerings for peace and prosperity.

The Hae Hang Hong Tong Ta Khab Festival, also known as the Tawai Tong Ta Khab Festival, is an important tradition of the Mon people in Thailand, primarily in Pathum Thani, Pak Kret, and Phra Pradaeng. The festival is held during the Songkran festival and features a parade of flags that move towards the Hongsa Pole to offer tribute to the Buddha. Prior to the festival, the flags are prepared through the collective efforts of many individuals who come together to sew and decorate them.

During the Songkran festival in Thailand, the Mon residents of Phra Pradaeng District host unique Mon traditional ceremonies and folklore performances. These festivals and traditions are a testament to the rich cultural heritage of the Mon people and serve as an important way to pass down their history and customs to future generations.

=== Traditional dress===
Mon women wear traditional shawl-like &quot;Sbai&quot;, known as &quot;Yat Toot&quot; in Mon language, diagonally over the chest covering one shoulder with one end dropping behind the back. This tradition distinguished Mon women from other 134 ethnic groups in Myanmar. Archaeological evidence from the Dvaravati era portrays that Dvaravati ladies wearing what seems to be a piece of &quot;Sbai&quot; hanging from their shoulder. Mon people of Myanmar and Thailand today are the descendants of &quot;Dvaravati.&quot;

Mon men in Myanmar wear clothes similar to the Bamars. Those living in Thailand have adopted Thai style garments. It seems that Mon clothing has been shaped through its dynastic traditions as well as external influences.

Thanaka is a yellowish-white cosmetic paste made from ground bark that is widely used in Myanmar, particularly by the Mon people. It is applied to the face, arms and legs as a form of sun protection and to beautify the skin. Thanaka has been a part of Mon culture for centuries and remains an important part of traditional beauty and skincare practices in the country.

=== Cuisines ===
Mon cuisines and culinary traditions have had significant influences on the Burmese cuisine and Central Thai cuisine today. Some of dishes that are now popular in Myanmar (Burma) and Thailand were originally Mon dishes. For example, Htamanè (ထမနဲ) in Myanmar, and Khanom chin and Khao chae in Thailand. A traditional Mon dish served with rice soaked with cool candle-and-jasmine-scented water is consumed by the Mon people during the Thingyan (Songkran) Festival in the summer. In Thailand, the dish is known as Khao chae (ข้าวแช่) and was considered &quot;royal cuisine&quot;. As the dish is served during Thingyan as part of their merit-making, it is known as Thingyan rice (သင်္ကြန်ထမင်း) in Myanmar today. Like Cambodian, Lao, Thai and Vietnamese cuisine, fermented fish seasoning are used in Mon cuisine. 
=== Folk games ===
Many games in both Myanmar and Thailand were Mon origins. Among them, Len Saba (; ; ), Lor Kon Krok (Rolling a Mortar Bottom) and Mon Son Pa (Mon Hides a Cloth) are the most famous Mon traditional children games and are recognised as Intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO.

<text>Stuart Leslie Goddard (born 3 November 1954), known professionally as Adam Ant, is an English singer, musician, and actor. He gained popularity as the lead singer of new wave group Adam and the Ants and later as a solo artist, scoring 10 UK top ten hits from 1980 to 1983, including three UK No. 1 singles. He has also worked as an actor, appearing in many films and television episodes.

Ant began his musical career playing bass in the band Bazooka Joe. From 1977 to 1982 he performed with Adam and the Ants. Their debut album &quot;Dirk Wears White Sox&quot; (1979) reached number one on the UK Independent Albums Chart. Before recording his debut album as Adam and the Ants, he asked producer Malcolm McLaren to manage his band; McLaren instead took his backing band to form Bow Wow Wow. Ant regrouped with new members, including Marco Pirroni, to release his second album &quot;Kings of the Wild Frontier&quot; (1980). It reached number one in the UK Album Chart, spawned three hit singles, became the UK number-one selling album in 1981, and won Best British Album at the 1982 BRIT Awards. He released his third and final album with the group, &quot;Prince Charming&quot; (1981), which spawned two UK number-one singles &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; and &quot;Prince Charming&quot;.

In 1982, he began a solo career, retaining Marco Pirroni as co-songwriter. His first solo album was &quot;Friend or Foe&quot; (1982), from which the debut single &quot;Goody Two Shoes&quot; reached number one in the UK and Australia in 1982, and became his first top 20 hit in the United States on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album reached number five on the UK Albums Chart and number 16 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, becoming his most successful solo album. His next two solo albums &quot;Strip&quot; (1983) and &quot;Vive Le Rock&quot; (1985) were less commercially successful. Ant began to focus on an acting career, performing on stage and in film and television roles throughout the 1980s and 1990s. He released his fourth solo album &quot;Manners &amp; Physique&quot; (1990) which was produced by André Cymone and featured a Minneapolis sound. Despite the US top 20 success of the single &quot;Room at the Top&quot;, Ant was dropped from MCA Records, and his album &quot;Persuasion&quot; (1991) was shelved and never officially released. He signed with Capitol Records to release &quot;Wonderful&quot; (1995). The single &quot;Wonderful&quot; became Ant&#x27;s third US top 40 hit single.

Since 2010, Ant has continued his music career, recording and releasing a new album &quot;Adam Ant Is the Blueblack Hussar in Marrying the Gunner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2013, UK number 25), and completing eight full-length UK national tours, five US national tours, and two Australian tours. A further album, &quot;Bravest of the Brave&quot;, was recorded in 2014 and is still awaiting release.

==Early life==
Stuart Goddard was born in Marylebone, London, the only child of Leslie Alfred Goddard and Betty Kathleen Smith. His father had served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) and worked as a chauffeur, and his mother was an embroiderer for Norman Hartnell. His home was two rooms in the De Walden buildings, St John&#x27;s Wood. He recalls: &quot;There was no luxury, but there was always food on the table.&quot; He is of partial Romani descent; his maternal grandfather, Walter Albany Smith, was Romanichal. This heritage became a basis for a theme in his later work: a concern for oppressed minorities.

Goddard&#x27;s parents divorced when he was seven years old and his mother supported him by working as a domestic cleaner, being briefly employed by Paul McCartney. Goddard&#x27;s first school was Robinsfield Infants School, where he created a considerable stir by throwing a brick through the head-teacher&#x27;s office window on two consecutive days. In the aftermath of this incident, Goddard was placed under the supervision of teacher Joanna Saloman, who encouraged him to develop his abilities in art and whom he later credited as the first person to show him he could be creative.

Goddard then attended Barrow Hill Junior School where he boxed and was a member of the cricket team. He passed the eleven plus exam to gain a place at St Marylebone Grammar School, an all-boys school, where he enjoyed history, played rugby, and became a school prefect. After passing six O levels and three A levels, in English, History and Art, Goddard attended Hornsey College of Art to study graphic design, and was a student of art historian Peter Webb for a time. He dropped out of Hornsey, short of completing his BA, to focus on a career in music.

===Early musical career===
The first band Goddard joined was Bazooka Joe, in which he played bass guitar. He has said that the idea of Adam Ant came to him after watching the Sex Pistols play their first gig opening for Bazooka Joe at Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art in 1975: &quot;After seeing the Pistols, I wanted to do something different, be someone else, but couldn&#x27;t work out what and [whom].&quot;: 92, 94

He renamed himself Adam Ant, choosing the name because &quot;I really knew I wanted to be Adam, because Adam was the first man. Ant I chose because, if there&#x27;s a nuclear explosion, the ants will survive.&quot; He formed his own band, the B-Sides, with Lester Square and Andy Warren.: 94 In 1977, together with drummer Paul Flanagan, they went on to form Adam and the Ants (initially named just &quot;The Ants&quot;), with the inaugural band meeting held in the audience at a Siouxsie and the Banshees performance at The Roxy in London&#x27;s Covent Garden.

==Musical career==
===1977–1982: Adam and the Ants===

Adam and the Ants began performing around London while Ant acted in Derek Jarman&#x27;s film &quot;Jubilee&quot; in 1977. They were initially managed by Jordan from the SEX boutique on Kings Road. His debut as a recording artist was the song &quot;Deutscher Girls&quot;, which featured on the film&#x27;s soundtrack, along with &quot;Plastic Surgery&quot; which was performed in the film. In late 1979 they released their debut album &quot;Dirk Wears White Sox&quot; (1979, Do It Records) featuring Matthew Ashman on guitar, Andy Warren on bass and Dave Barbarossa on drums.

Ant approached Malcolm McLaren to manage the band, who subsequently hired the rest of the Ants to form Bow Wow Wow fronted by Annabella Lwin. The second version of Adam and the Ants featured Marco Pirroni (guitar), Kevin Mooney (bass guitar), and two drummers, Terry Lee Miall and Chris Hughes (formerly of Dalek I Love You), who used the name &quot;Merrick&quot;. The band signed a deal with CBS Records and recorded &quot;Kings of the Wild Frontier&quot; during the summer of 1980. The album gained success in the United Kingdom, and the &quot;Antmania&quot; that ensued put the band at the forefront of the New Romantic movement. The single &quot;Antmusic&quot; went to No. 2 on the UK singles chart by December 1980. Following the departure of Mooney in February 1981, bassist Gary Tibbs, formerly of Roxy Music, joined the band.

In November 1981, Adam &amp; the Ants released the album, &quot;Prince Charming,&quot; that featured two United Kingdom No. 1 singles – &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; and the title track, &quot;Prince Charming&quot; – as well as the No. 3 UK hit &quot;Ant Rap&quot;. In March 1982 the group disbanded.

===1982–2001: Solo career===
A few months after Adam and the Ants split, Ant launched his solo career and retained Pirroni as guitarist and co-songwriter. Merrick also briefly stayed as drummer and producer for the UK edition of the first solo hit single &quot;Goody Two Shoes&quot;—which made it to No. 1 in the UK—and demos for the upcoming &quot;Friend or Foe&quot; album, before moving on to other production work. The &quot;Friend or Foe&quot; album also produced another top ten single, &quot;Friend or Foe&quot;, which reached No. 9 in September 1982.

Ant recruited a new band for touring, consisting of new dual drummers Bogdan Wiczling (ex-Fingerprintz) and Barry Watts (ex-Q-Tips), plus guitarist Cha Burns (also ex-Fingerprintz), bassist Chris Constantinou and the former Q-Tips brass section of trumpeter Tony Hughes and twin saxophonists Stewart van Blandamer and Steve Farr. The new band made its debut at London&#x27;s Astoria Theatre on 1 October 1982. A US tour began in New York on 8 November. On the 19th tour date on 20 February 1983 in Cleveland, Ohio, Ant suffered a knee injury onstage (a relapse of a previous injury suffered while filming &quot;Jubilee&quot; in 1977), forcing the postponement and/or cancellation of dates throughout February and March while he recuperated. Ant eventually returned to performing, appearing as a guest on the NBC special &quot;Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever&quot;, singing &quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot; with Diana Ross. He resumed the US tour, completed on 18 May 1983 at the Bronco Bowl in Dallas, Texas.

During his recuperation from the knee injury, Ant worked with Pirroni on new material that formed the basis of Ant&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Strip&quot;. With promotion on the &quot;Strip&quot; album complete, Ant reduced his band to the quartet of himself, Pirroni (now out of retirement again), Wiczling and Constantinou. The latter two adopted the stage names &quot;Count&quot; Wiczling and Chris &quot;De Niro&quot; respectively and were upgraded from live backing musicians to being full-time band members, featured on record sleeves, logos and even in song lyrics. The LP &quot;Strip&quot; produced a top ten single, &quot;Puss&#x27;n Boots&quot;, that reached No. 5 in the UK charts in October 1983. Ant formally unveiled his new four-piece band at the 1984 Montreux Pop Festival,

In July 1985, Ant secured a spot at the Live Aid concert – the first live performance of the &quot;Ant/Marco/Wiczling/De Niro&quot; band – but was asked to cut his set to one song, for which he chose his new single, the &quot;Vive Le Rock&quot; title track Ant later claimed to regret playing the fundraiser, saying, &quot;I was asked by Sir Bob to promote this concert. They had no idea they could sell it out. Then in Bob&#x27;s book, he said, &#x27;Adam was over the hill so I let him have one number.&#x27;... Doing that show was the biggest f**king mistake in the world. Knighthoods were made, Bono got it made, and it was a waste of f**king time. It was the end of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.&quot;

A year after the hit single success of &quot;Apollo 9&quot;, which reached No. 13 in September 1984, the parent album &quot;Vive Le Rock&quot; was released in September 1985, to mixed reviews. As part of the promotion, the band performed a live TV session for Channel 4 music show &quot;Bliss&quot; hosted by Muriel Gray. Several songs were recorded, although only two – &quot;Miss Thing&quot; from the new album and &quot;Killer in the Home&quot; from &quot;Kings of the Wild Frontier&quot; – were actually transmitted.

Ant paused his career in music at the end of 1985 to focus on his acting career. His Fort Lauderdale show was Ant&#x27;s last full-length concert until February 1993. Indeed, between December 1982 and February 1995, Ant&#x27;s only public live concerts outside North America were the four aforementioned UK/Spanish shows, Live Aid, a 1987 fanclub party performance, and a September 1994 EMI corporate event in Brighton. He severed ties with CBS in late 1986, following the release of the &quot;Hits&quot; audio/VHS compilation. In 1990, Ant returned with &quot;Manners &amp; Physique&quot;, a collaboration with André Cymone, a solo artist and an early member of Prince&#x27;s band. The album was another moderate success, and featured the single &quot;Room at the Top&quot;, which was a Top 20 hit on both sides of the Atlantic. &quot;Rough Stuff&quot; became the second single for the United States and Germany as &quot;Can&#x27;t Set Rules About Love&quot; charted in the United Kingdom.

In 1992, Nine Inch Nails released a cover of Adam &amp; the Ants&#x27; &quot;Physical (You&#x27;re So)&quot; on their &quot;Broken&quot; EP, originally released on the &quot;Kings of the Wild Frontier&quot; LP.&quot; Subsequently in 1995, Adam Ant performed &quot;Physical&quot; live with Nine Inch Nails on their Self Destruct Tour for two nights in a row.

In 1995, Ant released the album, &quot;Wonderful&quot;. The title track was a successful single, as was a tour of the US in support of the album. While Ant and his group, which retained longtime guitarist Pirroni alongside Kris Dollimore (The Godfathers, The Damned), Bruce Whitkin, Dave Ruffy (The Ruts) and Dave Barbarossa (Adam and the Ants, Bow Wow Wow), played in smaller venues than they had played in the 1980s, the houses were often packed with enthusiastic fans. The tour was cut short due to Ant and Pirroni both contracting glandular fever. Ant also played three shows at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London and did a mini tour of Virgin Record Shops playing selected tunes from the album &quot;Wonderful&quot; and signing records. Adam and his band also played shows in Dublin, Glasgow, Middlesbrough and Stoke-on-Trent.
In 1996, Ant and Pirroni recorded two new songs, &quot;Lamé&quot; and &quot;Inseminator&quot;, for the soundtrack to Ant&#x27;s latest film &quot;Drop Dead Rock&quot;. Also around this time, they recorded a cover version of the T. Rex song &quot;Dandy in the Underworld&quot;. The duo continued to demo other songs around this time, including such titles as &quot;Tough Blokes&quot;, &quot;Justine&quot;, &quot;Picasso Meets Gary Cooper&quot; and &quot;Call Me Sausage&quot; (the last of which leaked out into bootleg circulation among fans). These new songs with Pirroni were for Ant&#x27;s own new label Blend Records. Pirroni later referred to these recordings as the &quot;Blend Demos&quot;. They also guested with such bands as Dweeb and Rachel Stamp. In 2001, following the 11 September attacks, Ant recorded a charity single for New York firefighters; a double A-side of Neil Diamond&#x27;s &quot;America&quot; with his own song &quot;Big Trouble&quot;. In interviews from the time, Ant talked of numerous varied plans, including starting another new record label, reforming Adam and the Ants, and a star-studded benefit concert for a forest in Patagonia.

===2002–2009: Autobiography===
In 2003, the Channel 4 television special titled &quot;The Madness of Prince Charming&quot;
was aired in the UK documenting Ant&#x27;s career and his struggle with mental illness (he was diagnosed as suffering with bipolar disorder).

In 2003, Ant and &quot;Wonderful&quot; collaborator, Boz Boorer, teamed with the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund (now called The Gorilla Organisation) in a reworking of &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; as &quot;Save the Gorillas&quot; for an EP of the same name along with four primate/rainforest-themed covers. Originally intended as a benefit record for the endangered mountain gorilla, it was never released, due to copyright and licensing issues relating to the title track. One track from the EP, &quot;Jungle Rock&quot;, was eventually released on Boorer&#x27;s 2008 solo LP &quot;Miss Pearl&quot;.

Ant made a guest appearance on an EP released in 2005—&quot;Mike&#x27;s Bikes&quot; by former Ants bassist Kevin Mooney&#x27;s new band, the Lavender Pill Mob, on Mooney&#x27;s own label Le Coq Musique. Ant provided lead vocals for &quot;Black Pirates&quot;, a reworking of the song &quot;Chicken Outlaw&quot; by Mooney&#x27;s earlier band Wide Boy Awake, inspired by Mooney&#x27;s departure from the Ants.

In September 2006, he published his autobiography, &quot;Stand &amp; Deliver&quot;. Marking the release of the book, Ant did a UK book signing, which went from London to Edinburgh. After the success of the first edition the paperback edition was published in September 2007, which contains a new epilogue that covers the year following the initial hardback release. As part of the promotion of the paperback, Ant performed a reading of selected passages of the book along with acoustic songs (accompanied by childhood friend Dave Pash on guitar) at the Bloomsbury Theatre, London on 24 September. A live CD of highlights of the gig, &quot;Live at the Bloomsbury&quot; was released the following year.

===2010–2012: Independent label and return to touring===
On 4 March 2010, Adam Ant registered his new label Blue Black Hussar Ltd. as a private limited company at Companies House. That month also marked a return to live music. Ant&#x27;s first live performance since The Bloomsbury in 2007 was at Through The Looking Glass bookshop in London on 18 March, at which he played &quot;Ants Invasion&quot;, &quot;Cartrouble&quot;, &quot;Physical&quot;, and a cover of Iggy Pop&#x27;s &quot;The Passenger&quot;. A day later, on 19 March, Ant guested at a Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction gig at the Pipeline Bar, London E1, in which he provided lead vocals for the band&#x27;s Top 20 hit &quot;Prime Mover&quot;.
Ant performed another low key show at the Southwark Playhouse on Saturday 20 March. During the intervals Ant talked about Sony Records, how he rejected an alleged £2.6 million O2 deal, and a new album collaboration with Chris McCormack.

Ant played a sold-out headline concert, dubbed The Pirate Metal Extravaganza at the Scala in London on 30 April. He also performed some smaller guerilla gigs in Autumn 2010, which received no advance billing, including a solo show at the Dark Mills festival at London&#x27;s Colour House Theatre on 4 September 2010, the launch party of the Illamasqua store on 16 September (at which Boy George served as DJ), and a guest spot at the Monster Raving Loony Party&#x27;s annual conference in Fleet, Hampshire, on 25 September. On 21 October, Ant performed at the Union Chapel, London.

Ant headlined at the Scala again on 18 November, joined by a trio of female backing singers. The gig received positive reviews and three days later again topped the bill at a tribute concert for former Ant Matthew Ashman on 21 November at the same venue, in a show also featuring later Ashman bands Bow Wow Wow, Chiefs of Relief, Agent Provocateur and London rock act Slam Cartel. Ant was back playing live two days later on 23 December, when he and backing vocalist Georgina Baillee guested onstage at the Christmas party of West Rocks at Shepherds Bar in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and played live again at Proud, Camden on 5 January 2011 and at Madame Jojo&#x27;s in Soho on 17 January. He finished the month by playing further dates of his World Tour of London with a two-night stand at the 100 Club on 26 and 27 January 2011.

Ant spent time in Paris where he played low-key shows (his first gigs outside the UK in nearly 16 years.). On 29 March 2011, BBC Radio 4 transmitted an interview of Ant by John Humphrys for the &quot;On the Ropes&quot; series in which Ant discussed his bipolar condition and its impact on his career. That same day, Ant held a press conference and media preview gig at Under The Bridge in Chelsea at which he formally unveiled plans for an eleven date UK concert tour (as with the Paris concert, the first such event in 16 years) due to run from 16 May to 4 June 2011. Also announced at the Chelsea event was a public screening of the December 1981 Prince Charming Revue concert video plus a question-and-answer session to be held in South London&#x27;s Coronet Cinema on 11 May 2011. By the time the tour got underway on 16 May in Brighton, the original eleven date itinerary had been expanded to fifteen dates. Ant completed the schedule of tour dates which were overwhelmingly enthusiastically received.

There was one negative onstage incident at Fat Sam&#x27;s in Dundee on 21 May 2011 when Ant reacted angrily to some crowd elements who booed his kilt decorated with the St George&#x27;s Cross. The tour closed in Manchester on 5 June with a show at the city&#x27;s Manchester Academy.

 The Seaside Tour follow-up to the main UK tour and a warm-up to Ant&#x27;s appearance at Hard Rock Calling 2011 in Hyde Park, London, on 26 June 2011, third on the bill to Rod Stewart and Stevie Nicks before an audience of 45,000. Ant later slotted in some more solo gigs, including the Soho Festival in London&#x27;s Wardour Street on 11 July. 

Ant also announced a follow-up UK tour (described as the &quot;second leg&quot; of the 2011 tour), initially scheduled to run for twelve dates from 11 November 2011 in Bristol until 13 December 2011 in Newcastle. As with the previous leg, Ant passed the time until the tour playing one-off dates, appearing with his tour band in Bedford on 10 September before three days later reuniting with 2010 band members Will Crewdson and Johnny Love for a charity show on board . As with the previous tour, the itinerary was expanded from the initial 12 dates to an eventual 21 dates running from 10 November in Frome until 16 December in Norwich. Just three days after the final Norwich date of the tour, Ant was back onstage again with two members of his live band on 19 December at a charity event at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s. The first record release of Ant&#x27;s 2010s comeback also occurred at this point, with the release of the &quot;Sex Drugs and HIV&quot; compilation album featuring Ant&#x27;s version of &quot;Get a Grip&quot; which had been recorded a year earlier while the World Tour of London was in progress.

A few days before the end of the second leg of his UK tour, it was officially announced that Ant would make his return to the US with a 15-date North American tour in February 2012, starting on 2 February in Ant&#x27;s former adopted hometown of Los Angeles and running until 25 February in nearby Anaheim. A few days into the new year, however, it was announced that the tour was postponed until the autumn. A five-date warm-up UK mini tour for Ant and his band nonetheless went ahead for 19–24 January 2012.

An exhibition of photographs of Ant – titled &quot;Adam Ant – Dandy in the Underworld&quot; ran from 7 March 2012 to 29 April 2012 at Proud Camden in London, featuring images of Ant throughout his career, including the work of Chris Duffy, Gerard McNamara, Jill Furmanovsky, Denis O&#x27;Regan, Chris Cuffaro, Hannah Domagala, Robert Matheu, David Corio and Janette Beckman. To promote this exhibition, Ant performed a solo charity concert at the gallery on 6 March with the same two band members as the Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club concert from the previous December. The concert was well received, although an inebriated Chrissie Hynde who was in attendance, heckled throughout the performance. While this exhibition was on, Ant took his band on tour to Australia with an initial five date schedule spread over a two-week period from 23 March to 8 April, taking in Sydney, Perth, Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane. In mid February, Ant made a warm-up visit to Australia, including an appearance on the &quot;Adam Hills in Gordon Street Tonight&quot; show recorded on 13 February 2012 for transmission on 15 February and promotional work in Melbourne and Sydney.

Although poor ticket sales forced the cancellation of the Adelaide gig, the remaining four concerts all went ahead. The &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; gave a reservedly positive review of the opening Sydney date on 23 March (which it rated three stars out of five), noting &quot;In a set plus two encores (the first cheered for; the second not really but played anyway) comprising 30 songs, it was kind of the equivalent of throwing a lot of make-up at the mirror and seeing what stuck.&quot; Ant also made further Australian TV appearances including a return to &quot;Adam Hills in Gordon Street Tonight&quot; recorded on 26 March for transmission on 28 March, including live performances of &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; and new album track &quot;Vince Taylor&quot; with his full band.
Subsequently, for the second year running, Ant was scheduled to make appearances on the summer festival circuit, interspersed with various one-off dates around the UK. This got off to an early start when Ant stepped in as replacement headliner at the Bearded Theory festival in Derby on 18 May 2012, when the Levellers had to pull out due to one of the band members being injured. Ant also played the first full band concert in continental Europe of his 2010s comeback on 24 June 2012 at the Parkpop festival in the Zuiderpark in the Hague, Netherlands, with his set broadcast on Dutch national TV. After six assorted dates around the UK in early July, Ant&#x27;s next major show was a headline slot at the Silverstone Classic Festival on 21 July followed the next day by an appearance at Rewind in Perth and then at Camp Bestival on 27 July 2012. 

The rest of the summer saw Ant mix festivals such as the Summer Sundae Weekender on 18 August, Solfest on 24 August and the Isle of Wight Festival with dates in such locations as Swindon, Southend-on-Sea, Warrington and Croydon. Later in the year, Ant&#x27;s postponed US tour finally went ahead, commencing 13 September in Los Angeles and finishing on 20 October in nearby Anaheim. The third UK tour of the 2010s, the Blueblack Hussar Tour, commenced on 1 November in Glasgow and ran to 30 November at London&#x27;s Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire. During the tour, the first single of the new album was released – &quot;Cool Zombie&quot;, with the formerly planned A-side &quot;Gun in Your Pocket&quot; now as the B-side. On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2012, Ant and his full band appeared on Jools Holland&#x27;s &quot;Hootenanny&quot; New Year music show, performing new album track &quot;Vince Taylor&quot; as well as old hits &quot;Stand And Deliver&quot; and &quot;Antmusic&quot;.

===2013–present: Release of new album, touring===

Ant&#x27;s album, the focal point of the comeback since 2010, finally received its release on 21 January 2013. Its gestation had a long history which had been running alongside the live comeback; in 2009, it was announced that Ant was planning on putting a new record out. He also expressed interest in working with The Kaiser Chiefs.

In an April 2010 interview for the NME, Ant announced he was also working on a new album, with the title &quot;Adam Ant Is the Blueblack Hussar in Marrying the Gunner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. This featured collaborations with former 3 Colours Red guitarist Chris McCormack, Ant&#x27;s long-time songwriting partner Marco Pirroni, Morrissey&#x27;s writing partner Boz Boorer and was also due to feature a member of Oasis (later identified as Andy Bell). According to Ant, the album is a &quot;live record that lends itself to performance&quot; and will feature a &quot;kind of concept. It&#x27;s a very old-fashioned, old-school, step-by-step album&quot;. He also described the album as &quot;very autobiographical, very personal.&quot; In addition, Ant re-recorded a song in tribute to the late Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, who died earlier that month, and who also once managed Adam &amp; The Ants. Named &quot;Who&#x27;s A Goofy Bunny Then?&quot;, the track was only previously available as a demo recorded in the early 1980s, but Ant stated he wanted to release a new version in tribute to the late punk manager. &quot;Malcolm was a sort of mentor in my life&quot;, he said. &quot;As close as you can get to a surrogate father&quot;. The song took its name from a term of endearment bestowed upon McLaren by Ant – referring to his &quot;quite prominent teeth&quot;.

On 31 December 2010, Ant gave an interview for &quot;The Sun&quot; (featured in the &quot;Something for the Weekend&quot; segment) in which he discussed in considerable detail the various controversies surrounding his recent life and musical activities. He summed up his upcoming album thus: &quot;The Blueblack Hussar is me coming back to life. I&#x27;m like The Terminator —- I was a dead man walking&quot;. He also discussed individual songs on the album — as well as &quot;Gun in Your Pocket&quot; (which, aside from the Troubador live performance, had also been given a club dancefloor play by Ant himself as guest DJ at the Family Affair club night in Shoreditch, London on 24 April 2010), The interview in &quot;The Sun&quot; also made mention of &quot;Shrink&quot;, a song about Ant&#x27;s experiences in the mental healthcare system. Ant had previously discussed both of these songs in his April 2010 interview with Simon Price for online fanzine &quot;The Quietus&quot;. On his second visit to Iain Lee&#x27;s show on Absolute Radio on 4 January 2011, two further new tracks were debuted, &quot;Hard Men, Tough Blokes&quot; and &quot;punkyoungirl&quot; . In an interview for &quot;Bizarre&quot; magazine published that month, Ant named the song co-written with Andy Bell as &quot;Cool Zombie&quot;.

21 January 2013 release date was officially announced by Ant onstage at his September 2012 concert in Chatham by Ant&#x27;s own record label Blueblack Hussar Records. Despite the decidedly DIY nature of the release, the album reached number 25 on the UK Albums Chart, only one place lower than its predecessor had managed when released on the corporate EMI label nearly eighteen years earlier. It had previously been at number 8 in the Midweeks. To promote the album, Ant performed a series of concerts around the British Isles during April and May (billed as a &quot;Spring Tour&quot;) culminating in a gig at The Roundhouse on 11 May. A free concert in Rome took place on 14 June and a second full length 40 plus show US tour got underway on 17 July in San Diego and ran to 21 September in Anaheim. Prior to the tour, Ant and his band appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; to promote the new album, performing a live version of the track &quot;Vince Taylor&quot;.

During early 2014, Ant was at work recording his next album, titled &quot;Bravest of the Brave&quot;. On 19 April, Ant performed his debut album &quot;Dirk Wears White Sox&quot; at the Hammersmith Apollo with a band including former Ants Dave Barbe and Lee Gorman, preceding this with several UK tour dates. He also reissued the &quot;Dirk&quot; album on white vinyl on his Blueblack Hussar label, with a launch party gig at the 100 Club. Both London concerts were filmed by noted film director Leigh Tarrant and later released as the DVD album &quot;Dirk Live At The Apollo&quot;. Ant subsequently performed the full album again with his regular band for four nights at the Islington Assembly Hall in November 2014 and a full UK tour in Spring 2015. 

Jack Bond&#x27;s documentary on Ant, &quot;The Blueblack Hussar&quot;, covering his life and performances from late 2010 to mid 2011, was released on DVD in July 2014 by Sunrise Pictures. Leigh Tarrant&#x27;s film was released by Ant&#x27;s own production company BlueBlack Hussar but has now been out of print since its initial release in late 2014 and remains a highly sought after concert release. This remains Ant&#x27;s last professionally filmed concert to date. Further, Tarrant&#x27;s originally commissioned insider documentary &quot;White Sox&quot; which captures a candid look at Ant during his Spring 2014 UK tour is currently unreleased and awaits distribution as of 2024.

Ant toured the UK in 2016 and North America in early 2017, performing his &quot;Kings of the Wild Frontier&quot; album in its entirety. Sony Records issued a deluxe box set of the album linked to the UK leg of the tour, including a gold vinyl pressing of the album (as previously announced by Ant at the 100 Club gig in 2014). After his January 24, 2017 show in Boston, Ant&#x27;s guitarist and music director, Tom Edwards, suddenly died due to suspected heart failure; he was 41. After cancelling shows in New York and Philadelphia, the tour continued. Later the same year, he toured the UK and announced he would return to North America with another tour, titled Anthems: The Singles in the autumn, and afterwards would be taking the Kings tour to Australia and New Zealand.

Ant announced the &quot;Friend or Foe&quot; tour, which traveled North America and the United Kingdom from September to December 2019. He performed the album in its entirety in an 18-date tour in North America before returning to the United Kingdom for 26 shows. A further North American tour originally planned for April–May 2020 was shifted back to 2021 then 2022 as result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was eventually scrapped due to the glut of rescheduled tours, but a 19 date Antics Tour of the UK did go ahead.

In 2023, Ant was scheduled to perform at the Cruel World Festival in Pasadena, California on May 20. However, shortly before the festival was to take place, Ant cancelled his appearance, due to &quot;unforeseen circumstances&quot;. He played at the festival in 2024 and toured the United States later that year, but a planned United Kingdom leg was postponed until late 2025 after Ant was taken ill days before the schedule started.

==Musical style==
The tone of Ant&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Friend or Foe&quot;, was defined as glitzy glam pop with &quot;tongue-in-cheek tunes, delivered with an excess of flair and good humour&quot;. It was also described as being &quot;one of Ant&#x27;s best records and one of the best new wave albums&quot;.

In a review for &quot;Strip&quot;, the songs were considered to contain a &quot;mixture of driving, danceable rock with humour&quot;.

The music on &quot;Vive Le Rock&quot; has been said to be a &quot;50s-style rock &amp; roll sound&quot;.

The fourth studio album, &quot;Manners and Physique&quot;, was said to be a combination of &quot;contemporary dance tracks&quot; and Ant&#x27;s &quot;old flair for mockery&quot;. Ant himself later said that the album was styled after the bass heavy Minneapolis sound of which André Cymone, in Ant&#x27;s words, was &quot;one of the architects&quot;.

Ant&#x27;s acting career began in 1977 when he appeared in &quot;Jubilee&quot;.

==Personal life==
Ant married Carol Mills in 1975 — when they were both still students at Hornsey College of Art:92 — and they divorced in 1977. He dated Amanda Donohoe between 1977 and 1981, Jamie Lee Curtis in 1983 and Heather Graham in the early 1990s. He featured a song about Vanity of Vanity 6, the female vocal group associated with Prince, on the &quot;Strip&quot; album. In 1997, Ant married Lorraine Gibson, a 25-year-old PR assistant for Vivienne Westwood. The ceremony took place in Dayton, Tennessee. They divided their time between Dayton and London, and on April 10, 1998, the couple had a daughter, Lily Caitlin Goddard. The couple divorced four years later, by 2002.

Ant, who does not own a television, enjoys reading, particularly historical novels. He has tattoos depicting Lord Nelson&#x27;s last prayer before the Battle of Trafalgar, an image of his grandfather and a quotation from Oscar Wilde: &quot;Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.&quot;

===Mental health issues===
Ant has spoken candidly about his mental health issues and experiences with the effects of the illness. In 1975, when he was living with his first wife at her parents&#x27; home in Muswell Hill, he suffered from depression and became dangerously underweight. &quot;I just didn&#x27;t eat,&quot; he has said of this period, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t attempting to slim, I was attempting to kill myself.&quot; He took an overdose of pills and, after having his stomach pumped, was sent to Colney Hatch psychiatric hospital in North London; he was diagnosed as having bipolar disorder and discharged after three months. &quot;I was totally fucked-up in the head. Things went wrong and something snapped. I just became a vegetable for three months. I couldn&#x27;t talk to people. I was very ill and that was part of the reason I left college.&quot;

In 2002 Ant was poised to join the 1980s-focused &quot;Here &amp; Now&quot; tour, but was unable to do so when he was arrested and charged, after throwing a car alternator through a window at the Prince of Wales pub in Camden and then threatening patrons with a starting pistol. Ant&#x27;s court trial was held later that year at the Old Bailey in London. The charges against him, which included criminal damage and threatening members of the public, were reduced to a single count of causing affray, to which he pleaded guilty. He was fined £500 and placed under a 12-month Community Rehabilitation Order for psychiatric care, with a suspended sentence. In June 2003, it was reported that Ant had been arrested again on suspicion of criminal damage, before it was decided that he should be hospitalised for treatment. 

On 18 May 2010, Ant was returned to psychiatric hospital, where he remained until mid-June, subsequently returning home under outpatient supervision. In his 31 December 2010 interview for &quot;The Sun&quot;, Ant discussed the side effects of medication for his bipolar condition: &quot;In the past I&#x27;ve been a robot. It&#x27;s been an out-of-body experience. Bipolar means up and down and that&#x27;s me... Music has always been the best medication. I was on sodium valproate for seven years... I couldn&#x27;t get to sleep and I didn&#x27;t make love for seven years. My hair fell out and I couldn&#x27;t pick up a book as I couldn&#x27;t concentrate. I didn&#x27;t write a song or pick up a guitar in that time – and piled on the weight. I might as well have been dead. I work very closely with my GP and any decisions I make are made with him&quot;. During an interview with BBC Radio 6 Music, he declared that &quot;mental health needs a great deal of attention. It&#x27;s the final taboo and it needs to be faced and dealt with.&quot; Ant is involved in the Black Dog campaign, which promotes better understanding of mental illness.

<doc id="158973" wikidata="Q67762" url="?curid=158973" title="Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler">
<text>Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler (25 June 1884 – 11 January 1979) was a German-born art collector, and one of the most notable French art dealers of the 20th century. He became prominent as an art gallery owner in Paris beginning in 1907 and was among the first champions of Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and the Cubist movement in art.

==Early life==
Kahnweiler was born in 1884 in Mannheim, Baden to a prosperous Jewish family. His family had previously moved from Rockenhausen, a small village in the Palatinate. Kahnweiler grew up in Stuttgart and was trained to study finance and philosophy. His upbringing and education at a German Gymnasium prepared him for his life as an art connoisseur and pragmatic businessman. Early employment in the family business of stock brokerage in Germany and Paris gave way to an interest in art collecting while Kahnweiler was still in his twenties. He opened his first small art gallery (4 by 4 meters) in Paris in 1907 at 28 rue Vignon, at age 23. There was a family precedent for such an enterprise, since his uncle, who ran a famous stock brokerage house in London, was a major art collector of traditional English art works and furniture.

==Art dealer==

Kahnweiler is considered to have been one of the greatest supporters of the Cubist art movement through his activities as an art dealer and spokesman for artists. He was among the first people to recognize the importance and beauty of Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#x27;Avignon&quot; and immediately wanted to buy it along with all of Picasso&#x27;s works. Picasso wrote of Kahnweiler, &quot;What would have become of us if Kahnweiler hadn&#x27;t had a business sense?&quot; Kahnweiler&#x27;s appreciation of Picasso&#x27;s talents was especially gratifying to the artist, since he was largely unknown and destitute at the time when many of his most famous works were created.

In his gallery, Kahnweiler supported many of the great artists of his time who found themselves without adequate recognition and little or no interest among collectors. Initial purchases included works by Kees van Dongen, André Derain, André Masson, Fernand Léger, Georges Braque, Juan Gris, Maurice de Vlaminck and several other artists of the same generation. To use his own word, Kahnweiler wanted to &quot;defend&quot; great artists, but only those who had no dealers and of whose talents he was convinced. Rather than exhibiting appealing works by established artists from the past and present, Kahnweiler championed burgeoning artists who had come from all over the globe to live and work in Montparnasse and Montmartre at the time. Thus Paul Cézanne, although a great artist, was considered too old to be represented, and his work was already represented by the dealer Ambroise Vollard in any case.
Along with such men as Alfred Flechtheim, Paul Cassirer, Daniel Wildenstein, Léonce Rosenberg and Paul Rosenberg, Kahnweiler was one of the influential art connoisseurs of the 20th century. As a businessman, Kahnweiler pioneered many new methods of working with artists and art dealing; these are now established practices in the industry.

In 1907, when there were only half a dozen viable galleries in Paris, he made contracts with artists to buy all of their work in order to free them from financial worries and permit them to concentrate on their creative work. He met with them daily to discuss their work, photographed each work they produced (he felt it imperative to have a record), held exhibitions of their work and promoted their work internationally. Since he considered himself friends with many of them, he co-owned little sailing boats with his artists.

As part of his activities in promoting the work of emerging artists, Kahnweiler sponsored the first exhibition of the work of Georges Braque. He encouraged the practice of publishing &quot;Beaux Livres&quot; (beautiful books), in which a contemporary artist would illustrate a work of a contemporary writer. He expanded his presentations by bringing together artists, writers and poets to produce their works as a joint project in more than 40 books. Picasso, for example, illustrated the works of Max Jacob. As a publisher of art with literary works, he had no equal, and was the first to sponsor publications by Max Jacob, Guillaume Apollinaire, André Masson, Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, and many others. In doing so, he launched many literary careers.

Kahnweiler&#x27;s entrepreneurial abilities were so acute that by the 1950s his art gallery was among the top 100 French companies in terms of export figures.

==Art history==
Although the financial support for artists was an important contribution to art history, he was also a significant figure for his work as an art historian and eyewitness to the emergence of Cubism during the period 1907–1914. When working in Paris, his spare time was devoted to reading and understanding the history of art and aesthetics. He also spent his time visiting the city&#x27;s museums and art galleries. Besides the museums in Paris, he took trips around the European continent to see what was being shown in museums and art galleries outside France. He gave his first interview on Cubism in 1912, and it was actual historical events that led to his career as a historian. There is a view that Kahnweiler&#x27;s sensibility was such that his gallery, and the way he styled and developed it, was as much a Cubist gallery as were the paintings by Picasso and the other Cubist painters. The gallery had a clear aesthetic position, uncompromising integrity, financial stability and creative development. During the years 1907-1914 his gallery was a central cradle for Cubism, not only to display the works, but where one also met the artists.

Concurrently, the primary means for avant-garde painters and sculptors to show their works to a wider audience remained the Salon des Indépendants and the Salon d&#x27;Automne. Kahnweiler forbade his &#x27;gallery Cubists&#x27; from exhibiting at these major Salons, and by so doing, actually removed them from public view. From the viewpoint of the general public, Cubism came to be more associated with the &#x27;Salon Cubists&#x27;, such as Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay, Henri Le Fauconnier, Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia.

==World War I and World War II==

The outbreak of World War I in 1914 not only ruptured the Cubist experiments in art, but also forced Kahnweiler to live in exile in Switzerland; due to his German citizenship, he was considered an alien under French law. Many German nationals living in France had their possessions sequestered by the French state, and as a result, Kahnweiler&#x27;s collection was confiscated in 1914 and sold by the government in a series of auctions at the Hôtel Drouot between 1921 and 1923.

Among these was Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Buffalo Bill,&quot; which Kahnweiler acquired from Picasso in 1912 and was auctioned at Hôtel Drouot in the &quot;Fourth Sale of Sequestered Art,&quot; May 7-8, 1923, and bought in auction at Christie&#x27;s for $12,412,500 on Nov. 17, 2022.

During the years of exile (until 1920), Kahnweiler studied and wrote works such as the &quot;Der Weg zum Kubismus&quot; and &quot;Confessions esthétiques&quot;. Writing becoming a passion he continued over his lifetime, and he authored hundreds of books and major articles. The second period of enforced writing came during a period of internal exile caused by the events of World War II. As a Jew, the Nazis forced him to flee Paris. He remained in France, in hiding. &quot;Under the clouds from the gas chambers,&quot; as he put it in his seminal work on Juan Gris.

==At the end==
Kahnweiler was very prolific as an author, but never produced a full autobiography. There was, however, a series of interviews first aired on French television, then published and translated as a book under the title &quot;Mes galleries et mes peintres&quot; (&quot;My galleries and my painters&quot;). For his 80th birthday, a &quot;Festschrift&quot; was published with contributions by the world&#x27;s leading philosophers, art historians, and artists, all of whom emphasized the vital importance of his unique contribution to art history – an importance still not yet fully appreciated, probably due to the fact that he has been viewed mostly as an art dealer and not as an art historian. This situation has been aggravated because some of his major works on aesthetics were either never translated into English or badly translated. The omission of key elements of a proper understanding of Cubism and focus on small and sensational elements of his complex relationship with Picasso has led to a flawed understanding of the ideas he put forward in these writings.

Although revered by artists for his business and aesthetic sense and respected by art dealers and art historians, the true impact of his life and work has yet to be recognized, despite a 1988 biography by Pierre Assouline. He died in 1979 in Paris, aged 94.

<text>A stockbroker is an individual or company that buys and sells stocks and other investments for a financial market participant in return for a commission, markup, or fee. In most countries they are regulated as a broker or broker-dealer and may need to hold a relevant license and may be a member of a stock exchange. They generally act as a financial advisor and investment manager. In this case they may also be licensed as a financial adviser such as a registered investment adviser (in the United States).

Examples of professional designations held by individuals in this field, which affects the types of investments they are permitted to sell and the services they provide include chartered financial consultants, certified financial planners or chartered financial analysts (in the United States and UK), chartered financial planners (in the UK).

In the United States, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority provides an online tool designed to help understand professional designations.

==History of stock broking==

The first recorded buying and selling of shares occurred in Rome in the 2nd century BC. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, stockbroking did not become a profession until after the Renaissance, when government bonds were traded in Italian city-states such as Genoa and Venice. In 1602, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange (now Euronext Amsterdam) became the first official stock market with trading in shares of the Dutch East India Company, the first company to issue stock. In 1698, the London Stock Exchange opened at the Jonathan&#x27;s Coffee-House. On May 17, 1792, the New York Stock Exchange opened under a platanus occidentalis (buttonwood tree) in New York City, as 24 stockbrokers signed the Buttonwood Agreement, agreeing to trade five securities under that buttonwood tree.

===Ireland===
The recognized benchmark designation for investment professionals in Ireland is the QFA (&quot;qualified financial adviser&quot;) designation, which is awarded to those who pass the Professional Diploma in Financial Advice and agree to comply with the ongoing &quot;continuous professional development&quot; (CPD) requirements. The qualification, and attaching CPD program, meets the &quot;minimum competency requirements&quot; specified by the Financial Regulator, for advising on and selling five categories of retail financial products:

===South Africa===
The Johannesburg Securities Exchange rules require that member firms must be under the control of a &quot;qualified stockbroker&quot;, who is also an executive director of the firm; and branches, likewise managed.

Stockbroking is a regulated profession in the United Kingdom and brokers must achieve a recognised qualification from the Appropriate Qualifications list of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). 

The Chartered Institute for Securities &amp; Investment (CISI), established in 1992, is the largest UK professional body for investment professionals. It evolved from the London Stock Exchange, has around 45,000 members in over 100 countries and delivers more than 40,000 exams each year. 

CFA UK also offers various FCA Appropriate Qualifications. It represents the interests of around 12,000 investment professionals and is part of the worldwide network of members of the CFA Institute.

===United States===

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a self-regulatory organization, regulates investment professionals in the United States. Exams that individuals may take for accreditation include the Series 7 exam, the Uniform Securities Agent State Law Exam (Series 63), the Uniform Combined State Law Exam (Series 66), and the Uniform Investment Adviser Law Exam (Series 65).

Individuals holding some of those licenses, such as the Series 6 exam, cannot be called stockbrokers since they are prohibited from selling stocks. Selling variable products, such as a variable annuity contract or variable universal life insurance policy, typically requires the broker to also have one or another state insurance department licenses.

Individuals and firms are regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and laws related to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, including laws related to fiduciary.

<doc id="158976" wikidata="Q7858681" url="?curid=158976" title="Two-Way Stretch">
<text>Two-Way Stretch, also known as Nothing Barred, is a 1960 British comedy film directed by Robert Day and starring Peter Sellers, Wilfrid Hyde-White, Lionel Jeffries and Bernard Cribbins. The screenplay is by Vivian Cox, John Warren and Len Heath. A group of prisoners plan to break out of jail, commit a robbery, and then break back into their jail again, thus giving them the perfect alibi – that they were behind bars when the robbery occurred. However, their plans are disrupted by the arrival of a strict new Chief Prison Officer.

==Plot==
Three prisoners nearing the end of their jail sentences, &quot;Dodger&quot; Lane, &quot;Jelly&quot; Knight and &quot;Lennie the Dip&quot;, are visited by a vicar seeking to find employment for them. He is actually conman &quot;Soapy&quot; Stevens, who proposes a big diamond robbery. They will also all have alibis, because they will break out of prison, commit the robbery and then break back in. With the assistance of Dodger&#x27;s girlfriend Ethel and Lennie&#x27;s mother the trio smuggle themselves out in a fake prison van driven by Soapy. The operation is almost foiled by the new Chief Prison Officer, disciplinarian &quot;Sour&quot; Crout.The trio return to the prison by hiding inside a garbage truck they know is scheduled to make an early morning pickup at the prison (a load of garbage is unexpectedly dumped on them). The trio hide the diamonds in the Governor&#x27;s office until they are released and can take them away. All goes well until the sack of diamonds is lost on a train. Stevens is recognized and arrested but not before Crout throttles an actual Vicar and starts a near riot. The others get away, still trying to steal the diamonds again. They are seen in disguise at a ceremony where the Sultan will literally receive his weight in jewels.

==Production==

The prison scenes were filmed at the South Cavalry Barracks at Aldershot, and the security van robbery at Pirbright Arch in the village of Brookwood in Surrey.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Kine Weekly&quot; called the film a &quot;money maker&quot; at the British box office in 1960.

&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;Jokes and situations borrowed from many a Service farce and laboured parodies of prisoner-of-war escape films are churned out by a familiar cast in a setting reminiscent of &quot;Convict 99&quot;. Wilfrid Hyde White easily gives comic point to every unctuous line, but Peter Sellers disappoints after his performance in &quot;I&#x27;m All Right Jack&quot;, as if neither he nor anyone else had worked out what sort of character he should give his convict. All in all, though, the pace and simple, rough humour of the story should guarantee the film a public.&quot;

In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bosley Crowther gave it a positive review, writing, &quot;the script by John Warren and Len Heath follows a straight line and is clever and full of good Cockney wit. Robert Day&#x27;s direction is lively, in the vein of civilized farce, and the performances are delicious, right down the line,&quot; concluding, &quot;Mr. Sellers is still on the rise.&quot;

Leslie Halliwell wrote: &quot;Amusing comedy with good performances and situations, unofficially borrowed in part from &quot;Convict 99.&quot;&quot;

&quot;The Radio Times Guide to Films&quot; gave the film 4/5 stars, writing: &quot;Fans of Peter Sellers rate this British venture, made before he started to believe his own publicity, as one of the best things he did. It&#x27;s a prison comedy with a snarling stand-off between cocky convict Sellers, his cellmates Bernard Cribbins and David Lodge, and paranoid warden Lionel Jeffries. The plot – about a group of prisoners trying to break back into jail after a heist is wonderfully developed and there are delightful cameos along the way.&quot;

<text>Brandenburg an der Havel (; ) is a town in Brandenburg, Germany, which served as the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg until it was replaced by Berlin in 1417.

With a population of 72,040 (as of 2020), it is located on the banks of the River Havel. The town of Brandenburg provided the name for the medieval Bishopric of Brandenburg, the Margraviate of Brandenburg and the current state of Brandenburg. Today, it is a small town compared to nearby Berlin but was the original nucleus of the former realms of Brandenburg and Prussia.

==History==
===Middle Ages===
The name of the city is a combination of two words &quot;braniti&quot; – to protect/defend and &quot;bor&quot; – forest/wood. 
Brenna, which had been a fort of the West Slavic tribe Stodoranie, was conquered in 929 after the Battle of Lenzen by the German King Henry the Fowler of Saxony. It was at this time first mentioned in documents as &quot;Brennaburg&quot;. By the death of King Henry all the tribes between the Middle Elbe and Middle Oder paid tribute to the German King. At the Magdeburg Assembly of Princes in 948 the Bishoprics of Brandenburg and Havelburg were established. The Holy Roman Emperor Otto I took control of these new sees. In Slavic revolt of 983 there was a major Slav uprising involving numerous tribes and until the middle of the 12th century the area east of the Elbe remained under their control. During this period the area was ruled by Slavic chiefs of the Hevelli tribe. The last of them, Pribislav, died in 1150.

Following Pribislav&#x27;s death his widow Petrissa enabled Albert I of Brandenburg to take over Brandenburg fort by agreement and provide it with a joint German-Slav garrison. Albert now styled himself Margrave of Brandenburg. By 1160 systematic settlement of the Elbe-Havel-Spree basin by nobility, burghers, and peasants from the Schwabengau area (Harz), the Netherlands, the Rhineland, and Westphalia was in progress. In 1165 the foundation stone for a cathedral was laid on the cathedral island of Brandenburg. It was consecrated five years later in the presence of Albert the Bear and his sons. The town was restricted to the western bank of the Havel until 1196, when it was extended to the eastern side. The parts on either side of the river were regarded as three towns (Old Town, New Town and Brandenburg cathedral district) for centuries.

In 1314–1315 the Old and New Towns joined the Hanseatic League. In the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) the towns suffered plundering and destruction; this caused Potsdam to become the new capital, and the court left the town of Brandenburg. In 1715, Old Town and New Town were merged to form a single town. In 1928, the Brandenburg cathedral district was added.

===Modern history===

In the late 19th century Brandenburg an der Havel became a very important industrial center in the German Empire. Steel industries settled there, and several bicycle brands such as &quot;Brennabor&quot;, &quot;Corona&quot; and &quot;Excelsior&quot; were manufactured in the city. A toy industry was also established. A giant industrial complex, the Deutsche Reichsbahn (German Imperial Railways) was located in Brandenburg-Kirchmöser between the two world wars and under the former GDR.

In 1933/34, a concentration camp, one of the first in Nazi Germany, was located on &quot;Neuendorfer Straße&quot; in Brandenburg Old Town. After closing this inner city concentration camp, the Nazis used the Brandenburg-Görden Prison, located in the suburb of Görden. Later the old gaol became the Brandenburg Euthanasia Centre where the Nazis murdered people with mental diseases, including children. This programme later came to be known as &quot;Action T4&quot; because of the Berlin address, Tiergartenstraße 4, the headquarters of this planned and well-organized forced euthanasia organisation. Brandenburg an der Havel was one of the first locations in Nazi Germany where the Nazis experimented with murdering their victims by gas. The lessons here were later applied for mass murders in Auschwitz and other extermination camps. 

In 1934, the Arado Aircraft Company (Arado Flugzeugwerke), which originated in Warnemünde, built a satellite factory in Brandenburg that began producing planes in 1935. The factory was expanded over the next five years, and produced trainers and other aircraft for the Luftwaffe during World War II. The existence of this factory was one of the reasons Brandenburg was heavily bombed in later stages of the war; by 1945, 70% of the city was destroyed.

Friedrich Fromm, a German officer involved in the 20 July plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, was executed here in March 1945 for his part in the plot, even though Fromm betrayed those conspirators he knew and ordered their execution.

On 25 July 1952 Plaue and Kirchmöser were incorporated in the city of Brandenburg an der Havel.

After German reunification the city&#x27;s population declined from around 100,000 in 1989 to roughly 75,000 in 2005 through emigration. The migration was mainly by young people.

== Demography ==

== Transport ==

The city is located on the navigable River Havel, a European Waterway, and vessels travelling through the city have a choice of two routes. The original route used the Brandenburg City Canal, a route through the city centre that descends through the &quot;Stadtschleuse Brandenburg&quot;, but this route is constrained in size and now limited to leisure craft. Commercial traffic instead uses the Silo Canal that passes through the eastern and northern fringes of the city.

The city is located at the junction of Federal Highways 1 and 102 and the A2 autobahn is nearby. The Berlin and Magdeburg railway also runs through Brandenburg an der Havel.

The centrepiece of the city&#x27;s urban public transport system is the Brandenburg an der Havel tramway network.

== Sights ==
The &quot;Dominsel&quot; (Cathedral Island) is the historic heart of the town. Here stands its oldest edifice: the St. Peter and Paul Cathedral. Although construction began in the Romanesque style in 1165, it was completed as a Gothic cathedral during the 14th century. While the exterior is rather austere, the cathedral surprises the visitor with its sumptuous interior, especially the painted vault of the &quot;Bunte Kapelle&quot; (Coloured Chapel) and the Wagner organ (1725), one of the most famous Baroque organs in Germany.

The &quot;Katharinenkirche&quot; (St. Catherine&#x27;s Church) built in 1401 in the Neustadt is an impressive example of northern German brick Gothic architecture. The &quot;Gotthardtkirche&quot; (St. Gotthardt&#x27;s Church) was built of the same material just a few years later.

Another interesting building is the &quot;Altstädtisches Rathaus&quot; (Old Town Hall), a late Gothic brick building with stepped gables and an ornate portal. In front of it stands a 5.35m high statue of the knight Roland. Made of sandstone, the statue was erected in 1474 as a symbol of the town&#x27;s independence.

There is also a part of Brandenburg&#x27;s medieval city wall, with four preserved watchtowers: &quot;Steintorturm&quot; and &quot;Mühlentorturm&quot; (in the New Town), and &quot;Rathenower Torturm&quot; and &quot;Plauer Torturm&quot; (in the Old Town).

The &quot;Brandenburg Industrial Museum&quot; is an Anchor Point of ERIH, The European Route of Industrial Heritage. Brandenburg has its own theatre (Brandenburger Theater), a professional symphony orchestra (Brandenburger Symphoniker) and a wide range of local history and archaeology museums.

<text>You&#x27;ve Got Mail is a 1998 American romantic comedy film directed by Nora Ephron, and starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan alongside Parker Posey, Jean Stapleton, Dave Chappelle, Steve Zahn, and Greg Kinnear. Inspired by the 1937 Hungarian play &quot;Parfumerie&quot; by Miklós László (which had earlier been adapted in 1940 as &quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot; and in 1949 as &quot;In the Good Old Summertime&quot;), the screenplay was co-written by Nora and Delia Ephron. It tells the story of two people in an online romance who are unaware they are also business rivals. It marked the third pairing of Hanks and Ryan, who previously appeared together in &quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot; (1990) and &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; (1993), the latter directed by Ephron. The film takes its name from the greeting AOL users receive when they get a new email.

==Plot==
On Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side, Kathleen Kelly runs The Shop Around the Corner, an independent children&#x27;s bookstore she inherited from her mother. She is in a relationship with Frank Navasky, a left-leaning columnist for &quot;The New York Observer&quot;. While Frank is devoted to his typewriter, Kathleen prefers her laptop and using her AOL email account, under the screen name &quot;Shopgirl&quot;, to exchange messages with &quot;NY152&quot;, whom she first met in a chatroom. As they have agreed not to share specifics about their personal lives, she knows nothing about him other than the name of his dog, Brinkley.

&quot;NY152&quot; is the screen name of Joe Fox, who is dating abrasive publisher Patricia Eden, and whose family runs Fox Books, a major chain of bookstores. He is overseeing the opening of a new storefront with help from his best friend, branch manager Kevin, just a few blocks from The Shop Around the Corner. Kathleen&#x27;s three shop assistants—George, Aunt Birdie, and Christina—worry the new Fox Books will hurt business, but Kathleen dismisses their concerns.

Following an outing with his 11-year-old aunt Annabel and 4-year-old half-brother Matthew, Joe stops at Kathleen&#x27;s store for a storytime event. Joe and Kathleen meet and have a pleasant conversation, but when she expresses disdain for the new Fox Books store, he withholds his last name and leaves abruptly with the children. Later that week, Kathleen and Joe meet again at a book publishing party, and she learns his true identity. She accuses him of deception and spying, while he belittles her store, earning each other&#x27;s hostility.

&quot;Shopgirl&quot; writes to &quot;NY152&quot; asking for business advice, and he urges her to fight back. Frank pens a column in support of The Shop Around the Corner that draws widespread attention, leading to talk show appearances, news coverage, and picketing outside Fox Books. Joe is aggravated by the negative publicity, but his father assures him everything will blow over once the new store opens.

&quot;Shopgirl&quot; and &quot;NY152&quot; decide to meet at a café. Joe, peeking through the window, is dismayed to find that his pen pal is actually his professional nemesis. He initially walks away, then changes his mind and joins her at the table without revealing his online identity. They clash once again, and Kathleen cruelly insults him, causing Joe to leave in distress. Later that night, he receives an email from &quot;Shopgirl&quot;, sharing that she finally stood up to an unpleasant person but now feels terrible for doing so. After several attempts to make up a story and realizing that he couldn&#x27;t lie to her, &quot;NY152&quot; apologizes for &quot;what happened&quot;, and assures Kathleen that anything she said was likely deserved.

Despite efforts to save The Shop Around the Corner, business steadily declines, while the newly opened Fox Books location thrives. Kathleen makes the difficult decision to close. Later, she and Frank amicably end their relationship. Kathleen takes a break to figure out her next move, ultimately taking inspiration from her correspondence with &quot;NY152&quot; to write children&#x27;s books. Meanwhile, after breaking up with Patricia, Joe realizes his own feelings for Kathleen and slowly builds a face-to-face relationship with her, still keeping his online identity a secret.

Eventually, &quot;NY152&quot; arranges another meeting with &quot;Shopgirl&quot;. Right before she is to meet her online friend, Joe confesses his feelings, imploring her to forgive him for their past animosity. Kathleen becomes emotional, hinting that she feels the same way but cannot bring herself to forego her feelings for &quot;NY152&quot;. Upon arriving at the meeting place, she hears a man&#x27;s voice calling for Brinkley and sees that &quot;NY152&quot; is, in fact, Joe Fox. Kathleen cries tears of joy and reveals that she hoped it would be him, and they share a kiss.

==Production==
===Influences===
&quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot; is based on the 1937 Hungarian play &quot;Parfumerie&quot; by Miklós László and its adaptations. &quot;Parfumerie&quot; was later remade as &quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot;, a 1940 film by Ernst Lubitsch, which in 1949 was adapted as a musical film, &quot;In the Good Old Summertime&quot; by Robert Z. Leonard starring Judy Garland and Van Johnson and, finally, in 1963 as a Broadway musical with &quot;She Loves Me&quot; by Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick (composer and lyricist, respectively, of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;). &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot; updates that concept with the use of email, and the lead character&#x27;s workplace is named &quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot; as a nod to the 1940 film. Influences from Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; can also be seen in the relationship between Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly—a reference pointed out by these characters actually discussing Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet in the film. The joke when Tom Hanks explains that the little girl is really his aunt is taken from Israel Zangwill&#x27;s story &quot;A New Matrimonial Relation&quot; in &quot;The Bachelors&#x27; Club&quot; (1891).

===Filming===
Principal photography took place primarily on New York City&#x27;s Upper West Side. Principal photography began on February 25, 1998, and completed on June 8, 1998.

Delia Ephron, recalling the film&#x27;s bookstore setting, said, &quot;Once we decided that she would be an independent bookstore owner, the reason we made it a children&#x27;s bookstore is, I think, we always tried to make movies as personal as we could. To find the thing in it that was personal. And we grew up loving children&#x27;s books more than anything.&quot; Nora Ephron similarly remarked in the film&#x27;s audio commentary, &quot;This was something that was very important to us—that there be first editions of old children&#x27;s books. It&#x27;s part of what make [sic] this a serious bookstore. We wanted to sell the idea that this was a place that really cared about the history of children&#x27;s literature.&quot; Additionally, Ephron had Ryan and Burns rehearse and work at Books of Wonder, an independent New York City children&#x27;s bookstore, for a week prior to filming in order to get them into character. The filming location used as the bookstore was at 106 West 69th Street, at that time Maya Shaper&#x27;s Cheese and Antique Shop.

Michael Palin was initially cast as a reclusive novelist based on Thomas Pynchon, but his scenes were cut from the film.

=== Website ===
The film&#x27;s original website remained live until at least May 10, 2018. The website has proven to be fodder for criticism of web design from the 1990s.

==Soundtrack==

A soundtrack was released on December 1, 1998, featuring a mixture of classics from the 1950s and 1970s, particularly the work of Harry Nilsson, as well as new original recordings and covers. The score to the film was written by English composer George Fenton.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot; grossed $115.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $135 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $250.8 million. The film debuted at number one at the North American box office above &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;, earning $18.4 million on its opening weekend.

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot; holds an approval rating of 70% based on 89 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Great chemistry between the leads made this a warm and charming delight.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 58 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of A− on a scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three-out-of-four stars and lauded the &quot;immensely lovable&quot; main characters. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; also praised the film, writing of the leads, &quot;Ms. Ryan plays her role blithely and credibly this time, with an air of freshness, a minimum of cute fidgeting and a lot of fond chemistry with Mr. Hanks. And he continues to amaze. Once again, he fully inhabits a new role without any obvious actorly behavior, to the point where comparisons to James Stewart ... really cannot be avoided.&quot; Lael Loewenstein of &quot;Variety&quot; similarly called it a &quot;winning romantic comedy&quot; and praised the chemistry between Hanks and Ryan, writing, &quot;they show why they are two of Hollywood&#x27;s most bankable and, in many ways, most traditional stars.&quot; and Gene Shalit on the &quot;Today Show&quot; called the film &quot;exciting and enchanting&quot;.

Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; disliked the film, and wrote: &quot;Takes almost two self-infatuated, smarmy, condescending, cringe-inducingly sentimental hours to reach its pre-ordained conclusion&quot; and called the film &quot;almost unwatchably saccharine, representing pretty much everything wrong with today&#x27;s big-budget, high-concept Hollywood filmmaking.&quot; Michael O&#x27;Sullivan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; criticized the film&#x27;s use of product placement and its overly &quot;adorable&quot; characters, writing, &quot;For some reason, this film made me feel like a Christmas goose being fattened for slaughter. Its force-fed diet of whimsy cloyed long before the eagerly anticipated romantic payoff arrived to put me out of my misery.&quot; Maitland McDonagh also criticized the incongruous product placement &quot;In a film about the ruthless corporate destruction of small businesses, it&#x27;s hard not to flinch at the prominent placement accorded IBM, Starbucks, and AOL logos.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; later included &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot; in their list of &quot;Most Egregious Product Placements in Movie &amp; TV History&quot; for the film&#x27;s frequent use of AOL trademarks (AOL would later merge with film distributor Warner Bros&#x27; parent company Time Warner to form AOL Time Warner in 2000).
