<text>River Jude Phoenix (; August 23, 1970 – October 31, 1993) was an American actor. Phoenix was known as a teen actor before taking on leading roles in critically acclaimed films. He received numerous accolades, including the Volpi Cup and the Independent Spirit Award as well as nominations for an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award.

Phoenix grew up in an family, as the older brother of Rain Phoenix, Joaquin Phoenix, Liberty Phoenix and Summer Phoenix. He began his acting career at age 10 in television commercials. His early film roles include &quot;Explorers&quot; (1985), &quot;Stand by Me&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; (1986). Phoenix made a transition into more adult-oriented roles earning a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the Sidney Lumet drama &quot;Running on Empty&quot; (1988). He earned the Volpi Cup for Best Actor and the Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead for his performance as Michael Waters, a gay hustler in search of his estranged mother in the Gus Van Sant drama &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot; (1991).

He died at age 23 from combined drug intoxication in West Hollywood in the early hours of Halloween, 1993, having overdosed on cocaine and heroin (a mixture commonly known as speedball) at The Viper Room.

==Early life==
Phoenix was born on August 23, 1970, in Madras, Oregon, the first child of Arlyn Dunetz and John Lee Bottom. He had four younger siblings, Rain (born 1972), Joaquin (born 1974), Liberty (born 1976) and Summer (born 1978), as well as a paternal half-sister, Jodean (born 1964). Phoenix&#x27;s parents named him after the &quot;river of life&quot; from the Hermann Hesse novel &quot;Siddhartha&quot;, and he received his middle name from the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Hey Jude&quot;. In an interview with &quot;People&quot;, Phoenix described his parents as &quot;hippieish&quot;.

His mother, Arlyn, was born in New York to Jewish parents whose families had emigrated from Russia and Hungary.

His father, John Lee Bottom, was a lapsed Catholic from Fontana, California, of English, German and French ancestry. In 1968, Phoenix&#x27;s mother travelled across the United States.
While hitchhiking in California she met John Lee Bottom.
They married on September 13, 1969, less than a year after meeting.

Phoenix&#x27;s family moved cross country when he was very young. Phoenix has stated that they lived in a &quot;desperate situation.&quot; Phoenix often played guitar while he and his sister sang on street corners for money and food to support their ever-growing family. Phoenix never attended formal school. Screenwriter Naomi Foner later commented, &quot;He was totally, totally without education. I mean, he could read and write, and he had an appetite for it, but he had no deep roots into any kind of sense of history or literature.&quot; Filmmaker George Sluizer claimed Phoenix was dyslexic.

=== Children of God cult ===

In 1973, the family joined the religious organization known as the Children of God. His family settled in Caracas, Venezuela, where the Children of God had stationed them to work as missionaries and fruit gatherers.

According to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Phoenix was raped at the age of four. In an interview with &quot;Details&quot; magazine in November 1991, Phoenix stated he lost his virginity at age four to other children while in the Children of God, but he had &quot;blocked it out.&quot; In 2019, his brother Joaquin would claim that River was joking, saying, &quot;It was literally a joke, because he was so tired of being asked ridiculous questions by the press.&quot; Although Phoenix rarely talked about the cult, he was quoted in an article published in &quot;Esquire&quot; in 1994 as having said, &quot;They&#x27;re disgusting, they&#x27;re ruining people&#x27;s lives.&quot; Arlyn and John eventually grew disillusioned with the &quot;Church&quot; and left the cult in 1977.

In the aforementioned interview with &quot;Details&quot; magazine, Phoenix said he was &quot;completely celibate&quot; between the ages of 10 and 14.

==Acting career==
===1980–1985: Early work and acting background ===

Back in the United States, Arlyn began working as a secretary for an NBC broadcaster and John as an exteriors architect. Talent agent Iris Burton spotted River, Joaquin, and their sisters Summer and Rain singing for spare change in Westwood, Los Angeles, and was so charmed by the family that she soon represented the four siblings.

Phoenix started doing commercials for Mitsubishi, Ocean Spray and Saks Fifth Avenue, and soon afterward he and the other children were signed by Paramount Pictures casting director Penny Marshall. River and Rain were assigned immediately to a show called &quot;Real Kids&quot; as audience warm-up performers. In 1980, Phoenix began to fully pursue his career as an actor, making his first appearance on a TV show called &quot;Fantasy&quot; singing with his sister Rain. In 1982, Phoenix was cast in the short-lived CBS television series &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot;, in which he starred as youngest brother Guthrie McFadden. Phoenix arrived at the auditions with his guitar and promptly burst into a convincing Elvis Presley impersonation, charming the show producer. By this age, Phoenix was also an accomplished tap dancer.

Almost a year after &quot;Seven Brides&quot; ended in 1983, Phoenix found a new role in the 1984 television movie &quot;Celebrity&quot;, in which he played the part of young Jeffie Crawford. Although only onscreen for about ten minutes, his character was central. Less than a month after &quot;Celebrity&quot; came the &quot;ABC Afterschool Special&quot;: &quot;&quot;. Phoenix starred as a young boy who discovers he has dyslexia. Joaquin starred in a small role alongside his brother. In September, the pilot episode of short-lived TV series &quot;It&#x27;s Your Move&quot; aired. Phoenix was cast as Brian and only had one line of dialogue. He also starred as Robert Kennedy&#x27;s son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in the TV movie &quot;Robert Kennedy and His Times&quot;. After his role in &quot;Dyslexia&quot; was critically acclaimed, Phoenix was almost immediately cast in a major role in made-for-TV movie &quot;&quot;. He starred as Philip Brogan alongside Molly Ringwald and Heather O&#x27;Rourke. Halfway through the filming of &quot;Surviving&quot;, Iris Burton contacted him about a possible role in the film &quot;Explorers&quot;.

In October 1984, Phoenix secured the role of geeky boy-scientist Wolfgang Müller in Joe Dante&#x27;s big-budget science-fiction film &quot;Explorers&quot; alongside Ethan Hawke, and production began soon after. Released in the summer of 1985, this was Phoenix&#x27;s first major motion picture role. In October 1986, Phoenix co-starred alongside Tuesday Weld and Geraldine Fitzgerald in the acclaimed CBS television movie &quot;Circle of Violence: A Family Drama&quot;, which told a story of domestic elder abuse. This was Phoenix&#x27;s last television role before achieving film stardom.

===1986–1993: Breakthrough and final projects===
Phoenix had a significant role in Rob Reiner&#x27;s popular coming-of-age film &quot;Stand by Me&quot; (1986), which made him a household name at 16. Filming started on June 17, 1985, and ended in late August 1985, making Phoenix 14 for most (if not all) of the movie. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; opined that Phoenix gave the film its &quot;centre of gravity&quot;. Phoenix commented: &quot;The truth is, I identified so much with the role of Chris Chambers that if I hadn&#x27;t had my family to go back to after the shoot, I&#x27;d have probably had to see a psychiatrist.&quot; Later that year, Phoenix completed Peter Weir&#x27;s &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; (1986), playing the son of Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren&#x27;s characters. &quot;He was obviously going to be a movie star,&quot; observed Weir. &quot;It&#x27;s something apart from acting ability. Laurence Olivier never had what River had.&quot; During the five-month shoot in Belize, Phoenix began a romance with co-star Martha Plimpton, a relationship which continued in some form for many years. Phoenix was surprised by the poor reception for the film, feeling more secure about his work in it than he had in &quot;Stand by Me&quot;.

Phoenix was next cast as the lead in the teen comedy-drama &quot;A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon&quot; (1988), but was disappointed with his performance: &quot;It didn&#x27;t turn out the way I thought it would, and I put the blame on myself. I wanted to do a comedy, and it was definitely a stretch, but I&#x27;m not sure I was even the right person for the role.&quot; Also in 1988, Phoenix starred in &quot;Little Nikita&quot; alongside Sidney Poitier. During this time, the Phoenix family continued to move on a regular basis, relocating over forty times by the time Phoenix was 18. Phoenix purchased his family a ranch in Micanopy, Florida, near Gainesville, in 1987, in addition to a spread in Costa Rica.

His sixth feature film was Sidney Lumet&#x27;s &quot;Running on Empty&quot; (1988), for which the 18-year-old Phoenix received National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor and nominations for a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award, becoming the sixth-youngest Academy Award nominee in the category. Phoenix jumped to his feet during the ceremony when Kevin Kline beat him to the Oscar. &quot;I had to stop River from running to hug Kevin,&quot; recalled his mother Arlyn. &quot;It never crossed his mind that he hadn&#x27;t won&quot;. In 1989, he portrayed a young Indiana Jones in the prologue of the box-office hit &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, the third installment of the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; franchise, directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Harrison Ford.

Phoenix was photographed by Bruce Weber for &quot;Vogue&quot; and was spokesperson for a campaign for Gap in 1990. He starred with Kevin Kline, Tracey Ullman, Joan Plowright and Keanu Reeves in the 1990 comedy film &quot;I Love You to Death&quot;. Phoenix had met Reeves while Reeves was filming the 1989 film &quot;Parenthood&quot; with Phoenix&#x27;s brother, Joaquin, and girlfriend, Martha Plimpton; however, Phoenix had reportedly auditioned for Bill in Reeves&#x27; then-current film &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot; before the role was taken by Alex Winter.

He co-starred with Lili Taylor in the acclaimed independent picture &quot;Dogfight&quot; (1991), directed by Nancy Savoca. In the romantic coming-of-age drama set in San Francisco, Phoenix portrayed a young U.S. Marine on the night before he is shipped off to Vietnam in November 1963. Taylor remarked that Phoenix suffered because he could not distance himself from his character: &quot;He also hadn&#x27;t gotten into any [drugs]—he was just drinking then, too. It was different... That was actually a hard part for him, because it was so radically different from who he was. He was such a hippie, and here he was playing this marine. It actually caused him a lot of discomfort. I don&#x27;t think he enjoyed that, actually, getting into that psyche.&quot;

Phoenix reunited with Keanu Reeves to co-star in Gus Van Sant&#x27;s 1991 avant-garde film &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot;. In his review for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, David Ansen praised Phoenix&#x27;s performance as gay hustler Michael Waters: &quot;The campfire scene in which Mike awkwardly declares his unrequited love for Scott is a marvel of delicacy. In this, and every scene, Phoenix immerses himself so deeply inside his character you almost forget you&#x27;ve seen him before: it&#x27;s a stunningly sensitive performance, poignant and comic at once&quot;. He won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 1991 Venice Film Festival. In addition, the 21-year-old Phoenix received Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead and National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actor, becoming the second-youngest winner of the former. His critically acclaimed performance helped bring queer cinema to a mainstream audience. The film and its success solidified his image as an actor with edgy, leading man potential. In that period, Phoenix was beginning to use marijuana, cocaine and heroin with some friends.

Around this time, Phoenix was approached by George Lucas to reprise his role of a younger Indiana Jones for &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;, a spin-off television series produced by the ABC that served as a prequel to the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films. However, Phoenix declined to reprise the role due to having started his career in different sitcoms and struggled hard to get out from the television medium, not being willing to return to it. The role of a younger Indy was eventually filled by Corey Carrier and Sean Patrick Flannery, respectively.

He teamed up with Robert Redford and again with Sidney Poitier for the conspiracy/espionage thriller &quot;Sneakers&quot; (1992). A month later, he began production on Sam Shepard&#x27;s art-house ghost western &quot;Silent Tongue&quot; (which was released in 1994). He was beaten out for the role of Paul by Brad Pitt in &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;. Phoenix then starred in Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s country music-themed film, &quot;The Thing Called Love&quot; (1993), the last completed picture before his death. He began a relationship with co-star Samantha Mathis on the set.

===Unreleased and unfilmed projects===
Phoenix&#x27;s sudden death prevented him from playing various roles:
*Phoenix was due to begin work on Neil Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; (1994) two weeks after his death. He was to play the part of Daniel Molloy, the interviewer, which then went to Christian Slater, who donated his entire $250,000 salary to two of Phoenix&#x27;s favorite charitable organizations: Earth Save and Earth Trust. The film has a dedication to Phoenix after the end credits.
*&quot;The Guardian&quot; suggested in 2003 &quot;it was likely that Phoenix would have followed &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; by appearing as Susan Sarandon&#x27;s son in &quot;Safe Passage&quot; (1994), a role that went to Sean Astin. 
* Phoenix had signed onto the lead role in &quot;Broken Dreams&quot;, a screenplay written by John Boorman and Neil Jordan (to be directed by Boorman), and co-starring Winona Ryder. The film was put on hold due to Phoenix&#x27;s death. In June 2012, it was announced that Caleb Landry Jones had been cast in the role.
* Gus Van Sant had persuaded Phoenix to agree to play the role of Cleve Jones in &quot;Milk&quot; when he was originally planning on making the movie in the early 1990s. The role was eventually played by Emile Hirsch in 2008.
* When Gus Van Sant was asked in &quot;Interview&quot; magazine, &quot;You were going to do a movie with River about Andy Warhol, right?&quot;, he said, &quot;Yeah. River kind of looked like Andy in his younger days. But that project never really went forward.&quot;
*In 1988, Phoenix was reportedly carrying around a copy of the memoir &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot; (1978). He had heard a movie version was in the works and wanted to play the autobiographical role of Jim Carroll. The film was sent into hiatus on numerous occasions with Phoenix being cited as the main contender for the role each time. &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot; (1995) was made with 19-year-old Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead.
*He had expressed interest in playing the 19th-century poet Arthur Rimbaud in &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; (1995) by Polish director Agnieszka Holland. Phoenix died before the movie was cast, with the role eventually going to Leonardo DiCaprio.
*Phoenix was James Cameron&#x27;s original choice to play Jack Dawson in &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), with the role ultimately going to Leonardo DiCaprio.
*Comic book writer Lee Marrs claimed in a 2023 interview with the IndyCast podcast that Lucasfilm Ltd. considered for a while to make a continuation to the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film series starring Phoenix as a younger Indy, being this the primary reason for which Dark Horse Comics hoped to keep running their &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; comic book line. Phoenix&#x27;s death in 1993 put an end to this option and Dark Horse cancelled their line a few years later, stopping the development of any &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films until &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; (2008). &quot;Last Crusade&quot; actor Richard Young previously claimed in 2018 that there were talks about him and Phoenix doing a prequel movie together about Phoenix&#x27;s younger Indy and Young&#x27;s Fedora.

==Music==
Although Phoenix&#x27;s movie career was generating most of the income for his family, it has been stated by close friends and relatives that his true passion was music. Phoenix was a singer, songwriter and accomplished guitarist. He had begun teaching himself guitar at age five and had stated in an interview for &quot;E!&quot; in 1988 that his family&#x27;s move to Los Angeles when he was nine was so that he and his sister &quot;could become recording artists. I fell into commercials for financial reasons and acting became an attractive concept&quot;. Before securing an acting agent, Phoenix and his siblings tried to forge a career in music by playing cover versions on the streets of the Westwood district of LA, often being moved along by police because gathering crowds would obstruct the sidewalk. From the first fruits of his film success, Phoenix saved $650 to obtain his prized possession: a guitar with which he wrote what he described as &quot;progressive, ethereal folk-rock&quot;.

While working on &quot;A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon&quot; in 1986, Phoenix had written and recorded a song, &quot;Heart to Get&quot;, specifically for the end credits of the movie. 20th Century Fox cut it from the completed film, but director William Richert put it back into place for his director&#x27;s cut some years later. It was during filming that Phoenix met Chris Blackwell of Island Records; this meeting would later secure Phoenix a two-year development deal with the label. Phoenix disliked the idea of being a solo artist and relished collaboration; therefore he focused on putting together a band. Aleka&#x27;s Attic were formed in 1987 and the lineup included his sister Rain.

Phoenix was committed to gaining credibility by his own merit and maintained that the band would not use his name when securing performances that were not benefits for charitable organizations. Phoenix&#x27;s first release was &quot;Across the Way&quot;, co-written with bandmate Josh McKay, which was released in 1989 on a benefit album for PETA titled &quot;Tame Yourself&quot;. In 1991, Phoenix wrote and recorded a spoken word piece called &quot;Curi Curi&quot; for Milton Nascimento&#x27;s album &quot;TXAI&quot;. Also in 1991, the Aleka&#x27;s Attic track &quot;Too Many Colors&quot; was used in the film &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot;, which included Phoenix in a starring role.

Aleka&#x27;s Attic disbanded in 1992, but Phoenix continued writing and performing. While working on the film &quot;The Thing Called Love&quot; in 1993, Phoenix wrote and recorded the song &quot;Lone Star State of Mine&quot;, which he performs in the movie. The song was not included on the film&#x27;s soundtrack album. In 1996, the Aleka&#x27;s Attic track &quot;Note to a Friend&quot; was released on the 1996 benefit album &quot;In Defense of Animals; Volume II&quot; and featured Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers on bass. Phoenix had collaborated with friend John Frusciante after his first departure from Red Hot Chili Peppers and the songs &quot;Height Down&quot; and &quot;Well I&#x27;ve Been&quot; were released on Frusciante&#x27;s second solo album &quot;Smile from the Streets You Hold&quot; in 1997. Phoenix was an investor in the original House of Blues (founded by his good friend and &quot;Sneakers&quot; co-star Dan Aykroyd) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which opened its doors to the public after serving a group of homeless people on Thanksgiving Day 1992.

==Activism==
Phoenix was a dedicated animal rights and environmental activist. He was a vegan from the age of seven. He was a prominent spokesperson for PETA and won their Humanitarian Award in 1992 for his fund-raising efforts. His first girlfriend Martha Plimpton recalled: &quot;Once when we were fifteen, River and I went out for a fancy dinner in Manhattan, and I ordered soft-shell crabs. He left the restaurant and walked around on Park Avenue, crying. I went out and he said, &#x27;I love you so much, why? ... &#x27; He had such pain that I was eating an animal, that he hadn&#x27;t impressed on me what was right.&quot;

In 1990, Phoenix wrote an environmental awareness essay about Earth Day targeted at his young fan base, which was printed in &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine. He financially aided many environmental and humanitarian organizations, and bought of endangered rainforest in Costa Rica. As well as giving speeches at rallies for various groups, Phoenix and his band often played environmental benefits for well-known charities as well as local ones in the Gainesville, Florida area.

He campaigned for Bill Clinton in the 1992 U.S. presidential election.

==Personal life==
In February 1986, during the filming of &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot;, Phoenix began a romance with his co-star Martha Plimpton. They had met a year earlier but initially disliked each other. They also co-starred in the 1988 film &quot;Running on Empty&quot; before the relationship ended in June 1989 due to Phoenix&#x27;s drug use. The two maintained a close friendship until his death. Plimpton later stated, &quot;When we split up, a lot of it was that I had learned that screaming, fighting and begging wasn&#x27;t going to change him. He had to change himself, and he didn&#x27;t want to yet.&quot;

&quot;Pink&quot;, a &quot;roman à clef&quot; by director Gus Van Sant, asserts that Phoenix was not a regular drug user but only an occasional one, and that the actor had a more serious problem with alcohol. Phoenix had always tried to hide his addictions because he feared that they might ruin his career as they did his relationship with Plimpton.

For the last year of his life, in 1993, he dated his &quot;The Thing Called Love&quot; co-star Samantha Mathis. Mathis was with Phoenix on the night he died.

== Death ==

In late October 1993, Phoenix had returned to Los Angeles after flying back from spending one week in New Mexico. Before that, he had spent six to seven weeks in Utah to complete the three weeks of interior shots left on his last project, &quot;Dark Blood&quot;.

In Bob Forrest&#x27;s book, &quot;Running with Monsters&quot;, he wrote that Phoenix spent the days preceding his death on a drug binge with John Frusciante from the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Phoenix and Frusciante were consuming cocaine and heroin and had not slept for several days.
On the evening of October 30, 1993, Phoenix arrived with his girlfriend Samantha Mathis, his brother Joaquin, and sister Rain at The Viper Room, a Hollywood nightclub partly owned by Johnny Depp. Phoenix was to perform with the band P, which featured Phoenix&#x27;s friends Flea and John Frusciante from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Gibby Haynes of the Butthole Surfers, Al Jourgensen of Ministry, and Depp.

According to Bob Forrest, during the performance by P, Phoenix tapped Forrest on the shoulder to tell him he was not feeling well and that he thought he had overdosed. Forrest said to Phoenix that he did not think that he was overdosing because he could stand and talk. Nonetheless, he offered to take Phoenix home, but the latter declined, saying he was feeling better. A few moments later, Forrest said that a commotion erupted in the club and he went outside to find Mathis screaming as her boyfriend was lying on the sidewalk having convulsions. Unable to determine whether Phoenix was breathing, Joaquin called 911. Rain proceeded to give Phoenix mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

According to Gibby Haynes, the band was performing their song &quot;Michael Stipe&quot; while Phoenix was outside the venue having seizures on the sidewalk. When the news filtered through the club, Flea left the stage and rushed outside. By that time, paramedics had arrived on the scene and found Phoenix in apparent cardiac arrest. Flea accompanied him to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, but attempts to resuscitate Phoenix at the hospital were unsuccessful. He was pronounced dead at 1:51 a.m. PST on the morning of October 31, 1993, at the age of 23.

===Aftermath===
Years later, Samantha Mathis said that during her relationship with Phoenix, she had known him to be sober. However, Mathis added that in the moments just before his death, she &quot;knew something was going on&quot;. She said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t see anyone doing drugs [that night] but he was high in a way that made me feel uncomfortable&quot;. She also said that &quot;the heroin that killed him didn&#x27;t happen until he was in the Viper Room&quot;. Mathis went to the restroom; on her way back to the table, she saw Phoenix scuffling with another man. The bouncers removed both men from the club. Mathis shouted at the other man, &quot;What have you done? What are you on?&quot; Another person responded, &quot;Leave him alone, you&#x27;re spoiling his high.&quot; By that time, Phoenix had fallen to the ground and begun to convulse.

After Phoenix&#x27;s death, the club became a makeshift shrine, with fans and mourners leaving flowers, pictures and candles on the sidewalk, and graffiti messages on the walls of the venue. A sign was placed in the window that read, &quot;With much respect and love to River and his family, The Viper Room is temporarily closed. Our heartfelt condolences to all his family, friends and loved ones. He will be missed.&quot; The club remained closed for a week. Depp continued to close the club every year on October 31 until selling his share in 2004.

The autopsy report, finished on November 15, 1993, stated that there were &quot;high concentrations of morphine and cocaine in the blood, as well as other substances in smaller concentrations.&quot; The cause of death was &quot;acute multiple drug intoxication&quot;.

On November 24, 1993, Arlyn Phoenix (who later changed her name to Heart) published an open letter in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on her son&#x27;s life and death. It read, in part:

Before his death, Phoenix&#x27;s image—one he bemoaned in interviews—had been of a clean and attractive role model. Phoenix spoke often of his firm opposition to all forms of oppression, and affirmatively espoused beliefs in compassion that reach across narrow boundaries including racial, national and species. For example, the actor declined a lucrative advertising gig that would have required him to wear the skin of a tortured cow, which led his peers to endorse Phoenix&#x27;s image as a courageous role model. Phoenix&#x27;s compassion for all beings was evident, and he was widely regarded &quot;as the model of good health, clean living, and professional dedication—a cleaned-up &#x27;90s James Dean. He was known as a vegan, or ultra-vegetarian, who would not eat meat or dairy products or wear leather.&quot; His death was unexpected and elicited widespread media coverage. Phoenix was described by one writer as &quot;the vegan James Dean&quot;, and comparisons were made regarding the youth and sudden deaths of both actors.

==Awards, honors and legacy ==
Actors who have credited Phoenix as a major influence as well as paving the way for them include Leonardo DiCaprio, Jared Leto and James Franco. As teenagers, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck used &quot;RiverP,&quot; in homage to Phoenix, as the password to the bank account they shared. During his acceptance speech for Best Actor at the 92nd Academy Awards, Joaquin Phoenix honored his brother by stating &quot;When he was 17, my brother [River] wrote this lyric. He said: &#x27;run to the rescue with love and peace will follow. Joaquin and partner Rooney Mara named their son, River, after him.

Phoenix has been ranked on a number of lists recognizing his talent and career. He was listed as one of twelve &quot;Promising New Actors of 1986&quot; in &quot;John Willis&#x27; Screen World&quot; (2004). Phoenix was voted at No. 64 on a &quot;Greatest Movie Stars of All Time&quot; poll by Channel 4 television in the UK. The poll was made up wholly of votes from prominent figures of the acting and directing communities. He was ranked No. 86 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time&quot; list in 1997.

== In popular culture ==
Phoenix&#x27;s status as a teen idol and promising young actor, and his subsequent premature death, made him a frequent subject in popular culture media. He first gained references in music with Brazilian singer Milton Nascimento writing the song &quot;River Phoenix: Letter to a Young Actor&quot; about him after having seen Phoenix in &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; (1986). The song appears on the 1989 release &quot;Miltons&quot;.

Gus Van Sant, with whom Phoenix worked in the film &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot;, dedicated his 1993 movie &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot; as well as his 1997 novel &quot;Pink&quot; to him. Experimental Santa Cruz filmmaker Cam Archer also produced a documentary called &quot;Drowning River Phoenix&quot; as part of his American Fame series.

Natalie Merchant, singer from 10,000 Maniacs, wrote and sang about the media&#x27;s immediate and critical effect on culture and cultural icons such as River Phoenix. In &quot;River&quot;, a 1995 song from &quot;Tigerlily&quot;, Merchant defends River Phoenix as she castigates the media for systematically dissecting the child actor after his death.

Phoenix was the subject of a controversial song by Australian group TISM titled &quot;(He&#x27;ll Never Be An) Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;. The single originally featured a mock-up of Phoenix&#x27;s tombstone as its cover art in 1995. The chorus features the line, &quot;I&#x27;m on the drug that killed River Phoenix.&quot;

A lesser-known reference to River Phoenix was &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; main protagonist Squall Leonhart. Tetsuya Nomura, the lead character designer for the game, stated he modeled Squall on Phoenix&#x27;s visage during development and even gave Squall the same birthdate. The scene of Phoenix&#x27;s death also merits several mentions in William Gibson&#x27;s book &quot;Spook Country&quot;.

Rapper Tyler, the Creator references Phoenix in his 2017&#x27;s &quot;Flower Boy&quot;, perceived by some critics as a kind of coming out album.

With the song &quot;Halloween&quot; on the album &quot;Storm Hymnal: Gems from the Vault&quot;, the band Grant Lee Buffalo paid homage to River Phoenix. The lyrics in the refrain are: &quot;You were like my own James Byron Dean/ Private Idaho was my East of Eden/ Hit me like a stone when I heard you passed/ On Halloween&quot;.

Phoenix&#x27;s acting, music and &#x27;manifesto&#x27; was cited by English author Guy Mankowski as having a large influence on his 2020 novel &quot;Dead Rock Stars&quot;.

<text>David Paul Boreanaz (; born May 16, 1969) is an American actor, television producer, and director known for playing the roles of vampire-turned-private investigator Angel on The WB/UPN&quot; Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1997–2003) and its spinoff &quot;Angel&quot; (1999–2004); FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth, a homicide investigator, on the Fox television crime procedural comedy-drama series &quot;Bones&quot; (2005–2017); and United States Navy SEAL Master Chief Petty Officer Jason Hayes in CBS/Paramount+ military drama series &quot;SEAL Team&quot; (2017–2024).

==Early life==
David Paul Boreanaz was born in Buffalo, New York, where his father Dave Roberts (born David Thomas Boreanaz) was working for ABC affiliate WKBW-TV as a weather presenter and host of children&#x27;s show &quot;Rocketship 7&quot;. His mother Patti Boreanaz was a travel agent. He has two older sisters. He is of Italian and Slovak descent on his father&#x27;s side. His mother is of half Slovak and part Irish, German, French, and Swiss descent.

When Boreanaz was seven years old, the family moved to the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, area after his father took a job at local ABC affiliate, WPVI-TV. Boreanaz was raised Catholic and attended Rosemont School of the Holy Child at Rosemont, Pennsylvania and then high school at Malvern Preparatory School in Malvern, Pennsylvania, where he was a keen athlete and played on the school football team. He graduated from Ithaca College in Ithaca, New York, in 1991 with a degree in cinema and photography.

==Career==
Boreanaz moved to Los Angeles with a degree in filmmaking, but found, like many other struggling actors, gaining work initially difficult. Boreanaz slept on a couch at his sister&#x27;s place, visiting film sets and doing production assistant work to learn more about the industry in which he hoped to be more involved. He was a background extra in the 1993 film &quot;Aspen Extreme&quot; as a fan waving at skiers. He also prepared props for &quot;Best of the Best II&quot; (also released in 1993), which stars Eric Roberts, where he also had a small uncredited role; Boreanaz is seen briefly standing to the left, as the characters Tommy Lee and Alex enter a nightclub (which is a front for an illegal fighting ring).

Boreanaz&#x27;s first paid acting appearance was a 1993 guest spot on the American sitcom &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, as Kelly&#x27;s unfaithful biker boyfriend, who gets pummeled by her father, Al. He was cast in the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, after being suggested for the role to Marti Noxon by one of Boreanaz&#x27;s neighbors, after he was seen walking his dog past their house on a regular basis. In the cult series, he played the mysterious Angel, a vampire cursed by Romani people with a soul as punishment for his murdering a Romani girl, initially resulting in debilitating remorse and then a life of contrition. The show became enormously successful and Boreanaz starred in a spin-off series, &quot;Angel&quot;, which gave the character a chance to evolve and concentrated on Angel&#x27;s battle for redemption for the numerous murders he committed before he regained his soul. He appeared on &quot;Buffy&quot; from 1997 to 1999, when he began starring in &quot;Angel&quot;, which ran until 2004, with a recurring role on &quot;Buffy&quot; after his departure. He also appeared in the film &quot;Macabre Pair of Shorts&quot;, wherein he plays a vampire&#x27;s victim (in the segment &quot;MPS&quot;).

Boreanaz&#x27;s only starring role in a major theatrical film was in 2001&#x27;s slasher horror film &quot;Valentine&quot;, alongside Denise Richards and Katherine Heigl. In 2002, he had a supporting role in the film &quot;I&#x27;m with Lucy&quot;. In 2003, he appeared in the music video for singer Dido&#x27;s hit single &quot;White Flag&quot;, and was the voice of Leon (Squall Leonhart) in the video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, but did not reprise his role in the sequel.

In 2005, Boreanaz began starring opposite Emily Deschanel on the primetime television series &quot;Bones&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;These Girls&quot;, a Canadian film in which he played a biker; the film received a limited theatrical release in Canada in March 2006, after premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival and the Vancouver International Film Festival. He has also starred in the independent films &quot;Mr. Fix It&quot; and &quot;Suffering Man&#x27;s Charity&quot; (released on DVD as &quot;Ghost Writer&quot;), as well as the direct-to-DVD sequel &quot;The Crow: Wicked Prayer&quot; in which he starred alongside Tara Reid. In 2006, he starred in another DVD release, &quot;The Hard Easy&quot;, which also starred Steve Buscemi, Vera Farmiga, and Nick Lachey.

In that same year, he also voiced Hal Jordan in the direct-to-video DC Comics animated feature &quot;Justice League: The New Frontier&quot;. In the season-three finale of his TV series &quot;Bones&quot;, Boreanaz&#x27;s character Seeley Booth is seen in his bathtub reading an issue of&quot; Green Lantern&quot;. As well as being a producer on &quot;Bones&quot; since its third season, Boreanaz also directed at least one episode every season since season four. BuddyTV ranked him number 13 on its &quot;TV&#x27;s 100 Sexiest Men of 2010&quot; list and number 18 in 2011.

In the 2011 film &quot;The Mighty Macs&quot;, Boreanaz played the role of Ed T. Rush, NBA referee and husband of Immaculata basketball coach Cathy Rush. In 2013, Boreanaz starred in the miniseries &quot;Full Circle&quot; as Jace Cooper. The same year, Boreanaz starred in the independently made fantasy drama &quot;Officer Down&quot; as Detective Les Scanlon. Boreanaz has also appeared on &quot;American Dad!&quot; as Seeley Booth in the episode &quot;Less Money, Mo&#x27; Problems&quot;, on &quot;Family Guy&quot; as himself in the episode &quot;Road to the North Pole&quot;, and in the &quot;Baby Blues&quot; episode &quot;Teddy-Cam&quot; as the voice of Johnny.

On March 22, 2017, Boreanaz joined the cast of a CBS drama project based on the United States Navy SEALs. The project received a series order on May 12, 2017, and became known as &quot;SEAL Team&quot;, which premiered on September 27, 2017.

==Personal life==

Boreanaz was married to Ingrid Quinn from 1997 to 1999. He wed &quot;Playboy&quot; model Jaime Bergman on November 24, 2001. They have a son, Jaden Rayne Boreanaz, born May 1, 2002, and a daughter, Bella Vita Bardot Boreanaz (born Bardot Vita Boreanaz), born August 31, 2009.

In 2004, Boreanaz underwent reconstructive surgery on the anterior cruciate ligament of his left knee, a result of a running injury he suffered in high school that was not fully corrected at that time. His recovery did not prevent &quot;Angel&quot; production from continuing, but did limit his mobility and physical activities in several episodes, including his directorial debut, &quot;Soul Purpose&quot;.

In 2010, Boreanaz admitted to having an extramarital affair with Rachel Uchitel, the same woman with whom Tiger Woods was alleged to have cheated on his wife. Boreanaz has claimed that Uchitel tried to blackmail him. At the time of Boreanaz&#x27;s affair, his wife was pregnant.

In 2013, Boreanaz, his wife, and their friends Melissa and Aaron Ravo started the nail polish line Chrome Girl. The two wives run the day-to-day operations, while their husbands help with the overall business. Boreanaz was involved with the creation of the NHL colors line and supports them publicly, while Aaron, who works in advertising, has helped out with public relations work and marketing.

Boreanaz is a hockey fan and an avid supporter of the Philadelphia Flyers and Philadelphia Eagles.

===Sexual harassment lawsuit===
A co-worker on the set of &quot;Bones&quot; sued Boreanaz in 2010 for sexual harassment, stating he repeatedly attempted to kiss and fondle her. In March 2011, the woman&#x27;s attorney requested the lawsuit be dismissed, stating the matter was resolved.

<doc id="159270" wikidata="Q582293" url="?curid=159270" title="Anastrophe">
<text>Anastrophe (from the , &quot;anastrophē&quot;, &quot;a turning back or about&quot;) is a figure of speech in which the normal word order of the subject, the verb, and the object is changed.

Anastrophe is a hyponym of the antimetabole, where anastrophe only transposes one word in a sentence. For example, subject–verb–object (&quot;I like potatoes&quot;) might be changed to object–subject–verb (&quot;potatoes I like&quot;).

== Examples ==
Because English has a settled natural word order, anastrophe emphasizes the displaced word or phrase. For example, the name of the City Beautiful urbanist movement emphasises &quot;beautiful&quot;. Similarly, in &quot;This is the forest primeval&quot;, from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;Evangeline&quot;, the emphasis is on &quot;primeval&quot;.

If the emphasis that comes from anastrophe is not an issue, the synonym &quot;inversion&quot; is perfectly suitable.

Anastrophe is common in Ancient Greek and Latin poetry, such as in the first line of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;:

:&quot;Arma virumque cano, Troiæ qui primus ab oris&quot;
::(&quot;I sing of arms and the man, who first from the shores of Troy&quot;)

In the example, the genitive case noun &quot;Troiæ&quot; (&quot;of Troy&quot;) has been separated from the noun that it governs (&quot;oris&quot;, &quot;shores&quot;) in a way that would be rather unusual in Latin prose. In fact, the liberty of Latin word order allows &quot;of Troy&quot; to be taken to modify &quot;arms&quot; or &quot;the man&quot; but is not customarily interpreted so.

Anastrophe also occurs in English poetry, as in the third verse of Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;:

:He holds him with his skinny hand,
::&quot;There was a ship,&quot; quoth he.
:&quot;Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!&quot;
::Eftsoons his hand dropt he.

The word order of &quot;his hand dropt he&quot; is not the customary word order in English, even in the archaic English that Coleridge seeks to imitate. Also, excessive use of the device if the emphasis is unnecessary or even unintended, especially for the sake of rhyme or metre, is usually considered a flaw, such as the clumsy versification of Sternhold and Hopkins&#x27;s metrical psalter:

:The earth is all the Lord&#x27;s, with all
::her store and furniture;
:Yea, his is all the work, and all
::that therein doth endure:

:For he hath fastly founded it
::above the seas to stand,
:And placed below the liquid floods,
::to flow beneath the land.

However, some poets have a style that depends on heavy use of anastrophe. Gerard Manley Hopkins is particularly identified with the device, which renders his poetry susceptible to parody:

:Hope holds to Christ the mind&#x27;s own mirror out 
:To take His lovely likeness more and more.

When anastrophe draws an adverb to the head of a thought, such as for emphasis, the verb is drawn along. That causes a verb-subject inversion:
:&quot;Never have I found the limits of the photographic potential. Every horizon, upon being reached, reveals another beckoning in the distance&quot; (W. Eugene Smith).
In Robert Frost&#x27;s &quot;Mending Wall,&quot; the poem&#x27;s opening clause begins with an object noun, and yet this inversion does not occur, effectively creating a tension that is worked against through the rest of the poem:
:&quot;Something there is that doesn&#x27;t love a wall...&quot;

A popular cultural example of anastrophe would be Yoda from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series.
“Powerful you have become, the dark side I sense in you.”

<text>ElcomSoft is a privately owned software company headquartered in Moscow, Russia. Since its establishment in 1990, the company has been working on computer security programs, with the main focus on password and system recovery software.

==DMCA case==
On July 16, 2001, Dmitry Sklyarov, a Russian citizen employed by ElcomSoft who was at the time visiting the United States for DEF CON, was arrested and charged for violating the United States DMCA law by writing ElcomSoft&#x27;s Advanced eBook Processor software. He was later released on bail and allowed to return to Russia, and the charges against him were dropped. The charges against ElcomSoft were not, and a court case ensued, attracting much public attention and protest. On December 17, 2002, ElcomSoft was found not guilty of all four charges under the DMCA.

==Thunder Tables==
Thunder Tables is the company&#x27;s own technology developed to ensure guaranteed recovery of Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel documents protected with 40-bit encryption. The technology first appeared in 2007 and employs the time–memory tradeoff method to build pre-computed hash tables, which open the corresponding files in a matter of seconds instead of days. These tables take around four gigabytes. So far, the technology is used in two password recovery programs: Advanced Office Password Breaker and Advanced PDF Password Recovery.

== Cracking Wi-Fi passwords with GPUs ==
In 2009 ElcomSoft released a tool that takes WPA/WPA2 Hash Codes and uses brute-force methods to guess the password associated with a wireless network.

The advantages of using such methods over the traditional ones, such as rainbow tables, are numerous.

== Vulnerability in Canon authentication software ==
On November 30, 2010, Elcomsoft announced that the encryption system used by Canon cameras to ensure that pictures and Exif metadata have not been altered was flawed and cannot be fixed. 
On that same day, Dmitry Sklyarov gave a presentation at the Confidence 2.0 conference in Prague demonstrating the flaws. Among others, he showed an image of an astronaut planting a flag of the Soviet Union on the moon; all the images pass Canon&#x27;s authenticity verification.

==Nude celebrity photo leak==
In 2014 an attacker used the Elcomsoft Phone Password Breaker to determine celebrity Jennifer Lawrence&#x27;s password and obtain nude photos. Wired said about Apple&#x27;s cloud services, &quot;...cloud services might be about as secure as leaving your front door key under the mat.&quot;

<doc id="159273" wikidata="Q501866" url="?curid=159273" title="United States invasion of Grenada">
<text>The United States and a coalition of Caribbean countries invaded the small island nation of Grenada, north of Venezuela, at dawn on 25 October 1983. Codenamed Operation Urgent Fury by the U.S. military, it resulted in military occupation within a few days. It was triggered by strife within the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Government, which led to the house arrest and execution of the previous leader and second Prime Minister of Grenada, Maurice Bishop, and to the establishment of the Revolutionary Military Council, with Hudson Austin as chairman. Following the invasion there was an interim government appointed, and then general elections held in December 1984.

The invading force consisted of the 1st and 2nd battalions of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 75th Ranger Regiment, the 82nd Airborne Division, and elements of the former Rapid Deployment Force, U.S. Marines, U.S. Army Delta Force, Navy SEALs, and a small group Air Force TACPs from the 21st TASS Shaw AFB ancillary forces, totaling 7,600 troops, together with Jamaican forces and troops of the Regional Security System (RSS). The invaders quickly defeated Grenadian resistance after a low-altitude assault by the Rangers and 82nd Airborne at Point Salines Airport on the island&#x27;s south end, and a Marine helicopter and amphibious landing at Pearls Airport on the north end. Austin&#x27;s military government was deposed. An advisory council designated Sir Paul Scoon as Governor-General of Grenada until the 1984 elections.

The invasion date of 25 October is now a national holiday in Grenada, called Thanksgiving Day, commemorating the freeing of several political prisoners who were subsequently elected to office. A truth and reconciliation commission was launched in 2000 to re-examine some of the controversies of that tumultuous period in the 1980s; in particular, the commission made an unsuccessful attempt to locate the remains of Maurice Bishop&#x27;s body, which had been disposed of at Austin&#x27;s order and never found.

At the time, the invasion drew criticism from many countries. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher privately disapproved of the mission, in part because she was not consulted in advance and was given very short notice of the military operation, but she supported it in public. The United Nations General Assembly condemned it as &quot;a flagrant violation of international law&quot; on 2 November 1983, by a vote of 108 to 9.

The invasion exposed communication and coordination problems between the different branches of the U.S. military when operating together as a joint force. This triggered post-action investigations resulting in sweeping operational changes in the form of the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act.

==Background==

In 1974, Sir Eric Gairy led Grenada to independence from the United Kingdom, but his term in office was marred by civil unrest. Although his Grenada United Labour Party claimed victory in the general election of 1976, the opposition did not accept the result as legitimate. During his tenure, many Grenadians believed Gairy was personally responsible for the economic decline of the island and accused him of corruption. The civil unrest took the form of street violence between Gairy&#x27;s private militia, the Mongoose Gang, and a militia organized by the communist New Jewel Movement (NJM) party.

On 13 March 1979, while Gairy was temporarily out of the country, Maurice Bishop and his NJM seized power in a nearly bloodless coup. He established the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Government, suspended the constitution, and detained several political prisoners. Bishop was a forceful speaker who introduced Marxist ideology to Grenadians while also appealing to Black Americans during the 1970s heyday of the Black Panther movement. After seizing power, Bishop attempted to implement the first Marxist-Leninist nation in the British Commonwealth. To lend itself an appearance of constitutional legitimacy, the new administration continued to recognize Queen Elizabeth II as Queen of Grenada and Sir Paul Scoon as her viceregal representative.

===Airport===

The Bishop government began constructing the Point Salines International Airport with the help of the United Kingdom, Cuba, Libya, Algeria, and other nations. The British government proposed the airport in 1954 when Grenada was still a British colony. Canadians designed it, the British government underwrote it, and a London firm built it. The U.S. government accused Grenada of constructing facilities to aid a Soviet-Cuban military buildup in the Caribbean. The accusation was based on the fact that the new airport&#x27;s runway would be able to accommodate the largest Soviet aircraft, such as the An-12, An-22, and An-124. Such a facility, according to the U.S., would enhance the Soviet and Cuban transportation of weapons to Central American insurgents and expand Soviet regional influence. Bishop&#x27;s government claimed that the airport was built to handle commercial aircraft carrying tourists, pointing out that such jets could not land at Pearls Airport with its runway on the island&#x27;s north end, and that Pearls could not be expanded because its runway abutted a mountain on one side and the ocean on the other.

In 1983, Representative Ron Dellums (D-CA) traveled to Grenada on a fact-finding mission, having been invited by Prime Minister Bishop. Dellums described his findings before Congress:

Based on my personal observations, discussion, and analysis of the new international airport under construction in Grenada, it is my conclusion that this project is specifically now and has always been for the purpose of economic development and is not for military use... It is my thought that it is absurd, patronizing, and totally unwarranted for the United States government to charge that this airport poses a military threat to the United States&#x27; national security.

In March 1983, President Reagan began issuing warnings about the danger to the United States and Caribbean nations if the Soviet-Cuban militarization of that region was allowed to proceed. He pointed to the excessively long airport runway being built and referenced intelligence reports showing increased Soviet interest in the island. He said the runway, along with the airport&#x27;s numerous fuel storage tanks, were unnecessary for commercial flights and that the evidence suggested the airport would become a Cuban-Soviet forward military airbase.

Meanwhile, an internal power struggle was brewing in Grenada over Bishop&#x27;s leadership performance. In September 1983 at a Central Committee party meeting, he was pressured into sharing power with Deputy Prime Minister Bernard Coard. Bishop initially agreed to the joint leadership proposal, but later balked at the idea, which brought matters to a crisis.

===October 1983===

On the evening of 13 October 1983, the Coard faction of the Central Committee, in conjunction with the People’s Revolutionary Army, placed Prime Minister Bishop and several of his allies under house arrest. On 19 October, after Bishop&#x27;s secret detention became widely known, he was freed by a large crowd of supporters, estimated between 15,000 and 30,000. He led the crowd to a relatively unguarded Fort Rupert (later renamed Fort George) which they soon occupied. At nearby Fort Frederick, Coard had gathered nine Central Committee members and sizable factions of the military. As one journalist writes, &quot;What happened next, and on whose orders, is still a controversy.&quot; But a mass of troops in armored personnel carriers, under the supervision of Lt. Colonel Ewart Layne, departed Fort Frederick for Fort Rupert to, as Layne described it, &quot;recapture the fort and restore order.&quot; After surrendering to the superior force, Bishop and seven leaders loyal to him were lined up against a wall in Fort Rupert&#x27;s courtyard and faced a firing squad.

The army under Hudson Austin then stepped in and formed a military council to rule the country, and placed Sir Paul Scoon under house arrest in Government House. The army instituted a strict four-day curfew during which anyone seen on the streets would be shot on sight.

Within only a few days of these events in Grenada, the Reagan administration mounted a U.S.-led military intervention following a formal appeal for help from the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, which had received a covert request for help from Paul Scoon (though he put off signing the official letter of invitation until 26 October). Among the key invasion planners were Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and his senior military assistant Colin Powell. Regarding the speed with which the invasion commenced, it was said the U.S. had been conducting mock invasions of Grenada since 1981: &quot;These exercises, part of Ocean Venture &#x27;81 and known as Operation Amber and the Amberdines, involved air and amphibious assaults on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques. According to the plans for these maneuvers, &#x27;Amber&#x27; was considered a hypothetical island in the Eastern Caribbean which had engaged in anti-democratic revolutionary activities.&quot;

Reagan stated that he felt compelled to act due to &quot;concerns over the 600 U.S. medical students on the island&quot; and fears of a repeat of the Iran hostage crisis, which ended less than three years earlier. Future U.S. Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, who was then serving as Reagan&#x27;s Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, later admitted that the prime motivation for the intervention was to &quot;get rid&quot; of the coup leader Hudson Austin, and that the students were a pretext. Although the invasion occurred after the execution of Prime Minister Bishop, the remaining Grenadian ruling party members were still committed to Bishop&#x27;s Marxist ideology. Reagan said he viewed these factors, alongside the party&#x27;s growing connection to Fidel Castro, as a threat to democracy.

The Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), Barbados, and Jamaica all appealed to the United States for assistance. For safety reasons, Paul Scoon had requested the invasion through secret diplomatic channels, using the reserve powers vested in the Crown. On 22 October 1983, the Deputy High Commissioner in Bridgetown, Barbados, visited Grenada and reported that Scoon was well and &quot;did not request military intervention, either directly or indirectly&quot;. However, on the day after the invasion, Prime Minister of Dominica Eugenia Charles stated the request had come from Scoon, through the OECS, and, in his 2003 autobiography, &quot;Survival for Service&quot;, Scoon maintains he asked the visiting British diplomat to pass along &quot;an oral request&quot; for outside military intervention at this meeting.

On 25 October, the combined forces of the United States and the Regional Security System (RSS) based in Barbados invaded Grenada in an operation codenamed &quot;Operation Urgent Fury&quot;. The United States insisted this was being done at the request of Barbados&#x27; Prime Minister Tom Adams and Dominica&#x27;s Prime Minister Eugenia Charles. The invasion was sharply criticized by the governments in Canada, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United Kingdom. By a vote of 108 to 9, with 27 abstentions, the United Nations General Assembly condemned it as &quot;a flagrant violation of international law.&quot;

==First day of the invasion==

H-hour for the invasion was set for 05:00 on 25 October 1983. U.S. troops deployed for Grenada by helicopter from Grantley Adams International Airport on Barbados before daybreak. Nearly simultaneously, American paratroopers arrived directly by transport aircraft from bases in the eastern United States, and U.S. Marines were airlifted to the island from USS &quot;Guam&quot; offshore. It was the largest American military action since the Vietnam War. Vice Admiral Joseph Metcalf III, Commander of the Second Fleet, was the overall commander of American forces, designated Joint Task Force 120, which included elements of each military service and multiple special operations units. Fighting continued for several days and the total number of American troops reached some 7,000 along with 300 troops from the Organization of American States, commanded by Brigadier Rudyard Lewis of Barbados.

The main objectives on the first day were for the 75th Ranger Regiment to capture Point Salines International Airport in order for the 82nd Airborne Division to land reinforcements on the island; the 2nd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment to capture Pearls Airport; and other forces to rescue the American students at the True Blue Campus of St. George&#x27;s University. In addition, a number of special operations missions were undertaken by Army Delta Force operatives and Navy SEALs to obtain intelligence and secure key individuals and equipment. Many of these missions were plagued by inadequate intelligence and planning; the American troops used tourist maps with military grids superimposed on them.

===Defending forces===

====People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army====

The invading forces encountered about 1,500 Grenadian soldiers of the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (PRA) manning defensive positions. The PRA troops were for the most part equipped with light weapons, mostly Kalashnikov-pattern automatic rifles of Soviet bloc origin and semiautomatic Czech Vz. 52 carbines, along with smaller numbers of obsolete SKS carbines and PPSh-41 submachine guns. They had few heavy weapons and no modern air defense systems. The PRA was not regarded as a serious military threat by the U.S., which was more concerned by the possibility that Cuba would send a large expeditionary force to intervene on behalf of its erstwhile ally.

The PRA did possess eight BTR-60PB armored personnel carriers and two BRDM-2 armored cars delivered as military aid from the Soviet Union in February 1981, but no tanks.

====Cuban forces in Grenada====

The Cuban military presence in Grenada was more complex than initially evaluated by the U.S. Most of the Cuban civilian expatriates present were also military reservists. Fidel Castro described the Cuban construction crews in Grenada as &quot;workers and soldiers at the same time&quot;, claiming the dual nature of their role was consistent with Cuba&#x27;s &quot;citizen soldier&quot; tradition. At the time of the invasion, there were an estimated 784 Cuban nationals on the island. About 630 of the Cuban nationals listed their occupations as construction workers, another 64 as military personnel, and 18 as dependents. The remainder were medical staff or teachers.

Colonel Pedro Tortoló Comas was the highest-ranking Cuban military officer in Grenada in 1983, and he later stated that he issued small arms and ammunition to the construction workers for the purpose of self-defense during the invasion, which may have further blurred the line between their status as civilians and combatants. They were also expressly forbidden to surrender to U.S. military forces if approached. The regular Cuban military personnel on the island were serving as advisers to the PRA at the time. Cuban advisers and instructors deployed with overseas military missions were not confined to non-combat and technical support roles; if the units to which they were attached participated in an engagement, they were expected to fight alongside their foreign counterparts.

Bob Woodward wrote in &quot;Veil&quot; that captured &quot;military advisors&quot; from socialist countries, including Cuba, were actually accredited diplomats and their dependents. He claimed that none of them took any actual part in the fighting. The U.S. government asserted that most of the supposed Cuban civilian technicians on Grenada were in fact military personnel, including special forces and combat engineers. A summary of the Cuban presence in &quot;The Engineer&quot;, the official periodical of the U.S. Army Engineer School, noted that &quot;resistance from these well-armed military and paramilitary forces belied claims that they were simply construction crews.&quot;

===Navy SEAL reconnaissance missions===

U.S. Special Operations Forces were deployed to Grenada beginning on 23 October, before the 25 October invasion. Navy SEALs from SEAL Team 6 and Air Force combat controllers were air-dropped at sea to perform a reconnaissance mission on Point Salines. The helicopter drop went wrong; four SEALs were lost at sea and their bodies never recovered, causing most people to suspect they had drowned. The four SEALs were Machinist Mate 1st Class Kenneth J. Butcher, Quartermaster 1st Class Kevin E. Lundberg, Hull Technician 1st Class Stephen L. Morris, and Senior Chief Engineman Robert R. Schamberger. In an interview conducted by Bill Salisbury and published on 4 October 1990, Kenneth Butcher&#x27;s widow claimed that she had gone to Grenada hoping that her husband had survived. She said, &quot;There was this fisherman who said he saw four guys in wetsuits come out of the water, and then two days later he saw four bodies being thrown into the water. So we would like to think they made it, &#x27;cause there was a boat smashed up on the beach. We would like to think the four of them got in that boat, made it to shore, got someplace, and were captured. And they&#x27;re, you know, gonna come back.&quot; The SEAL and Air Force survivors continued their mission, but their boats flooded while evading a patrol boat, causing the mission to be aborted. Another SEAL mission on 24 October was also unsuccessful, due to harsh weather, resulting in little intelligence being gathered in advance of the impending intervention.

=== Air assault on Point Salines ===

Alpha and Bravo companies of the 1st Battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment embarked on C-130s at Hunter Army Airfield at midnight on 25 October to perform an air assault landing on Point Salines Airport, intending to land at the airport and then disembark. The Rangers had to switch abruptly to a parachute landing when they learned mid-flight that the runway was obstructed. The air drop began at 05:30 on 25 October in the face of moderate resistance from ZU-23 anti-aircraft guns and several BTR-60 armored personnel carriers (APCs), which were knocked out by M67 recoilless rifle fire. AC-130 gunships provided support for the landing. Cuban construction vehicles were commandeered to help clear the airfield, and one even used to provide mobile cover for the Rangers as they moved to seize the heights surrounding the airfield.

The Rangers cleared the airstrip of obstructions by 10:00, and transport planes were able to land and unload additional reinforcements, including M151 Jeeps and members of the Caribbean Peace Force assigned to guard the perimeter and detainees. Starting at 14:00, units began landing at Point Salines from the 82nd Airborne Division under Edward Trobaugh, including battalions of the 325th Infantry Regiment. At 15:30, three BTR-60s of the Grenadian Army Motorized Company counter-attacked, but the Americans repelled them with recoilless rifles and an AC-130.

The Rangers fanned out and secured the surrounding area, negotiating the surrender of over 100 Cubans in an aviation hangar. However, a Jeep-mounted Ranger patrol became lost searching for True Blue Campus and was ambushed, with four killed. The Rangers eventually secured True Blue campus and its students, where they found only 140 students and were told that more were at another campus in Grand Anse, northeast of True Blue. In all, the Rangers lost five men on the first day, but succeeded in securing Point Salines and the surrounding area.

===Capture of Pearls Airport===

A platoon of Navy SEALs from SEAL Team 4 under Lieutenant Mike Walsh approached the beach near Pearls Airport around midnight on 25 October after evading patrol boats and overcoming stormy weather. They found that the beach was lightly defended but unsuitable for an amphibious landing. The 2nd Battalion of the 8th Marine Regiment then landed south of Pearls Airport using CH-46 Sea Knight and CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters at 05:30 on 25 October; they captured Pearls Airport, encountering only light resistance, including a DShK machine gun which a Marine AH-1 Cobra destroyed.

===Raid on Radio Free Grenada===

UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters delivered SEAL Team 6 operators in the early morning of 25 October to Radio Free Grenada with the purpose of using the radio station for psychological operations. They captured the station unopposed and destroyed the radio transmitter. However, they were attacked by Grenadian forces in cars and an armored personnel carrier (APC), which forced the lightly-armed SEALs to cut open a fence and retreat into the ocean while receiving fire from the APC. The SEALs then reportedly swam to USS &quot;Caron&quot;. They swam toward the open sea, and were picked up several hours later after being spotted by a reconnaissance plane.

===Raids on Fort Rupert and Richmond Hill Prison===

On 25 October, Delta Force and C Company of the 75th Ranger Regiment embarked in UH-60 and MH-6 Little Bird helicopters of Task Force 160 to capture Fort Rupert (now known as Fort George), where they believed the Revolutionary Council leaders lived, and Richmond Hill Prison, where political prisoners were being held. The raid on Richmond Hill Prison lacked vital intelligence, leaving the attackers unaware of the presence of several anti-aircraft guns and steep hilly terrain that left no room for helicopter landings. Anti-aircraft fire wounded passengers and crew and forced one UH-60 helicopter to crash land, causing another helicopter to land next to it to protect the survivors. One pilot was killed, and the Delta Force operators had to be relieved by a Navy Sea King helicopter. The raid on Fort Rupert, however, was successful in capturing several leaders of the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Government.

===Mission to rescue Governor-General Scoon===

The last major special operation was a mission to rescue Governor-General Scoon from his mansion in Saint George, Grenada. The mission departed late at 05:30 on 25 October from Barbados, resulting in the Grenadian forces being already aware of the invasion and they guarded Scoon closely. The SEAL team entered the mansion without opposition, but BTR-60 armored personnel carriers counter-attacked and trapped the SEALs and governor inside. AC-130 gunships, A-7 Corsair strike planes, and AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters were called in to support the besieged SEALs, but they remained trapped for the next 24 hours.

At 19:00 on 25 October, 250 marines from G Company of the 2nd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment landed at Grand Mal Bay equipped with amphibious assault vehicles and four M60 Patton tanks; they relieved the Navy SEALs the following morning, allowing Governor Scoon, his wife, and nine aides to be safely evacuated at 10:00 that day. The Marine tank crews continued advancing in the face of sporadic resistance, knocking out a BRDM-2 armored car. G Company subsequently defeated and overwhelmed the Grenadian defenders at Fort Frederick.

=== Airstrikes ===

Navy A-7 Corsairs and Marine AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters made airstrikes against Fort Rupert and Fort Frederick. An A-7 raid on Fort Frederick targeting anti-aircraft guns hit a nearby mental hospital, killing 18 civilians. Two Marine AH-1T Cobras and a UH-60 Blackhawk were shot down in a raid against Fort Frederick, resulting in five casualties.

==Second day of the invasion==
General Trobaugh of the 82nd Airborne Division had two goals on the second day: securing the perimeter around Point Salines Airport, and rescuing American students held in Grand Anse. The Army lacked undamaged helicopters after the losses on the first day and consequently had to delay the student rescue until they made contact with Marine forces.

===Morning ambushes===
Early on the morning of 26 October, Cuban forces ambushed a patrol from the 2nd Battalion of the 325th Infantry Regiment near the village of Calliste. The American patrol suffered six wounded and two killed, including the commander of Company B, CPT Michael F. Ritz and squad leader SSG Gary L. Epps. Navy airstrikes and an artillery bombardment by 105mm howitzers targeting the main Cuban encampment eventually led to their surrender at 08:30. American forces pushed on to the village of Frequente, where they discovered a Cuban weapons cache reportedly sufficient to equip six battalions. Cuban forces ambushed a reconnaissance platoon mounted on gun-jeeps, but the jeeps returned fire, and a nearby infantry unit added mortar fire; the Cubans suffered four casualties with no American losses. Cuban resistance largely ended after these engagements.

===Rescue at Grand Anse===
On the afternoon of 26 October, Rangers of the 2nd Battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment mounted Marine CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters to launch an air assault on the Grand Anse campus. The campus police offered light resistance before fleeing, wounding one Ranger, and one of the helicopters crashed on approach after its blade hit a palm tree. The Rangers evacuated the 233 American students by CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters, but the students informed them that there was a third campus with Americans at Prickly Bay. A squad of 11 Rangers was accidentally left behind; they departed on a rubber raft which was picked up by at 23:00.

==Third day of the invasion and after==

By 27 October, organized resistance was rapidly diminishing, but the American forces did not yet realize this. The 2nd Battalion, 8th Marines continued advancing along the coast and capturing additional towns, meeting little resistance, although one patrol did encounter a single BTR-60 during the night, dispatching it with a M72 LAW. The 325th Infantry Regiment advanced toward the capital of Saint George, capturing Grand Anse and discovering 200 American students whom they had missed the first day. They continued to the town of Ruth Howard and Saint George, meeting only scattered resistance. An air-naval gunfire liaison team called in an A-7 airstrike and accidentally hit the command post of the 2nd Brigade, wounding 17 troops, one of whom died.

The Army had reports that PRA forces were amassing at the Calivigny Barracks, only five kilometers from the Point Salines airfield. They organized an air assault by the 2nd Battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment preceded by a preparatory bombardment by field howitzers (which mostly missed, their shells falling into the ocean), A-7s, AC-130s, and USS &quot;Caron&quot;. However, the Blackhawk helicopters began dropping off troops near the barracks but they approached too fast. One of them crash landed and the two behind it collided with it, killing three and wounding four. The barracks were deserted.

In the following days, resistance ended entirely and the Army and Marines spread across the island, arresting PRA officials, seizing caches of weapons, and seeing to the repatriation of Cuban engineers. On 1 November, two companies from the 2/8 Marines made a combined sea and helicopter landing on the island of Carriacou northeast of Grenada. The 19 Grenadian soldiers defending the island surrendered without a fight. This was the last military action of the campaign.

==Outcome==

It was confirmed Scoon had been in contact with Queen Elizabeth II ahead of the invasion; however, Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s office denied knowledge of any request for military action and the Queen was &quot;extremely upset&quot; by the invasion of one of her realms. The only document signed by the Governor-General and asking for military assistance was dated after the invasion, which fueled speculation that the United States had used Scoon as an excuse for its incursion into Grenada.

Official U.S. sources state that some of the opponents were well-prepared and well-positioned and put up stubborn resistance, to the extent that the Americans called in two battalions of reinforcements on the evening of 26 October. The total naval and air superiority of the American forces had overwhelmed the defenders. Nearly 8,000 Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines had participated in Operation Urgent Fury, along with 353 Caribbean allies from the Caribbean Peace Forces. The final U.S. report claims 19 killed and 116 wounded; the Cubans to have had 25 killed, 59 wounded and 638 &quot;combatants&quot; captured; the Grenadians to have suffered 45 killed and 358 wounded. At least 24 civilians were also killed, 18 of whom died in the accidental bombing of a Grenadian mental hospital. The U.S. troops also destroyed a significant amount of Grenada&#x27;s military hardware, including six BTR-60 APCs and a BRDM-2 armored car. A second BRDM-2 armored car was impounded and shipped back to Marine Corps Base Quantico for inspection.

==Legality of the invasion==

The U.S. government defended its invasion of Grenada as an action to protect American citizens living on the island, including medical students, and asserted it had been carried out at the request of the Governor-General. Deputy Secretary of State Kenneth W. Dam said that action was necessary to &quot;resolve&quot; what Article 28 of the charter of the Organization of American States (O.A.S.) refers to as &quot;a situation that might endanger the peace&quot;. He added that the OAS charter and the UN charter both &quot;recognize the competence of regional security bodies in ensuring regional peace and stability&quot;, referring to the decision by the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States to approve the invasion.

The UN Charter prohibits the use of force by member states except in cases of self-defense or when specifically authorized by the UN Security Council. The UN Security Council had not authorized this invasion. Similarly, the United Nations General Assembly adopted General Assembly Resolution 38/7 by a vote of 108 to 9 with 27 abstentions, which &quot;deeply deplores the armed intervention in Grenada, which constitutes a flagrant violation of international law&quot;. A similar resolution in the United Nations Security Council received widespread support but was vetoed by the United States.

==Reaction in the United States==

&quot;Time&quot; magazine described the invasion as having &quot;broad popular support&quot;. A congressional study group concluded that the invasion had been justified, as most members felt that American students at the university near a contested runway could have been taken hostage as American diplomats in Iran had been four years previously. The group&#x27;s report caused House Speaker Tip O&#x27;Neill to change his position on the issue from opposition to support.

However, some members of the study group dissented from its findings. Congressman Louis Stokes (D-OH) stated: &quot;Not a single American child nor single American national was in any way placed in danger or placed in a hostage situation prior to the invasion&quot;. The Congressional Black Caucus denounced the invasion, and seven Democratic congressmen introduced an unsuccessful resolution to impeach President Reagan, led by Ted Weiss (D-NY).

Medical students in Grenada, speaking to Ted Koppel on the 25 October 1983 edition of his newscast &quot;Nightline&quot;, stated that they were safe and did not feel their lives were in peril. The next evening, medical students told Koppel how grateful they were for the Army Rangers and the invasion which probably saved their lives. State Department officials had assured the students they would be able to complete their medical school education in the United States.

An anti-war march attended by over 50,000 people, including Burlington, Vermont Mayor Bernie Sanders, was held in Washington, D.C. The march received support from presidential candidate Jesse Jackson.

==International reaction==

The United Nations General Assembly adopted General Assembly Resolution 38/7 on 2 November 1983 by a vote of 108 to 9 which &quot;deeply deplores the armed intervention in Grenada, which constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of that State&quot;. It went on to deplore &quot;the death of innocent civilians&quot; and the &quot;killing of the Prime Minister and other prominent Grenadians&quot;, and it called for an &quot;immediate cessation of the armed intervention&quot; and demanded, &quot;that free elections be organized&quot;.

This was the first overthrow of a Communist government by armed means since the end of World War II. The Soviet Union said that Grenada had been the object of United States threats, that the invasion violated international law, and that no small nation would find itself safe if the aggression were not rebuffed. The governments of some countries stated that the United States intervention was a return to the era of barbarism. The governments of other countries said the United States had violated several treaties and conventions to which it was a party. A similar resolution was discussed in the United Nations Security Council but it was ultimately vetoed by the United States.

President Ronald Reagan was asked if he was concerned by the lopsided 108–9 vote in the UN General Assembly. He said, &quot;it didn&#x27;t upset my breakfast at all&quot;.

Grenada is part of the Commonwealth of Nations and the intervention was opposed by several Commonwealth members including the United Kingdom, Trinidad and Tobago, and Canada. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a close ally of Reagan on other matters, personally opposed it. Reagan had forewarned her it might happen; she did not know for sure that it was coming until three hours before. Although she publicly supported the action, she sent the following message to Reagan at 12:30 on the morning of the invasion:

Her complaints were not heeded, and the invasion continued as planned. While the fighting was still going on, Reagan phoned Thatcher to apologize for any miscommunication between them, and their long-term friendly relationship endured.

==Aftermath and legacy==

The American and Caribbean governments quickly reaffirmed Governor-General Sir Paul Scoon as Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s sole legitimate representative in Grenada, and hence the only lawful authority on the island. In accordance with Commonwealth constitutional practice, Scoon assumed power as interim head of government and formed an advisory council which named Nicholas Brathwaite as chairman, pending new elections. The New National Party won the elections in December 1984 and formed a government led by Prime Minister Herbert Blaize.

American forces remained in Grenada after combat operations finished in December as part of Operation Island Breeze. The remaining forces performed security missions and assisted members of the Caribbean Peacekeeping Force and the Royal Grenadian Police Force, including military police, special forces, and a specialized intelligence detachment.

In 1986, seventeen political, military and civilian figures were convicted of crimes associated with the 19 October 1983 executions of Prime Minister Bishop and his supporters. The convicted group became known as the Grenada 17. In light of their lengthy imprisonment, Amnesty International referred to them as &quot;the last of the Cold War prisoners&quot;.

===United States===

The invasion showed problems with the American &quot;information apparatus&quot;, which &quot;Time&quot; magazine described as still being in &quot;some disarray&quot; three weeks after the invasion. For example, the State Department falsely claimed that a mass grave had been discovered which held 100 bodies of islanders who had been killed by communist forces. Major General Norman Schwarzkopf, deputy commander of the invasion force, said that 160 Grenadian soldiers and 71 Cubans had been killed during the invasion; the Pentagon had given a count of 59 Cuban and Grenadian deaths. Ronald H. Cole&#x27;s report for the Joint Chiefs of Staff showed an even lower count.

Also of concern were the problems that the invasion exposed in military planning and operations. There was a lack of intelligence about Grenada which exacerbated the difficulties faced by the quickly assembled invasion force. For example, they did not know that the students were actually at two different campuses, and there was a 30-hour delay in reaching students at the second campus. Maps provided to soldiers on the ground (to report locations of units and request artillery and aircraft fire support) were tourist maps on which military grid reference lines were drawn by hand. These maps did not show topography and were not marked with crucial positions. Communications between services were not compatible and hindered the coordination of operations. Maps given to some members of the invasion force had their landing strips drawn by hand.

Reagan attempted to use the invasion of Grenada to end Vietnam Syndrome, a term used in reference to the American public&#x27;s aversion to overseas conflicts that resulted from the Vietnam War. After the invasion, on 13 December 1983, Reagan asserted that &quot;our days of weakness are over. Our military forces are back on their feet and standing tall.&quot;

===Goldwater–Nichols Act===

The Department of Defense recognized a need for improved communications and coordination among the branches of the U.S. military. Congress investigated many of the problems and passed the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 (Pub. L.99–433). This act reworked the command structure of the military, making the most sweeping changes to the Department of Defense since the department was established in the National Security Act of 1947. It increased the power of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and advanced the concept of unified joint forces organized under one command.

===Other===

25 October is a national holiday in Grenada, called Thanksgiving Day, to commemorate the invasion. St. George&#x27;s University (SGU) built a monument on its True Blue campus to honor the American servicemen killed during the invasion, and marks the day with an annual memorial ceremony.

After the Grenada invasion, Cuba became increasingly concerned the U.S. might also invade socialist Nicaragua where Cuba had supplied primary school teachers to help the country establish rural schools. As a consequence of the invasion, Cuba removed its female primary school teachers from Nicaragua.

On 29 May 2009, the Grenadian government changed the name of Point Salines International Airport to Maurice Bishop International Airport. Hundreds of Grenadians turned out for the occasion to honor Bishop&#x27;s memory. Prime Minister Tillman Thomas gave the keynote speech and referred to the airport renaming as an act of the Grenadian people coming home to themselves. He also hoped it would bring closure to a chapter of denial in Grenada&#x27;s history.

==Order of battle==

Vice Admiral Joseph Metcalf, III, COMSECONDFLT, became Commander of Joint Task Force 120 (CJTF 120) and commanded units from the Air Force, Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard from the MARG flagship USS &quot;Guam&quot;. Rear Admiral Richard C. Berry (COMCRUDESGRU Eight) (Commander Task Group 20) supported the task force on the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Independence&quot;. Commanding Officer USS Guam (Task Force 124) was assigned the mission of seizing Pearls Airport and the port of Grenville, and of neutralizing any opposing forces in the area. Simultaneously, Army Rangers in Task Force 123 would secure points at the southern end of the island, including the airfield under construction near Point Salines. The 82d Airborne Division (Task Force 121) were designated to follow and assume the security at Point Salines once it was seized by Task Force 123. Task Group 20.5, a carrier battle group built around USS &quot;Independence&quot;, and Air Force elements would support the ground forces.

<text>Emily Elizabeth Dickinson (December 10, 1830 – May 15, 1886) was an American poet. Little-known during her life, she has since been regarded as one of the most important figures in American poetry. Dickinson was born in Amherst, Massachusetts, into a prominent family with strong ties to its community. After studying at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before returning to her family&#x27;s home in Amherst. Evidence suggests that Dickinson lived much of her life in isolation. Considered an eccentric by locals, she developed a penchant for white clothing and was known for her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, even to leave her bedroom. Dickinson never married, and most of her friendships were based entirely upon correspondence.

Although Dickinson was a prolific writer, her only publications during her lifetime were one letter and 10 of her nearly 1,800 poems. The poems published then were usually edited significantly to fit conventional poetic rules. Her poems were unique for her era; they contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use slant rhyme as well as unconventional capitalization and punctuation. Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality (two recurring topics in letters to her friends), aesthetics, society, nature, and spirituality.

Although Dickinson&#x27;s acquaintances were most likely aware of her writing, it was not until after she died in 1886—when Lavinia, Dickinson&#x27;s younger sister, discovered her cache of poems—that her work became public. Her first published collection of poetry was made in 1890 by her personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, though they heavily edited the content. A complete collection of her poetry first became available in 1955 when scholar Thomas H. Johnson published &quot;The Poems of Emily Dickinson&quot;. In 1998, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on a study in which infrared technology revealed that certain poems of Dickinson&#x27;s had been deliberately censored to exclude the name &quot;Susan&quot;. At least eleven of Dickinson&#x27;s poems were dedicated to her sister-in-law Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson, and all the dedications were later obliterated, presumably by Todd. This censorship serves to obscure the nature of Emily and Susan&#x27;s relationship, which many scholars have interpreted as romantic.

== Life ==

=== Family and early childhood ===

Emily Elizabeth Dickinson was born at the family&#x27;s homestead in Amherst, Massachusetts, on December 10, 1830, into a prominent, but not wealthy, family. Her father, Edward Dickinson, was a lawyer in Amherst and a trustee of Amherst College.

Two hundred years earlier, her patrilineal ancestors had arrived in the New World—in the Puritan Great Migration—where they prospered. Emily Dickinson&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Samuel Dickinson, was one of the founders of Amherst College. In 1813, he built the Homestead, a large mansion on the town&#x27;s main street, that became the focus of Dickinson family life for the better part of a century.

Samuel Dickinson&#x27;s eldest son, Edward, was treasurer of Amherst College from 1835 to 1873, served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives (1838–1839; 1873) and the Massachusetts Senate (1842–1843), and represented Massachusetts&#x27;s 10th congressional district in the 33rd U.S. Congress (1853–1855). On May 6, 1828, he married Emily Norcross from Monson, Massachusetts. They had three children:
* William Austin (1829–1895), known as Austin, Aust or Awe
* Emily Elizabeth
* Lavinia Norcross (1833–1899), known as Lavinia or Vinnie

She was also a distant cousin to Baxter Dickinson and his family, including his grandson, the organist and composer Clarence Dickinson.

By all accounts, young Dickinson was a well-behaved girl. On an extended visit to Monson when she was two, Dickinson&#x27;s Aunt Lavinia described her as &quot;perfectly well and contented—She is a very good child and but little trouble.&quot; Dickinson&#x27;s aunt also noted the girl&#x27;s affinity for music and her particular talent for the piano, which she called &quot;the &quot;moosic&quot;&quot;.

Dickinson attended primary school in a two-story building on Pleasant Street. Her education was &quot;ambitiously classical for a Victorian girl&quot;. Wanting his children to be well-educated, her father followed their progress even while away on business. When Dickinson was seven, he wrote home, reminding his children to &quot;keep school, and learn, so as to tell me, when I come home, how many new things you have learned&quot;.

While Dickinson consistently described her father warmly, her correspondence suggests that her mother was regularly cold and aloof. In a letter to a confidante, Dickinson wrote she &quot;always ran Home to Awe [Austin] when a child, if anything befell me. She was an awful Mother, but I liked her better than none.&quot;

On September 7, 1840, Dickinson and her sister Lavinia started together at Amherst Academy, a former boys&#x27; school that had opened to female students just two years earlier. At about the same time, her father purchased a house on North Pleasant Street. Dickinson&#x27;s brother Austin later described this large new home as the &quot;mansion&quot; over which he and Dickinson presided as &quot;lord and lady&quot; while their parents were absent. The house overlooked Amherst&#x27;s burial ground, described by one local minister as treeless and &quot;forbidding&quot;.

=== Teenage years ===
Dickinson spent seven years at the academy, taking classes in English and classical literature, Latin, botany, geology, history, &quot;mental philosophy,&quot; and arithmetic. Daniel Taggart Fiske, the school&#x27;s principal at the time, would later recall that Dickinson was &quot;very bright&quot; and &quot;an excellent scholar, of exemplary deportment, faithful in all school duties&quot;. Although she took a few terms off due to illness—the longest of which was in 1845–1846, when she was enrolled for only eleven weeks—she enjoyed her strenuous studies, writing to a friend that the academy was &quot;a very fine school&quot;.

Dickinson was troubled from a young age by the &quot;deepening menace&quot; of death, especially the deaths of those who were close to her. When Sophia Holland, her second cousin and a close friend, grew ill from typhus and died in April 1844, Dickinson was traumatized. Recalling the incident two years later, she wrote that &quot;it seemed to me I should die too if I could not be permitted to watch over her or even look at her face.&quot; She became so melancholic that her parents sent her to stay with family in Boston to recover. With her health and spirits restored, she soon returned to Amherst Academy to continue her studies. During this period, she met people who were to become lifelong friends and correspondents, such as Abiah Root, Abby Wood, Jane Humphrey, and Susan Huntington Gilbert (who later married Dickinson&#x27;s brother Austin).

In 1845, a religious revival took place in Amherst, resulting in 46 confessions of faith among Dickinson&#x27;s peers. Dickinson wrote to a friend the following year: &quot;I never enjoyed such perfect peace and happiness as the short time in which I felt I had found my Savior.&quot; She went on to say it was her &quot;greatest pleasure to commune alone with the great God &amp; to feel that he would listen to my prayers.&quot; The experience did not last: Dickinson never made a formal declaration of faith and attended services regularly for only a few years. After her church-going ended, about 1852, she wrote a poem opening: &quot;Some keep the Sabbath going to Church – I keep it, staying at Home&quot;.

During the last year of her stay at the academy, Dickinson became friendly with Leonard Humphrey, its popular new young principal. After finishing her final term at the Academy on August 10, 1847, Dickinson began attending Mary Lyon&#x27;s Mount Holyoke Female Seminary (which later became Mount Holyoke College) in South Hadley, about from Amherst. She stayed at the seminary for only ten months. Although she liked the girls at Mount Holyoke, Dickinson made no lasting friendships there. The explanations for her brief stay at Mount Holyoke differ considerably: either she was in poor health, her father wanted to have her at home, she rebelled against the evangelical fervor present at the school, she disliked the discipline-minded teachers, or she was simply homesick. Whatever the reasons for leaving Mount Holyoke, her brother Austin appeared on March 25, 1848, to &quot;bring [her] home at all events&quot;. Back in Amherst, Dickinson occupied her time with household activities. She took up baking for the family and enjoyed attending local events and activities in the budding college town.

=== Early influences and writing ===
When she was eighteen, Dickinson&#x27;s family befriended a young attorney by the name of Benjamin Franklin Newton. According to a letter written by Dickinson after Newton&#x27;s death, he had been &quot;with my Father two years, before going to Worcester – in pursuing his studies, and was much in our family&quot;. Although their relationship was probably not romantic, Newton was a formative influence and would become the second in a series of older men (after Humphrey) that Dickinson referred to, variously, as her tutor, preceptor, or master.

Newton likely introduced her to the writings of William Wordsworth, and his gift to her of Ralph Waldo Emerson&#x27;s first book of collected poems had a liberating effect. She wrote later that he, &quot;whose name my Father&#x27;s Law Student taught me, has touched the secret Spring&quot;. Newton held her in high regard, believing in and recognizing her as a poet. When he was dying of tuberculosis, he wrote to her, saying he would like to live until she achieved the greatness he foresaw. Biographers believe that Dickinson&#x27;s statement of 1862—&quot;When a little Girl, I had a friend, who taught me Immortality – but venturing too near, himself – he never returned&quot;—refers to Newton.

Dickinson was familiar with not only the Bible but also contemporary popular literature. She was probably influenced by Lydia Maria Child&#x27;s &quot;Letters from New York&quot;, another gift from Newton (after reading it, she gushed &quot;This then is a book! And there are more of them!&quot;). Her brother smuggled a copy of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;Kavanagh&quot; into the house for her (because her father might disapprove) and a friend lent her Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; in late 1849. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;″s influence cannot be measured, but when Dickinson acquired her first and only dog, a Newfoundland, she named him &quot;Carlo&quot; after the character St. John Rivers&#x27; dog. William Shakespeare was also a potent influence in her life. Referring to his plays, she wrote to one friend, &quot;Why clasp any hand but this?&quot; and to another, &quot;Why is any other book needed?&quot;

=== Adulthood and seclusion ===
In early 1850, Dickinson wrote, &quot;Amherst is alive with fun this winter ... Oh, a very great town this is!&quot; Her high spirits soon turned to melancholy after another death. The Amherst Academy principal, Leonard Humphrey, died suddenly of &quot;brain congestion&quot; at age 25. Two years after his death, she revealed to her friend Abiah Root the extent of her sadness:... some of my friends are gone, and some of my friends are sleeping – sleeping the churchyard sleep – the hour of evening is sad – it was once my study hour – my master has gone to rest, and the open leaf of the book, and the scholar at school &quot;alone&quot;, make the tears come, and I cannot brush them away; I would not if I could, for they are the only tribute I can pay the departed Humphrey.
During the 1850s, Dickinson&#x27;s strongest and most affectionate relationship was with her sister-in-law, Susan Gilbert. Dickinson eventually sent her over three hundred letters, more than to any other correspondent, over the course of their relationship. Susan was supportive of the poet, playing the role of &quot;most beloved friend, influence, muse, and adviser&quot; whose editorial suggestions Dickinson sometimes followed. In an 1882 letter to Susan, Dickinson said, &quot;With the exception of Shakespeare, you have told me of more knowledge than any one living.&quot;

The importance of Dickinson&#x27;s relationship with Susan Gilbert has widely been overlooked due to a point of view first promoted by Mabel Loomis Todd, who was involved for many years in a relationship with Austin Dickinson and who diminished Gilbert&#x27;s role in Dickinson&#x27;s life due to her own poor relationship with her lover&#x27;s wife. However, the notion of a &quot;cruel&quot; Susan—as promoted by her romantic rival—has been questioned, most especially by Dickinson&#x27;s nieces and nephews (Susan and Austin&#x27;s surviving children), with whom Dickinson was close. Many scholars interpret the relationship between Emily and Susan as a romantic one. In &quot;The Emily Dickinson Journal&quot; Lena Koski wrote, &quot;Dickinson&#x27;s letters to Gilbert express strong homoerotic feelings.&quot; She quotes from many of their letters, including one from 1852 in which Dickinson proclaims, Susie, will you indeed come home next Saturday, and be my own again, and kiss me as you used to? (...) I hope for you so much and feel so eager for you, feel that I cannot wait, feel that now I must have you—that the expectation once more to see your face again, makes me feel hot and feverish, and my heart beats so fast ( ... ) my darling, so near I seem to you, that I disdain this pen, and wait for a warmer language.The relationship between Emily and Susan is portrayed in the film &quot;Wild Nights with Emily&quot; and explored in the TV series &quot;Dickinson&quot;.

Susan Gilbert married Austin in 1856 after a four-year courtship, though their marriage was not a happy one. Edward Dickinson built a house for Austin which Gilbert named the Evergreens, a stand of which was located on the west side of the Homestead.

Until 1855, Dickinson had not strayed far from Amherst. That spring, accompanied by her mother and sister, she took one of her longest and farthest trips away from home. First, they spent three weeks in Washington, where her father was representing Massachusetts in Congress, after which they would travel to Philadelphia for two weeks to visit family. While in Philadelphia, she met Charles Wadsworth, a famous minister of the Arch Street Presbyterian Church, with whom she forged a strong friendship that lasted until he died in 1882. Despite seeing him only twice after 1855 (he moved to San Francisco in 1862), she variously referred to him as &quot;my Philadelphia&quot;, &quot;my Clergyman&quot;, &quot;my dearest earthly friend&quot; and &quot;my Shepherd from &#x27;Little Girl&#x27;hood&quot;.

From the mid-1850s, Dickinson&#x27;s mother became effectively bedridden with various chronic illnesses until she died in 1882. Writing to a friend in the summer of 1858, Dickinson said she would visit if she could leave &quot;home, or mother. I do not go out at all, lest father will come and miss me, or miss some little act, which I might forget, should I run away – Mother is much as usual. I Know not what to hope of her&quot;. As her mother continued to decline, Dickinson&#x27;s domestic responsibilities weighed more heavily upon her and she confined herself within the Homestead. Forty years later, Lavinia said that because their mother was chronically ill, one of the daughters had to remain always with her. Dickinson took this role as her own, and &quot;finding the life with her books and nature so congenial, continued to live it&quot;.

Withdrawing more and more from the outside world, Dickinson began in the summer of 1858 what would be her lasting legacy. Reviewing poems she had written previously, she began making clean copies of her work, assembling carefully pieced-together manuscript books. The forty she created from 1858 through 1865 eventually held nearly eight hundred poems. No one was aware of the existence of these books until after her death.

In the late 1850s, the Dickinsons befriended Samuel Bowles, the owner and editor-in-chief of the &quot;Springfield Republican&quot;, and his wife Mary. They visited the Dickinsons regularly for years to come. During this time Dickinson sent him over three dozen letters and nearly fifty poems. Their friendship brought out some of her most intense writing and Bowles published a few of her poems in his journal. It was from 1858 to 1861 that Dickinson is believed to have written a trio of letters that have been called &quot;The Master Letters&quot;. These three letters, drafted to an unknown man simply referred to as &quot;Master&quot;, continue to be the subject of speculation and contention amongst scholars. 
Dickinson also became friends with &quot;Springfield Republican&quot; Assistant Editor J. G. Holland and his wife and frequently corresponded with them. She was a guest at their Springfield home on numerous occasions. Dickinson sent more than ninety letters to the Hollands between 1853 and 1886 in which she shares &quot;the details of life that one would impart to a close family member: the status of the garden, the health and activities of members of the household, references to recently-read books.&quot;

Dickinson was a poet &quot;influenced by transcendentalism and dark romanticism,&quot; and her work bridged &quot;the gap to Realism.&quot; Of the ten poems published in her lifetime, the &quot;Springfield Republican&quot; published five (all unsigned), with Sam Bowles and Josiah Holland as editors, between 1852 and 1866. Some scholars believe that Bowles promoted her the most; Dickinson wrote letters and sent her poems to both men. Later, as editor of Scribner&#x27;s Monthly beginning in 1870, Holland told Dickinson&#x27;s childhood friend Emily Fowler Ford that he had &quot;some poems of [Dickinson&#x27;s] under consideration for publication [in Scribner&#x27;s Monthly]—but they really are not suitable—they are too ethereal.&quot;

The first half of the 1860s, after she had largely withdrawn from social life, proved to be Dickinson&#x27;s most productive writing period. Modern scholars and researchers are divided as to the cause for Dickinson&#x27;s withdrawal and extreme seclusion. While she was diagnosed as having &quot;nervous prostration&quot; by a physician during her lifetime, some today believe she may have suffered from illnesses as various as agoraphobia and epilepsy. Julie Brown, writing in &quot;Writers on the Spectrum&quot; (2010), argues that Dickinson had Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), but this is generally regarded as being more speculation than a retrospective diagnosis, and although the theory has been echoed on the internet especially, it has not been advanced by Dickinson scholars.

=== Is &quot;my Verse ... alive?&quot; ===
In April 1862, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, a literary critic, radical abolitionist, and ex-minister, wrote a lead piece for &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; titled, &quot;Letter to a Young Contributor&quot;. Higginson&#x27;s essay, in which he urged aspiring writers to &quot;charge your style with life&quot;, contained practical advice for those wishing to break into print. Dickinson&#x27;s decision to contact Higginson suggests that by 1862 she was contemplating publication and that it may have become increasingly difficult to write poetry without an audience. Seeking literary guidance that no one close to her could provide, Dickinson sent him a letter, which read in full:


This highly nuanced and largely theatrical letter was unsigned, but she had included her name on a card and enclosed it in an envelope, along with four of her poems. He praised her work but suggested that she delay publishing until she had written longer, being unaware she had already appeared in print. She assured him that publishing was as foreign to her &quot;as Firmament to Fin&quot;, but also proposed that &quot;If fame belonged to me, I could not escape her&quot;. Dickinson delighted in dramatic self-characterization and mystery in her letters to Higginson. She said of herself, &quot;I am small, like the wren, and my hair is bold, like the chestnut bur, and my eyes like the sherry in the glass that the guest leaves.&quot; She stressed her solitary nature, saying her only real companions were the hills, the sundown, and her dog, Carlo. She also mentioned that whereas her mother did not &quot;care for Thought&quot;, her father bought her books, but begged her &quot;not to read them – because he fears they joggle the Mind&quot;.

Dickinson valued his advice, going from calling him &quot;Mr. Higginson&quot; to &quot;Dear friend&quot; as well as signing her letters, &quot;Your Gnome&quot; and &quot;Your Scholar&quot;. His interest in her work certainly provided great moral support; many years later, Dickinson told Higginson that he had saved her life in 1862. They corresponded until her death, but her difficulty in expressing her literary needs and a reluctance to enter into a cooperative exchange left Higginson nonplussed; he did not press her to publish in subsequent correspondence. Dickinson&#x27;s own ambivalence on the matter militated against the likelihood of publication. Literary critic Edmund Wilson, in his review of Civil War literature, surmised that &quot;with encouragement, she would certainly have published&quot;.

=== The woman in white ===
In direct opposition to the immense productivity that she displayed in the early 1860s, Dickinson wrote fewer poems in 1866. Beset with personal loss as well as loss of domestic help, Dickinson may have been too overcome to keep up her previous level of writing. Carlo died during this time after having provided sixteen years of companionship; Dickinson never owned another dog. Although the household servant of nine years, Margaret O&#x27;Brien, had married and left the Homestead that same year, it was not until 1869 that the Dickinsons brought in another permanent household servant, Margaret Maher, to replace their former maid-of-all-work. Emily once again was responsible for the kitchen, including cooking and cleaning up, as well as the baking at which she excelled.
Around this time, Dickinson&#x27;s behavior began to change. She did not leave the Homestead unless it was absolutely necessary, and as early as 1867, she began to talk to visitors from the other side of a door rather than speaking to them face to face. She acquired local notoriety; she was rarely seen, and when she was, she was usually clothed in white. Dickinson&#x27;s one surviving article of clothing is a white cotton dress, possibly sewn circa 1878–1882. Few of the locals who exchanged messages with Dickinson during her last fifteen years ever saw her in person. Austin and his family began to protect Dickinson&#x27;s privacy, deciding that she was not to be a subject of discussion with outsiders.

Despite her physical seclusion, Dickinson was socially active and expressive through what makes up two-thirds of her surviving notes and letters. When visitors came to either the Homestead or the Evergreens, she would often leave or send over small gifts of poems or flowers. Dickinson also had a good rapport with the children in her life. Mattie Dickinson, the second child of Austin and Susan, later said that &quot;Aunt Emily stood for &quot;indulgence.&quot;&quot; MacGregor (Mac) Jenkins, the son of family friends who later wrote a short article in 1891 called &quot;A Child&#x27;s Recollection of Emily Dickinson&quot;, thought of her as always offering support to the neighborhood children.

When Higginson urged her to come to Boston in 1868 so they could formally meet for the first time, she declined, writing: &quot;Could it please your convenience to come so far as Amherst I should be very glad, but I do not cross my Father&#x27;s ground to any House or town&quot;. It was not until he came to Amherst in 1870 that they met. Later he referred to her, in the most detailed and vivid physical account of her on record, as &quot;a little plain woman with two smooth bands of reddish hair ... in a very plain &amp; exquisitely clean white piqué &amp; a blue net worsted shawl.&quot; He also felt that he never was &quot;with any one who drained my nerve power so much. Without touching her, she drew from me. I am glad not to live near her.&quot;

=== Posies and poesies ===
Scholar Judith Farr notes that Dickinson, during her lifetime, &quot;was known more widely as a gardener, perhaps, than as a poet&quot;. Dickinson studied botany from the age of nine and, along with her sister, tended the garden at Homestead. During her lifetime, she assembled a collection of pressed plants in a sixty-six-page leather-bound herbarium. It contained 424 pressed flower specimens that she collected, classified, and labeled using the Linnaean system. The Homestead garden was well known and admired locally in its time. It has not survived, but efforts to revive it have begun. Dickinson kept no garden notebooks or plant lists, but a clear impression can be formed from the letters and recollections of friends and family. Her niece, Martha Dickinson Bianchi, remembered &quot;carpets of lily-of-the-valley and pansies, platoons of sweetpeas, hyacinths, enough in May to give all the bees of summer dyspepsia. There were ribbons of peony hedges and drifts of daffodils in season, marigolds to distraction—a butterfly utopia&quot;. In particular, Dickinson cultivated scented exotic flowers, writing that she &quot;could inhabit the Spice Isles merely by crossing the dining room to the conservatory, where the plants hang in baskets&quot;. Dickinson would often send her friends bunches of flowers with verses attached, but &quot;they valued the posy more than the poetry&quot;.

=== Later life ===
On June 16, 1874, while in Boston, Edward Dickinson suffered a stroke and died. When the simple funeral was held in the Homestead&#x27;s entrance hall, Dickinson stayed in her room with the door cracked open; she didn&#x27;t attend the memorial service on June 28. She wrote to Higginson that her father&#x27;s &quot;Heart was pure and terrible and I think no other like it exists.&quot; A year later, on June 15, 1875, Dickinson&#x27;s mother also suffered a stroke, which produced a partial lateral paralysis and impaired memory. Lamenting her mother&#x27;s increasing physical as well as mental demands, Dickinson wrote that &quot;Home is so far from Home&quot;.
Otis Phillips Lord, an elderly judge on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court from Salem, in 1872 or 1873 became an acquaintance of Dickinson&#x27;s. After the death of Lord&#x27;s wife in 1877, his friendship with Dickinson probably became a late-life romance, though as their letters were destroyed, this is surmised. Dickinson found a kindred soul in Lord, especially in terms of shared literary interests; the few letters that survived contain multiple quotations of Shakespeare&#x27;s work, including the plays &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;King Lear&quot;. In 1880 he gave her Mary Cowden Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Complete Concordance to Shakespeare&quot; (1877). Dickinson wrote, &quot;While others go to Church, I go to mine, for are you not my Church, and have we not a Hymn that no one knows but us?&quot; She referred to him as &quot;My lovely Salem&quot; and they wrote to each other religiously every Sunday. Dickinson looked forward to this day greatly; a surviving fragment of a letter written by her states that &quot;Tuesday is a deeply depressed Day&quot;.

After being critically ill for several years, Judge Lord died in March 1884. Dickinson referred to him as &quot;our latest Lost&quot;. Two years before this, on April 1, 1882, Dickinson&#x27;s &quot;Shepherd from &#x27;Little Girl&#x27;hood&quot;, Charles Wadsworth, also had died after a long illness.

=== Decline and death ===
Although she continued to write in her last years, Dickinson stopped editing and organizing her poems. She also exacted a promise from her sister Lavinia to burn her papers. Lavinia, who never married, remained at the Homestead until her own death in 1899.
The 1880s were a difficult time for the remaining Dickinsons. Irreconcilably alienated from his wife, Austin fell in love in 1882 with Mabel Loomis Todd, an Amherst College faculty wife who had recently moved to the area. Todd never met Dickinson but was intrigued by her, referring to her as &quot;a lady whom the people call the &quot;Myth&quot;&quot;. Austin distanced himself from his family as his affair continued and his wife became sick with grief. Dickinson&#x27;s mother died on November 14, 1882. Five weeks later, Dickinson wrote, &quot;We were never intimate ... while she was our Mother – but Mines in the same Ground meet by tunneling and when she became our Child, the Affection came.&quot; The next year, Austin and Susan&#x27;s third and youngest child, Gilbert—Emily&#x27;s favorite—died of typhoid fever.

As death succeeded death, Dickinson found her world upended. In the fall of 1884, she wrote, &quot;The Dyings have been too deep for me, and before I could raise my Heart from one, another has come.&quot; That summer, she had seen &quot;a great darkness coming&quot; and fainted while baking in the kitchen. She remained unconscious late into the night and weeks of ill health followed. On November 30, 1885, her feebleness and other symptoms were so worrying that Austin canceled a trip to Boston. She was confined to her bed for a few months, but managed to send a final burst of letters in the spring. What is thought to be her last letter was sent to her cousins, Louise and Frances Norcross, and simply read: &quot;Little Cousins, Called Back. Emily&quot;. On May 15, 1886, after several days of worsening symptoms, Dickinson died at the age of 55. Austin wrote in his diary that &quot;the day was awful ... she ceased to breathe that terrible breathing just before the [afternoon] whistle sounded for six.&quot; Dickinson&#x27;s chief physician gave the cause of death as Bright&#x27;s disease and its duration as two and a half years.

Lavinia and Austin asked Susan to wash Dickinson&#x27;s body upon her death. Susan also wrote Dickinson&#x27;s obituary for the &quot;Springfield Republican&quot;, ending it with four lines from one of Dickinson&#x27;s poems: &quot;Morns like these, we parted; Noons like these, she rose; Fluttering first, then firmer, To her fair repose.&quot; Lavinia was perfectly satisfied that Susan should arrange everything, knowing it would be done lovingly. Dickinson was buried, laid in a white coffin with vanilla-scented heliotrope, a lady&#x27;s slipper orchid, and a &quot;knot of blue field violets&quot; placed about it. The funeral service, held in the Homestead&#x27;s library, was simple and short; Higginson, who had met her only twice, read &quot;No Coward Soul Is Mine&quot;, a poem by Emily Brontë that had been a favorite of Dickinson&#x27;s. At Dickinson&#x27;s request, her &quot;coffin [was] not driven but carried through fields of buttercups&quot; for burial in the family plot at West Cemetery on Triangle Street.

== Publication ==
Despite Dickinson&#x27;s prolific writing, only ten poems and a letter were published during her lifetime. After her younger sister Lavinia discovered the collection of nearly 1,800 poems, Dickinson&#x27;s first volume was published four years after her death. Until Thomas H. Johnson published Dickinson&#x27;s &quot;Complete Poems&quot; in 1955, Dickinson&#x27;s poems were considerably edited and altered from their manuscript versions. Since 1890 Dickinson has remained continuously in print.

=== Contemporary ===

A few of Dickinson&#x27;s poems appeared in Samuel Bowles&#x27; &quot;Springfield Republican&quot; between 1858 and 1868. They were published anonymously and heavily edited, with conventionalized punctuation and formal titles. The first poem, &quot;Nobody knows this little rose&quot;, may have been published without Dickinson&#x27;s permission. The &quot;Republican&quot; also published &quot;A Narrow Fellow in the Grass&quot; as &quot;The Snake&quot;, &quot;Safe in their Alabaster Chambers –&quot; as &quot;The Sleeping&quot;, and &quot;Blazing in the Gold and quenching in Purple&quot; as &quot;Sunset&quot;. The poem &quot;I taste a liquor never brewed –&quot; is an example of the edited versions; the last two lines in the first stanza were completely rewritten.

In 1864, several poems were altered and published in &quot;Drum Beat&quot;, to raise funds for medical care for Union soldiers in the war. Another appeared in April 1864 in the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Union&quot;.

In the 1870s, Higginson showed Dickinson&#x27;s poems to Helen Hunt Jackson, who had coincidentally been at the academy with Dickinson when they were girls. Jackson was deeply involved in the publishing world, and managed to convince Dickinson to publish her poem &quot;Success is counted sweetest&quot; anonymously in a volume called &quot;A Masque of Poets&quot;. The poem, however, was altered to agree with contemporary taste. It was the last poem published during Dickinson&#x27;s lifetime.

=== Posthumous ===
After Dickinson&#x27;s death, Lavinia Dickinson kept her promise and burned most of the poet&#x27;s correspondence. Significantly though, Dickinson had left no instructions about the 40 notebooks and loose sheets gathered in a locked chest. Lavinia recognized the poems&#x27; worth and became obsessed with seeing them published. She turned first to her brother&#x27;s wife and then to Mabel Loomis Todd, his lover, for assistance. A feud ensued, with the manuscripts divided between the Todd and Dickinson houses, preventing the complete publication of Dickinson&#x27;s poetry for more than half a century.
The first volume of Dickinson&#x27;s &quot;Poems,&quot; edited jointly by Mabel Loomis Todd and T. W. Higginson, appeared in November 1890. Although Todd claimed that only essential changes were made, the poems were extensively edited to match punctuation and capitalization to late 19th-century standards, with occasional rewordings to reduce Dickinson&#x27;s obliquity. The first 115-poem volume was a critical and financial success, going through eleven printings in two years. &quot;Poems: Second Series&quot; followed in 1891, running to five editions by 1893; a third series appeared in 1896. One reviewer, in 1892, wrote: &quot;The world will not rest satisfied till every scrap of her writings, letters as well as literature, has been published&quot;.

Nearly a dozen new editions of Dickinson&#x27;s poetry, whether containing previously unpublished or newly edited poems, were published between 1914 and 1945. Martha Dickinson Bianchi, the daughter of Susan and Austin Dickinson, published collections of her aunt&#x27;s poetry based on the manuscripts held by her family, whereas Mabel Loomis Todd&#x27;s daughter, Millicent Todd Bingham, published collections based on the manuscripts held by her mother. These competing editions of Dickinson&#x27;s poetry, often differing in order and structure, ensured that the poet&#x27;s work was in the public&#x27;s eye.

The first scholarly publication came in 1955 with a completely new three-volume set edited by Thomas H. Johnson. Forming the basis of later Dickinson scholarship, Johnson&#x27;s variorum brought all of Dickinson&#x27;s known poems together for the first time. Johnson&#x27;s goal was to present the poems very nearly as Dickinson had left them in her manuscripts. They were untitled, only numbered in an approximate chronological sequence, strewn with dashes and irregularly capitalized, and often extremely in their language. Three years later, Johnson edited and published, along with Theodora Ward, a complete collection of Dickinson&#x27;s letters, also presented in three volumes.

In 1981, &quot;The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson&quot; was published. Using the physical evidence of the original papers, the poems were intended to be published in their original order for the first time. Editor Ralph W. Franklin relied on smudge marks, needle punctures and other clues to reassemble the poet&#x27;s packets. Since then, many critics have argued for thematic unity in these small collections, believing the ordering of the poems to be more than chronological or convenient.

Dickinson biographer Alfred Habegger wrote in &quot;My Wars Are Laid Away in Books: The Life of Emily Dickinson&quot; (2001) that &quot;The consequences of the poet&#x27;s failure to disseminate her work in a faithful and orderly manner are still very much with us&quot;.

== Poetry ==
Dickinson&#x27;s poems generally fall into three distinct periods, the works in each period having certain general characters in common.
* Pre-1861: In the period before 1858, the poems are most often conventional and sentimental in nature. Thomas H. Johnson, who later published &quot;The Poems of Emily Dickinson&quot;, was able to date only five of Dickinson&#x27;s poems as written before 1858. Two of these are mock valentines done in an ornate and humorous style, two others are conventional lyrics, one of which is about missing her brother Austin, and the fifth poem, which begins &quot;I have a Bird in spring&quot;, conveys her grief over the feared loss of friendship and was sent to her friend Susan Gilbert. In 1858, Dickinson began to collect her poems in the small hand-sewn books she called fascicles.
* 1861–1865: This was her most creative period, and these poems represent her most vigorous and creative work. Her poetic production also increased dramatically during this period. Johnson estimated that she composed 35 poems in 1860, 86 poems in 1861, 366 in 1862, 141 in 1863, and 174 in 1864. It was during this period that Dickinson fully developed her themes concerning nature, life, and mortality.
* Post-1866: Only a third of Dickinson&#x27;s poems were written in the last twenty years of her life, when her poetic production slowed considerably. During this period, she no longer collected her poems in fascicles.

=== Structure and syntax ===

The extensive use of dashes and unconventional capitalization in Dickinson&#x27;s manuscripts, and the idiosyncratic vocabulary and imagery, combine to create a body of work that is &quot;far more various in its styles and forms than is commonly supposed&quot;. Dickinson avoids pentameter, opting more generally for trimeter, tetrameter and, less often, dimeter. Sometimes her use of these meters is regular, but oftentimes it is irregular. The regular form that she most often employs is the ballad stanza, a traditional form that is divided into quatrains, using tetrameter for the first and third lines and trimeter for the second and fourth, while rhyming the second and fourth lines (ABCB). Though Dickinson often uses perfect rhymes for lines two and four, she also makes frequent use of slant rhyme. In some of her poems, she varies the meter from the traditional ballad stanza by using trimeter for lines one, two and four; while using tetrameter for only line three.

Since many of her poems were written in traditional ballad stanzas with ABCB rhyme schemes, some of these poems can be sung to fit the melodies of popular folk songs and hymns that also use the common meter, employing alternating lines of iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter.

Dickinson scholar and poet Anthony Hecht finds resonances in Dickinson&#x27;s poetry not only with hymns and song forms but also with psalms and riddles, citing the following example: &quot;Who is the East? / The Yellow Man / Who may be Purple if he can / That carries in the Sun. / Who is the West? / The Purple Man / Who may be Yellow if He can / That lets Him out again.&quot;

Late 20th-century scholars are &quot;deeply interested&quot; in Dickinson&#x27;s highly individual use of punctuation and lineation (line lengths and line breaks). Following the publication of one of the few poems that appeared in her lifetime—&quot;A Narrow Fellow in the Grass&quot;, published as &quot;The Snake&quot; in &quot;The Republican&quot;—Dickinson complained that the edited punctuation (an added comma and a full stop substitution for the original dash) altered the meaning of the entire poem.

As Farr points out, &quot;snakes instantly notice you&quot;; Dickinson&#x27;s version captures the &quot;breathless immediacy&quot; of the encounter; and &quot;The Republican&quot;″s punctuation renders &quot;her lines more commonplace&quot;. With the increasingly close focus on Dickinson&#x27;s structures and syntax has come a growing appreciation that they are &quot;aesthetically based&quot;. Although Johnson&#x27;s landmark 1955 edition of poems was relatively unaltered from the original, later scholars critiqued it for deviating from the style and layout of Dickinson&#x27;s manuscripts. Meaningful distinctions, these scholars assert, can be drawn from varying lengths and angles of dash, and differing arrangements of text on the page. Several volumes have attempted to render Dickinson&#x27;s handwritten dashes using many typographic symbols of varying length and angle. R. W. Franklin&#x27;s 1998 variorum edition of the poems provided alternate wordings to those chosen by Johnson, in a more limited editorial intervention. Franklin also used typeset dashes of varying length to approximate the manuscripts&#x27; dashes more closely.

=== Major themes ===
Dickinson left no formal statement of her aesthetic intentions and, because of the variety of her themes, her work does not fit conveniently into any genre. She has been regarded, alongside Emerson (whose poems Dickinson admired), as a Transcendentalist. However, Farr disagrees with this analysis, saying that Dickinson&#x27;s &quot;relentlessly measuring mind ... deflates the airy elevation of the Transcendental&quot;. Apart from the major themes discussed below, Dickinson&#x27;s poetry frequently uses humor, puns, irony and satire.

Flowers and gardens: Farr notes that Dickinson&#x27;s &quot;poems and letters almost wholly concern flowers&quot; and that allusions to gardens often refer to an &quot;imaginative realm ... wherein flowers [are] often emblems for actions and emotions&quot;. She associates some flowers, like gentians and anemones, with youth and humility; others with prudence and insight. Her poems were often sent to friends with accompanying letters and nosegays. Farr notes that one of Dickinson&#x27;s earlier poems, written about 1859, appears to &quot;conflate her poetry itself with the posies&quot;: &quot;My nosegays are for Captives – / Dim – long expectant eyes – / Fingers denied the plucking, / Patient till Paradise – / To such, if they sh&#x27;d whisper / Of morning and the moor – / They bear no other errand, / And I, no other prayer&quot;.

The Master poems: Dickinson left a large number of poems addressed to &quot;Signor&quot;, &quot;Sir&quot; and &quot;Master&quot;, who is characterized as Dickinson&#x27;s &quot;lover for all eternity&quot;. These confessional poems are often &quot;searing in their self-inquiry&quot; and &quot;harrowing to the reader&quot; and typically take their metaphors from texts and paintings of Dickinson&#x27;s day. The Dickinson family themselves believed these poems were addressed to actual individuals; scholars frequently reject this view. Farr, for example, contends that the Master is an unattainable composite figure, &quot;human, with specific characteristics, but godlike&quot; and speculates that Master may be a &quot;kind of Christian muse&quot;.

Morbidity: Dickinson&#x27;s poems reflect her &quot;early and lifelong fascination&quot; with illness, dying and death. Perhaps surprisingly for a New England spinster, her poems allude to death by many methods: &quot;crucifixion, drowning, hanging, suffocation, freezing, premature burial, shooting, stabbing and guillotinage&quot;. She reserved her sharpest insights into the &quot;death blow aimed by God&quot; and the &quot;funeral in the brain&quot;, often reinforced by images of thirst and starvation. Dickinson scholar considers these references an autobiographical reflection of Dickinson&#x27;s &quot;thirsting-starving persona&quot;, an outward expression of her needy self-image as small, thin and frail. Dickinson&#x27;s most psychologically complex poems explore the theme that the loss of hunger for life causes the death of self and place this at &quot;the interface of murder and suicide&quot;. Death and morbidity in Dickinson&#x27;s poetry is also heavily connected to winter themes. Critic Edwin Folsom analyzes how &quot;winter for Dickinson is the season that forces reality, that strips all hope of transcendence. It is a season of death and a metaphor for death&quot;.

Gospel poems: Throughout her life, Dickinson wrote poems reflecting a preoccupation with the teachings of Jesus Christ and, indeed, many are addressed to him. She stresses the Gospels&#x27; contemporary pertinence and recreates them, often with &quot;wit and American colloquial language&quot;. Scholar Dorothy Oberhaus finds that the &quot;salient feature uniting Christian poets ... is their reverential attention to the life of Jesus Christ&quot; and contends that Dickinson&#x27;s deep structures place her in the &quot;poetic tradition of Christian devotion&quot; alongside Hopkins, Eliot and Auden. In a Nativity poem, Dickinson combines lightness and wit to revisit an ancient theme: &quot;The Savior must have been / A docile Gentleman – / To come so far so cold a Day / For little Fellowmen / The Road to Bethlehem / Since He and I were Boys / Was leveled, but for that twould be / A rugged billion Miles –&quot;.

The Undiscovered Continent: Academic considers that Dickinson saw the mind and spirit as tangible visitable places and that for much of her life she lived within them. Often, this intensely private place is referred to as the &quot;undiscovered continent&quot; and the &quot;landscape of the spirit&quot; and embellished with nature imagery. At other times, the imagery is darker and forbidding—castles or prisons, complete with corridors and rooms—to create a dwelling place of &quot;oneself&quot; where one resides with one&#x27;s other selves. An example that brings together many of these ideas is: &quot;Me from Myself – to banish – / Had I Art – / Impregnable my Fortress / Unto All Heart – / But since myself—assault Me – / How have I peace / Except by subjugating / Consciousness. / And since We&#x27;re mutual Monarch / How this be / Except by Abdication – / Me – of Me?&quot;.

=== Reception ===

The surge of posthumous publication gave Dickinson&#x27;s poetry its first public exposure. Backed by Higginson and with a favorable notice from William Dean Howells, an editor of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, the poetry received mixed reviews after it was first published in 1890. Higginson himself stated in his preface to the first edition of Dickinson&#x27;s published work that the poetry&#x27;s quality &quot;is that of extraordinary grasp and insight&quot;, albeit &quot;without the proper control and chastening&quot; that the experience of publishing during her lifetime might have conferred. His judgment that her opus was &quot;incomplete and unsatisfactory&quot; would be echoed in the essays of the New Critics in the 1930s.

Maurice Thompson, who was literary editor of &quot;The Independent&quot; for twelve years, noted in 1891 that her poetry had &quot;a strange mixture of rare individuality and originality&quot;. Some critics hailed Dickinson&#x27;s effort but disapproved of her unusual non-traditional style. Andrew Lang, a British writer, dismissed Dickinson&#x27;s work, stating that &quot;if poetry is to exist at all, it really must have form and grammar, and must rhyme when it professes to rhyme. The wisdom of the ages and the nature of man insist on so much&quot;. Thomas Bailey Aldrich, a poet and novelist, equally dismissed Dickinson&#x27;s poetic technique in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; in January 1892: &quot;It is plain that Miss Dickinson possessed an extremely unconventional and grotesque fancy. She was deeply tinged by the mysticism of Blake, and strongly influenced by the mannerism of Emerson ... But the incoherence and formlessness of her—versicles are fatal ... an eccentric, dreamy, half-educated recluse in an out-of-the-way New England village (or anywhere else) cannot with impunity set at defiance the laws of gravitation and grammar&quot;.

Critical attention to Dickinson&#x27;s poetry was meager from 1897 to the early 1920s. By the start of the 20th century, interest in her poetry became broader in scope and some critics began to consider Dickinson as essentially modern. Rather than seeing Dickinson&#x27;s poetic styling as a result of a lack of knowledge or skill, modern critics believed the irregularities were consciously artistic. In a 1915 essay, Elizabeth Shepley Sergeant called the poet&#x27;s inspiration &quot;daring&quot; and named her &quot;one of the rarest flowers the sterner New England land ever bore&quot;. With the growing popularity of modernist poetry in the 1920s, Dickinson&#x27;s failure to conform to 19th-century poetic form was no longer surprising nor distasteful to new generations of readers. Dickinson was suddenly referred to by various critics as a great woman poet, and a cult following began to form.

In the 1930s, a number of the New Critics—among them R. P. Blackmur, Allen Tate, Cleanth Brooks and Yvor Winters—appraised the significance of Dickinson&#x27;s poetry. As critic Roland Hagenbüchle pointed out, their &quot;affirmative and prohibitive tenets turned out to be of special relevance to Dickinson scholarship&quot;. Blackmur, in an attempt to focus and clarify the major claims for and against the poet&#x27;s greatness, wrote in a landmark 1937 critical essay: &quot;... she was a private poet who wrote as indefatigably as some women cook or knit. Her gift for words and the cultural predicament of her time drove her to poetry instead of antimacassars ... She came ... at the right time for one kind of poetry: the poetry of sophisticated, eccentric vision.&quot;

The second wave of feminism created greater cultural sympathy for her as a female poet. In the first collection of critical essays on Dickinson from a feminist perspective, she is heralded as the greatest woman poet in the English language. Biographers and theorists of the past tended to separate Dickinson&#x27;s roles as a woman and a poet. For example, George Whicher wrote in his 1952 book &quot;This Was a Poet: A Critical Biography of Emily Dickinson&quot;, &quot;Perhaps as a poet [Dickinson] could find the fulfillment she had missed as a woman.&quot; Feminist criticism, on the other hand, declares that there is a necessary and powerful conjunction between Dickinson being a woman and a poet. Adrienne Rich theorized in &quot;Vesuvius at Home: The Power of Emily Dickinson&quot; (1976) that Dickinson&#x27;s identity as a woman poet brought her power: &quot;[she] chose her seclusion, knowing she was exceptional and knowing what she needed ... She carefully selected her society and controlled the disposal of her time ... neither eccentric nor quaint; she was determined to survive, to use her powers, to practice necessary economics.&quot;

Some scholars question the poet&#x27;s sexuality, theorizing that the numerous letters and poems that were dedicated to Susan Gilbert Dickinson indicate a lesbian romance, and speculating about how this may have influenced her poetry. Critics such as John Cody, Lillian Faderman, Vivian R. Pollak, Paula Bennett, Judith Farr, Ellen Louise Hart, and Martha Nell Smith have argued that Susan was the central erotic relationship in Dickinson&#x27;s life.

=== Legacy ===
In the early 20th century, Martha Dickinson Bianchi and Millicent Todd Bingham kept the achievement of Emily Dickinson alive. Bianchi promoted Dickinson&#x27;s poetic achievement. Bianchi inherited The Evergreens as well as the copyright for her aunt&#x27;s poetry from her parents, publishing works such as &quot;Emily Dickinson Face to Face&quot; and &quot;Letters of Emily Dickinson&quot;, which stoked public curiosity about her aunt. Bianchi&#x27;s books perpetrated legends about her aunt in the context of family tradition, personal recollection and correspondence. In contrast, Millicent Todd Bingham&#x27;s took a more objective and realistic approach to the poet.

Emily Dickinson is now considered a powerful and persistent figure in American culture. Although much of the early reception concentrated on Dickinson&#x27;s eccentric and secluded nature, she has become widely acknowledged as an innovative, proto-modernist poet. As early as 1891, William Dean Howells wrote that &quot;If nothing else had come out of our life but this strange poetry, we should feel that in the work of Emily Dickinson, America, or New England rather, had made a distinctive addition to the literature of the world, and could not be left out of any record of it.&quot; Critic Harold Bloom has placed her alongside Walt Whitman, Wallace Stevens, Robert Frost, T. S. Eliot, and Hart Crane as a major American poet, and in 1994 listed her among the 26 central writers of Western civilization.

Dickinson is taught in American literature and poetry classes in the United States from middle school to college. Her poetry is frequently anthologized and has been used as text for art songs by composers such as Aaron Copland, Nick Peros, John Adams and Michael Tilson Thomas. Several schools have been established in her name; for example, Emily Dickinson Elementary Schools exist in Bozeman, Montana; Redmond, Washington; and New York City. A few literary journals—including &quot;The Emily Dickinson Journal&quot;, the official publication of the Emily Dickinson International Society—have been founded to examine her work. The Emily Dickinson International Society was founded in 1988, eight years after an Emily Dickinson Society was formed in Japan in 1980. An 8-cent commemorative stamp in honor of Dickinson, designed by Bernard Fuchs, was issued by the United States Postal Service on August 28, 1971, as the second stamp in the &quot;American Poet&quot; series. Dickinson was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1973. A one-woman play titled &quot;The Belle of Amherst&quot; appeared on Broadway in 1976, winning several awards; it was later adapted for television.

Dickinson&#x27;s herbarium, which is now held in the Houghton Library at Harvard University, was published in 2006 as &quot;Emily Dickinson&#x27;s Herbarium&quot; by Harvard University Press. The original work was compiled by Dickinson during her years at Amherst Academy, and consists of 424 pressed specimens of plants arranged on 66 pages of a bound album. A digital facsimile of the herbarium is available online. The town of Amherst Jones Library&#x27;s Special Collections department has an Emily Dickinson Collection consisting of approximately seven thousand items, including original manuscript poems and letters, family correspondence, scholarly articles and books, newspaper clippings, theses, plays, photographs and contemporary artwork and prints. The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College has substantial holdings of Dickinson&#x27;s manuscripts and letters as well as a lock of Dickinson&#x27;s hair and the original of the only positively identified image of the poet. In 1965, in recognition of Dickinson&#x27;s growing stature as a poet, the Homestead was purchased by Amherst College. It opened to the public for tours, and also served as a faculty residence for many years. The Emily Dickinson Museum was created in 2003 when ownership of the Evergreens, which had been occupied by Dickinson family heirs until 1988, was transferred to the college.

== Modern influence and inspiration ==

Emily Dickinson&#x27;s life and works have been the source of inspiration to artists, particularly to feminist-oriented artists, of a variety of mediums. A few notable examples are:
* The feminist artwork &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;, by Judy Chicago, first exhibited in 1979, features a place setting for Dickinson.
* In William Styron&#x27;s 1979 novel &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot;, and later in the film of the same name directed by Alan J. Pakula, the poems of Emily Dickinson hold an important place. The final line of the book, as well as in the movie, is borrowed from Emily&#x27;s poem &quot;Ample Make This Bed&quot;.
* Jane Campion&#x27;s film &quot;The Piano&quot; and its novelization (co-authored by Kate Pullinger) were inspired by the poetry of Emily Dickinson as well as the novels by the Brontë sisters.
* A character who is a literary scholar at a fictional New England college in the comic campus novel by Pamela Hansford Johnson &quot;Night and Silence Who Is Here?&quot; is intent on proving that Emily Dickinson was a secret dipsomaniac. His obsession costs him his job.
* The 2012 book &quot;The Emily Dickinson Reader&quot; by Paul Legault is an English-to-English translation of her complete poems published by McSweeney&#x27;s.
* Dickinson&#x27;s work has been set by numerous composers including Aaron Copland, Samuel Barber, Chester Biscardi, Elliot Carter, John Adams, John Clement Adams, Libby Larsen, Marjorie Rusche, Peter Seabourne, Michael Tilson Thomas, and Judith Weir. Her composer cousin Clarence Dickinson set his first songs to six of her poems in 1898.
* A public garden is named in her honor in Paris: &#x27;square Emily-Dickinson&#x27;, in the 20th arrondissement.
* Jazz saxophonist Jane Ira Bloom released the 2017 double album &quot;Wild Lines: Improvising Emily Dickinson&quot; inspired by the poet&#x27;s works.
*Terence Davies directed and wrote &quot;A Quiet Passion&quot;, a 2016 biographical film about the life of Dickinson. The film stars Cynthia Nixon as the reclusive poet. The film premiered at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2016 and was released in the United Kingdom on April 7, 2017.
* &quot;Wild Nights with Emily&quot;, a 2018 American romantic comedy film written and directed by Madeleine Olnek. The film is based on actual events from Dickinson&#x27;s life.
* &quot;Dickinson&quot; is a TV series starring Hailee Steinfeld as Emily Dickinson and premiered in 2019 on Apple TV+. The series focused on Dickinson&#x27;s life.
* American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, who is a distant cousin of Dickinson, described a category of her lyrics and songwriting, affectionally titled &quot;quill pen songs&quot;, that are in part inspired by the likes of Dickinson. She stated, &quot;if my lyrics sound like a letter written by Emily Dickinson&#x27;s great-grandmother while sewing a lace curtain, that&#x27;s me writing in the Quill genre. I will give you an example from one of my songs [&#x27;Ivy&#x27;] I&#x27;d categorize as Quill.&quot; The aforementioned song, &quot;Ivy&quot;, was used in an episode of the Apple TV+ series, &quot;Dickinson&quot; (see above).

<doc id="159277" wikidata="Q366322" url="?curid=159277" title="Alexis Denisof">
<text>Alexis Denisof (born February 25, 1966) is an American actor, primarily known for playing Wesley Wyndam-Pryce in the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and its spin-off &quot;Angel&quot;. He also had a recurring role on &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;. His wife, Alyson Hannigan, starred in both &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;.

==Early life==
Denisof was born in Salisbury, Maryland, the son of Christiana Taylor and Gerald Denisof. He is of Russian, Russian-Jewish, French, and Irish ancestry. He moved to Seattle, Washington, when he was three years old. He attended Highline College, where his mother was head of the drama department. After graduating from St Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire at the age of 17, he moved to London, England, where he lived and worked for several years. Denisof is listed as an Alumnus of the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art in 2017-18 &#x27;LAMDA Review of the Year&#x27;.

==Career==
Beginning his career in the film industry, Denisof was the fight director for a stage production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and in 1991 was the fight director for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Other Side&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, and &quot;The Soul&#x27;s Dark Night&quot;. His first lead role was alongside Sir Christopher Lee in the feature film &quot;Murder Story&quot; (1989) where he played an investigative reporter. One of his first known works in television was on the arcade version of the video for &quot;Got My Mind Set On You&quot; by George Harrison. In 1995, he landed a small part in the 1995 film &quot;First Knight&quot;, appearing as one of Arthur&#x27;s round table knights in multiple scenes with Sean Connery and Richard Gere. Following those roles, Denisof worked with Sean Bean in three episodes of &quot;Sharpe&quot; as Lord John Rossendale in 1997.

His best-known character, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, was introduced in 1999 in the third season of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; as Buffy&#x27;s replacement Watcher. Originally, Wyndam-Pryce was supposed to be killed off in the season 3 finale but, due to Whedon&#x27;s surprise at how well he fit into the series, Denisof was given the choice about his character&#x27;s fate and chose for him to live. As a result, Wyndam-Pryce later arrived as a motorcycle-riding rogue demon-hunter in season one, episode 10 of &quot;Angel&quot;, and was an official main cast member from episode 11 on, effectively replacing the character Doyle. Wyndam-Pryce appeared in 100 out of the 110 episodes of the series.

The end of the series in 2004 saw a lag in Denisof&#x27;s career. Save for appearing in three episodes of the hit series &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, as the goofy philandering Sandy Rivers, Denisof would not work as much as he used to for the next several years. During this time he appeared in several stage productions, including &quot;Rope&quot; at Chichester Festival Theatre&#x27;s Minerva Theatre with Anthony Head, who played Wesley&#x27;s predecessor Rupert Giles on &quot;Buffy&quot;. Denisof was among 200 actors considered for the role of James Bond in &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, but lost out to Daniel Craig. Later, in 2008, he appeared in season 2 of &quot;Private Practice&quot; as a man named Daniel, a bigamist who has two pregnant wives who don&#x27;t know about each other. In 2009, he appeared in four episodes of Joss Whedon&#x27;s &quot;Dollhouse&quot; as Senator Daniel Perrin.
In 2011, Denisof reprised his recurring role as Sandy Rivers in &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;; he ultimately appeared in 10 episodes in total, and his last appearance was in the episode &quot;Gary Blauman&quot;. In a season 1 commentary, creators Craig Thomas and Carter Bays speculated that Denisof was initially reluctant to take the role back in 2006 because he feared it was just charity work on account of his wife, Hannigan, playing a main character on the show. They went on to state that he was not aware, until they actually told him, that they were huge fans of his work dating back to his time on &quot;Angel&quot;.

Since 2011, Denisof has been relatively active. He played a voice role in the animated DC film &quot;Justice League: Doom&quot;. He was featured in the majority of episodes in the AOL webseries &quot;Little Women, Big Cars&quot;. He was then cast as a lead in Bryan Singer&#x27;s new webseries &quot;H+: The Digital Series&quot;. He then reunited with Joss Whedon for two different film projects. The first was a minor role in the summer blockbuster &quot;The Avengers&quot;, as The Other, a servant of the character Thanos, and a cohort of Loki. The second was the lead male role in a modern version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival, to positive reviews from critics. The film was released worldwide in June 2013.

In August 2013 he was cast in the third season of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Grimm&quot; as a recurring character named Viktor Albert Wilhelm George Beckendorf. In 2014, Denisof reprised his role as The Other in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;. In the same year he began starring in the MTV television series &quot;Finding Carter&quot; as David Wilson. As of 2018, Denisof starred in the web series &quot;I Love Bekka &amp; Lucy&quot; as Glenn, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Actor in a Short Form Comedy or Drama Series, his first such nomination.

On November 28, 2018, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that Denisof would play the recurring role of Adam Masters in the second season of Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot;. In 2019 he began playing the recurring role of Professor Vardemus in the supernatural television show &quot;Legacies&quot;.

==Personal life==

According to the DVD release of &quot;Angel&quot;″s season five, three weeks before the filming of the season premiere, Denisof was stricken with Bell&#x27;s palsy, from which he later recovered. Due to the paralysis of the left side of his face, scenes were structured to not show its effects.

Denisof married past co-star Alyson Hannigan, who played Willow Rosenberg in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, on October 11, 2003. The couple live in Encino, Los Angeles. They have two daughters: Satyana Marie, born in March 2009, and Keeva Jane, born in May 2012.

<doc id="159280" wikidata="Q461406" url="?curid=159280" title="Change ringing">
<text>Change ringing is the art of ringing a set of tuned bells in a tightly controlled manner to produce precise variations in their successive striking sequences, known as &quot;changes&quot;. This can be by method ringing in which the ringers commit to memory the rules for generating each change, or by call changes, where the ringers are instructed how to generate each change by instructions from a conductor. This creates a form of bell music which cannot be discerned as a conventional melody, but is a series of mathematical sequences. It can also be automated by machinery.

Change ringing originated following the invention of English full-circle tower bell ringing in the early 17th century, when bell ringers found that swinging a bell through a much larger arc than that required for swing-chiming gave control over the time between successive strikes of the clapper. Ordinarily a bell will swing through a small arc only at a set speed governed by its size and shape in the nature of a simple pendulum, but by swinging through a larger arc approaching a full circle, control of the strike interval can be exercised by the ringer. This culminated in the technique of full circle ringing, which enabled ringers to independently change the speeds of their individual bells accurately to combine in ringing different mathematical permutations, known as &quot;changes&quot;. 
Speed control of a tower bell is exerted by the ringer only when each bell is mouth upwards and moving slowly near the balance point; this constraint and the intricate rope manipulation involved normally requires that each bell have its own ringer. The considerable weights of full-circle tower bells also means they cannot be easily stopped or started and the practical change of interval between successive strikes is limited. This places limitations on the rules for generating easily-rung changes; each bell must strike once in each change, but its position of striking in successive changes can only change by one place.

Change ringing is practised worldwide, but it is by far most common on church bells in English churches, where it first developed. 
Change ringing is also performed on handbells, where conventionally each ringer holds two bells, and chimed on carillons and chimes of bells, though these are more commonly used to play conventional melodies.

==Technique and physics==

Today, some towers have as many as sixteen bells that can be rung together, though six or eight bells are more common. The highest pitch bell is known as the &quot;treble&quot;, and the lowest is the &quot;tenor&quot;. In some towers, a bell larger than a tenor that is present would be called a &quot;bourdon&quot;. The bourdon is not part of the change ringing peal, it is hung from a pivoted beam. For convenience, the bells are referred to by number, with the treble being number 1 and the other bells numbered by their pitch—2, 3, 4, etc.—sequentially down the scale. (This system often seems counter-intuitive to musicians, who are used to a numbering that ascends with pitch.) The bells are usually tuned to a diatonic major scale, with the tenor bell being the tonic (or key) note of the scale. Some towers contain additional bells so that different subsets of the full number can be rung, still to a diatonic scale. For instance, many 12-bell towers have a &quot;flat sixth&quot;, which if rung instead of the normal number 6 bell allows 2 to 9 to be rung as light diatonic octave; other variations are also possible. 

The bells in a tower reside in the &quot;bell chamber&quot; or &quot;belfry&quot; usually with louvred windows to enable the sound to escape.

The bells are mounted within a &quot;bellframe&quot; of steel or wood. Each bell is suspended from a &quot;headstock&quot; fitted on trunnions (plain or non-friction bearings) mounted to the belfry framework so that the bell assembly can rotate. When stationary in the &quot;down&quot; position, the centre of mass of the bell and clapper is appreciably below the centreline of the trunnion supports, giving a pendulous effect to the assembly, and this dynamic is controlled by the ringer&#x27;s rope. The headstock is fitted with a wooden &quot;stay&quot;, which, in conjunction with a &quot;slider&quot;, limits maximum rotational movement to a little less than 370 degrees. To the headstock a large wooden wheel is fitted and to which a rope is attached. The rope wraps and unwraps on the rim of the wheel as the bell rotates backwards and forwards. This is full circle ringing and quite different from fixed or limited motion bells, which &quot;chime&quot;. Within the bell the &quot;clapper&quot; is constrained to swing in the direction that the bell swings. The clapper is a rigid steel or wrought iron bar with a large ball to strike the bell. The thickest part of the mouth of bell is called the soundbow and it is against this that the ball strikes. Beyond the ball is a &quot;flight&quot;, which controls the speed of the clapper. In very small bells this can be nearly as long as the rest of the clapper.

Below the bell chamber there may be one or more sound chambers, (one of which is likely to house the clock mechanism if the church has one) and through which the rope passes before it drops into the &quot;ringing chamber&quot; or room. Typically, the rope&#x27;s length is such that it falls close to or on to the floor of the ringing chamber. About from the floor, the rope has a woollen grip called the &quot;sally&quot; (usually around long) while the lower end of the rope is doubled over to form an easily held &quot;tail-end&quot;.

Unattended bells are normally left hanging in the normal (&quot;down&quot;) position, but prior to being rung, the bells are &quot;rung up&quot;. In the down position, the bells are safe if a person touches them or pulls a rope. A bell that is up is dangerous to be near, and only expert ringers should ever contemplate entering a bell chamber or touching a rope when the bells are up. To raise a bell, the ringer pulls on the rope and starts the bell swinging. Each time the bell swings the ringer adds a little more energy to the system, similar to pushing a child&#x27;s swing. Eventually there is enough energy for the bell to swing right up and be left over-centre just beyond the balance point with the stay resting against the slider to hold the bell in position, ready to be rung.

Bellringers typically stand in a circle around the ringing chamber, each managing one rope. Bells and their attendant ropes are so mounted that the ropes are pulled in a circular sequence, usually clockwise, starting with the lightest (treble) bell and descending to the heaviest (tenor). To ring the bell, the ringer first pulls the sally towards the floor, upsetting the bell&#x27;s balance and swinging it on its bearings. As the bell swings downwards the rope unwinds from the wheel and the ringer adds enough pull to counteract friction and air resistance. The bell winds the rope back onto the other side of the wheel as it rises and the ringer can slow (or &quot;check&quot;) the rise of the bell if required.

The rope is attached to one side of the wheel so that a different amount of rope is wound on and off as it swings to and fro. The first stroke is the &quot;handstroke&quot; with a small amount of rope on the wheel. The ringer pulls on the sally and when the bell swings up it draws up more rope onto the wheel and the sally rises to, or beyond, the ceiling. The ringer keeps hold of the tail-end of the rope to control the bell. After a controlled pause with the bell, on or close to its balancing point, the ringer rings the &quot;backstroke&quot; by pulling the tail-end, causing the bell to swing back towards its starting position. As the sally rises, the ringer catches it to pause the bell at its balance position.

In English-style ringing the bell is rung up such that the clapper is resting on the lower edge of the bell when the bell is on the stay. During each swing, the clapper travels faster than the bell, eventually striking the soundbow and making the bell sound. The bell &quot;speaks&quot; roughly when horizontal as it rises, thus projecting the sound outwards. The clapper rebounds very slightly, allowing the bell to ring. At the balance point, the clapper passes over the top and rests against the soundbow.

In change ringing where the order the bells are struck in is constantly altered, it is necessary to time the swing so that this strike occurs with precise positioning within the overall pattern. Precision of striking is important at all times. To ring quickly, the bell must not complete the full 360 degrees before swinging back in the opposite direction; while ringing slowly, the ringer waits with the bell held at the balance, before allowing it to swing back. To achieve this, the ringer must work with the bell&#x27;s momentum, applying just the right amount of effort during the pull that the bell swings as far as required and no further. This allows two adjacent bells to reverse positions, the quicker bell passing the slower bell to establish a new pattern. Although ringing up certainly involves some physical exertion, actual ringing should rely more on practised skill than mere brute force. Even the smallest bell in a tower is much heavier than the person ringing it. The heaviest bell hung for full-circle ringing is in Liverpool Cathedral and weighs . Despite this colossal weight, it can be safely rung by one (experienced) ringer.

(Whilst heavier bells exist – for example Big Ben – they are generally only chimed, either by swinging the bell slightly or having the bell hung dead and using a mechanical hammer.)

==Changes==
The simplest way to sound a ring of bells is by ringing &quot;rounds&quot;. This is a repeated sequence of bells descending from the highest to lowest note, which is from the lightest to the heaviest bell. This was the original sequence used before change ringing was developed, and change ringing always starts and ends with this sequence.

Two forms of ringing changes have developed;
#Call changes: where the conductor of the ringing commands each change.
#Method ringing: where after a word of command to start, the changes are rung from memory by the ringers.

===Call change ringing===

Most ringers begin their ringing career with call change ringing; they can thus concentrate on learning the physical skills needed to handle their bells without needing to worry about &quot;methods&quot;. There are also many towers where experienced ringers practise call change ringing as an art in its own right (and even exclusively), particularly in the English county of Devon.

The technique was probably developed in the early 17th century in the early days of change ringing.

Call change ringing requires one ringer to give commands to change the order of the bells, as distinct from method ringing, where the ringers memorise the course of bells as part of a continuous pattern.

====Call change instructions====
In &quot;call change ringing&quot; each different sequence of the bells, known as a &quot;row&quot;, is specifically called out by one ringer, the &quot;conductor&quot;, who instructs the other ringers how to change their bells&#x27; places from row to row. This command is known as a &quot;call&quot;.

The change is made at the next &quot;handstroke&quot; (when the sally on the bell rope is pulled), after the call. In calling, the conductor usually has a strategy or plan to achieve the desired progression of rows, rather than remembering each call, and an example of these is shown in the example on eight bells. Conductors can space out the calls at will, but each row is normally struck twice at least because of the difficulty of calling continuous changes.

Calls are usually of the form &quot;X to (or after) Y&quot; or &quot;X and Y&quot;; in which X and Y refer to two of the bells by their physical numbers in the tower (not by their positions in the row). All cause two bells to swap. The first form is used for &quot;calling up&quot; and &quot;calling down&quot;, and the second form swaps the two bells mentioned.

As an example of calling up and down, consider the following sequence of rows, and the calls a conductor would use to call them:

Thus it can be seen how these ways of calling differ:

*In &quot;calling up&quot;, The first-called bell moves after the second called bell. 
*In &quot;calling down&quot;, The first-called bell moves after the second called bell.
*In &quot;Swapping&quot;, the bells simply swap position
In all cases, the ringer of the bell immediately above (behind) the swapping pair must also be alert, as that bell follows a new bell after the swap. Rarer forms of change calling may name just one of the moving bells, call the moving bell by position rather than number, or call out the full change.

The example on the right shows called changes eight bells being called using the &quot;down&quot; system. The sequence of calls shown gives three well-known musical rows, which are Whittingtons, Queens, and Tittums.

* Whittingtons - bell 1 and 2 stay in place, other bells ascend the odds and descend the evens
* Queens - descending odd bells then descending evens
* Tittums - interspersed light and heavy bells, giving a &quot;tee-tum, tee-tum...&quot; effect.

===Method ringing===

Method ringing is the continuously changing form of change ringing, and gets its name from the use of a particular &quot;method&quot; to generate the changes.

After starting in repetitive rounds, at a given command, the ringers vary the bells&#x27; order, to produce a series of distinct sequences known as &quot;rows&quot; or &quot;changes&quot;. In this way permutation of the bells&#x27; striking order proceeds. For example &quot;123456&quot; can become &quot;214365&quot; in the next sequence.

The method is committed to memory by each ringer, so that only a few commands are given by the ringer in charge (the conductor). Learning the method does not consist of memorising the individual sequences, but using a variety of techniques such as:
# Memorising the path of the bell, not the numbers of the bells it strikes after. This can be by visualising a tracking line in a method diagram
# or by breaking the line into small &quot;work&quot; units which are joined together.
# and looking for visual signposts, such as when the ringer&#x27;s bell crosses with another particular bell.

There are thousands of different methods, of which two methods on six bells are explained in detail below.

====Plain hunt====
In method ringing, plain hunt is the simplest form of generating changing permutations in a continuous fashion, and is a fundamental building-block of many change ringing methods. The accompanying diagram shows plain hunt on six bells. The course of two bells only are shown for clarity. Each row in the diagram shows the order of striking after each change.

Plain hunt consists of a plain undeviating course of a bell between the first and last places in the striking order, by moving a place in the sequence at each change, but with two strikes in the first and last position to enable a turn-around as the internal bells change over.

Thus each bell moves one position at each succeeding change, unless they reach the first or last position, where they remain for two changes then proceed to the other end of the sequence. All of the bells are doing this at every change, without any words of command.

This simple rule can be extended to any number of bells, however it repeats the sequence after twice the number of bells hunting.

====Plain Bob====
To enable a greater number of changes to be rung without repetition, more advanced methods were developed, many based upon the plain hunt. &quot;Plain Bob&quot; is one of the oldest and simplest of these, and is shown as an example above.

A &quot;plain course&quot; of plain bob minor is shown in diagrammatic form, which has the characteristics:
#all the bells plain hunt, until the treble bell is first, and depending where they are in the pattern, they 
#perform &quot;dodges&quot; in the 3-4 position 
#or perform dodges in the 5-6 positions 
#or sit for two blows if they are just above the treble, then go first again.

The red bell track shows the order of &quot;works&quot;, which are deviations from the plain hunt.
#3/4 down dodge
#5/6 down dodge
#5/6 up dodge
#3/4 up dodge
#make 2nds place.
And then it repeats. Each bells starts at a different place in this cyclical order. 
A dodge means just that: two bells dodge round each other, thus changing their relationship to the treble, and giving rise to different changes.

The plain bob pattern can be extended beyond the constraints of the plain course of 60 changes, to the full unique 720 changes possible (this is 6 factorial on 6 bells, which is 1×2×3×4×5×6 = 720 changes). To do this, at set points in the sequences one of the ringers, called the &quot;conductor&quot; calls out commands such as &quot;bob&quot; or &quot;single&quot;, which introduce further variations. The conductor follows a &quot;composition&quot; which they have to commit to memory. This enables the other ringers to produce large numbers of unique changes without memorising huge quantities of data, without any written prompts.

Ringers can also ring different methods, with different &quot;works&quot; on different numbers of bells - so there is a huge variety of ways of ringing changes in method ringing.

==Peals and quarter peals==

For some people, the ultimate goal of this system is to ring &quot;all&quot; the permutations, to ring a tower&#x27;s bells in every possible order without repeating – what is called an &quot;extent&quot; (or sometimes, formerly, a &quot;full peal&quot;). The feasibility of this depends on how many bells are involved: if a tower has &quot;n&quot; bells, they have &quot;n&quot;! (read factorial) possible permutations, a number that becomes quite large as &quot;n&quot; grows.

For example, while six bells have 720 permutations, eight bells have 40,320; furthermore, 10! = 3,628,800, and 12! = 479,001,600. Estimating two seconds for each change (a reasonable pace), one finds that while an extent on six bells can be accomplished in half an hour, an extent on eight bells should take nearly twenty-two and a half hours. (When in 1963 ringers in Loughborough became the only band in history to achieve this feat on tower bells, it took them just under 18 hours.) An extent on 12 bells would take over thirty years.

Since extents are obviously not always practicable, ringers more often undertake shorter performances. Such ringing starts and ends with rounds, having meanwhile visited only a subset of the available permutations; but &quot;truth&quot; is still considered essential — no row can ever be repeated; to do so would make the ringing &quot;false&quot;. A &quot;peal&quot; is an extended performance; it must comprise at least 5000 changes (but 5040 on 7 bells). A performance of 1250 changes likewise makes a &quot;quarter peal&quot; (&quot;quarter&quot; for short); a peal or a quarter tends to last about three hours or 45 minutes, respectively.

==Changes on handbells==

Change ringing can also be performed on handbells, and is quite popular in its own right. Many record-length peals, including the longest peal ever rung, are by handbell ringers.

Normally each ringer has a bell in each hand and sit or stand in a circle (like tower ringers). The tower bell terms of &quot;handstroke&quot; and &quot;backstroke&quot; are retained, referring to an upwards and downwards ring of the bell respectively; and as in towers, the ringing proceeds in alternate rows of handstroke and backstroke.

Occasionally, a technique called &quot;lapping&quot;, or &quot;cross and stretch&quot; is used. Ringers stand or sit in a straight line at a single convenient table on which the bells are placed. They pick up a bell each time they ring it, and then put it down. As the bell sequence changes, however, the ringers physically swap the bells accordingly—so the bells move up and down the table and each row is rung in strict sequence from right to left. Ringers in cross and stretch thus do not have responsibility for their own personal bell, but handle each as it comes.

Some handbell change ringers practice a hybrid of these two methods, known as &quot;body ringing&quot;: ringers standing in a line each hold one bell, exchanging places in the line so that the changes sound correctly when the bells are rung in sequence from right to left.

==History and modern culture==
Change ringing as we know it today emerged in England in the 17th century. To that era we can trace the origins of the earliest ringing societies, such as the &quot;Lincoln Cathedral Guild&quot;, which claims to date to 1612 or the &quot;Antient&quot; &quot;Society of Ringers of St Stephen&quot; in Bristol, which was founded in 1620 and lasted as a ringing society until the late 19th century. The recreation began to flourish in earnest in the Restoration era; an important milestone in the development of method ringing as a careful science was the 1668 publication by Richard Duckworth and Fabian Stedman of their book &quot;Tintinnalogia&quot;, which promised in its subtitle to lay down &quot;plain and easie Rules for Ringing all sorts of Plain Changes&quot;. Stedman followed this in 1677 with another famous early guide, &quot;Campanalogia.&quot;

Throughout the years since, the group theoretical underpinnings of change ringing have been pursued by mathematicians. &quot;Changes&quot; can be viewed as permutations; sets of permutations constitute mathematical groups, which in turn can be depicted via so-called Cayley graphs, which in turn can be mapped onto polyhedra. 

Bells have been installed in towers around the world and many rings in the British Isles have been augmented to ten, twelve, fourteen, or even sixteen bells. Today change ringing is, particularly in England, a popular and commonplace sound, often issuing from a church tower before or after a service or wedding. While on these everyday occasions the ringers must usually content themselves with shorter &quot;touches&quot;, each lasting a few minutes, for special occasions they often attempt a quarter-peal or peal, lasting approximately 45 minutes or three hours respectively. If a peal attempt succeeds, towers sometimes mark the occasion with a peal board mounted on the wall of the ringing chamber; at St Peter Mancroft in Norwich there is one documenting what is generally considered to have been the first true peal: 5040 changes of &quot;Plain Bob Triples&quot; (a method still popular today), rung 2 May 1715. There is some evidence there may have been an earlier peal (also Plain Bob Triples), rung January 7, 1690 at St Sepulchre-without-Newgate in the City of London by the Ancient Society of College Youths. Today over 4000 peals are rung each year.

===Organisation and extent===
The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, founded in 1891, is dedicated to representing change ringers around the world. Most regional and local ringing guilds are affiliated with the council. Its journal, &quot;The Ringing World&quot;, has been published weekly since 1911; in addition to news and features relating to bellringing and the bellringing community, it publishes records of achievements such as peals and quarter-peals. Ringers generally adhere to the Council&#x27;s rules and definitions governing change ringing.

The Central Council, by means of its peal records, also keeps track of record length peals, both on tower bells and handbells. (The record for tower bells remains the 1963 Loughborough extent of Plain Bob Major [40,320 changes]; for handbells it was set in 2007 in Willingham, Cambridgeshire, with 72,000 changes of 100 different Treble Dodging Minor methods, taking just over 24 hours to ring) More importantly, perhaps, along with keeping track of the first peal ever rung in a method, the Central Council controls the naming of new methods: it generally allows the first band to ring a method to name it.

Much ringing is carried out by bands of ringers meeting at their local tower to ring its bells. For the sake of variety, though, many ringers like to take occasional trips to make a &quot;tower grab&quot; ringing the bells of a less familiar tower. The setting, the church architecture, the chance to ring more bells than usual, the bells&#x27; unique tone, their ease or difficulty of ringing, and sometimes even the unusual means of accessing the ringing chamber can all be part of the attraction. The traditional means of finding bell towers, and still the most popular way today, is the book (and now internet database) &quot;Dove&#x27;s Guide for Church Bell Ringers&quot;.

 there are 7,141 English style rings in ringable condition. The Netherlands, Belgium, Pakistan, India, and Spain have one each. The Windward Isles and the Isle of Man have 2 each. Canada and New Zealand 8 each. The Channel Isles 11. Africa as a continent has 13. Scotland 23, Ireland 38, USA 48, Australia 61 and Wales 227. The remaining 6,695 (94%) are in England (including three mobile rings). World-wide there are 985 unringable rings, 930 in England, 55 in Wales and 12 elsewhere.

===Number of bells===
Methods of change ringing are named for the number of working bells, or the bells that switch order within the change. It takes a pair to switch, and commonly the largest bell (the tenor) does not change place. For example, there may be six bells, only five of which work, allowing for only two pairs. A method of ringing for these bells would be called &quot;doubles&quot;. Doubles is the most common group of methods rung in the United Kingdom, since the majority of parish churches with bell towers in the UK are fitted with only six bells.

&quot;Plain Bob Doubles&quot; is a method rung on five bells whereas &quot;Plain Bob Triples&quot; is the same method rung on seven working bells.

There are two separate ways to refer to the number of bells. One way is used for even numbers, the other for an odd number.

The name for 9 bells is pronounced &quot;kate-ers&quot; and comes from the French &quot;quatres&quot;. The name for 11 bells also comes from the French and is pronounced &quot;sinks&quot; c.f. Cinque Ports.

The names refer to the number of bells which change places in each row. With three bells only one pair can change, and so it is singles. With seven bells there are clearly three pairs with the one left over not moving this row.

===Named changes===
Mathematical abstraction though each row may be, some rows do have a musical or melodic meaning to the listener. Over the years, a number of these have acquired names — they are &quot;named changes&quot;. Both the conductors directing call-change ringing and the &quot;composers&quot; coming up with plans for a bout of method ringing sometimes like to work their favourite named changes in. The table below lists some popular named changes on eight bells; many of these names are also applicable by extension on more or fewer bells.

Such names are often humorous; for example, the sequence 14235 on five bells is called &quot;weasels&quot; because it is the tune of the refrain to the children&#x27;s song &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot;. This is particularly effective at the end of ringing down. The bells are in order, and so if not chimed leave a pause, the sequence becomes: 1..4..23.5 where a dot indicates a pause.

===Striking===
Although neither call change nor method ringing produces conventional tunes, it is still the aim of the ringers to produce a pleasant sound. One of the most important aspects of this is &quot;good striking&quot; — not only should the bells never &quot;clash&quot; by sounding at the same moment, the bells should sound to a perfect rhythm, tapping out a steady beat.

It is the custom to leave a pause of one beat after every alternate row, i.e., after the ringing of each ‘backstroke’ row. This is called &#x27;open handstroke&#x27; ringing (or open handstroke leading). In Devon, Cornwall and parts of Yorkshire, this custom is not followed when call-change ringing; instead the bells strike steadily without the pause. This latter custom is known as the &quot;closed-hand&quot; or &quot;cartwheel&quot; arrangement. However for method ringing the universal practice is to ring with open handstrokes, even in the South West of England.

Striking competitions are held where various bands of ringers attempt to ring with their best striking. They are judged on their number of &quot;faults&quot; (striking errors); the band with the fewest faults wins. These competitions are organized on regional and national levels, being particularly popular among the call-change ringers of Devon where it is customary to include the quality of the rise and lower of the bells as part of the judging criteria. Competitions for method ringers usually start &quot;off the stay&quot;—i.e., the bells are rung up before the competition begins. At the annual National 12 Bell Striking Contest the bands are ringing methods and producing a different change approximately every 2.5 seconds, with a gap between bells of 0.21 seconds. To an expert ringer&#x27;s ear at this level of competition a variation of a tenth of this would be discernible as a striking fault.

===Sport===
In 2016 readers of &quot;The Ringing World&quot; magazine wrote to insist that bell ringing was &quot;an art and a sport&quot;, as demonstrated by regular &quot;striking competitions&quot;. It was suggested that classification of change ringing as a sport by Sport England could save it from becoming obsolete. But the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers opposed the move, suggesting that it would jeopardise its relationship with church bodies, since bell ringing should be seen as part of Christian worship, not exercise. The council&#x27;s president, Chris Mew, said: &quot;Where is the glamour of the sports field and where are the David Beckhams of the belfry?&quot;

===Virtual===
The COVID-19 pandemic made it impossible for bell ringers to assemble in belfries. Searching for alternative methods, in March 2020 two ringers from the USA developed software called Ringing Room that mimics the operation of ropes and bells, and permits people to ring together online, in a type of networked music performance. Various other online platforms for virtual change ringing have also been created, but Ringing Room is the most popular, with over 10,000 people joining in the first year.

In one Shropshire church, bells can be tied up with their sounds simulated by sensors, so ringers can practise in silence using Bluetooth headsets.

== In literature and television ==
The mystery novel &quot;The Nine Tailors&quot; by Dorothy L. Sayers (1934) contains a great deal of information on change-ringing. Her fictional detective, Lord Peter Wimsey, demonstrates his skill at ringing, and the solution to the central puzzle of the book rests in part upon his knowledge of the patterns of change ringing.

Connie Willis, who frequently references Sayers in &quot;To Say Nothing of the Dog&quot; (1997), features bell ringers in her earlier novel &quot;Doomsday Book&quot; (1992); a group of American women led by a Mrs. Taylor frequently appears practising for or ringing both handbells and changes.

The British television series &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; aired an episode in the fifth season on a series of murders within a bell-ringing team, in &quot;Ring Out Your Dead&quot;.

In the science-fiction novel &quot;Anathem&quot; by Neal Stephenson (2008) changes are rung in a cloistered monastery for mathematicians to signal different ceremonies.

==English bell-ringing terms==

* Back – at or near last place in a change.
* Back bells – the heavier bells (so tend to limit the speed).
* Backstroke (or Backstroke home) – The part of a bell&#x27;s cycle started by pulling on the &quot;tail end&quot; (rope end) in the tower, or with the bells raised &quot;in hand&quot;; also: the position at which the back bells come into &quot;rounds&quot; order at backstroke.
* Baldrick – the leather lined metal strap from which the &quot;clappers&quot; used to be hung.
* Band – a group of ringers for a given set of bells (or for a special purpose, e.g., a &quot;peal band&quot;)
* Bearings – the load-bearing assembly on which the &quot;headstock&quot; (and so the whole bell) turns about its gudgeon pins. Modern hanging means the bell is &quot;hung&quot; on &quot;ball bearings&quot;, but were traditionally &quot;plain bearings&quot;.
* Bob – the commonest type of call in most methods or a class of &quot;plainmethod&quot; (in which either &quot;dodging&quot; takes place or some bells are not just &quot;hunting&quot; or &quot;place making&quot;); also can mean (usually called the &quot;Bob place&quot;) the appropriate point in the method (e.g. a &quot;lead end&quot;) to modify the sequence of changes.
* Bob caller – someone who &quot;calls&quot; a &quot;touch&quot;, but does not check the ringing as a &quot;conductor&quot; would.
* Bristol start – starting to raise in peal by adding an extra bell each time.
* Bump the stay – allow the bell to swing &quot;over the balance&quot;, out of control, so the &quot;stay&quot; pushes the &quot;slider&quot; to its limit, stopping the bell.
* Cambridge – The &quot;right place&quot; &quot;surprise&quot; &quot;method&quot;, one of the &quot;standard eight&quot;, that is often the first learned.
* Canons – loops cast onto older bells&#x27; crowns.
* Cinques – (pronounced &quot;sinks&quot;) methods for working eleven bells (possibly with a twelfth covering) the name deriving from the practice of swapping five pairs of bells.
* Clapper – the metal (usually cast iron) rod/hammer hung from a pivot below the &quot;crown&quot; of the bell, that strikes the &quot;soundbow&quot; of the bell when the bell stops moving.
* Clocking – causing a bell to sound while down by pulling a hammer against it (as a clock would) or by pulling the &quot;clapper&quot; against the side of the bell.
* Closed leads (also called cartwheeling) – handstroke changes follow backstroke changes with no handstroke gap (unlike open leads)
* Come round – return to rounds to end a &quot;touch&quot; (e.g. &quot;come round at &quot;handstroke&quot;), or produce rounds prematurely.
* Cover – a bell (e.g. &quot;tenor&quot;) ringing at the end of every &quot;row&quot;, while the other bells ring a &quot;method&quot;.
* Delight – a &quot;treble bob&quot; &quot;method&quot; in which an &quot;internal place&quot; is made sometimes, but not every time, the &quot;treble&quot; is going from one &quot;dodge&quot; to another (&quot;cross sections&quot;).
* Dodge – Changing direction for one stroke in bell ringing (although strictly a dodge is taking a retrograde step in the middle of a portion of &quot;hunting&quot;). Dodging practice is an exercise where two bells exchange places on every stroke, sometimes taught to aid learners change from &quot;call changes&quot; to &quot;plain hunt&quot;.
* Double method – a &quot;method&quot; where the structure is the same if reversed.
* Doubles – a method with five working bells, possibly with a sixth &quot;covering&quot;.
* Down – EITHER: when the bells are hanging with the mouth lowermost position, OR: moving towards the front (as in &quot;hunting down&quot;).
* Extent – a touch where all possible changes are rung exactly once each; the number of such different rows is N factorial, where N is the number of bells.
* Firing- From rounds all the bells are rung at once for a few strokes before returning to rounds. Done at special occasions such as weddings or New Year. 
* Fire out – to ring haphazardly, either because ringers accidentally try to ring at once, or deliberately for wedding ringing.
* Front – at or near the start of a row.
* Front bells – the smaller bells which are rung first in rounds.
* Garter hole – the hole in the wheel where the rope passes through.
* Handstroke – the stroke when the sally is gripped. 
* Hunt – move one place at a time up or down (see plain hunt, treble bob hunt, etc.).
* Lead end – the change on which the &quot;treble&quot; is &quot;leading&quot; (ringing first) at its backstroke.
* Little Bob – a method in which the &quot;treble&quot; &quot;plain hunts&quot; between &quot;lead&quot; and a place short of the last place. 
* Line – the sequence of places a bell rings in a method, or the diagram describing the method (the convention being that the treble line is shown in red while the others are blue).
* Method – an agreed/named sequence of changes that forms a &quot;round block&quot;, See &quot;plain course&quot;.
* Muffling For commemorative services such as funerals, memorial services and Remembrance Sunday, the bells are rung &quot;half-muffled&quot; with a leather pad on one side of the clapper. Very rarely &quot;fully muffled&quot; with pads both sides.. 
* Sally – the woollen bulge woven into the rope. It is both an indicator and a help with gripping. 
* Slider – A device which allows the bell to go over the balance at each end of its swing, but not to over-rotate. 
* Stay – a device that is attached to the headstock and works in conjunction with the slider.
* Tenor – the lowest pitched bell in the tower.
* Treble – the highest-pitched bell in the tower. 
* Up – EITHER: when the bells are raised to the mouth uppermost position, OR: moving towards the back (as in &quot;hunting up&quot;).

<text>Charisma Carpenter (born July 23, 1970) is an American actress. She played Cordelia Chase in the supernatural drama series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1997–1999) and its spin-off series &quot;Angel&quot; (1999–2004). She also starred as Kyra in &quot;Charmed&quot; (2004), Kendall Casablancas in &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; (2005–2006), Rebecca Sewell in &quot;The Lying Game&quot; (2012–2013), and Lacy in &quot;The Expendables&quot; film series (2010–2012).

==Early life==
Carpenter was born in Las Vegas, Nevada, the only biological child of Christine, a bird sanctuary worker, and Don Carpenter, a salesman. She is of Spanish (from her maternal grandfather), French, and German descent. Carpenter attended Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas; she was also a part of a song-and-dance troupe which performed in the Las Vegas Valley when she was nine years old.

When Carpenter was 15, her family moved to Rosarito Beach, Baja California, Mexico and then to San Diego, California. She attended Bonita Vista High School and Chula Vista School of the Creative and Performing Arts. After graduation, Carpenter traveled throughout Europe. When she returned to San Diego, she worked as a video store clerk, an aerobics instructor, and in property management. In 1991, she worked as a cheerleader for the San Diego Chargers football team. In 1992, she moved to Los Angeles.

While swimming in San Diego in 1991, she and two male friends were attacked by Henry Hubbard Jr., a former San Diego police officer and serial rapist, who attempted to subdue them at gunpoint. During the struggle, both her friends and Hubbard were shot, forcing him to flee the scene; both friends survived the attack. Hubbard was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to 56 years in prison for a series of rapes and robberies. Carpenter brought Hubbard&#x27;s police-issue flashlight from the beach, which he had left at the scene, and the flashlight became a key piece of evidence used against him.

==Career==
Carpenter was discovered by a commercial agent while waiting tables in Los Angeles to save money for her college education. This led to her role on theatrical productions and more than twenty commercials. She made her first television role in 1994 by appearing in an episode of &quot;Baywatch&quot;. Shortly after that, she landed a starring role in the NBC short-lived teen drama/soap opera series &quot;Malibu Shores&quot;.

In 1996, Carpenter auditioned for the title role in The WB supernatural drama series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; but instead was cast as Cordelia Chase, a snobby and popular high school student. After three seasons on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, Carpenter was offered an even larger role as the same character on the spin-off series &quot;Angel&quot; alongside David Boreanaz. She played Cordelia Chase for four seasons on &quot;Angel&quot;. Although her character leaves the series during &quot;Angel&quot;″s fourth season, Carpenter returned for the 100th episode in the fifth and final season.
In 2004, Carpenter had a guest appearance in The WB fantasy drama series &quot;Charmed&quot; as a psychic demon named Kyra for three episodes and played a recurring role on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Miss Match&quot;, appearing in four episodes. She also had a recurring role as Kendall Casablancas in the UPN mystery drama series &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; for the 2005–06 season, appearing in 11 episodes. Carpenter guest-starred in the first-season finale of the ABC Family comedy-drama series &quot;Greek&quot; and reprised her role for two episodes of Season 2. According to TV Guide in September 2007, she was set to join the cast of &quot;The Apprentice: Celebrity Edition&quot;, but instead she chose to do a guest appearance in the Fox comedy series &quot;Back to You&quot; as well as a two episode role on the short-lived series &quot;Big Shots&quot;. Carpenter also had a guest appearance in an April 2009 episode of &quot;&quot; entitled &quot;The Descent of Man&quot;.

On March 20, 2008, Paley Fest hosted a &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; reunion. Carpenter attended the event alongside &quot;Buffy&quot; creator Joss Whedon, producers Marti Noxon and David Greenwalt, and other &quot;Buffy&quot; alumni including Sarah Michelle Gellar, Nicholas Brendon, James Marsters, Emma Caulfield, Amber Benson, Seth Green, and Michelle Trachtenberg.

Carpenter has starred in an assortment of made-for-TV and direct-to-video films including the sex comedy &quot;What Boys Like&quot;, the horror film &quot;Voodoo Moon&quot;, and the romantic comedies &quot;See Jane Date&quot; and &quot;Relative Chaos&quot; on ABC Family (the latter of which co-starred fellow Buffy alum Nicholas Brendon). She also appeared in the original films &quot;Flirting with Danger&quot; and &quot;Cheaters&#x27; Club&quot; (both 2006) both on Lifetime and the Syfy original film &quot;House of Bones&quot; broadcast in 2010, around the same time as her guest spot in &quot;Legend of the Seeker&quot;.

In 2009, Carpenter starred in production company Red Sparrow&#x27;s first film, &quot;Psychosis&quot;, which was released on January 11, 2011. In August 2010, she had a supporting role in Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s &quot;The Expendables&quot;. After the success of &quot;The Expendables&quot;, Carpenter was cast in &quot;Human Factor&quot; and in the indie thriller &quot;Crash Site&quot;. She appeared in an episode of the seventh season of &quot;Supernatural&quot; alongside &quot;Buffy&quot; co-star James Marsters. In 2012, Carpenter landed a recurring role as Rebecca Sewell in the first season of ABC Family drama series &quot;The Lying Game&quot;. She was upgraded to a series regular for the second season. Later in the same year, she reprised her role as Lacy in &quot;The Expendables 2&quot;.

On August 28, 2013, &quot;Surviving Evil&quot; (original working title: &quot;I Survived Evil&quot;) debuted on Investigation Discovery, with Carpenter as host; in the premiere episode, Carpenter herself was featured as a crime survivor, revisiting the horrific attack she and two friends suffered at the hands of violent serial rapist and police officer Henry Hubbard Jr. on San Diego&#x27;s Torrey Pines State Beach in 1991. She starred in the 2015 erotic film &quot;Bound&quot;, alongside Morgan Obenreder, which received a lukewarm reception. She later led the television film &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Secret&quot;.

==Public image==
Carpenter was named No. 31 on AskMen&#x27;s Top 99 Most Desirable Women 2002 and No. 44 on their 2005 list. Despite this, Carpenter has stated she does not view herself as a sex symbol.

Carpenter appeared on the cover and in a ten-page nude pictorial of the June 2004 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. When she was asked by &quot;People&quot; magazine in 2005 whether she would ever pose for &quot;Playboy&quot; again, she replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t know. I did &quot;Playboy&quot; for a very specific reason. Not only was it a good financial move, but it was about the place I was at in my life. I had just had my son and I&#x27;d gained 50 pounds during pregnancy. I wanted to get back to my old self. I wanted to feel desirable and sexy. So I thought, &#x27;What if I went full throttle&#x27;?&quot;

==Personal life==
Carpenter married Damian Hardy on October 5, 2002, in her hometown of Las Vegas. In March 2003, Carpenter gave birth to a son, Donovan Charles Hardy. In late 2007, the couple separated and their divorce was finalized on July 8, 2008. Carpenter is Catholic. 

In February 2021, Carpenter spoke out against director Joss Whedon in support of Ray Fisher who also claimed to have experienced a toxic environment at the hands of the director. She accused him of dismissing her from &quot;Angel&quot; because of her pregnancy.

<text>Lusatia (; ; ; ; ; ) is a historical region in Central Europe, territorially split between Germany and modern-day Poland. Lusatia stretches from the Bóbr and Kwisa rivers in the east to the Pulsnitz and Black Elster rivers in the west, and is located within the German states of Saxony and Brandenburg as well as in the Polish voivodeships of Lower Silesia and Lubusz. Major rivers of Lusatia are the Spree and the Lusatian Neisse, which defines the border between Germany and Poland. The Lusatian Mountains of the Western Sudetes separate Lusatia from Bohemia (Czech Republic) in the south. Lusatia is traditionally divided into Upper Lusatia, the hilly southern part, and Lower Lusatia, the flat northern part.

The areas east and west along the Spree in the German part of Lusatia are home to the Slavic Sorbs, one of Germany’s four officially recognized indigenous ethnic minorities. The Upper Sorbs inhabit Saxon Upper Lusatia, and the Lower Sorbs Brandenburgian Lower Lusatia. Upper and Lower Sorbian are spoken in the German parts of Upper and Lower Lusatia respectively, and the signage there is mostly bilingual. Throughout history, the region has been ruled variously by Poland, Bohemia, Germany and Hungary.

The Lusatian Lake District is Europe&#x27;s largest artificial lake district. The village of Herrnhut () is the seat of the Moravian Church. Muskau Park in Bad Muskau () and Łęknica is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Tropical Islands Resort, a large water park housed in a former airship hangar that is the biggest free-standing hall in the world, is located in the north of Lusatia. The closest international airport to Lusatia is Dresden Airport in Klotzsche ().

The largest Lusatian city is Cottbus (), with nearly 100,000 inhabitants. Other notable towns are the former members of the Lusatian League: the German/Polish twin towns of Görlitz () and Zgorzelec, Bautzen (), Zittau (), Lubań, Kamenz (), and Löbau ()), as well as Żary, the German/Polish twin towns of Guben () and Gubin, Hoyerswerda (), Senftenberg (), Eisenhüttenstadt (), and Spremberg ().

==Etymology==
The name derives from the Sorbian word &quot;łužicy&quot; meaning &quot;swamps&quot; or &quot;water-hole&quot;, Germanized as &quot;Lausitz&quot;. &quot;Lusatia&quot; is the Latinized form which spread in the English and Romance languages area.

==Geography==

Lusatia comprises two both scenically and historically different parts: a hilly southern &quot;upper&quot; section and a &quot;lower&quot; region, which belongs to the North European Plain. The border between Upper and Lower Lusatia is roughly marked by the course of the Black Elster river at Senftenberg and its eastern continuation toward the Silesian town of Przewóz on the Lusatian Neisse. Neighbouring regions were Silesia in the east, Bohemia in the south, the Margraviate of Meissen, and the Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg in the west as well as the Margraviate of Brandenburg (Mittelmark) in the north.

===Upper Lusatia===
Upper Lusatia (&quot;Oberlausitz&quot;, &quot;Łużyce Górne&quot; or &quot;Hornja Łužica&quot;) is today part of the German state of Saxony, except for a small part east of the Neisse River around Lubań, which now belongs to the Polish Lower Silesian voivodeship. It consists of hilly countryside rising in the South to the Lusatian Highlands near the Czech border, and then even higher to form the Zittau Hills, the small northern part of the Lusatian Mountains (&quot;Lužické hory&quot;/&quot;Lausitzer Gebirge&quot;) in the Czech Republic.

Upper Lusatia is characterized by fertile soil and undulating hills as well as by historic towns and cities such as Bautzen, Görlitz, Zittau, Löbau, Kamenz, Lubań, Bischofswerda, Herrnhut, Hoyerswerda, and Bad Muskau. Many villages in the very south of Upper Lusatia contain a typical attraction of the region, the so-called &quot;Umgebindehäuser&quot;, half-timbered-houses representing a combination of Franconian and Slavic style. Among those villages are Niedercunnersdorf, Obercunnersdorf, Wehrsdorf, Jonsdorf, Sohland an der Spree with Taubenheim, Oppach, Varnsdorf or Ebersbach.

===Lower Lusatia===

Most of the area belonging to the German state of Brandenburg today is called Lower Lusatia (&quot;Niederlausitz, Łużyce Dolne&quot; or &quot;Dolna Łužyca&quot;) and is characterized by forests and meadows. In the course of much of the 19th and the entire 20th century, it was shaped by the lignite industry and extensive open-pit mining. Important towns include Cottbus, Eisenhüttenstadt, Lübben, Lübbenau, Spremberg, Finsterwalde, Senftenberg (Zły Komorow), and Żary, which is now considered the capital of Polish Lusatia.

Between Upper and Lower Lusatia is a region called the &quot;Grenzwall&quot;, literally meaning &quot;border dyke&quot;, although it is in fact a morainic ridge. In the Middle Ages this area had dense forests, so it represented a major obstacle to civilian and military traffic. Some of the region&#x27;s villages were damaged or destroyed by the open-pit lignite mining industry during the DDR era. Some, now exhausted, former open-pit mines are now being converted into artificial lakes, with the hope of attracting holiday-makers, and the area is now being referred to as the Lusatian Lake District.

=== Lusatian capitals ===

As Lusatia is not, and never has been, a single administrative unit, Upper and Lower Lusatia have different, but in some respects similar, histories. The city of Cottbus is the largest in the region, and though it is recognized as the cultural capital of Lower Lusatia, it was a Brandenburg exclave since 1445. Historically, the administrative centres of Lower Lusatia were at Luckau and Lübben, while the historical capital of Upper Lusatia is Bautzen. Since 1945, when a small part of Lusatia east of the Oder–Neisse line was incorporated into Poland, Żary has been touted as the capital of Polish Lusatia.

===Lusatian Lake District===
The Lusatian Lake District (German: Lausitzer Seenland, Lower Sorbian: Łužyska jazorina, Upper Sorbian: Łužiska jězorina) is an artificially created lake area. By the end of the 2020s, Europe&#x27;s largest artificial water landscape and Germany&#x27;s fourth-largest lake area are to be created by flooding disused brown coal mines in the Lusatian brown coal mining area. Some of the largest lakes are connected to each other as a chain of lakes by navigable canals.

The new lakeland is largely created from remaining holes from former brown coal opencast mines. These are flooded and converted into lakes. Some of the resulting lakes have already reached their final water level, others will not be completely flooded for a few years.

Other lakes are artificially dammed lakes. While the Quitzdorf Dam was created to provide enough process water for the Boxberg Power Station, the Spremberg Dam was primarily planned for flood protection in the lake district, but was also used for process water for power plants. The Bautzen Reservoir was also artificially created in order to be able to continuously supply the Boxberg Power Station with water.

The ponds of the Upper Lusatian Heath and Pond Landscape Biosphere Reserve, which are also located in the Lake District area, were partly created in the Middle Ages, but also during the GDR period for agricultural reasons, as the moor-rich land was restructured and made usable. These very shallow waters are mostly used for fish farming.

The ponds of the Muskau Arch are also located between the large opencast mining holes. They arose from faults in the terminal moraine of glaciers from the Ice Age, and partly through the mining of soil raw materials such as sand, clay and coal even before industrialization. In general, these ponds are not created intentionally by humans, but are filled with water due to a lack of drainage.
===Muskau Morainic Arch===
The Muskau Morainic Arch is a terminal moraine formed during the Elster glaciation, which together with its immediate surroundings forms the &quot;UNESCO Global Geopark Muskau Morainic Arch&quot; (German: &quot;Muskauer Faltenbogen&quot;, Sorbian: &quot;Mužakowski Zahork&quot;, Polish: &quot;Łuk Mużakowa&quot;).

A glacier on the inland ice that was up to 500 m thick compressed the sand and brown coal layers in front of and below it over a length of more than 40 km to form a small-scale fold arch with a compression terminal moraine up to 180 m high and 700 m wide. The structure is currently preserved as a flat, undulating hill range and is almost unique in the world. The meltwater lake that subsequently emerged within the horseshoe was filled with clays. Ice advances in the following cold periods eroded the higher parts of the terminal moraine. Due to oxidation and the associated loss of volume in the areas near the surface of the brown coal seams, furrows of 3 m to 5 m, a maximum of 20 m deep, 10 m to 30 m wide and up to several kilometers long were formed. Known as &quot;Gieser&quot; (from the Sorbian &quot;jězor&quot; for &quot;lake&quot;), they form long stretches of drainless ditches that are either filled with standing water or often peat-covered. 

After already centuries of extraction of clay and sand, brown coal was mined in the area of the Muskau Arch in the 19th and 20th centuries, partly in pillar mining and partly in opencast mining. Due to the location of the mined seams, noticeably elongated lakes formed in the remaining holes north and east of Weißwasser after the end of mining.

===Upper Lusatian Heath and Pond Landscape===

The Upper Lusatian Heath and Pond Landscape (German: &quot;Oberlausitzer Heide- und Teichlandschaft&quot;, Upper Sorbian: &quot;Hornjołužiska hola a hatowa krajina&quot;) is the region richest in ponds in Germany, and together with the Lower Lusatian Pond Landscape forms the biggest pond landscape in Central Europe.

== History ==

===Early history===
According to the earliest records, the area was settled by culturally Celtic tribes. Later, around 100 BC, the Germanic Semnones settled in that area. The name of the region may be derived from that of the Ligians. From around 600 onwards, West Slavic tribes known as the Milceni and Lusici settled permanently in the region.

In the 10th century, the region came under the influence of the Kingdom of Germany, starting with the 928 eastern campaigns of King Henry the Fowler. Until 963 the Lusatian tribes were subdued by the Saxon margrave Gero and upon his death two years later, the March of Lusatia was established on the territory of today&#x27;s Lower Lusatia and remained with the Holy Roman Empire, while the adjacent Northern March again got lost in the Slavic uprising of 983. The later Upper Lusatian region of the Milceni lands up to the Silesian border at the Kwisa river at first was part of the Margraviate of Meissen under Margrave Eckard I.
At the same time the Polan duke of the later Kingdom of Poland raised claims to the Lusatian lands and upon the death of Emperor Otto III in 1002, Margrave Gero II lost Lusatia to the Polish Duke Boleslaw I the Brave, who took the region in his conquests, acknowledged by Henry II first in the same year in Merseburg and later in the 1018 Peace of Bautzen, Lusatia became part of his territory; however, Germans and Poles continued to struggle over the administration of the region. It was regained in a 1031 campaign by Emperor Conrad II in favour of the Saxon German rulers of the Meissen House of Wettin and the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg, who purchased the March of (Lower) Lusatia in 1303.

In 1367 the Brandenburg elector Otto V of Wittelsbach finally sold Lower Lusatia to King Karel of Bohemia, thereby becoming a Bohemian crown land.

=== Bohemian rule ===

As Margrave Egbert II of Meissen supported anti-king Rudolf of Rheinfelden during the Investiture Controversy, King Henry IV of Germany in 1076 awarded the Milceni lands of Upper Lusatia as a fief to the Bohemian duke Vratislav II. After Emperor Frederick Barbarossa had elevated Duke Vladislaus II to the rank of a King of Bohemia in 1158, the Upper Lusatian lands around Bautzen evolved into a Bohemian crown land. Around 1200, large numbers of German settlers came to Lusatia in the course of the &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot;, settling in the forested areas yet not inhabited by the Slavs. For centuries, from as early as the Middle Ages, trade flourished, and several important trade routes ran through Lusatia, connecting German states in the west, Poland in the east and Bohemia in the south. In 1319, the region was divided between the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Duchy of Jawor, the southwesternmost duchy of fragmented Piast-ruled Poland, while northernmost parts also passed to the Margraviate of Brandenburg in the following years. From 1368, it was entirely part of the Bohemian Crown.

In 1346 six Upper Lusatian cities formed the Lusatian League to resist the constant attacks conducted by robber barons. The association supported King Sigismund in the Hussite Wars leading to armed attacks and devastation. The cities were represented in the (Upper) Lusatian &quot;Landtag&quot; assembly, where they met with the fierce opposition of the noble state countries. In 1469 the region passed to Hungary, and in 1490 it returned to the Bohemian Crown, then under the rule of Polish Prince Vladislaus II.

Following the Lutheran Reformation, the greater part of Lusatia became Protestant except for the area between Bautzen, Kamenz and Hoyerswerda. The Lusatias remained under Bohemian rule – from 1526 onwards under the rule of the House of Habsburg – until the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

=== Saxon rule ===
According to the 1635 Peace of Prague, most of Lusatia became a province of the Electorate of Saxony, except for the region around Cottbus possessed by Brandenburg. After the Saxon elector Augustus the Strong was elected king of Poland in 1697, Lusatia became strategically important as the elector-kings sought to create a land connection between their Saxon homelands and the Polish territories. Two main routes connecting Warsaw and Dresden ran through the region in the 18th century and Kings Augustus II the Strong and Augustus III of Poland often traveled the routes. Numerous Polish dignitaries also traveled through Lusatia on several occasions, and some Polish nobles owned estates in Lusatia. A distinct remnant of the region&#x27;s ties to Poland are the 18th-century mileposts decorated with the coat of arms of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth located in various towns in the region. Polish-Sorbian contacts increased in that period. With the Age of Enlightenment, the Sorbian national revival began and resistance to Germanization emerged.
Herrnhut, between Löbau and Zittau, founded in 1722 by religious refugees from Moravia on the estate of Count Nicolaus Zinzendorf became the starting point of the organized Protestant missionary movement in 1732 and missionaries went out from the Moravian Church in Herrnhut to all corners of the world to share the Gospel.

The newly established Kingdom of Saxony, however, sided with Napoleon; therefore, at the 1815 Congress of Vienna, Lusatia was divided, with Lower Lusatia and the northeastern part of Upper Lusatia around Hoyerswerda, Rothenburg, Görlitz, and Lauban awarded to Prussia. Only the southwestern part of Upper Lusatia, which included Löbau, Kamenz, Bautzen, and Zittau, remained part of Saxony.

=== Prussian rule ===
The Lusatians in Prussia demanded that their land become a distinct administrative unit, but Lower Lusatia was incorporated into the Province of Brandenburg, while the Upper Lusatian territories were attached to the Province of Silesia instead.

One of the main escape routes for insurgents of the unsuccessful Polish November Uprising from partitioned Poland to the Great Emigration led through Lübben and Luckau.

The 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed an era of cultural revival for Sorbs. The modern languages of Upper and Lower Lusatian (or Sorbian) emerged, national literature flourished, and many national organizations such as Maćica Serbska and Domowina were founded. There were also notable Polish communities in Lusatia, such as Klettwitz (, ), inhabited in the 1930s by some 550 Poles.

In the interbellum, the German government carried out a massive campaign of changing of place names in Lusatia in order to erase traces of Slavic origin, and while most of the historic names were restored after World War II, some were retained.

This era came to an end during the Nazi regime in Germany, when all Sorbian organizations were abolished and forbidden, newspapers and magazines closed, and any use of the Sorbian languages was prohibited. During World War II, some Sorbian activists were arrested, executed, exiled or sent as political prisoners to concentration camps. From 1942 to 1944 the underground Lusatian National Committee was formed and was active in German-occupied Warsaw.

During the war, the Germans established and operated several prisoner-of-war camps, including Oflag III-C, Oflag IV-D, Oflag 8, Stalag III-B, Stalag IV-A and Stalag VIII-A, with multiple forced labour subcamps in the region. Prisoners included Polish POWs and civilians, and French, Belgian, British, Australian, New Zealander, Canadian, South African, Dutch, Italian, Soviet, Serbian, Slovak and American POWs. There were also several Nazi prisons with multiple forced labour subcamps, including in Görlitz, Luckau, Zittau, and a prison solely for women in Cottbus, and multiple subcamps of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, the prisoners of which were mostly Jews, Poles and Russians, but also Frenchmen, Italians, Yugoslavs, Czechs, Belgians, etc.
During the war, the Poles postulated that after the defeat of Germany, the Sorbs should be allowed free national development either within the borders of Poland or Czechoslovakia, or as an independent Sorbian state in alliance with Poland.

The Eastern Front reached Lusatia in early 1945, with Soviet and Polish troops defeating the Germans and capturing the region. In Horka, on April 26, 1945, the Germans carried out a massacre of a field hospital column of the 9th Polish Armored Division, killing some 300 POWs, mostly wounded soldiers and medical personnel (see &quot;German atrocities committed against Polish prisoners of war&quot;).

=== Since 1945 ===

After World War II according to the Potsdam Agreement, Lusatia was divided between Allied-occupied Germany (Soviet occupation zone) and the Republic of Poland along the Oder–Neisse line. Poland&#x27;s communist government expelled all remaining Germans and Sorbs from the area east of the Neisse river in 1945 and 1946 in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The Lusatian National Committee in Prague claimed the right to self-government and separation from Germany and the creation of a Lusatian Free State or attachment to Czechoslovakia. The majority of the Sorbian intelligentsia was organized in the Domowina, though, and did not wish to split from Germany. Claims asserted by the Lusatian National movement were postulates of joining Lusatia to Poland or Czechoslovakia. Between 1945 and 1947 they produced about ten memorials to the United States, Soviet Union, Great Britain, France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia; however, this did not bring any results. On 30 April 1946, the Lusatian National Committee also submitted a petition to the Polish Government, signed by Paweł Cyż – the minister and an official Sorbian delegate in Poland. There was also a project to proclaim a Lusatian Free State, whose Prime Minister was intended to be the Polish archaeologist of Lusatian origin, Wojciech Kóčka.

In 1945, the northeastern part of Upper Lusatia west of the Neisse rejoined Saxony and in 1952, when the state was divided into three administrative areas (&quot;Bezirke&quot;), the Upper Lusatian region became part of the Dresden administrative region. After the East German Revolution of 1989, the state of Saxony was reestablished in 1990. Lower Lusatia remained with Brandenburg, from 1952 until 1990 in the &quot;Bezirk&quot; of Cottbus.

In 1950, the Sorbs obtained language and cultural autonomy within the then–East German state of Saxony. Lusatian schools and magazines were launched and the Domowina association was revived, although under increasing political control of the ruling Communist Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). At the same time, the large German-speaking majority of the Upper Lusatian population kept up a considerable degree of local, &#x27;Upper Lusatian&#x27; patriotism of its own. An attempt to establish a Lusatian &quot;Land&quot; within the Federal Republic of Germany failed after German reunification in 1990. The constitutions of Saxony and Brandenburg guarantee cultural rights, but not autonomy, to the Sorbs.

==Demographics==

===Sorbs===
More than 80,000 of the Sorbian Slavic minority continue to live in the region. Historically, their ancestors are West-Slavic-speaking tribes such as the Milceni, who settled in the region between the Elbe and the Saale. Many still speak their language (though numbers are dwindling and especially Lower Sorbian is considered endangered), and road signs are usually bilingual. However, the number of all the inhabitants of this part of eastern Saxony is declining rapidly – by 20% in the last 10 to 15 years. Sorbs make efforts to protect their traditional culture manifested in the traditional folk costumes and the style of village houses. The coal industry in the region (like the Schwarze Pumpe power station needing vast areas of land) destroyed dozens of Lusatian villages in the past and threatens some of them even now. The Sorbian language is taught at many primary and some secondary schools and at two universities (Leipzig and Prague). Project &quot;Witaj&quot; (&quot;welcome!&quot;) is a project of eight preschools where Sorbian is currently the main language for a few hundred Lusatian children.

There is a daily newspaper in the Sorbian language (&quot;Serbske Nowiny&quot;); a Sorbian radio station (Serbski Rozhłós) uses local frequencies of two otherwise German-speaking radio stations for several hours a day. There are very limited programmes on television (once a month) in Sorbian on two regional television stations (RBB and MDR TV).

In 2020, despite the loss of the Sorbian language in most of Lusatia, there are some Sorbian traditions and habits that still live on to this day. In February, many people (mostly people from villages, regardless of German or Sorbian ancestry) will still engage in the Sorbian tradition of &quot;Zampern&quot; (a festive procession)&quot;.&quot; Some Sorbian dishes like boiled potatoes with linseed oil and curd (German: &quot;Quark mit Leineöl&quot;) are still prevalent and, today, are eaten in other parts of Germany (like Berlin or western Saxony) too. &quot;Spreewälder Gurken&quot; (pickled cucumbers potted by using a special mixture of herbs and spices) are often associated with the Sorbs even though the cucumbers themselves were introduced by Dutch migrants, who started to pickle them for higher durability. Soon Sorbs adopted the pickling and might have changed the recipes slightly over time.

The traditional Sorbian costumes are still to be worn in the Spreewald region even though mainly in the tourism industry. Recently, some women started to revive traditional clothes by using them as wedding dresses, even though this practise differs from original traditions.

===Demographics in 1900===
Percentage of Sorbs:
*Cottbus (Chóśebuz) (Province of Brandenburg) 55.8%
*Hoyerswerda (Wojerecy) (Province of Silesia) 37.8%
*Bautzen (Budyšin) (Kingdom of Saxony) 17.7%
*Rothenburg, Oberlausitz (Rózbork) (Province of Silesia) 17.2%
*Kamenz (Kamjenc) (Kingdom of Saxony) 7.1%
Total number: 93,032

The percentage of Serbs (Sorbs) in Lusatia has decreased since the 1900 census due to intermarriage, germanization, cultural assimilation related to industrialization and urbanization, Nazi suppression and discrimination, ethnocide and the settlement of expelled Germans after World War II, mainly from Lower Silesia and northern Bohemia.

=== Largest cities ===
==Culture==
===Sights===
The region is rich in architecture from various reigns, including Czech, Polish, German and Hungarian, whose styles range from Romanesque and Gothic through Renaissance and Baroque to modern architecture.

There are two major Sorbian museums in Cottbus (&quot;Serbski muzej Chóśebuz&quot;) and Bautzen (&quot;Serbski muzej Budyšin&quot;).

In Poland, notable museums include the &quot;Muzeum Łużyckie&quot; (&quot;Lusatian Museum&quot;) in Zgorzelec and the &quot;Muzeum Pogranicza Śląsko-Łużyckiego&quot; (&quot;Museum of Silesian-Lusatian Borderland&quot;) in Żary.

Zgorzelec is home to one of Poland&#x27;s largest war cemeteries.

The CargoLifter airship hangar that now houses the Tropical Islands Resort is the largest freebearing hall in the world.

The Saurierpark Kleinwelka is Germany&#x27;s largest dinosaur park.

====UNESCO world heritage sites====

The Muskau Park in Bad Muskau (&quot;Mužakow&quot;) and Łęknica is a World Heritage Site and Historic Monument of Poland.

Herrnhut is also a UNESCO world heritage site since 2024.

The Spree Forest as well as the Upper Lusatian Heath and Pond Landscape are UNESCO  biosphere reserves.

<text>Novartis AG is a Swiss multinational pharmaceutical corporation based in Basel, Switzerland. Consistently ranked in the global top five, Novartis is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world and was the fourth largest by revenue in 2022.

Novartis manufactures the drugs clozapine (Clozaril), diclofenac (Voltaren; sold to GlaxoSmithKline in 2015 deal), carbamazepine (Tegretol), valsartan (Diovan), imatinib mesylate (Gleevec/Glivec), cyclosporine (Neoral/Sandimmune), letrozole (Femara), methylphenidate (Ritalin; production ceased 2020), terbinafine (Lamisil), deferasirox (Exjade), and others.

Novartis was formed in 1996 by the merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz. It was considered the largest corporate merger in history during that time. The pharmaceutical and agrochemical divisions of both companies formed Novartis as an independent entity. The name Novartis was based on the Latin terms, &quot;novae artes&quot; (new skills).

After the merger, other Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz businesses were sold, or, like Ciba Specialty Chemicals, spun off as independent companies. The Sandoz brand disappeared for three years, but was revived in 2003 when Novartis consolidated its generic drugs businesses into a single subsidiary and named it Sandoz. Novartis divested its agrochemical and genetically modified crops business in 2000 with the spinout of Syngenta in partnership with AstraZeneca, which also divested its agrochemical business. The new company also acquired a series of acquisitions in order to strengthen its core businesses.

Novartis is a full member of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA). Novartis is the third most valuable pharmaceutical company in Europe, after Novo Nordisk and Roche.

==History==
Novartis was created in March 1996 and began operations on 20 December from the merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz Laboratories, both Swiss companies.

===Ciba-Geigy===
Ciba-Geigy was formed in 1970 by the merger of J. R. Geigy Ltd (founded in Basel in 1857) and CIBA (founded in Basel in 1859).

Ciba began in 1859, when Alexander Clavel (1805–1873) took up the production of fuchsine in his factory for silk-dyeing works in Basel. By 1873, he sold his dye factory to the company Bindschedler and Busch. In 1884, Bindschedler and Busch was transformed into a joint-stock company named &quot;&quot; (Company for Chemical Industry Basel). The acronym, CIBA, was adopted as the company&#x27;s name in 1945.

The foundation for Geigy was established in 1857, when Johann Rudolf Geigy-Merian (1830–1917) and Johann Muller-Pack acquired a site in Basel, where they built a dyewood mill and a dye extraction plant. Two years later, they began the production of synthetic fuchsine. In 1901, they formed the public limited company Geigy, and the name of the company was changed to J. R. Geigy Ltd in 1914.

CIBA and Geigy merged in 1970 to form Ciba‑Geigy Ltd. .

===Mid-1990s controversy===
In the mid-1990s, state and federal health and environmental agencies identified an increased incidence of childhood cancers in Toms River, New Jersey, from the 1970–1995 period. Multiple investigations by state and federal environmental and health agencies indicated that the likely source of the increased cancer risk was contamination from Toms River Chemical Plant (then operated by Ciba-Geigy), which had been in operation since 1952, and the Reich Farm/Union Carbide.
The area was designated a United States Environmental Protection Agency Superfund site in 1983 after an underground plume of toxic chemicals was identified. The following year, a discharge pipe was shut down after a sinkhole at the corner of Bay Avenue and Vaughn Avenue revealed that it had been leaking. The plant ceased operation in 1996. A follow-up study from the 1996–2000 period indicated that while there were more cancer cases than expected, rates had significantly fallen and the difference was statistically insignificant compared to normal statewide cancer rates. Since 1996, the Toms River water system has been subject to the most stringent water testing in New Jersey and is considered safe for consumption. Dan Fagin&#x27;s &quot;Toms River: A Story of Science and Salvation&quot;, the 2014 Pulitzer Prize winning book, examined the issue of industrial pollution at the site in detail.

===Sandoz===
Sandoz is the generic drugs division of Novartis. Before the 1996 merger with Ciba-Geigy to form Novartis, Sandoz Pharmaceuticals (Sandoz AG) was a pharmaceutical company headquartered in Basel, Switzerland (as was Ciba-Geigy), and was best known for developing drugs such as Sandimmune for organ transplantation, the antipsychotic Clozaril, Mellaril Tablets and Serentil Tablets for treating psychiatric disorders, and Cafergot Tablets and Torecan Suppositories for treating migraine headaches.

The &quot;Chemiefirma Kern und Sandoz&quot; (&quot;Kern and Sandoz Chemistry Firm&quot;) was founded in 1886 by Alfred Kern (1850–1893) and Edouard Sandoz (1853–1928). The first dyes manufactured by them were alizarinblue and auramine. After Kern&#x27;s death, the partnership became the corporation &quot;Chemische Fabrik vormals Sandoz&quot; in 1895. The company began producing the fever-reducing drug antipyrin in the same year. In 1899, the company began producing the sugar substitute saccharin. Further pharmaceutical research began in 1917 under Arthur Stoll (1887–1971), who is the founder of Sandoz&#x27;s pharmaceutical department in 1917. In 1918, Arthur Stoll isolated ergotamine from ergot; the substance was eventually used to treat migraine and headaches and was introduced under the trade name Gynergen in 1921.

Between the World Wars, Gynergen (1921) and Calcium-Sandoz (1929) were brought to market. Sandoz also produced chemicals for textiles, paper, and leather, beginning in 1929. In 1939, the company began producing agricultural chemicals.

The psychedelic effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) were discovered at the Sandoz laboratories in 1943 by Arthur Stoll and Albert Hofmann. Sandoz began clinical trials and marketed the substance, from 1947 through the mid-1960s, under the name &quot;Delysid&quot; as a psychiatric drug, thought useful for treating a wide variety of mental ailments, ranging from alcoholism to sexual deviancy. Sandoz suggested in its marketing literature that psychiatrists take LSD themselves, to gain a better subjective understanding of the schizophrenic experience, and many did exactly that and so did other scientific researchers. The Sandoz product received mass publicity as early as 1954, in a &quot;Time&quot; magazine feature. Research on LSD peaked in the 1950s and early 1960s. The CIA purchased quantities of LSD from Sandoz for use in its illegal human experimentation program known as MKUltra. Sandoz withdrew the drug from the market in 1965. The drug became a cultural novelty of the 1960s after psychologist Timothy Leary at Harvard University began to promote its use for recreational and spiritual experiences among the general public.

Sandoz opened its first foreign offices in 1964. In 1967, Sandoz merged with Wander AG (known for Ovomaltine and Isostar). Sandoz acquired the companies Delmark, Wasabröd (a Swedish manufacturer of crisp bread), and Gerber Products Company (a baby food company). On 1 November 1986, a fire broke out in a production plant storage room, which led to the Sandoz chemical spill and a large amount of pesticide being released into the upper Rhine river. This exposure killed many fish and other aquatic life. In 1995, Sandoz spun off its specialty chemicals business to form Clariant. In 1997, Clariant merged with the specialty chemicals business that was spun off from Hoechst AG in Germany.

===Merger===
In 1996, Ciba-Geigy merged with Sandoz, with the pharmaceutical and agrochemical divisions of both staying together to form Novartis. Other Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz businesses were spun off as independent companies. notably Ciba Specialty Chemicals. Sandoz&#x27;s Master Builders Technologies, a producer of chemicals for the construction industry, was sold off to SKW Trostberg A.G., a subsidiary of the German energy company VIAG, while its North American corn herbicide business became part of the German chemical maker BASF.

===Post-merger===
In 1998, the company entered into a biotechnology licensing agreement with the University of California at Berkeley Department of Plant and Microbial Biology. Critics of the agreement expressed concern over prospects that the agreement would diminish academic objectivity, or lead to the commercialization of genetically modified plants. The agreement expired in 2003.

====2000–2010====
In 2000, Novartis and AstraZeneca combined their agrobusiness divisions to create a new company, Syngenta.

In 2003, Novartis organized all its generics businesses into one division, and merged some of its subsidiaries into one company, reusing the predecessor brand name of Sandoz.

In 2005, Novartis expanded its subsidiary Sandoz significantly through the US$8.29 billion acquisition of Hexal, one of Germany&#x27;s leading generic drug companies, and Eon Labs, a fast-growing United States generic pharmaceutical company.

In 2006, Novartis acquired the California-based Chiron Corporation. Chiron had been divided into three units: Chiron Vaccines, Chiron Blood Testing, and Chiron BioPharmaceuticals. The biopharmaceutical unit was integrated into Novartis Pharmaceuticals, while the vaccines and blood testing units were made into a new Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics division. Also in 2006, Sandoz became the first company to have a biosimilar drug approved in Europe with its recombinant human growth hormone drug.

In 2007, Novartis sold the Gerber Products Company to Nestlé as part of its continuing effort to shed old Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy businesses and focus on healthcare.

In 2009, Novartis reached an agreement to acquire an 85 percent stake in the Chinese vaccines company Zhejiang Tianyuan Bio-Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. as part of a strategic initiative to build a vaccines industry leader in this country and expand the group&#x27;s limited presence in this fast-growing market segment. This proposed acquisition will require government and regulatory approvals in China.

In 2010, Novartis offered to pay US$39.3 billion to fully acquire Alcon, the world&#x27;s largest eye-care company, including a majority stake held by Nestlé. Novartis had bought 25 percent of Alcon in 2008. Novartis created a new division and called it Alcon, under which it placed its CIBA VISION subsidiary and Novartis Ophthalmics, which became the second-largest division of Novartis. The total cost for Alcon amounted to $60 billion.

====2011–present====
In 2011, Novartis acquired the medical laboratory diagnostics company Genoptix to &quot;serve as a strong foundation for our (Novartis&#x27;) individualized treatment programs&quot;.

In 2012, the Company cut approximately 2,000 positions in the United States, primarily in sales, in response to anticipated revenue downturns from the hypertension drug Diovan, which was losing patent protection, and the realization that the anticipated successor to Diovan, Rasilez, was failing in clinical trials. The 2012 personnel reductions follow ~2000 cut positions in Switzerland and the United States in 2011, ~1400 cut positions in the United States in 2010, and a reduction of &quot;thousands&quot; and several site closures in previous years. Also in 2012, Novartis became the biggest manufacturer of generic skin care medicine, after agreeing to buy Fougera Pharmaceuticals for $1.525 billion in cash.

In 2013, the Indian Supreme Court issued a decision rejecting Novartis&#x27; patent application in India on the final form of Gleevec, Novartis&#x27;s cancer drug; the case caused great controversy.

==Corporate structure==
Novartis AG is a publicly traded Swiss holding company that operates through the Novartis Group and owns, directly or indirectly, all companies worldwide that operate as subsidiaries of the Novartis Group.

Novartis&#x27;s businesses are divided into two operating divisions: Innovative Medicines and Sandoz (generics). The eye-care division Alcon was spun off into an independent company in April 2019. In August 2022, Novartis announced plans to spin off Sandoz as part of restructuring. The spin-off was completed in October 2023.

The Innovative Medicines business is made up of two commercial units: Innovative Medicines International and Innovative Medicines US. The two business units combine the pharmaceutical and oncology divisions and commercially focus on global and US market respectively.

Novartis operates directly through subsidiaries, each of which fall under one of the divisions, and that Novartis categorizes as fulfilling one or more of the following functions: Holding/Finance, Sales, Production, and Research

Novartis AG also held 33.3 percent of the shares of Roche until 2022, however it did not exercise control over Roche. Novartis also has two significant license agreements with Genentech, a Roche subsidiary. One agreement is for Lucentis; the other is for Xolair.

In 2014, Novartis established a center in Hyderabad, India, in order to offshore several of its R&amp;D, clinical development, medical writing and administrative functions. The center supports the drug major&#x27;s operations in the pharmaceuticals (Novartis), eye care (Alcon), and generic drugs segments (Sandoz).

==Place in its market segments==

Novartis is the world&#x27;s first largest in life sciences and agribusiness markets. It is also the second-largest pharmaceutical company by market cap in 2019. 
*Alcon: At the time Novartis bought Alcon, they had annual sales of $6.5 billion and a net income of $2 billion. In April 2019, Novartis completed the spin-off of Alcon as a separate commercial entity.
*Sandoz: , Sandoz has been recognized as the world&#x27;s second-largest generic drug company. Sandoz&#x27; biosimilars lead its field, getting the first biosimilar approvals in the EU. In 2018, Sandoz reported US$9.9 billion in net sales. In August 2022, Novartis announced plans to spin off Sandoz by second half of 2023.
*Vaccines and Diagnostics Division: In 2013, Novartis announced it was considering selling the vaccines and diagnostics division off. This sale was completed in late 2015, and the division was integrated into CSL&#x27;s BioCSL operation, with the combined entity trading as Seqirus. In 2018, Novartis sold its consumer healthcare joint venture vaccines division to GlaxoSmithKline for US$13.0 billion.
*Consumer: Novartis is not a leader in the over-the-counter or animal health segments; its leading OTC brands are Excedrin and Theraflu, but sales have been slowed by problems at its key US manufacturing plant.

In 2018, Novartis ranked second on the Access to Medicine Index, which &quot;ranks companies on how readily they make their products available to the world&#x27;s poor.&quot;

=== Finance ===
As of January 31, 2025, Novartis shares traded at over $104.72 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at $210.39B.
=== Pricing ===

==== Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) ====
In 2023, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) identified Entresto as one of five high-expenditure drugs that experienced significant net price increases without new clinical evidence to justify the hikes. Specifically, Entresto&#x27;s wholesale acquisition cost rose by 7%, leading to an additional $72 million in costs to U.S. payers.

==Research==

The company&#x27;s global research operations, called &quot;Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR)&quot; have their global headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. Two research institutes reside within NIBR that focus on diseases in the developing world: Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases, which works on tuberculosis, dengue, and malaria, and Novartis Vaccines Institute for Global Health, which works on salmonella typhi (typhoid fever) and shigella.

Novartis is also involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects, with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox project. The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative of EFPIA and the European Commission.

Novartis is working with Science 37 in order to allow video based telemedicine visits instead of physical traveling to clinics for patients. It is planning for ten clinical trials over three years using mobile technology to help free patients from burdensome hospital trips.

==Controversies and criticism==
===Challenge to India&#x27;s patent laws===
Novartis fought a seven-year, controversial battle to patent Gleevec in India, and took the case all the way to the Indian Supreme Court, where the patent application was finally rejected. The patent application at the center of the case was filed by Novartis in India in 1998, after India had agreed to enter the World Trade Organization and to abide by worldwide intellectual property standards under the TRIPS agreement. As part of this agreement, India made changes to its patent law; the biggest of which was that prior to these changes, patents on products were not allowed, afterwards they were, albeit with restrictions. These changes came into effect in 2005, so Novartis&#x27; patent application waited in a &quot;mailbox&quot; with others until then, under procedures that India instituted to manage the transition. India also passed certain amendments to its patent law in 2005, just before the laws came into effect, which played a key role in the rejection of the patent application.

The patent application claimed the final form of Gleevec (the beta crystalline form of imatinib mesylate). In 1993 before India allowed patents on products, Novartis had patented imatinib, with salts vaguely specified, in many countries but could not patent it in India. The key differences between the two patent applications were that the 1998 patent application specified the counterion (Gleevec is a specific salt—imatinib mesylate) while the 1993 patent application did not claim any specific salts nor did it mention mesylate, and the 1998 patent application specified the solid form of Gleevec—the way the individual molecules are packed together into a solid when the drug itself is manufactured (this is separate from processes by which the drug itself is formulated into pills or capsules)—while the 1993 patent application did not. The solid form of imatinib mesylate in Gleevec is beta crystalline.

As provided under the TRIPS agreement, Novartis applied for Exclusive Marketing Rights (EMR) for Gleevec from the Indian Patent Office and the EMR was granted in November 2003. Novartis made use of the EMR to obtain orders against some generic manufacturers who had already launched Gleevec in India. Novartis set the price of Gleevec at US$2666 per patient per month; generic companies were selling their versions at US$177 to 266 per patient per month. Novartis also initiated a program to assist patients who could not afford its version of the drug, concurrent with its product launch.

When examination of Novartis&#x27; patent application began in 2005, it came under immediate attack from oppositions initiated by generic companies that were already selling Gleevec in India and by advocacy groups. The application was rejected by the patent office and by an appeal board. The key basis for the rejection was the part of Indian patent law that was created by amendment in 2005, describing the patentability of new uses for known drugs and modifications of known drugs. That section, Paragraph 3d, specified that such inventions are patentable only if &quot;they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy.&quot; At one point, Novartis went to court to try to invalidate Paragraph 3d; it argued that the provision was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated TRIPS. Novartis lost that case and did not appeal. Novartis did appeal the rejection by the patent office to India&#x27;s Supreme Court, which took the case.

The Supreme Court case hinged on the interpretation of Paragraph 3d. The Supreme Court decided that the substance that Novartis sought to patent was indeed a modification of a known drug (the raw form of imatinib, which was publicly disclosed in the 1993 patent application and in scientific articles), that Novartis did not present evidence of a difference in therapeutic efficacy between the final form of Gleevec and the raw form of imatinib, and that therefore the patent application was properly rejected by the patent office and lower courts.

Although the court ruled narrowly, and took care to note that the subject application was filed during a time of transition in Indian patent law, the decision generated widespread global news coverage and reignited debates on balancing public good with monopolistic pricing, innovation with affordability etc.

Had Novartis won and had its patent issued, it could not have prevented generics companies in India from selling generic Gleevec, but it could have obliged them to pay a reasonable royalty under a grandfather clause included in India&#x27;s patent law.

In reaction to the decision, Ranjit Shahani, vice-chairman and managing director of Novartis India Ltd was quoted as saying &quot;This ruling is a setback for patients that will hinder medical progress for diseases without effective treatment options.&quot; He also said that companies like Novartis would invest less money in research in India as a result of the ruling. Novartis also emphasised that it continues to be committed to good access to its drugs; according to Novartis, by 2013, &quot;95% of patients in India—roughly 16,000 people—receive Glivec free of charge... and it has provided more than $1.7 billion worth of Glivec to Indian patients in its support program since it was started...&quot;

===Sexual discrimination===
On 17 May 2010, a jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York awarded $3,367,250 in compensatory damages against Novartis, finding that the company had committed sexual discrimination against twelve female sales representatives and entry-level managers since 2002, in matters of pay, promotion, and treatment after learning that the employees were pregnant. Two months later the company settled with the remaining plaintiffs for $152.5 million plus attorney fees.

===Marketing violations===
In September 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sent a notice to Novartis Pharmaceuticals regarding its advertising of Focalin XR, an ADHD drug, in which the company overstated its efficacy while marketing to the public and medical professionals.

In 2005, federal prosecutors opened an investigation into Novartis&#x27; marketing of several drugs: Trileptal, an antiseizure drug; three drugs for heart conditions—Diovan (the company&#x27;s top-selling product), Exforge, and Tekturna; Sandostatin, a drug to treat a growth hormone disorder; and Zelnorm, a drug for irritable bowel syndrome. In September 2010, Novartis agreed to pay US$422.5 million in criminal and civil claims and to enter into a corporate integrity agreement with the US Office of the Inspector General. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Federal prosecutors accused Novartis of paying illegal kickbacks to health care professionals through speaker programs, advisory boards, entertainment, travel and meals. But aside from pleading guilty to one misdemeanor charge of mislabeling in an agreement that Novartis announced in February, the company denied wrongdoing.&quot; In the same New York Times article, Frank Lichtenberg, a Columbia professor who receives pharmaceutical financing for research on innovation in the industry, said off-label prescribing was encouraged by the American Medical Association and paid for by insurers, but off-label marketing was clearly illegal. &quot;So it&#x27;s not surprising that they would settle because they don&#x27;t have a legal leg to stand on.&quot;

In April 2013, federal prosecutors filed two lawsuits against Novartis under the False Claims Act for off-label marketing and kickbacks; in both suits, prosecutors are seeking treble damages. The first suit &quot;accused Novartis of inducing pharmacies to switch thousands of kidney transplant patients to its immunosuppressant drug Myfortic in exchange for kickbacks disguised as rebates and discounts&quot;. In the second, the Justice Department joined a &quot;qui tam&quot;, or whistleblower, lawsuit brought by a former sales rep over off-label marketing of three drugs: Lotrel and Valturna (both hypertension drugs), and the diabetes drug, Starlix. Twenty-seven states, the District of Columbia and Chicago and New York also joined.

===Avastin===
Outside the US, Novartis markets the drug ranibizumab (trade name Lucentis), which is a monoclonal antibody fragment derived from the same parent mouse antibody as bevacizumab (Avastin). Both Avastin and Lucentis were created by Genentech which is owned by Roche; Roche markets Avastin worldwide, and also markets Lucentis in the US. Lucentis has been approved worldwide as a treatment for wet macular degeneration and other retinal disorders; Avastin is used to treat certain cancers. Because the price of Lucentis is much higher than Avastin, many ophthalmologists began having compounding pharmacies formulate Avastin for administration to the eye and began treating their patients with Avastin. In 2011, four trusts of the National Health Service in the UK issued policies approving use and payment for administering Avastin for macular degeneration, in order to save money, even though Avastin had not been approved for that indication. In April 2012, after failing to persuade the trusts that it was uncertain whether Avastin was as safe and effective as Lucentis, and in order to retain the market for Lucentis, Novartis announced it would sue the trusts. However, in July Novartis offered significant discounts (kept confidential) to the trusts, and the trusts agreed to change their policy, and in November, Novartis dropped the litigation.

===Valsartan===
In the summer of 2013, two Japanese universities retracted several publications of clinical trials that purported to show that Valsartan (branded as Diovan) had cardiovascular benefits, when it was found that statistical analysis had been manipulated, and that a Novartis employee had participated in the statistical analysis but had not disclosed his relationship with Novartis but only his affiliation with Osaka City University, where he was a lecturer. As a result, several Japanese hospitals stopped using the drug, and media outlets ran reports on the scandal in Japan. In January 2014 Japan&#x27;s Health Ministry filed a criminal complaint with the Tokyo public prosecutor&#x27;s office against Novartis and an unspecified number of employees, for allegedly misleading consumers through advertisements that used the research to support the benefits of Diovan. On 1 July 2014 the prosecutor&#x27;s office announced it was formally charging the company and one of its employees.

===Corruption===
In January 2018, Novartis began being investigated by US and Greek authorities for allegedly bribing Greek public officials in the 2006–2015 period, in a scheme which included two former prime ministers, several former health ministers, many high ranking party members of the Nea Dimokratia and PASOK ruling parties, as well as bankers. The manager of Novartis&#x27; Greek branch was prohibited from leaving the country. The minister&#x27;s deputy described the allegations as &quot;the biggest scandal since the creation of the Greek state&quot;, which caused &quot;annual state expenditure on medicine to explode&quot;. Most of the ministers involved in the scandal have denied the allegations and sought to paint the case as &quot;political targeting&quot; and &quot;fabrication&quot; by the Syriza opposition party. However, the Greek Judicial Council ruled that the scandal was real. Besides bribery that involves artificial increases in the price of several medicines, the case also involves money laundering, with suspicions of &quot;illegal funds of more than four billion euros ($4.2 billion)&quot; were involved.

In June 2020, Novartis reached settlements with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) resolving all Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) investigations into historical conduct by the company and its subsidiaries. As part of the resolutions, Novartis and some of its current and former subsidiaries would pay US$233.9 million to the DOJ and US$112.8 million to the SEC.

===Michael Cohen===

Novartis paid $1.2 million to Essential Consultants, an entity owned by Michael Cohen, following the 2017 inauguration of Donald Trump. Cohen was paid monthly, with each payment just under $100,000. Novartis claims it paid Cohen to help it understand and influence the new administration&#x27;s approach to drug pricing and regulation.

In July 2018, the US Senate committee report &quot;White House Access for Sale&quot; revealed that Novartis Ag&#x27;s relationship with Cohen was &quot;longer and more detailed&quot;. Novartis initially stated that the relationship ceased a month after entering the US$1.2 million contract with Cohen&#x27;s consulting firm since the consultants were not able to provide the information the pharmaceutical company needed. Later, it became clear, however, that then-CEO Joseph Jimenez and Cohen communicated via email multiple times during 2017, which included ideas to lower drug prices to be discussed with the president. According to the report, several of the ideas appeared later in Trump&#x27;s drug pricing plan, released in early 2018, in which pharmaceutical companies were protected from reduced revenues.

=== AveXis data integrity ===
Having already received approval for Zolgensma in May 2019, on 28 June AveXis (a Novartis company) voluntarily disclosed to the FDA that some data previously submitted to the agency as part of the Biologics License Application (BLA) package was inaccurate. Specifically, the data manipulation related to an &quot;in vivo&quot; murine potency assay used in the early development of the product but the issue the FDA and wider community has taken is that AveXis was aware of the data manipulation as early as 14 March 2019, almost two months before the BLA was approved. To compound the problem in early August it emerged a senior manager sold almost $1 million worth of stock immediately before the FDA probe became public on 6 August, but after the company had informed the FDA of the problem. As of September 2019, the FDA was still preparing its response to the scandal.

<doc id="159285" wikidata="Q188184" url="?curid=159285" title="Abel Prize">
<text>The Abel Prize ( ; ) is awarded annually by the King of Norway to one or more outstanding mathematicians. It is named after the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel (1802–1829) and directly modeled after the Nobel Prizes; as such, it is widely considered the Nobel Prize of mathematics. It comes with a monetary award of 7.5 million Norwegian kroner (NOK; increased from 6 million NOK in 2019).

The Abel Prize&#x27;s history dates back to 1899, when its establishment was proposed by the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie when he learned that Alfred Nobel&#x27;s plans for annual prizes would not include a prize in mathematics. In 1902, King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway indicated his willingness to finance the creation of a mathematics prize to complement the Nobel Prizes, but the establishment of the prize was prevented by the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905. It took almost a century before the prize was finally established by the Government of Norway in 2001, and it was specifically intended &quot;to give the mathematicians their own equivalent of a Nobel Prize.&quot; The laureates are selected by the Abel Committee, the members of whom are appointed by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.

The award ceremony takes place in the of the University of Oslo, where the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded between 1947 and 1989. The Abel Prize board has also established an Abel symposium, administered by the Norwegian Mathematical Society, which takes place twice a year.

==History==
The prize was first proposed in 1899, to be part of the celebration of the 100th anniversary of Niels Henrik Abel&#x27;s birth in 1802. The Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie proposed establishing an Abel Prize when he learned that Alfred Nobel&#x27;s plans for annual prizes would not include a prize in mathematics. King Oscar II was willing to finance a mathematics prize in 1902, and the mathematicians Ludwig Sylow and Carl Størmer drew up statutes and rules for the proposed prize. However, Lie&#x27;s influence decreased after his death, and the dissolution of the union between Sweden and Norway in 1905 ended the first attempt to create an Abel Prize.

After interest in the concept of the prize had risen in 2001, a working group was formed to develop a proposal, which was presented to the Prime Minister of Norway in May. In August 2001, the Norwegian government announced that the prize would be awarded beginning in 2002, the two-hundredth anniversary of Abel&#x27;s birth. Atle Selberg received an honorary Abel Prize in 2002, but the first actual Abel Prize was awarded in 2003.

A book series presenting Abel Prize laureates and their research was commenced in 2010. The first three volumes cover the years 2003–2007, 2008–2012, and 2013–2017 respectively.

In 2019, Karen Uhlenbeck became the first woman to win the Abel Prize, with the award committee citing &quot;the fundamental impact of her work on analysis, geometry and mathematical physics.
The Bernt Michael Holmboe Memorial Prize was created in 2005. Named after Abel&#x27;s teacher, it promotes excellence in teaching.

== Selection criteria and funding ==
Anyone may submit a nomination for the Abel Prize, although self-nominations are not permitted. The nominee must be alive. If the awardee dies after being declared the winner, the prize will be awarded posthumously.

The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters declares the winner of the Abel Prize each March after recommendation by the Abel Committee, which consists of five leading mathematicians. Both Norwegians and non-Norwegians may serve on the Committee. They are elected by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters and nominated by the International Mathematical Union and the European Mathematical Society.

=== Funding ===
The Norwegian Government gave the prize an initial funding of NOK 200 million (about €21.7 million) in 2001. Previously, the funding came from the Abel foundation, but today the prize is financed directly through the national budget.

The funding is controlled by the Board, which consists of members elected by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. The current
board consists of Ingrid K. Glad (chair), Aslak Bakke Buan, Helge K. Dahle, Kristin Vinje, Cordian Riener and Gunn Elisabeth Birkelund.

==History==
===Origins===

The early history of Fort Riley is closely tied to the movement of people and trade along the Oregon and Santa Fe trails. These routes, a result of the then-popular United States doctrine of &quot;manifest destiny&quot; in the middle of the 19th century, prompted increased American military presence for the protection of American interests in this largely unsettled territory. In the 1850s, the United States established several military posts at strategic points to safeguard these emigration and commerce routes.

In the fall of 1852, a surveying party under the command of Captain Robert H. Chilton, 1st U.S. Dragoons, selected the junction of the Republican and Smoky Hill Rivers as a site for one of these forts. This location, approved by the War Department in January 1853, offered an advantageous location from which to organize, train, and equip troops to protect the overland trails. The site was named Camp Center because surveyors believed it was near the center of the United States. In late spring, three companies of the 6th Infantry occupied the camp and began construction of temporary quarters.
On June 27, 1853, Camp Center became Fort Riley — named in honor of Major General Bennet C. Riley, who had led the first military escort along the Santa Fe Trail in 1829. The &quot;fort&quot; took shape around a broad plain that overlooked the Kansas River valley. The fort&#x27;s design followed the standard frontier post configuration: buildings were constructed of the most readily available material — in this case, native limestone. In the spring, troops were dispatched to escort mail trains and protect travel routes across the plains. At the fort, additional buildings were constructed under the supervision of Capt. Edmund Ogden. Anticipating greater utilization of the post, Congress authorized appropriations in the spring of 1855 to provide additional quarters and stables for the Dragoons. Ogden again marshaled resources and arrived from Leavenworth in July with 50 6-mule teams loaded with materials, craftsmen, and laborers.

Work had progressed for several weeks when cholera broke out among the workers. The epidemic lasted only a few days but claimed 70 lives, including Ogden&#x27;s. Work gradually resumed, and buildings were prepared for the arrival in October of the 2nd Dragoons. As the fort began to take shape, an issue soon to dominate the national scene was debated during the brief territorial legislative session that met at Pawnee in the present area of Camp Whitside, named for Colonel Warren Whitside. The first territorial legislature met there in July 1855. Slavery was a fact of life and an issue within the garrison just as it was in the rest of the country. The seeds of sectional discord were emerging that would lead to &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; and, eventually, Civil War.

===Bleeding Kansas and the Civil War===

Increased tension and bloodshed between pro- and anti-slavery settlers led to the Army being used to &quot;police&quot; the troubled territory. They also continued to guard and patrol the Santa Fe Trail in 1859 and 1860 due to increased Indian threats. The outbreak of hostilities between the North and South in 1861 disrupted garrison life. Regular units returned east to participate in the Civil War, while militia units from Kansas and other states used Riley as a base from which to launch campaigns to show the flag and offer a degree of protection to trading caravans using the Santa Fe Trail.

In the early stages of the war, the fort was used to house Confederate prisoners. In early 1862, the fort served as a temporary detention facility for 133 Confederate prisoners from Texas, who had been captured during a significant military campaign in New Mexico. The prisoners remained at Fort Riley for approximately one month before being transferred to Fort Leavenworth. During their stay, seven individuals died due to illness or injuries sustained in battle and were interred in the vicinity. In May 1863, Fort Riley again held Confederate prisoners, this time those captured following raids in the Council Grove, Kansas, region. However, the overall involvement of Fort Riley in the Civil War was relatively limited.

===Post-Civil War and the Custer Era===

The conclusion of the Civil War in 1865 saw Fort Riley again assume an important role in providing protection to railroad lines being built across Kansas. The summer and fall of 1866 witnessed the mustering in of the 7th Cavalry Regiment at Riley and the arrival of the Union Pacific Railroad at the fort. In December, Brevet Major General George A. Custer arrived to take charge of the new regiment. Soldiers from the Kansas Volunteer regiments, &quot;Jenison&#x27;s Jayhawks,&quot; that were wounded in the Battle of Westport were brought to Fort Riley for recovery.

The following spring, Custer and the 7th left Fort Riley to participate in a campaign on the high plains of western Kansas and eastern Colorado. The campaign proved inconclusive but resulted in Custer&#x27;s court martial and suspension from the Army for one year—in part—for returning to Fort Riley to see his wife without permission. As the line of settlement extended westward each spring, the fort lost some of its importance. Larger concentrations of troops were stationed at Fort Larned and Fort Hays, where they spent the summer months on patrol and wintered in garrison.

Between 1869 and 1871, a school of light artillery was conducted at Fort Riley by the 4th Artillery Battery. Instruction was of a purely practical nature, and regular classes were not conducted. Critiques were delivered during or following the exercise. This short-lived school closed in March 1871 as the War Department imposed economic measures, which included cutting a private&#x27;s monthly pay from $12 to $9.

During the next decade, various regiments of the infantry and cavalry were garrisoned at Riley. The spring and summer months usually witnessed a skeletal complement at the fort while the remainder of the troops were sent to Forts Hays, Wallace, and Dodge in western Kansas. With the approach of winter, these troops returned to Riley. Regiments serving here during this time included the 5th, 6th, and 9th Cavalry and the 16th Infantry Regiment. The lessening of hostilities with the Indian tribes of the Great Plains resulted in the closing of many frontier forts. Riley escaped this fate when Lt. Gen. Philip Sheridan recommended in his 1884 annual report to Congress to make the fort &quot;Cavalry Headquarters of the Army&quot;.

===Cavalry School and Modernization===
General P. H. Sheridan, who was appointed general-in-chief of the United States army in 1883, recommended the enlargement of the post, and in 1886 the Kansas legislature adopted a resolution requesting the senators and representatives in Congress from that state to use their power and influence to secure an appropriation to carry out the ideas of the commanding general. Senators Preston B. Plumb and John J. Ingalls and Representative John A. Anderson, who represented the district in which Fort Riley was located, were especially active in behalf of the appropriation. The result of the combined efforts of the friends of the post was that in 1887 an appropriation of $200,000 was made by Congress for the purpose of establishing &quot;a permanent school of instruction for drill and practice for the cavalry and light artillery service of the army of the United States, and which shall be the depot to which all recruits for such service shall be sent; and for the purpose of construction of such quarters, barracks and stables as may be required to carry into effect the purposes of this act&quot;, which would become the United States Army Cavalry School. That appropriation was the beginning of a series of improvements that amount practically to the rebuilding of the post, including a large cavalry riding hall.

In 1889, Summerall Hall was constructed as the second permanent hospital at Fort Riley and was later converted into the garrison command headquarters following the hospital&#x27;s relocation. It was renamed in 1956 in honor of General Charles P. Summerall, who commanded the 1st Infantry Division during the late 1910s to early 1920s.

Fort Riley was also used by state militia units for encampments and training exercises. The first such maneuver occurred in the fall of 1902, with subsequent ones held in 1903, 1904, 1906–1908, and 1911. These exercises gave added importance to the fort as a training facility and provided reserve units a valuable opportunity for sharpening their tactical skills.
Army horsemen and the training they received at the United States Army Cavalry School made them among the finest mounted soldiers in the world, and the school&#x27;s reputation ranked with the French and Italian Cavalry Schools. Horse shows, hunts, and polo matches – long popular events on Army post – were a natural outgrowth of cavalry training.

===Buffalo Soldiers===

The 9th and 10th Cavalry Regiments — the famed &quot;Buffalo Soldiers,&quot; so called by the indigenous peoples for the similarity to the short, curly-haired buffalo that roamed the plains — have been stationed at Fort Riley several times during their history. Shortly after their formation in 1866, the 9th Cavalry passed through here en route to permanent stations in the southwest. They returned during the early 1880s and the early part of the 20th century before being permanently assigned as troop cadre for the Cavalry School during the 1920s and 1930s. The 10th Cavalry was stationed here in 1868 and 1913. On the eve of World War II, the 9th and 10th Cavalry joined the 2nd Cavalry Division, which was briefly stationed at Fort Riley.

===World War I===

America&#x27;s entry into World War I resulted in many changes at Fort Riley. Facilities were greatly expanded, and a cantonment named Camp Funston was built 5 miles (8 km) east of the permanent post during the summer and fall of 1917. This training site was one of 16 across the country and could accommodate from 30,000 to 50,000 men.

The first division to train at Camp Funston, the 89th, sailed for France in the spring of 1918. The 10th Division also received training at Funston, but the armistice came before the unit was sent overseas. The camp was commanded by Major General Leonard Wood. A Military Officers Training Camp was established in the Camp Whitside area to train doctors and other medical personnel.

====Spanish flu====
The Spanish flu pandemic has been hypothesized to have begun at Fort Riley in early March 1918, with the case of Albert Gitchell, an army cook at Camp Funston. By midday on the same day Gitchell reported sick, 107 soldiers were feeling ill, and days later, 522 men had reported sick. The disease had already been observed away in Haskell County as early as January 1918, prompting local doctor Loring Miner to warn the editors of the U.S. Public Health Service&#x27;s academic journal &quot;Public Health Reports&quot;. Several men from Haskell County who had been exposed to influenza then reported to Camp Funston several days before the outbreak began.

===Interwar years===
Following the war, the War Department directed service schools be created for all arms of service. As a result, in 1919, the Mounted Service School, as it was known since 1907 and which had ceased to function during the war, was re-designated as the United States Army Cavalry School. The change was sudden and abrupt. The new school met the need for courses both broader in scope and more general in character. The cavalry unit at Camp Funston was the 2nd cavalry regiment, which provided the training and cavalry tactics to new cavalry officers.

The Cavalry School Hunt was officially organized in 1921 and provided a colorful spectacle on Sunday mornings. These activities gave rise to the perception of a special quality of life at Fort Riley that came to be known as the &quot;Life of Riley.&quot; The technological advances demonstrated on the battlefields of Europe and World War I – most notable the tank and machine gun – raised questions in the interwar years over the future of cavalry. By the late 1920s, the Army&#x27;s War Department had directed the development of a tank force. This was followed by activation of the 7th Cavalry Brigade (Mechanized) at Fort Knox, Kentucky, in the fall of 1936 to make up the 2nd Regiment of this brigade. In October 1938, the 7th Cavalry Brigade (Mech.) marched from Fort Knox to Fort Riley and participated in large-scale combine maneuvers of horse and mechanized units. These exercises helped prove the effectiveness of mechanical doctrine.

====Marshall Army Airfield====
Initial experiments in directing artillery fire from an aircraft were undertaken at Fort Riley in 1912, with participants including H. H. Arnold, who later became a significant figure in the United States Army Air Forces. In 1921, the Smoky Hill Flats portion of the fort was designated as the location for a new airfield, initially referred to as Fort Riley Flying Field. The new airfield commenced operations in August of that year and served as the base for the 16th Observation Squadron. Built primarily as a refueling station for cross-country flights, the airfield featured metal hangars, underground fuel storage tanks, and lighting for night operations. Following the completion of the facility in 1923, the airfield was renamed Marshall Army Airfield in honor of Brigadier General Francis C. Marshall, who was killed in a plane crash the year before. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Marshall Army Airfield&#x27;s primary role was to support aircraft engaged in observation and photography during tactical exercises at Fort Riley, as well as to host aerial demonstrations, with no known aircraft training activities occurring during this period.

===World War II===

Increasing conflict in Europe and Asia during the late 1930s caused some military planners to prepare for possible U. S. involvement. This led to several important developments at Fort Riley. The first was the rebuilding of Camp Funston and the stationing of the 2nd Cavalry Division there in December 1940. Barracks were built in the area known as Republican Flats and renamed Camp Forsyth. In addition, 32,000 acres (13,000 ha) were added to the post for training purposes. These efforts were brought into sharp focus with America&#x27;s entry into World War II. Over the next four years, approximately 125,000 soldiers were trained at these facilities. Notable trainees included heavyweight boxing champion, Joe Louis, Indy car driver Walt Faulkner, and motion picture stars such as Mickey Rooney. The post also received a presidential visit by Franklin Roosevelt on Easter Sunday 1943.

The 9th Armored Division was organized here in July 1942, and after its deployment, Camp Funston was used as a German prisoner of war camp. Fort Riley had branch POW camps, a large branch Camp Phillips in Salina, and 12 smaller branch camps in Kansas and Missouri: Council Grove, El Dorado, Eskridge, Hutchinson, Lawrence, Neodesha, Ottawa, Peabody, Wadsworth, Grand Pass, Lexington, and Liberty.

The arrival of victory in Europe and Japan during the spring and summer of 1945 were joyous occasions, but they also spelled new realities and directions for the Army and Fort Riley.

===Korean War===
In the aftermath of World War II, the fort experienced a period of transition. The Cavalry School ceased operation in November 1946, and the last tactical horse unit inactivated the following March. Replacing the Cavalry School was the Ground General School, which trained newly commissioned officers in basic military subjects. An officer&#x27;s candidate course was conducted along with training officers and enlisted men in intelligence techniques and methods. The 10th Mountain Division was activated July 1, 1948, at Fort Riley, Kansas. The 16-week basic military program conducted by this division prepared soldiers for infantry combat and duty with other infantry units.

The invasion of South Korea by North Korean forces in June 1950 once again brought attention to Fort Riley as an important training facility. Over the next few years, recruits from all over the United States came to Fort Riley and received basic training. During the conflict, units from the Ohio National Guard also stationed the 37th Infantry Division at the fort. While they were not sent overseas, their presence was a continuing reinforcement of the fort&#x27;s importance as a training post.

===Cold War===
The uneasy truce that settled on the Korean peninsula after 1953 was indicative of a cold war that had come to characterize relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. This would affect Fort Riley.

In 1955, the fort&#x27;s utilization changed from training and educational center to that of being the home base for a major infantry division. In that year, the 10th Division rotated to Germany as part of Operation Gyroscope and was replaced by the 1st Infantry Division. Elements of the Big Red One began arriving in July 1955, and over the next four years the remaining units arrived, the last being the 2nd Battle Group, 8th Infantry, in December 1959. The initial units occupied barracks located in Camp Funston, until new barracks were built on Custer Hill. Ultimately, the 1st Battle Group, 5th Infantry, would be stationed at Funston, with the other units of the division divided between Custer Hill, Forsythe, and Main Post.

The influx of troops and dependents placed new demands on the fort&#x27;s infrastructure. Work began on Custer Hill, where new quarters, barracks, and work areas were constructed. A new hospital, named in honor of Major General B. J. D. Irwin, was constructed to provide medical care.

In the decade following, 1st Infantry Division units trained to respond to any threat that might arise in Europe or other parts of the world. Construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and the Cuban Missile Crisis the following year witnessed heightened alert for soldiers stationed at Fort Riley.

An additional 50,000 acres (20,000 ha) were also acquired in 1966, which enabled the Army to have an adequate training area for the division&#x27;s two brigades.

====Operation Long Thrust====
Consistent with President Kennedy&#x27;s August 1961 directive to augment the U.S. Berlin Brigade, in 1962–1963 1st Infantry Division rotated four Infantry Battle Group Task Forces (reinforced by Big Red One Artillery and Transportation units) from Fort Riley to West Germany, from where they motor marched through communist East Germany to surround West Berlin. 1st Division units involved were 2nd Battle Group, 12th Infantry; 1st Battle Group, 13th Infantry; 1st Battle Group, 28th Infantry; &amp; 2nd Battle Group, 26th Infantry. 2/12th was in Berlin during the Cuban Missile Crisis. 1/28th greeted President Kennedy on 26 June 1963, the day of his memorable &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner&quot; speech.

===Vietnam===
Increased guerrilla insurgency in South Vietnam during the mid-1960s, led to the deployment of the 1st Infantry Division to Southeast Asia. The leading element, the 1st Battalion, 18th Infantry, left in July 1965, with the Division Headquarters arriving in South Vietnam in September. During this same year, a provisional basic combat training brigade was organized at Fort Riley, and in February 1966, the 9th Infantry Division was reactivated and followed the 1st Infantry Division into combat.

Fort Riley&#x27;s use as a divisional post was maintained with the arrival of the 24th Infantry Division. The division remained in Germany until September 1968, when it redeployed two brigades to Fort Riley as part of the REFORGER (Return of Forces to Germany) program. One brigade was maintained in Germany. Following nearly five years of combat in Vietnam, the 1st Infantry Division returned to Fort Riley in April 1970 and assumed the NATO commitment. The division&#x27;s 3rd Brigade was stationed in West Germany. During the 1970s and the 1980s, 1st Infantry Division soldiers were periodically deployed on REFORGER exercises.

Reserve Officer Training Corps summer camps were also held at the fort, which permitted troops to demonstrate and teach their skills to aspiring second lieutenants. The fort also hosted the model U.S. Army Correctional Brigade, housed in Camp Funston, and the 3rd ROTC Region Headquarters until their inactivation in 1992.

===The Gulf War===

In August 1990, Iraq invaded its neighbor, Kuwait. The resulting international outcry led to the largest U.S. troop build-up and deployment overseas since the Vietnam War. In the fall of that year, Fort Riley was notified to begin mobilization of troops and equipment for deployment to the Persian Gulf. Between November 1990 and January 1991, soldiers and equipment were deployed overseas.

In addition to the 1st Infantry Division, 27 non-divisional units were deployed, and twenty-four reserve components were mobilized. This amounted to 15,180 soldiers being sent overseas via 115 aircraft. Over 2,000 rail cars transported 3,000 short tons of equipment, which were then shipped to theater on 18 vessels.

Once in theater, the soldiers and equipment were prepared for combat. This commenced in late February 1991, and over the course of the &quot;hundred hours&quot; combat of Operation Desert Storm, these soldiers carried out their orders and executed their missions that resulted in the crushing of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Republican Guards. Later that spring, the soldiers returned to Fort Riley.

===The 1990s and beyond===
Following Operation Desert Storm, the 1st Infantry Division returned to Fort Riley. However, the winds of change were once again blowing across the Army, affecting the post. With the crumbling of the Iron Curtain, new realities in Eastern Europe were replacing the Cold War of the past four decades. Budget cuts and revised strategic thinking resulted in troop cutbacks.

In the spring of 1995, the headquarters of the 1st Infantry Division were transferred from Fort Riley to Germany. The 1st Brigade of the Big Red One remained at the post, along with the 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division, and the 937th Engineer Group.

Fort Riley once again became a Division Headquarters on June 5, 1999, with the reactivation of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized). The 24th Infantry Division (Mech.) is the headquarters for three enhanced Separate Brigades (eSBs) of the Army National Guard. Under the integrated Active Component/Reserve Component concept, the 24th Infantry Division (Mech.) consists of an active component headquarters at Fort Riley and three enhanced Separate Brigades: the 30th Heavy Separate Brigade at Clinton, North Carolina, the 218th Heavy Separate Brigade at Columbia, South Carolina, and the 48th Separate Infantry Brigade in Macon, Georgia. These units underwent eight-year training cycles, culminating in a rotation at the National Training Center. They also backfill active duty units for Major Theater War contingencies and supply units for Stabilization Force rotations in Bosnia.

On June 1, 2006, Fort Riley began training Military Transition Teams, or MiTTs. These 10-15 man teams from across the Army, Navy, and Air Force train at Fort Riley&#x27;s Camp Funston for 60 days. The focus of the transition team training was to prepare teams to train, mentor, and advise Iraqi and Afghan security forces. Training is based on core competencies—combat skills, force protection, team support processes, technical and tactical training, adviser skills, counter-insurgency operations, and understanding the culture.

====Return of the 1st Infantry Division====

On August 1, 2006, the 1st Infantry Division returned to Fort Riley, and the 24th Infantry Division was inactivated.

In October 2006, the 1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, assumed command and control of the Military Transition Team training mission. The entire division took the lead on this mission for the military. The mission was moved from Fort Riley to Fort Polk, LA, in the summer of 2009.

==Facilities==
===Education===
Fort Riley offers educational services for service members and their dependents, including early childhood education, schools, and higher education.

Four Child Development Centers (CDCs) on the base provide care for children aged 6 weeks to 5 years: First Division CDC, Forsyth CDC, Warren CDC, and Whitside CDC. For primary education, students attend several elementary schools on base operated by the Geary County Unified School District 475, including Ware Elementary, Jefferson Elementary, Seitz Elementary, Fort Riley Elementary, and Morris Hill Elementary. Students in grades six through eight typically attend Fort Riley Middle School and then proceed to either Manhattan High School or Junction City High School.

Fort Riley hosts several colleges and universities with satellite campuses on base, including Barton Community College, Hutchinson Community College, Central Texas College, Upper Iowa University, Kansas State University, Central Michigan University, Southwestern College, and the University of Mary. Kansas State University&#x27;s main campus is located in nearby Manhattan, Kansas, providing additional educational opportunities for those who reside on base.

===Irwin Army Hospital===

A year after the post was established in 1853, a temporary hospital was constructed near the present-day Post/Cavalry Museum and Patton Hall on the main post. A permanent hospital, which is now the Post/Cavalry Museum, was built in 1855 with a clock tower added in 1890. The second hospital, later known as Summerall Hall, replaced the 1855 hospital in 1888 and is now Post Headquarters. A third hospital was built in 1941 at Camp Whitside and named Cantonment Hospital, later Station Hospital. The second hospital remained as an annex until 1957. The fourth hospital (now known as the &quot;Legacy Hospital&quot;) was dedicated in 1958, and a new facility on the site of the previous Station Hospital opened in 2016. The Legacy and current hospitals were named after Brigadier General Bernard John Dowling Irwin, &quot;The Fighting Doctor&quot;, who won the Medal of Honor for distinguished gallantry in action during an engagement with the Chiricahua Indians near Apache Pass, Arizona Territory, in February 1861. As of 2016, the hospital has 47 beds and is staffed by 45 physicians.

==Environmental contamination==
The Fort Riley site has contaminated groundwater stemming from years of improper waste disposal. Wastes at the site include pesticides, vinyl chloride, solvents, perchloroethylene (PCE) and other volatile organic compounds. The United States Environmental Protection Agency listed Fort Riley as a Superfund site in 1990. Major cleanup activities at the site took place in the 1990s, while environmental monitoring of the site continues as of 2017.

<doc id="159292" wikidata="Q184630" url="?curid=159292" title="Potassium chloride">
<text>Potassium chloride (KCl, or potassium salt) is a metal halide salt composed of potassium and chlorine. It is odorless and has a white or colorless vitreous crystal appearance. The solid dissolves readily in water, and its solutions have a salt-like taste. Potassium chloride can be obtained from ancient dried lake deposits. KCl is used as a fertilizer, in medicine, in scientific applications, domestic water softeners (as a substitute for sodium chloride salt), and in food processing, where it may be known as E number additive E508.

It occurs naturally as the mineral sylvite, which is named after salt&#x27;s historical designations &quot;sal degistivum Sylvii&quot; and &quot;sal febrifugum Sylvii&quot;, and in combination with sodium chloride as sylvinite.

==Uses==
===Fertilizer===
The majority of the potassium chloride produced is used for making fertilizer, called potash, since the growth of many plants is limited by potassium availability. The term &quot;potash&quot; refers to various mined and manufactured salts that contain potassium in water-soluble form. Potassium chloride sold as fertilizer is known as &quot;muriate of potash&quot;—it is the common name for potassium chloride () used in agriculture. The vast majority of potash fertilizer worldwide is sold as muriate of potash. The dominance of muriate of potash in the fertilizer market is due to its high potassium content (approximately 60% equivalent) and relative affordability compared to other potassium sources like sulfate of potash (potassium sulfate). Potassium is one of the three primary macronutrients essential for plant growth, alongside nitrogen and phosphorus. Potassium plays a vital role in various plant physiological processes, including enzyme activation, photosynthesis, protein synthesis, and water regulation. For watering plants, a moderate concentration of potassium chloride (KCl) is used to avoid potential toxicity: 6 mM (millimolar) is generally effective and safe for most plants, that is approximately per liter of water.

===Medical use===

Potassium is vital in the human body, and potassium chloride by mouth is the standard means to treat low blood potassium, although it can also be given intravenously. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is also an ingredient in Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT)/solution (ORS) to reduce hypokalemia caused by diarrhoea. This is another medicine on the WHO&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. 

Potassium chloride contains 52% of elemental potassium by mass.

Overdose causes hyperkalemia which can disrupt cell signaling to the extent that the heart will stop, reversibly in the case of some open heart surgeries.

===Culinary use===

Potassium chloride can be used as a salt substitute for food, but due to its weak, bitter, unsalty flavor, it is often mixed with ordinary table salt (sodium chloride) to improve the taste, to form low sodium salt. The addition of 1 ppm of thaumatin considerably reduces this bitterness. Complaints of bitterness or a chemical or metallic taste are also reported with potassium chloride used in food.

The World Health Organization guideline &quot;Use of lower-sodium salt substitutes&quot; strongly recommends reducing sodium intake to less than 2 g/day and conditionally recommends replacing regular table salt with lower-sodium salt substitutes that contain potassium. This recommendation is intended for adults (not pregnant women or children) in general populations, excluding individuals with kidney impairments or with other circumstances or conditions that might compromise potassium excretion. 

===Execution===
In the United States, potassium chloride is used as the final drug in the three-injection sequence of lethal injection as a form of capital punishment. It induces cardiac arrest, ultimately killing the inmate.

===Industrial===

As a chemical feedstock, the salt is used for the manufacture of potassium hydroxide and potassium metal. It is also used in medicine, lethal injections, scientific applications, food processing, soaps, and as a sodium-free substitute for table salt for people concerned about the health effects of sodium.

It is used as a supplement in animal feed to boost the potassium level in the feed. As an added benefit, it is known to increase milk production.

It is sometimes used in solution as a completion fluid in petroleum and natural gas operations, as well as being an alternative to sodium chloride in household water softener units.

Glass manufacturers use granular potash as a flux, lowering the temperature at which a mixture melts. Because potash imparts excellent clarity to glass, it is commonly used in eyeglasses, glassware, televisions, and computer monitors.

Because natural potassium contains a tiny amount of the isotope potassium-40, potassium chloride is used as a beta radiation source to calibrate radiation monitoring equipment. It also emits a relatively low level of 511 keV gamma rays from positron annihilation, which can be used to calibrate medical scanners.

Potassium chloride is used in some de-icing products designed to be safer for pets and plants, though these are inferior in melting quality to calcium chloride. It is also used in various brands of bottled water.

Potassium chloride was once used as a fire extinguishing agent, and in portable and wheeled fire extinguishers. Known as Super-K dry chemical, it was more effective than sodium bicarbonate-based dry chemicals and was compatible with protein foam. This agent fell out of favor with the introduction of potassium bicarbonate (Purple-K) dry chemical in the late 1960s, which was much less corrosive, as well as more effective. It is rated for B and C fires.

Along with sodium chloride and lithium chloride, potassium chloride is used as a flux for the gas welding of aluminium.

Potassium chloride is also an optical crystal with a wide transmission range from 210 nm to 20 μm. While cheap, KCl crystals are hygroscopic. This limits its application to protected environments or short-term uses such as prototyping. Exposed to free air, KCl optics will &quot;rot&quot;. Whereas KCl components were formerly used for infrared optics, they have been entirely replaced by much tougher crystals such as zinc selenide.

Potassium chloride is used as a scotophor with designation P10 in dark-trace CRTs, e.g. in the Skiatron.

==Toxicity==

The typical amounts of potassium chloride found in the diet appear to be generally safe. In larger quantities, however, potassium chloride is toxic. The of orally ingested potassium chloride is approximately 2.5 g/kg, or for a body mass of . In comparison, the of sodium chloride (table salt) is 3.75 g/kg.

Intravenously, the of potassium chloride is far smaller, at about 57.2 mg/kg to 66.7 mg/kg; this is found by dividing the lethal concentration of positive potassium ions (about 30 to 35 mg/kg) by the proportion by mass of potassium ions in potassium chloride (about 0.52445 mg K+/mg KCl).

==Chemical properties==

===Solubility===
KCl is soluble in a variety of polar solvents.
Solutions of KCl are common standards, for example for calibration of the electrical conductivity of (ionic) solutions, since KCl solutions are stable, allowing for reproducible measurements. In aqueous solution, it is essentially fully ionized into solvated and ions.

===Redox and the conversion to potassium metal===
Although potassium is more electropositive than sodium, KCl can be reduced to the metal by reaction with metallic sodium at 850 °C because the more volatile potassium can be removed by distillation (see Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle):

This method is the main method for producing metallic potassium. Electrolysis (used for sodium) fails because of the high solubility of potassium in molten KCl.
===Other potassium chloride stoichiometries===
Potassium chlorides with formulas other than KCl have been predicted to become stable under pressures of 20 GPa or more. Among these, two phases of KCl3 were synthesized and characterized. At 20-40 GPa, a trigonal structure containing K+ and Cl3− is obtained; above 40 GPa this gives way to a phase isostructural with the intermetallic compound Cr3Si.

==Physical properties==
Under ambient conditions, the crystal structure of potassium chloride is like that of NaCl. It adopts a face-centered cubic structure known as the B1 phase with a lattice constant of roughly 6.3 Å. Crystals cleave easily in three directions. Other polymorphic and hydrated phases are adopted at high pressures.

Some other properties are
* Transmission range: 210 nm to 20 μm
* Transmittivity = 92% at 450 nm and rises linearly to 94% at 16 μm
* Refractive index = 1.456 at 10 μm
* Reflection loss = 6.8% at 10 μm (two surfaces)
* d&quot;N&quot;/d&quot;T&quot; (expansion coefficient)= −33.2×10−6/°C
* d&quot;L&quot;/d&quot;T&quot; (refractive index gradient)= 40×10−6/°C
* Thermal conductivity = 0.036 W/(cm·K)
* Damage threshold (Newman and Novak): 4 GW/cm2 or 2 J/cm2 (0.5 or 1 ns pulse rate); 4.2 J/cm2 (1.7 ns pulse rate Kovalev and Faizullov)

As with other compounds containing potassium, KCl in powdered form gives a lilac flame.

==Production==
Potassium chloride is extracted from minerals sylvite, carnallite, and potash. It is also extracted from salt water and can be manufactured by crystallization from solution, flotation or electrostatic separation from suitable minerals. It is a by-product of the production of nitric acid from potassium nitrate and hydrochloric acid.

Most potassium chloride is produced as agricultural and industrial-grade potash in Saskatchewan, Canada, Russia, and Belarus. Saskatchewan alone accounted for over 25% of the world&#x27;s potash production in 2017.

===Laboratory methods===
Potassium chloride is inexpensively available and is rarely prepared intentionally in the laboratory. It can be generated by treating potassium hydroxide (or other potassium bases) with hydrochloric acid:

This conversion is an acid-base neutralization reaction. The resulting salt can then be purified by recrystallization. Another method would be to allow potassium to burn in the presence of chlorine gas, also a very exothermic reaction:

<text>Ultralight aviation (called microlight aviation in some countries) is the flying of lightweight, 1- or 2-seat fixed-wing aircraft. Some countries differentiate between weight-shift control and conventional three-axis control aircraft with ailerons, elevator and rudder, calling the former &quot;microlight&quot; and the latter &quot;ultralight&quot;.

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, mostly stimulated by the hang gliding movement, many people sought affordable powered flight. As a result, many aviation authorities set up definitions of lightweight, slow-flying aeroplanes that could be subject to minimum regulations. The resulting aeroplanes are commonly called &quot;ultralight aircraft&quot; or &quot;microlights&quot;, although the weight and speed limits differ from country to country. In Europe, the sporting (FAI) definition limits the maximum stalling speed to and the maximum take-off weight to , or if a ballistic parachute is installed. The definition means that the aircraft has a slow landing speed and short landing roll in the event of an engine failure.

In most affluent countries, microlights or ultralight aircraft now account for a significant percentage of the global civilian-owned aircraft. For instance, in Canada in February 2018, the ultralight aircraft fleet made up to 20.4% of the total civilian aircraft registered. In other countries that do not register ultralight aircraft, like in the United States, it is unknown what proportion of the total fleet they make up. In countries where there is no specific extra regulation, ultralights are considered regular aircraft and subject to certification requirements for both aircraft and pilot.

==Definitions==



===Australia===
In Australia, ultralight aircraft and their pilots can either be registered with the Hang Gliding Federation of Australia (HGFA) or Recreational Aviation Australia (RA Aus). In all cases, except for privately built single seat ultralight aeroplanes, microlight aircraft or trikes are regulated by the Civil Aviation Regulations.

===Canada===
===United Kingdom===
Pilots of a powered, fixed wing aircraft or paramotors do not need a licence, provided its weight with a full fuel tank is not more than , but they must obey the rules of the air.

For heavier microlights the current UK regulations are similar to the European ones, but helicopters and gyroplanes are not included.

Other than the very earliest aircraft, all two-seat UK microlights (and until 2007 all single-seaters) have been required to meet an airworthiness standard; BCAR Section S.
In 2007, Single Seat DeRegulated (SSDR), a sub-category of single seat aircraft was introduced, allowing owners more freedom for modification and experiments. By 2017 the airworthiness of all single seat microlights became solely the responsibility of the user, but pilots must hold a microlight licence; currently NPPL(M) (National Private Pilots Licence).

===New Zealand===
Ultralights in New Zealand are subject to NZCAA General Aviation regulations with microlight specific variations as described in Part 103 and AC103-1.

===United States===

The United States FAA&#x27;s definition of an ultralight is significantly different from that in most other countries and can lead to some confusion when discussing the topic. The governing regulation in the United States is FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles. In 2004, the FAA introduced the &quot;Light-sport aircraft&quot; category, which resembles some other countries&#x27; microlight categories. Ultralight aviation is represented by the United States Ultralight Association (USUA), which acts as the US aeroclub representative to the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale.

==Types==
There are several categories of aircraft which qualify as ultralights in some countries:
* Fixed-wing aircraft: traditional airplane-style designs.
* Weight-shift control trike: use a hang glider-style wing, below which is suspended a three-wheeled carriage which carries the engine and aviators. These aircraft are controlled by pushing against a horizontal control bar in roughly the same way as a hang glider pilot flies.
* Powered parachute: fuselage-mounted engines with parafoil wings, which are wheeled aircraft.
* Powered paraglider: backpack engines with parafoil wings, which are foot-launched.
* Powered hang glider: motorized foot-launched hang glider harness.
* Autogyro: rotary wing with fuselage-mounted engine, a gyrocopter is different from a helicopter in that the rotating wing is not powered, the engine provides forward thrust and the airflow through the rotary blades causes them to autorotate or &quot;spin up&quot; thereby creating lift.
* Helicopter: there are a number of single-seat and two-place helicopters which fall under the microlight categories in countries such as New Zealand. However, few helicopter designs fall within the more restrictive ultralight category defined in the United States of America.
* Hot air balloon: there are numerous ultralight hot air balloons in the US, and several more have been built and flown in France and Australia in recent years. Some ultralight hot air balloons are hopper balloons, while others are regular hot air balloons that carry passengers in a basket.

===Electric===
Advancements in batteries, motors, and motor controllers has led to some practical production electric propulsion systems for some ultralight applications. In many ways, ultralights are a good application for electric power as some models are capable of flying with low power, which allows longer duration flights on battery power.

In 2007, the first pioneering company in this field, the Electric Aircraft Corporation, began offering engine kits to convert ultralight weight shift trikes to electric power. The 18 hp motor weighs and an efficiency of 90% is claimed by designer Randall Fishman. The battery consists of a lithium-polymer battery pack of 5.6kWh which provides 1.5 hours of flying in the trike application. The company claimed a flight recharge cost of 60 cents in 2007.

A significant obstacle to the adoption of electric propulsion for ultralights in the U.S. is the weight of the battery, which is considered part of the empty weight of the aircraft despite efforts to have it considered as fuel. As the specific energy of batteries improves, lighter batteries can be used.

<text>The Number of the Beast is the third studio album by English heavy metal band Iron Maiden. It was released on 22 March 1982 in the US by Harvest and Capitol Records, and on 29 March 1982 in the UK by EMI Records. The album was their first to feature vocalist Bruce Dickinson and their last with drummer Clive Burr.

&quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; was met with critical and commercial success, and became the band&#x27;s first album to top the UK Albums Chart and reach the top 40 of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album produced the singles &quot;Run to the Hills&quot; and &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, the former of which became the band&#x27;s first top-ten UK single. The album was also controversial, particularly in the United States, due to the religious references in its artwork and the title track&#x27;s lyrics. Since the release of &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, &quot;The Beast&quot; has become an alternate name for Iron Maiden and was later used in the titles of some of their compilations and live releases, including &quot;Best of the Beast&quot; and &quot;Visions of the Beast&quot;.

==Writing and recording==
&quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; is Iron Maiden&#x27;s only album to include songwriting credits for Clive Burr, and was the band&#x27;s first album to feature writing by guitarist Adrian Smith. In addition, the release saw Steve Harris adopt a different approach to writing, which would cater more to new vocalist Bruce Dickinson. The album&#x27;s producer Martin Birch remarked, &quot;I simply didn&#x27;t think [former vocalist Paul Di&#x27;Anno] was capable of handling lead vocals on some of the quite complicated directions I knew Steve wanted to explore ... When Bruce joined, it opened up the possibilities for the new album tremendously.&quot;

According to several interviews Dickinson was heavily involved in writing several of the album&#x27;s songs, and in particular the tracks &quot;Children of the Damned&quot;, &quot;The Prisoner&quot; and &quot;Run to the Hills&quot;. Owing to his previous band Samson&#x27;s ongoing contractual issues, Dickinson could not legally have any writing credit. The recording and mixing of the album had to be completed in only five weeks, after the band had spent too long constructing the new songs. This was allegedly because the group were for the first time creating a new album from scratch, with very little material written prior to the record&#x27;s pre-production stage. However, live recordings show that five of the album&#x27;s songs had been premiered live already at a few shows towards the end of the Killer World Tour in November and December 1981. Given that &quot;Invaders&quot; is a re-write of an earlier song, &quot;Invasion&quot;, this suggests only two tracks – the title track and &quot;Gangland&quot; – originated after the 1981 tour ended.

Music press reports told stories of unexplained phenomena occurring during the sessions at Battery Studios, such as lights turning on and off of their own accord, and the recording gear mysteriously breaking down. These odd occurrences climaxed with Birch being involved in a car accident with a mini-bus transporting a group of nuns, after which he was presented with a repair bill for £666.

==Artwork==

As with all of Iron Maiden&#x27;s albums during the 1980s and early 1990s, the sleeve artwork was painted by Derek Riggs. The cover was originally created for the song &quot;Purgatory&quot;, but manager Rod Smallwood deemed it of too high a calibre for the release of a mere single, and decided to save it for &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;. The original 1982 artwork includes a blue sky in the background; a mistake by the printers of the cover, this was corrected to black when the album was remastered for compact disc in 1998.

The album attracted controversy, particularly in the United States, due to the lyrics of the title track and the cover art depicting Eddie controlling Satan like a puppet, while Satan is also controlling a smaller Eddie. Smallwood explains that the concept was to ask &quot;who&#x27;s the really evil one here? Who&#x27;s manipulating who?&quot; According to Riggs, this was inspired by a Doctor Strange comic book, &quot;which had some big villain with Doctor Strange dangling on some strings like a puppet – it was something I read as a child back in the 1960s, I think,&quot; while the images of hell were &quot;taken from my knowledge of medieval European Christian art which was full of such scenes&quot;. In addition, Satan was supposed to have wings made out of lightning and smoke (which can still be seen vaguely in the final piece) but due to time constraints, Riggs was unable to complete it as intended. He also made Satan look like Salvador Dalí as a joke.

According to US professor Bryan A. Bardine, &quot;this album evokes power, passion and music that present darker themes and images.&quot;

The artwork has been parodied by crossover thrash band Stormtroopers of Death for the cover of their 1999 album &quot;Bigger than the Devil&quot;, and on a T-shirt by Streetwear brand Diamond Supply Co.

&quot;It&#x27;s probably thick,&quot; remarked Kiss bassist Gene Simmons of the sleeve. &quot;It&#x27;s probably got elves and dragons holding it up!&quot;

In 2015, this cover art makes an appearance in the &quot;Speed of Light&quot; music video depicting Eddie fighting Satan (now known as &quot;The Beast&quot;) in a form of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; video game.

==Songs==

&quot;Run to the Hills&quot; was released as a single on 12 February 1982, two weeks before Iron Maiden&#x27;s UK tour, acting as a preview for the forthcoming album, which would not be released until two days after the British dates ended. Released alongside a music video, made using live footage and clips from Buster Keaton films, the single performed remarkably well, earning the band their first top ten entry in the UK Singles Chart. As they were rushing to complete the album in time, as well as record and mix the single for an even earlier release, the band hastily selected &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; as the B-side.

As they had written too much material, they had to choose between &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; and &quot;Gangland&quot; for the &quot;Run to the Hills&quot; B-side, with the understanding that the other song would appear on the album. Several band-members have since expressed regret over the decision, with Steve Harris commenting, &quot;We just chose the wrong track as the B-side. I think if &#x27;Total Eclipse&#x27; had been on the album instead of &#x27;Gangland&#x27; it would have been far better.&quot; On top of this, Harris has stated that the record&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Invaders&quot;, was not good enough, commenting that it &quot;could have been replaced with something a bit better, only we didn&#x27;t have anything else to replace it with at the time. We had just enough time to do what we did, and that was it.&quot; &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; was added to the 1998 CD reissue, and replaced &quot;Gangland&quot; on the 2022 40th Anniversary reissue vinyl.

While the title track was considered by many religious groups in the United States as evidence that Iron Maiden was a Satanic band, the song was in fact inspired by a nightmare that bassist Steve Harris had, triggered by watching the film &quot;&quot; late at night. In addition, Harris has stated that the lyrics were also influenced by Robert Burns&#x27; &quot;Tam o&#x27; Shanter&quot;. The track opens with a spoken introduction from the Book of Revelation, read by actor Barry Clayton. According to Dickinson, the band originally approached Vincent Price to record the passage, but were unwilling to pay Price&#x27;s fee of £25,000. Although the liner notes state that the passage is from Revelation 13:18, the first line comes from 12:12.

The closing song &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot; has remained in all but three of the band&#x27;s setlists since the album&#x27;s recording (the only exceptions being the Maiden England World Tour 2012–14, the second leg of the Book of Souls World Tour in 2017, and the Future Past World Tour in 2023). AllMusic describes the track as &quot;perhaps the most celebrated of the band&#x27;s extended epics; it&#x27;s the tale of a prisoner about to be hanged, featuring some of Harris&#x27; most philosophical lyrics.&quot; Several band-members have since stated that it is one of their favourite tracks, with Dickinson describing it as &quot;fantastic&quot; and that performing it live is like &quot;narrating a movie to the audience.&quot; A live version of the song was released in 1993, gaining the band another top ten placement in the UK Singles Chart.

&quot;Children of the Damned&quot; is based on the films &quot;Village of the Damned&quot; and &quot;Children of the Damned&quot;, which in turn were adapted from the novel &quot;The Midwich Cuckoos&quot; by John Wyndham. On his last radio show for BBC Radio 6, during a segment in tribute to the late Ronnie James Dio, Dickinson mentioned that &quot;Children of the Damned&quot; was inspired by Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Children of the Sea&quot;.

&quot;The Prisoner&quot; was inspired by the British TV show of the same name, and features dialogue from its title sequence. The band&#x27;s manager, Rod Smallwood, had to telephone Patrick McGoohan to ask permission to use the audio clips for the song and was extremely hesitant during his conversation with whom Smallwood himself describes as &quot;a real bona fide superstar actor&quot;. McGoohan was reported to have said &quot;What did you say the name was? A rock band, you say? Do it.&quot; Iron Maiden later made another song based on the series, &quot;Back in the Village&quot; from 1984&#x27;s &quot;Powerslave&quot;.

&quot;22 Acacia Avenue&quot; is the second song in the &quot;Charlotte the Harlot&quot; saga, which was originally written by Adrian Smith several years earlier, while playing in his old band, Urchin. According to Smith, Steve Harris remembered hearing the song at an Urchin concert in a local park, and modified it for &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; album. The Urchin song this song was based on was called &quot;Countdown&quot;.

==Release and Controversy==
&quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; was released on 22 March 1982 through EMI and its sister label Capitol in the United States. The album was strongly opposed by some social conservatives in the United States, where Iron Maiden were accused of being Satanists. Public burnings of the band&#x27;s catalogue were organised, although one religious group smashed the records with hammers, for fear of inhaling fumes from burning vinyl. It is unclear whether their caution was based on toxicological or theological concerns. The subsequent tour was subject to boycotts and demonstrations: venues were sometimes surrounded by activists who handed out leaflets and, in one case, a 25-foot cross was carried in protest. Harris has stated, &quot;It was mad. They completely got the wrong end of the stick. They obviously hadn&#x27;t read the lyrics. They just wanted to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists.&quot;

The album was reissued in 1995 with a bonus CD containing two songs (&quot;Total Eclipse&quot;, and a live version of &quot;Remember Tomorrow&quot;) that had been the B-sides of the album&#x27;s two singles. The US version of the 1995 reissue incorrectly gives Paul Di&#x27;Anno a songwriting credit for &quot;Total Eclipse&quot;; the song had actually been written by Harris, Murray, and Burr.

The album was also reissued in 1998 by EMI and Sanctuary/Columbia in the US as an enhanced CD version, which included photos, band history and the music videos for the songs &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; and &quot;Run to the Hills&quot;, in addition to &quot;Total Eclipse&quot;, which was restored to the album&#x27;s track listing (having been excluded from the original edition due to space constraints). This version mistakenly lists the track lengths for &quot;22 Acacia Avenue&quot; and &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; as 4:49 and 3:50; they are in fact 6:38 and 4:51, respectively.

On March 18, 2022 (UK, Europe) and March 25th (USA) the band will release a new cassette version of the album for the fortieth anniversary of the album&#x27;s original release.

==Reception and legacy==
Since its release, the album has received consistent critical acclaim, with AllMusic describing it as &quot;among the top five most essential heavy metal albums ever recorded. A cornerstone of the genre.&quot; Sputnikmusic calls it &quot;a classic in the world of metal&quot;, while BBC Music praised the record&#x27;s complex arrangements, stating &quot;Whereas even some of the venerable HM institutions (think Black Sabbath) would struggle to make material that was something more than a collection of minor-key riffs, Iron Maiden pull this feat off with considerable élan.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed the album at No. 100 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot; in 2000; in 2001 named it one of the &quot;50 Heaviest Albums of All Time&quot;; and in 2006 placed it at No. 40 in its &quot;40 Best Albums of the &#x27;80s&quot; list. IGN and Metal Rules placed it third and second, respectively, in their lists of the Top Heavy Metal Albums, and &quot;Guitar World&quot; ranked it at No. 17 on their list of &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Albums of All Time&quot;. &quot;Classic Rock&quot; placed it at No. 15 in their list of the &quot;100 Greatest British Rock Albums&quot;, describing it as &quot;the most important metal album of the decade&quot;, and it was voted No. 1 in HMV&#x27;s list of &quot;The Best British Albums of the Past 60 Years&quot; in 2012. &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; is one of two Iron Maiden records listed in Robert Dimery&#x27;s book, &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; (1980&#x27;s &quot;Iron Maiden&quot; being the other). In 2017, it was ranked 4th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″ list of &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

In 2001, the BBC made a documentary about &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; as part of the &quot;Classic Albums&quot; series, which was released on DVD in the same year.

In 2022, coinciding with the 40th anniversary of the album&#x27;s release, &quot;Number Of The Beast&quot; was named #1 of &#x27;The 25 greatest rock guitar albums of 1982&#x27; list in Guitar World.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; was a big commercial success worldwide. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 2010 that 14 million copies have been sold and by 2023 it had sold circa 20 million copies worldwide. It was the band&#x27;s first record to top the UK charts, entering at No.1 on 10 April, maintaining the top position for a further week, and remaining in the Top 75 for a total of 31 weeks. It entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at No.150 and peaked at No.33. The album reached the top ten in Austria and Sweden, and No.11 and No.13 in Canada and Norway, respectively.

It was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on 4 October 1983 (eventually going platinum in 1986). The album reached No.11 in Germany and was certified gold ten years later. It received a 3× platinum award in Canada for sales exceeding 300,000 units.

The two singles, &quot;Run to the Hills&quot; and the title track, debuted in the UK singles chart at No.7 and No.18, respectively. Both songs entered the Irish Singles Chart in the same order, and reached No.16 and No.19.

==Versions and performances by other artists==
On 24 October 2002, progressive metal outfit Dream Theater played the original album in its entirety at La Mutualité in Paris, France. The performance was recorded and has been released through the band&#x27;s YtseJam Records label.

&quot;Children of the Damned&quot; was covered by Swedish band Therion on their 1997 album A&#x27;arab Zaraq – Lucid Dreaming. &quot;Run to the Hills&quot; was covered on the tribute album &quot;Numbers From The Beast&quot;, featuring vocalist Robin McAuley, guitarists Michael Schenker and Pete Fletcher, bassist Tony Franklin and drummer Brian Tichy. &quot;A Tribute to the Beast, Vol. 2&quot; features covers of &quot;Children of the Damned&quot;, by Sebastian Bach of Skid Row fame, and &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot;, by Iced Earth, who have also covered &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot; and &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; on their own album, &quot;Tribute to the Gods&quot;. &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot; has also been covered by Machine Head on &quot;Maiden Heaven: A Tribute To Iron Maiden&quot;, which was released by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine in 2008, and by Cradle of Filth, while the title track has also been covered by Billy Corgan&#x27;s band Djali Zwan on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Spun&quot;. Acoustic reinterpretations of &quot;Children of the Damned&quot; and &quot;22 Acacia Avenue&quot; were included on the album &quot;Across The Seventh Sea&quot; (2012) by the tribute project Maiden uniteD.

==Appearances in other media==
Several of the record&#x27;s songs have been used in video games: &quot;Run to the Hills&quot; is featured in &quot;SSX On Tour&quot; as the opening theme, &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City&quot;, and a cover version is included in &quot;Rock Band&quot;, the only song in the game listed as &#x27;Impossible&#x27; for all instruments. In addition, &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; (as the original master recording), &quot;Run to the Hills&quot; and &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot; (the latter being a live recording found on &quot;Flight 666&quot;) were made downloadable to &quot;Rock Band&quot; on 8 June 2009; &quot;The Prisoner&quot; was made downloadable on 22 May 2012. &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; was also featured in &quot;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot; (master recording), and on &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4&quot;.

<text>is a Japanese former boxer. Watanabe, who fought only in Japan and South Korea, was one of the first World super flyweight champions, as the division was relatively new when he was crowned.

==Biography==
With a background in Shotokan Karate, he started his professional boxing career with a three-round knockout over Keiza Miyazaki. The fight was in Okayama, Watanabe&#x27;s birthplace. Two first-round knockout wins followed, one over Yukihiro Kawahira, and another over Noburu Iishi. There was an immediate rematch with Iishi, and, although the second time around Iishi gave him a tougher test, nevertheless, Watanabe still came out a winner, by a knockout in six.

Three more knockouts followed, two in the first round, including one over Koji Kobayashi, future WBC world Flyweight champion and brother of former world champion Royal Kobayashi. Then, Watanabe was taken the distance for the first time, against Jin-Hyun Chun in Nagoya, Watanabe winning a six-round decision.

After two more decision wins, Watanabe flew to South Korea, where he challenged the WBC world Jr. Bantamweight champion Chul-Ho Kim, losing in his first world title bid by a 15-round decision. Watanabe then returned to Japan and won his remaining four bouts for 1981 there, three by knockout.
One of the fighters he beat was Tito Abella, who by then had been ranked as the number one Jr. Bantamweight challenger in the world. Abella was knocked out in four rounds.

In April 1982, the WBA Jr. Bantamweight champion of the world, Rafael Pedroza of Panama, the cousin of Eusebio Pedroza, travelled to Osaka to defend his belt against Watanabe on 8 April. Watanabe won a unanimous 15-round decision and became world champion. Watanabe&#x27;s remaining fights of 1982 were title defenses against former world champions, Gustavo Ballas of Argentina, knocked out in nine rounds, and Shoji Oguma (former two time world Flyweight champion), beaten by a knockout in 12.

1983 was another busy year for the champion: He beat Luis Ibañez by a knockout in eight, Roberto Ramirez of Mexico by a decision in 15, and Soon-Chun Kwon by a technical decision in 11. Watanabe had built a considerable points lead over Kwon, but in round ten, their heads collided, causing a gap in Watanabe&#x27;s head. He bled profusely, and the fight doctor ordered the fight to be stopped in round eleven, but since it was ruled that the cut was the product of a headbutt, the fight then went to the scorecards, and Watanabe was declared the winner.

In 1984, Watanabe disposed of another Venezuelan challenger, Celso Chavez, by knocking him out in 15 rounds. Then, he and WBC world champion Payao Poontarat met in an attempt to unify the world&#x27;s Jr. Bantamweight title, and Watanabe finally earned the WBC&#x27;s belt, winning by a 12-round decision. Although Watanabe didn&#x27;t become undisputed as he was stripped of the WBA title for refusing to defend his title against his number 1 contender, Khaosai Galaxy. Watanabe also became the first lineal champion in the division. There was an immediate rematch, and Watanabe again imposed his will, with an 11-round knockout over the former world champ.

In 1985, he retained the title with a 12-round decision over Julio Soto Solano. Wins over Katsuo Katsuma (KO 7) and Suk-Hwan Yun (KO 5) followed, but in 1986, he defended against the late Gilberto Roman in what would turn out to be his last fight. He lost to Roman by a 12-round decision and announced his retirement from professional boxing. Unlike so many others, he was able to stay away from the temptation of coming back and trying to regain his old popularity.

Watanabe&#x27;s successor for the WBA title would be Galaxy. Galaxy would win the vacant title against Eusebio Espinal and also go on to become a Jr. Bantamweight and reel off 19 straight title defenses before retiring.

In 1999, Watanabe was spotted at a Seoul activity honoring Asia&#x27;s greatest boxing champions, alongside Fighting Harada, Jung-Koo Chang, Yoko Gushiken, Sot Chitalada, and former rivals Chul-Ho Kim and Poontarat, among others.

In August 1995, he was arrested for blackmail. He ran an import business in Osaka, and threatened the debtors by saying that he would beat them to death. Police suspended judgment on the matter, so he was released.

In October 1999, he was arrested for giving a gun to a friend who was prosecuted for murder. In July 2000, he was sentenced to 4 years and 6 months imprisonment.

After being released in 2004, he was arrested for blackmail along with Kenji Haga, ex-actor, and a yakuza of Yamaguchigumi, on 30 June 2007. He has denied the suspicion, but Japan Boxing Commission banished him on 27 July 2007.

<doc id="159320" wikidata="Q142908" url="?curid=159320" title="Tux Racer">
<text>Tux Racer is a 2000 open-source winter sports racing video game starring the Linux mascot, Tux the penguin. It was originally developed by Jasmin Patry as a computer graphics project at the University of Waterloo. Later on, Patry and the newly founded Sunspire Studios, composed of several former students of the university, expanded it. In the game, the player controls Tux as he slides down a course of snow and ice collecting herrings.

&quot;Tux Racer&quot; was officially downloaded over one million times as of 2001. It also was well received, often being acclaimed for the graphics, fast-paced gameplay, and replayability, and was a fan favorite among Linux users and the free software community. The game&#x27;s popularity secured the development of a proprietized release that included enhanced graphics and multiplayer, and it also became the first GPL-licensed game to receive an arcade adaptation. It is the only product that Sunspire Studios developed and released, after which the company liquidated.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Tux Racer&quot; is a racing game in which the player must control Tux across a mountainside. Tux can turn left, right, brake, jump, and paddle, and flap his wings. If the player presses the brakes and turn buttons, Tux will perform a tight turn. Pressing the paddling buttons on the ground gives Tux some additional speed. The paddling stops giving speed and in turn slows Tux down when the speedometer turns yellow. Tux can slide off slopes or charge his jumps to temporarily launch into midair, during which he can flap his flippers to fly farther and adjust his direction left or right. The player can also reset the penguin should he be stuck in any part of the course.

Courses are composed of various terrain types that affect Tux&#x27;s performance. Sliding on ice allows speeding at the expense of traction, and snow allows for more maneuverability. However, rocky patches slow him down, as does crashing into trees. The player gains points by collecting herrings scattered along the courses, and the faster the player finishes the course, the higher the score. Players can select cups, where progression is by completing a series of courses in order by satisfying up to three requirements: collecting sufficient herring, finishing the course below a specified time, and scoring enough points. Failing to meet all the criteria or aborting the race costs a life, and should the player lose all four lives, they must reenter the cup and start over. During level selection, the player can choose daytime settings and weather conditions such as wind and fog that affect the gameplay. Maps are composed of three separately saved raster layers that each determine a map&#x27;s elevation, terrain layout, and object placement.

===Proprietary version===
The proprietary version of &quot;Tux Racer&quot; introduces new content. Besides Tux, players can select one of three other characters to race as: Samuel the seal, Boris the polar bear, and Neva the penguin. Some courses contain jump and speed pads as power-ups, and players can perform tricks in midair to receive points. They can participate in cups in one of the two events serving as game modes: the traditional &quot;Solo Challenge&quot; or the new &quot;Race vs Opponents&quot;, where a computer opponent is added and must be defeated in order for the player to advance. Courses are unlocked for completing unfinished cups. In non-campaign sessions, besides practicing, players can also race in the two-player &quot;Head to Head&quot; local multiplayer mode, viewed on a split-screen.

==Development==
&quot;Tux Racer&quot; was originally developed by Jasmin Patry, a student attending the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, where he aimed to begin a career in the video game industry by pursuing a computer graphics degree. Development of the game began in August 1999 as a final computer graphics project in Computer Graphics Lab, and was completed in three days to positive class reception. A webpage for the game was then started, and someone suggested he release the game&#x27;s source code.
Patry felt that made sense due to Tux being the mascot for the open-source Linux, and continued to work on the game before publicly uploading it to SourceForge for Linux under the free GNU General Public License on February 28, 2000, hoping others would join in on developing it. This early version featured a very basic gameplay that consisted of Tux sliding down a hill of snow, ice, rock, and trees for Tux to avoid along the way. To write the game, Patry tended to use free premade content such as textures borrowed from websites, rather than original content made from scratch.

In December 1999, Patry, fine arts students Rick Knowles and Mark Riddell, and computer graphics students Patrick Gilhuly, Eric Hall, and Rob Kroeger announced the foundation of the company Sunspire Studios to develop a video game project. Patry stated the game would have a massively multiplayer and a persistent universe with real-time strategy and first-person shooter components. Since their ideas were limited by that time&#x27;s 3D engines, they embarked on creating their own, which according to Patry would make &quot;Quake 3&quot; and &quot;Unreal&quot; engine look &quot;tame&quot; in comparison. Fine arts undergraduate classmate Roger Fernandez was chosen as the artist. The project was eventually abandoned due to it being a &quot;massive undertaking&quot;, and in August 2000, Knowles suggested the company resume working on &quot;Tux Racer&quot;, which became their first official project. Continued development of the free version was swift; numerous elements such as herrings, jumping, and a soundtrack, as well as graphical improvements, were added in just three weeks. Porting the game from Linux to Windows was easy, as it used cross-platform tools such as OpenGL and Simple DirectMedia Layer. A major update including those improvements, version 0.60, was freely uploaded to SourceForge for both Linux and Windows on October 2, 2000. A minor patch for that release was often included in most Linux distributions, and a port for Macintosh was released on November 21, 2000.

===Ports and remakes===
On February 5, 2002, Sunspire Studios released in retail a proprietary and commercial expansion of the game titled &quot;Tux Racer&quot;, with each CD designed to support both Linux and Windows operating systems. Improvements from the open-source version include a vastly enhanced engine and graphics, the ability to perform tricks, character selection, and competitive multiplayer. The open-source version of &quot;Tux Racer&quot;, however, remained available to download on SourceForge. Sunspire Studios ceased business towards the end of 2004.

Since its inception, &quot;Tux Racer&quot; has seen unofficial updates. One of the most popular examples is &quot;Extreme Tux Racer&quot;, released in September 2000, &quot;PlanetPenguin Racer&quot;. An arcade version of the game was released by Roxor Games, making it the first GPL-licensed video game to receive an arcade adaption.

==Reception==
&quot;Tux Racer&quot; was well-received, with the latest version seeing over one million downloads as of October 2001 since its release in January, according to Sunspire Studios. It was a favorite among Linux users, who often ranked it as the best or one of the best free games. In August 2000, Lee Anderson of LinuxWorld.com commended the game&#x27;s graphics, speed, and the easiness of the ability to create tracks. In 2001, &quot;TuxRadar&quot; said the game provided a &quot;shining light&quot; of what free applications could achieve. In its 2001 preview, the Brazilian magazine &quot;SuperGamePower&quot; considered the game&#x27;s graphics to be the best aspect and described the sound as not innovative, but good. Also in 2001, &quot;MacAddict&quot; compared the game&#x27;s fast-paced style to podracing in &quot;Star Wars&quot; and summed up the Macintosh port as &quot;more fun&quot;.

The proprietary version of &quot;Tux Racer&quot; attracted little attention. Andon Logvinov of &quot;Igromania&quot; described it as a &quot;pure arcade game&quot; featuring nothing but four selectable characters and a set of courses with fish scattered about. He described the gameplay as calm and addictive and the music as relaxing, and praised the character models and track layout, with his only criticism being the system requirements. Seiji Nakamura of the Japanese website Game Watch described it as cute and humorous and praised the game&#x27;s graphics and shadow and reflection effects, but found the game to lack appeal for adults.

Even after its production&#x27;s cessation, &quot;Tux Racer&quot; has continued to be generally well-received. &quot;Linux Journal&quot; gave it an Editors&#x27; Choice Award in the &quot;Game or Entertainment Software&quot; category in 2005. &quot;Digit&quot; applauded the graphics and replayability, as well as the speed of the game and the abundance of courses, but found the music to be monotonous. Daniel Voicu of &quot;Softpedia&quot; praised the &quot;Extreme Tux Racer&quot; for being relaxing and funny and having the ability to reset Tux, as well as noted the game&#x27;s fast pace, but criticized its perceived lack of interactivity and having Tux look like a &quot;plastic puppet&quot;. &quot;Linux For You&quot; called it entertaining but also criticized its bugs and the &quot;plastic&quot; look of Tux.

<text>Ariane 3 was a European expendable carrier rocket, which was used for eleven launches between 1984 and 1989. It was a member of the Ariane family of rockets. The principal manufacturer for the Ariane 3 was Aérospatiale, while the lead agency for its development was the Centre National d&#x27;Etudes Spatiales (CNES).

Development of the Ariane 3 was authorised in July 1979, months prior to the Ariane 1&#x27;s first flight. Drawing heavily upon both the design and infrastructure of the Ariane 1, the new launcher was concurrently developed alongside the Ariane 2, with which it shared much of its design. It represented an advancement of the Ariane 1 rather than a replacement, but was capable of lifting even heavier payloads into Geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) as well as launching two satellites via one launch. Developed largely within a two year window, the Ariane 3 performed its maiden flight on 4 August 1984, actually flying in advance of its Ariane 2 sibling. During its brief service life, having performed its final launch on 12 July 1989, the Ariane family had become increasingly commercially competitive, becoming the market leading heavy launch vehicle in the world by the late 1980s.

==Development==
In 1973, eleven nations decided to pursue joint collaboration in the field of space exploration and formed a new pan-national organisation to undertake this mission, the European Space Agency (ESA). Six years later, in December 1979, the arrival of a capable European expendable launch system was marked when the first Ariane 1 rocket launcher was successfully launched from the Guiana Space Centre at Kourou, French Guiana. The Ariane 1 soon became considered to be a capable and competitive launcher in comparison to the rival platforms offered by the Soviet Union and the United States of America. However, even prior to the launcher having entering service, there was a strong desire to quickly produce improved derivatives that would be able to handle even greater payloads than Ariane 1 could. These desires would result in the creation of both the Ariane 2 and Ariane 3.

While the initiative was first proposed in 1978, prior to the Ariane 1&#x27;s first flight, approval to commence the first phase of development was not received until July 1979. The bulk of development work on the new launcher occurred between 1980 and 1982. The Ariane 3 was designed to satisfy the future demand for the delivery of two tonne payloads into a Geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO). According to aerospace historian Brian Harvey, in spite of the numbering sequence adopted, the Ariane 3 was the direct successor to the Ariane 1, rather than the Ariane 2, as could be logically assumed. The principal agency behind the development of the Ariane 3 was the Centre National d&#x27;Etudes Spatiales (CNES), while the lead company for its production was the French aerospace manufacturer Aérospatiale.

In order to keep costs down, CNES directed that only tested technologies could be implemented in the launcher&#x27;s improvements; in fact, no budget was provided for new test series to be performed. Furthermore, it was restricted to using the existing launch pad and handling facilities established for the Ariane 1, and that there was to be no allowance for retooling of the Ariane production line. However, one new piece of infrastructure that was permitted was the establishment of tracking equipment in the Ivory Coast; the existing infrastructure based in Brazil used by the Ariane 1 was less suitable due to the increased performance of the Ariane 3, which flew a different ascent profile that reached 250 km, rather than 200 km before coasting into orbit. Performance boosts were achieved via several different ways, such as the elongated third stage fuel tanks to carry 30 per cent more fuel, elevated combustion pressure in multiple stages, a new intertank structure that supported the addition of solid-fuel boosters, and the adoption of a new fuel mixture.

The finalised Ariane 3 followed the same basic design as the earlier Ariane 1, but incorporated numerous modifications that had been made for the Ariane 2. Unlike the Ariane 2, two solid-fuelled PAP strap-on booster rockets were used to augment the first stage at liftoff. The core of the Ariane 3 was essentially identical to that of the Ariane 2. The first stage was powered by four Viking 2B bipropellant engines, burning UH 25 (25% straight hydrazine, 75% UDMH) in a dinitrogen tetroxide oxidiser. The second stage was powered by a Viking 4B, which used the same fuel-oxidiser combination. The third stage used a cryogenically fuelled HM7B engine, burning liquid hydrogen in liquid oxygen. On some flights, a Mage 2 kick motor was flown as a fourth stage. One atypical modification for the era was the revised satellite deployment system, which could facilitate the launch of two smaller satellites as well as one larger one.

The Ariane 3&#x27;s design heavily influenced that of its successor, the Ariane 4; while the design team considered various approaches for achieving such a launcher, one of the studied concepts had involved the addition of a fifth engine to an enlarged first stage of the Ariane 3. However, this was determined to have involved a very high level of redesign work; an alternative approach was instead adopted, in which the first stage was elongated to hold 210 tonnes of propellant instead of the 145 tonnes present on the Ariane 3. While the second and third stages of the Ariane 4 remained identical to the Ariane 3, a range of strap-on boosters were developed to be applied to the type, designed to gradually increase the rocket&#x27;s payload capacity. Overall, the Ariane 4 was 15 per cent smaller than the Ariane 3. It was effectively an improved and developed derivative of the earlier Ariane 3, primarily differing through the application of various solid-fuelled and liquid-fuelled boosters, the latter being the only all-new design feature of the Ariane 4.

== Launch history ==
The Ariane 3 made its maiden flight on 4 August 1984, almost two years before the Ariane 2&#x27;s first launch, placing the ECS-2 and Télécom 1A satellites into geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO). The ESA opted for a calculated risk on the first launch, saving €60 million, by performing a commercial launch with the very first flight of the Ariane 3. This was perhaps even more daring as not only was this flight using a new launcher but also the new capability to launch two satellites at once. The gamble paid off, as the launch was a complete success. At the time of the Ariane 3&#x27;s maiden flight, the United States still held a majority of the global launcher market; by the end of the year, the order books were shifting in favour of the Ariane family, having outstanding orders to launch 30 satellites at a cumulative cost of €1 billion.

Eleven Ariane 3 launchers were launched with ten successes and one failure. The failure occurred on the fifth flight, launched on 12 September 1985, when the third stage failed to ignite resulting in the rocket failing to achieve orbit. The ECS-3 and Spacenet-3 satellites were lost in the failure. Despite this sole loss, the reliability of the Ariane family meant that insurance costs for the launcher were actually less than that of rival American launchers. Throughout the 1980s, the platform became increasingly competitive on the global stage.

According to Harvey, the Ariane family had become the dominant series of launchers on the world market as early as 1986. Despite its relative success, the Ariane 3 was quickly replaced by the even more capable Ariane 4, resulting in the launcher only conducting a comparatively small number of launches. The Ariane 3 conducted its final flight on 12 July 1989, carrying the Olympus F1 satellite.

The finalised Ariane 2 is largely identical to its sibling, the Ariane 3, the only major difference being the lack of additional solid rocket boosters, which gave the Ariane 3 a higher payload capacity at a greater unit cost. The payload capacity of the Ariane 2 was to a geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO), exceeding that of the preceding Ariane 1.

== Launch history ==

The Ariane 2 first flew on 31 May 1986, during which it carried the Intelsat VA F-14 satellite. However, the third stage had a partial ignition followed by another ignition above nominal pressure which led to the engine&#x27;s failure. Because the upper stage of the Ariane 2 was shared with the other Ariane rockets, all flights were suspended until 16 September 1987. As a result of an investigation into the ignition irregularities, it was decided that installing more powerful igniters would sufficiently rectify the issue. Despite this incident, the reliability of the Ariane family meant that insurance costs for the launcher decreased until they were less than that of rival American launchers. Throughout the 1980s, the platform became increasingly competitive on the global stage.

Following its reintroduction, five further launches of the Ariane 2 were conducted, all of which were successful. The last Ariane 2 launch occurred on 2 April 1989, successfully placing Tele-X into orbit. According to Harvey, the Ariane family had become the dominant series of launchers on the world market as early as 1986. Even prior to the maiden flight of the Ariane 2, the family had been able to secure the majority of the global launcher market. Despite its relative success, the Ariane 2 was quickly replaced by the even more capable Ariane 4, which had resulted in the launcher only conducting a comparatively small number of launches.

==Career==

Richards&#x27;s acting career began when he was spotted by a casting director. This resulted in him getting a guest star role on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; as Vanessa&#x27;s boyfriend Roy in the season 5 episode &quot;Out of Brooklyn&quot;. Other guest appearances would come later on shows such as &quot;The Practice&quot;, &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;, &quot;Any Day Now&quot;, and &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;. Playing a rapping bike messenger who believes he is an alien abductee, it was the role of Taj Mahal in the Mark Taper Forum production of Tina Landau&#x27;s play &quot;Space&quot; that first brought recognition.
Richards has appeared in feature films &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; and &quot;Good Burger&quot;. He starred in the television movies &quot;Critical Assembly&quot; and &quot;Mutiny&quot;, and appeared as singer Richard Street in the NBC miniseries &quot;The Temptations&quot;. Richards has also guest-starred on &quot;The West Wing&quot; and &quot;The 4400&quot;.

Richards gained a recurring role beginning in the first season of &quot;Angel&quot; as Charles Gunn, a street-wise vampire hunter. He was promoted to a regular at the start of the second season, and remained a member of the cast throughout the rest of the show&#x27;s run.

Richards has so far been featured in four series as an attorney: Beginning in the first episode of season five of &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Conviction,&quot; Gunn becomes a lawyer after having his brain upgraded with a comprehensive knowledge of the law (both human and dæmonic) by the international and interdimensional law firm Wolfram &amp; Hart. In 2006, Richards joined the cast of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; spin-off &quot;Conviction&quot; as Billy Desmond, an undefeated New York City Assistant District Attorney with political aspirations. He has also been featured in CBS&#x27;s &quot;&quot; as the Floridian attorney Bob Villa, and portrayed attorney Marcus McGrath in the TNT series &quot;Raising the Bar&quot; until its cancellation.

Richards portrayed a young Richard Webber in two &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; episodes: &quot;The Time Warp&quot; in season six, and &quot;Only Mama Knows&quot; in season eleven. He also appeared in an episode of &quot;The Mentalist&quot;. Richards had played the part of Damon in &quot;Just Say Yes&quot;, a 1998 episode of the science fiction television series &quot;Sliders&quot;. Richards also guest-starred in an episode of Syfy&#x27;s &quot;Warehouse 13&quot;.

On April 5, 2013, TVLine confirmed that Richards had been given an unspecified role in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;  The character was later revealed to be a character named Mike Peterson, a human being with implants for injections of super-serum (similar to those of Captain America) known as Deathlok.

Also in 2013, Richards created his own sci-fi web series called &quot;The Hypnotist&quot;.

==Personal life==
Richards publicly came out as gay in April 2020. On September 1, 2023, Richards married his partner, model Joshua Gbor.

<doc id="159344" wikidata="Q483802" url="?curid=159344" title="Nickelback">
<text>Nickelback is a Canadian rock band formed in 1995 in Hanna, Alberta. Throughout its history, it has consisted of lead guitarist and lead vocalist Chad Kroeger, rhythm guitarist, keyboardist and backing vocalist Ryan Peake, and bassist Mike Kroeger. It went through several drummer changes between 1995 and 2005 before Daniel Adair joined.

The band signed with Roadrunner Records in 1999 and reached a mainstream breakthrough in 2002 with the single &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;, which reached number one in the United States and Canada. Its parent album, &quot;Silver Side Up&quot;, would go on to be certified 8× Platinum in Canada. Nickelback&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;The Long Road&quot;, was released in 2003 and spawned five singles, including Canadian number one &quot;Someday&quot;, which also reached No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In 2005, the band&#x27;s best-selling album to date, &quot;All the Right Reasons&quot;, produced three top-10 and five top-20 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, including &quot;Photograph&quot;, &quot;Far Away&quot;, and &quot;Rockstar&quot;, the latter of which was their biggest success in the United Kingdom. Nickelback released eight singles from their sixth album &quot;Dark Horse&quot; (2008), including the United States top-10 track &quot;Gotta Be Somebody&quot;. In 2011, the seventh album &quot;Here and Now&quot; topped the charts in Canada. The band has since released &quot;No Fixed Address&quot; (2014), &quot;Feed the Machine&quot; (2017), and most recently its 10th album &quot;Get Rollin&#x27;&quot; (2022).

Nickelback is one of the most commercially successful Canadian rock bands, having sold more than 50 million albums worldwide. In 2009, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it the most successful rock group and the seventh-most successful artist of that decade; &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; was the best-selling rock song and the fourth-best overall. In 2023, Nickelback were inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.

==History==
===Formation (1995)===
The band was formed in the early 1990s as a cover band called Village Idiot
by brothers Michael and Chad Kroeger; their cousin Brandon Kroeger and Ryan Peake rounded out the band. The band later changed its name to Nickelback, which originated from the nickel in change that band member Mike Kroeger gave customers at his job at Starbucks; he would frequently say, &quot;Here&#x27;s your nickel back.&quot;
The band performed covers of songs from Led Zeppelin and Metallica. Chad Kroeger then asked his step-father to loan him CA$4,000 so that the band could record their first demo, a seven-track EP of original material, called &quot;Hesher&quot; (1996).
The band spent half the money to record the EP, while Kroeger spent the other half on magic mushrooms to resell.

===&quot;Curb&quot; and &quot;The State&quot; (1996–2000)===
In 1996, the band recorded and released their first full-length album, &quot;Curb&quot;. &quot;Fly&quot; was included on both &quot;Hesher&quot; and &quot;Curb&quot; and was the first single produced by Nickelback. In 1997, Brandon Kroeger left the band and was replaced by Mitch Guindon; however, Guindon soon departed as well. While initially reported due to him starting work at a car company, Guindon&#x27;s departure came due to him &quot;not [being] meant for the road&quot;. Chad Kroeger stated that his skin was not able to handle cold weather and they convinced him to leave. In Summer 1998, Ryan Vikedal joined the band.

Roadrunner A&amp;R Ron Burman told HitQuarters that one of his West Coast scouts sent him the self-released album and, suitably impressed, he travelled to Vancouver to see them perform live. Although an unknown property in the industry at the time, the venue was packed out. In Burman&#x27;s words: &quot;I immediately got the chills! I thought their song &#x27;Leader of Men&#x27; was a smash hit.&quot; Off the stage he was impressed by their industry and initiative in managing their career. Despite this, it still took Burman three months for him to convince his label bosses to approve the signing, a decision that would mark Roadrunner&#x27;s first move into mainstream rock. Nickelback signed a record deal with EMI and Roadrunner Records in 1999.

&quot;The State&quot; was released by Nickelback in 2000 by Roadrunner Records and EMI Canada, followed by its release in Europe in 2001. It spawned 4 singles: &quot;Old Enough&quot;, &quot;Worthy to Say&quot;, &quot;Leader of Men&quot; and &quot;Breathe&quot;, the last two being Top 10 rock hits. The album was the band&#x27;s first album to be certified gold status and it later went into platinum status in 2008, after the success of their later albums. The album entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 130 and peaked at number 3 in the Billboard Top Heatseekers albums chart and peaked at number 6 on the Billboard Top Independent albums chart.

=== &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; and &quot;The Long Road&quot; (2001–2004) ===
Around 2001, Chad Kroeger started &quot;studying every piece, everything sonically, everything lyrically, everything musically, chord structure. I would dissect every single song that I would hear on the radio or every song that had ever done well on a chart and I would say, &#x27;Why did this do well?&#x27;&quot; Kroeger said that Nickelback&#x27;s single &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; sold so well because it was about romantic relationships, a universal subject, and contained memorable hooks.
To record their third album &quot;Silver Side Up&quot;, Nickelback collaborated with producer Rick Parashar. The album was written before the release of &quot;The State&quot; and was recorded at the same studio. The album was released on Tuesday, September 11, 2001. The album peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with over 177,000 copies sold in its first week and peaked at number one at the Canadian albums chart, making it the band&#x27;s first album to do so. The single &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; was a number one single on the Mainstream and Modern rock charts, as well as the pop chart. It also peaked at number two on Adult Top 40 and became the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number one single of the year for 2002. The next single was &quot;Too Bad&quot;, which also reached number one on the Mainstream Rock Chart. The final single from the album was &quot;Never Again&quot;, which also hit number one on Mainstream Rock.

In 2002, Chad Kroeger collaborated with Josey Scott on the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; theme song, &quot;Hero&quot;. This recording also featured Tyler Connolly, Mike Kroeger, Matt Cameron, and Jeremy Taggart. In 2002, Nickelback released their first DVD &quot;Live at Home&quot;. On August 19, 2002, an incident occurred while the band was performing at the Ilha do Ermal festival in Portugal. While performing the second song of their set, Chad Kroeger was sprayed with a full bottle of water hurled from somewhere within the audience. After finishing the song, Chad asked the crowd, &quot;Do you want to hear some rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll or do you want to go home?&quot; A person in the audience then threw a rock at Chad&#x27;s head. The band then left stage, with Chad and Vikedal giving the finger to the audience as they left. The band&#x27;s label, Roadrunner, posted video footage of the entire incident on their website.

In 2003, Nickelback released &quot;The Long Road&quot;. The album was certified 3× Platinum by the RIAA in March 2005 and it had sold 3,591,000 copies as of April 2011. It has sold over 5 million copies worldwide and, in 2003 alone, the album sold 2 million copies worldwide. It debuted at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. This was their first album produced by Joey Moi, a former classmate of the band&#x27;s.

&quot;The Long Road&quot; was ranked No. 157 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s &quot;200 Albums of the Decade&quot;. It spawned five singles. The lead single was &quot;Someday&quot;. The band also released &quot;Feelin&#x27; Way Too Damn Good&quot; as a single, which peaked at number three on the Mainstream Rock Charts. &quot;Figured You Out&quot; was also released as a single and topped the Mainstream Rock Charts for 13 consecutive weeks.

===&quot;All the Right Reasons&quot; (2005–2007)===
After wrapping up the band&#x27;s tour in support of &quot;The Long Road&quot; on New Year&#x27;s Day 2005, drummer Ryan Vikedal was fired after a royalty dispute. He was later replaced by 3 Doors Down&#x27;s drummer Daniel Adair. Kroeger later sued Vikedal to prevent him receiving any further royalties from Nickelback&#x27;s music, though the lawsuit was later settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. Nickelback promptly went into the studio with their new drummer from January through May 2005. The sessions resulted in their fifth studio album, &quot;All the Right Reasons&quot; which was released on October 3, 2005. It peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 323,350 copies in its first week in the United States, as well as producing five U.S. Hot 100 top 20 singles: &quot;Photograph&quot;, &quot;Savin&#x27; Me&quot;, &quot;Far Away&quot;, &quot;If Everyone Cared&quot; and &quot;Rockstar&quot;. Three of these became U.S. Hot 100 top 10 singles. Also, the album peaked at number one on the Canadian albums chart. The album sold more than 12 million singles and over 9 million ringtones. The album also made Nickelback the first band in Nielsen BDS history to have 5 singles on the CHR charts. It included appearances by Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, who played a guitar solo on the song &quot;Follow You Home&quot; and sang backing vocals on &quot;Rock Star&quot;—and a posthumously sampled appearance by Chad Kroeger&#x27;s friend Dimebag Darrell from Pantera, culled from guitar outtakes. &quot;All the Right Reasons&quot; had sold over 7 million copies in the U.S. to June 19, 2010.

The band spent much of 2006 and 2007 touring across the globe. In the fall of 2006, the band opened for Bon Jovi on the European leg of the Have a Nice Day Tour. Over 2 million fans attended Nickelback&#x27;s shows during those two years.

The band played at Sturgis, South Dakota to over 35,000 people at the 2006 Sturgis Bike Rally. The performance was filmed with 15 high-definition cameras. They released the DVD and Blu-ray of it in 2009, several years after the performance. In November 2006, the band won an American Music Award for best pop/rock album, surprising the band itself. &quot;We just kinda showed up because we were supposed to give one of these away tonight,&quot; Chad Kroeger said after receiving the award. He added that he had thought the Red Hot Chili Peppers would win the award.

===&quot;Dark Horse&quot; (2008–2010)===
After taking much of 2007 off, the band started recording a new album in earnest. In July 2008, the band signed with Live Nation for three touring and album cycles, with an option for a fourth. On September 4, 2008, it was announced that the first single from the upcoming album would be &quot;If Today Was Your Last Day&quot;, to be released on September 30, 2008. This announcement was however never confirmed: Roadrunner Records actually chose to release another song, &quot;Gotta Be Somebody&quot;, as the first single. It became Nickelback&#x27;s 5th and so far final single to hit the No. 1 spot on the U.S. Adult Top 40 chart. The new album, produced by Mutt Lange and titled &quot;Dark Horse&quot;, was released on November 18, 2008. &quot;Something in Your Mouth&quot; was released as the second single to rock radio only on December 15, 2008, where it reached number one. &quot;If Today Was Your Last Day&quot; was eventually released as a single after all on March 31, 2009: it became the third single from the album. Four more singles were released later in 2009, &quot;I&#x27;d Come for You&quot;, &quot;Burn It to the Ground&quot; and &quot;Never Gonna Be Alone&quot; released in September and &quot;Shakin&#x27; Hands&quot; as the seventh single on November 16. Its eighth single, &quot;This Afternoon&quot;, was released on March 23, 2010. &quot;Dark Horse&quot; was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on December 9, 2008, only three weeks after its North American release. All eight singles were major hits which finished at or near the top of at least one high-profile chart.

On November 26, 2008, the band announced the tour for the support of the album. Live Nation produced the tour and the band kicked off in Nashville, Tennessee, with Seether, and Saving Abel as their opening acts. The band then announced that they were about to tour in the UK with Black Stone Cherry as their opening act. The band then announced the second leg of the tour of North America with the opening acts being Hinder, Papa Roach, and once again, Saving Abel. The band then went on tour around Australia and New Zealand with Sick Puppies as their supporting act. For the second leg of the Europe tour, the band played with their opening act Daughtry. The third leg of the North America tour kicked off with Breaking Benjamin, Sick Puppies and Shinedown opening up for the band. The band concluded their tour with the fourth leg in North America which included Buckcherry and Three Days Grace. The tour was very successful and the band sold over 1.6 million tickets with 146 shows.

The album also remained in the top 20 on the Billboard 200 for weeks after its release. The album was certified two times platinum in April 2009, and had by April 2010 sold over 3 million copies in the U.S. However, critical reception of the album has been mostly mixed to negative. In 2009, the band won three Juno Awards for Juno Fan Choice Award, group of the year, and album of the year; the band performed their single &quot;Something in Your Mouth&quot; at the ceremony. In 2010, Billboard year end charts listed &quot;Dark Horse&quot; as the top-selling rock and metal album of the year. The band was also listed at the top selling hard rock artist. On January 29, 2010, they released a Tap-Tap rhythm game for on the App Store, contrary to the band&#x27;s prior comments against other music related video games such as &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;.
On February 28, 2010, Nickelback gave a performance at the beginning of the concert portion of the 2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony, performing &quot;Burn It to the Ground&quot;. In October 2010 Nickelback finished their Dark Horse Tour.

===&quot;Here and Now&quot; (2011–2013)===
Chad Kroeger said in an interview with Billboard.com in September 2010 that songwriting for the next Nickelback album was planned to commence as early as February 2011 with &quot;about four tunes&quot; already in mind. Adair mentioned that the band wanted to go back to the musical style of &quot;All The Right Reasons&quot;, which he described as &quot;more organic&quot;.

Nickelback announced their new album, &quot;Here and Now&quot;, on September 8, 2011, along with its two lead singles, &quot;Bottoms Up&quot; and &quot;When We Stand Together&quot;. Kroeger said &quot;We&#x27;re four people who love making music, the way we like to make it. We entered the studio this year with a vision, and it all came together. We&#x27;re extremely happy with the results, and can&#x27;t wait to share them with our fans.&quot; The album was released on November 21, 2011, with the band calling it &quot;Nickelblack Monday&quot;, a play on Nickelback and Black Monday. Two singles were released to radio stations on September 26, and September 27 for purchase on iTunes. &quot;Here and Now&quot; peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 226,714 copies in its first week of release, with &quot;Christmas&quot; by Michael Bublé taking number one by a margin of only 419 copies.

As part of promotion for the album, Nickelback was booked to perform at the halftime shows for both an NFL Thanksgiving Day game at Ford Field in Detroit on November 24, and the 99th Grey Cup in the band&#x27;s hometown of Vancouver on November 27. Also, as a promotion the band played to Jimmy Kimmel upon the album&#x27;s release. The band is nominated for 4 Juno Awards in 2012, and scheduled to perform at the ceremony. Nickelback announced their Here and Now Tour on January 11, 2012, they are going to tour with Seether, Bush and My Darkest Days. The band released a music video for their fourth single off of the album Lullaby. The band officially announced the compilation album &quot;The Best of Nickelback Volume 1&quot; through social media on October 3, 2013. Frontman Chad Kroeger had previously stated in an interview that the greatest hits album was to feature songs from previous albums along with new songs but the unveiled track listing ultimately contained only previously released material.

===&quot;No Fixed Address&quot; and &quot;Feed the Machine&quot; (2014–2018)===
According to an interview with Chad Kroeger on CFOX-FM, the band planned to release their eighth studio album before the end of 2014. The lead rock single was also announced, &quot;Edge of a Revolution&quot;, was released in August 2014. The track was described as a &quot;departure&quot; for Nickelback and a political song. Frequent collaborator Chris Lord-Alge returned to mix some of the tracks on the album. It was also announced the band had signed to Republic Records. The lead single from the album is titled &quot;Edge of a Revolution&quot;, and was scheduled to be sent for adds on Rock radio and be released to iTunes on August 18. The lead pop single, and second overall, was announced to be &quot;What Are You Waiting For?&quot;, and was released in September. &quot;What Are You Waiting For?&quot; was released as a single on digital retailers on September 9, 2014. On August 22, 2014, Nickelback announced the album&#x27;s title to be &quot;No Fixed Address&quot;, and released it on November 17, 2014.

No Fixed Address Tour was their fifth headlining concert tour, in support of &quot;No Fixed Address&quot;. The tour was announced on November 5, 2014, as well as The Pretty Reckless, Pop Evil, and Lifehouse as the support act for the majority of the shows in North American while Monster Truck was support act in Australia and Europe (2016). The second North American leg of the tour had to be canceled when lead vocalist Chad Kroeger required surgery for a cyst on his voice box. The entire leg of the European tour was postponed until Autumn 2016.

On August 19, 2016, Nickelback released a cover of Don Henley&#x27;s song &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot; to streaming services. On January 23, 2017, a new single, &quot;Feed the Machine&quot; was announced to be released on February 1, alongside specific details of a 2017 tour. On January 25, Nickelback signed with BMG Rights Management to release their ninth album, also titled &quot;Feed the Machine&quot;. The album was released on June 16, 2017. The band released their second single from the album, &quot;Song on Fire&quot;, on April 28, 2017. Shortly after the release of the album, the band began a 44-city tour on June 23, 2017, in North America, co-headlined with Daughtry, Shaman&#x27;s Harvest and Cheap Trick as supporting acts.

===&quot;Get Rollin&quot;&#x27; (2019–present)===
In early 2019, band members spoke of recording a tenth studio album, though Chad Kroeger conceded there was no timetable or rush for the band to complete it. Mike Kroeger spoke of his personal desire to move in more of a heavy metal direction, or wanting to do an album of Slayer cover songs.

On August 14, 2020, the band released a cover of The Charlie Daniels Band song &quot;The Devil Went Down to Georgia&quot;, featuring Dave Martone.

In a July 2021 interview bassist Mike Kroeger commented when asked about the band&#x27;s progress on new music saying &quot;That is happening right now, music is being composed and recorded up in Canada. We were out there, and something came up and our producer had to take some time off. So I took that opportunity to return home to Los Angeles with family and spend a little time at home but I&#x27;ll be headed back up there in a couple of weeks to pick it up again.&quot; When asked about a potential timeframe for a release date, Kroeger said &quot;it&#x27;ll be done when it&#x27;s done&quot;, explaining that the band would rather not be confined to a timescale for fear of making &quot;a shitty record&quot;. &quot;Release dates are primarily arrived at by business interests, like record labels and whatever. We don&#x27;t have one of those&quot;, he said. &quot;We&#x27;ve been managing ourselves for about a year. So, the answer is no. We&#x27;re doing it on our schedule, at our own pace, and it&#x27;ll be done when it&#x27;s done. &#x27;Cause we&#x27;ve blown up deadlines in the past lots of times. Because we feel that you can make a good record and be late, but you can&#x27;t, or you shouldn&#x27;t, make a shitty record to be on time. So we won&#x27;t be pressed for time.

In August 2022, Nickelback began posting small snippets and teasers of new music via their official social media accounts with the date &quot;09.07.2022&quot; being branded on the posts.

On August 26, 2022, students attending school at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia received a newsletter stating they were invited to attend and participate in a video shoot Nickelback would be hosting on August 30, 2022, for their single, outside the Convocation Mall on campus.

The album title was revealed to be &quot;Get Rollin&#x27;&quot;. The lead single &quot;San Quentin&quot; was released on September 7, 2022. The second single &quot;Those Days&quot; was released on October 5, 2022, followed by a music video on October 26. The band embarked on its &quot;Get Rollin&#x27; Tour&quot; with opening acts Brantley Gilbert and Josh Ross. They performed on thirty-eight dates in Canada and the United States from June 2023 to August 2023.

==Musical style and influences==

Nickelback has been described as various genres, including post-grunge, hard rock, pop rock, alternative rock, alternative metal, nu metal, heavy metal, and grunge.

Nickelback have cited bands and musicians such as Creedence Clearwater Revival, Bob Marley, Metallica, Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ozzy Osbourne
and U2 as influential or inspirational.

==Reception==

Despite their commercial success, Nickelback has been subjected to numerous jokes and a vocal negative response for some audiences, some of which is attributed to the perceived derivative, repetitive and formulaic nature of their music, as well as their over-use of hedonistic themes involving strippers, sex, prostitutes, drugs, and alcohol consumption. In the 2010s, Nickelback became the subject of internet memes that criticized their music, a status that the band came to embrace. Several sources, including &quot;CBC News&quot; and &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, named Nickelback the &quot;most hated&quot; band of the internet world. &quot;Stereogum&quot;&#x27;s Tom Breihan described Nickelback as &quot;the most widely disrespected rock band of the 21st century.&quot; In May 2013, the readers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine named Nickelback the second-worst band of the 1990s, behind only Creed. In November 2011, users of the music-oriented dating site Tastebuds.fm voted Nickelback as the number one &quot;musical turnoff&quot;. However, Chad Kroeger commented in a 2014 interview that the criticism helped him &quot;grow a thick skin&quot;, and that without it, they would be &quot;this just whatever band&quot;.

Various fellow musicians, like Chris Martin of Coldplay as well as producer Timbaland and singer Keyshia Cole, have publicly shown support for the band. Following their 2008 album &quot;Dark Horse&quot;, &quot;ChartAttack&quot; credited the band&#x27;s success to knowing their target audience: &quot;Chad Kroeger is a genius because he knows exactly what people want and precisely how far he can go. He turned out an extremely racy album that&#x27;s loaded with songs about gettin&#x27; drunk and doin&#x27; it all without breaking any taboos, and with enough love and moral authority to grease its passage into the mainstream. Rejoice, North America. This is your world.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; praised the band in a review of &quot;Dark Horse&quot; by saying: &quot;The bulletproof Nickelback provides affordable fun that promises good returns in hard times.&quot; In a review for the band&#x27;s ninth album &quot;Feed the Machine&quot;, AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that they had mostly done away with the crude and vulgar lyrical content they had become known for, and praised the band for evolving their sound.Journalist Sage Lazzaro claimed that Nickelback&#x27;s negative reputation began when the band signed to Roadrunner Records and was disliked by the label&#x27;s followers, which at the time was known for heavy metal music. In addition, Lazzaro also cites a frequently-aired 2003 commercial for Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn&quot; insulting Nickelback which gained mass exposure. In 2018, the band was defended in a teaser trailer for the film &quot;Once Upon a Deadpool&quot; by the title character. In response, Nickelback released a video in 2024 defending the sequel &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; from criticism.

The band is profiled in &quot;Hate to Love: Nickelback&quot;, a 2023 documentary film by Leigh Brooks which focuses on the band&#x27;s reputation.

<text>Ryan Anthony Peake (born March 1, 1973) is a Canadian musician, singer and songwriter who is best known as the rhythm guitarist, keyboardist, and backing vocalist of the Canadian rock band Nickelback. He has been with the band since their inception and is best known for his prominent vocals on the Nickelback songs &quot;Savin&#x27; Me&quot;, &quot;Hollywood&quot;, and &quot;Gotta Be Somebody&quot;. He has performed lead vocals on a range of different cover songs at live Nickelback concerts such as &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Alright for Fighting&quot;, &quot;Use Somebody&quot;, &quot;I Ran&quot;, &quot;Everlong&quot; and &quot;Super Bon Bon&quot;. When Nickelback performs Chad Kroeger&#x27;s solo hit &quot;Hero&quot; live, Ryan sings the vocal parts originally performed by Josey Scott. Peake has writing credits for several Nickelback songs such as &quot;Someday&quot;, &quot;Savin&#x27; Me&quot;, &quot;Miss You&quot;, and &quot;Edge of a Revolution&quot;. Peake&#x27;s instruments have included Gibson Flying Vs, Gibson Explorers, and Gibson Les Pauls. When Nickelback performs their song &quot;Photograph&quot;, he uses an acoustic guitar once owned by his father.

Peake &quot;grew up with solid metal&quot;, listing such bands as Anthrax, Megadeth, and Metallica as early favorites. He subsequently grew interested in Canadian country rock group Blue Rodeo, mentioning that their music &quot;really got me thinking about what fits together. Chord-wise, melody-wise, where harmonies feel good and feel right.&quot; Along with brothers Chad and Mike Kroeger, Peake cofounded Village Idiot, a cover band with a playlist consisting primarily of Metallica songs. The band mostly played in bars in and around Peake and the Kroegers&#x27; hometown of Hanna, Alberta, Canada. Later, the group reformed as Nickelback and Peake was responsible for the early funding of the band, borrowing $30,000 from a local bank on a line of credit. Early in his career, Peake primarily played Fender Telecasters.

Peake is married to Treana Peake, a Mount Pleasant, Vancouver-based fashion designer and philanthropist, actively involved in her charity-based fashion company, Obakki. The couple met in high school and have two children together. Peake tests new music he&#x27;s working on with his wife, son, daughter, and brother.

<text>The Persistence of Vision Ray Tracer, most commonly acronymed as POV-Ray, is a cross-platform ray-tracing program that generates images from a text-based scene description. It was originally based on DKBTrace, written by David Kirk Buck and Aaron A. Collins for Amiga computers. There are also influences from the earlier Polyray raytracer because of contributions from its author, Alexander Enzmann. POV-Ray is free and open-source software, with the source code available under the AGPL-3.0-or-later license.

==History==

Sometime in the 1980s, David Kirk Buck downloaded the source code for a Unix ray tracer to his Amiga. He experimented with it for a while and eventually decided to write his own ray tracer named DKBTrace after his initials. He posted it to the &quot;You Can Call Me Ray&quot; bulletin board system (BBS) in Chicago, thinking others might be interested in it. In 1987, Aaron A. Collins downloaded DKBTrace and began working on an x86 port of it. He and David Buck collaborated to add several more features.

When the program proved to be more popular than anticipated, they could not keep up with demand for more features. Thus, in July 1991, David turned over the project to a team of programmers working in the &quot;GraphDev&quot; forum on CompuServe. At the same time, David felt that it was inappropriate to use his initials on a program he no longer maintained. The name &quot;STAR-Light&quot; (Software Taskforce on Animation and Rendering) was initially used, but eventually the name became &quot;PV-Ray&quot;, and then ultimately &quot;POV-Ray&quot; (Persistence of Vision Ray Tracer), a name inspired by Dalí&#x27;s painting, &quot;The Persistence of Memory&quot;.

Features of the application, and a summary of its history, are discussed in a February 2008 interview with David Kirk Buck and Chris Cason on episode 24 of FLOSS Weekly.

==Features==
POV-Ray has matured substantially since it was created. Recent versions of the software include the following features:

* a Turing-complete scene description language (SDL) that supports macros and loops
* a library of ready-made scenes, textures, and objects
* support for a number of geometric primitives and constructive solid geometry
* several kinds of light sources
* atmospheric effects such as fog and &quot;media&quot; (smoke, clouds)
* reflections, refractions, and light caustics using photon mapping
* surface patterns such as wrinkles, bumps, and ripples, for use in procedural textures and bump mapping
* radiosity
* support for textures and rendered output in many image formats, including TGA, PNG, and JPEG, among others
* extensive user documentation
* support for custom output resolutions (This includes extreme resolutions such as 16K)
* two types of SSAA Type 1 is an adaptive, non-recursive, super-sampling method. It is &quot;adaptive&quot; because not every pixel is super-sampled. Type 2 is an adaptive and recursive super-sampling method. It is &quot;recursive&quot; because the pixel is sub-divided and sub-sub-divided recursively. The &quot;adaptive&quot; nature of type 2 is the variable depth of recursion.

One of POV-Ray&#x27;s main attractions is its large collection of third-party-made assets and tools. A large number of tools, textures, models, scenes, and tutorials can be found on the web. It is also a useful reference for those wanting to learn how ray tracing and related 3D geometry and computer graphics algorithms work.

===Current version===
The current official version of POV-Ray is 3.7. This version introduces:

* support for symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), to allow the renderer to take advantage of multiple processors
* support for high-dynamic-range imaging (HDRI), including the OpenEXR and radiance file formats
* improved bounding using BSP trees

Some of the main introduced features of the previous release (3.6) are:

* extending UV mapping to more primitives
* adding 16- and 32-bit integer data to a density file
* improving 64-bit compatibility

In July 2006, Intel Corporation started using the beta version of 3.7 to demonstrate their new dual-core Conroe processor due to the efficiency of the SMP (symmetric multiprocessing) implementation.

===Primitives===
POV-Ray, in addition to standard 3D geometric shapes like tori, spheres, and heightfields, supports mathematically defined &quot;primitives&quot; such as the isosurface (a finite approximation of an arbitrary function), the polynomial primitive (an infinite object defined by a 15th order or lower polynomial), the julia fractal (a 3-dimensional slice of a 4-dimensional fractal), the superquadratic ellipsoid (an intermediate between a sphere and a cube), and the parametric primitive (using equations that represent its surface, rather than its interior).

POV-Ray internally represents objects using their mathematical definitions; all POV-Ray primitive objects can be described by mathematical functions. This is different from many computer programs that include 3D models, which typically use triangle meshes to compose all the objects in a scene.

This fact provides POV-Ray with several advantages and disadvantages over other rendering and modeling systems; POV-Ray primitives are more accurate than their polygonal counterparts: objects that can be described in terms of spheres, planar surfaces, cylinders, tori, and the like, are perfectly smooth and mathematically accurate in POV-Ray renderings, whereas polygonal &quot;artifacts&quot; may be visible in mesh-based modeling software. POV-Ray primitives are also simpler to define than most of their polygonal counterparts, e.g., in POV-Ray, a sphere is described simply by its center and radius; in a mesh-based environment, a sphere must be described by a multitude of small connected polygons (usually quads or triangles).

On the other hand, script-based primitive modeling is not always a practical method to create certain objects, such as realistic characters or complex man-made artifacts like cars. Those objects can be created first in mesh-based modeling applications such as Wings 3D and Blender, and then they can be converted to POV-Ray&#x27;s own mesh format.

===Examples of the scene description language===
The following is an example of the scene description language used by POV-Ray to describe a scene to render. It demonstrates the use of a background colour, camera, lights, a simple box shape having a surface normal and finish, and the transforming effects of rotation.


 #version 3.6;
// Includes a separate file defining a number of common colours
 #include &quot;colors.inc&quot;
 global_settings { assumed_gamma 1.0 }

// Sets a background colour for the image (dark grey)
 background { color rgb &lt;0.25, 0.25, 0.25&gt; }

// Places a camera
// direction: Sets, among other things, the field of view of the camera
// right: Sets the aspect ratio of the image
// look_at: Tells the camera where to look
 camera { location &lt;0.0, 0.5, -4.0&gt;
 direction 1.5*z
 right x*image_width/image_height
 look_at &lt;0.0, 0.0, 0.0&gt; }

// Places a light source
// color: Sets the color of the light source (white)
// translate: Moves the light source to a desired location
 light_source { &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;
 color rgb &lt;1, 1, 1&gt;
 translate &lt;-5, 5, -5&gt; }
// Places another light source
// color: Sets the color of the light source (dark grey)
// translate: Moves the light source to a desired location
 light_source { &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;
 color rgb &lt;0.25, 0.25, 0.25&gt;
 translate &lt;6, -6, -6&gt; }

// Sets a box
// pigment: Sets a color for the box (&quot;Red&quot; as defined in &quot;colors.inc&quot;)
// finish: Sets how the surface of the box reflects light
// normal: Sets a bumpiness for the box using the &quot;agate&quot; in-built model
// rotate: Rotates the box
 box { &lt;-0.5, -0.5, -0.5&gt;,
 &lt;0.5, 0.5, 0.5&gt;
 texture { pigment { color Red }
 finish { specular 0.6 }
 normal { agate 0.25 scale 1/2 }
 rotate &lt;45,46,47&gt; }
The following script fragment shows the use of variable declaration, assignment, comparison and the while loop construct:


 #declare the_angle = 0;

 #while (the_angle &lt; 360)
 box { &lt;-0.5, -0.5, -0.5&gt;
 &lt;0.5, 0.5, 0.5&gt;
 texture { pigment { color Red }
 finish { specular 0.6 }
 normal { agate 0.25 scale 1/2 } }
 rotate the_angle }
 #declare the_angle = the_angle + 45;
 #end
==Modeling==
The POV-Ray program itself does not include a modeling feature; it is essentially a pure renderer with a sophisticated model description language. To accompany this feature set, third parties have developed a large variety of modeling software, some specialized for POV-Ray, others supporting import and export of its data structures, including the free and open-source 3D creation suite Blender.

A number of additional POV-Ray compatible modelers are linked from Povray.org: Modelling Programs.

In 2007, POV-Ray acquired the rights to Moray , an interactive 3-D modeling program long used with POV-Ray. However, as of December 2016, Moray development is stalled.

==Software==
===Development and maintenance===
Official modifications to the POV-Ray source tree are done and/or approved by the POV-Team. Most patch submission and/or bug reporting is done in the POV-Ray newsgroups on the news.povray.org news server (with a Web interface also available). Since POV-Ray&#x27;s source is available there are unofficial forks and patched versions of POV-Ray available from third parties; however, these are not officially supported by the POV-Team.

Official POV-Ray versions currently do not support shader plug-ins. Some features, like radiosity and splines are still in development and may be subject to syntactical change.

===Platform support===
POV-Ray 3.6 is distributed in compiled format for Mac, Windows and Linux.
Support for Intel Macs is not available in the Mac version, but since Mac OS X is a version of Unix the Linux version can be compiled on it.

The 3.7 versions with SMP support are officially supported for Windows and Linux. Unofficial Mac versions for v3.7 can be found.

POV-Ray can be ported to any platform which has a compatible C++ compiler.

===Licensing===
Originally, POV-Ray was distributed under its own &quot;POV-Ray License&quot;; namely, the POV-Ray 3.6 Distribution License and the POV-Ray 3.6 Source License, which permitted free distribution of the program source code and binaries, while restricting commercial distribution and the creation of derivative works other than fully functional versions of POV-Ray.

Although the source code of older versions is available for modification, due to the above 3.6 and prior license restrictions, it was not open source or free software according to the OSI or the FSF definition of the term. This was a problem as source code exchange with the greater FOSS ecosystem was impossible due to license incompatibility with copyleft licenses.

One of the reasons that POV-Ray was not originally licensed under the free software GNU General Public License (GPL), or other open source licenses, is that POV-Ray was developed before the GPL-style licenses became widely used; the developers wrote their own license for the release of POV-Ray, and contributors to the software worked under the assumption their contributions would be licensed under the POV-Ray 3.6 Licenses.

In 2013, with version 3.7, POV-Ray was relicensed under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (or later). Thus POV-Ray is since then free software according to the FSF definition and also open source software according to the Open Source Definition.

<text>Chad Robert Kroeger (, Turton; born November 15, 1974) is a Canadian musician who is the lead singer and guitarist of the rock band Nickelback. In addition to his work with Nickelback, Kroeger has been involved with a variety of collaborations, appearing as a guest musician in several songs and has contributed in both production and songwriting. He has co-written several songs for other artists and films.

==Early life==
Kroeger was born Chad Robert Turton in Hanna, Alberta, on November 15, 1974. His maternal grandfather, politician Henry Kroeger, was born in Rosenthal, Chortitza Colony, Yekaterinoslav Governorate (now Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine) to a Mennonite family of Prussian descent. After his father left the family when he was two, he started going by his mother&#x27;s maiden name of Kroeger. He learned to play the guitar at age 13. His youth was sometimes troubled, and he was sent to juvenile detention for breaking into his junior high school.

==Career==
===Nickelback===

In the early 1990s, Kroeger was part of a grunge cover band, Village Idiot, with his cousin Brandon Kroeger and future Nickelback members bassist Mike Kroeger (his half-brother) and singer Ryan Peake. In 1995, Kroeger, Peake, Mike Kroeger, and then-drummer Brandon Kroeger, formed the band Nickelback. Kroeger has continued to record and tour with this band for more than 25 years.

===The Suits XL===
In 2001, Kroeger founded the band The Suits XL. Band members included Sam Loubier-Demers and Yohann Gosselin on vocals and guitars, drummer Patrick Paquet, keyboardist Felix-Antoine Berube and singer Oliver Roy de Belleval. The next year, he co-founded the Vancouver-based 604 Records. Later, in 2006, The Suits XL released an album through this label. The next year the band was nominated for a Canadian Indie Award.

===Collaborations===

Kroeger produced music for the bands Default, Theory of a Deadman, and Bo Bice.

Kroeger, along with Saliva vocalist Josey Scott, Theory of a Deadman lead vocalist (serving as guitarist for this track) Tyler Connolly and Pearl Jam drummer Matt Cameron, performed the theme song titled &quot;Hero&quot; for the hit movie &quot;Spider-Man&quot; in 2002. Also in 2002, Kroeger wrote and sang on &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You &amp; I&quot; for Santana&#x27;s &quot;Shaman&quot;. However, when Arista decided to release the song as a single in Summer 2003, Kroeger&#x27;s label, Roadrunner, refused permission, citing concerns that Kroeger appearing on a &quot;high-profile single&quot; would compromise the excitement over Nickelback&#x27;s fall 2003 release &quot;The Long Road&quot;. Kroeger recommended The Calling&#x27;s Alex Band, another Arista artist, as a replacement for re-recording the single.

In 2003, Kroeger won an International Achievement Award for the song &quot;Hero&quot; at the SOCAN Awards in Toronto.

In 2007, Chad Kroeger worked with Santana for a second time, when he co-wrote and recorded guitar and vocals parts for a new song meant to appear on the compilation album &quot;Ultimate Santana&quot;. The track is called &quot;Into the Night&quot; and was released as a single on October 2, 2007. The album &quot;Ultimate Santana&quot; was released in October. Besides working with Santana, Kroeger also recorded with Travis Tritt on his album &quot;The Storm&quot;, where Tritt did a cover of Nickelback&#x27;s &quot;Should&#x27;ve Listened&quot; track from &quot;The Long Road&quot;.

Kroeger also wrote and played guitar on Bo Bice&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re Everything&quot;.

Chad Kroeger, Eric Dill, Rune Westberg and Chris Daughtry wrote the debut single of Daughtry&#x27;s new album. The single, titled &quot;No Surprise&quot;, was debuted on American Idol Wednesday, May 6, 2009. Kroeger also contributed writing to another song from the album titled &quot;Life After You.&quot; He and Brett James co-wrote Tim McGraw&#x27;s 2009 single &quot;It&#x27;s a Business Doing Pleasure with You.&quot; 

Kroeger featured on the Timbaland album Shock Value 2 with the song &quot;Tomorrow in the Bottle&quot;, which also features Sebastian. In 2010, he provided guest vocals, along with Ludacris and guest lead guitarist Zakk Wylde, on the My Darkest Days single &quot;Porn Star Dancing&quot;.

In 2011, Kroeger was featured on the Steel Panther album &quot;Balls Out&quot; with the song &quot;It Won&#x27;t Suck Itself.&quot; In early 2012, it was confirmed that Kroeger was working with French-Canadian pop rock singer Avril Lavigne on her fifth studio album.

==Personal life==
In 2008, Kroeger was convicted of drunk driving in a British Columbia court after he was stopped for speeding in Surrey.

Kroeger started dating Canadian singer Avril Lavigne on July 1, 2012. The relationship started after they began working together in March 2012 to write and record music for Lavigne&#x27;s fifth album. Kroeger and Lavigne became engaged in August 2012. They married in the south of France on July 1, 2013, which is Canada Day. Lavigne and Kroeger honeymooned in Portofino, Italy. In September 2014, the entertainment media began reporting that Lavigne and Kroeger were headed for separation after a year of marriage. On September 2, 2015, Lavigne announced their separation via her official Instagram account.

In 2015, the second leg of the band&#x27;s North American tour had to be cancelled so Kroeger could have surgery for a cyst on his larynx. The entire leg of the European tour was cancelled as well.

<doc id="159352" wikidata="Q51319" url="?curid=159352" title="Glen Matlock">
<text>Glen Matlock (born 27 August 1956) is an English musician, best known for being the bass guitarist in the original line-up of the punk rock band the Sex Pistols. He is credited as a songwriter on 10 of the 12 songs on the Sex Pistols&#x27; only officially released studio album, &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot;, although he had left the band early in the recording process, credited as bassist and backing vocalist on only one song on the album, &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot; However, on the bootleg album &quot;Spunk&quot;, Matlock played bass on all the songs, which included earlier studio recordings of 10 of the 12 songs that later appeared on the &quot;Bollocks&quot; album.

Since leaving the Sex Pistols in 1977, he has performed with several other bands, including Rich Kids, who scored a UK No. 24 hit with the single &quot;Rich Kids&quot; in 1978, as well as presenting his own work. After the death of his replacement in the Sex Pistols, Sid Vicious, Matlock has resumed bass guitar duties for subsequent Sex Pistols reunions, including the 1996 Filthy Lucre Tour, the 2002 concert to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, their 2003 North American Piss Off Tour, and their 2007–08 UK and Europe Combine Harvester Tour.

==Biography==
===Sex Pistols===

Matlock attended Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art until 1974. He was the original bass player of the Sex Pistols, having been introduced to guitarist Steve Jones and drummer Paul Cook while working in Sex, Malcolm McLaren&#x27;s clothing boutique in London. He is credited as co-writer on 10 of the 12 songs appearing on the album &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot;, and as bassist and backing vocalist on the song &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot;. However, his overall contribution to the album has been disputed: Jones said in a 2011 interview he was &quot;tired of Matlock&#x27;s claims that he had co-written some of the punk icon&#x27;s biggest tunes&quot;, stating that he himself had written as many songs as Matlock, whilst Matlock himself notes in his autobiography, &quot;I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol&quot;, that the band only wrote two songs after his departure. According to a 2014 interview, he played a big role in writing the songs that appeared on the album. Cook has stated that Matlock actually wrote most of the songs on the album. Additionally, whilst Jones has insisted that Matlock disliked many of Johnny Rotten&#x27;s lyrics, Matlock has said that he had no issue with them.

Matlock left the band in late February 1977, with contemporary reports (given to news outlets by manager Malcolm McLaren) stating that he was &#x27;thrown out&#x27; because he liked the Beatles. The claim was fictional, with Steve Huey of AllMusic claiming that Matlock &quot;was even more enamored of The Faces and the mod groups prominently featured on London pirate radio in the late &#x27;60s, as were Steve Jones and Paul Cook&quot;. Another claim, made at the time by Jones, that he thought it bizarre that Matlock was &quot;always washing his feet&quot;, has also been misquoted and misinterpreted as the cause of Matlock&#x27;s firing from the group.

In &quot;I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol&quot;, Matlock stated that he left the band of his own volition as he was &quot;sick of all the bullshit&quot;. In the 2000 documentary &quot;The Filth and the Fury&quot;, the band members generally agree that there was tension between Matlock and Rotten, which Matlock suggests was further aggravated by Malcolm McLaren in an attempt to generate chaos within the band as a creative mechanism.

In his autobiography, &quot;&quot;, John Lydon stated that Matlock worked on Sex Pistols material (including their album &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot;), after he had left the band, as a paid session musician. However, Matlock denied the &quot;session musician&quot; label, stating that all but two of the songs appearing on the album had already been recorded as singles or b-sides before his departure. Jones played bass on the two songs recorded after Matlock&#x27;s departure and overdubbed some additional parts on other existing songs, with Vicious also contributing to the song &quot;Bodies&quot;. Music historian David Howard states that Matlock did not participate in any of the &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot; recording sessions. In the 2002 Classic Albums documentary about &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot;, Jones stated that in retrospect, pushing Matlock out of the band was a mistake: &quot;We were what we were. Who cares if he washed his feet? That was him. I&#x27;m sure I had things that bugged him&quot;. He also conceded that the band could have recorded more albums had Matlock stayed and they had not participated in the television interview with Bill Grundy.

===After the Sex Pistols===
Matlock went on to form Rich Kids, a new wave power pop band, with himself as bass guitarist and singer, Midge Ure (guitarist, singer and keyboard player), Steve New (guitarist and singer) and Rusty Egan (drummer). They released three singles and one album entitled &quot;Ghosts of Princes in Towers&quot; (which reached No. 51). Matlock and New later played with Vicious in the short-lived band Vicious White Kids.

After Rich Kids, he formed the Spectres with Tom Robinson Band guitarist Danny Kustow, and subsequently Mick Hanson, and then Hot Club in 1982 with guitarist James Stevenson and singer Steve Allen. Matlock also played bass on the Iggy Pop album &quot;Soldier&quot; and the Damned album &quot;Not of This Earth&quot;. Under the moniker Rhode-Twinn, Matlock (and Steve New) was brought to play on Gary Twinn&#x27;s 1990 single &quot;Bike Boy&quot; on Bernard Rhodes&#x27; own Sacred record label. Twinn and Matlock stayed in touch and began writing and recording with the Damned drummer Rat Scabies and Generation X guitarist Bob &quot;Derwood&quot; Andrews as Dead Horse in 1996. A US tour was arranged, but almost immediately Matlock reunited with the Sex Pistols and the group was disbanded.

Matlock rejoined the original Sex Pistols members for reunion tours in 1996, 2002, 2003, 2007 and 2008. He played bass guitar and sang for a time in the bands the Philistines and the Flying Padovanis. He toured with a loose collective of punk and post-punk stars, Dead Men Walking, which included Mike Peters of the Alarm, Kirk Brandon of Theatre of Hate and Spear of Destiny, and Pete Wylie of Wah! He is now a member of Slinky Vagabond with Earl Slick, Clem Burke and Keanan Duffty. Slinky Vagabond played their debut concert at the Joey Ramone Birthday Bash in May 2007. One newspaper, comparing the current lifestyles of the Sex Pistols, wrote: &quot;Only original bassist Glen Matlock remains touring with his own band, an irony given that he was sacked for being too conservative&quot;.

In January 2010, Glen Matlock reformed Rich Kids for a one-off benefit concert in aid of Steve New. He was joined on stage by original members Rusty Egan and Midge Ure, as well as Mick Jones of the Clash and Gary Kemp from Spandau Ballet. New died of cancer on 24 May 2010.

Matlock joined a reformed Faces, playing at the Vintage at Goodwood festival near Chichester in August 2010. In April 2011, he stood in for Mani playing bass for Primal Scream at the Japan Tsunami appeal concert at Brixton Academy in London.

In late 2011, the International Swingers, a band comprising Matlock, Clem Burke, James Stevenson and Gary Twinn, was formed. The band, based in Los Angeles, toured Australia and the USA and continues to perform occasionally and released a self titled album in 2015.

In 2012, Matlock made his acting debut in British drama film &quot;The Paddy Lincoln Gang&quot;, performing a docudrama scene at a live Faces concert.

In 2013 and 2014, he toured with the New York Dolls&#x27; Sylvain Sylvain on the Sex Dolls Tour. He has spoken publicly against Brexit.

Matlock joined Blondie for their April 2022 UK and US tour, filling in for bassist Leigh Foxx who was unable to tour due to a back injury. This continued into the 2023 festival season with Matlock playing with the band at Glastonbury festival. He also played the April 2024 festival shows in Australia.

Matlock is portrayed by Christian Lees in the 2022 Craig Pearce - Danny Boyle FX biographical drama miniseries, &quot;Pistol&quot;. Matlock said he was very disappointed with the series: &quot;My portrayal, and particularly my leaving the band — I left the band; I was not sacked. That whole episode where Steve sacked [me] is just bollocks.&quot;

He signed a new worldwide record deal with Cooking Vinyl and released his new album, &quot;Consequences Coming&quot;, on 27 April 2023. The first single released was &quot;Head On A Stick&quot;. &quot;The album was written and recorded in Britain over the last 18 months or so with a posse of seasoned but on-point performers,&quot; Matlock said. &quot;All done during the debacle that is Brexit and the rise and fall of the turgid Trump episode in the US. These songs reflect my take on the whole sorry mess that has ensued&quot;.

==Personal life==
Matlock&#x27;s son, Sam, is also a musician, who has played in Dead! and Wargasm.

<text>Sir Harrison Birtwistle (15 July 1934 – 18 April 2022) was an English composer of contemporary classical music best known for his operas, often based on mythological subjects. Among his many compositions, his better known works include &quot;The Triumph of Time&quot; (1972) and the operas &quot;The Mask of Orpheus&quot; (1986), &quot;Gawain&quot; (1991), and &quot;The Minotaur&quot; (2008). The last of these was ranked by music critics at &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2019 as the third-best piece of the 21st century. Even his compositions that were not written for the stage often showed a theatrical approach. A performance of his saxophone concerto &quot;Panic&quot; during the BBC&#x27;s Last Night of the Proms caused &quot;national notoriety&quot;. He received many international awards and honorary degrees.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Harrison Birtwistle was born in Accrington, a mill town in Lancashire around 20 miles north of Manchester. His parents, Fred and Madge Birtwistle, ran a bakery, and his interest in music was encouraged by his mother. She bought him a clarinet when he was seven and arranged for him to have lessons with the local bandmaster. He attended Accrington Grammar School. Much of his youth was spent roaming the countryside near his home, and his frustration with the disruption of the nature by modern technology would affect his later work profoundly. Other youthful activities included the construction of amateur theatrical sets, and the subsequent imagining of dramas taking place inside them. Birtwistle became proficient enough to play in the local military-style band and also played in the orchestra that accompanied Gilbert and Sullivan productions and the local choral society&#x27;s performances of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;. From around this time Birtwistle first composed, later describing his early pieces as &quot;sub-Vaughan Williams&quot;.

In 1952 he entered the Royal Manchester College of Music in Manchester on a clarinet scholarship. While there he came in contact with contemporaries including Peter Maxwell Davies, Alexander Goehr, the pianist John Ogdon, and the trumpeter Elgar Howarth. Between 1955 and 1957 he completed national service in the Royal Artillery (Plymouth) Band, based in Oswestry.

===Composing career===
Birtwistle served as director of music at Cranborne Chase School from 1962 until 1965, before continuing his studies at Princeton University on a Harkness Fellowship, where he completed the opera &quot;Punch and Judy&quot; to a libretto by Stephen Pruslin. It was premiered at the Aldeburgh Festival; Benjamin Britten is said to have left during intermission. This work, together with &quot;Verses for Ensembles&quot; and &quot;The Triumph of Time&quot;, led to greater exposure for Birtwistle in the classical music world. The orchestral work &quot;The Triumph of Time&quot;, inspired by a woodcut by Pieter Bruegel, premiered in 1972.

In 1972, he wrote the music to the film &quot;The Offence&quot;, starring Sean Connery, his only film score. In 1975, he became musical director of the newly established Royal National Theatre in London, a post he held until 1983. He received a knighthood (1988) and was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (2001). From 1994 to 2001 he was Henry Purcell Professor of Composition at King&#x27;s College London. Birtwistle was the 1987 recipient of the University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition for his epic opera &quot;The Mask of Orpheus&quot;.

Though well-established in the classical music world, Birtwistle was relatively unknown to the general public until the mid-1990s, when two events increased his profile with the wider audience. In 1994 two anti-modernist musicians, Frederick Stocken and Keith Burstein, calling themselves &quot;The Hecklers&quot;, organised a demonstration at the first night of a revival of his opera &quot;Gawain&quot; at the Royal Opera House, London. The following year, Birtwistle&#x27;s saxophone concertante work &quot;Panic&quot; was premiered in the second half of the Last Night of the Proms, as the first piece of contemporary music ever, to an estimated worldwide television audience of 100 million. According to the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, it met with incomprehension from many viewers.

In 1995, he was awarded the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize. At the 2006 Ivor Novello Awards he criticised pop musicians at the event for performing too loudly and using too many clichés.

Among the musicians who performed his works are conductors Pierre Boulez, Sir Andrew Davis, Daniel Barenboim, Christoph von Dohnányi, Oliver Knussen and Simon Rattle, violinist Christian Tetzlaff, the soloist in the world premiere of his violin concerto in 2011, and pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard, the soloist in the first performance of his &quot;Responses&quot; for piano and orchestra in 2014.

=== Private life ===
Birtwistle had a low media profile, but occasionally gave interviews. In 2019, he was interviewed for &quot;Composer of the Week&quot; on BBC Radio 3. He married Sheila Duff, a singer, in 1958. The couple had three sons, two of whom, Adam and Silas, are artists. Sheila died in 2012.

Birtwistle had a stroke in 2021 and died at his home in Mere, Wiltshire, on 18 April 2022, aged 87.

== Music ==
=== Style ===
Birtwistle&#x27;s music is not categorised as belonging to any particular school or movement. For a time, he was described as belonging to the Manchester School, a phrase invented as a parallel to the Second Viennese School to refer to Birtwistle, Goehr, and Davies. Birtwistle&#x27;s music is complex, written in a modernistic manner with a clear, distinctive voice, with sounds described as of &quot;sonic brashness&quot;.

His early work is sometimes evocative of Igor Stravinsky and Olivier Messiaen, whom he acknowledged as influences, and his technique of juxtaposing blocks of sound is sometimes compared to that of Edgard Varèse. Hearing the work of Boulez (&quot;Le Marteau sans maître&quot;) and Stockhausen (&quot;Zeitmaße&quot; and &quot;Gruppen&quot;) in his youth was also inspirational, with that of the latter composer in particular influencing his wind quintet, &quot;Refrains and Choruses&quot; (1957). His early pieces made frequent use of ostinati and often had a ritualistic feel. These were toned down in Birtwistle&#x27;s later decades as his compositional style developed.

Even when not creating a visual piece involving stage action, Birtwistle&#x27;s musical output remained frequently theatrical in conception. The music does not follow the logic and rules of classical forms such as sonata form, but is structured more like a drama. Furthermore, different musical instruments can almost be seen to take the part of different characters in the drama. This is especially apparent in a performance of &quot;Secret Theatre&quot; (1984). For various portions of the piece, a number of the instrumentalists perform in a soloist capacity. For this, they leave their seat in the ensemble and stand separately, to one side of the ensemble, returning to the group when they are no longer given that role.

<text>The BBC Proms is an eight-week summer season of daily orchestral classical music concerts and other events held annually, predominantly in the Royal Albert Hall in central London. Robert Newman founded The Proms in 1895. Since 1927, the BBC has organised and broadcast The Proms. Each season consists of concerts in the Royal Albert Hall, chamber music concerts at Cadogan Hall (or occasionally other venues), additional Proms in the Park events across the UK on the Last Night of the Proms, and associated educational and children&#x27;s events. Recently, concerts have been held in additional cities across different nations of the UK, as part of Proms Around the UK. 
The season is a significant event in British culture and in classical music. Czech conductor Jiří Bělohlávek described the Proms as &quot;the world&#x27;s largest and most democratic musical festival&quot;.

&quot;Prom&quot; is short for &quot;promenade concert&quot;, a term which originally referred to outdoor concerts in London&#x27;s pleasure gardens, where the audience was free to stroll around while the orchestra was playing. In the context of the BBC Proms, &quot;promming&quot; refers to the use of the standing areas inside the hall (the Arena and Gallery) for which ticket prices are much lower than for the seating. Proms concert-goers, particularly those who stand, are sometimes referred to as &quot;Prommers&quot; or &quot;Promenaders&quot;.

==History==
===Origins and Sir Henry Wood===
Promenade concerts had existed in London&#x27;s pleasure gardens since the mid-18th century, and indoor proms became a feature of 19th century musical life in London from 1838, notably under the direction of Louis Antoine Jullien and Sir Arthur Sullivan. The annual series of Proms continuing today had their roots in that movement. They were inaugurated on 10 August 1895 in the Queen&#x27;s Hall in Langham Place by the impresario Robert Newman, who was fully experienced in running similar concerts at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre. Newman wished to generate a wider audience for concert hall music by offering low ticket prices and an informal atmosphere, where eating, drinking and smoking were permitted to the promenaders. He stated his aim to Henry Wood in 1894 as follows:
George Cathcart, an otolaryngologist, gave financial backing to Newman for the series (called &quot;Mr Robert Newman&#x27;s Promenade Concerts&quot;) on condition that Henry Wood be employed as the sole conductor. Wood, aged 26, seized this opportunity and built the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra&quot; as the ensemble specially devoted to performing the promenade concerts. Cathcart also stipulated (contrary to Newman&#x27;s preference) the adoption of French or Open Diapason concert pitch, necessitating the acquisition of an entirely new set of wind instruments for the orchestra, and the re-tuning of the Queen&#x27;s Hall organ. This coincided with the adoption of this lower pitch by other leading orchestras and concert series. Although the concerts gained a popular following and reputation, Newman went bankrupt in 1902, and the banker Edgar Speyer took over the expense of funding them. Wood received a knighthood in 1911. In 1914 anti-German feeling led Speyer to surrender his role, and music publishers Chappell &amp; Co. took control of the concerts.

Although Newman remained involved in artistic planning, it was Wood&#x27;s name which became most closely associated with the Proms. As conductor from the first concert (which opened with Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Rienzi&quot; overture) in 1895, Sir Henry was largely responsible for building the repertoire heard as the series continued from year to year. While including many popular and less demanding works, in the first season there were substantial nights devoted to Beethoven or Schubert, and a programme of new works was given in the final week. Distinguished singers including Sims Reeves and Signor Foli appeared. In the first two decades Wood firmly established the policy of introducing works by contemporary composers (both British and international) and of bringing fresh life to unperformed or under-performed works. A bronze bust of Sir Henry Wood recovered from the ruins of the bombed-out Queen&#x27;s Hall in 1941, and now belonging to the Royal Academy of Music, is still placed in front of the organ for the whole Promenade season. Though the concerts are now called the BBC Proms, and are headlined with the BBC logo, the tickets are subtitled &quot;BBC Music presents the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts&quot;.

In 1927, following Newman&#x27;s sudden death in the previous year, the BBC – later based at Broadcasting House next to the hall – took over the running of the concerts. This arose because William Boosey, then managing director of Chappell &amp; Co. (the Prom. proprietors), detested broadcasting and saw the BBC&#x27;s far-reaching demands and intentions in the control of musical presentation as a danger to the future of public concerts altogether. He decided to disband the New Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra, which played for the last time at a Symphony concert on 19 March 1927. He found it more expedient to let the Queen&#x27;s Hall to the broadcasting powers, rather than to continue the Promenade concerts and other big series independently in an unequal competition with what he saw as effectively the Government itself. So the Proms were saved, but under a different kind of authority. The personnel of the New Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra effectively continued until 1930 as &quot;Sir Henry J. Wood and his Symphony Orchestra&quot;. When the BBC Symphony Orchestra (BBC SO) was formed in 1930, it became the main orchestra for the concerts. At this time the season consisted of nights dedicated to particular composers; Mondays were Wagner, Fridays were Beethoven, with other major composers being featured on other days. There were no Sunday performances.

===During World War II===

With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the BBC withdrew its support. However private sponsors stepped in to maintain the Proms, always under Sir Henry Wood&#x27;s direction, until the Queen&#x27;s Hall was devastated beyond repair during an air raid in May 1941. (The site is now occupied by the St George&#x27;s Hotel and BBC Henry Wood House). The concerts then moved (until 1944) to their current home, the Royal Albert Hall, during the Promenade season presented by Keith Douglas in conjunction with the Royal Philharmonic Society (of which he was Secretary).

The London Symphony Orchestra had sometimes assisted in the series since (after 1927) the New Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra had ceased to function, and in 1942 Sir Henry Wood also invited the London Philharmonic Orchestra under its new leader Jean Pougnet to participate in this and subsequent seasons. In this he was attempting to maintain vigour in the programme, under the renewal of its relationship with the BBC as promoters. Sir Henry Wood continued his work with the Proms through vicissitudes with the BBC until his death in 1944, the year of his Jubilee Season. During that period Sir Adrian Boult, chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, and Basil Cameron also took on conducting duties for the series, continuing them in 1944 when, under increased danger from bombing, they were moved again, this time to the Bedford Corn Exchange (home of the BBC Symphony Orchestra since 1941) which hosted them until the end of the War.

===Post-war===
Sir Adrian Boult and Basil Cameron continued as conductors of the Promenade Concerts after the War, on their return to the Royal Albert Hall, until the advent of Malcolm Sargent as Proms chief conductor in 1947. Sargent held this post until 1966; his associate conductor from 1949 to 1959 was John Hollingsworth. Sargent was noted for his immaculate appearance (evening dress, carnation) and his witty addresses where he good-naturedly chided the noisy Prommers. Sir Malcolm championed choral music and classical and British composers, especially Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. The charity founded in his name, CLIC Sargent, continues to hold a special Promenade Concert each year shortly after the main season ends. CLIC Sargent, the Musicians&#x27; Benevolent Fund and further musical charities (chosen each year) also benefit from thousands of pounds in donations from Prommers after most concerts. When asking for donations, Prommers from the Arena regularly announce to the audience the running donations total at concert intervals through the season, or before the concert when there is no interval.

After Wood&#x27;s death, Julian Herbage acted as &quot;de facto&quot; principal administrator of the Proms for a number of years, as a freelance employee after his retirement from the BBC, with assistance from such staff as Edward Clark and Kenneth Wright. During the tenure of William Glock as Controller of the Proms, from 1960 to 1973, the Proms repertory expanded both forwards in time, to encompass then contemporary and avant-garde composers such as Boulez, Berio, Carter, Dallapiccola, Peter Maxwell Davies, Gerhard, Henze, Ligeti, Lutosławski, Lutyens, Maw, Messiaen, Nono, Stockhausen, and Tippett, as well as backwards to include music by past composers such as Purcell, Cavalli, Monteverdi, Byrd, Palestrina, Dufay, Dunstaple, and Machaut, as well as less-often performed works of Johann Sebastian Bach and Joseph Haydn. From the 1960s, the number of guest orchestras at the Proms also began to increase, with the first major international conductors (Leopold Stokowski, Georg Solti, and Carlo Maria Giulini) performing in 1963, and the first foreign orchestra, the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra, performing in 1966. Since that time, almost every major international orchestra, conductor and soloist has performed at the Proms. In 1970, Soft Machine&#x27;s appearance led to press attention and comment as the first &quot;pop&quot; band to perform there.

The 1968 season began on a Friday night instead of the usual Saturday night. This concert marked a tribute to Sir Malcolm Sargent who had died shortly after delivering a brief speech from the rostrum at the Last Night in 1967. He had been too ill to actually conduct that concert. Every year since then, the Proms have always started on a Friday night in July.

===Since 1990===
The Proms continue today, and still present newly commissioned music alongside pieces more central to the repertoire and early music. Innovations continue, with pre-Prom talks, lunchtime chamber concerts, children&#x27;s Proms, Proms in the Park either appearing, or being featured more heavily over the past few years. In the UK, all concerts are broadcast on BBC Radio 3, an increasing number are televised on BBC Four with some also shown on BBC One and BBC Two. The theme tune that used to be played at the beginning of each programme broadcast on television (until the 2011 season) was an extract from the end of the &quot;Red&quot; movement of Arthur Bliss&#x27;s &quot;A Colour Symphony&quot;, in 2017 Anna Clyne&#x27;s
&quot;Masquerade&quot; (a Proms commission in 2013) and since 2019 an original theme by Ian Arber. It is also possible to hear the concerts live from the BBC Proms website. The Last Night is also broadcast in many countries around the world.

In 1996, a related series of eight lunchtime chamber concerts was started, taking place on Mondays during the Proms season. In their first year these were held in the Britten Hall of the Royal College of Music (just across Prince Consort Road from the Albert Hall). The following year they moved slightly further afield, to the Henry Cole Lecture Theatre at the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 2005, they moved further again, to the new Cadogan Hall, just off London&#x27;s Sloane Square. These allow the Proms to include music which is not suitable for the vast spaces of the Albert Hall.

From 1998 to 2007, the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; Prom, in partnership with long-running BBC television programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, was an annual fixture. Aimed at children and families, the Prom is informal, including audience participation, jokes, and popular classics. High demand for tickets – which are among the lowest priced in the season – saw this Prom split in 2004 into two Proms with identical content. In 2008, the Blue Peter Prom was replaced with a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Prom which was revived in both the 2010 and 2013 seasons.

The 2004 season also featured the Hall&#x27;s newly rebuilt pipe organ. It took two years to complete the task (2002–2004) and was the work of Noel Mander, Ltd., of London. It was the first complete restoration of the instrument since Harrison and Harrison&#x27;s work in 1936.

The tradition of Promming remains an important aspect of the festival, with over 1000 standing places available for each concert, either in the central arena (rather like the groundlings in the pit at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe) or high in the hall&#x27;s gallery. Promming tickets cost the same for all concerts (currently £8 as of 2023), providing a considerably cheaper option for the more popular events. Since most promming tickets cannot be bought until 10:30am on the morning of the concert (although there are full-season tickets and weekend passes available), they provide a way of attending otherwise sold-out concerts.

In 2010, the Proms Archive was introduced on the BBC Proms webpage, to allow for a systematic searching of all works that have been performed and all artists who have appeared at the Proms since their inception. On 1 September 2011, a Prom given by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra was severely affected by interruptions from pro-Palestinian protesters. While the Palestine Solidarity Campaign had urged a boycott, they denied being behind the disruption inside the Royal Albert Hall. For the first time ever, the BBC took a Prom concert off the air.

Successive Controllers of the Proms after Glock have been Robert Ponsonby (1973–1985), John Drummond (1986–1995), Nicholas Kenyon (1996–2007), and Roger Wright (2007–2014). Between 1986 and 2014, the post of Director, BBC Proms had mostly been combined with the role of Controller, BBC Radio 3. Edward Blakeman, editor of BBC Radio 3, became interim Proms Director upon Wright&#x27;s departure in July 2014. In May 2015, the BBC announced the appointment of David Pickard as Director of BBC Proms, in succession to Wright. In November 2023, the BBC announced that Pickard is to stand down as Proms Director after the 2024 season. In February 2024, Sam Jackson became Director of The Proms.

==Last Night of the Proms==
Many people&#x27;s perception of the Proms is based on the Last Night, although this is very different from the other concerts. It usually takes place on the second Saturday in September, and is broadcast in the UK on BBC Radio 3, and on television on BBC Two (first half) and BBC One (second half). The concert is traditionally in a lighter, &#x27;winding-down&#x27; vein, with popular classics followed by a second half of British patriotic pieces. This sequence traditionally includes Edward Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Pomp &amp; Circumstance March No. 1&quot; (to part of which &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; is sung) and Henry Wood&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia on British Sea Songs&quot;, followed by Thomas Arne&#x27;s &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot;. The concert concludes with Hubert Parry&#x27;s &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, and the British national anthem, since 2010 in an arrangement by Benjamin Britten. The repeat of the Elgar march at the Last Night can be traced to the spontaneous audience demand for a double encore after its premiere at a 1901 Proms concert. The closing sequence of the second half became fully established in 1954 during Sargent&#x27;s tenure as chief conductor. The Prommers have made a tradition of singing &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; after the end of the concert, but this was not included in the programme until 2015. However, when James Loughran, a Scot, conducted the Last Night concert in the late 1970s and early 1980s he did include the piece within the programme.

Tickets are highly sought-after. Promming tickets are priced the same as for that season&#x27;s concerts, but seated tickets are more expensive. To pre-book a seat, an initial selection is released to winners of a ballot open to those who have booked five or more Prom concerts, and in 2023 there was also an advance sale to those who had seats booked for the cancelled 2022 event. After the advance-booking period, there is no requirement to have booked for additional concerts, but by then the Last Night is mostly sold out, although returns may be available. For standing places, a full season pass automatically includes admission to the Last Night; some day Prommers can get limited tickets available on various dates by presenting five ticket-stubs from previous concerts, either in the Arena or Gallery (prior to 2009, the requirement was for six other concerts) but most day Promming tickets are open to everyone on the morning of the concert, whether they have booked before or not.
 In the post-war period, with the growing popularity of the Last Night, the only way to obtain tickets was through a postal ballot held well-in-advance.

Prommers with tickets are likely to queue up much earlier than usual (many overnight, and in past years, some slept outside the hall for up to three weeks to guard their place – although this is no longer permitted) to ensure a good place to stand; the resulting camaraderie adds to the atmosphere. Some attend in fancy dress, from dinner jackets to patriotic T-shirts. Many use the occasion for an exuberant display of Britishness. Union Flags are waved by the Prommers, especially during &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot;. Other national flags, balloons, and party poppers are all welcomed – although John Drummond discouraged &#x27;extraneous noise&#x27; during his tenure as director.

Sir Henry Wood&#x27;s bust is adorned with a laurel chaplet by representatives of the Promenaders, who often wipe an imaginary bead of sweat from his forehead or make some similar gentle, visual joke. As with the rest of the season, the cost of promming tickets (standing tickets) is just £8. Many consider these to be the best tickets due to the atmosphere of standing in the hall for up to three hours; albeit with a twenty-five minute interval.

Another tradition is that near the end of the concert the conductor makes a speech thanking the musicians and audiences, mentioning the main themes of the season, noting the cumulative donation collected for the Promenaders&#x27; musical charities over the season, and announcing the date of the First Night for the following year. This tradition dates from 1941, when Sir Henry Wood gave the first such speech at the close of that season, which was the first at the Royal Albert Hall, when he thanked colleagues and sponsors. Wood gave a similar speech at the 1942 Last Night, and a pre-recorded version was played at the 1943 Last Night. During his tenure as conductor, Sir Malcolm Sargent established the tone of making the Last Night speech more humorous. Subsequent conductors have generally continued this, although one exception was in 1997 when Andrew Davis addressed the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales, Mother Teresa, and Sir Georg Solti in 1997.

Leonard Slatkin, chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra from 2000 to 2004, expressed a desire to tone down the nationalism of the Last Night, and during the seasons from 2002 until 2007 &quot;Rule Britannia&quot; was only heard as part of Henry Wood&#x27;s &#x27;&quot;Fantasia on British Sea Songs&quot; (another piece traditional to the Last Night) rather than separately. Slatkin, an American and the first non-Commonwealth citizen to lead the Last Night, conducted his first in 2001, just days after the 9/11 attacks. The atmosphere was more restrained and less festive than normal, with a heavily revised programme where the finale of Beethoven&#x27;s 9th Symphony replaced the &quot;Sea Songs&quot;, and Samuel Barber&#x27;s &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; was performed in tribute to 9/11 victims.

On the day of the 2005 Last Night, the hall management received word of a bomb threat, which led to a thorough search of the Albert Hall for 5 hours, but the concert took place after a short delay. This has led to increased security concerns, given the stature of the Last Night in British culture, which Jacqui Kelly of the Royal Albert Hall staff noted:

2008 also contained some departures from the traditional programme. &quot;Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1&quot; was moved to after the conductor&#x27;s speech. In addition, most of Wood&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia on British Sea Songs&quot; was replaced by Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;Sea Songs&quot; as a final tribute in his anniversary year. However, Wood&#x27;s arrangements of naval bugle calls from the start of the &quot;Fantasia&quot; were retained, and Sargent&#x27;s arrangement of &quot;Rule Britannia&quot; returned with Bryn Terfel as soloist. As on his 1994 Last Night appearance, he sang one verse in a Welsh translation, with the chorus also translated into Welsh. Additionally, 2008 saw the inclusion of Scottish composer Anna Meredith to the programme for her Proms premiere, &quot;froms&quot;, which involved five different groups of musicians telecasting in from around Britain.

2009 saw the continued absence of Wood&#x27;s &quot;Sea Songs&quot;, this time replaced by specially commissioned fanfares, and extracts from Handel&#x27;s &quot;Music for the Royal Fireworks&quot;. In 2009, for the first time, the Last Night was shown live in several cinemas across Asia and in Canada and Australia.

In 2016, anti-Brexit protestors waved EU flags in addition to the usual Union Jack flags. The protests have continued in subsequent years. In 2020, the concert was performed to an empty hall, due to the COVID-19 restrictions in place in the UK. Two years later, in 2022, the concert was cancelled 48 hours before it was scheduled to happen, following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, the first Last Night cancellation since 1944. Dalia Stasevska had been selected to conduct. Stasevska returned to conduct the First Night in 2023, while Marin Alsop conducted the Last Night. This marked the first time that the BBC Proms had female conductors open and close the season. As a result of the cancellation, the date for the First Night of the 2023 Proms wasn&#x27;t announced until April 2023.

===Last Night conductors===
The following table lists by year the conductors of the Last Night of the Proms. In general, since the tenure of Sargent, the Chief Conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra has led this concert, but guest conductors have directed the Last Night on several occasions. Additionally, the tradition was for a British conductor, and if not the current serving Chief Conductor, one who had an association with the BBC Symphony Orchestra or one of the other BBC orchestras. Charles Mackerras was the first non-British-born conductor to lead the Last Night, in 1980. Leonard Slatkin was the first American conductor of the Last Night in 2001. Jiří Bělohlávek was the first non-native English speaker to conduct the Last Night, in 2007. Marin Alsop was the Last Night&#x27;s first female conductor in 2013.


==Proms in the Park==
The Royal Albert Hall could be filled many times over with people who would wish to attend. To involve extra people, and to cater for those who are not near London, the Proms in the Park concerts were started in 1996. Initially there was one, in Hyde Park adjacent to the Hall, which was a simple video relay of the concert at the Royal Albert Hall. As audiences grew, Proms in the Park started to have musicians of their own on stage, including the BBC Concert Orchestra.

In the 2000s, Proms in the Park started to be held in other locations across the UK, usually with one of the BBC&#x27;s orchestras playing. In 2005, Belfast, Glasgow, Swansea and Manchester hosted a Last Night Prom in the Park, broadcast live from each venue. In 2007 Manchester&#x27;s prom was replaced by one in Middlesbrough. In 2008 the number reduced from five to four, in Hyde Park, Belfast, Glasgow and Swansea. 2009 returned to a total of five, in Hyde Park, Glasgow, Swansea, County Down and Salford. Each location has its own live concert, typically playing the national anthem of the host country, before joining in a live big screen video link up with the Royal Albert Hall for the traditional finale.

In later years Proms in the Park became a series of established events in their own right, with events in Hyde Park and in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, managed by BBC Scotland, BBC Cymru Wales and BBC Northern Ireland respectively, in conjunction with the host local authority. Each event has a presenting team, a live orchestra, a video link to the Last Night of the Proms in London, and guest soloists and choirs. Events tend to move to different cities to cover a wider geographical area within the host nations.

All of these events were incorporated within BBC One&#x27;s live coverage of the Last Night of the Proms, with live link-ups to each of the venues. However, some more traditional elements of the Last Night of the Proms (such as &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, &quot;Rule Britannia&quot; and &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot;) were removed on some years depending on local politics.

As the popularity of Proms in the Park grew, many communities across the UK decided to hold their own &quot;Proms in the Park&quot; events that were not affiliated with the BBC. The last official Proms in the Park took place in 2019, and no plans for its return have been announced.
The first live relays outside of London were to Swansea and Birmingham in 1999.

In 2001, there were also live link-ups to Cornwall and Liverpool.

In 2011, Caerphilly&#x27;s Proms in the Park was cancelled before the concert started due to heavy rainfall

<text>The Battle of Kosovo took place on 15 June 1389 between an army led by the Serbian Prince Lazar Hrebeljanović and an invading army of the Ottoman Empire under the command of Sultan Murad I.

The battle was fought on the Kosovo field in the territory ruled by Serbian nobleman Vuk Branković, in what is today Kosovo, about northwest of the modern city of Pristina. The army under Prince Lazar consisted mostly of his own troops, a contingent led by Branković, and a contingent sent from Bosnia by King Tvrtko I, commanded by Vlatko Vuković. Additionally, Lazar was also supported by a Christian coalition from various European ethnic groups. Prince Lazar was the ruler of Moravian Serbia and the most powerful among the Serbian regional lords of the time, while Branković ruled the District of Branković and other areas, recognizing Lazar as his overlord.

Reliable historical accounts of the battle are scarce. The bulk of both armies were wiped out, and Lazar and Murad were killed. Murad&#x27;s assassination is attributed to a Serbian knight named Miloš Obilić. The battle marked the only time in history when an Ottoman Sultan was killed in battle. Serbian manpower was depleted and had no capacity to field large armies against future Ottoman campaigns, which relied on new reserve forces from Anatolia. The Serbian principalities that were not already Ottoman vassals, became so in the following years.

The mythologization of the battle and writings began shortly after the event, though the legend was not fully formed immediately after the battle but evolved from different originators into various versions. In Serbian folklore, the Kosovo Myth acquired new meanings and importance during the rise of Serbian nationalism in the 19th century as the Serbian state sought to expand, especially towards Kosovo which was still part of the Ottoman Empire. In modern discourse, the battle would come to be seen as integral to Serbian history, tradition and national identity. Vidovdan is celebrated on June 28 and is an important Serbian national and religious holiday as a memorial day for the Battle of Kosovo.

==Background==
Emperor Stefan Uroš IV Dušan &quot;the Mighty&quot; (r. 1331–55) was succeeded by his son Stefan Uroš V &quot;the Weak&quot; (r. 1355–71), whose reign was characterized by the decline of central power and the rise of numerous virtually independent principalities; this period is known as the fall of the Serbian Empire. Uroš V was neither able to sustain the great empire created by his father nor repulse foreign threats and limit the independence of the nobility; he died childless in December 1371, after much of the Serbian nobility had been destroyed by the Ottomans in the Battle of Maritsa earlier that year. Prince Lazar, ruler of the northern part of the former empire (of Moravian Serbia), was aware of the Ottoman threat and began diplomatic and military preparations for a campaign against them.

After the defeat of the Ottomans at Pločnik (1386) and Bileća (1388), Murad I, the reigning Ottoman sultan, moved his troops from Philippoupolis to Ihtiman (modern Bulgaria) in the spring of 1388. From there they traveled across Velbužd and Kratovo (modern North Macedonia). Though longer than the alternative route through Sofia and the Nišava Valley, this led the Ottoman forces to Kosovo, one of the most important crossroads in the Balkans. From Kosovo, they could attack the lands of either Prince Lazar or Vuk Branković. Having stayed in Kratovo for a time, Murad and his troops marched through Kumanovo, Preševo, and Gjilan to Pristina, where he arrived on June 14.

While there is less information about Lazar&#x27;s preparations, he gathered his troops near Niš, on the right bank of the South Morava. His forces likely remained there until he learned that Murad had moved to Velbužd, whereupon he moved across Prokuplje to Kosovo. This was the best place he could choose as a battlefield, as it gave him control of all the routes that Murad could take. The historiographical examination of the battle is challenging. No first-hand accounts from participants in the battle exist. Contemporary sources are written from widely diverging points of view and not much is discussed in them about battle tactics, army size and other battleground details.

==Army composition==
Estimates about army size vary, but the Ottoman army was larger. It is likely that the army led by Lazar had 12,000/15,000 to 20,000 troops against 27,000–30,000 led by Murad. A higher estimate places the size of Murad&#x27;s army up to 40,000 and Lazar&#x27;s up to 25,000 troops. Ottoman historian Mehmed Neşri who authored the first detailed report in Ottoman historiography about the battle of Kosovo in 1521 represents the Ottoman imperial narrative. As an Ottoman Sultan died before or during the battle, the size of the Christian army is presented as significantly larger in Ottoman sources. Neşri placed it at around 500,000, double the size of the Ottoman army. According to historian Noel Malcolm, Ottoman writers were most likely eager to build up the size and significance of Lazar&#x27;s army, which they described as vastly outnumbering Murat&#x27;s, in order to add to the glory of the &quot;Turkish victory&quot;. Moreover, Malcolm claims that the Ottoman sources lack reliability. Regardless of the exact army size, the battle of Kosovo was one of the largest battles of late medieval times. In comparison, in the battle of Agincourt (1415) even by assuming the higher estimate of army size as correct, around 10,000 fewer soldiers were engaged. The Ottoman army was supported by auxiliary troops from the Anatolian Turkoman Beylik of Isfendiyar, and comprised no more than 2,000 Janissaries.

Lazar&#x27;s main forces included the Serbian contingent from his principality, troops of Vuk Branković his son in law and Bosnian forces under Vlatko Vuković, sent by Lazar&#x27;s ally King Tvrtko of Bosnia. Based on Neşri&#x27;s account, Đurađ II Balšić has also been linked to the Christian coalition which fought in the battle. The hypothesis about his participation is considered to be &quot;almost entirely false&quot; as he had become an Ottoman vassal; he was in hostility with Lazar&#x27;s ally Tvrtko I; and at the time of the battle he was most likely in Ulcinj. 

Both armies contained soldiers of various origins. Lazar&#x27;s Christian coalition included Albanians, Croatians, Hungarians and Bulgarians. Teodor II Muzaka, Dhimitër Jonima and other Albanian lords and aristocrats participated in the battle on the side of the Christian coalition, bringing a band of Albanians to join Lazar&#x27;s army. Of those Albanian lords, Teodor II Muzaka died during the battle, alongside a number of fellow Albanians. Contemporary Greek authors list among participants northern Albanians, those of Himarë, Epirus and the coast. Based on Ottomans sources, it is claimed by Albanian historiography that the Albanians accounted for around a quarter of the total number of troops in Lazar&#x27;s coalition, primarily under the command of Dhimitër Jonima, Đurađ II Balšić and Teodor II.

According to historian Dejan Djokić, it is improbable that Lazar commanded a broad coalition composed of Albanians, Bulgarians, Czechs, Hungarians, Germans and Vlachs, in addition to his and Vuk Branković’s armies and reinforcements from Bosnia. Daniel Waley says that next to nothing can be said with assurance about numbers and multi-ethnic composition of both armies.

A group of crusaders linked to the Knights of Rhodes, led by John of Palisna, has been suggested as participants on Lazar&#x27;s side by Croatian historian Neven Budak, who quotes in the Italian Chronicles , &quot; (Ban John with those marked by a cross). According to Budak, &quot; probably refers to John of Palisna the Ban of Croatia, but the writer of the Chronicles could have been honouring someone who was no longer a ban, such as John Horvat. British historian and Hospitaller scholar Anthony Luttrell disputes Budak’s assumption that &quot;&quot; means the Knights Hospitaller, stating, “Hospitallers wore a cross but technically were not crusaders or , how the author of the understood the term is uncertain.” Budak himself suggests that the term could simply designate warriors who marked a cross on their clothing, a customary practice before going to war against infidels.

===Troop deployment===

Serbian forces assembled at Kosovo Field approximately 3 miles northwest of Priština. Prince Lazar led the Serb center, Branković took command of the right, while Vuković the Bosnian general commanded the left, which also included the foreign contingents. The formidable Serb cavalry took their place at the forefront, with lighter cavalry armed with bows positioned on the flanks.

Murad led the Ottoman center, entrusting his younger son Bayezid and his commander Evrenoz with the European troops on the right wing; Murad&#x27;s other son, Yakub, led the Anatolian troops on the left. The wings were fortified with around 1,000 archers, while the Janissaries held the central position, supported by Murad and his cavalry guard standing behind them. Ottoman sources claim that Murat also placed camels in front to scare the Serbian cavalry. One of the Ottoman commanders was Pasha Yiğit Bey.

==Battle==

Serbian and Turkish accounts of the battle differ, making it difficult to reconstruct the course of events. It is believed that the battle commenced with Ottoman archers shooting at Serbian cavalry, who then made ready for the attack. After positioning in a wedge formation, the Serbian cavalry managed to break through the Ottoman left wing, but were not as successful against the center and the right wing.

The Serbs had the initial advantage after their first charge, which significantly damaged the Ottoman wing commanded by Yakub Çelebi. When the knights&#x27; charge was finished, light Ottoman cavalry and light infantry counterattacked and the Serbian heavy armor became a disadvantage. In the center, Serbian troops managed to push back Ottoman forces, except for Bayezid&#x27;s wing, which barely held off the Bosnians commanded by Vlatko Vuković, who inflicted disproportionately heavy losses on the Ottomans. The Ottomans, in a ferocious counterattack led by Bayezid, pushed the Serbian forces back and then prevailed later in the day, routing the Serbian infantry. Both flanks still held, with Vuković&#x27;s Bosnian troops drifting toward the center to compensate for the heavy losses inflicted on the Serbian infantry.

Historical facts say that Vuk Branković saw that there was no hope for victory and fled to save as many men as he could after Lazar was captured. In popular oral tradition, however, Branković is said to have fled and betrayed Lazar, a theory which was first presented by the writer Mavro Orbini in a 1601 work but is largely seen as unfounded. Sometime after Branković&#x27;s retreat from the battle, the remaining Bosnian and Serb forces yielded the field, believing that a victory was no longer possible.

In one of the earliest accounts of the battle, it is described that twelve Serbian knights, known in Serbian epic poetry as the Jugović brothers, successfully breached the Ottoman defense. One of the knights, later identified as Miloš Obilić, pretended to have deserted to the Ottoman forces. When brought before Murad, Obilić pulled out a hidden dagger and killed the Sultan by slashing him. He was then killed by the Sultan&#x27;s bodyguards. There are differing versions of the assassination however, with another version describing Obilić playing dead on the battlefield and stabbing the Sultan as he walked. It is also unclear when the assassination occurred, as some sources suggest it happened once the battle turned against the Serbs or in the immediate aftermath of the battle, while others describe it happening early on as Miloš sought to prove his loyalty to Prince Lazar after he was accused of treachery. The battle marked the only time in history an Ottoman Sultan was killed in battle.

==Aftermath==

=== Early reports ===
The event of the battle quickly became known in Europe. Not much attention was paid to the outcome in these early rumors which circulated, but they all focused on the fact that the Ottoman Sultan had been killed in the battle. Some of the earliest reports about the battle come from the court of Tvrtko of Bosnia who in separate letters to the senate of Trogir (August 1) and the council of Florence claimed that he had defeated the Ottomans in Kosovo. The response of the Florentines to Tvrtko (20 October 1389) is an important historical document as it confirms that Murad was killed during the battle and that it took place on June 28 (St. Vitus day/Vidovdan). The killer is not named, but it was one of 12 Serbian noblemen who managed to break through the Ottoman lines:

Another Italian account, Mignanelli&#x27;s work of 1416, asserted that it was Lazar who killed the Ottoman sultan.

===Geopolitical consequences===
Both armies were destroyed in the battle. Both Lazar and Murad lost their lives, and the remnants of their armies retreated from the battlefield. Murad&#x27;s son Bayezid killed his younger brother, Yakub Çelebi, upon hearing of their father&#x27;s death, thus becoming the sole heir to the Ottoman throne. The Serbs were left with too few men to defend their lands effectively, while the Turks had many more troops in the east. The immediate effect of the depletion of Serbian manpower was a shift in the stance of Hungarian policy towards Serbia. Hungary tried to exploit the effects of battle and expand in northern Serbia, while the Ottomans renewed their campaign in southern Serbia as early as 1390–1391. Domestically, the Serbian feudal class in response to these threats split in two factions. A northern faction supported a conciliatory, pro-Ottoman foreign policy as a means of defence of their lands against Hungary, while a southern faction which was immediately threatened by Ottoman expansion sought to establish a pro-Hungarian foreign policy. Some Serbian feudal lords continued to fight against the Ottomans and others were integrated in the Ottoman feudal hierarchy. Consequently, some of the Serbian principalities that were not already Ottoman vassals became so in the following years. These feudal lordsincluding the daughter of Prince Lazarformed marriage ties with the new Sultan Bayezid.

In the wake of these marriages, Stefan Lazarević, Lazar&#x27;s son, became a loyal ally of Bayezid, and contributed significant forces to many of Bayezid&#x27;s future military engagements, including the Battle of Nicopolis, where Vuk Branković another Serbian magnate who ruled in parts of Kosovo had joined the anti-Ottoman coalition. As a reward for his contribution to the Ottoman victory, Lazarević was given a large part of Branković&#x27;s lands. Branković himself died as an Ottoman prisoner, although in all later &quot;Kosovo myth&quot; narratives first created by Stefan Lazarević, he is portrayed as a betrayer of the Christians. Lazarević&#x27;s success as an Ottoman vassal was such that eventually his lands encompassed a territory bigger than his father&#x27;s and matched the territories of the Nemanjic dynasty in the 13th century. After Mehmed&#x27;s death in 1421, Lazarević was one of the vassals who strongly supported the coalition against the future Mehmed the Conqueror who ultimately prevailed. This move led Mehmed to punish the Serbian and all other vassals who supported the other claimants to the throne by campaigning against them to directly annex their lands. In a series of campaigns from this era onward Serbia formally became an Ottoman province. The capture of Smederevo on June 20, 1459 marks the end of medieval Serbian statehood.

==Legacy==

The Kosovo Myth has for a long time been a central subject in Serbian folklore and Serbian literary tradition, and for centuries was cultivated mostly in the form of oral epic poetry and guslar poems. The mythologization of the battle occurred shortly after the event. The legend was not fully formed immediately after the battle but evolved from different originators into various versions. The philologist Vuk Karadžić collected traditional epic poems related to the topic of the Battle of Kosovo and in the 19th century, he released the so-called &quot;Kosovo cycle&quot;, which became the final version of the transformation of the myth. The modern narrativization of the legend focuses on three main motifs: sacrifice, betrayal and heroism, exemplified respectively by Prince Lazar choosing a &quot;heavenly kingdom&quot; over an &quot;earthly kingdom&quot;, Vuk Branković&#x27;s supposed desertion and Miloš Obilić&#x27;s assassination of Murad.

In Serbian historiography, the complicated political setting preceding the battle has been simplified in the battle being a clash between Christianity and Islam. However, Miodrag Popović notes that in Ottoman Serbia of the 16th and 17th century, the local population was &quot;Turkophilic&quot; in accordance with the general climate of necessary adaptation to Ottoman rule. Тhey did not give the legend of the Battle of Kosovo an interpretation unfavorable or hostile to the Ottoman Turks. Perceptions about the Battle of Kosovo in Serbian public discourse changed and were &quot;harnessed in earnest in the rise of Serbian nationalism during the 19th century&quot; and acquired new meanings in the context of the Greater Serbia nationalist project. Many of the elements which came to be seen later in Serbian discourse as crucial elements of Serbian tradition appear to have entered the Serbian corpus about Kosovo just a few decades before 19th century Serbian folklorists recorded them. Throughout most of the 19th century it did not carry its later importance, as the Principality of Serbia saw the region of Bosnia as its core, not Kosovo. The Congress of Berlin (1878) was the event which caused the elevation of the narratives about the Battle of Kosovo (&quot;Kosovo myth&quot;) in its modern status. The region of Bosnia was effectively handed out to Austria-Hungary and Serbian expansion towards that area was blocked, which in turn left southwards expansion towards Kosovo as the only available geopolitical alternative for the Serbian state. Today, the Battle of Kosovo has come to be seen in public discourse as &quot;particularly important to Serbian history, tradition and national identity&quot;. The battle has become a force of historical, political, military and artistic inspiration to date.

The day of the battle, known in Serbian as &quot;Vidovdan&quot; (St. Vitus&#x27; day) and celebrated according to the Julian calendar (corresponding to 28 June Gregorian in the 20th and 21st centuries), is an important part of Serb ethnic and national identity, with notable events in Serbian history falling on that day: in 1876 Serbia declared war on the Ottoman Empire (Serbian–Ottoman War (1876–78); in 1881 Austria-Hungary and the Principality of Serbia signed a secret alliance; in 1914 the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was carried out by the Serbian Gavrilo Princip (although a coincidence that his visit fell on that day, &quot;Vidovdan&quot; added nationalist symbolism to the event); in 1921 King Alexander I of Yugoslavia proclaimed the Vidovdan Constitution; in 1989, on the 600th anniversary of the battle, Serbian president Slobodan Milošević delivered the Gazimestan speech on the site of the historic battle.

Epic songs about the battle also exist in Albanian historical folkore and have been preserved in locals Kosovo Albanian culture. Albanian versions, part of Albanian epic poetry from Kosovo focus on the figure of Miloš Obilić (Millosh Kopiliqi in Albanian) as his birthplace is considered to have been in the Drenica region of Kosovo, where villages which bear the name &quot;Kopiliq&quot; are located.

<doc id="159362" wikidata="Q316064" url="?curid=159362" title="John F. Kennedy Jr.">
<text>John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr. (November 25, 1960 – July 16, 1999), often referred to as John-John or JFK Jr., was an American socialite, attorney, magazine publisher, and journalist. He was a son of 35th United States president John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy. 

Born two weeks after his father was elected president, Kennedy spent his early childhood years living in the White House until his father was assassinated. At the funeral procession, which took place on his third birthday, Kennedy gave his father&#x27;s flag-draped casket a final salute as it came past him. 

As an adult, Kennedy worked for nearly four years as an assistant district attorney in New York City. In 1995, he launched the magazine &quot;George&quot;, using his political and celebrity status to promote it. Kennedy was a popular social figure in Manhattan and the subject of intense media attention throughout his life, and his death in a plane crash in 1999 at age 38 was highly publicized.

==Early life==

John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr. was born at Georgetown University Hospital on November 25, 1960. His father, Massachusetts senator John F. Kennedy, had been elected president less than three weeks earlier and was inaugurated two months after his son&#x27;s birth. Kennedy had an older sister, Caroline, who was born three years earlier. His parents had a stillborn daughter, Arabella, in 1956 and later had an infant son, Patrick, who died two days after his premature birth in 1963. His putative nickname, &quot;John-John&quot;, came from a reporter who misheard his father calling him &quot;John&quot; twice in quick succession; the name was not used by his family.
Kennedy lived in the White House during the first three years of his life and remained in the public spotlight as a young adult. His father was assassinated on November 22, 1963 and the state funeral was held three days later, on Kennedy&#x27;s third birthday. In a famous moment, Kennedy stepped forward and rendered a final salute as his father&#x27;s flag-draped casket was carried out from St. Matthew&#x27;s Cathedral. The photo was called &quot;the most impressive...shot in the history of television&quot; by NBC News vice president Julian Goodman. Several photographers captured the moment, including United Press International photographer Stan Stearns (who became chief White House photographer during the Lyndon B. Johnson administration) and Dan Farrell for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;. Lyndon B. Johnson wrote his first letter as president to Kennedy and told him that he &quot;can always be proud&quot; of his father.

Following the assassination, the family continued with their plans for a birthday party to demonstrate that they would go on despite the death of the president. They moved to the Georgetown area of Washington, D.C. for a short time, and then to a luxury apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City, where Kennedy grew up. In 1967, his mother took him and Caroline on a six-week &quot;sentimental journey&quot; to Ireland, where they met President Éamon de Valera and visited the Kennedy ancestral home in Dunganstown.

After Kennedy&#x27;s uncle Robert was assassinated in 1968, Jackie took Caroline and Kennedy out of the United States, saying: &quot;If they&#x27;re killing Kennedys, then my children are targets ... I want to get out of this country.&quot; She married Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis that year, and the family moved to his private island of Skorpios. Kennedy is said to have considered his stepfather &quot;a joke&quot;. Onassis died in 1975 and left his widow $250,000 a year, although she later settled with Christina Onassis for $25 million in exchange for not contesting the will.

Kennedy returned to the White House with his mother and sister in 1971 for the first time since his father&#x27;s assassination. President Richard Nixon&#x27;s two daughters gave Kennedy a tour that included his old bedroom and Nixon showed him the &quot;Resolute&quot; desk under which his father had let Kennedy play.

===Education===
Kennedy attended private schools in Manhattan, starting at Saint David&#x27;s School and moving to Collegiate School, which he attended from third through tenth grade. Kennedy completed his education at Phillips Academy, a preparatory boarding school in Andover, Massachusetts. After graduating, he accompanied his mother on a trip to Africa. Kennedy&#x27;s group got lost for two days without food or water while on a pioneering course and he rescued them, winning points for leadership.

In 1976, Kennedy and his cousin visited an earthquake disaster zone at Rabinal in Guatemala, helping with heavy building work and distributing food. The local priest said that they &quot;ate what the people of Rabinal ate and dressed in Guatemalan clothes and slept in tents like most of the earthquake victims,&quot; adding that the two &quot;did more for their country&#x27;s image&quot; in Guatemala &quot;than a roomful of ambassadors.&quot; On his 16th birthday, Kennedy&#x27;s Secret Service protection ended and he spent the summer of 1978 working as a wrangler in Wyoming. In 1979, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston was dedicated and Kennedy made his first major speech, reciting Stephen Spender&#x27;s poem &quot;I Think Continually of Those Who Were Truly Great.&quot;

Kennedy attended Brown University, where he majored in American studies. Kennedy co-founded a student discussion group that focused on contemporary issues such as apartheid in South Africa, gun control, and civil rights. He was appalled by apartheid when visiting South Africa on a summer break and arranged for U.N. ambassador Andrew Young to speak about the topic at Brown. By his junior year at Brown, Kennedy had moved off campus to live with several other students in a shared house and spent time at Xenon, a club owned by Howard Stein. Kennedy was initiated into Phi Psi, a local social fraternity that had been the Rhode Island Alpha chapter of national Phi Kappa Psi fraternity until 1978.

In January 1983, Kennedy&#x27;s Massachusetts driver&#x27;s license was suspended when he received more than three speeding summonses in 12 months and failed to appear at a hearing. The family&#x27;s lawyer explained that Kennedy most likely &quot;became immersed in exams and just forgot the date of the hearing.&quot; That same year, he graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in American studies and took a break, traveling to India and spending some time at the University of Delhi, where Kennedy did his post-graduate work and met Mother Teresa.

==Career==
After the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, Kennedy returned to New York to earn $20,000 a year at the Office of Business Development, where his boss said that he worked &quot;in the same crummy cubbyhole as everybody else. I heaped on the work and was always pleased.&quot; Kennedy continued there as deputy director of the 42nd Street Development Corporation in 1986, conducting negotiations with developers and city agencies. 

In 1988, Kennedy became a summer associate at Manatt, Phelps, Rothenberg &amp; Phillips, a Los Angeles law firm with strong connections to the Democratic Party, working for his uncle Ted Kennedy&#x27;s law school roommate and former Democratic National Committee chairman Charles Manatt. Later that year, Kennedy was named by &quot;People&quot; Magazine as 1988&#x27;s “Sexiest Man Alive”.

From 1989, Kennedy headed Reaching Up, a nonprofit group which provided educational and other opportunities for workers who helped people with disabilities. William Ebenstein, executive director of Reaching Up, said, &quot;He was always concerned with the working poor, and his family always had an interest in helping them.&quot;

Kennedy earned a Juris Doctor degree from the New York University School of Law in 1989. He then failed the New York bar exam twice before passing on his third try in July 1990. After failing the exam for a second time, Kennedy vowed that he would continue to take it until he was 95 years old or passed. If Kennedy had failed a third time, he would have been ineligible to serve as an assistant district attorney in the Manhattan DA&#x27;s Office, where Kennedy worked for the next four years; handling such matters as consumer fraud and landlord-tenant disputes. On August 29, 1991, Kennedy won his first case as a prosecutor.

In the summer of 1992, Kennedy worked as a journalist and was commissioned by &quot;The New York Times&quot; to write an article about his kayaking expedition to the Åland Archipelago, where he saved one of his friends when a kayak capsized. Kennedy then considered creating a magazine with his friend, public-relations magnate Michael J. Berman, a plan which his mother thought too risky. In his 2000 book &quot;The Day John Died&quot;, Christopher Andersen wrote that Jacqueline had worried that her son would die in a plane crash and asked her longtime companion Maurice Tempelsman &quot;to do whatever it took to keep John from becoming a pilot&quot;.

===Acting===
Kennedy had appeared in many plays while at Brown and had done a bit of acting afterwards. He expressed interest in acting as a career but his mother strongly disapproved, considering it an unsuitable profession. Kennedy made his New York acting debut on August 4, 1985 in front of an invitation-only audience at the Irish Theater on Manhattan&#x27;s West Side. The executive director of the Irish Arts Center, Nye Heron, said that Kennedy was &quot;one of the best young actors I&#x27;ve seen in years&quot;. Kennedy&#x27;s director, Robin Saex, stated, &quot;He has an earnestness that just shines through.&quot; Kennedy&#x27;s largest acting role was playing a fictionalized version of himself in the eighth-season episode of the sitcom &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; called &quot;Altered States&quot;, in which he visits Brown&#x27;s office to promote a magazine he is publishing.

===&quot;George&quot; magazine===
In 1995, Kennedy and Michael Berman founded &quot;George&quot;, a glossy, politics-as-lifestyle and fashion monthly, with Kennedy controlling 50 percent of the shares. Kennedy officially launched the magazine at a news conference in Manhattan on September 8 and joked that he had not seen so many reporters in one place since he failed his first bar exam.

Each issue of the magazine contained an editor&#x27;s column and interviews written by Kennedy, who believed they could make politics &quot;accessible by covering it in an entertaining and compelling way&quot;, allowing &quot;popular interest and involvement&quot; to follow. Kennedy did interviews with Louis Farrakhan, Billy Graham, Garth Brooks, and others.

The first issue was criticized for its image of Cindy Crawford posing as George Washington in a powdered wig and ruffled shirt. In defense of the cover Kennedy stated that &quot;political magazines should look like &quot;Mirabella&quot;.&quot;

In July 1997, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; published a profile of New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, claiming that he was sleeping with his press secretary (which both parties denied). Kennedy was tempted to follow up on this story but decided against it. That same month, he wrote about meeting Mother Teresa, declaring that the &quot;three days I spent in her presence was the strongest evidence this struggling Catholic has ever had that God exists.&quot;
The September 1997 issue of &quot;George&quot; centered on temptation and featured two of Kennedy&#x27;s cousins, Michael LeMoyne Kennedy and Joseph P. Kennedy II. Michael, a Boston attorney, had been accused of having an affair with his children&#x27;s underage babysitter, while Joseph, a Massachusetts congressman, had been accused by his ex-wife of having bullied her. John said that both his cousins had become &quot;poster boys for bad behavior&quot;, and that he was trying to show that press coverage of the pair was unfair because they were Kennedys. Joseph paraphrased John&#x27;s father by stating, &quot;Ask not what you can do for your cousin, but what you can do for his magazine.&quot;

====Decline====
By early 1997, Kennedy and Berman were locked in a power struggle, which led to screaming matches, slammed doors, and even a physical altercation. Berman sold his share of the company and Kennedy took on Berman&#x27;s responsibilities. Berman&#x27;s departure was followed by a rapid drop in sales for the already declining magazine.

Hachette Filipacchi Magazines were partners in &quot;George&quot;. CEO David Pecker said the decline was due to Kennedy&#x27;s refusal to &quot;take risks as an editor, despite the fact that he was an extraordinary risk taker in other areas of his life.&quot; Pecker also said, &quot;He understood that the target audience for &quot;George&quot; was the eighteen-to-thirty-four-year-old demographic, yet he would routinely turn down interviews that would appeal to this age group, like Princess Diana or John Gotti Jr., to interview subjects like Dan Rostenkowski or Võ Nguyên Giáp.&quot;
Shortly before his death, Kennedy had been planning a series of online chats with the 2000 presidential candidates. Microsoft was to provide the technology and pay for it while receiving advertising in &quot;George&quot;. After his death, the magazine was bought out by Hachette, but it folded in early 2001.

== Later life ==

===Family activity===
Kennedy addressed the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta, introducing his uncle Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. He invoked his father&#x27;s inaugural address, calling &quot;a generation to public service&quot;, and received a two-minute standing ovation. Republican consultant Richard Viguerie said he did not remember a word of the speech, but remembered &quot;a good delivery&quot; and added, &quot;I think it was a plus for the Democrats and the boy. He is strikingly handsome.&quot;

Kennedy participated in his cousin Patrick J. Kennedy&#x27;s campaign for a seat in the Rhode Island House of Representatives by visiting the district. He sat outside the polling booth and had his picture taken with &quot;would-be&quot; voters. The polaroid ploy worked so well in the campaign that Patrick J. Kennedy used it again in 1994.

Kennedy also campaigned in Boston for his uncle&#x27;s re-election to the U.S. Senate against challenger Mitt Romney in 1994. &quot;He always created a stir when he arrived in Massachusetts,&quot; remarked Senator Kennedy.

===Relationships===
While attending Brown University Kennedy met Sally Munro. They dated for six years, and visited India together in 1983. While at Brown, he also met model and actress Brooke Shields, with whom Kennedy was later linked.

Kennedy dated models Cindy Crawford and Julie Baker and actor Sarah Jessica Parker, who said that she enjoyed dating Kennedy but realized he &quot;was a public domain kind of a guy.&quot; Parker claimed to have no idea what &quot;real fame&quot; was until dating Kennedy and felt that she should &quot;apologize for dating him&quot; since it became the &quot;defining factor in the person&quot; she was.

Kennedy had known actress Daryl Hannah since their two families had vacationed together in Saint Martin in the early 1980s. After meeting again at the wedding of his aunt Lee Radziwill in 1988, they dated for five and a half years, though their relationship was complicated by her feelings for singer Jackson Browne, with whom she had lived for a time.

From 1985 to 1990, Kennedy dated Christina Haag. They had known each other as children, and she also attended Brown University.

===Marriage===
After his relationship with Daryl Hannah ended, Kennedy lived with Carolyn Bessette, who worked in the fashion industry. They were engaged for a year, though Kennedy consistently denied reports of this. On September 21, 1996, they were married in a private ceremony on Cumberland Island, Georgia, where his sister, Caroline, was matron of honor and his cousin Anthony Radziwill was best man. His nieces Rose Kennedy Schlossberg and Tatiana Kennedy Schlossberg served as the flower girls, and nephew Jack Kennedy Schlossberg served as the ring bearer.

The next day, Kennedy&#x27;s cousin Patrick revealed that the pair had married. When they returned to their Manhattan home a mass of reporters was on the doorstep. One of them asked Kennedy if he had enjoyed his honeymoon, to which he responded: &quot;Very much.&quot; Kennedy added, &quot;Getting married is a big adjustment for us, and for a private citizen like Carolyn even more so. I ask you to give her all the privacy and room you can.&quot;

Bessette was disoriented by the constant attention of the paparazzi. The couple were permanently on show, both at fashionable Manhattan events and on their travels to visit celebrities such as Mariuccia Mandelli and Gianni Versace. She complained to her friend, journalist Jonathan Soroff, that she could not get a job without being accused of exploiting her fame. The couple began seeing a marriage counselor in March 1999 and sought counseling from Cardinal John O&#x27;Connor in the summer of 1999.

== Death ==

Kennedy wanted to become a pilot since he was a child. Kennedy took flying lessons at the Flight Safety Academy in Vero Beach, Florida and received his pilot&#x27;s license in April 1998. The death of his cousin Michael in a skiing accident had prompted John to take a hiatus from his piloting lessons for three months. Kennedy&#x27;s sister, Caroline, hoped this would be permanent but when he resumed, she did little to stop Kennedy.

On July 16, 1999, Kennedy departed from Fairfield, New Jersey at the controls of his Piper Saratoga light aircraft. He was traveling with his wife Carolyn and sister-in-law Lauren Bessette. Lauren was to be dropped off at Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and Kennedy and his wife would continue on to Hyannis Port, Massachusetts to attend the wedding of his cousin Rory Kennedy. He had purchased the plane from Air Bound Aviation on April 28. Carolyn and Lauren were passengers sitting in the second row of seats. Kennedy had checked in with the control tower at the Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Airport but the plane was reported missing after it failed to arrive on schedule.

Officials were not hopeful about finding survivors after aircraft debris and a black suitcase belonging to Bessette were recovered from the Atlantic Ocean. President Bill Clinton gave his support to the Kennedy family during the search for the three missing passengers.

On July 18, a Coast Guard admiral declared an end to the rescue efforts. Within the next two days, the fragments of Kennedy&#x27;s plane were found by NOAA vessel &quot;Rude&quot; using side-scan sonar, subsequently prompting Navy divers to descend into the water. They found part of the shattered plane strewn over a broad area of seabed below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. The search ended in the late afternoon of July 21 when high-resolution images of the ocean bottom helped Navy divers recover the three bodies from the ocean floor. The bodies were taken by motorcade to the county medical examiner&#x27;s office. Divers found Carolyn&#x27;s and Lauren&#x27;s bodies near the twisted and broken fuselage while Kennedy&#x27;s body was still strapped into the pilot&#x27;s seat. Admiral Richard M. Larrabee of the Coast Guard said that all three bodies were &quot;near and under&quot; the fuselage, still strapped in.

The National Transportation Safety Board determined that pilot error was the probable cause of the crash: &quot;Kennedy&#x27;s failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at night, which was a result of spatial disorientation.&quot;

Later that evening, the bodies were autopsied at the county medical examiner&#x27;s office and taken from Hyannis to Duxbury, Massachusetts, where they were cremated in the Mayflower Cemetery crematorium. The families announced their plans for memorial services the same day. The autopsy determined that the crash victims had died upon impact. Ted Kennedy favored a public service for John, while Caroline Kennedy insisted on family privacy. On the morning of July 22, their ashes were scattered at sea from the Navy destroyer off the coast of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard.

A memorial service was held for Kennedy on July 23, 1999, at the Church of St. Thomas More in New York City, a parish that Kennedy had often attended with his mother and sister. The invitation-only service was attended by hundreds of mourners, including President Bill Clinton, who presented the family with photo albums of John and Carolyn on their visit to the White House from the previous year.

=== Will ===
Kennedy&#x27;s last will and testament stipulated that his personal belongings, property, and holdings were to be &quot;evenly distributed&quot; among his sister Caroline’s three children – Rose, Tatiana, and Jack – who were among 14 beneficiaries in his will. A scrimshaw set that belonged to his father, President Kennedy, was left to his nephew Jack.

==Legacy==

In 2000, Reaching Up, the organization which Kennedy founded in 1989, joined with The City University of New York to establish the John F. Kennedy Jr. Institute. In 2003, the ARCO Forum at Harvard Kennedy School was renamed the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum of Public Affairs. Kennedy had been a member of the Senior Advisory Committee of Harvard&#x27;s Institute of Politics for 15 years and an active participant in Forum events. Ted Kennedy said the renaming symbolically linked Kennedy with his late father; Caroline Kennedy said the renaming reflected his love of discussing politics.

In 2013, on the 50th anniversary of the 1963 presidential assassination, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; re-ran the famous photograph of the three-year-old Kennedy saluting his father&#x27;s coffin during the funeral procession. Photographer Dan Farrell, who took the photo, called it &quot;the saddest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen in my whole life&quot;.

<text>Vestini () were an Italic tribe who occupied the area of the modern Abruzzo (central Italy), included between the Gran Sasso and the northern bank of the Aterno river. Their main centres were &quot;Pitinum &quot;(near modern L&#x27;Aquila), &quot;Aufinum &quot;(Ofena), &quot;Peltuinum&quot; (Prata d&#x27;Ansidonia), &quot;Pinna &quot;(Penne) and &quot;Aternum &quot;(Pescara, shared with the Marrucini).

==Historical geography==
Writing at about 100 years after the end of the Social War, a failed last attempt of the italic tribes to form a union, Italy, that would compete with Rome in power and influence, the Roman geographer, Strabo, placed the location of the Vestini as he knew it to be as follows. The southern border was the Aternus River (modern Aterno-Pescara). Aternum (modern Pescara), then on the southern bank of the mouth of the river, was on the Marrucinian side. Both the Peligni upstream on the southern bank and the Marrucini downstream shared the port with the Vestini. Strabo has little else to say about the country of the Vestini, except that it was mountainous. Ptolemy has only to add that the towns of the Vestini were Pinna, Avia, Amiternum (a mistake, probably Aufina) and Angulus. Pliny the Elder mentions also Peltuina. He lists the Vestini in Augustus&#x27; Regio IV.

==History==

===The period of Vestinian sovereignty===
A Vestini sculpture, the Warrior of Capestrano, dating from the 6th century BC, was found in Capestrano, province of L&#x27;Aquila; it represents the King of Vestini tribe, Naevius Pompuledius, and was made by the sculptor Aninis.

The tribe entered into the Roman alliance, retaining its own independence, in 302 BC, and issuing coins of its own in the following century. A northerly section round Amiternum near the passes into Sabine country probably received the Caerite franchise soon after. In spite of this, and of the influence of Hadria, modern Atri, a Latin colony founded about 290 BC, the local dialect, which belongs to the north Oscan group, survived certainly to the middle of the 2nd century BC (see the inscriptions cited below) and probably until the Social War.

===Romanization===
The oldest Latin inscriptions of the district are C.I.L. ix. 3521, from Furfo with Sullan alphabet, and 3574, &quot;,&quot; but with couraverunt, a form which, as intermediate between or and , cannot be earlier than 100 BC. The latter inscription contains also the forms (nom. p1.) and (gen. sing.), which show that the Latin first spoken by the Vestini was not that of Rome, but that of their neighbours the Marsi and Aequi. The inscription of Scoppito shows that at the time at which it was written the upper &quot;Aternus&quot; valley must be counted Vestine, not Sabine in point of dialect.

<doc id="159365" wikidata="Q376651" url="?curid=159365" title="Mortiis">
<text>Mortiis is an electronic band from Notodden, Norway fronted by Håvard Ellefsen, who is also known as the namesake of the band. The name is a misspelling of the word &quot;mortis&quot;, which is the pronunciation used by the band. Mortiis started as the solo project of Ellefsen as a means to convey a story. This aspect was lost over time and Mortiis slowly formed into a band. Ellefsen previously played bass in the black metal band Emperor (1991–1992), prior to forming this project in 1993. The time he spent in his previous band laid the groundworks for mixing black metal elements with various electronic genres, with these being touched upon across each &quot;era&quot; of the band.

==History==
===Era I===
The title of &quot;Era I&quot; was never intentional. It came about in 2001 when Mortiis was set to release &quot;The Smell of Rain&quot;, which was such a departure from his earlier records that he wanted to brand it in a way to signify this. All works previous to &quot;The Smell of Rain&quot; were thereafter referred to as &quot;Era I&quot; as a consequence. All of the &quot;Era I&quot; albums were composed entirely on synthesizers, creating a sound that Mortiis described as &quot;dark dungeon music&quot;- a fundamental influence on the later dungeon synth genre. The last album of this era, &quot;The Stargate&quot;, went a step further by introducing a wider range of instruments including acoustic guitars, flutes and dark vocals; mainly provided by Sarah Jezebel Deva.

===Era II===
Songs on &quot;The Smell of Rain&quot; were electropop, and frontman Ellefsen took to lead vocals for the first time. This would be the only release under the title of &quot;Era II&quot;. It was during this era that Ellefsen decided he needed to seek members to perform in a live setting, which later helped change how Mortiis as a band sounded. The first live shows with this new lineup and with Mortiis as frontman &amp; vocalist took place in the United Kingdom in December 2001.

===Era III===

With &quot;Era III&quot; came &quot;The Grudge&quot;, which took an even more drastic turn from previous eras and is said to have made the biggest impression of any of his albums. &quot;The Grudge&quot; took on a heavy industrial rock emphasis, combining grinding guitars and industrial programming. Some of the longtime fans were again not too happy with this turn, but it helped gain Mortiis more new fans. In 2005, the Norwegian Culture Council selected &quot;The Grudge&quot; to be freely available for listening to the public in libraries across the country.

On 16 April 2007 Mortiis released a remix album titled &quot;Some Kind of Heroin&quot;, reworking material from &quot;The Grudge&quot;, via Earache Records. &quot;Some Kind of Heroin&quot; offers diverse remix material including interpretations by a wide range of contemporaries, such as Zombie Girl, Gothminister, Implant, XP8, PIG, the Kovenant, Velvet Acid Christ, Girls Under Glass, David Wallace, Kubrick, Flesh Field, Victor Vortexx, Dope Stars Inc, In the Nursery among others. In late 2009 and early 2010 earlier music has been partly reprogrammed and re-arranged for future live use.

On 10 October 2010 Mortiis released Perfectly Defect as a free internet only download album. Regarding why the album was free, Mortiis stated, &quot;The new model of the music business is important to keep in mind; there&#x27;s a new mentality out there in terms of how people acquire their music now.&quot; During this time and the subsequent tours, the visual appearance and sound was similar to that of Era III, but with a more Industrial appearance closer to Combichrist and without any form of mask which had been a key characteristic of previous eras. Although this is marked as being part of Era III, this could be construed as a movement in Era IV.

===Hiatus (2011–2015)===
Between 2011 and 2015, Mortiis (as a band or a solo musician) never stated that the project was on hiatus, although the last tour ended at P60 in Amstelveen (Netherlands) on 8 July 2011, with no performance, recording or releases since. However, during this time the mailing list, Instagram account and Facebook page was active, hinting at a return at some point.

===Era 0===
The four-year hiatus was broken on 8 June 2015 when a message placed on the band&#x27;s Facebook page suggested a new album was on its way in a new era, Era 0. This was confirmed on 5 October 2015 when the release of the single &quot;Doppelgänger,&quot; off the forthcoming album &quot;The Great Deceiver&quot;. The artwork for &quot;Doppelgänger&quot; included the familiar Mortiis logo, but with the Era 0 subscript, confirming the new Era. The album (&quot;The Great Deceiver&quot;) was originally finished in 2008, and included mixes by Chris Vrenna (of Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson). Additional material was also finished with enough material for another album during 2009. To mark the return, Mortiis announced a series of US tours starting on 7 October 2015 with &quot;The Devils Be Damned Tour&quot;. Despite the Era being 0, this was not a return to the original sound of Era I, but a continuation of that within Era III, again with complete lack of prosthetics or mask, but keeping the gothic/industrial costuming and face paint.

===Return to Era 1===
In January 2020, Mortiis returned to his Era 1 style of music with the album Spirit of Rebellion. The album was a reworking of his 1994 work Ånden som Gjorde Opprør, and was instigated after he was invited to perform at the 25th anniversary celebrations for former label Cold Meat Industry in 2017. In April 2020, he shared a work in progress tentatively entitled &quot;The Shadow of the Tower&quot; during the online dungeon synth festival &#x27;Northeast Dungeon Siege&#x27;. An extract was also shared on Mortiis&#x27; Bandcamp page; again, the style of this new track reflected the style of the artist&#x27;s early output. A previously unreleased 1997 track of the same name was released via the same website in October 2020, with Mortiis explaining that the piece had previously been used as atmospheric background music during his sporadic live shows of the era. A second such sample, entitled &quot;Blood Becomes Water&quot;, was released in July 2020.

Mortiis admitted to having long-held negative feelings about his 1990s output, feeling resentment towards perceived lack of quality in musicianship and production. However, he has since reassessed his detachment towards this material, and now sees renewed worth in the honesty and originality of his early records. In the period leading up to the release of &quot;Spirit of Rebellion&quot;, many of these early releases were reissued, having remained largely out of print for many years. Mortiis&#x27; 2001 book, &quot;Secrets of My Kingdom&quot;, was also reprinted as an expanded edition in 2018. Subtitled &quot;Return to Dimensions Unknown&quot;, the reprint featured new interviews, images and other archive material from the 1990s.

==Image==
For nearly the entirety of the band&#x27;s existence, frontman Ellefsen has altered his facial appearance using several alternatives before using a prosthetic mask and ear set. The studio who made Mortiis&#x27; mask asked for a character reference for the moulding. The mask was always coupled with ears. During &quot;Era I&quot; the mask covered his whole face, though by &quot;Era III&quot; it had an appearance whereby it seemed to be falling off and was stitched in place. The mask was dropped after the release of &quot;Some Kind of Heroin&quot;. Having stated in an interview that the mask has been shelved &quot;for better or worse&quot;, as part of the significance of &quot;Some Kind of Heroin&quot;.

Ellefsen&#x27;s choice of dreadlocks (sometime after Era I), and various outfits helped produce the &quot;Mortiis image&quot;. When asked as to what the mask represents he has answered, &quot;I do not look upon myself as a goblin, or troll, or elf, or medieval. I am merely Mortiis.&quot; Mortiis has been known to repair his live clothes by using black tape to seal holes and tears. They often cover themselves in corn flour before going on stage.

When talking about the influence for the imagery that his band uses, Ellefsen has commented, &quot;A lot of people do not get that you can do more than just look like you&#x27;re waiting for a bus. I mean how dull is that? I grew up with Kiss, W.A.S.P. and Alice Cooper.&quot;

==Remixes==
Mortiis has been credited for a number of remixes, though most are produced solely by Ellefsen. Mortiis’ most notable credited remixes are for artists signed to the Belgian industrial label Alfa Matrix, including Zombie Girl (on the album &quot;Blood, Brains and Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll&quot;) and , another female fronted industrial metal act who released their album &quot;Optics&quot; featuring a bonus disc with remixes by Mortiis and other artists including Combichrist and Clan of Xymox.
Mortiis has also provided remixes for Italian Industrial Rock/Metal bands including Dope Stars Inc., T3CHN0PH0B1A, as well as the American Ethereal/Neoclassical act Melankolia.

==Band members==
===Håvard Ellefsen===
Håvard Ellefsen, often referred to as Mortiis, is the only constant band member. He was born in Skien, Telemark. Mortiis began his musical career playing bass for the black metal act Emperor. He stayed with the band just over one year before going on to create his own solo project, though unlike his previous band the music would be dark ambient oriented. Ellefsen was experimenting greatly with music during his early solo career. He started four separate projects, though the focus was always on Mortiis.

Ellefsen wrapped up work on the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Broken&quot; and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Chair&quot; (Renegade Films) in 2007. Both films were directed by Adam Mason who first worked with him on the Mortiis video for &quot;Decadent &amp; Desperate&quot;. Having completed an album&#x27;s worth of songs, Ellefsen commented at how they were &quot;atmospheric and eerie&quot; and also &quot;very dark&quot; while &quot;some of it actually is semi-song structured, with some melody and sense to it.&quot; They were done under the Mortiis name. The collected music will eventually be released as a Mortiis album.

Mortiis as a band was formed shortly after the release of &quot;The Smell of Rain&quot;.

Dark Dungeon Music was the personal record label of Mortiis. It operated between 1995 and 1999 while Mortiis resided in Halmstad, Sweden, and released mostly limited-edition vinyl. It was dissolved as Mortiis moved back to Norway in late 1999.

<text>The Paeligni or Peligni were an Italic tribe who lived in the Valle Peligna, in what is now Abruzzo, central Italy.

==History==
The Paeligni are first mentioned as a member of a confederacy that included the Marsi, Marrucini, and Vestini, with which the Romans came into conflict in the Second Samnite War, 325 BC. Like other Oscan-Umbrian populations, they were governed by supreme magistrates known as &quot;meddices&quot; (singular &quot;&quot;). Their religion included deities, such as the Dioscuri, Cerfum (a water god), and Anaceta (the Roman Angitia), a goddess associated with snakes.

On the submission of the Samnites, they all came into alliance with Rome in 305–302 BC, the Paelignians having fought hard against even this degree of subjection. Each member of the confederacy entered the alliance with Rome as an independent unit, and in none was there any town or community politically separate from the tribe as a whole. Thus the Vestini issued coins of its own in the 3rd century; each of them appears in the list of the allies in the Social War. How purely Italic in sentiment these communities of the mountain country remained appears from the choice of the mountain fortress of Corfinium as the rebel capital. It was renamed Vitellio, the Oscan form of &quot;Italia&quot;, a name which appears, written in Oscan alphabet, on the coins struck there in 90 BC. The Paeligni were granted Roman citizenship after the Social War, and that was the beginning of the end of their national identity, as they began to adopt Roman culture and language.

==Language==
The known Paeligni inscriptions show that the dialect spoken by these tribes was substantially the same from the northern boundary of the Frentani to some place in the upper Aternus valley not far from Amiternum, and that this dialect closely resembled the Oscan of Lucania and Samnium, though presenting some peculiarities of its own, which warrant, perhaps, the use of the name North Oscan. The clearest of these is the use of postpositions, as in Vestine , &quot;&quot;; , i.e. , &quot;on to what lies before you&quot;. Others are the sibilation of consonantal and the assibilation of to some sound like that of English &quot;j&quot; (denoted by in the local variety of Latin alphabet), as in , &quot;,&quot; i.e. &quot;&quot;; = Lat. ; and the loss of &quot;d&quot; (in pronunciation) in the ablative, as in (i.e. ), where the contrast of the last with the other two forms shows that the was an archaism still occasionally used in writing. The last sentence of the interesting epitaph from which this phrase is taken may be quoted as a specimen of the dialect; the stone was found in Corfinio, the ancient Corfinium, and the very perfect style of the Latin alphabet in which it is written shows that it cannot well be earlier than the last century BC: , The form (2nd plural perfect indicative) is closely parallel to the inflection of the same person in Sanskrit and of quite unique linguistic interest.

The name Paeligni may belong to the NO-class of ethnica (see Marrucini), but the difference that it has no vowel before the suffix suggests that it may rather be parallel with the suffix of Latin . If it has any connection with Latin &quot;paelex&quot;, &quot;concubine&quot;, it is conceivable that it meant “halfbreeds” and was a name coined in contempt by the conquering Sabines, who turned the &quot;&quot; into the community of the Marrucini. But, when unsupported by direct evidence, even the most tempting etymology is an unsafe guide. 

Paelignian and this group of inscriptions generally form the most important link in the chain of the Italic dialects, as without them the transition from Oscan to Umbrian would be completely lost. The unique collection of inscriptions and antiquities of Pentima and the museum at Sulmona were both created by Professor Antonio de Nino, whose devotion to the antiquities of his native district rescued every single Paelignian monument that we possess.

===Fate===
None of the Latin inscriptions of the district need be older than Sulla, but some of them both in language and script show the style of his period (e.g. 3087, 3137); and, on the other hand, as several of the native inscriptions, which are all in the Latin alphabet, show the normal letters of the Ciceronian period,

<text>The Marrucini were an Italic tribe that occupied a small strip of territory around the ancient &quot;Teate&quot; (modern Chieti), on the east coast of Abruzzo, Italy, limited by the Aterno and Foro Rivers. Other Marrucinian centers included &quot;Ceio&quot; (San Valentino in Abruzzo Citeriore), &quot;Iterpromium&quot; (whose ruins are under the Abbey of San Clemente at Casauria), &quot;Civitas Danzica&quot; (Rapino), and the port of &quot;Aternum&quot; (Pescara), shared with the Vestini.

==History==
The tribe is first mentioned in history as a member of a confederacy with which the Romans came into conflict in the second Samnite War, 325 BC, and it entered the Roman Alliance as a separate unit at the end of that war (see further Paeligni).

==Language==

A few inscriptions in the Marrucinian language survive. They indicate that the language was a member of the Sabellian group, probably closely related to Paelignian. Most of the inscriptions are very short, but there is one longer inscription, a bronze tablet inscribed with a text of 35 words. This was found at Rapino, and known as the &quot;Aes Rapinum&quot; (&quot;Bronze of Rapino&quot;). It is dated to about the middle of the 3rd century BC. It was formerly in the Museum of Antiquities in Berlin, but appears to have been lost during the Second World War. The opening of the Aes Rapinum reads &quot;&quot;.

The name of the city or tribe that it gives is &quot;touta marouca&quot;, and it mentions also a citadel with the epithet &quot;tarin cris&quot;. Several of its linguistic features, both in vocabulary and in syntax, are of considerable interest to the student of Latin or Italic grammar (e.g. the use of the subjunctive, without any conjunction, to express purpose, a clause prescribing a sacrifice to Ceres being followed immediately by &quot;pacrsi eituam amatens&quot;).

The form of the name is of interest, as it shows the suffix &quot;-NO-&quot; superimposed on the suffix &quot;-CO-&quot;, a change that probably indicates some conquest of an earlier tribe by the invading &quot;Safins&quot; (or Sabini).

<doc id="159369" wikidata="Q618495" url="?curid=159369" title="Aphrodisias">
<text>Aphrodisias (; ) was a Hellenistic Greek city in the historic Caria cultural region of western Asia Minor, today&#x27;s Anatolia in Turkey. It is located near the modern village of Geyre, about east/inland from the coast of the Aegean Sea, and southeast of İzmir.

Aphrodisias was named after &quot;Aphrodite&quot;, the Greek goddess of love, who had here her unique cult image, the &quot;Aphrodite of Aphrodisias&quot;. According to the Suda, a Byzantine encyclopedic compilation, before the city became known as Aphrodisias () it had three previous Greek names: &quot;Lelégōn Pólis&quot; (Λελέγων πόλις, &quot;City of the Leleges&quot;), &quot;Megálē Pólis&quot; (Μεγάλη Πόλις, &quot;Great City&quot;), and &quot;Ninó&quot;ē (Νινόη).

Sometime before 640, in the Late Antique period when it was within the Byzantine Empire, the city was renamed &quot;Stauropolis&quot; (Σταυρούπολις, &quot;City of the Cross&quot;).

In 2017, it was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage Site list.

==History==

Aphrodisias was the metropolis (provincial capital) of the region and Roman province of Caria.

White and blue-grey Carian marble was extensively quarried from adjacent slopes in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, for building facades and sculptures. Marble sculptures and sculptors from Aphrodisias became famous in the Roman world. Many examples of statuary have been unearthed in Aphrodisias, and some representations of the Aphrodite of Aphrodisias also survive from other parts of the Roman world, as far afield as Pax Julia in Lusitania.

The city had notable schools for sculpture, as well as philosophy, remaining a centre of paganism until the end of the 5th century. It was destroyed by earthquake in the early 7th century, and never recovered its former prosperity, being reduced to a small fortified settlement on the site of the ancient theatre. Around the same time, it was also renamed to &quot;Stauropolis&quot; (, &quot;city of the Cross&quot;) to remove pagan connotations, but already by the 8th century it was known as &quot;Caria&quot; after the region, which later gave rise to its modern Turkish name, Geyre. In Byzantine times, the city was the seat of a fiscal administrative unit (&quot;dioikesis&quot;).

Aphrodisias was sacked again by the rebel Theodore Mankaphas in 1188, and then by the Seljuk Turks in 1197. It finally fell under Turkish control towards the end of the 13th century.

===Geological history===
The site is in an earthquake zone and has suffered a great deal of damage at various times, especially in severe tremors of the 4th and 7th centuries. An added complication was that one of the 4th century earthquakes altered the water table, making parts of the town prone to flooding. Evidence can be seen of emergency plumbing installed to combat this problem.

The city of Aphrodisias never fully recovered from the 7th century earthquake, and fell into disrepair. Part of the town was covered by the modern village of Geyre; some of the cottages were removed in the 20th century to reveal the older city. A new Geyre has been built a short distance away.

===Ecclesiastical history===

Le Quien (&quot;Oriens christianus&quot;, I, 899–904) mentions twenty bishops of this see. In the 7th century Stauropolis had twenty-eight suffragan bishops and twenty-six at the beginning of the 10th century.

Stauropolis is also a Roman Catholic titular metropolitan see, under the name &quot;Stauropoli&quot; (Latin: &quot;Archidioecesis Stauropolitana&quot;).

==Buildings and structures==
===Monumental gateway===

A monumental gateway, or tetrapylon, stands at the end of a road that leads from the main north–south street of the town into a large forecourt in front of the Sanctuary of Aphrodite Aphrodisias. The gateway was built ca. AD 200.

===Temple of Aphrodite===
The Temple of Aphrodite was a focal point of the town. The Aphrodisian sculptors became renowned and benefited from a plentiful supply of marble close at hand. The school of sculpture was very productive; much of their work can be seen around the site and in the Aphrodisias Museum. Many full-length statues were discovered in the region of the agora, and trial and unfinished pieces pointing to a true school are in evidence. Sarcophagi were recovered in various locations, most frequently decorated with designs consisting of festoons and columns. Pilasters have been found showing what are described as &quot;peopled scrolls&quot; with figures of people, birds and animals entwined in acanthus leaves.

The character of the temple building was altered when it became a Christian basilica. The building is believed to have been dismantled in c. 481–484 by order of Emperor Zeno, because the temple had been the focus of Pagan Hellenic opposition against Zeno in Aphrodisias, in support of Illus, who had promised to restore Hellenic rites, which had been suppressed during the Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire, to the temples that were still standing.

===Bouleuterion===

The Bouleuterion (council house), or Odeon, is centered on the north side of the North Agora. As it stands today, it consists of a semicircular auditorium fronted by a shallow stage structure about 46 m wide. The lower part of the auditorium survives intact, with nine rows of marble seats divided into five wedges by radial stairways. The seating of the upper part, amounting to an additional twelve rows, has collapsed together with its supporting vaults. The plan is an extremely open one, with numerous entrances at ground level and several stairways giving access to the upper rows of seats. A system of massive parallel buttresses shows that the building was originally vaulted. The auditorium would have been lighted by a series of tall, arched windows in the curved outer wall. Seating capacity is estimated at 1,750.

The available evidence indicates a construction date in the Antonine or early Severan period (late 2nd or early 3rd century AD). The &quot;scaenae frons&quot; (stage front) was certainly put up at this time, as the style of both sculpture and architectural ornament suggest. Statue bases terminating the retaining walls of the auditorium bore the names of two brothers, senators in the early Severan period, and two inscribed bases placed symmetrically against the exterior facade held statues of Aphrodisian benefactors, Claudia Antonia Tatiana and her uncle Lucius Antonius Dometinus, who were active at the end of the 2nd century. Tatiana is known to have had close ties with Ephesus, and it is possible that the striking similarities between this building and the bouleuterion on the civic agora there, dated by inscription to the mid-2nd century, are due to some initiative on her part. We do not know what stood here before the 2nd century AD, but it is likely that the present building replaced a smaller one contemporary with the laying out of the agora in the late 1st century BC.

The bouleuterion at Aphrodisias remained in this form until the early 5th century, when a municipal official had it adapted as a &quot;palaestra&quot;, recording his achievement in an inscription on the upper molding of the &quot;pulpitum&quot; (stage). &quot;Palaestra&quot; usually refers to a wrestling ground, but in the 5th century it could be used to describe a hall for lectures, performances, and various kinds of competitive displays, as suggested by a number of factional inscriptions carved on the seats. Numerous additional cuttings in the surviving seats, probably for poles supporting awnings, suggest that by this time the building had lost its roof. The orchestra was lowered and provided with a marble pavement, reused, perhaps, from the earlier phase.

===Sebasteion===

The Sebasteion, or Augusteum, was jointly dedicated, according to a 1st-century inscription on its propylon, &quot;To Aphrodite, the Divine Augusti and the People&quot;. A relief found in the ruins of the south portico represented a personification of the &quot;polis&quot; making sacrifice to the cult image of Aphrodite of Aphrodisias, venerated as &quot;promētōr&quot; (&quot;foremother&quot; or &quot;ancestral mother&quot;). &quot;Aphrodite represents the cosmic force that integrates imperial power with the power of local elites&quot;, a reader of Chariton romance has noted. This connection between the goddess and the imperial house was also a particularly politic one at the time, as the Gens Julia – the family of Julius Caesar, Octavian Augustus, and their immediate successors – claimed divine descent from Venus/Aphrodite.

===Stadium===
The stadium was used for athletic events until the theatre was badly damaged by a 7th-century earthquake, requiring part of the stadium to be converted for events previously staged in the theatre.

The stadium measures approximately by . With 30 rows of seats on each side, and around each end, it would have had a maximum capacity for around 30,000 spectators. The track measures approximately by .

As the stadium is considerably larger and structurally more extensive than even the Stadium of Delphi, it is probably one of the best preserved structures of its kind in the Mediterranean.

==Other finds==
===Archaeology===

The first formal excavations were undertaken in 1904–5, by a French railroad engineer, Paul Augustin Gaudin. Some of the architectural finds (mostly friezes, pilasters and capitals) he discovered at the site are now in the British Museum.

The most recent, ongoing excavations were begun by Kenan Erim under the aegis of New York University in 1962 and are currently led by Professor R. R. R. Smith (at Oxford University) and Professor Katharine Welch of the NYU Institute of Fine Arts. The findings reveal that the lavish building programme in the city&#x27;s civic center was initiated and largely funded by one Gaius Julius Zoilos, a local who was a slave of Gaius Julius Caesar, set free by Octavian. When Zoilos returned as a freedman to his native city, endowed with prestige and rich rewards for his service, he shrewdly directed it to align with Octavian in his power struggle against Mark Antony. This ensured Octavian&#x27;s lasting favor in the form of financial privileges that allowed the city to prosper.

In September 2014, drones weighing about 0.5 kg were used to 3D map the above-ground ruins of Aphrodisias. The data is being analysed by the Austrian Archaeological Institute in Vienna.

In March 2018, an ancient tomb has been unearthed in an area where illegal excavations were carried out. The tomb was taken to the Aphrodisias Museum.

In 2020, two sarcophagi were found in an olive grove. There was a relief of Medusa on one of the sarcophagi.

===Inscriptions===
The quality of the marble in Aphrodisias has resulted in an unusually large number of inscribed items surviving in the city.
As many pieces of monumental quarried stone were reused in the Late Antique city walls, many inscriptions could and can be easily read without any excavation; the city has therefore been visited and its inscriptions recorded repeatedly in modern times, starting from the early 18th century.

Upwards of 2000 inscriptions have been recorded by excavators under the aegis of New York University. Many of these inscriptions had been re-used in the city walls. Most inscriptions are from the Imperial period, with funerary and honorary texts being particularly well represented, but there are a handful of texts from all periods from the Hellenistic to Byzantine. A set of documents, aimed at portraying the grandeur and history of the city, was included in so-called &quot;Archival Wall&quot;.

Excavations in Aphrodisias have also uncovered an important Jewish inscription whose context is unclear. The inscription, in Greek, lists donations made by numerous individuals, of whom several are classed as &#x27;theosebeis&#x27;, or Godfearers. It seems clear through comparative evidence from the inscriptions in the Sardis synagogue and from the New Testament that such Godfearers were probably interested gentiles who attached themselves to the Jewish community, supporting and perhaps frequenting the synagogue. The geographical spread of the evidence suggests this was a widespread phenomenon in Asia Minor during the Roman period.

===Frieze===
A frieze discovered in 1980 showing a bare breasted and helmeted female warrior labelled writhing in agony under the knee of a Roman soldier with to the left and below the inscription is assumed to depict Britain subjugated by Rome.

==Aphrodite of Aphrodisias==

The cult image that is particular to Aphrodisias, the &quot;Aphrodite of Aphrodisias&quot;, doubtless was once housed in the Temple of Aphrodite. She was a distinctive local goddess who became, by &quot;interpretatio graeca&quot;, identified with the Greek Aphrodite. Her canonical image, typical of Anatolian cult images, shows that she is related to the &quot;Lady of Ephesus&quot;, widely venerated in the Greco-Roman world as Artemis of Ephesus.

The surviving images, from contexts where they must have been more civic than ritual, are without exception from the late phase of the cult, in Hellenistic and Roman times. They are rendered in the naturalistic style common to their culture, which gave the local goddess more universal appeal. Like the Lady of Ephesus, the &quot;Aphrodite&quot; of Aphrodisia wears a thick, form-disguising tunic, encasing her as if in a columnar box, always with four registers of standardized imagery. Her feet are of necessity close together, her forearms stretched forward, to receive and to give. She is adorned with necklaces and wears a mural crown together with a diadem and a wreath of myrtle, draped with a long veil that frames her face and extends to the ground. Beneath her overtunic she wears a floor-length &quot;chiton&quot;.

The bands of decoration on the tunic, rendered in bas-relief, evoke the Goddess&#x27;s cosmic powers: the Charites, the Three Graces that are the closest attendants of Aphrodite; heads of a married pair (the woman is veiled), identified by Lisa Brody as Gaia and Uranos, Earth and the Heavens, over which this goddess reigns, rather than as Zeus and Hera; Helios and Selene separated by a pillar; the marine Aphrodite, riding a sea-goat, and at the base a group of Erotes performing cult rituals.

<text>Rosamund Mary Ellen Pike (born 1979) is an English actress and producer. Known for her portrayals of morally ambiguous women in psychological thrillers and dramas, she is the recipient of numerous accolades, including a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award, as well as nominations for an Academy Award and two BAFTA Awards.

Pike studied at Wadham College, Oxford and appeared in stage productions including &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; at the National Youth Theatre, before beginning her acting career. She had her breakthrough for her film debut as Bond girl Miranda Frost in &quot;Die Another Day&quot; (2002), and had supporting roles in the period dramas &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; (2005), &quot;An Education&quot; (2009) and &quot;Made in Dagenham&quot; (2010).

In the next decade, Pike had mainstream film appearances in &quot;Johnny English Reborn&quot; (2011), &quot;Wrath of the Titans&quot; (2012), &quot;Jack Reacher&quot; (2012) and &quot;The World&#x27;s End&quot; (2013). She received acclaim for her starring role as Amy Dunne in the psychological thriller &quot;Gone Girl&quot; (2014), which earned her nominations for the Golden Globe Award, British Academy Film Award, and Academy Award for Best Actress. Pike then portrayed Ruth Williams Khama in the biopic &quot;A United Kingdom&quot; (2016) and Marie Colvin in the war film &quot;A Private War&quot; (2018), for which she received her second Golden Globe Award nomination. She won her first Golden Globe Award for her leading performance in the dark comedy film &quot;I Care a Lot&quot; (2020), while her supporting role in the black comedy &quot;Saltburn&quot; (2023) earned her additional nominations from the Golden Globe and BAFTA Awards.

On television, Pike won a Primetime Emmy Award for her role in the comedy miniseries &quot;State of the Union&quot; (2019). In 2021, she began starring as Moiraine Damodred in the Amazon Prime Video fantasy series &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;, and in 2024, she was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series as an executive producer of the science fiction series &quot;3 Body Problem&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Pike was born in 1979 in Hammersmith, London, the only child of opera singers Julian Pike and Caroline Friend. She attended Badminton School in Bristol, and while appearing as Juliet in a production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; at the National Youth Theatre, she was noticed by an agent who helped her embark upon a professional career. After being turned down by every stage school to which she applied, she gained a place to read English literature at Wadham College, Oxford. She graduated with an Upper Second-class honours degree in 2001, having taken a year off to pursue her acting career, gaining stage experience in David Hare&#x27;s &quot;Skylight&quot;, Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;All My Sons&quot;, and several plays by William Shakespeare.

== Career ==
=== 1998–2013: Early roles and breakthrough ===
While she was still at Oxford, Pike acted in and directed various plays, including one by Simon Chesterman, who was then a graduate student. She made appearances on British television shows, including &quot;A Rather English Marriage&quot; (1998), &quot;Wives and Daughters&quot; (1999), and the miniseries &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot; (2001). She appeared as Sarah Beaumont in an episode of the series &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot;. After graduating, she was offered a role as a Bond girl and MI6 agent assigned to aid James Bond in &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, and also appeared in the show &quot;Bond Girls Are Forever&quot; and, shortly afterwards, the BAFTA tribute to the &quot;James Bond&quot; film series. She was the first Bond girl to have attended Oxford. Pike then played Elizabeth Malet in &quot;The Libertine&quot; (2004), co-starring Johnny Depp, which won her the British Independent Film Award for Best Supporting Actress. In the same year, she portrayed Rose in &quot;Promised Land&quot;, a film about Israel, and starred as scientist Samantha Grimm in the cinematic adaptation of the computer game series &quot;Doom&quot;.

In 2005, she appeared as Jane, the elder sister of Elizabeth (played by Keira Knightley), in &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot;. Pike then starred in the film adaptation of Anne Michaels&#x27; novel &quot;Fugitive Pieces&quot;. She starred as a successful attorney in the film &quot;Fracture&quot;, opposite Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling. Pike was a judge at the Costa Book Awards in 2008. Her stage credits include &quot;Hitchcock Blonde&quot; by Terry Johnson and Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot;, both in London&#x27;s West End, and &quot;Gas Light&quot; at London&#x27;s Old Vic Theatre. In 2009, she played the title character in &quot;Madame De Sade&quot; during the Donmar&#x27;s West End season.

In 2010, she appeared in the British film &quot;Made in Dagenham&quot; and in the Canadian film &quot;Barney&#x27;s Version&quot; where she plays Miriam. That same year, she starred in a production of &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; on UK tour. Pike recorded voicework for a lead role in the film &quot;Jackboots on Whitehall&quot; (2010) and lent her voice to a series of James Bond audio books, narrating &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;. Also in 2010, Pike voiced the character Pussy Galore in the BBC Radio 4 adaptation of Fleming&#x27;s &quot;Goldfinger&quot;. In 2011, Pike played the character Kate Sumner in the Bond spoof film &quot;Johnny English Reborn&quot;, playing a psychologist and English&#x27;s love interest. The film is a sequel to the 2003 film &quot;Johnny English&quot; and was a box office success, taking over $160 million.

In 2012, she played the role of Queen Andromeda in the fantasy epic &quot;Wrath of the Titans&quot;. She replaced Alexa Davalos, who had played the role in &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; and had dropped out due to a scheduling conflict. Taking the role in &quot;Wrath of the Titans&quot; meant she had to drop out of consideration for a role in &quot;Man of Steel&quot;. Although the film was not well received by critics, it grossed over $300 million and critics considered her performance to be one of the film&#x27;s highlights. She starred as Helen Rodin, the female lead alongside Tom Cruise in the thriller &quot;Jack Reacher&quot;, an adaptation of the novel &quot;One Shot&quot; by Lee Child. The film opened to positive critical reception and grossed over $218 million. The following year she had a supporting role in &quot;The World&#x27;s End&quot; (2013).

=== 2014–present: &quot;Gone Girl&quot; and other roles ===
Pike starred in the David Fincher-directed psychological thriller &quot;Gone Girl&quot; (2014), a film adaptation of Gillian Flynn&#x27;s novel of the same name. Playing opposite Ben Affleck, Pike was cast as Amy Dunne, a woman who goes missing on her fifth wedding anniversary. According to Fincher, Pike was his first choice for the role because he wanted someone who was not widely known, Pike having not appeared in any major leading role prior to the film&#x27;s commencement, and because he found her enigmatic and couldn&#x27;t easily read her. The film was a box office hit, earning over $356 million in global ticket sales. The movie premiered at the 53rd New York Film Festival where the film and Pike&#x27;s performance both earned widespread acclaim from critics.

Richard Lawson of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; wrote that the film is &quot;Smartly shot, detailed ... and performed&quot; and called Pike&#x27;s portrayal &quot;a star-makingly good performance, spellbinding in its operatic mix of tones and temperatures.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said that she &quot;is powerful and commanding ... Physically and emotionally, Pike looks to have immersed herself in this profoundly calculating character, and the results are impressive.&quot; For her performance, she received numerous nominations including the Academy Award for Best Actress, the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actress, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Actress in a Leading Role.

From 2015, she voiced Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward in the remake of &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot; produced by ITV in conjunction with Weta Workshop. In February 2016, she starred in the music video for &quot;Voodoo in My Blood&quot; by Massive Attack, directly inspired by the subway scene with Isabelle Adjani in the movie &quot;Possession&quot; (1981) directed by Andrzej Żuławski. In 2017, she took the role of The Woman in the short film &quot;The Human Voice&quot;, written and directed by Patrick Kennedy and based on the play &quot;La voix humaine&quot; by Jean Cocteau, for which she won Best Actress at the Oxford International Film Festival.

In 2018, Pike was cast as war correspondent Marie Colvin in &quot;A Private War&quot;, directed by Matthew Heineman and based on &quot;Marie Colvin&#x27;s Private War&quot;, a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article by Marie Brenner. She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and Satellite Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. In 2019, she was cast in the role of Moiraine in Amazon Prime Video&#x27;s adaptation of Robert Jordan&#x27;s fantasy epic &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;, which was released in November 2021. Her other films include the thriller &quot;The Informer&quot; and the biopic &quot;Radioactive&quot;; in the latter, she played Marie Curie.

In 2021, Pike starred as con artist Marla Grayson in the crime thriller &quot;I Care a Lot&quot;, directed by J Blakeson and co-starring Peter Dinklage, Eiza González and Dianne Wiest. Her performance received universal acclaim; David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said &quot;Pike brings crisp efficiency and dead-eyed amorality to a legal conservator&quot;, and ABC News journalist Peter Travers wrote that &quot;Pike makes a feast of the role&quot;. At the 78th Golden Globe Awards, she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical.

In 2021, Pike starred in and executive produced the eight episode historical fiction podcast &quot;Edith!&quot;. The scripted podcast dramatises a period during the Woodrow Wilson presidency when Wilson was incapacitated by a stroke and First Lady Edith Wilson took the reins of power while he recovered. Clark Gregg plays the role of President Wilson and Esther Povitsky portrays Trudy Grayson, the First Lady&#x27;s best friend. In 2021, Pike narrated the audiobook of Paula Hawkins&#x27; novel, &quot;A Slow Fire Burning&quot;. She also voiced an audiobook of &quot;The Eye of the World&quot;, the first book in the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series. In July 2022 it was announced that she would also voice audiobook versions of &quot;The Great Hunt&quot; and &quot;The Dragon Reborn&quot;. In 2022, it was announced that Pike would star in Emerald Fennell&#x27;s second feature film, &quot;Saltburn&quot;.

Pike is an executive producer on the Netflix series &quot;3 Body Problem&quot; based on the novel of the same name. In November 2023 Pike began filming on &quot;Hallow Road&quot; by Babak Anvari. In April 2024 it was revealed Pike had joined the cast of &quot;In the Grey&quot; by Guy Ritchie. In May 2024 it was announced Pike had joined the cast of &quot;Now You See Me 3&quot;. In September 2024 it was announced Pike would star as the lead in the Netflix series &quot;Thumblite&quot;, centred on Silicon Valley. In October Pike was cast alongside Sacha Baron Cohen in the Netflix film &quot;Ladies First&quot; by Thea Sharrock. Pike will make her National Theatre debut in summer 2025 in the play &quot;Inter Alia&quot; by Suzie Miller.

==Personal life==
=== Relationships ===
While at Oxford, Pike was in a relationship with Simon Woods which lasted two years. They later played the lovers Jane Bennet and Charles Bingley in &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot;. She then became engaged to the director of that production, Joe Wright; their engagement ended in 2008.

Since December 2009, Pike has been in a relationship with Robie Uniacke, a businessman, and they have two sons, both fluent in Mandarin. They live in Prague. In 2015, when they visited China to promote &quot;Gone Girl&quot;, Pike mentioned that Uniacke had given her a Chinese name (traditional Chinese: , , IPA: ), and, that, being admirers of Chinese culture, they would like the media to use this as her Chinese name rather than using the transliteration of her English name.

=== Activism ===
In 2015, Pike signed an open letter for which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women, as they would serve as the head of the Group of Seven (G7) and the African Union (AU), respectively, which would start to set the priorities for development funding in preparation for a United Nations (UN) summit in September 2015, which was intended to establish new development goals for the next generation.

In 2021, Pike became an investor in, and the creative director for, the psychedelic-inspired meditation app Lumenate, which purports to guide the user into an altered state of consciousness with flashing lights.

Also in 2021, Pike became the first Ambassador for Mines Advisory Group, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning NGO that assists people affected by landmines, unexploded ordnance, and small arms and light weapons.

In a 2023 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Pike expressed a belief that &quot;we&#x27;re all being conned by the wellness industry&quot; and &quot;this idea that it&#x27;s no longer enough to be healthy and we have to be &#x27;well&#x27; is something that needs to be interrogated.&quot; She said &quot;it&#x27;s so seductive because it&#x27;s in pursuit of things that people are ashamed to want&quot; and called it &quot;really dangerous.&quot;

<text>Philistus (; 432 – 356 BC), son of Archomenidas, was a Greek historian from Sicily, Magna Graecia.
==Life==
Philistus was born in Syracuse around the time the Peloponnesian War began. He was a faithful supporter of the elder Dionysius, and commander of the citadel. Cicero, who had a high opinion of his work, called him the miniature Thucydides (&quot;pusillus Thucydides&quot;). He was admitted by the Alexandrian critics into the canon of historiographers, and his work was highly valued by Alexander the Great. His works were continued by the later historian Athanas of Syracuse.

Philistus was quite wealthy. Before his rise to power, Dionysius criticized the generals of Syracuse on their poor performance against the Carthaginians, and was fined by the assembly for his seditious language. Philistus stepped in to pay Dionysius&#x27; fines, with the promise to continue paying them so long as the council saw fit to issue them. It was through Philistus&#x27; support that Dionysius was able to rise to power and control Syracuse.

In 386 BC, without consulting the tyrant, Philistus married the daughter of Dionysius&#x27; brother Leptines. Dionysius feared that Leptines and Philistus would use the marriage as the basis of an alliance against him, and exiled both men from Syracuse. Philistus settled at Thurii but afterwards moved to Adria, where he remained until the death of Dionysius in 367 BC. During his stay at Adria, Philistus occupied himself with the composition of his history of Sicily in eleven books. The first part comprised the history of the island from the earliest times to the capture of Agrigentum by the Carthaginians (406 BC); the second, the history of the elder and the younger Dionysius (down to 363 BC). From this point the work was carried on by Athanas.

Philistus was then recalled by the younger Dionysius, whom he persuaded to dismiss Plato and Dion. When Dion set sail from Zacynthus with the object of liberating Syracuse in 356 BC, Philistus was entrusted by Dionysius II with the command of the fleet. After a lengthy sea battle, his ship was surrounded. Philistus took his own life to avoid retribution from his countrymen.

<doc id="159380" wikidata="Q367298" url="?curid=159380" title="Timaeus (historian)">
<text>Timaeus of Tauromenium (; born 356 or 350 BC; died ) was an ancient Greek historian. He was widely regarded by ancient authors as the most influential historian between the time of Ephorus (4th century BC) and Polybius (2nd century BC). In the words of scholar Lionel I. C. Pearson, Timaeus &quot;maintained his position as the standard authority on the history of the Greek West for nearly five centuries.&quot;

==Biography==
Timaeus was born or in Tauromenium (modern Taormina, in eastern Sicily), to a wealthy and influential Greek family. His father, Andromachus, was a dynast who had refounded Tauromenium in 358 with former inhabitants of Naxos (destroyed by Dionysius I in 403), and ruled there with Timoleon&#x27;s support.

Some time after 316 BC, perhaps in 315 or 312, Timaeus is said to have been banished from Sicily by Agathocles, the tyrant of Syracuse, possibly because of Timaeus&#x27; hostility towards him after the tyrant had captured Tauromenium. Some scholars have suggested that he left Sicily earlier, although most researchers agree that he was forced out in the 310s, rather than leaving voluntarily as a young man.

Timaeus spent at least fifty years in Athens. It is not clear if he ever returned to Sicily. Scholar Christopher A. Baron writes that Timaeus may never have returned to his homeland, even after Agathocles&#x27; death in 289 BC, while Craige B. Champion argues that he may have come back under the reign of Hiero II (ca. 271–216).

While in Athens, Timaeus wrote a history of the Greek West down to 289 BC, and another chronicling the wars of Pyrrhus continuing to 264 BC. Claims that he studied under Philiscus of Miletus, a pupil of Isocrates, remain uncertain and may stem from later attempts to link Timaeus stylistically with Isocrates.

He died shortly after 264 BC, likely around 260 BC. According to Pseudo-Lucian, he reached the age of 96.

==Work==
While in Athens, he completed his great historical work, the &quot;Histories&quot;, which comprised thirty-eight books. This work was divided into unequal sections containing the history of Greece from its earliest days until the first Punic war. The &quot;Histories&quot; treated the history of Italy and Sicily in early times, of Sicily alone, and of Sicily and Greece together. The last five books address the time of Agathocles in detail; the work most likely concluded before the Romans crossed over into Sicily in 264. Timaeus also wrote a monograph on the Greek king Pyrrhus, which almost certainly had the wars against Rome as its centrepiece.

Timaeus devoted much attention to chronology and introduced the system of reckoning by Olympiads. In order to plot chronologies, he employed the years of Archons of Athens, of Ephors of Sparta, and of priestesses of Argos. This system, although not adopted in everyday life, was widely used by the Greek historians afterwards.

Timaeus can claim to be the first to recognize in his work the rising power of the Roman Republic, although it is not clear whether he regarded Rome as a potential friend or foe, and how he understood its significance for the history of the Mediterranean world as a whole. According to scholar Craige B. Champion, &quot;Timaeus may well have been the first writer to see clearly the importance to the western Greeks of the victor of the great Sicilian War, whether it be Rome or Carthage, which he could not have divined.&quot;

Very few parts of the elaborate work of this historian were preserved after Antiquity:
* Some fragments of the 38th book of the &quot;Histories&quot; (the life of Agathocles);
* A reworking of the last part of his Histories, &quot;On Pyrrhus&quot;, treating the life of this king of Epirus until 264 BC;
* History of the cities and kings of Syria (unless the text of the &quot;Suda&quot; is corrupt);
* The chronological sketch (&quot;The victors at Olympia&quot;) perhaps formed an appendix to the larger work.

==Reception==
Timaeus was highly criticized by other historians, especially by Polybius, and indeed his unfairness towards his predecessors, which gained him the nickname of &quot;Epitimaeus&quot; (Επιτίμαιος, &quot;fault-finder&quot;), laid him open to retaliation. While Polybius was well-versed in military matters and a statesman, Timaeus is depicted as a bookworm without military experience or personal knowledge of the places he described. The most serious charge against him was that he willfully distorted the truth when influenced by personal considerations: thus, he was less than fair to Dionysius I of Syracuse and Agathocles, while loud in praise of his favourite Timoleon.

On the other hand, as even Polybius admitted, Timaeus consulted all available authorities and records. His attitude towards the myths, which he claimed to have preserved in their simple form, can be contrasted to the rationalistic interpretation under which it had become the fashion to disguise them. This is probably the origin of his nickname &quot;graosyllektria&quot; (γραοσυλλεκτρία; &quot;Old Ragwoman&quot;, or &quot;collector of old wives&#x27; tales&quot;), an allusion to his fondness for trivial details.

Both Dionysius of Halicarnassus and the Pseudo-Longinus characterized him as a model of &quot;frigidity&quot;, although the latter admitted that he was nevertheless a competent writer. Cicero, who was a diligent reader of Timaeus, expressed a far more favourable opinion, especially commending his copiousness of matter and variety of expression. Timaeus was one of the chief authorities used by Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus, by Diodorus Siculus, and by Plutarch (in his &quot;life of Timoleon&quot;).
