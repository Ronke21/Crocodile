<text>The Legion of Super-Heroes is a superhero team appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by writer Otto Binder and artist Al Plastino, the Legion is a group of superpowered beings living in the 30th and 31st centuries of the , and first appeared in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #247 (April 1958).

Initially, the team was closely associated with the original Superboy character (Superman when he was a teenager), and was portrayed as a group of time travelers. Later, the Legion&#x27;s origin and back story were fleshed out, and the group was given its own monthly comic. Eventually, Superboy was removed from the team altogether and appeared only as an occasional guest star.

The team has undergone two major reboots during its run. The original version was replaced with a new rebooted version following the events of the &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot; storyline in 1994 and another rebooted team was introduced in 2004. A fourth version of the team, nearly identical to the original version, was introduced in 2007. In 2019, DC announced a new series written by Brian Michael Bendis and drawn by Ryan Sook.

==Publication history==
===Original continuity (1958–1994)===
Superboy was the featured series in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; in the 1950s. In &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #247 (April 1958) by writer Otto Binder and artist Al Plastino, Superboy met three teenagers from the 30th century: Lightning Boy, Saturn Girl, and Cosmic Boy, who were members of a &quot;super-hero club&quot; called the Legion of Super-Heroes. Their club had been formed with Superboy as an inspiration, and they had time travelled to recruit Superboy as a member. After a series of tests, Superboy was awarded membership and returned to his own time.

Although intended as a one-off story focusing on Superboy, the Legion proved so popular that it returned for an encore in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #267 (December 1959). In this story, Lightning Boy had been renamed Lightning Lad, and their costumes were close to those they wore throughout the Silver Age of Comic Books. The Legion&#x27;s popularity grew, and they appeared in further stories in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;, &quot;Action Comics&quot;, and other titles edited by Mort Weisinger over the next few years. The ranks of the Legion, only hinted at in those first two stories, was filled with new heroes such as Chameleon Boy, Invisible Kid, Colossal Boy, Star Boy, Brainiac 5, Triplicate Girl, Shrinking Violet, Sun Boy, Bouncing Boy, Phantom Girl, Ultra Boy, and Supergirl.

In &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #300 (September 1962), the Legion received their own regular feature, cover-billed &quot;Superboy in &#x27;Tales of the Legion of Super-Heroes&#x27;&quot;. While they shared space with Superboy solo stories for a couple of years, they eventually displaced Superboy from the title entirely as their popularity grew. Lightning Lad was killed in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #304 (January 1963) and revived in issue #312 (September 1963).

It was the &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; run which established the Legion&#x27;s general workings and environment. A club of teenagers, they operated out of a clubhouse in the shape of an inverted yellow rocket ship which looked as if it had been driven into the ground. The position of Legion leader rotated among the membership. Each Legionnaire had to possess one natural superpower which no other member possessed; despite this, several members had overlapping powers, particularly Superboy, Supergirl, Mon-El, and Ultra Boy. Some issues included comical moments where candidates with bizarre, useless, or dangerous abilities would try out for membership and be rejected; five of these flawed candidates went on to form the Legion of Substitute Heroes. The Legion was based on Earth and protected an organization of humans and aliens called the United Planets alongside the Science Police. The setting for each story was 1000 years from the date of publication.

In &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #346 (July 1966), Jim Shooter, 14 years old at the time, wrote his first Legion story. Soon thereafter, Shooter became the regular writer of the Legion stories, with Curt Swan, and later Win Mortimer, as artist. Shooter wrote the story in which Ferro Lad died—the first &quot;real&quot; death of a Legionnaire (although Lightning Lad had been believed dead for a while before)—and introduced many other enduring concepts, including the Fatal Five, Karate Kid, Princess Projectra, Shadow Lass, the Dark Circle, Mordru, and the &quot;Adult Legion&quot;, a possible future version of the Legion.

The Legion&#x27;s last appearance in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; was #380 (May 1969), and they were displaced by Supergirl in the next issue. The early 1970s saw the Legion relegated to the status of back-up feature. First, the team&#x27;s stories were moved to &quot;Action Comics&quot; for issues #377–392 (June 1969 – September 1970). Following Mort Weisinger&#x27;s retirement from DC, the Legion was passed to the oversight of editor Murray Boltinoff and began appearing occasionally as a backup in &quot;Superboy&quot;, starting with #172 (March 1971), with writers E. Nelson Bridwell and Cary Bates and artist George Tuska. Dave Cockrum began drawing the series with &quot;Superboy&quot; #184 (April 1972), again increasing the team&#x27;s popularity.

====&quot;Superboy&quot; and their own title====

The first comic book published under the title &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; was a four-issue series published in 1973 that reprinted Legion tales from &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;. In the same year, the Legion returned to cover billing on a book when &quot;Superboy&quot; became &quot;Superboy starring the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; with #197 (August 1973). Crafted by Bates and Cockrum, the feature proved popular and saw such events as the wedding of Bouncing Boy and Duo Damsel in &quot;Superboy&quot; #200 (Feb 1974). Issues #202 (June 1974) and #205 (Dec. 1974) of the series were in the 100 Page Super Spectacular format. Cockrum was replaced on art by Mike Grell as of issue #203 (August 1974) which featured the death of Invisible Kid. With #231 (September 1977), the book&#x27;s title officially changed to &quot;Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; and also became a &quot;giant-size&quot; title. At this point, the book was written by longtime fan Paul Levitz and drawn by James Sherman, although Gerry Conway frequently wrote as well. Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad were married in &quot;All-New Collectors&#x27; Edition&quot; #C-55 (1978), a treasury-sized special written by Levitz and drawn by Grell. In #241–245 (July–December 1978) Levitz and Sherman (and then Joe Staton) produced what was at that time the most ambitious Legion storyline: &quot;Earthwar&quot;, a galactic war between the United Planets and the Khunds, with several other villains lurking in the background. During this period, Karate Kid was spun off into his own 20th century-based self-titled series, which lasted 15 issues. Levitz left the book, to be replaced full-time by Gerry Conway.

Superboy departed from the Legion due to a villain&#x27;s plot, and the book was renamed simply &quot;The Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; starting with issue #259 (January 1980). Editor Jack C. Harris hired Steve Ditko as guest artist on several issues, a decision which garnered a mixed reaction from the title&#x27;s readership. Jimmy Janes became the regular artist in a lengthy tale by Conway (and later Roy Thomas) involving Ultra Boy&#x27;s disappearance during a mission, and his long odyssey to rejoin the team. This story told the tale of the Legionnaire Reflecto (only glimpsed during the &quot;Adult Legion&quot; stories in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;), featured villainy by the Time Trapper and Grimbor the Chainsman, and saw Superboy rejoin the team.

====Paul Levitz era====
Paul Levitz returned to write the series with #284. Pat Broderick and Bruce Patterson illustrated the title for a short time before Keith Giffen began on pencils, with Patterson, and then Larry Mahlstedt, on inks. The creative team received increased popularity following &quot;The Great Darkness Saga&quot;, which ran from #287; #290–294; and &quot;Annual&quot; #3, featuring a full assault on the United Planets by Darkseid. Comics historian Les Daniels observed that, &quot;Working with artist Keith Giffen, Levitz completed the transformation of &quot;Legion&quot; into a science-fiction saga of considerable scope and depth.&quot;

The Legion celebrated issue #300 (June 1983) by revisiting the &quot;Adult Legion&quot; storyline through a series of parallel world short stories illustrated by a number of popular Legion artists from previous years. The story served to free up Legion continuity from following the &quot;Adult Legion&quot; edict of previous issues.

Giffen&#x27;s style changed abruptly a few issues later, to a darker and sketchier style inspired by Argentinian artist José Muñoz. A new &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; comic (the third publication under the title) was launched in August 1984. It used a new &quot;deluxe&quot; printing format utilizing Baxter paper instead of the cheaper newsprint that classic comics had always been printed on. The existing Legion series, still on newsprint and renamed &quot;Tales of the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; with issue #314, continued running new material for a year, then began reprinting stories from the new &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; with issue #326. &quot;Tales&quot; continued publishing reprints until its final issue, #354 (December 1987).

The new series was launched in August 1984 with a five-part story featuring the Legion of Super-Villains. Giffen left in the middle of the story and was replaced by Steve Lightle, who stayed on the book for a year. The debut story arc saw the death of Karate Kid in issue #4 (November 1984). Levitz and Lightle co-created two Legionnaires, Tellus and Quislet, whose unusual appearances contrasted with the humanoid appearances of the other Legionnaires. Greg LaRocque began a lengthy run in #16 (November 1985), including a crossover with John Byrne&#x27;s recently rebooted Superman titles, &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot; (vol. 2). The crossover was the first of several attempts by DC editors to explain the origins and fate of Superboy and his history with the Legion, in light of the revisions to the DC Universe caused by &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; that removed Superman&#x27;s career as Superboy from his personal history. In the crossover, the Legion&#x27;s Superboy was revealed to have come from a parallel &quot;pocket universe&quot; created by the Time Trapper. The crossover ended with Superboy&#x27;s death. Levitz&#x27;s run ended with the return of Giffen and a four-part story &quot;The Magic Wars&quot;, concluding in #63 (August 1989).

====&quot;Five Years Later&quot;====

Giffen took over plotting as well as penciling with the &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; volume 4 title which started in November 1989, with scripts by Tom and Mary Bierbaum and assists by Al Gordon. Five years after the Magic Wars, the United Planets is a darker place and the Legion a distant memory. However, a group of former Legionnaires worked to re-form the Legion in this harsh new universe, in which Earth was ruled by the Dominators.

Shortly after this storyline began, the decision was made to retroactively remove Superboy completely from Legion history. Writer Mark Waid stated that &quot;Because of inter-office politics and machinations ... it was decided that there was no Superboy, but we weren&#x27;t even allowed to reference him at &quot;all&quot;.&quot; This left the question of where the Legion&#x27;s inspiration came from without the influence of Superboy. The writers&#x27; solution was a massive retcon, in which Mon-El served in the role of paragon instead of Superboy, with several more retcons to follow. Issue #5 featured an alternate universe story in which the restructuring took place, and the Time Trapper was replaced in continuity by his onetime underling Glorith.

One major storyline during this period was the discovery of Batch SW6, a group of clones of the early Legion (from their &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; days), created by the Dominators. Giffen&#x27;s original conclusion for the storyline was that the clones would have been revealed to be the real Legion, and the ones whose adventures had been chronicled since the 1950s were the clones. The adult Legion&#x27;s secret programming would kick in, forcing them to fight the younger Legion and leading to a fight to the death in which Legionnaires on both teams would die, with the victims&#x27; names being picked at random. Afterwards, the older team would explore the Vega System as a 30th-century version of the Omega Men in a new series while the younger team would act as the main Legion on Earth. Giffen&#x27;s other conclusion was for several of the younger and older Legionnaires to die while liberating Earth from the Dominion. The older Legion would defend Earth while the younger Legion would act as the last line of defense for the United Planets as the Omega Men.

Instead, a parallel title, &quot;Legionnaires,&quot; was launched, starring the &quot;SW6&quot; Legion, whose origins were not resolved until the &quot;Zero Hour&quot; crossover. &quot;Legionnaires&quot; was lighter in tone than the main Legion book, and it was written by the Bierbaums and drawn by Chris Sprouse. Giffen left the book after a storyline which involved the destruction of Earth, and the Bierbaums continued writing, overseeing the return of several classic characters. When the Bierbaums left, writer Tom McCraw took over and made a number of changes, such as forcing several Legion members underground, which required them to take on new identities and costumes, and bringing back long-absent Legionnaire Wildfire.

In 1994, DC rebooted the team&#x27;s continuity. As part of the &quot;Zero Hour&quot; storyline, the Legion&#x27;s original continuity came to an end in September 1994 with &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; (vol. 4) #61. The &quot;Five Years Later&quot; era of the Legion was not subsequently reprinted by DC Comics until the announcement of a hardcover omnibus collection scheduled for release in 2020, almost 26 years after the conclusion initial storyline.

===Rebooted (1994–2004)===

Following &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, a new Legion continuity was created, beginning with a retelling of the origin story starting in &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; (vol. 4) #0 and then continued in the spin-off sister series &quot;Legionnaires&quot; #0 (both released in October 1994). Lightning Lad was renamed Live Wire, and after the group&#x27;s founding, a large number of heroes were added to the roster. Several members from the previous continuity were given new codenames, and some new heroes were added, including XS (the granddaughter of Barry Allen, the second Flash), Kinetix, Gates, and Sensor, a reimagined version of Princess Projectra.

While in some ways following the pattern of the original continuity, the new continuity diverged from the old one in several ways: some characters died as they had previously, others did not, and some Legion members spent time in the 20th century where they recruited Ferro. The Legion also started out having to earn the respect of the United Planets, which they did through two well-earned victories: successfully defending Earth from the White Triangle Daxamites, a group of Nazi-style racial purists; and exposing United Planets President Chu as the mastermind behind the Braal-Titan War, the Sun Eater hoax, the formation of the Fatal Five and the brainwashing of future Legionnaire Jan Arrah.

New writers Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning came on board with penciller Olivier Coipel to produce a dark story leading to the near-collapse of the United Planets and the Legion. In the wake of the disaster, a group of Legionnaires disappeared through a spatial rift and the two existing Legion series came to an end. The miniseries &quot;Legion Lost&quot; (2000–2001) chronicled the difficult journey of these Legionnaires to return home, while the ensuing miniseries &quot;Legion Worlds&quot; (2001) showed what was happening back in the United Planets during their absence.

A new series, &quot;The Legion&quot;, was launched in which the Legion was reunited and given a new base and purpose. Written for its first 33 issues by Abnett and Lanning, the series was cancelled with issue 38. The most notable addition to the team during the title&#x27;s publication was the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; Superboy, a 21st-century clone of Superman and Lex Luthor, who had previously been granted honorary membership.

===&quot;Threeboot&quot; continuity (2004–2009)===
Following a crossover with the Teen Titans in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 3) #16 and the &quot;Teen Titans/Legion Special&quot;, a new &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; series was launched (the so-called &quot;Threeboot&quot; incarnation), written by Mark Waid (who had previously rebooted the title following the events of &quot;Zero Hour&quot;) and penciled by Barry Kitson. This new series recreated the team from the beginning and used the Boy/Lad/Girl/Lass/Kid codenames, which the previous continuities had moved away from using.

Initial issues of this series reintroduced the characters, and provided new and divergent origins for them. Most characters resemble their previous counterparts in costume and powers, with the most notable exceptions including Chameleon Boy, now called simply Chameleon and depicted as an androgynous creature; Star Boy, who in this version of the Legion is black; Colossal Boy, who is now a giant who shrinks to human size; and Phantom Girl, who exists in two universes at once and has conversations with people in her own dimension while talking to Legionnaires at the same time.

The future universe of this Legion is an emotionally and mentally repressive society which involves human sexuality and contact being kept at arms&#x27; length as well as Orwellian surveillance of minors. The Legion&#x27;s main goal is social reform as well as protecting people and inspiring them with the legends of superheroes of old, even though the team isn&#x27;t appreciated by government authorities.

The Legion is worshiped by thousands of young people on different worlds, collectively known as the &quot;Legionnaires&quot;, who follow the group in a cult-like manner. The Legionnaires based on Earth keep a constant vigil outside Legion headquarters.

Beginning with issue #16, &quot;The Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; (vol. 5) was retitled &quot;Supergirl and the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; with Supergirl traveling to the future and joining the Legion. With issue #31, Tony Bedard replaced Waid as writer. The title reverted to &quot;The Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; with issue #37 and Jim Shooter became the writer. The series ended with issue #50, in which the script was credited to &quot;Justin Thyme&quot;, a pseudonym previously used by uncredited comic book artists.

===Post-&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; (2007–2011)===
The &quot;Lightning Saga&quot; crossover in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; (vol. 2) #8–10 and &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; (vol. 3) #5–6 featured the return of the original versions of Star Boy (now called Starman), Dream Girl, Wildfire, Karate Kid, Timber Wolf, Sensor Girl, Dawnstar, and Brainiac 5. Though several differences between the original and &quot;Lightning Saga&quot; Legions exist, Geoff Johns stated that this incarnation of the Legion shares the same history as the original Legion up to the events of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, with Clark Kent having joined the team as the teenage Superboy prior to the start of his career as Superman.

This version of the Legion next appeared in the &quot;Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; storyline in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #858–863. In the year 3008, the Earth&#x27;s sun has turned red and several failed Legion applicants who were born on Earth have banded together to form the Justice League of Earth under the leadership of Earth-Man after he claims that Superman was a human who gained his powers from &quot;Mother Earth&quot;. Earth-Man uses the claim to have Earth secede from the United Planets and ban all aliens from Earth, resulting in several Legionnaires going underground. With the help of Superman, the Legion eventually restores the sun to its normal state, and defeats Earth-Man and the Justice League of Earth just as the United Planets is about to attack the Earth.

This version of the Legion next appeared in the 2008 &quot;Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds&quot; limited series, written by Johns and drawn by George Pérez. The mini-series features the post-&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; Legion and Superman teaming up with the &quot;Reboot&quot; and &quot;Threeboot&quot; incarnations of the Legion to fight Superboy-Prime, the Legion of Super-Villains, and the Time Trapper. It was revealed in the mini-series that the &quot;Reboot&quot; Legion came from Earth-247 (a homage to the Legion&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #247), which was destroyed in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, and the &quot;Threeboot&quot; Legion came from Earth-Prime. Johns stated that the intent of the mini-series was to validate the existence of all three versions of the team while simultaneously restoring the pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Legion&#x27;s continuity. The incorporation of the three teams into mainstream DC continuity was shown in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #864 (June 2008). In the story, Batman recounts the Justice League of America and Justice Society of America&#x27;s battle alongside the original Legion to defeat Mordru, the &quot;Reboot&quot; team&#x27;s assistance in destroying a Sun-Eater in the 20th century, and his own recent encounter with the &quot;Threeboot&quot; team.

This version of the Legion was featured in the second &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; series from September 2009 to October 2011, with the feature focusing on the Legion Academy from April 2011 onwards. This Legion played a part in the &quot;&quot; storyline in 2010, where the ongoing continual events of &quot;The Lightning Saga&quot; concluded in its entirety. A new &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; ongoing series was published from May 2010 to August 2011, written by Paul Levitz and drawn by Yildiray Cinar, featuring the Retroboot version of the team.

===The New 52 (2011–2015)===
&quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; was relaunched in September 2011 with issue #1. Simultaneously, DC Comics cancelled &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; and replaced it with a new volume of &quot;Legion Lost&quot;. While &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; continued the adventures of the team from that title&#x27;s previous volume, &quot;Legion Lost&quot; featured Wildfire, Dawnstar, Timber Wolf, Tyroc, Tellus, Gates and Chameleon Girl. The Legion Lost characters are stranded on 21st century Earth during a mission to save the future, and they are forced to remain there after contracting a pathogen that could destroy the 31st century if they returned. The &quot;Legion Lost&quot; series ended with the time-lost Legionnaires still stranded in the 21st century.

This era of the Legion&#x27;s publication concluded with issue #23 in August 2013, with the title&#x27;s cancellation. In the final issue, the United Planets disbanded the Legion after a cataclysmic battle with the Fatal Five, and the individual Legionnaires retired to their homeworlds or the Science Police. The entire Legion was remobilized to battle Infinitus in the six-issue &quot;Infinitus Saga&quot; in &quot;Justice League United,&quot; written by Jeff Lemire (December 2014 – May 2015). The &quot;Infinitus Saga&quot; featured Brainiac 5 as leader, the return of the &quot;Legion Lost&quot; team to active Legion status and the inclusion of a number of Legionnaires from other continuities in the Legion&#x27;s active ranks.

===&quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; (2019)===

A new &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; series from writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Ryan Sook was announced by DC Comics in June 2019. A prelude two-part series entitled &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes: Millennium&quot; was released in September and October, with the ongoing series debuting in November 2019. The series ended in January 2021 with 12 issues.

==Alternative versions==
Alternative versions of the Legion of Super-Heroes have appeared in various DC comic books.

*The Legion of Super-Heroes appeared in a single panel in the &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; miniseries which takes place on Earth-22 in the DC Multiverse. This version of the team appears again briefly, in the closing pages of a story arc detailing the Earth-22 Superman&#x27;s sojourn with the Justice Society of America in the 21st century (of Earth-0).
*In the DC/Marvel combined &quot;&quot;Amalgam&quot; Universe&quot;, a merged version of the Legion, Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; and characters from Marvel&#x27;s &quot;2099&quot; reality appeared in the title &quot;Spider-Boy Team-Up&quot; #1 as the Legion of Galactic Guardians 2099.
*An alternative version of the Legion appeared in &quot;Legionnaires Annual&quot; #1 (1994). The annual, which was part of the 1994 &quot;Elseworlds Annuals&quot; event, featured a version of the Legion based on King Arthur&#x27;s court.
*&quot;Legion of Super-Heroes Annual&quot; #7, part of the 1996 &quot;Legends of Dead Earth&quot; event, showed Wildfire, as the last survivor of the original Legion, forming a new team.
*The &quot;DC One Million&quot; event, which featured characters based in the 853rd century, featured twenty-six teams called the &quot;Justice Legion&quot;. The Justice Legion L is based on the Legion of Super-Heroes, its members devoted to a version of the United Planets that has made a tour of the universe and is headed back toward Earth to &quot;replenish its diversity&quot;. Among them are Brainiac 417 (a disembodied intelligence from the merged worlds of Colu and Bgztl), Cosmicbot (a metallic being who commands the world of Braal), the M&#x27;onelves (a super-powered collective of miniature beings from the bonded Daxam-Imsk), Titangirl (a living psychic manifestation of the telepaths of Titan), Implicate Girl (loosely inspired by Triplicate Girl, she contains the entire planet Cargg inside her third eye and can access any Carggite&#x27;s skills), as well as an elemental darkness called the Umbra (from Talok VIII) and the Chameleon (a religious fundamentalist from the &quot;Chameleon World,&quot; once known as Durla). The Justice Legion includes secondary members like the Dreamer (the last precognitive of the dead world Naltor, who has a thoughtscreen in her forehead), the &quot;Wildflame&quot; (the comatose remains of the energy being Wildfire) and Cris Kend (the Superboy of the 843rd century summoned by Brainiac 417 to stop an apocalypse). The story of the Justice Legion L is, in turn, related one thousand years later to three youths known as Dav, Vara and Chec who exist in a techno-agrarian society inside a tesseract on Earth; when hospitalized for displaying possible delusions, they are empowered by Wildfire to become the Legion of the 863rd century.
*Legions from several timelines created by the Time Trapper encounter the &quot;Reboot&quot; Legion and fight each other.
*An alternative version of the Legion appeared during the &quot;Absolute Power&quot; arc of the &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; monthly series. Three members of the Legion of Super-Villains, Lightning Lord, Cosmic King, and Saturn Queen, go back in time to change the course of history. They are later joined by Beauty Blaze and Echo. In the alternate timeline, they use members of the Legion of Super-Heroes who were either brainwashed or converted to their cause as a way to protect their time bubble. Most of the members of this army are based on the original Legion from the 1970s. The only three who were not among this army were Cosmic Boy, Lightning Lad, and Saturn Girl.
*The &quot;Elseworlds&quot; two-part limited series &quot;Superboy&#x27;s Legion&quot; featured an alternative version of the Legion that was formed by Superboy. In the story, the infant Kal-El is stranded in an asteroid belt and remains there, in stasis, until found in 2987 by R. J. Brande, a thousand years after Krypton&#x27;s destruction. At the age of 14, &quot;Kal Brande&quot;, also known as Superboy, joins Cosmic Boy and Saturn Girl in forming &quot;Superboy&#x27;s Legion&quot;, later known as the Legion of Super-Heroes.
*In &quot;Static&quot; #14, part of the &quot;Worlds Collide&quot; crossover between DC Comics and Milestone Media, the villain Rift combined Metropolis and Dakota, creating a futuristic amalgamation of the two. The combined city was home to a pastiche of the Legion called the League of Super-Teens. Static, Rocket, and Superboy were transformed into &quot;Static Lad&quot;, &quot;Rocket Gal&quot;, and &quot;Fabulous Boy&quot;. Other unseen members, mentioned by name, were Adhesive Lad, Burnrubber, Dough Boy III, Fabulous Man, Fan Boy, Fat Boy, Foxtrot Lass, Frat Boy, Hoot-Man, Itty-Bitty Girl, Kite Lad, Kodak Kid, Mall Hair Girl, Maniac 5, Phenomenal Lass, Procrastination Lad, Seltzer Lad, Sneeze Lad, Sterno Lad, Super Nazi-Fighter, and Very-Big Boy.

*In the &quot;DC Universe: Legacies&quot; mini-series, a young Clark Kent is approached by the Legion of Super-Heroes to join their team and is given a Legion flight ring. However, Legions from multiple points further in the future arrive asking Kent for help, and a fight breaks over which Legion will receive his help first. Kent rebukes the multiple Legions, returns the ring noting that it means something special to each Legionnaire, and tells them to come back when they can tell him what that special thing is.

==Parodies and homages==
*&quot;Legion of Super-Heroes Annual&quot; #5 (1994) featured the Legion in a parody of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.
*In DC&#x27;s &quot;New Year&#x27;s Evil: Mr. Mxyzptlk&quot; #1 (1998), Mxyzptlk attempts to recruit a parody of the Legion, called the &quot;Logjam of Super-Heroes&quot;, from his comic book collection. Despite its many members, the only ones who were properly identified were Batter-Eater Lad, Butler-Eater Lad, Butter-Eater Lad, Button-Eater Lad, and Mutton-Eater Lad (all take-offs on Matter-Eater Lad), Kid Kid, Kid Lass, Loud Kid, Negative Lass, Lightning Lice, and Beachball Boy.
*In 1977, &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol 1) #107 introduced a team of heroes called the Imperial Guard. Many of their members, designed by former Legion artist Dave Cockrum, were based on Legionnaires: Astra (Phantom Girl), Electron (Cosmic Boy), Fang (Timber Wolf), Hobgoblin (Chameleon Boy), Impulse (Wildfire), Magic (Projectra), Mentor (Brainiac 5), Midget (Shrinking Violet), Nightside (Shadow Lass), Quasar (Star Boy), Smasher (Ultra Boy), Starbolt (Sun Boy), Tempest (Lightning Lad) and Titan (Colossal Boy). The team is led by Gladiator (Mon-El and Superman).
*The satire series &quot;normalman&quot; featured a 33rd-century team called the &quot;Legion of Superfluous Heroes&quot;. In their first appearance, Uranus Girl wants to save normalman, but Lightweight Lad points out they need to do roll call first. The roll call, which includes a seemingly endless list of members, is a recurring gag in the series. When Lightweight Lad loses his place in the roll and is going to start over, he is killed by the other members of the Legion (who also die due to the resulting blast). It is revealed the Legion is in a time loop. 
*The &quot;Legion of the Stupid Heroes&quot; one-shot is a parody of the Legion published by Blackthorne Publishing in 1987.

Its members are Angelfish, Anti-Matter Lad, Brain Boy, Butterfly Queen, Clone Boy, Devil Boy, Dragon Fist, Galactic Lad, Golden Girl, Ghost Girl, Gravity Girl, Jupiter Boy, Kid Warlock, Laughing Boy, Nature Boy, Photon, Snowstar, Tele-Girl, and Ultragirl.
*&quot;SFA Spotlight&quot; #5 (May 1999) published by Shanda Fantasy Arts features a Spider-Ham-style parody of the Legion called the Legion of Super-Furries.
*In &quot;The Innocents&quot;, a story arc that ran in Garth Ennis&#x27; series &quot;The Boys&quot; #40–43, Wee Hughie is sent to monitor the third-rate superhero team Superduper. Billed in-universe as &quot;teenagers from the future,&quot; Superduper includes several superheroes whose powers mimic those of the Legion of Super-Heroes, but who are incompetent: Black Hole (a Matter-Eater Lad analog) chokes on a spoon while trying to eat an entire tub of ice cream; Klanker (Ferro Lad) whose attempts to take on his form of iron usually result in him transforming into inanimate objects; Bobby Ba-Doing (Bouncing Boy) who has the mind of a child and Stool Shadow (Shadow Lass/Phantom Girl), who bumps into walls when trying to phase through them.

<text>The Philosophy of Supplication () is a famous Islamic/Iranian prayer, Written by Ali Shariati. It is written in poetic tense and regards the human life and a human&#x27;s relation with God. The prayer ends with stating:

Note that every verse of this poetic prayer begins with &quot;My Lord.&quot; For example, lines begin, &quot;My Lord, give me the capability to tolerate an opposing point of view.&quot; and &quot;My Lord, give me absolute submission through faith (iman), so that in the world, I may be in absolute rebellion.&quot;

<text>The Bajorans (variously pronounced , , ) are a fictional species in the science-fiction &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. They are a humanoid extraterrestrial species native to the planet Bajor, who have a long-standing enmity with the Cardassians, owing to decades of subjugation under a military dictatorship which saw many of their species enslaved or forced into exile away from their homeworld. They were first introduced in the 1991 episode &quot;Ensign Ro&quot; of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, and subsequently were a pivotal element of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; and also appeared in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;.

The shows&#x27; writers initially depicted the Bajorans as an oppressed people who were often forced to live as refugees, whom they likened to a variety of ethnic groups. Rick Berman, who helped to originally conceive them, compared them to &quot;The Kurds, the Palestinians, the Jews in the 1940s, the boat people from Haiti—unfortunately, the homeless and terrorism are problems in every age.&quot; Ronald D. Moore similarly commented, &quot;depending on the episode, you could also call Bajor Israel, or Iran, or even America and the Cardassians could be Germans, or Russians or several other examples... [but] we don&#x27;t really try to make Bajor a direct analogy to any specific contemporary country or people.&quot;

Various Bajoran characters were included in several of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, including Ro Laren (played by Michelle Forbes) in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; as well as a number of others in &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, which was set on a space station near to Bajor, and which featured Bajoran characters such as Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) and Winn Adami (Louise Fletcher).

==Storyline==

According to the fictional storyline of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, the Bajorans are an ancient species who developed advanced technology before the evolution of humanity on Earth. They eventually developed space-faring ships, which took them as far away as the planet of Cardassia. In 2318 the Cardassian Union, which had been taken over by a military dictatorship, invaded Bajor, occupying it for fifty years, during which time they forced many Bajorans into slave labor, using them in their various mining operations. This forced many Bajorans to flee and live in refugee camps away from Cardassian domination, while other Bajorans became involved in the resistance movement, organising terrorist attacks against Cardassian targets.

The Federation could not intervene in the situation, due to Prime Directive considerations; since Bajor had formally aligned itself with the Cardassians some time before, it was considered an internal matter between the Cardassian Union and a member/subject planet. This caused some resentment towards the Federation by the Bajoran people, especially when the Federation was initially invited to administer Deep Space Nine. This latent anger led to the formation of the Circle, an anti Non Bajorian movement which almost succeeded in capturing Deep Space Nine-until the &quot;Circle&quot; was exposed as being secretly supported by the Cardassians so that a Bajor without Federation Support would be severely weakened.

In 2369, the Cardassian civilian authorities ordered the military to withdraw from Bajor, after which the Bajoran Provisional Government invited the United Federation of Planets to set up base on the former Cardassian mining station of Terok Nor, renaming it Deep Space Nine, and requesting membership into the Federation.

In 2369, when Commander (later Captain) Benjamin Sisko was assigned command of DS9, one of his instructions was to prepare Bajor for full membership into the Federation (pilot episode: &quot;Emissary&quot;). This was a long-running theme during the rest of the series. In 2373, with the Dominion War on the horizon, Bajor asks to be admitted to the Federation under special circumstances. Sisko, acting as Emissary of the Prophets, warned that if Bajor were to join the Federation at that time, it would mean the destruction of that world. With this warning, Bajor decided not to accept membership at that time. At the start of the Dominion War, Bajor officially declared their neutrality (&quot;Call to Arms&quot;), although many Bajorans joined Starfleet and, as well, a new resistance to the occupation of Deep Space Nine was formed.

==Biology==

Like many aliens on &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the Bajorans are human-like in appearance, but have a distinctive symmetrical facial feature: a series of horizontal ridges on the bridge of the nose between the eyes. Despite their human-like appearance, there are several biological differences between the two species. 

During pregnancy, Bajoran women experience uncontrollable sneezing fits in lieu of morning sickness. Bajoran women gestate for five months, as opposed to the nine months of human women, due to high between the fetus and the mother. As a result, any attempt to remove the fetus prematurely, especially during the later stages of pregnancy, would cause massive blood loss to the mother and severe distress to the baby (&quot;Body Parts&quot;). During childbirth, Bajoran women must be completely relaxed. Their body produces endorphins during labor, and thus they commonly feel little or no pain during the process. Typically, labor only lasts an hour, but if it goes on too long, the body stops producing endorphins lest they rise to toxic levels, and the baby will have to be born at a later time (&quot;The Begotten&quot;).

==Culture and traditions==

Bajoran tradition places the family name before the given name. Thus, Kira Nerys is called Major Kira (not Major Nerys); likewise, Ro Laren (Ensign Ro). Bajorans typically consider it an honor when they are addressed correctly by offworlders.

Bajorans&#x27; spiritual lives center around the Orbs—alien objects believed to have been sent by the Prophets (the gods)—each of which has a unique ability such as the Orb of Time, which allows those viewing it to revisit past events. Nine orbs have been discovered over the centuries (plus the Orb of the Emissary, during the final season episode &quot;Shadows and Symbols&quot;); eight were seized by the Cardassians during the Occupation. In the series there are ten orbs although only five are named: the Orb of Prophecy and Change, which was kept on Bajor; the Orbs of Contemplation and of Time, which the Cardassians returned to Bajor; the Orb of Wisdom, which the Ferengi sold to Bajor; and the Orb of the Emissary, which Sisko found. A non-canonical novel names the other five Orbs as the Orbs of Memory, Destiny, Souls, Truth, and Unity.

The Bajoran people were originally divided into castes, called &quot;d&#x27;jarras&quot;, that dictated a person&#x27;s place in Bajoran society; members of a lower-ranking &quot;d&#x27;jarra&quot; were expected to defer to those of a higher caste. When the Occupation began, the &quot;d&#x27;jarra&quot; system was abolished as the resistance movement encouraged all Bajorans to unite, regardless of caste. When the former Bajoran spiritual leader, Akorem Laan, attempted to reintroduce the caste system, it was rejected because it would have made Bajor ineligible for Federation membership (caste-based discrimination is forbidden under Federation law).

Bajorans wear large, chained earrings and ear cuffs called &quot;d&#x27;ja pagh&quot; on their right ears, as symbols of their religious faith. Before the war against Cardassian occupation, the earring also symbolized one&#x27;s &quot;d&#x27;jarra&quot;. Even after the Occupation, there were still different styles of earrings passed down through families, but they had lost their original significance. When Akorem Laan encountered Major Kira, he recognized from the style of her earring that she is a member of the artisan &quot;d&#x27;jarra&quot;, even though she was a member of the military, and she explained that the different styles of earring no longer signified anything. Ro Laren lost her faith because of her experiences while a Cardassian Prisoner; yet, still defiantly Bajoran, she wears her &quot;d&#x27;ja pagh&quot; on her left ear. It&#x27;s later discovered that Ro also used her earring as a covert data storage device which she gave to Jean-Luc Picard shortly before her death.

Bajoran cuisine is not unlike that of many other races. Many Bajorans are fond of hasperat, which is almost identical in taste and texture to that of a large (and often spicy) Earth burrito prepared in a special brine. Jumja sticks are large, dark red, roughly diamond-shaped popsicle-like sweet confectionery treats, though some other races, like Romulans, have commented that they can be a little too sweet. In addition to various ales, Bajorans have been known to make an alcoholic beverage known as spring wine, which very much like other wines, has vintage years, and the quality of the wine can vary from year to year, and bottles from a particularly good vintage year can become sought-after collector&#x27;s items among high-ranking Bajorans. Also, humans serving aboard Deep Space Nine would frequently order Terran seafood dishes with Bajoran Shrimp as a substitute, since replication issues aside, transporting shrimp from Earth would be impractical, given the travel time involved.

==Bajor==
Bajor ( or ) is the homeworld of the Bajorans. Bajor is a Class M planet with five moons. A day on Bajor lasts 26 hours, and Deep Space Nine also follows a 26-hour day. Bajor&#x27;s oceans viewed from space appear more green than blue.

Bajor, the seventh planet in the system, orbits the star Bajor-B&#x27;hava&#x27;el in the Bajoran sector. Other inhabited planets in the Bajoran star system include Andros (Bajor VIII), a Class K planet (similar to Mars) and the fifth moon of Bajor, Jeraddo.

==Religion==

The Bajoran religion, also called The Way of the Prophets, is a major unifying force on the planet. This religion is unusual in that the deities and other phenomena associated with the religion, though treated as supernatural, can also be understood as beings in the material world accessible by scientific observations.

===Prophets===

The Prophets, or &quot;the wormhole aliens&quot; (as they are referred to by most non-Bajorans) exist within the wormhole connecting the Alpha and Gamma Quadrants, the Alpha Quadrant end being located within the Bajoran solar system. This wormhole is referred to as the Celestial Temple by the Bajoran people. The Prophets experience time differently, with their first (known) encounter with corporeal beings (Benjamin Sisko) resulting in a long and confusing conversation as to how linear time works. Their motives remain unclear; on several occasions they proclaim their disinterest in the physical world, though they do repeatedly intervene on behalf of Bajor and its people.

The Prophets are the creators of sacred objects called Orbs or &quot;Tears of the Prophets&quot;. The orbs induce visions (&quot;Orb Experiences&quot;) in people.

===Pagh===

Another aspect of the religion is that of the Pagh (immortal soul). If a person has followed the will of the Prophets, their Pagh is &quot;clean&quot; and they will be permitted to enter the Celestial Temple and dwell with the Prophets. Bajoran spiritual leaders such as Kais and Vedeks can feel the Pagh of another by pinching the lobe of one&#x27;s ear, though many find this scrutiny to be slightly unsettling.

One&#x27;s Pagh can also be stolen by the Pagh Wraiths, members of the race of &quot;wormhole aliens&quot; who have been expelled from the wormhole. The Wraiths, also known as Kosst Amojan (Bajoran for &quot;to be expelled&quot;), work against the Prophets, trying to enforce their own claim that they are the true gods of Bajor.

===Practices===

Religious practices are unclear. The Bajoran religion involves regular services which are intended to teach the &quot;Will of the Prophets&quot;. Meditation and prayer (either in groups or privately) are commonly used, but not strictly observed. There are some orthodox groups within the religion who take a rather dim view of science (more specifically a scientific interpretation of the wormhole) and the beliefs of other species, but this is a small minority, with relatively little support among the people. In the &quot;Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;The Next Phase&quot;, Ro Laren mentions that some traditional Bajoran funeral rites can go on for over three hours. Bajoran women cry out their grief at Funerals—similar to Irish keening.

Prior to the events of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, Bajoran society was socially stratified; by religious edict, a person&#x27;s place in society was determined by their caste (or &quot;d&#x27;jara&quot;) (Kira Nerys would have been an artist if not for the Cardassian occupation). When the Cardassian Empire occupied Bajor, the &quot;d&#x27;jara&quot; system was abandoned so all Bajoran citizens could become soldiers and fight in the Resistance. When Akorem Laan attempted to reinstate the &quot;d&#x27;jara&quot; system in 2372, Bajor&#x27;s application for Federation membership was put in jeopardy, as caste-based discrimination was specifically forbidden by the Federation Charter.

The non-canon Deep Space Nine Relaunch novels reveal the existence of a form of excommunication from the Bajoran faith: when Kira Nerys interferes in a growing civil war, despite being ordered not to do so by the Vedek Assembly, she is declared &quot;attainted&quot; and can no longer attend Bajoran services, set foot in a temple, or study from an Orb or the Bajoran sacred texts.

===Hierarchy===

The hierarchy of the Bajoran faith has never been explained in great detail, though a certain amount is known:

Titles in the Bajoran religion include a &quot;Prylar&quot; (roughly equivalent to a Christian monk), &quot;Ranjen&quot; (a rank falling between Prylars and the next rank, and responsible for a variety of tasks), &quot;Mylar&quot; (priest or minister, mentioned in &quot;Ties of Blood and Water&quot;), &quot;Vedek&quot; (cardinal, bishop) and &quot;Kai&quot; (equivalent to the pope in Catholic theology or Patriarch in the Eastern Orthodox theology). All these ranks are open both to men and to women, and clerics are free to marry and have children.

Vedeks, the second highest level, also make up the Vedek Assembly, the committee which is responsible for the spiritual issues of the Bajoran people. A new Kai is elected by the Vedek Assembly (loosely analogous to how the College of Cardinals elects a new pope) from among those in the Assembly.

The Kai is the spiritual leader. She or he has a great deal of influence on the Bajoran government despite having no official power. After Kai Opaka departed in 2369, the election of a new Kai from the members of the Vedek Assembly led to the election of Kai Winn, who remained Kai until her demise in 2375.

The central figure in the Bajoran faith is known as &quot;the Emissary&quot;, a being believed to be sent by the Prophets to aid Bajor. Benjamin Sisko, a human Starfleet officer, filled this role when he made first contact with the beings believed by the Bajorans to be the Prophets, and the enigmatic beings spoke to him on several other occasions, either to deliver a message or fulfill a task. Although his role was never entirely clear (and Sisko himself was visibly uncomfortable with it for the first few years), the Bajorans respected and admired Sisko as their Emissary, and he carried Bajor through several hardships. In this respect, the Emissary nominally holds even more religious and secular power than the Kai or the First Minister. For example, even the politically ambitious Kai Winn sought religious guidance from the Emissary, and Akorem Laan was able to single-handedly reinstate the observance of the obsolete &quot;D&#x27;Jarra&quot; caste system in 2372 when he briefly claimed the title of Emissary.

===Pagh Wraiths===

The Pagh Wraiths (also spelled Pah Wraiths), Bajoran for Soul Wraiths, are the enemies of the Bajoran Prophets. Bajoran religious texts state that the Pagh Wraiths once resided in the Celestial Temple (the Bajoran wormhole) alongside the Prophets and, like them, are non-corporeal beings. However, they were expelled from the Celestial Temple and banished to the Fire Caves on Bajor. According to ancient Bajoran texts, the Pagh Wraiths were &quot;false Prophets&quot;. Whereas the Prophets are analogous to angels or even gods, the Pagh Wraiths are analogous to demons.

Similarly to Christianity&#x27;s Satan, Kosst Amojan (&quot;The Evil One&quot;) was a Prophet who was forced out of the Celestial Temple after a failed attempt to seize control, with the other Pagh Wraiths, which are similar to fallen angels in Christianity. In several other incidents, the Pagh Wraiths attempted to leave their physical prison (the &quot;Caves of Fire&quot;) and return to take control of the Celestial Temple, but none of these attempts succeeded. There continues to be a minority group on Bajor who worship the Pagh Wraiths as the True Prophets, but they are generally shunned as outcasts and heretics. Despite this, the cult of the Pagh Wraiths became more popular on Bajor as an alternative religion to that of the Prophets, after many Bajorans felt the Prophets had abandoned them due to the closure of the wormhole. For a time, Dukat even formed his own Pagh Wraith cult on the abandoned space station Empok Nor, with himself as leader.

Like the Prophets, they are able to induce visions in corporeal beings, appearing as familiar figures as the Prophets do in such visions. The Pagh Wraiths long for revenge against the Prophets who cast them out of the Celestial Temple (the wormhole), even going so far as to possess the bodies of corporeal beings to further their goals:

Keiko O&#x27;Brien, wife of Deep Space Nine&#x27;s Chief of Operations Miles O&#x27;Brien, was briefly possessed by a Pagh Wraith in a nearly successful attempt to destroy the Prophets (episode: &quot;The Assignment&quot;); Miles instead directed the energy charge at Keiko O&#x27;Brien which destroyed the evil spirit and freed his wife.

In the episode &quot;The Reckoning&quot;, the Emissary (Benjamin Sisko) released a Pagh Wraith and a Prophet from an ancient artifact. These beings fought on the Gates to the Celestial Temple (the space station Deep Space Nine). In the fight, a Prophet possessed the (willing) body of Kira Nerys while the Pagh Wraith possessed the (unwilling) body of Jake Sisko.

In &quot;Tears of the Prophets&quot;; Gul Dukat unleashed a Pagh Wraith from an ancient relic that possessed his body. While possessed, Dukat proceeded to kill Jadzia Dax and use the Orb of Contemplation on Deep Space Nine to enable the Pagh Wraith to re-enter the wormhole and seal the entrance. However, when Sisko found the Orb of the Emissary some months later (in &quot;Shadows and Symbols&quot;), the wormhole reopened, and the Pagh Wraith was again cast out.

In the series finale, &quot;What You Leave Behind&quot;, Dukat and Winn Adami attempt to free the Pagh Wraiths from their prison by deciphering an ancient text written in the Book of the Kosst Amojan which acts as a key. Winn, who had briefly abandoned her faith in the Prophets after she had a vision from the Pagh Wraiths, ultimately undergoes a change of heart, but she is killed by Dukat as she tries to stop him. The wraiths are defeated when, with help from the Prophets, Sisko casts himself, Dukat and the Kosst Amojan into the Fire Caves, destroying the ancient book; Dukat is trapped forever with the Pagh Wraiths while Sisko becomes part of the Prophets.

==Politics==
===Provisional Government===

The provisional government was set up after the occupation of Bajor by Cardassia ended in 2369. It consisted of a council of elected officials headed by the First Minister and was responsible for administration of the planet and to a certain extent Deep Space Nine. A three-part arc, &quot;The Homecoming&quot;, &quot;The Circle&quot;, and &quot;The Siege&quot;, featured a story about the Provisional Government and its inability to resolve an explosive political revolution. In the immediate aftermath of the Cardassian withdrawal, many characters felt the provisional government would collapse within a matter of weeks, leading to civil war (which the Cardassians might use as an excuse to return to &quot;restore order&quot;). Sisko managed to convince Kai Opaka to declare the support of the Bajoran religious hierarchy for the new government, which prevented it from outright collapsing. In the early seasons of the TV series the provisional government is shaky and precarious, but over time by the later seasons of the TV series it grew more stable, particularly after the election of First Minister Shakaar.

===Bajoran Militia===

The Bajoran Militia was the military arm of the Bajoran Provisional Government, originally made up of many former resistance fighters from the Occupation of Bajor.

The structure was comparable to that of an Earth army, with similar ranks. Bajoran officers were organized by divisional specialty, wearing different uniform colors for each (similar to Starfleet). Flag officers wear a more elaborate version of the normal duty uniform.

Officers of the Militia were usually graduates of the Bajoran Military Academy, although many commissions were awarded on the basis of demonstrated skills and merit of the soldiers who were part of the resistance against the occupation.

The Militia jointly operated Deep Space Nine with Starfleet. From 2369 to 2375 the station was commanded by a Starfleet command level officer and the executive officer was a Militia member. When the station&#x27;s commander, Captain Sisko, disappeared in late 2375, his executive, Colonel Kira, took command.

It was said in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Rapture&quot; that if Bajor joins the United Federation of Planets, most of the Bajoran Militia would be absorbed into Starfleet. In the non-canonical relaunch novel &quot;Unity&quot;, this happened in 2376.

Notable members of the Bajoran Militia included Major Kira and Odo.

===Kai===

The Kai is the spiritual leader of the Bajoran people.

This individual could be either male or female, could be married, and could have children. The Kai is chosen in an election held by the entire Bajoran people, though typically candidates come from the Vedek assembly of high-ranking clerics. He or she also seems to hold a fair amount of political influence on Bajor; the government is headed by a First Minister although Bajorans typically will listen to whatever the Kai says.

When Starfleet forces initially arrived at Deep Space Nine, the Kai was a woman named Opaka Sulan. She introduced Commander Sisko to an Orb or Tear of the Prophets, and was the first to refer to him openly as &quot;the Emissary&quot;. Opaka was officially declared missing during an escorted trip through the Bajoran wormhole, when she discovered two feuding Gamma Quadrant races and elected to remain with them in hopes of negotiating a peaceful resolution to their conflict. In time, two leading candidates emerged to succeed her. One was Vedek Winn Adami—a member of a small conservative order on Bajor who harbored anti-Federation feelings.

The other was Vedek Bareil Antos, who counseled then-Vedek Winn and convinced her to adopt a more conciliatory attitude toward the Federation and Commander Sisko. Bareil was considered the most likely candidate to succeed Kai Opaka, but political maneuvering by Kai Winn forced him to resign his candidacy.

Kai Winn later tried to consolidate her hold on power after the death of the Bajoran First Minister, reneging on an agreement the previous government had made with several destitute Bajoran farmers and risking civil war in the process. Major Kira of DS9 convinced her old friend and resistance cell leader Shakaar Edon to run for election in opposition to Kai Winn to block her from obtaining total control of the Bajoran government. Kai Winn withdrew when Kira threatened to expose Winn&#x27;s duplicity, and Shakaar was elected to the post of First Minister.

Later, at the beginning of the Dominion War, Captain Sisko convinced Kai Winn, as well as the Council of Ministers, to sign a non-aggression treaty with the Dominion; Sisko wanted to ensure Bajor was kept out of the fighting so everything they had accomplished in the past five years wouldn&#x27;t be destroyed by the war.

With the end of the Dominion War in sight, Kai Winn was tempted to join with Dukat—who had been surgically altered to look like a Bajoran—in worshipping the Pagh Wraiths. When she discovered who the man really was, she was devastated by having fallen for the deception. When she sought Colonel Kira&#x27;s advice, Kira advised Winn she could be redeemed if she stepped down from the post, but Winn refused.

Kai Winn turned away from the Prophets, and became a tool of the Pagh Wraiths. In the final moments of her life, she tried to throw the Book of the Kosst-Amojan into the pit of fire. She was then killed by Dukat. In the non-canon MMORPG &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;, set thirty years after the events of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, it is implied that Kira Nerys eventually became Kai.

===First Minister===

The First Minister of Bajor is a role analogous to a President on Earth, and is a separate office from the religious leader, the Kai. The First Minister is the Bajoran head of government and head of state, and also serves as the head of the Chamber of Ministers, the Bajoran legislature. (A separate organization, the Vedek Assembly, serves as an advisory body to the Kai.)

;Office-holders since 2370
* Jaro Essa
* Kalem Apren
* Winn Adami (acting)
* Shakaar Edon

==Federation membership==

In the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; premiere episode &quot;Emissary&quot;, Captain Jean Luc Picard informs Benjamin Sisko that one of his tasks as commander of DS9 is to develop a continuing evaluation of Bajor for potential membership in the United Federation of Planets.

In the episode &quot;Rapture&quot;, Federation membership of Bajor is an important plot-point.

Later, in the non-canon &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; relaunch novels, Bajor finally joins the Federation. Most of the Bajoran Militia are absorbed into Starfleet, with Colonel Kira (now commanding DS9) promoted to captain. Also, the Bajoran government (here named the Third Republic of Bajor) begins selecting a councillor to represent Bajor on the Federation Council.

In the &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; pilot episode, a star map shows the planet Bajor within the bounds of Federation territory, suggesting that by the year 2399 (when the episode takes place), Bajor has indeed joined the Federation.

==Bajorans==
The first Bajoran to appear on Star Trek was Ro Laren, in the episode &quot;Ensign Ro&quot;.
* Keeve Folor, refugee leader, Valo II (Episode: TNG &quot;Ensign Ro&quot;; played by Scott Marlowe)
*Kai Opaka Sulan
* Kai Winn Adami
* Vedek Bareil Antos
* First Minister Shakaar Edon
* Kira Nerys
* Ro Laren
* Li Nalas
* Dr. Mora Pol
* Ensign Sito Jaxa
* Tora Ziyal
* Leeta
* Akorem Laan, 22nd century poet
* Tahna Los
* Tal Celes

== Reception ==
In 2017, &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked Bajorans the 5th best aliens of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

== Analysis ==
The Bajorans as analogues to oppressed people of Earth has been widely studied, as has the portrayal of Bajorans as righteous, religious &quot;freedom fighters&quot;.

<doc id="160024" wikidata="Q537983" url="?curid=160024" title="Harvest (Neil Young album)">
<text>Harvest is the fourth studio album by Canadian-American musician Neil Young, released on February 1, 1972, by Reprise Records, catalogue number MS 2032. It featured the London Symphony Orchestra on two tracks and vocals by guests David Crosby, Graham Nash, Linda Ronstadt, Stephen Stills, and James Taylor. It topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart for two weeks, and spawned two hit singles, &quot;Old Man&quot;, which peaked at No. 31 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;, which reached No. 1. It was the best-selling album of 1972 in the United States.

The album has since remained Neil Young&#x27;s signature album as well as his best selling. In 2015, &quot;Harvest&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Background==
In 1970, Young released both &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; with Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young and his third solo album, &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot;. The year also saw Young tour as a solo act and with both CSNY and his collaborators Crazy Horse. In the fall of 1970, Young released &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot;, divorced his wife Susan Acevedo, and purchased Broken Arrow Ranch in Redwood City, California, where he would live for the next four decades. While renovating his new home, Young injured his back, limiting his mobility and ability to perform electric guitar. Around the same time, Young would also begin his relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress. Young&#x27;s new home and romantic relationship would inspire several new songs.

After completing &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot;, Young promoted the album through a series of solo acoustic concerts. After playing Carnegie Hall in December 1970, Young returned to his ranch for a break in touring. While picking up a slab of walnut, Young injured his back, which prevented him from standing up while performing, limiting him to playing acoustic music. Young explains in an August 1975 interview with Cameron Crowe for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: 

Young embarked on a solo acoustic tour in January and February 1971 where he debuted many of the album&#x27;s songs. A performance on &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot; led to collaborations with record producer Elliot Mazer and Nashville studio musicians. In Nashville, Young recruited a group of country session musicians, whom he would dub The Stray Gators to record his new songs. The resulting record was a massive hit, producing a US number one single in &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;. The album&#x27;s success caught Young off guard and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. He would later write that the record &quot;put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.&quot;

==Writing==
In a post on his website, Young shares that much of &quot;Harvest&quot; &quot;was written about or for Carrie Snodgress, a wonderful actress and person and Zeke Young&#x27;s mother.&quot; In a radio interview, Young specifically cites &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;, &quot;Harvest&quot; and &quot;Out on the Weekend&quot; as being inspired by his then blossoming love.

&quot;A Man Needs a Maid&quot; was also inspired by Young&#x27;s budding relationship with Snodgress, whom he contacted after seeing her picture in a magazine. At a Philadelphia concert in October 2014, Young shared that the song was also inspired by a light switch in a hotel he stayed at while touring with CSNY: 

&quot;Heart of Gold&quot; has become Young&#x27;s signature song and was his only number 1 hit in the United States. In 1974, he would tell a journalist that its composition was influenced by French song &quot;Love Is Blue.&quot;

&quot;Are You Ready for the Country?&quot; was written shortly before being recorded for the album. It, like &quot;Words&quot; and &quot;Alabama&quot;, was recorded to provide contrast to the acoustic songs on the album. Young explains in a post on his website: &quot;Are You Ready for the Country?&quot; was written at the ranch shortly before the barn sessions happened. It&#x27;s a simple song based on an old blues melody that has been used many times. I thought it would bring some welcome relief from the other songs.&quot;

&quot;Old Man&quot; was inspired by Louis Avila, the caretaker of the Northern California ranch Young had recently purchased. He explains to an audience in January 1971: &quot;This is a new song that I wrote about my ranch. I live on a ranch now. Lucky me. There&#x27;s this old man who lives on it, that uh, he came with the place when I bought it. Ranches have foremen you know usually that sort of like stay there with the cows, no matter who owns it.&quot; He further describes Avila in his 2015 memoir, &quot;Special Deluxe&quot;: 

&quot;Alabama&quot; is &quot;an unblushing rehash of &#x27;Southern Man&#x27;&quot;; to which American southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd wrote their 1973 hit &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; in reply, stating &quot;I hope Neil Young will remember, a southern man don&#x27;t need him around, anyhow&quot;. Young later wrote of &quot;Alabama&quot; in his autobiography &quot;Waging Heavy Peace&quot;, saying it &quot;richly deserved the shot Lynyrd Skynyrd gave me with their great record. I don&#x27;t like my words when I listen to it. They are accusatory and condescending, not fully thought out, and too easy to misconstrue.&quot;

&quot;The Needle and the Damage Done&quot; was inspired directly by an overdose by bandmate Danny Whitten, who would later succumb to his addictions. The song was also inspired by several artists Young had seen fall to heroin, as he explained to a January 1971 audience: 

&quot;Words (Between the Lines of Age)&quot;, the last song on the album, featured a lengthy guitar workout with the band. In his 2012 memoir &quot;Waging Heavy Peace&quot;, Young reveals that the song &quot;Words&quot; was inspired by Young&#x27;s growing fame, and the first cracks in his relationship with Snodgress: 

==Recording==
The album was recorded across several different sessions in multiple locations in 1971. &quot;The Needle and the Damage Done&quot; was taken from a live solo performance at UCLA on January 30 during a solo acoustic tour. Multiple sessions in February and April were held in Nashville with established local studio musicians, produced by Elliot Mazer. &quot;A Man Needs a Maid&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s a World&quot; were recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra with Jack Nitzsche on March 1. The album&#x27;s electric tracks were recorded at Young&#x27;s ranch in September.

Young engaged in a solo acoustic tour in North America and the United Kingdom in January and February 1971. During the tour, he played several new songs inspired by life on his new ranch or the beginnings of his romantic relationship with Carrie Snodgress. Several of the shows were recorded for potential release as a live album. Young arrived in Nashville in early February 1971 to perform on an episode of the &quot;Johnny Cash Show&quot;. Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor were also slated to appear on the broadcast.

While in Nashville, Young met record producer Elliot Mazer. Mazer had recently opened Quadrafonic Sound Studios in Nashville in a converted house. Mazer remembers: &quot;The control room was the old porch. The living room and the dining room became the two live rooms, and the kitchen became a drum area. We called it &#x27;Quadraphonic&#x27; as a joke, although it did have four speakers in the control room.&quot; Eager to record his new songs, Mazer helped Young assemble a band of local Nashville musicians. Young remembers: 

Young would continue to work with Mazer and Drummond on several subsequent projects. Ben Keith would become one of Young&#x27;s most frequent collaborators until his death in 2010. Several of the musicians had performed with Nashville bands Area Code 615 and Barefoot Jerry. At these first sessions in early February the band was able to capture &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;, &quot;Old Man&quot;, &quot;Bad Fog of Loneliness&quot;, and &quot;Dance Dance Dance&quot;. Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor also visited the studio to contribute to the sessions with Young. The three sat on a couch and recorded the background vocals for &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; and &quot;Old Man&quot;. Taylor overdubbed a part for the latter song on Young&#x27;s banjo guitar. Ronstadt remembers the session in a &quot;Mojo&quot; interview: &quot;We were sat on the couch in the control room, but I had to get up on my knees to be on the same level as James because he&#x27;s so tall. Then we sang all night, the highest notes I could sing. It was so hard, but nobody minded. It was dawn when we walked out of the studio.&quot; Mazer recalls Young&#x27;s drive and the magical atmosphere: 

At the end of February, Young traveled to London record a performance for BBC Television and to perform a concert at the Royal Festival Hall. While there, he recorded two more songs for the album with orchestra accompaniment. &quot;A Man Needs a Maid&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s a World&quot; were recorded by Jack Nitzsche with the London Symphony Orchestra March 1 at Barking Town Hall. Young recalled the sessions in &quot;Waging Heavy Peace&quot;: &quot;I was in London and recorded &quot;A Man Needs a Maid&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s a World&quot; with the London Symphony Orchestra, produced and arranged by Jack Nitzsche. After hearing the playback in Glyn Johns&#x27;s truck, where the pieces were recorded outside the Barking Town Hall, Jack said, &#x27;I think it&#x27;s a bit overblown.&#x27; We knew it was over-the-top, but we had done it and we loved it.&quot; In the liner notes to &quot;Decade&quot;, Young remembers Bob Dylan reacting favorably to the production.

In April, Young returned to Nashville to record &quot;Out on the Weekend&quot;, &quot;Harvest&quot; and &quot;Journey Through the Past&quot; with Mazer at Quadrafonic. Mazer recalls Young being specific about what sound he wanted from the musicians during the sessions: &quot;At one point, Neil said to Kenny that his hi-hat was too busy, so Kenny said, &#x27;Fine. I&#x27;ll sit on my right hand.&#x27; He played the whole take (for &quot;Out on the Weekend&quot;) sitting on his right hand. Buttrey elaborates on his experiences playing with Young in &quot;Shakey&quot;: 

On August 11, Young went in for successful back surgery which allowed him to resume playing electric guitar with a band.

The electric-based songs were recorded in a barn at Young&#x27;s ranch in California in September. Using a remote recording system, Mazer set up PA speakers in the barn for monitors rather than have the players wear headphones. This resulted in a lot of &quot;leakage&quot; as each microphone picked up sound from other instruments, but Young and Mazer liked the resulting sound. &quot;Are You Ready for the Country&quot;, &quot;Alabama&quot;, and &quot;Words&quot; were recorded in these sessions with Buttrey, Drummond, Keith, along with Nitzsche on piano and lap steel. Young named this band, which would accompany him on his tour in the winter of 1973, The Stray Gators.

Background vocals by Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash were later recorded by Mazer in New York.

Mixing was done both at Quadrafonic and at Young&#x27;s ranch. Young invited Graham Nash to review playback of the album as it was being completed. Graham Nash recalls the experience in his 2013 memoir, &quot;Wild Tales&quot;: 

During the production of the album, Young hired filmmaker David Myers to film the sessions. The footage was used in two documentaries, the 1973 film &quot;Journey Through the Past&quot; and the 2022 documentary &quot;Harvest Time&quot;. &quot;Harvest Time&quot; shows much of the recording process in Nashville, London, Los Angeles and New York. Dutch director Wim van der Linden also recorded footage of the artist at his ranch and in concert during the era for the &quot;Swing In&quot; German television documentary series.

==Release==
The album cover was designed by art director Tom Wilkes. According to a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Young had wanted the album sleeve to biodegrade after the shrink-wrap was broken, but was overruled by the record company on the basis of expense and the possible product loss due to shipping accidents. Mo Ostin mentioned this request at the 22nd Annual ASCAP Pop Music Awards.

On October 15, 2002, &quot;Harvest&quot; was digitally remixed and remastered for the DVD-Audio format. The new 5.1 mix was the subject of minor controversy due to its unconventional panning, with the vocals in the centre of the room and the drums in the rear speakers. &quot;Harvest&quot; was remastered and released on HDCD-encoded CD and digital download on July 14, 2009, as part of the Neil Young Archives Original Release Series. A 180-gram remastered vinyl edition was released on December 1, 2009, along with remastered vinyl editions of Young&#x27;s first four albums. The remastered CD exists both as a standalone album and as Disc 4 of a 4-CD box set &quot;Official Release Series Discs 1-4&quot;, released in the US in 2009 and Europe in 2012.

==Critical reception==

Assessments by critics were not overwhelmingly favorable at the time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s John Mendelsohn called the album a &quot;disappointing retread&quot; of earlier, superior efforts by Young, writing of &quot;the discomfortingly unmistakable resemblance of nearly every song on this album to an earlier Young composition – it&#x27;s as if he just added a steel guitar and new words to &quot;After The Gold Rush&quot;.&quot; A review in &quot;The Montreal Gazette&quot; gave the album a mixed verdict, calling it &quot;embarrassing&quot; in places but interesting lyrically, and singling out &quot;Are You Ready for the Country?&quot; as the record&#x27;s best cut. Reappraising the record in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau wrote:

More recent evaluations of the album have been far more positive: in 1998, &quot;Q&quot; magazine readers voted &quot;Harvest&quot; the 64th greatest album of all time. In 1996, 2000 and 2005, &quot;Chart&quot; polled readers to determine the 50 greatest Canadian albums of all time – &quot;Harvest&quot; placed second in all three polls, losing the top spot to Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Blue&quot; in 2000, and to Sloan&#x27;s &quot;Twice Removed&quot; in the other two years. In 2003, a full three decades removed from its original harsh assessment, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named &quot;Harvest&quot; the 78th greatest album of all time, then was re-ranked 82nd in a 2012 revised list, and re-ranked 72nd in the 2020 list. In 2007, &quot;Harvest&quot; was named the No. 1 Canadian Album of All Time by Bob Mersereau in his book &quot;The Top 100 Canadian Albums&quot;. The album was featured in TeamRock&#x27;s list of &quot;The 10 Essential Country Rock Albums&quot;. It was voted number 93 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; 3rd Edition (2000).

<text>Zorro ( , Spanish for &quot;fox&quot;) is a fictional character created in 1919 by American pulp writer Johnston McCulley, appearing in works set in the Pueblo of Los Angeles in Alta California. He is typically portrayed as a dashing masked vigilante who defends the commoners and Indigenous peoples of California against corrupt, tyrannical officials and other villains. His signature all-black costume includes a cape, a hat known as a , and a mask covering the upper half of his face.

In the stories, Zorro has a high bounty on his head but is too skilled and cunning for the bumbling authorities to catch, and he also delights in publicly humiliating them. Because of this, the townspeople started calling him &quot;El Zorro&quot; because of his foxlike cunning and charm. Zorro is an acrobat and an expert in various weapons. Still, the one he employs most frequently is his rapier, which he often uses to carve the initial &quot;Z&quot; on his defeated foes and other objects to &quot;sign his work&quot;. He is also an accomplished rider, his trusty steed being a black horse called Tornado.

Zorro is the secret identity of Don Diego de la Vega (originally Don Diego Vega), a young Californio man who is the only son of Don Alejandro de la Vega, the wealthiest landowner in California, while Diego&#x27;s mother is dead. In most versions, Diego learned his swordsmanship while at university in Spain and created his masked alter ego after he was unexpectedly summoned home by his father because California had fallen into the hands of an oppressive dictator. Diego is usually shown living with his father in a vast , which contains many secret passages and tunnels leading to a secret cave that serves as headquarters for Zorro&#x27;s operations and as Tornado&#x27;s hiding place. To divert suspicion about his identity, Diego hides his fighting abilities while pretending to be a coward and a fop.

Zorro debuted in the 1919 novel &quot;The Curse of Capistrano&quot;, originally meant as a stand-alone story. However, the success of the 1920 film adaptation &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; starring Douglas Fairbanks and Noah Beery, which introduced the popular Zorro costume, convinced McCulley to write more Zorro stories for about four decades; the character was featured in a total of five serialized stories and 57 short stories, the last one appearing in print posthumously in 1959, the year after his death. &quot;The Curse of Capistrano&quot; eventually sold more than 50 million copies, becoming one of the best-selling books of all time. While the rest of McCulley&#x27;s Zorro stories did not enjoy the same popularity, as most of them were never reprinted until the 21st century, the character also appears in over 40 films and in ten TV series, the most famous being the Disney production, &quot;Zorro&quot;, of 1957–1959 starring Guy Williams. Other media featuring Zorro include stories by different authors, audio/radio dramas, comic books and strips, stage productions, and video games.

Being one of the earliest examples of a fictional masked avenger with a double identity, Zorro inspired the creation of several similar characters in pulp magazines and other media and is a precursor of the superheroes of American comic books, with Batman and the Lone Ranger drawing particularly close parallels to the character.

== Publishing history ==

Zorro debuted in Johnston McCulley&#x27;s novel &quot;The Curse of Capistrano&quot;, serialized in five parts between August 9 and September 6, 1919, in the pulp magazine &quot;All-Story Weekly&quot;. The story was initially meant as a standalone tale; at the denouement, Zorro&#x27;s true identity is revealed to all.

Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, on their honeymoon, selected the story as the inaugural picture for their new studio, United Artists, beginning the character&#x27;s cinematic tradition. The novel was adapted as the film &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; (1920), which Fairbanks produced, co-wrote, and starred in as Diego/Zorro. The movie was a commercial success, and the 1924 reprint of McCulley&#x27;s story by publisher Grosset &amp; Dunlap used the same title, capitalizing on the movie&#x27;s popularity. The novel has since been reprinted using both titles.

In response to public demand fueled by the film, McCulley wrote more than sixty more Zorro stories, beginning in 1922 with &quot;The Further Adventures of Zorro&quot;, also serialized in &quot;Argosy All-Story Weekly&quot;. Fairbanks picked up the movie rights for the sequel that year. However, Fairbanks&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Don Q, Son of Zorro&quot; (1925), was based more on the 1919 novel &quot;Don Q&#x27;s Love Story&quot; by the mother–son duo Kate Prichard and Hesketh Hesketh-Prichard than on &quot;The Further Adventures&quot;. Thus, McCulley received no credit for the film.

At first, the production of new Zorro stories proceeded irregularly: the third novel, &quot;Zorro Rides Again&quot; (not to be confused with the 1937 theatrical serial), was published in 1931, nine years after the second one. Then, between 1932 and 1941, McCulley wrote four short stories and two serialized novels. Zorro stories were published much more frequently between 1944 and 1951 when McCulley published 52 short stories with the character for the &quot;West Magazine&quot;. &quot;Zorro Rides the Trail!&quot;, which appeared in &quot;Max Brand&#x27;s Western Magazine&quot; in 1954, is the last story to be published during the author&#x27;s lifetime and the second-to-last story overall. The last, &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; (not to be confused with the 1998 film), was published posthumously in &quot;Short Stories for Men&quot; in 1959. These stories ignore Zorro&#x27;s public revelation of his identity.

&quot;The Curse of Capistrano&quot; eventually sold more than 50 million copies, becoming one of the best-selling books of all time. For the most part, McCulley&#x27;s other Zorro stories remained overlooked and out-of-print until the 21st century. Bold Venture Press collected all of McCulley&#x27;s Zorro stories &quot;Zorro: The Complete Pulp Adventures&quot;, in six volumes.

Over 40 Zorro-titled films were made over the years, including &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot;, the 1940 classic starring Tyrone Power and Basil Rathbone. The character was also featured in ten TV series, the most famous being the Disney-produced &quot;Zorro&quot; series of 1957–59, starring Guy Williams. Zorro appears in several stories written by other authors, comics books and strips, stage productions, video games, and other media. McCulley died in 1958, just as Zorro was at the height of his popularity thanks to the Disney series.

==Fictional character biography==
In &quot;The Curse of Capistrano,&quot; Señor Zorro became an outlaw in the pueblo of Los Angeles in California &quot;to avenge the helpless, to punish cruel politicians, to aid the oppressed&quot; and is dubbed the &quot;Curse of Capistrano&quot;. The novel features Don Diego Vega and Zorro extensively, but the fact that they are the same person is not revealed to the reader until the end of the book. In the story, Diego and Zorro romance Lolita Pulido, an impoverished noblewoman. While Lolita is unimpressed with Diego, who pretends to be a passionless fop, she is attracted to the dashing Zorro. The main villain is Captain Ramon, who also focuses on Lolita. Other characters include Sgt. Pedro Gonzales, Zorro&#x27;s enemy but Diego&#x27;s friend; Diego&#x27;s deaf and mute servant Bernardo; his ally, Fray (Friar) Felipe; his father, Don Alejandro Vega, the wealthiest landowner in California and a widower; Don Carlos Pulido and his wife, Doña Catalina, Lolita&#x27;s parents; and a group of noblemen () who, at first, hunt Zorro but are then won over to his cause.

In later stories, McCulley introduces characters such as pirates and Native Americans, some of whom know Zorro&#x27;s identity.

In McCulley&#x27;s later stories, Diego&#x27;s surname became de la Vega. The writer was wildly inconsistent. The first magazine serial ended with the villain dead, and Diego was publicly exposed as Zorro. But in the sequel, the villain was alive, and the next entry had the double identity still secret.

Several Zorro productions have expanded on the character&#x27;s exploits. Many continuations feature a younger character taking up the mantle of Zorro.

McCulley&#x27;s stories are set during the era of Spanish California (1769–1821) and, although exact years are often vague, the presence of the Pueblo of Los Angeles means the stories cannot happen before 1781, the year it was founded. Some media adaptations of Zorro&#x27;s story have placed him during the later era of Mexican California (1821–1848).

==Character motifs==
The character&#x27;s visual motif is typically a black costume with a black flowing Spanish cloak or cloak, a black flat-brimmed hat known as sombrero cordobés, and a black sackcloth mask that covers the top half of his head. Sometimes the mask is a two-piece, the main item being a blindfold-type fabric with slits for the eyes, and the other item is a bandana over the head so that it is covered even if the hat is removed: this is the mask worn in the movie &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; (1920) and in the television series &quot;Zorro&quot; (1957–1959). Other times, the mask is a one-piece that unites both items described above: this mask was introduced in &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; (1940) and appeared in many modern versions. Zorro&#x27;s mask has also occasionally been shown as a rounded domino mask, which he wore without wearing a bandana. In his first appearance, Zorro&#x27;s cloak is purple, his hat is generically referred to as a &quot;wide sombrero&quot;, and his black cloth veil mask with slits for eyes covers his whole face. Other features of the costume may vary.

His favored weapon is a rapier, which he also uses to often leave his distinctive mark, a Z cut with three quick strokes, on his defeated foes and other objects to &quot;sign his work&quot;. He also uses other weapons, including a bullwhip and a pistol.

The fox is never depicted as Zorro&#x27;s emblem. It is used as a metaphor for the character&#x27;s wiliness, such as in the lyrics &quot;Zorro, &#x27;the Fox&#x27;, so cunning and free...&quot; from Disney&#x27;s television series theme.

His heroic pose consists of rearing on his horse, Tornado, often saluting with his hand or raising his sword high. The logo of the company Zorro Productions, Inc. uses an image of Zorro rearing on his horse, sword raised high.

Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power, and Guy Williams used an epee dueling blade with a saber hilt. Antonio Banderas used a transitional rapier.

==Skills and resources==
Zorro specializes in infiltrating heavily guarded enemy structures or territories, espionage, and improvised explosive devices. He is also a weapons expert and a master of escape and camouflage. He is also good at deciphering numerous spoken and written languages, facilitating communication with locals regardless of ethnicity or language. Zorro is incredibly acrobatic, using his bullwhip as a gymnastic accouterment to swing through gaps between city roofs, and can land from great heights and take a fall. Although he is a master swordsman and marksman, he has repeatedly demonstrated his prowess in unarmed combat against multiple opponents.

In some versions, Zorro keeps a medium-sized dagger tucked in his left boot for emergencies. He has used his cape in creative ways as a blind, a trip-mat, and a disarming tool. Zorro&#x27;s boots are also sometimes weighted, as is his hat, which he has thrown, Frisbee-style, as an efficiently substantial warning to enemies. He is also a skilled tactician, using mockery to goad his opponents into traps or to irritate them into fighting poorly.

Zorro is a skilled horseman. The name of his jet-black horse has varied through the years. In &quot;The Curse of Capistrano&quot;, it was unnamed. In Disney&#x27;s &quot;Zorro&quot; television series, the horse gets the name Tornado, which has been kept in many later adaptations. In most versions, Zorro keeps Tornado in a secret cave, connected to his with a system of secret passages and tunnels.

McCulley&#x27;s concept of a band of men helping Zorro is often absent from other character versions. An exception is &quot;Zorro&#x27;s Fighting Legion&quot; (1939), starring Reed Hadley as Diego. In Douglas Fairbanks&#x27; version, he also has a band of masked men helping him. In McCulley&#x27;s stories, Zorro was aided by a deaf-mute named Bernardo. In Disney&#x27;s &quot;Zorro&quot; television series, Bernardo is not deaf but pretends to be and serves as Zorro&#x27;s secret agent. He is a capable and invaluable helper for Zorro, sometimes wearing the mask to reinforce his master&#x27;s charade. The Family Channel&#x27;s &quot;Zorro&quot; television series replaces Bernardo with a teenager named Felipe, played by Juan Diego Botto, with a similar disability and pretense. In Isabel Allende&#x27;s &quot;Zorro: A Novel,&quot; Bernardo is the child of the de la Vega&#x27;s Native housemaid, Ana, who forms a bond with Regina de la Vega, a former Native warrior who is converted, christianized and married to Don Alejandro. Their dual pregnancies result in them giving birth the same night. Due to complications from birth, Regina cannot breastfeed her child, Diego, so Ana breastfeeds both boys, making them milk brothers. The two are shown to be inseparable, which helps Bernardo receive a more formal education and accompanies Diego to Barcelona. After a group of pirates invades the de la Vega home, Bernardo witnesses the rape and murder of his mother, and a result, stops speaking. Diego&#x27;s grandmother, White Owl, concludes Bernardo refuses to speak as a form of mourning. He is shown to speak to Tornado in a spirit quest and later to a fellow native girl, Light-in-the-Night, whom he marries.

==Characteristics==
In &quot;The Curse of Capistrano&quot;, Diego is described as &quot;a fair youth of excellent blood and twenty-four years, noted the length of El Camino Real for his small interest in the really important things of life.&quot; It is also said that &quot;Don Diego was unlike the other full-blooded youths of the times. It appeared that he disliked action. He seldom wore his blade, except as a matter of style and apparel. He was damnably polite to all women and paid court to none. ... Those who knew Don Diego best declared he yawned ten score times a day.&quot; Though proud as befitting his class (and seemingly uncaring about the lower classes), he shuns action, rarely wearing his sword except for fashion, and is indifferent to romance with women. This is, of course, a sham. At the end of the novel, Diego explains that he has planned his double identity since he was fifteen:

&quot;It began ten years ago, when I was but a lad of fifteen&quot;, he said. &quot;I heard tales of persecution. I saw my friends, the , annoyed and robbed. I saw soldiers beat an old native who was my friend. And then I determined to play this game.&quot;

&quot;It would be a difficult game to play, I knew. So I pretended to have small interest in life, so that men never would connect my name with that of the highwayman I expected to become. In secret, I practiced horsemanship and learned how to handle a blade—&quot;

&quot;By the saints, he did&quot;, Sergeant Gonzales growled.

&quot;One half of me was the languid Don Diego you all knew, and the other half was the Curse of Capistrano I hoped one day to be. And then the time came, and my work began.&quot;

&quot;It is a peculiar thing to explain, . The moment I donned cloak and mask, the Don Diego part of me fell away. My body straightened, new blood seemed to course through my veins, my voice grew strong and firm, fire came to me! And the moment I removed cloak and mask I was the languid Don Diego again. Is it not a peculiar thing?&quot;

This part of the backstory was changed in the 1920 film &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot;. Diego recently returned from Spain at the movie&#x27;s start. Zorro later tells Lolita that he learned swordsmanship in Spain. The 1925 sequel &quot;Don Q, Son of Zorro&quot; expands on this concept by saying that: &quot;Though the home of the De Vegas has long been on California soil, the eldest son of each new generation returns to Spain for a period of travel and study.&quot; The 1940 film &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; keeps the idea of Diego learning his swordsmanship in Spain and adds the idea of him being unexpectedly summoned home by his father, Don Alejandro, when California fell into the hand of an oppressing dictator. Both ideas would then be included in most retellings of the character&#x27;s backstory.

With minor variations, McCulley&#x27;s portrayal of Diego&#x27;s personality is followed in most Zorro media.

A notable exception to this portrayal is Disney&#x27;s &quot;Zorro&quot; (1957–1959), where Diego, despite using the original façade early in the series, instead becomes a passionate and compassionate crusader for justice and masquerades as &quot;the most inept swordsman in all of California&quot;. In this show, everyone knows Diego would love to do what Zorro does but thinks he does not have the skill.

The Family Channel&#x27;s &quot;Zorro&quot; (1990–1993) takes this concept further. While Diego pretends to be inept with a sword, the rest of his facade exaggerates his real interests. Diego is well-versed and interested in art, poetry, literature, and science. His facade is pretending to be interested in only these things and not interested in swordplay or action. In this version of the story, Zorro also has a well-equipped laboratory in his hidden cave.

In Isabel Allende&#x27;s novel, Diego is a mestizo, the son of a Spanish aristocrat and a Shoshone warrior woman. Thus, as a child, Diego is caught between the divine right of nobility and the ways of his Native mother, grandmother, and ancestors.

==Inspirations==
The historical figure most often associated with the Zorro character is Joaquin Murrieta, whose life was fictionalized in the novel &quot;The Life and Adventures of Joaquín Murieta&quot; (1854) by John Rollin Ridge. In the 1998 film &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; Murrieta&#x27;s (fictitious) brother Alejandro succeeds Diego as Zorro. As a hero with a secret identity who taunts his foes by signing his deeds, Zorro finds a direct literary predecessor in Sir Percival Blakeney, hero of the &quot;Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; pulp series by Emma Orczy.

The character recalls other figures, such as Robin Hood, Reynard the Fox, Salomon Pico, Manuel Rodríguez Erdoíza, and Tiburcio Vasquez. Another possible historical inspiration is William Lamport, an Irish soldier who lived in Mexico in the seventeenth century. His life was the subject of a fictive book by Vicente Riva Palacio; &quot;The Irish Zorro&quot; (2004) is a recent biography. Another is Estanislao, a Yokuts man who led a revolt against the Mission San Jose in 1827.

The 1860s, 1880s, and 1900s penny dreadful treatment of the Spring-heeled Jack character as a masked avenger may have inspired some aspects of Zorro&#x27;s heroic persona. Spring Heeled Jack was portrayed as a nobleman who created a flamboyant, masked alter ego to fight injustice, frequently demonstrated exceptional athletic and combative skills, maintained a hidden lair and was known to carve the letter &quot;S&quot; into walls with his rapier as a calling card.

Like Sir Percy in &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, Don Diego avoids suspicion by playing the role of an effete dandy who wears lace, writes poetry, and shuns violence. The all-black Fairbanks film costume, which with variations has remained the standard costume for the character, was likely adapted from the Arrow serial film character &quot;The Masked Rider&quot; (1919). This character was the first Mexican black-clad masked rider on a black horse to appear on the silver screen. Fairbanks&#x27;s costume in &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot;, released the following year, resembled that of the Rider with only slight differences in the mask and hat.

In 1860, Mór Jókai published his novel &quot;Szegény Gazdagok&quot; (Poor Richmen), where the main character is the Hungarian Baron Lénárd Hátszegi, who is supposed to have the alterego of the &quot;Fatia Negra&quot; (The one with the Black face), an outlaw who robs local people during the night, and during the day lives an aristocratic life. The novel&#x27;s character was inspired by the real-life Hungarian Baron László Nopcsa (1794–1884), who, according to the local legends, had a similar type of alterego.

==Copyright and trademark disputes==
The copyright and trademark status of the Zorro character and stories have been disputed. At least five works are in the public domain in the United States because at least 95 years have passed after their first release: the 1919 novel &quot;The Curse of Capistrano&quot;, the 1920 film &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot;, the 1922 novel &quot;The Further Adventures of Zorro&quot;, the 1925 film &quot;Don Q, Son of Zorro&quot;, and the 1926 film &quot;In the Way of Zorro&quot;. Still, many later Zorro stories are still protected by copyright, and many of those copyrights are owned or controlled by Zorro Productions, Inc., which asserts it &quot;controls the worldwide trademarks and copyrights in the name, visual likeness and the character of Zorro.&quot; It further states &quot;[t]he unauthorized, unlicensed use of the name, character and/or likeness of &#x27;Zorro&#x27; is an infringement and a violation of state and federal laws.&quot;

In 1999, TriStar Pictures, a division of Sony Pictures, sued Del Taco, Inc., due to a fast-food restaurant advertising campaign that allegedly infringed Zorro Productions&#x27; claims to a trademark on the character of Zorro. Sony and TriStar had paid licensing fees to Zorro Productions, Inc. for the 1998 film &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot;. In an August 1999 order, the court ruled that it would not invalidate Zorro Productions&#x27; trademarks because the defendant argued that certain copyrights in Zorro were in the public domain or owned by third parties.

A dispute took place in the 2001 case of &quot;Sony Pictures Entertainment v. Fireworks Ent. Group.&quot; On January 24, 2001, Sony Pictures, TriStar Pictures and Zorro Productions, Inc., sued Fireworks Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, and Mercury Entertainment, claiming that the &quot;Queen of Swords&quot; television series infringed upon the copyrights and trademarks of Zorro and associated characters. &quot;Queen of Swords&quot; is a 2000–2001 television series set in Spanish California during the early 19th century and featuring a hero who wore a black costume with a red sash and demonstrated similarities to the character of Zorro, including the sword-fighting skills, use of a whip and bolas, and horse-riding skills.

Zorro Productions, Inc. argued that it owned the copyright to the original character because Johnston McCulley assigned his Zorro rights to Mitchell Gertz in 1949. Gertz died in 1961, and his estate was transferred to his children, who created Zorro Productions, Inc. Fireworks Entertainment argued that the original rights had already been transferred to Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. in 1920 and provided documents showing this was legally affirmed in 1929, and also questioned whether the copyright was still valid.

The court ruled that &quot;since the copyrights in &quot;The Curse of Capistrano&quot; and &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; lapsed in 1995 or before, the character Zorro has been in the public domain&quot;. Judge Collins also stated, &quot;Plaintiffs&#x27; argument that they have a trademark in Zorro because they licensed others to use Zorro, however, is specious. It assumes that ZPI had the right to demand licenses to use Zorro at all.&quot; Judge Collins subsequently vacated her ruling following an unopposed motion filed by Sony Pictures, TriStar Pictures, and Zorro Productions, Inc.

In another legal action in 2010, Zorro Productions, Inc., sued Mars, Incorporated, makers of M&amp;M&#x27;s chocolate candies, and ad agency BBDO Worldwide over a commercial featuring a Zorro-like costume. The case was settled (&quot;each party shall bear its own costs incurred in connection with this action, including its attorney&#x27;s fees and costs&quot;) on August 13, 2010.

In March 2013, Robert W. Cabell, author of &quot;Z – the Musical of Zorro&quot; (1998), filed another lawsuit against Zorro Productions, Inc. The lawsuit asserted that the Zorro character is in the public domain and that the trademark registrations by Zorro Productions, Inc., are therefore fraudulent. In October 2014, Cabell&#x27;s lawsuit was dismissed, with the judge ruling that the state of Washington (where the case was filed) did not have jurisdiction over the matter. However the judge later reversed his decision and had the case transferred to California. In May 2017, U.S. District Judge Davila granted Zorro Productions, Inc.&#x27;s motion to dismiss Cabell&#x27;s claim to cancel its federal trademark registrations. Cabell did not appeal.

In June 2015, Robert W. Cabell&#x27;s legal dispute with Zorro Productions, Inc. resulted in the Community Trade Mark for &quot;Zorro&quot; being declared invalid by the European Union&#x27;s Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market for goods of classes 16 and 41. This follows the &#x27;Winnetou&#x27; ruling of the Office&#x27;s First Board of Appeal in which the Board of Appeal ruled that the name of famous characters cannot be protected as a trademark in these classes. Zorro Productions appealed the decision, and on December 19, 2017, the EUIPO Fourth Board of Appeal nullified the lower court&#x27;s ruling, declaring the contested trademarks as valid, and required Cabell to pay the costs of the legal action, the appeal and Zorro Productions&#x27; legal fees and costs. Zorro Productions, Inc. owns approximately 1,300 other Zorro-related trademarks worldwide. In May 2018, Judge Edward Davila processed a complaint by Cabell to find Zorro Productions infringed copyright on his musical.

==Legacy==
The 1936 film &quot;The Vigilantes Are Coming&quot; features a masked vigilante with a costume similar to Zorro, which led several countries to name the movie after Zorro: the film was named &quot;Zorro l&#x27;indomptable&quot; in France, &quot;Zorro – Der blutrote Adler&quot; in Germany, &quot;Zorro – den blodrøde ørn&quot; in Denmark and &quot;Zorro – veripunainen kotka&quot; in Finland. The main character, The Eagle, is played by Robert Livingston, who would then play the actual Zorro in the movie &quot;The Bold Caballero&quot;, also released in 1936.&quot;The Vigilantes Are Coming&quot; &quot;was a reworking of &quot;The Eagle&quot;, Rudolph Valentino&#x27;s silent film.&quot; In the film, Valentino plays the masked hero Black Eagle. &quot;The Eagle&quot; was based on the posthumously published 1841 novel &quot;Dubrovsky&quot; by Alexander Pushkin; the Black Eagle does not exist in the novel and was inspired by the performance of Douglas Fairbanks as Zorro in &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot;.

The Masked Rider, the primary mascot of Texas Tech University, is similar to Zorro. Originally called &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;, it was an unofficial mascot appearing in a few games in 1936 and then became the official mascot with the 1954 Gator Bowl.

Being one of the earliest examples of a fictional avenger with a double identity, Zorro inspired the creation of several similar characters in pulp magazines and other media and is a precursor of the superheroes of American comic books, Jerry Siegel has credited Zorro along with The Scarlet Pimpernel as one of the inspirations for the creation of Superman particularly the concept of his dual identity as mild-mannered reporter Clark Kent, as Clark Kent&#x27;s harmless facade and dual identity were inspired by the protagonists of such movies as Don Diego de la Vega in &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; and Sir Percy Blakeney in &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, Siegel thought this would make for interesting dramatic contrast and good humor. Superman&#x27;s stance as the &quot;Champion of the Oppressed&quot; and devil-may-care attitude during his early Golden Age appearances were influenced by the characters of &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; star Douglas Fairbanks, who starred in similar adventure films such as &quot;Robin Hood&quot;.

Also, Bob Kane has credited Zorro, as one of the earliest examples of a fictional masked avenger with a dual identity, as part of the inspiration for the character Batman, which was created in 1939. Like Don Diego de la Vega, Bruce Wayne is affluent, the heir of wealth built by his parents. His everyday persona encourages others to think of him as shallow, foolish, and uncaring to throw off suspicion. Frank Miller&#x27;s comic book miniseries &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Dark Knight Strikes Again&quot; (2001–2002) both include multiple Zorro references, such as Batman inscribing a Z on a defeated foe. In later tellings of Batman&#x27;s origins, Bruce Wayne&#x27;s parents are murdered by a robber as the family leaves a showing of the 1940 film &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot;, starring Tyrone Power.
Zorro inspired a similar pulp character known as El Coyote, which was created in 1943 by José Mallorquí. A sample superhero character called The Fox appearing in the &quot;Supers&quot; supplement of the GURPS role-playing system is also based on Zorro.

The Republic Pictures serials &quot;Don Daredevil Rides Again&quot; (1951) and &quot;Man with the Steel Whip&quot; (1954) feature masked heroes similar to Zorro: Don Daredevil and El Latigo. Republic had previously released five Zorro serials between 1937 and 1949 but had since lost the license for the character and could not use him anymore. The serial makes frequent use of stock footage from all five Zorro serials, with scenes originally showing Zorro now being interpreted as showing Don Daredevil and El Latigo: the result of this is that the costume and body shape of Don Daredevil and El Latigo keeps changing between scenes, even becoming female in scenes taken from &quot;Zorro&#x27;s Black Whip&quot; (1944).

The 1956 musical comedy &quot;The Court Jester&quot; features a masked freedom fighter called The Black Fox (played by Edward Ashley), who combines aspects of both Zorro and Robin Hood.

Hanna-Barbera Productions&#x27; animated series &quot;Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks&quot; (1958–1961) featured a Zorro-like character with a mask, cape, and sword known in the episode &quot;Mark of the Mouse&quot; (1959). Hanna-Barbera Production&#x27;s animated series &quot;The Quick Draw McGraw Show&quot; (1959–1962) features El Kabong, an alternate persona of the main character Quick Draw McGraw, which is loosely based upon Zorro.

In the animated series &quot;Justice League&quot; (2001–2004), a DC Comics character, El Diablo, bears a striking similarity to Zorro, in that he wears the same style hat, mask, sash, and cape. The main difference is that his primary weapon is a whip. The Lazarus Lane version of El Diablo appears in &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; (2004–2006), voiced by Nestor Carbonell. While designed after his comic appearance, elements from Zorro&#x27;s appearance were added. Seen in the episode &quot;The Once and Future Thing&quot; (2005), he appears alongside Pow Wow Smith, Bat Lash, and Jonah Hex.

In 2015, the M7 Con Western Convention, held at the Los Angeles Convention Center, featured a segment on the history of Zorro in film and television. The presentation focused on the great Zorro actors including Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power, Guy Williams, and Duncan Regehr. Maestro Ramon Martinez and actor Alex Kruz gave a live demonstration of the Spanish style of fencing known as La Verdadera Destreza. The two dueled live as Zorro and the Comandante, much to the crowd&#x27;s delight.

A cave that was used as a filming location in various Zorro productions is now known as &quot;Zorro&#x27;s Cave&quot; and remains in place, now hidden behind a condominium complex, on land that was once the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, Los Angeles, recognized as the most widely filmed outdoor shooting location in the history of Hollywood.

The DreamWorks character Puss in Boots, an anthropomorphic cat sporting high boots, a broad-brimmed and feathered sombrero, and a rapier, was also heavily inspired by Zorro (though ultimately based on the earlier Italian fairy tale character of the same name). Portrayed by Antonio Banderas, who had also earlier played Zorro, he premiered as a character in &quot;Shrek 2&quot; (2004) and in the later sequels, as well as inspiring spin-off films, &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; (2011) and &quot;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish&quot; (2022).

===Toys===
Due to the popularity of the Disney TV series, in 1958, The Topps Company produced an 88-card set featuring stills from that year&#x27;s movie. The cards were rare and became collectors&#x27; items. In the same year, the Louis Marx company released a variety of Zorro toys, such as hats, swords, toy pistols, and a playset, with the Lido company also making plastic figures.

A major toy line based on the classic Zorro characters, motifs, and styling was released by Italian toy giant Giochi Preziosi, master toy licensees of the property. The toy range was developed by Pangea Corporation and released worldwide in 2005. It featured action figures in various scales, interactive playsets, and roleplaying items. New original characters were also introduced, including Senor Muerte, who served as a foil to Zorro.

In 2007, Brazilian toymaker Gulliver Toys licensed the rights to &quot;&quot;, which was co-developed by BKN and Pangea Corporation. The toy range was designed concurrently and in association with the animated program.

In 2011, US-based collectibles company Triad Toys released a 12-inch Zorro action figure.

===Comics===

Zorro has appeared in many different comic book series over the decades. Zorro was adapted into comics in France in 1939 in &quot;Jumbo&quot;. Its best-known artists were André Oulié (1947-1967), Eu. Gire (1949). 

In &quot;Hit Comics&quot; #55, published by Quality Comics in November 1948, Zorro is summoned by Kid Eternity, but in this version has only a whip and does not wear a mask.

Dell Comics published Zorro in &quot;Four Color Comics&quot; #228 (1949), 425 (1952), 497 (1953), 538 (1954), 574 (1954), 617 (1955) and 732 (1957). These stories featured artwork by Everett Raymond Kinstler (#497, 538, and 574), Bob Fujitani, Bob Correa and Alberto Giolitti.

Dell also had a license to publish Disney comics in the United States and, following the launch of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Zorro&quot; TV series in 1957, published seven more issues of &quot;Four Color&quot; dedicated to Zorro between February 1958 and September 1959, under said license, with the first stories featuring artwork by Alex Toth. In December 1959, Dell started the publication of a standalone Disney-licensed &quot;Zorro&quot; title, which started the numeration at #8 and continued to be published until issue #15 (September 1961). The character then appeared in four stories published in the monthly &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; (also published by Dell), one story per issue from #275 (August 1963) to #278 (November 1963): these were the last Zorro stories produced in the United States under the Disney license. However, Disney produced more stories from 1964 to 1978 through the Disney Studio Program, a unit producing comic book stories exclusively for foreign consumption. In addition to publishing translations of American stories and Disney Studio stories, many foreign publishers also produced their own original stories under the Disney licence: these countries are the Netherlands (1964–1967), Chile (1965–1974), Italy (1969–1971), Brazil (1973–1983), France (1974–1986) and Germany (1980–1982).

From 1964 to 1967, Hans Kresse (art) and Joop Termos (script) offered unpublished stories to the readers of the Dutch youth weekly &quot;Pep&quot;.

Gold Key Comics started another Disney-licensed &quot;Zorro&quot; series in January 1966, but, like their contemporaneous Lone Ranger series, it featured only material reprinted from the earlier Dell comics and folded after nine issues in March 1968. The character remained dormant in the United States for the next twenty years until it was revived by Marvel Comics in 1990 for a 12-issue tie-in with the Duncan Regehr television series &quot;Zorro&quot;. Many of these comics had Alex Toth covers.

In 1993, Topps Comics published a 2-issue limited series &quot;Dracula Versus Zorro&quot; followed by a &quot;Zorro&quot; series that ran 11 issues. Topps also published two limited series of &quot;Lady Rawhide&quot;, a spin-off from the Zorro stories created by writer Don McGregor and artist Mike Mayhew. McGregor subsequently scripted a limited series adaptation of &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; film for Image Comics.

A newspaper daily and Sunday strip were also published in the late 1990s. This was written by McGregor and rendered by Tom Yeates. Papercutz once published a Zorro series and graphic novels. This version is drawn in a manga style.

Dynamite Entertainment relaunched the character with a 20-issue &quot;Zorro&quot; series which ran from 2008 to 2010, written by Matt Wagner and drawn by multiple artists. The publisher also released an earlier unpublished tale called &quot;Matanzas&quot; by Don McGregor and artist Mike Mayhew. Zorro (here a 1930s descendant) also appears in the 2013 Dynamite eight-issue limited series &quot;Masks&quot; alongside the Green Hornet and Kato, The Shadow, and The Spider. It was written by Chris Roberson with art by Alex Ross and Dennis Calero.

Dynamite Entertainment also published a seven-issue series titled &quot;Django/Zorro&quot; between November 2014 and May 2015, teaming Zorro with the character Django Freeman from Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s movie &quot;Django Unchained&quot; (2012). The series was co-written by Tarantino and Matt Wagner, with art by Esteve Polls.

In 2018, American Mythology took the license, launched the series &quot;Zorro Legendary Adventures&quot;, written by Jean-Marie Nadaud and drawn by Robert Rigot and limited series &quot;Zorro: Swords of Hell&quot;, written by David Avallone and illustrated by Roy Allan Martinez. The company has since released crossovers featuring Zorro with their other licensed properties, namely &quot;Zorro in the Land that Time Forgot&quot; featuring Diego De La Vega accompanying an expedition to the lost world of Caspak from the Edgar Rice Burroughs novels.

In 2020, the French publisher Dargaud launched &quot;Don Vega&quot; by Pierre Alary.

In 2023, it was announced that Sean Gordon Murphy would write and illustrate a four-issue miniseries for Massive Publishing entitled &quot;Zorro: Man of the Dead&quot;, set for release in 2024.

* Alvaro Cervino produced a musical comedy, &quot;Zorro El Musical&quot;, in Mexico City, Mexico, in July 1996. Critics called it &quot;a show that captivates audiences both by its performances and above all, by its magnificent musical numbers&quot;.
* Michael Nelson wrote a stage adaptation of Zorro for the Birmingham Children&#x27;s Theater in 1996. Beaufort County Now called it &quot;a fun and fast paced production perfect for children 6 and up.&quot; Abe Reybold directed with scenic design by Yoshi Tanokura and costume designs by Donna Meester. Jay Tumminello provided an original score.
* Theater Under the Stars in Houston, Texas, put on &quot;Zorro, the Musical&quot; as an opera in 1998. It was written and directed by Frank Young and starred Richard White as Zorro.
* &quot;Z – The Masked Musical&quot; by Robert W. Cabell was released in 1998 as a CD. The CD premiere with Ruben Gomez (Zorro) and Debbie Gibson (Carlotta) is published as a CD. In 2000, the stage play premiered at the South Eugene High School in Eugene, Oregon, where it had four performances by the amateur group ACE. It was then produced on June 13, 2013, at the Clingenburg Festspiele in Klingenberg am Main, Bavaria, Germany, with Karl Grunewald and Philip Georgopoulos as alternating Zorros, Judith Perez as Carlotta, Daniel Coninx as Governor Juan Carlos, Daniel Pabst as Capitàn Raphaél Ramerez and Christian Theodoridis as Sergeant Santiago Garcia.

* In 1999, Anthony Rhine and Joseph Henson wrote &quot;Zorro Live!&quot;, which was performed at the Riverside Light Opera theater.
* In 2000, Fernando Lúpiz produced his first original &quot;Zorro&quot; show. It was such a crowd-pleaser that he mounted a new production thereafter almost annually until 2014. His productions were performed most frequently in arenas, featuring live horses, rousing swordplay, and songs.
* In 2001, the Gaslight Theatre of Tucson, Arizona, reprised its 1994 spoof called &quot;Zerro Rides Again&quot; or &quot;No Arrest for the Wicked&quot;. It was described as &quot;full of silly wigs, ridiculous situations, songs that barely fit in, and dialogue so fat with wordplay that it&#x27;s tough not to love it. &#x27;Zerro&#x27; is a chance to laugh yourself silly. Seize it&quot;.
* In 2002, playwright Michael Harris wrote &quot;The Legend of Zorro&quot;, which has been performed in many high schools.
* In 2002, Luis Alvarez produced his &quot;El Zorro El Spectaculo&quot; at the Teatro Calderon in Madrid, Spain. Critics lauded it, saying, &quot;Manuel Bandera makes the ideal Zorro. We hope he has the stamina necessary to endure the long run this play deserves.&quot;
* Michael Smuin&#x27;s critically lauded modern ballet version of &quot;Zorro&quot; premiered in the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco in 2003. Composer Charles Fox provided the score, and Matthew Robbins wrote the libretto. Ann Beck was the costume designer, and Douglas W. Schmidt was the set designer. Smuin himself choreographed with Fight Director Emeritus Richard Lane as Fencing Master.
* Culture Clash&#x27;s &quot;Zorro in Hell&quot; opened in 2005 in the Berkeley Repertory Theater, then in 2006 in the La Jolla Playhouse and the Montalban Theater in Los Angeles. &quot;Zorro In Hell&quot; was written and performed by Richard Montoya, Ric Salinas, and Herbert Siguenza. Culture Clash used the legend of Zorro as a lens to examine California&#x27;s cultural, economic, and historical issues. The &quot;LA Times&quot; called it &quot;a zany bicultural send-up of California history.&quot;
* Award-winning playwright Bernardo Solano wrote a modern adaptation of Zorro for TheatreWorks at the University of Colorado in 2007. Robert Castro directed, and Justin Huen starred as Zorro. The Denver Post called the production &quot;a fresh take&quot; and &quot;a formula other companies should emulate.&quot;
* In Uppsala, Sweden, Erik Norberg wrote a Zorro stage adaptation for the Stadsteatern Theatre, directed by Alexander Oberg, starring Danilo Bejarano as Zorro. The production opened in 2008.
* A musical titled &quot;Zorro&quot; opened in the West End of London in 2008.

The US premiere production took place in 2012 at Hale Centre Theatre in Salt Lake City, Utah, with a further production at the Alliance Theater in Atlanta, Georgia, where it won five awards, including Best Musical.
* The Scottish children&#x27;s theater troupe Visible Fictions put on a touring production of &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; in 2009. Davey Anderson wrote the script, and Douglas Irvine directed it. Robin Peoples designed the sets, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;a triumph.&quot;

* In 2012, Janet Allard and Eleanor Holdridge produced and directed &quot;Zorro&quot; at the Constellation Theatre in Washington, DC. Holdridge directed, and Danny Gavigan played Zorro. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said of the production, &quot;Constellation augments its classical thrust in a thoughtful way with &#x27;Zorro,&#x27; which continues the company&#x27;s laudable efforts at delivering intimate theater with high standards for design.&quot;
* In 2012, Medina Produzioni, based in Rome, Italy, produced its musical, &quot;W Zorro il Musical – liberamente ispirato alla storia di William Lamport&quot; in numerous theatres throughout Italy.
* The Oregon-based ballet troupe Ballet Fantastique produced &quot;Zorro: The Ballet&quot; as an opener to their 2013 season. Eugene Weekly called the ballet a &quot;zesty, fresh, fantastic treat.&quot;

===Music===
On the commercial release of the &quot;Zorro&quot; 1957 Disney TV series&#x27; Zorro theme, the lead vocal was by Henry Calvin, the actor who played Sergeant Garcia on the program. The song was written by Jimmie Dodd.

The Chordettes sang the single version of the song, complete with the &quot;Sounds of the Z&quot; and the clip-clopping of Zorro&#x27;s horse, which is heard at the song&#x27;s end. The song hit Number 17 in 1958, according to the Billboard Charts.

In 1964, Henri Salvador sang &quot;Zorro est arrivé.&quot; It tells from a child&#x27;s point of view how exciting it is whenever a villain threatens to kill a lady in the television series. But every time again, to his relief, the &quot;great and beautiful&quot; Zorro comes to the rescue. An early music video was made at the time.

Alice Cooper&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;Zipper Catches Skin&quot; includes the song &quot;Zorro&#x27;s Ascent&quot;, which is about Zorro facing his death.

The 1999 song &quot;El Corona&quot; by Suburban Legends tells the story of &quot;Don Diego&quot;, the &quot;hombre en negro&quot; (&quot;man in black&quot;), a &quot;tall Spaniard with a sharp sword&quot; who was &quot;down and out in LA&quot; and defending the people from an unnamed corrupt ruler.

<text>The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF; , FCC) was a federal democratic socialist and social-democratic political party in Canada. The CCF was founded in 1932 in Calgary, Alberta, by a number of socialist, agrarian, co-operative, and labour groups, and the League for Social Reconstruction. In 1944, the CCF formed one of the first social-democratic governments in North America when it was elected to form the provincial government in Saskatchewan.

The full, but little used, name of the party was Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Farmer-Labour-Socialist).

In 1961, the CCF was succeeded by the New Democratic Party (NDP).

==History==
===Origins===
The CCF aimed to alleviate the suffering that workers and farmers, the ill and the old endured under capitalism, seen most starkly during the Great Depression, through the creation of a Co-operative Commonwealth, which would entail economic co-operation, public ownership of the economy, and political reform.
The object of the political party as reported at its founding meeting in Calgary in 1932 was &quot;the federation [joining together] of organizations whose purpose is the establishment in Canada of a co-operative commonwealth, in which the basic principle of regulating production, distribution and exchange will be the supplying of human needs instead of the making of profit.&quot;

The goal of the CCF was defined as a &quot;community freed from the domination of irresponsible financial and economic power in which all social means of production and distribution, including land, are socially owned and controlled either by voluntarily organized groups of producers and consumers or – in the case of major public services and utilities and such productive and distributive enterprises as can be conducted most efficiently when owned in common – by public corporations responsible to the people&#x27;s elected representatives&quot;. Many of the party&#x27;s first Members of Parliament (MPs) were members of the Ginger Group, composed of United Farmers of Alberta, left-wing Progressive, and Labour MPs. These MPs included United Farmers of Alberta MPs William Irvine and Ted Garland, Agnes Macphail (UFO), Humphrey Mitchell, Abraham Albert Heaps, Angus MacInnis, and Labour Party MP J. S. Woodsworth. Founding groups included the Independent Labour Party (of Manitoba), the Canadian Labour Party (mostly in Edmonton), the Dominion Labour Party of southern Alberta, the UFA, and the United Farmers of Ontario (which withdrew from the CCF in 1934).

Also involved in founding the new party were members of the League for Social Reconstruction (LSR), such as F. R. Scott and Frank Underhill. It can be said that the CCF was founded on May 26, 1932, when the Ginger Group MPs and LSR members met in William Irvine&#x27;s office, the unofficial caucus meeting room for the Ginger Group, and went about forming the basis of the new party. J. S. Woodsworth was unanimously appointed the temporary leader until they could hold a founding convention. The temporary name for the new party was the Commonwealth Party. The Social Gospel was a significant influence on the CCF.
At its founding convention in 1932 in Calgary, the party settled on the name &quot;Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Farmer-Labour-Socialist)&quot; and selected J. S. Woodsworth as party leader. Woodsworth had been an Independent Labour Party MP since 1921 and a member of the Ginger Group of MPs. The party&#x27;s 1933 convention, held in Regina, Saskatchewan, adopted the Regina Manifesto as the party&#x27;s program. The manifesto outlined a number of goals, including public ownership of key industries, universal public pensions, universal health care, children&#x27;s allowances, unemployment insurance, and workers&#x27; compensation.

Its conclusion read, &quot;No CCF Government will rest content until it has eradicated capitalism and put into operation the full programme of socialized planning which will lead to the establishment in Canada of the Co-operative Commonwealth.&quot; The party affiliated itself with the Socialist International.

===Electoral performance===

In line with Alberta&#x27;s important role in founding the CCF, it is said that the first CCF candidate elected was Chester Ronning in the Alberta provincial constituency of Camrose, in October 1932. The UFA, under whose banner he contested the election, formalized its already-strong connection to the CCF in its next provincial convention, in January 1933.
In its first federal election, seven CCF MPs were elected to the House of Commons in 1935. Eight were elected in the following election in 1940, including their first member east of Manitoba, Clarence Gillis, in Cape Breton, a coal-mining area of Nova Scotia (specifically the federal riding of Cape Breton South).

The party was divided with the outbreak of World War II: Woodsworth was a pacifist, while many party members supported the Canadian war effort. Woodsworth had a physically debilitating stroke in May 1940 and could no longer perform his duties as leader. In October, Woodsworth wrote a letter to the 1940 CCF convention, in essence asking to retire from the leadership. Instead, the delegates created the new position of Honorary President, abolished the President&#x27;s position and re-elected M. J. Coldwell as the National Chairman. Coldwell was then appointed acting House Leader on 6 November. Woodsworth died on 21 March 1942, and Coldwell officially became the new leader at the July convention in Toronto and threw the party behind the war effort. As a memorial to Woodsworth, Coldwell suggested that the CCF create a research foundation, and Woodsworth House was established in Toronto for that purpose.

The party won a critical York South by-election on 8 February 1942, and in the process prevented the Conservative leader, former Prime Minister Arthur Meighen, from entering the House of Commons.

In the 1945 election, 28 CCF MPs were elected, and the party won 15.6% of the vote.

In the 1949 election, 13 CCF candidates were elected. This was followed by 23 elected in the 1953 election and a disappointing eight elected in the 1958 election. (In that election, the party took almost ten percent of the vote so was due about 26 MPs proportionally.)

The party had its greatest success in provincial politics. 

In 1943, the Ontario CCF became the official opposition in that province.

In 1944, the Alberta CCF took almost a quarter of all votes cast but due to lack of PR, were held to winning just two seats.

In 1944, the Saskatchewan CCF formed the first democratic socialist government in North America, with Tommy Douglas as premier. Douglas introduced universal Medicare to Saskatchewan, a policy that was soon adopted by other provinces and implemented nationally by the Liberal Party of Canada during the administration of Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson. Tommy Douglas&#x27;s CCF governed Saskatchewan from 1944 to 1961.

===New Party===
Federally, during the Cold War, the CCF was accused of having Communist leanings. The party moved to address these accusations in 1956 by replacing the Regina Manifesto with a more moderate document, the Winnipeg Declaration. Nevertheless, the party did poorly in the 1958 federal election, winning only eight seats.

After much discussion, the CCF and the Canadian Labour Congress decided to join forces to create a new political party that could make social democracy more popular with Canadian voters. This party, initially known as the New Party, became the New Democratic Party (NDP) in 1961.

==Election results==
==Organization==
The CCF estimated its membership as being slightly more than 20,000 in 1938, less than 30,000 in 1942, and over 90,000 in 1944. Membership figures declined following World War II to only 20,238 in 1950 and would never again reach 30,000

By the late 1940s, the CCF had official or unofficial weekly newspapers in Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan; twice-monthly papers in Ontario and Manitoba; and a bimonthly in the Maritimes. A French-language paper in Quebec was also attempted at various times. The party also produced many educational books, pamphlets, and magazines, though these efforts declined in the 1950s.

===Party leaders===
===National chairmen===
The national chairman was the equivalent of party president in most Canadian political parties and was sometimes referred to as such, in that it was largely an organizational role. In the case of the CCF, the national chairman oversaw the party&#x27;s national council and chaired its meetings. Following an initial period in which Woodsworth held both roles, it was usually distinct from and secondary to the position of party leader. National president originally was also a title the leader held, as both Woodsworth and Coldwell held the title when they held seats in the House of Commons. In 1958, after Coldwell lost his seat, the position of national chairman was merged formally into the president&#x27;s title and was held by David Lewis.

* J. S. Woodsworth (1932–38)

* F. R. Scott (1942–50)
* Percy Wright (1950–54)
* David Lewis (1954–58)
* David Lewis as party president (1958–61)

===National secretaries===
The national secretary was a staff position (initially part-time, and then full-time beginning 1938) which was responsible for the day-to-day organizing of the party. The national secretary was the only full-time employee at the party&#x27;s national headquarters until 1943, when a research director, Eugene Forsey, and an assistant to the leader were hired.

==CCF song==

The CCF song would be later popularized by the movie &quot;Prairie Giant: The Tommy Douglas Story&quot;.

First verse:

:&quot;A call goes out to Canada&quot;
:&quot;It comes from out the soil—&quot;
:&quot;Come and join the ranks through all the land&quot;
:&quot;To fight for those who toil&quot;
:&quot;Come on farmer, soldier, labourer,&quot;
:&quot;From the mine and factory,&quot;
:&quot;And side by side we&#x27;ll swell the tide—&quot;
:&quot;C.C.F. to Victory.&quot;

<text>A clitoral hood piercing is a female genital piercing through the clitoral hood surrounding the clitoris. In addition to being an adornment, a clitoral hood piercing can enhance sexual pleasure during masturbation, foreplay and intercourse. In an empirical study at the University of South Alabama, the authors reported a positive relationship between vertical clitoral hood piercings and desire, frequency of intercourse, and sexual arousal. There are two main types of clitoral hood piercing: the vertical clitoral hood (VCH) piercing and the horizontal clitoral hood (HCH) piercing. As the names indicate, the difference is in the direction the piercing is oriented in the skin above the clitoris. Neither of these piercings penetrates the clitoris itself, although in common parlance they are sometimes called &quot;clit&quot; piercings. The deep hood piercing is a variation of the clitoral hood piercing that passes deeper through the clitoral hood.

==Motivations==
Clitoral hood piercings are done to enhance sexual pleasure, for aesthetic reasons, as an artistic expression of personal style, and for survivors of sexual abuse or assault, as an act of reclamation.

According to &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine, many people say the vertical clitoral hood piercing enhances sexual pleasure more than a horizontal clitoral hood piercing. The vertical orientation of the jewelry increases pressure on the clitoris, particularly if the lower sphere (bead) of a barbell is situated to apply pressure directly to the glans of the clitoris. The clitoris is the human female&#x27;s most sensitive erogenous zone and the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. The glans of the human clitoris is about the size of a pea but is estimated to have 8,000 to 10,000 sensory nerve endings, approximately double the number of the glans of the human male penis, which is much larger. The extremely high density of sensory nerve endings in the glans of the clitoris enables it to be exceptionally sensitive to stimulation.

A clitoral hood piercing may be desired as an adornment, either on its own, or in association with other body piercings. Some people say that even if they were the only person who ever saw their genital piercings, they would be happy with them.

For many who have been sexually assaulted, raped, sexually abused, or psychologically hurt in various ways, genital piercings serve as a means to reclaim their sexuality or their ownership of their genitals.

==Execution==
Correct positioning is particularly important for vertical clitoral hood piercings: a mistake often made by inexperienced piercers is positioning the puncture channel too flat or too far forward. The piercing tends to grow out and often the desired contact with the clitoris does not happen. This misplacement often occurs when working with clamp pliers. Also, the piercing must not be placed too close to the edge of the clitoral hood. There should be at least between the puncture channel and the distal end of the clitoral hood.

==Pain, healing and aftercare==
Compared to other piercings, clitoral hood piercings tend to be rather uncomplicated with regard to the piercing process itself as well as the healing, which certainly contributes to the popularity of the piercing. In contrast to common expectations, this piercing is no more painful to perform than other body piercings. Since the piercing passes through a thin layer of tissue, it is quick to pierce and reportedly hurts less than ear piercings. Clitoral hood piercings also have rather short healing times, due to the amount of blood circulation to the area. The average healing time is 8-12 weeks. During the healing period, the piercing is a wound and can increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections. Use of condoms is advised for six months. Showers are recommended over baths to reduce the risk of bacterial infection during the healing period. The piercing should be dried using only fresh disposable paper towel/kitchen roll. A communal hand/bath towel should never be used. Surgical gloves are recommended when cleaning the pierced area, and during masturbation or digital stimulation by a partner.

==Contraindications==
A vertical clitoral hood piercing is not suitable for a short clitoral hood. This piercing requires a minimum clitoral hood length of approximately . Excessive pressure due to fat or sagging in the pubic mound area would preclude a vertical clitoral hood piercing. A horizontal clitoral hood piercing might be an alternative for some, however horizontal clitoral hood piercing is only suitable for people who have enough tissue above the clitoris and whose clitoral hood is not completely covered by the outer labia. The shape and symmetry of the clitoral hood are also important to keep the piercing from rotating or pinching. If a person&#x27;s anatomy is unsuitable for a clitoral hood piercing, a pubic piercing for a male sexual partner can sometimes provide the desired clitoral stimulation during intercourse. As an alternative to either partner obtaining a piercing, a male partner can wear a removable device at the base of the penis that incorporates a clitoral stimulator or vibrator. Likewise, various clitoral vibrators and suction devices are available to enhance lesbian genital-to-genital contact.

==Jewelry==
A wide variety of body piercing jewelry can be worn with clitoral hood piercings. Barbells, J-bars and other bar-style jewelry are common in vertical hood piercings, and both captive bead rings (also called ball capture rings or BCRs) and barbells are common in horizontal hood piercings. Silver jewelry should be avoided. It is not uncommon for the beads of a barbell to be decorative, as is common in navel piercings.

Kendal was born in Olton, England, but moved to India with her family from the age of seven. Her father was an English actor-manager who led his own repertory company on tours of India, and Kendal appeared in roles for the company both before and after leaving England. She appeared in the film &quot;Shakespeare Wallah&quot; (1965) which was inspired by her family.

Kendal made several television appearances, starting with &quot;Love Story&quot; in 1966, and made her London stage debut in &quot;Minor Murder&quot; (1967) at the Savoy Theatre. She was approached to appear in &quot;The Good Life&quot; while appearing in &quot;The Norman Conquests&quot;, and appeared in all four series. She later went on to star in the sitcoms &quot;Solo&quot; (1981–82) and &quot;The Mistress&quot; (1985 and 1987) which were scripted by Carla Lane. Later television work included &quot;The Camomile Lawn&quot; (1992), which as of 2022 it remained the most-watched drama ever on Channel 4. However, the poor reception to the 1994 sitcom &quot;Honey for Tea&quot; led Kendal to focus on stage rather than television work for some years. She co-starred with Pam Ferris on television in &quot;Rosemary &amp; Thyme&quot; (2003–2006) as one of a pair of gardeners and detectives.

Her stage career blossomed during the 1980s and 1990s when she formed a close professional association with Tom Stoppard, starring in the first productions of many of his plays, including &quot;On the Razzle&quot; (1981), &quot;The Real Thing&quot; (1982), &quot;Hapgood&quot; (1988), and &quot;Arcadia&quot; (1993). She also appeared in ten plays directed by Peter Hall, from portraying Constanze Mozart in &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1979) to Esme in &quot;Amy&#x27;s View&quot; (2006). She took her first role in a musical as Evangeline Harcourt in the 2021 London revival of &quot;Anything Goes&quot; at the Barbican Theatre. In 2023, she starred as Dotty Otley in &quot;Noises Off&quot; at the Phoenix Theatre and the Theatre Royal Haymarket. Many of her stage performances have been critically acclaimed. Kendal was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1995 New Year Honours for services to drama.

==Early life==
Felicity Ann Kendal was born in Olton, Warwickshire, England, in 1946. She is the younger daughter of Laura Liddell and actor and manager Geoffrey Kendal. Her older sister, Jennifer Kendal, was also an actress.

After early years in Birmingham, Kendal lived in India with her family from the age of seven: her father was an English actor-manager who led his own repertory company on tours of India. The ensemble would perform plays from a repertoire including Shakespeare, George Bernard Shaw, and Richard Brinsley Sheridan to audiences that included schoolchildren, nuns, British expatriates, and royalty. As the family travelled, Kendal attended six different Loreto College convent schools in India, until the age of 13. She contracted typhoid fever in Calcutta at the age of 17.

Kendal made her stage debut for her family&#x27;s company aged nine months, when she was carried on stage as the changeling boy in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Five years later she was the Changeling in the same play, and aged nine she was Macduff&#x27;s son in a production of &quot;Macbeth&quot;. Her first speaking role was as Puck in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; when she was 12.

Kendal&#x27;s family and their touring theatre company were the inspiration for the Merchant Ivory Productions film &quot;Shakespeare Wallah&quot; (1965), which follows the story of nomadic British actors as they perform Shakespeare plays in towns in post-colonial India. She played Lizzie Buckingham, the daughter of the company&#x27;s actor-managers, who falls in love with the son of film star Manjula, portrayed by Madhur Jaffrey. Lizzie&#x27;s parents face a dilemma between their deep-seated theatrical ambitions and their fears for the welfare of their daughter. &quot;The Observer&quot; film critic Kenneth Tynan wrote a positive review of the film, and considered that the role of the daughter was &quot;fetchingly played by the dumpling-faced Felicity Kendal&quot;. Patrick Gibbs of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named Kendal as his actress of the year, and said that, that based on her portrayal of Ophelia in an extract from &quot;Hamlet&quot; within the film, her performance of that role would &quot;rank with any that [he had] seen&quot;.

Speaking to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; journalist Jasper Rees in 2006, Kendal said that her time in India was &quot;sometimes very hard, sometimes very poor, sometimes ghastly, ghastly, ghastly in all sorts of ways&quot;, she did not regret it, and that it was an &quot;amazing way of living&quot;. She also felt that it prepared her for a career in theatre as she did not have any established expectations about how things should be. Aged 17, she moved to England, initially living with her aunt.

==Early television work==
Kendal appeared in two episodes of &quot;Love Story&quot; in 1966, and as a teenage hippie in &quot;The May Fly and the Frog&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; which starred John Gielgud, the same year. Her other early TV roles included parts in &quot;Man in a Suitcase&quot; (1967), &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; (1968–69), &quot;The Woodlanders&quot; (1970) and &quot;Jason King&quot; (1972).

In 1975, she appeared as Princess Vicky in &quot;Edward the Seventh&quot;. In his article about Kendal for the Museum of Broadcast Communications &quot;Encyclopedia of Television&quot;, David Pickering wrote that in the early years of Kendal&#x27;s television career, &quot;Producers liked her girlish good looks and bubbly confidence and audiences also quickly warmed to her.&quot;

==&quot;The Good Life&quot;==

Kendal had her big break on television with the BBC sitcom &quot;The Good Life&quot; which started in 1975. She and Richard Briers starred as Barbara and Tom Good, a middle-class suburban couple who decide to quit the rat race and become self-sufficient, much to the consternation of their snooty but well-meaning neighbour Margo (Penelope Keith) and her down-to-earth husband Jerry Leadbetter (Paul Eddington). Kendal appeared in all 30 episodes, which extended over four series and two specials, until 1977. BBC Head of Comedy Jimmy Gilbert, who had commissioned &quot;The Good Life&quot; as a showcase for Briers, saw Kendal and Keith perform in the play &quot;The Norman Conquests&quot; and felt they would suit the roles of Barbara and Margo. Briers approached Kendal in her dressing room and suggested that she read for the part. Kendal later recounted that she was keen to get the part, both because she needed work and because she felt a rapport with Briers, who was already established, having appeared regularly in television shows since 1962. The show&#x27;s producer John Howard Davies also went to see the play, and Kendal and Keith were both given parts. Eddington also had stage acting experience, and the show&#x27;s co-writer Bob Larbey felt that having a cast of actors, rather than a comedian as a central figure, made writing episodes easier. In her 1988 book &quot;White Cargo&quot;, Kendal reflected that the lead actors&#x27; stage experience and their attitude &quot;to be actors first and stars second&quot; was an important factor in the show&#x27;s success. She commented that from the beginning, &quot;we slotted into a way of working together that was fun, fast and furious... all extremely professional, ambitious and hard-working, and our dedication to the show was total.&quot; She also felt that Larbey and his co-writer John Esmonde tailored the scripts so that they were for the &quot;actors and characters combined&quot;.

Although Barbara has her doubts about Tom&#x27;s plans for self-sufficiency at first, she supports him emotionally and practically. The cultural historian Mark Lewisohn commented that it was obvious that Barbara and Tom &quot;enjoy a great marriage, being fully attuned to one another&#x27;s needs and desires&quot;. The British Film Institute&#x27;s page about Kendal, written by Tise Vahimagi, argues that the four lead characters were relatable, &quot;with Kendal standing out as the epitome of friendly suburban sexiness in her tight blue jeans&quot;. On the Institute&#x27;s page about &quot;The Good Life&quot;, Mark Duguid wrote that &quot;Felicity Kendal&#x27;s lively, sexy Barbara won her the adoration of millions of British men&quot; in a very popular show that was a &quot;gentle social satire of the suburban middle-class&quot;. For Pickering, Kendal&#x27;s &quot;whimsical, puckish charm and endearingly good-humoured outlook made her ideal for the role&quot;.

After a low-key start, the programme quickly became popular, attracting audiences of about 14 million for new episodes. By the last episode, Esmonde and Larbey felt that the main storylines had come to a natural end, and decided not to write further episodes. The last regular episode aired in May 1977 and was followed by a 1977 Christmas special. The cast reunited for a 1978 Royal Command Performance. It has often received repeated showings on the BBC, typically at prime viewing times, and the repeats typically attracted high audiences.

The film and television studies scholars Frances Bonner and Jason Jacobs contended that although &quot;The Good Life&quot; was consistently a reference point across the coverage later careers of each of the lead actors, this was most pronounced in the case of Kendal. Kendal has maintained that the character of Barbara Good is very dissimilar to her as a person. In a 2010 interview, she said of her close association with the character that &quot;[&quot;The Good Life&quot;] is always on some channel or another. I think it&#x27;s rather nice. It&#x27;s following me like a good fairy.&quot; She added that while the other lead characters were like people that the viewers might know personally, Barbara &quot;had all the ingredients – feisty, strong but adoring, up for anything, very funny – that people find attractive&quot;.

==Later television work==
Davies was so impressed by the performances from Kendal, Keith and Eddington that when he was Head of Comedy for the BBC, he gave them all starring roles in new series: &quot;Yes Minister&quot; for Eddington, &quot;To The Manor Born&quot; for Keith, and &quot;Solo&quot; (1981–82) for Kendal.
Carla Lane wrote &quot;Solo&quot;, in which Kendal played the lead role of Gemma Palmer, who decides to split from her boyfriend and live independently. Lane also wrote &quot;The Mistress&quot; (1985 and 1987) in which Kendal portrayed a florist having an affair with a married man, played by Jack Galloway in 1985 and with a different character played by Peter McEnery in the 1987 version. Both &quot;Solo&quot; and &quot;The Mistress&quot; were positively received, although some viewers were disappointed by the lack of innocence displayed by Kendal&#x27;s character in &quot;The Mistress&quot; compared to that of the Barbara Good character. Bonner and Jacobs commented that &quot;As Barbara, her sexiness was contained in the loving relationship with her husband, but her subsequent casting in the TV sitcoms &quot;Solo&quot; (1981–82) and &quot;The Mistress&quot; (1985–87) reveals even in their titles a making of her imaginatively available for the lustful viewer.&quot; The media scholar Mary Irwin considers that Kendal has avoided being typecast in roles of &quot;acquiescent girlfriend or supportive wife&quot;, and that in &quot;Solo&quot; and &quot;The Mistress&quot; she &quot;cut through commonplace binaries situating sitcom women as either bimbos or battleaxes&quot;.

&quot;The Camomile Lawn&quot; (1992) starred Kendal as Helena Cuthbertson, whose property encompassed a mansion and the lawn in the title. Eddington played her husband Richard. Attracting over seven million viewers, as of 2022 it remained the most-watched drama ever on Channel 4. However the 1994 sitcom &quot;Honey for Tea&quot; starring Kendal was later described by Maureen Paton of &quot;the Daily Telegraph&quot; as &quot;an unmitigated flop&quot;. Her American accent in the show was mocked by TV critic and humourist Victor Lewis-Smith: &quot;In a single phrase, she veered uncontrollably from the Bronx to South Africa via Surrey, like some linguistic Spruce Goose, awkwardly taking off only to crash-land again within moments.&quot;

Having focused on her theatre rather than her television career for some years following the poor reception to &quot;Honey for Tea&quot;, in 2003 Kendal co-starred with Pam Ferris in &quot;Rosemary &amp; Thyme&quot; as a pair of gardeners and detectives. Kendal&#x27;s character Rosemary Boxer is a University of Malmesbury lecturer in applied horticulture. The show was negatively reviewed, but still popular with viewers, becoming the most viewed new drama series on ITV1 in 2006. Vahimagi wrote that despite &quot;pleasantly skittish performances&quot; from the leads, the show was a &quot;peculiarly dispiriting addition to the list of British detective drama&quot;.

==Stage work==
Kendal auditioned unsuccessfully for Val May at the Bristol Old Vic in early 1966. Some months later, she auditioned for Tynan and Laurence Olivier National Theatre season at the Old Vic, again without success. She made her London stage debut in &quot;Minor Murder&quot; (1967) at the Savoy Theatre. Kendal and Tessa Wyatt played two friends who murdered the mother of one of them, in a play inspired by the Parker–Hulme murder case. She was cast as Amaryllis in the 1969 production of &quot;Back to Methuselah&quot; at the Old Vic.

In 1972, actors Ian McKellen and Edward Petherbridge, after discussion with director David William, formed the Actors&#x27; Company, a collective group with members invited by them. The actors would all receive equal pay and would rotate between leading and supporting roles, with posters listing their names in alphabetical order. The founding members were Caroline Blakiston, Marian Diamond, Robert Eddison, Robin Ellis, Tenniel Evans, Kendal, Matthew Long, Margery Mason, McKellen, Frank Middlemass, Juan Moreno, Petherbridge, Moira Redmond, Sheila Reid, Jack Shepherd, Ronnie Stevens and John Tordoff. As part of the company, Kendal played The Maid in &quot;Ruling the Roost&quot;, and Annabella in &quot;&#x27;Tis Pity She&#x27;s a Whore&quot; at the 1972 Edinburgh International Festival. Kendal had departed to look after her new baby by the time the group reconvened in mid-1973.

Kendal won the Variety Club&#x27;s Best Stage Actress Award for her performance as Marain in Michael Frayn&#x27;s &quot;Clouds&quot; (1978) at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre, London.

In 1979 she was directed by Peter Hall for the first time, as Constanze Mozart in &quot;Amadeus&quot;. She later recounted that her experience in the production &quot;taught me to focus on the play rather than the role&quot;. A recording with the original cast was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in 1983. Her stage career blossomed during the 1980s and 1990s when she formed a close professional association with Tom Stoppard, starring in the first productions of many of his plays, including &quot;On the Razzle&quot; (1981), &quot;The Real Thing&quot; (1982), &quot;Hapgood&quot; (1988), and &quot;Arcadia&quot; (1993). The Stoppard scholar Paul Delaney wrote in 1990 that Kendal &quot;first dazzled Stoppard audiences&quot; in &quot;On the Razzle&quot;, and made Annie in &quot;The Real Thing&quot; a &quot;poignant role&quot;. He felt that in &quot;Hapgood&quot;, Kendal gave a &quot;towering performance in the most complex role Stoppard has ever written for a woman.&quot; In his 2002 biography of Stoppard, Ira Nadel remarked that &quot;Hannah Jarvis in &quot;Arcadia&quot; is, perhaps, the quintessential Kendal role: energetic, inquisitive, strong and possessed with a touch of &quot;The Good Life&quot;&#x27;s vibrant celebration of nature.&quot;

Kendal and Stoppard started a romantic relationship that lasted for eight years from around November 1990. His radio play &quot;In the Native State&quot; (1991) had a dedication &quot;To Felicity Kendal&quot;, and, according to Delaney, it &quot;seemed in some ways to be not only for and by but also about Kendal&quot;. It was adapted for the stage as &quot;Indian Ink&quot; (1995) and both versions starred Kendal as Flora Crewe, a poet who moves to India and develops a friendship with an artist played by Art Malik who paints her portrait. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; critic Charles Spencer found Kendal&#x27;s performance by turns &quot;funny, mischievous&quot; and &quot;exceptionally touching&quot;. Stoppard also made a new translation of &quot;The Seagull&quot; by Anton Chekhov specifically so that Kendal could play Madame Arkadina (1997).

She won the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Theatre Award in 1989 for her performances in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; and &quot;Ivanov&quot;. Gerard van Werson of &quot;The Stage&quot; wrote that as Beatrice in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, Kendal &quot;delights... with her remarkable charm and her beautiful comic timing&quot;.
The critic Sheridan Morley felt that Kendal was &quot;rapidly becoming out most expert player of classic farce&quot; after seeing her in &quot;Mind Millie for Me&quot;, an adaptation of a Georges Feydeau farce at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, London in 1996. Later that year, Geoff Chapman of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; described Kendal as &quot;once a television sitcom star but now a huge West End draw in serious parts&quot;.

Her 2003 performance as Winnie in &quot;Happy Days&quot; by Samuel Beckett was acclaimed by &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Michael Billington, who praised Kendal for bringing a &quot;genuine emotional reality&quot; to the role. She starred as Esme in the West End revival of &quot;Amy&#x27;s View&quot; (2006) by David Hare, which was her tenth collaboration with director Peter Hall. Hall&#x27;s &quot;sensitive direction&quot; allowed Kendal to &quot;resoundingly [achieve] both Esme&#x27;s barbed humour and her sadness&quot; according to Heather Neil of &quot;The Stage&quot;. She appeared in the West End as Florence Lancaster in Noël Coward&#x27;s play &quot;The Vortex&quot; in 2008. In &quot;Variety&quot;, David Benedict felt that &quot;playing her as a woman who overacts strains Kendal&#x27;s ability to reveal truthful emotion in the final act&quot;.

In 2013, she starred in the first London revival of &quot;Relatively Speaking&quot; by Alan Ayckbourn at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre. Later that year, she toured the UK with Simon Callow in &quot;Chin-Chin&quot;, an English translation by Willis Hall of Francois Billetdoux&#x27;s &quot;Tchin-Tchin&quot;. She toured the UK and Australia as Judith Bliss in Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Hay Fever&quot;, which then played in the West End in 2015.

She took her first role in a musical as Evangeline Harcourt in the 2021 London revival of &quot;Anything Goes&quot; at the Barbican Theatre. In 2023, Kendal starred as Dotty Otley in &quot;Noises Off&quot; at the Phoenix Theatre and the Theatre Royal Haymarket. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reviewer Marianka Swain felt that Kendal was &quot;more brilliant than ever&quot; in the role.

==Other work==
On the album &quot;Shape Up and Dance with Felicity Kendal&quot; (1982), Kendal narrated a keep-fit routine based around yoga and ballet. It spent 13 weeks in the top 40 of the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number 29 in 1983, and went on to sell over 200,000 copies.

In 1995, Kendal was one of the readers of Edward Lear poems on a spoken-word CD bringing together a collection of Lear&#x27;s nonsense songs.

==Personal life==
Kendal&#x27;s first marriage to Drewe Henley (1968–1979) and her second to Michael Rudman (1983–1991) ended in divorce. Kendal has two sons: Charley from her marriage to Henley and Jacob from her marriage to Rudman. She reunited with Rudman in 1998, and they remained partners until he died on 30 March 2023.

Kendal was brought up in the Catholic faith. She converted to Judaism at the time of her second marriage, but has said about the conversion, &quot;I felt I was returning to my roots.&quot; Her conversion took more than three years; she has stated that her decision to convert had &quot;nothing to do&quot; with her husband. Kendal&#x27;s memoirs, titled &quot;White Cargo&quot;, were published in 1998.

In 1981, Kendal was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1995 New Year Honours for services to drama. She is an ambassador for the charity Royal Voluntary Service, previously known as WRVS.

<text>The Day of Reconciliation is a public holiday in South Africa held annually on 16 December. The holiday came into effect in 1995 after the end of apartheid, with the intention of fostering reconciliation and national unity for the country. Recognising the need for racial harmony, the government chose the date for its significance to both Afrikaner and indigenous South African cultures. The celebration of the Day of Reconciliation can take the form of remembering past history, recognising veteran&#x27;s contributions, marching, and other festivities.

The origins of the celebration for Afrikaners goes back to the Day of the Vow, which commemorates the Voortrekker victory over the Zulus at the Battle of Blood River on 16 December 1838. For black and indigenous South Africans, the date marks both peaceful protests against racial injustice and the founding of the Umkhonto we Sizwe paramilitary wing of the African National Congress (ANC) on 16 December 1961. Nelson Mandela and the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission chose a day that was special to both ethno-racial groups in the country in order to work on healing the damage done by apartheid.

==Date and observance==
The first time the Day of Reconciliation was celebrated as a public holiday was in 1995. The new government chose to represent national unity by choosing a date that had significance for &quot;both the Afrikaner and liberation struggle traditions&quot;.

On Day of Reconciliation, cultural groups participate in parades and various festivities take place throughout the country. On Day of Reconciliation 2013, a statue of Nelson Mandela, the first black president of South Africa, was unveiled at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. During the celebration in 2009, President Jacob Zuma honored forgotten heroes of South Africa, including inscribing around 100 dead veteran&#x27;s names on the Wall of Names at Freedom Park. In 2008, the first victim of &quot;necklacing&quot;, Maki Skosana, was given a tombstone and remembered. For the celebration in 2001, the African National Congress (ANC) remembered the police raid that led to the Rivonia trial. Some of the communities take part in a walk which also serve as a memorial to Mandela. Other parts of South Africa have chosen to emphasize their need for racial harmony in their communities.

Each year has had a different theme. For example:
* 2013: Nation Building, Social Cohesion, and Reconciliation.
* 2014: Social Cohesion, Reconciliation, and National Unity in the 20 Years of Democracy.
* 2015: Bridging the Divide: Building a common South African nationhood towards a national development state.
*2016: Bridging The Divide Towards A Non-Racist Society.
*2017: The Year of OR Tambo: Reconciliation through Radical Socio-Economic Transformation.
*2018: The Year of Nelson Mandela and Albertina Sisulu: Liberators for Reconciliation.
*2019: The Year of Indigenous Languages: Supporting National Reconciliation Through the Promotion, Development and Preservation of Indigenous Languages.
*2020: United In Action Against Racism, Gender-based Violence and Other Intolerances.
*2021: The year of Charlotte Maxeke: Promoting Reconciliation During the 25th Anniversary of the Constitution
*2022: National Unity, Healing, and Renewal

== Origin ==
=== Afrikaner origins ===
For Afrikaners, 16 December was commemorated as the Day of the Vow, also known as Day of the Covenant or &quot;Dingaansdag&quot; (Dingaan&#x27;s Day). The Day of the Vow was a religious holiday commemorating the Voortrekker victory over the Zulus at the Battle of Blood River in 1838, and is still celebrated by some Afrikaners. On that day, 470 Voortrekkers were attacked in an early morning battle led by Dingane&#x27;s generals. The Voortrekkers defeated the Zulus who numbered in the tens of thousands and during the battle, 3,000 Zulu warriors were killed. The event became a &quot;rallying point for the development of Afrikaner nationalism, culture and identity.&quot;

The religious significance of the event, where it is called Day of the Covenant or Day of the Vow, involves the belief that the Voortrekker victory of the Zulus was ordained by God. The General Synod of the Afrikaners&#x27; Natal Churches chose 16 December as &quot;an ecclesiastical day of thanksgiving by all its congregations&quot; in 1864. Later, in 1894, Dingane&#x27;s Day was declared a public holiday by the Government of the Orange Free State.

During the Apartheid era, 16 December continued to be celebrated as the Day of the Vow and the Day of the Covenant. In 1952, Dingane&#x27;s Day was changed to Day of the Covenant and in 1980 was changed to The Day of the Vow. The Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria was erected on 16 December 1949 to commemorate Dingane&#x27;s Day.

The last year South Africa celebrated Day of the Vow was in 1994. The transition from Day of the Vow to Day of Reconciliation was viewed with mixed emotions for Afrikaners.

=== African origins ===

Black and indigenous South Africans who did not have the right to vote after the South African War, protested racial discrimination on 16 December 1910. Other protests against the government handling of racial discrimination continued to be held on 16 December. In 1929, 1930 and 1934, anti-pass demonstrations were held by the Communist Party of South Africa (CPSA) on that day. The All African Convention (AAC) was held during the same time in 1935, covering dates 15 December through 18 December.

Much later, when efforts of passive protest and resistance against apartheid had been unsuccessful, the African National Congress (ANC) decided to form a military or armed group. The decision to move to armed resistance happened after the ANC was banned by the government. Nelson Mandela believed that non-violent resistance was not working to stop Apartheid, and advocated acts of sabotage. The date of 16 December is the anniversary of the 1961 founding of Umkhonto we Sizwe (&quot;Spear of the Nation&quot; or MK), the armed wing of the ANC. On that day, Umkhonto we Sizwe enacted its &quot;first acts of sabotage&quot; which included bomb blasts against government buildings in Johannesburg, Port Elizabeth and Durban. Also on 16 December 1961, the Umkhonto we Sizwe distributed leaflets describing how the group &quot;will carry on the struggle for freedom and democracy by new methods, which are necessary to complement the actions of the established national liberation organisations.&quot;

=== Day of Reconciliation ===

When Apartheid ended, it was decided to keep 16 December as a public holiday, but to infuse it &quot;with the purpose of fostering reconciliation and national unity.&quot; It was established by the government in 1994. Nelson Mandela was part of the group of politicians that helped start the idea for the holiday. On 16 December 1995, the first celebration took place. The first meeting of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission also took place on 16 December 1995. In an address in 1995, Archbishop Desmond Tutu described the holiday as serving the need of healing the wounds of Apartheid.

The holiday is also used to celebrate minority cultural groups in South Africa, such as the San people. South African President, Jacob Zuma, in 2009, also stressed that the holiday was meant to also promote &quot;non-sexism&quot;.

=== Other significance ===
It is the first of four public holidays observed at the height of the Southern Hemisphere summer, along with Christmas Day, Day of Goodwill and New Year&#x27;s Day. Many small businesses close down and employees go on leave over this period.

<doc id="160040" wikidata="Q313675" url="?curid=160040" title="Hiero II of Syracuse">
<text>Hiero II (; also Hieron ; ; c. 308 BC – 215 BC) was the Greek tyrant of Syracuse, Greek Sicily, from 275 to 215 BC, and the illegitimate son of a Syracusan noble, Hierocles, who claimed descent from Gelon. He was a former general of Pyrrhus of Epirus and an important figure of the First Punic War. He figures in the story of famed thinker Archimedes shouting &quot;Eureka&quot;.

==Rise to power==

When Pyrrhus left Sicily (275 BC) the Syracusan army and citizens appointed Hiero commander-in-chief. He strengthened his position by marrying the daughter of Leptines, one of the leading citizen of Syracuse. In the meantime, the Mamertines, a body of mercenaries from Campania who had been employed by Agathocles the late tyrant of Syracuse, had seized the stronghold of Messina, and proceeded in harassing the Greeks around them. They were finally defeated in a pitched battle near Mylae along the Longanus river by Hiero, who was only prevented from capturing Messina by Carthaginian interference. His grateful countrymen then made him king (275) but unlike the past kings or tyrants of Syracuse he ruled within the law and ruled with the assemblies of Syracuse and never purged his opponents.

==First Punic War==
In 264 BC he returned and attacked the Mamertines again. The Mamertines became desperate and called in the aid of Rome. Hiero at once joined the Punic leader Hanno, who had recently landed in Sicily; but fighting a battle to an inconclusive outcome with the Romans led by the consul Appius Claudius Caudex, he withdrew to Syracuse.

Pressed by the Roman forces, in 263 he concluded a treaty with Rome, by which he was to rule over the south-east of Sicily and the eastern coast as far as Tauromenium.

==After the Punic War==
From this time until his death in 215 BC he remained loyal to the Romans, and frequently assisted them with men and provisions during the Punic war. He kept up a powerful fleet for defensive purposes, and employed his famous kinsman Archimedes in the construction of those engines that, at a later date, played so important a part during the siege of Syracuse by the Romans.

==Connection to the &quot;eureka&quot; story==
According to a story told by Vitruvius, Hiero suspected he was being cheated by the goldsmith to whom he had supplied the gold to make a votive crown for a temple. He asked Archimedes to find out if all the gold had been used, as had been agreed. Archimedes, on discovering the principle of displacement needed to measure the density of the crown is said to have shouted &quot;eureka, eureka!&quot; while running naked through Syracuse. Supposedly, it was while noticing the rise in water level when getting a bath tub that Archimedes realized he could use water-displacement to measure the crown&#x27;s irregular shape, and in his excitement about the discovery he dashed outside cheering and forgot to dress himself first. Vitruvius concludes this story by stating that Archimedes&#x27; method successfully detected the goldsmith&#x27;s fraud; the smith had indeed taken some of the gold and substituted silver instead.

==Legacy and honors==
A picture of the prosperity of Syracuse during his rule is given in the sixteenth idyll of Theocritus. During the reign of Hieron II, various forms of architectural decoration were introduced in Sicily, which are summarised as ‘Hieronic architecture’. Contrary to some assumptions in scholarship, however, there is no evidence that these stylistic innovations were the result of a central programme on Hieron&#x27;s part to legitimise his rule.

In the 16th century treatise &quot;The Prince&quot; (Chapter 6), Machiavelli cites Hiero as an exceptionally virtuous man and a rare example of someone who rose to princely power from previously being a private individual, comparing him to Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus.

<text>High Fidelity is a novel by British author Nick Hornby first published in 1995. It has sold over a million copies and was later adapted into a feature film in 2000, a Broadway musical in 2006 and a TV series in 2020. In 2003, the novel was listed on the BBC&#x27;s survey The Big Read.

==Plot summary==
Rob Fleming is a 35-year-old man who owns a record shop in London called Championship Vinyl. His lawyer girlfriend, Laura, has just left him and now he&#x27;s going through a crisis. At his record shop, Rob and his employees, Dick and Barry, spend their free moments discussing mix-tape aesthetics and constructing desert-island &quot;top-five&quot; lists of anything that demonstrates their knowledge of music, movies, and pop culture. Rob uses this exercise to create his own list: &quot;The top five most memorable split-ups.&quot; This list includes the following ex-girlfriends: 1) Alison Ashworth, 2) Penny Hardwick, 3) Jackie Allen, 4) Charlie Nicholson, and 5) Sarah Kendrew.

Rob, recalling these breakups, sets about getting in touch with the former girlfriends. Eventually, Rob&#x27;s re-examination of his failed relationships, a one-time stand with an American musician named Marie LaSalle, and the death of Laura&#x27;s father bring the two back together. Their relationship is cemented by the launch of a new purposefulness to Rob&#x27;s life in the revival of his disc jockey career.

Also, realizing that his fear of commitment (a result of his fear of death of those around him) and his tendency to act on emotion are responsible for his continuing desires to pursue new women, Rob makes a token commitment to Laura.

<text>High Fidelity is a 2000 romantic comedy-drama film directed by Stephen Frears, starring John Cusack, Jack Black, and Iben Hjejle. The film is based on the 1995 British novel of the same name by Nick Hornby, with the setting moved from London to Chicago and the protagonist&#x27;s name changed. Hornby expressed surprise at how faithful the adaptation was, saying &quot;at times, it appears to be a film in which John Cusack reads my book.&quot;

Following a breakup with his most recent girlfriend, Rob Gordon recounts his most painful breakups, seeking to find a reason for his failed romances. The film is styled around Rob talking to the camera and narrating his own story.

Cusack was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.

==Plot==
Rob Gordon is a music enthusiast with limited understanding of women. After being abruptly dumped by Laura, a lawyer and his live-in girlfriend of two years, he is left despondent. 

By day, Rob manages Championship Vinyl, a record store where he and his employees, Dick and Barry, indulge in their encyclopedic musical knowledge. They compile &quot;Top 5&quot; lists for every imaginable occasion, mock their few customers&#x27; tastes, and rarely sell records; Laura&#x27;s breakup cracks Rob&#x27;s Top 5 list of the worst breakups he&#x27;s ever had. 

While serious, his relationship with Laura was rocky, as he often had to ask for money, and at one point he slept with another woman while she was pregnant without his knowledge, prompting her to abort the baby secretly while they reconciled. After she tells her friend Liz this, and his mother calls him out on his doomed relationships, Rob decides on a journey to understand his relationship failures by reconnecting with his other former partners on the Top 5 list. 

Number 1 is Allison, a girl he kissed in middle school, only for her to kiss a different boy a few hours later. Rob discovers she went on to marry the other boy, convincing him they were meant to be together. 

Number 2 is Penny Hardwick, his high school girlfriend who he dumped after she routinely refused to be intimate with him, only to sleep with another guy shortly afterward. He meets with the now movie critic over a movie and dinner, only to discover that the sexual encounter was a post-breakup fling; Penny tells him off, but Rob takes solace in knowing it was his own insecurity that caused the breakup. 

Number 3 is a trendy girl named Charlie Nicholson and his most serious relationship. Rob felt insecure around her and eventually got dumped for someone in her league, which sent him into a deep depression. He learns that she has sworn off men in favor of a career; when they meet at a party, he realizes she is vain and elitist, allowing him to move on. 

Finally, Rob meets with Number 4, Sarah Kendrew, whom he shared a post-breakup relationship with after Charlie, only for her to meet another man. Reuniting with her, he discovers that she is mentally unwell and thus routinely sabotages her relationships, so he drops the subject out of pity. 

Teen skateboarders Vince and Justin, frequently cause trouble in the store until Rob discovers their music project, The Kinky Wizards. Impressed by their recording, he offers them a record deal under his newly founded label, Top 5 Records. 

In his personal life, Rob continues to long for Laura, who is living with Ian, a man he initially does not recognize. However, after finding a letter addressed to &quot;I. Raymond,&quot; Rob realizes he is their former upstairs lifestyle guru neighbor, nicknamed &quot;Ray&quot;, known for keeping them awake with his frequent sexual encounters, which they used to jokingly discuss. This makes him extremely insecure, and he resorts to stalking until Ian confronts him. 

Rob&#x27;s relationship with Laura takes a pivotal turn when her father, who was fond of Rob, dies. Attending the funeral, Rob realizes he has never truly committed to Laura, neglecting both their relationship and his own future in the process. This self-awareness prompts the couple to move back in together.

Rob then meets a music columnist and develops a crush on her. While making a mixtape for her, he wonders whether he is simply jumping from one attraction to another. In a heartfelt conversation with Laura, Rob acknowledges that other women are mere fantasies, while Laura is his reality, someone he never tires of. He proposes to her, and although she thanks him for asking, she encourages him to revisit his passion for DJing.

At a celebration for the release of Vince and Justin&#x27;s single, organized by Laura, Rob is pleasantly surprised by the performance of Barry&#x27;s band. He also breathes a sigh of relief when Barry opts against naming the band &quot;Sonic Death Monkey&quot; or &quot;Kathleen Turner Overdrive,&quot; choosing instead &quot;Barry Jive and the Uptown Five.&quot; Finally, Rob creates a mixtape for Laura, confident that he has finally learned how to make her happy.

==Production==

===Development===
Nick Hornby&#x27;s book was optioned by Disney&#x27;s Touchstone Pictures in 1995, where it went into development for three years. Mike Newell was slated to direct the film with a script written by &quot;Con Air&quot; screenwriter Scott Rosenberg. Disney executive Joe Roth had a conversation with recording executive Kathy Nelson, who recommended John Cusack and his writing and producing partners D. V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink adapt the book. She had previously worked with them on &quot;Grosse Pointe Blank&quot; and felt that they had the right sensibilities for the material. According to Cusack, DeVincentis is the closest to the record-obsessive characters in the film, owning 1,000 vinyl records and thousands of CDs and tapes. They wrote a treatment that was immediately greenlit by Roth.

===Screenplay===
The writers decided to change the book&#x27;s setting from London to Chicago because they were more familiar with the city, and it also had a &quot;great alternative music scene&quot;, according to Pink. Cusack said, &quot;When I read the book I knew where everything was in Chicago. I knew where the American Rob went to school and dropped out, where he used to spin records. I knew two or three different record shops when I was growing up that had a Rob, a Dick and a Barry in them&quot;. Charlotte Tudor, of the film&#x27;s distributor, Buena Vista, said: &quot;Chicago has the same feel as north London, there is a vibrant music scene, a lot of the action is set in smoky bars and, of course, there is the climate. But everyone, including Nick, felt that geography was not the central issue. It has a universal appeal&quot;. Scenes were filmed in the neighborhood of Wicker Park, and on the campus of Lane Tech High School.

Cusack found that the greatest challenge adapting the novel was pulling off Rob Gordon&#x27;s frequent breaking of the fourth wall and talking directly to the audience. The screenwriters did this to convey Rob&#x27;s inner confessional thoughts, and were influenced by a similar technique in the Michael Caine film &quot;Alfie&quot;. Cusack rejected this approach because he thought that &quot;there&#x27;d just be too much of me.&quot; Once Newell dropped out as director and remains on as executive producer and Stephen Frears signed on to replace him as director, he suggested using the technique and everyone agreed.

Cusack and the writers floated the idea that Rob could have a conversation with Bruce Springsteen in his head, inspired by a reference in Hornby&#x27;s book where the narrator wishes he could handle his past girlfriends as well as Springsteen does in his song &quot;Bobby Jean&quot; on &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; They never believed they would actually get the musician to appear in the film, but thought putting him in the script would make the studio excited about it. Cusack knew Springsteen socially, and called the musician up and pitched the idea. Springsteen asked for a copy of the script and subsequently agreed to do it.

Near the film&#x27;s completion, it was revealed that Scott Rosenberg would share screenplay credit with Cusack, DeVincentis &amp; Pink. Rosenberg&#x27;s original draft took place in Boston and was drastically different from Hornby&#x27;s book and the writing team&#x27;s adaptation. The three reached out to Rosenberg who agreed to take his name off the credits. However, Rosenberg eventually refused to do so, leading to a writing credit dispute. According to Pink, Rosenberg was given credit due to a now-abolished rule in the WGA which gave full credit to the first screenwriter attached to any adaptation for &quot;anything they extracted from the book, or from the material from which they were adapting.&quot;

===Casting===
Frears was at the Berlin International Film Festival and seeing &quot;Mifune&#x27;s Last Song&quot;, starring Iben Hjejle, realized that he had found the female lead. Frears read Hornby&#x27;s book and enjoyed it, but did not connect with the material because it was not about his generation. He accepted the job because he wanted to work with Cusack again (after teaming on &quot;The Grifters&quot;) and liked the idea of changing the setting from London to Chicago. The director was also responsible for insisting on keeping Jack Black in the part of Barry. Black never auditioned and had initially passed on the part until Frears convinced him to take the role. Frears has said that many people from the studio came to watch his rushes. The role of Dick was originally offered to David Arquette, and Artie Lange auditioned for Barry. Todd Louiso was cast as Dick after Arquette passed on the offer. Liz Phair was also considered for the character Marie DeSalle, before Lisa Bonet was cast.

===Filming===
Production began on April 26, 1999 in Chicago, Illinois. Filming also took place on location at Wicker Park and the Biograph Theater, as well as authentic music venues.

==Release==
&quot;High Fidelity&quot; premiered at the El Capitan Theater in Hollywood. The post-party was held at the Sunset Room, where Tenacious D performed. The film was opened in a wide release in the United States on March 31, 2000, grossing $6.4 million during its opening weekend and finishing in fifth place at the US box office. It opened July 21, 2000 in the United Kingdom on 227 screens and grossed $1.1 million, finishing fourth for the weekend. It went on to gross $47.1 million worldwide, of which $27.3 million was from the US and Canada. 
==Reception==
&quot;High Fidelity&quot; received positive reviews from critics at 91% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 165 reviews, with an average rating of 7.60/10. The critical consensus states: &quot;The deft hand of director Stephen Frears and strong performances by the ensemble cast combine to tell an entertaining story with a rock-solid soundtrack.&quot; The film has a score of 79 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 35 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four and wrote, &quot;Watching &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, I had the feeling I could walk out of the theater and meet the same people on the street — and want to, which is an even higher compliment.&quot; In his review for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, Desson Howe praised Jack Black as &quot;a bundle of verbally ferocious energy. Frankly, whenever he&#x27;s in the scene, he shoplifts this movie from Cusack.&quot; In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden praised Cusack&#x27;s performance, writing, &quot;a master at projecting easygoing camaraderie, he navigates the transitions with such an astonishing naturalness and fluency that you&#x27;re almost unaware of them.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; did not give the film a positive review: &quot;Let&#x27;s be kind and just say &quot;High Fidelity&quot; doesn&#x27;t quite belong beside &quot;Grosse Pointe Blank&quot; and &quot;The Sure Thing&quot; in Cusack&#x27;s greatest hits collection. It&#x27;s not that he isn&#x27;t good. More like miscast.&quot; In his review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Owen Gleiberman gave the film a &quot;B−&quot; rating and wrote, &quot;In &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, Rob&#x27;s music fixation is a signpost of his arrested adolescence; he needs to get past records to find true love. If the movie had had a richer romantic spirit, he might have embraced both in one swooning gesture.&quot;

Peter Travers, in his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, wrote, &quot;It hits all the laugh bases, from grins to guffaws. Cusack and his Chicago friends—D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink—have rewritten Scott Rosenberg&#x27;s script to catch Hornby&#x27;s spirit without losing the sick comic twists they gave 1997&#x27;s &quot;Grosse Pointe Blank&quot;.&quot; In his review for &quot;The Observer&quot;, Philip French wrote, &quot;&quot;High Fidelity&quot; is an extraordinarily funny film, full of verbal and visual wit. And it is assembled with immense skill.&quot; Stephanie Zacharek, in her review for &quot;Salon.com&quot;, praised Iben Hjejle&#x27;s performance: &quot;Hjejle&#x27;s Laura is supremely likable: She&#x27;s so matter-of-fact and grounded that it&#x27;s perfectly clear why she&#x27;d become exasperated with a guy like Rob, who perpetually refuses to grow up, but you can also see how her patience and calm are exactly the things he needs.&quot;

===Legacy===
&quot;Empire&quot; magazine readers voted &quot;High Fidelity&quot; the 446th greatest film in their &quot;500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot; poll. It is also ranked #14 on Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; 25 Best Romantic Comedies. In its June 2010 issue, &quot;Chicago&quot; magazine rated it #1 in a list of the top 40 movies ever filmed in Chicago.

Alternative singer-songwriter Regina Spektor was watching the movie when she wrote her 2006 song &quot;Fidelity&quot;, which marked her first entry into the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. That same year a musical stage adaptation premiered on Broadway and ran for 13 performances. In 2010, Tanya Morgan member Donwill released the solo album &quot;Don Cusack In High Fidelity&quot;, which he recorded from the perspective of the film&#x27;s character.

==Television series==
In April 2018, ABC Signature Studios announced that it was developing a television series adaptation of &quot;High Fidelity&quot; with Midnight Radio (Scott Rosenberg, Jeff Pinkner, Josh Appelbaum, and Andre Nemec). Rosenberg would return to script the series, which features a female lead in the Cusack role. The series was adapted by Veronica West and Sarah Kucserka. In late September 2018, Zoë Kravitz, Lisa Bonet&#x27;s daughter, was cast as the lead. The first season consists of ten episodes.

Originally announced for Disney&#x27;s then-upcoming streaming service Disney+, it was reported in April 2019 that the series had been shifted to Hulu. Disney+&#x27;s SVP of content Agnes Chu stated that the series had &quot;evolved&quot; in a direction that was better-suited for Hulu.

On October 30, 2019, it was announced that the series would premiere on February 14, 2020. In August 2020, the series was canceled, after one season.

<text>Aetolia () is a mountainous region of Greece on the north coast of the Gulf of Corinth, forming the eastern part of the modern regional unit of Aetolia-Acarnania.

==Geography==
The Achelous River separates Aetolia from Acarnania to the west; on the north it had boundaries with Epirus and Thessaly; on the east with the Ozolian Locrians; and on the south the entrance to the Corinthian Gulf defined the limits of Aetolia.

In classical times Aetolia comprised two parts: &quot;Old Aetolia&quot; () in the west, from the Achelous to the Evenus and Calydon; and &quot;New Aetolia&quot; () or &quot;Acquired Aetolia&quot; () in the east, from the Evenus and Calydon to the Ozolian Locrians. The country has a level and fruitful coastal region, but an unproductive and mountainous interior. The mountains contained many wild beasts, and acquired fame in Greek mythology as the scene of the hunt for the Calydonian Boar, also called the Aetolian Boar.

==History==

===Ancient era===

Tribes known as Curetes – named after the nearby mountain Kourion, or just to stand out from the Acarnanians, who were called so because they were unshorn – and Leleges originally inhabited the country, but at an early period Greeks from Elis, led by the mythical eponym Aetolus, set up colonies. Dionysius of Halicarnassus mentions that Curetes was the old name of the Aetolians and Leleges the old name of the Locrians. The Aetolians took part in the Trojan War, under their king Thoas.

The mountain tribes of Aetolia were the Ophioneis, the Apodotoi, the Agraeis, the Aperantoi and the Eurytanians.

The primitive lifestyle of those tribes made an impression on ancient historians. Polybius doubted their Greek heritage, while Livy reports that they spoke a language similar to the Macedonians. On the other hand, Thucydides claims that Eurytanians spoke a very difficult language and ate their food completely raw. They were semi-barbaric, warlike and predatory. They worshiped Apollo as god of tame nature and Artemis as goddess of wilderness. They also worshiped Athena, not as goddess of wisdom, but emphasizing the element of war – i.e. a goddess that was a counterbalance to the god Ares. They called Apollo and Artemis &quot;Laphrios gods,&quot; i.e. patrons of the spoils and loot of war. In addition, they worshiped Hercules, the river Achelous and Bacchus. In Thermos, an area north of Trichonis lake, there was after the 7th century a shrine of Apollo “Thermios,” which became a significant religious center during the time of the Aetolian League.

The Aetolians refused to participate in the Persian Wars. In 426 BC, led by Aegitios, they defeated the Athenians and their allies, who had turned against Apodotia and Ophioneia under the general command of Demosthenes. However, they failed to regain Naupaktos, which had meanwhile been conquered by the Corinthians with the aid of the Athenians. At the end of the Archidamian War, the Aetolians took part as mercenaries of the Athenians in the expedition against Syracuse. Then the Achaeans occupied Calydon, but the Aetolians recovered it in 361 BC. In 338 BC, Naupaktos was again taken by the Aetolians, with the help of Philip II. During the Lamian War, the Aetolians helped the Athenian general Leosthenes defeat Antipater. As a result, they came into conflict with Antipater and Craterus, taking great risks, but were eventually saved by the disagreement between the two Macedonian generals and Perdiccas. The Acarnanians then attempted to invade their land, but the Aetolians were able to force them to flee.

The Aetolians set up a united league, the Aetolian League, in early times. It soon became a powerful confederation (&quot;sympoliteia&quot;) and by c. 340 BC it became one of the leading military powers in ancient Greece. It had originally been organized during the reign of Philip II by the cities of Aetolia for their mutual benefit and protection and became a formidable rival to the Macedonian monarchs and the Achaean League.

The great courage shown by the Aetolians during the fighting against the Macedonians increased their glamour and fame, especially after winning the last Amphictyonic war and even more after repulsing the Gallic invasion under Brennus and rescuing the sanctuary of Delphi. Subsequently, the Sotiria Games were established by the Aetolians, in honour of Zeus the Saviour.

In 232 BC, the Illyrians under Agron attacked the Aetolians, and managed to take many prisoners and booty.

In 229 BC, the Aetolians participated in a naval battle off the island of Paxos in a coalition with Korkyra and the Achaean League, and were defeated by a coalition of Illyrians and Acarnanians; as a result, the Korkyreans were forced to accept an Illyrian garrison in their city, which was put under the command of Demetrius of Pharos.

The Aetolians’ power increasingly magnified with the occupation of the lands of Ozoloi, Locrians and Phocians, as well as Boeotia. They then united under the power of their League in the areas of Tegea, Mantinea, Orchomenus, Psophida and Phigaleia. Between 220 and 217 BC, the Social War broke out between the Achaean and Aetolian Leagues. The war was first started by the Aetolians with the help of the Spartans and Eleans. Allies of the Achaeans were the Macedonians, the Boeotians, the Phocians, the Epirotes, the Acarnanians and the Messenians. 

The Aetolians allied with the Romans, while Philip V destroyed the temple of Apollo Thermios and allied with the Carthaginians. The Aetolians continued to fight on the side of the Romans even in the Battle of Cynoscephalae (196 BC), ignoring the great dangers looming for Greece as a result of this alliance. The Aetolians took the side of Antiochus III against the Roman Republic, and on the defeat of that monarch in 189 BC, they became virtually the subjects of Rome. Following the conquest of the Achaeans by Lucius Mummius Achaicus in 146 BC, Aetolia became part of the Roman province of Achaea. When the Roman garrisons were withdrawn because of the civil wars in Rome, the Aetolians, too, began to fight each other. Following Octavius’ victory at the Battle of Actium, the Aetolians who had sided with Antony disbanded completely. Octavius handed Calydon over to the Achaeans, who devastated it entirely and moved the statue of Artemis Laphria to Patras. There were subsequent invasions by Goths, Huns, and Vandals several centuries later at the end of the Roman Empire.

Aetolia&#x27;s reputation has suffered from a rather hostile treatment in the sources. Polybius is considered now to have a heavy anti-Aetolian bias due to his having relied on Aetolia&#x27;s opponent Aratus of Achaea, but mainly because of his origin in Megalopolis, a major centre of the rival Achaean League.

===Middle Ages===
During the Middle Ages, Aetolia was part of the Byzantine Empire and later passed to the Turks. Aetolia was mentioned in Francisco Baltazar&#x27;s Florante at Laura.

<text>Powerman 5000 (also known as PM5K) is an American rock band formed in 1991. The group has released eleven studio albums, gaining its highest level of commercial success with 1999&#x27;s &quot;Tonight the Stars Revolt!&quot;, which reached number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 while spawning the singles &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; and &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Real&quot;. Frontman Spider One, younger brother of fellow metal musician Rob Zombie, has been the only consistent member of the lineup since the band&#x27;s formation.

==Biography==

===Early years and breakthrough (1991–2002)===
In 1990, Spider One recorded the 12&quot; single &quot;Much Evil&quot; with producer Lamar Lowder. Building on local success, including winning the Boston Phoenix/WFNX 1990 Readers&#x27; Poll &quot;Best Rap Act&quot; category and getting nominated for a Boston Music Award, he founded Powerman 5000 in 1991. Drummer Al Pahanish Jr., bassist Dorian Heartsong, guitarist Adam 12, and percussionist Jordan Cohen joined in 1991 to solidify the early lineup (a turntablist, Brian Collymoore, was also briefly a member until 1993). In 1993, the band released an independent EP titled &quot;A Private Little War&quot;, which was limited to 500 copies and only sold at shows. In 1994 and 1995, Powerman 5000 released two more independent records, the &quot;True Force&quot; EP and the full-length album &quot;The Blood-Splat Rating System&quot;. Both albums were local successes. In 1996, they performed on the second stage of Ozzfest and appeared in an episode of &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, where David and Donna filmed a music video for their song &quot;Strike the Match&quot;.

In 1996, the band signed to DreamWorks Records and released a remastered edition of &quot;The Blood-Splat Rating System&quot; titled &quot;Mega!! Kung Fu Radio&quot;. The band toured, performing on the main stage at Ozzfest 1997 and making an appearance on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; where they performed their song &quot;Neckbone&quot;. They released singles such as &quot;Tokyo Vigilante #1&quot; in 1997 and &quot;Organizized&quot; in 1998. By the end of 1997, Cohen departed from the band to eventually join Blue Man Group. His percussionist position was not replaced; however, the band instead added a second guitarist to the lineup when M.33 (Mike Tempesta) joined the band in 1998.

Creating a strange fusion of science fiction and &quot;Action Rock&quot;, Powerman 5000 released &quot;Tonight the Stars Revolt!&quot;, produced by Sylvia Massy, which contained the hit singles &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot;, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Real&quot;, and &quot;Supernova Goes Pop&quot;. The album sold over a million copies, achieved platinum status and won a nomination from the Boston Music Awards for &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, becoming the group&#x27;s most successful release. The band was also nominated by the Boston Music Awards for &quot;Best Rock Band&quot; and won the &quot;Rising Star Award&quot;. The band would go on to tour worldwide, performing in shows and festivals such as &quot;Farmclub.com&quot; and &quot;Endfest&quot; and become a support act for Metallica&#x27;s Summer Sanitarium Tour along with Korn, Kid Rock and System of a Down.

A follow-up album to &quot;Tonight the Stars Revolt!&quot; was recorded in 2001 titled &quot;Anyone for Doomsday?&quot;, and a single, &quot;Bombshell&quot;, had been released to radio stations. But the album was canceled just before its scheduled release. &quot;Anyone for Doomsday?&quot; was later released under Spider&#x27;s own new label, Megatronic Records, but went out of print due to legal issues. Arguments exist as to whether the record was canceled due to the events of the September 11 terrorist attacks and the negative title, but the album was finished and scheduled to be released in August 2001, one full month before the attacks. Spider has said in interviews that the album was dropped because it sounded too much like the previous album and that he wanted to release something fresh and different instead of repeating himself. Conflicts thereafter caused longtime members Dorian 27 (Dorian Heartsong) and AL3 (Allan Pahanish Jr) to leave the band. Ad7 (Adrian Ost) and Siggy Sjursen were brought in to replace them.

The band gained significant mainstream exposure with its original remake of the 1980s club hit &quot;Relax&quot;, originally by Frankie Goes To Hollywood. Rapper Danny Boy guested, and the track was featured prominently during the end credits roll for the 2001 comedy film &quot;Zoolander&quot;, helping to widen the band&#x27;s appeal.

=== &quot;Transform&quot; and &quot;Destroy What You Enjoy&quot; (2003–2007) ===

In 2003, the band released &quot;Transform&quot;, a more punk-fueled album, completely dropping the costumes that had been featured throughout the band&#x27;s &quot;Tonight The Stars Revolt!&quot; era. Containing the hit singles &quot;Free&quot; and &quot;Action&quot;, &quot;Transform&quot; relied less on industrial metal effects. After the album&#x27;s release, the band began touring in the U.S., performing in shows such as X-Fest and making live appearances on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; where they performed their song &quot;Action&quot;, and &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; where they performed their song &quot;Free&quot; respectively. However, DreamWorks Records was bought out by Interscope Records, which stopped promoting the band and declined to take over their DreamWorks contract. Undeterred, Spider continued with his own offshoot label, Megatronic Records. In 2004, new music was released, under Spider&#x27;s new label, in the form of a rarities album titled &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Vol. 1&quot;.

A new tour was also started, but M.33 had been kicked out of the band for starting fights and Adam 12 left the band on good terms to focus on other interests including sound producing and recording with Argon 40. Former Alien Ant Farm guitarist Terry Corso and former Halfcocked (the first band on Spider&#x27;s label) guitarist Johnny Rock Heatley were brought in to round out the live show. In August 2005, Powerman 5000 performed at the sixth annual Gathering of the Juggalos on the main stage. The band then signed to DRT Entertainment, who released the album entitled &quot;Destroy What You Enjoy&quot; on August 1, 2006. The song &quot;Wild World&quot; was the first and only single on the album, with the band also filming a music video for the song. The band would go on to tour through the U.S., including a live appearance on G4tv&#x27;s Attack of the Show!, where they performed the song &quot;Return to the City of the Dead&quot; from &quot;Destroy What You Enjoy&quot;.

In 2007, Evan Rodaniche, singer and guitarist of Los Angeles band Cage9 (originally from Panama City, Panama), joined the band through his acquaintance with Adrian Ost. He toured as the band&#x27;s sole guitarist until later that year, when Dave Pino was added to the mix. Pino had just moved to Los Angeles and heard about the open slot through his friendship with Piggy D (bassist for Rob Zombie). Upon the departure of Siggy from the band in 2008, Gustavo Aued was brought in to replace him on bass, and later that year, drummer Gordon Heckaman joined the band (both originally from Cage9 as well), solidifying the lineup for the next album.

=== &quot;Somewhere on the Other Side of Nowhere&quot; (2007–2011) ===

On May 21, 2007, Powerman 5000 claimed via a Myspace blog post that they will be releasing a new studio album in 2007. The following is taken directly from said post: &quot;Considering the bands track record of putting out CDs once every three years it seems hard to believe that, yes we will put out a new disc in 2007!! It&#x27;s all just beginning to develop and the wheres, whos and whats are to be determined but new rock is on the way!!&quot; However, talk about the record soon simmered, and no new information was released.

Finally, in December 2008, the new track &quot;Super Villain&quot; premiered on the band&#x27;s Myspace page, showcasing their return to their platinum-selling sound of the late 1990s. On January 28, 2009, a preview of tracks from their upcoming sixth studio album were posted on the group&#x27;s Myspace page, containing clips from the songs &quot;Super Villain&quot;, &quot;V Is for Vampire&quot;, and &quot;Horror Show&quot;. Powerman 5000 posted that &quot;Super Villain&quot; would become available for digital purchase on February 10, 2009, on iTunes and Amazon.

On April 7, 2009, Powerman 5000 released a blog on their Myspace page stating that &quot;Anyone for Doomsday?&quot; has officially been re-released. The legal battle ended and the album was released under the SKG Music License. The album is available on iTunes as a digital download. On April 21, 2009, the band released &quot;V Is for Vampire&quot;, the second single from their album, which is planned for a summer release.

On July 7, 2009, Powerman 5000 released a blog on their Myspace page stating that the new album has been finished, and that a release date, track listing, artwork, and additional tour dates was coming soon. On July 27, 2009, Powerman 5000 appeared on Rockline, announcing the title of the new album as &quot;Somewhere on the Other Side of Nowhere&quot;. A tentative release date of October 6, 2009, was also announced. Three new songs were also premiered on the show, including &quot;Timebomb, Baby&quot;, &quot;Make Us Insane&quot;, and &quot;Show Me What You&#x27;ve Got&quot;. On Myspace, Spider posted a blog talking about the three new songs filled with comments of the fans liking the music.

On September 6, 2009, Powerman 5000 released the album cover design along with the promotion of their tour starting on October 24, 2009. They also released two new promotional videos on YouTube for their new album, confirming its release date as October 6, 2009.

On October 1, 2009, the full track &quot;Do Your Thing&quot; was leaked onto YouTube. The song was apparently taken from the Megatronic Records Forum, which frontman Spider One currently owns. The CD &quot;Somewhere on the Other Side of Nowhere&quot; was officially released on October 6, 2009, in the U.S. and was available in Canada on October 20, 2009, two weeks after the reported release date. The band embarked on a national tour in support of the album.

On December 7, 2009, Spider, the band&#x27;s lead singer posted links on his Twitter page linking to FearNET.com which is hosting the band&#x27;s music video for their first single &quot;Super Villain&quot;. The video is also available on YouTube and stars Johnathon Schaech as the infamous Super Villain.

Powerman 5000 played at the U-Fest in Phoenix, Arizona, on April 23, 2011, playing alongside Accept, Papa Roach, Drowning Pool, Nonpoint, All That Remains, and Hollywood Undead. This was the band&#x27;s third consecutive appearance at the yearly show.

=== &quot; Copies, Clones &amp; Replicants Builders of the Future &quot;(2011–2016) ===

The band announced on May 23, 2011, that they had started work on a new album. On July 24, 2011, Powerman 5000 released a cover of Devo&#x27;s &quot;Whip It&quot;, a cover of &quot;Space Oddity&quot; by David Bowie on July 28, 2011, and a cover of Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;Jump&quot; on July 31, 2011, on their website. Released by Cleopatra Records, &quot;Copies, Clones &amp; Replicants&quot; included covers of other new wave songs such as The Fixx&#x27;s &quot;One Thing Leads to Another&quot; and Eddy Grant&#x27;s &quot;Electric Avenue&quot;.

On July 11, 2012, Spider began teasing a new song by posting on his Twitter that &quot;Someone sneaked a camera in the studio tonight and filmed the speaker while it blasted a new Powerman 5000 tune!&quot;.

Their album &quot;Builders of the Future&quot; was released on May 27, 2014, and was co-produced/co-written by guitarist Nick Quijano Sci55ors, as well as engineered and co-produced by Evan Rodaniche (Evan9), both former guitarists. The band was set to play a co-headlining tour in the US with Wayne Static in November with American Head Charge supporting them until Wayne&#x27;s death in November 2014.

=== &quot;New Wave&quot; and &quot;The Noble Rot&quot; and &quot;Abandon Ship&quot; (2016–present) ===
On May 15, 2016, the band announced that they plan to release new music before the end of that year. By October 21 that same year, the band released a short snippet of the track &quot;Die on Your Feet&quot; from the new album onto their official Facebook page.

By June 2017, the title of the 11th album was revealed as &quot;New Wave&quot;. It was released on October 27, 2017, with the music video of the album&#x27;s first official single &quot;Sid Vicious in a Dress&quot; released by September 5 that same year. In support of the album, the band began touring in the U.S. in October of the same year, and would last through the end of 2018. On June 4, 2018, the band announced they would be taking part of the &quot;Summer of Screams&quot; Tour in September, along with Mushroomhead and The Browning. However, on August 23, it was announced the band had to cancel their performances for the tour for medical reasons involving Spider&#x27;s vocals.

In March 2020, it was announced the band has been signed to Cleopatra Records (whom had previously released the cover album Copies, Clones &amp; Replicants), with their new album titled &quot;The Noble Rot&quot; set to have a release for August 28, accompanied by a new tour overseas. The lead single &quot;Black Lipstick&quot; was released on June 3 and a video for the song, directed by Spider One, was released on the same day.

On May 10, 2024, &quot;Abandon Ship&quot; was released.

== Musical style ==
Spider One often uses spoken word or chanting in his vocalization. AllMusic&#x27;s Chris Slawecki said that &quot;Spider doesn&#x27;t sing one single lyric, instead barking out the lyrics in a hard staccato delivery.&quot; The band&#x27;s lyrics are often campy and make reference to pulp science fiction. These themes include gods and monsters, global annihilation and robot violence, as well as anti-consumerism.

Powerman 5000&#x27;s music is driven by staccato guitar playing and electronic samples, which has been compared to the music of Rob Zombie, Spider One&#x27;s older brother. This style has primarily been described as industrial metal.

The band&#x27;s early album &quot;Mega!! Kung Fu Radio&quot; featured a different style from the one which the band is generally known for; this album incorporated elements of heavy metal, hip hop, hard rock and funk. &quot;Transform&quot; featured more emphasis on melody and human-driven sounds, shifting away from the computerized sounds of the band&#x27;s earlier albums. &quot;Destroy What You Enjoy&quot; featured a punk-driven sound.

==Powerman 5000 in other media==
Various Powerman 5000 songs have been used in media, including television/film soundtracks and video games from the early 2000s. This includes such game titles as &quot;FreQuency&quot;, &quot;Shaun Palmer&#x27;s Pro Snowboarder&quot;, &quot;NASCAR Thunder 2004&quot;, &quot;SX Superstar&quot;, &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot;, &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot;, NHL Hitz 2003, &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW&quot;, &quot;Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec&quot; and WWE WrestleMania 21, along with the racing game &quot;Baja 1000; Score International&quot;. Film soundtracks such as &quot;Dracula 2000&quot;, &quot;Evolution&quot;, &quot;Blade II&quot;, &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;, &quot;Titan AE&quot;, &quot;Little Nicky&quot;, &quot;Zoolander&quot; and &quot;Bride of Chucky&quot; have all featured the work of Powerman 5000. 

The song &quot;Bombshell&quot; was also used extensively as the entrance music for the WWE tag team The Dudley Boyz. The game &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW&quot; featured three new songs from the band. Mr. Spider hoped the songs would gain popularity from the game alone, seeing the success of music through video games.

The band were parodied in the &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; episode &quot;Missing Identity&quot; as Stingray 5000; Patrick picks up an album by that band called &quot;You Rock My Clams&quot; and says &quot;These guys rock!&quot;.

<text>John Christ (born John Wolfgang Knoll on February 19, 1965) is an American musician best known as the original guitarist for the metal band Danzig. He has been known for his bluesy hard rock sound and frequent use of the pinch harmonic. Christ was ranked 63rd in &quot;Guitar World&#x27;s&quot; list of &#x27;The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists&#x27;.

== Early life ==
Christ was born the youngest of five children, with four older sisters. Christ first started playing acoustic guitar when he was in grade school and began playing electric guitar at age 13. He had previously taken piano lessons. His first electric guitar was a Univox Les Paul copy. Christ grew up in Catonsville, Maryland and attended Catonsville High School. He later studied classical guitar at the Peabody Institute and attended Towson University studying Jazz, theory and composition.

== Samhain and Danzig ==
In 1987, Christ dropped out of college and moved to New Jersey to join Glenn Danzig&#x27;s band Samhain, which became the band Danzig later that same year. Upon his arrival in New Jersey, Christ would share an apartment with Samhain drummer London May, for whom Christ had performed his first band audition. Christ auditioned well, but it wasn&#x27;t until leaving countless guitar solos on Glenn Danzig&#x27;s answering machine that he was finally invited to join the band. When May left the band, Christ shared an apartment with new drummer Chuck Biscuits, where they came up with Christ&#x27;s original stage name &quot;John Von Christ&quot;, before it was shortened to avoid it clashing with bassist Eerie Von. Christ played guitar with Danzig from 1987 to July 1995, appearing on the albums &quot;Danzig&quot;, &quot;Lucifuge&quot;, &quot;How the Gods Kill&quot; and &quot;4&quot;, and also the &quot;Thrall-Demonsweatlive&quot; EP. In 1990, Christ recorded guitar for the Samhain album &quot;Final Descent&quot;. Christ officially left Danzig on July 5, 1995, citing a breakdown in communication within the band as the reason behind his departure. During his time with Danzig, Christ&#x27;s main guitar was a 1983 BC Rich Bich strung with custom D&#x27;Aquisto strings and fit with PRS pickups. The guitar was customized with the Danzig skull symbol, and is currently on display at the Hard Rock Cafe in Orlando.

== Solo career ==
In 1997, Christ was part of the short lived band Juice 13, which also included Randy Castillo, former drummer for Ozzy Osbourne. Christ&#x27;s guitar work has been used by TV stations ABC and Nine Network. During his time with Nine Network, he provided backing guitar for performances by artists including Tom Jones and Lou Rawls. In 1999, Christ released his debut solo album &quot;Flesh Caffeine&quot;. In 2003, Christ was involved in a serious crash and suffered injuries to his fretting hand. As a result of his injuries, he underwent lengthy rehabilitation. On November 27, 2009, Christ returned to the live stage for the first time in ten years with a solo performance in Essex, Maryland.

<text>Tsetse ( , or ) (sometimes spelled tzetze; also known as tik-tik flies) are large, biting flies that inhabit much of tropical Africa. Tsetse flies include all the species in the genus Glossina, which are placed in their own family, Glossinidae. The tsetse is an obligate parasite, which lives by feeding on the blood of vertebrate animals. Tsetse has been extensively studied because of their role in transmitting disease. They have pronounced economic and public health impacts in sub-Saharan Africa as the biological vectors of trypanosomes, causing human and animal trypanosomiasis. 

Tsetse can be distinguished from other large flies by two easily-observed features: primarily, tsetse fold their wings over their abdomens completely when they are resting (so that one wing rests directly on top of the other); Secondly, tsetse also have a long proboscis, extending directly forward, which is attached by a distinct bulb to the bottom of their heads.

Fossilized tsetse has been recovered from Paleogene-aged rocks in the United States and Germany. Twenty-three extant species of tsetse flies are known from the African continent as well as the Arabian Peninsula.

==Terminology==
&quot;Tsetse&quot; without the &quot;fly&quot; has become more common in English, particularly in the scientific and development communities.

The word is pronounced &quot;tseh-tseh&quot; in the Sotho languages and is easily rendered in other African languages. During World War II, a British de Havilland antisubmarine aircraft was known as the &quot;Tsetse&quot; Mosquito.

==Biology==
The biology of tsetse is relatively well understood by entomologists. They have been extensively studied because of their medical, veterinary, and economic importance, because the flies can be raised in a laboratory, and because they are relatively large, facilitating their analysis.

===Morphology===
Tsetse flies can be seen as independent individuals in three forms: as third-instar larvae, pupae, and adults.

Tsetse first becomes separate from their mothers during the third larval instar, during which they have the typical appearance of maggots. However, this life stage is short, lasting at most a few hours, and is almost never observed outside of the laboratory.

Tsetse next develops a hard external case, the puparium, and become pupae - small, hard-shelled oblongs with two distinctively small, dark lobes at the tail (breathing) end. Tsetse pupae are under long. Within the puparial shell, tsetse complete the last two larval instars and the pupal stage.

At the end of the pupal stage, tsetse emerges as adult flies. The adults are relatively large flies, with lengths of , and have a recognizable shape, or bauplan, which makes them easy to distinguish from other flies. Tsetse have large heads, distinctly separated eyes, and unusual antennae. The thorax is quite large, while the abdomen is wider, rather than elongated, and shorter than the wings.

Four characteristics collectively separate adult tsetse from other kinds of flies:
===Anatomy===
Like all other insects, tsetse flies have an adult body comprising three visibly distinct parts: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen.

The head has large eyes, distinctly separated on each side, and a distinct, forward-pointing proboscis attached underneath by a large bulb. The thorax is large, made of three fused segments. Three pairs of legs are attached to the thorax, as are two wings and two halteres. The abdomen is short but wide and changes dramatically in volume during feeding.
The internal anatomy of the tsetse is fairly typical of the insects; the crop is large enough to accommodate a huge increase in size during feeding, as tsetse can take a blood meal equal in weight to themselves. The dipteran crop is heavily understudied, with &quot;Glossina&quot; being one of the few genera having relatively reliable information available: Moloo and Kutuza 1970 for &quot;G. brevipalpis&quot; (including its innervation) and Langley 1965 for &quot;G. morsitans&quot;. The reproductive tract of adult females includes a uterus, which can become large enough to hold the third-instar larva at the end of each pregnancy.

Most tsetse flies are, physically, very tough. Houseflies, and even horseflies, are easily killed with a flyswatter, for example; a great deal of effort is needed to crush a tsetse fly.

===Life cycle===
Tsetse has an unusual life cycle, which may be due to the richness of their blood food source. A female fertilizes only one egg at a time; she will retain each egg within her uterus, the offspring developing internally (during the first three larval stages), in an adaptation called adenotrophic viviparity. During this time, the female feeds the developing offspring with a milky substance (secreted by a modified gland) in the uterus.
In the third larval stage, the tsetse larvae leave the uterus and begin an independent life. The newly-birthed larvae crawl into the ground and develop a hard outer shell (called the puparial case), within which they complete their morphological transformations into adult flies.

The larval life stage has a variable duration, ranging from four to ten days, and the larvae must rely on the resources shared by the mother. The importance of the richness and quality of blood to this stage can be seen; all tsetse development (prior to emerging from the puparial case as a full adult after 35 days) occurs with only the nutrition provided by the mother fly. She must get enough energy for her own survival, as well as for the resources that her offspring, whose mass can exceed that of the mother, will require until it emerges as an adult. Both the male and female tsetse flies feed on blood, however.

Technically, these insects undergo the standard development process of insects, beginning with oocyte formation, ovulation, fertilization, and development of the egg; following egg development and birth is the three larval stages, a pupal stage, and the emergence and maturation of the adult.

===Hosts===
Overall Suidae are the most important hosts. Waterbuck (&quot;Kobus ellipsiprymnus&quot;) are unmolested by &quot;Glossina&quot; because they produce volatiles which act as repellents. Waterbuck odor volatiles are under testing and development as repellents to protect livestock. By species, bloodmeals are derived from:
===Genetics===
The genome of &quot;Glossina morsitans&quot; was sequenced in 2014.

===Symbionts===
Tsetse flies have at least three bacterial symbionts. The primary symbiont is &quot;Wigglesworthia&quot; (&quot;Wigglesworthia glossinidia&quot;), which live within the fly&#x27;s bacteriocytes. The second symbiont is &quot;Sodalis&quot; (&quot;Sodalis glossinidius&quot;) intercellularly or intracellularly, and the third is some kind of &quot;Wolbachia&quot;.

===Diseases===
The salivary gland hypertrophy virus causes abnormal bleeding in the lobes of the crop of &quot;G. m. centralis&quot; and &quot;G. m. morsitans&quot;.

==Systematics==
Tsetse flies are members of the order Diptera, the true flies. They belong to the superfamily Hippoboscoidea, in which the tsetse&#x27;s family, the Glossinidae, is one of four families of blood-feeding obligate parasites.

Up to 34 species and subspecies of tsetse flies are recognized, depending on the particular classification used.

Current classifications place all species of tsetse fly in a single genus named &quot;Glossina&quot;, with most considering the genus as the sole member of the family Glossinidae.

===Species===

The tsetse genus is generally split into three groups of species based on a combination of distributional, ecological, behavioral, molecular and morphological characteristics. The genus includes; savannah flies, forest flies and riverine and lacustrine flies.

==== Savannah flies ====

The &#x27;savannah&#x27; flies: (&quot;Morsitans group&quot;, subgenus &quot;Glossina&quot; s.s.):

** &quot;Glossina palpalis palpalis&quot; 
** &quot;Glossina palpalis gambiensis&quot; 
* &quot;Glossina tachinoides&quot; 

=== Evolutionary history ===
Fossil glossinids are known from the Florissant Formation in North America and the Enspel Lagerstätte of Germany, dating to the late Eocene and late Oligocene respectively.

==Range==

&quot;Glossina&quot; is almost entirely restricted to wooded grasslands and forested areas of the Afrotropics. As of 1990, tsetse flies were reported from a maximum latitude of approximately 15° north in Senegal (Niayes Region), to a minimum of 28.5° south in South Africa (KwaZulu-Natal Province).

Only two subspecies - &quot;G. f. fuscipes&quot; and &quot;G. m. submorsitans&quot; - are present in the very southwest of Saudi Arabia. Although Carter found &quot;G. tachiniodes&quot; in 1903 nearby, near Aden in southern Yemen, there have been no confirmations since.

==Trypanosomiasis==
Tsetse are biological vectors of trypanosomes, meaning that in the process of feeding, they acquire and then transmit small, single-celled trypanosomes from infected vertebrate hosts to uninfected animals. Some tsetse-transmitted trypanosome species cause trypanosomiasis, an infectious disease. In humans, tsetse transmitted trypanosomiasis is called sleeping sickness. In animals, tsetse-vectored trypanosomiases include &quot;nagana&quot;, &quot;souma&quot; (a French term which may not be a distinct condition), and &quot;surra&quot; according to the animal infected and the trypanosome species involved. The usage is not strict and while &quot;nagana&quot; generally refers to the disease in cattle and horses it is commonly used for any of the animal trypanosomiases.

Trypanosomes are animal parasites, specifically protozoans of the genus &quot;Trypanosoma&quot;. These organisms are about the size of red blood cells. Different species of trypanosomes infect different hosts. They range widely in their effects on the vertebrate hosts. Some species, such as &quot;T. theileri&quot;, do not seem to cause any health problems except perhaps in animals that are already sick.

Some strains are much more virulent. Infected flies have an altered salivary composition which lowers feeding efficiency and consequently increases the feeding time, promoting trypanosome transmission to the vertebrate host. These trypanosomes are highly evolved and have developed a life cycle that requires periods in both the vertebrate and tsetse hosts.

Tsetse transmit trypanosomes in two ways, mechanical and biological transmission.
*Mechanical transmission involves the direct transmission of the same individual trypanosomes taken from an infected host into an uninfected host. The name &#x27;mechanical&#x27; reflects the similarity of this mode of transmission to mechanical injection with a syringe. Mechanical transmission requires the tsetse to feed on an infected host and acquire trypanosomes in the blood meal, and then, within a relatively short period, to feed on an uninfected host and regurgitate some of the infected blood from the first blood meal into the tissue of the uninfected animal. This type of transmission occurs most frequently when tsetse are interrupted during a blood meal and attempt to satiate themselves with another meal. Other flies, such as horse-flies, can also cause mechanical transmission of trypanosomes.
*Biological transmission requires a period of incubation of the trypanosomes within the tsetse host. The term &#x27;biological&#x27; is used because trypanosomes must reproduce through several generations inside the tsetse host during the period of incubation (development within the fly is known as the extrinsic incubation period), which requires extreme adaptation of the trypanosomes to their tsetse host. In this mode of transmission, trypanosomes reproduce through several generations, changing in morphology at certain periods. This mode of transmission also includes the sexual phase of the trypanosomes. Tsetse are believed to be more likely to become infected by trypanosomes during their first few blood meals. Tsetse infected by trypanosomes are thought to remain infected for the remainder of their lives. Because of the adaptations required for biological transmission, trypanosomes that can be transmitted biologically by tsetse cannot be transmitted in this manner by other insects.

The relative importance of these two modes of transmission for the propagation of tsetse-vectored trypanosomiases is not yet well understood. However, since the sexual phase of the trypanosome life cycle occurs within the tsetse host, biological transmission is a required step in the life cycle of the tsetse-vectored trypanosomes.

The cycle of biological transmission of trypanosomiasis involves two phases, one inside the tsetse host and the other inside the vertebrate host. Trypanosomes are not passed between a pregnant tsetse and her offspring, so all newly emerged tsetse adults are free of infection. An uninfected fly that feeds on an infected vertebrate animal may acquire trypanosomes in its proboscis or gut. These trypanosomes, depending on the species, may remain in place, move to a different part of the digestive tract, or migrate through the tsetse body into the salivary glands. When an infected tsetse bites a susceptible host, the fly may regurgitate part of a previous blood meal that contains trypanosomes, or may inject trypanosomes in its saliva. Inoculation must contain a minimum of 300 to 450 individual trypanosomes to be successful, and may contain up to 40,000 cells.

In the case of &quot;T. b. brucei&quot; infecting &quot;G. p. gambiensis&quot;, during this time the parasite changes the proteome contents of the fly&#x27;s head. This may be the reason/a reason for the behavioral changes seen, especially the unnecessarily increased feeding frequency, which increases transmission opportunities. This may be due in part to the altered glucose metabolism observed, causing a perceived need for more calories. (The metabolic change, in turn, being due to complete absence of glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase in infected flies.) Monoamine neurotransmitter synthesis is also altered: Production of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase - involved in dopamine and serotonin synthesis - and α-methyldopa hypersensitive protein was induced. This is very similar to the alterations in &quot;other&quot; dipteran vectors&#x27; head proteomes under infection by &quot;other&quot; eukaryotic parasites of mammals, found in another study by the same team in the same year.

The trypanosomes are injected into vertebrate muscle tissue, but make their way, first into the lymphatic system, then into the bloodstream, and eventually into the brain. The disease causes the swelling of the lymph glands, emaciation of the body, and eventually leads to death. Uninfected tsetse may bite the infected animal prior to its death and acquire the disease, thereby closing the transmission cycle.

===Disease hosts and vectors===

The tsetse-vectored trypanosomiases affect various vertebrate species including humans, antelopes, bovine cattle, camels, horses, sheep, goats, and pigs. These diseases are caused by several different trypanosome species that may also survive in wild animals such as crocodiles and monitor lizards. The diseases have different distributions across the African continent, so are transmitted by different species. This table summarizes this information:
=== In humans ===

Human African trypanosomiasis, also called sleeping sickness, is caused by trypanosomes of the species &quot;Trypanosoma brucei&quot;. This disease is invariably fatal if left untreated, but can almost always be cured with current medicines if the disease is diagnosed early enough.

Sleeping sickness begins with a tsetse bite leading to an inoculation in the subcutaneous tissue. The infection moves into the lymphatic system, leading to a characteristic swelling of the lymph glands called &quot;Winterbottom&#x27;s sign&quot;. The infection progresses into the blood stream and eventually crosses into the central nervous system and invades the brain leading to extreme lethargy and eventually to death.

The species &quot;Trypanosoma brucei&quot;, which causes the disease, has often been subdivided into three subspecies that were identified based either on the vertebrate hosts which the strain could infect or on the virulence of the disease in humans. The trypanosomes infectious to animals and not to humans were named &quot;Trypanosoma brucei brucei&quot;. Strains that infected humans were divided into two subspecies based on their different virulences: &quot;Trypanosoma brucei gambiense&quot; was thought to have a slower onset and &quot;Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense&quot; refers to strains with a more rapid, virulent onset. This characterization has always been problematic but was the best that could be done given the knowledge of the time and the tools available for identification. A recent molecular study using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis suggests that the three subspecies are polyphyletic, so the elucidation of the strains of &quot;T. brucei&quot; infective to humans requires a more complex explanation. Procyclins are proteins developed in the surface coating of trypanosomes whilst in their tsetse fly vector.

Other forms of human trypanosomiasis also exist but are not transmitted by tsetse. The most notable is American trypanosomiasis, known as Chagas disease, which occurs in South America, caused by &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot;, and transmitted by certain insects of the Reduviidae, members of the Hemiptera.

===In domestic animals===

Animal trypanosomiasis, also called &quot;nagana&quot; when it occurs in bovine cattle or horses or &quot;sura&quot; when it occurs in domestic pigs, is caused by several trypanosome species. These diseases reduce the growth rate, milk productivity, and strength of farm animals, generally leading to the eventual death of the infected animals. Certain species of cattle are called &quot;trypanotolerant&quot; because they can survive and grow even when infected with trypanosomes although they also have lower productivity rates when infected.

The course of the disease in animals is similar to the course of sleeping sickness in humans.

&quot;Trypanosoma congolense&quot; and &quot;Trypanosoma vivax&quot; are the two most important species infecting bovine cattle in sub-Saharan Africa. &quot;Trypanosoma simiae&quot; causes a virulent disease in swine.

Other forms of animal trypanosomiasis are also known from other areas of the globe, caused by different species of trypanosomes and transmitted without the intervention of the tsetse fly.

The tsetse fly vector ranges mostly in the central part of Africa.

Trypanosomiasis poses a considerable constraint on livestock agricultural development in tsetse fly-infested areas of sub-Saharan Africa, especially in West and Central Africa. International research conducted by ILRI in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Kenya has shown that the N&#x27;Dama is the most resistant breed.

==Control==
The conquest of sleeping sickness and nagana would be of immense benefit to rural development and contribute to poverty alleviation and improved food security in sub-Saharan Africa. Human African trypanosomosis (HAT) and animal African trypanosomosis (AAT) are sufficiently important to make virtually any intervention against these diseases beneficial.

The disease can be managed by controlling the vector and thus reducing the incidence of the disease by disrupting the transmission cycle. Another tactic to manage the disease is to target the disease directly using surveillance and curative or prophylactic treatments to reduce the number of hosts that carry the disease.

Economic analysis indicates that the cost of managing trypanosomosis through the elimination of important populations of major tsetse vectors will be covered several times by the benefits of tsetse-free status. Area-wide interventions against the tsetse and trypanosomosis problem appear more efficient and profitable if sufficiently large areas, with high numbers of cattle, can be covered.

Vector control strategies can aim at either continuous suppression or eradication of target populations. Tsetse fly eradication programmes are complex and logistically demanding activities and usually involve the integration of different control tactics, such as trypanocidal drugs, impregnated treated targets (ITT), insecticide-treated cattle (ITC), aerial spraying (Sequential Aerosol Technique - SAT) and in some situations the release of sterile males (sterile insect technique – SIT). To ensure sustainability of the results, it is critical to apply the control tactics on an area-wide basis, i.e. targeting an entire tsetse population that is preferably genetically isolated.

===Control techniques===
Many techniques have reduced tsetse populations, with earlier, crude methods recently replaced by methods that are cheaper, more directed, and ecologically better.

====Slaughter of wild animals====
One early technique involved slaughtering all the wild animals tsetse fed on. For example, the island of Principe off the west coast of Africa was entirely cleared of feral pigs in the 1930s, which led to the extirpation of the fly. While the fly eventually re-invaded in the 1950s, the new population of tsetse was free from the disease.

====Land clearing====
Another early technique involved complete removal of brush and woody vegetation from an area. However, the technique was not widely used and has been abandoned. Tsetse tend to rest on the trunks of trees so removing woody vegetation made the area inhospitable to the flies. Until about 1959 this was done by hand and so was quite time consuming. Glover et al 1959 describes the technique which they call &quot;chain clearing&quot;. Chain clearing drags a chain forward between two heavy vehicles and thereby does the same job much more quickly - but still at some expense. Preventing regrowth of woody vegetation requires continuous clearing efforts which is even more expensive, and only practical where large human populations are present. Also, the clearing of woody vegetation has come to be seen as an environmental problem more than a benefit.

====Pesticide campaigns====
Pesticides have been used to control tsetse starting initially during the early part of the twentieth century in localized efforts using the inorganic metal-based pesticides, expanding after the Second World War into massive aerial- and ground-based campaigns with organochlorine pesticides such as DDT applied as aerosol sprays at Ultra-Low Volume rates. Later, more targeted techniques used &quot;pour-on&quot; formulations in which advanced organic pesticides were applied directly to the backs of cattle.

====Trapping====

Tsetse populations can be monitored and effectively controlled using simple, inexpensive traps. These often use blue cloth, either in sheet or biconical form, since this color attracts the flies. The traps work by channeling the flies into a collection chamber, or by exposing the flies to insecticide sprayed on the cloth. Early traps mimicked the form of cattle, as tsetse are also attracted to large dark colors like the hides of cows and buffaloes. Some scientists put forward the idea that zebra have stripes, not as a camouflage in long grass, but because the black and white bands tend to confuse tsetse and prevent attack.

The use of chemicals as attractants to lure tsetse to the traps has been studied extensively in the late 20th century, but this has mostly been of interest to scientists rather than as an economically reasonable solution. Attractants studied have been those tsetse might use to find food, like carbon dioxide, octenol, and acetone—which are given off in animals&#x27; breath and distributed downwind in an &quot;odor plume.&quot; Synthetic versions of these chemicals can create artificial odor plumes. A cheaper approach is to place cattle urine in a half gourd near the trap. For large trapping efforts, additional traps are generally cheaper than expensive artificial attractants.

A special trapping method is applied in Ethiopia, where the BioFarm Consortium (ICIPE, BioVision Foundation, BEA, Helvetas, DLCO-EA, Praxis Ethiopia) applies the traps in a sustainable agriculture and rural development context (SARD). The traps are just the entry point, followed by improved farming, human health and marketing inputs. This method is in the final stage of testing (as of 2006).

====Sterile insect technique====
The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a form of pest control that uses ionizing radiation (gamma ray or X-ray) to sterilize male flies that are mass-produced in special rearing facilities. The sterile males are released systematically from the ground or by air in tsetse-infested areas, where they mate with wild females, which do not produce offspring. As a result, this technique can eventually eradicate populations of wild flies. SIT is among the most environmentally friendly control tactics available, and is usually applied as the final component of an integrated campaign. It has been used to subdue the populations of many other fly species including the medfly, &quot;Ceratitis capitata&quot;.

The sustainable removal of the tsetse fly is in many cases the most cost-effective way of dealing with the T&amp;T problem resulting in major economic benefits for subsistence farmers in rural areas. Insecticide-based methods are normally very ineffective in removing the last remnants of tsetse populations, while, on the contrary, sterile males are very effective in finding and mating the last remaining females. Therefore, the integration of the SIT as the last component of an area-wide integrated approach is essential in many situations to achieve complete eradication of the different tsetse populations, particularly in areas of more dense vegetation.

A project that was implemented from 1994 to 1997 on the Island of Unguja, Zanzibar (United Republic of Tanzania), demonstrated that, after suppression of the tsetse population with insecticides, SIT completely removed the &quot;Glossina austeni&quot; Newstead population from the Island. This was carried out without any understanding of the population genetics of &quot;G. a.&quot;, but future SIT efforts can benefit from such preparation. Population genetics would help to select the &quot;Glossina&quot; population to be deployed for similarity to the target population. The eradication of the tsetse fly from Unguja Island in 1997 was followed by the disappearance of the AAT which enabled farmers to integrate livestock keeping with cropping in areas where this had been impossible before. The increased livestock and crop productivity and the possibility of using animals for transport and traction significantly contributed to an increase in the quality of people&#x27;s lives. Surveys in 1999, 2002, 2014, and 2015 have confirmed this success - continued absence of tsetse and nagana on the island.

In the Niayes region of Senegal, a coastal area close to Dakar, livestock keeping was difficult due to the presence of a population of &quot;Glossina palpalis gambiensis&quot;. Feasibility studies indicated that the fly population was confined to very fragmented habitats and a population genetics study indicated that the population was genetically isolated from the main tsetse belt in the south eastern part of Senegal. After completion of the feasibility studies (2006–2010), an area-wide integrated eradication campaign that included an SIT component was started in 2011, and by 2015, the Niayes region had become almost tsetse fly free. This has allowed a change of cattle breeds from lower producing trypanotolerant breeds to higher-producing foreign breeds.

The entire target area (Block 1, 2 and 3) has a total surface of , and the first block (northern part) can be considered free of tsetse, as intensive monitoring has failed to detect since 2012 a single wild tsetse fly. The prevalence of AAT has decreased from 40 to 50% before the project started to less than 10% to date in blocks 1 and 2. Although insecticides are being used for fly suppression, they are applied for short periods on traps, nets and livestock, and are not spread into the environment. After the suppression activities are completed, no more insecticide is applied in the area. The removal of trypanosomosis will eliminate the need for constant prophylactic treatments of the cattle with trypanocidal drugs, therefore reducing residues of these drugs in the dung, meat and milk.

The main beneficiaries of the project are the many small holder farmers, the larger commercial farms and the consumers of meat and milk. According to a socio-economic survey and benefit cost analysis, after eradication of the tsetse farmers will be able to replace their local breeds with improved breeds and increase their annual income by €2.8 million. In addition, it is expected that the number of cattle will be reduced by 45%, which will result in reduced environmental impacts.

==Societal impact==
In the literature of environmental determinism, the tsetse has been linked to difficulties during early state formation for areas where the fly is prevalent. A 2012 study used population growth models, physiological data, and ethnographic data to examine pre-colonial agricultural practices and isolate the effects of the fly. A &quot;tsetse suitability index&quot; was developed from insect population growth, climate and geospatial data to simulate the fly&#x27;s population steady state. An increase in the tsetse suitability index was associated with a statistically significant weakening of the agriculture, levels of urbanization, institutions and subsistence strategies. Results suggest that the tsetse decimated livestock populations, forcing early states to rely on slave labor to clear land for farming, and preventing farmers from taking advantage of natural animal fertilizers to increase crop production. These long-term effects may have kept population density low and discouraged cooperation between small-scale communities, thus preventing stronger nations from forming.

The authors also suggest that under a lower burden of tsetse, Africa would have developed differently. Agriculture (measured by the usage of large domesticated animals, intensive agriculture, plow use and female participation rate in agriculture) as well as institutions (measured by the appearance of indigenous slavery and levels of centralization) would have been more like those found in Eurasia. Qualitative support for this claim comes from archaeological findings; e.g., Great Zimbabwe is located in the African highlands where the fly does not occur, and represented the largest and technically most advanced precolonial structure in Southern sub-Sahara Africa.

Other authors are more skeptical that the tsetse fly had such an immense influence on African development. One conventional argument is that the tsetse fly made it difficult to use draught animals. Hence, wheeled forms of transportations were not used as well. While this is certainly true for areas with high densities of the fly, similar cases outside tsetse-suitable areas exist. While the fly definitely had a relevant influence on the adoption of new technologies in Africa, it has been contended that it does not represent the single root cause.

===History===
According to an article in the &quot;New Scientist&quot;, the depopulated and apparently primevally wild Africa seen in wildlife documentary films was formed in the 19th century by disease, a combination of rinderpest and the tsetse fly. Rinderpest is believed to have originated in Asia, later spreading through the transport of cattle. In 1887, the rinderpest virus was accidentally imported in livestock brought by an Italian expeditionary force to Eritrea. It spread rapidly, reaching Ethiopia by 1888, the Atlantic coast by 1892 and South Africa by 1897. Rinderpest, a cattle plague from central Asia, killed over 90% of the cattle of the pastoral peoples such as the Masai of east Africa. In South Africa, with no native immunity, most of the population – some 5.5 million domestic cattle – died. Pastoralists and farmers were left with no animals – their source of income – and farmers were deprived of their working animals for ploughing and irrigation. The pandemic coincided with a period of drought, causing widespread famine. The starving human populations died of smallpox, cholera, and typhoid, as well as African Sleeping Sickness and other endemic diseases. It is estimated that two-thirds of the Masai died in 1891.

The land was left emptied of its cattle and its people, enabling the colonial powers Germany and Britain to take over Tanzania and Kenya with little effort. With greatly reduced grazing, grassland turned rapidly to bush. The closely cropped grass sward was replaced in a few years by woody grassland and thornbush, ideal habitat for tsetse flies. Wild mammal populations increased rapidly, accompanied by the tsetse fly. Highland regions of east Africa which had been free of tsetse fly were colonised by the pest, accompanied by sleeping sickness, until then unknown in the area. Millions of people died of the disease in the early 20th century.

The areas occupied by the tsetse fly were largely barred to animal husbandry. Sleeping sickness was dubbed &quot;the best game warden in Africa&quot; by conservationists, who assumed that the land, empty of people and full of game animals, had always been like that. Julian Huxley of the World Wildlife Fund called the plains of east Africa &quot;a surviving sector of the rich natural world as it was before the rise of modern man&quot;. They created numerous large reserves for hunting safaris. In 1909 the newly retired president Theodore Roosevelt went on a safari that brought over 10,000 animal carcasses to America. Later, much of the land was turned over to nature reserves and national parks such as the Serengeti, Masai Mara, Kruger and Okavango Delta. The result, across eastern and southern Africa, is a modern landscape of manmade ecosystems: farmland and pastoral land largely free of bush and tsetse fly; and bush controlled by the tsetse fly.

Although the colonial powers saw the disease as a threat to their interests, and acted accordingly to bring transmission almost to a halt in the 1960s, this improved situation led to a laxity of surveillance and management by the newly independent governments covering the same areas - and a resurgence that became a crisis again in the 1990s.

===Current situation===

Tsetse flies are regarded as a major cause of rural poverty in sub-Saharan Africa because they prevent mixed farming. The land infested with tsetse flies is often cultivated by people using hoes rather than more efficient draught animals because &quot;nagana&quot;, the disease transmitted by tsetse, weakens and often kills these animals. Cattle that do survive produce little milk, pregnant cows often abort their calves, and manure is not available to fertilize the worn-out soils.
The disease &quot;nagana&quot; or African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) causes gradual health decline in infected livestock, reduces milk and meat production, and increases abortion rates. Animals eventually succumb to the disease - annual cattle deaths caused by trypanosomiasis are estimated at 3 million, reducing annual cattle production value by US$600m-US$1.2b. This has an enormous impact on the livelihood of farmers who live in tsetse-infested areas, as infected animals cannot be used to plough the land, and keeping cattle is only feasible when the animals are kept under constant prophylactic treatment with trypanocidal drugs, often with associated problems of drug resistance, counterfeited drugs, and suboptimal dosage. The overall annual direct lost potential in livestock and crop production was estimated at US$4.5 billion-US$4.75b.

The tsetse fly lives in nearly in sub-Saharan Africa (mostly wet tropical forest) and many parts of this large area is fertile land that is left uncultivated—a so-called green desert not used by humans and cattle. Most of the 38 countries infested with tsetse are poor, debt-ridden and underdeveloped. Of the 38 tsetse-infested countries, 32 are low-income, food-deficit countries, 29 are least developed countries, and 30 or 34 are among the 40 most heavily indebted poor countries. Eradicating the tsetse and trypanosomiasis (T&amp;T) problem would allow rural Africans to use these areas for animal husbandry or the cultivation of crops and hence increase food production. Only 45 million cattle, of 172 million present in sub-Saharan Africa, are kept in tsetse-infested areas but are often forced into fragile ecosystems like highlands or the semiarid Sahel zone, which increases overgrazing and overuse of land for food production.

In addition to this direct impact, the presence of tsetse and trypanosomiasis discourages the use of more productive exotic and cross-bred cattle, depresses the growth and affects the distribution of livestock populations, reduces the potential opportunities for livestock and crop production (mixed farming) through less draught power to cultivate land and less manure to fertilize (in an environment-friendly way) soils for better crop production, and affects human settlements (people tend to avoid areas with tsetse flies).

Tsetse flies transmit a similar disease to humans, called African trypanosomiasis, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness. An estimated 60-70 million people in 20 countries are at different levels of risk and only 3-4 million people are covered by active surveillance. The DALY index (disability-adjusted life years), an indicator to quantify the burden of disease, includes the impact of both the duration of life lost due to premature death and the duration of life lived with a disability. The annual burden of sleeping sickness is estimated at 2 million DALYs. Since the disease tends to affect economically active adults, the total cost to a family with a patient is about 25% of a year&#x27;s income.

==History of study==

In East Africa, C. F. M. Swynnerton played a large role in the first half of the 20th century. Swynnerton did much of the earliest tsetse ecology research. For this E. E. Austen named a patronymic taxon for him, &quot;G. swynnertoni&quot; in 1922.

==Resistance to trypanosomes==

Tsetse flies have an arsenal of immune defenses to resist each stage of the trypanosome infectious cycle, and thus are relatively refractory to trypanosome infection. Among the host flies&#x27; defenses is the production of hydrogen peroxide, a reactive oxygen species that damages DNA. These defenses limit the population of infected flies.

<text>Sparkle and Fade is the second album by Everclear, released in 1995. It was their first album to be released exclusively on Capitol Records; their previous effort, &quot;World of Noise&quot;, was re-released on Capitol after its introduction through the Portland, Oregon based label, Tim/Kerr Records. The album produced the singles &quot;Heroin Girl,&quot; &quot;Santa Monica,&quot; &quot;Heartspark Dollarsign,&quot; and &quot;You Make Me Feel Like a Whore.&quot; The album&#x27;s music follows themes like addiction and romance through a loosely defined narrative similar to Art Alexakis&#x27; own troubled life when he was in his twenties.

The album&#x27;s cover features childhood pictures of the three members of the band. It is Everclear&#x27;s third-best-selling album to date. It climbed to the top of the Heatseekers Chart in January 1996 and was certified Platinum by the RIAA in May 1996. By December 2001, the album had sold 1,190,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

<doc id="160071" wikidata="Q155136" url="?curid=160071" title="Otto Klemperer">
<text>Otto Nossan Klemperer (; 14 May 18856 July 1973) was a German conductor and composer, originally based in Germany, and then the United States, Hungary and finally, Great Britain. He began his career as an opera conductor, but he was later better known as a conductor of symphonic music.

A protégé of the composer and conductor Gustav Mahler, from 1907 Klemperer was appointed to a succession of increasingly senior conductorships in opera houses in and around Germany. Between 1929 and 1931 he was director of the Kroll Opera in Berlin, where he presented new works and avant-garde productions of classics. He was from a Jewish family, and the rise of the Nazis caused him to leave Germany in 1933. Shortly afterwards he was appointed chief conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and guest-conducted other American orchestras, including the San Francisco Symphony, the New York Philharmonic and later the Pittsburgh Symphony, which he reorganised as a permanent ensemble.

In the late 1930s Klemperer became ill with a brain tumour. An operation to remove it was successful, but left him lame and partly paralysed on his right side. Throughout his life he had bipolar disorder, and after the operation he went through an intense manic phase of the illness and then a long spell of severe depression. His career was seriously disrupted and did not fully recover until the mid-1940s. He served as the musical director of the Hungarian State Opera in Budapest from 1947 to 1950.

Klemperer&#x27;s later career centred on London. In 1951 he began an association with the Philharmonia Orchestra. By that time better known for his readings of the core German symphonic repertoire than for experimental modern music, he gave concerts and made almost 200 recordings with the Philharmonia and its successor, the New Philharmonia, until his retirement in 1972. His approach to Mozart was not universally liked, being thought of by some as heavy, but he became widely considered the most authoritative interpreter of the symphonies of Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner and Mahler.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Otto Nossan Klemperer was born on 14 May 1885 in Breslau, Province of Silesia, in what was then the Imperial German state of Prussia; the city is now Wrocław, Poland. He was the second child and only son of Nathan Klemperer and his wife Ida, &quot;née&quot; Nathan. The family name had originally been &quot;Klopper&quot;, but was changed to &quot;Klemperer&quot; in 1787 in response to a decree by the Austrian emperor Joseph II aimed at assimilating Jews into Christian society. Nathan Klemperer was originally from Josefov, the ghetto in the Bohemian city of Prague; Ida was from a more prosperous Jewish family in Hamburg, of Sephardic descent. Both parents were musical: Nathan sang and Ida played the piano.

When Klemperer was four the family moved from Breslau to Hamburg, where Nathan earned a modest living in commercial posts and his wife gave piano lessons. It was decided quite early in Klemperer&#x27;s life that he would become a professional musician, and when he was about five he started piano lessons with his mother. At the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt he studied the piano with James Kwast and theory with Ivan Knorr. Kwast moved to Berlin, first to the Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory and then to the Stern Conservatory. Klemperer followed him at each move, and later credited him with the whole basis of his musical development. Among Klemperer&#x27;s other teachers was Hans Pfitzner, with whom he studied composition and conducting.

In 1905, Klemperer met Gustav Mahler at a rehearsal of the latter&#x27;s Second Symphony in Berlin. Oskar Fried conducted, and Klemperer was given charge of the off-stage orchestra. He later made a piano arrangement (now lost) of the symphony, which he played to the composer in 1907 when visiting Vienna. In the interim he made his public debut as a conductor in May 1906, taking over from Fried after the first night of the fifty-performance run of Max Reinhardt&#x27;s production of &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot; at the New Theatre, Berlin.

Mahler wrote a short testimonial, recommending Klemperer, on a small card which Klemperer kept for the rest of his life. On the strength of Mahler&#x27;s endorsement, Klemperer was appointed chorus master and assistant conductor at the New German Theatre in Prague in 1907.

===German opera houses===
From Prague, Klemperer moved to be assistant conductor at the Hamburg State Opera (1910–1912), where the sopranos Lotte Lehmann and Elisabeth Schumann made their joint débuts under his direction. His first chief conductorship was at Barmen (1912–1913), after which he moved to the much larger Strasbourg Opera (1914–1917) as deputy to Pfitzner. From 1917 to 1924 he was chief conductor of the Cologne Opera. During his Cologne years he married Johanna Geisler, a singer in the opera company, in 1919. She was a Christian, and he had converted from Judaism. He remained a practising Roman Catholic until 1967, when he left the faith and returned to Judaism. The couple had two children: Werner, who became an actor, and Lotte, who became her father&#x27;s assistant and eventually, his caregiver. Johanna continued her operatic career, sometimes in performances conducted by her husband. She retired from singing by the mid-1930s. The couple remained close and mutually supportive until her death in 1956.

In 1923, Klemperer turned down an invitation from the Berlin State Opera to succeed Leo Blech as musical director; he declined the post, because he did not believe he would be given enough artistic authority over productions. The following year, he became conductor at the Prussian State Theatre in Wiesbaden (1924–1927), a smaller theatre than others in which he had worked, but one where he had the control he sought over stagings. There he conducted new, and often modernistic, productions of a range of operas from &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, &quot;Fidelio&quot; and &quot;Lohengrin&quot; to &quot;Elektra&quot; and &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Tale&quot;. He found his tenure there rewarding and fulfilling, later describing it as the happiest of his career.

Klemperer visited Russia in 1924, conducting there during a six-week stay; he returned each year until 1936. In 1926 he made his American début, succeeding Eugene Goossens as guest conductor of the New York Symphony Orchestra. In his eight-week engagement with the orchestra he gave Mahler&#x27;s Ninth Symphony and Janáček&#x27;s Sinfonietta, in their first performances in the US.

===Berlin===
In 1927, a new opera company was established in Berlin to complement the State Opera, highlighting new works and innovative productions. The company, officially Staatsoper am Platz der Republik, was better known as the Kroll Opera. Leo Kestenberg, the influential head of the Prussian Ministry of Culture, proposed Klemperer as its first director. Klemperer was offered a ten-year contract and accepted it on condition that he would be allowed to conduct orchestral concerts in the theatre, and that he could employ his chosen design and stage experts.
Klemperer&#x27;s biographer Peter Heyworth describes the conductor&#x27;s tenure at the Kroll as &quot;of crucial significance in his career and the development of opera in the first half of the 20th century&quot;. In both concert and operatic performances, Klemperer introduced much new music. Asked later which were the most important of the operas he introduced there, he listed:
In Heyworth&#x27;s view, the modern approach to production at the Kroll − contrasting with conventional representational settings and costumes − exemplified in &quot;a drastically stylised production&quot; of &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; in 1929 was &quot;a decisive forerunner of Wieland Wagner&#x27;s innovations at Bayreuth&quot;. The production divided critical opinion, which ranged from &quot;A new outrage to a German masterpiece ... grotesque&quot; to &quot;an unusual and magnificent performance ... a fresh wind has blown tinsel and cobwebs away&quot;.

In 1929, Klemperer made his British début, conducting the London Symphony Orchestra in the first London performance of Bruckner&#x27;s Eighth Symphony. The British music critics gave the symphony a lukewarm reception, but Klemperer was widely praised for &quot;the power of a dominating personality&quot;, &quot;masterful control&quot; and as &quot;a great orchestral commander&quot;. A leading critic called for the BBC to give Klemperer a long-term appointment in London.

The Kroll Opera closed in 1931, ostensibly because of a financial crisis, although in Klemperer&#x27;s view the motives were political. He said that Heinz Tietjen, director of the State Opera, told him that it was not, as Klemperer supposed, anti-Semitism that had worked against him: &quot;No, that is not so important. It&#x27;s your whole political and artistic direction they don&#x27;t like.&quot; Klemperer&#x27;s contract obliged him to transfer to the main State Opera, where, with such conductors as Bruno Walter, Wilhelm Furtwängler and Leo Blech already established, there was little important work for him. He remained there until 1933, when the rise of the Nazis caused him to leave for safety in Switzerland, joined by his wife and children.

===Los Angeles===
In exile from Germany, Klemperer found that conducting work was far from plentiful, although he secured some prestigious engagements in Vienna and at the Salzburg Festival. He was sounded out by William Andrews Clark, founder and sponsor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, about becoming the orchestra&#x27;s chief conductor in succession to Artur Rodziński, who was leaving to take over the Cleveland Orchestra. The Los Angeles orchestra was not then regarded as among the finest American ensembles, and the salary was less than Klemperer would have liked, but he accepted and sailed to the US in 1935.
The orchestra&#x27;s finances were perilous; Clark had lost a substantial portion of his fortune in the Great Depression and could no longer afford subventions on the scale of earlier years. Despite box-office constraints, Klemperer successfully introduced unfamiliar works including Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; and Second Symphony, Bruckner&#x27;s Fourth and Seventh Symphonies, and works by Stravinsky. He programmed music from &quot;Gurrelieder&quot; by his fellow exile and Los Angeles neighbour Arnold Schoenberg, although the composer complained that Klemperer did not perform his works more often. Klemperer insisted that the local public was not ready for such demanding music; Schoenberg did not bear a grudge and, as Klemperer always aspired to compose as well as to conduct, Schoenberg gave him composition lessons. Klemperer considered him &quot;the greatest living teacher of composition, although ... he never mentioned the twelve-tone system&quot;. The musicologist Hans Keller nevertheless found &quot;tonal varieties of the Schoenbergian method&quot; used &quot;penetratingly&quot; in Klemperer&#x27;s compositions.

In 1935, at Arthur Judson&#x27;s invitation, Klemperer conducted the New York Philharmonic for four weeks. The orchestra&#x27;s chief conductor, Arturo Toscanini, was in Europe and Klemperer took charge of the opening concerts of the season. The New York concert-going public was deeply conservative but despite Judson&#x27;s warning that programming Mahler would be highly damaging at the box-office, Klemperer insisted on giving the Second Symphony. The notices praised the conducting – Oscar Thompson wrote in &quot;Musical America&quot; that the performance was the best he had heard since Mahler conducted the work in New York in 1906 – but the ticket sales were as poor as Judson had predicted, and the orchestra had a deficit of $5,000 from the concert. When Toscanini resigned from the Philharmonic the following year, he recommended Klemperer as his successor, but Klemperer recognised that after &quot;this affair of the Mahler symphony&quot; he would not be re-engaged. Nonetheless, when the then little-known John Barbirolli was announced as Toscanini&#x27;s successor, Klemperer wrote a vehement letter to Judson protesting at being passed over.

Having returned to Los Angeles, Klemperer conducted the orchestra&#x27;s concerts there and in out-of-town venues such as San Diego, Santa Barbara, Fresno and Claremont. He and the orchestra worked with leading soloists, including Artur Schnabel, Emanuel Feuermann, Joseph Szigeti, Bronisław Huberman and Lotte Lehmann. Pierre Monteux was conductor of the San Francisco Symphony and he and Klemperer guest-conducted each other&#x27;s orchestras. After a concert under Klemperer in 1936, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;&#x27;s music critic hailed him as one of the world&#x27;s greatest conductors, along with Furtwängler, Walter and Toscanini.

===1938 to 1945===
The governing board of the Pittsburgh Symphony approached Klemperer in early 1938, seeking his help in reconstituting the orchestra – an &quot;ad hoc&quot; group since 1927 – as a permanent ensemble. He held auditions in Pittsburgh and, more fruitfully, in New York, and after three weeks of intensive rehearsal the orchestra was ready for the opening concerts of the season, which he conducted. The results were highly successful, and he was offered a large salary to remain as the orchestra&#x27;s chief conductor. He was contractually committed to Los Angeles, but contemplated taking on the direction of both orchestras. He decided against it and Fritz Reiner was appointed as conductor in Pittsburgh.

In 1939, Klemperer began to suffer from serious balance problems. A potentially fatal brain tumour was diagnosed and he travelled to Boston for an operation to remove it. The operation was successful, but left him lame and partly paralysed on his right side. He had long had bipolar disorder (in the parlance of the time he was &quot;manic depressive&quot;) and after the operation he went through an intense manic phase of the illness, which lasted for nearly three years and was followed by a long spell of severe depression. In 1941, after he walked out of a mental sanatorium in Rye, New York, the local police put out a bulletin, describing him as &quot;dangerous and insane&quot;. He was found two days later in Morristown, New Jersey and appeared composed. A doctor who examined him said he was &quot;temperamental and unstrung&quot; but not dangerous, and he was released. The board of the Los Angeles Philharmonic terminated his contract, and his subsequent appearances were few, and seldom with prestigious ensembles, in Los Angeles or elsewhere. As her father struggled to support the family from his modest fees, Lotte worked in a factory to bring in some money.

===Post-war===

By 1946, Klemperer had recovered his health enough to return to Europe for a conducting tour. His first concert was in Stockholm, where he met the music scholar Aladár Tóth, husband of the pianist Annie Fischer; Tóth was soon to be an important influence on his career. On another tour in 1947 Klemperer conducted &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; at the Salzburg Festival and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; in Vienna. While he was in Salzburg, Tóth, who had been appointed director of the Hungarian State Opera in Budapest, invited him to become the company&#x27;s musical director. Klemperer accepted, and served from 1947 to 1950. In Budapest he conducted the major Mozart operas and &quot;Fidelio&quot;, &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, &quot;Lohengrin&quot; and &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot;, as well as works from the Italian repertory, and many concerts.

In March 1948, Klemperer made his first post-war appearance in London, conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra. He conducted Bach&#x27;s Third Orchestral Suite from the harpsichord, Stravinsky&#x27;s Symphony in Three Movements and Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Eroica&quot; Symphony.

Klemperer left the Budapest post in 1950, frustrated by the political interference of the communist regime. He held no permanent conductorship for the next nine years. In the early 1950s he freelanced in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Britain, Canada, France, Germany and elsewhere. In London in 1951 he conducted two Philharmonia concerts at the new Royal Festival Hall, eliciting high praise from reviewers. The music critic of &quot;The Times&quot; wrote:
After this, Klemperer&#x27;s seemingly resurgent career received another severe set-back. At Montreal airport later in 1951 he slipped on ice and fell, breaking his hip. He was hospitalised for eight months. Then for a year he and his family were, as he put it, virtually prisoners in the US because of obstacles to leaving the country, following new legislation. With the help of an accomplished lawyer, he secured temporary six-month passports in 1954, and moved with his wife and daughter to Switzerland. He settled in Zürich, and obtained German citizenship and right of residency in Switzerland.

===London===

From the mid-1950s, Klemperer&#x27;s domestic base was in Zürich and his musical base in London, where his career became associated with the Philharmonia. It was widely regarded as the best orchestra in Britain in the 1950s: &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; described it as &quot;an elite whose virtuosity transformed British concert life&quot;, and &quot;The Times&quot; called it &quot;the Rolls-Royce of British orchestras&quot;. Its founder and proprietor, Walter Legge, engaged a range of prominent conductors for his concerts. By the early 1950s the one most closely identified with the orchestra was Herbert von Karajan, but he was clearly the heir apparent to the ailing Furtwängler as chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic and the Salzburg Festival; anticipating that Karajan would become unavailable to the Philharmonia, Legge built up a relationship with Klemperer, who was admired by the players, the critics and the public.

Legge was a senior producer for Columbia, part of the EMI recording group in the UK. As EMI paid for the rehearsals for recordings, Legge&#x27;s concerts tended to feature works he had recorded immediately beforehand, so that the orchestra was fully rehearsed at no cost to him. This suited Klemperer, who though he disliked making recordings enjoyed the luxury of &quot;hav[ing] time to prepare a work properly&quot;.

According to the critic William Mann, Klemperer&#x27;s repertory by now was:
In 1957, Legge launched the Philharmonia Chorus, which made its debut in Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony conducted by Klemperer. In &quot;The Observer&quot; Heyworth wrote that with &quot;what promises to be our best choir [and] our best orchestra and a great conductor&quot;, Legge had given London &quot;a Beethoven cycle that any city in the world, be it Vienna or New York, would envy&quot;.

Wieland Wagner invited Klemperer to conduct &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; at the 1959 Holland Festival, and they agreed to collaborate on &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; at Bayreuth, but neither plan was realised, because Klemperer suffered a further physical setback: in October 1958 while smoking in bed he set his bedclothes alight. His burns were life-threatening, and his recovery slow. It was not for nearly a year, until September 1959, that he recovered his health enough to conduct again. On Klemperer&#x27;s return to the Philharmonia, Legge stood before the orchestra and appointed him conductor for life – the Philharmonia&#x27;s first principal conductor. Klemperer&#x27;s concerts in the 1960s included more works from outside the core German repertory, including Bartók&#x27;s Divertimento, and symphonies by Berlioz, Dvořák, Mahler and Tchaikovsky.

Klemperer returned to opera in 1961, making his Covent Garden début in &quot;Fidelio&quot; for which he directed the staging as well as the music. He had to a considerable extent moved away from the experimental stagings of the Kroll years; the 1961 &quot;Fidelio&quot; was described as &quot;traditional, unfussy, grandly conceived, and profoundly revealing&quot;, and of &quot;deep serenity&quot; musically. Klemperer directed and conducted another &quot;Fidelio&quot; in Zürich the following year, at the opera house, only a few hundred yards from his home. He battled with entrenched interests in the Zürich orchestra to secure the best players, but he succeeded and the performances were well received. At Covent Garden he later directed and conducted two more new productions: &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; (1962), and &quot;Lohengrin&quot; (1963), neither of which was as well reviewed as &quot;Fidelio&quot;.

===Later years===
During the early 1960s Legge became disenchanted with the orchestral music scene. His freedom to programme what he pleased was hampered by new committees at the Festival Hall and EMI, and his orchestra was less in demand in the studios. In March 1964, with no advance warning to the orchestra, he issued a press statement announcing that &quot;after the fulfilment of its present commitments the activities of the Philharmonia Orchestra will be suspended for an indefinite period.&quot; Klemperer said that Legge had not warned him beforehand of the announcement, although Legge later maintained that he had done so. With Klemperer&#x27;s strong support the players refused to be disbanded and formed themselves into a self-governing ensemble as the New Philharmonia Orchestra (NPO). They elected him as their president. He remained in the position until his retirement eight years later.

In his later years Klemperer returned to the Jewish faith, and was a strong supporter of the state of Israel. He visited his younger sister, who lived there, and while in Jerusalem in 1970 he accepted the offer of Israeli citizenship, though continuing to retain his German citizenship and permanent Swiss residency.

As Klemperer aged, his concentration and control of the orchestra declined. At one recording session he dozed off while conducting, and he found his hearing and eyesight under strain from concentrating for the length of a concert. One of his players told André Previn, &quot;Sadly, he got a bit deaf and shaky. You&#x27;d be thinking &#x27;poor old Klemperer&#x27;, then suddenly the veil of infirmity would drop and he&#x27;d be wonderfully vigorous again.&quot; Klemperer continued to conduct and record with the New Philharmonia until the last concert of his career – at the Festival Hall on 26 September 1971 – and his final recording session two days later. The programme for the concert was Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;King Stephen&quot; overture, and Fourth Piano Concerto, with Daniel Adni as soloist, and Brahms&#x27;s Third Symphony. The recording, with the orchestra&#x27;s wind players, was of Mozart&#x27;s Serenade No. 11 in E flat, K. 375.

The following January, after flying from Zürich to London to conduct Bruckner&#x27;s Seventh Symphony, Klemperer announced the day before the concert that he could no longer cope with the strain of public performances. He hoped to be able to go on making recordings, as he felt he might be able to manage the shorter spans of recording takes, and intended to conduct Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; and Bach&#x27;s &quot;St John Passion&quot; for EMI, but neither plan came to fruition.
Heyworth writes about the conductor&#x27;s last years:
Klemperer retired to his home in Zürich, where he died in his sleep on 6 July 1973. His wife predeceased him and he was survived by their two children. He was buried in the Jewish cemetery at Friesenberg, Zürich, four days later.

==Compositions==
Klemperer said, &quot;I am mainly a conductor who also composes. Naturally, I would be glad to be remembered as a conductor and as a composer.&quot; German conductors of his generation began their careers when it was rare for a conductor not to compose: composition was seen as part of the traditional training of a kapellmeister. He began composing at an early age, and started writing songs in his mid-teens. He extensively revised some of his compositions and destroyed others.

Hearing Debussy&#x27;s opera &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; in Prague in 1908 changed Klemperer&#x27;s compositional ideas. He later viewed the music he composed after that as his first mature works. He continued to write songs, both orchestral and with piano – there were about 100 in all – and in about 1915 he wrote two operas, &quot;Wehen&quot; (meaning &quot;labour pains&quot;) and &quot;Das Ziel&quot; (The Goal). Neither was publicly staged, although the composer conducted a private concert performance of &quot;Das Ziel&quot; in Berlin in 1931. The &quot;Merry Waltz&quot; from the latter is the best-known of his compositions. Of his nine string quartets, eight survive. EMI recorded the Seventh in 1970. In 1919 he composed a Missa Sacra for soloists, chorus and orchestra, and also a setting of Psalm 23.

Klemperer gave the premiere of his First Symphony with the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam in 1961, and that of the final version of his Second with the New Philharmonia in 1969, recording it for EMI a few weeks later. He wrote six symphonies. Harold Schonberg, music critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said that the First Symphony, with its incorporation of the &quot;Marseillaise&quot; in the second movement, &quot;sounded like Charles Ives in one of his wilder moments&quot;. When the recording of the Second Symphony was issued in 1970, the critic Edward Greenfield wrote, &quot;There is a gritty quality about much of Klemperer&#x27;s fast music [with] sharp-edged unison passages ... but give Klemperer a slow tempo and he will melt with amazing rapidity ... the slow movement is astonishingly sweet, with one passage – clarinet over pizzicato strings – recalling the world of Lehár or even Viennese café music.&quot; The critic Meirion Bowen wrote of the same work that it was &quot;the product of an outstanding conductor musing on the works of composers he has championed throughout his career&quot;.

==Recordings==

Although he did not enjoy recording, Klemperer&#x27;s discography is extensive. His first recording was an acoustic set of the slow movement of Bruckner&#x27;s Eighth Symphony, made for Polydor in 1924 with the Staatskapelle Berlin. His early recordings include Beethoven symphonies and less characteristic repertoire including the first recording of Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Alborada del gracioso&quot;, and &quot;Nuages&quot; and &quot;Fêtes&quot; from Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Nocturnes&quot; (1926). Then, in between recordings of mostly German classics – including works by Brahms, Bruckner, Mendelssohn, Schubert, Richard Strauss and Wagner – he ventured into the light French repertoire with the overtures to &quot;Fra Diavolo&quot; and &quot;La belle Hélène&quot; (1929).

From the Los Angeles years there is only one purpose-made studio recording but several transcriptions of live radio broadcasts, ranging from symphonies by Beethoven, Bruckner and Dvořák to excerpts from operas by Gounod, Massenet, Puccini and Verdi. There are no commercial studio recordings from Klemperer&#x27;s time in Budapest, but live performances in the opera house or on air were recorded and have been issued on CD, including complete sets of &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, &quot;Fidelio&quot;, &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;, &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; and &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, all sung in Hungarian.

For the Vox label Klemperer recorded several sets in Vienna in 1951, including Beethoven&#x27;s Missa solemnis praised by Legge as &quot;grave and powerful&quot;. In the same year his broadcast performances in the Concertgebouw of Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Kindertotenlieder&quot; and Second Symphony, with the soloists Jo Vincent and Kathleen Ferrier, were recorded and have been issued on disc by Decca. During the 1950s many other live broadcasts conducted by Klemperer were recorded, and later published on CD, with orchestras including the Bavarian Radio Symphony, Concertgebouw, Cologne Radio Symphony, RIAS Symphony, Berlin and the Vienna Symphony.

In October 1954 Klemperer made the first of his many recordings with the Philharmonia: Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Jupiter&quot; Symphony. (&quot;Extremely impressive ... epic&quot;, commented &quot;The Gramophone&quot;, &quot;carried through unfalteringly to the end.&quot;) Between then and 1972 he conducted the orchestra, and its successor, the New Philharmonia, in recordings of nearly two hundred different works. With the original Philharmonia they included more Mozart symphonies, complete symphony cycles of Beethoven and Brahms, symphonies by Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Schubert, Schumann, Bruckner, Dvořák, Tchaikovsky and Mahler, and other orchestral works by, among others, Bach, Johann Strauss, Richard Strauss, Stravinsky, Wagner and Weill.

From the choral repertoire he and the Philharmonia Chorus and Orchestra recorded Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;, Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; and Brahms&#x27;s &quot;German Requiem&quot;. His complete opera recordings with the Philharmonia were &quot;Fidelio&quot; and &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;. Solo singers in these recordings included Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Gottlob Frick, Christa Ludwig, Peter Pears, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Jon Vickers.

After the players reconstituted themselves as the New Philharmonia in 1964 Klemperer worked extensively with them in the studios, recording eight symphonies by Haydn, three by Schumann, four by Bruckner and two by Mahler. A complete Beethoven piano concerto cycle featured Daniel Barenboim as soloist. The major choral recordings were of Beethoven&#x27;s Missa solemnis and Bach&#x27;s B minor Mass. Reviewing the former, Alec Robertson wrote that it &quot;must take its place on the heights among the greatest recordings of our time&quot;. The Bach set divided critical opinion: Robertson called it &quot;a spiritual experience ... a glorious achievement&quot;; the &quot;Stereo Record Guide&quot;, though conceding &quot;the majesty of Klemperer&#x27;s conception&quot;, found it &quot;disappointing ... with plodding tempi&quot;. There were four complete operas: &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; and &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;. Soloists included, among the women, Janet Baker, Teresa Berganza, Mirella Freni, Anja Silja and Elisabeth Söderström, and among the men, Theo Adam, Gabriel Bacquier, Geraint Evans, Nicolai Gedda and Nicolai Ghiaurov.

==Honours, legacy and reputation==
===Honours and legacy===
In 1933 Klemperer was presented with the Goethe Medal by President Hindenburg in Berlin. He was awarded the Leipzig Orchestral Nikisch Prize in 1966, and held honorary degrees from Occidental College and the University of California, Los Angeles. In 1971 he was appointed an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music in London. From Germany he held the Grand Medal of Merit with Star (1958) and the Order of Merit (1967).

The first movement from Klemperer&#x27;s 1959 Philharmonia recording of Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony was selected by NASA for inclusion on the Voyager Golden Record, sent into space on the Voyager space craft. The record contained sounds and images selected as examples of the diversity of life and culture on Earth.

In 1973 Lotte Klemperer presented the Royal Academy of Music with a collection of her father&#x27;s books and marked-up scores, together with a portrait and some of his batons. This is now known as the Otto Klemperer Collection. One of the academy&#x27;s two named professorships in conducting is the Klemperer Chair (currently, at 2023, held by Semyon Bychkov).

===Reputation===
&quot;The Washington Post&quot;&#x27;s music critic Joseph McLellan wrote when Klemperer died, &quot;An age of giants has ended ... They are all gone: Toscanini, Walter, Furtwängler, Beecham, Szell, Reiner, and, now Klemperer.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; said that in Britain he had been revered as the greatest of living conductors. In the view of &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, following Toscanini&#x27;s retirement in April 1954 and Furtwängler&#x27;s death seven months later, Klemperer was &quot;generally accepted as the most authoritative interpreter of the central Austro-German repertory&quot;.

Many musicians disagreed with Klemperer&#x27;s way of conducting Mozart. Sir Neville Cardus of &quot;The Guardian&quot; observed, &quot;It was not for him the gallant Mozart presented by Sir Thomas Beecham; far from it. Klemperer&#x27;s Mozart was made of sterner stuff.&quot; Mann complained that the conductor&#x27;s direction of &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; was &quot;didactic, humourless, tortoise-like&quot;, though his colleague Stanley Sadie found &quot;Klemperer&#x27;s leisured, cool, almost dispassionate view of the opera is not without its attractiveness. ... The deliberation and the poise are not what we are used to in &quot;Figaro&quot;, and they say something about it which is worth hearing.&quot; It was not only in Mozart that Klemperer&#x27;s tempi attracted adverse comment: a frequent criticism in his later years was that his tempi were slow. The EMI producer Suvi Raj Grubb wrote:
Cardus expressed regret that Klemperer had too rarely been allowed to programme Bruckner, &quot;whose symphonies he encompassed with a grip and a vision which saw the end of a large musical shape in the beginning&quot;. Cardus added:

It was as a Beethoven conductor that Klemperer became most celebrated. &quot;The Record Guide&quot; said of the 1951 recording of the Missa solemnis, &quot;it is seldom that we hear in the concert hall a performance so clear, so fervent and so musical as that which Klemperer has achieved ... [with] the impression of sublimity achieved by this splendid performance.&quot; Of his contemporaneous recording of the Fifth Symphony, the same writers called it &quot;a really individual reading&quot;, preferable to those of Toscanini, Walter or Erich Kleiber: &quot;Klemperer treats the work as if he had just discovered its greatness, illuminating every page with a ceaseless care for detail.&quot; Mann wrote of the 1962 recording of &quot;Fidelio&quot;, &quot;the performance is so stunning that after it operagoers may almost despair of hearing a &quot;Fidelio&quot; that will not prove a disappointment.&quot; The Philharmonia&#x27;s first horn, Alan Civil, said, &quot;It took a Klemperer to throw fresh light on Beethoven, and I found his Beethoven cycles marvellous. I mean, I don&#x27;t want to play Beethoven with any other conductor&quot;, and a colleague from the orchestra said, &quot;It&#x27;s as though Beethoven himself were standing there.&quot;

<text>Telus Communications Inc. (TCI) is the wholly owned principal subsidiary of Telus Corporation, a Canadian national telecommunications company that provides a wide range of telecommunications products and services including internet access, voice, entertainment, healthcare, video, smart home automation and IPTV television. The company is based in the Vancouver, British Columbia, area; it was originally based in Edmonton, Alberta, before its merger with BC Tel in 1999. Telus&#x27; wireless division, Telus Mobility, offers UMTS, and LTE-based mobile phone networks. Telus is the incumbent local exchange carrier in British Columbia and Alberta. Its primary competitors are Rogers Communications and Bell Canada. Telus is a member of the British Columbia Technology Industry Association.

== History ==
Telus Corporation was formed in 1990 by the government of Alberta as a holding company to facilitate the privatization of Alberta Government Telephones (AGT), a crown corporation that provided telephone service to most of Alberta outside of Edmonton. In 1995, it acquired Edmonton Telephones Corporation (EdTel), the main telephone provider for Edmonton itself, from the city of Edmonton making Telus the sole provider of telephone service in Alberta. In 1996, Telus was introduced to the public as the consumer brand, replacing both AGT and EdTel.


In 1998, Telus and BC Tel announced a proposed merger. The proposed merged company, BCT.Telus Communications Inc., was incorporated separately in British Columbia, with headquarters at BC Tel&#x27;s office in Burnaby. After shareholder approval BCT.Telus acquired BC Tel and Telus; the merger was completed in 1999. In 2000 the combined BCT.Telus changed named back to Telus Corporation, and the BC Tel brand was retired. The merger created Canada&#x27;s second largest telecom company, with 22% of market share compared to Bell Canada&#x27;s 42%. American company GTE had held a slight majority of ownership in BC Tel prior to the merger with Telus, and retained a 26.7% share of the post-merger company.

Large swaths of rural Quebec, mainly the Gaspé Peninsula and the north shore, were served from 1927 by an entity known as Corporation de Téléphone et de Pouvoir de Québec, and in 1955, this became known as Québec Téléphone. In 1966, the Anglo-Canadian Telephone Company, a subsidiary of General Telephone and Electronics of Stamford, Connecticut (later GTE), became a majority shareholder in Québec Téléphone. In 1997, Groupe QuébecTel was established to own Québec Téléphone. GTE sold its interests in Québec Téléphone to Telus in August 2000, which renamed it Telus Québec on April 2, 2001.

GTE was itself acquired by Bell Atlantic in 2000, and the company changed its name to Verizon Communications. Verizon inherited GTE&#x27;s share of Telus, but in late 2004 sold its remaining 20.5% stake. This was so that Verizon could focus more on its own services.

In October 2019, Telus Corp announced it would buy home security provider ADT Inc.&#x27;s Canadian operations for 700 million (US$527.27 million).

In January 2022, Telus Communications acquired London-based ISP Start.ca. In June 2022, Telus Communications acquired Altima Telecom.

==Parent company==
Telus Corporation is a conglomerate, and its wholly owned principal subsidiary is Telus Communications Inc (TCI), according to the 2010 Telus annual report.

=== Labour dispute ===
After the Telus-BCTel merger, unionized employees voted to certify the Telecommunications Workers Union (TWU) as the sole bargaining agent for the expanded company&#x27;s workforce. The TWU had previously been the union representing BCTel employees – it replaced the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) in Alberta. A labour dispute between Telus and the TWU began after the previous contract, negotiated with BCTel before the Telus merger, expired at the end of 2000. After Telus made its final offer to the TWU it informed the union of its intention to bring an end to the dispute by unilaterally implementing its April 2005 offer to employees in Alberta and British Columbia. The next day the union went on strike in British Columbia while Telus locked out its unionized workers in Alberta, although (as is common in disputes where an employer attempts to unilaterally implement a new contract) the union consistently referred to the dispute as a &quot;lockout.&quot;

On July 25, 2005, Telus blocked its Internet subscribers from accessing a website supporting striking union members. The company expressed concerns over content on the site, saying it identified employees crossing picket lines and encouraged disruptive behaviour, while the union alleged it amounted to censorship. The British Columbia Civil Liberties Association issued an official objection to the unilateral blocking on July 26, stating &quot;Telus is leveraging its power as a telecommunications service provider to censor a specific group, shut down debate and limit the messages conveyed about the current labour dispute&quot;. An Alberta court injunction ordered the blocked website, Voices For Change, to remove postings of &quot;Telus employee photos&quot; and other &quot;intimidating or threatening material&quot;. The site owner agreed to comply and Telus unblocked the website. Telus and the TWU ratified a tentative agreement on November 18, 2005, ending the dispute.

=== Relaunch of Clearnet ===

In April 2011, Telus Mobility relaunched the Clearnet brand as a limited market trial in Kelowna, British Columbia, and Red Deer, Alberta. The company again closed to new business in June 2012.

=== Non-voting share conversion ===
In February 2013, Telus exchanged all non-voting shares into common shares on a one-for-one basis.

=== Purchase of Public Mobile ===

In October 2013, Telus acquired minor mobile phone provider Public Mobile and relaunched it in 2015 as a &quot;value brand&quot; MVNO on the Telus network.

== Reception ==
In October 2008, Telus was named one of British Columbia&#x27;s Top Employers by Mediacorp Canada Inc., which was announced by The Vancouver Sun, The Province and the Victoria Times-Colonist.

The company has been accused of taking actions to hinder the emergence of competition in Canadian telecommunications. This, along with other industry concerns, has led to consumer and industry pressure to reform the regulatory system governing the Canadian telecommunications industry.

== Marketing ==
=== Sponsorship ===
Telus currently sponsors the Telus Spark Science Centre in Calgary, Telus World of Science in Edmonton and Science World in Vancouver. Telus funds the annual Kokanee Crankworx freeride mountain bike and World Ski &amp; Snowboard festivals, both held in Whistler, British Columbia.

Telus was a sponsor and marketing partner of Hockey Canada since 2004 and the title sponsor of Canada&#x27;s national midget hockey championship, the Telus Cup, since 2005. Telus has been a sponsor of Rogers Sportsnet&#x27;s regional broadcasts of Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers games. Telus has been the title sponsor of the Telus Skins Game in addition to several tournaments on the Canadian Tour, including the Telus Open, Telus Calgary Open, Telus Edmonton Open and the Telus Vancouver Open.

Telus is the namesake tenant in several office buildings, including The Telus Convention Centre and Telus Sky in Calgary, Tour Telus in Montreal, Telus House in Edmonton, Telus Garden in Vancouver, the currently under construction Telus Ocean in Victoria, and Telus Harbour in Toronto.

Beginning in 2014, Telus began sponsoring Canada&#x27;s largest nationwide technology education event: The HTML500.

In November 2017, Telus announced it would take over as title sponsor for the Vancouver Santa Claus Parade, saving the parade from being cancelled.

Telus is also the sponsor for the PEPS multifunctional stadium of Université Laval, in Quebec City. This 12,750-seat stadium is the home of the Laval Rouge et Or U Sports football team.

<doc id="160076" wikidata="Q4457949" url="?curid=160076" title="Combinatorial species">
<text>In combinatorial mathematics, the theory of combinatorial species is an abstract, systematic method for deriving the generating functions of discrete structures, which allows one to not merely count these structures but give bijective proofs involving them. Examples of combinatorial species are () graphs, permutations, trees, and so on; each of these has an associated generating function which counts how many structures there are of a certain size. One goal of species theory is to be able to analyse complicated structures by describing them in terms of transformations and combinations of simpler structures. These operations correspond to equivalent manipulations of generating functions, so producing such functions for complicated structures is much easier than with other methods. The theory was introduced, carefully elaborated and applied by Canadian researchers around André Joyal.

The power of the theory comes from its level of abstraction. The &quot;description format&quot; of a structure (such as adjacency list versus adjacency matrix for graphs) is irrelevant, because species are purely algebraic. Category theory provides a useful language for the concepts that arise here, but it is not necessary to understand categories before being able to work with species.

The category of species is equivalent to the category of symmetric sequences in finite sets.

==Definition of species==
Any species consists of individual combinatorial structures built on the elements of some finite set: for example, a combinatorial graph is a structure of edges among a given set of vertices, and the species of graphs includes all graphs on all finite sets. Furthermore, a member of a species can have its underying set relabeled by the elements of any other equinumerous set, for example relabeling the vertices of a graph gives &quot;the same graph structure&quot; on the new vertices, i.e. an isomorphic graph.

This leads to the formal definition of a &quot;combinatorial species&quot;. Let formula_1 be the category of finite sets, with the morphisms of the category being the bijections between these sets. A &quot;species&quot; is a functor

:formula_2

For each finite set &quot;A&quot; in formula_1, the finite set &quot;F&quot;[&quot;A&quot;] is called the set of &quot;F&quot;-structures on &quot;A&quot;, or the set of structures of species &quot;F&quot; on &quot;A&quot;. Further, by the definition of a functor, if φ is a bijection between sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, then &quot;F&quot;[φ] is a bijection between the sets of &quot;F&quot;-structures &quot;F&quot;[&quot;A&quot;] and &quot;F&quot;[&quot;B&quot;], called &quot;transport of F-structures along φ&quot;.

For example, the &quot;species of permutations&quot; maps each finite set &quot;A&quot; to the set &quot;S&quot;[&quot;A&quot;] of all permutations of &quot;A&quot; (all ways of ordering &quot;A&quot; into a list), and each bijection &quot;f&quot; from &quot;A&quot; to another set &quot;B&quot; naturally induces a bijection (a relabeling) taking each permutation of &quot;A&quot; to a corresponding permutation of &quot;B&quot;, namely a bijection formula_4. Similarly, the &quot;species of partitions&quot; can be defined by assigning to each finite set the set of all its partitions, and the &quot;power set species&quot; assigns to each finite set its power set. The adjacent diagram shows a structure (represented by a red dot) built on a set of five distinct elements (represented by blue dots); a corresponding structure could be built out of any five elements.

Two finite sets are in bijection whenever they have the same cardinality (number of elements); thus by definition the corresponding species sets are also in bijection, and the (finite) cardinality of formula_5 depends only on the cardinality of &quot;A&quot;. In particular, the &quot;exponential generating series&quot; &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) of a species &quot;F&quot; can be defined:
:formula_6
where formula_7 is the cardinality of formula_5 for any set &quot;A&quot; having &quot;n&quot; elements; e.g., formula_9.

Some examples: writing formula_10,
* The species of sets (traditionally called &quot;E&quot;, from the French &quot;ensemble&quot;, meaning &quot;set&quot;) is the functor which maps &quot;A&quot; to {&quot;A&quot;}. Then formula_11, so formula_12.
* The species &quot;S&quot; of permutations, described above, has formula_13. formula_14. 
* The species &quot;T&quot;2 of ordered pairs (2-tuples) is the functor taking a set &quot;A&quot; to &quot;A&quot;2. Then formula_15 and formula_16.

==Calculus of species==
Arithmetic on generating functions corresponds to certain &quot;natural&quot; operations on species. The basic operations are addition, multiplication, composition, and differentiation; it is also necessary to define equality on species. Category theory already has a way of describing when two functors are equivalent: a natural isomorphism. In this context, it just means that for each &quot;A&quot; there is a bijection between &quot;F&quot;-structures on &quot;A&quot; and &quot;G&quot;-structures on &quot;A&quot;, which is &quot;well-behaved&quot; in its interaction with transport. Species with the same generating function might not be isomorphic, but isomorphic species do always have the same generating function.

=== Addition ===
Addition of species is defined by the disjoint union of sets, and corresponds to a choice between structures. For species &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot;, define (&quot;F&quot; + &quot;G&quot;)[&quot;A&quot;] to be the disjoint union (also written &quot;+&quot;) of &quot;F&quot;[&quot;A&quot;] and &quot;G&quot;[&quot;A&quot;]. It follows that (&quot;F&quot; + &quot;G&quot;)(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) + &quot;G&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). As a demonstration, take &quot;E&quot;+ to be the species of non-empty sets, whose generating function is &quot;E&quot;+(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;e&quot;&quot;x&quot; − 1, and 1 the species of the empty set, whose generating function is 1(&quot;x&quot;) = 1. It follows that the sum of the two species &quot;E&quot; = 1 + &quot;E&quot;+: in words, &quot;a set is either empty or non-empty&quot;. Equations like this can be read as referring to a single structure, as well as to the entire collection of structures.

===Multiplication ===
Multiplying species is slightly more complicated. It is possible to just take the Cartesian product of sets as the definition, but the combinatorial interpretation of this is not quite right. (See below for the use of this kind of product.) Rather than putting together two unrelated structures on the same set, the multiplication operator uses the idea of splitting the set into two components, constructing an &quot;F&quot;-structure on one and a &quot;G&quot;-structure on the other.
:formula_17
This is a disjoint union over all possible binary partitions of &quot;A&quot;. It is straightforward to show that multiplication is associative and commutative (up to isomorphism), and distributive over addition. As for the generating series, (&quot;F&quot; · &quot;G&quot;)(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)&quot;G&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).

The diagram below shows one possible (&quot;F&quot; · &quot;G&quot;)-structure on a set with five elements. The &quot;F&quot;-structure (red) picks up three elements of the base set, and the &quot;G&quot;-structure (light blue) takes the rest. Other structures will have &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; splitting the set in a different way. The set (&quot;F&quot; · &quot;G&quot;)[&quot;A&quot;], where &quot;A&quot; is the base set, is the disjoint union of all such structures.

The addition and multiplication of species are the most comprehensive expression of the sum and product rules of counting.

===Composition===
Composition, also called substitution, is more complicated again. The basic idea is to replace components of &quot;F&quot; with &quot;G&quot;-structures, forming (&quot;F&quot; ∘ &quot;G&quot;). As with multiplication, this is done by splitting the input set &quot;A&quot;; the disjoint subsets are given to &quot;G&quot; to make &quot;G&quot;-structures, and the set of subsets is given to &quot;F&quot;, to make the &quot;F&quot;-structure linking the &quot;G&quot;-structures. It is required for &quot;G&quot; to map the empty set to itself, in order for composition to work. The formal definition is:

:formula_18

Here, &quot;P&quot; is the species of partitions, so &quot;P&quot;[&quot;A&quot;] is the set of all partitions of &quot;A&quot;. This definition says that an element of (&quot;F&quot; ∘ &quot;G&quot;)[&quot;A&quot;] is made up of an &quot;F&quot;-structure on some partition of &quot;A&quot;, and a &quot;G&quot;-structure on each component of the partition. The generating series is formula_19.

One such structure is shown below. Three &quot;G&quot;-structures (light blue) divide up the five-element base set between them; then, an &quot;F&quot;-structure (red) is built to connect the &quot;G&quot;-structures.

These last two operations may be illustrated by the example of trees. First, define &quot;X&quot; to be the species &quot;singleton&quot; whose generating series is &quot;X&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;. Then the species &quot;Ar&quot; of rooted trees (from the French &quot;arborescence&quot;) is defined recursively by &quot;Ar&quot; = &quot;X&quot; · &quot;E&quot;(&quot;Ar&quot;). This equation says that a tree consists of a single root and a set of (sub-)trees. The recursion does &quot;not&quot; need an explicit base case: it only generates trees in the context of being applied to some finite set. One way to think about this is that the &quot;Ar&quot; functor is being applied repeatedly to a &quot;supply&quot; of elements from the set — each time, one element is taken by &quot;X&quot;, and the others distributed by &quot;E&quot; among the &quot;Ar&quot; subtrees, until there are no more elements to give to &quot;E&quot;. This shows that algebraic descriptions of species are quite different from type specifications in programming languages like Haskell.

Likewise, the species &quot;P&quot; can be characterised as &quot;P&quot; = &quot;E&quot;(&quot;E&quot;+): &quot;a partition is a pairwise disjoint set of nonempty sets (using up all the elements of the input set)&quot;. The exponential generating series for &quot;P&quot; is formula_20, which is the series for the Bell numbers.

===Differentiation===
Differentiation of species intuitively corresponds to building &quot;structures with a hole&quot;, as shown in the illustration below.

Formally,

:formula_21

where formula_22 is some distinguished new element not present in formula_23.

To differentiate the associated exponential series, the sequence of coefficients needs to be shifted one place to the &quot;left&quot; (losing the first term). This suggests a definition for species: &quot;F&#x27; &quot;[&quot;A&quot;] = &quot;F&quot;[&quot;A&quot; + {*}], where {*} is a singleton set and &quot;+&quot; is disjoint union. The more advanced parts of the theory of species use differentiation extensively, to construct and solve differential equations on species and series. The idea of adding (or removing) a single part of a structure is a powerful one: it can be used to establish relationships between seemingly unconnected species.

For example, consider a structure of the species &quot;L&quot; of linear orders—lists of elements of the ground set. Removing an element of a list splits it into two parts (possibly empty); in symbols, this is &quot;L&quot;&#x27; = &quot;L&quot;·&quot;L&quot;. The exponential generating function of &quot;L&quot; is &quot;L&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 1/(1 − &quot;x&quot;), and indeed:

:formula_24

The generalized differentiation formulas are to be found in a previous research by N. G. de Bruijn, published in 1964.

The species &quot;C&quot; of cyclic permutations takes a set &quot;A&quot; to the set of all cycles on &quot;A&quot;. Removing a single element from a cycle reduces it to a list: &quot;C&quot;&#x27; = &quot;L&quot;. We can integrate the generating function of &quot;L&quot; to produce that for &quot;C&quot;.

:formula_25

A nice example of integration of a species is the completion of a line (coordinatizated by a field) with the infinite point and obtaining a projective line.

===Further operations===
There are a variety of other manipulations which may be performed on species. These are necessary to express more complicated structures, such as directed graphs or bigraphs.

Pointing selects a single element in a structure. Given a species &quot;F&quot;, the corresponding pointed species &quot;F&quot;• is defined by &quot;F&quot;•[&quot;A&quot;] = &quot;A&quot; × &quot;F&quot;[&quot;A&quot;]. Thus each &quot;F&quot;•-structure is an &quot;F&quot;-structure with one element distinguished. Pointing is related to differentiation by the relation &quot;F&quot;• = &quot;X&quot;·&quot;F&#x27; &quot;, so &quot;F&quot;•(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; &quot;F&#x27; &quot;(&quot;x&quot;). The species of pointed sets, &quot;E&quot;•, is particularly important as a building block for many of the more complex constructions.

The Cartesian product of two species is a species which can build two structures on the same set at the same time. It is different from the ordinary multiplication operator in that all elements of the base set are shared between the two structures. An (&quot;F&quot; × &quot;G&quot;)-structure can be seen as a superposition of an &quot;F&quot;-structure and a &quot;G&quot;-structure. Bigraphs could be described as the superposition of a graph and a set of trees: each node of the bigraph is part of a graph, and at the same time part of some tree that describes how nodes are nested. The generating function (&quot;F&quot; × &quot;G&quot;)(&quot;x&quot;) is the Hadamard or coefficient-wise product of &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;G&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).

The species &quot;E&quot;• × &quot;E&quot;• can be seen as making two independent selections from the base set. The two points might coincide, unlike in &quot;X&quot;·&quot;X&quot;·&quot;E&quot;, where they are forced to be different.

As functors, species &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; may be combined by functorial composition: formula_26 (the box symbol is used, because the circle is already in use for substitution). This constructs an &quot;F&quot;-structure on the set of all &quot;G&quot;-structures on the set &quot;A&quot;. For example, if &quot;F&quot; is the functor taking a set to its power set, a structure of the composed species is some subset of the &quot;G&quot;-structures on &quot;A&quot;. If we now take &quot;G&quot; to be &quot;E&quot;• × &quot;E&quot;• from above, we obtain the species of directed graphs, with self-loops permitted. (A directed graph is a set of edges, and edges are pairs of nodes: so a graph is a subset of the set of pairs of elements of the node set &quot;A&quot;.) Other families of graphs, as well as many other structures, can be defined in this way.

==Software==
Operations with species are supported by SageMath and, using a special package, also by Haskell.

== Variants ==
* A species &quot;in k sorts&quot; is a functor formula_27. Here, the structures produced can have elements drawn from distinct sources.
* A functor to formula_28, the category of &quot;R&quot;-weighted sets for &quot;R&quot; a ring of power series, is a &quot;weighted species&quot;.

If “finite sets with bijections” is replaced with “finite vector spaces with linear transformations”, then one gets the notion of polynomial functor (after imposing some finiteness condition).

<doc id="160077" wikidata="Q3076740" url="?curid=160077" title="For Better or For Worse">
<text>For Better or For Worse is a Canadian comic strip by Lynn Johnston that ran originally from 1979 to 2008 chronicling the lives of the Patterson family and their friends, in the town of Milborough, a fictional suburb of Toronto, Ontario. Now running as reruns, &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot; is still seen in over 2,000 newspapers throughout Canada, the U.S., Mexico and around twenty other countries.

==History and background==
Johnston&#x27;s strip began in September 1979 and ended its original daily black-and-white run on August 30, 2008, with a postscript epilogue (as a full-colour Sunday strip) running the following day. Starting on September 1, 2008, the strip began re-telling its original story, using a mixture of straight reruns and retouched strips which featured altered dialogue. This new format, however, was dropped after less than two years and in July 2010, the strip switched entirely to reruns (with some minor alterations). The strips seen in papers in 2016 were originally from 1987.

A signature element of &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot; during its original run was that the characters aged in real time. The strip&#x27;s title is a reference to the marriage service found in the Anglican &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; as well as in the wedding ceremonies of other faith traditions:

...to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health...

Johnston&#x27;s work on the comic strip earned her a Reuben Award in 1985 and made her a nominated finalist for a Pulitzer Prize in editorial cartooning in 1994. The strip led the Friends of Lulu to add Johnston to the Women Cartoonists Hall of Fame in 2002. In the same year, Will Eisner described &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot; as &quot;the best strip around currently,&quot; saying &quot;It&#x27;s humane, human, it has humor to it, and good artwork.&quot;

==Characters==
===Original characters===
The strip focuses on a family known as the Pattersons:

* &quot;Elly Patterson&quot; (née &quot;Richards&quot;) is a stressed woman yet loving wife and mother of three. Elly tried night classes, writing columns for a small local paper, and periodically filling in as a dental assistant in John&#x27;s office before landing a job in a library. Nearing menopause, Elly was surprised to learn she was pregnant with their daughter, April. After the library job ended, Elly began working in a book store which she and John eventually bought and expanded to include toys and hobby supplies (such as model railroads). She then sold the store to her friend and began retirement.
* &quot;John Patterson&quot; is the husband to the strip&#x27;s protagonist Elly. A mild-mannered dentist and loyal family man who is a big kid at heart. Over time he develops interests in cars and model railroads, even going so far as to try and run them through the house and back to his workshop.
* &quot;Michael Patterson&quot; started in the strip as a rambunctious preschooler, who grew from a fresh little boy to a sullen teenager and became a good, mature young man. Michael became a freelance writer, married to his childhood crush Deanna Sobinski and is a father to daughter Meredith and son Robin.
* &quot;Elizabeth Patterson&quot; started in the strip as a bratty and demanding toddler, growing to a cute little girl, to an awkward preadolescent, to a confident and bright young woman. When the original series of strips ended, she was a teacher who had just married her ex-boyfriend Anthony Caine and became stepmother to his daughter, Françoise. Elizabeth gave birth to a son, James Allen Caine, whom she and her husband named in honour of her grandfather&#x27;s death.

In 1991, a third child was born:
* &quot;April Patterson&quot; is the youngest, and so named because she was born on April Fool&#x27;s Day, 1991. She nearly drowned during a spring flood when she was four years old: the family sheepdog Farley lost his own life while saving her. She developed over the years into a bright tomboy who was a talented musician with a love of animals. When the original series ended, she was about to go off to university to study veterinary medicine.

As John and Elly&#x27;s children grew older, the strip started to focus on neighbours and friends as well, creating an ever-changing roster of characters.

The comic&#x27;s main characters were initially based upon Johnston&#x27;s real family, but Johnston has made significant changes. When her children were younger, she asked their permission before depicting events from their lives; and she only once used a &quot;serious&quot; story from their lives, when Michael and Josef photographed an accident before Michael realized he knew the victim. Unlike Deanna, the real-life victim did not survive. Johnston says that she dealt with the bad news of her own infertility by creating a new child (April Patterson) for the strip.

==Key storylines==
The fictional suburban town of Milborough is located near Lake Simcoe. On the &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot; website, Milborough is described as being about a 45-minute to one-hour drive from Toronto and resembling Newmarket or Etobicoke, and a location map places the town on Highway 12 near Cannington and Beaverton in the northernmost part of Durham Region. The family&#x27;s house is located on Sharon Park Drive. 

Otherwise, the Canadian aspects of the strip&#x27;s story setting is normally presented subtly in details such as the presence of institutions such as Canada Post and practices such as the family buying milk in milk bags, a common packaging in Ontario for that grocery item. However, one major exception Johnston indulged in was having Michael take his post-secondary education in the city of London, Ontario, a mid-sized city 300 km west of Toronto. Johnston chose that setting considering a native of the province of Ontario could choose that city with its major educational institutions such as Fanshawe College and the University of Western Ontario, while its distance would allow Michael to have some length from his parents; yet still be within driving distance for vacations and summer breaks. Furthermore, Johnston also intended that story turn as partially a prank, anticipating ignorant readers to assume that Michael was studying in the city of London in Britain and enjoying imagining those people being embarrassed when the regional geography is explained to them. Johnston later confessed it had backfired on her and she had been fooled along with her targeted crowd when she got a congratulatory letter from Texas along with an earlier strip showing Michael in a cowboy hat, saying the Lone Star State would be a great place to tend to his education. Johnston jokingly remarked she got a taste of her own medicine and realization she did not know all regional geography, due to the other community of the same name. For their part, the citizenry of London, Ontario welcomed their city&#x27;s inclusion in the strip, including an official welcome from the University of Western Ontario when Michael switched to that institution.

In the comic&#x27;s quarter century, the strip has featured a variety of storylines, as the characters and their friends age. These include Elly&#x27;s return to the paid work force (&quot;The Last Straw&quot;), John&#x27;s midlife crisis, the birth of a friend&#x27;s six-fingered daughter (&quot;Keep The Home Fries Burning&quot;), Elizabeth wearing glasses (&quot;What, Me Pregnant&quot;), friends&#x27; divorces and relocating to distant towns, the coming out of Michael&#x27;s best friend Lawrence Poirier (&quot;There Goes My Baby&quot;), child abuse (perpetrated by Gordon&#x27;s alcoholic parents), the death of Elly&#x27;s mother Marian Richards (&quot;Sunshine and Shadow&quot;), and Elizabeth&#x27;s experience with sexual harassment and assault at the hands of a co-worker (&quot;Home Sweat Home&quot;).

The strip has shown a multiracial cast, intended to reflect Canada&#x27;s demographics. While the Pattersons are a typical white English-language family, there have been recurring characters of diverse backgrounds (with cultures), including African-Caribbean, Asian, Latin American, Franco-Ontarian and First Nations ethnicities. Elizabeth&#x27;s favourite high school teacher, who inspired her to study education herself, was paraplegic.

Other issues are also addressed. During her second year at college, Elizabeth moves in with her boyfriend, Eric Chamberlain, but promises not to cohabit. Elizabeth later breaks up with Eric when she finds out he is cheating on her. Storylines sometimes concern the Pattersons dealing with difficult acquaintances such as Thérèse, the ex-wife of Elizabeth&#x27;s friend Anthony, who resents Elizabeth&#x27;s presence, or the helicopter parenting of Deanna&#x27;s mother, Mira Sobinski.

===Farley&#x27;s death===
Since the comic happens in real time, it became apparent that the Pattersons&#x27; first Old English Sheepdog, Farley, was starting to get fairly old. When he is 14 years old (April 18, 1995), Farley saves four-year-old April from drowning in a stream near the Patterson home. Farley cannot take the shock of the cold water or the exertion of saving April and dies of a heart attack after getting April to shore.

The death provoked a lot of reaction from fans. &quot;People&#x27;s emotions were kind of raw,&quot; said Johnston of the time. &quot;I received 2,500 letters, about one-third negative. I didn&#x27;t expect the response to be so great. The letters were open and emotional and honest and personal, full of stories and love.&quot;

When Johnston told fellow cartoonist (and close friend) Charles M. Schulz that Farley was going to die, Schulz jokingly &quot;threatened to have Snoopy hit by a truck if Johnston went through with the plan&quot;. In the end, Johnston kept the timing of Farley&#x27;s death a secret from Schulz.

The official &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot; website has a section dedicated to Farley; this includes the strips depicting his heroism and death, plus a selection of &quot;Farley&#x27;s Spirit&quot; strips. Farley was also named after Canadian author Farley Mowat, a long-time friend of Johnston.

Johnston has allowed the Ontario Veterinary Medical Association (OVMA) to use Farley&#x27;s name and likeness for the &quot;Farley Foundation&quot;, a charity established by OVMA to subsidize the cost of veterinary care for pets of low-income seniors and persons with disabilities in Ontario.

===Lawrence comes out===

Michael Boncoeur, a friend of Johnston&#x27;s, had been murdered in Toronto in 1991. Although the murder was not over Boncoeur&#x27;s homosexuality, there were some homophobic attitudes seen in the media coverage of it, and Johnston felt that a gay character should be brought into the strip to help combat anti-gay stereotypes and discrimination. 

In April 1993, Lawrence Poirier&#x27;s coming out generated controversy, with readers opposed to homosexuality threatening to cancel newspaper subscriptions. Johnston did receive supportive mail on the issue generally from social workers and politicians, who praised her for portraying it with realism and avoiding vulgarity. Opposed readers who believed that a homosexual character was highly inappropriate for a family-oriented strip wrote Johnston many letters. While few letters were vicious, Johnston did say that many who opposed the story arc did so in a poignant manner. Johnston said one that was particularly hurtful was from a longtime fan who said she felt it was against her conscience to continue reading the strip; the woman&#x27;s letter did not have any foul remarks, but the envelope contained returned yellowed &quot;FBoFW&quot; strips the fan had kept for a long time on her refrigerator. Over 100 newspapers (including New Hampshire&#x27;s &quot;Union Leader&quot;) ran replacement strips during this part of the story or cancelled the comic altogether. Much more favourable was the article &quot;Coming Out in the Comic Strips&quot;, by David Applegate, editor of the Comic &amp; Fantasy Art Amateur Press Association, which ran in Hogan&#x27;s Alley No. 1. The following year, Lawrence introduced his boyfriend, giving rise to another, though smaller, uproar.

Explaining her decision to have Lawrence come out as gay, Johnston said that she had found the character, one of Michael&#x27;s closest friends, gradually &quot;harder and harder to bring... into the picture&quot;. Based on the fact the Pattersons were an average family in an average neighbourhood, she felt it only natural to introduce this element in Lawrence&#x27;s character, and have the characters deal with the situation. After two years of development, Johnston contacted her editor, Lee Salem. Salem advised Johnston to send the strips well ahead of time so that he could review the plot and suggest any necessary changes. So long as there was no overt or licentious material, and Johnston was fully aware of what she was doing, Universal Press would support the action. Johnston&#x27;s personal reflections on Lawrence, an excerpt from the comic collection &quot;It&#x27;s the Thought That Counts...&quot;, are included on the strip&#x27;s official webpage.

One result of the storyline was that Johnston was made a jury-selected &quot;nominated finalist&quot; for the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning in 1994. The Pulitzer board said the strip &quot;sensitively depicted a youth&#x27;s disclosure of his homosexuality and its effect on his family and friends.&quot;

The story goes that Connie adopts a dog to deal with her pre-empty-nest syndrome, and as Michael and Lawrence are talking about her desire for grandchildren, Lawrence mentions that he probably will not be giving her any, and then confesses that he&#x27;s in a relationship, but with another young man. Michael reacts in disbelief to the news and struggles to understand. Realizing that Lawrence is not &quot;hot for him&quot;, Michael understands Lawrence sees him as a friend and not a lover. Michael then insists that Lawrence needs to tell his parents. Lawrence himself is unsure of this, claiming that he really ought to see his family&#x27;s view on homosexuals and that it could be hurtful to them if he comes out, which is not his intent, but Michael retorts, &quot;it&#x27;ll be a lie if you don&#x27;t&quot;. Hearing the news, Connie reacts with desperate denial, then orders her husband Greg to speak to him. Greg throws Lawrence out of the house, challenging him to see if &quot;his kind&quot; will take care of him the way Connie and Greg have all these years.

In the middle of the night, Elly wakens Michael and tells him to find Lawrence (as he was the primary instigator). Connie and Greg fought for hours over Greg&#x27;s banishment of Lawrence, and now Connie simply wants Lawrence back. Michael locates his friend at a donut shop, where they talk until dawn, and Lawrence ultimately returns home, welcomed by Connie and an apologetic Greg, who tells Lawrence that he accepts him as long as his son endeavours to be a good man, and address life afterward with &quot;Que Sera Sera&quot;. From this, Connie decides to name the new dog &quot;Sera&quot;. Johnston had originally stated she was going to address the issue once then leave it alone; however, she eventually wrote future story arcs about Lawrence&#x27;s homosexuality.

In 2001, when Michael chose Lawrence to be best man at his wedding to Deanna, Johnston ran two sets of comic strips. In the primary storyline, Deanna&#x27;s mother Mira Sobinski objects to having a gay man in the wedding party, while in the alternate storyline, which used the same art but modified the dialogue, she instead objects to the flowers that Lawrence, by this time a professional landscape architect, has given Michael and Deanna to decorate the church. The alternate storyline was for newspapers who had not originally published the 1993 debut of Lawrence&#x27;s homosexuality.

In 2007 when she was asked about why she did the storyline, Johnston said,

===Mtigwaki===
Mtigwaki is a fictional Ojibwe community in Northern Ontario near Lake Nipigon, where Elizabeth Patterson taught from 2004 to 2006. While in school, Elizabeth took a practice teaching job in Garden Village near North Bay.

The community was created with &quot;Baloney &amp; Bannock&quot; comic creator Perry McLeod-Shabogesic, of the N&#x27;biising Nation (Anishinabek Crane Clan). McLeod-Shabogesic worked with Johnston to create an authentic world for the characters to inhabit. His son, Falcon Skye McLeod-Shabogesic, created the Mtigwaki First Nation&#x27;s logo, which is inspired in part by a dreamcatcher, and his wife Laurie assisted Johnston with the Ojibwa language and was written directly into the strip as a teaching assistant in Elizabeth&#x27;s classroom. Mtigwaki is shown like many Indigenous villages, with private houses, a meeting hall, a medical station and a casino.

For the series of strips in Mtigwaki, Johnston was awarded the Debwewin Citation for excellence in Aboriginal issues journalism by the Union of Ontario Indians in 2004.

==2007 and 2008 changes==
Johnston had planned to retire in the fall of 2007, but in January 2007, she announced that she instead would be tweaking her strip&#x27;s format beginning September 2007. Storylines would now focus primarily on the second-generation family of one of the original children; scenes and artwork from older strips would be reused in new contexts; and the characters would stop aging. Johnston announced that the changes were to provide more time for travel and to accommodate health problems, including a neurological condition (dystonia) she controlled with medication.

In September 2007, Johnston said she and her husband, Rod, were separated and probably would divorce, telling the &quot;Kansas City Star&quot;,

... I have a new life. My husband and I have separated. I am now free to do just about anything I want to do. We still communicate. We still have children in common. It’s a positive thing for both of us. And I just see so many things in the future.
But when asked if this would be a storyline for the strip, Johnston replied, &quot;No, not a chance. I only want to live through this once.&quot; Johnston said in September 2007 that she would continue to produce new installments.

The changes in the strip over the next year were not major, although, as announced, the stories did focus more on Michael, Elizabeth and April than on Elly and John.

During the summer of 2008, Elizabeth and Anthony carry out their wedding plans, which culminate in a ceremony that takes place in late August. This joyous occasion is marred by a crisis: Grandpa Jim has had another heart attack. Elizabeth hears about this after the ceremony and visits her grandfather and her step-grandmother, Iris, in the hospital. Jim is hanging on and responding with his post-stroke responses of &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot;. In the final daily strip, Iris gives advice to Elizabeth and Anthony, who are both touched by her devotion to Jim. The strip concluded with Iris saying &quot;It&#x27;s a promise that should last a lifetime. It defines you as a person and describes your soul. It&#x27;s a promise to be there, one for the other, no matter what happens, no matter who falls ... For better or for worse, my dears ... for better or for worse&quot;. This final daily strip had a message from Lynn Johnston saying, &quot;This concludes my story ... with grateful thanks to everyone who has made this all possible. ~Lynn Johnston&quot;.

The Sunday strip on August 31, 2008, revealed what each character would do in years to come. Elly and John retire to travel, volunteer in the community, and help raise their four grandchildren. Elizabeth continues to teach. She and Anthony have a child, James Allen, presumably named in honour of his great-grandfather Jim Richards. Grandpa Jim lives to welcome the child, then passes away at age 89 with Iris at his bedside. Anthony continues to manage Mayes Motors and its various related businesses, introduces Elizabeth to ballroom dancing, and hopes to eventually open a bed-and-breakfast. Michael has four books published before signing a film contract. Deanna opens a sewing school and teaches Robin how to cook. Meredith enters dance and theatre. April graduates from university with a degree in veterinary medicine. Following her established love of horses, she gets a job in Calgary working with the Calgary Stampede, continues to live in western Canada, and has an unnamed boyfriend there.

==Reruns==
In the last panel of the strip&#x27;s original run (August 31, 2008), along with a caricature of herself at the drawing table, Lynn Johnston thanked everyone for supporting her and concluded with, &quot;If I could do it all over again... Would I do some things differently?... I&#x27;ve been given the chance to find out!! Please join me on Monday as the story begins again... With new insights and new smiles. Looking back looks wonderful!&quot;

The next day, September 1, &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot; ran as usual, but Michael was once again a small boy, asking his young mother, Elly, to get him a puppy. This began what Johnston called &quot;new-runs&quot;, restarting her storyline with a roughly 50/50 mixture of reruns of early strips, and re-workings of 1980s strips that featured the original artwork (sometimes slightly retouched) with new dialogue. The time frame appeared to be 29 years before the present day; the family is correspondingly younger. Michael looks to be about five or six years old, Elizabeth is a small child learning to talk, and the family is also raising a puppy.

For the next 22 months, the strip ran in this format. On July 12, 2010, without fanfare, the strip quietly switched to straight reruns of material from the 1980s. However, these straight reruns have had slight alterations as well. The daily strips, which were originally inked, have been digitally colourized. In the December 31, 2012, installment, dialogue that referred to the initial date of publication (1984) was altered, so that the strip was seen to be taking place in the present day. Another slight touch up to show a present-day timeline is where a child Michael invites his friends over to play on a video game console he recently got as a present and they are seen using a Wii; in the original strip a second generation video game console was played. Some strips have had altered panels, in particular those dealing with child discipline, because of the increased social and cultural opposition to corporal punishment. Occasionally in the original strips Michael or Elizabeth would be spanked. The new strips have modified the artwork to eliminate the device of stars coming out children&#x27;s butts denoting the after-effect of a spanking, or in certain cases, have made a whole new panel to change the punishment to a &quot;time out&quot; (being made to sit in a corner or like isolation) instead of a spanking.

This format continues, with strips being republished approximately 29 years after their initial appearance.

==Legacy==

The strip is perhaps best known for the fact that, unlike most comic strips, it took place more or less in real time for most of its run. Michael and Elizabeth were a young child and a toddler at the strip&#x27;s beginning, and by the end had grown into adults, with Michael married and raising his own children while Elizabeth married at the end of the strip. The youngest child, April, was born 11 years into the strip&#x27;s run and was 17 at the strip&#x27;s conclusion.

During its run, the strip was also celebrated for its realism, eschewing cartoon stereotypes in favour of a nuanced, relatable look at typical adult, child and teen concerns. For example, in the early 2000s, there was a Western trend in which students as young as ten years old wore thong underwear above their pants. Johnston, in September 2004, used this trend as inspiration to create a new storyline in which the now eighth grade April and her friends returned to school to see the incoming sixth graders dressing in revealing clothing and exposing their thongs. Johnston herself did not need to look far for inspiration; she noted that “[w]e actually do get days that are warm enough for young girls to hang wildly out of their clothing…”

A storyline in which the supporting character Lawrence came out as gay cemented this reputation, as well as various stories dealing with prejudice, bullying, the mentally and physically handicapped, theft, cheating and abuse. The Pattersons were often shown as a good, &quot;normal&quot; family, often forced to deal with others from broken homes or worse situations.

==Animated series and specials==
In 1985, Atkinson Film-Arts of Ottawa, in association with the CTV Television Network, produced an animated Christmas special based on &quot;For Better or for Worse&quot; entitled &quot;The Bestest Present.&quot; In the USA, it was first broadcast on HBO, and in later years, on The Disney Channel. Lynn&#x27;s own children, Aaron and Katie, provided the voices of Michael and Elizabeth, and Rod Johnston made a cameo appearance as the voice of a mailman.

Beginning in 1992, another Ottawa-based studio, Lacewood Productions, produced six more specials, also for CTV. In the USA, these were seen on The Disney Channel. According to Lynn Johnston, the set designs (for instance, for the Pattersons&#x27; house) which these and subsequent television programs required led her to develop a much more sophisticated background style in the comic strips, with the layouts of homes and even towns consistent from story to story.

The six specials produced by Lacewood were:
* &quot;The Last Camping Trip&quot; (July 1992)
* &quot;The Good-for-Nothing&quot; (Halloween) (November 1992)
* &quot;A Christmas Angel&quot; (December 1992)
* &quot;A Valentine from the Heart&quot; (February 7, 1993)
* &quot;The Babe Magnet&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Sweet Deal&quot;) (September 1993)
* &quot;A Storm in April&quot; (June 1995)

In 2000, Ottawa&#x27;s Funbag Animation produced a new animated series for cable television network Teletoon, which began airing on November 5, 2000, and ran until December 16, 2001. Featuring introductions by Lynn Johnston herself, the show looked at three related storylines from three different eras of the strip—the mid-1980s, the early 1990s, and the late 1990s.

The series consisted of two seasons with eight episodes each. On March 23, 2004, Koch Vision released the complete series on DVD.

<text>Lynn Johnston (born May 28, 1947) is a Canadian cartoonist and author, best known for her newspaper comic strip &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot;. She was the first woman and first Canadian to win the National Cartoonist Society&#x27;s Reuben Award.

==Early life==
Born Lynn Ridgway in Collingwood, Ontario, she was raised in North Vancouver, British Columbia, where she was a close childhood friend of comedians Paul K. Willis and Michael Boncoeur. She attended the Vancouver School of Art (now Emily Carr University of Art and Design) with hopes of making a living as an artist. After working briefly in animation, most notably as an uncredited cel colorist on &quot;The Abbott and Costello Cartoon Show&quot;, she married in 1969 and moved back to Ontario, where she worked as a medical artist at McMaster University for five years. Johnston&#x27;s illustrations are in storage in McMaster&#x27;s medical archive. They include depictions of routine hospital happenings of the time, such as a father smoking in the waiting room.

While expecting her first child, she drew single-panel cartoons for the ceiling of her obstetrician Murray Enkin&#x27;s office. Those drawings were published in her first book, &quot;David, We&#x27;re Pregnant!&quot; which was published in 1973 under her then name of Lynn Franks (and subsequently republished under the name of Lynn Johnston) and became a best seller. After her divorce, she did freelance commercial and medical art in a studio converted from a greenhouse. &quot;Hi Mom! Hi Dad!&quot;, a sequel to &quot;David&quot;, was published in 1975. Shortly thereafter, she met and married dental student Rod Johnston.

==&quot;For Better or For Worse&quot;==

In 1978, the Johnstons and their two children relocated to Lynn Lake, Manitoba. She was asked by Universal Press Syndicate if she was interested in doing a comic strip. She sent twenty copies of a strip called &quot;The Johnstons&quot;, based on her family &quot;since we were the only people I knew I could draw over and over again with some consistency.&quot; Much to her surprise, the syndicate approved of the initial strips and offered her a twenty-year contract. After a six-month &quot;work-up&quot; period, the strip first appeared in newspapers throughout Canada under the title &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot;. The strip has been carried by about 2000 newspapers in Canada, the U.S. and 20 other countries.

Many story lines draw from her family&#x27;s real-life experiences. Her main characters are named after the middle names of her husband and children, with the exception of the mother, as Lynn Johnston has no middle name. Instead, she elected to name the protagonist Elly, in honor of a friend of hers who died at a young age. Her friend and Canadian comedian Michael Boncoeur inspired the controversial story about Lawrence&#x27;s coming out. Deanna was based on Aaron&#x27;s high school sweetheart, who died in a car accident years after their relationship ended. Johnston&#x27;s niece Stephanie is developmentally disabled and her experience is shared in recent story lines on the integration of developmentally disabled students in April&#x27;s class. Elizabeth&#x27;s teaching career was based on daughter Kate&#x27;s decision not to pursue a career in education, but provided Johnston with a chance to imagine how that might have turned out.

The characters in &quot;For Better of For Worse&quot; have aged in &quot;real time&quot;. On August 31, 2008, Johnston herself appeared in the Sunday strip, which was supposed to be the end of the cartoon, and announced that she would take the story back nearly 30 years to soon after its beginning, with half of the material to be new and the other half repeats. The &quot;new&quot; material was actually reworked versions of older strips with retouched artwork and new dialogue that was sometimes only tweaked to use modern expressions or product names in place of older ones. On seldom occasion an entire strip or a panel has been redone, such as Michael or Elizabeth spanked being turned into a &quot;time out&quot;. One spanking strip that remained was a story arc where Michael was spanked by John for hitting another child, and it percolating into a discussion with Elly that she disagreed that spanking was the proper remedy (although she agreed with John that Michael&#x27;s violent attitude had to be nipped in the bud). Other strips, such as Elly getting annoyed and then hurling something at the back of John&#x27;s head (such as a coffee cup) were also censored. As the strip was a family strip, issues of throwing a hard object behind someone&#x27;s back raised issues of spousal abuse.

==Personal life==
Since the 1990s, Johnston has been notably forthcoming in her discussion of the abuse inflicted on her by her mother and her first husband, and being unprepared to be a mother to her son Aaron—topics that have also been reflected in the strip. A column by Jan Wong of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, reprinted in &quot;Lunch with Jan Wong&quot;, notably portrayed Johnston as somewhat difficult and irascible.

Johnston resided in the Northern Ontario town of Corbeil for many years during &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot;″s run. Her daughter Katie also lived in Corbeil and worked at the For Better or For Worse studio, while her son Aaron works in the television industry in Vancouver, BC. In September 2007, Lynn and Rod Johnston announced their separation and intention to divorce. Johnston had talked about either ending &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot; or handing it off to another cartoonist, but changed her mind as a result of her split from her husband of over 30 years.

In September 2015, Johnston and her daughter moved back to North Vancouver.

Johnston had a close friendship with Charles M. Schulz, creator of &quot;Peanuts&quot;. She wrote the introduction to one of the volumes of Fantagraphics Books&#x27; series &quot;The Complete Peanuts&quot;.

On 13 March 2014, Library and Archives Canada announced that it had acquired material to add to its Johnston collection, including 3282 drawings, 296 watercolours, 244 photographs, about 3.5 m of textual items, and a few other objects.

<text>Brampton is a city in the Canadian province of Ontario, and the regional seat of the Regional Municipality of Peel. It is part of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and is a lower-tier municipality within the Peel Region. The city has a population of 656,480 as of the 2021 Census, making it the ninth most populous municipality in Canada and the third most populous city in the Greater Golden Horseshoe urban area, behind Toronto and Mississauga. The City of Brampton is bordered by Vaughan to the east, Halton Hills to the west, Caledon to the north, Mississauga to the south, and Etobicoke (Toronto) to the southeast.

Named after the town of Brampton in Cumberland, England, Brampton was incorporated as a village in 1853 and as a town in 1873, and became a city in 1974. The modern City of Brampton was formed following an amalgamation of several surrounding townships and communities. 

The city was once known as &quot;The Flower Town of Canada&quot;, a title referring to its abundance of greenhouses and strong floriculture industry in the 1860s. It maintains the term &quot;Flower City&quot; as its slogan. 

In recent times, the city has experienced large population growth. Despite being built as a car-centric city, Brampton has a significant transit system, with a ridership of 49,200,800, or about 226,500 per weekday as of the second quarter of 2024. Notably, the city is majority populated by people of South Asian origin.

==History==

Before the arrival of British settlers, the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation held of land north of the head of the Lake Purchase lands and extending to the unceded territory of the Chippewa of Lakes Huron and Simcoe. European settlers began to arrive in the area in the 1600s. In October 1818, the chief of the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation signed Treaty 19, also known as the Ajetance Purchase, surrendering the area to the British Crown.

Prior to the 1830s, most business in Chinguacousy Township took place at Martin Salisbury&#x27;s tavern. One mile from the corner of Hurontario Street and the 5th Sideroad (now Main and Queen Streets in the centre of Brampton), William Buffy&#x27;s tavern was the only significant building. At the time, the intersection was referred to as &quot;Buffy&#x27;s Corners&quot;. By 1834, John Elliott laid out the area in lots for sale, calling it &quot;Brampton&quot;, which was soon adopted by others.

In 1853, a small agricultural fair was set up by the newly initiated County Agricultural Society of the County of Peel and was held at the corner of Main and Queen streets. Grains, produce, roots, and dairy products were up for sale. Horses and cattle, along with other lesser livestock, were also sold at the market. This agricultural fair eventually became the modern Brampton Fall Fair.

In that same year, Brampton was incorporated as a village. In 1866, the town became the county seat and the location of the Peel County Courthouse which was built in 1865–66; a three-storey County jail was added at the rear in 1867.

Edward Dale, an immigrant from Dorking, England, established a flower nursery in Brampton shortly after his arrival in 1863. Dale&#x27;s Nursery became the town&#x27;s largest and most prominent employer, developed a flower grading system, and established a global export market for its products. The company chimney was a town landmark, until Brampton Town Council allowed it to be torn down in 1977. At its height, the company had 140 greenhouses, and was the largest cut flower business in North America, producing 20 million blooms and introducing numerous rose and orchid varietals and species to the market. It also spurred the development of other nurseries in the town. Forty-eight hothouse flower nurseries once did business in the town.
In January 1867, Peel County separated from the County of York, a union which had existed since 1851.
By 1869, Brampton had a population of 1,800. It was incorporated as a town in 1873.

A federal grant had enabled the village to found its first public library in 1887, which included 360 volumes from the Mechanic&#x27;s Institute (established in 1858). In 1907, the library received a grant from the Carnegie Foundation, set up by United States steel magnate and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, to build a new, expanded library; it serves several purposes, featuring the Brampton Library. The Carnegie libraries were built on the basis of communities coming up with matching funds and guaranteeing maintenance.

In 1902, Sir William J. Gage (owner of Gage Publishing, a publishing house specializing in school textbooks) purchased a portion of the gardens and lawns of the Alder Lea estate (now called Alderlea) that had been built on Main Street by Kenneth Chisolm in 1867 to 1870. (Chisholm, a merchant and founding father of Brampton, had been the Town reeve, then warden of Peel County, then MPP for Brampton and eventually, Registrar of Peel County.) Gage donated of the property to the town, with a specific condition that it be made into a park. Citizens donated $1,054 and the town used the funds to purchase extra land to ensure a larger park.

A group of regional farmers in Brampton had trouble getting insurance from city-based companies. After several meetings in Clairville Hall, they decided to found the County of Peel Farmers Mutual Fire Insurance Company. In 1955, when the company moved to its third and current location, 103 Queen Street West, it took the new name of Peel Mutual Insurance Company. It reigns as the longest-running company in modern Brampton. Harmsworth Decorating Centre was established in 1890, as Harmsworth and Son, operated out of the family&#x27;s house on Queen Street West. The current location was purchased on September 1, 1904, after a fire destroyed their original store. Purchased for $1,400, the 24 Main Street South location is the longest-operating retail business in what is now Brampton.

In 1974, the two townships of Chinguacousy and Toronto Gore were incorporated into Brampton. The small pine added to the centre of the shield on the Brampton city flag represents Chinguacousy, honouring the Chippewa chief &quot;Shinguacose,&quot; &quot;The Small Pine.&quot; After this merger, outlying communities such as Bramalea, Heart Lake and Professor&#x27;s Lake, Snelgrove, Tullamore, and Marysfield, were incorporated into the City, and in some instances further developed.

In 1963, the town established &quot;The Flower Festival of Brampton&quot;, based on the &quot;Rose Festival&quot; of Portland, Oregon, in the United States. It began to market itself as the &quot;Flower Town of Canada&quot;.

In a revival of this theme, on June 24, 2002, the City Council established the &quot;Flower City Strategy&quot;, to promote a connection to its flower-growing heritage. The intention was to inspire design projects and community landscaping to beautify the city, adopt a sustainable environmental approach, and to protect its natural and cultural heritage. The Rose Theatre was named in keeping with this vision and is to serve as a cultural institution in the city. In addition, the city participates in the national Communities in Bloom competition as part of that strategy.

The Old Shoe Factory, located on 57 Mill Street North, once housed the Hewetson Shoe Company. It was listed as a historical property under the Ontario Heritage Act in 2008. Today it is occupied by various small businesses. The lobby and hallways retain details from 1907. Walls are decorated with pictures and artifacts of local Brampton history and old shoemaking equipment.

A self-guided historical walking tour of downtown Brampton called &quot;A Walk Through Time&quot; is available at Brampton City Hall and online at no cost.

===Development of Bramalea===

Planned as an innovative &quot;new town&quot;, Bramalea was developed in the 1960s immediately east of the Town of Brampton in Chinguacousy Township. It was Canada&#x27;s first satellite community developed by one of the country&#x27;s largest real estate developers, &quot;Bramalea Limited.&quot; The name &quot;Bramalea&quot; was created by the farmer William Sheard, who combined &quot;BRAM&quot; from Brampton, &quot;MAL&quot; from Malton (then a neighbouring town which is now part of the city of Mississauga), and &quot;LEA&quot;, an Old English word meaning meadow or grassland. He sold the land to Brampton Leasing (the former name of the developer) and built one of Bramalea&#x27;s first houses on Dixie Road.

The community was developed according to its detailed master plan, which included provisions for a parkland trail system and a &quot;downtown&quot; to include essential services and a shopping centre. The downtown&#x27;s centrepiece was the Civic Centre, built in 1972 to include the city hall and library. Directly across Team Canada Drive, a shopping centre, Bramalea City Centre was built. These developments were connected by a long tunnel, planned to provide protection from winter weather. The tunnel has long since been closed due to safety issues.

===Region of Peel===
In 1974, the Ontario provincial government decided to update Peel County&#x27;s structure. It amalgamated several towns and villages into the new City of Mississauga. In addition, it created the present City of Brampton from the town and the greater portion of the Townships of Chinguacousy and Toronto Gore, and the northern extremity of Mississauga south of Steeles Avenue, including Bramalea and the other communities such as Churchville, Claireville, Ebenezer, Victoria, Springbrook, Coleraine, and Huttonville. While only Huttonville and Churchville still exist as identifiable communities, other names like Claireville are re-emerging as names of new developments.

The province converted Peel County into the Regional Municipality of Peel. Brampton retained its role as the administrative centre of Peel Region, which it already had as county seat. The regional council chamber, the Peel Regional Police force, the public health department, and the region&#x27;s only major museum, the Peel Art Gallery, Museum and Archives, are all located in Brampton.

This change had its critics among those with a strong sense of local identities. Bramptonians feared urban sprawl would dissolve their town&#x27;s personality. Bramalea residents took pride in the built-from-scratch and organised structure that had come with their new satellite city and did not want to give it up. Others in Bramalea accept they are part of Brampton, and they make up a &quot;tri-city&quot; area: the original Brampton, Heart Lake, Bramalea.

In 1972, Chinguacousy built a new civic centre in Bramalea. Two years later, when Brampton and Chinguacousy merged, the new city&#x27;s council was moved from its modest downtown Brampton locale to the Bramalea building. The library systems of Brampton and Chinguacousy were merged, resulting in a system of four locations.

Some have questioned the future of Peel Region as encompassing all of Brampton, Mississauga, and Caledon. The Mississauga council, led by Mayor Hazel McCallion, voted to become a single-tier municipality and asked the provincial government to be separated from Peel Region. They argued the city has outgrown the need for a regional layer of government, and that Mississauga is being held back by supporting Brampton and Caledon with its municipal taxes.

===Development as a city===


In the early 1980s, Cineplex Odeon closed the Capitol Theatre in Brampton. The City bought the facility in 1981 under the leadership of councillor Diane Sutter. It adapted the former vaudeville venue and movie house as a performing arts theatre, to be used also as a live music venue. It was renamed the Heritage Theatre. Renovations and maintenance were expensive. In 1983, Toronto consultants Woods Gordon reported to the City that, rather than continue &quot;pouring money&quot; into the Heritage, they should construct a new 750-seat facility with up-to-date features. This recommendation was adopted, and the city designated the 2005–06 season as the Heritage Theatre&#x27;s &quot;grand finale&quot; season. The city funded construction of the new Rose Theatre, which opened in September 2006.

Carabram was founded in 1982, the result of volunteers from different ethnic communities wanting to organize a festival celebrating diversity and cross-cultural friendship. The name was loosely related to Toronto&#x27;s Caravan Festival of Cultures. Carabram&#x27;s first event featured Italian, Scots, Ukrainian, and West Indian pavilions. By 2003, the fair had 18 pavilions attracting 45,000 visitors. 

Brampton has grown to become one of the most diverse cities in Canada. In 1996, the city was 13% South Asian and 8.2% black. By 2016, the South Asian community grew significantly to represent 44.3% of the city&#x27;s population, while the black population grew to 14%. Responding to a growing multi-cultural population, the Peel Board of Education introduced evening English as a Second Language (ESL) classes at high schools. Originally taught by volunteers, the classes eventually were scheduled as daytime courses taught by paid instructors. In the 1980s, the public and Catholic board expanded its language programs, offering night classes in 23 languages. These were introduced due to requests by parents, who wanted their children to learn their ancestral languages and heritage.

In the late 1980s, Mayor Ken Whillans gained approval and funding for the construction of a new city hall in Brampton&#x27;s downtown. The facility was designed by local architects and built on the site of a former bus terminal. Whillians did not get to see the opening of the new hall in June 1991 because of his death in August 1990. Its completion brought the municipal government back to downtown Brampton. The facility expanded in 2014 with the addition of a nine-storey tower at 41 George Street and is connected to the original building by a glass walkway called Heritage Way. 

In 1991, development of another new town, Springdale, began. In 1999, development started to appear as far north as the city&#x27;s border with Caledon along Mayfield Road. The Region designated this border as the line of demarcation for urban development until 2021, although development already began spilling north of Mayfield in the late 2010s. Part of the boundary between Brampton and Vaughan is also nearly completely urbanized.

Changes continue to reflect the growth of the city. In 1992 the City purchased the Brampton Fairgrounds, to be used for other development. The Agricultural Society relocated in 1997 outside the boundaries of the city to Heart Lake and Old School roads.

Brampton&#x27;s 2003 Sesquicentennial celebrations boosted community spirit, reviving the tradition of a summer parade (with 100 floats), and creating other initiatives. To commemorate the town&#x27;s history, the city under Mayor Fennell reintroduced floral projects to the community. These have included more plantings around town, the revival in 2005 of the city Parade, and participation in the Canada Communities in Bloom project.

In 2017, Davis added the Skilled Trades Centre, for training in skilled trades and apprenticeship programs, previously offered in Oakville.

A plan by Ryerson University, in partnership with Sheridan College was to establish a new campus in Brampton with a goal of opening in 2022 with $90 million in funding offered by the provincial government in April 2018. On 23 October 2018 however, the new Provincial government (elected in June) withdrew the funding for plans such as this, effectively cancelling the project. In 2022, the university, now renamed as Toronto Metropolitan, announced plans to open a medical school in Brampton.

The Rose Theatre (originally the Brampton Performing Arts Centre), opened in September 2006. The city had expected the facility to generate $2.7 million in economic activity the first year, growing to $19.8 million by the fifth year. The Rose Theatre far surpassed projections, attracting more than 137,000 patrons in its inaugural year, which exceeded its five-year goal. The arrival of so many new patrons downtown has stimulated the development of numerous new businesses nearby. A new Fountain Stage was unveiled in June 2008 at the nearby Garden Square.

===Media===

Brampton was one of the first areas where Rogers Cable offered its service. The city started a community access channel in the 1970s, which still operates. While some programs on the channel are produced in its Brampton studios, most are based in its Mississauga location. Christian specialty channel Vertical TV is based in Brampton.

&quot;The Brampton Guardian&quot; is the community&#x27;s only newspaper, starting as the Bramalea Guardian in 1964. The city&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;The Daily Times&quot;, stopped circulation in the early 1980s. For a little over a year, &quot;The Brampton Bulletin&quot; attempted to challenge the &quot;Guardian&quot;, but it was dismantled after a series of editor changes.

Brampton is the official city of license for two radio stations, CHLO and CFNY. Both stations address their programming toward the entire Greater Toronto Area rather than exclusively to Brampton. CFNY was located upstairs at 83 Kennedy Road until moving to Toronto in 1996.

<text>Visual Arts Brampton is a non-profit community art group located in Brampton, Ontario formed in 1986 to organize the arts community, providing workshops, and exhibits, among other things.

The group moved to its current studio in 1991.

The first juried show, under the guise of Brampton Arts Council, featured 68 artworks judged by Pamela Wachna, curator of Toronto&#x27;s Market Gallery.

==Galleries==
Visual Arts Brampton runs The Artway Family of Galleries, which includes Artway Gallery (established in 1998) and the Artway Invitational Gallery (established 2010), all in Shoppers World Brampton. Artway was previously in Bramalea City Centre.

The Chinguacousy branch of the Brampton Library had a gallery space, opened when the facility first did in 1971. The space had its own full-time curator until a renovation in the 1990s. The group managed booking for the space for around a year, before passing the responsibility on to the Art Gallery of Peel. It was slated for closure in 1996, and VAB petitioned to keep it open. After the closure, the non-profit fundraised to open a new space in Bramalea City Centre, City Centre Exhibit Space for a while, before being renamed Artway Gallery.

The group&#x27;s annual floral art exhibit, started in 2002 at the Brampton City Hall atrium gallery space. In 2010, the first year the group featured work exclusively created for the exhibit, the art toured from City Hall to Carabram&#x27;s Canada pavilion, Artway Invitational Gallery, the Canadian National Exhibition, and Brampton Library&#x27;s Four Corners branch.

<text>Turner Fenton Secondary School is a high school in the Peel Region, located in Brampton, Ontario, operated by the Peel District School Board. Turner Fenton Secondary School&#x27;s name is inherited from two schools that were later merged, which were named after J. A. Turner, the first director of the Peel board, and W. J. Fenton, a pioneer educator.

== Programs ==
Turner Fenton offers the International Baccalaureate (IB) Middle Years Programme (MYP) for grade 9 and 10 students (MYP Year 4 and 5) and the IB Diploma Programme (DP) for grade 11 and 12 students. The MYP, based on similar principles as the DP, is offered as preparation for the DP, requiring students to engage in the study of languages, sciences, mathematics, and humanities. The DP is a globally recognized program that prepares students for university.
