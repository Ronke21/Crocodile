<text>Dawson&#x27;s Creek is an American teen drama television series about the lives of a close-knit group of friends in the fictional town of Capeside, Massachusetts, beginning in high school and continuing into college. It ran for six seasons, from January 20, 1998, to May 14, 2003. The series starred James Van Der Beek as Dawson Leery; Katie Holmes as his best friend and love interest, Joey Potter; Joshua Jackson as their friend Pacey Witter; and Michelle Williams as Jen Lindley, a New York City transplant to Capeside. The show was created by Kevin Williamson and premiered on The WB as a mid-season replacement. It was produced by Columbia TriStar Television (renamed Sony Pictures Television before the sixth and final season) and was filmed in Wilmington, North Carolina. The series ended on May 14, 2003. A total of 128 episodes were produced, spanning six seasons.

Along with &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; became one of the flagship shows for The WB and launched its main cast to international stardom. The show placed at No. 90 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; &quot;New TV Classics&quot; list in 2007. It has also been credited with kicking off a boom of teen-centered shows in the late 1990s that continued into the 2000s.

== Premise ==
Dawson Leery is an introspective 15-year-old and aspiring filmmaker in the small New England town of Capeside, Massachusetts. Since childhood, he has been best friends with Josephine &quot;Joey&quot; Potter, who routinely comes over to his house through a ladder into his bedroom for movie-watching and platonic sleepovers. Tomboy Joey, who lost her mother to cancer and whose father is in prison for drug trafficking, lives with her older sister Bessie, who runs the restaurant The Icehouse. Dawson works at a video rental store with his other best friend Pacey Witter, an underachieving class clown who occasionally squabbles with Joey. Dawson and Joey dance around a growing attraction to each other, but their dynamic shifts with the arrival of Jen Lindley, who has moved to Capeside from New York City to live with her grandparents. The series explores the characters&#x27; coming-of-age, dealing with topics such as first love, death, coming out, homophobia, class differences, mental health, and divorce.

== Series overview ==
=== Episodes ===

=== Season 1 (1998) ===
The first season covers a love triangle between Dawson, Joey, and Jen, which some critics have compared to the love triangle between Archie Comics characters Archie, Betty, and Veronica. Some episodes feature homages to movies such as &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; and some reference Kevin Williamson&#x27;s work on &quot;Scream&quot;. Jen&#x27;s reasons for moving to Capeside are revealed – she was acting &quot;too sexual&quot; as a result of being taken advantage of when she was twelve. Pacey aims to lose his virginity and has an affair with a new teacher at Capeside High School. Dawson must cope with the news his mother Gail has had an affair, and then witness his parents&#x27; attempts to recover from this.

=== Season 2 (1998–1999) ===
The second season takes place during the characters&#x27; second half of their sophomore year. Siblings Andie and Jack McPhee move to Capeside and enroll at the high school. The type-A achiever Andie becomes romantically involved with Pacey and helps him to become more motivated. It is revealed that her older brother has died but her mother sometimes acts as if he is still alive and Andie seems to be responsible for caring for her and protecting her at such times as her husband is absent. Pacey becomes a rock for Andie as it is revealed she, unsurprisingly, struggles with mental illness herself. Joey finds herself drawn to Jack, who initially reciprocates her feelings, but comes to realize he is gay, which puts him at odds with homophobic classmates and an intolerant father. Jen befriends &quot;bad girl&quot; Abby Morgan and goes down a path of self-destruction. Dawson must deal with the divorce of his parents, Mitch and Gail.

=== Season 3 (1999–2000) ===
The third season saw the beginning of their junior year and a blossoming romance between Joey and Pacey. When Dawson discovers his two friends have become a couple behind his back, he is dejected and angry. Dawson and Pacey become rivals for Joey&#x27;s affection. Joey tries to repair her friendship with Dawson, but at the end of the season, Dawson realizes he does not want to hold Joey back, so he urges her to go and join Pacey, who is sailing down the coast for the summer. Jen is pursued by freshman football player Henry Parker and initially finds him immature but grows to return his feelings. Jack tries to find his first gay experience, while also juggling football, and trying to find a new place to live after his dad sells the only home he knows.

=== Season 4 (2000–2001) ===
The fourth season takes place during the characters&#x27; senior year of high school and deals with Joey and Pacey&#x27;s ups and downs as a couple. Their relationship is tested by differing post-high school plans, Joey&#x27;s friendship with Dawson, and Pacey&#x27;s insecurity. Jen learns that Henry wants to break up with her but he does not say this to her face. Andie almost dies at a rave when she takes ecstasy that was in Jen&#x27;s possession via a new boy, Drue - she used to know him in New York. The drug conflicts with Andie&#x27;s prescribed medication. The incident fractures Jen&#x27;s friendship with Jack and the group. Dawson starts to date Gretchen, Pacey&#x27;s older sister who has moved back to Capeside.

=== Season 5 (2001–2002) ===
The fifth season follows most of the characters leaving Capeside to begin new lives in big cities. In LA, Dawson attends USC Film School but starts to have second thoughts. After arguing with his parents over dropping out his father dies, leaving Dawson more confused about his future. In Boston, Joey, Jack and Jen navigate their freshman year of college. Pacey finds himself adrift after working on a yacht all summer but enters the restaurant business. Jack joins a fraternity and embraces life as an openly gay college student, but it puts his relationship with Toby under strain. Joey struggles to adjust to life as a college student but makes a new friend. Jen finds herself drawn into a whirlwind relationship and also supports Dawson when he attends grief counselling.

=== Season 6 (2002–2003) ===
In the sixth and final season, Dawson moves to Boston and begins to work on a low-budget film project that echoes his life in Capeside. Jen must deal with her parents&#x27; impending divorce, while Jack faces sexual harassment from a professor. Pacey works as a chef at a Boston restaurant, but embarks on a new career which comes as a surprise to everyone. The two-part finale, which is set in the year 2008, finds everyone is reunited in Capeside for a special wedding, but the happy reunion is cut short after the group learns that one of their own has been harboring a heartbreaking secret. In the midst of the tragedy, old scores are settled, new relationships blossom, and new ventures are chosen for a better future.

==Production==
===Conception===
Following the selling of his spec script for Wes Craven-directed &quot;Scream&quot; (1996), film assistant Kevin Williamson was taking several meetings with film and television producers before the slasher film began production. In what would be his first television meeting, Williamson met executive Paul Stupin; when asked if he had ideas for a television production, Williamson came up with the idea of a teen series based on his youth growing up near a North Carolina creek as an aspiring filmmaker who admired director Steven Spielberg. Stupin liked his idea and asked him to come back the next day and pitch it to Columbia TriStar Television, prompting Williamson to write a 20-page outline for &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; that night. Williamson pitched the show &quot;as &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot;, meets &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot;, meets &quot;James at 15&quot;, meets &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;, meets &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;&quot;, also taking inspiration from teen drama &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; as he &quot;wanted it to speak to the teenage audience of the day&quot;.

When Columbia TriStar Television requested him to relocate the show to Boston, Massachusetts, he settled with fictional Capeside, and pitched it to Fox. However, commissioned amid the struggling of &quot;Party of Five&quot;, Fox wondered if they needed another teen drama, and while they were supportive of Williamson&#x27;s scripts, they eventually passed on it. Left unused, Columbia TriStar Television sent his scripts to newly founded The WB network who was looking for fresh ideas for their programme after launching supernatural drama series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. Williamson went for a meeting with then-chief programmer Garth Ancier and entertainment president Susanne Daniels who loved his script and picked it up for The WB&#x27;s new Tuesday night lineup. Procter &amp; Gamble Productions joined in as an original co-producer of the series, but sold its interest in the show three months before the premiere when printed stories surfaced about the racy dialogue and risqué plot lines.

===Casting===
&quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; would become responsible for launching the acting careers of its young lead stars James Van Der Beek, Michelle Williams, Katie Holmes, and Joshua Jackson, who had varying levels of acting experience prior to being cast in the show. Known for his appearance in &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot; series, playing a young and aspiring hockey player, Jackson was initially considered for the main role of Dawson Leery. However, while Williamson &quot;fell in love&quot; with Jackson, citing his ability to read any role during the auditions, he felt that Jackson&#x27;s good looks would not fit the underdog, nerd, and video geek character he envisioned for the show&#x27;s titular character. After The WB expressed their wish to look for a different actor, Williamson decided on casting him in the role of Dawson&#x27;s best friend Pacey Witter instead. After watching a video of James Van Der Beek that his casting director had sent in, the casting crew invited him to audition in Los Angeles. A regular off-Broadway performer, Van Der Beek impressed Williamson with his &quot;cerebral and internal&quot; quality, citing &quot;that nervousness that made it seem like he was pre-thinking and over-thinking and over-compensating constantly like he was insecure. And we said, &quot;There&#x27;s Dawson&quot;.&quot; Actors Charlie Hunnam, Adrian Grenier, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, and Scott Speedman also auditioned for the role of Dawson, while Adam Brody read for Pacey. Josh Hartnett also auditioned for a role.

With the role of Dawson&#x27;s best female friend Joey Potter, casting directors were looking for a tomboy character. Williamson and his team were initially close to casting actress Selma Blair in the role who had auditioned &quot;very tough, [but] with a lot of heart,&quot; when an audition tape of Katie Holmes came in, in which she had filmed herself in her basement, with her mother reading Dawson&#x27;s lines. Williamson thought she had exactly the right look for Joey, citing that &quot;she had those eyes, those eyes just stained with loneliness.&quot; He asked her to come to California, but a conflict with her school play schedule prevented her from doing so. Upon her arrival in Los Angeles two weeks later, she was able to secure the role.

Michelle Williams, who had acted in &quot;Lassie&quot;, &quot;Species&quot;, and in guest spots on TV sitcoms, impressed Williamson when she auditioned with a heartfelt scene in which her character Jen Lindley goes in and sees her grandfather lying in the bed, transforming herself &quot;into this broken child who just needed to be fixed&quot;. Katherine Heigl also was one of the actresses who auditioned for the role of Jen after Steve Miner, who directed the show&#x27;s pilot and Heigl&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;My Father the Hero&quot;, brought in the young star.

===Production team===
The entire first season, thirteen episodes, was filmed before the first episode even aired. After the end of the second season, Williamson left to focus on &quot;Wasteland&quot;, a new show for ABC, but later returned to write the two-hour series finale. After Williamson&#x27;s departure, Alex Gansa was selected as the new showrunner, but a production shutdown in addition to actors&#x27; unhappiness with the story lines at the start of season three led to Gansa being replaced by Greg Berlanti, who had been on the writing staff before Williamson&#x27;s departure. Members of the series&#x27; writing staff would go on to create or write for other notable TV shows, including Gina Fattore (&quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;), Jenny Bicks (&quot;Sex and the City&quot;), Julie Plec (&quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot;), Tom Kapinos (&quot;Californication&quot;), and Dana Baratta (&quot;Jessica Jones&quot;).

===Filming locations===
During its first four seasons, &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; was primarily filmed in Wilmington, North Carolina, at EUE/Screen Gems studios and on location around Wilmington, with Southport and Wrightsville Beach also standing in for the fictional town of Capeside, a port city located in mid-Cape Cod. The Wilmington area benefited greatly from the show. While a number of films, commercials and music videos had been shot at the studios, &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; was the first to occupy numerous soundstages for many years. Other shows as &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; later occupied some of these same soundstages for several years and used some of the same locations in Wilmington. In addition to business brought into the community by the project, it attracted attention to the city as a filming location and boosted tourism. The visitors&#x27; bureau distributed a special guide to filming locations used in the show.

For the Leery, Lindley, and Potter homes private residences located along the shores of Hewletts Creek, a stream in New Hanover County, were used. Some of the scenes shown during the opening credits and miscellaneous scenery shots throughout the early episodes were filmed in Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, an island off the coast of Massachusetts, as well as Masonboro. Interiors for the Potter family&#x27;s Icehouse restaurant were filmed at The Icehouse bar in downtown Wilmington, while exteriors were filmed at the Dockside Restaurant in Wrightsville Beach. Nearby constructions at the real Icehouse later forced producers to eliminate the bar from the storyline by burning it down. Other prominent exterior shots include Alderman and Hoggard Halls on the University of North Carolina Wilmington campus, serving for Capeside High School.

Due to the architectural uniformity of the campus, it was difficult for the university to double as another campus in the show when the characters reached college in the fifth and sixth season. Therefore, scenes at the fictional Worthington University in Boston were filmed at Duke University and around Franklin Street at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Other filming locations in later seasons include Durham and Raleigh. The Hell&#x27;s Kitchen bar featured in the show was a natural food store at 118 Princess Street in Wilmington which was purchased by producers, dressed as a seedy college bar and used for production during the show&#x27;s last season. When production completed, the building was purchased by a local restaurateur, along with much of the set and decorations and was then converted into a real restaurant and bar that retains the same name.

== Marketing ==
The WB spent an estimated $3 million on marketing the show several months ahead of the January 20, 1998, series premiere. Promotion included billboards in addition to trailers in theaters before screenings of films like &quot;Titanic&quot;, making The WB the first TV network to run trailers in movie theaters. A clip of the show was circulated to television critics and media outlets in the summer of 1997 which generated buzz for the show&#x27;s risqué content that included frank sexual talk amongst teenagers and a romantic plot line between a teacher and a high school student.

J.Crew, which was the show&#x27;s wardrobe provider, featured the then unknown cast for its winter-spring catalog. In January 1998, promos ran in Blockbuster video stores featuring the Paula Cole song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Wait&quot;, which would later become the show&#x27;s theme song after producers could not secure the rights for Alanis Morissette&#x27;s &quot;Hand in My Pocket&quot;. The WB&#x27;s marketing campaign led &quot;Newsweek&quot; to remark &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; is &quot;as much a marketing event as a small-town serial about overheated hormones.&quot;

During the series&#x27; run, producers and writers were among the first to use cross-platform fan engagement through the series&#x27; official website, which was known as Dawson&#x27;s Desktop. On the site, users could peruse &quot;Dawson&#x27;s multimedia journal and homework files, surf his bookmarked Web sites and listen to his CDs. They can read characters&#x27; e-mails and chats and go through their trash bins.&quot; According to show writer Jeffrey Stepakoff, &quot;dawsonscreek.com [was] where fans could not only chat about the show, but tell us what they wanted to see next. The wishes of viewers had a very strong impact on the direction of the series. In fact, staff members were hired to interact regularly with fans online.&quot;

==Broadcast==

===International===
The show was broadcast in over 50 countries. It was especially popular in Australia, where it rated #1 in its time slot on Network Ten for several episodes and highly at other times from seasons one to four. Reruns of the show are often seen in Australia on 9Go! 

In the United Kingdom, Dawson&#x27;s Creek initially on Channel 4 but later moved to Channel 5 for its last two seasons. In 2007, Channel 5&#x27;s sister channel 5Star began airing reruns on weekdays. From April 2011, it aired on Sony Channel on the Sky digital platform. In November 2017, the full series returned to Channel 4&#x27;s streaming service All 4. In May 2023, ITV2 started airing every &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; episode on every weekday afternoons. 

In Finland, the show aired on Yle. 

In Italy, Dawson&#x27;s Creek initially aired on the pay TV channel TELE+ Bianco, but later moved to the free-to-air TV channel Italia 1 for its last four seasons. 

The show aired in New Zealand on TVNZ 2.

===Syndication===
Dawson&#x27;s Creek aired on TBS from 2003 to 2008, and later aired on Noggin&#x27;s late-night programming block The N from 2006 to 2007, and then later moved to the 24-hour version of The N where it aired until December 31, 2008. And aired on Pop from 2012 to 2018, and aired on ABC Family for a short time in 2015.

==Reception==

===Controversy===
&quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; generated a large amount of publicity before its debut, with several television critics and consumer watchdog groups expressing concerns about its anticipated &quot;racy&quot; plots and dialogue. The controversy drove Procter &amp; Gamble Productions, initially a co-producer of the series, away from the project. Syndicated columnist John Leo said the show should be called &quot;While Parents Cringe&quot;, and went on to write, &quot;The first episode contains a good deal of chatter about breasts, genitalia, masturbation, and penis size. Then the title and credits come on and the story begins.&quot;

The Parents Television Council (PTC) proclaimed the show as the single worst program of the 1997–98 and 1998–99 seasons by being &quot;the crudest of the network shows aimed at kids&quot;, complaining about &quot;an almost obsessive focus on pre-marital sexual activity&quot;, references to pornography and condoms, and the show&#x27;s acceptance of homosexuality. Former UPN President Lucie Salhany criticized The WB for airing &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; which features &quot;adolescent characters in adult situations&quot; in an early time slot while the network is supposed to be &#x27;the family network.&#x27;&quot; However, on the opposite end of the ideological spectrum, the National Organization for Women offered an endorsement, deeming it one of the least sexually exploitative shows on the air.

Much of the criticism cited the show&#x27;s early decision to feature a storyline about a romantic relationship between a high school student and a teacher.

=== Critical response ===
Early reviews of the series were mixed to positive. During the season premiere, much was written about the show&#x27;s perceived racy content and the teens&#x27; &quot;unhealthy obsession with sex.&quot; Negative reviews lambasted the show for its lack of realism, particularly its verbose dialogue spoken by the teen characters which &quot;People&quot; said strained credibility. &quot;The Observer&quot; called the show &quot;simply misguided and misconceived (hyper-articulate, self-conscious teenagers go through puberty in a Macy&#x27;s catalogue).&quot; Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; commented that creator Kevin Williamson was &quot;the most overrated wunderkind in Hollywood&quot; and &quot;what he&#x27;s brilliant at is pandering.&quot;

Other reviews noted the show tread familiar ground, with the &quot;LA Weekly&quot; writing, &quot;[The show] comes alive in fits and starts, then folds back into a less original or less plausible or less coherent version of some part of something you&#x27;ve seen before, if you&#x27;ve seen &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;, &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;, &quot;Degrassi High&quot;, &quot;Party of Five&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot;, or &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. Or even one of those very special episodes of &quot;Blossom&quot;.&quot;

On the other hand, multiple critics lauded the show&#x27;s hyper-articulate, self-aware dialogue, saying it is what sets it apart from past teen shows. Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote the &quot;sophisticated awareness...characteristic of Mr. Williamson&#x27;s writing&quot; is the show&#x27;s standout. Bruce Fretts of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;That&#x27;s Kevin Williamson&#x27;s genius — just as &quot;Scream&quot; did with slasher flicks, &quot;Creek&quot; simultaneously works as a teen soap (you can&#x27;t help but get caught up in the Dawson-Jen-Joey triangle) and comments ironically on the genre (witness the digs at the overly earnest &quot;90210&quot; and &quot;Party of Five&quot;). The trouble is, some people aren&#x27;t getting the joke.&quot; Jeff Simon of &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; opined, &quot;This is the way wildly bright 15-year-old kids dearly want to talk, which puts &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; into a higher class of realism entirely.&quot; Williamson admitted he wrote the dialogue as such with the aim of showing &quot;how teenagers would like to be seen, as opposed to being talked down to.&quot;

In response to concerns about the show&#x27;s sexual dialogue, some critics wrote &quot;it&#x27;s safe to assume teens have said, heard, or done far worse.&quot; &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; wrote the show is &quot;not so much about sex as it is about growing up in a sex-obsessed culture. It&#x27;s a subtle difference, but one that could make this newest prime-time soap a cut above the rest.&quot; &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; noted the show does not appear to glorify teacher-student romances as &quot;Pacey&#x27;s great adventure is not seen by the others as a triumph, and in the end, both he and the teacher pay for [their liaison].&quot;

John Carman of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; found &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; scenically &quot;downright luxuriant&quot; and liked that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t have the rushed feel of so many teen shows. The edginess is in the situations, not the pacing.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that it was &quot;an addictive drama with considerable heart&quot;, and that &quot;it&#x27;s a drama conceited enough to believe that it created the concept of teenagers who care and jaded enough to...[suggest] more than a post-pubescent pipe dream.&quot; &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; acknowledged the sexual dialogue but said &quot;Williamson conjures a strangely compelling blend of jadedness and innocence.&quot; The &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; wrote the show &quot;is a real charmer, capturing not only the awkwardness and agonies of growing up but also the pure joy of possibilities ahead&quot;, and &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; declared it the best show of the 1997–1998 season and said it &quot;belongs in that too-small pantheon of &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;, &quot;James at 15&quot; and to a lesser extent, &quot;Party of Five&quot; and &quot;Doogie Howser, M.D.&quot;&quot;

Praise for the cast was widespread. &quot;LA Weekly&quot; called the leads &quot;luminous&quot; and &quot;talented&quot;, while &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;As Dawson, Van Der Beek is an exquisitely talented heartthrob, and Holmes, as Joey, is a confident young performer who delivers her lines with slyness and conviction. Williams (Jen) and Jackson (Pacey), meanwhile, more than hold their own, with Jackson looking to be a budding star in his own right.&quot;

===Awards and accolades===
&quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; was nominated for fourteen awards, including ALMA Awards, Casting Society of America Awards, Golden Satellite Awards, TV Guide Awards, and YoungStar Awards. In 2000, the show was awarded a SHINE Award for consistently addressing sexual health issues on TV. By the end of its run, the show, its crew, and its young cast had been nominated for numerous awards, winning six of them. Joshua Jackson won the Teen Choice Award for Choice Actor three times, and the show won the Teen Choice Award for Choice Drama twice. The series also won the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding TV Drama Series.

===U.S. television ratings===
While never a huge ratings success in the context of major networks like NBC, ABC, and CBS, &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; did very well with the younger demographic it targeted and became a defining show for the WB Network. It became the highest-rated show among female teens at that time and helped ad revenue for the WB &quot;soar from $100 million in 1996 to well over half a billion dollars in 1999.&quot; The pilot episode was watched by 6.8 million viewers and had a 4.8 rating which made it the network&#x27;s highest ranked show within two months. The first season&#x27;s highest ranked episode was the finale, which was fifty-ninth, while the second highest rated was the second episode (probably scoring so well partially because the other major networks carried President Clinton&#x27;s State of the Union address in the midst of the Lewinsky scandal rather than their regular programming). The series finale itself was watched by 7.3 million U.S. viewers, which was its largest audience since Season 2.

==Spin-offs==
The show had, in the words of television experts Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh, a &quot;semi-spinoff&quot; – &quot;Young Americans&quot;. The protagonist of &quot;Young Americans&quot;, Will Krudski (Rodney Scott), was introduced in three episodes at the end of the show&#x27;s third season as a friend of Dawson, Joey, and Pacey&#x27;s who had previously moved away and returned to Capeside for a visit. His character was never referred to before this story arc and did not appear again in the series after the season three episode &quot;Show Me Love&quot;. &quot;Young Americans&quot; was made by the same company as &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, Columbia TriStar Television, and appeared in &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&#x27;s&quot; time slot during the show&#x27;s break in the summer of 2000. &quot;Young Americans&quot; had 8 episodes. The reason the show is considered a semi-spinoff instead of a true spinoff is that the character of Will was not originally created for &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, and was only introduced in &quot;Dawson&#x27;s&quot; to set up and establish the premise of &quot;Young Americans&quot;.

===Foreign remakes===
The show served as inspiration for the production of the Argentine soap &quot;Verano del &#x27;98&quot;, which received criticism for being a thinly veiled copy of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;. The 2007 youth drama series &quot;Kavak Yelleri&quot; is also a Turkish remake of the show.

==Merchandise==

===DVD releases===
===Music===
Curating popular music and breaking artists from the independent and alternative rock genres, &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; became impactful on shaping the television music culture of teen and other drama series in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Instrumentation of the episodes was generally overseen by executive Paul Stupin, music supervisor John McCullough, and co-producer Drew Matich who helped artists rise to fame and made pivotal creative decisions. The trio approached music in &quot;a way to convey the emotion, to convey the story,&quot; looking for songs to underplay whole sequences where viewers could also enjoy the music under dialogue. Thus, Stupin would often end up spending hours in the editing room with the editor going over candidates for songs that McCullough sent over. In some cases, they would look at, against picture, ten or 15 songs against each scene. Next to McCullough, recommendations for inclusion came &quot;from everywhere&quot;, with writers, editors, co-producers and Sony Music executives playing pivotal roles.
Originally, Canadian recording artist Alanis Morissette&#x27;s song &quot;Hand in My Pocket&quot; from her third studio album &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; (1995) served as the theme song in the unaired pilot episode of the television show. However, Morissette decided not to have it used as the theme after &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; was picked up, prompting Stupin and McCullough to approach different artists for original material to use. In the meantime, The WB had licensed American singer-songwriter Paula Cole&#x27;s song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Wait&quot; from her second album &quot;This Fire&quot; (1996) and suggested them to use it instead. An eleventh hour decision, it was incorporated late into the promotion of the series but became a hit on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts upon the show&#x27;s debut in January 1998. The first season&#x27;s score was provided by Adam Fields, including the &quot;End Credits Theme&quot;, which was used on all six seasons.

Because Sony Music failed to secure the rights for home video and online streaming services when the show was produced and did not wish to pay for them later, most of the songs that aired in the original broadcasts were replaced in the DVD editions and upon the video-on-demand debut of the show. Starting with the third season, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Wait&quot; was also dropped from the opening sequence of the DVD releases due to budget reasons and was replaced by &quot;Run Like Mad&quot; from Canadian folk artist Jann Arden, a regular music contributor to the series. The 32-second recording was one of the original intros that Stupin commissioned after he had failed to acquire rights to Morissette&#x27;s song and which international broadcasts had previously used as the theme song for the first season before switching to Cole&#x27;s song for the remainder of the run. In 2021, Cole recorded a new version of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Wait&quot; to avoid licensing issues with the original master, and Netflix used this new master as the theme song.

During its original run, &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; spawned two volumes of soundtrack albums. The album &quot;Songs from Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; was released after the broadcasting of the series&#x27; first season in April 1999, and became a major success worldwide. It reached the top of the Australian Albums Chart and also peaked within the top in Austria, Norway, Sweden, and the United States. During it first sixth months of release, the album sold more than 1.5 million copies worldwide and was certified triple platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In Australia, it became the fifth highest selling album of 1999. &quot;Songs from Dawson&#x27;s Creek – Volume 2&quot; was released in October 2000 to coincide with the debut of the series&#x27; fourth season. Less successful, it reached the top twenty of Austrian and Swiss Albums Charts, while peaking at number 50 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

=== Book series ===
Simon &amp; Schuster published a series of fifteen mass-market paperback novelizations of the series. Before joining the series&#x27; staff as episode writers, Liz Tigelaar and Anna Fricke wrote a young adult suspense-themed series as a companion to the show.

==Legacy==
The show&#x27;s influence as a cultural touchstone has been widely acknowledged by media outlets and critics. In an article for &quot;BuzzFeed News&quot;, Sandi Rankaduwa wrote about why the show resonated with young people who came of age during the era of Columbine and 9/11, saying &quot;At a time in teens&#x27; lives when they&#x27;re tasked with trying to understand their place in the world, events unfolding around them were becoming increasingly senseless. So it&#x27;s not entirely surprising that a show featuring confused, outsider teens who seemed more self-aware than the adults around them became comfort food for so many young Americans...but despite its nostalgic elements, &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; managed to portray a warts-and-all world in which viewers watched smart, stubborn, and emotional characters search for stability, and seeing them both struggle and succeed in a controlled space became therapeutic. The breadth of characters was wide enough to give everyone at least one person to root for and relate to, especially for a primarily teen girl audience.&quot;

Rankaduwa added, &quot;Unlike the glamorous lifestyles shown in shows like &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; and later &quot;The O.C.&quot;, both on Fox, the stories of teens on the Creek felt somewhat accessible. And when it came to what made &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; so significant to its teen viewers, it wasn&#x27;t just the words, it was who was saying them.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Pacey and Joey as number 20 on their list of the 100 Best TV Romances of All Time. The season three finale episode &quot;True Love&quot; is ranked at number 50 on &quot;The Ringer&quot;&#x27;s list of 100 Best TV Episodes of the Century. The character of Jack McPhee was cited as being among the most groundbreaking gay roles on television and his kiss with Ethan marked the first romantic kiss between two gay male characters on primetime TV.

The popularity and success of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; is credited with paving the way for subsequent teen shows. In 2018, Kristen Baldwin of &quot;EW&quot; argued, &quot;Without &quot;Dawson&#x27;s&quot; (and its original lead-out, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;), we would never have the hyper-verbal, pop culture-obsessed teens of &quot;Riverdale&quot;— not to mention &quot;Felicity&quot; and &quot;Charmed&quot; (1998), &quot;Popular&quot;, &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; (which was actually pitched as &#x27;the anti-&quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;&#x27;) and &quot;Roswell&quot; (1999), &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; (2000), &quot;Everwood&quot; (2002), or 2003&#x27;s &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; and &quot;The O.C.&quot; After all, who is Seth Cohen but a snarkier, more Jewish Dawson Leery?&quot;

Baldwin continued, &quot;with &quot;Dawson&#x27;s&quot; the characters didn&#x27;t just suffer through crushes and hormones and parental drama — they talked endlessly, and with hilarious eloquence, about how cliché their crushes and hormones and parental drama was. As EW&#x27;s Chris Nashawaty wrote in 1997, on the eve of Dawson&#x27;s premiere, &#x27;Williamson shows teens a reflection of how they want to be seen: witty, urbane, and always armed with a perfectly barbed, sarcastic comeback.&#x27;&quot;

In 2018, the cast reunited for the series&#x27; 20th anniversary in a special issue of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, which included five different collectible covers for its print issue. The weekend following the reunion cover saw streaming traffic for the series on Hulu quadruple.

When asked about the possibility of a reboot, Katie Holmes said, &quot;What I love about the show is that it existed at a time pre-social media, pre-internet, and it was nostalgic when we were shooting it. So I really like it where it is, to be honest.&quot; Kevin Williamson added, &quot;&quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; was me expressing myself at that point in time. And here I am, at another age, at another point in time. I don&#x27;t know what I could emotionally bring to the table. I can&#x27;t wait for someone else to do it. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to be me. But I&#x27;ll be happy to watch it.&quot;

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; was frequently referenced in other media, including &quot;South Park&quot; at the height of its popularity. The children&#x27;s sketch comedy series &quot;The Amanda Show&quot; included a recurring soap opera parody segment called &quot;Moody&#x27;s Point&quot;. The series was also parodied at the 1998 MTV Movie Awards and in the 2000 film &quot;Scary Movie&quot;, the latter which Van Der Beek makes a cameo in. Van Der Beek, playing a fictionalized version of himself in &quot;Don&#x27;t Trust the B---- in Apartment 23&quot; frequently made fun of his character in the show. 

Van Der Beek appeared alongside Jason Biggs in the 2001 film &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; as the cinematic versions of the titular characters Jay and Silent Bob&#x27;s alter-egos &#x27;Bluntman &amp; Chronic&quot;. Wherein during an argument; Biggs confuses Van Der Beek&#x27;s character of Dawson with that of Joshua Jackson&#x27;s character Pacey.

The scene of Dawson&#x27;s crying face became a meme that Van Der Beek has acknowledged.

<text>Barton Springs is a set of four natural water springs located at Barton Creek on the grounds of Zilker Park in Austin, Texas, resulting from water flowing through the Edwards Aquifer. The largest spring, Main Barton Spring (also known as Parthenia, &quot;the mother spring&quot;), supplies water to Barton Springs Pool, a popular recreational destination in Austin. The smaller springs are located nearby, two with man-made structures built to contain and direct their flow. The springs are the only known habitat of the Barton Springs Salamander, an endangered species.

The Barton Creek National Archeological and Historic District was formed in 1985.

==Geology==
Barton Springs is the main discharge point for the Barton Springs segment of the Edwards Aquifer of Texas, a well known karst aquifer. Geologically, the aquifer is composed of limestone from the Cretaceous period, about 100 million years old. Fractures, fissures, conduits, and caves have developed in this limestone. Both physical forces, such as faulting, and chemical forces, such as dissolution of limestone by infiltrating water, have enlarged these voids. This results in a karst aquifer made up of limestone with large void spaces. Water then enters the aquifer and fills the voids.

All water discharging from Barton Springs originates as rainfall. Some of this rain falls directly onto the area of land where the aquifer limestone rock is exposed, which is known as the recharge zone. Other rainfall enters into creeks that cross the recharge zone, and infiltrates the limestone bedrock. After water enters the aquifer, it flows along the gradients created by differences in hydraulic pressure into the area of lowest hydraulic pressure. This lowest point of hydraulic pressure is Barton Springs.

===Main spring===
Main Barton Spring/Parthenia is the most famous, yet least visible of the four springs because it is completely submerged by pool water. Located near the diving board in Barton Springs Pool, the spring&#x27;s flow is not always visible at the surface.

The main spring discharges an average flow of about per day. The lowest discharge ever recorded was per day during the drought of the 1950s, and the highest discharge ever recorded was per day during December 1991 and September 2016 flooding. By comparison, a typical domestic in-ground swimming pool holds about , and the City of Austin, a city of about 1 million residents, uses about per day for its public water supply system.

==Other springs==

The three other springs associated with Barton Springs are Eliza, Old Mill, and Upper Barton Spring. Each is significantly smaller than Main Barton Spring, discharging an average of per day. Sometimes, these springs dry up completely.

Eliza Spring, also known as Concession Spring, is located near the north entrance to Barton Springs Pool, 300 feet (100m) east towards the children&#x27;s playscape. During the early 20th century, an amphitheater-style swimming enclosure was built around the spring. This structure is no longer open to the public due to safety concerns, and the fact that Eliza Spring has become a sensitive habitat area for the endangered Barton Springs Salamander.

Old Mill Spring, also known as Sunken Gardens Spring or Zenobia Spring, is located on the south side of Barton Springs Pool. Like Eliza Spring, the early 20th century structure built around the spring is now closed to public access due to safety and endangered species habitat issues. Scientific analysis show that the water at Old Mill Spring has a slightly different chemistry than that of Main Barton Spring and Eliza Spring, even though it is less than half a mile (800 m) away from these springs.

Upper Barton Spring is located in the creek bed of Barton Creek, about a half mile (800 m) upstream or west of Barton Springs Pool. Frequently dry, Upper Barton Spring is fully submerged by Barton Creek during floods. The water at Upper Barton Spring also has a significantly different chemistry than the other springs.

The entire area around Barton Springs is riddled with faults from the Balcones Fault Zone and features other, smaller springs. For example, about one mile (2 km) upstream of Upper Barton Spring, an intermittent spring fills a popular natural swimming hole. Several other small springs empty directly into the Barton Creek bypass tunnel that passes to the side of Barton Springs Pool.

==Fauna==
Two salamander species are found only at Barton Springs: Barton Springs salamander and Austin blind salamander.

<text>David Michael Hasselhoff (born July 17, 1952), nicknamed &quot;The Hoff&quot;, is an American actor, singer, and television personality. He has set a Guinness World Record as the most watched man on TV. Hasselhoff first gained recognition on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; (1975–1982), playing the role of Dr. Snapper Foster. His career continued with his leading role as Michael Knight on &quot;Knight Rider&quot; (1982–1986) and as L.A. County Lifeguard Mitch Buchannon in &quot;Baywatch&quot; (1989–2000)&quot;.&quot; He also produced &quot;Baywatch&quot; from the 1990s until 2001 when the series ended with &quot;Baywatch Hawaii.&quot;

Hasselhoff has appeared in films, including &quot;&quot; (2004), &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot; (2004), &quot;Click&quot; (2006), &quot;Hop&quot; (2011), and &quot;Piranha 3DD&quot; (2012). Before Samuel L. Jackson, Hasselhoff was the first actor to portray the Marvel Comics character Nick Fury in the telefilm &quot;Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; (1998). In 2000, he made his Broadway debut in the musical &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot;. Following his debut, he starred in other musicals including &quot;Chicago&quot; and &quot;The Producers&quot;.

Hasselhoff has released a total of 15 studio albums, which found success mostly in German-speaking parts of Europe, where he has garnered multiple gold and platinum awards, with the single &quot;Looking for Freedom&quot; reaching number one in Germany and Switzerland. Hasselhoff has also worked as a talent show judge on television shows such as &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; (2006–2009) and &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; (2011).

==Early life and education==

Hasselhoff was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Dolores Theresa (née Mullinex; 1930–2009), a homemaker, and Joseph Vincent Hasselhoff (1925–2014), a business executive. His family is Roman Catholic with German, English, and Irish descent. His great-great-grandmother, Meta, emigrated with her family to Baltimore from Völkersen, Germany in 1865.

He spent his childhood in Jacksonville, Florida, and later lived in Atlanta, Georgia, where he attended Marist School. Hasselhoff made his theatrical debut at the age of seven in &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, and ever since his childhood dream was to have a career on Broadway. He graduated from Lyons Township High School in La Grange, Illinois, in 1970. He was a member of the speech team, senior discussion leaders, president of the choir, captain of the volleyball team and held roles in several plays (including one lead role as Matt in &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;). He studied at Oakland University, then studied theater at the California Institute of the Arts until 1973.

==Early career==

Hasselhoff portrayed Dr. &quot;Snapper Foster&quot; on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; from 1975 to 1982, leaving the series as the show wrote out many of their original characters. His feature film debut was in 1974 as &quot;Boner&quot; in &quot;Revenge of the Cheerleaders&quot;, which he did to get accredited into the Screen Actors Guild. At the time, he believed that the film would not be released, but it was: two years later, also appearing under the title &quot;Caught with their Pants Down&quot;. In 1979, he played &quot;Simon&quot; in &quot;Starcrash&quot;. He launched his singing career with guest appearances on the first season of children&#x27;s program &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot;, performing &quot;Do You Love Me&quot;. He guest-starred on two episodes of &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; and the soap opera &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; as himself in 1984.

===&quot;Knight Rider&quot;===

Hasselhoff was recruited by then-NBC-president Brandon Tartikoff to star in the action crime drama series &quot;Knight Rider&quot; from 1982 to 1986 as Michael Knight. The actor has described &quot;Knight Rider&quot; as more than a TV show: &quot;It&#x27;s a phenomenon. It&#x27;s bigger than &quot;Baywatch&quot; ever was.&quot; On the success of &quot;Knight Rider&quot; – &quot;It&#x27;s because it was about saving lives, not taking lives, and it was how one man really can make a difference.&quot;

He describes the acting he has done as &quot;a little more difficult than if you had a regularly well-written script – like, if I was going to be in, say, &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, or &quot;The Godfather&quot;, or &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; or &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; or &quot;ER&quot; -- I had to talk to a car.&quot; His role in the show led him to win Favorite Male Performer in a New TV Program at the 9th People&#x27;s Choice Awards in 1983.

===&quot;Baywatch&quot;===

Hasselhoff returned to television on &quot;Baywatch&quot; which premiered in 1989. Although it was canceled after only one season, he believed the series had potential, so Hasselhoff revived it for the first-run syndication market in 1991, investing his own money and additionally functioning as executive producer. His contract stipulated royalties to be paid to him from the rerun profits, which gave him the financial liberty to buy back the rights to &quot;Baywatch&quot; from NBC.

In its second incarnation, &quot;Baywatch&quot; was much more successful. It ran for a total of 11 years and, from the 1990s until its series finale in 2001, was watched by almost 1 billion viewers across 140 countries, solidifying his status among the world&#x27;s foremost television personalities of the said period.
This success combined with his royalties and his other ventures have placed Hasselhoff&#x27;s fortune at more than $100 million.

In 1991, Hasselhoff reprised his role as Michael Knight in the television film &quot;Knight Rider 2000&quot; as a sequel to the original series. The movie served as a pilot for a proposed new series, but despite high ratings, the plan was abandoned.

In 1996, Hasselhoff was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1997, he performed a duet with Filipino singer Regine Velasquez, which was used as the main theme for his 1998 movie &quot;Legacy&quot;. He made his Broadway debut in 2000 in the title role of &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot;. In August 2001, he hosted an event at the Conga Room, in Los Angeles honoring the Latin rock band Renegade for record sales in excess of 30 million units worldwide, taking the stage with the Latin rockers and singing in Spanish. Beginning on July 16, 2004, he played the lead role in London performances of &quot;Chicago&quot; for three months.

Hasselhoff has made several self-parodic appearances in movies. He had a major role in &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot;, released November 19, 2004, starring as himself (though resembling his bygone &quot;Baywatch&quot; character) and meeting SpongeBob and Patrick (his full name is heard once in the movie; he is referred to as &quot;Hasselhoff&quot;). Hasselhoff also had another short appearance in the movie &quot;&quot; as the dodgeball coach to the German national dodgeball team, Team Hasselhoff. Berating his team after being eliminated from a tournament, he shouts &quot;Ihr seid alle &quot;Schweine&quot;!&quot; (translated: &quot;You are all &quot;pigs&quot;!&quot;, a common German insult) and smashes a photo of himself in his &quot;Baywatch&quot; attire. In 2004&#x27;s &quot;EuroTrip&quot;, Hasselhoff appears in a washroom. In the 2006 Adam Sandler film &quot;Click&quot; Hasselhoff portrays Sandler&#x27;s despicable boss. Hasselhoff also appears in an episode of &quot;Wildboyz&quot;. In 2007, he again played himself in the Jamie Kennedy comedy &quot;Kickin&#x27; It Old Skool&quot;.

In his music video for &quot;Jump in My Car&quot;, he engages in self-parody; this time parodying his performance as Michael Knight in &quot;Knight Rider&quot;. The car in the video was a black Pontiac Trans Am with a pulsing LED and an interior nearly identical to that of the KITT car in the series. The video was shot in Sydney, Australia using a right-hand drive KITT replica, including KITT&#x27;s ejection seat system.

In November 2006, Mel Brooks announced Hasselhoff would portray Roger DeBris, the director of the Nazi musical &quot;Springtime for Hitler&quot;, in the Las Vegas production of &quot;The Producers&quot;.

In 2006, Hasselhoff became a co-judge on NBC&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, a show that showcases America&#x27;s best amateur entertainers. He also judged in the second, third and fourth seasons alongside Sharon Osbourne and Piers Morgan. On the 2007 season finale, Hasselhoff sang &quot;This Is the Moment&quot;. He was replaced by comedian Howie Mandel for season five.

In the same year, Hasselhoff was featured in the trailer of the spin-off downloadable game, &quot;Burnout Crash!&quot;.

On February 24, 2014, he opened his own 10-week talk show in Sweden on TV3, in English. A similar show was later recorded in Finland, premiering on Sub on April 2, 2015.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve he performed again at the Brandenburg Gate, arriving late because his plane was diverted to Hannover.

===Get Hasselhoff to Number 1 campaign===

In 2006, fans of David Hasselhoff launched a tongue-in-cheek website &quot;Get Hasselhoff to Number 1&quot; in an attempt to get the 1989 hit &quot;Looking for Freedom&quot; to the top of the UK music charts through Internet downloads of the single. The campaign attracted attention on British radio and television broadcasts, in the national press and on the Internet. Over 40,000 people signed up to receive the &quot;Hoff Alert&quot; e-mail when the time had come to purchase the single. The focus of the campaign shifted to &quot;Jump in My Car&quot;, when that was actually released as a single, and BBC Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills lent his support.

On December 10, 2010, A&amp;E confirmed in a statement that, after airing just two episodes, &quot;The Hasselhoffs&quot; had been canceled. According to Nielsen Co. ratings, the first episode was seen by 718,000 viewers. Viewers dropped to 505,000 for the second installment, which aired on the same evening. The full series aired in the UK on May 30, 2011, on The Biography Channel.

In 2017 Hasselhoff appeared in short film &quot;It&#x27;s No Game&quot; by director Oscar Sharp, playing &quot;The HoffBot&quot;. Hasselhoff&#x27;s lines were generated by a neural network artificial intelligence (called Benjamin) using a statistical model trained on his own 80s and 90s television performances.

The show was produced by the now defunct production company, Stripe Studios. It was later revealed that the company owed money to Hasselhoff. Stripe Studios along with nine other related entities went into receivership in March 2024 due to financial and legal issues. It is unsure if the television show will ever be publicly released. Managing director of Stripe Studios, Alex Breingan said that &quot;Hoff the Beaten Track&quot; was currently in post-production in December 2023.

==Music career==

===1970s===

On February 2, 1977, David Hasselhoff made his musical debut on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; performing &quot;Nadia&#x27;s Theme&quot;, the theme song from the American television soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, the show in which Hasselhoff was starring at the time. Ten years later his version of the song was included on his second album &quot;Lovin&#x27; Feelings&quot; (1987).

===1980s===
Six years after his debut live performance, Hasselhoff released in 1983, his debut single &quot;I Get the Message&quot;. In 1984, Hasselhoff made a guest appearance on the first season of &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot;, performing &quot;Do You Love Me&quot;, which became the lead single from his upcoming debut studio album, &quot;Night Rocker&quot;, which was released in January 1985. The album was a big success in Austria, reaching number one there and being certified Platinum. In 1987, Hasselhoff released his second studio album, &quot;Lovin&#x27; Feelings&quot;, which reached the top-twenty in Austria and West Germany, and being certified Gold in the former country. That same year, due to the popularity of &quot;Knight Rider&quot; in Europe at the time, Hasselhoff embarked on his first headlining tour across Austria, with a special guest appearance from KITT.

In 1988, Hasselhoff released the song &quot;Looking for Freedom&quot;, which became a hit in Europe, especially in West Germany, where it reached number one for eight consecutive weeks. The song was also certified Platinum in West Germany and became the best-performing single of 1989 in the country. &quot;Looking for Freedom&quot; also topped the charts in Austria and Switzerland; and reached the top-twenty in France and Belgium. Due to its success, Hasselhoff released it on June 21, 1989, his third studio album of the same name, which was produced by German music producer Jack White. The album was a commercial success, reaching the top-five in Austria, West Germany and Switzerland; and being certified three-times Platinum in Europe. He was noted for his performance of the song at the Berlin Wall on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1989, two months after the Wall had come down, but nine months before unification took place. Wearing a piano-keyboard scarf and a leather jacket covered in motion lights, Hasselhoff stood in a bucket crane and performed the song along with the crowd. The performance has had a lasting impact on German pop-culture with Hasselhoff commenting that the song became an &quot;anthem&quot; and &quot;song of hope&quot; for the people of East Germany. In 2004, Hasselhoff lamented the lack of a photo of him in the Checkpoint Charlie Museum in Berlin. In July 1989, Hasselhoff released his first compilation album, &quot;Knight Lover&quot;, which contains 17 greatest hits from his first two albums &quot;Night Rocker&quot; and &quot;Lovin&#x27; Feelings&quot;. The album reached the top-twenty in Switzerland; and the top-forty in West Germany.

===1990s===

Following the breakthrough success of &quot;Looking for Freedom&quot;, Hasselhoff embarked on his second tour, The Freedom Tour, which took around April and May 1990, across West Germany and Switzerland. In August of that year, Hasselhoff released his fourth studio album, &quot;Crazy for You&quot;, which topped the charts in Austria and Switzerland, as well as reached the top-ten in West Germany, eventually becoming Hasselhoff&#x27;s biggest-selling album in his career. In September 1991, Hasselhoff released his fifth studio album, &quot;David&quot;, which matched the success of its predecessor, with both the album and its lead single &quot;Do The Limbo Dance&quot; reaching number one in Austria. That same year, in order to promote &quot;David&quot;, Hasselhoff embarked on his third tour, the Dreams Come True Tour, which took around November and December 1991, across Austria, Germany and Switzerland. In late 1991, two compilation albums were released: &quot;Looking for Freedom&quot; and &quot;For You&quot;, with the former album including hits from 1989 and 1990, and the latter including hits from 1985 to 1987; however, both albums failed to chart. In September 1992, Hasselhoff released his sixth studio album &quot;Everybody Sunshine&quot;, which became his last album being produced by Jack White, who collaborated with Hasselhoff since 1988. Though the album was certified Gold in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, it failed to reach the commercial heights of his three previous albums, &quot;Looking for Freedom&quot;, &quot;Crazy for You&quot; and &quot;David&quot;.

In November 1993, Hasselhoff released his seventh studio album &quot;You Are Everything&quot;, which also met with moderate success in Europe, though it reached the top-ten in Austria and was certified Gold. The songs &quot;If I Could Only Say Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Wir zwei allein&quot; became hits in Europe, with the former becoming his first UK chart entry ever peaking at number 35, and the latter becoming another top-ten hit in Austria, Germany and Switzerland. That same year, he released the single &quot;Pingu Dance&quot; based on the children&#x27;s show &quot;Pingu&quot;, and his fourth compilation album, &quot;Crazy for You&quot;, which contains several hits from 1989 to 1991, however, both releases failed to chart. In 1994, Hasselhoff toured across Germany in order to promote &quot;You Are Everything&quot;. That same year, he was scheduled to perform a concert on pay-per-view from Atlantic City. The concert was expected to help his singing career in the United States. However, on the night of the concert, O. J. Simpson was involved in his slow-speed chase in southern California. Viewership of the concert was significantly lower than expected due to the live coverage of the chase, and the event was ultimately a $1.5 million loss. Hasselhoff joked that &quot;90 million people watched O. J. and three people watched me, including me and my mom and my dad&quot;. Following this, Hasselhoff released his eighth studio album &quot;Du&quot;, which became Hasselhoff&#x27;s first studio album not to receive any certification in Europe, and also met with moderate success on European charts.

In 1995, Hasselhoff released four greatest hits albums, including his self-titled fifth compilation album, &quot;David Hasselhoff&quot;, released on April 11, 1995, in the United States, which became his first album in eight years since &quot;Lovin&#x27; Feelings&quot; (1987) to be released in the US. The record includes several songs from the albums &quot;You Are Everything&quot; and &quot;Du&quot;. A new recording, called &quot;Fallin&#x27; in Love&quot;, was released as the only single from the album. To promote &quot;David Hasselhoff&quot;, Hasselhoff performed for the first time &quot;Fallin&#x27; in Love&quot; on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; aired on April 13, 1995. As attempting to launch his singing career in the US, both the album and the single &quot;Fallin&#x27; in Love&quot; were commercially unsuccessful, as failed to enter any &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. His sixth and seventh compilation albums, &quot;Watch Out for the Bay&quot; and &quot;Is Everybody Happy&quot; were released in mid-1995, with the former album including songs from 1985 to 1987; and the latter, from 1989 to 1991; however, both albums failed to chart as well. His eighth compilation album, &quot;Looking for... the Best&quot; was released in October 1995, which contains 18 greatest hits from 1989 to 1994, including the hits &quot;Looking for Freedom&quot; (1988), &quot;Crazy for You&quot; (1990), &quot;Do The Limbo Dance&quot; (1991), &quot;Everybody Sunshine&quot; (1992), &quot;Wir zwei allein&quot; (1993) and &quot;Du&quot; (1994), as well as the US single &quot;Fallin&#x27; in Love&quot; (1995), and a new recording, titled &quot;I Believe&quot; with Laura Branigan. The album charted in Austria, peaking at number 50.

Two years later, in 1997, Hasselhoff signed with Polydor Records and released his ninth studio album, &quot;Hooked on a Feeling&quot;. The album became Hasselhoff&#x27;s least successful album to that point in his career, becoming his first studio album that failed to chart in Germany. In 1999, a ninth compilation album was released, &quot;Watch Out for Hasselhoff&quot;.

===2000s===

Between 2001 and 2004, two more compilations were released, &quot;The Very Best Of&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. Seven years after the release of &quot;Hooked on a Feeling&quot;, Hasselhoff returned to the music scene with his tenth studio album, &quot;David Hasselhoff Sings America&quot;, released in August 2004, with the album performing slightly better on European charts, peaking at numbers 11 and 27 in Austria and Germany, respectively. That same year, Hasselhoff released his eleventh studio album, which became his first Christmas album, &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot;. The album met with negative reviews and failed to enter any chart. In 2006, Hasselhoff released &quot;Jump in My Car&quot;, which debuted at number three on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Hasselhoff&#x27;s first and only top-ten single in the UK. It also became his first and only Australian chart entry, peaking at number 50.

In May 2006, Hasselhoff was mentioned in an interview of Dirk Nowitzki, an NBA star playing for the Dallas Mavericks and a native of Germany. Nowitzki was asked what he does to concentrate when shooting foul shots. Dirk replied that he sings &quot;Looking for Freedom&quot; to himself. He meant this as a joke but it was thought to be a serious answer. Shortly thereafter, Hasselhoff attended the May 26, 2006, Mavericks home playoff game where they faced the Phoenix Suns in the NBA Western Conference Finals. Interviewed by Craig Sager, Hasselhoff stated he was as much a fan of Nowitzki as Nowitzki was a fan of him. In The 2006 NBA Finals, fans of the Miami Heat in the American Airlines Arena held up facial photos of Hasselhoff and chanted his name when Nowitzki went to the foul line. On August 2, 2006, he proclaimed himself &quot;King of the Internet&quot; in a tongue-in-cheek advertisement for Pipex. In December 2008, he sang the national anthem at the NCAA Las Vegas Bowl. Although the game was televised live by ESPN, the station chose not to broadcast Hasselhoff&#x27;s performance. In 2008, a twelfth compilation was released under the title of &quot;Das Allerbeste&quot;.

===2010s===

Seven years after his last album, Hasselhoff released in 2011 his twelfth studio album, &quot;A Real Good Feeling&quot;, which reached number three in Austria, the top-thirty in Germany and became Hasselhoff&#x27;s first album in fourteen years since &quot;Hooked on a Feeling&quot; (1997) to chart in Switzerland. Hasselhoff toured across those countries to promote the album. In 2012, he released his thirteen studio album &quot;This Time Around&quot;, however, it failed to chart.

In 2015, he recorded the single &quot;True Survivor&quot;, accompanied by a music video, which featured as the lead track for the 2015 Swedish short film &quot;Kung Fury&quot;. The song was composed by Mitch Murder (Johan Bengtsson). Recorded in Sweden, the song and the video is designed as an ostentatious over-the-top 1980s homage/parody, with the video featuring dinosaurs, kung fu, Adolf Hitler, skateboarding, Norse Gods and time travelling. Hasselhoff claimed that he had received the offer to record the song and the video by a request from Sweden Universal to &quot;sing a tribute to the &#x27;80s&quot;. Hasselhoff performed a live version of the song during the 2016 Guldbagge Awards. &quot;True Survivor&quot; debuted and peaked at number 94 on the Canadian Hot 100, becoming his first chart entry in Canada. In 2017, a retro music video called &quot;Guardians&#x27; Inferno&quot; was released as a bonus on the &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot; home release, where Hasselhoff does the singing.

In September 2019, Hasselhoff released his fourteenth studio album, &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;. The album consists of covers of popular songs such as &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; and &quot;Lips Like Sugar&quot;, with all but one song featuring collaborations from other artists, including Todd Rundgren and Steve Stevens. The album charted in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, with the former reaching the top-thirty there. A promotional music video for the title track was released on YouTube on September 9, followed by the album&#x27;s release on CD, vinyl, digital download and streaming services on September 27, 2019. To promote the album, as well as celebrating the 30th anniversary of the album &quot;Looking for Freedom&quot; and the song of the same name, Hasselhoff toured across Austria, Germany and Switzerland on the Freedom! The Journey Continues Tour, which took place in October 2019.

===2020s===

On December 10, 2020, Hasselhoff released his first heavy metal song titled &quot;Through The Night&quot;. The song was recorded alongside CueStack, an Austrian duo who also enlisted the help of Beartooth frontman Caleb Shomo to produce a retro synth-wave remix of the song.

==Personal life==

Hasselhoff&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Making Waves&quot; was released in the UK in September 2006. In an interview in April 2006, he said the book would present the &quot;last chapter&quot; regarding controversial elements of his personal life.

In November 2015, Hasselhoff posted a YouTube video in which he announced that he had changed his name to &quot;David Hoff&quot;. It was then reported that he was not changing his name; that the video was an excerpt from an upcoming advertising campaign.

After touring Glasgow in late 2015, Hasselhoff stated that he supports Scottish football team Partick Thistle F.C.

===Family===

Hasselhoff was married to actress Catherine Hickland from March 24, 1984, to March 1, 1989. Their wedding was recreated in the &quot;Knight Rider&quot; season 4 episode &quot;The Scent of Roses&quot; which first aired on January 3, 1986.

Hasselhoff married actress Pamela Bach in December 1989. The couple have two daughters: Taylor Ann Hasselhoff, born May 5, 1990, who attended the University of Arizona and was cast for the 2015 season of &quot;Rich Kids of Beverly Hills&quot;, and actress Hayley Hasselhoff, born August 26, 1992. In January 2006, Hasselhoff announced he was filing for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. Their divorce was finalized in August 2006. Bach was given custody of one daughter and Hasselhoff custody of the other, until Hasselhoff later obtained custody of both. he resided in Southern California with his daughters.

In late 2011, Hasselhoff began dating Hayley Roberts, from the town of Glynneath in Wales. As a new couple they attended Gordon Ramsay&#x27;s Christmas special of that year. In the 2012 sequel, when asked about engagement they related how they had discussed it. On July 31, 2018 they married in Apulia, and in August they honeymooned in the Maldives.
Hasselhoff is a fan of Welsh rugby union, and the couple regularly attend matches in Wales.

In May 2016, Hasselhoff said he could not afford alimony of $252k a year to Bach anymore, because he had less than $4000 in cash to his name. He made $112k a month, but spent $66k and due to alimony, taxes and living expenses he had little left. In September 2017, Hasselhoff filed formal requests to end alimony payments and cited his ex-wife&#x27;s &quot;failure to make any efforts to become self supporting, contribute to her own support, or even make any efforts to gain job skills.&quot; Hasselhoff and Bach reached an agreement which reduced payments since December 1, 2017, from $10,000 to $5,000 per month.

=== Alcoholism ===
On May 3, 2007, a viral video surfaced online of Hasselhoff appearing to be severely drunk inside his home. His daughter, Taylor Ann, who filmed the video, can be heard interrogating him and asking him to stop abusing alcohol. She also warns her father he could be jeopardizing his spot on the Las Vegas production of &quot;The Producers&quot; he starred in at the time. In the wake of the leaked clip, Hasselhoff issued a statement saying it was recorded by Taylor Ann so that he could see how he behaved while intoxicated and the footage was deliberately released. As a result of the video, Hasselhoff&#x27;s visitation rights with his two daughters were suspended on May 7, 2007, for two weeks until the video&#x27;s authenticity and distributor were determined. In May 2009, Hasselhoff&#x27;s attorney, Mel Goldsman, described Hasselhoff as &quot;a recovering alcoholic&quot;.

<text>Paper size refers to standardized dimensions for sheets of paper used globally in stationery, printing, and technical drawing. Most countries adhere to the ISO 216 standard, which includes the widely recognized A series (including A4 paper), defined by a consistent aspect ratio of √2. The system, first proposed in the 18th century and formalized in 1975, allows scaling between sizes without distortion. Regional variations exist, such as the North American paper sizes (e.g., Letter, Legal, and Ledger) which are governed by the ANSI and are used in North America and parts of Central and South America.

The standardization of paper sizes emerged from practical needs for efficiency. The ISO 216 system originated in late-18th-century Germany as DIN 476, later adopted internationally for its mathematical precision. The origins of North American sizes are lost in tradition and not well documented, although the Letter size () became dominant in the US and Canada due to historical trade practices and governmental adoption in the 20th century. Other historical systems, such as the British &quot;Foolscap&quot; and Imperial sizes, have largely been phased out in favour of ISO or ANSI standards.

Regional preferences reflect cultural and industrial legacies. In addition to ISO and ANSI standards, Japan uses its JIS P 0138 system, which closely aligns with ISO 216 but includes unique B-series variants commonly used for books and posters. Specialized industries also employ non-standard sizes: newspapers use custom formats like Berliner and broadsheet, while envelopes and business cards follow distinct sizing conventions. The international standard for envelopes is the C series of ISO 269.

== International standard paper sizes==


The international paper size standard is ISO 216. It is based on the German DIN 476 standard for paper sizes. Each ISO paper size is one half of the area of the next larger size in the same series. ISO paper sizes are all based on a single aspect ratio of the square root of 2, or approximately 1:1.41421. There are different series, as well as several extensions.

The following international paper sizes are included in Cascading Style Sheets (CSS): &quot;A3&quot;, &quot;A4&quot;, &quot;A5&quot;, &quot;B4&quot;, &quot;B5&quot;.

===A series===
There are 11 sizes in the A series, designated A0–A10, all of which have an aspect ratio of formula_1, where &quot;a&quot; is the long side and &quot;b&quot; is the short side.

Since A series sizes share the same aspect ratio formula_2 they can be scaled to other A series sizes without being distorted, and two sheets can be reduced to fit on exactly one sheet without any cutoff or margins.

The A0 base size is defined as having an area of 1 m; given an aspect ratio of formula_3, the dimensions of A0 are:

formula_4 by formula_5.

or, rounded to the nearest millimetre, .

A series sizes are related in that the smaller dimension of a given size is the larger dimension of the next smaller size, and folding an A series sheet in half in its larger dimension—that is, folding it in half parallel to its short edge—results in two halves that are each the size of the next smaller A series size. As such, a folded brochure of a given A-series size can be made by folding sheets of the next larger size in half, e.g. A4 sheets can be folded to make an A5 brochure. The fact that halving a sheet with an aspect ratio of formula_3 results in two sheets that themselves both have an aspect ratio of formula_3 is proven as follows:

formula_8

where &quot;a&quot; is the long side and &quot;b&quot; is the short side. The aspect ratio for the new dimensions of the folded paper is:

formula_9

The advantages of basing a paper size upon an aspect ratio of formula_3 were noted in 1786 by the German scientist and philosopher Georg Christoph Lichtenberg. He also observed that some raw sizes already adhered to that ratio so that when a sheet is folded, the length to width ratio does not change.

Briefly after the introduction of the metric system, a handful of new paper formats equivalent to modern ones were developed in France, having been proposed by the mathematician Lazare Carnot, and published for judicial purposes in 1798 during the French Revolution:

* (A2)
* (A3)
* (B3)
* (B4)
* (B5)
* (half-B5)

These were never widely adopted, however.

Early in the 20th century, the ratio was used to specify the &quot;world format&quot; starting with as the short edge of the smallest size. Walter Porstmann started with the largest sizes instead, assigning one an area of (A0) and the other a short edge of (B0). He thereby turned the forgotten French sizes (relatively few in number) into a logically-simple and comprehensive plan for a full range of paper sizes, while introducing systematic alphanumeric monikers for them. Generalized to nothing less than four series, this system was introduced as a DIN standard (DIN 476) in Germany in 1922, replacing a vast variety of other paper formats. Even today, the paper sizes are called &quot;DIN A4&quot; () in everyday use in Germany and Austria.

The DIN 476 standard spread quickly to other countries. Before the outbreak of World War II, it had been adopted by the following countries in Europe:
* Belgium (1924)
* Netherlands (1925)
* Norway (1926)
* Finland (1927)
* Switzerland (1929)
* Sweden (1930) with later extensions
* Soviet Union (1934) with custom extensions
* Hungary (1938)
* Italy (1939)
During World War II, the standard spread to South America and was adopted by Uruguay (1942), Argentina (1943) and Brazil (1943), and afterwards spread to other countries:
* Australia (1974)
* Austria (1948)
* Bangladesh (1972)
* Barbados (1973)
* Chile (1968)
* Colombia (1975)
* Czechoslovakia (1953)
* Denmark (1953)
* Ecuador (1974)
* France (1967)
* Greece (1970)
* Iceland (1964)
* India (1957) with custom extensions
* Iran (1948)
* Ireland (1959)
* Israel (1954)
* Japan (1951) with different B series
* Kuwait (1975)
* Mexico (1965)
* New Zealand (1963)
* Peru (1967)
* Poland (1957)
* Portugal (1954)
* Rhodesia (1970)
* Romania (1949)
* Singapore (1970)
* South Africa (1966)
* Spain (1947)
* Thailand (1973)
* Turkey (1967)
* United Kingdom (1971)
* Venezuela (1962)
* Yugoslavia(1956)
By 1975, so many countries were using the German system that it was established as an ISO standard, as well as the official United Nations document format. By 1977, A4 was the standard letter format in 88 of 148 countries. Today the standard has been adopted by all countries in the world except the United States and Canada. In Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia, Venezuela, Chile, and the Philippines, the US letter format is still in common use, despite their official adoption of the ISO standard.

The weight of an A-series sheet of a given paper weight can be calculated by knowing the ratio of its size to the A0 sheet. For example, an A4 sheet is the size of an A0 sheet, so if it is made from paper, it weighs of , which is .

===B series===
The B series paper sizes are less common than the A series. They have the same aspect ratio as the A series:

formula_11

However, they have a different area. The area of B series sheets is in fact the geometric mean of successive A series sheets. B1 is between A0 and A1 in size, with an area of formula_12 m, or about . As a result, B0 is 1 metre wide, and other sizes of the series are a half, a quarter, or further fractions of a metre wide: in general, every B size has exactly one side of length formula_13 for formula_14. That side is the short side for B0, B2, B4, etc., and the long side for B1, B3, B5, etc.

While less common in office use, the B series is used for a variety of applications in which one A-series size would be too small but the next A-series size is too large, or because they are convenient for a particular purpose.

* B4, B5, and B6 are used for envelopes that will hold C-series envelopes.
* B4 is quite common in printed music sheets.
* B5 is a relatively common choice for books.
* B7 is equal to the passport size ID-3 from ISO/IEC 7810.
* Many posters use B-series paper or a close approximation, such as 50 cm × 70 cm ~ B2.
The B-series is widely used in the printing industry to describe both paper sizes and printing press sizes, including digital presses. B3 paper is used to print two US letter or A4 pages side by side using imposition; four pages would be printed on B2, eight on B1, etc.

===C series===

The C series is defined in ISO 269, which was withdrawn in 2009 without a replacement, but is still specified in several national standards. It is primarily used for envelopes. The area of C series sheets is the geometric mean of the areas of the A and B series sheets of the same number; for instance, the area of a C4 sheet is the geometric mean of the areas of an A4 sheet and a B4 sheet. This means that C4 is slightly larger than A4, and slightly smaller than B4. The practical usage of this is that a letter written on A4 paper fits inside a C4 envelope, and both A4 paper and C4 envelope fits inside a B4 envelope.

Some envelope formats with mixed sides from adjacent sizes (and thus an approximate aspect ratio of 2:1) are also defined in national adaptations of the ISO standard, e.g. DIN C6/C5 (also known as C65) is 114 mm × 229 mm where the common side to C5 and C6 is 162 mm. This format allows an envelope holding an A-sized paper folded in three, e.g. for the C65, an A4.

=== Overview of ISO paper sizes ===
The formula_15 variables are the distinct first terms in the three geometric progressions of the same &quot;common ratio&quot; equal to the square root of two. Each of the three geometric progressions (corresponding to the three series A, B, and C) is formed by all possible paper dimensions (length and width) of the series arranged in decreasing order. This interesting arrangement of dimensions is also very useful—not only does it form a geometric progression with easy-to-remember formulae, but also each consecutive pair of values (like a sliding window of size 2) will automatically correspond to the dimensions of a standard paper format in the series.

The tolerances specified in the standard are

* ± for dimensions up to ,
* ± for lengths in the range and
* ± for any dimension above .

====German original====

The German standard DIN 476 was published on 18 August 1922 and is the original specification of the A, B and C sizes. In 1991, it was split into DIN 476-1 for the A and B formats and 476-2 for the C series. The former has been withdrawn in 2002 in favour of adopting the international standard as DIN EN ISO 216, but part 2 has been retained and was last updated in 2008.

The first and the second editions of DIN 476 from 1922 and 1925 also included a D series.

The smallest formats in the original specifications for each series were A13, B13, C8, and D8. Sizes A11 through A13 were no longer listed in the 1930 edition, nor were B11 through B13. C9 and C10 were added in the 1976 revision for compatibility with photography sizes: C8 closely matches 6×9 photos, and C9 and C10 closely match 7×7 and 5×5 slides, respectively.

DIN 476 provides for formats larger than A0, denoted by a prefix factor. In particular, it lists the formats 2A0 and 4A0, which are twice and four times the size of A0 respectively. However, ISO 216:2007 notes 2A0 and 4A0 in the table of &quot;Main series of trimmed sizes&quot; (ISO A series) as well: &quot;The rarely used sizes [2A0 and 4A0] which follow also belong to this series.&quot;

DIN 476 also used to specify slightly tighter tolerances than ISO 216:

* ± for dimensions up to ,
* ± for lengths in the range and
* ± for any dimension above .

There used to be a standard, DIN 198, that was just a table of recommended A series formats for a number of business applications. The 1976 edition of this standard introduced a size A4 and suggested it for some forms and slips.

====Swedish extensions====
The Swedish standard SIS 01 47 11 generalized the ISO system of A, B, and C formats by adding D, E, F, and G formats to it. Its D format sits between a B format and the next larger A format (just like C sits between A and the next larger B). The remaining formats fit in between all these formats, such that the sequence of formats A4, E4, C4, G4, B4, F4, D4, *H4, A3 is a geometric progression, in which the dimensions grow by a factor formula_16 from one size to the next. However, this SIS standard does not define any size between a D format and the next larger A format (called *H in the previous example).

Of these additional formats, G5 (169 × 239 mm) and E5 (155 × 220 mm) are popular in Sweden and the Netherlands for printing dissertations, but the other formats have not turned out to be particularly useful in practice. They have not been adopted internationally and the Swedish standard has been withdrawn.

The Swedish and German D series basically contain the same sizes but are offset by one, i.e. DIN D4 equals SIS D5 and so on.

====Japanese variation====

The Japanese standard JIS P 0138 defines two main series of paper sizes. The JIS A-series is identical to the ISO A-series except that it has slightly different tolerances. The area of B-series paper is 1.5 times that of the corresponding A-paper (instead of the factor formula_17 for the ISO B-series), so the length ratio is approximately 1.22 times the length of the corresponding A-series paper. The aspect ratio of the paper is the same as for the A-series paper. Both A- and B-series paper are widely available in Japan, Taiwan and China, and most photocopiers are loaded with at least A4 and either one of A3, B4, and B5 paper.

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) only supports the most popular of the Japanese sizes, &quot;JIS-B4&quot; and &quot;JIS-B5&quot;.

A popular size for books, dubbed AB, combines the shorter edges of A4 and B4. Another two with an aspect ratio approximating 16:9 are 20% narrower variants of A6 and B6, respectively, the latter resulting from cutting JIS B1 into sheets (thus &quot;B40&quot;).

There are also a number of traditional paper sizes, which are now used mostly by printers. The most common of these old series is the and the paper sizes.

====Chinese extensions====

The Chinese standard GB/T 148–1997, which replaced GB 148–1989, documents the standard ISO series, A and B, but adds a custom D series. This Chinese format originates from the Republic of China (1912–1949). The D series is not identical to the German or Swedish D series. It does not strictly follow the same principles as ISO paper sizes: The aspect ratio is only very roughly formula_3. The short side of the size is always 4 mm longer than the long side of the next smaller size. The long side of the size is always exactly – i.e. without further rounding – twice as long as the short side of the next smaller size.

==== Indian variants ====
The &quot;Bureau of Indian Standards&quot; recommends the &quot;ISO-A series&quot; size of drawing sheet for engineering drawing works. The Bureau of Indian Standards specifies all the recommendations for engineering drawing sheets in its bulletin IS 10711: 2001.

The Bureau extended the ISO-A series with a Special Elongated Sizes (Second Choice). These sizes are achieved by increasing the shorter dimensions of a sheet of the ISO A series to lengths that are multiples of the shorter dimensions of the chosen basic sheet; in effect, all of the Indian elongated sizes emulate having several regular-size sheets joined on their long edge.

There is also a Exceptional Elongated Sizes (Third Choice). These sizes are obtained by increasing the shorter dimensions of a sheet of the ISO-A series to lengths that are multiples of the shorter dimensions of the chosen basic sheet. These sizes are used when a very large or extra elongated sheet is needed.

====Soviet variants====

The first standard of paper size in the Soviet Union was OST 303 in 1926. Six years later, it was replaced by OST 5115 which generally followed DIN 476 principles, but used Cyrillic lowercase letters instead of Latin uppercase, had the second row shifted so that б0 (B0) roughly corresponded to B1 and, more importantly, had slightly different sizes:

The general adaptation of ISO 216 in the Soviet Union, which replaced OST 5115, was GOST 9327. In its 1960 version, it lists formats down to A13, B12 and C8 and also specifies , and prefixes for halving the shorter side (repeatedly) for stripe formats, e.g. A4 = 105 mm × 297 mm.
A standard for technical drawings from 1960, GOST 3450, introduces alternative numeric format designations to deal with very high or very wide sheets.
These 2-digit codes are based upon A4 = &quot;11&quot;: The first digit is the factor the longer side (297 mm) is multiplied by and the second digit is the one for the shorter side (210 mm), so &quot;24&quot; is 2×297 mm × 4×210 mm = 594 mm × 840 mm.


GOST 3450 from 1960 was replaced by ESKD GOST 2301 in 1968, but the numeric designations remained in popular use much longer.
The new designations were not purely numeric but consisted of the ISO label followed by an &#x27;x&#x27;, or possibly the multiplication sign &#x27;×&#x27;, and the factor, e.g. DIN 2A0 = GOST A0×2, but DIN 4A0 ≠ GOST A0×4, also listed are: A0×3, A1×3, A1×4, A2×3–A2×5, A3×3–A3×7, A4×3–A4×9. The formats ...×1 and ...×2 usually would be aliases for existing formats.

===Elongated sizes===

ISO 5457, last updated in 1999, introduces elongated sizes that are formed by a combination of the dimensions of the short side of an A-size (e.g. A2) with the dimensions of the long side of another larger A-size (e.g. A0). The result is a new size, for example with the abbreviation A2.0 we would have a mm size.


These drawing paper sizes have been adopted by ANSI/ASME Y14.1M for use in the United States, alongside A0 through A4 and alongside inch-based sizes.

=== International envelope and insert sizes ===

DIN 5008 (previously DIN 676) prescribes, among many other things, two variants, A and B, for the location of the address field on the first page of a business letter and how to fold the A4 sheet accordingly, so the only part visible of the main content is the subject line.

===International raw sizes===

ISO 5457 specifies drawing paper sizes with a trimmed size equal to the A series sizes from A4 upward. The untrimmed sizes are 3 to 4 cm larger and rounded to the nearest centimetre. A0 through A3 are used in landscape orientation, while A4 is used in portrait orientation. Designations for pre-printed drawing paper include the base sizes and a suffix, either &quot;T&quot; for trimmed or &quot;U&quot; for untrimmed sheets.

The withdrawn standard ISO 2784 did specify sizes of continuous, fan-fold forms based upon whole inches as was common for paper in continuous lengths in automatic data processing (ADP) equipment. Specifically, was considered an untrimmed variant of the A4 height of 297 mm.

== Transitional paper sizes ==

=== PA4 or L4 ===

A transitional size called PA4 (), sometimes dubbed L4, was proposed for inclusion into the ISO 216 standard in 1975. It has the height of Canadian P4 paper (215 mm × 280 mm, about  in × 11 in) and the width of international A4 paper (), i.e. it uses the smaller value among the two for each side. The table shows how this format can be generalized into an entire format series.

The PA formats did not end up in ISO 216, because the committee decided that the set of standardized paper formats should be kept to the minimum necessary. However, PA4 remains of practical use today. In landscape orientation, it has the same 4:3 aspect ratio as the displays of traditional TV sets, some computer displays (e.g. the iPad) and data projectors. PA4, with appropriate margins is, therefore, a good choice as the format of presentation slides.

As a compromise between the two most popular paper sizes globally, PA4 is used today by many international magazines, because it can be printed easily on equipment designed for either A4 or US Letter. That means (in practice) it has turned out to be not so much a paper size as a page format. Apple, for instance, requires this format for digital music album booklets.

The size 210 mm × 280 mm was documented in the Canadian standard CAN2-200.2-M79 &quot;Common Image Area for Paper Sizes P4 and A4&quot;.

===F4===

A non-standard F4 paper size is common in Southeast Asia. It is a transitional size with the shorter side of ISO A4 (210 mm, inch) and the longer side of British &quot;Foolscap&quot; (. ISO A4 is exactly 90% the height of F4.
This size is sometimes also known as (metric) &#x27;foolscap&#x27; or &#x27;folio&#x27;.

In some countries, the narrow side of F4 is slightly broader: 8.5 inches (216 mm) or 215 mm. It is then equivalent to the US &quot;Government Legal&quot; and &quot;Foolscap Folio&quot; sizes.

In Indonesia, where it is the legally-mandated paper size for use in the printing of national legislation, it is sometimes called &quot;Folio&quot; or &quot;HVS&quot; (from , &quot;wood-free writing paper&quot;). 
In Philippines, it is commonly called &quot;long bond&quot; as opposed to &quot;short bond&quot; which refers to the US Letter paper size.

A sheet of F4 can be cut from a sheet of SRA4 with very little wastage. The size is also smaller than its Swedish equivalent SIS F4 at 239 mm × 338 mm.

The (&#x27;world format&#x27;) was developed by German chemist Wilhelm Ostwald in 1911 as part of Die Brücke, around the same time DIN 476 was first discussed. It shares the same design primitives, especially the aspect ratio, but is based upon 1 cm as the short edge of the smallest size. Sizes were designated by roman numerals. The result, for the fourth through fourteenth size, is close to the DIN/ISO C series.

The sizes have been used for some print products in the early 20th century in central Europe but got replaced by DIN sizes almost entirely. However, it was successfully adopted from 1913 onwards for posters and placards in Switzerland. Even today, the default size for posters in Swiss advertisements, F4, is colloquially known as , although it measures 895 mm × 1280 mm, i.e. 1 cm less than size XIV. This poster size goes alongside F12 2685 mm × 1280 mm (3 × F4) and F24 2685 mm × 2560 mm (2 × 3 × F4), as well as F200 &quot;Cityformat&quot; 1165 mm × 1700 mm.

=== A0a ===
Though many countries have moved towards adopting ISO metric paper sizes, the transition towards this has led to at least one new paper size that differs slightly to those used internationally. British architects and industrial designers once used a size called &quot;Antiquarian&quot;, , as listed above, but given in the &quot;New Metric Handbook&quot; (Tutt &amp; Adler 1981) as for board size. This size is a little larger than ISO A0 (841 mm x 1189 mm), and for a short time, a size called A0a of was used in Britain, which was in reality a slightly shorter version of ISO B0 (1414 mm).

=== Pliego ===

The most common paper sizes used for commercial and industrial printing in Colombia are based upon a size referred to as &quot;pliego&quot; that is ISO B1 (707 mm × 1000 mm) cut to full decimetres. Smaller sizes are derived by halving, and are indicated by a vulgar fraction prefix, such as &quot; pliego&quot; and &quot; pliego&quot;.

=== K===
In East Asia – Japan, Taiwan, and China in particular – there are a number of similar paper sizes in common use for book-making and other purposes. A single designation is often used with slightly different edge measurements: the base sheet is labelled 1K (or , where &quot;K&quot; standards for , or in Japanese); all smaller sizes are derived by halving the power of 2 number, &quot;i&quot; = 2, in front of the uppercase letter &quot;K&quot;. The number in ISO designations, in contrast, is the exponent &quot;n&quot; that would yield the number of sheets cut from the base sizes.

The sizes of such folios depend on the base sheet. Pre-metric standards include:

* The imperial , named after the &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot; watermark on imperial paper, measuring 636 mm × 939 mm.
* The four-by-six (4×6 or 4/6), where the final size at 32K was measured 4 by 6 in Japan, roughly  mm, or slightly more, mm i.e. .
** In Taiwan, the traditional base size 1K inherited from Japan is sometimes quoted as measuring inches exactly, which is off by roughly 1 millimetre from the commonly quoted metric base size of  mm, which is directly derived from or .
* The three-by-five (3×5 or 3/5), where the final size at 32K is slightly less than 3 by 5 , often given as  mm which would be approximately .

The 4/6 standard has given rise to newer metric book-size standards, including:

* The modern Japanese size for books, simply labeled &quot;B&quot; and is specified as  millimetres. It is not directly related to the similar JIS B series, where B1 is slightly smaller.
* The Chinese SAC D series.


== North American paper sizes ==

===Inch-based loose sizes===


The United States, Canada, and the Philippines primarily use a different system of paper sizes from the rest of the world. The current standard sizes are unique to those countries, although due to the size of the North American market and proliferation of both software and printing hardware from the region, other parts of the world have become increasingly familiar with these sizes (though not necessarily the paper itself). Some traditional North American inch-based sizes differ from the Imperial British sizes described below.

==== Common American loose sizes====
&quot;Letter, Legal&quot; and &quot;Ledger/Tabloid&quot; are by far the most commonly used of these for everyday activities, and the only ones included in Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

The origins of the exact dimensions of Letter size paper are lost in tradition and not well documented. The American Forest and Paper Association argues that the dimension originates from the days of manual papermaking and that the 11-inch length of the page is about a quarter of &quot;the average maximum stretch of an experienced vatman&#x27;s arms.&quot; However, this does not explain the width or aspect ratio.

Outside of North America, Letter size may also be known as &quot;American Quarto&quot;. If one accepts some trimming, the size is indeed one quarter of the old Imperial paper size known as Demy, .

Manufacturers of computer printers, however, recognize inch-based &quot;Quarto&quot; as or long.

==== Usage and adoption ====

US paper sizes are currently standard in the United States and are the most commonly used formats at least in the Philippines, most of Mesoamerica and Chile. The latter use US Letter, but their Legal size is 13 inches tall (recognized as &quot;Foolscap&quot; by printer manufacturers), i.e. one inch shorter than its US equivalent.
Mexico and Colombia, for instance, have adopted the ISO standard, but the US Letter format is still the system in use throughout the country. It is rare to encounter ISO standard papers in day-to-day uses, with (Letter), (Government-Legal), and (Ledger/Tabloid) being nearly universal. Printer manufacturers, however, recognize as long.

In Canada, select US paper sizes are a &quot;de facto&quot; standard.

====Variant American loose sizes====

There is an additional paper size, , to which the name &quot;Government-Letter&quot; was given by the IEEE Printer Working Group (PWG). It was prescribed by Herbert Hoover when he was Secretary of Commerce to be used for US government forms, apparently to enable discounts from the purchase of paper for schools, but more likely due to the standard use of trimming books (after binding) and paper from the standard letter size paper to produce consistency and allow &quot;bleed&quot; printing. In later years, as photocopy machines proliferated, citizens wanted to make photocopies of the forms, but the machines did not generally have this size of paper in their bins. Ronald Reagan therefore had the US government switch to regular Letter size, which is half an inch both longer and wider. The former government size is still commonly used in spiral-bound notebooks, for children&#x27;s writing and the like, a result of trimming from the current Letter dimensions.
By extension of the American standards, the halved Letter size, , meets the needs of many applications. It is variably known as &quot;Statement&quot;, &quot;Stationery&quot;, &quot;Memo&quot;, &quot;Half Letter&quot;, &quot;Half A&quot; (from ANSI sizes) or simply &quot;Half Size&quot;, and as &quot;Invoice&quot; by printer manufacturers. Like the similar-sized ISO A5, it is used for everything from personal letter writing to official aeronautical maps. Organizers, notepads, and diaries also often use this size of paper; thus 3-ring binders are also available in this size. Booklets of this size are created using word processing tools with landscape printing in two columns on letter paper which are then cut or folded into the final size.

A foot-long sheet with the common width of Letter and (Government) Legal, i.e. , would have an aspect ratio very close to the square root of two as used by international paper sizes and would actually almost exactly match ISO RA4 (215 mm × 305 mm). This size is sometimes known as &quot;European Fanfold&quot;.
While &quot;Executive&quot; refers to in America, the Japanese organization for standardization specified it as , which is elsewhere known as Government Legal or Foolscap.

====Standardized American paper sizes====
In 1996, the American National Standards Institute adopted ANSI/ASME Y14.1 which defined a regular series of paper sizes based upon the &quot;de facto&quot; standard Letter size which it assigned &quot;ANSI A&quot;, intended for technical drawings, hence sometimes labeled &quot;Engineering&quot;. This series is somewhat similar to the ISO standard in that cutting a sheet in half would produce two sheets of the next smaller size and therefore also includes Ledger/Tabloid as &quot;ANSI B&quot;. Unlike the ISO standard, however, the arbitrary base sides forces this series to have two alternating aspect ratios. For example, ANSI A is less elongated than A4, while ANSI B is more elongated than A3.

The Canadian standard CAN2 9.60-M76 and its successor CAN/CGSB 9.60-94 &quot;Paper Sizes for Correspondence&quot; specified paper sizes P1 through P6, which are the U.S. paper sizes rounded to the nearest 5 mm. All custom Canadian paper size standards were withdrawn in 2012.

With care, documents can be prepared so that the text and images fit on either ANSI or their equivalent ISO sheets at a 1:1 reproduction scale.

Other, informal, larger sizes continuing the alphabetic series illustrated above exist, but they are not part of the series &quot;per se&quot;, because they do not exhibit the same aspect ratios. For example, Engineering F size is with approximately 1.4286:1; it is commonly required for NAVFAC drawings, but is generally less commonly used. Engineering G size is high, but it is a roll format with a variable width up to in increments of . Engineering H through N sizes are also roll formats.

Such huge sheets were at one time used for full-scale layouts of aircraft parts, automotive parts, wiring harnesses, and the like, but are slowly being phased out, due to widespread use of computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM). Some visual arts fields also continue to use these paper formats for large-scale printouts, such as for displaying digitally painted character renderings at life-size as references for makeup artists and costume designers or to provide an immersive landscape reference.

==== Architectural sizes ====
In addition to the system as listed above, there is a corresponding series of paper sizes used for architectural purposes defined in the same standard, ANSI/ASME Y14.1, which is usually abbreviated &quot;Arch&quot;. This series also shares the property that bisecting each size produces two of the size below, with alternating aspect ratios. It may be preferred by North American architects because the aspect ratios (4:3 and 3:2) are ratios of small integers, unlike their ANSI (or ISO) counterparts. Furthermore, the aspect ratio 4:3 matches the traditional aspect ratio for computer displays.

The size Arch E1 has a different aspect ratio because it derives from adding 6 inches to each side of Arch D or subtracting the same amount from Arch E. Printer manufacturer recognize it as &quot;wide-format&quot;. An intermediate size between Arch C and D with a long side of does not exist.


===Demitab===

The demitab or demi-tab (a portmanteau of the French word (&#x27;half&#x27;) and &#x27;tabloid&#x27;) is , i.e. roughly one half of a sheet of tabloid-size paper.

&quot;Demitab&quot;, &quot;broadsheet&quot; or &quot;tabloid&quot; format newspapers are not necessarily printed on paper measuring exactly their nominal size.

=== Notebook sizes ===

The sizes listed above are for paper sold loose in reams. There are many sizes of tablets of paper, that is, sheets of paper bound at one edge, usually by a strip of plastic or hardened PVA adhesive. Often there is a pad of cardboard (also known as paperboard or greyboard) at the bottom of the stack. Such a tablet serves as a portable writing surface, and the sheets often have lines printed on them, usually in non-repro blue, to make writing in a line easier. An older means of binding is to have the sheets stapled to the cardboard along the top of the tablet; there is a line of perforated holes across every page just below the top edge from which any page may be torn off. Lastly, a pad of sheets each weakly stuck with adhesive to the sheet below, trademarked as &quot;Post-It&quot; or &quot;Stick-Em&quot; and available in various sizes, serve as a sort of tablet.

&quot;Letter pads&quot; are , while the term &quot;legal pad&quot; is often used by laymen to refer to pads of various sizes including those of . Stenographers use &quot;steno pads&quot; of . The steno pad size is also used by Scholastic Corporation as the text block size of their hardcover editions of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novels, with paperback editions using DIN D6.

=== Envelope sizes ===


This implies that all postcards have an aspect ratio in the range from = 1.18 to = 1.71, but the machinable aspect ratio is further restricted to a minimum of 1.30. The only ISO 216 size in the US postcard range is A6. The theoretical maximum aspect ratio for enveloped letters is = 3.29, but is explicitly limited to 2.50.

=== Personal organizer sizes ===
=== Index card sizes ===


=== Photography sizes ===

=== Grain ===

Most industry standards express the direction of the grain last when giving dimensions (that is, 17 × 11 inches is short grain paper and 11 × 17 inches is long grain paper), although alternatively the grain alignment can be explicitly indicated with an underline ( × 17 is a short grain) or the letter &quot;M&quot; for &quot;machine&quot; (11M × 17 is a short grain). Grain is important because the paper will crack if folded across the grain: for example, if a sheet 17 × 11 inches is to be folded to divide the sheet into two 8.5 × 11 halves, then the grain will be along the 11-inch side. Paper intended to be fed into a machine that will bend the paper around rollers, such as a printing press, photocopier or typewriter, should be fed grain edge first so that the axis of the rollers is along the grain.
===Traditional inch-based paper sizes===
Traditionally, a number of different sizes were defined for large sheets of paper, and paper sizes were defined by the sheet name and the number of times it had been folded. Thus a full sheet of &quot;royal&quot; paper was 25 × 20 inches, and &quot;royal octavo&quot; was this size folded three times, so as to make eight sheets, and was thus 10 × inches. Royal sizes were used for posters and billboards.


Imperial sizes were used in the United Kingdom and its territories and some survived in US book printing.

== Traditional British paper sizes ==

Traditional British sizes of cut paper, commonly used as stationery paper, are often referred to by the number of sheets that can be cut from a larger sheet of uncut paper. The standard British imperial uncut paper sizes used in offices and schools were &quot;foolscap&quot;, &quot;post&quot;, and &quot;copy&quot;. Each uncut sheet can then be halved into folios, quartered into quartos, or eighthed into octavos.
A traditional British paper size in the British legal industry is brief (13 × 16): this size was used by solicitors to write their briefs (court‑case instructions) for barristers.

Uncut paper, on the other hand, is referred to by names only, not by the number of sheets that can be cut from a larger sheet of paper.



Boards, mill boards, and cards are also referred to by names only.



The usual British imperial sizes of starw boards are 22‑by‑32 and 25‑by‑30.

== Traditional French paper sizes ==

Before the adoption of the ISO standard system in 1967, France had its own paper size system. Raisin format is still in use today for artistic paper. All are standardized by the AFNOR. Their names come from the watermarks that the papers were branded with when they were handcrafted, which is still the case for certain art papers. They also generally exist in double versions where the smallest measure is multiplied by two, or in quadruple versions where both measures have been doubled.

== Business card sizes ==


The international business card has the size of the smallest rectangle containing a credit card rounded to full millimetres, but in Western Europe, it is rounded to half centimetres (rounded up in Northern Europe), in Eastern Europe to full centimetres, in North America to half inches. However, &quot;credit card size&quot;, as defined in ISO/IEC 7810, also specifies rounded corners and thickness.

== Newspaper sizes ==


Newspapers have a separate set of sizes.

* Compact: AR 1.54
* Berliner: aspect ratio is 1.5
* Rhenish: AR 1.4–1.5
* Tabloid 1.34
* Broadsheet: aspect ratio 1.25

In a recent trend, many newspapers have been undergoing what is known as &quot;web cut down&quot;, in which the publication is redesigned to print using a narrower (and less expensive) roll of paper. In extreme examples, some broadsheet papers are nearly as narrow as traditional tabloids.

<doc id="166115" wikidata="Q752939" url="?curid=166115" title="RMS Queen Mary">
<text>RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; is a retired British ocean liner that operated primarily on the North Atlantic Ocean from 1936 to 1967 for the Cunard Line. It is currently a hotel, museum, and convention space. It is on the National Register of Historic Places and member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Built by John Brown &amp; Company in Clydebank, Scotland, she was subsequently joined by in Cunard&#x27;s two-ship weekly express service between Southampton, Cherbourg and New York. These &quot;Queens&quot; were the British response to the express superliners built by German, Italian, and French companies in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

&quot;Queen Mary&quot; sailed on her maiden voyage on 27 May 1936 and won the Blue Riband that August; she lost the title to in 1937 and recaptured it in 1938, holding it until 1952, when the new claimed it. With the outbreak of World War II, she was converted into a troopship and ferried Allied soldiers during the conflict. On one voyage in 1943, she carried over 16,600 people, still the record for the most people on one vessel at the same time.

Following the war, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; returned to passenger service and, along with &quot;Queen Elizabeth,&quot; commenced the two-ship transatlantic passenger service for which the two ships were initially built. The pair dominated the transatlantic passenger transportation market until the dawn of the jet age in the late 1950s. By the mid-1960s, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was ageing and operating at a loss.

After several years of decreased profits, Cunard officially retired the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; from service in 1967. Bought by the City of Long Beach to function as a restaurant, museum, and hotel, she left Southampton for the last time on 31 October 1967 and sailed to Long Beach, California, United States, where she was permanently moored. After undergoing extensive refurbishment and modifications, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; opened to the public in 1971 and has remained operational since.

==Construction and naming==

With Weimar Germany launching and into service, the United Kingdom and its shipping companies did not want to be left behind in the shipbuilding race. White Star Line, Cunard&#x27;s chief British rival, began construction on the 80,000-ton &quot;Oceanic&quot; in 1928, while Cunard planned a 75,000-ton unnamed ship. Cunard&#x27;s Chief Naval Architect, George Mcleod Paterson, was the principal designer.

Construction on the ship, then known only as &quot;Hull Number 534&quot;, began in December 1930 on the River Clyde by the John Brown &amp; Company shipyard at Clydebank in Scotland. Work halted in December 1931 due to the Great Depression and Cunard applied to the British Government for a loan to complete 534. The Government granted the loan, providing enough money to complete the unfinished ship, and also to build a running mate to provide a two ship weekly service to New York.

One condition of the loan was that Cunard merge its operations with the White Star Line, which was also struggling due to the depression and had canceled construction of its &quot;Oceanic&quot;. Both lines agreed to the merger, and, on 10 May 1934, the companies created a third company, Cunard-White Star Line, to manage their newly combined fleet. Work on 534 resumed immediately with a launch scheduled for 1934. Prior to the ship&#x27;s launch, the River Clyde had to be specifically deepened and widened to cope with her size, undertaken by the engineer D. Alan Stevenson.

On 26 September 1934, Her Majesty Queen Mary launched Hull 534 as RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. Eighteen drag chains slowed the ship down the slipway, which checked the liner&#x27;s progress into the River Clyde. The ship was named after Mary of Teck. Until her launch, the name was a closely guarded secret. Cunard intended to name the ship &quot;Victoria&quot;, in keeping with company tradition of giving its ships names ending in &quot;ia&quot;, but when company representatives asked King George V&#x27;s permission to name the ocean liner after Britain&#x27;s &quot;greatest queen&quot;, he said his wife, Mary, would be delighted. Accordingly, the delegation had no other choice but to report that 534 would be called &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. The name had already been given to the Clyde turbine steamer , so Cunard made an arrangement with its owners and this older ship was renamed &quot;Queen Mary II&quot;.

Following her launch, workers began fitting out the &quot;Queen Mary.&quot; She received 24 Yarrow boilers in four boiler rooms and four Parsons turbines in two engine rooms. The boilers delivered 400 pounds per square inch (28 bar) steam at 700 °F (371 °C), which provided a maximum of to four propellers, each turning at 200 RPM.

Workers completed most of &quot;Queen Mary&#x27;s&quot; work by March 1936 and she left Clydebank for her sea trials. During those trials, she achieved a speed of 32.84 knots. She then prepared for her maiden voyage. The LOA &quot;Queen Mary&quot; measured , making her the world&#x27;s largest passenger ship. Her rival , was LOA, but only measured 79,280 GRT. However, CGT later modified the &quot;Normandie&quot; to increase her size to 83,243 GRT, reclaiming the title of world&#x27;s largest passenger ship. Completion of &quot;Queen Mary&quot; ultimately took years and cost 3.5 million pounds sterling, then equal to $17.5 million (equivalent to $ in ).

==Pre-World War II==

Commanded by Sir Edgar Britten, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; sailed on her maiden voyage from Southampton on 27 May 1936. She sailed at high speed for most of her maiden voyage to New York until heavy fog forced a reduction of speed on the final day of the crossing, arriving in New York Harbor on 1 June 1936.
&quot;Queen Mary&quot; design received criticism for being too traditional, especially when &quot;Normandie&quot; hull was revolutionary with a clipper-shaped, streamlined bow. Except for her cruiser stern, she seemed to be an enlarged version of her Cunard predecessors from the pre-First World War era. Her interior design, while mostly Art Deco, seemed restrained and conservative when compared to the ultramodern French liner. Nonetheless &quot;Queen Mary&quot; proved to be the more popular vessel than her rival, in terms of passengers carried.
In August 1936, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; captured the Blue Riband from &quot;Normandie&quot;, with average speeds of westbound and eastbound. In 1937, &quot;Normandie&quot; received a new set of propellers and reclaimed the Blue Riband. However, in 1938, under the command of Robert B. Irving, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; took back the Blue Riband in both directions, with average speeds of westbound and eastbound, records which stood until lost to in 1952.

===Interior===
Arthur Joseph Davis of Messrs, Mewes and Davis, and Benjamin Wistar Morris designed the &quot;Queen Mary&#x27;s&quot; interior spaces. The Bromsgrove Guild constructed much of the ship&#x27;s interior, while H.H. Martyn &amp; Co. built the staircases, foyers, and entrances. Among the facilities available on board &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, the liner featured two indoor swimming pools, beauty salons, libraries and children&#x27;s nurseries for all three classes, a music studio, a lecture hall, telephone connectivity to anywhere in the world, outdoor paddle tennis courts, and dog kennels. The largest room on board was the cabin class main dining room (grand salon), spanning three stories in height and anchored by wide columns. The ship had many air-conditioned public rooms on board. The cabin-class swimming pool facility spanned over two decks in height. This was the first ocean liner to be equipped with her own Jewish prayer roompart of a policy to show that British shipping lines avoided the antisemitism evident in Nazi Germany.

The cabin class main dining room featured a large map of the transatlantic crossing, with twin tracks symbolising the winter/spring route (further south to avoid icebergs) and the summer/autumn route. During each crossing, a small motorised model of &quot;Queen Mary&quot; would travel along the mural to indicate the vessel&#x27;s progress en route.

As an alternative to the main dining room, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; featured a separate cabin class Verandah Grill on the Sun Deck at the upper aft of the ship. The Verandah Grill was an exclusive &quot;à la carte&quot; restaurant with a capacity of approximately eighty passengers and converted to the Starlight Club at night. Also on board was the Observation Bar, an Art Deco-styled lounge with wide ocean views.

Woods from different regions of the British Empire were used in her public rooms and staterooms. Accommodation ranged from fully equipped, luxurious cabin (first) class staterooms to modest and cramped third-class cabins. Artists commissioned by Cunard in 1933 for works of art in the interior include Edward Wadsworth and A. Duncan Carse,
as well as Algernon Newton RA whose painting &quot;Evening on the Avon&quot; hung opposite Bertram Nicholls&#x27; &quot;Sussex&quot; in the Long Gallery.

==World War II==

In late August 1939, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was on a return run from New York to Southampton. The international situation led to her being escorted by the battlecruiser . She arrived safely and set out again for New York on 1 September. By the time she arrived, war had been declared and she was ordered to remain in port alongside &quot;Normandie&quot; until further notice.
In March 1940, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and &quot;Normandie&quot; were joined in New York by &quot;Queen Mary&quot; new running mate , fresh from her secret voyage from Clydebank. The three largest liners in the world sat idle for some time until the Allied commanders decided that all three ships could be used as troopships. &quot;Normandie&quot; was destroyed by fire during her conversion. &quot;Queen Mary&quot; left New York for Sydney, Australia, in March 1940, where she, along with several other liners, was converted into a troopship to carry Australian and New Zealand soldiers to the United Kingdom.
In the conversion, the ship&#x27;s hull, superstructure, and funnels were painted navy grey. As a result of her new colour, and in combination with her great speed, she became known as the &quot;Grey Ghost&quot;. To protect against magnetic mines, a degaussing coil was fitted around the outside of the hull. Inside, stateroom furniture and decoration were removed and replaced with triple-tiered (fixed) wooden bunks, which were later replaced by &quot;standee&quot; (fold-up) bunks.

A total of of carpet, 220 cases of china, crystal and silver services, tapestries, and paintings were removed and stored in warehouses for the duration of the war. The woodwork in the staterooms, the cabin-class dining room, and other public areas were covered with leather.

&quot;Queen Mary&quot; and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; were the largest and fastest troopships involved in the war, often carrying as many as 15,000 men in a single voyage, and often travelling out of convoy and without escort. The Queens high speed and zigzag courses made it virtually impossible for U-boats to catch them, although one attempted to attack the ship. On 25 May 1944, U-853 spotted &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and submerged to attack, but the ship outran the U-boat before it could do so. Because of their importance to the war effort, Adolf Hitler offered a bounty of 1 million Reichsmarks and Oak Leaves to the Knight&#x27;s Cross, Germany&#x27;s highest military honor, to any U-boat captain that sank either ship.

On 2 October 1942, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; accidentally sank one of her escort ships, slicing through the light cruiser off the Irish coast with a loss of 338 lives. &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was carrying thousands of Americans of the 29th Infantry Division to join the Allied forces in Europe. Due to the risk of U-boat attacks, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was under orders not to stop under any circumstances and steamed onward with a fractured stem. Some sources claim that hours later, the convoy&#x27;s lead escort, consisting of and one other ship, returned to rescue 99 survivors of &quot;Curacoa&quot; crew of 437, including her captain John W. Boutwood. This claim is contradicted by the liner&#x27;s then Staff Captain Harry Grattidge, who recorded that &quot;Queen Mary&quot; Captain, Gordon Illingsworth, immediately ordered the accompanying destroyers to look for survivors within moments of &quot;Curacoa&quot; sinking.

Later that year, from 8–14 December 1942, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; carried 10,389 soldiers and 950 crew (total 11,339). During this trip, on 11 December, while from Scotland during a gale, she was suddenly broadsided on her starboard side by a rogue wave that might have reached a height of . An account of this crossing can be found in Carter&#x27;s book. As quoted in the book, Carter&#x27;s father, Dr. Norval Carter, part of the 110th Station Hospital on board at the time, wrote in a letter that at one point &quot;Queen Mary&quot; &quot;damned near capsized... One moment the top deck was at its usual height and then, swoom! Down, over, and forward she would pitch.&quot; It was calculated later that the ship rolled 52 degrees, and would have capsized had she rolled another three degrees.

From 25 to 30 July 1943, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; carried 15,740 soldiers and 943 crew (total 16,683), a standing record for the most passengers ever transported on one vessel. This was only possible in summer as passengers had to sleep on deck.

During the war, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; carried British Prime Minister Winston Churchill across the Atlantic three times for meetings with fellow Allied forces officials. He was listed on the passenger manifests as &quot;Colonel Warden&quot;. On one crossing in 1943, Churchill and his staff planned the Normandy Invasion and he signed the D-Day Declaration aboard. Churchill later stated that the Queens, &quot;challenged the fury of Hitlerism in the battle of the Atlantic. Without their aid, the day of final victory must unquestionably have been postponed.” By the war&#x27;s end, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; had carried over 800,000 troops and traveled over 600,000 miles across the world&#x27;s oceans.

==After World War II==

After delivering war brides to Canada, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; made her fastest ever crossing, returning in early 1946 to Southampton in only three days, 22 hours and 42 minutes at an average speed of 31.9 knots. From September 1946 to July 1947, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was refitted for passenger service, adding air conditioning and upgrading her berth configuration to 711 first class (formerly called cabin class), 707 cabin class (formerly tourist class) and 577 tourist class (formerly third class) passengers. Following their refit, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; dominated the transatlantic passenger trade as Cunard White Star&#x27;s two-ship weekly express service through the latter half of the 1940s and well into the 1950s. They proved highly profitable for Cunard (as the company was renamed on 31 December 1949).

On 1 January 1949, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; ran aground off Cherbourg, France. She was refloated the next day and returned to service.

In 1952, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; lost the Blue Riband she held for 14 years to the &quot;SS United States&quot; during her maiden voyage.

In 1958, the first commercial transatlantic flights by jet began a completely new era of competition for passenger liners. With a London–New York travel time reduced to just 7–8 hours, demand for multi-day ocean crossing dropped precipitously. On some voyages, winters especially, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; sailed into harbour with more crew than passengers, though both she and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; still averaged over 1,000 passengers per crossing into the middle 1960s. By 1965, the entire Cunard fleet was operating at a loss.

Hoping to continue financing &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;, which was under construction at Brown&#x27;s shipyard, Cunard mortgaged the majority of the fleet. Due to a combination of age, lack of public interest, inefficiency in a new market, and the damaging after-effects of the national seamen&#x27;s strike, Cunard announced that both Queens would be retired from service and sold off. Many offers for &quot;Queen Mary&quot; were submitted, and the bid of $3.45m/£1.2m from Long Beach, California surpassed the Japanese scrap merchants. &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Assault on a Queen&quot; (1966) starring Frank Sinatra. That August, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; made her fastest eastbound passage since August 1938, crossing in 4 days, 10 hours and 6 minutes at an average speed of 29.46 knots (54.56 km/h).

&quot;Queen Mary&quot; was retired from service in 1967. On 27 September 1967, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; completed her 1,001st and last crossing of the North Atlantic, having carried 2,112,000 passengers over . Under the command of Captain John Treasure Jones, who had been her captain since 1965, she sailed from Southampton for the last time on 31 October with 1,093 passengers and 806 crew. After a voyage around Cape Horn, she arrived in Long Beach on 9 December. 
&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was withdrawn in 1968 and &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; took over the transatlantic route in 1969.

==Post-retirement==

&quot;Queen Mary&quot; is permanently moored in Long Beach as a tourist attraction, hotel, museum and event facility.

===Conversion===
&quot;Queen Mary&quot;, bought by Long Beach in 1967, was converted from a seafaring vessel to a floating hotel. The plan included clearing almost every area of the ship below &quot;C&quot; deck (called &quot;R&quot; deck after 1950, to lessen passenger confusion, as the restaurants were located on &quot;R&quot; deck) to make way for Jacques Cousteau&#x27;s new Living Sea Museum. This increased museum space to .

It required the removal of all the boiler rooms, the forward engine room, both turbo generator rooms, the ship stabilisers and the water softening plant. The ship&#x27;s empty fuel tanks were filled with local mud to keep the ship&#x27;s centre of gravity and draft at the correct levels, as these critical factors had been affected by the removal of the various components and structure. Only the aft engine room and &quot;shaft alley&quot;, at the stern of the ship, was spared. The remaining space was used for storage or office space.

One problem that arose during the conversion was a dispute between land-based and maritime unions over conversion jobs. The United States Coast Guard had the final say. &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was deemed a building, since most of her propellers had been removed and her machinery gutted. The ship was also repainted with its red water level paint at a slightly higher level than during her service years. During the conversion, the funnels were removed, as this area was needed to lift out the scrap materials from the engine and boiler rooms. Workers found that the funnels were significantly degraded, and they were replaced with replicas.
With all of the lower decks nearly gutted from R deck and down, Diners Club, the initial lessee of the ship, converted the remainder of the vessel into a hotel. In 1969, it was reported that the hotel would be operated by Sky Chefs, the catering and hospitality division of American Airlines. Diners Club Queen Mary dissolved and vacated the ship in 1970 after their parent company, Diners Club International, was sold, and a change in corporate direction was mandated during the conversion process. Specialty Restaurants, a Los Angeles-based company that focused on theme-based restaurants, took over as master lessee the following year.

This second plan was based on converting most of her first- and second-class cabins on A and B decks into hotel rooms, and converting the main lounges and dining rooms into banquet spaces. On Promenade Deck, the starboard promenade was enclosed to feature an upscale restaurant and café named Lord Nelson&#x27;s and Lady Hamilton&#x27;s; it was themed in the fashion of early-19th century sailing ships. The famed and elegant Observation Bar was redecorated as a western-themed bar.

The smaller first-class public rooms, such as the Drawing Room, Library, Lecture Room and the Music Studio, were stripped of most of their fittings and converted to commercial use. This markedly expanded retail space on the ship. Two more shopping malls were built on the Sun Deck in separate spaces previously used for first-class cabins and engineers&#x27; quarters.

A post-war feature of the ship, the first-class cinema, was removed for kitchen space for the new Promenade Deck dining venues. The first-class lounge and smoking room were reconfigured and converted into banquet space. The second-class smoking room was subdivided into a wedding chapel and office space. On the Sun Deck, the elegant Verandah Grill was gutted and converted into a fast-food eatery, while a new upscale dining venue was created directly above it on Sports Deck, in space once used for crew quarters.

The second-class lounges were expanded to the sides of the ship and used for banqueting. On R deck, the first-class dining room was reconfigured and subdivided into two banquet venues, the Royal Salon and the Windsor Room. The second-class dining room was subdivided into kitchen storage and a crew mess hall, while the third-class dining room was initially used as storage and crew space.

Also on R deck, the first-class Victorian Turkish bath complex, the 1930s equivalent to a spa, was removed. The second-class pool was removed and its space initially used for office space, while the first-class swimming pool was open for viewing by hotel guests and visitors. Because of modern safety codes and the compromised structural soundness of the area directly below, the swimming pool could not be used for swimming after the conversion, although it was filled with water until the late 1980s. Today the pool can only be seen on guided tours and from the first class entrance on R deck. No second-class, third-class or crew cabins remain intact aboard the ship today.

===Opening as a tourist destination===

On 8 May 1971, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; opened her doors to tourists. Initially, only portions of the ship were open to the public as Specialty Restaurants had yet to open its dining venues and PSA had not completed work converting the ship&#x27;s original First Class staterooms into the hotel. As a result, the ship was open only on weekends. On 11 December 1971, Jacques Cousteau&#x27;s Museum of the Sea opened, with a quarter of the planned exhibits completed. Within the decade, Cousteau&#x27;s museum closed due to low ticket sales and the deaths of many of the fish that were housed in the museum. On 2 November 1972, the PSA Hotel Queen Mary opened its initial 150 guest rooms. Two years later, with all 400 rooms finished, PSA brought in Hyatt Hotels to manage the hotel, which operated from 1974 to 1980 as the Queen Mary Hyatt Hotel.

By 1980, it had become apparent that the existing system was not working. The ship was losing millions each year for the city because the hotel, restaurants and museum were run by three separate concessionaires, while the city owned the vessel and operated guided tours. It was decided that a single operator with more experience in attractions was needed.

Jack Wrather, a local millionaire, had fallen in love with the ship because he and his wife, Bonita Granville, had fond memories of sailing on it numerous times. Wrather signed a 66-year lease with the city of Long Beach to operate the entire property. He oversaw the display of the &quot;H-4 Hercules&quot;, nicknamed the &quot;Spruce Goose&quot;, on long-term loan. The immense plane, which had been sitting in a hangar in Long Beach for decades unseen by the public, was installed in a huge geodesic dome adjacent to the liner in 1983, attracting increased attendance.

Wrather Port Properties operated the entire attraction after his death in 1984 until 1988, when his holdings were bought by the Walt Disney Company. Wrather had built the Disneyland Hotel in 1955, when Walt Disney had insufficient funds to construct the hotel himself. Disney had been trying to buy the hotel for 30 years. When they finally succeeded, they also acquired &quot;Queen Mary.&quot; This was never marketed as a Disney property. Through the late 1980s and early 1990s, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; struggled financially. Disney pinned their hopes for turning the attraction around on Port Disney, a huge planned resort on the adjacent docks. It was to include an attraction known as &quot;DisneySea&quot;, a theme park celebrating the world&#x27;s oceans. The plans eventually fell through; in 1992 Disney gave up the lease on the ship to focus on building what would become Disney California Adventure Park. The DisneySea concept was recycled a decade later in Japan as Tokyo DisneySea, with a recreated ocean liner resembling &quot;Queen Mary&quot; named the SS &quot;Columbia&quot; as the centrepiece of the American Waterfront area.

===1992 closure and reopening===
With Disney gone, the Hotel &quot;Queen Mary&quot; closed on 30 September 1992. The owners of the &quot;Spruce Goose&quot;, the Aero Club of Southern California, sold the plane to the Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum in Oregon. The plane departed on barges on 2 October 1992. The &quot;Queen Mary&quot; remained open until 31 December 1992 when it closed.

During this period, the ship was nominated and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Also the Port of Long Beach turned over control over the vessel to the city in 1993.

On 5 February 1993, RMS Foundation, Inc signed a five-year lease with the city of Long Beach to act as the operators of the property. The foundation was run by President and C.E.O. Joseph F. Prevratil, who had managed the attraction for Wrather. On 26 February 1993 the tourist attraction reopened completely, while the hotel reopened partially on 5 March with 125 rooms and the banquet facilities, with the remainder of the rooms coming online on 30 April. In 1995, RMS Foundation&#x27;s lease was extended to twenty years, while the scope of the lease was reduced to operation of the ship. A new company, Queen&#x27;s Seaport Development, Inc. (QSDI), was established in 1995 to control the real estate adjacent to the vessel. The dome was used extensively as a soundstage for film and television by taking advantage of the adaptable interior space that was larger than any sound stage in the Los Angeles area. In 1998, the city of Long Beach extended the QSDI lease to 66 years. Carnival Cruises repurposed a portion of the dome as a passenger terminal in 2001. The California State Lands Commission also issued a report in response to citizens&#x27; concerns about the use of public trust lands and mismanagement of public trust funds. The report determined that the uses were not barred by the granting statutes or the public trust doctrine, but may be considered necessarily incidental to the enjoyment of public tidelands. They found no evidence of mismanagement, a conclusion that was reviewed and affirmed by the State Attorney General.

In 2004, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and Stargazer Productions added Tibbies Great American Cabaret to the space previously occupied by the ship&#x27;s bank and wireless telegraph room. Stargazer Productions and &quot;Queen Mary&quot; transformed the space into a working dinner theatre complete with stage, lights, sound and scullery.
In 2005, QSDI sought Chapter 11 protection due to a rent credit dispute with the city. In 2006, the bankruptcy court requested bids from parties interested in taking over the lease from QSDI. The minimum required opening bid was $41M. The operation of the ship, by RMS Foundation, remained independent of the bankruptcy. In summer 2007, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; lease was sold to a group named &quot;Save the Queen&quot;, managed by Hostmark Hospitality Group.

They planned to develop the land adjacent to &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, and upgrade, renovate and restore the ship. During their management, staterooms were updated with iPod docking stations, flatscreen TVs. The ship&#x27;s three funnels and waterline area were also repainted to their original Cunard red colour. The portside Promenade Deck&#x27;s planking was restored and refinished. Many lifeboats were repaired and patched, and the ship&#x27;s kitchens were renovated with new equipment.

In late September 2009, management of &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was taken over by Delaware North Companies, who planned to continue the restoration and renovation of the ship and its property. They were determined to revitalise and enhance the ship as an attraction. But in April 2011, the city of Long Beach was informed that Delaware North was no longer managing &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. Garrison Investment Group said this decision was purely business. Delaware North continued to manage &quot;Scorpion,&quot; a Soviet submarine that has been a separate attraction next to &quot;Queen Mary&quot; since 1998.
Evolution Hospitality, LLC. assumed operational control of &quot;Queen Mary&quot; on 23 September 2011, with Garrison Investments leasing &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. The dome was used as a venue for the Long Beach Derby Gals roller derby team and as an event venue.

===2006 meeting of the two Queen Marys===
On 23 February 2006, saluted her predecessor as she made a port of call in Los Angeles Harbor, while on a cruise from South Africa to Mexico.

In March 2011, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was saluted by and fireworks, and on 12 March 2013, made a similar fireworks accompanied salute.

The salute was carried out with &quot;Queen Mary&quot; replying with her one working air horn in response to &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot; sounding her combination of two brand new horns and an original 1934 &quot;Queen Mary&quot; horn, which is on loan from the City of Long Beach. &quot;Queen Mary&quot; originally had three whistles tuned to 55 Hz, a frequency chosen because it was low enough that the extremely loud sound of it would not be painful to human ears.

Modern IMO regulations specify ships&#x27; horn frequencies to be in the range 70–200 Hz for vessels that are over in length. Traditionally, the lower the frequency, the larger the ship. &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot;, being long, was given the lowest possible frequency (70 Hz) for her regulation whistles, in addition to the refurbished 55 Hz whistle on permanent loan. 55 Hz is the &quot;A&quot; note an octave above the lowest note of a standard piano keyboard. The air-driven &quot;Tyfon&quot; whistle can be heard at least away.

===2016 lease to Urban Commons===
In 2016, Urban Commons, a real estate company, bought the lease, which extended to 2082, out of default. The lease obligated them to perform the ship&#x27;s daily upkeep and long-term projects. Carnival Cruises took over the entire dome and made efficiency improvements under their management. The operator generated funds through its events, the hotel bookings, and passenger fees from the nearby Carnival cruise terminal, which was the largest source. Taxpayer funds were not being used to maintain the ship under the lease agreement. Urban Commons had plans to extensively renovate the liner and to redevelop the adjacent of parking with a boutique hotel, restaurants, a marina, an amphitheater, jogging trails, bike paths and possibly a huge Ferris wheel, all at a cost of up to $250 million.

In May 2019, Urban Commons formed Eagle Hospitality Real Estate Trust with the goal of generating up to $566 million for the Queen Mary along with its portfolio of 12 other hotel properties that it owns or manages. In December 2019, it was announced that the city was reviewing the finances of Urban Commons to determine whether the City of Long Beach had &quot;received all revenues owed.&quot;

===2017 condition===
In 2017, a report on the ship&#x27;s condition was issued. The report observed that, not only the hull, but also the supports for a raised exhibition area within the ship were corroding and that the ship&#x27;s deteriorating condition left areas such as the engine room vulnerable to flooding. Repair costs were estimated at close to $300 million. In November 2016 the City of Long Beach had put $23 million toward addressing &quot;Queen Mary&quot;″s most vital repairs. John Keisler, economic and property development director for Long Beach, said: &quot;We have a timeline in which the engineers believe they can complete those immediate projects. These are major challenges we can only address over time; it can&#x27;t all be done at once.&quot; Political leaders in Scotland, birthplace of &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, called for the then UK Prime Minister Theresa May to pressure the American government to fund a full repair of the liner in 2017.

In August 2019, Edward Pribonic, the engineer responsible for inspecting &quot;Queen Mary&quot; on behalf of the City of Long Beach, issued a report stating that the ship was in the worst condition he had seen in his 25 years on the job. Pribonic stated that the neglect of &quot;Queen Mary&quot; had grown worse under the management of Urban Commons, and concluded that &quot;without an immediate and very significant infusion of manpower and money, the condition of the ship will likely soon be unsalvageable.&quot; Incidents of recent neglect include the flooding of the Grand Ballroom with sewage after a pipe which was flimsily patched with duct tape burst, significant amounts of standing water in the ship&#x27;s bilge, and recently applied paint on the ship&#x27;s funnels already peeling because of the poor way in which it was applied. The pessimistic conclusion of Pribonic was disputed by city officials, who called the warnings &quot;hyperbolic&quot; and pointed to the &quot;significant&quot; work that has already been undertaken towards repairing &quot;Queen Mary&quot;.

The $23 million apportioned for repairs ran out in 2018, with 19 out of the 27 urgent projects identified by a 2015 marine survey completed as of September 2019. There were significant cost overruns overall, with the cost of fire safety repairs increasing from the original estimate of $200,000 to $5.29 million. Two of the remaining eight issues identified in 2015 were considered &quot;critical&quot; – this includes the removal of the ship&#x27;s lifeboats, which were rotted and in danger of collapsing.

In October 2019, the City of Long Beach warned Urban Commons that the company was failing to uphold its commitment to maintain and repair &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and that it was accordingly in danger of defaulting on its 66-year lease agreement. Urban Commons responded with an updated plan for repairs, including the removal of the lifeboats at a cost of between $5 and $7 million, and new paint work.

===2020 closure and reopening===
The &quot;Queen Mary&quot; ceased operations in May 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As overseer for several corporations that operated the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, Eagle Hospitality Trust filed a motion in federal bankruptcy court on 9 March 2021 to auction off its lease. Court filings by the city claimed that Urban Commons&#x27; repair work was incomplete or not performed correctly and would likely have to be redone. Also, the current condition of the vessel was such that significant safety repairs needed to be performed before it could reopen to the public. In court filings, Eagle Hospitality Trust stated that the lease was their most valuable asset. There were no bidders on the lease after all of Eagle&#x27;s other hotel properties were sold at a bankruptcy court auction. Eagle Hospitality Trust agreed to surrender its lease agreement back to the city, and Long Beach took back control in June 2021. To keep the ship running, the city approved a $2 million, six-month contract with Evolution Hospitality to cover monthly utility fees, security, landscaping and other costs. Simultaneously, the city contracted with Evolution Hospitality, a hotel management company that had been managing the daily operations of the ship since 2011, to act as caretaker.

An architecture and marine engineering firm hired by the city found that $23 million was needed for urgent safety repairs to keep the ship viable over the next two years. The report by Elliott Bay Design Group reported that the vessel was vulnerable to flooding or possibly even capsizing. On 21 September 2021, the Long Beach City Council voted to explore turning the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and surrounding property over to the Harbor Department. Transfer of the ship and the surrounding land from city control to the port would include Pier H. An urgent removal of the deteriorated lifeboats was completed as they were putting stress on the side shell of the ship which has created cracks in the support system. Of the 22 lifeboats then on the ship, 15 were original while the remaining 7 were from other ships. Although the city offered the lifeboats to various groups, none were able to meet the city&#x27;s removal requirements. Consequently, the city saved 11 of the original lifeboats for restoration and scrapped the remaining 11 (4 originals and 7 non-originals).

In June 2022, the city established a new agreement with Evolution Hospitality where company managed the ship for a portion of the revenues while the city controlled repair and restoration of the ship. By November, the city had spent $2.8 million for plumbing repairs, a new Wi-Fi connection, handrail restoration and energy-efficient lightbulbs. This also included beginning work on the ship&#x27;s boilers and heat exchangers. The city approved $1 million to continue repairs to the ship&#x27;s linoleum flooring and carpet, refrigerators, elevators, kitchen exhaust hoods, and guest room locks. After the ship opened for limited tours on 15 December 2022, a public opening was held on 1 April 2023. Later in the month, the city announced that the ship and Pier H would remain with the city with the port being a partner. The repairs, along with increased tourism, led the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; to earn over $3.5 million in operating profits from April – December 2023. In 2024, the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was inducted into the Historic Hotels of America registry for its historical significance.

==Amateur radio room==
&quot;Queen Mary&quot;″s original professionally manned wireless radio room was removed when the ship was moored in Long Beach. In its place, an amateur radio room proposed by Long Beach resident and radio amateur Nate Brightman, K6OSC, was created one deck above the original radio reception room, with some of the discarded original radio equipment used for display purposes. The new Wireless Room was opened for operation on 22 April 1979. The amateur radio station, with the call sign W6RO (&quot;Whiskey Six Romeo Oscar&quot;), relies on volunteers from a local amateur radio club. They staff the radio room during most public hours. The radios can also be used by other licensed amateur radio operators.

In honour of his over forty years of dedication to W6RO and &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, in November 2007 the Queen Mary Wireless Room was renamed as the Nate Brightman Radio Room. This was announced on 28 October 2007, at Brightman&#x27;s 90th birthday party by Joseph Prevratil, former president and CEO of &quot;Queen Mary&quot;.

==Alleged hauntings==

Following &quot;Queen Mary&quot;″s permanent docking in California, claims were made that the ship was haunted. These claims began in earnest in the 1980s (possibly done by employees to increase business or spook guests) and have grown since then. For example, in 2008, &quot;Time&quot; magazine included the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; among its &quot;Top 10 Haunted Places&quot;. One of the staterooms is alleged to be haunted by the spirit of a person supposedly murdered there. Other legends include a young girl who haunts the ship&#x27;s former second class pool and a father who murdered his two daughters on board.

However, there is no historical record to support these claims as no person was murdered aboard the ship. Most deaths aboard the ship were due to natural causes. Further, Center for Inquiry fellow Joe Nickell attributes the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;″s haunting legends to pareidolia, illusory mental images triggered by subjective feelings, and daydreaming commonly experienced by workers doing repetitive chores.

Nevertheless, the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; operates a number of haunted attraction experiences, such as the &quot;Haunted Encounters&quot; and &quot;Grey Ghost Project&quot; tours. These tours, although focused on paranormal activity, counter many of the legends of the ship, with facts drawn from the ship&#x27;s logs, such as records of documented fatalities.

<text>Nobukazu Takemura (竹村延和 &quot;Takemura Nobukazu&quot;; born August 28, 1968, in Hirakata, Osaka) is a Japanese musician and artist. He became interested in music at a young age by listening to the radio, and began to make music at home with a tape recorder and keyboard. During high school, after a record store job that exposed him to jazz and hip-hop, he had regular gigs in the clubs of Osaka and Kyoto as a battle DJ before launching his music career. Takemura&#x27;s music career has seen him cover a wide range of genres and styles within short periods of time. Beginning his career in hip-hop and jazz, Takemura later entered into a prolific period as an electronic musician, exploring genres such as glitch, drum and bass and minimalism. Takemura&#x27;s most recent work has included chamber music and performance art.

==Career==
In 1990, Takemura founded the instrumental hip hop group Audio Sports with Yamatsuka Eye (of The Boredoms) and Aki Onda. Their first album, &quot;Era of Glittering Gas&quot;, was released in 1992 (after which Onda subsequently took control of the project).

In 1992, Takemura formed the nu-jazz collective Spiritual Vibes, which released several albums and a few singles throughout the early to mid-1990s. During this period Takemura would occasionally toy with (and eventually pursue full-time in the late 1990s) his own solo releases, typically under the names of DJ Takemura or Kool Jazz Productions. He has released music under the pseudonyms of DJ Takemura, Child&#x27;s View and Assembler, and his music has covered a wide variety of genres in a short amount of time, ranging from hip-hop instrumentals, to jazz, to chamber music and electronic minimalism, breakbeat, noise pop, glitch and jungle music. The vast majority of Takemura&#x27;s music has been recorded in his home-made &quot;Moonlit Studio&quot;, in his Kyoto apartment. 
He founded the Lollop and Childisc labels in the 1990s after meeting musicians who were unable to release their music due to not having a record label. His voluminous releases, remixes, and collaborations make a comprehensive discography difficult, and his music often defies any easy categorization. Takemura&#x27;s first U.S. release was &quot;Funfair&quot; on the Bubble Core label in 1998, a slightly altered release of the &quot;Yoru No Yuenchi&quot; album released previously in Japan. This was followed by &quot;Scope&quot; on the Thrill Jockey label in 1999, an album that was released solely in the U.S. He has frequently collaborated with fellow Childisc vocalist/composer Aki Tsuyuko, with her vocals having been sampled on many of his albums.

His unique and complex approach to melody and instrumentation has generated a catalog of collaborations with critically acclaimed artists including Issey Miyake, Zu, Steve Reich, DJ Spooky, Yo La Tengo, Tortoise, and Tujiko Noriko. Takemura performed live extensively in the early 2000s, having toured the U.S. opening for Tortoise and Plaid, as well as touring the U.K. with a full live band playing his music on a sponsorship from the British Arts Council.
Takemura was also responsible for the sound design of Sony&#x27;s robotic dog AIBO.

Takemura moved from his long-term home of Kyoto to Berlin, Germany in 2008. In February 2014, Takemura released &quot;Zeitraum&quot;, a compilation of music, sounds and images he had created from 2004 – 2013 for various projects, commissions and collaborations. Zeitraum is Takemura&#x27;s first solo album release in 11 years.

==Discography==
&quot;Note: This discography only includes solo and collaboration releases under the names of &quot;Nobukazu Takemura&quot;, &quot;Child&#x27;s View&quot;, &quot;Assembler&quot; or &quot;DJ Takemura&quot;. None of Takemura&#x27;s group releases, such as with Audio Sports or Spiritual Vibes, are included.&quot;

<doc id="166121" wikidata="Q212145" url="?curid=166121" title="The World Is Not Enough">
<text>The World Is Not Enough is a 1999 spy film, the nineteenth in the &quot;James Bond&quot; series produced by Eon Productions and the third to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. It was directed by Michael Apted, from an original story and screenplay by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Bruce Feirstein. It was produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. The title is the translation of the motto on the Bond family coat of arms, first seen in &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;.

The film&#x27;s plot revolves around the murder of billionaire businessman Sir Robert King by the terrorist Renard, and Bond&#x27;s subsequent assignment to protect King&#x27;s daughter Elektra, who was previously held for ransom by Renard. During his assignment, Bond unravels a scheme to increase petroleum prices by triggering a nuclear meltdown in the waters of Istanbul.

Filming locations included Spain, France, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and the UK, with interiors shot at Pinewood Studios. Despite receiving mixed reviews, with the plot and Denise Richards&#x27; casting frequently targeted for criticism, &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; earned over $361 million worldwide, becoming the eighth highest grossing film of 1999. It was also the first Eon-produced &quot;Bond&quot; film officially released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures (MGM) instead of MGM subsidiary United Artists, the franchise&#x27;s original owner and distributor.

==Plot==

In Bilbao, MI6 agent James Bond meets Swiss banker Lachaise to retrieve money for Sir Robert King, a British oil tycoon and friend of M. Bond interrogates the banker to identify the assassin of an MI6 agent, but Lachaise is killed before revealing this information, and Bond is forced to escape with the money. At MI6 headquarters in London, the money is revealed to be laced with explosives that kill King. Bond chases the assassin by boat on the Thames to the Millennium Dome, where she attempts to escape via hot air balloon. Bond offers her protection; she refuses and blows up the balloon at the cost of her life. 

Bond traces the recovered money to Renard, a KGB agent turned terrorist. Following an earlier attempt on his life by MI6, Renard was left with a bullet embedded in his brain, which makes him immune to pain but will eventually kill him. M assigns Bond to protect King&#x27;s daughter Elektra, whom Renard had previously abducted and held for ransom. Bond flies to Azerbaijan, where Elektra oversees the construction of an oil pipeline. During a tour of the pipeline&#x27;s proposed route in the mountains, Bond and Elektra are attacked by a hit squad in snowmobiles.

Bond visits Valentin Zukovsky at a casino to acquire information about Elektra&#x27;s attackers. There, Bond grows suspicious as Elektra immediately loses $1 million on a game of high card draw, and discovers that her head of security, Sasha Davidov, is secretly in league with Renard. Bond kills Davidov and boards a plane bound for a ex-Soviet ICBM base in Kazakhstan. Posing as a Russian scientist Bond meets American nuclear physicist Dr. Christmas Jones cooperating with Russian armed forces in overseeing the dismantling of the site. Renard removes the GPS locator card and weapons-grade plutonium core from a nuclear warhead. Before Bond can kill him, Jones exposes his cover. Renard steals the bomb and flees, leaving everyone to die. Bond and Jones escape the exploding silo with the locator card.

In Azerbaijan, Bond warns M that Elektra may not be as innocent as she appears, and may have succumbed to Stockholm Syndrome under Renard&#x27;s capture. He hands her the locator card as proof of the theft. An alarm sounds, revealing that the stolen bomb is attached to a pipeline inspection pig heading towards the oil terminal. Bond and Jones enter the pipeline to deactivate the bomb, and Jones discovers that half of the plutonium is missing. They jump clear of the rig and a section of pipe is destroyed. Bond and Jones are presumed killed. Back at the command centre, Elektra reveals that she killed her father as revenge for using her as bait for Renard. She abducts M, whom she resents for having advised her father not to pay the ransom money.

Bond accosts Zukovsky at his caviar factory in the Caspian Sea and they are attacked by Elektra&#x27;s helicopters. Zukovsky reveals his arrangement with Elektra was to accept a payoff via bets in his casino in exchange for the use of a old nuclear Soviet-era submarine captained by Zukovsky&#x27;s nephew in the Black Sea Fleet. The group goes to Istanbul, where Jones realizes that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the submarine&#x27;s nuclear reactor, the resulting meltdown would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the main alternative oil pipelines passing through the Bosphorus. Elektra&#x27;s pipeline, planned to go around Istanbul, would increase in value. Bond gets a signal from the locator card at the Maiden&#x27;s Tower before Zukovsky&#x27;s henchman Bull blows up the command centre. Zukovsky is knocked unconscious, and Bond and Jones are captured by Elektra&#x27;s henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine, which was seized by Renard&#x27;s men. Bond is taken to the tower, where Elektra tortures him with a garrote and reveals that she cut off part of her ear to make her kidnapping look more believable. Zukovsky and his men seize the tower, but Zukovsky is shot by Elektra. Before dying, Zukovsky uses his cane gun to free Bond, who frees M and kills Elektra.

Bond dives after the submarine, boards it and frees Jones. The submarine&#x27;s hull ruptures as it sinks into the Bosphorus. Bond fights Renard and impales him by firing the plutonium rod into his chest. Bond and Jones escape from the submarine, leaving the flooded reactor to detonate underwater. Later, they celebrate the New Year and have sex in Istanbul, while being monitored by MI6 satellites. M is appalled at Bond&#x27;s conduct with Christmas, but &quot;R&quot;, the successor to Q, Bond&#x27;s quartermaster, dismisses their sexual activity as a glitch on the satellite screen.

==Cast==
* Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, MI6 agent, codename 007.
* Sophie Marceau as Elektra King, an oil heiress who is seemingly being targeted by Renard, the world&#x27;s most wanted terrorist. M gives Bond the task of protecting her at all costs, although he suspects that there is more to her than meets the eye. Sharon Stone and Vera Farmiga were also considered for the role before Broccoli saw Marceau&#x27;s performance in &quot;Firelight&quot;.
* Robert Carlyle as Victor &quot;Renard&quot; Zokas, a former KGB agent turned high-tech terrorist who previously kidnapped Elektra. After a failed assassination attempt he has a bullet lodged in his brain, rendering him impervious to pain as well as slowly killing off his other senses, and ultimately killing him as well. Before the casting of Carlyle the role was offered to Javier Bardem (who would later portray the Bond villain in &quot;Skyfall&quot;) and Jean Reno.
* Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones, an American nuclear physicist assisting Bond in his mission. Richards stated that she liked the role because it was &quot;brainy&quot;, &quot;athletic&quot;, and had &quot;depth of character, in contrast to Bond girls from previous decades&quot;. Richards stated that a lot of viewers &quot;made fun of&quot; the character&#x27;s attire but that &quot;these Bond girls are so outrageous and if I did really look like a scientist, the Bond fans would have been disappointed.&quot; Jones was originally written as a French-Polynesian insurance investigator before but the studio insisted on changing her nationality after the casting of Marceau. Tiffani Thiessen also auditioned.
* Robbie Coltrane as Valentin Zukovsky: A former Russian mafia boss and Baku casino owner. Bond initially seeks out Zukovsky for intel on Renard and is subsequently aided by him when Zukovsky&#x27;s nephew falls into Renard&#x27;s captivity. Coltrane reprises his role from &quot;GoldenEye&quot;.
* Desmond Llewelyn as Q: MI6&#x27;s &quot;quartermaster&quot; who supplies Bond with multi-purpose vehicles and gadgets useful for the latter&#x27;s mission. The film would be Llewelyn&#x27;s final performance as Q. Although the actor was not officially retiring from the role, the Q character was training his eventual replacement in this film. Llewelyn was killed in a car crash shortly after the film premiered.
* Maria Grazia Cucinotta as &quot;Cigar Girl&quot;: An experienced assassin working for Renard, who appears as an assistant who supplies Bond and the banker with cigars during their meeting in Bilbao and who tries to assassinate Bond in London. In the novelisation, the character is given the name Giulietta da Vinci.
* Samantha Bond as Miss Moneypenny: M&#x27;s secretary.
* Michael Kitchen as Bill Tanner: M&#x27;s Chief of Staff.
* Colin Salmon as Charles Robinson: M&#x27;s Deputy Chief of Staff.
* Serena Scott Thomas as Dr. Molly Warmflash, an MI6 agent and doctor assigned to examine Bond, as well as describing Renard&#x27;s seeming invincibility due to the terminal bullet in his brain that will kill him when it reaches the center of his brain.
* Ulrich Thomsen as Sasha Davidov: Elektra King&#x27;s head of security in Azerbaijan and Renard&#x27;s secret liaison.
* Goldie as Bull: Valentin Zukovsky&#x27;s gold-toothed and gold-haired bodyguard, secretly working for Elektra and Renard. Although listed as &#x27;Bull&#x27; in the credits, Zukovsky also refers to him as &#x27;Mr. Bullion&#x27; in the film.
* John Seru as Gabor: Elektra King&#x27;s bodyguard who is seen accompanying King wherever she travels.
* Claude-Oliver Rudolph as Colonel Akakievich: The leader of the Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan.
* Judi Dench as M: The head of MI6.
* Patrick Malahide portrays Lachaise, the Swiss banker killed early on in the film.
* Gary Powell as Submarine Crewman (uncredited)

* John Cleese as R: Q&#x27;s assistant and appointed successor. Bond humorously refers to him as &quot;R&quot;: &quot;If you&#x27;re Q, does that make him R?&quot;
==Production==
===Development===

In November 1997, a month prior to the release of &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, Barbara Broccoli watched a news report on &quot;Nightline&quot; detailing how the world&#x27;s major oil companies were vying for control of the untapped oil reserves in the Caspian Sea in the wake of the Soviet Union&#x27;s collapse, and suggested that controlling the only pipeline from the Caspian to the West would be an appropriate motivation for a potential Bond villain. She and Michael G. Wilson hired screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade to work on the film following their work on &quot;Plunkett &amp; Macleane&quot;; Purvis and Wade would eventually write or co-write all of the following Bond films up to &quot;No Time to Die&quot;. The screenwriters incorporated material from the abandoned Bond screenplay &quot;Reunion with Death&quot;, which had been conceived in 1993 with Timothy Dalton as Bond. Broccoli was especially impressed by the writers&#x27; suggestion of a female main villain, stating that &quot;With Elektra, Bond thinks he has found Tracy, but he&#x27;s really found Blofeld&quot;.

Joe Dante, and later Peter Jackson, were initially offered the opportunity to direct the film. Barbara Broccoli enjoyed Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot;, and a screening of &quot;The Frighteners&quot; was arranged for her. She disliked the latter film, however, and showed no further interest in Jackson. Jackson, a lifelong Bond fan, remarked that as Eon tended to go for less famous directors, he would likely not get another chance to direct a Bond film after &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Barbara Broccoli also was in talks with Alfonso Cuarón to direct, who nearly accepted. Hoping to find a director capable of eliciting strong performances from women, the producers eventually hired Michael Apted, as his work with Sissy Spacek in &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, Sigourney Weaver in &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot; and Jodie Foster in &quot;Nell&quot; has earned all three actresses Oscar nominations (with Spacek winning). Apted&#x27;s then-wife Dana Stevens did an uncredited rewrite, primarily to strengthen the female characters&#x27; roles, before Bruce Feirstein, who had worked in the previous two films, was hired to work on Bond&#x27;s role.

Initially the film was to be released in 2000, rumoured to be titled &quot;Bond 2000&quot;. Other rumoured titles included &quot;Death Waits for No Man&quot;, &quot;Fire and Ice&quot;, &quot;Pressure Point&quot; and &quot;Dangerously Yours&quot;. The eventual title &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; is an English translation of the Latin phrase &quot;Orbis non sufficit&quot;, the motto of Bond&#x27;s supposed real-world ancestor Sir Thomas Bond. In the novel &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; and its film adaptation, it is first claimed to be James Bond&#x27;s family motto as well.

The phrase &quot;Orbis non sufficit&quot; is thought to originate from the &quot;Pharsalia&quot; by Lucan. It appears twice, both with uncomplimentary associations: the first reference is to a group of villainous mutineers, and the second is to the ambitious Julius Caesar. It was then applied to Alexander the Great by Juvenal in his collection of satirical poems, the Satires: &quot;The world was not big enough for Alexander the Great, but a coffin was&quot;. Phrased as &quot;Non sufficit orbis&quot;, it became the motto of the Spanish king Philip II after ascending the Portuguese throne in 1580.

Crime novelist Donald E. Westlake wrote an early draft of the film, which was later scrapped because of difficulties in filming in the script&#x27;s original setting in China. Westlake adapted the script into the novel &quot;Forever and a Death&quot;, which was published posthumously in 2017 by Hard Case Crime.

===Filming===

The pre-title sequence begins in Bilbao, Spain, featuring the Guggenheim Museum. After the opening scene, the film moves to London, showcasing the SIS Building and the Millennium Dome on the Thames. The sequence lasts for about 14 minutes, making it the longest pre-title sequence in the series until &quot;No Time to Die&quot; in 2021. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; claimed that the British Government prevented some filming in front of the actual MI6 Headquarters at Vauxhall Cross, citing a security risk. However, a Foreign Office spokesperson rejected the claims and expressed displeasure with the article. Following the title sequence, Eilean Donan Castle in Scotland is used by MI6 as a location headquarters. Other locations include Baku, Azerbaijan, the Azerbaijan Oil Rocks and Istanbul, Turkey, where Maiden&#x27;s Tower and Küçüksu Palace are shown.

Principal photography began on 17 January 1999, and lasted until June of that year. The studio work for the film was shot as usual in Pinewood Studios, including Albert R. Broccoli&#x27;s 007 Stage. Bilbao, Spain was used briefly for the exterior of the Swiss bank and flyover-bridge adjacent to the Guggenheim Museum. In London outdoor footage was shot of the SIS Building and Vauxhall Cross with several weeks filming the boat chase on the River Thames eastwards towards the Millennium Dome, Greenwich. The canal footage of the chase where Bond soaks the parking wardens was filmed at Wapping and the boat stunts in Millwall Dock and under Glengall Bridge were filmed at the Isle of Dogs. Chatham Dockyard was also used for part of the boat chase. Stowe School, Buckinghamshire, was used as the site of the King family estate on the banks of Loch Lomond. Filming continued in Scotland at Eilean Donan Castle which was used to depict the exterior of MI6 temporary operations centre &quot;Castle Thane&quot;. The skiing chase sequence in the Caucasus was shot on the slopes of Chamonix, France. Filming of the scene was delayed by an avalanche; the crew helped in the rescue operation.

The interior (and single exterior shot) of L&#x27;Or Noir casino in Baku, Azerbaijan, was shot at Halton House, the officers&#x27; mess of RAF Halton. RAF Northolt was used to depict the airfield runway in Azerbaijan.
Zukovsky&#x27;s quayside caviar factory was shot entirely at the outdoor water tank at Pinewood. The exterior of Kazakhstan nuclear facility was shot at the Bardenas Reales, in Navarre, Spain, and the exterior of the oil refinery control centre at the Motorola building in Groundwell, Swindon. The exterior of the oil pipeline was filmed in Cwm Dyli, Snowdonia, Wales, while the production teams shot the oil pipeline explosion on Hankley Common, Elstead, Surrey. Istanbul, Turkey, was used in the film, also using the famous Maiden&#x27;s Tower which was used as Renard&#x27;s hideout in Turkey. Exteriors for Elektra King&#x27;s Baku villa were shot at Küçüksu Pavilion in Istanbul, and interiors were shot at Luton Hoo in Bedfordshire, England. The underwater submarine scenes were filmed in the Bahamas.

The BMW Z8 driven by Bond in the film was the final part of a three-film product placement deal with BMW (which began with the Z3 in &quot;GoldenEye&quot; and continued with the 750iL in &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;) but, due to filming preceding release of the Z8 by a few months, several working mock-ups and models were manufactured for filming purposes.

===Music===
The soundtrack to &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; is the second &quot;Bond&quot; soundtrack to be composed by David Arnold. Arnold broke tradition by not ending the film with a reprise of the opening theme or, as with the previous three films, a new song. Originally, Arnold intended to use the song &quot;Only Myself to Blame&quot; at the end of the film; however, Apted discarded this and the song was replaced by a remix of the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot;. &quot;Only Myself to Blame&quot;, written by Arnold and Don Black and sung by Scott Walker, is the 19th and final track on the album and its melody is Elektra King&#x27;s theme. The theme is heard in &quot;Casino&quot;, &quot;Elektra&#x27;s Theme&quot; and &quot;I Never Miss&quot;. Arnold added two new themes to the final score, both of which are reused in the following film, &quot;Die Another Day&quot;.

The title song, &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, was written by David Arnold with Don Black and performed by Garbage. It is the fifth &quot;Bond&quot; theme co-written by Black, preceded by &quot;Thunderball&quot;, &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;, &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, and &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;. IGN chose &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; as the ninth-best James Bond theme of all time. In 2012 Grantland ranked the song as the second-best Bond song of all-time, behind only &quot;Goldfinger.&quot; The song also appeared in two &quot;best of 1999&quot; polls: #87 in 89X&#x27;s &quot;Top 89 Songs of 1999&quot; and No. 100 in Q101&#x27;s &quot;Top 101 of 1999&quot;.

Another theme song was made by English post-Britpop band Straw, which was also entitled &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; but was rejected in favor of Garbage&#x27;s song. The song is unique as the lyrics contains references to several of the Ian Fleming novels, including references to &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, and &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;.

==Release and reception==
&quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; premiered on 19 November 1999 in the United States and on 26 November 1999 in the United Kingdom. Its world premiere was 8 November 1999 at the Fox Bruin Theater, Los Angeles, USA. At that time MGM signed a marketing partnership with MTV, primarily for American youths, who were assumed to have considered Bond as &quot;an old-fashioned secret service agent&quot;. As a result, MTV broadcast more than 100 hours of Bond-related programmes immediately after the film was released, most being presented by Denise Richards.

===Box office===
The film opened at the top of the North American box office with $35.5 million earned during its opening weekend. It remained in that spot until it was handed to &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; during its second weekend. Its final worldwide gross was $361.7 million worldwide, with $126 million in the United States alone. It became the highest grossing James Bond film of all time until the release of &quot;Die Another Day&quot;. The film was also selected for the first round of nominations for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and it was failing to get nominated. The film was nominated for a Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film Saturn Award, Pierce Brosnan won both the Empire Award and the Blockbuster Entertainment Award as Best Actor, and David Arnold won a BMI Film Music Award for his score. The film became the first in the Bond series to win a Golden Raspberry when Denise Richards was chosen as &quot;Worst Supporting Actress&quot; at the 1999 Razzie Awards. Richards and Brosnan were also nominated for &quot;Worst Screen Couple&quot; (lost to Will Smith and Kevin Kline for &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;).
The initial release of the DVD includes the featurette &quot;Secrets of 007&quot;, which cuts into &quot;making of&quot; material during the film; the documentary &quot;The Making of The World Is Not Enough&quot;; two commentary tracks—one by director Michael Apted, and the other by production designer Peter Lamont, second unit director Vic Armstrong, and composer David Arnold; a trailer for the PlayStation video game, and the Garbage music video. The Ultimate Edition released in 2006 had as additional extras a 2000 documentary named &quot;Bond Cocktail&quot;, a featurette on shooting the Q Boat scenes, Pierce Brosnan in a press conference in Hong Kong, deleted scenes, and a tribute to Desmond Llewelyn.

===Critical reception===

Reception was mixed. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 51% based on 147 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10, the lowest of the Brosnan Bond films. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Plagued by mediocre writing, uneven acting, and a fairly by-the-numbers plot, &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; is partially saved by some entertaining and truly Bond-worthy action sequences.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100 based on 38 critics, indicating &quot;mixed and average reviews&quot;.

&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert said the film was a &quot;splendid comic thriller, exciting and graceful, endlessly inventive&quot;, and gave it three-and-a-half stars out of four. On the other hand, Eleanor Ringel Gillespie of &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; disliked the film, calling it &quot;dated and confused&quot;. Nathan Rabin from &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; opined that &quot;enough fun moments are scattered throughout to make it a decent Bond entry. But the series still needs a massive shot of fresh ideas if it wishes to become anything more than a nostalgia-fueled commercial sure thing&quot;. Antonia Quirke from &quot;The Independent&quot; said that the film &quot;is certainly less definitively feeble than other recent Bond offerings, with an at least two-dimensional female character in the bold and oval Marceau. But my reaction is much the same as to a new Rolling Stones album: I&#x27;m just grateful that it&#x27;s not embarrassing&quot;. Negative criticism was focused on the execution of the plot, and the action scenes were considered excessive.

Richards was widely criticized for not being credible in the role of a nuclear scientist, with &quot;Variety&quot; calling her &quot;the least plausible nuclear physicist in the history of movies, who makes even the electrochemist Elisabeth Shue played in 1997&#x27;s &quot;The Saint&quot; sound like a Nobel laureate&quot;; Nathan Rabin panned her performance and called it &quot;so laughably awful that the film comes to a dead stop whenever she&#x27;s on screen&quot;. She was ranked as one of the worst Bond girls of all time by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 2008.

In contrast, Sophie Marceau was praised for her role as Elektra, with most critics agreeing that she was a better Bond Girl than Denise Richards&#x27; Christmas Jones and a better Bond villain than Robert Carlyle&#x27;s Renard. Peter Bradshaw from &quot;The Guardian&quot; called her &quot;terrific: sexy, stylish, with a really beautiful face entirely innocent of the cosmetic surgeon&#x27;s art&quot;.

==== Retrospective ====
Pete Debruge of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote in 2012 that &quot;[&quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;] presents a conflicted persona torn between the corny antics of the Roger Moore era and the grim seriousness of where things would eventually go under Daniel Craig’s tenure. It also contains a dose of Timothy Dalton-esque toughness [...] Much of what made Brosnan such a great Bond is thrust into the backseat by lame jokes and a premature attempt to mix up the formula&quot;, concluding that it was &quot;nothing but a reversion to the franchise&#x27;s most adolescent tendencies&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; picked it as the worst Bond film of all time in 2006, saying it had a plot &quot;so convoluted even Pierce Brosnan has admitted to being mystified&quot;. Norman Wilner of MSN chose it as the third-worst film, above &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; and &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;, while IGN chose it as the fifth-worst, both in 2007.

==Adaptations==
Bond novelist Raymond Benson wrote his adaptation of &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; from the film&#x27;s screenplay. It was Benson&#x27;s fourth &quot;Bond&quot; novel and followed the story closely, but with some details changed. For instance, Elektra sings quietly before her death and Bond still carries his Walther PPK instead of the newer P99. The novel also gave the cigar girl/assassin the name Giulietta da Vinci and retained a scene between her and Renard that was cut from the film.

In 2000, the film was adapted by Electronic Arts to create two first-person shooters of the same name for the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation. The Nintendo 64 version was developed by Eurocom and the PlayStation version was developed by Black Ops. Versions of &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; for the PC and the PlayStation 2 were planned for release in 2000, but both were cancelled. These versions would have used the id Tech 3 game engine from &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;. Although this game marks Pierce Brosnan&#x27;s fifth appearance in a &quot;Bond&quot; video game, the game includes only his likeness; the character is voiced by Adam Blackwood.

<doc id="166123" wikidata="Q313727" url="?curid=166123" title="Robert Shaw (actor)">
<text>Robert Archibald Shaw (9 August 1927 – 28 August 1978) was an English actor and writer. Beginning his career in theatre, Shaw joined the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre after the Second World War and appeared in productions of &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, and other Shakespeare plays. With the Old Vic company (1951–52), he continued primarily in Shakespearean roles. In 1959 he starred in a West End production of &quot;The Long and the Short and the Tall&quot;.

Shaw was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for his role as Henry VIII in the drama film &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1966). His other film roles included the mobster Doyle Lonnegan in &quot;The Sting&quot; (1973) and the shark hunter Quint in &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975). He also played roles in &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (1963), &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; (1969), &quot;Young Winston&quot; (1972), &quot;The Taking of Pelham One Two Three&quot; (1974), &quot;Robin and Marian&quot; (1976), and &quot;Black Sunday&quot; and &quot;The Deep&quot;, both of which were released in 1977.

==Early life==
Robert Archibald Shaw was born on 9 August 1927 at 51 King Street in Westhoughton, Lancashire, the son of Thomas Archibald Shaw and Doreen Nora, née Avery. His father, a doctor and former Royal Field Artillery Lieutenant, was of Scottish descent; his mother, a former nurse, was born at Piggs Peak, Swaziland. He had three sisters named Elisabeth, Joanna, and Wendy, and one brother named Alexander. When he was seven years old, the family moved to Scotland, settling in Stromness, Orkney. His father killed himself when Shaw was 12, and the family then relocated to Cornwall, where Shaw attended the independent Truro School. For a brief period, he was a teacher at Glenhow Preparatory School in Saltburn-by-the-Sea in the North Riding of Yorkshire, before attending the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, graduating in 1948. 

==Career==
===Early career===

Shaw began his acting career in theatre, appearing in regional theatre throughout England. He played Angus in a production of &quot;Macbeth&quot; at Stratford in 1946. He played at Stratford for two seasons.

In 1947, he appeared in &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; on British TV; also for that medium, he performed scenes from &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

He had a small part in &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; (1951), playing a police laboratory technician towards the end of the film; the following year he made his London debut, in the West End, at the Embassy Theatre in &quot;Caro William&quot;. That year he appeared on TV in &quot;A Time to Be Born&quot; (1952). He returned to Stratford in 1953.

Shaw had small roles in &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; (1955), a TV version of &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; (1956), the films &quot;Doublecross&quot; (1956) and &quot;A Hill in Korea&quot; (1956) (alongside other young actors like Michael Caine), and a TV version of &quot;Hindle Wakes&quot; (1957).

===&quot;The Buccaneers&quot;===
Shaw became a TV star in the UK when he starred as Captain Dan Tempest in &quot;The Buccaneers&quot; (1956–57) which ran for 39 episodes.

He was by this time a TV leading man, having lead roles in TV films such as &quot;Success&quot; (1957) and a TV version of &quot;Rupert of Hentzau&quot; (1957). He had a big stage success with &quot;The Long and the Short and the Tall&quot; on the West End in 1959, directed by Lindsay Anderson, a performance that was filmed for television (though Shaw did not appear in the feature film version).

Shaw had small roles in &quot;Sea Fury&quot; (1958) and &quot;Libel&quot; (1959) and guest-starred on &quot;William Tell&quot;, &quot;ITV Television Playhouse&quot;, &quot;The Four Just Men&quot;, and &quot;Danger Man&quot;. He also appeared in TV plays including &quot;The Dark Man&quot;, &quot;Misfire&quot; and &quot;The Train Set&quot;.

In 1961, he appeared in a Broadway production of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Caretaker&quot; alongside Donald Pleasence and Alan Bates. Shaw replaced Peter Woodthorpe, who had performed with the others on stage in London. It ran for 165 performances. He had good roles in &quot;The Valiant&quot;, a war film, and &quot;Tomorrow at Ten&quot; (both 1962), a thriller. Shaw played the leads in TV versions of &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;The Father&quot; (both 1962). He, Pleasence, and Bates reprised their performances in a film version of &quot;The Caretaker&quot; (1963); Shaw was part of the consortium who helped finance the latter.

===Writing===
Shaw&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Hiding Place&quot;, published in 1960, received positive reviews. His second novel &quot;The Sun Doctor&quot; (1961), was awarded the Hawthornden Prize in 1962.

===Film fame===
Shaw became well known as a film actor when cast as assassin Donald &quot;Red&quot; Grant in the second James Bond film, &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (1963). For TV he adapted and appeared in a production of &quot;A Florentine Tragedy&quot; (1963), and was Claudius in &quot;Hamlet at Elsinore&quot; (1964) with Christopher Plummer. He played the title role in &quot;The Luck of Ginger Coffey&quot; (1964), shot in Canada alongside Mary Ure, who became his second wife. He had a role in &quot;A Carol for Another Christmas&quot; (1964). Shaw later said of his early career, &quot;I could have been a straight leading man but that struck me as a boring life.&quot;

In 1964, Shaw returned to Broadway in a production of &quot;The Physicists&quot; directed by Peter Brook but it ran for only 55 performances. &quot;I want very much to avoid doing bad commercial pictures for lots of money&quot;, he said. &quot;It&#x27;s difficult to avoid with six kids and two wives.&quot; Shaw then embarked on a trilogy of novels – &quot;The Flag&quot; (1965), &quot;The Man in the Glass Booth&quot; (1967) and &quot;A Card from Morocco&quot; (1969). He also adapted &quot;The Hiding Place&quot; into a screenplay for the film &quot;Situation Hopeless... But Not Serious&quot; starring Sir Alec Guinness.

Shaw was the relentless Wehrmacht panzer commander Colonel Hessler in &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot; (1965), produced by Philip Yordan; a young Henry VIII in &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1966), which earned him a nomination for the Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor; General George Armstrong Custer in &quot;Custer of the West&quot; (1967), again for Yordan; Martin Luther in &quot;Luther&quot; (a 1968 film made for television); he was top billed in another film version of Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Birthday Party&quot; (1968), directed by William Friedkin.

===&quot;The Man in the Glass Booth&quot;===
His play &quot;The Man in the Glass Booth&quot; was a success in London in 1967. It transferred to Broadway the following year and was a hit, running for 264 performances. His adaptation for the stage of &quot;The Man in the Glass Booth&quot; gained him the most attention for his writing. The book and play present a complex and morally ambiguous tale of a man who, at various times in the story, is either a Jewish businessman pretending to be a Nazi war criminal, or a Nazi war criminal pretending to be a Jewish businessman. The play was quite controversial when performed in the UK and the US, some critics praising Shaw&#x27;s &quot;sly, deft and complex examination of the moral issues of nationality and identity&quot;, others sharply critical of Shaw&#x27;s treatment of such a sensitive subject. The play, but not the movie, presents the question: &quot;Given the chance, would Jews behave like Nazis?&quot;

Shaw was one of many stars in &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; (1969), with the role of Sailor Malan written specifically for him. He had the lead in &quot;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot; (1969) where he played Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro, alongside Christopher Plummer who played Incan Emperor Atahualpa, and &quot;Figures in a Landscape&quot; (1970); his fee for the latter was reportedly $500,000. In 1970, Shaw returned to Broadway playing the title role in &quot;Gantry&quot;, a musical adaptation of &quot;Elmer Gantry,&quot; which ran for just one performance, despite co-starring Rita Moreno. His play &quot;Cato Street&quot;, about the 1820 Cato Street Conspiracy, was produced for the first time in 1971 in London. He appeared in &quot;Old Times&quot; on Broadway in 1971.

As an actor he appeared in &quot;A Town Called Bastard&quot; (1971), a spaghetti Western; &quot;Young Winston&quot; (1972), as Lord Randolph Churchill; &quot;A Reflection of Fear&quot; (1972); &quot;The Hireling&quot; (1973); he had a cameo in &quot;The Golden Voyage of Sinbad&quot; (1973); played mobster Doyle Lonnegan in &quot;The Sting&quot; (1973), a huge hit; was the subway-hijacker and hostage-taker &quot;Mr. Blue&quot; in &quot;The Taking of Pelham One Two Three&quot; (1974). 

He made his final appearance on Broadway, in a production of &quot;Dance of Death&quot;, in 1974.

&quot;The Man in the Glass Booth&quot; was further developed for the screen, but Shaw disapproved of the resulting screenplay and had his name removed from the credits. However, he viewed the completed film before its release and asked to have his name reinstated. In 2002, director Arthur Hiller related Shaw&#x27;s initial objection to the screenplay and his subsequent change of heart:When we decided that we needed more emotions in the film and leaned it towards that, we tried, obviously, to be honest to Robert Shaw, to keep that intellectual game-playing, but to create more of an emotional environment. And Robert Shaw became very disturbed. He did not like the idea and indeed, if you will watch the film, you will see that his name does not appear in the credits, nor does it even say, &quot;based on the play, &quot;The Man in the Glass Booth&quot;&quot; because he wouldn&#x27;t let us do it. He just didn&#x27;t like the idea until he saw the film. Then he phoned Eddie Anhalt, the screenwriter, and congratulated him because he thought it was—just kept the tone he wanted and did it so well. And he phoned Mort Abrahams the Executive Producer to see if he could get his name put on the final credits. But it was too late to restore his name, all the prints were all made. Arthur Hiller&#x27;s account is uncorroborated.

===Film stardom===
Shaw achieved his greatest film stardom after playing the shark-obsessed fisherman Quint in &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975), although he was at first reluctant to take the role since he did not like the book, but decided to accept at the urging of both his wife, actress Mary Ure, and his secretary: &quot;The last time they were that enthusiastic was &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;. And they were right.&quot;

Shaw then appeared in &quot;End of the Game&quot; (1975); &quot;Diamonds&quot; (1975), because &quot;I wanted to play a wonderfully elegant Englishman&quot;; &quot;Robin and Marian&quot; (1976) as the Sheriff of Nottingham opposite Audrey Hepburn (Maid Marian) and Sean Connery (Robin Hood); &quot;Swashbuckler&quot; (1976); playing the lighthouse keeper and treasure-hunter Romer Treece in &quot;The Deep&quot; (1977), for which his fee was $650,000; and as Israeli Mossad agent David Kabakov in &quot;Black Sunday&quot; (1977).

During filming &quot;Force 10 from Navarone&quot; (1978) Shaw said &quot;I&#x27;m seriously thinking that this might be my last film... I no longer have anything real to say. I&#x27;m appalled at some of the lines... I&#x27;m not at ease in film. I can&#x27;t remember the last film I enjoyed making.&quot; He made one more film, &quot;Avalanche Express&quot; (1979). Shaw and director/producer Mark Robson both died of heart attacks during post-production within months of each other; Robson in June 1978 and Shaw in August 1978. Shaw said he would use the proceeds from the film to pay off his taxes, then focus on writing and making the &quot;occasional small film&quot;.

==Personal life==
Shaw was married three times and had 10 children, two of whom were adopted. His first wife was Jennifer Bourke from 1952 to 1963, with whom he had four daughters. His second wife was actress Mary Ure from 1963 to 1975, with whom he had four children. He adopted a son from his wife&#x27;s previous marriage to playwright John Osborne. This marriage ended with Ure&#x27;s death from an overdose. His third and final wife was Virginia Jansen from 1976 until his death in 1978, with whom he had one son; he also adopted her son from a previous relationship. Robert Shaw was 51 years old.

For the last seven years of his life, Shaw lived at Drimbawn House in Tourmakeady, County Mayo, Ireland. Like his father, Shaw was an alcoholic for most of his life.

Shaw referred to himself as a socialist during the 1976 Cork International Film Festival. &quot;I started as a militant socialist, and I couldn&#x27;t even now vote Tory under pain of death,&quot; he elaborated in an interview later the same year, adding that &quot;I still think I am a socialist in a way.&quot;

== Death ==
Shaw died in Ireland at the age of 51 from a heart attack on 28 August 1978, while driving from Castlebar, County Mayo, to his home in Tourmakeady. He was accompanied by his wife and his son. He suddenly became ill, stopped the car, stepped out, then collapsed and lost consciousness on the roadside. He was taken to Castlebar General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. He had just completed acting in the film &quot;Avalanche Express&quot;. His body was cremated and his ashes scattered near his home in Tourmakeady. A stone memorial to him was unveiled there in his honour in August 2008, three decades after his death.

==Tributes==
Shaw has a Wetherspoons pub named after him in his birthplace of Westhoughton.

Villain Sebastian Shaw from the &quot;X-Men&quot; comics is named and modelled after Shaw.

Film director Ridley Scott, in the DVD commentary for &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000) when discussing the casting of Próximo and Marcus Aurelius, said &quot;We have very few Robert Shaws now&quot;, implying he had wanted to cast a certain type of rugged actor that Shaw typified, in this case Oliver Reed and Richard Harris.

<doc id="166125" wikidata="Q2305627" url="?curid=166125" title="List of Quercus species">
<text>The genus &quot;Quercus&quot; contains about 500 known species, plus about 180 hybrids between them. The genus, as is the case with many large genera, is divided into subgenera and sections. Traditionally, the genus &quot;Quercus&quot; was divided into the two subgenera &quot;Cyclobalanopsis&quot;, the ring-cupped oaks, and &quot;Quercus&quot;, which included all the other sections. However, a comprehensive revision in 2017 identified different relationships. Now the genus is commonly divided into a subgenus &quot;Quercus&quot; and a subgenus &quot;Cerris&quot;, with &quot;Cyclobalanopsis&quot; included in the latter. The sections of subgenus &quot;Quercus&quot; are mostly native to the New World, with the notable exception of the white oaks of sect. &quot;Quercus&quot; and the endemic &quot;Quercus pontica&quot;. In contrast, the sections of the subgenus &quot;Cerris&quot; are exclusively native to the Old World.

Unless otherwise indicated, the lists which follow contain all the species accepted by Plants of the World Online , plus selected hybrids that are also accepted, with placement into sections based on a list produced by Denk et al. for their 2017 classification of the genus.

==Legend==
Species with evergreen foliage (&quot;live oaks&quot;) are tagged &#x27;#&#x27;. Species in the genus have been recategorized between deciduous and evergreen on numerous occasions, although this does not necessarily mean that species in the two groups are closely related.

==Subgenus &quot;Quercus&quot;==

=== Section &quot;Quercus&quot; ===

Section &quot;Mesobalanus&quot; was included in section &quot;Quercus&quot; in the 2017 classification used here. Other synonyms include &quot;Q.&quot; sect. &quot;Albae&quot; and &quot;Q.&quot; sect. &quot;Macrocarpae&quot;. The section comprises the white oaks from Europe, Asia, north Africa, Central and North America. Styles short; acorns mature in 6 months, sweet or slightly bitter, inside of acorn shell hairless.

<doc id="166126" wikidata="Q183579" url="?curid=166126" title="Ferdinand I of Austria">
<text>Ferdinand I ( 19 April 1793 – 29 June 1875) was Emperor of Austria from March 1835 until his abdication in December 1848. He was also King of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia (as Ferdinand V), King of Lombardy–Venetia and holder of many other lesser titles (see grand title of the Emperor of Austria). Due to his passive but well-intentioned character, he gained the sobriquet The Benign () or The Benevolent (, Polish: &quot;Ferdynand Dobrotliwy&quot;).

Ferdinand succeeded his father Francis I upon his death on 2 March 1835. He was incapable of ruling the empire because of severe epilepsy, so his father, before he died, made a will promulgating that Ferdinand should consult his uncle Archduke Louis on all aspects of internal policy and urged him to be influenced by Prince Metternich, Austria&#x27;s Foreign Minister.

Following the Revolutions of 1848, Ferdinand abdicated on 2 December 1848. He was succeeded by his nephew, Franz Joseph. Following his abdication, he lived in Hradčany Palace, Prague, until his death in 1875.

Ferdinand married Maria Anna of Savoy, the sixth child of Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia. They had no children.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Ferdinand was the eldest son of Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor and Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily. Possibly as a result of his parents&#x27; genetic closeness (they were double first cousins), Ferdinand had hydrocephalus, neurological problems including epilepsy, and a speech impediment. He was educated by Baron Josef Kalasanz von Erberg, and his wife Countess Josephine von Attems.

=== Reign ===
Ferdinand suffered from epilepsy. Although he has been depicted as feeble-minded and incapable of ruling, he kept a coherent and legible diary and has even been said to have had a sharp wit. However, suffering as many as twenty seizures per day severely restricted his ability to rule with any effectiveness. Though he was not declared incapacitated, a Regent&#x27;s Council (Archduke Louis, Count Kolowrat, and Prince Metternich) steered the government.
When Ferdinand married Princess Maria Anna of Savoy, the court physician considered it unlikely that he would be able to consummate the marriage. When he tried to consummate the marriage, he had five seizures. He is also remembered for his command to his cook: when told he could not have apricot dumplings (&quot;Marillenknödel&quot;) because apricots were out of season, he said &quot;I am the Emperor, and I want dumplings!&quot; (!).

=== 1848 Revolution ===

As the revolutionaries of 1848 were marching on the palace, he is supposed to have asked Metternich for an explanation. When Metternich answered that they were starting a revolution, Ferdinand is supposed to have said &quot;But are they allowed to do that?&quot; (Viennese German: &quot;Ja, dürfen&#x27;s denn des?&quot;) He was convinced by Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg to abdicate in favour of his nephew, Franz Joseph (the next in line was Ferdinand&#x27;s younger brother Franz Karl, but he was persuaded by his wife Sophie to renounce his succession rights in favour of his son) who would occupy the Austrian throne for the next 68 years.

Ferdinand recorded the events in his diary:

===In retirement (1848–1875)===

Ferdinand was the last King of Bohemia to be crowned as such. Due to his sympathy with Bohemia (where he spent the rest of his life in Prague Castle) he was given the Czech nickname &quot;Ferdinand V, the Good&quot; (&quot;Ferdinand Dobrotivý&quot;). In Austria, Ferdinand was similarly nicknamed &quot;Ferdinand der Gütige&quot; (Ferdinand the Benign), but also ridiculed as &quot;Gütinand der Fertige&quot; (Goodinand the Finished).

Ferdinand was also the last ruler to be crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy in his capacity as King of Lombardy-Venetia.

He is interred in tomb number 62 in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna.

== Titles and honours ==
He used the titles:

* Lord of Trieste, Cattaro and over the Windic March.

=== Honours ===
== Ancestry ==
Ferdinand&#x27;s parents were double first cousins as they shared all four grandparents (Francis&#x27; paternal grandparents were his wife&#x27;s maternal grandparents and vice versa). Therefore, Ferdinand only had four great-grandparents, being descended from each of them twice. Further back in his ancestry there is more pedigree collapse due to the close intermarriage between the Houses of Austria and Spain and other Catholic monarchies.

<text>LyX (styled as LYX; pronounced ) is an open source, graphical user interface document processor based on the LaTeX typesetting system. Unlike most word processors, which follow the WYSIWYG (&quot;what you see is what you get&quot;) paradigm, LyX has a WYSIWYM (&quot;what you see is what you mean&quot;) approach, where what shows up on the screen roughly depicts the semantic structure of the page and is only an approximation of the document produced by TeX.

Since LyX relies on the typesetting system of LaTeX without being a full-fledged LaTeX editor itself, it has the power and flexibility of LaTeX, and can handle documents including books, notes, theses, academic papers, letters, etc. LyX&#x27;s interface is structured so that while knowledge of the LaTeX markup language is not necessary for basic usage, new LaTeX directives can be added into the document to support more complex features during editing — though not at the level of full control a full-fledged LaTeX editor can provide.

LyX is popular among technical authors and scientists for its advanced mathematical modes, though it is increasingly used by non-mathematically-oriented scholars as well for its bibliographic database integration and its ability to manage multiple files. LyX has also become a popular publishing tool among self-publishers.

LyX is available for all major operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, Linux, UNIX, ChromeOS, OS/2 and Haiku. LyX can be redistributed and modified under the terms of the GNU General Public License and is thus free software.

==Features==

LyX is a fully featured document processor. It provides structured document creation and editing, branches for having different versions of the same document, master and child documents, change tracking, support for writing documents in many languages and scripts, spell checking, graphics, table editing and automatic cross-reference (hyperlink) managing. LyX provides automatically numbered headings, titles, and paragraphs, with document outline. It features a powerful mathematical formula editor with point-and-click or keyboard-only interface.

LyX has native support for many document classes and templates available in LaTeX through codice_1. User layouts and modules can be made for those missing. Text is laid out according to standard typographic rules, including ligatures, kerning, indents, spacing, and hyphenation. It provides BibTeX/BibLaTeX citation support, comprehensive cross-referencing and PDF hyperlinks. LyX can import various common text formats.

Documents can be processed in LaTeX, PdfLaTeX, XeTeX and LuaTeX typesetting systems or exported to XHTML, DocBook, EPUB (via Docbook) and plain text. Versioning is provided through external control systems like SVN, Git, RCS, and CVS.

LyX supports right-to-left languages like Arabic, Persian, and Hebrew, along with support for bi-directional text. Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages are supported as well.

Documents can embed calculations via Octave or Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) like Maple, Maxima and Mathematica. Commands will be forwarded to the external programs and results will be embedded in the document.

==History==
Matthias Ettrich started developing a shareware program called Lyrix in 1995. It was then announced on Usenet, where it received a great deal of attention in the following years.

Shortly after the initial release, Lyrix was renamed to LyX due to a name clash with a word processor produced by the company Santa Cruz Operation. The name LyX was chosen because of the file suffix &lt;samp&gt;.lyx&lt;/samp&gt; for Lyrix files.

==Versions==
LyX has no set release schedule. Releases occur when there are important bug fixes or significant improvements. The following table lists the dates of all major releases. For collaboration between different users using the same major release is recommended as LyX file format remains fixed within each major release (e.g. all minor LyX versions 2.3.0, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, ... use strictly the same file format).

Tameside is bordered by the metropolitan boroughs of Stockport to the south, Oldham to the north and northeast, Manchester to the west, and to the east by the Borough of High Peak in Derbyshire. , the population of Tameside was , making it the 8th-most populous borough of Greater Manchester.

There are over 300 listed buildings in Tameside and three Scheduled Ancient Monuments, including Buckton Castle. Its townships were agricultural until the Industrial Revolution when they grew with the cotton industry. The borough was created in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972.

==History==
The history of the area stretches back up to 10,000 years; there are 22 Mesolithic sites in Tameside, the oldest dating to around 8000 BC; 21 of the 22 sites are in the hilly uplands in the north east of the borough. Evidence of Neolithic and Bronze Age activity is more limited in the borough, although the Bronze Age Stalybridge Cairn is the most complete prehistoric funerary monument in the borough. The people in the area changed from hunter-gatherers to farmers around 2500 BC–1500 BC due to climate change. Werneth Low is the most likely Iron Age farmstead site in the borough, probably dating to the late 1st millennium BC. Before the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD, the area was probably part of the territory of the Brigantes, the Celtic tribe controlling most of what is now north west England.

The area came under control of the Roman Empire in the second half of the 1st century. Roads through the area were established from Ardotalia fort in Derbyshire to Mamucium (Manchester) west of Tameside and Castleshaw Roman fort in the north. Romano-British finds in the borough include a bog body in Ashton Moss, occupation sites at Werneth Low, Harridge Pike, Roe Cross, and Mottram. A 4th-century coin hoard was found in Denton and is one of only four hoards from the 4th century in the Mersey basin. A Byzantine coin from the 6th or 7th centuries, also found in Denton, indicates continued or renewed occupation once the Romans left Britain in the early 5th century.

Nico Ditch, an earthwork stretching from Stretford to Ashton-under-Lyne, is evidence of Anglo-Saxon activity in Tameside. It was probably dug between the 7th and 9th centuries and may have been used as a boundary between the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. Further evidence of Anglo-Saxon era activity in Tameside comes from the derivation of settlement names from Old English such as -&quot;tun&quot;, meaning farmstead, and &quot;leah&quot; meaning clearing.

According to the Domesday Survey of 1086, Tameside was divided into four manors, those of Tintwistle, Hollingworth, Werneth, and Mottram. The land east of the River Tame was in the Hundred of Hamestan in Cheshire and held by the Earl of Chester while to the west of the river was in the Hundred of Salford under Roger de Poitevin. These manors were divided to create further manors, so that by the 13th century most of them were owned by local families and remained in the hands of the same families until the 16th century. Manorialism continued as the main form of administration and governance until the mid-19th century.

The Industrial Revolution had a significant impact on Tameside; the area, whose main towns had previously been Ashton-under-Lyne and Mottram-in-Longdendale, was transformed from a collection of the rural, farming communities into mill towns. The towns of Ashton-under-Lyne, Dukinfield, Hyde, Mossley and Stalybridge have been described as &quot;amongst the most famous mills towns in the North West&quot;. With only a brief interruption for the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861 to 1865, factories producing and processing textiles were the main industry in Tameside from the late-18th century until the mid-20th century.

In 1964, Dukinfield Borough Council convened a meeting of neighbouring local authorities with the aim of formulating a policy of cross-authority social improvement for the districts in the Tame Valley. Following deindustrialisation, the area had suffered &quot;gross-neglect&quot; and had large areas of housing unsuitable for human habitation. This joint enterprise comprised the nine districts that would become Tameside ten years later, plus the County Borough of Stockport. This collective agreed on creating &quot;a linear park in the valley [of the River Tame] for the use of the townspeople and as a major recreational resource within the Manchester metropolis&quot;.

Tameside was created on 1 April 1974, by the Local Government Act 1972 as one of the ten metropolitan districts of Greater Manchester. The new district covered the territory of nine former districts which were abolished at the same time:
*Ashton-under-Lyne Municipal Borough
*Audenshaw Urban District
*Denton Urban District
*Droylsden Urban District
*Dukinfield Municipal Borough
*Hyde Municipal Borough
*Longdendale Urban District
*Mossley Municipal Borough
*Stalybridge Municipal Borough
Dukinfield, Hyde, Longdendale and Stalybridge had been in the administrative county of Cheshire prior to the 1974 reforms, whilst the other five districts had been in the administrative county of Lancashire.

A name for the metropolitan borough proved problematic. The Redcliffe-Maud Report had used the name Ashton-Hyde, but double-barrelled names were prohibited for the new districts. Had Ashton-under-Lyne been a county borough, or had had a less common name, &quot;it might have been chosen as the new name&quot; for the new district. The eight other towns objected, adamant that &quot;a new name should be found&quot;. Thirty suggestions were put forward, including Brigantia, Clarendon, Hartshead, Kayborough, Tame, Ninetowns, and West Pennine, with Hartshead (with reference to Hartshead Pike) being the most popular throughout most of the consultation period. However, the name Tameside (with reference to the River Tame, but a concocted name with no historical basis) won 15 votes to Hartshead&#x27;s 10 in a final stage of voting. The new district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chairman of the council to take the title of mayor. In 1986 Tameside effectively became a unitary authority with the abolition of the Greater Manchester County Council.

==Geography==

 Tameside borders High Peak in Derbyshire to the east, the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham to the north, the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport to the south, and the City of Manchester to the west. Tameside features flat lowlands in the west and highlands in the east where the western edge of the Pennines encroaches on the borough. The hills in the east include Hartshead Pike and Werneth Low which is also a country park. As well as coal measures running north–south through the centre of the borough, there are areas of peat in the north east and there are large areas of boulder clay all over Tameside. Ashton Moss is a peat bog covering about and Denton Moor is an area of about of peat.
Waterways in Tameside include the rivers Medlock and Etherow, which form parts of Tameside&#x27;s western and eastern boundaries respectively, and the River Tame crosses the borough north to south, giving Tameside its name. The Ashton Canal, the Hollinwood Branch Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal, and the Peak Forest Canal all run through the borough. There are also several reservoirs, including the Audenshaw Reservoirs. Greenspace accounts for 63.5% of the Tameside&#x27;s total area, domestic buildings and gardens comprise 17.4%, and the rest is made up of roads and non-domestic buildings.

Localities within the boundaries of Tameside include: Ashton-under-Lyne, Audenshaw, Broadbottom, Carrbrook, Copley, Denton, Droylsden, Dukinfield, Flowery Field, Gee Cross, Godley, Godley Green, Guide Bridge, Hartshead Green, Hattersley, Haughton Green, Hazelhurst, Heyrod, Hollingworth, Hyde, Landslow Green, Luzley, Millbrook, Mossley, Mottram in Longdendale, Newton, Park Bridge, Roe Cross, Stalybridge, Warhill, and Woolley Bridge.

==Governance==

===Parliamentary constituencies===
The residents of the Tameside are represented in the United Kingdom Parliament by Members of Parliament (MPs) for three constituencies. Ashton-under-Lyne, which also includes parts of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, is represented by Angela Rayner (Labour). Denton and Reddish, which also covers parts of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport, is represented by Andrew Gwynne (Labour). Stalybridge and Hyde, which is entirely within Tameside, is represented by Jonathan Reynolds (Labour).

===Council===
In 2007, Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council was assessed by the Audit Commission and judged to be &quot;improving strongly&quot; in providing services for local people. Overall the council was awarded &quot;four star&quot; status meaning it was &quot;performing strongly&quot; and &quot;well above minimum requirements&quot;, putting it in the top 38% of all local authorities.

Civil parishes form the bottom tier of local government; the parish councils are involved in planning, management of town and parish centres, and promoting tourism. Mossley is the only civil parish in Tameside. In 2001 9,856 people lived there, 4.6% of the borough&#x27;s population.

Before becoming a civil parish, Mossley was a municipal borough. The unparished areas are: Ashton-under-Lyne (municipal borough), Audenshaw (urban district), Denton (urban district), Droylsden (urban district), Dukinfield (municipal borough), Hyde (municipal borough), Longdendale (urban district), and Stalybridge (municipal borough). The status of each area before 1974 is shown in brackets. An urban district was a type of local government district which covered an urbanised area. Ashton-under-Lyne, Audenshaw, Denton, Droylsden, and Mossley were previously in Lancashire. Dukinfield, Hyde, Longdendale, and Stalybridge were in Cheshire.

Tameside is currently undergoing redevelopment through the Vision Tameside project which should be completed by 2018.

Vision Tameside – a partnership between Tameside council and Tameside College – is a redevelopment strategy.

Three &quot;advanced learning centres&quot; are being built in central Ashton town and at the college&#x27;s Beaufort Road home.

Phase one comprises two sites. The new Clarendon Sixth Form College, which began taking students in the autumn of 2015, was officially opened by Coronation Street actress Brooke Vincent on 9 March 2016. The college theatre was named in Brooke&#x27;s honour.

An &quot;advanced technologies centre&quot; is being built on Stamford Street, Ashton. When it opens in 2017 it will provide a learning facility to support the growth of advanced engineering and technology in Tameside.

<doc id="166132" wikidata="Q77154" url="?curid=166132" title="Immanuel Hermann Fichte">
<text>Immanuel Hermann Fichte (; ; ennobled as Immanuel Hermann von Fichte in 1863; 18 July 1796 – 8 August 1879) was a German philosopher and son of Johann Gottlieb Fichte. In his philosophy, he was a theist and strongly opposed to the Hegelian School.

==Life==
Fichte was born in Jena. He early devoted himself to philosophical studies, being attracted by the later views of his father, which he considered essentially theistic. He graduated from the University of Berlin in 1818. Soon after, he became a lecturer in philosophy there. He also attended the lectures of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, but felt averse to what he deemed to be his pantheistic tendencies. As a result of semi-official suggestions, based on official disapproval of his supposedly liberal views, he decided, in 1822, to leave Berlin, and accepted a professorship at the gymnasium in Saarbrücken. In 1826 he went in the same capacity to Düsseldorf. In 1836 he became an extraordinary professor of philosophy at the University of Bonn, and in 1840 full professor. Here he quickly became a successful and much admired lecturer. Dissatisfied with the reactionary tendencies of the Prussian Ministry of Education, he accepted a call to the chair of philosophy at the University of Tübingen in 1842 where he continued to give lectures on all philosophic subjects until his retirement in 1875 when he moved to Stuttgart. He died in Stuttgart on 8 August 1879.

In 1837, Fichte founded the &quot;Zeitschrift für Philosophie und speculative Theologie&quot; and edited from then on. In 1847, the name was changed to &quot;Zeitschrift für Philosophie und philosophische Kritik&quot;. Publication was suspended 1848–1852, after which Hermann Ulrici and Johann Ulrich Wirth joined him as editors. This journal served as an organ of Fichte&#x27;s views, especially on the subject of the philosophy of religion, where he was in alliance with C. H. Weisse (with whom he regularly corresponded after 1829); but, whereas Weisse thought that the Hegelian structure was sound in the main, and its imperfections might be mended, Fichte held it to be defective, and spoke of it as a masterpiece of erroneous consistency or consistent error. Fichte&#x27;s general views on philosophy seem to have changed considerably as he gained in years, and his influence has been impaired by certain inconsistencies and an appearance of eclecticism, which is strengthened by his predominantly historical treatment of systems, his desire to include divergent systems within his own, and his conciliatory tone.

==Philosophical work==
The great aim of his speculations was to find a philosophic basis for the personality of God, and for his theory on this subject he proposed the term &quot;concrete theism.&quot; His philosophy attempts to reconcile monism (Hegel) and individualism (Herbart) by means of monadism (Leibniz). He attacks Hegelianism for its pantheism, lowering of human personality, and imperfect recognition of demands of the moral consciousness. God, he says, is to be regarded not as an absolute but as an Infinite Person, whose desire it is that he should realize himself in finite persons. These persons are objects of God&#x27;s love, and he arranges the world for their good. The direct connecting link between God man is the genius, a higher spiritual individuality existing fan by the side of his lower, earthly individuality. Fichte advocates an ethical theism, and his arguments might be turned to account by the apologist of Christianity. In conception of finite personality he recurs to something like monadism of Leibniz. His insistence on moral experience connected with his insistence on personality.

One of the tests which Fichte discriminates the value of previous systems is adequateness with which they interpret moral experience. The same reason that made him depreciate Hegel made him praise Krause (panentheism) and Schleiermacher, and speak respectfully of English philosophy. It is characteristic of Fichte&#x27;s most excessive receptiveness that in his latest published work, &quot;Der neuere Spiritualismus&quot; (1878), he supports his position by arguments of a somewhat occult or theosophical cast, not unlike that adopted by F. W. H. Myers.

The regeneration of Christianity, according to Fichte, would consist in its becoming the vital and organizing power in the state, instead of being occupied solely, as heretofore, with the salvation of individuals.

<doc id="166133" wikidata="Q1637842" url="?curid=166133" title="613 commandments">
<text>According to Jewish tradition, the Torah contains 613 commandments ().

Although the number 613 is mentioned in the Talmud, its real significance increased in later medieval rabbinic literature, including many works listing or arranged by the . The most famous of these was an enumeration of the 613 commandments by Maimonides. While the total number of commandments is 613, no individual can perform all of them. Many can only be observed at the Temple in Jerusalem, which no longer stands. According to one standard reckoning, there are 77 positive and 194 negative commandments that can be observed today, of which there are 26 commandments that apply only within the Land of Israel. In addition, some commandments only apply to certain categories of Jews: some are only observed by &quot;kohanim&quot;, and others only by men or by women.

==Symbolism of 613==

Rav Hamnuna sourced the count of 613 in the verse (&quot;Moses commanded us the Torah...&quot;). The Talmud notes that the Hebrew numerical value (&quot;gematria&quot;) of the word &quot;Torah&quot; is 611 ( = 400,  = 6,  = 200,  = 5). Combining 611 commandments which Moses taught the people, with the first two of the Ten Commandments which were the only ones directly heard from God, a total of 613 is reached. 

Other sources connect the &quot;tzitzit&quot; (ritual fringes of a garment) to the 613 commandments by gematria: the word (Hebrew: ציצית, in its Mishnaic spelling) has the value 600 ( = 90,  = 10,  = 400). Each tassel has eight threads (when doubled over) and five sets of knots. The sum of all these numbers is 613, reflecting the concept that reminds its wearer of all Torah commandments.

Many Jewish philosophical and mystical works (e.g., by Baal HaTurim, the Maharal of Prague and leaders of Hasidic Judaism) find allusions and inspirational calculations relating to the number of commandments.

==Dissent and difficulties==
Rabbinic support for the number of commandments being 613 is not without dissent. For example, Ben Azzai held that there exist 300 positive . Also, even as the number gained acceptance, difficulties arose in elucidating the list. Some rabbis declared that this count was not an authentic tradition, or that it was not logically possible to come up with a systematic count. No early work of Jewish law or Biblical commentary depended on the 613 system, and no early systems of Jewish principles of faith made acceptance of this Aggadah (non-legal Talmudic statement) normative. A number of classical authorities denied that it was normative:
*Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra denied that this was an authentic rabbinic tradition. Ibn Ezra writes &quot;Some sages enumerate 613 in many diverse ways [...] but in truth there is no end to the number of [...] and if we were to count only the root principles [...] the number of would not reach 613&quot;.
* Nahmanides held that this particular counting was a matter of rabbinic controversy, and that rabbinic opinion on this is not unanimous. Nonetheless, he concedes that &quot;this total has proliferated throughout the aggadic literature... we ought to say that it was a tradition from Moses at Mount Sinai&quot;.
* Rabbi Simeon ben Zemah Duran likewise rejected the dogma of the 613 as being the sum of the Law, saying that &quot;perhaps the agreement that the number of is 613... is just Rabbi Simlai&#x27;s opinion, following his own explication of the . And we need not rely on his explication when we come to determine [and affect] the Law, but rather on the Talmudic discussions&quot;.
* Gersonides held that the number 613 was only one rabbi&#x27;s (Rabbi Simlai&#x27;s) opinion, and if the conclusion of a Talmudic discussion indicated that the number of commandments was greater or lesser than 613, Rabbi Simlai&#x27;s opinion would be overruled. He argued that the number 613 was only intended as an approximation, and that the comparison to 248 limbs and 365 days was intended homiletically, to motivate Jews to keep the commandments. 
* The Vilna Gaon suggested that there exist many more than 613 commandments (because otherwise large narrative parts of the Pentateuch would be without commandments, which he considered difficult to accept) and that the count of 613 refers to &quot;roots&quot; () of the other commandments.

Even when rabbis attempted to compile a list of the 613 commandments, they were faced with a number of difficulties:
*Which statements were to be included amongst the 613 commandments? Every one of God&#x27;s commands to any individual or to the entire people of Israel?
*Would an order from God be counted as a commandment, for the purposes of such a list, if it could only be complied with in one place and time? Else, would such an order only count as a commandment if it could be followed at all times? (The latter is the view of Maimonides.)
*Does counting a single commandment depend on whether it falls within one verse, even though it may contain multiple prohibitions, or should each prohibition count as a single commandment?

Ultimately, though, the concept of 613 commandments has become accepted as normative amongst practicing Jews and today it is still common practice to refer to the total system of commandments within the Torah as the &quot;613 commandments&quot;, even among those who do not literally accept this count as accurate.

However, the 613 do not constitute a formal code of present-day halakha. Later codes of law such as the Shulkhan Arukh and the Kitzur Shulkhan Arukh do not refer to it. However, Maimonides&#x27; Mishneh Torah is prefaced by a count of the 613 mitzvot.

==Works which enumerate the commandments==
There is no single definitive list that explicates the 613 commandments. Lists differ, for example, in how they interpret passages in the Torah that may be read as dealing with several cases under a single law or several separate laws (see here for a visual comparison of several lists). Other &quot;commandments&quot; in the Torah are restricted as one-time acts, and would not be considered as &quot;&quot; binding on other persons. In rabbinic literature, Rishonim and later scholars composed to articulate and justify their enumeration of the commandments:
*&quot;Halachot Gedolot&quot; (&quot;Great Laws&quot;), thought to be written by Rabbi Simeon Kayyara (the , author of the ) is the earliest extant enumeration of the 613 .
* (&quot;Book of Commandments&quot;) by Rabbi Saadia Gaon. Written during the period of the Geonim, Saadia&#x27;s work is a simple list (though it was later expanded by Rabbi Yerucham Fishel Perlow.)
*&quot;Sefer Hamitzvot&quot; (&quot;Book of Commandments&quot;) by Maimonides, with a commentary by Nachmanides. Maimonides employs a set of fourteen rules () which determine inclusion into the list. In this work, he supports his specification of each mitzvah through quotations from the &quot;midrash halakha&quot; and the Gemara. Nachmanides makes a number of critical points and replaces some items of the list with others.
*&quot;Sefer ha-Chinnuch&quot; (&quot;Book of Education&quot;). This work generally follows Maimonides&#x27; reckoning of the 613 commandments. It is written in the order in which the commandments appear in the Torah rather than an arrangement by category (as in Maimonides&#x27; work.) In addition to enumerating the commandments and giving a brief overview of relevant laws, the also tries to explain the philosophical reasons behind the . It has been attributed to various authors, most commonly Rabbi Aaron ha-Levi of Barcelona (the ), though its true authorship is unknown.
*&quot;Sefer Mitzvot Gadol&quot; or SMaG (&quot;Large book of Commandments&quot;) by Rabbi Moses ben Jacob of Coucy.
* by Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan (the &quot;&quot;). The &#x27;s work follows the reckoning of Maimonides but gives only the commandments relevant today. Notably, this listing omits commandments regarding temple service, ritual purity, sacrifices, and so on. Though the original work included only those commandments relevant in all places and at all times, later editions include agricultural laws relevant today only in the Land of Israel.

===Works in which the number of commandments is not 613 ===
* by Eliezer ben Samuel lists only 417 commandments (including commandments only applicable when the Temple stood).
* Menahem Recanati, in his book , counted 250 positive and 361 negative commandments, for a total of 611. These 611 include the two commandments of , indicating that this list is incompatible with the approach of R&#x27; Hamnuna in the Talmud (who said that of the 613 commandments, the two in Exodus 20:2 were given directly by God, and the remaining 611 via Moses).
*, by Rabbi Isaac of Corbeil, listed 320 commandments applicable nowadays. To reach a total of 613, one would have to add 293 commandments applicable only while the Temple stood. As the number of Temple-only commandments appears to be much lower than 293 (for example, Sefer haHinuch only counted 201 such commandments), it seems that the overall count of commandments would likely be lower than 613.
*According to Asael Ben-Or, Gersonides&#x27; commentary to the Torah indicates that he counted a total of 513 commandments.

<text>Cosmos 1 was a project by Cosmos Studios and The Planetary Society to test a solar sail in space. As part of the project, an uncrewed solar-sail spacecraft named &quot;Cosmos 1&quot; was launched into space at 19:46:09 UTC (15:46:09 EDT) on 21 June 2005 from the submarine in the Barents Sea. However, a rocket failure prevented the spacecraft from reaching its intended orbit. Once in orbit, the spacecraft was supposed to deploy a large sail, upon which photons from the Sun would push, thereby increasing the spacecraft&#x27;s velocity (the contributions from the solar wind are similar, but of much smaller magnitude).

Had the mission been successful, it would have been the first ever orbital use of a solar sail to speed up a spacecraft, as well as the first space mission by a space advocacy group. The project budget was US$4 million. The Planetary Society planned to raise another US$4 million for &quot;Cosmos 2&quot;, a reimplementation of the experiment provisionally to be launched on a Soyuz resupply mission to the International Space Station (ISS). The Discovery Channel was an early investor. However, advances in technology and the greater availability of lower-mass piggyback slots on more launch vehicles led to a redesign similar to NanoSail-D, called LightSail-1, announced in November 2009.

== Planned mission profile ==
To test the solar sail concept, the Cosmos 1 project launched an orbital spacecraft they named &quot;Cosmos 1&quot; with a full complement of eight sail blades on 21 June 2005; the summer solstice. The spacecraft had a mass of and consisted of eight triangular sail blades, which would be deployed from a central hub after launch by the inflating of structural tubes. The sail blades were each long, had a total surface area of , and were made of aluminized-reinforced PET film (MPET).

The spacecraft was launched on a Volna launch vehicle (a converted SS-N-18 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)) from the Russian Delta III submarine , submerged in the Barents Sea. The spacecraft&#x27;s initial circular orbit would have been at an altitude of about , where it would have unfurled the sails. The sails would then have gradually raised the spacecraft to a higher Earth orbit. &quot;&quot;Cosmos 1&quot; might boost its orbit over the expected 30-day life of the mission&quot;, said Louis Friedman of The Planetary Society.

The mission was expected to end within a month of launch, as the mylar of the blades would degrade in sunlight.

=== Possible beam propulsion ===
The solar-sail craft could also have been used to measure the effect of artificial microwaves aimed at it from a radar installation. A dish at the Goldstone facility of NASA Deep Space Network would have been used to irradiate the sail with a 450 kW beam. This experiment in beam-powered propulsion would only have been attempted after the prime mission objective of controlled solar-sail flight was achieved.

=== Tracking ===
The craft would have been visible to the naked eye from most of the Earth&#x27;s surface: the planned orbit had an inclination of 80°, so it would have been visible from latitudes of up to approximately 80° north and south.

A network of tracking stations around the world, including the Tarusa station, south of Moscow, and the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, tried to maintain contact with the solar sail during the mission. Mission control was based primarily at the Russian company NPO Lavochkin in Moscow; a center that the Planetary Society calls Mission Operations Moscow (MOM).

== Physics ==
The craft would have been gradually accelerating during each orbit as a result of the radiation pressure of photons colliding with the sails. As photons reflected from the surface of the sails, they would transfer momentum to them. As there would be no air resistance to oppose the velocity of the spacecraft, acceleration would be proportional to the number of photons colliding with it per unit time. Sunlight amounts to a tiny acceleration in the vicinity of the Earth. Over one day, the spacecraft&#x27;s speed would reach ; in 100 days its speed would be , in 2.74 years .

At that speed, a craft would reach Pluto, a very distant dwarf planet in the Solar System, in less than 5 years, although in practice the acceleration of a sail drops dramatically as the spacecraft gets farther from the Sun. However, in the vicinity of Earth, a solar sail&#x27;s acceleration is larger than that of some other propulsion techniques; for example, the ion thruster-propelled SMART-1 spacecraft has a maximum acceleration of , which allowed SMART-1 to achieve lunar orbit in November 2004 after launch in September 2003.

== Other aspects ==
Besides the main spacecraft, launched in June 2005, the Cosmos 1 project has funded two other craft:
* A suborbital test was attempted in 2001 with only two sail blades. The spacecraft failed to separate from the rocket.
* A second orbital spacecraft (LightSail-1) was launched in May 2015.

One of &quot;Cosmos 1&quot; solar-sail blades was displayed at the Rockefeller Center office complex in New York City in 2003.

<text>The Planetary Society is an American internationally-active non-governmental nonprofit organization. It is involved in research, public outreach, and political space advocacy for engineering projects related to astronomy, planetary science, and space exploration. It was founded in 1980 by Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis Friedman, and has about 60,000 members from more than 100 countries around the world.

The Society is dedicated to the exploration of the Solar System, the search for near-Earth objects, and the search for extraterrestrial life. The society&#x27;s mission is stated as: &quot;Empowering the world’s citizens to advance space science and exploration.&quot; The Planetary Society is a strong advocate for space funding and missions of exploration within NASA. They lobby Congress and engage their membership in the United States to write and call their representatives in support of NASA funding.

In addition to public outreach, The Planetary Society has sponsored solar sail and microorganisms-in-space projects to foster space exploration. In June 2005, the Society launched the &quot;Cosmos 1&quot; craft to test the feasibility of solar sailing, but the rocket failed shortly after liftoff. LightSail was originally conceived as a series of three solar sail experiments but later shortened to two missions. LightSail 1 launched on May 20, 2015, and demonstrated a test deployment of its solar sail on June 7, 2015. LightSail 2 launched on June 25, 2019, and successfully used sunlight to change its orbit. 

Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment (LIFE), was a two-part program designed to test the ability of microorganisms to survive in space. The first phase flew on STS-134, Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s final flight in 2011. The second phase rode on Russia&#x27;s Fobos-Grunt mission, which attempted to go to Mars&#x27; moon Phobos and back but failed to escape Earth orbit.

== History ==
The Planetary Society was founded in 1980 by Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis Friedman as a champion of public support of space exploration and the search for extraterrestrial life. Until the death of Carl Sagan in 1996, the Society was led by Sagan, who used his celebrity and political clout to influence the political climate of the time, including protecting SETI in 1981 from congressional cancellation. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the Society pushed its scientific and technologic agenda, which led to an increased interest in rover-based planetary exploration and NASA&#x27;s &quot;New Horizons&quot; mission to Pluto.

In addition to its political affairs the Society has created a number of space related projects and programs. The SETI program began with Paul Horowitz&#x27;s Suitcase SETI and has grown to encompass searches in radio and optical wavelengths from the northern and southern hemispheres of the Earth. SETI@home, the largest distributed computing experiment on Earth, is perhaps the Society&#x27;s best-known SETI project. Other projects include the development of the Mars Microphone instrument which flew on the failed Mars Polar Lander project, as well as two LightSail projects, solar sail technology demonstrators designed to determine whether space travel is possible by using only sunlight.

== Program summary ==
The Planetary Society currently runs seven different program areas with a number of programs in each area:

* Advocacy and education
* Extrasolar planets
* Innovative technologies
* International mission participation
* Mars exploration
* Near-Earth objects
* Search for extraterrestrial life
== Organization ==
The Planetary Society is currently governed by a 12-member volunteer board of directors chosen for their passion about and knowledge of space exploration. The Board has a chairman, President, and Vice President and an Executive Committee, and normally meets twice per year to set the Society&#x27;s policies and future directions. Nominations are sought and considered periodically from a variety of sources, including from members of the Board and Advisory Council, Society Members, staff, and experts in the space community. On June 7, 2010, the Society announced that American science educator Bill Nye would become the new executive director of the society.

== Board of Directors ==
The Planetary Society&#x27;s current board of directors consists of:

*Bill Nye, chief executive officer
*Daniel Geraci, chairman of the board
*Bethany Ehlmann, President and member of executive committee

== &quot;The Planetary Report&quot; ==
The &quot;Planetary Report&quot; is the quarterly internationally recognized flagship magazine of The Planetary Society, featuring articles and full-color photos to provide comprehensive coverage of discoveries on Earth and other planets. It went from bimonthly to quarterly with the June (summer solstice) 2011 issue.

This magazine reaches 60,000 members of The Planetary Society all over the world, with news about planetary missions, spacefaring nations, space explorers, planetary science controversies, and the latest findings in humankind&#x27;s exploration of the Solar System. It will be edited beginning in September 2018 by Emily Lakdawalla, who takes over from Donna Stevens.

== &quot;Planetary Radio&quot; ==
The Planetary Society also produces &quot;Planetary Radio&quot;, a weekly 30-minute radio program and podcast hosted and produced by Sarah Al-Ahmed. The show&#x27;s programming consists mostly of interviews and telephone-based conversations with scientists, engineers, project managers, artists, writers, astronauts, and many other professionals who can provide some insight or perspective into the current state of space exploration.

== Science and Technology Empowered by the Public program ==
In 2022, the Planetary Society awarded its first grants as part of its Science and Technology Empowered by the Public (STEP) program. The inaugural grant winners were a team from University of California, Los Angeles for a SETI project and a team from University of Belgrade, Serbia, for a planetary defense project.

<text>A vehicle identification number (VIN; also called a chassis number or frame number) is a unique code, including a serial number, used by the automotive industry to identify individual motor vehicles, towed vehicles, motorcycles, scooters and mopeds, as defined by the International Organization for Standardization in ISO 3779 (content and structure) and ISO 4030 (location and attachment).

There are vehicle history services in several countries that help potential car owners use VINs to find vehicles that are defective or have been written off.

== History ==
VINs were first used in 1954 in the United States. From 1954 to 1965, there was no accepted standard for these numbers, so different manufacturers and even divisions within a manufacturer used different formats. Many were little more than a serial number. Starting in January 1966 the US Government mandated that a 13-character VIN be used. This specification was phased in over several years. US manufacturers used them starting in January 1966 – by January 1, 1969, all cars sold in the US were required to have the 13 character VIN. The 1966 US specification only stated that the year of manufacture, engine type, and a six digit unique number (with that being the last six characters) were required -- the individual manufacturers could use the remaining five spaces for whatever they liked. This was not much better than what was in use by some US manufacturers before 1966.

In 1981, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the United States standardized the format. It required all on-road vehicles sold to contain a 17-character VIN, which does not include the letters O (o), I (i), and Q (q) (to avoid confusion with numerals 0, 1, and 9). This was largely based on the ISO 3779 standard, but is more stringent. 

After the introduction of the ISO standard, the manufacturers which produced vehicles for the American market very quickly adjusted to this standard. ISO introduced recommendations for applying the VIN standard and its structure, and the VIN was also used in Europe. However, the sets of information contained in it were introduced gradually. For example, Volkswagen started to encode bigger chunks of information during 1995–1997, and the control digit during 2009–2015 for selected models from the group. The VIN control digit is also used, although not in all brand-models. In the European vehicles, it can be found e.g. in Audi A1.

== Classification ==
There are at least four competing standards used to calculate the VIN.
* FMVSS 115, Part 565: Used in United States and Canada
* ISO 3779: Used in Europe and many other parts of the world
* SAE J853: Very similar to the ISO standard
* ADR 61/2 used in Australia, referring to ISO 3779 and 3780

==Components==
Modern VINs are based on two related standards, originally issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1979 and 1980: ISO 3779 and ISO 3780, respectively. Compatible but different implementations of these ISO standards have been adopted by the European Union and the United States.

The VIN comprises the following sections:

===World manufacturer identifier===
The first three characters uniquely identify the manufacturer of the vehicle using the world manufacturer identifier or WMI code. A manufacturer who builds fewer than 1,000 vehicles per year uses a 9 as the third digit, and the 12th, 13th and 14th position of the VIN for a second part of the identification. Some manufacturers use the third character as a code for a vehicle category (e.g., bus or truck), a division within a manufacturer, or both. For example, within (assigned to General Motors in the United States), represents Chevrolet passenger cars; , Pontiac passenger cars; and , Chevrolet trucks.

The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in the US assigns WMIs to countries and manufacturers.

The first character of the WMI is typically the region in which the manufacturer is located. In practice, each is assigned to a country of manufacture, although in Europe the country where the continental headquarters is located can assign the WMI to all vehicles produced in that region. (Example: When Adam Opel AG was still with General Motors, Opel/Vauxhall cars designed in that era used to carry a &quot;German&quot; WMI (e.g. W0L, W0V), because Adam Opel AG was based in Rüsselsheim, Germany, no matter if vehicles were produced in Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom or Poland. When Opel changed hands and became part of PSA, this changed for newer models, which obtained &quot;French&quot; WMIs.)

Company mergers and acquisitions can lead to seemingly confusing allocations. For instance, Stellantis, the result of the merger of PSA (France) and FCA (Italy), is technically a Dutch corporation headquartered in Amsterdam. VIN numbers of European-made vehicles or their brands, though, still carry WMIs from France and Italy. Additionally, it may not be immediately obvious what particular local subsidiary of the corporation manages type approvals of vehicles and application for WMIs, since this does not necessarily depend on the perceived country association of the respective brand. For example, in at least one case, a model that was newly released years after the merger by an Italian brand (ex-FCA) carries VIN numbers with new French WMIs (the 2024 Lancia Ypsilon – incidentally manufactured in Spain). It is to be expected that assignment policies of this kind, often for unpublished reasons, can be found at other manufacturers as well.

In the notation below, assume that letters precede numbers and that zero is the last number. For example, 8X–82 denotes the range 8X, 8Y, 8Z, 81, 82, excluding 80.

====Country or region codes====
===Vehicle descriptor section===
The fourth to ninth positions in the VIN are the vehicle descriptor section or VDS. This is used, according to local regulations, to identify the vehicle type, and may include information on the automobile platform used, the model, and the body style. Each manufacturer has a unique system for using this field. Most manufacturers since the 1980s have used the eighth digit to identify the engine type whenever there is more than one engine choice for the vehicle. Example: for the 2007 Chevrolet Corvette, U is for a 6.0-liter V8 engine, and E is for a 7.0-liter V8.

====North American check digits====
One element that is inconsistent is the use of position nine as a check digit, compulsory for vehicles in North America and China, but not Europe.

===Vehicle identifier section===
The 10th to 17th positions are used as the vehicle identifier section or VIS. This is used by the manufacturer to identify the individual vehicle in question. This may include information on options installed or engine and transmission choices, but often is a simple sequential number.

====Model year encoding====
The North American implementation of the VIS uses the 10th digit to encode the model year of the vehicle. Besides the three letters that are not allowed in the VIN itself (I, O and Q), the letters U and Z and the digit 0 are not used for the model year code. Outside North America the 10th digit is usually 0.

The year 1980 was encoded by some manufacturers, especially General Motors and Chrysler, as &quot;A&quot; (since the 17-digit VIN was not mandatory until 1981, and the &quot;A&quot; or zero was in the manufacturer&#x27;s pre-1981 placement in the VIN), yet Ford and AMC still used a zero for 1980. Subsequent years increment through the allowed letters, so that &quot;Y&quot; represents the year 2000. 2001 to 2009 are encoded as the digits 1 to 9, and subsequent years are encoded as &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, etc.

On April 30, 2008, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration adopted a final rule amending 49 CFR Part 565, &quot;so that the current 17 character vehicle identification number (VIN) system, which has been in place for almost 30 years, can continue in use for at least another 30 years&quot;, in the process making several changes to the VIN requirements applicable to all motor vehicles manufactured for sale in the United States. There were three notable changes to the VIN structure that affect VIN deciphering systems:
* The make may only be identified after looking at positions one through three and another position, as determined by the manufacturer in the second section or fourth to eighth segment of the VIN.
* In order to identify the exact year in passenger cars and multipurpose passenger vehicles with a GVWR of 10,000 or less, one must read position 7 as well as position 10. For passenger cars, and for multipurpose passenger vehicles and trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of or less, if position seven is numeric, the model year in position 10 of the VIN refers to a year in the range 1980–2009. If position seven is alphabetic, the model year in position 10 of VIN refers to a year in the range 2010–2039.
* The model year for vehicles with a GVWR greater than , as well as buses, motorcycles, trailers and low-speed vehicles, may no longer be identified within a 30-year range. VIN characters 1–8 and 10 that were assigned from 1980 to 2009 can be repeated beginning with the 2010 model year.

====Plant code====
Compulsory in North America and China is the use of the 11th character to identify the assembly plant at which the vehicle was built. Each manufacturer has its own set of plant codes.

====Production number====
In the United States and China, the 12th to 17th digits are the vehicle&#x27;s serial or production number. This is unique to each vehicle, and every manufacturer uses its own sequence.

==Check-digit calculation==

A check-digit validation is used for all road vehicles sold in the United States and Canada.

When trying to validate a VIN with a check digit, first either (a) remove the check digit for the purpose of calculation or (b) use a weight of zero (see below) to cancel it out. The original value of the check digit is then compared with the calculated value. If the calculated value is 0–9, the check digit must match the calculated value. If the calculated value is 10, the check digit must be X. If the two values do not match (and there was no error in the calculation), then there is a mistake in the VIN. However, a match does not prove the VIN is correct, because there is still a 1/11 chance that any two distinct VINs have a matching check digit: for example, the valid VINs (correct with leading five) and (incorrect with leading character &quot;S&quot;). The VINs in the Porsche image, , and the GM-T body image, , do not pass the North American check-digit verification.

===Transliterating the numbers===
Transliteration consists of removing all of the letters, and replacing them with their appropriate numerical counterparts. These numerical alternatives (based on IBM&#x27;s EBCDIC) are in the following chart. &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, and &quot;Q&quot; are not allowed in a valid VIN; for this chart, they have been filled in with &quot;N/A&quot; (&quot;not applicable&quot;). Numerical digits use their own values.

&quot;S&quot; is 2, and not 1. There is no left-alignment linearity.

===Weights used in calculation===
The following is the weight factor for each position in the VIN. The 9th position is that of the check digit. It has been substituted with a 0, which will cancel it out in the multiplication step.

===Worked example===
Consider the hypothetical VIN , where the underscore will be the check digit.

# The VIN&#x27;s value is calculated from the above transliteration table. This number is used in the rest of the calculation.
# Copy the &quot;weights&quot; from the weight factor row above.
# The &quot;products&quot; row is the result of the multiplication of the columns in the &quot;Value&quot; and &quot;Weight&quot; rows.
# The products (8, 28, 48, 35 ... 24, 16) are all added together to yield a sum, &quot;351&quot;.
# Find the remainder after dividing by 11
# The remainder is the check digit. If the remainder is 10, the check digit is X. In this example, the remainder is 10, so the check digit is transliterated as &quot;X&quot;.

With a check digit of &quot;X&quot;, the VIN is written .

A VIN with &quot;straight-ones&quot; (seventeen consecutive &quot;1&quot;s) has the nice feature that its check digit &quot;1&quot; matches the calculated value &quot;1&quot;. This is because a value of one multiplied by 89 (sum of weights) is 89, and 89 divided by 11 is 8 with remainder ; thus 1 is the check digit. This is a way to test a VIN-check algorithm.

==VIN scanning==
The VIN is marked in multiple locations: normally in the lower corner of the windshield on the driver&#x27;s side, under the bonnet next to the latch, at the front end of the vehicle frame, and inside the door pillar on the driver&#x27;s side. On newer vehicles VINs may be optically read with barcode scanners or digital cameras, or digitally read via OBD-II. There are smartphone applications that can pass the VIN to websites to decode the VIN.

==List of common WMI==
The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) assigns the WMI (world manufacturer identifier) to countries and manufacturers. The following list shows a selection of world manufacturer codes.

<text>Conrad Lafcadio Hall, (June 21, 1926 – January 4, 2003) was a French Polynesian-born American cinematographer. Named after writers Joseph Conrad and Lafcadio Hearn, he became widely prominent as a cinematographer earning numerous accolades including three Academy Awards (with ten nominations), three BAFTA Awards and five American Society of Cinematographers Awards.

Hall won three Academy Awards for Best Cinematography for his work on &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (1969), &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999), and &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; (2002). He was also Oscar-nominated for &quot;Morituri&quot; (1965), &quot;The Professionals&quot; (1966), &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; (1967), &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; (1975), &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; (1988), &quot;Searching for Bobby Fischer&quot; (1993), and &quot;A Civil Action&quot; (1998). He is also known for &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; (1967), &quot;Fat City&quot; (1972), and &quot;Marathon Man&quot; (1976).

In 2003, Hall was judged to be one of history&#x27;s ten most influential cinematographers in a survey of the members of the International Cinematographers Guild. He has been given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

== Early life and education ==

Conrad L Hall was born on June 21, 1926, in Papeete, Tahiti, French Polynesia. His father was James Norman Hall, an ace pilot and captain in the Lafayette Escadrille that fought for France in World War I. James also co-wrote the 1932 novel &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty.&quot; His mother was Sarah (&quot;Lala&quot;) Winchester Hall, who was half Polynesian. Growing up during the relative infancy of cinema, Hall never was around cameras, and the idea of going to the movies was a foreign concept. In his early-mid teens, Hall attended Cate School, a boarding preparatory school near Santa Barbara, California.

After graduating, Hall was told by his father to find his path in life. Hall attended the University of Southern California, intending to study journalism, but ended up doing poorly and instead went to USC&#x27;s School of Cinema-Television (now the USC School of Cinematic Arts). He wasn&#x27;t sure this was the right decision, but that since this was a new art form it would be interesting to start from the bottom. Hall attended the School of Cinema at a time when Slavko Vorkapić was the head of the program; Hall later recalled that “He taught me that film-making was a new visual language. He taught the principles, and left the rest up to us”. After creating his first shots in school he fell in love with the art and wanted to continue telling his stories through imagery. A few people that visited the school during his education included John Huston and Orson Welles. After graduation in 1949, Hall expected to get a job right out of college. At the time, however, Hollywood only allowed the camera crew to be filled with people that were on the International Photographers Guild roster.

==Career==
=== 1949–1966 ===
After graduation Hall collaborated with his classmates, Marvin R. Weinstein and Jack C. Couffer, to create Canyon Films in 1949. In the beginning they made advertising commercials and documentaries and did pickup shots for features. In 1956 Canyon Films acquired a short film, &quot;My Brother Down There,&quot; which allowed Hall to enter into the cameraman position and become part of the International Photographers Guild. However, the Guild made Canyon Films hire an established Guild Cameraman for &quot;My Brother Down There&quot;, denying Hall credit, even though he shot the entire film. Instead he was credited as the visual consultant, after United Artists released the film under the new title &quot;Running Target&quot;.

Once &quot;Running Target&quot; was finished Canyon Films dissolved, and its members went off on their own paths. Since Hall was part of the Guild, he was able to work as an assistant cameraman at the side of many influential cinematographers such as Hall Mohr, Ernie Haller, Burnie Guffey and Ted McCord, who were all part of the ASC. Following a year of working as an assistant cameraman, he was awarded the chance to be the camera operator on the television series &quot;Stoney Burke&quot;. In 1963, he began filming another television series called &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;. Then, in 1964, he shot his first feature-length black and white film, &quot;Wild Seed&quot;, which was made in roughly 24 days with producer Albert S. Ruddy.

Hall&#x27;s breakthrough came with &quot;Morituri&quot; in 1965, for which he received his first Oscar nomination. In the following year Hall shot &quot;Incubus&quot;, &quot;The Professionals,&quot; and &quot;Harper&quot;, which was his first color film. His first collaboration with director Richard Brooks on &quot;The Professionals&quot; was put in motion by assistant director Tom Shaw, who worked with Hall on &quot;Wild Seed&quot; and recommended him to Brooks; the work resulted in his second Oscar nomination.

=== 1967–1976 ===
Their second collaboration, 1967&#x27;s &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, resulted in yet another Oscar nomination. It is notable for the documentary feel and location shots, which were rare at the time. In that same year, Hall shot &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; and &quot;Divorce American Style&quot;. &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; is known for being shot in Panavision, which contributed to its lush color palette. In 1968, Hall filmed &quot;Hell in the Pacific&quot; for director John Boorman, which was not a box-office success but has since become a cult classic.

In 1969, Hall received his first Oscar for &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;. To make &quot;Butch Cassidy&quot; visually compatible with the time period, he used experimental techniques, such as overexposing the negatives in order to mute the primary colors when printing it back (Hunter, 2003). The result was considered an innovative success. He made two other films that year, &quot;The Happy Ending&quot; and &quot;Tell them Willie Boy is Here.&quot; In 1972, Hall shot &quot;Fat City,&quot; with director John Huston. &quot;Fat City&quot; was known for its grainy texture to reflect the harsh reality of the storyline. In 1973 he shot the police thriller &quot;Electra Glide in Blue&quot;, followed by &quot;Smile&quot; and &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; in 1975, the latter of which earned him his fifth Oscar nomination. In 1976 he shot &quot;Marathon Man&quot; with director John Schlesinger which was one of the first to use the Steadicam technique (although it was not the first to be released).

=== 1987–2002 ===
After shooting 18 films in 12 years, Hall took an 11-year break. Around the same time he teamed up with noted cinematographer Haskell Wexler to make a commercial production company (Vinson, 1987). This allowed him to not only be the cameraman on his own work, but also the director. The break for him was about understanding and learning from others about their unique techniques. As Hall stated: &quot;At heart I am more than a cinematographer. I&#x27;m a filmmaker.&quot; This led to his exploration of writing, such as an adaptation of the novel &quot;The Wild Palms&quot;.

Hall returned to the film industry in 1987 to shoot &quot;Black Widow&quot;. In 1988, Hall became part of the union crew for &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; after a few complications. His work resulted in a sixth Oscar nomination. Also in 1988, the ASC gave Hall an outstanding achievement award. After his work on &quot;Tequila Sunrise,&quot; he picked up his old pace, making &quot;Class Action&quot; (1991), &quot;Jennifer 8&quot; (1992), &quot;Searching for Bobby Fischer&quot; (1993) and &quot;Love Affair&quot; (1994) one after the other. &quot;Searching for Bobby Fischer&quot; received an Oscar nomination for cinematography, his seventh.

In 1994, Hall was honored with the lifetime achievement award from the American Society of Cinematographers. In 1998, he shot &quot;Without Limits&quot; and was Oscar nominated for &quot;A Civil Action&quot;, followed by his second win for &quot;American Beauty&quot; in 1999. &quot;American Beauty&quot;, his first collaboration with director Sam Mendes, highlighted his &quot;unique use of the hand-held camera to capture the film&#x27;s heightened reality and almost dream-like atmosphere&quot;. His final film was &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; in 2002, a second collaboration with Mendes, for which he was posthumously awarded another Academy Award. In total, he won three Oscars throughout his 50-year career.

==Personal life==
Hall married Virginia Schwartz in 1952. They had three children, Conrad W. Hall, Kate Hall-Feist and Naia Hall-West, before they divorced in 1969. Hall met actress Katharine Ross on the set of &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; and became her third of five husbands in 1969. Hall and Ross separated in 1973, finalizing their divorce in 1975 so that she could marry her fourth husband. His third marriage was to costume designer Susan Kowarsh-Hall, whom he worked with on &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; (2002), from an unknown date until his death.

==Death==
Hall died from bladder cancer at Santa Monica Hospital on January 4, 2003, at the age of 76. His Oscar for &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; (2002), which is dedicated to Hall, was posthumously accepted by his son Conrad W. Hall, also a cinematographer.

Hall was and still is affectionately referred to as &quot;Connie&quot; by his peers and associates.

The person authorizing the other to act is the &quot;principal&quot;, &quot;grantor&quot;, or &quot;donor&quot; (of the power). The one authorized to act is the &quot;agent&quot;, attorney, or in some common law jurisdictions, the attorney-in-fact.

Formerly, the term &quot;power&quot; referred to an instrument signed under seal while a &quot;letter&quot; was an instrument under hand, meaning that it was simply signed by the parties, but today a power of attorney does not need to be signed under seal. Some jurisdictions require that powers of attorney be notarized or witnessed, but others will enforce a power of attorney as long as it is signed by the grantor.

==Attorney-in-fact==
The term &quot;attorney-in-fact&quot; is used in many jurisdictions instead of the term &quot;agent&quot;. That term should be distinguished from the term &quot;attorney-at-law&quot;. In the United States, an attorney-at-law is a solicitor who is also licensed to be an advocate in a particular jurisdiction. An attorney-in-fact may be a layperson and is authorized to act pursuant to the powers granted by a power of attorney but may not engage in acts that would constitute the unauthorized practice of law.

In the context of the unincorporated reciprocal inter-insurance exchange (URIE) the attorney-in-fact is a stakeholder/trustee who takes custody of the subscriber funds placed on deposit with him, and then uses those funds to pay insurance claims. When all the claims are paid, the attorney-in-fact then returns the leftover funds to the subscribers.

The Uniform Power of Attorney Act employs the term &quot;agent&quot;. As an agent, an attorney-in-fact is a fiduciary for the principal, so the law requires an attorney-in-fact to be completely honest with and loyal to the principal in their dealings with each other.

An attorney has power to act on behalf of the person; this power can be misused, for example, to steal the assets of a person who may be vulnerable (e.g. elder abuse) or absent.

==Structure and requirements==

===Capacity of the grantor===

A person, known as the grantor or donor in different jurisdictions, can only create a power of attorney if they have the requisite mental capacity. In some powers of attorney the grantor states that they wish the document to remain in effect even after they become incapacitated, creating a durable or lasting power of attorney. If someone is already incapacitated, it is not possible for that person to execute a valid power, although in some jurisdictions, it may be possible for someone to have the capacity to execute a power of attorney even if they do not have the capacity to make the decisions that they are delegating. If a person without a durable power in place does not have the capacity to execute a power of attorney, the only way for another party to act on their behalf may be to have a court impose a conservatorship or a guardianship.

===Oral and written===
Depending on the jurisdiction, a power of attorney may be oral and, whether witnessed, will hold up in court, the same as if it were in writing. For some purposes, the law requires a power of attorney to be in writing. Many institutions, such as hospitals, banks and, in the United States, the Internal Revenue Service, require a power of attorney to be in writing before they will honor it, and they will usually keep a duplicate original or a copy for their records. Nursing homes often follow the same practice.

===Equal dignity rule===
The equal dignity rule is a principle of law that requires an authorization for someone performing certain acts for another person to have been appointed with the same formality as required for the act the representative is going to perform. This means, for example, that if a principal authorizes someone to sell the principal&#x27;s house or other real property, and the law requires a contract for the sale of real property to be in writing (which is required under the Statute of Frauds in most U.S. jurisdictions), then the authorization for the other person to sign the sales contract and deed must be in writing too. Likewise, in common-law jurisdictions other than the U.S., a power of an attorney to execute a deed (i.e. instrument under seal or executed in presence of two witnesses) must be itself executed as a deed.

===Execution===
For a power of attorney to become a legally enforceable document, at a minimum it must be signed and dated by the principal. Some jurisdictions also require that a power of attorney be witnessed, notarized, or both. Even when not required, having the document reviewed and signed (and often stamped) by a notary public may increase the likelihood of withstanding a legal challenge.

If the attorney-in-fact is being paid to act on behalf of the principal, a contract for payment may be separate from the document granting power of attorney. If that separate contract is in writing, as a separate document it may be kept private between the principal and agent even when the power of attorney is presented to others for the purposes of carrying out the agent&#x27;s duties.

==Types== 
A power of attorney may be: &quot;special&quot; (also called &quot;limited&quot;), &quot;general&quot;, or &quot;temporary&quot;. A special power of attorney is one that is limited to a specified act or type of act. A general power of attorney is one that allows the agent to make all personal and business decisions A temporary power of attorney is one with a limited time frame. If ever required, a durable power of attorney can be revoked or changed as long as the principal is still mentally competent to act.

===Durable=== 
Under the common law, a simple power of attorney becomes ineffective if its grantor dies or becomes &quot;incapacitated,&quot; meaning unable to grant such a power, if, for example, because of physical injury or mental illness. If the grantor (or principal) specifies that the power of attorney will continue to be effective (endure) even if the grantor becomes incapacitated, this type of power of attorney is called &quot;power of attorney with durable provisions&quot; in the United States or &quot;enduring power of attorney&quot;, &quot;lasting&quot; or &quot;continuing&quot; power of attorney elsewhere. In effect, under a durable power of attorney, the authority of the attorney-in-fact to act and/or make decisions on behalf of the grantor continues until the grantor&#x27;s death.

===Health care===
In some jurisdictions, a durable power of attorney can also be a &quot;health care power of attorney.&quot; This particular affidavit gives the attorney-in-fact the authority to make health-care decisions for the grantor, up to and including terminating care and life support. The grantor can typically modify or restrict the powers of the agent to make end-of-life decisions. In many jurisdictions a health care power of attorney is also referred to as a &quot;health care proxy&quot; and, as such, the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably.

====Relationship with advance health care directive====
Related to the health care power of attorney is a separate document known as an advance health care directive, also called a &quot;living will&quot;. A living will is a written statement of a person&#x27;s health care and medical wishes but does not appoint another person to make health care decisions. Depending upon the jurisdiction, a health care power of attorney may or may not appear with an advance health care directive in a single, physical document. For example, the California legislature has adopted a standard power of attorney for health care and advance health care directive form that meets all of that state&#x27;s legal wording requirements for a power of attorney and advance health care directive in a single document. By comparison, New York enacted a Health Care Proxy law that requires a separate document to appoint someone as one&#x27;s health care agent.

===Springing===
In some U.S. states and other jurisdictions, it is possible to grant a &quot;springing power of attorney&quot;; i.e., a power that takes effect only after the incapacity of the grantor or some other definite future act or circumstance. After such incapacitation the power is identical to a durable power, but cannot be invoked before the incapacity. This power may be used to allow a spouse or family member to manage the grantor&#x27;s affairs in case illness or injury makes the grantor unable to act. If a &quot;springing&quot; power is used, the grantor should specify exactly how and when the power &quot;springs&quot; into effect. As the result of privacy legislation in the U.S., medical doctors will often not reveal information relating to capacity of the principal unless the power of attorney specifically authorizes them to do so.

Determining whether the principal is &quot;disabled&quot; enough to initiate this type of representation is a formal process. Springing powers of attorney are not automatic, and institutions may refuse to work with the attorney-in-fact. Disputes are then resolved in court.

Unless the power of attorney has been made irrevocable by its own terms or by some legal principle, the grantor may revoke the power of attorney by telling the attorney-in-fact it is revoked. However, if the principal does not inform third parties and it is reasonable for the third parties to rely upon the power of attorney being in force, the principal might still be bound by the acts of the agent, though the agent may also be liable for such unauthorized acts.

===Standardized forms===
Standardized forms are available for various kinds of powers of attorney, and many organizations provide them for their clients, customers, patients, employees, or members. However, the grantor should exercise caution when using a standardized POA form obtained from a source other than a lawyer because there is considerable variation in approved formats among the states. In some jurisdictions statutory power of attorney forms are available.

==Implied limitations on agent&#x27;s power==
Although a power of attorney grants the agent powers to perform acts in the absence of the grantor, the POA cannot grant powers to the agent that conflict with rules and regulations governing people and companies that the agent deals with. For example, if a bank has regulations that require the grantor to be physically present in the bank to perform certain actions, the POA cannot grant the agent power to perform those actions in the absence of the grantor.

==Specialized uses==

===Proxy voting===
&quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; notes that proxy voting involves granting a power of attorney. The term &quot;proxy&quot; refers to both the power of attorney itself and the person to whom it is granted.

===Finance===
In financial situations wherein a principal requests a securities broker to perform extensive investment functions on the principal&#x27;s behalf, independent of the principal&#x27;s advice, power of attorney must be formally granted to the broker to trade in the principal&#x27;s account. This rule also applies to principals who instruct their brokers to perform certain specific trades and principals who trust their brokers to perform certain trades in the principal&#x27;s best interest.

==Legal status by country==
=== Australia ===
In Australia, anyone with capacity can grant a power of attorney. This can be done either for a pre-defined period of time, or in perpetuity (&quot;enduring&quot;). The power of attorney can be granted to one individual, or to multiple individuals. When granted to multiple individuals, they may be authorised either to act jointly (all together) or to act severally (each can act individually).

=== Canada ===
In Canada, there are generally two types of Power of Attorney:
* Power of Attorney for Property: Allows the appointed attorney to make financial and property decisions on behalf of the grantor, such as managing bank accounts, selling property, and paying bills.
* Power of Attorney for Personal Care: Allows the appointed attorney to make decisions related to the grantor&#x27;s health care and personal well-being, such as choosing a place of residence, and making decisions about medical treatment.

It is also possible to have a Combined Power of attorney which allows both the personal care and property management decisions to be taken by the attorney.
The laws and regulations for Power of attorney vary by province or territory and the specific requirements for each type of Power of attorney may vary.

==== Ontario ====
In Ontario, a Power of Attorney for Property allows a person (the &quot;grantor&quot;) to appoint another person (the &quot;attorney&quot;) to make financial and property decisions on their behalf. This Power of Attorney for Property includes a Continuing Power of Attorney for Property (CPOA), and a non-continuing Power of Attorney. The attorney&#x27;s authority can be limited or broad, and can take effect immediately or only in certain circumstances (such as the grantor becoming mentally incapable). The grantor can also revoke or cancel the Power of Attorney at any time while they still have capacity.

One can make a power of attorney document oneself for free using a web tool created by Community Legal Education Ontario or have a lawyer do it. It is important to note that the Power of Attorney must be in writing, signed by the grantor, and witnessed by someone other than the attorney.

If one doesn’t make a Power of Attorney, the government will not automatically step in if one can’t manage own affairs. In these circumstances a family member has the right to make your health care decisions or apply to become your “guardian” of property. Alternatively, someone else – such as a close friend - could apply to make decisions for you in these matters. The government, through the Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee (OPGT), acts only in situations where it is legally required and where no other suitable person is available, able and willing.

===England and Wales===

In English law, applying in England and Wales, anyone with capacity can grant a power of attorney. These can be general (i.e. to do anything which can legally be done by the donor in relation to their money or assets), or can relate to a specific act only (e.g. to sell freehold property), and are governed by the Powers of Attorney Act 1971. An ordinary power of attorney is only valid for so long as the donor has the mental capacity to ratify the attorney&#x27;s actions.

There are also powers of attorney for trustees, governed by section 25 of the Trustee Act 1925.

If the donor become incapacitated a normal power of attorney can no longer be used. To provide for such cases a lasting power of attorney must be created. This is a separate and quite different type of power, which must be in a prescribed form, signed and witnessed in a prescribed order, and registered with the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG). This type of power of attorney was introduced in 2007 under the Mental Capacity Act 2005. It replaces the former enduring power of attorney, although enduring powers correctly made before the law changed remain valid. Enduring powers were very different, as they only needed to be registered if the donor later lost capacity.

The OPG provides an online process for registering a lasting power of attorney.

Many of the provisions in American law, described in the sections above, use terminology having different meaning from both common British usage and from the terms used in the Mental Capacity Act 2005. Examples are &#x27;enduring power of attorney&#x27;, &#x27;advance directive&#x27;, and &#x27;notary public&#x27;: in English law, these terms do not have the same meaning as they have in America.

====Exceptional situations====
During the coronavirus pandemic that started in 2019, England and Wales permitted documents such as wills to be witnessed via video link; however, a power of attorney still had to be signed by hand by all persons involved, in the right order, and witnessed directly, although possibly through a window or outdoors.

===Ireland===
In Irish law there are two types of power of attorney:
*Power of attorney, which may be general or specific, which ceases once the donor becomes mentally incapacitated. This type is virtually identical to an ordinary 1971 Act power of attorney in England and Wales.
*Enduring power of attorney, which takes effect once the donor is incapacitated
The death of the donor ends both.

The relevant legislation is the Powers of Attorney Act 1996 and the Enduring Powers of Attorney Regulations 1996 (SI No. 196/1996) as amended by SI No. 287/1996. Part 7 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides for new arrangements for those who wish to make an Enduring Power of Attorney and once the 2015 Act is brought into force, no new powers of attorney will be created under the 1996 Act.

====Creating powers of attorney====
A solicitor is not required to create a Power of Attorney - it is created simply by being signed by the donor, in the presence of (and countersigned by) a witness.

Creating an Enduring Power of Attorney requires the following:
*it must be in a particular format
*a statement from a doctor stating that the doctor thought the donor had the mental capacity to understand the effect of creating the power of attorney when the document was executed
*a statement from the donor to say that they understood the effect of creating the power
*a statement from a solicitor to say they are satisfied that the donor understood the effect of creating the power of attorney
*a statement from a solicitor to say the donor was not acting under undue influence

The courts play a general supervisory role in the implementation of the power.

===Russia===
Under Russian law, in article 185 of the Russian Civil Code, a power of attorney can be created by being signed by the donor. Creation of the power of attorney must be witnessed, e.g. countersigned by a public notary. Notarial witnessing is mandatory if the power of attorney is made in order to enter into a contract to buy or sell an interest in land, as this has to be done on a public register.

A power of attorney must also be dated, pursuant to article 186 of the Russian Civil Code. Any POA without an express date of execution is void.

A power of attorney cannot be irrevocable. The grantor may terminate the POA at any time, at his or her sole discretion. Any waiver of this right is void, as provided by the Civil Code.

See &quot;Doverennost&quot; 

===Scotland===
The law in Scotland is broadly similar to that of England and Wales.

Scottish practice differs from England in one respect. In Scotland, the Office of the Public Guardian offers eAttorney, the Electronic Power of Attorney (EPOAR) system, for the submission and payment of a power of attorney registration.

<doc id="166139" wikidata="Q6731485" url="?curid=166139" title="Magnetic North (Hopesfall album)">
<text>Magnetic North is the fourth full-length album released by the hardcore band Hopesfall. Josh Brigham, one of the guitarists and the only founding member remaining during the recording of the album, has said: &quot;Our music has always been spacey and heavy, and we use those roots, combined with our love of grunge-era Smashing Pumpkins, Dinosaur Jr., HUM, and Pixies, we add some bigger, heavier riffs.

&quot;We all admire bands that can morph and change with each album, and that is what we try to do. Expect change and progression, in both songwriting and overall style, on the new album.&quot;

During the period before this album&#x27;s release, the band released a new song from the album on their MySpace page each week for the ten weeks prior to the release date.

&quot;Bird Flu&quot; was previously released on the compilation album &quot;Trustkill Takeover Vol. 2&quot;.

In February 2017, the album was released as a 2-LP vinyl set through Equal Vision Records, and included &quot;Saskatchewan&quot; and an untitled demo as bonus tracks.

==Track listing==


== Unreleased tracks ==
The track &quot;Saskatchewan&quot; was originally intended for inclusion on &quot;Magnetic North&quot;, following the album&#x27;s title track, but was cut from all releases without the band consenting. When the band found out the CDs and artwork had already been manufactured.&lt;ref name=&quot;.hopesfall w/ Jay Interview - Thrash Magazine&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Trustkill Records president Josh Grabelle claims that the label reached out to the band&#x27;s management about cutting the album down by one or two tracks but Hopesfall&#x27;s management either failed to communicate this to the band or simply ignored the request entirely. The label had no choice but to pick a song to remove in order to meet deadlines for an international release. Other bonus tracks may have been planned but were not included.

&quot;We&#x27;re working on some interesting things still, with bonus tracks and such for the releases in Europe and Japan. We&#x27;re talking about some re-mixes too. We scrapped a couple of songs on the record, so maybe we&#x27;ll work on those, too. Be on the lookout.&quot;

<doc id="166141" wikidata="Q369820" url="?curid=166141" title="Music of Africa">
<text>Given the vastness of the African continent, its music is diverse, with regions and nations having many distinct musical traditions. African music includes the genres makwaya, highlife, mbube, township music, jùjú, fuji, jaiva, afrobeat, afrofusion, mbalax, Congolese rumba, soukous, ndombolo, makossa, kizomba, taarab and others. African music also uses a large variety of instruments from all across the continent. The music and dance of the African diaspora, formed to varying degrees on African musical traditions, include American music like Dixieland jazz, blues, jazz, and many Caribbean genres, such as calypso (see kaiso) and soca. Latin American music genres such as cumbia, salsa music, son cubano, rumba, conga, bomba, samba and zouk were founded on the music of enslaved Africans, and have in turn influenced African popular music.

Like the music of Asia, India and the Middle East, it is a highly rhythmic music. The complex rhythmic patterns often involve one rhythm played against another to create a polyrhythm. The most common polyrhythm plays three beats on top of two, like a triplet played against straight notes. Sub-Saharan African music traditions frequently rely on percussion instruments of many varieties, including xylophones, djembes, drums, and tone-producing instruments such as the mbira or &quot;thumb piano.&quot;

Another distinguishing form of African music is its call-and-response style: one voice or instrument plays a short melodic phrase, and that phrase is echoed by another voice or instrument. The call-and-response nature extends to the rhythm, where one drum will play a rhythmic pattern, echoed by another drum playing the same pattern. African music is also highly improvised. A core rhythmic pattern is typically played, with drummers then improvising new patterns over the static original patterns.

Traditional music in most of the continent is passed down through oral tradition. There are subtle differences in pitch and intonation that do not easily translate to Western notation. African music most closely adheres to Western tetratonic (four-note), pentatonic (five-note), hexatonic (six-note), and heptatonic (seven-note) scales. Harmonization of the melody is accomplished by singing in parallel thirds, fourths, or fifths.

Music is an integral part of communal life in Africa. African music is made for both public enjoyment and public participation, and it is this social bonding over music that informed Christopher Small&#x27;s idea of &quot;musicking&quot;. In Africa, music is used as an avenue for social commentary and moralism. Types include work songs, love songs, lullabies, boasting songs, praise songs, narrative songs, and satirical songs. Music is also important to religion, where rituals and religious ceremonies use music to pass down stories from generation to generation as well as to sing and dance to. 

== Music by regions ==
=== North Africa and the Horn of Africa ===
North Africa is the seat of ancient Egypt and Carthage, civilizations with strong ties to the ancient Near East and which influenced the ancient Greek and Roman cultures. Eventually, Egypt fell under Persian rule followed by Greek and Roman rule, while Carthage was later ruled by Romans and Vandals. North Africa was later conquered by the Arabs, who established the region as the Maghreb of the Ar Africa &quot;(sky-blue and dark green region on map)&quot;, its music has close ties with Middle Eastern music and utilizes similar melodic modes (&quot;maqamat&quot;). North African music has a considerable range, from the music of ancient Egypt to the Berber and the Tuareg music of the desert nomads. The region&#x27;s art music has for centuries followed the outline of Arabic and Andalusian classical music: its popular contemporary genres include the Algerian Raï.

With these may be grouped the music of Sudan and of the Horn of Africa, including the music of Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Somalia. Somali music is typically pentatonic, using five pitches per octave in contrast to a heptatonic (seven note) scale such as the major scale. The music of the Ethiopian highlands uses a fundamental modal system called &quot;qenet&quot;, of which there are four main modes: &quot;tezeta&quot;, &quot;bati&quot;, &quot;ambassel&quot;, and &quot;anchihoy&quot;. Three additional modes are variations on the above: tezeta minor, bati major, and bati minor. Some songs take the name of their qenet, such as tizita, a song of reminiscence.
=== West, Central, Southeast and South Africa ===

The ethnomusicological pioneer Arthur Morris Jones (1889–1980) observed that the shared rhythmic principles of Bantu African music traditions constitute &quot;one main system&quot;. Similarly, master drummer and scholar C. K. Ladzekpo affirms the &quot;profound homogeneity&quot; of Bantu African rhythmic principles.

African traditional music is frequently functional in nature. Performances may be long and often involve the participation of the audience. There are, for example, specialized work songs, songs accompanying childbirth, marriage, hunting and political activities, music to ward off evil spirits and to pay respects to good spirits, the dead and the ancestors. None of this is performed outside its intended social context and much of it is associated with a particular dance. Some of it, performed by professional musicians, is sacral music or ceremonial and courtly music performed at royal courts.

Musicologically, Sub-Saharan Africa may be divided into four regions:
* The eastern region &quot;(light green regions on map)&quot; includes the music of Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe as well as the islands of Madagascar, the Seychelles, Mauritius, Music of Somalia (which can also be considered to be in East Africa) and Comor. Many of these have been influenced by Arabic music and also by the music of India, Indonesia and Polynesia, though the region&#x27;s indigenous musical traditions are primarily in the mainstream of the Bantu/Niger–Congo-speaking peoples.
* The southern region &quot;(brown region on map)&quot; includes the music of South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Botswana, Namibia and Angola.
* The central region &quot;(dark blue region on map)&quot; includes the music of Chad, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia, including Pygmy music.
* West African music &quot;(yellow region on map)&quot; includes the music of Senegal and the Gambia, of Guinea and Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone and Liberia, of the inland plains of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, the coastal nations of Cote d&#x27;Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon and the Republic of the Congo as well as islands such as Sao Tome and Principe.

Southern, Central and West Africa are similarly in the broad Sub-Saharan musical tradition. They also have several ancillary influences, from the Muslim regions of Africa, and in modern times, the Americas and Western Europe.

Afrobeat, juju, fuji, highlife, makossa, and kizomba are performed in West Africa. West African music has regional variations, with Muslim regions incorporating elements of Islamic music and non-Muslim regions more influenced by indigenous traditions, according to the historian Sylviane Diouf and ethnomusicologist Gerhard Kubik. According to Diouf, traditional Muslim West African Music incorporates elements of the Islamic call to prayer (originating from Bilal ibn Rabah, an Abyssinian African Muslim in the early 7th century), including lyrics praising God, melody, note changes, &quot;words that seem to quiver and shake&quot; in the vocal chords, dramatic changes in musical scales, and nasal intonation. According to Kubik, the vocal style of Muslim West African singers &quot;using melisma, wavy intonation, and so forth is a heritage of that large region of West Africa that had been in contact with the Arabic-Islamic world of the Maghreb since the seventh and eighth centuries.&quot; In terms of instrumentation, Kubik notes that stringed instruments (including ancestors of the banjo) were traditionally favored by Muslim West Africans, while drumming was traditionally favored by non-Muslim West Africans.
== Musical instruments ==
Besides vocalisation, which uses various techniques such as complex hard melisma and yodel, a wide array of musical instruments are also used. African musical instruments include a wide range of drums, slit gongs, rattles and double bells, different types of harps, and harp-like instruments such as the kora and the ngoni, as well as fiddles, many kinds of xylophone and lamellophone such as the mbira, and different types of wind instrument like flutes and trumpets. Additionally, string instruments are also used, with the lute-like oud and Ngoni serving as musical accompaniment in some areas.

There are five groups of Sub-Saharan African musical instruments: membranophones, chordophones, aerophones, idiophones, and percussion. Membranophones are the drums, including kettles, clay pots, and barrels. Chordophones are stringed instruments like harps and fiddles. Aerophones are another name for wind instruments. These can include flutes and trumpets, similar to the instruments one hears in American music. In Northern Nigeria, Niger Republic and Northern Cameroon, Algaita-a double reed instrument is very common for festive events and seasons.

Idiophones are rattles and shakers, while percussion can be sounds like foot-stomping and hand-clapping. Many of the wooden instruments have shapes or pictures carved out into them to represent ancestry. Some are decorated with feathers or beads.

Drums used in African traditional music include talking drums, bougarabou and djembe in West Africa, water drums in Central and West Africa, and the different types of ngoma drums (or engoma) in Central and Southern Africa. Other percussion instruments include many rattles and shakers, such as the kosika (kashaka), rain stick, bells and wood sticks. Also, Africa has many other types of drums, and many flutes and stringed and wind instruments.

The playing of polyrhythms is one of the most universal characteristics of Sub-Saharan music, in contrast to polyphony in Western music. Several uniquely designed instruments have evolved there over time to facilitate the playing of simultaneous contrasting rhythms. The mbira, kalimba, Kora, ngoni and dousn&#x27;gouni are examples of these instruments which organize notes not in the usual single linear order from bass to treble, but in two separated rank arrays which allows additional ease in playing cross rhythms. The continuing influence of this principle can be seen in the 20th century American instruments the gravi-kora and gravikord which are new modern examples.

== Relationship to language ==
Many languages spoken in Africa are tonal languages, leading to a close connection between music and language in some local cultures. These particular communities use vocal sounds and movements with their music as well. In singing, the tonal pattern or the text puts some constraints on the melodic patterns. On the other hand, in instrumental music a native speaker of a language can often perceive a text or texts in the music. This effect also forms the basis of drum languages (talking drums).

== Influences on African music ==
Historically, several factors have influenced the traditional music of Africa. The music has been influenced by language, the environment, a variety of cultures, politics, and population movement, all of which are intermingled. Each African group evolved in a different area of the continent, which means that they ate different foods, faced different weather conditions, and came in contact with different groups than other societies did. Each group moved at different rates and to different places than others, and thus each was influenced by different people and circumstances. Furthermore, each society did not necessarily operate under the same government, which also significantly influenced their music styles.

== Influence on North American music ==
African music has been a major factor in the shaping of what we know today as Dixieland, the blues, and jazz. These styles have all borrowed from African rhythms and sounds, brought over the Atlantic Ocean by enslaved Africans. African music in Sub-Saharan Africa is mostly upbeat polyrhythmic and joyful, whereas the blues should be viewed as an aesthetic development resulting from the conditions of slavery in the new world. The blues has likely evolved as a fusion of an African blue note scale with European twelve tone musical instruments. The musical traditions of the Irish and Scottish settlers merged with African-American musical elements to become old-time and bluegrass, among other genres.

On his album &quot;Graceland&quot;, the American folk musician Paul Simon employs South African bands, rhythms and melodies as a musical backdrop for his own lyrics; especially Miriam Makeba, Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Ray Phiri. In the early 1970s, Remi Kabaka, an Afro-rock avant-garde drummer, laid the initial drum patterns that created the Afro-rock sounds in bands such as Ginger Baker&#x27;s Airforce, The Rolling Stones, and Steve Winwood&#x27;s Traffic. He continued to work with Winwood, Paul McCartney, and Mick Jagger throughout the decade.

Certain Sub-Saharan African musical traditions also had a significant influence on such works as Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Lion King&quot; and &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot;, which blend traditional African music with Western music. Songs such as &quot;&quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; &quot;Circle of Life&quot; and &quot;He Lives in You&quot;&quot; combine Zulu and English lyrics, as well as traditional African styles of music such as South African isicathamiya and mbube with more modern western styles. Additionally, the Disney film incorporates numerous words from the Bantu Swahili language. The phrase &quot;hakuna matata&quot;, for example, is an actual Swahili phrase that does in fact mean &quot;no worries&quot;. Characters such as Simba, Kovu, and Zira are also Swahili words, meaning &quot;lion&quot;, &quot;scar&quot;, and &quot;hate&quot;, respectively.

Miriam Makeba, Hugh Masekela and Babatunde Olatunji were among the earliest African performing artists to develop sizable fan bases in the United States. Non-commercial African-American radio stations promoted African music as part of their cultural and political missions in the 1960s and 1970s. African music also found eager audiences at Historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and appealed particularly to activists in the civil rights and Black Power movements.

== Afropop ==
African popular music commonly referred to as African pop or afro-pop like African traditional music is vast and varied. Most contemporary genres of African popular music build on cross-pollination with western popular music. Many genres of popular music, including blues, jazz and rumba, derive to varying degrees from musical traditions from Africa, taken to the Americas by enslaved Africans. These rhythms and sounds have subsequently been adapted by newer genres like rock, soul music, and rhythm and blues. Similarly, African popular music has adopted elements, particularly the musical instruments and recording studio techniques of western music.

In 1933, Solomon Linda&#x27;s Original Evening Birds vocal group was formed by Solomon Linda. Linda was illiterate however created songs during his childhood whilst guarding cattle. Solomon Linda&#x27;s Original Evening Birds&#x27; most internationally acclaimed hit released in 1939, &quot;&quot;Mbube&quot;&quot; was the first African record to sell over 100,000 copies. One of the most important 20th century singers of South African popular music was Miriam Makeba, who played a key-role, in the 60s, in drawing global audience&#x27;s attention to African music and its meaning. Zenzile Miriam Makeba was said to have been one of the most influential and popular musicians of Africa, beginning in the 1950s. She was a part of three bands, including one all-woman band and two others. She performed all types of jazz music, traditional African music, and music that was popular in Western Africa at the time. Miriam played a majority of her music in the form of &quot;mbube&quot;, which was &quot;a style of vocal harmony which drew on American jazz, ragtime, and Anglican church hymns, as well as indigenous styles of music.&quot; After she moved to the U.S., problems with Makeba&#x27;s passport occurred and she had to stay in America, it was said that she put an American twist on most of her African music. She had a very diverse scale of her vocal range and could hit almost any note. &quot;The Empress of African Music&quot; died at the age of 76.

In West Africa, Fela Kuti and Tony Allen performed Afrobeat music. Femi Kuti and Seun Kuti followed their father Fela Kuti. The Afro-Euro hybrid style, the Cuban son, has had an influence on certain popular music in Africa. Some of the first guitar bands on the continent played covers of Cuban songs. The early guitar-based bands from the Congo called their music &quot;rumba&quot; (although it was son rather than rumba-based). The Congolese style eventually evolved into what became known as soukous. In 1972, Cameroonian songwriter and saxophonist Manu Dibango&#x27;s, internationally innumerably sampled &quot;&quot;Soul Makossa&quot; was released. &quot;Soul Makossa&quot; is the most sampled African record, in history.

The 2010 FIFA World Cup afro-fusion and soca theme-song, &quot;Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)&quot;&quot; featuring Shakira and Freshlyground sampled the makossa presumably soldier-tribute, melody Zamina mina (Zangaléwa) by Golden Sounds.

Kalpop is a music genre that originated in the Klassikan royal communities under Klassik Nation record label. Kalpop is a genre of Klassikan, African, lingual (multicultured), and popular music that originated in its modern form during the mid-1990s in Kenya and later spread to the United States and the United Kingdom. Kalpop music has found a home to a growing fan base and with a number of locally established as well as emerging Kalpop bands (there are over thirteen active local Kalpop bands in Nairobi alone) further cementing this genre by engaging in different as well as mutually organised Kalpop themed events. DON SANTO, Badman Killa, Blessed Paul, Cash B, Jay Nuclear, Rekless, G-Youts (Washu B and Nicki Mulla), Sleek Whizz, Chizei, are among the many artists playing Kalpop music in Kenya.

== Music industry ==
For African artists, concerts were one of the few ways to earn in the industry. Piracy and changing consumer behavior are behind declining sales of records. Enforcement of copyright law remains weak in Africa. MusikBi is the first legal music download website in Africa. It does not offer streaming and is limited by internet speeds in Africa. Some African countries, including Kenya, Gambia and South Africa, have seen protest over perceived excessive airtime given to American music. In Zimbabwe 75% of airtime has to be given to local music. Protective actions have seen the growth of new genres like Urban Grooves emerge in Zimbabwe. In 2016 Sony Music launched in Africa by opening an office in Nigeria. Traditionally services of western major international studios have not been available in Africa, the local demand for their music being met through piracy.

SInce 2014, the festival Visa for Music has been held annually with growing success in Morocco, presenting musical artists with roots in Africa through showcases, music videos and marketing for professionals from the creative industries worldwide.

<text>A philanthropist is someone who engages in philanthropy; donating their time, money, and/or reputation to charitable causes. The term may apply to any volunteer or to anyone who makes a donation, but the label is most often applied to those who donate large sums of money or who make a major impact through their volunteering, such as a trustee who manages a philanthropic organization or one who establishes and funds a foundation.

A philanthropist may not always find universal approval for their deeds. Common accusations include supporting an unworthy cause (such as funding art instead of fighting world hunger) or having selfish motivation at heart (such as avoiding taxes or attaining personal fame). A philanthropist is also someone who cares for someone else&#x27;s needs instead of their own.

<text>Old Faithful is a cone geyser in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, United States. It was named in 1870 during the Washburn–Langford–Doane Expedition and was the first geyser in the park to be named. It is a highly predictable geothermal feature and has erupted every 44 minutes to two hours since 2000. The geyser and the nearby Old Faithful Inn are part of the Old Faithful Historic District.

==History==
In the afternoon of September 18, 1870, the members of the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition traveled down the Firehole River from the Kepler Cascades and entered the Upper Geyser Basin. The first geyser that they saw was Old Faithful. Nathaniel P. Langford wrote in his 1871 Scribner&#x27;s account of the expedition:

In the early days of the park, Old Faithful was often used as a laundry:
==Eruptions==

More than 1,000,000 eruptions have been recorded. Harry Woodward first described a mathematical relationship between the duration and intervals of the eruptions in 1938. Old Faithful is not the tallest or largest geyser in the park; those titles belong to the less predictable Steamboat Geyser. The reliability of Old Faithful can be attributed to the fact that it is not connected to any other thermal features of the Upper Geyser Basin.

Eruptions can shoot of boiling water to a height of lasting from 1½ to 5 minutes. The average height of an eruption is . Intervals between eruptions have ranged from 34 to 125 minutes, averaging 66½ minutes in 1939, slowly increasing to an average of 90 minutes apart since 2000, which may be the result of earthquakes affecting subterranean water levels. The disruptions have made earlier mathematical relationships inaccurate, but have actually made Old Faithful more predictable in terms of its next eruption. After the Borah Peak earthquake in central Idaho in October 1983, the eruption intervals of Old Faithful were noticeably lengthened.
The time between eruptions has a bimodal distribution, with the mean interval being either 65 or 91 minutes, and is dependent on the length of the prior eruption. Within a margin of error of ±10 minutes, Old Faithful will erupt either 65 minutes after an eruption lasting less than 2½ minutes, or 91 minutes after an eruption lasting more than 2½ minutes.

==Measurement==
Between 1983 and 1994, four probes containing temperature and pressure measurement devices and video equipment were lowered into Old Faithful. The probes were lowered as deep as . Temperature measurements of the water at this depth were , the same as was measured in 1942. The video probes were lowered to a maximum depth of to observe the conduit formation and the processes that took place in the conduit. Some of the processes observed include fog formation from the interaction of cool air from above mixing with heated air from below, the recharge processes of water entering into the conduit and expanding from below, and entry of superheated steam measuring as high as into the conduit.

He also wrote songs for over 60 Hollywood films and Tin Pan Alley, many of which have become standards, and was nominated for five Academy Awards for best song, winning once for &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot;.

== Early years ==
Frank Henry Loesser was born to a Jewish family in New York City, the son of Henry Loesser, a pianist, and Julia Ehrlich. He grew up in a house on West 107th Street in Manhattan.

His father had moved to America to avoid German military service and work in his family&#x27;s banking business. He married Bertha Ehrlich; their son, Arthur Loesser, was born on August 26, 1894. Bertha&#x27;s younger sister Julia arrived in America in 1898, marrying Henry in 1907 after Bertha died in childbirth. Grace, their first child, was born in December of that year. Their son Frank was born on June 29, 1910.

Loesser&#x27;s parents, secular German Jews, prized high intellect and culture, and educated him musically in the vein of European composers. But although Henry was a full-time piano teacher, he never taught his son. In a 1914 letter to Arthur, Henry wrote that the four-year-old Frank could play by ear &quot;any tune he&#x27;s heard and can spend an enormous amount of time at the piano.&quot; (Frank Loesser later collaborated with musical secretaries to ensure that his written scores reflected the music as he conceived it.)

Loesser disliked his father&#x27;s refined taste in music and resisted by writing his own music and taking up the harmonica. He was expelled from Townsend Harris High School, and from there went to City College of New York. He was expelled from the CCNY in 1925 after one year for failing every subject except English and gym.

After his father died suddenly on July 20, 1926, Loesser was forced to seek work to support his family. His jobs included restaurant reviewer, process server, classified ad salesman for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, political cartoonist for &quot;The Tuckahoe Record&quot;, sketch writer for Keith Vaudeville Circuit, knit-goods editor for &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot;, press representative for a small movie company, and city editor for a short-lived newspaper in New Rochelle, New York, titled &quot;New Rochelle News&quot;.

== Early career as lyricist ==
Loesser&#x27;s first song credit was &quot;In Love with the Memory of You,&quot; with music by William Schuman, published in 1931. Other early lyrical credits included two hit songs of 1934, &quot;Junk Man&quot; and &quot;I Wish I Were Twins&quot;, both with music by Joe Meyer and the latter with co-lyric credit to Eddie DeLange. &quot;Junk Man&quot; was first recorded that year by Benny Goodman with singer Mildred Bailey on vocals.

In the mid-1930s, he performed at The Back Drop, a night spot on east 52nd Street, along with composer Irving Actman, while by day working on the staff of Leo Feist Inc. writing lyrics to Joseph Brandfon&#x27;s music at $100 per week. After a year, Feist had not published any of them. Loesser fared only slightly better collaborating with the future classical composer Schuman, selling their 1931 song to Feist that would flop. Loesser described his early days of learning the craft as having &quot;a rendezvous with failure.&quot; While he dabbled in other trades, he inevitably returned to the music business.

Loesser&#x27;s work at the Back Drop led to his first Broadway musical, &quot;The Illustrator&#x27;s Show&quot;, a 1936 revue written with Back Drop collaborator Irving Actman, which lasted only four nights. The year before while performing at the Back Drop, Loesser met an aspiring singer, Lynn Garland (born Mary Alice Blankenbaker). He proposed in a September 1936 letter that included funds for a railroad ticket to Los Angeles where Loesser&#x27;s contract to Universal Pictures had just ended. The couple married in a judge&#x27;s office. Loesser was offered a contract by Paramount Pictures. His first song credit there was &quot;Moon of Manakoora&quot;, written with Alfred Newman for Dorothy Lamour in the film &quot;The Hurricane&quot;. He wrote the lyrics for many popular songs during this period, including &quot;Two Sleepy People&quot; and &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; with Hoagy Carmichael and &quot;I Hear Music&quot; with Burton Lane. He also collaborated with composers Arthur Schwartz and Joseph J. Lilley.

One of his notable efforts was &quot;See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have&quot;, with music by Friedrich Hollaender and sung by Marlene Dietrich in &quot;Destry Rides Again.&quot; In 1941, Loesser wrote &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Walk Without You&quot; with Jule Styne, included in the 1942 film &quot;Sweater Girl&quot; and sung by Betty Jane Rhodes. Irving Berlin was a huge fan of the song and once played it repeatedly, telling Loesser why he believed it was the greatest song he wished he&#x27;d written.

Members of the Western Writers of America chose the 1942 song &quot;Jingle Jangle Jingle&quot;, for which Loesser wrote the lyrics, as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.

He stayed in Hollywood until World War II, when he joined the Army Air Force.

== World War II era ==
During World War II, he enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces and continued to write lyrics for films and single songs. Loesser created the popular war song &quot;Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition&quot; (1942) inspired by words of navy chaplain Howell Forgy. Loesser wrote other songs at the request of the armed forces, including &quot;What Do You Do in the Infantry?&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of Rodger Young&quot; (1943). He also wrote &quot;They&#x27;re Either Too Young or Too Old&quot; for the 1943 film &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot;.

In 1944, Loesser worked as the lyricist on the little-known musical &quot;Hi Yank!&quot;, performed by and for U.S. soldiers abroad, with music by Alex North. &quot;Hi Yank!&quot; was produced by the U.S. Army Office of Special Services as a &quot;blueprint special&quot; to boost the morale of soldiers located where USO shows could not visit. The &quot;blueprint&quot; was a book containing a musical script with instructions for staging the show using materials locally available to deployed soldiers. According to a document at the U.S. Army Centre for Military History, a touring company formed in Italy was slated to produce the musical. &quot;Hi Yank!&quot; was generally forgotten until 2008 when the PBS &quot;History Detectives&quot; researched the case of a long-saved radio transcription disc. The disc has two songs and a promotional announcement for the show&#x27;s Fort Dix premiere in August 1944, when the disc was broadcast there.

==Broadway and later film career==

In 1948, Broadway producers Cy Feuer and Ernest H. Martin asked Loesser to write music and lyrics to George Abbott&#x27;s book for an adaptation of the Brandon Thomas play &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot;. The musical, &quot;Where&#x27;s Charley?&quot; (1948), starred Ray Bolger and ran for 792 performances. A film version released in 1952.

Also in 1948, Loesser sold to MGM the rights to &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot;, a song he wrote in 1944 and performed informally at parties with his then wife Lynn Garland. The studio included it in the 1949 movie &quot;Neptune&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, and the song became a huge hit. While Garland was mad at Loesser for selling what she considered &quot;their song&quot;, it won the Academy Award for Best Original Song.

His next musical, &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1950), based on the stories of Damon Runyon, was again produced by Feuer and Martin. &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; became a hit and earned Loesser a Tony Award. Bob Fosse called &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; &quot;the greatest American musical of all time&quot;. A film version was released in 1955, starring Marlon Brando, Jean Simmons, Frank Sinatra, and Vivian Blaine.

In 1950, Loesser started Frank Music Corporation. Initially created as a means of controlling and publishing his work, the company eventually supported other writers, including Richard Adler, Jerry Ross, and Meredith Willson. Loesser also started the theatrical licensing company Music Theatre International in 1952. Frank Music and MTI were sold to CBS Music in 1976. CBS in turn sold Frank Music to Paul McCartney&#x27;s MPL Communications holding company in 1979.

Also in 1952, Loesser wrote the score for the film &quot;Hans Christian Andersen&quot;. The movie&#x27;s songs included &quot;Wonderful Copenhagen&quot;, &quot;Anywhere I Wander&quot;, &quot;Thumbelina&quot;, and &quot;Inchworm&quot;.

He wrote the book, music, and lyrics for his next two musicals, &quot;The Most Happy Fella&quot; (1956) and &quot;Greenwillow&quot; (1960). Around the beginning of 1957, Garland and Loesser divorced, and Loesser began a relationship with Jo Sullivan, who had played the character of Rosabella in &quot;Fella&quot;. He wrote the music and lyrics for &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; (1961), which ran for 1,417 performances, won the 1962 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, and received another Tony and a Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album.

&quot;Pleasures and Palaces&quot; (1965), the last Loesser musical produced during his lifetime, closed during out-of-town tryouts.

==Later life and death==
From 1965 until 1968, Loesser was composing the book, music and lyrics for &quot;Señor Discretion Himself&quot;, a musical version of a Budd Schulberg short story. A version was presented in 1985 at the New York Musical Theatre Works. With the support of his widow Jo Loesser, a completed version was presented at the Arena Stage, Washington, D.C., in 2004, reworked by the group Culture Clash and director Charles Randolph-Wright.

When he was asked why he did not write more shows, Loesser responded that &quot;I don&#x27;t write slowly. It&#x27;s just that I throw out fast.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; confirmed his hard working habits and wrote that Loesser &quot;was consumed by nervous energy and as a result slept only four hours a night, spending the rest of the time working.&quot;

Loesser, a heavy cigarette smoker, died on July 28, 1969, of lung cancer at age 59 at the Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan&#x27;s East Harlem neighborhood.

==Personal life==
Lynn Garland and Frank Loesser divorced around the beginning of 1957 after 21 years of marriage. They had two children together: John Loesser, who works in theatre administration, and Susan Loesser, an author who wrote her father&#x27;s biography &quot;A Most Remarkable Fella: Frank Loesser and the Guys and Dolls in His Life: A Portrait by His Daughter&quot; (1993, 2000, ).

He married his second wife Jo Sullivan (born Elizabeth Josephine Sullivan) on April 29, 1959 after being introduced to her by Lynn. Jo Sullivan had played a lead in &quot;The Most Happy Fella&quot;. They had two children, Hannah and Emily. Emily is a performer who is married to actor Don Stephenson. Hannah was an artist in oils, pastels and mixed media; she died of cancer on January 25, 2007. Jo died on April 28, 2019, at age 91.

==Awards and legacy==
Loesser received the 1951 Tony Award for Best Musical for his &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; music and lyrics. He was nominated for the Tony Award for book, music and lyrics for &quot;The Most Happy Fella&quot; and as Best Composer for &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;. Loesser was awarded a Grammy Award in 1962 for Best Original Cast Show Album for &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;.

Loesser is regarded as one of the more talented writers of his era, noted for writing witty lyrics and clever musical devices. He also introduced a complex artistic style that challenged shaped the compositional approach of Broadway musicals. He was also noted for using classical forms, such as imitative counterpoint (Fugue for Tinhorns in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;).

Loesser won the 1950 Academy Award for Best Original Song for &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside.&quot; He was nominated four more times:
: &quot;Dolores&quot; from &quot;Las Vegas Nights&quot; (1941)
: &quot;They&#x27;re Either Too Young or Too Old&quot; from &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot; (1943)
: &quot;I Wish I Didn&#x27;t Love You So&quot; from &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot; (1947) (a hit that year for both Vaughn Monroe and the film&#x27;s star Betty Hutton)
: &quot;Thumbelina&quot; from the movie musical &quot;Hans Christian Andersen&quot; (1953)

The PBS documentary &quot;Heart &amp; Soul: The Life and Music of Frank Loesser&quot; was released in 2006.

42nd Street Moon artistic director Greg MacKellan developed &quot;Once in Love with Loesser&quot; in 2013 as one of his musical tributes dedicated to exploring and celebrating the work of some of Broadway&#x27;s great songwriters. The performance was built around the three stages of Loesser&#x27;s career: Tin Pan Alley, Hollywood, and Broadway. Jason Graae performed &quot;Once in Love with Amy&quot; and &quot;The King&#x27;s New Clothes;&quot; Emily Skinner sang Cleo&#x27;s &quot;Ooh! My Feet&quot;, and Rosabella&#x27;s &quot;Somebody, Somewhere&quot; (from &quot;The Most Happy Fella&quot;); Ashley Jarrett performed &quot;If I Were a Bell&quot;; and Ian Leonard provided a tongue-in-cheek rendition of &quot;Sing a Tropical Song&quot;.

Loesser, contrasted to his brother Arthur (1894-1969) in a humorous wordplay on the principle of &quot;the lesser of two evils&quot;, was reportedly once referred to as &quot;the evil of two Loessers&quot;. The two half-brothers died less than seven months apart in 1969.

<text>An advance healthcare directive, also known as living will, personal directive, advance directive, medical directive or advance decision, is a legal document in which a person specifies what actions should be taken for their health if they are no longer able to make decisions for themselves because of illness or incapacity. In the U.S. it has a legal status in itself, whereas in some countries it is legally persuasive without being a legal document.

A living will is one form of advance directive, leaving instructions for treatment. Another form is a specific type of power of attorney or health care proxy, in which the person authorizes someone (an agent) to make decisions on their behalf when they are incapacitated. People are often encouraged to complete both documents to provide comprehensive guidance regarding their care, although they may be combined into a single form. An example of combination documents includes the Five Wishes in the United States. The term &quot;living will&quot; is also the commonly recognised vernacular in many countries, especially the U.K. The legality of advance consent for advance healthcare directives depends on jurisdiction.

==Background==
Advance directives were created in response to the increasing sophistication and prevalence of medical technology. Numerous studies have documented critical deficits in the medical care of the dying; it has been found to be unnecessarily prolonged, painful, expensive, and emotionally burdensome to both patients and their families.

==Living will==

The living will is the oldest form of advance directive. It was first proposed by an Illinois attorney, Luis Kutner, in a speech to the Euthanasia Society of America in 1967 and published in a law journal in 1969. Kutner drew from existing estate law, by which an individual can control property affairs after death (i.e., when no longer available to speak for himself or herself) and devised a way for an individual to express their health care desires when no longer able to express current healthcare wishes. Because this form of &quot;will&quot; was to be used while an individual was still alive (but no longer able to make decisions), it was dubbed the &quot;living will&quot;. The U.S. Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA) went into effect in December 1991 and required healthcare providers (primarily hospitals, nursing homes, and home health agencies) to give patients information about their rights to make advance directives under state law.

A living will usually provides specific directives about the course of treatment healthcare providers and caregivers are to follow. In some cases a living will may forbid the use of various kinds of burdensome medical treatment. It may also be used to express wishes about the use or foregoing of food and water, if supplied via tubes or other medical devices. The living will is used only if the individual has become unable to give informed consent or refusal due to incapacity. A living will can be very specific or very general. An example of a statement sometimes found in a living will is: &quot;If I suffer an incurable, irreversible illness, disease, or condition and my attending physician determines that my condition is terminal, I direct that life-sustaining measures that would serve only to prolong my dying be withheld or discontinued.&quot;

More specific living wills may include information regarding an individual&#x27;s desire for such services such as analgesia (pain relief), antibiotics, hydration, feeding, and the use of ventilators or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, studies have also shown that adults are more likely to complete these documents if they are written in everyday language and less focused on technical treatments.

However, by the late 1980s, public advocacy groups became aware that many people remained unaware of advance directives and even fewer actually completed them. In part, this was seen as a failure of health care providers and medical organizations to promote and support the use of these documents. The public&#x27;s response was to press for further legislative support. The most recent result was the Patient Self-Determination Act of 1990, which attempted to address this awareness problem by requiring health care institutions to better promote and support the use of advance directives.

Living wills proved to be very popular, and by 2007, 41% of Americans had completed a living will. In response to public needs, state legislatures soon passed laws in support of living wills in virtually every state in the union.

However, as living wills began to be better recognized, key deficits were soon discovered. Most living wills tended to be limited in scope and often failed to fully address presenting problems and needs. Further, many individuals wrote out their wishes in ways that might conflict with quality medical practice. Ultimately, it was determined that a living will alone might be insufficient to address many important health care decisions. This led to the development of what some have called &quot;second generation&quot; advance directives – the &quot;health care proxy appointment&quot; or &quot;medical power of attorney.&quot;

Living wills also reflect a moment in time, and may therefore need regular updating to ensure that the correct course of action can be chosen.

==Healthcare proxy==
Power of attorney statutes have existed in the United States since the days of &quot;common law&quot; (i.e., laws brought from England to the United States during the colonial period). These early powers of attorney allowed an individual to name someone to act in their stead. Drawing upon these laws, &quot;durable powers of attorney for health care&quot; and &quot;healthcare proxy appointment&quot; documents were created and codified in law, allowing an individual to appoint someone to make healthcare decisions in their behalf if they should ever be rendered incapable of making their wishes known. People will normally benefit from having both a durable power of attorney and a healthcare proxy.

A healthcare proxy document appoints a person, the proxy, who can make decisions on behalf of the granting individual in the event of incapacity. The appointed healthcare proxy has, in essence, the same rights to request or refuse treatment that the individual would have if still capable of making and communicating health care decisions.
The appointed representative is authorized to make real-time decisions in actual circumstances, as opposed to advance decisions framed in hypothetical situations, as might be recorded in a living will. The healthcare proxy was rapidly accepted within the U.S. and authorizing legislation was soon enacted in most states.

One problem with a conventional healthcare proxy is that it may not be possible for the appointed proxy to determine what care choices the individual would have made if still capable, as healthcare proxies may be too vague for meaningful interpretation. While a study comparing next-of-kin decisions on behalf of an incapacitated person, (who later recovered) found that these surrogates chose correctly 68% of the time overall.

===Values-based directives===

One alternative to a conventional healthcare proxy is the values history, a &quot;two-part advance directive instrument that elicits patient values about terminal medical care and therapy-specific directives.&quot; The goal of this advance directive is to move away from a focus on specific treatments and medical procedures to a focus on patient values and personal goals.

Studies suggest that values regarding financial and psychological burden are strong motivators in not wanting a broad array of end-of-life therapies.

Another alternative to a conventional healthcare proxy is the medical directive, a document that describes six case scenarios for advance medical decision-making. The scenarios are each associated with a roster of commonly considered medical procedures and interventions, allowing the individual to decide in advance which treatments are wanted or not wanted under the circumstances.

A study conducted to address concerns that a non-statutory advance directive might leave an incapacitated person with a document that may not be honored found that they are generally accepted.

===Psychiatric advance directives===
A psychiatric advance directive (PAD), also known as a mental health advance directive, is a written document that describes what a person wants to happen if at some time in the future they are judged to have a mental disorder in such a way that they are deemed unable to decide for themselves or to communicate effectively.

A PAD can inform others about what treatment they want or do not want from psychiatrists or other mental health professionals, and it can identify a person to whom they have given the authority to make decisions on their behalf. A mental health advance directive is one kind of advance health care directive.

====Legal foundations====

Psychiatric advance directives are legal documents used by persons currently enjoying legal capacity to declare their preferences and instructions for future mental health treatment, or to appoint a surrogate decision maker through Health Care Power of Attorney (HCPA), in advance of being targeted by coercive mental health laws, during which they may be stripped of legal capacity to make decisions.

In the United States, although 25 states have now passed legislation in the past decade establishing authority for PADs, there is relatively little public information available to address growing interest in these legal documents. The Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) requires behavioral health facilities to ask patients if they have PADs.

====Clinical benefits====

A NIH-funded study conducted by researchers at Duke University has shown that creating a PAD with a trained facilitator increases therapeutic alliance with clinicians, enhances involuntary patients&#x27; treatment satisfaction and perceived autonomy, and improves treatment decision-making capacity among people labeled with severe mental illness.

PADs also provide a transportable document—increasingly accessible through electronic directories—to convey information about a detainee&#x27;s treatment history, including medical disorders, emergency contact information, and medication side effects. Clinicians often have limited information about citizens detained and labeled as psychiatric patients who present or are coercively presented and labeled as in crisis. A PAD may help clinicians gain prompt access to relevant information about individual cases and thus improve the quality of clinical decision-making, and enhance patient safety and long-term autonomy.

====Barriers====

National surveys in the United States indicate that although approximately 70% of people targeted by coercive psychiatry laws would want a PAD if offered assistance in completing one, less than 10% have actually completed a PAD.

In a survey conducted of 600 psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers showed that the vast majority thought advance care planning for crises would help improve patients&#x27; overall mental health care. Further, the more clinicians knew about PAD laws, the more favorable were their attitudes toward these practices. For instance, while most psychiatrists, social workers, and psychologists surveyed believed PADs would be helpful to people detained and targeted for forced drugging and electroshock when labeled with severe mental illnesses, clinicians with more legal knowledge about PAD laws were more likely to endorse PADs as a beneficial part of patients&#x27; treatment planning.

Many clinicians reported not knowing enough about how PADs work and specifically indicated they lacked resources to readily help patients fill out PADs or to help their clients develop crisis plans.

==Worldwide==

===Australia===
The laws regarding advance directives, powers of attorney, and enduring guardianships vary from state to state. In Queensland, for example, the concept of an advance health directive is defined in the &quot;Powers of attorney act of 1998&quot; and &quot;Guardianship and Administration act of 2000&quot;. Tasmania has no specific legislation concerning advance healthcare directives. Advance Care Planning (ACP) has been gaining prominence in Australia for its role in enhancing a patient&#x27;s autonomy and as an important component of good end-of-life care.

===Canada===
Health Canada – Canada&#x27;s federal health agency – has acknowledged the need for a greater investment in palliative and hospice care as the country faces a rapidly growing population of elderly and terminally ill citizens.

Much of the current focus in Canada is on advance care planning which involves encouraging individuals to reflect on and express their wishes for future care, including end-of-life care, before they become terminally ill or incapable of making decisions for themselves. A number of publicly funded initiatives exist to promote advance care planning and to encourage people to appoint &quot;substitute decision makers&quot; who make medical decisions and can give or withhold consent for medical procedures according to the patient&#x27;s pre-expressed wishes when the patient becomes incapable of doing so themselves

In 2008, The Advance Care Planning in Canada: A National Framework and Implementation Project was founded. The goal was to engage healthcare professionals and educate patients
about the importance of advance care planning and end of life care.

Polling indicates that 96% of Canadians think that having a conversation with a loved one about planning for the end of life is important. However, the same polls show that only about 13% have actually done so, or have created an advance care plan for themselves.
A 2014 Ipsos Reid Survey reveals that only about a third of Canadian doctors and nurses working in primary care feel comfortable discussing end of life issues with their patients. End-of-life issues in Canada have recently been highlighted due to the ongoing related debate about physician-assisted death in Canada. Former Federal Health Minister Rona Ambrose (July 15, 2013 to November 4, 2015) has stated: &quot;I think the starting point for me is that we still don&#x27;t have the best elderly care and palliative care yet… So let&#x27;s talk about making sure we have the best end-of-life care before we start talking about assisted suicide and euthanasia.&quot;

===England and Wales===
In England and Wales, people may make an advance directive or appoint a proxy under the Mental Capacity Act 2005. This is only for an advance refusal of treatment for when the person lacks mental capacity; to be legally binding, the advance decision must be specific about the treatment that is being refused and the circumstances in which the refusal will apply. To be valid, the person must have been competent and must have understood the decision when they signed the directive. Where the patient&#x27;s advance decision relates to a refusal of life-prolonging treatment this must be recorded in writing and witnessed. Any advance refusal is legally binding providing that the patient is an adult, the patient was competent and properly informed when reaching the decision, it is clearly applicable to the present circumstances and there is no reason to believe that the patient has changed their mind. If an advance decision does not meet these criteria but appears to set out a clear indication of the patient&#x27;s wishes, it will not be legally binding but should be taken into consideration in determining the patient&#x27;s best interests. In June 2010, the Wealth Management Solicitors, Moore Blatch, announced that research showed demand for Living Wills had trebled in the two years previous, indicating the rising level of people concerned about the way in which their terminal illness will be managed. According to the British Government, every adult with mental capacity has the right to agree to or refuse medical treatment. To make their advance wishes clear, people can use a living will, which can include general statements about wishes, which are not legally binding, and specific refusals of treatment called &quot;advance decisions&quot; or &quot;advance directives&quot;.

===European Union===
&quot;Country reports on advance directives&quot; is a 2008 paper summarizing advance health care legislation on each country in the European Union with a shorter summary for the U.S.; a 2009 paper also provides a European overview.

====Germany====
On 18 June 2009 the Bundestag passed a law on advance directives, applicable since 1 September 2009. Such law, based on the principle of the right of self-determination, provides for the assistance of a fiduciary and of the physician.

====Italy====
On 14 December 2017, Italian Senate officially approved a law on advance healthcare directive that came into force on 31 January 2018.

Controversy over end-of-life care emerged in Italy in 2006, when a terminally ill patient suffering from muscular dystrophy, Piergiorgio Welby, petitioned the courts for removal of his respirator. Debated in Parliament, no decision was reached. A doctor eventually honored Welby&#x27;s wishes by removing the respirator under sedation. The physician was initially charged for violating Italy&#x27;s laws against euthanasia, but was later cleared. Further debate ensued after the father of a 38-year-old woman, Eluana Englaro, petitioned the courts for permission to withdraw feeding tubes to allow her to die. Englaro had been in a coma for 17 years, following a car accident. After petitioning the courts for 10 years, authorization was granted and Englaro died in February 2009. In May 2008, apparently as a result of the recent Court of Cassation&#x27;s holding in the case of Englaro, a guardianship judge in Modena, Italy used relatively new legislation to work around the lack of the advance directive legislation. The new law permitted a judicially appointed guardian (&quot;amministratore di sostegno&quot;) to make decisions for an individual. Faced with a 70-year-old woman with end-stage Lou Gehrig&#x27;s Disease who was petitioning the court (with the support of her family) to prevent any later use of a respirator, the judge appointed her husband as guardian with the specific duty to refuse any tracheotomy and/or respirator use if/when the patient became unable to refuse such treatment herself.

===Japan===
Advance healthcare directives are not legally recognized in Japan. According to a 2017 survey by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW), 66% of surveyed individuals supported the idea of such directives, but only 8.1% had prepared their own. The private organization Nihon Songenshi Kyōkai (Japan Society for Dying with Dignity) offers members a semi-standardized &quot;living will&quot; (ribingu uiru) form that is registered with the organization, though it holds no legal weight.
===Korea===
Advance healthcare directives are legally recognized in Korea since 2016, when the Act on Decisions on Life-Sustaining Treatment for Patients in Hospice and Palliative Care was implemented in Korea, providing a broad framework for end-of-life decision-making. 

===Nigeria===
Advance healthcare directives is yet to be legalised in Nigeria, and patient’s “written directives” for determining their preferences, tradition still dominates in Nigeria and most African countries. 

===Israel===
In 2005, the Knesset passed a law allowing people to write advanced care directives. Right to refuse care is only recognized if the patient is considered terminally ill and their life expectancy is less than six months.

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, there are several organizations which take care of registering patient decrees, forms which are signed by the patients declaring that in case of permanent loss of judgement (e.g., inability to communicate or severe brain damage) all means of prolonging life shall be stopped. Family members and these organizations also keep proxies which entitle their holder to enforce such patient decrees. Establishing such decrees is relatively uncomplicated.

In 2013 a law concerning advanced healthcare directives has been voted. Every adult with testamentary capacity can redact a legal binding document declaring a will in the event of loss of judgement. They may also designate a natural person to discuss medical procedures with the attending doctor and make decisions on their behalf if they are longer capable of judgment.

===United States===
Aggressive medical intervention leaves nearly two million Americans confined to nursing homes, and over 1.4 million Americans remain so medically frail as to survive only through the use of feeding tubes. Of U.S. deaths, about a third occur in health care facilities. As many as 30,000 persons are kept alive in comatose and permanently vegetative states.

Cost burdens to individuals and families are considerable. A national study found that: &quot;In 20% of cases, a family member had to quit work&quot;, 31% lost &quot;all or most savings&quot; (even though 96% had insurance), and &quot;20% reported loss of [their] major source of income&quot;. Yet, studies indicate that 70-95% of people would rather refuse aggressive medical treatment than have their lives medically prolonged in incompetent or other poor prognosis states.

As more and more Americans experienced the burdens and diminishing benefits of invasive and aggressive medical treatment in poor prognosis states – either directly (themselves) or through a loved one – pressure began to mount to devise ways to avoid the suffering and costs associated with treatments one did not want in personally untenable situations. The first formal response was the living will.

In the United States, all states recognize some form of living wills or the designation of a health care proxy. The term &quot;living will&quot; is not officially recognized under California law, but an advance health care directive or durable power of attorney may be used for the same purpose as a living will.

In Pennsylvania on November 30, 2006, Governor Edward Rendell signed into law Act 169, that provides a comprehensive statutory framework governing advance health care directives and health care decision-making for incompetent patients. As a result, health care organizations make available a &quot;Combined Living Will &amp; Health Care Power of Attorney Example Form from Pennsylvania Act 169 of 2006.&quot;

Several states offer living will &quot;registries&quot; where citizens can file their living will so that they are more easily and readily accessible by doctors and other health care providers. However, in recent years some of these registries, such as the one run by the Washington State Department of Health, have been shuttered by the state government because of low enrollment, lack of funds, or both.

On July 28, 2009, Barack Obama became the first United States President to announce publicly that he had a living will, and to encourage others to do the same. He told an AARP town meeting, &quot;So I actually think it&#x27;s a good idea to have a living will. I&#x27;d encourage everybody to get one. I have one; Michelle has one. And we hope we don&#x27;t have to use it for a long time, but I think it&#x27;s something that is sensible.&quot; The announcement followed controversy surrounding proposed health care legislation that included language that would permit the payment of doctors under Medicare to counsel patients regarding living wills, sometimes referred to as the &quot;infamous&quot; page 425. Shortly afterwards, bioethicist Jacob Appel issued a call to make living wills mandatory.

===India===

Supreme Court of India on March 9, 2018, permitted living wills and withholding and withdrawing life sustaining treatments. The country&#x27;s apex court held that the right to a dignified life extends up to the point of having a dignified death.

<text>Thomas Corneille (20 August 1625 – 8 December 1709) was a French lexicographer and dramatist.

== Biography ==
Born in Rouen some nineteen years after his brother Pierre, the &quot;great Corneille&quot;, Thomas&#x27;s skill as a poet seems to have shown itself early. At the age of fifteen he composed a play in Latin which was performed by his fellow-pupils at the Jesuit school in Rouen, the Collège de Bourbon (now the Lycée Pierre Corneille). His first play in the French language, &quot;Les Engagements du hasard&quot;, was probably first performed at the Hôtel de Bourgogne in 1647, although not published until 1656. &quot;Le Feint Astrologue&quot;, imitated from the Spanish of Pedro Calderón de la Barca, and itself imitated in Dryden&#x27;s &quot;An Evening&#x27;s Love&quot;, came the following year.

After his brother&#x27;s death, Thomas succeeded his vacant chair in the Académie française. He then turned his attention to philology, producing a new edition of the &quot;Remarques&quot; of CF Vaugelas in 1687. His &quot;Le Dictionnaire des Arts et des Sciences&quot; first appeared in 1694 as a supplement to the first edition of &quot;Le dictionnaire de l&#x27;Academie françoise&quot;—also published that year—and as a competitor to Furetière&#x27;s &quot;Dictionaire universel&quot; of 1690. Corneille&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire&quot; is regarded by Kafker as one of the nine &quot;Notable encyclopaedias of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries&quot; that preceded Diderot and d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;.

A complete translation of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (he had published six books with the &quot;Heroic Epistles&quot; some years previously) followed in 1697.

In 1704 he lost his sight and was constituted a &quot;veteran,&quot; a dignity which gave him the privileges of an academician, while exempting him from the duties. He did not allow his blindness to put a stop to his work, however, and in 1708 produced a large &quot;Dictionnaire universel géographique et historique&quot; in three volumes folio. This was his last major work. He died at Les Andelys at the age of eighty-four.

== Place in French literature ==
Thomas Corneille has often been regarded as one who, but for his surname, would merit no notice. Others feel he was unlucky in having a brother (Pierre Corneille) who outshone him, as he would have outshone almost anyone else. 
In 1761 Voltaire wrote of Thomas Corneille: ‘si vous exceptez Racine, auquel il ne faut comparer personne, il était le seul de son temps qui fût digne d’être le premier au-dessous de son frère&#x27; (if you except Racine, to whom nobody can be compared, he was the first of his time who was worthy to be behind his brother).

The brothers were close, and practically lived together. Of his forty-two plays (the highest number assigned to him), the last edition of his complete works contains only thirty-two dramas, but he wrote several in collaboration with other authors. Two are usually reprinted as his masterpieces at the end of his brother&#x27;s selected works. These are &quot;Ariane&quot; (1672) and the &quot;Le Comte d&#x27;Essex (The Earl of Essex (1678))&quot;, in the former of which Rachel attained success. (An oil painting depicting a scene from Le Comte d&#x27;Essex is in the Hermitage Museum.) But of &quot;Laodice&quot;, &quot;Camma&quot;, &quot;Stilico&quot; and some other pieces, Pierre Corneille himself said that &quot;he wished he had written them,&quot; and he was not wont to speak lightly. &quot;Camma&quot; (1661, on the same story as Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Cup&quot;) deserves special notice.

Thomas Corneille is remarkable in the literary gossip-history of his time. His &quot;Timocrate&quot; boasted of the longest run (80 nights) recorded of any play during the century. For &quot;La Devineresse&quot;, he and his cowriter Jean Donneau de Visé, founder of the &quot;Mercure galant&quot; (to which Thomas contributed), received over 6,000 livres, the largest sum known to have been paid during that period. Lastly, one of his pieces (&quot;Le Baron des Fondrières&quot;) claims the honor of being the first which was booed off the stage. Thomas Corneille is also remarkable for having excelled in almost all dramatic genres of his time, including the new and innovative genres that were the &quot;pièce à machines&quot; and opera at the time. His machine play &quot;Circé&quot; was among the most successful of the century. His three opera librettoes, &quot;Psyché&quot; (1678), &quot;Bellérophon&quot; (1679) and &quot;Médée&quot; (1693) make him, next to Philippe Quinault and Jean Galbert de Campistron, one of the most important French librettists of the seventeenth century.

In a letter to her father, shortly before her execution, Charlotte Corday quotes Thomas Corneille: &quot;Le Crime fait la honte, et non pas l’échafaud!&quot; (The crime causes the shame, and not the scaffold!).

<text>Zhuang Zhou (), commonly known as Zhuangzi (; ; literally &quot;Master Zhuang&quot;; also rendered in the Wade–Giles romanization as Chuang Tzu), was an influential Chinese philosopher who lived around the 4th century BCE during the Warring States period, a period of great development in Chinese philosophy, the Hundred Schools of Thought. He is credited with writing—in part or in whole—a work known by his name, the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;, which is one of two foundational texts of Taoism, alongside the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;.

== Life ==

The only account of the life of Zhuangzi is a brief sketch in chapter 63 of Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, and most of the information it contains seems to have simply been drawn from anecdotes in the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; itself. In Sima&#x27;s biography, he is described as a minor official from the town of Meng (in modern Anhui) in the state of Song, living in the time of King Hui of Liang and King Xuan of Qi (late fourth century BC). Sima Qian writes that Zhuangzi was especially influenced by Laozi, and that he turned down a job offer from King Wei of Chu, because he valued his personal freedom.

His existence has been questioned by Russell Kirkland, who asserts that &quot;there is no reliable historical data at all&quot; for Zhuang Zhou, and that most of the available information on the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; comes from its third-century commentator, Guo Xiang.

== Writings ==

Zhuangzi is traditionally credited as the author of at least part of the work bearing his name, the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;. This work, in its current shape consisting of 33 chapters, is traditionally divided into three parts: the first, known as the &quot;Inner Chapters&quot;, consists of the first seven chapters; the second, known as the &quot;Outer Chapters&quot;, consist of the next 15 chapters; the last, known as the &quot;Mixed Chapters&quot;, consist of the remaining 11 chapters. The meaning of these three names is disputed: according to Guo Xiang, the &quot;Inner Chapters&quot; were written by Zhuangzi, the &quot;Outer Chapters&quot; written by his disciples, and the &quot;Mixed Chapters&quot; by other hands; the other interpretation is that the names refer to the origin of the titles of the chapters—the &quot;Inner Chapters&quot; take their titles from phrases inside the chapter, the &quot;Outer Chapters&quot; from the opening words of the chapters, and the &quot;Mixed Chapters&quot; from a mixture of these two sources.

Further study of the text does not provide a clear choice between these alternatives. On the one side, as Martin Palmer points out in the introduction to his translation, two of the three chapters Sima Qian cited in his biography of Zhuangzi, come from the &quot;Outer Chapters&quot; and the third from the &quot;Mixed Chapters&quot;. &quot;Neither of these are allowed as authentic Chuang Tzu chapters by certain purists, yet they breathe the very spirit of Chuang Tzu just as much as, for example, the famous &#x27;butterfly passage&#x27; of chapter 2.&quot;

On the other hand, chapter 33 has been often considered as intrusive, being a survey of the major movements during the &quot;Hundred Schools of Thought&quot; with an emphasis on the philosophy of Hui Shi. Further, A.C. Graham and other critics have subjected the text to a stylistic analysis and identified four strains of thought in the book: a) the ideas of Zhuangzi or his disciples; b) a &quot;primitivist&quot; strain of thinking similar to Laozi in chapters 8-10 and the first half of chapter 11; c) a strain very strongly represented in chapters 28-31 which is attributed to the philosophy of Yang Zhu; and d) a fourth strain which may be related to the philosophical school of Huang-Lao. In this spirit, Martin Palmer wrote that &quot;trying to read Chuang Tzu sequentially is a mistake. The text is a collection, not a developing argument.&quot;

Zhuangzi was renowned for his brilliant wordplay and use an original form of &quot;gōng&#x27;àn&quot; (Chinese: 公案) or parables to convey messages. His critiques of Confucian society and historical figures are humorous and at times ironic.

<text>The University of North Carolina at Asheville (UNC Asheville, UNCA, or simply Asheville) is a public liberal arts university in Asheville, North Carolina, United States. UNC Asheville is the designated liberal arts institution in the University of North Carolina system. It is a member and the headquarters of the Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges.

==History==
UNC Asheville was founded in 1927 as Buncombe County Junior College, part of the Buncombe County public school system. It was the first tuition-free public college in North Carolina. It was located in the Biltmore School in south Asheville on Hendersonville Road (U.S. 25). In 2001, Biltmore School was recognized by the Save America&#x27;s Treasures program. 

During the Great Depression, the college started charging tuition. In 1930 the school merged with the College of the City of Asheville (founded in 1928) to form Biltmore Junior College. In 1934 the college was renamed Biltmore College. In 1936, the name changed to Asheville-Biltmore College, and control was transferred to the Asheville City Schools.

In 1949, the college relocated to the 20,000-square foot Overlook Castle, also known as Seely&#x27;s Caste, which included 29 acres on the crest of Sunset Mountain. Evelyn Grove Seely, widow of Fred Loring Seely, sold Overlook to the college $125,000; she also donated $50,000 to the acquisition fund. The college renamed the house Seely Hall, as requested by the seller. The house, no longer part of the college, was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

In 1961, Asheville-Biltmore College moved to the present UNC Asheville campus in north Asheville. That year, the college desegregated with the enrollment of Etta Mae Whitner Patterson. In 1963 it became a state-supported four-year college, and awarded its first bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 1966. Its first residence halls were built in 1967. It adopted its current name in 1969 upon becoming part of the Consolidated University of North Carolina, since 1972 called the University of North Carolina System. 

UNC Asheville desegregated its faculty in 1981, along with all schools in the University of North Carolina. It is one of three baccalaureate colleges within the University of North Carolina System, and has been classified as a Liberal Arts I institution since 1992.

=== Administration ===
The university operates under the guidance and policies of the Board of Trustees of the University of North Carolina at Asheville. Members of the board are appointed by the governor of North Carolina. As part of the seventeen-campus University of North Carolina System, UNC Asheville also falls under the administration of the system&#x27;s president, Peter Hans. The UNC System is administered by the UNC Board of Governors, which is elected by the North Carolina Legislature, and advised by the UNC Faculty Assembly. Kimberly van Noort, former interim provost, is currently serving as interim chancellor of UNC Asheville, following the departure of Nancy Cable in December 2022.

<text>Paul McGuinness (born 16 June 1951) is a British talent manager. He was the founder of Principle Management Limited, a popular music act management company based in Dublin, Ireland. He was the manager of the rock band U2 from 1978 to 2013.

==Early life==
McGuinness was born in a British military hospital at Rinteln, Westphalia in Germany, where his father, Philip McGuinness (a Liverpudlian) was serving with the Royal Air Force. His mother Sheila McGuinness née Lyne, was a schoolteacher from County Kerry, Ireland. There were three children in the family: Paul, Niall, and Katy.

McGuinness received his early formal education in Ireland at the private Jesuit boarding school Clongowes Wood College. From there he went on to Trinity College Dublin, where he directed plays, edited the magazine T.C.D. Miscellany, and promoted gigs, but dropped out without a degree.

== Career ==
=== Early years ===
Before becoming involved with U2, he worked as a film assistant director on productions such as John Boorman&#x27;s &quot;Zardoz&quot;. For a time, he also managed folk-rock group Spud.

=== U2 ===
McGuinness first met U2 at a Dublin gig on 25 May 1978 where they were supporting the Gamblers. Following this meeting, McGuinness became U2&#x27;s manager, having been introduced to the band by Bill Graham, a journalist with &quot;Hot Press&quot; magazine.

He founded Principle Management Limited on 29 March 1984.

His original agreement with the band was that the money would be split equally 5 ways, though this was changed later.

McGuinness and Bill Whelan set up a music publishing company called McGuinness/Whelan Publishing in the late 1980s. Whelan later composed the music for Riverdance.
In 2002, McGuinness was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Meteor Music Awards at Point Theatre Dublin and U2 won the best Irish Band Award.

Noted for his business acumen, he has been responsible for U2 3D concert films, U2-branded iPods, sponsorship from BlackBerry and the first-ever concert streamed live on YouTube.

McGuinness was regarded as the fifth member of U2, although in an interview with &quot;The Irish Press&quot; in 1985, when asked if he was the fifth member of U2, he replied &quot;the fifth member of U2 is in Adam (Clayton)&#x27;s trousers&quot;. He is also regarded as one of the most successful managers in the music business.

McGuinness stepped down as manager of U2 after 34 years on 13 November 2013, with Madonna&#x27;s manager Guy Oseary succeeding him in 2014 when he sold Principle to Live Nation.

==Other activities==
He was a founding partner of TV3 (Ireland) and was one of the owners of Ardmore Film Studios.

He became a member of the Arts Council of Ireland on 1 January 1988, having been appointed by Charles Haughey and served until February 2000 when he resigned.

He has been an advocate on behalf of artists, record labels, and music publishers. On 28 January 2008, in a speech at the Midem music industry convention in Cannes, McGuinness specifically accused companies such as Apple, Google, Yahoo!, and Facebook of building &quot;multi-billion dollar industries on the back of our content without paying for it&quot;.

In 2015, he founded Primo Productions, a film and TV company.  Primo has produced 3 Seasons of &quot;Riviera&quot;, a drama set in the South of France.  McGuinness wrote the &quot;list of ingredients&quot; for the show: &quot;Rich people behaving badly in the sun, yachts, Maseratis, great clothes, beautiful women, art fraud, money laundering through the auction houses, Russians, English people, American, French.  Murder, adultery&quot;. Everyday life on the Côte d’Azur. McGuinness&#x27;s production partner is Kris Thykier of Archery Pictures.  The show was originally commissioned by Anne Mensah of SKY Atlantic.

==Personal life==

McGuinness married Kathy Gilfillan in 1977. They met whilst he was studying at Trinity. Gilfillan is director of The Lilliput Press.

<doc id="166159" wikidata="Q1607404" url="?curid=166159" title="Henry Ward Beecher">
<text>Henry Ward Beecher (June 24, 1813 – March 8, 1887) was an American Congregationalist clergyman, social reformer, and speaker, known for his support of the abolition of slavery, his emphasis on God&#x27;s love, and his 1875 adultery trial. His rhetorical focus on Christ&#x27;s love has influenced mainstream Christianity through the 21st century.

Beecher was the son of Lyman Beecher, a Calvinist minister who became one of the best-known evangelists of his era. Several of his brothers and sisters became well-known educators and activists, most notably Harriet Beecher Stowe, who achieved worldwide fame with her abolitionist novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. Henry Ward Beecher graduated from Amherst College in 1834 and Lane Seminary in 1837 before serving as a minister in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, and later in Indianapolis&#x27;s Second Presbyterian Church when the congregation resided at Circle Hall at Monument Circle.

In 1847, Beecher became the first pastor of the Plymouth Church in Brooklyn, New York. He soon acquired fame on the lecture circuit for his novel oratorical style in which he employed humor, dialect, and slang. Over the course of his ministry, he developed a theology emphasizing God&#x27;s love above all else. He also grew interested in social reform, particularly the abolitionist movement. In the years leading up to the Civil War, he raised money to purchase slaves from captivity and to send rifles—nicknamed &quot;Beecher&#x27;s Bibles&quot;—to abolitionists fighting in Kansas. He toured Europe during the Civil War, speaking in support of the Union.

After the war, Beecher supported social reform causes such as women&#x27;s suffrage and temperance. He also championed Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution, stating that it was not incompatible with Christian beliefs. He was widely rumored to be an adulterer, and in 1872 the &quot;Woodhull &amp; Claflin&#x27;s Weekly&quot; published a story about his affair with Elizabeth Richards Tilton, the wife of his friend and former co-worker Theodore Tilton. In 1874, Tilton filed charges for &quot;criminal conversation&quot; against Beecher. The subsequent trial resulted in a hung jury and was one of the most widely reported trials of the century.

After the death of his father in 1863, Beecher was unquestionably &quot;the most famous preacher in the nation&quot;. Beecher&#x27;s long career in the public spotlight led biographer Debby Applegate to call her biography of him &quot;The Most Famous Man in America&quot;.

==Early life==

Beecher was born in Litchfield, Connecticut, the eighth of 13 children born to Lyman Beecher, a Presbyterian preacher from Boston. His siblings included author Harriet Beecher Stowe, educators Catharine Beecher and Thomas K. Beecher, and activists Charles Beecher and Isabella Beecher Hooker, and his father became known as &quot;the father of more brains than any man in America&quot;. Beecher&#x27;s mother Roxana died when Henry was three, and his father married Harriet Porter, whom Henry described as &quot;severe&quot; and subject to bouts of depression.
Beecher also taught school for a time in Whitinsville, Massachusetts.

The Beecher household was &quot;the strangest and most interesting combination of fun and seriousness&quot;. The family was poor, and Lyman Beecher assigned his children &quot;a heavy schedule of prayer meetings, lectures, and religious services&quot; while banning the theater, dancing, most fiction, and the celebration of birthdays or Christmas. The family&#x27;s pastimes included story-telling and listening to their father play the fiddle.

Beecher had a childhood stammer. He was also considered slow-witted and one of the less promising of the brilliant Beecher children. His poor performance earned him punishments, such as being forced to sit for hours in the girls&#x27; corner while wearing a dunce cap. At 14, he began his oratorical training at Mount Pleasant Classical Institute, a boarding school in Amherst, Massachusetts, where he met Constantine Fondolaik Newell, a Smyrna Greek. They attended Amherst College together, where they signed a contract pledging lifelong friendship and brotherly love. Fondolaik died of cholera after returning to Greece around October 1848, and Beecher named his third son after him.

During his years in Amherst, Beecher had his first taste of public speaking, giving his first sermon or talk in 1831 about four miles southeast, in the schoolhouse at a village then called Logtown, today known as Dwight. He was in his second year at Amherst College, and he soon thereafter resolved to join the ministry, setting aside his early dream of going to sea. He met his future wife Eunice Bullard, the daughter of a well-known physician, and they were engaged on January 2, 1832. He also developed an interest in the pseudoscience of phrenology, an attempt to link personality traits with features of the human skull, and he befriended Orson Squire Fowler who became the theory&#x27;s best-known American proponent.

Beecher graduated from Amherst College in 1834 and then attended Lane Theological Seminary outside Cincinnati, Ohio. Lane was headed by Beecher&#x27;s father, who had become &quot;America&#x27;s most famous preacher&quot;. The student body was divided by the slavery question, whether to support a form of gradual emancipation, as Lyman Beecher did, or to demand immediate emancipation. Beecher stayed largely clear of the controversy, sympathetic to the radical students but unwilling to defy his father. He graduated in 1837.

==Early ministry==
On August 3, 1837, Beecher married Eunice Bullard, and the two proceeded to the small, impoverished town of Lawrenceburg, Indiana, where Beecher had been offered a post as a minister of the First Presbyterian Church. He received his first national publicity when he became involved in the break between &quot;New School&quot; and &quot;Old School&quot; Presbyterianism, which were split over questions of original sin and the slavery issue; Henry&#x27;s father Lyman was a leading proponent of the New School. Because of Henry&#x27;s adherence to the New School position, the Old School-dominated presbytery declined to install him as the pastor, and the resulting controversy split the western Presbyterian Church into rival synods.
Though Henry Beecher&#x27;s Lawrenceburg church declared its independence from the Synod to retain him as its pastor, the poverty that followed the Panic of 1837 caused him to look for a new position. Banker Samuel Merrill invited Beecher to visit Indianapolis in 1839, and he was offered the ministry of the Second Presbyterian Church there on May 13, 1839. Unusually for a speaker of his era, Beecher would use humor and informal language including dialect and slang as he preached. His preaching was a major success, building Second Presbyterian into the largest church in the city, and he also led a successful revival meeting in nearby Terre Haute. However, mounting debt led to Beecher again seeking a new position in 1847, and he accepted the invitation of businessman Henry Bowen to head a new Plymouth Congregational Church in Brooklyn, New York. Beecher&#x27;s national fame continued to grow, and he took to the lecture circuit, becoming one of the most popular speakers in the country and charging correspondingly high fees.

In the course of his preaching, Henry Ward Beecher came to reject his father Lyman&#x27;s theology, which &quot;combined the old belief that &#x27;human fate was preordained by God&#x27;s plan&#x27; with a faith in the capacity of rational men and women to purge society of its sinful ways&quot;. Henry instead preached a &quot;Gospel of Love&quot; that emphasized God&#x27;s absolute love rather than human sinfulness, and doubted the existence of Hell. He also rejected his father&#x27;s prohibitions against various leisure activities as distractions from a holy life, stating instead that &quot;Man was made for enjoyment&quot;.

==Social and political activism==
===Abolitionism===
Henry Ward Beecher became involved in many social issues of his day, most notably abolition. Though Beecher hated slavery as early as his seminary days, his views were generally more moderate than those of abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison, who advocated the breakup of the Union if it would also mean the end of slavery. A personal turning point for Beecher came in October 1848 when he learned of two escaped young female slaves who had been recaptured; their father had been offered the chance to ransom them from captivity, and appealed to Beecher to help raise funds. Beecher raised over two thousand dollars to secure the girls&#x27; freedom. On June 1, 1856, he held another mock slave auction seeking enough contributions to purchase the freedom of a young woman named Sarah.

In his widely reprinted piece &quot;Shall We Compromise&quot;, Beecher assailed the Compromise of 1850, a compromise between anti-slavery and pro-slavery forces brokered by Whig Senator Henry Clay. The compromise banned slavery from California and slave-trading from Washington, D.C., at the cost of a stronger Fugitive Slave Act; Beecher objected to the last provision in particular, arguing that it was a Christian&#x27;s duty to feed and shelter escaped slaves. Slavery and liberty were fundamentally incompatible, Beecher argued, making compromise impossible: &quot;One or the other must die&quot;. In 1856, Beecher campaigned for Republican John C. Frémont, the first presidential candidate of the Republican Party; despite Beecher&#x27;s aid, Frémont lost to Democrat James Buchanan. During the pre-Civil-War conflict in the Kansas Territory, known as &quot;Bloody Kansas&quot;, Beecher raised funds to send Sharps rifles to abolitionist forces, stating that the weapons would do more good than &quot;a hundred Bibles&quot;. The press subsequently nicknamed the weapons &quot;Beecher&#x27;s Bibles&quot;. Beecher became widely hated in the American South for his abolitionist actions and received numerous death threats.

In 1863, during the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln sent Beecher on a speaking tour of Europe to build support for the Union cause. Beecher&#x27;s speeches helped turn European popular sentiment against the rebel Confederate States of America and prevent its recognition by foreign powers. At the close of the war in April 1865, Beecher was invited to speak at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, where the first shots of the war had been fired; Lincoln had again personally selected him, stating, &quot;We had better send Beecher down to deliver the address on the occasion of raising the flag because if it had not been for Beecher there would have been no flag to raise.&quot; (See Raising the Flag at Fort Sumter.)

===Other views===

Beecher advocated for the temperance movement throughout his career and was a strict teetotaler. Following the Civil War, he also became a leader in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. In 1867, he campaigned unsuccessfully to become a delegate to the New York Constitutional Convention of 1867–1868 on a suffrage platform, and in 1869, was elected unanimously as the first president of the American Woman Suffrage Association.

In the Reconstruction Era, Beecher sided with President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s plan for swift restoration of Southern states to the Union. He believed that captains of industry should be the leaders of society and supported Social Darwinist ideas. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, he preached strongly against the strikers whose wages had been cut, stating, &quot;Man cannot live by bread alone but the man who cannot live on bread and water is not fit to live,&quot; and &quot;If you are being reduced, go down boldly into poverty&quot;. His remarks were so unpopular that cries of &quot;Hang Beecher!&quot; became common at labor rallies, and plainclothes detectives protected his church.

Influenced by British author Herbert Spencer, Beecher embraced Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution in the 1880s, identifying as a &quot;cordial Christian evolutionist&quot;. He argued that the theory was in keeping with what Applegate called &quot;the inevitability of progress&quot;, seeing a steady march toward perfection as a part of God&#x27;s plan. In 1885, he wrote &quot;Evolution and Religion&quot; to expound these views. His sermons and writings helped to gain acceptance for the theory in America.

Beecher was a prominent advocate for allowing Chinese immigration to continue to the US, helping to delay passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act until 1882. He argued that as other American peoples, such as the Irish, had seen a gradual increase in their social standing, a new people was required to do &quot;what we call the menial work&quot;, and that the Chinese, &quot;by reason of their training, by the habits of a thousand years, are adapted to do that work.&quot;

==Personal life==
=== Marriage===

Beecher married Eunice Bullard in 1837 after a five-year engagement. Their marriage was not a happy one; as Applegate writes, &quot;within a year of their wedding they embarked on the classic marital cycle of neglect and nagging&quot;, marked by Henry&#x27;s prolonged absences from home. The couple also suffered the deaths of four of their eight children.

Beecher enjoyed the company of women, and rumors of extramarital affairs circulated as early as his Indiana days, when he was believed to have had an affair with a young member of his congregation. In 1858, the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; wrote a story accusing him of an affair with another young church member who had later become a prostitute. The wife of Beecher&#x27;s patron and editor, Henry Bowen, confessed on her deathbed to her husband of an affair with Beecher; Bowen concealed the incident during his lifetime.

Several members of Beecher&#x27;s circle reported that Beecher had had an affair with Edna Dean Proctor, an author with whom he was collaborating on a book of his sermons. The couple&#x27;s first encounter was the subject of dispute: Beecher reportedly told friends that it had been consensual, while Proctor reportedly told Henry Bowen that Beecher had raped her. Regardless of the initial circumstances, Beecher and Proctor allegedly then carried on their affair for more than a year. According to historian Barry Werth, &quot;it was standard gossip that &#x27;Beecher preaches to seven or eight of his mistresses every Sunday evening.&#x27;&quot;

===The Beecher–Tilton Scandal Case (1875)===
In a highly publicized scandal, Beecher was tried on charges that he had committed adultery with a friend&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth Tilton. In 1870, Elizabeth had confessed to her husband, Theodore Tilton, that she had had a relationship with Beecher. The charges became public after Theodore told Elizabeth Cady Stanton and others of his wife&#x27;s confession. Stanton repeated the story to fellow women&#x27;s rights leaders Victoria Woodhull and Isabella Beecher Hooker.

Henry Ward Beecher had publicly denounced Woodhull&#x27;s advocacy of free love. Seeing a chance to get even no matter the cost, she published a story titled &quot;The Beecher–Tilton Scandal Case&quot; in her paper &quot;Woodhull and Claflin&#x27;s Weekly&quot; on November 2, 1872; the article made detailed allegations that America&#x27;s most renowned clergyman was secretly practicing the free-love doctrines that he denounced from the pulpit. Woodhull was arrested in New York City and imprisoned for sending obscene material through the mail. The scandal split the Beecher siblings; Harriet and others supported Henry, while Isabella publicly supported Woodhull. The first trial was Woodhull&#x27;s, who was released on a technicality.

Subsequent hearings and trial, in the words of Walter A. McDougall, &quot;drove Reconstruction off the front pages for two and a half years&quot; and became &quot;the most sensational &#x27;he said, she said&#x27; in American history&quot;. On October 31, 1873, Plymouth Church excommunicated Theodore Tilton for &quot;slandering&quot; Beecher. The Council of Congregational Churches held a board of inquiry from March 9 to 29, 1874, to investigate the disfellowshipping of Tilton, and censured Plymouth Church for acting against Tilton without first examining the charges against Beecher. As of June 27, 1874, Plymouth Church established its own investigating committee which exonerated Beecher. Tilton then sued Beecher on civil charges of adultery. The Beecher–Tilton trial began in January 1875, and ended in July when the jurors deliberated for six days but were unable to reach a verdict. In February 1876, the Congregational church held a final hearing to exonerate Beecher.

Stanton was outraged by Beecher&#x27;s repeated exonerations, calling the scandal a &quot;holocaust of womanhood&quot;. French author George Sand planned a novel about the affair, but died the following year before it could be written.

==Later life and legacy==
===Later life===

In 1871, Yale University established &quot;The Lyman Beecher Lectureship&quot;, of which Henry taught the first three annual courses. After the heavy expenses of the trial, Beecher embarked on a lecture tour of the West that returned him to solvency. In 1884, he angered many of his Republican allies when he endorsed Democratic candidate Grover Cleveland for the presidency, arguing that Cleveland should be forgiven for having fathered an illegitimate child. He made another lecture tour of England in 1886.

On March 6, 1887, Beecher suffered a stroke and died in his sleep on March 8. Still a widely popular figure, he was mourned in newspapers and sermons across the country. Henry Ward Beecher is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. Beecher&#x27;s grandson Harry Beecher was a college football player who was the subject of the first American football card, printed in 1888.

===Legacy===
In assessing Beecher&#x27;s legacy, Applegate states that

At his best, Beecher represented what remains the most lovable and popular strain of American culture: incurable optimism; can-do enthusiasm; and open-minded, open-hearted pragmatism ... His reputation has been eclipsed by his own success. Mainstream Christianity is so deeply infused with the rhetoric of Christ&#x27;s love that most Americans can imagine nothing else, and have no appreciation or memory of the revolution wrought by Beecher and his peers.

In 1929, First Presbyterian Church in Lawrenceburg was renamed Beecher Presbyterian.

A Henry Ward Beecher Monument created by the sculptor John Quincy Adams Ward was unveiled on June 24, 1891, in Borough Hall Park, Brooklyn, and was later relocated to Cadman Plaza, Brooklyn in 1959.

A limerick written about Beecher by poet Oliver Herford became well known in the USA:

Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. offered his own limerick on Beecher:

Christopher J Barry, Canadian published songwriter, offered this alternative limerick:

In 2022, New Hampshire Historical Marker no. 274 was unveiled in Carroll, New Hampshire, commemorating Beecher and his open-air sermons in the town.

==Writings==
===Background===

Henry Ward Beecher was a prolific author as well as speaker. His public writing began in Indiana, where he edited an agricultural journal, &quot;The Farmer and Gardener&quot;. He was one of the founders and for nearly twenty years an editorial contributor of the New York &quot;Independent&quot;, a Congregationalist newspaper, and from 1861 till 1863 was its editor. His contributions to this were signed with an asterisk, and many of them were afterward collected and published in 1855 as &quot;Star Papers; or, Experiences of Art and Nature&quot;.

In 1865, Robert E. Bonner of the &quot;New York Ledger&quot; offered Beecher twenty-four thousand dollars to follow his sister&#x27;s example and compose a novel; the subsequent novel, &quot;Norwood, or Village Life in New England&quot;, was published in 1868. Beecher stated his intent for &quot;Norwood&quot; was to present a heroine who is &quot;large of soul, a child of nature, and, although a Christian, yet in childlike sympathy with the truths of God in the natural world, instead of books.&quot; McDougall describes the resulting novel as &quot;a New England romance of flowers and bosomy sighs ... &#x27;new theology&#x27; that amounted to warmed-over Emerson&quot;. The novel was moderately well received by critics of the day. In 1964 sculptor Joseph Kiselewski created a bronze medal depicting Henry Ward Beecher for the Hall of Fame for Great Americans at the Bronx Community College in New York City. The sculptor John Massey Rhind created the Hall&#x27;s bust of Beecher.

<text>Pontus de Tyard (also Thyard, Thiard) (c. 1521 – 23 September 1605) was a French poet and priest, a member of &quot;La Pléiade&quot;.

== Life ==

He was born at Bissy-sur-Fley in Burgundy, of which he was &quot;seigneur&quot;, but the exact year of his birth is uncertain. He became a friend of Antoine Héroet and Maurice Scève. His first published work, &quot;Erreurs amoureuses&quot; 1549, was augmented with other poems in successive editions till 1573. His work anticipated that of Pierre de Ronsard and Joachim du Bellay. He was one of the first to write sonnets in the French language (preceded by Clément Marot and Mellin de Saint-Gelais). He is also said to have introduced the &quot;sestina&quot;, originally a Provençal invention, into French poetry.

Tyard contributed to the poetic and metaphysical program of La Pléiade by elaborating, in his &quot;Solitaire Premier, ou Prose des Muses, et de la fureur poétique&quot; (1552), a full theory of divine fury, derived in large part from the Latin translations and commentaries by the neo-platonic author Marsilio Ficino of Plato&#x27;s dialogues &quot;Ion&quot; and (especially) &quot;Phaedrus&quot; at the end of the 15th century. Tyard distinguished divine inspiration from madness or &quot;alienation&quot; brought on by other causes, and subdivided divine inspiration into four kinds: (1) poetic fury, gift of the Muses; (2) knowledge of religious mysteries, through Bacchus; (3) prophecy and divination through Apollo; (4) inspiration brought on by Venus/Eros.

In his later years he devoted himself to the study of mathematics and philosophy. He became bishop of Chalon-sur-Saône in 1578, and in 1587 published his &quot;Discours philosophiques&quot;. He was a zealous defender of King Henry III of France against the claims of the House of Guise. This attitude led to his persecution; he was driven from Chalon and his château at Bissy-sur-Fley was plundered. Nevertheless, he survived all the other members of the Pléiade and lived to see the onslaught made on their doctrines by François de Malherbe. Pontus resigned his bishopric in 1594, and retired to the Château de Bragny, where he died.
