<text>Fountain of Dreams is a 1990 role-playing video game developed and published by Electronic Arts for DOS as a successor to 1988&#x27;s &quot;Wasteland&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay is similar to that of &quot;Wasteland&quot; since &quot;Fountain of Dreams&quot; was originally intended to be a sequel. It is considered to be &quot;very unforgiving&quot; near the beginning, making it hard to get started in the game without dying.

==Plot==
The game is set in post-nuclear war Florida, physically separated from the continental United States by intensive bombing during World War III that sparked an enormous earthquake. Central Florida itself was hit heavily with neutron and chemical weapons, in order to destroy the life there and preserve the technology. 50 years later after &quot;The Change&quot;, life on the island of Florida is threatened by mutations due to residual ionizing radiation. Adding to the threat are the deranged Killer Clowns, as well as three organized crime factions: the DeSoto Family, the Obeah Orders, and the Bahia Mafia. The player controls a small band of adventurers who set out to find the purifying waters of the legendary &quot;Fountain of Dreams&quot; to stop the spread of mutation.

==Development==
The game was originally intended as a follow-up to &quot;Wasteland&quot;, but neither Interplay nor any of the creative team that created &quot;Wasteland&quot; worked on it. In effect, the game engine is similar, but was created from scratch, and in 2003, Electronic Arts dropped all claims that the game had any connection to &quot;Wasteland&quot;. &quot;Fountain of Dreams&quot; was part of the beginning of a trend at EA to produce in-house sequels to its previous titles.

==Reception==
&quot;Fountain of Dreams&quot; was met with negative reception as it was a much shorter and smaller game than &quot;Wasteland&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1991 described it as inferior to the predecessor, stating it &quot;incorporat[ed] all the worst features of that game, and not much of the good.&quot; The magazine noted that the game had no copy protection, &quot;but then, a product like this probably doesn&#x27;t need any.&quot; In 1993, the magazine called the game &quot;a horrible post-nuke loser&quot; with an &quot;inane plot, ridiculous combat, and terrible ending&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; ranked it as the 41st-worst game of all time, stating &quot;&quot;Wasteland&quot; got stupid as killer clowns, a silly plot, and fear of Disney ruined the sequel.&quot;

<text>SM &quot;U-19&quot; was a German Type U-19 U-boat built for the Imperial German Navy. Her construction was ordered on 25 November 1910, and her keel was laid down on 20 October 1911, at the Kaiserliche Werft Danzig. She was launched on 10 October 1912, and commissioned into the Imperial German Navy on 6 July 1913.

==Service==
From 1 August 1914, to 15 March 1916, &quot;U-19&quot; was commanded by Constantin Kolbe. During this period she had the unfortunate distinction of becoming the first U-boat casualty of World War I when she was rammed by on 24 October 1914. Her hull was badly damaged, but she survived and was repaired.

On 22 January 1915 the &quot;Durward&quot; was near the Maas lightship when they saw &quot;U-19&quot; on the surface. They tried to escape, but as they could only manage 12 knots they were unable to do so. The mate of &quot;Durward&quot;, who was later interviewed by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; special correspondent in Rotterdam related how the second officer, who spoke excellent English, had ordered them to lower a boat and come to talk to them. The captain and crew were given ten minutes to leave the ship. The mate asked the second officer whether he could return to the ship to collect his clothes. He replied &quot;Sorry, old man, it can&#x27;t be done. I am in the mercantile marine myself, having been in the North German Lloyd service but now I am doing a bit for my country.&quot; The commander of the U-boat towed the lifeboat to within 100 yards of the Maas lightship, even stopping at one stage to repair the tow when it parted, after which the crew of &quot;Durward&quot; said goodbye to the submarine and rowed to the lightship.

Kolbe was relieved by Raimund Weisbach, who had previously served as torpedo officer on and had (on Kapitänleutnant Walther Schwieger&#x27;s orders) launched the torpedo that sank . During his brief command, Weisbach carried out an unusual mission: he delivered the revolutionary Roger Casement and two other agents to Banna Strand in Ireland in hopes that they would foment an uprising that would distract the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from World War I.

Weisbach was relieved on 11 August 1916, by Johannes Spiess, who was relieved in turn on 1 June 1917, by Heinrich Koch. Koch turned the boat over on 25 October 1917, to Hans Albrecht Liebeskind, who commanded for less than a month before being relieved on 17 November 1917, by Spiess again. On 1 June 1918, Liebeskind took over again and commanded &quot;U-19&quot; until the end of the war.

&quot;U-19&quot; conducted 12 patrols, sinking 58 ships totalling 99,182 combined tons, including &quot;Santa Maria&quot; (5,383 GRT) off Lough Swilly on 25 February 1918, &quot;Tiberia&quot; (4,880 GRT) off Black Head near Larne on 26 February 1918, and (12,515 GRT) off Rathlin Island on 1 March 1918.

==Fate==

On 11 November 1918, &quot;U-19&quot; was surrendered to the British, and was broken up at Blyth sometime in 1919 or 1920.

The main gun of &quot;U19&quot; was donated to the people of Bangor, Co. Down and today sits near the War Memorial in the town&#x27;s Ward Park. It was donated by the Admiralty in recognition of the valorous conduct of Commander The Hon. Edward Bingham whilst on board while fighting in the Battle of Jutland in July 1916, for which he received the Victoria Cross.

<text>The 3rd Infantry Division (3ID) (nicknamed Rock of the Marne) is a combined arms division of the United States Army based at Fort Stewart, Georgia. It is a subordinate unit of the XVIII Airborne Corps under U.S. Army Forces Command. Its current organization includes a division headquarters and headquarters battalion, two armored brigade combat teams, one aviation brigade, a division artillery, a sustainment brigade and a combat sustainment support battalion along with a maneuver enhancement brigade. The division has a distinguished history, having seen active service in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Global War on Terror. The Medal of Honor has been awarded to 61 members of the 3rd Infantry Division, making the division the most honored in the Army.

The division fought in France in World War I. In World War II, it landed with General Patton&#x27;s task force in a contested amphibious landing on the coast of Morocco, North Africa, overwhelming Vichy French defenders in November 1942. In 1943, the division invaded Sicily in July, and invaded Italy at Salerno in September, before fighting in France and finally Germany. Medal of Honor recipient Audie Murphy, featured in the Hollywood movie &quot;To Hell and Back&quot;, was a member. The division also served in the Korean War. From 1957 until 1996, the division was a major part of the United States Army&#x27;s presence in West Germany as part of the NATO alliance.

==History==
===World War I===

The War Department directed the organization of the 3rd Division on 12 November 1917 at Camp Greene, North Carolina, seven months after the American entry into World War I. Organization began on 21 November 1917, around a nucleus of Regular Army units that had been stationed at Camp Greene, Camp Forrest, Georgia, Camp Shelby, Mississippi, Camps Stanley and Travis, Texas, Camp Stuart, Virginia, Forts Bliss and Clark, Texas, Fort Douglas, Utah, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and Washington Barracks. Training began in late November 1917, and in December 1917 and January 1918, 10,000 draftees predominantly from the northeastern United States (sent from Camp Devens, Massachusetts, Camp Dix, New Jersey, Camp Lee, Virginia, Camp Meade, Maryland, and Camp Upton, New York) completed the division. Advance elements of the division (the 6th Engineers and Train, the advance detachment, and 5th Field Signal Battalion) sailed for France from December 1917 through February 1918, followed by the remainder of the division from March to May 1918.

At midnight on 14 July 1918, the division earned a lasting distinction. Engaged in the Aisne-Marne Offensive as a member of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) to Europe, the division was protecting the French capital of Paris with a position on the banks of the Marne River. The 8th Machine Gun Battalion of the 3rd Division rushed to Château-Thierry amid retreating French troops and held the Germans back at the Marne River. While surrounding units retreated, the 3rd Division, including the 4th, 30th, and 38th Infantry Regiments, remained steadfast throughout the Second Battle of the Marne, and Colonel Ulysses G. McAlexander&#x27;s dogged defense earned the 38th Infantry Regiment its nickname as the &quot;Rock of the Marne&quot;. During the massive attack, the 3rd Infantry Division&#x27;s commanding officer, Major General Joseph T. Dickman, famously cried out &quot;Nous Resterons La&quot; (We Shall Remain Here). Their Blue and White insignia also earned them the nickname &quot;The Blue and White Devils.&quot;&quot; The rest of the division was absorbed under French command until brought back together under the command of Major General Dickman, and by 15 July 1918 they took the brunt of what was to be the last German offensive of the war. General John Joseph &quot;Black Jack&quot; Pershing, Commander-in-chief of the AEF on the Western Front, called this stand &quot;one of the most brilliant pages in the annals of military history&quot;. During the war, two members of the division were awarded the Medal of Honor.

Casualties during the war were 3,177 killed in action with 12,940 wounded.

===Interwar years===

The 3rd Division arrived at Camp Merritt, Hoboken, New Jersey, between 23-28 August 1919, after completing nine months of occupation duty near and in Mayen, Germany. At Camp Merritt, all emergency period personnel were discharged from the service. The division proceeded to Camp Pike, Arkansas, where the headquarters arrived on 31 August 1919. The division remained at Camp Pike until 1921, when it was allotted to the Ninth Corps Area as the IX Corps&#x27; Regular Army infantry division, and was transferred on a permanent change of station to Camp Lewis (later redesignated Fort Lewis), Washington, where it arrived in September of that year. The division’s units were ordered to posts throughout the western United States and Alaska in fall 1921 and early 1922. The division headquarters and special troops remained at Camp Lewis.

The 5th Infantry Brigade moved its headquarters to Vancouver Barracks, Washington, and its subordinate units to posts in Washington, North Dakota, and Alaska. The 6th Infantry Brigade was headquartered at Fort Douglas, Utah, as was the 38th Infantry Regiment, while the 30th Infantry Regiment was stationed at the Presidio of San Francisco, California. The 3rd Field Artillery Brigade&#x27;s units were located at Camp Lewis with the exception of the 76th Field Artillery Regiment, which was split between Fort D.A. Russell, Wyoming, and the Presidio of Monterey, California. The division’s units usually conducted the training of Organized Reserve units, Citizens Military Training Camp participants, and ROTC cadets at various posts throughout the Ninth Corps Area during the summer months. The officers of the IX Corps, XIX Corps, and the 91st, 96th, and 104th Divisions were habitually trained at the Organized Reserve camps. By the mid-1920s, the division headquarters had nearly ceased to exist, with only the division commander and a few staff officers remaining to carry out essential functions; they did not exercise a true command function over their units. By 1926, the War Department and the Ninth Corps Area realized the unsustainability of the situation and repopulated the 3rd Division headquarters.

Training of divisional units took place for the most part in the late summer and early fall after they assisted the training of the Reserve components. The largest concentration of division units since 1921 occurred in April 1927 when all units, except the 6th Infantry Brigade, were assembled at Camp Lewis for division maneuvers. The next major training event for the division came in August 1931 when much of the “Marne” Division (not including the 5th Infantry Brigade and parts of the 3rd Field Artillery Brigade), was assembled at the Gigling Military Reservation in California to maneuver against the 11th Cavalry Regiment. The first opportunity to assemble the entire division came in April 1937 when all elements, except one battalion in Alaska, converged on Fort Lewis for division maneuvers. Oddly, three months later the division did not participate in the Fourth Army maneuvers as a complete unit, but was split between Fort Lewis and Camp Ord, California. The 3rd Division reorganized into the “triangular” configuration in October 1939, with the 4th and 38th Infantry Regiments relieved, the 15th Infantry Regiment assigned, and the field artillery, engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments subsequently reorganized into battalions. 

Beginning in December 1939, the division participated in numerous training exercises to better prepare it for impending war. That month, the entire “Marne” Division deployed to California for amphibious operations at Monterey and maneuver training at Camp Ord to test the new triangular organization. After the exercises in California, the division returned to Fort Lewis to participate in the Fourth Army maneuvers near Fort Lewis and Centralia, Washington, in August 1940. In April 1941, the “Marne” Division participated in the IX Corps maneuver at Fort Lewis, operating against the National Guard 41st Division. The following month, the division moved to Hunter Liggett Military Reservation, California, to participate in the Fourth Army maneuver there, which pitted the IX Corps against the III Corps. The 3rd Division returned to Fort Lewis in July and there participated in another Fourth Army maneuver, again in the vicinity of Fort Lewis-Centralia, in August–September 1941.

==== Combat chronicle ====

The 3rd Division is the only division of the U.S. Army during World War II that fought the Axis on all European fronts, and was among the first American combat units to engage in offensive ground combat operations. Audie Murphy, the most highly decorated American soldier of the war, served with the 3rd Division. The 3rd Infantry Division saw combat in North Africa, Sicily, Italy, France, Germany and Austria for 531 consecutive days. During the war, the 3rd Infantry Division consisted of the 7th, 15th and 30th Infantry Regiments, together with supporting units.

==== Chips ====
The 3rd Infantry Division also had a German Shepherd, Border Collie and Siberian Husky-mix war dog named &quot;Chips&quot; from Pleasantville, New York given to them by the Dogs for Defense program. He was assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division from October 1942 until he was discharged in December 1945, serving on a variety of missions including the Algerian-Moroccan, Tunisian, Sicilian, Rhineland and Central Europe Campaigns. 

The 3rd Division, under the command of Major General Jonathan W. Anderson, after spending many months training in the United States after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, first saw action during the war as a part of the Western Task Force in Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, landing at Fedala on 8 November 1942, and captured half of French Morocco. The division remained there for the next few months and therefore took no part in the Tunisian Campaign, which came to an end in May 1943 with the surrender of almost 250,000 Axis soldiers who subsequently became prisoners of war (POWs). While there, a battalion of the 30th Infantry Regiment acted as security guards during the Casablanca Conference in mid-January 1943 with Chips as one of the guard dogs. Some soldiers say that Chips saved lives before the conference took place by sniffing out a time bomb set up by enemy saboteurs. In late February, Major General Anderson left the division to return to the United States and command the X Corps, and was replaced by Major General Lucian K. Truscott, Jr., who had formerly been on the staff of the commander-in-chief of Allied forces in North Africa. Truscott instituted a tough training regime and ensured that all ranks in the division could march five miles in one hour, and four miles an hour thereafter; the troops called it &quot;the Truscott Trot&quot;. The division began intensive training in amphibious landing operations.

On 10 July 1943, the division made another amphibious assault landing on the Italian island of Sicily (codenamed Operation Husky), at Licata, a town on the beach, with Torre di Gaffi and Mollarella to the west, and, to the east, Falconara. During the invasion, a platoon of soldiers from the 30th Infantry Regiment, accompanied by Chips, moved inland into the Sicilian countryside when they got ambushed by Italian mortar and machine gun fire. Cut off from the rest of the regiment by Italian skirmishes and the field telephone line cut from the bombardment, the platoon fought hard until Chips, ordered by his handler Pvt. John P. Rowell, ran back to HQ with a phone line to restore communication while dodging enemy fire. Chips ran back through enemy fire as he returned to his handler and the platoon received word that reinforcements were on their way. Meanwhile, another Italian machine gun team made their way around the rear of the platoon and opened fire. The platoon leader sent a lone American soldier to take out the enemy machine-gun (MG) nest. But when he was pinned down, Chips broke free from his handler and ran toward the MG nest, jumped in and attacked the Italian soldiers manning the gun. Pvt. Rowell and the other soldier ran to help Chips and the gunners were forced to surrender. Chips sustained a scalp wound and gunpowder burns from the explosions. After his honorable discharge in 1945, Chips returned to New York to spend the rest of his days at home with his civilian family, the Wrens. He died about a year after returning home, as a result of injuries suffered during the war. 

Later, the 3rd Infantry Division, serving under the command of Lieutenant General George S. Patton&#x27;s U.S. Seventh Army, fought its way into Palermo before elements of the 2nd Armored Division could get there, in the process marching 90 miles in three days, and raced on to capture Messina on 17 August 1943, thus ending the brief Sicilian campaign, where the division had a short rest to absorb replacements. During the campaign, the 3rd Division gained a reputation as one of the best divisions in the Seventh Army.

Eight days after the Allied invasion of mainland Italy, on 18 September 1943, the 3rd Division came ashore at Salerno, where they came under the command of VI Corps, under Major General Ernest J. Dawley who was replaced two days later by Major General John P. Lucas (who had commanded the division from September 1941 to March 1942). The corps was part of Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark&#x27;s U.S. Fifth Army. The 3rd Division was destined to see some of the fiercest and toughest fighting of the war thus far, serving on the Italian Front. Seeing intensive action along the way, the division drove to and across the Volturno River by October 1943, and then to Monte Cassino, where the Battle of Monte Cassino would later be fought, before, with the rest of the 15th Army Group, being held up at the Winter Line (also known as the Gustav Line). In mid-November the division, after spearheading the Fifth Army&#x27;s advance and suffering heavy casualties during the past few weeks, was relieved by the 36th Infantry Division and pulled out of the line to rest and absorb replacements, coming under the command of Major General Geoffrey Keyes&#x27; II Corps. The division remained out of action until late December.

After a brief rest, the division was part of the amphibious landing at Anzio, codenamed Operation Shingle, on 22 January 1944, still as part of VI Corps, and serving alongside the British 1st Infantry Division and other units. It would remain there for just over four months in a toe-hold against numerous furious German counterattacks, and enduring trench warfare similar to that suffered on the Western Front during World War I. On 29 February 1944, the 3rd Division fought off an attack by three German divisions, who fell back with heavy losses two days later. In a single day of combat at Anzio, the 3rd Infantry Division suffered more than 900 casualties, the most of any American division on one day in World War II. The division&#x27;s former commander, Major General Lucas, was replaced as commander of VI Corps by the 3rd Infantry Division&#x27;s commander, Major General Truscott; he was replaced in command of the division by Brigadier General (later Major General) John W. &quot;Iron Mike&quot; O&#x27;Daniel, previously the assistant division commander (ADC) and a distinguished World War I veteran.

In late May, VI Corps broke out of the Anzio beachhead in Operation Diadem with the 3rd Division in the main thrust. Instead of defeating the Germans, Lieutenant General Clark, the Fifth Army commander, disobeying orders from General Sir Harold Alexander, Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the Allied Armies in Italy (formerly the 15th Army Group), sent the division on to the Italian capital of Rome. This allowed the majority of the German 10th Army, which would otherwise have been trapped, to escape, thus prolonging the campaign in Italy. The division was then removed from the front line and went into training for the Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of Southern France.

On 15 August 1944, D-Day for Dragoon, the division, still under VI Corps command but now under the U.S. Seventh Army, landed at St. Tropez, advanced up the Rhone Valley, through the Vosges Mountains, and reached the Rhine at Strasbourg, 26–27 November 1944. After maintaining defensive positions it took part in clearing the Colmar Pocket on 23 January, and on 15 March struck against Siegfried Line positions south of Zweibrücken. The division advanced through the defenses and crossed the Rhine, on 26 March 1945; then drove on to take Nuremberg in a fierce battle, capturing the city in block-by-block fighting, 17–20 April. The 3rd pushed on to take Augsburg where it liberated thousands of forced laborers from the Augsburg concentration camp, a forced labor subcamp of Dachau, and Munich, 27–30 April, and was in the vicinity of Salzburg when the war in Europe ended. Elements of the 7th Infantry Regiment serving under the 3rd Infantry Division captured Hitler&#x27;s retreat near Berchtesgaden.

During the Korean War, the division was known as the &quot;Fire Brigade&quot; for its rapid response to the crisis. 3rd Infantry Division had been headquartered at Fort Benning along with its 15th Infantry Regiment. The 7th Infantry Regiment was located at Fort Devens. 3rd Infantry Division initially arrived in Japan where, as the Far East Command Reserve, it planned post-conflict occupation missions in northern Korea. In Japan their strength was increased by augmentation by South Korean soldiers. The division was assigned to X Corps and landed at Wonsan on the east coast of Korea on 5 November and received the 65th Infantry Regiment as their third maneuver element before moving north to Hungnam and Majon-dong. At Majon-dong they established a defensive position with the 65th Infantry. 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 7th Infantry were on the left flank. The 15th Infantry was between the 7th and 65th Regiments. 3rd Battalion, 7th Infantry was set as the nucleus for Task Force Dog which was commanded by Brigadier General Armistead D. Mead, assistant 3rd Division commander and sent north to conduct a relief in place with 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment at Chinhung-ni; the south end of the 1st Marine Division and support the withdrawal of 1st Marine Division and Regimental Combat Team 31 from the fighting at the Chosin Reservoir. 3rd Infantry Division&#x27;s Task Force Dog was the rearguard keeping the pressure off of the Marine column. The division along with the 7th Infantry Division established a collapsing perimeter around the port of Hungnam until the last of X Corps was evacuated. The division was the last unit to leave Hungnam and was shipped to Pusan where it completed unloading on 30 December and moved north to Kyongju and on 31 December it was placed in Eighth Army reserve for reorganization and reequipping following which it was to move into the Pyongtaek-Ansong area. The division was then transferred to the US I Corps.

In January 1953 the division was transferred from I Corps. The division served in Korea until 1953 when it was withdrawn. Notably, the division fought at the Chorwon-Kumwha area, Jackson Heights and Arrowhead outposts and blocked a push in the Kumsong Area in July 1953.

The 3rd Infantry Division received ten Battle Stars. Eleven more members of the unit received Medals of Honor during the Korean War. Eight were from the 7th Infantry Regiment: Jerry K. Crump (6 and 7 September 1951), John Essebagger, Jr. (25 April 1951), Charles L. Gilliland (25 April 1951), Clair Goodblood (24 and 25 April 1951), Noah O. Knight (23 and 24 November 1951), Darwin K. Kyle (16 February 1951), Leroy A. Mendonca (4 July 1951), and Hiroshi H. Miyamura, whose award was classified Top Secret until his repatriation (24 and 25 April 1951). Three more recipients were with the 15th Infantry Regiment: Emory L. Bennett (24 June 1951), Ola L. Mize (10 and 11 June 1953) and Charles F. Pendleton (16 and 17 July 1953).

During the Korean War, the division had 2,160 killed in action and 7,939 wounded.

After the armistice, the division remained in Korea until 1954 when it was reduced to near zero strength, the colors were transferred to Fort Benning, Georgia and, in December 1954, the 47th Infantry Division was reflagged as the Third. 

On 1 July 1957, the division was reorganized as a Pentomic Division. The division&#x27;s three infantry regiments (the 7th, 15th and 30th) were inactivated, with their elements reorganized into five infantry battle groups (the 1-7 IN, 1-15 IN, 1-30 IN, 2-38 IN and the 2-4 IN). 
In April 1958, the division deployed to Germany as part of an Operation Gyroscope rotation (soldiers and families, no equipment), switching places with the 10th Infantry Division (which was reflagged as the 2nd Infantry Division upon its arrival at Fort Benning). 
In 1963, the division was reorganized as a Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD). Three Brigade Headquarters were activated and Infantry units were reorganized into battalions.

===Cold War to the Millennium (1953 through 2000)===

The division was stationed with the V Corps (1958–63, 1992-1996) and VII Corps (1963–92) in West Germany from near the Czech border westward throughout various towns including Würzburg (Div. Hq. &amp; Support Command), Schweinfurt (1st Brigade), Kitzingen (2nd Brigade), and Aschaffenburg (3rd Brigade). In August 1961, a few days after the Berlin Wall was erected, a reinforced company from the 7th Infantry Regiment (a unit of the 3rd Infantry Division) in full battle gear, was ordered to travel along the Autobahn (a major highway) from Aschaffenburg in Bavaria to West Berlin. This was to assert the right of US forces to travel unhindered from West Germany across the western part of East Germany to West Berlin. After the Berlin Wall was built, it was not known if the East German forces would attempt to impede or restrict the movement of US troops when crossing East Germany while trying to reach West Berlin. The unit arrived in West Berlin without incident confirming the right of free passage.

In November 1990, following Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait, more than 6,000 3rd Infantry Division men and women deployed with the 1st Armored Division on Operation Desert Storm as part of the Allied Coalition. They participated in the Battle of Medina Ridge which was the second-largest tank battle of the conflict. The 3rd Brigade was credited with the destruction of 82 tanks, 31 Armored Personnel Carriers, 11 artillery pieces, 48 trucks, 3 AAA guns and captured 72 EPW&#x27;s with the loss of 2 Bradley Cavalry vehicles, 30 WIA&#x27;s and 1 KIA. 

Later nearly 1,000 soldiers(one unit-I co. 3rd Aviation Support, 3rd ID) deployed to southeastern Turkey and northern Iraq in Operation Provide Comfort to help Kurdish refugees. 

In late Spring of 1991, the division supplied senior ranking officers and non-commissioned officers, along with a military police company to Task Force Victory (Forward). Stationed in Kuwait the Task Force was to provide division-level support to the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (which shared the same duty station). Those elements of V Corps attached to the task force (including those of the division) returned to their home units in early September 1991.

As part of the Army&#x27;s reduction to a ten-division force, the 24th Infantry Division was inactivated on 15 February 1996, and reflagged to become the 3rd Infantry Division.

In 1996 the division was redeployed to Fort Stewart, Fort Benning, and Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia. The division repeatedly demonstrated its deployability since then by maintaining a battalion, and later a brigade task force presence in Kuwait. It has also moved sizable forces to Egypt, Bosnia and Kosovo in partnership training and peacekeeping missions.

In 1996–97, the 3rd Infantry Division Detachment, Rear Tactical Operations Center (RTOC), which is a unit manned by the Georgia Army National Guard was mobilized and served in Operation Joint Endeavor. During this time, the 3rd ID RTOC served under the 1st Infantry Division and later the 1st Armored Division. Respectively serving in Bosnia, at Camps Dallas and Angela, near Tuzla under the 1ID, and then in Croatia at Slavonski Brod, under the 1AD, serving as the Assistant Division Commander for Support, then BG George Casey.

====OIF I (Baghdad Spearhead)====
Early in 2003, the entire division deployed in weeks to Kuwait. It was called on subsequently to spearhead Coalition forces in Operation Iraqi Freedom, fighting its way to Baghdad in early April, leading to the end of the Saddam Hussein government. The First Brigade captured the Baghdad International Airport and cleared and secured the airport, which also resulted in the division&#x27;s first Medal of Honor since the Korean War, awarded to SFC Paul Ray Smith. Second Brigade, Third Infantry division made the much-publicized &quot;Thunder Run&quot; into downtown Baghdad. The Second Brigade was redeployed to Fallujah, Iraq during the summer of 2003. The division returned to the United States in September 2003.

::::1st Battalion, 39th Field Artillery Regiment, 3rd ID DIVARTY, MLRS - Inactivated May, 2006
:::3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment
Beginning in 2004, the 3rd began re-organizing. The division shifted from three maneuver brigades to four &quot;units of action&quot;, which are essentially smaller brigade formations, with one infantry, one armor, one cavalry, and one artillery battalion in each. The former Engineer Brigade became the 4th Brigade at Fort Stewart. Each of these units of action engaged in several mock battles at the National Training Center and Joint Readiness Training Center, and preparation for a second deployment to Iraq.

====OIF III====

In January 2005, the Third Infantry Division became the first Army division to serve a second tour in Iraq. The division headquarters took control of the Multi-National Division Baghdad, MND-B, headquartered at Camp Liberty and with responsibility for the greater Baghdad area. The First and Third Brigades of the Third Infantry Division were placed under the control of the 42nd Infantry Division, and later under the 101st Airborne Division, in MND-North. In preparation for this deployment, a Fourth Brigade was organized and became the first cohesive brigade combat team sent into a combat zone by the US Army, cohesive in that it fulfilled the table of organization requirement of such a unit. The California Army National Guard&#x27;s 1st Battalion 184th Infantry Regiment served as one of the brigade&#x27;s two infantry battalions, as well as the detachment from the Hawaii Army National Guard&#x27;s 29th Brigade Combat Team, the 2/299th Infantry, also the 48th Brigade Combat Team from the Georgia Army National Guard, 2/130 Infantry Battalion of the Illinois National Guard, and Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 295th Infantry Battalion from the Puerto Rico Army National Guard served in this Operation.

2/69 Armor was assigned to Camp War Horse in Iraq. By Mid 2005 Primary elements of the 2/69 Armor 3rd Brigade 3rd Infantry Division was redeployed to Ramadi Iraq, replacing elements of the 2nd ID. They ran joint missions with 2nd Mar Div. and elements of the Pennsylvania National Guard and the 2/130th Infantry of the Illinois National Guard was redeployed to Al Taquattum as the infantry battalion.

3/15 Infantry Battalion was assigned to FOB Hope, a small forward operating base opposite the northeast corner of Sadr City in Baghdad. By late 2005 Task Force 3/15 left FOB Hope and rejoined the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, BCT, at Camp Liberty.

====OIF V====
The division redeployed to Fort Stewart and Fort Benning in January 2006. On 17 November 2006, the Army announced that the Third Infantry Division is scheduled to return to Iraq in 2007 and thus become the first Army division to serve three tours in Iraq. The division headquarters became the leading organization of MND-C (Multi-National Division Central), a new command established south of Baghdad as part of the Iraq War troop surge of 2007.

In support of operations in Baghdad, the unit 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry was detached from 3ID and assigned by General Petraeus to 3rd BCT, 82nd Airborne who was under the command of the 1st Cavalry Division. In 2008, the 82nd Airborne and 1st CAV redeployed home, and 3–7 CAV was handed over to 3rd BCT, 4th Infantry Division under the command of the 25th Infantry Division. They would remain under this command until 3–7 CAV&#x27;s redeployment back to Fort Stewart, being reattached to the 3rd Infantry Division. Similarly, 1st Battalion, 64th Armor was detached from 3ID and attached to 2nd BCT, 1st Infantry Division under 1st Cavalry Division, and later under 2nd BCT, 101st Infantry Division under command of 4th Infantry Division.
====Reassignment of 1st Brigade====
In the fall of 2008, the 3rd Infantry Division&#x27;s 1st Brigade was assigned to serve as the on-call federal response force under the control of NORTHCOM, the combatant command assigned responsibility for the continental United States. The brigade remained at its home station of Fort Stewart, Georgia, and &quot;is training to deploy domestically in response to terrorist attacks or other national emergencies.&quot; The brigade will be trained in responding to WMD attacks, crowd control, and dealing with civil unrest.

The force was renamed &quot;Chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or high-yield explosive Consequence Management Response Force&quot;. Its acronym, CCMRF, is pronounced &quot;see-smurf&quot;, and the unit is now under the daily control of United States Northern Command&#x27;s Army North, whose mission is to &quot;protect the United States homeland and support local, state, and federal authorities.&quot; The unit is a multi-branch force with servicemembers from the four branches of the United States Department of Defense.

====Reorganization of 4th Brigade====
In March 2009, 4th Brigade reorganized from a mechanized or heavy brigade to a light infantry brigade. As part of this reorganization, 4th Battalion, 64th Armor was reflagged as 3rd Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment.

====OIF VII====

The 3rd Infantry Division assumed command of the Multi-National Division-North, now United States Division-North, in October 2009. This milestone marked the division&#x27;s fourth tour in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (I, III, V, and VII). The division has elements operating in every area of Iraq as the mission changes from Operation Iraqi Freedom to Operation New Dawn on 1 September 2010. With the advent of Operation New Dawn, the focus will shift from combat operations to stability and advise and assist operations throughout all Iraq&#x27;s provinces.

In the course of Operation Iraqi Freedom up until 24 September 2010, 436 members of the division were killed in action

====Operation Enduring Freedom====

The Combat Aviation Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division deployed to Afghanistan for a 13-month tour. The brigade was the first unit from 3ID to deploy to Afghanistan. During that tour 3rd CAB soldiers flew about 26,000 missions, including 800 air assaults, and were responsible for about 2,500 enemy casualties.
3rd CAB is slated to deploy to Afghanistan again in January 2013. The 2500 soldiers will deploy with the 3rd Special Troops Battalion for a 9-month tour. The Marne Air will be operating out of Kandahar Airfield in the RC-South area of operations, relieving the 25th CAB.

Both the 3rd CAB and 3rd STB will fall under their parent division when the 3ID Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion deploys in August and takes over command of RC-South from 82nd Airborne Division HQ.

The 2nd Heavy BCT&#x27;s two combined-arms battalions were also deployed individually to Afghanistan. 1st Battalion, 64th Armor Regiment deployed in March 2012. They are attached to the 3rd Stryker Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division (United States) from Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA, to help train Afghanistan National Security Forces to take over their country&#x27;s security operations. 1st Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment deployed a month earlier. They are tasked with providing security to units conducting contingency operations. Both battalions will serve nine-month tour.

In December 2012, the 3rd Sustainment Brigade deployed for its fifth deployment over the last decade and first to Afghanistan, for nine months in support of Operation Enduring Freedom 12–13, let by COL Ron Novack and CSM Daniels. Deployed to Kandahar with 276 soldiers the brigade provided sustainment and retrograde support to the 3rd and 4th Infantry Divisions, 1st and 2nd Marine Expeditionary Forces, and International Security Assistance Forces operating in Regional Commands South, Southwest, and National Support Element-West. The brigade assisted in the closure and transfer of over 61 Forward Operating Bases while simultaneously providing sustainment to the force. Additionally, the 3rd Sustainment Brigade provided direct support to the 1st and 2nd Brigade Combat Teams and the Combat Aviation Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division.

In February 2013, the 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division (later reflagged as the 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division), deployed to Logar Province and Wardak Province, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. 6th Squadron, 8th Cavalry Regiment was tasked with securing Logar Province, and disrupting the almost daily rocket attacks on Forward Operation Base Shank. 3rd Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment was tasked with securing Wardak Province&#x27;s highly volatile Highway 1. The soldiers of 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division returned home in late November 2013 after serving a 9-month tour.

====Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel====
In April 2017, &quot;Military.com&quot; reported that about 200 soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Division Headquarters will deploy to Afghanistan to replace the 1st Cavalry Division Headquarters at Bagram Airfield taking over command of the U.S. Forces-Afghanistan&#x27;s National Support Element, as part of Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel.

Starting in December 2018 troops of the Georgia Army National Guard&#x27;s 48th IBCT of the 3rd Infantry Division were deployed in support of NATO operations in Afghanistan. These missions included train, advising, assist missions for the Afghanistan military as well as attaching infantry units from the 3rd Battalion, 121st Infantry Regiment to Army Special Forces ODAs and other Special Operations forces.

===Operation Atlantic Resolve===
In February 2015, &quot;ArmyTimes&quot; reported that More than 3,000 soldiers from the 1st Heavy Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Combat Aviation Brigade, 3rd ID&#x27;s Artillery and other units of the 3rd Infantry Division began an accumulative of 12 months deployment to Europe in March 2015 in support of Operation Atlantic Resolve. Soldiers from 3rd ID deployed to various European countries including Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Bulgaria with the 1st Brigade acting as the European Rotational Force and NATO Response Force, which works and trains with NATO allies to remain prepared for contingency operations within the European Command&#x27;s area of responsibility.

== Organization ==

The 3rd Infantry Division consists of a division headquarters battalion, two armored brigade combat teams, a division artillery headquarters, a division sustainment brigade, and a combat aviation brigade.

The 2nd Brigade Combat Team was inactivated on 15 January 2015 as part of the Army&#x27;s modular brigade reorganization. Special Troops Battalion; 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment; 1st Battalion, 9th Field Artillery Regiment; and 26th Brigade Support Battalion were inactivated concurrently, with some of their companies joining other brigades&#x27; battalions. The maneuver battalions of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team moved to other brigades in the division: 1st Battalion, 64th Armor Regiment moved to the 1st Brigade Combat Team and the 1st Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment moved to the 4th Brigade Combat Team. With the inactivation of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, the 4th Brigade Combat Team was reflagged as the 2nd Brigade Combat Team. After the reorganization, the division had three BCTs, each with three maneuver battalions.

The 42nd Fires Brigade was activated at Fort Stewart on 17 October 2013 and later reflagged as 3rd Infantry Division Artillery. Division Artillery has training oversight of the division&#x27;s artillery battalions, although the battalions remain organic to their respective BCTs.

As part of budget-driven downsizing, the Army announced that it would inactivate the 3rd Brigade Combat Team by the end of 2015 and replace it with a Battalion Task Force centered around the 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry. The 3rd Brigade Combat Team was inactivated on 15 December 2015.

<doc id="165289" wikidata="Q271189" url="?curid=165289" title="Hercules (1997 film)">
<text>Hercules is a 1997 American animated musical fantasy comedy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation for Walt Disney Pictures. It is loosely based on the legendary hero Heracles (known in the film by his Roman name, Hercules), a son of Zeus in Greek mythology. The film was directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, both of whom also produced the film with Alice Dewey Goldstone. The screenplay was written by Clements, Musker, Donald McEnery, Bob Shaw, and Irene Mecchi. Featuring the voices of Tate Donovan, Danny DeVito, James Woods, and Susan Egan, the film follows the titular Hercules, a demigod with super-strength raised among mortals, who must learn to become a true hero in order to earn back his godhood and place in Mount Olympus, while his evil uncle Hades plots his downfall.

Development of &quot;Hercules&quot; began in 1992 following a pitch adaptation of the Heracles mythological stories by animator Joe Haidar. Meanwhile, Clements and Musker re-developed their idea for &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; (2002) following the critical and commercial success of &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992). Their project was removed from development in 1993, and Musker and Clements joined &quot;Hercules&quot; later that same year. Following an unused treatment by Haidar, Clements and Musker studied multiple interpretations of Greek mythology before abandoning Zeus&#x27;s adulterous affair with Alcmene. The project underwent multiple story treatments and a first script draft was inspired by the screwball comedy films of the classic Hollywood era and popular culture of the 1990s. During production, McEnery, Shaw, and Mecchi were brought on board to revise Musker and Clements&#x27; script. British cartoonist Gerald Scarfe was recruited as production designer and produced over seven hundred visualization designs of the characters. Research trips to Greece and Turkey provided inspiration for the background designs. Animation for the film was done in California and Paris. Computer animation was used in several scenes, predominantly in the Hydra battle sequence. The production budget was $85 million.

&quot;Hercules&quot; was released on June 13, 1997, and received generally positive reviews from film critics, with James Woods&#x27;s performance as Hades receiving particular praise, but the animation (particularly the visual style) and music received a mixed response. The film under-performed in its theatrical release notably in comparison to previous animated Disney films, ultimately earning $252.7 million in box office revenue worldwide. &quot;Hercules&quot; was later followed by &quot;Hercules: The Animated Series&quot;, a syndicated Disney television series focusing on Hercules during his time at the Prometheus Academy, and the direct-to-video prequel &quot;&quot; (1999), which consists of four episodes from the TV series.

==Plot==

In Ancient Greece, the gods Zeus and Hera have a son named Hercules. While the other gods are joyful, Zeus&#x27; wicked brother Hades plots to overthrow Zeus and rule Mount Olympus. Through the Fates, Hades learns that in eighteen years, a planetary alignment will allow him to free the Titans to conquer Olympus, but only if Hercules does not interfere. Hades sends his minions, Pain and Panic, to murder Hercules, providing them with a potion that can strip a god of immortality. The two kidnap the baby and feed him the potion, but a married farmer couple pass nearby, causing the demons to flee before Hercules could drink every last drop; therefore he is only stripped of immortality but retains his god-like strength. The couple adopt Hercules and Pain and Panic decide not to report their failure to Hades.

Years later, the teenage Hercules becomes an outcast for his inability to control his strength. Wondering about his origins, he decides to visit the Temple of Zeus for answers. There, a statue of Zeus comes to life and reveals all to Hercules, telling him that he can earn back his godhood by becoming a &quot;true hero.&quot; Zeus sends Hercules and his forgotten childhood friend Pegasus to the satyr Philoctetes (&quot;Phil&quot;) who is known for training heroes. After completing the training, Phil and Hercules travel to Thebes, so he can prove himself there as a hero. On the way, they meet Megara (&quot;Meg&quot;), a sarcastic damsel whom Hercules saves from the centaur Nessus. Unbeknownst to Hercules, Meg is Hades&#x27; slave due to selling her soul to him to save her boyfriend, who eventually left her for another woman. When Meg mentions Hercules to Hades, he realizes Pain and Panic&#x27;s failure and plots to finish off Hercules properly.

Hades stages an accident with the disguised Pain and Panic to lure Hercules into a fight with the Hydra. Hercules defeats the monster, earning the respect and admiration of the Thebans. He defeats many other monsters afterward, each of them sent by Hades, and becomes a celebrated hero. However, Zeus tells him that he is not yet a &quot;true&quot; hero but refuses to explain what that means. Saddened and frustrated, Hercules spends a day out with Meg, during which they fall in love with each other. Realizing this, Hades, on the eve of his takeover, holds Meg hostage and offers her freedom in exchange for Hercules surrendering his strength. On the condition that Meg will be unharmed, Hercules accepts but is heartbroken after learning that Meg was working for Hades all along.

Hades unleashes the Titans, who defeat the gods on Olympus, while the Cyclops goes to Thebes to kill Hercules. Hercules uses his wits to defeat the Cyclops. During the battle, Meg is mortally injured while saving Hercules from a falling pillar. This breaks Hades&#x27;s deal, so Hercules regains his strength. Hercules and Pegasus fly to Olympus, free the gods and vanquish the Titans, but Meg dies from her injuries.

To recover Meg&#x27;s soul, Hercules goes to the underworld and risks his life by leaping into the River Styx. This act restores his godhood and immortality, so he is able to reach Meg&#x27;s soul and climb out alive. Hercules punches Hades into the Styx, where he is dragged to its depths by vengeful souls. After reviving Meg, she and Hercules are summoned to Olympus, where Zeus and Hera welcome him home, saying he has proved himself a &quot;true hero&quot; through the &quot;strength of his heart&quot;. However, rather than joining the gods, Hercules chooses to remain on Greece with Meg, and he deactivates his god powers to show this. Returning to Thebes, they watch Zeus form a constellation in Hercules&#x27; honor, much to Phil&#x27;s happiness.

==Voice cast==
* Tate Donovan as Hercules, a powerful demigod based on the mythological deity Heracles. Supervising animator Andreas Deja described Hercules as &quot;...not a smart aleck, not streetwise, he&#x27;s just a naive kid trapped in a big body&quot;, and claimed that Donovan &quot;had a charming yet innocent quality in his readings&quot;. Donovan had not done any voice-over work prior to &quot;Hercules&quot;. Deja integrated Donovan&#x27;s &quot;charming yet innocent quality&quot; into Hercules&#x27; expressions.
** Josh Keaton provided the speaking voice of Hercules as a teenager, while Roger Bart provided his singing voice. Originally, Keaton also provided his singing voice, but his singing was re-recorded by Bart. Randy Haycock served as the supervising animator for Hercules as an infant and teenager.
* Danny DeVito as Philoctetes/Phil, a crotchety, old Satyr (half-man, half-goat) who served as a trainer of heroes in Ancient Greece, most notably Achilles and the powerful demigod, Hercules. Eric Goldberg, the supervising animator for Philoctetes, cited Grumpy in &quot;Snow White&quot; and Bacchus in &quot;Fantasia&quot; as the inspirations for the character&#x27;s design. Goldberg mentioned that they discovered that Danny DeVito &quot;has really different mouth shapes&quot; when they videotaped his recordings and that they used these shapes in animating Phil.
* James Woods as Hades, Hercules&#x27; uncle and Zeus&#x27; brother who is the ruler of the Underworld. Producer Alice Dewey mentioned that Hades &quot;was supposed to talk in a slow and be menacing in a quiet, spooky way&quot;, but thought that Woods&#x27; manner of speaking &quot;a mile a minute&quot; would be a &quot;great take&quot; for a villain. Woods did a lot of ad-libbing in his recordings, especially in Hades&#x27; dialogues with Megara. Nik Ranieri, the supervising animator for Hades, mentioned that the character was &quot;based on a Hollywood agent, a car salesman type&quot;, and that a lot came from Woods&#x27; ad-libbed dialogue. He went on to say that the hardest part in animating Hades was that he talks too much and too fast, so much so that &quot;it took [him] two weeks to animate a one-second scene&quot;. Ranieri watched Woods&#x27; other films and used what he saw as the basis for Hades&#x27; sneer. 
* Susan Egan as Megara, Hercules&#x27; love interest and Hades&#x27; former servant. Supervising animator Ken Duncan stated that she was &quot;based on a &#x27;40s screwball comedienne&quot; and that he used Greek shapes for her hair (&quot;Her head is in sort of a vase shape and she&#x27;s got a Greek curl in the back.&quot;).
* Rip Torn as Zeus, king of the gods and Hercules&#x27; birth father.
* Samantha Eggar as Hera, queen of the gods and Hercules&#x27; birth mother.
* Lillias White, Cheryl Freeman, LaChanze, Roz Ryan and Vaneese Thomas as the Muses (Calliope, Melpomene, Terpsichore, Thalia and Clio respectively), the narrators of the film&#x27;s story. Michael Show served as the supervising animator for the Muses.
* Bobcat Goldthwait and Matt Frewer as Pain and Panic, Hades&#x27; henchmen. James Lopez and Brian Ferguson respectively served as the supervising animators for Pain and Panic.
* Patrick Pinney as the Cyclops. Dominique Monfrey served as the supervising animator for the Cyclops.
* Hal Holbrook and Barbara Barrie as Amphitryon and Alcmene, Hercules&#x27; adoptive parents. Richard Bazley served as the supervising animator for both characters.
* Amanda Plummer, Carole Shelley and Paddi Edwards as Clotho, Lachesis, Atropos, the three Fates who predict Hades&#x27; failed attempt to conquer Olympus. Nancy Beiman served as the supervising animator for the three characters.
* Paul Shaffer as Hermes. Michael Swofford served as the animator for Hermes.
* Jim Cummings as Nessus. Chris Bailey served as the animator for Nessus. Cummings also voiced the Tall Theban and the Elderly Theban. 
* Wayne Knight as Demetrius
*Mary Kay Bergman as the Earthquake Lady
*Corey Burton as the Burnt Man
* Kathleen Freeman as the Heavyset Woman
* Keith David as Apollo
* Charlton Heston has a cameo role as the opening narrator.
* Frank Welker as Pegasus. Ellen Woodbury served as the supervising animator for Pegasus.

==Production==

===Development===
In early 1992, thirty artists, writers, and animators pitched their ideas for potential animated features, each given a limited time of two minutes. The first pitch was for an adaptation of &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, which entered into production in the following summer. However, production on the film was abandoned because it was deemed too long, lacked central characters, and failed to translate into animated comedy. Animator Joe Haidar also suggested pitching a story from Greek mythology, but thought his chances plummeted when work on &quot;The Odyssey&quot; was discontinued. Nervously, he produced a pitch sketch of Hercules, and delivered a brief outline set during the Trojan War where both sides seek the title character for their secret weapon. Hercules makes a choice, without considering the consequences, though in the end, he learns humility and realizes that strength is not always the answer. With the pitching session concluded, &quot;Hercules&quot; was approved for development based on Haidar&#x27;s page-and-a-half outline, but his involvement with the project went no further.

In November 1992, following the success of &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992), directors Ron Clements and John Musker re-developed &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; up until fall 1993. &quot;Aladdin&quot; co-screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio subsequently took Clements and Musker&#x27;s earlier ideas and wrote a treatment. Jeffrey Katzenberg, who was the chairman of Walt Disney Studios, disapproved of the project, and instead suggested they do an adaptation of &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; (in which Disney had held the film rights to). Clements and Musker were uninterested in the adaptation, and the film rights were transferred to Paramount Pictures in 2002. Katzenberg later struck a deal with the directors to produce another commercially viable film before he would green-light &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;. Turning down adaptation proposals for &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, and &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;, the directors were notified of Haidar&#x27;s pitch for a &quot;Hercules&quot; feature. &quot;We thought it would be our opportunity to do a &quot;superhero&quot; movie,&quot; Musker said, &quot;Ron and I being comic book fans. The studio liked us moving onto that project and so we did [&quot;Hercules&quot;].&quot;

===Writing===
With &quot;Hercules&quot; in production, Clements and Musker conducted research and wrote extensive notes for the film. On excerpts detailed in November 1993, the similarities between their outlines included the naïve title character caught between two worlds, a Danny DeVito-type sidekick, a world-wise heroine, and a powerful villain in a battle of idealism versus cynicism. The directors also sought inspiration from classic screwball comedy films directed by Preston Sturges and Frank Capra with &quot;Hercules as the young Jimmy Stewart in &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;,&quot; Musker explained, and &quot;Meg is modeled on Barbara Stanwyck, especially the characters she played in &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; and &quot;Meet John Doe&quot;.&quot;

While preparing the script, Clements and Musker consulted the works of Thomas Bullfinch, Edith Hamilton, Robert Graves, and other interpreters of Greek mythology until they reached the conclusion to not portray the traditional story of Hercules. Because Zeus sired Hercules outside of his marriage with Hera, Clements remarked &quot;that illegitimacy would be difficult subject matter for a Disney movie. So [he and Musker] thought of different ways he could be half-man and half-god. [They] moved more toward making Hades the villain instead of Hera. The Underworld seemed like such a fascinating, dark image; the contrast with Olympus seemed to have all kinds of visual possibilities.&quot; Additionally during their research, the directors were inspired by the correlation of the popularity of Hercules in comparison to that of sport athletes and celebrities in the contemporary era, with both stating Hercules was the Michael Jordan of his era.

After multiple meetings and story conferences, Clements and Musker wrote several story treatments before proceeding to their first script draft. Comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw were recruited by creative executive Jane Healey to work on &quot;Hercules&quot;. Meanwhile, their draft was concurrently rewritten by Irene Mecchi, which altogether brought additional humor and definition to the script.

===Casting===
Donny Osmond originally auditioned as the speaking voice of the title character, but was turned down because his voice was considered too deep. Osmond later earned a singing role in &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998) instead. While writing the role of Philoctetes, Musker and Clements envisioned Danny DeVito in the role, but DeVito declined to audition, so Ed Asner, Ernest Borgnine, and Dick Latessa were brought in to read for the part. After Red Buttons had auditioned, he left stating, &quot;I know what you&#x27;re gonna do. You&#x27;re gonna give this part to Danny Devito!&quot; Shortly after, the directors and producer Alice Dewey approached DeVito at a pasta lunch during the filming of &quot;Matilda&quot; (1996), where DeVito signed on to the role.

For every Disney animated feature since &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991), Susan Egan auditioned for a role, and then landed the role of Belle in the Broadway production. Upon learning about &quot;Hercules&quot;, Egan actively pursued the role of Megara, though she revealed that &quot;Alan Menken initially blocked me from going after that part. He said that the female lead in &quot;Hercules&quot; was supposed to be this cynical smart-ass, sounding nothing at all like sweet, innocent Belle.&quot; Menken eventually relented and allowed Egan to audition for the role. Egan read for the part in front of a microphone while being videotaped as Menken, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; musical director Michael Kosarin, and the filmmakers sat at a table with their eyes closed. Nine months following the results of the test animation synced with Egan&#x27;s audition, Egan won the role. During production, Meg was originally given a ballad titled &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe My Heart&quot;, but Ken Duncan, the supervising animator of Meg, pointed out the song was out of character for Meg. Menken and Zippel would later compose &quot;I Won&#x27;t Say I&#x27;m in Love&quot; instead.

The casting of Hades proved to be very problematic for Musker and Clements. When DeVito asked the directors who they had in mind to play Hades, Musker and Clements responded by saying they had not selected an appropriate actor. In response, DeVito blurted, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you ask Jack [Nicholson]?&quot; After DeVito notified Nicholson of the project, the next week, the studio was willing to pay Nicholson $500,000 for the role, but Nicholson demanded roughly a paycheck of $10–15 million, plus a 50 percent cut of all the proceeds from Hades merchandise. Unwilling to share merchandising proceeds with the actor, Disney came back with a counter offer that was significantly less than what Nicholson had asked for. Because of this, Nicholson decided to pass on the project.

Disappointed by Nicholson&#x27;s refusal, Clements and Musker eventually selected John Lithgow as Hades in fall 1994. After nine months of trying to make Lithgow&#x27;s portrayal of Hades work, Lithgow was released from the role in August 1995. According to John Musker, Ron Silver, James Coburn, Kevin Spacey, Phil Hartman, and Rod Steiger arrived to the Disney studios to read as Hades. Musker also invited producer Robert Evans to read. Additionally, animator Nik Ranieri claimed Michael Ironside, Terrence Mann, and Martin Landau also auditioned for the role, and that Musker and Clements had reached out to Jerry Lewis to read for the role. When the directors invited James Woods to read for the part, they were surprised by Woods&#x27; interpretation, and he was hired by October 1995. Hades&#x27;s co-henchman Pain was written with Bobcat Goldthwait in mind, although the actor confessed he still had to audition for the role despite playing himself.

===Animation and design===
In 1993, Clements and Musker fondly remembered a &quot;Time&quot; magazine cover of the Beatles, illustrated by English cartoonist Gerald Scarfe. While working as the production designer on a production of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, Scarfe was invited to tour the Disney studios where Clements and Musker noticed a direct correlation between Scarfe&#x27;s style and the Greek vase painting style. With the permission from the Disney studios, Scarfe was hired as production designer to produce a dozen drawings. Scarfe conducted minimal research, not wanting to be influenced by other interpretations where he sent thirty-two sketches via fax machine or courier, and ended up producing more than 700 drawings throughout production. By July 1995, Scarfe and fifteen animators and designers began developing working prototypes for every character in the movie. That same year, the filmmakers embarked on a research trip to Greece and Turkey to research classic Greek mythology. Since Scarfe&#x27;s style proved to be too fluid and chaotic for the animators, production stylist Sue Nichols created reference charts for the animators on which elements of Scarfe&#x27;s style, as well as classical Greek illustration, to adapt into their work.

Animation began in early 1995 with a team of nearly 700 artists, animators, and technicians in Burbank, California while Walt Disney Animation France contributed nearly ten minutes of animation, including the finale with the Titans and Hercules&#x27; descent into the Underworld. Andreas Deja, the supervising animator for Hercules, commented that the animation crew he worked with to animate Hercules was the &quot;largest [he] ever worked with&quot;. He previously worked on other characters (like Gaston in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, Jafar in &quot;Aladdin&quot;, and Scar in &quot;The Lion King&quot;) with about four animators on his crew, but he had a team of twelve or thirteen for Hercules. Given Deja had worked with three villains before, he was first offered Hades, but asked to animate Hercules instead – &quot;I knew it would be more difficult and more challenging, but I just needed that experience to have that in your repertoire.&quot;

Following the release of &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995), Eric Goldberg was initially assigned to animate Hades when Jack Nicholson was thought to play the character. However, when Nicholson decided to pass on the role, Goldberg was not interested in animating the character anymore. Around the same time, Chris Buck was assigned to animate Philoctetes, but after he left the production of &quot;Hercules&quot;, this left the character of Philoctetes without a supervising animator. Goldberg then decided to instead animate Philoctetes when DeVito signed onto the role noting his similarities with the actor in their short stature, baldness, and admittedly a little &quot;soft around the middle&quot;. Throughout production, there were twenty-seven designs for the character, but the final design took inspiration from Grumpy in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937) and Bacchus in &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940) in terms of their curmudgeonly personality and facial structure. For Hades, animator Nik Ranieri took inspiration from Scarfe&#x27;s concept drawings and James Woods&#x27; mannerisms during the recording sessions. While Hades&#x27; body was drawn by hand, the animation of the hair was handled by the effects animators with input from Ranieri as to how it should move.

For the Hydra, Scarfe provided preliminary drawings to give the mythical beast its requisite fangs and serpentine necks before work was transferred over to the computer animation team headed by Roger Gould. The Hydra was sculpted into a clay model where the dimensions were digitized into the computers as a wire-frame model by which the monster was animated. Early into production, the filmmakers decided the Hydra would ultimately have thirty heads by which the animators created one master head, and the computer could multiply the heads to their desired scale. Overall, thirteen animators and technical directors spent nearly a year-and-a-half creating the four-minute battle sequence. Additionally, because the directors envisioned Olympus as a city composed of clouds, painted backgrounds of clouds and cloud-like imagery were blended with drawn effects animation to create a morphing technique that were used for baby Hercules&#x27;s cradle and Zeus&#x27;s reclining chair.

===Music===

The soundtrack for &quot;Hercules&quot; consists of music written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist David Zippel, orchestrated by Daniel Troob and Michael Starobin, with vocals performed by Lillias White, LaChanze, Roz Ryan, Roger Bart, Danny DeVito, and Susan Egan among others. The album also includes the single version of &quot;Go the Distance&quot; by Michael Bolton. This was the last Disney Renaissance film for which Alan Menken composed music.

==Release==
===Marketing===
On February 4, 1997, Disney began its marketing campaign by starting a five-month promotional traveling tour called &quot;Disney&#x27;s Hercules Mega Mall Tour&quot;. Sponsored by Chevy Venture, the tour traveled throughout 20 cities starting first in Atlanta, Georgia. Previously used for the marketing campaigns for &quot;Pocahontas&quot; and &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;, the tour featured eleven attractions including a multimedia stage show, a miniature carousel themed to Baby Pegasus, a carnival with &quot;Hercules&quot;-themed game booths, and a ten-minute animation workshop hosted by animator Andreas Deja where visitors would try their hand at drawing Hercules.

On June 14, the premiere of the film was accompanied with a Hercules-led performance of Disneyland&#x27;s Main Street Electrical Parade held in Times Square. The parade of electrified floats, which was broadcast live on the Disney Channel as part of a program involving the making of &quot;Hercules&quot;, traveled from 42nd Street to Fifth Avenue. The parade also included attendees such as Lauren Hutton, Harvey Keitel, Andy Garcia, Barbara Walters, Michael Bolton, and Marilu Henner, as well as Olympic athletes who rode on thirty floats. The media event was not without controversy as former New York mayor Ed Koch objected to surrendering the city over to Disney, and critics raising questions about what politicians are willing to give a private firm in return for investment. Also, nearly 100 members of National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians used the occasion to strike for a new contract from Disney/ABC, with local union president Tony Capitano who complained: &quot;I think the Mayor gave away the city to Disneyland.&quot; Furthermore, 5,000 businesses and residents within the city felt unusually eerie upon being asked to dim their lights as the parade passed. Following the parade, a private party was held at the Chelsea Piers complex, where dinner guests were served to a performance of Susan Egan singing songs from the movie along the Hudson River, and ten minutes of fireworks display.

Additionally, the film was accompanied by a marketing campaign with promotional tie-ins with 85 licensees including McDonald&#x27;s, Mattel, Nestlé, Hallmark, and various merchandise. A tie-in video game, titled &quot;Hercules Action Game&quot;, was developed by Eurocom and released in July 1997 for the PC and PlayStation. Another tie-in game was developed by Tiertex Design Studios and was released for the Game Boy by THQ the same month. &quot;Hercules&quot; was also the first Disney on Ice adaptation before the film was theatrically released.

===Home media===
&quot;Hercules&quot; was first released on VHS and widescreen LaserDisc in the United States on February 3, 1998, included as an installment of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection series. By summer 1998, sales and rentals of the VHS release had accumulated to $165 million. Released on November 9, 1999, &quot;Hercules&quot; was released in a &quot;Limited Issue&quot; DVD for a limited sixty-day time period before going into moratorium. Launching in January 2000, Walt Disney Home Video began the Gold Classic Collection, with &quot;Hercules&quot; re-issued on VHS and DVD on August 1, 2000. The DVD contained the film in its 1.66:1 aspect ratio and THX-certified, and was accompanied with special features including &quot;The Making of Hercules&quot; documentary video and the &quot;Go The Distance&quot; music video sung by Ricky Martin, as well as an &quot;Animals of the Outback&quot; activity booklet. The early DVD issues utilized a 35mm print of the film, rather than use the computer to encode the movie directly to digital. The film was released on a Special Edition Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital HD on June 10, 2014. On September 1, 2017, &quot;Hercules&quot; became available on Netflix.

==Reception==

===Box office===
Wall Street analysts estimated that &quot;Hercules&quot; could bring in between $125 and $150 million in the United States, on the basis of the extensive marketing campaign and the movie&#x27;s light, humorous tone similar to that of &quot;Aladdin&quot;. &quot;Hercules&quot; began its limited release in North America on June 13, 1997, playing in one selected theater. The film earned $249,567 in box office receipts during the weekend of June 13–15, standing at the thirteenth place in the box office ranking. During its first two weeks, the film had grossed $1.45 million when it expanded into two selected theaters. The general release followed on June 27, 1997, in 2,621 screens. During the weekend of June 27–29, box office analysts estimated that &quot;Hercules&quot; earned $21.5 million, ranking second behind &quot;Face/Off&quot;, which grossed $22.7 million.

In its first two weeks of general release, &quot;Hercules&quot; amounted $58 million in box office grosses, compared to &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (which took in $80 million) and &quot;The Lion King&quot; (which grossed $119 million) in their respective two weeks. Considered a disappointment among Disney shareholders, Disney&#x27;s stock price slipped 9.7 percent by which executives blamed the film&#x27;s box office performance on &quot;more competition&quot;. By its third weekend, Buena Vista Pictures Distribution president Dick Cook confessed that competing family films such as &quot;Men in Black&quot; and &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; played a role in the downward box office performance, but projected the film would receive a worldwide gross of $300 million. Likewise, entertainment analysts speculated &quot;Hercules&quot; did not appeal strongly towards adults and teenagers compared to &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, and &quot;The Lion King&quot;, which served as date movies and family outings. By spring 1998, &quot;Hercules&quot; grossed $99 million, and the international totals for &quot;Hercules&quot; raised its gross to $253 million.

In Japan, &quot;Hercules&quot; earned an opening gross of $700,000, ranking in third place behind &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;. The film was in second place behind &quot;The Full Monty&quot; in the UK during its opening weekend, making $1.1 million.

===Critical response===

&quot;Hercules&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported the film has an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Fast-paced and packed with dozens of pop culture references, &quot;Hercules&quot; might not measure up with the true classics of the Disney pantheon, but it&#x27;s still plenty of fun.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale. According to journalist Franklin Foer, most contemporary critics praised the film for deviating from Disney&#x27;s standard musical-comedy formula.

James Woods received universal acclaim from film reviewers for his vocal performance as Hades. Reviewing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Owen Gleiberman graded the film an A− acclaiming it was Woods&#x27; most exciting performance since &quot;Salvador&quot;. He wrote his performance &quot;is an inspired piece of deadpan vaudeville. His dry jocularity is hilariously incongruous – he&#x27;s like a hostile, wisecracking salesman trapped in the body of the Antichrist.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote a positive review of the film, enjoying the story as well as the animation. Ebert also praised Woods&#x27; portrayal of Hades, stating that Woods brings &quot;something of the same verbal inventiveness that Robin Williams brought to &quot;Aladdin&quot;&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; film reviewer Gene Siskel, while awarding the film 2 out of 4 stars, stated, &quot;The only memorable character in the film is the nicely drawn villain Hades (voice by James Woods), who seeks to turn Hercules to the dark side. Hades supplies the genie-like patter that Robin Williams provided in &quot;Aladdin.&quot;&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; also praised Woods&#x27; performance, remarking that he &quot;shows off the full verve of an edgy Scarfe villain&quot;, and added &quot;On any level, earthly or otherwise, the ingenious new animated &quot;Hercules&quot; is pretty divine.&quot; James Berardinelli, film critic for &quot;ReelViews&quot;, awarded the film 3 out of 4, stars writing, &quot;The real star of the show is James Woods, whose Hades is the most vibrant Disney creation since Robin Williams&#x27; Genie. Hades is a lively villain with a great repertoire of one-liners. And, although Woods isn&#x27;t as much of a vocal chameleon as Williams, he&#x27;s close enough that it hardly matters.&quot;

The Scarfe-inspired animation style received mixed reviews, with Berardinelli labeling it as the film&#x27;s most disappointing aspect. He wrote: &quot;This approach makes the film look rushed and, at times, incomplete. It is never a visual marvel – even the computer-generated scenes fail to impress. The sequences intended to offer the biggest spectacle – Olympus and the Underworld – provoke little more than a yawn.&quot; Likewise, Siskel noted his surprise of &quot;how soft and cheap the animation looks.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Desson Howe criticized the animation as being &quot;some of the worst I&#x27;ve ever cringed through, including the corner-cutting junk of Don Bluth movies and every trashy cartoon that passes for entertainment on Saturday morning television. In &quot;Hercules,&quot; ancient Thebes looks like a hastily sketched field-trip location from public TV&#x27;s &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot;; and no self-respecting immortal would be seen dead in this simplistic rendition of Mount Olympus. Nevertheless, Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted the animation &quot;has just enough of a different look to it to make things interesting&quot; and praised the Hydra as a technological marvel.

Likewise, the music also received a mixed response, with Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; writing, &quot;Like the other songs by Disney veteran Alan Menken and his new lyricist, David Zippel (&quot;City of Angels&quot;), the number gets the job done, but it doesn&#x27;t topple the temple. The score is influenced by gospel, Broadway musicals, processional music and R&amp;B, but its only spice is its variety.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; film critic Leonard Klady noted the lack of distinctiveness of the music writing Menken &quot;is hitting too many tired notes in his sixth animated score&quot; and &quot;there&#x27;s simply not a song in the piece that has you humming as you exit the theater, and ballads such as &quot;Go the Distance&quot; will require aggressive repetition to register as playlist material.&quot;

===Controversy===
Disney intended for the film to have an open-air premiere at Pnyx hill, but the Greek government declined after the film received backlash from Greek critics and audiences, and the film would be renamed to &quot;Beyond the Myth of Heracles&quot; in Greece. Greek newspaper &quot;Adesmevtos Typos&quot; called it &quot;another case of foreigners distorting our history and culture just to suit their commercial interests&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Legacy==
===Cancelled sequel===
The sequel &quot;Hercules II: The Trojan War&quot; was planned. It would have been about Hercules now living in Athens with Megara and their daughter, Hebe. However, when an old friend named Helen is captured by the evil Paris of Troy, Hercules joins the united Greek army as they head out to war. However, this war will create revelations, and Hercules finds an old friend who eventually goes missing. The project was cancelled when John Lasseter was named Disney&#x27;s new chief creative officer in 2006, after which he called off all direct-to-video sequels that Disney had planned.

===TV series and follow-up film===

A new production of the musical opened at the Neue Flora in Hamburg, Germany on March 24, 2024, and directed by Casey Nicholaw. &quot;Hercules&quot; is scheduled to open in London&#x27;s West End at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in the summer of 2025.

===Live-action remake===
On April 29, 2020, it was reported that a live-action remake of &quot;Hercules&quot; is under development at Walt Disney Pictures, with the producers of the CGI remake of &quot;The Lion King&quot; (Jeffrey Silver and Karen Gilchrist) set to produce the film. Joe and Anthony Russo were to serve as producers on the film through their AGBO banner, with Dave Callaham as screenwriter. On May 7, 2020, the Russo brothers stated that the remake would not be a &quot;literal translation&quot; as they want the film to have new elements yet still being &quot;something that&#x27;s in the vein of the original and inspired by it&quot;. In June 2022, it was announced that Guy Ritchie, who had previously directed Disney&#x27;s live-action &quot;Aladdin&quot; remake, had signed on to direct the film. Joe Russo told &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; that the remake would pay homage to the original with a more modern spin on it and revealed that it would also be a modern musical inspired by TikTok.

<text>Burger King Corporation (BK, stylized in all caps) is an American multinational chain of hamburger fast food restaurants. Headquartered in Miami-Dade County, Florida, the company was founded in 1953 as Insta-Burger King, a Jacksonville, Florida–based restaurant chain. After Insta-Burger King ran into financial difficulties, its two Miami-based franchisees David Edgerton (1927–2018) and James McLamore (1926–1996) purchased the company in 1959. Over the next half-century, the company changed hands four times and its third set of owners, a partnership between TPG Capital, Bain Capital, and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, took it public in 2002. In late 2010, 3G Capital of Brazil acquired a majority stake in the company in a deal valued at US$3.26 billion. The new owners promptly initiated a restructuring of the company to reverse its fortunes. 3G, along with its partner Berkshire Hathaway, eventually merged the company with the Canadian-based coffeehouse chain Tim Hortons under the auspices of a new Canadian-based parent company named Restaurant Brands International.

Burger King&#x27;s menu has expanded from a basic offering of burgers, french fries, sodas, and milkshakes to a larger and more diverse set of products. In 1957, the &quot;Whopper&quot; became the first major addition to the menu, and it has since become Burger King&#x27;s signature product. Conversely, Burger King has introduced many products that have failed to catch hold in the market. Some of these failures in the United States have seen success in foreign markets, where Burger King has also tailored its menu for regional tastes. From 2002 to 2010, Burger King aggressively targeted the 18–34 male demographic with larger products that often carried correspondingly large amounts of unhealthy fats and trans-fats. This tactic would eventually damage the company&#x27;s financial underpinnings and cast a negative pall on its earnings. Beginning in 2011, the company began to move away from its previous male-oriented menu and introduce new menu items, product reformulations, and packaging, as part of its current owner 3G Capital&#x27;s restructuring plans of the company.

As of December 31, 2018, Burger King reported that it had 17,796 outlets in 100 countries. Of these, nearly half are located in the United States, and 99.7% are privately owned and operated, with its new owners moving to an almost entirely franchised model in 2013. Burger King has historically used several variations of franchising to expand its operations. The manner in which the company licenses its franchisees varies depending on the region, with some regional franchises, known as master franchises, responsible for selling franchise sub-licenses on the company&#x27;s behalf. Burger King&#x27;s relationship with its franchises has not always been harmonious. Occasional spats between the two have caused numerous issues, and in several instances, the relations between the company and its licensees have degenerated into precedent-setting court cases. Burger King&#x27;s Australian franchise Hungry Jack&#x27;s is the only franchise to operate under a different name due to a trademark dispute with a similarly named restaurant in Adelaide, South Australia, and a series of legal cases between the two.

==History==

The predecessor to Burger King was founded in 1953 in Jacksonville, Florida, as Insta-Burger King. After visiting the McDonald brothers&#x27; original store location in San Bernardino, California, the founders and owners (Keith G. Cramer and his wife&#x27;s uncle Matthew Burns), who had purchased the rights to two pieces of equipment called &quot;Insta-machines&quot;, opened their first restaurants. Their production model was based on one of the machines they had acquired, an oven called the &quot;Insta-Broiler&quot;. This strategy proved to be so successful that they later required all of their franchises to use the device. After the company faltered in 1959, it was purchased by its Miami, Florida, franchisees, James McLamore and David R. Edgerton. They initiated a corporate restructuring of the chain, first renaming the company Burger King. They ran the company as an independent entity for eight years (eventually expanding to over 250 locations in the United States), before selling it to the Pillsbury Company in 1967.
Pillsbury&#x27;s management tried several times to restructure Burger King during the late 1970s and the early 1980s. The most prominent change came in 1978 when Burger King hired McDonald&#x27;s executive Donald N. Smith to help revamp the company. In a plan called &quot;Operation Phoenix&quot;, Smith restructured corporate business practices at all levels of the company. Changes included updated franchise agreements, a broader menu and new standardized restaurant designs. Smith left Burger King for PepsiCo in 1980 shortly before a system-wide decline in sales.

Pillsbury&#x27;s Executive Vice President of Restaurant Operations Norman E. Brinker was tasked with turning the brand around, and strengthening its position against its main rival McDonald&#x27;s. One of his initiatives was a new advertising campaign featuring a series of attack ads against its major competitors. This campaign started a competitive period between Burger King, McDonald&#x27;s, and top burger chains known as the Burger wars. Brinker left Burger King in 1984, to take over Dallas-based gourmet burger chain Chili&#x27;s.

Smith and Brinker&#x27;s efforts were initially effective, but after their respective departures, Pillsbury relaxed or discarded many of their changes, and scaled back on construction of new locations. These actions stalled corporate growth and sales declined again, eventually resulting in a damaging fiscal slump for Burger King and Pillsbury. Poor operation and ineffectual leadership continued to bog down the company for many years.

Pillsbury was eventually acquired by the British entertainment conglomerate Grand Metropolitan in 1989. Initially, Grand Met attempted to bring the chain to profitability under newly minted CEO Barry Gibbons; the changes he initiated during his two-year tenure had mixed results, as successful new product introductions and tie-ins with The Walt Disney Company were offset by continuing image problems and ineffectual advertising programs. Additionally, Gibbons sold off several of the company&#x27;s assets in an attempt to profit from their sale and laid off many of its staff members.

Burger King&#x27;s headquarters experienced major damage in 1992 from Hurricane Andrew.

After Gibbon&#x27;s departure, a series of CEOs each tried to repair the company&#x27;s brand by changing the menu, bringing in new ad agencies and many other changes. The parental disregard of the Burger King brand continued with Grand Metropolitan&#x27;s merger with Guinness in 1997 when the two organizations formed the holding company Diageo. Eventually, the ongoing systematic institutional neglect of the brand through a string of owners damaged the company to the point where major franchises were driven out of business, and its total value was significantly decreased. Diageo eventually decided to divest itself of the money-losing chain and put the company up for sale in 2000.
The 21st century saw the company return to independence when it was purchased from Diageo by a group of investment firms led by TPG Capital for US$1.5 billion in 2002. The new owners rapidly moved to revitalize and reorganize the company, culminating with the company being taken public in 2006 with a highly successful initial public offering. The firms&#x27; strategy for turning the chain around included a new advertising agency and new ad campaigns, a revamped menu strategy, a series of programs designed to revamp individual stores, a new restaurant concept called the &quot;BK Whopper Bar&quot;, and a new design format called &quot;20/20&quot;. These changes successfully re-energized the company, leading to a score of profitable quarters. Yet, despite the successes of the new owners, the effects of the Great Recession weakened the company&#x27;s financial outlooks while those of its immediate competitor, McDonald&#x27;s, grew. The falling value of Burger King eventually led to TPG and its partners divesting their interest in the chain in a US$3.26 billion sale to 3G Capital of Brazil. Analysts from financial firms UBS and Stifel Nicolaus agreed that 3G would have to invest heavily in the company to help reverse its fortunes. After the deal was completed, the company&#x27;s stock was removed from the New York Stock Exchange, ending a four-year period as a public company. The delisting of its stock was designed to help the company repair its fundamental business structures and continue working to close the gap with McDonald&#x27;s without having to worry about pleasing shareholders. In the United States domestic market, the chain fell to third place in terms of same store sales behind Ohio-based Wendy&#x27;s. The decline was the result of 11 consecutive quarters of same store sales decline.

In August 2014, 3G announced that it planned to acquire the Canadian restaurant and coffee shop chain Tim Hortons and merge it with Burger King with backing from Warren Buffett&#x27;s Berkshire Hathaway. The two chains retained separate operations post-merger, with Burger King remaining in its Miami headquarters. A Tim Hortons representative stated that the proposed merger would allow Tim Hortons to leverage Burger King&#x27;s resources for international growth. The combined company became the third-largest international chain of fast food restaurants. The deal led to a controversy over the practice of tax inversions, in which a company decreases the amount of taxes it pays by moving its headquarters to a tax haven, a country with lower rates, but maintains the majority of their operations in their previous location. As a high-profile instance of tax inversion, news of the merger was criticized by U.S. politicians, who felt that the move would result in a loss of tax revenue to foreign interests, and could result in further government pressure against inversions.

In 2019, Burger King reported that it planned to close up to 250 low-volume locations per year, with closures coming into effect in 2020.

In February 2021, Burger King began testing a customer loyalty rewards program called &quot;Royal Perks&quot; in Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, New Jersey and Long Island, New York.

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, many companies, including Burger King, faced growing pressure to halt operations in Russia. In March 2022, Burger King claimed to have suspended all its corporate support, including operations, marketing, supply chain, investments and expansion in Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine, including support to the more than 800 fully franchised restaurant chains in Russia managed by a local master franchisee. However, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalism revealed that Burger King retained its stake in the Russian franchises through an offshore joint venture with the Russian state-owned VTB Bank and a Ukrainian investment firm linked to corrupt deals with Ukraine&#x27;s former pro-Russian leader.

In October 2023, Tom Curtis, president of Burger King U.S. &amp; Canada, announced a new store design at its annual franchisee convention in Canada, branded &quot;The Sizzle&quot;. The company planned to remodel existing Burger King locations with a new look inside and outside, to tackle slowing business after the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. The overhaul plan included more kiosks, dedicated pickup areas for mobile app orders, food-ordering platforms like Doordash, Uber Eats, and Grubhub, and an improved drive-thru service. In 2023, Burger King remodeled several locations in the United States with the &quot;Sizzle&quot; concept. While the remodel plan was an overhaul to the entire restaurant, Burger King was also investing in a &quot;Refresh&quot; initiative in order to replace equipment and upgrade technologies. By the end of 2023, Burger King completed 264 remodels and exited the year with 46% of its restaurants with a modern image.

==Structure and operations==

Burger King Holdings was the parent company of Burger King when it went public in 2002. Burger King derived its income from several sources, including property rental and sales through company owned restaurants; however, a substantial portion of its revenue was dependent on franchise fees. During the transitional period after 3G Capital acquired the company, Burger King&#x27;s board of directors was co-chaired by John W. Chidsey, formerly CEO and chairman of the company, and Alex Behring, managing partner of 3G Capital. By April 2011, the new ownership had completed the restructuring of Burger King&#x27;s corporate management and Chidsey tendered his resignation, leaving Behring as CEO and chair.

Burger King Corporation is currently an independently operated subsidiary of RBI. RBI&#x27;s present organizational structure includes five primary segments: Tim Hortons, Burger King, Firehouse Subs, Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen and International. International encompasses the aggregated outcomes from the operations of each brand outside the United States and Canada.

Josh Kobza, the CEO of RBI, was appointed in 2023. Before taking over as CEO in February 2023, Kobza served as CFO, CTO, and COO of RBI. Tom Curtis, the president of Burger King U.S. and Canada, was appointed in 2021 and oversees the operation of the Burger King Corporation in the United States and Canada.

In North America, Burger King Corporation is responsible for licensing operators and administering of stores. Internationally, the company often pairs with other parties to operate locations or it will outright sell the operational and administrative rights to a franchisee which is given the designation of master franchise for the territory. The master franchise will then be expected to sub-license new stores, provide training support, and ensure operational standards are maintained. In exchange for the oversight responsibilities, the master franchise will receive administrative and advertising support from Burger King Corporation to ensure a common marketing scheme. The 3G Capital ownership group announced in April 2011 that it would begin divesting itself of many corporate owned locations with the intent to increase the number of privately held restaurants to 95%. In 2016, the percentage of privately owned Burger King establishments grew to 99.5%. RBI maintains that approximately 100% of Burger King franchises are privately held restaurants.

Burger King was formerly headquartered in a nine-story office tower by the Miami International Airport in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, Florida.

On Monday July 8, 2002, 130 employees began working at the Burger King headquarters with the remainder moving in phases in August 2002. Prior to the moving to its current headquarters in 2002, Burger King had considered moving away from the Miami area to Texas; Miami-Dade County politicians and leaders lobbied against this, and Burger King stayed. Before 2002, the company&#x27;s previous headquarters was located in a southern Dade County campus located on Old Cutler Boulevard in the Cutler census-designated place.
In August 2014, the future of the company&#x27;s Miami headquarters was again in doubt as reports surfaced that Burger King was in talks about buying the Canadian restaurant chain Tim Hortons. The merger between Burger King and Tim Hortons created the fast food company now known as Restaurant Brands International Inc.
In 2016, Burger King signed a build-to-suit lease agreement on a new five-story headquarters building to be built at 5707 Blue Lagoon Drive, just down the street from its existing nine-story headquarters at 5505 Blue Lagoon Drive. This was slightly smaller than the it was leasing in its current headquarters building at the time. In 2018, Burger King moved into its new headquarters at 5707 Blue Lagoon Drive after it was finished. As of August 2024, the Burger King system operates more than 18,700 locations in more than 100 countries and U.S. territories.

==Franchises==
When Burger King Corporation began franchising in 1959, it used a regional model where franchisees purchased the right to open stores within a geographic region. These franchise agreements granted BKC very little oversight control of its franchisees and resulted in issues of product quality control, store image and design, and operational procedures.

During the 1970s, structural deficiencies in Burger King&#x27;s franchise system became increasingly problematic for Pillsbury. A major example was the relationship between Burger King and Louisiana-based franchisee Chart House, Burger King&#x27;s largest franchisee group at the time with over 350 locations in the United States. The company&#x27;s owners, William and James Trotter, made several moves to take over or acquire Burger King during the 1970s, all of which were spurned by Pillsbury. After the failed attempts to acquire the company, the relationship between Chart House and Burger King soured and eventually devolved into a lawsuit. Chart House eventually spun off its Burger King operations in the early 1980s into a holding company called DiversiFoods which, in turn, was acquired by Pillsbury in 1984 and absorbed into Burger King&#x27;s operations.

As part of the franchising reorganization segment of Operation Phoenix, Donald N. Smith initiated a restructuring of future franchising agreements in 1978. Under this new franchise agreement, new owners were disallowed from living more than one hour from their restaurants – restricting them to smaller individuals or ownership groups and preventing large, multi-state corporations from owning franchises. Franchisees were also now prohibited from operating other chains, preventing them from diverting funds away from their Burger King holdings. This new policy effectively limited the size of franchisees and prevented larger franchises from challenging Burger King Corporation as Chart House had. Smith also sought to have BKC be the primary owner of new locations and rent or lease the restaurants to its franchises. This policy would allow the company to take over the operations of failing stores or evict those owners who would not conform to the company guidelines and policies. By 1988, parent company Pillsbury had relaxed many of Smith&#x27;s changes, scaling back on construction of new locations, which resulted in stalled growth of the brand. Neglect of Burger King by new owner Grand Metropolitan and its successor Diageo further hurt the standing of the brand, causing significant financial damage to BK franchises and straining relations between the parties.

By 2001 and after nearly 18 years of stagnant growth, the state of its franchises was beginning to affect the value of the company. One of the franchises most heavily affected by the lack of growth was the nearly 400-store AmeriKing Inc., one of the largest Burger King franchisees. By 2002, the franchise owner, which until this point had been struggling under a nearly US$300 million debt load and been shedding stores across the US, was forced to enter Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The failure of AmeriKing deeply affected the value of Burger King, and put negotiations between Diageo and the TPC Capital-led group on hold. The developments eventually forced Diageo to lower the total selling price of the chain by almost . After the sale, newly appointed CEO Brad Blum initiated a program to help roughly 20 percent of its franchises, including its four largest, who were in financial distress, bankruptcy or had ceased operations altogether. Partnering with California-based Trinity Capital, LLC, the company established the Franchisee Financial Restructuring Initiative, a program to address the financial issues facing BK&#x27;s financially distressed franchisees. The initiative was designed to assist franchisees in restructuring their businesses to meet financial obligations, focus on restaurant operational excellence, reinvest in their operations, and return to profitability.

Individual franchisees took advantage of the AmeriKing failure; one of BK&#x27;s regional owners, Miami-based Al Cabrera, purchased 130 stores located primarily in the Chicago and the upper mid-west region, from the failed company for a price of , approximately 88 percent of their original value. The new company, which started out as Core Value Partners and eventually became Heartland Foods, also purchased 120 additional stores from distressed owners and revamped them. The resulting purchases made Cabrera the largest minority franchisee of Burger King, and Heartland one of the company&#x27;s top franchises. By 2006, the company was valued at over , and was sold to New York–based GSO Capital Partners. Other purchasers included a three-way group of NFL athletes Kevin Faulk, Marcus Allen, and Michael Strahan who collectively purchased 17 stores in the cities of Norfolk and Richmond, Virginia; and Cincinnati-based franchisee Dave Devoy, who purchased 32 AmeriKing stores. After investing in new decor, equipment and staff retraining, many of the formerly failing stores showed growth approaching 20 percent.

As part of 3G&#x27;s restructuring plan, the company decided to divest itself of its corporate owned locations by re-franchising them to private owners and become a 100% franchised operation by the end of 2013. The project, which began in April 2012, saw the company divest corporate-owned locations in Florida, Canada, Spain, Germany, and other regions. The move gave the company a Q3, 2013 profit of US$68.2 million over the same quarter, 2012 of US$6.6 million.

At the end of its 2013 fiscal year, Burger King was the second largest chain of hamburger fast food restaurants in terms of global locations, behind industry bellwether McDonald&#x27;s, which had 32,400 locations. At the end of 2014, Burger King ranked fourth among US food chains in terms of US sales, behind McDonald&#x27;s, Starbucks, and Subway. Burger King now has over 12,000 stores worldwide.

In January 2024, Restaurant Brands International, the owner of the brand, announced it would purchase the largest franchisee of the chain, Carrols Restaurant Group, for around $1 billion. At the time of the announcement, Carrols had 1,022 Burger King locations (along with 60 Popeyes locations). The goal was to remodel 600 of the restaurants, then sell them back to franchisees over five to seven years. The move represented a departure from the existing model of largely franchising locations.

==International operations==
While BK began its foray into locations outside of the continental United States in 1963 with a store in San Juan, Puerto Rico, it did not have an international presence until several years later. Shortly after the acquisition of the chain by Pillsbury, it opened its first Canadian restaurant in Windsor, Ontario in 1969. Other international locations followed soon after, including Australia in 1971, with a restaurant in the Perth suburb of Innaloo, and Europe in 1975, with a restaurant in Madrid. Beginning in 1982, BK and its franchisees began operating stores in several East Asian countries, including Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea. Due to high competition, all of the Japanese locations were closed in 2001; however, BK reentered the Japanese market in June 2007. BK&#x27;s Central and South American operations began in Mexico in the late 1970s and by the early 1980s in Caracas, Venezuela, Santiago, Chile, and Buenos Aires, Argentina. While Burger King lags behind McDonald&#x27;s in international locations by over 12,000 stores, as of 2008 it had managed to become the largest chain in several countries including Mexico and Spain.

The company divides its international operations into three segments; the Middle East, Europe and Africa division (EMEA), Asia-Pacific (APAC) and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). In each of these regions, Burger King has established several subsidiaries to develop strategic partnerships and alliances to expand into new territories. In its EMEA group, Burger King&#x27;s Switzerland-based subsidiary Burger King Europe GmbH is responsible for the licensing and development of BK franchises in those regions. In APAC region, the Singapore-based BK AsiaPac, Pte. Ltd. business unit handles franchising for East Asia, the Asian subcontinent and all Oceanic territories. The LAC region includes Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean Islands and has no centralized operations group.
Australia is the only country in which Burger King does not operate under its own name. When the company set about establishing operations down under in 1971, it found that its business name was already trademarked by a takeaway food shop in Adelaide. As a result, Burger King provided the Australian franchisee, Jack Cowin, with a list of possible alternative names derived from pre-existing trademarks already registered by Burger King and its then corporate parent Pillsbury, that could be used to name the Australian restaurants. Cowin selected the &quot;Hungry Jack&quot; brand name, one of Pillsbury&#x27;s US pancake mixture products, and slightly changed the name to a possessive form by adding an apostrophe &quot;s&quot; forming the new name Hungry Jack&#x27;s. After the expiration of the trademark in the late 1990s, Burger King unsuccessfully tried to introduce the brand to the continent. After losing a lawsuit filed against it by Hungry Jack&#x27;s ownership, the company ceded the territory to its franchisee. Hungry Jack&#x27;s is now the only Burger King brand in Australia; Cowin&#x27;s company Hungry Jack&#x27;s Pty Ltd. is the master franchise and thus is now responsible for oversight of the operations that country with Burger King only providing administrative and advertising support to ensure a common marketing scheme for the company and its products.
Over a 10-year period starting in 2008, Burger King predicted 80 percent of its market share would be driven by foreign expansion, particularly in the Asia-Pacific and Indian subcontinent regional markets. While the TPG-led group continued BK&#x27;s international expansion by announcing plans to open new franchise locations in Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East, and Brazil, the company plan is focusing on the three largest markets – India, China, and Japan. The company plans to add over 250 stores in these Asian territories, as well as other places such as Macau, by the end of 2012. Its expansion into the Indian market has the company at a competitive disadvantage with other fast food restaurants such as KFC because of the aversion of the country&#x27;s large Hindu majority to beef. BK hopes to use their non-beef products, such as their TenderCrisp and TenderGrill chicken sandwiches, as well as other products like mutton sandwiches and veggie sandwiches, to help them overcome this hurdle to expand in that country. 3G has reported that it will continue with the plans to grow globally, even ramping up the planned expansion to help increase their return on investment. It is expected that 3G Brazilian-based management connections in the region may help Burger King expand in Brazil and Latin America, where it has been having problems finding acceptable franchisees.

In December 2020, Burger King India went in for an initial public offering (IPO) on the BSE and NSE in India. The IPO was subscribed over 150 times. The stock opened at per share on December 14, nearly double the IPO price of , and closed at .
==Legal cases==
Burger King has been involved in several legal disputes and cases, as both plaintiff and defendant, in the years since its founding in 1954. Depending on the ownership and executive staff at the time of these incidents, the company&#x27;s responses to these challenges have ranged from a conciliatory dialog with its critics and litigants, to a more aggressive opposition with questionable tactics and negative consequences. The company&#x27;s response to these various issues has drawn praise as well as, in some instances, suggestions of political appeasement.

A trademark dispute involving the owners of an unrelated restaurant also named Burger King in Mattoon, Illinois, led to a federal lawsuit. As a result, the larger Burger King chain was ordered not to build any franchises within a 20-mile radius of the Mattoon Burger King. An existing trademark held by a shop of the same name in South Australia forced the company to change its name in Australia to &quot;Hungry Jack&#x27;s&quot;, while another state trademark in Texas forced the company to abandon its signature product, the Whopper, in several counties around San Antonio. The company was only able to enter northern Alberta, in Canada, in 1995, after it paid the founders of another chain named Burger King.

Legal decisions from other suits have set contractual law precedents in regards to long-arm statutes, the limitations of franchise agreements, and ethical business practices. Many of these decisions have helped define general business dealings that continue to shape the entire marketplace.

Controversies and disputes have arisen with groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), governmental and social agencies, and unions and trade groups over various topics. These situations have touched on legal and moral concepts such as animal rights, corporate responsibility, ethics, and social justice. While the majority of the disputes did not result in lawsuits, in many of the cases, the situations raised legal questions, dealt with legal compliance, or resulted in legal remedies such as changes in contractual procedure or binding agreements between parties. The resolutions to these legal matters have often altered the way the company interacts and negotiates contracts with its suppliers and franchisees, or how it does business with the public.

Further controversies have occurred during the company&#x27;s expansion in the Middle East. The opening of a Burger King location in Ma&#x27;aleh Adumim, an Israeli settlement in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, led to a breach of contract dispute between Burger King and its Israeli franchise due to the hotly contested international dispute over the legality of Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories in accordance to international law. The controversy eventually erupted into a geopolitical dispute involving Muslim and Jewish groups on multiple continents over the application of, and adherence to, international law. The case eventually elicited reactions from the members of the 22-nation Arab League. The Islamic countries within the League made a joint threat to the company of legal sanctions including the revocation of Burger King&#x27;s business licenses within the member states&#x27; territories.

A related issue involving members of the Islamic faith over the interpretation of the Muslim version of canon law, Shariah, regarding the promotional artwork on a dessert package in the United Kingdom raised issues of cultural sensitivity, and, with the former example, posed a larger question about what companies must do to ensure the smooth operation of their businesses in the communities they serve.
On April 9, 2019, &quot;Nations Restaurant News&quot; reported that Burger King filed a lawsuit on Fritz Management LLC to remove Burger King trademarks from 37 units in South Texas after unsanitary conditions were found at a restaurant in Harlingen, Texas. In May 2019, the lawsuit was settled with the franchisee, Fritz Management (a subsidiary of Sun Holdings Inc), keeping the trademarks on all 37 units.
On November 19, 2019, a lawsuit was filed by a vegan from Atlanta, Georgia against Burger King for allegedly failing to clearly disclose that Impossible Whopper burgers were heated on the same grill as their beef burgers. The lawsuit was dismissed.

On March 28, 2022, a lawsuit was filed against Burger King, alleging the fast food chain falsely advertised the Whopper to &quot;look about 35% bigger in its advertising than it is in reality&quot;.

==Charitable contributions and services==
Burger King has two in-house national charitable organizations and programs. One is the Have It Your Way Foundation, a U.S.-based non-profit (501(c)(3)) corporation with multiple focuses on hunger alleviation, disease prevention and community education through scholarship programs at colleges in the U.S. The other charitable organization is the McLamore Foundation, also a non-profit, 501(c)(3) corporation that provides scholarships to students in the U.S. and its territories.

In various regions across the United States, Burger King and its franchises have aligned themselves with several charitable organizations that support research and treatment of juvenile cancer. Each year, these coalitions hold a fund raising drive called &quot;A Chance for Kids&quot;, in which Burger King restaurants sell lottery-style scratch cards for $1. Each card produces a winning prize that is usually a food or beverage product, but includes (rarer) items such as shopping sprees or trips. In the Northeast, BK has affiliated itself with the Major League Baseball team the Boston Red Sox and its charitable foundation, the Jimmy Fund. The group runs the contest in Boston. In the New York City area, it operates the contest in association with the Burger King Children&#x27;s Charities of Metro New York and the New York Yankees. Funds raised in these areas go to support the Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, located in Boston. In Nebraska, the company is affiliated with the Liz&#x27;s Legacy Cancer Fund &quot;BK Beat Cancer for Kids&quot; program at the UNMC Eppley Cancer Center at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. In the Pittsburgh region, it funded the establishment of the Burger King Cancer Caring Center, a support organization for the families and friends of cancer patients.

==Products==
When the predecessor of Burger King first opened in Jacksonville in 1953, its menu consisted predominantly of basic hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks, milkshakes, and desserts. After being acquired by its Miami, Florida, franchisees and renamed to its current moniker in 1954, BK began expanding the breadth of its menu by adding the Whopper sandwich in 1957. This quarter-pound () hamburger was created by Burger King&#x27;s new owners James McLamore and David Edgerton as a way to differentiate BK from other burger outlets at the time. Since its inception, the Whopper has become synonymous with Burger King and has become the focus of much of its advertising. The company even named its new kiosk-style restaurants Whopper Bars.

The menu component of Donald Smith&#x27;s Operation Phoenix was initiated in 1978 and led to the addition of the Burger King Specialty Sandwich line in 1979. The new product line significantly expanded the breadth of the BK menu with many non-hamburger sandwiches, including new chicken and fish offerings. The new Specialty Sandwich line was one of the first attempts to target a specific demographic, in this case, adults 18–34, who would be willing to spend more on a higher quality product. One of Smith&#x27;s other significant contributions to the menu was the addition of a breakfast product line, which until this time was not a market Burger King had entered. Besides the addition of the Croissan&#x27;Wich in 1983, the breakfast menu remained almost identical to the McDonald&#x27;s offerings until a menu revamp in 1985. This expansion introduced BK&#x27;s &quot;AM Express&quot; product line, which added new products such as French toast sticks and mini-muffins.

As the company expanded both inside and outside the US, it introduced localized versions of its products that conform to regional tastes and cultural or religious beliefs. International variations add ingredients such as teriyaki or beetroot and fried egg to the Whopper; beer in Germany, Italy, and Spain; and halal or kosher products in the Middle East and Israel. To generate additional sales, BK will occasionally introduce limited time offers (LTOs) that are versions of its core products, or new products intended for either long or short term sales. Items such as the Texas Double Whopper and various sandwiches made with mushrooms and Swiss cheese have been rotated in and out of its menu for several years, while products such as its 1993 Meatloaf Specialty Sandwich offering and accompanying limited table service, along with special dinner platters, failed to generate interest and were discontinued.
In order to appeal to as many demographic groups as possible and better compete with its competitor, Wendy&#x27;s, Burger King added a multi-tiered value menu in 1993 with items priced at 99¢, US$1.99 and $2.99. The additions, part of then CEO James Adamson&#x27;s back-to-basics program called Operation Phoenix, were an attempt to add not only a value menu, but also a line of value meals. The tiered menu was replaced with a more standard value menu in 1998 while the value meals were separated into their own menu segment. This value menu featured seven products: Whopper Jr., five-piece Chicken Tenders, a bacon cheeseburger, medium-sized French fries, medium soft drink, medium onion rings, and a small milkshake. In 2002 and 2006, BK revamped its value menu, adding and removing several different products such as chili and its Rodeo Cheeseburger. Many of these items have since been discontinued, modified or relegated to a regional menu option. To better appeal to a more adult palate and demographic, BK introduced several new products to its menu in 2003, including several new or revamped chicken products, a new salad line and its BK Joe brand of coffee. Some of the new products, including their Enormous Omelet Sandwich line and the BK Stacker line, brought negative attention due to the large portion size, and amounts of unhealthy fats and trans-fats. Many of these products featured higher quality ingredients like whole chicken breast, Angus beef, and natural cheeses such as cheddar and pepper jack. Again, not all these products, such as the BK Baguette line, have met sales expectations.

With the purchase of the company in 2010, 3G began a program to restructure its menu designed to move away from the male-oriented menu that had dominated under the previous ownership. The first major item to be introduced was a reformulation of its BK Chicken Tenders product in March 2011. Over the next few months, approximately 20 new products were developed while others were reformulated, including its Chef&#x27;s Choice Burger. Eventually pruned down to 10 items, Burger King began deploying the items in the United States throughout 2011–2012 with the official roll out beginning April 2012. The changes included new soft serve products, smoothies, frappés and chicken strips. The Whopper was the most prominently reformulated product in this round of introductions with a new type of cheese and packaging.

At the end of 2015, Burger King&#x27;s parent company, Restaurant Brands International, announced that none of its subsidiaries would use chicken that had been fed antibiotics that are &quot;critically important&quot; to human health; that announcement referred only to a small class of antibiotics for which there is only one drug that kill a kind of bacteria and the announcement was described as a &quot;small step&quot; by advocates for stopping all antibiotic use in livestock.

In 2019, Burger King released an &quot;Impossible Whopper&quot; burger, a vegetarian burger using a plant-based patty from Impossible Foods.

In February 2020, Burger King announced that it would remove artificial preservatives, colors, and flavors from the Whopper by the end of 2020. In July 2020, BK announced it would begin selling a Whopper patty made from cows on a low methane diet.

In late 2021 and early 2022, the company announced it would cut back on value items and altered product configuration because of inflationary pressures and to speed up drive-thru lanes.

After successfully testing vegan products at meat-free temporary restaurants in Leicester Square and Bristol, Burger King UK announced that in 2023 it would offer a Vegan Royale Bakon King, made with vegan bacon, vegan cheese and a vegan burger made by The Vegetarian Butcher.

===Equipment===

Like its menu, the equipment the company cooks its hamburgers with has also evolved as the company expanded. The burgers have always been broiled mechanically; the original unit, called an Insta-Broiler, was one of two pieces of equipment the founders of Insta-Burger King purchased before opening their new restaurant. The Insta-Broiler worked by cooking 12 burger patties in a wire basket, allowing the patties to be cooked from both sides simultaneously. When McLamore and Edgerton took over the company, besides dropping the &quot;Insta-&quot; prefix, they switched to an improved unit called a &quot;Flame Broiler&quot;. Designed by the two and featuring stationary burners that cooked the meat on a moving chain, the unit broke down less often while maintaining a similar cooking rate. The company would stay with that format for the next 40 years until Burger King began developing a variable speed broiler that could handle multiple items with different cooking rates and times. These new units began testing in 1999 and eventually evolved into the two models the company deployed system-wide in 2008–2009. Accompanying these new broilers was new food-holding equipment, accompanied with a computer-based product monitoring system for its cooked products. The monitoring system allows for more concise tracking of product quality while giving the company and its franchisees a method to streamline costs by more precisely projecting sales and product usage.

==Advertising==
Since its founding in 1954, Burger King has employed varied advertising programs, both successful and unsuccessful. During the 1970s, output included its &quot;Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce...&quot; jingle, the inspiration for its current mascot the Burger King, and several well known and parodied slogans such as &quot;Have it your way&quot; and &quot;It takes two hands to handle a Whopper&quot;.

Burger King introduced the first attack ad in the fast food industry with a pre-teen Sarah Michelle Gellar in 1981. The television spot, which claimed BK burgers were larger and better tasting than competitor McDonald&#x27;s, so enraged executives at McDonald&#x27;s parent company that they sued all parties involved. Starting in the early 1980s and running through approximately 2001, BK engaged a series of ad agencies that produced many unsuccessful slogans and programs, including its biggest advertising flop &quot;Where&#x27;s Herb?&quot;

Burger King was a pioneer in the advertising practice known as the &quot;product tie-in&quot;, with a successful partnership with George Lucas&#x27; Lucasfilm, Ltd., to promote the 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot; in which BK sold a set of beverage glasses featuring the main characters from the movie. This promotion was one of the first in the fast food industry and set the pattern that continues to the present. BK&#x27;s early success in the field was overshadowed by a 1982 deal between McDonald&#x27;s and The Walt Disney Company to promote Disney&#x27;s animated films beginning in the mid-1980s and running through the early 1990s. In 1994, Disney switched from McDonald&#x27;s to Burger King, signing a 10-movie promotional contract which would include such top 10 films as &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992), &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991), &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), and &quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995). Burger King created kids&#x27; meal toys to promote the DreamWorks Pictures film &quot;Small Soldiers&quot; (1998). This led to some controversy due to the film being rated PG-13. As a result, BK altered the promotional commercials to be directed at an older audience, and included a pamphlet disclaimer with the toys which read, in part; &quot;the movie &quot;Small Soldiers&quot; may contain material that is inappropriate for younger children.&quot; A partnership in association with the Pokémon franchise at the height of its popularity in 1999 was tremendously successful for the company, with many locations rapidly selling out of the toys and the replacements. In December 1999, two hazardous incidents involving the Pokéball toy, one of which caused the death of a 13-month-old child, led to the toy being recalled.

Shortly after the acquisition of Burger King by TPG Capital, L.P. in 2002, its new CEO Brad Blum set about turning around the fortunes of the company by initiating an overhaul of its flailing advertising programs. In 2003, Burger King hired the Miami-based advertising agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky (CP+B), which completely reorganized its advertising with a series of new campaigns. CP+B was known for having a hip, subversive tack when creating campaigns for its clients, exactly what BK was looking for. Their strategy centered on a redesigned Burger King character used during the 1970s/1980s Burger King Kingdom children&#x27;s advertising campaign as a caricatured variation, now simply called &quot;the King&quot;.

While highly successful, some of CP+B&#x27;s commercials were derided for perceived sexism or cultural insensitivity. Burger King&#x27;s new owner, 3G Capital, later terminated the relationship with CP+B in 2011 and moved its advertising to McGarryBowen to begin a new product-oriented campaign with expanded demographic targeting.

Additionally, CP+B created a series of new characters like the Subservient Chicken and the faux nu-metal band Coq Roq, featured in a series of viral web-based advertisements on sites such as MySpace and various Burger King corporate pages, to complement various television and print promotional campaigns. One of the more successful promotions that CP+B devised was the creation of a series of three advergames for the Xbox 360. Created by UK-based Blitz Games and featuring company celebrity spokesman Brooke Burke, the games sold more than 3.2 million copies, placing them as one of the top selling games along with another Xbox 360 hit, &quot;Gears of War&quot;. These ad campaigns, coupled with other new promotions and a series of new product introductions, drew positive and negative attention to BK and helped TPG and its partners realize about US$367 million in dividends.

With the late-2000s recession hitting the 18–35 demographic targeted by the CP+B created ads particularly hard, the company saw its market share decline and the company move into the red. After the completion of the sale of the company in late 2010, the new ownership group terminated Burger King&#x27;s seven-year relationship with CP+B and hired rival firm McGarryBowen to create a new campaign with an expanded market reach. As part of the new campaign, McGarryBowen terminated the use of The Burger King in the company&#x27;s advertising program in favor of a new program that focused on the food and ingredients in its new advertising campaigns.

In recent years, Burger King has turned to trolling fast food rival McDonald&#x27;s with their advertising strategy. The company&#x27;s tactics have included LOLA MullenLowe&#x27;s &quot;Scary Clown Night&quot; which offered a free Whopper to anyone dressed as a clown (McDonald&#x27;s mascot) on Halloween; FCB New York&#x27;s Whopper Detour initiative, which encouraged mobile app users to go to a nearby McDonald&#x27;s in order to unlock a 1-center Whopper; and Ingo&#x27;s &quot;The Not Big Macs&quot; menu, which poked fun at McDonald&#x27;s recent loss of the Big Mac trademark in the EU.

In February 2019, the company launched an advertising campaign called &quot;Eat Like Andy&quot;. The television spot which premiered during the Super Bowl LIII features archival documentary film footage from &quot;66 Scenes from America&quot; by Jørgen Leth of the pop artist Andy Warhol (1928–1987) unwrapping and eating a Whopper. The footage was approved for use by the fast food giant courtesy of the Andy Warhol Foundation. Meanwhile, prior to the game, the mass market hamburger chain made available to viewers who ordered it in advance via DoorDash an &quot;Andy Warhol Mystery Box&quot; which contains among other items a plastic bottle of ketchup and a platinum wig so one can &quot;Eat Like Andy&quot;.


On March 8, 2021, Burger King was criticized for their International Women&#x27;s Day marketing campaign, after a tweet from Burger King UK stated, &quot;Women belong in the kitchen&quot;. The tweets were labeled as sexist by thousands of Twitter users and dozens of news publications. Burger King UK followed up, stating &quot;We&#x27;re on a mission to change the gender ratio in the restaurant industry.&quot; However, critics say the damage has already been done. The initial tweet received high amounts of recognition and viewer interaction, while the replies received a fraction of the coverage, meaning only a few people are aware of the clarifications made by Burger King. After severe backlash, Burger King deleted the tweet 12 hours later and posted an apology stating, &quot;We got our initial tweet wrong and we&#x27;re sorry.&quot;

In late 2022, Burger King released the &quot;Have it Your Way&quot; commercials, going viral on social media such as TikTok after the 2022–23 NFL playoffs because of its large amount of repetition and catchiness. The ads gained media attention and made their way onto music streaming services such as Spotify in February 2023.

<text>A recommendation in the European Union, according to Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (formerly Article 249 TEC), is one of two kinds of non-legal binding acts cited in the Treaty of Rome, the other being an opinion.

Recommendations are without legal force but are negotiated and voted on according to the appropriate procedure. Recommendations differ from regulations, directives and decisions, in that they are not binding for Member States. Though without legal force, they do have a political weight. The recommendation is an instrument of indirect action aiming at preparation of legislation in Member States, differing from the Directive only by the absence of obligatory power.

Article 292 notes that the European Commission may make recommendations, and in specific cases the European Central Bank may also make recommendations.

==Common market==
According to the terms of the Treaty on European Union &quot;In order to ensure the proper functioning and development of the common market, the Commission (…) formulate recommendations or deliver opinions on matters dealt with in this Treaty, if it expressively so provides or if the Commission considers it necessary.&quot;

Concretely, recommendations can be used by the commission to raze barriers of competition caused by the establishment or the modification of internal norms of a Member State. If a country does not conform to a recommendation, the Commission cannot propose the adoption of a Directive aimed at other Member Countries, in order to elide this distortion.

==Examples==
The European Council issued a recommendation on the promotion of positive action for women at work on 13 December 1984, and the European Commission issued a recommendation on the protection of the dignity of women and men at work on 27 November 1991. A code of practice on measures to combat sexual harassment was appended to the latter recommendation, which put forward recommended actions for employers, trade unions and employees in the public and private sectors in all member states.

PARAM is a series of Indian supercomputers designed and assembled by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) in Pune. PARAM means &quot;supreme&quot; in the Sanskrit language, whilst also creating an acronym for &quot;PARAllel Machine&quot;.

==History==

C-DAC was created in November 1987, originally as the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing Technology (C-DACT). This was in response to issues purchasing supercomputers from foreign sources. The Indian Government decided to try and develop indigenous computing technology.

===PARAM 8000===
The PARAM 8000 was the first machine in the series and was built from scratch. A prototype was benchmarked at the &quot;1990 Zurich Super-computing Show&quot;: of the machines that ran at the show it came second only to one from the United States.

A 64-node machine was delivered in August 1991. Each node used Inmos T800/T805 transputers. A 256-node machine had a theoretical performance of 1GFLOPS, however in practice had a sustained performance of 100-200MFLOPS. PARAM 8000 was a distributed memory MIMD architecture with a reconfigurable interconnection network.

The PARAM 8000 was noted to be 28 times more powerful than the Cray X-MP that the government originally requested, for the same $10 million cost quoted for it.

====Exports====
The computer was a success and was exported to Germany, United Kingdom and Russia. Apart from taking over the home market, PARAM attracted 14 other buyers with its relatively low price tag of $350,000.

The computer was also exported to the ICAD Moscow in 1991 under Russian collaboration.

===PARAM 8600===
PARAM 8600 was an improvement over PARAM 8000. In 1992 C-DAC realised its machines were underpowered and wished to integrate the newly released Intel i860 processor. Each node was created with one i860 and four Inmos T800 transputers. The same PARAS programming environment was used for both the PARAM 8000 and 8600; this meant that programs were portable. Each 8600 cluster was noted to be as powerful as 4 PARAM 8000 clusters.

===PARAM 9000===
The PARAM (param vashisht lega) 9000 was designed to be merge cluster processing and massively parallel processing computing workloads. It was first demonstrated in 1994. The design was changed to be modular so that newer processors could be easily accommodated. Typically a system used 32–40 processors, however it could be scaled up to 200 CPUs using the clos network topology. The PARAM 9000/SS was the SuperSPARC II processor variant, the PARAM 9000/US used the UltraSPARC processor, and the PARAM 9000/AA used the DEC Alpha.

===PARAM 10000===
The PARAM 10000 was unveiled in 1998 as part of C-DAC&#x27;s second mission. PARAM 10000 used several independent nodes, each based on the Sun Enterprise 250 server; each such server contained two 400Mhz UltraSPARC II processors. The base configuration had three compute nodes and a server node. The peak speed of this base system was 6.4 GFLOPS. A typical system would contain 160 CPUs and be capable of 100 GFLOPS But, it was easily scalable to the TFLOP range. Exported to Russia and Singapore.

===Further computers===
Further computers were made in the PARAM series as one-off supercomputers, rather than serial production machines. From the late 2010s many machines were created as part of the National Supercomputing Mission.

== Supercomputer summary ==
==PARAMNet==
PARAMNet is a high speed high bandwidth low latency network developed for the PARAM series. The original PARAMNet used an 8 port cascadable non-blocking switch developed by C-DAC. Each port provided 400 Mb/s in both directions (thus 2x400 Mbit/s) as it was a full-duplex network. It was first used in PARAM 10000.

PARAMNet II, introduced with PARAM Padma, is capable of 2.5 Gbit/s while working full-duplex. It supports interfaces like Virtual Interface Architecture and Active messages. It uses 8 or 16 port SAN switches.

PARAMNet-3, used in PARAM Yuva and PARAM Yuva-II, is next generation high performance networking component for building supercomputing systems. PARAMNet-3 consists of tightly integrated hardware and software components. The hardware components consist of Network Interface Cards (NIC) based on CDAC&#x27;s fourth generation communication co-processor &quot;GEMINI&quot;, and modular 48-port Packet Routing Switch &quot;ANVAY&quot;. The software component &quot;KSHIPRA&quot; is a lightweight protocol stack designed to exploit capabilities of hardware and to provide industry standard interfaces to the applications. Other application areas identified for deployment of PARAMNet-3 are storage and database applications.

==Operators==
PARAM supercomputers are used by both public and private operators for various purposes. As of 2008, 52 PARAMs have been deployed. Of these, 8 are located in Russia, Singapore, Germany and Canada.
PARAMs have also been sold to Tanzania, Armenia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Ghana, Myanmar, Nepal, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam.

<doc id="165300" wikidata="Q326124" url="?curid=165300" title="Directive (European Union)">
<text>A directive is a legal act of the European Union that requires member states to achieve particular goals without dictating how the member states achieve those goals. A directive&#x27;s goals have to be made the goals of one or more new or changed national laws by the member states before this legislation applies to individuals residing in the member states. Directives normally leave member states with a certain amount of leeway as to the exact rules to be adopted. Directives can be adopted by means of a variety of legislative procedures depending on their subject matter.

The text of a draft directive (if subject to the co-decision process, as contentious matters usually are) is prepared by the Commission after consultation with its own and national experts. The draft is presented to the Parliament and the Council—composed of relevant ministers of member governments, initially for evaluation and comment and then subsequently for approval or rejection.

==Justification==

There are justifications for using a directive rather than a regulation: (i) it complies with the EU&#x27;s desire for &quot;subsidiarity&quot;; (ii) it acknowledges that different member States have different legal systems, legal traditions and legal processes; and (iii) each Member State has leeway to choose its own statutory wording, rather than accepting the Brussels&#x27; official &quot;Eurospeak&quot; terminology. 

For example, while EU Directive 2009/20/EC (which simply requires all vessels visiting EU ports to have P&amp;I cover) could have been a regulation (without requiring member states to implement the directive), the desire for subsidiarity was paramount, so a directive was the chosen vehicle.

==Legal basis==
The legal basis for the enactment of directives is Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (formerly Article 249 TEC).

The Council can delegate legislative authority to the Commission and, depending on the area and the appropriate legislative procedure, both institutions can seek to make laws. There are Council directives and Commission directives. Article 288 does not clearly distinguish between legislative acts and administrative acts, as is normally done in national legal systems.

==Legal effect==
Directives are binding only on the member states to whom they are addressed, which can be just one member state or a group of them. In general, however, with the exception of directives related to the Common Agricultural Policy, directives are addressed to all member states.

===Implementation===
When adopted, directives give member states a timetable for the implementation of the intended outcome. Occasionally, the laws of a member state may already comply with this outcome, and the state involved would be required only to keep its laws in place. More commonly, member states are required to make changes to their laws (commonly referred to as transposition) in order for the directive to be implemented correctly. This is done in approximately 99% of the cases. If a member state fails to pass the required national legislation, or if the national legislation does not adequately comply with the requirements of the directive, the European Commission may initiate legal action against the member state in the European Court of Justice. This may also happen when a member state has transposed a directive in theory but has failed to abide by its provisions in practice.

If a Member State fails to implement a Directive timely or correctly, the Directive itself becomes binding on the Member States, meaning that parties in proceedings against the state may rely on provisions of the untimely or incorrectly transposed Directive. An example of a case in which the applicant was able to invoke the provisions of an untimely transposed Directive is the &quot;Verkooijen&quot; case, in which the European Court of Justice rendered a judgement on 6 June 2000 (case no. C-35/98).

The United Kingdom passed a statutory instrument, the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1994, to implement the EU Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive 1993. For reasons that are not clear, the 1994 SI was deemed inadequate and was repealed and replaced by the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. The Consumer Rights Act 2015, a major United Kingdom statute consolidating consumer rights, then abolished the 1999 SI; so presumably the 2015 Act complies with the 1993 EU directive, which remains extant.

===Direct effect===
Even though directives were not originally thought to be binding before they were implemented by member states, the European Court of Justice developed the doctrine of direct effect where unimplemented or badly implemented directives can actually have direct legal force. In the important case of &quot;Francovich v. Italy&quot;, the ECJ extended the principle of &quot;Van Gend en Loos&quot; to provide that Member States who failed to implement a directive could incur liability to pay damages to individuals and companies who had been adversely affected by such non-implementation.

<text>Bölkow was a West German aircraft manufacturer based in Stuttgart, Germany, and later Ottobrunn.

==History==
The company was founded in 1948 by Ludwig Bölkow, who since 1955 with Emil Weiland had developed helicopters for Bölkow Entwicklungen KG.
In June 1968, Bölkow merged with the Messerschmitt AG to form Messerschmitt-Bölkow, a combination that created West Germany&#x27;s largest aircraft company, with sales approaching $150 million (1968 dollars). The move was encouraged by the West German government. In May 1969, the new company merged with Hamburger Flugzeugbau (HFB), becoming Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB). MBB was bought by Daimler-Benz in the early 1990s, becoming part of DASA, which became part of EADS in 2000.

<doc id="165302" wikidata="Q492058" url="?curid=165302" title="XM Satellite Radio">
<text>XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. (XM) was one of the three satellite radio (SDARS) and online radio services in the United States and Canada, operated by Sirius XM Holdings. It provided pay-for-service radio, analogous to subscription cable television. Its service included 73 different music channels, 39 news, sports, talk and entertainment channels, 21 regional traffic and weather channels, and 23 play-by-play sports channels. XM channels were identified by Arbitron with the label &quot;XM&quot; (e.g., &quot;XM32&quot; for &quot;The Bridge&quot;).

The company had its origins in the 1988 formation of the American Mobile Satellite Corporation (AMSC), a consortium of several organizations originally dedicated to satellite broadcasting of telephone, fax, and data signals. In 1992, AMSC established a unit called the American Mobile Radio Corporation dedicated to developing a satellite-based digital radio service; this was spun off as XM Satellite Radio Holdings, Inc. in 1999. The satellite service officially launched on September 25, 2001.

On July 29, 2008, XM and former competitor Sirius Satellite Radio formally completed their merger, following U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approval, forming Sirius XM Radio, Inc. with XM Satellite Radio, Inc. as its subsidiary. On November 12, 2008, Sirius and XM began broadcasting with their new, combined channel lineups. On January 13, 2011, XM Satellite Radio, Inc. was dissolved as a separate entity and merged into Sirius XM Radio, Inc.

==Services==
While the satellite receiver radio service was its primary product, XM also operated audio, data and advertising services.

===Satellite radio===
XM&#x27;s primary business was satellite radio entertainment. XM carried music, news (both simulcast and syndicated programming), sports, talk radio, comedy (both stand-up and radio shows), and radio drama. In addition, XM broadcast local weather and traffic conditions in its larger markets.

===XM Radio Online===
XM Radio Online (XMRO), XM&#x27;s Internet radio product, offered many of XM&#x27;s music stations and could be accessed from any Internet connected computer, or via the SiriusXM mobile app.

===Weather and traffic===
XM also provided data services such as weather information for pilots and weather spotters through its Sirius XM Weather &amp; Emergency datacasting service. This information could be displayed in the cockpit of an aircraft equipped with a satellite weather receiver.

===Commercial adoption and partnerships===
In 2004, JetBlue announced that XM Satellite Radio service would be available in its Embraer regional jets beginning in 2005. Also in 2005, AirTran Airways began putting XM Satellite Radio on their aircraft. United Airlines started carrying XM programming in March 2006. Zipcar, an urban car-sharing service in the United States, initially installed XM receivers in all of their vehicles, but later announced they would be removed from its fleet in the following months due to uncertainty in the market.

===Customer service===
In contrast to its high-quality broadcasts, Sirius/XM&#x27;s customer service has drawn fire from some state governments. In October 2010, Richard Cordray, Ohio&#x27;s Attorney General, began investigating complaints regarding Sirius XM&#x27;s policies on billing, customer solicitation, and subscription renewals and cancellations. The company informed shareholders of the probe shortly thereafter. According to news reports, Arizona, Connecticut, Tennessee, Vermont, and the District of Columbia had expressed interest in participating in the inquiry.

According to Reuters, &quot;The investigations come as Sirius XM, home to programs by Howard Stern and Oprah Winfrey, has found its footing and distanced itself from years of huge losses and questions about its business model.&quot;

In a report obtained in March 2011, The Better Business Bureau reported receiving over 4,500 complaints against Sirius XM in the preceding 36 months, around half of which regarded the company&#x27;s billing and collection practices.

In Missouri, some people registered on the state&#x27;s do-not-call list had complained about receiving repeated calls from Sirius XM workers or agents after canceling their subscriptions. Some Florida customers had reported being billed for automatic renewals of accounts they had canceled. Further, Sirius XM was sued in federal court by a customer accusing it of deceptively raising prices.

The report also stated that &quot;Sirius, in a statement, said it was cooperating with the investigations and that it believed its &#x27;consumer-related practices comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations.&#x27;&quot;

== Company history ==

=== 1988–2000 ===
The American Mobile Satellite Corporation was founded in 1988. In 1991, Lon Levin joined the company. In 1992, the American Mobile Satellite Corporation created a new division known as American Mobile Radio Corp. Later that year, American Mobile brought in WorldSpace as an investor.

On May 16, 1997, American Mobile Satellite and WorldSpace officially changed the name of American Mobile Radio to XM Satellite Radio. Later that month, Lon Levin became president, a position he would hold until 1998. In October 1997, XM Satellite Radio obtained one of only two satellite digital audio radio service licenses offered by the Federal Communications Commission. In 1998, Hugh Panero President and CEO, joined XM Satellite Radio in the same role.

In June 1999, Clear Channel Communications, DirecTV, General Motors, and a private investment group invested US$250 million in XM Satellite Radio convertible debt. On June 7, with GM&#x27;s investment in XM, they entered into a 12-year &quot;Distribution Agreement&quot; between XM and GM subsidiary, OnStar Corporation. The agreement called for exclusive installation of XM Satellite Radio into GM vehicles from November 12, 2001, until November 2013. OnStar had to meet specific escalating installation rates each year, while XM needed to make extensive payments to OnStar for the installation and sale of XM in their vehicles, while sharing revenue earned from these radios with OnStar, as well as payments on the exclusivity agreement.

At the same time as the investment, American Mobile Satellite, still XM&#x27;s parent company, reacquired the stake WorldSpace held in the company. In October 1999, XM Satellite Radio issued 10,241,000 shares of Class A common stock at an IPO price of US$12.00 per share. American Mobile Satellite remained the majority holder of the public company.

In April 2000, American Mobile Satellite Corp. changed its name to Motient. In July, American Honda joined several private investors in a US$235 million preferred stock investment in the company.

=== 2001–2005 ===
On September 25, 2001, XM Satellite Radio launched in San Diego and Dallas–Fort Worth, with nationwide expansion plans set for November. The initial lineup included 100 channels consisting of sports, talk, children&#x27;s programming, entertainment and news.

In October 2001, Motient was heading into bankruptcy and spun off their non-XM satellite division into a joint operation with TMI Communications and Company, L.P., a wholly owned subsidiary of BCE Inc. of Canada. The new venture was known as the &quot;Mobile Satellite Ventures.&quot; In November, Motient was in bankruptcy, and sold off their controlling interest in XM to Hughes Electronics, SingTel and Baron Capital Partners. Hughes Electronics would go on to combine this new interest in with the interest already held by their subsidiary, DirecTV. On November 12, 2001, XM Satellite Radio officially launched its nationwide service.

In January 2003, the company underwent a re-capitalization plan, involving XM exchanging US$300 million in old debt for new debt, while deferring interest for 3-years on the notes. They also restructured payment obligations on the General Motors installation agreement, issuing a convertible bond to GM, issuing a warrant for shares to GM, and establishing a revolving credit facility with GM. The plan also included new funding coming from a placement of over US$300 million in 10% convertible bonds to a group of private investors.

In 2004, General Motors sold Hughes Electronics to Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corp., and sold DirecTV&#x27;s interest in XM Satellite Radio. On March 1, XM Radio launched Instant Traffic and Weather Channels for major metropolitan markets in the United States. Also in 2004, the company partnered with automakers General Motors, Honda, Isuzu, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen, and SAAB to offer in-dash XM receivers on an OEM basis. The Acura TL is the first luxury automobile to offer XM radio as &quot;standard&quot; in every vehicle.

On October 4, 2004, &quot;shock jocks&quot; Opie and Anthony begin broadcasting on a premium XM Satellite Radio station. Also, former National Public Radio host Bob Edwards broadcast the first &quot;Bob Edwards Show&quot; on XM Public Radio on channel 133. On October 20, XM announced an 11-year, US$650 million deal with Major League Baseball to broadcast games live nationwide and to become the Official Satellite Radio provider of Major League Baseball. The agreement granted XM the rights to use the MLB silhouetted batter logo and the collective marks of all major league clubs. As part of the deal, XM created a 24/7 MLB channel called &quot;Home Plate&quot;. The deal started with the 2005 baseball season and ran through 2012, including a 3-year option that MLB could have picked up.

On May 28, 2005, The Wall Street Journal reported that XM had awarded the contract for the XM 5 spacecraft to Space Systems/Loral. On June 7, XM partnered with Audible.com to offer downloadable audio show archives of The Opie and Anthony Show, as well as The Bob Edwards Show. On August 1, XM announced a three-year partnership with the United States Tennis Association to broadcast the US Open tournament through 2007, as well as weekly reports from other US Open Series events. On September 12, XM announced a 10-year, US$100 million deal to carry National Hockey League broadcasts beginning with the 2005–06 season, initially sharing the coverage with SIRIUS but gaining satellite-radio exclusivity from 2007 onward. On November 29, XM launched service in Canada.

=== 2006–2010 ===
In January 2006, XM began broadcasting &quot;Fox News Talk&quot;. On January 9, XM won top honors at the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show. On February 9, XM announced a US$55 million, three-year deal with Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s Harpo Productions.

In May 2006, XM Satellite Radio was sued by the RIAA over XM&#x27;s new portable devices the Inno and Helix. The RIAA claimed these devices were equivalent to a downloading service, whereas XM contended the devices were protected because they recorded similarly to a videotape. XM&#x27;s portable devices allowed the consumer to record a portion of their broadcast similar to a VCR, DVR, or cassette player and play it back later. On January 19, 2007, a district judge ruled that the RIAA could proceed with the lawsuit, rejecting XM&#x27;s defense that the conduct alleged in the complaint—if proved by the RIAA—would be immune under the Audio Home Recording Act of 1991.

On July 24, 2006, Nate Davis, formerly of XO Communications, was made the president and chief operating officer. In October, the XM-4 &quot;Blues&quot; satellite was launched atop a Zenit 3SL rocket.

On January 18, 2007, the Federal Communications Commission ruled that licensing regulations would prohibit a possible merger of XM and Sirius Satellite Radio. On February 19, XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. and Sirius Satellite Radio announced they would merge. On March 20, 2007, XM and Sirius filed a &quot;Consolidated Application for Authority to Transfer Control&quot; at the FCC. On July 24, XM announced that CEO Hugh Panero would leave the company in August, and that then-current President and COO Nate Davis would step in to serve as president and interim CEO.

On March 24, 2008, the United States Department of Justice approved the merger of XM and Sirius Satellite Radio. On July 26, the FCC approved the XM-Sirius merger and on July 29, Sirius and XM officially merged as Sirius XM Radio. XM Canada and Sirius Canada, subsidiaries of the parent companies, remained separate until April 2011.

In early 2009, Sirius XM prepared to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company had a $1 billion debt obligation in 2009 and $175 million immediate obligation due February 17, 2009. On November 12, Gary Parsons resigned as chairman and was replaced by Eddy W. Hartenstein, as the new non-executive chairman.

On November 24, 2010, XM Canada and Sirius Canada announced plans to merge.

=== 2011–present ===
On April 11, 2011, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission approved the merger of the Canadian companies, Sirius and XM, into Sirius XM Canada.

== Technology ==
XM provided digital programming directly from two high-powered satellites in geostationary orbit above the equator: XM Rhythm at 85° west longitude and XM Blues at 115° west longitude in addition to a network of ground-based repeaters. The combination of two satellites and a ground-based repeater network was designed to provide gap-free coverage anywhere within the contiguous U.S., the southern tip of Alaska, and in the southern part of Canada. The signal could also be received in the Caribbean Islands and most of Mexico (reports have stated that areas north of Acapulco were able to receive a steady signal); however, XM is not yet licensed for reception by paid subscribers living in these areas.

The original satellites, XM-1 (&quot;Rock&quot;) and XM-2 (&quot;Roll&quot;) suffered from a generic design fault on the Boeing 702 series satellite (fogging of the solar panels), which meant that their lifetimes were shortened to approximately six years instead of the design goal of 15 years. To compensate for this flaw, XM-3 (&quot;Rhythm&quot;) was launched ahead of its planned schedule on February 28, 2005, and moved into XM-1&#x27;s previous location of 85° WL. XM-1 was then moved to be co-located with XM-2 at 115° WL, where each satellite operated only one transponder (thus broadcasting half the bandwidth each) to conserve energy and cut the power consumption in half while XM-4 (&quot;Blues&quot;) was readied for launch. Subsequently, XM launched ground-spare XM-4 (&quot;Blues&quot;) ahead of schedule on October 30, 2006, into the 115° WL location to complete the satellite replacement program. On December 15, 2006, XM-1 was finally powered down and then drifted back to its original location at 85° WL, where it remained as a backup to XM-3. XM-2 was similarly powered down and remained as a backup to XM-4. This makes the current active satellites as XM-3 &quot;Rhythm&quot; and XM-4 &quot;Blues&quot; with two in-orbit spares.
On June 7, 2005, Space Systems/Loral announced that it had been awarded a contract for XM-5. XM-5 was to feature two large, unfurlable antennas. Sirius&#x27; Radiosat 5, also to be built by Loral, was slated to have a similar single large antenna.

In American and Canadian metropolitan areas, XM and its Canadian licensee &quot;Canadian Satellite Radio&quot; (CSR) and operating as Sirius XM Canada, owned and operated a network of approximately 900 terrestrial repeater stations, meant to compensate for satellite signal blockage by buildings, tunnels, and bridges. In the United States, XM owned and operated approximately 800 repeater sites, covering 60 markets; in Canada, CSR was installing approximately 80 to 100 repeaters that were planned to be owned and operated by CSR in the 16 largest Canadian cities. The actual number of repeater sites varies as the signal is regularly tested and monitored for optimal performance. The actual number of sites in the United States has dropped from the original 1,000 installed when the service first launched in 2001. The repeaters transmit in the same frequency band as the satellites. A typical city contains 20 or more terrestrial stations. Typically, the receiver owner is unaware when a terrestrial station is being used, unless he or she checks antenna information from the receiver being used. Due to a FCC filing in October 2006, the latest list of XM&#x27;s US terrestrial repeater network was made available to the public. 

The XM signal used 12.5 MHz of the S band: 2332.5 to 2345.0 MHz. XM provided 128 kilobits per second of its bandwidth to OnStar Corporation for use with XM-enabled GM vehicles, regardless of whether their owners are XM subscribers. American Honda also retained the right to some of the company&#x27;s bandwidth to transmit messages to Acura vehicles via a service known as AcuraLink.

XM NavTraffic, an optional service, transmitted coded traffic information directly to vehicle navigation systems using TMC technology.

Audio channels on XM were digitally compressed using the CT-aacPlus (HE-AAC) codec from Coding Technologies for most channels. That said, some channels rely on the AMBE codec from Digital Voice Systems (e.g., for voice channels), including all of the Traffic and Weather channels.

The XM radio signal was broadcast on 6 separate radio carriers within the 12.5 MHz allocation. The entire content of the radio service, including both data and audio content, was represented by only two carriers. The other 4 carriers carried duplicates of the same content to achieve redundancy through signal diversity. The data on each carrier is encoded using time-delayed and error-correction schemes to enhance availability. Effectively, the total radio spectrum used for content is a little over 4 MHz.

Each two-carrier group broadcast 100 8-kilobit-per-second streams in approximately 4 MHz of radio spectrum. These streams were combined using a patented process to form a variable number of channels using a variety of bitrates. Bandwidth is separated into segments of 4-kilobit-per-second virtual &quot;streams&quot; which are combined to form audio and data &quot;channels&quot; of varying bitrates from 4 to 64 kilobits-per-second.

XM preprocessed audio content using Neural Audio processors that are optimized for the aacPlus codec, including spectral band replication (SBR). Audio was stored digitally in Dalet audio library systems using an industry-standard MPEG-1 Layer II at 384 kbit/s, sometimes known as MUSICAM. The audio is further processed by the Neural Audio processors on the way to broadcast.

In the past, the Sirius XM Pops channel, which aired classical music, was broadcast in 5.1 surround sound. The technology, titled XM HD Surround, is the result of a partnership between XM and Neural Audio Corporation which provides content with six discrete channels of digital audio. The former XM Live channel also broadcast in this format for certain concerts and studio performances. XM manufacturing partners such as Denon, Onkyo, Pioneer Electronics (USA) Inc., and Yamaha introduced home audio systems capable of playing XM HD Surround. It is not known if the XM HD Surround technology is used on the service as of 2015.

==Clear Channel programming agreement==
In 1998, Clear Channel Communications invested in XM. The companies entered into agreements which provided for certain programming and director designation arrangements as long as Clear Channel retained the full amount of its original investment in XM. One positive consequence of this was that XM had (and still has) exclusive programming rights to all Clear Channel content, including popular national shows like Coast to Coast AM, but the shows could only be broadcast inside the bandwidth controlled by Clear Channel. In June 2003, Clear Channel entered into a forward sales agreement relating to its ownership of XM. During the third quarter of 2005, Clear Channel and XM arbitrated the impact of this agreement on the Operational Assistance Agreement and the Director Designation Agreement. The Arbitration Panel decided that the Operational Assistance Agreement would remain in effect, including Clear Channel&#x27;s right to receive a revenue share of commercial advertising on programming it provides to XM, but declined to enforce the Director Designation Agreement, which forced the Mays family members off the board of directors. Per the original agreement, Clear Channel had the right to program 409.6 kbit/s (or 10%) of XM bandwidth, requiring XM to include commercial advertising on the existing Nashville!, KISS, Mix, and Sunny (now The Music Summit). The amount of advertising on the music channels amounts up to 4 minutes per hour, similar to the amount of advertising XM included before going commercial free. Exceptions include syndicated music shows which carry network spots. Clear Channel advertising on XM is handled by its subsidiary, Premiere Radio Networks. Clear Channel also provided existing talk channel programming (Fox Sports Radio, Extreme XM, Talk Radio). Clear Channel also controlled America Right (formerly Buzz XM), but through a series of show swaps, most non-Clear Channel content was removed and programming control returned to XM Radio. Plans to introduce new regional based talk channels, which would have featured a regional 5 minute newscast for each area of the country, were canceled. Instead, Clear Channel chose to introduce other music and talk channels. Newer channels including ReachMD, America&#x27;s Talk remain on the air. The Pink Channel, National Lampoon Comedy Radio, WSIX-FM, WLW, and Rock@Random were launched and later removed, and replaced by channels like Bollywood &amp; Beyond, The Music Summit, and Sixx Sense, all of which are on the air today.

Seen as a blow to XM&#x27;s 100% commercial-free music channel status, XM Executive Vice President of Programming Eric Logan released a programming announcement to XM subscribers on the company&#x27;s website that reiterated XM&#x27;s commitment to commercial-free music while noting that XM still had the most commercial-free music and that more commercial-free music channels will be added in the near future to ensure that XM will still have more commercial-free music than competitor Sirius Satellite Radio. On April 17, 2006, XM launched US Country (XM17), Flight 26 (XM26), XM Hitlist (XM30) and Escape (XM78) to provide commercial free music in the formats of the Clear Channel programmed music channels which were going to begin airing commercials. In response, Sirius has advertised that they are the only satellite radio provider that has 100% commercial-free music channels. Both XM and Sirius air commercials on their news, talk, and sports channels.

The Clear Channel forward sales agreement with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Inc was terminated on August 2, 2006. The termination resulted in Clear Channel Investments, Inc. paying Bear Stearns a total of $83.1 million, which was the value of Clear Channel&#x27;s stake in XM. The accreted value of the debt was $92.9 million, and the fair value of the collar was an asset of $6.0 million, which resulted in a net gain of $3.8 million for Clear Channel.

==PCR and DirectPCR==
At the heart of the TimeTrax controversy was the XM PCR: a computer-controlled XM Receiver. Unlike the other receivers, which could be used in the car or home stereo, the XM PCR required a computer to run. A software application on the computer acted as the radio&#x27;s controls and display, which led to a flurry of third-party developers who wanted to make a PCR replacement. Many of them received Cease and Desist letters from the XM company. Once the PCR was discontinued, for the reasons listed above, people found that the XM Direct, a receiver intended to be used in satellite-ready car stereos, can be connected to a computer with a very simple adapter cable. Some people have dubbed the entire kit, with receiver, cable, and software, the Direct PCR. While the original PCR software does not control the XM Direct receiver, several community developers have continued to develop PCR replacement software.

==Merger with Sirius Satellite Radio and company restructuring==
On February 19, 2007, XM announced a merger deal with competitor Sirius Satellite Radio. The merger combined the two radio services and created a single satellite radio network in the United States and Canada.

The United States Department of Justice announced on March 24, 2008, that it had closed its investigation of the merger because it &quot;concluded that the evidence does not demonstrate that the proposed merger of XM and Sirius was likely to substantially lessen competition.&quot;

On June 16, 2008, FCC Chairman Kevin Martin told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that he had decided to approve the XM-Sirius Merger after the companies agreed in the previous week to concessions intended to prevent the new company from raising prices or stifling competition. Martin issued an order to approve the merger, according to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; – setting the stage for a final vote which could have occurred any time after his recommendation was circulated.

The XM–Sirius merger gained its final governmental approval from the Federal Communications Commission on July 25, 2008, with Martin and commissioners Robert M. McDowell and deciding vote Deborah Taylor Tate voting in the affirmative. As a term of the merger, the combined company will be fined almost $20 million for failing to create and market interchangeable radios capable of receiving signals from both companies prior to the merger.

==iPhone, iPod Touch, BlackBerry and Android applications==

XM developed a software application for use on the Apple iPhone and Apple iPod Touch devices that allowed XM subscribers to listen to its programming over the Apple devices. The Sirius XM iPhone App became available in the Apple iTunes Store on June 17, 2009.

All SiriusXM Internet Radio subscribers are able to download the application from the Apple iTunes App-Store for free. Listening on an iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch is included with some subscription packages, a separate fee is required with other packages.

On February 4, 2010, SiriusXM released an app for the Research In Motion BlackBerry line of smartphones, including the Storm (Series 9500), Bold (Series 9000 and 9700), Tour (Series 9600) and Curve (Series 8500 and 8900). Like the Apple iPhone/iPod Touch application, the BlackBerry app is free but requires a SiriusXM subscription.

SiriusXM is also available for download on Android devices through Google Play.

The applications carry most of the XM music, talk, sports and entertainment programming, as well as some exclusive Internet-only content. The mobile applications also carry a select number of channels from the &quot;Best of SIRIUS/XM&quot; packages, dependent on the subscriber&#x27;s subscription level.

==Canada==
In November 2004, Canadian Satellite Radio filed an application with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to bring the XM service to Canada. Along with Sirius Canada and the consortium of CHUM Limited and Astral Media, CSR was one of three applications for national subscription radio services submitted to the CRTC.

On June 16, 2005, the CRTC approved all three applications. The decisions were appealed to the Canadian federal cabinet by a number of broadcasting, labor, and arts and culture organizations, including the Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, CHUM Limited, and the National Campus and Community Radio Association. The groups objected to the satellite radio applicants&#x27; approach to and reduced levels of Canadian content and French-language programming, along with the exclusion of Canadian non-commercial broadcasting. After a lengthy debate, Cabinet rejected the appeals on September 9, 2005.

XM&#x27;s Canadian channels appeared on US receivers on November 17, 2005. On November 29, 2005, XM Canada officially launched.

<doc id="165304" wikidata="Q672788" url="?curid=165304" title="Common Foreign and Security Policy">
<text>The Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) is the organised, agreed foreign policy of the European Union (EU) for mainly security and defence diplomacy and actions. CFSP deals only with a specific part of the EU&#x27;s external relations, which domains include mainly Trade and Commercial Policy and other areas such as funding to third countries, etc. Decisions require unanimity among member states in the Council of the European Union, but once agreed, certain aspects can be further decided by qualified majority voting. Foreign policy is chaired and represented by the EU&#x27;s High Representative, currently Kaja Kallas.

The CFSP sees the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) as responsible for the territorial defence of Europe and reconciliation. However, since 1999, the European Union is responsible for implementing missions such as peacekeeping and policing of treaties. A phrase often used to describe the relationship between the EU forces and NATO is &quot;separable, but not separate&quot;. The same forces and capabilities form the basis of both EU and NATO efforts, but portions can be allocated to the European Union if necessary.

==History==

===1957–1993===
Co-operation in international trade negotiations, under the EU&#x27;s Common Commercial Policy, dates back to the establishment of the community in 1957. The CFSP itself has its origins in the formation of European Political Co-operation (EPC) in 1970. European Political Co-operation was an informal consultation process between member states on foreign policy matters, with the aim of creating a common approach to foreign policy issues and promoting both the EC&#x27;s own interests and those of the international community as a whole. This includes promoting international co-operation, respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.

===1993–2009: Pillar system===
The weaknesses evident in EPC, apparent, for example during the Yugoslav wars, led to a desire to strengthen foreign policy. That was consolidated in the Maastricht Treaty, which entered into force in 1993 and established the European Union. While the previously existing supranational European Economic Community became one of three pillars, two more pillars were erected. The second CFSP-pillar was based on intergovernmentalism, which meant unanimity between members in the Council of Ministers and little influence by the other institutions.

The Amsterdam Treaty created the office of the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (held by Javier Solana until 1 December 2009) to co-ordinate and represent the EU&#x27;s foreign policy.

===2009–present: Consolidation===
The Treaty of Lisbon took effect in December 2009 and brought an end to the pillar system. The CFSP&#x27;s status of being a &quot;pillar&quot; thus ended. Furthermore, in an effort to ensure greater co-ordination and consistency in EU foreign policy, the Treaty of Lisbon created a &quot;High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy&quot;, de facto merging the post of High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and European Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy. Since December 2011 the High Representative (HR) is in charge of the European External Action Service (EEAS), which was also created by the Treaty of Lisbon. It essentially is intended to be a common Foreign Office or Diplomatic Corps for the European Union.

==Objectives==
According to Article J.1 of title V of the Maastricht Treaty, the European Union defines and implements a common foreign and security policy that covers all areas of foreign and security policy, the objectives of which are to:
* Safeguard the common values, fundamental interests, independence and integrity of the Union in conformity with the principles of the United Nations Charter;
* Strengthen the security of the Union in all ways;
* Preserve peace and strengthen international security, in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, as well as the principles of the Helsinki Final Act and the objectives of the Paris Charter, including those on external borders;
* Promote international co-operation;
* Develop and consolidate democracy and the rule of law, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.

==Elements==

===Types of policy===
The European Council defines the principles and general guidelines for the CFSP as well as common strategies to be implemented by the EU. On the basis of those guidelines the Council of Ministers adopts &quot;joint actions&quot; or &quot;common positions&quot;. &quot;Joint actions&quot; address specific situations where operation action by the EU is considered necessary and lay down the objectives, scope and means to be made available to the EU. They commit the member states. &quot;Common positions&quot; on the other hand, define the approach that the EU takes on a certain matter of geographical or thematic nature, and define in the abstract the general guidelines to which the national policies of Member states must conform.

===High Representative===
The High Representative, in conjunction with the President of the European Council, speaks on behalf of the EU in agreed foreign policy matters and can have the task of articulating ambiguous policy positions created by disagreements among member states. The Common Foreign and Security Policy requires unanimity among the 27 member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular policy. Disagreements in CFSP, such as those that occurred over the war in Iraq, are not uncommon.

The High Representative also coordinates the work of the European Union Special Representatives. With the Lisbon Treaty taking effect, the position became distinct from the Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers. The High Representative serves as the head of the European Defence Agency and exercises the same functions over the Common Security and Defence Policy as the CFSP. On 1 December 2009, Catherine Ashton took over Javier Solana&#x27;s post as the High Representative, who has held the post since 1999. On 30 August 2014 it was announced by Herman Van Rompuy that Federica Mogherini would be the new High Representative, effective on 1 November 2014.

===Bodies===
There are a number of bodies set up within the context of the CFSP. Within the council, there is the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) configuration, essentially a meeting of foreign ministers and the Political and Security Committee or PSC, which monitors the international situation in the areas covered by the CFSP and contributes by delivering opinions to the Council of Ministers, either at its request or its own initiative, and also monitors the implementation of agreed policies.

The European Defence Agency (EDA) encourages increase in defence capabilities, military research and the establishment of a European internal market for military technology. Two bodies carried over from the Western European Union (see defence, below) are the European Union Institute for Security Studies (EUISS) and the European Union Satellite Centre (EUSC).
The EUISS is the European Union&#x27;s in-house think tank. Its mission is to find a common security culture for the EU, to help develop and project the CFSP, and to enrich Europe&#x27;s strategic debate.
The EUSC is providing analysis of satellite imagery and collateral data.

==Defence policy==

The Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) is the part of the CFSP that relates to defence and crisis management, implemented by EU structures in CSDP missions drawing on civilian and military assets provided by member states. Based on articles 42–46 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), the CSDP also entails a mutual defence clause amongst member states as well as a Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) in which 25 of the 28 national armed forces pursue structural integration.

Article 42.2 of TEU states that the CSDP includes the &#x27;progressive framing&#x27; of a common Union defence policy, and will lead to a common defence, when the European Council of national heads of state or government, acting unanimously, so decides.

When participating in CSDP missions abroad for peace-keeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, the national armed forces may either act in an existing national force framework, as part of an intergovemental force made available to the CSDP through article 42.3 of TEU, such as the European Corps (Eurocorps), the EU Battlegroups (EUBG) or the European Gendarmerie Force (Eurogendfor).

The Union&#x27;s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR/VP) is responsible for proposing and implementing CSDP decisions. Such decisions are taken by the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC), generally requiring unanimity.

The CSDP organisation, headed by the HR/VP, comprises relevant sections of the External Action Service (EEAS) – including the operational headquarters (MPCC) of the Military Staff (EUMS) – a number of FAC preparatory bodies – such as the Military Committee (EUMC) – as well as four Agencies, including the Defence Agency (EDA). Since 2017, the CSDP has also been facilitated by a defence fund and a Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD).

===Neutrality===
Although the Irish people were reassured of their neutrality before agreeing to the Nice Treaty, the Finnish Prime Minister, Matti Vanhanen, on 5 July 2006, while speaking to the European Parliament as Council President declared:
Nevertheless, a similar guarantee on neutrality in relation to the Treaty of Lisbon was granted to Ireland at the European Council of 18/19 June 2009:
The European Council also agreed that other concerns of the Irish people, as presented by the Taoiseach, relating to taxation policy, the right to life, education and the family, and Ireland&#x27;s traditional policy of military neutrality, would be addressed to the mutual satisfaction of Ireland and the other Member States, by way of the necessary legal guarantees.
== Stopping humanitarian atrocities ==
EU foreign policy is committed to the protection of human rights. Research suggests that rhetoric along these lines from EU decision-makers is consistent with actual EU foreign policy activity. 
Military and economic interventions by the EU are consistently more likely in countries where violence explicitly targets civilians. Likewise, human rights sanctions are consistently applied against states responsible for human rights violations. Geostrategic concerns also influence EU action, as the EU has been &quot;most attentive to human rights violations in non-EU European states, followed by countries in sub-Saharan Africa, while it has been least active in Asia and the Americas&quot;.

== European Peace Facility ==
The European Peace Facility (EPF) is an off-budget EU financing instrument set up in March 2021, aiming towards the delivering of military aid to partner countries and funding the deployment of EU military missions abroad under the CFSP.

==Counterterrorism policy==

The European Union considers to be terrorist organisations those groups or those entities that are controlled directly or indirectly by persons who commit or attempt to commit terrorist acts, participating in these groups, or facilitating the execution of terrorist plans. It also includes defining those groups and entities acting on behalf or under the direction of such persons, groups and entities, including funds derived or generated from property owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such persons or by associated persons, groups and entities. The watch list was reviewed for the Law Library of Congress in 2007.

The European Union gives a definition of terrorism as Common Position 2001/931/CFSP of 27 December 2001, also referred to by successive acts. It highlights them as intentional acts which, given their nature or context as defined crimes under domestic law, may seriously harm a State or an international organization when committed for the purpose of:
* seriously intimidating a population
* unduly compelling a Government or international organization to perform or abstain from performing any act
* seriously destabilizing or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social constructs

===List of terrorist organisations===

The list of terrorist organisations was started in 2001 with the 13 organisations listed on 27 December of Common Position 2001/931/CFSP. The European Community had not listed Al-Qaeda although the 9/11 attacks had been the instigator of the list. It has been updated by a number of subsequent declarations, such as Common Position 2006/231/CFSP of 21 December 2005; for example so as to include LTTE. Common Position 2005/847/CFSP of the European Council of 29 November 2005 updated the list of these organizations,

==Outside the CFSP==

Besides its own foreign and security policy, the commission is also gaining greater representation in international bodies. Representation in international bodies is previously through the European Commissioner for External Relations, who worked alongside the High Representative, but now with the High Representative directly as a Commission vice-president. In the UN the EU has gained influence in areas such as aid due to its large contributions in that field (see below). 

In the G8 and the G20, the EU has the rights of membership besides that of chairing/hosting summit meetings. The EU is represented at the G8 by the presidents of the commission and the council. At the G20, its exact representation depends on the format of the individual meetings and may also include officials from the ECB. For all of these meetings, the EU has established informal processes to coordinate its policies. In the World Trade Organisation (WTO), where all 27 member states are represented, the EU as a body is represented by Trade Commissioner.

The influence of the EU is also felt through the enlargement. The potential benefits of becoming a member of the EU act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the EU&#x27;s accession criteria, and are considered a major factor contributing to the reform and stabilisation of former Communist countries in Eastern Europe. This influence on the internal affairs of other countries is generally referred to as &quot;soft power&quot;, as opposed to military &quot;hard power&quot;. 

An example of the support the European Union offers to the reform processes of its neighbours is EUBAM, the European Union Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine, which assists the governments of Moldova and Ukraine in approximating their border and customs procedures to EU standards.

The European Union&#x27;s influential economic status and its nation-like characteristics has been acknowledged by the United States&#x27; Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in their publication &quot;The World Factbook&quot;. The EU was included in the &quot;Factbook&quot; in December 2004.

===Humanitarian aid===
The European Community humanitarian aid office, or &quot;ECHO&quot;, provides humanitarian aid from the EU to developing countries. In 2006 its budget amounted to 671 million euro, 48% of which went to the ACP countries. Counting the EU&#x27;s own contributions and those of its member states together, the EU is the largest aid donor in the world.

The EU&#x27;s aid has previously been criticised by the think-tank Open Europe for being inefficient, mis-targeted and linked to economic objectives. Some charities have claimed European governments have inflated the amount they have spent on aid by incorrectly including money spent on debt relief, foreign students, and refugees. Under the de-inflated figures, the EU did not reach its internal aid target in 2006 and the EU would not reach the international target of 0.7% of GNP until 2015. However, only a few countries have reached that target. In 2005, EU aid was 0.34% of GNP, which was higher than that of the United States and Japan. The ex commissioner for aid, Louis Michel, has called for aid to be delivered more rapidly, to greater effect, and on humanitarian principles.

<doc id="165308" wikidata="Q1136388" url="?curid=165308" title="Faces (band)">
<text>Faces are an English rock band formed in London in 1969. It was formed by members of Small Faces after lead singer and guitarist Steve Marriott left to form Humble Pie. The remaining Small Faces—Ian McLagan (keyboards), Ronnie Lane (electric bass, vocals), and Kenney Jones (drums and percussion)—were joined by guitarist Ronnie Wood and singer Rod Stewart, both from the Jeff Beck Group, and the new line-up was renamed Faces.

The band had a unique arrangement, as Rod Stewart had signed a separate solo recording contract with the Mercury label shortly before joining the group, which was signed to Warner Bros. Band members often contributed to Stewart&#x27;s solo albums as contract players, and Faces live shows of the period would feature as much of Stewart&#x27;s solo material as that of the band, which later fuelled tensions amongst them when they began to effectively be viewed as Stewart&#x27;s &#x27;backing band&#x27;. The group lacked a single main songwriter as from the beginning each member would work in tandem to offer songs for each of their albums (Stewart and Wood most often wrote together as a duo, as did Lane and Wood, while Lane would usually contribute at least one solo composition per album). While Stewart was the primary lead singer, both Lane and Wood would also sing lead vocals on several tracks (Lane usually sang lead on his own solo compositions). Their first two albums, &quot;First Step&quot; (1970) and &quot;Long Player&quot; (1971), lacked a hit single, but their third album, 1971&#x27;s &quot;A Nod Is As Good As a Wink... to a Blind Horse&quot;, bolstered by the success of Stewart&#x27;s solo work, became a worldwide hit, peaking at number 2 on the UK Albums Chart and number 6 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart and spawning the band&#x27;s first hit single, &quot;Stay with Me&quot;.

Tensions in the band came to a head during the recording of their fourth (and final) studio album, 1973&#x27;s &quot;Ooh La La&quot;. Ronnie Lane, who was a founding member of Small Faces, left over his diminished role in the band in 1973, and was replaced by Tetsu Yamauchi on bass. The band continued to tour throughout 1974 and 1975, releasing a live album, &quot;Coast to Coast: Overture and Beginners&quot;, in 1974 that was jointly credited to Rod Stewart/Faces. Ronnie Wood also began to drift from the group over this period, releasing two solo albums of his own, and appearing as a guest musician on two Rolling Stones albums and joining them on tour in 1975. He was briefly augmented by Jesse Ed Davis on guitars before the band broke up at the end of 1975.

A greatest hits collection, &quot;Snakes and Ladders / The Best of Faces&quot;, appeared in 1976, and additional retrospective albums would appear over the subsequent decades. Stewart would continue his successful solo career, while Ronnie Wood would formally join the Rolling Stones as a permanent member in 1976. Kenney Jones joined the Who as a replacement for the deceased Keith Moon in 1978. Ian McLagan would go on to work as a session and touring musician with a number of acts (including his own bands) throughout the 1970s until his death in 2014, while Ronnie Lane&#x27;s activities in the music business (which included 1977&#x27;s critically lauded &quot;Rough Mix&quot; collaboration with Pete Townshend) were severely curtailed by 1980 due to the onset of multiple sclerosis which forced his eventual retirement by the early 1990s.

The original Small Faces would have a reunion during the mid to late 1970s with Marriott, Jones, and McLagan joined by Rick Wills on bass guitar, as Lane withdrew early due to his illness. In February 1993 original Faces bandmates Rod Stewart and Ron Wood appeared together on a studio soundstage before a live audience in Los Angeles to record an episode of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Unplugged &quot; series airing the following May; an album with excerpts from the performance, Unplugged...and Seated - including several Faces songs - was subsequently released on CD to considerable acclaim. A number of partial reunions of the Faces were rumoured throughout the 2000s, with various one-off performances involving surviving members occurring. In 2010–11 a brief reunion tour occurred with Mick Hucknall and Glen Matlock on vocals and bass respectively. The Faces and Small Faces were jointly inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012. Stewart was scheduled to perform with the rest of the band, but was unable to do so at the last minute due to illness; he was replaced by Hucknall.

In 2021, Jones, Stewart, and Wood reunited to record a new album under the Faces grouping.

==History==
The first collaboration among the future Faces was in a formation called Quiet Melon, which also featured Wood&#x27;s older brother Art Wood and Kim Gardner; they recorded four songs and played a few shows in May 1969, during a break in Ronnie Wood&#x27;s and Rod Stewart&#x27;s commitments with The Jeff Beck Group. Later that summer Wood and Stewart parted ways with Beck and joined Lane, McLagan and Jones full-time. Prior to any releases by the new Faces line-up, Wood and McLagan appeared on Stewart&#x27;s first solo album in 1969, &quot;An Old Raincoat Won&#x27;t Ever Let You Down&quot; (known as &quot;The Rod Stewart Album&quot; in the US). The rest of the backing band on the album included drummer Micky Waller, keyboardist Keith Emerson and guitarists Martin Pugh (of Steamhammer, and later Armageddon and 7th Order) and Martin Quittenton (also from Steamhammer).

With the addition of Wood and Stewart, the &quot;small&quot; part of the original band name was dropped, partly because the two newcomers (at 5&#x27;9&quot; and 5&#x27;10&quot; respectively) were significantly taller than the three former Small Faces. Hoping to capitalise on the Small Faces&#x27; earlier success, record company executives wanted the band to keep their old name; however, the band objected, arguing the personnel changes resulted in a group very different from the Small Faces. As a compromise, in the US their debut album was credited to the Small Faces, while subsequent albums appeared under their new name.

The group regularly toured Britain, Europe and the United States from 1970 to 1975, and were among the top-grossing live acts in that period; in 1974 their touring also encompassed Australia, New Zealand and Japan. They toured the United States and Canada in 1975. Among their most successful songs were &quot;Had Me a Real Good Time&quot;, their breakthrough UK hit &quot;Stay with Me&quot;, &quot;Cindy Incidentally&quot; and &quot;Pool Hall Richard&quot;. As Rod Stewart&#x27;s solo career became more successful than that of the group, the band became overshadowed by their lead singer. A disillusioned Ronnie Lane left the band in 1973; one reason given later for his departure was frustration over not having more opportunities to sing lead vocals.

Lane&#x27;s role as bassist was taken over by Tetsu Yamauchi (who had replaced Andy Fraser in Free). Released just months before Lane left the band, the Faces&#x27; final studio album was &quot;Ooh La La&quot;.

The following year a live album was released, entitled &quot;Coast to Coast: Overture and Beginners&quot;; it was criticised by reviewers for being poorly recorded and thought out. It featured selections from their late 1973 tour, the first featuring Yamauchi. They recorded a few tracks for another studio album, but had lost enthusiasm and their final release as a group was the late 1974 UK Top 20 hit &quot;You Can Make Me Dance, Sing or Anything&quot;. In 1975 Wood began working with the Rolling Stones, which brought differences between Stewart and the others to a head, and after a troubled fall US tour (with Jesse Ed Davis on rhythm guitar), in December the band announced that they were splitting.

===Post-Faces===
The members have had varied post-band careers. Rod Stewart&#x27;s solo career continues to be extremely successful. Ron Wood joined the Rolling Stones and later became a full member with the departure of Mick Taylor. He remains a member of The Stones to this day and enjoys a parallel career as a portrait artist. Within months of leaving the band in 1973, Ronnie Lane formed Slim Chance and immediately scored a UK hit single with &quot;How Come?&quot; but this early success was soon compromised by a subsequent self-organised UK tour that ended in financial disaster. Nonetheless, three Slim Chance albums followed on Island Records between 1974 and 76, and in 1977 he also worked on &quot;Rough Mix&quot;. a joint album with Who guitarist Pete Townshend. During this time Lane was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and after a final album in 1979 his solo career came to a premature end as his illness set in. Kenney Jones turned to session work and later joined the Who following the death of Keith Moon. Ian McLagan stated in a 2004 interview that Pete Townshend also asked him to join the Who, but he had already promised Keith Richards that he would tour as a Rolling Stones sideman. McLagan moved to the United States, where he formed Ian McLagan &amp; the Bump Band. Tetsu Yamauchi returned to his native Japan, where he recorded and toured as a jazz musician. He is now retired from music. 

There was also a Small Faces reunion in the late 1970s (without Ronnie Lane) that resulted in two albums; and in 1981 Ronnie Lane and Steve Marriott collaborated on the album &quot;The Legendary Majik Mijits&quot;.

Faces reformed for the encore of Rod Stewart&#x27;s Wembley Stadium concert in 1986. Ronnie Lane, by then seriously debilitated by multiple sclerosis, appeared on stage in a wheelchair. He sang, but was unable to play bass and Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones filled in for him. The same line-up (minus Lane) reunited once more in 1993 when Rod Stewart was awarded the Lifetime Achievement award at the Brit Awards. Ronnie Lane made one of his final concert appearances in 1992 at a Ronnie Wood show with Ian McLagan on keyboards; the progression of Lane&#x27;s multiple sclerosis finally forced his retirement from music by the mid-1990s and he died in 1997.

In February 1993 Rod Stewart and Ron Wood appeared together on a studio soundstage before a live audience in Los Angeles to record an episode of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Unplugged &quot; series airing the following May; an album with excerpts from the performance, Unplugged...and Seated - including several Faces songs - was subsequently released on CD to considerable acclaim.

In 2004 a 4-disc Faces box set entitled &quot;Five Guys Walk into a Bar...&quot; was released by Rhino Records, featuring many of the band&#x27;s most popular tracks as well as several previously unreleased songs. Drummer Kenney Jones formed a group called the Jones Gang, together with singer Robert Hart (formerly of Bad Company), Patrick Walford and bassist Rick Wills (formerly of Foreigner).

During 2004 and early 2005 the surviving Faces had several near-reunions, none of which featured more than three members at the same time: In May 2004 Kenney Jones and Ronnie Wood joined Ian McLagan on stage at his concert at The Mean Fiddler in London. In August 2004 Wood and McLagan joined Stewart at the Hollywood Bowl; Wood also appeared at several other of Stewart&#x27;s 2004 gigs, including New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden, the Royal Albert Hall and a street performance in London for an audience of 80,000. In March 2005 McLagan joined Ronnie Wood&#x27;s band at a London show, which also featured Kenney Jones on drums for the final encore; and in December 2005 Wood joined Ian McLagan &amp; the Bump Band for three numbers at a concert in Houston, Texas.

===Reunion===
On 11 June 2008, Rod Stewart announced that the surviving Faces were discussing a possible reunion, envisioning making a recording and/or performing at least one or two concerts. On 18 November Rod Stewart, Ron Wood, Ian McLagan and Kenney Jones reunited along with Rod Stewart&#x27;s touring bassist Conrad Korsch for a rehearsal &quot;just to check if they can remember the songs&quot;; the band&#x27;s official reunion website was launched earlier the same month. However, on 23 January 2009, a spokesman for Rod Stewart denied there were any plans for a 2009 Faces reunion tour.

On 24 September 2009, it was announced that the Faces, minus Rod Stewart, would reunite for a one-off charity show for the Performing Rights Society&#x27;s Music Members&#x27; Benevolent Fund, at the Royal Albert Hall in London. &quot;This will be so special for us, staging a reunion for such a wonderful and prestigious event,&quot; said Ronnie Wood when the announcement of the concert was made. &quot;Sadly Ronnie Lane can&#x27;t be with us, but I&#x27;m sure he will be there in spirit, God bless him.&quot; Lane&#x27;s ex-wife, Katy, is one of many to receive assistance from the charity. The event was held on 25 October. Ronnie Wood, Kenney Jones and Ian McLagan all took part, with various vocalists, including Mick Hucknall, replacing Stewart, and Bill Wyman filling in for the late Ronnie Lane on bass guitar.

On 25 May 2010, it was announced that the Faces had officially reformed with Hucknall taking on vocal duties, and Glen Matlock of the Sex Pistols on bass. The band played festival dates in both 2010 and 2011, with dates in the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands and Japan.

The Small Faces/Faces were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012. On 23 March, the Faces announced that they would reunite with Rod Stewart to play at the induction ceremony for the first time in 19 years. However, on the eve of the ceremony, Stewart bowed out owing to a bout of influenza and Hucknall was asked to sing in his place. In June 2013, speaking in an interview on YouTube, Kenney Jones confirmed the band&#x27;s intention to reunite with Stewart for a tour in 2014. However, Ian McLagan died on 3 December 2014, putting this reunion in doubt.

Rod Stewart, Ronnie Wood and Kenney Jones performed a short set at Hurtwood Polo Club on 5 September 2015 for charity, following their brief reunion at Rod Stewart&#x27;s private party for his 70th birthday in January of that year. The reunion show was critically acclaimed, with &quot;The Telegraph&quot; newspaper reviewing the performance as &quot;5 star,&quot; under the headline of &quot;worth the 40-year wait.&quot;

A further reunion occurred in 2019 at a private event. In 2020, Rod Stewart reunited with Ronnie Wood and Kenney Jones to perform &quot;Stay With Me&quot; as the finale of that years Brit Awards Ceremony.

On 19 July 2021, it was reported that Jones, Stewart and Wood had reunited in the studio to record new music.

===Influence on music===
Although they enjoyed only modest success compared to contemporaries such as the Who and the Rolling Stones, the Faces have had considerable influence on latter-day rock revivalists. Their back-to-basics rock and roll sound was cited as influential by punk rock bands, such as the Damned and the Sex Pistols.

They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012.

<text>Monmouth College is a private Presbyterian liberal arts college in Monmouth, Illinois. It enrolls approximately 767 students who choose courses from 40 major programs, 43 minors, and 17 pre-professional programs in a core curriculum. It offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees.

==History==
Monmouth College was founded on April 18, 1853, by the Second Presbytery of Illinois of the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. Founded as Monmouth Academy, the school became Monmouth College after receiving a charter from the state legislature on September 3, 1856. The college remains affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA) and is a member of the Associated Colleges of the Midwest, a consortium of small, private liberal arts colleges. The college&#x27;s motto &quot;Lux&quot; (&quot;Light&quot;) appears on its seal.

The first president, David Wallace built two mission churches in Massachusetts before assuming the Monmouth presidency.

Founded on the eve of the American Civil War, the college immediately faced a crisis. The college&#x27;s campus was still under construction while virtually the entire male student body left for military service. Two hundred and thirty-two students, faculty members, and trustees served in the Civil War. A quarter of them were wounded and one in eight was killed. Two were awarded the Medal of Honor, and Abner C. Harding, a college trustee who raised a regiment composed largely of Monmouth College students, was commissioned a brigadier general for his leadership in the defense of Fort Donelson in 1863. President Wallace, believing that the college &quot;must educate, whether there be peace or war,&quot; kept classes in session for what was then a primarily female student body.

Monmouth was founded as a coeducational college where women and men had equal access to courses. When veterans returning to the college decided to form fraternities, a group of women was determined not to be outdone, and in 1867 established the first fraternity for women, known today as Pi Beta Phi. Three years later, another well-known women&#x27;s fraternity, Kappa Kappa Gamma, was founded at Monmouth.

Monmouth College had gained national stature by 1911 as shown by its US government classification where 59 colleges and universities ranked higher and 244 ranked lower (out of a total of 345 top colleges).

World War II posed a crisis to the institution similar to that of the Civil War, as male students began enlisting in the service within a month of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and soon only a handful remained on campus. Through an arrangement with the U.S. Navy Department, the college survived by becoming a U.S. Naval Flight Preparatory School, and later offered a V-5 Navy Academic Refresher Unit program for officers. Courses were taught by Monmouth&#x27;s liberal arts faculty. The Navy later adopted portions of Monmouth&#x27;s curriculum for training programs nationwide. More than 2,000 Navy men went through Monmouth College, a number of whom would re-enroll at the college after the war funded by the G.I. Bill.

Monmouth&#x27;s chemistry department gained national prominence in the 1950s when longtime professor William S. Haldeman was recognized with a major award by the American Chemical Society. The Steelman Report on Manpower for Research noted that Monmouth and four other small colleges—Hope, Juniata, St. Olaf and Oberlin—together had &quot;produced more candidates for the doctor&#x27;s degree in chemistry than Johns Hopkins, Fordham, Columbia, Tulane and Syracuse Universities combined.&quot;

Beginning in the 1960s, a secularization movement changed the nature of the college. Concurrent with dwindling financial support from the United Presbyterian Church, the college removed the Church Synod&#x27;s role in nominating and confirming trustees, thus allowing for the cultivation of new trustees with stronger business acumen and financial resources than those during the college&#x27;s earlier days. The college otherwise maintained its covenant relationship with the Presbyterian Church.

During the Vietnam War, the military draft (and the ability to avoid the draft by enrolling in college) contributed to increases in college attendance throughout the U.S. Attendance at the college increased but then fell when the draft ended in the 1970s causing financial strain not unlike the losing of students to the Civil War had done in the then distant past.

In 1983, a donation from an alumnus committed $5 million to the endowment and launched a $15 million capital campaign, the largest gift in college history to that point.

During the 1990s, enrollment began a steady increase that would see it more than double over the next two decades, from less than 600 in 1993 to 1,379 in 2009 and then decrease to 753 by 2021. The endowment grew from $23.6 million in 1993 to $87.2 million in 2013 to over $115 million in 2020; $75 million higher than the average for similar colleges. In 2021, the endowment stood at $146 million; $93.6 million more than average Baccalaureate colleges. Between 2002 and 2013, more than $120 million was invested in new construction and renovations to the campus.

==Affiliations==
Monmouth is a founding member of the Associated Colleges of the Midwest and a member of the Annapolis Group of independent liberal arts colleges. Monmouth also continues its relationship with the Presbyterian Church (USA), although courses in religion are no longer required, and is a member of the Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities, of which a Monmouth College president served as chair in 2011–2012. Chemistry at Monmouth is an approved baccalaureate program by the American Chemical Society.

==Academics and resources==
Monmouth College offers 40 major fields of study and 17 pre-professional fields of study (with 851 different courses offered) in the sciences, arts, humanities, mathematics, computer sciences, social sciences, foreign languages, classics, and interdisciplinary fields including premedical and pre-engineering studies, and provides an integrated core curriculum. This curriculum includes four signature courses designed to aid students in making connections across disciplines and understanding their education as an integrated whole. The curriculum allows freshman students to take advanced classes, and senior students to take introductory courses.

For freshmen, the only course requirement is one of the first-year seminar courses called Introduction to Liberal Arts which are limited to 16 to 18 students and shares a common focus on critical analysis and development of written and oral argument. The other 31 courses (usually four are taken per semester) required for graduation can be elected by the student.

Sixteen percent of Monmouth students in the class of 2013 were double majors. A small number of triple majors and interdisciplinary majors also exist. Within five years of graduation, more than 60 percent of Monmouth College alumni attend graduate school or another form of ongoing education.

A survey taken six months after the class of 2012 had graduated showed that 99% of Monmouth graduates were employed (or were in graduate school); the 2013 and 2014 surveys also showed 99%. As of 2023, 98% were employed.

===Admission===
Admissions to Monmouth are classified as &quot;selective&quot;. For the Class of 2017 (enrolled fall 2013), Monmouth received 2972 applications and accepted 1914 (64.4%). In 2022, the acceptance rate was 66%.

In 2023, 51% of students were female and 51% were male. Students come from 28 states and 21 countries. 27% were students of color and 1% were international students.

===Associated Colleges of the Midwest consortium===
Monmouth is a founding member of the fourteen-member Associated Colleges of the Midwest (ACM) consortium. The colleges share resources and develop and operate common off-campus academic programs. The members of the ACM include colleges in the middle west region of the United States and include Carleton College and Grinnell College among others.

===Study abroad and off-campus===
Over seventy off-campus programs are available in over fifty countries and run for as little as ten days or as long as a year but generally last one semester. Programs provided through the Associated Colleges of the Midwest consortium take place usually for one semester at over a dozen locales around the globe and include cultural, scientific, economic, historical and other forms of study and research. These programs include scientific research at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, government interning in Washington, D.C., and cultural activities in Florence, Italy. Monmouth College faculty frequently teach in these programs along with other members of the consortium including Carleton College, Grinnell College, and eleven other colleges. Other programs run exclusively by Monmouth College include a program in Scotland.

In 2012, four Monmouth College students studied at the Fulbright International Summer Institute in Bulgaria, accompanied by a Monmouth College Associate Dean who taught at the institute.

===Fellowships and internships===
Hundreds of internships are arranged annually for students through the Wackerle Career and Leadership Center. These include public service work around the United States. Students have also interned, beginning as early as the first year, at such businesses as Caterpillar Inc., Deere &amp; Co., Monsanto, law offices, and medical offices. Summer internships are also available in such offices as Admission, Financial Aid, Student Life, Hewes Library, Marketing communication, and fundraising.

Summer research opportunities exist for students and also incoming freshmen and transfers in the sciences and other areas of study. This research is conducted with professors and students working in groups and have included such topics as lightning research, archaeology and music. Included are a stipend and room and board expenses.

==Campus==
Among the resources on the campus are academic buildings, athletic fields and facilities, three wildlife sanctuaries for the study of ecology, and trails and other areas for hiking. Notable resources include the Shields Collection of antiquities, the largest privately held collection of Native American artifacts in the region, the only direct copy of the Canopus Stone outside of the Cairo Museum, an astronomical observatory, the Mellinger writing center, the Wackerle Career and Leadership center, and sporting facilities. The Kasch Performance Hall provides a traditional setting for musical performances with excellent acoustics and includes a refurbished three-manual pipe organ. The Wells Theater has been upgraded with high tech lighting and sound equipment. The &quot;black box&quot; experimental Fusion Theatre is located in downtown Monmouth and opened in 2013.

There are ten residence halls, an intercultural house, seven Greek houses, use.The campus has been expanded between 2000 and 2007 with three new residence halls, an apartment complex, an athletic complex, tennis complex, baseball, and soccer fields. It reopened the renovated Dahl Chapel and Auditorium containing a 600-seat English Chapel style recital hall/auditorium as well as music rehearsal space in 2003. In 2008, the April Zorn Memorial Stadium was completed, enlarging the seating capacity for football, lacrosse and track events to 2,600 and adding a new press box.

The largest building on campus is the Huff Athletic Center. It encompasses the college&#x27;s existing Glennie Gymnasium and includes a field house with indoor tennis courts and track, natatorium, fitness complex, wellness suite, locker and training rooms, classrooms and offices.

Opened in 2013 is the $42 million, Center for Science and Business, which houses the departments of accounting, biology, chemistry, economics, mathematics &amp; computer science, physics, psychology and political economy &amp; commerce. The facility introduces a cadaver lab, the Adolphson Observatory with research-grade 20-inch reflecting telescope, nuclear physics lab, two parallel computing facilities, a moot boardroom, tax preparation facilities, one-way observation labs, and an FDA-approved nutrition lab in addition to other laboratories.

The college maintains a digital television studio and media (computer) lab, a web-based radio station, digital classrooms, and three art galleries. The college also maintains the LeSuer Nature Preserve, a nature preserve, the Hamilton Research Pond, a prairie grass laboratory and a riparian property on the banks of the Mississippi river for the purposes of wetland biological research.

The Ivory Quinby House, built by a founder of Monmouth College, is now the home of the President of the college and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Students attend functions at the home, including dinners and discussion groups.

===Hewes Library===

With over a half-million items catalogued, the Hewes Library provides a large interlibrary loan capability and houses collections of antiquities, rare books, art, and archaeology. It also provides computer laboratories and tech support. A major remodeling in 2000 resulted in a modern open-stack facility.

===Sustainability===
Monmouth College has reduced its energy consumption and has increased its recycling contributions in recent years. These efforts include energy reduction through the installation of new heating boilers throughout campus, the use of energy-efficient lighting, low-flow water systems and the replacement of windows in nearly all older buildings. The Center for Science and Business includes energy efficient heating/cooling systems and heat recapture exhaust systems among other features. Recycling efforts extend into every student residence and office building. Some students have also committed themselves to sustainability of food production by opting to live in the college&#x27;s Garden theme housing which grows its own organic food and harvests its own honey using college facilities including seven acres set aside for such use. The college provides scholarships for students who have demonstrated leadership in sustainability prior to enrolling.

The college provides free access to bicycles for student use, and an electric vehicle recharging station is located on campus.

==Students&#x27; life==
Students represent about 28 states and about nine countries. Ninety-three percent of students live on campus in dormitories, theme houses, Greek housing, or apartment buildings. 

There are over 120 student groups funded by the student government or the college, including cultural, religious, publications, professional, honors, fine and performing arts, political advocacy, service groups, housing, and athletic organizations.

===Traditions===
The college&#x27;s Scottish heritage is reflected in its bagpipes and drums band that have won national titles.

The freshmen walkout is an autumn event that acquaints new students with the town.

Scholars&#x27; day held in conjunction with founders&#x27; day celebrates academic achievements with a variety of events. The college also cancels classes for a day and holds an honors convocation.

The college owns a restored civil war cannon (technically called an artillery rifle). It was once used to signal touchdowns the Fighting Scots made at homecoming football games.

===Safety===
The college is located in a residential neighborhood of Victorian homes, removing it from the safety concerns of many urban campuses. The college provides security patrols, an emergency broadcasting system and emergency text messaging system, plus extensive security lighting and the use of security cameras.

==Athletics==
Monmouth College is a member of the Midwest Conference and the NCAA Division III. The college offers eleven varsity sports for men and eleven for women. The college has won the Midwest Conference men&#x27;s all-sports trophy each of the last two years. The college also offers intramural sports.
The athletic teams&#x27; nickname, Fighting Scots, was coined in 1928 to reflect the Scotch-Irish heritage of the college&#x27;s founders. &quot;Fighting Scots&quot; is a registered trademark of Monmouth College.

The Monmouth College men&#x27;s track and field team placed third in the NCAA Division III Outdoor Track and Field Championships on May 26, 2007. It was the first national team trophy that a Monmouth College sports team has won. The following year, the men&#x27;s track and field team took second place in the NCAA Division III Indoor Track and Field Championships. Monmouth&#x27;s track program has produced nine individual national champions, the most recent of which was James Wilson, who won the NCAA Division III indoor long jump national title in 2013.

In 2014, the college&#x27;s sports teams and student-athletes won awards for academic achievement including national academic honors from seven different organizations. Volleyball and Men&#x27;s Golf earned team academic accolades from their respective national coaches&#x27; organizations for their high team GPA. Eleven team members also earned individual national honors for their academic excellence including one student who became Monmouth&#x27;s first winner of the NCAA&#x27;s Elite 89 Award, given to the student-athlete with the highest GPA participating in one of the NCAA&#x27;s 89 sponsored championships. Four softball players, three track student-athletes, two women&#x27;s golfers and a men&#x27;s tennis player also received national academic honors for the 2013–14 academic year.
Monmouth began its college football rivalry with Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois in 1888, making it the sixth-oldest college football rivalry in the country. The two schools play annually for the Bronze Turkey trophy in November (originally on Thanksgiving). ESPN&#x27;s Jeff Merron has classified the trophy as the fifth-most-unusual in college football. The Bronze Turkey has been stolen several times and was at one time buried under the old MC indoor track for five years. Monmouth leads the series with 71 wins, 50 losses and 10 ties.

The Monmouth College football team has appeared in the NCAA Division III Playoffs in 2005, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2020.

<text>The European Ombudsman is an inter-institutional body of the European Union that holds the institutions, bodies and agencies of the EU to account, and promotes good administration. The Ombudsman helps people, businesses and organisations facing problems with the EU administration by investigating complaints, as well as by proactively looking into broader systemic issues. The current Ombudsman is Teresa Anjinho.

The European Ombudsman has offices in Strasbourg and Brussels.

==History==
The European Ombudsman was established by the Maastricht Treaty and the first, Jacob Söderman of Finland, was elected by Parliament in 1995. The current Ombudsman, Teresa Anjinho of Portugal, took office on 27 February 2025.

==Appointment==
The European Ombudsman is elected by the European Parliament. The Ombudsman is elected for the term of 5 years and the term is renewable. At the request of Parliament, the Ombudsman may be removed by the Court of Justice if &quot;(s)he no longer fulfils the conditions required for the performance of his duties or if (s)he is guilty of serious misconduct&quot;. ()

==Remit and powers==
Any EU citizen or entity may appeal the Ombudsman to investigate an EU institution on the grounds of maladministration: administrative irregularities, unfairness, discrimination, abuse of power, failure to reply, refusal of information or unnecessary delay. The Ombudsman cannot investigate the European Court of Justice in its judicial capacity, the General Court, the Civil Service Tribunal, national and regional administrations (even where EU law is concerned), judiciaries, private individuals or corporations.

The Ombudsman has no binding powers to compel compliance with their rulings, but the overall level of compliance is high. The Ombudsman primarily relies on the power of persuasion and publicity. In 2011, the overall rate of compliance by the EU institutions with their suggestions was 82%. The EU Agencies had a compliance rate of 100%. The compliance rate of the European Commission was the same as the overall figure of 82%, while the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO) scored 69%.

==Cases==
It is a right of an EU citizen, according to the EU treaties, to take a case to the Ombudsman. One example of a case dealt with by the Ombudsman involved a late payment from the commission to a German science journalist. The Commission explained the delay, paid interest and accelerated future payments to experts. On another occasion, following a complaint from a Hungarian, EPSO agreed to clarify information in recruitment competition notices concerning eligibility and pre-selection tests. A third case was resolved when the Ombudsman compelled the council to release to the public documents it had previously not acknowledged the existence of.

The ombudsman received 2,667 complaints in the year 2010 and opened 335 investigations into alleged maladministration. In 2011 2,510 complaints were received and 396 investigations were opened. The largest number of complaints in 2011 came from Spain (361), followed by Germany with 308. Relative to population, however, the greatest proportion of complaints came from Luxembourg and Cyprus. The United Kingdom, despite its eurosceptic reputation, was in 2009 responsible for the smallest number of cases lodged. In 2011 the UK was responsible for 141 complaints to the Ombudsman, still representing a relatively low ratio of complaints to population.

According to the Ombudsman&#x27;s own reports, 58% of complaints in 2011 were related to the European Commission. 11% related to the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO) from dissatisfied applicants to the European Civil Service and 4% to the European Parliament. The Council of the European Union accounted for 3%.

== Main subjects of action ==
The main mission guiding the European Ombudsman&#x27;s work is the &quot;right to good administration&quot; that is recognized as a human right in the EU. The European Ombudsman helps citizens, companies and associations that face problems with EU administration. The main areas of inquiries of European Ombudsman relate to the transparency of EU institutions administration; transparency and accountability in EU decision-making; lobbying transparency; ethical issues; fundamental rights; EU competitions policy; and citizen participation in EU decision-making.

=== Transparency in the right of accessing EU documents ===
Complaints concerning lack of transparency are the most common category of complaints received by the European Ombudsman, representing between 20% and 30% of complaints. They are mainly related to the refusal of EU institution(s) to grant documents upon a citizen&#x27;s request. This right of citizens to access EU documents is granted by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. In case a citizen is prevented from accessing such requested documents, he or she can turn with a complaint to the European Ombudsman to try to achieve a resolution. For instance, in case 693/2011/RA, following European Medicines Agency (EMA)&#x27;s refusal to grant public access to clinical studies carried out on a multiple sclerosis drug, the Ombudsman made a friendly solution proposal on it with some detailed suggestions for the particular case, trying to achieve the transparency the complainant was requesting. EMA positively received this and fully accepted the friendly solution proposal by European Ombudsman.

=== Lobbying transparency ===
European Ombudsman works to ensure that the EU&#x27;s democratic decision-making process is characterized by the highest transparency standards. For that, special attention is given to interest groups and their engagement and influence in EU institutions. Lobbying transparency is one of the main topics of action of the European Ombudsman, through various strategic initiatives, trying to mitigate potential conflicts of interest. The European Ombudsman was involved in the Transparency Register, which has enabled citizens to know who is trying to influence EU decision-makers. For instance, in 2014, the European Ombudsman published, after a formal inquiry, a final decision stating that the &quot;Commission&#x27;s refusal to publish online details of all meetings which its services and its staff have with the tobacco industry&quot; constituted maladministration.

=== Ethical issues ===
Ethic issues related complaints to European Ombudsman can go from conflicts of interest to &quot;revolving doors&quot; situations, where someone working in the private sector moves to closely links jobs in the public jobs or vice versa. The European Ombudsman has defended that EU administration must comply with &quot;gold standards when it comes to ethical behaviour&quot;.

For instance, one inquiry, concluded in 2020, investigated corporate sponsorship of the Presidency of the Council of the EU. Started from a complaint NGO who raised the concern of the Romanian EU Presidency receiving sponsorship by a major soft drinks company in the context of the Presidency. The Ombudsman considered that &quot;as the Presidency is part of the Council, its activities are likely to be perceived by the wider European public as being linked to the Council of the EU as a whole&quot; and might entail &quot;reputational risks&quot;. The Council ended up agreeing to the European Ombudsman consideration and drew guidance for Member States indicating that they would no longer accept sponsorship in the context of their presidencies.

=== Fundamental rights ===
A key part of European Ombudsman work is to ensure that EU institutions respect fundamental rights. For example, in 2015 the European Ombudsman conducted an investigation, in collaboration with 19 members of the European Network of Ombudsmen, into the compliance of fundamental rights by Frontex when forcing migrants to return to their home countries. It concluded that there was significant &quot;room for improvement&quot; as to how it was handling joint returns of illegal migrants and, in that scope, made detailed recommendations as to how Frontex could improve. Frontex responded positively to many of these recommendations.

=== Citizen participation ===
In its role as moderator and bridge between citizens and the EU institutions, the European Ombudsman also promotes citizens&#x27; participation and involvement in European politics, by, for example, demanding greater transparency so that citizens can follow the proceedings, or by promoting on his own initiative the implementation of more participatory decision-making processes. A large number of the complaints that the European Ombudsman receives in this context are related to problems in the functioning of the European Commission&#x27;s public consultations, and the European Citizens&#x27; Initiative (ECI). In 2014, the European Ombudsman invited ECI organizers (such as civil society, organisations and interested bodies) to give feedback on the ECI.

== European Ombudsman&#x27;s procedures ==
The European Ombudsman, on one hand, a formal parliamentary body at a supranational level, &quot;designed to strengthen the supervision and control of European Institutions and Administrations&quot; and, on top of that, it works with a specific European concept of maladministration. The powers of the European Ombudsman, albeit limited, provide them the &quot;opportunity to combine the instruments of parliamentary scrutiny and judicial control in an original way&quot;

European Ombudsman can conduct inquiries following a complaint received and conduct inquiries on its own initiative. As methods of action, it can require the institution concerned for information, it can inspect the institution&#x27;s files and it can take testimonies from officials.

The European Ombudsman complements the work of the courts, as it offers an alternative way for citizens to resolve disputes with the EU administration, without incurring in costs such as lawyers or fees. However, the European Ombudsman has no power to make legally binding decisions, so it can only act as a moderator in the dispute.

Using the powers conferred by the Statute of the European Ombudsman, the European Ombudsman can require any institution whose maladministration is in question &quot;to provide some information, inspect its files and take testimony from its staff members&quot; and it can propose solutions for the case.

Whenever it finds a situation of maladministration, the European Ombudsman can make proposals through problem-solving proposals, recommendations and suggestions. The main way in which the European Ombudsman tries to resolve the case is by proposing a solution, that is, a solution that both the complainant and the institution concerned would be willing to accept. This method may result in a quick constructive and good outcome for the complainant. However, this method is far from being effective to provoke systemic change in the public interest. If the institution rejects the proposed friendly solution, then the European Ombudsman can proceed to the powers of Article 4 of the Statute and draft recommendations for the institution concerned. Such recommendations are published in the Ombudsman&#x27;s website, creating therefore some publicity and raising public attention to the maladministration identified. If no resolution is found neither from the proposed friendly solution, nor from the recommendation, then the European Ombudsman can publish suggestions for improvements, directed to the institution, to address the issue. These public suggestions can publicly identify systemic maladministration problems and suggest corrections that can cause systemic improvements for the public interest.  If, at the end of an investigation, an institution rejects its final findings or recommendations, the Ombudsman can criticize it publicly, raising importance on the issue, and can make a special report to the European Parliament.

Many of the complaints sent to the European Ombudsman are outside its mandate. In 2020, the European Ombudsman processed 1,400 complaints outside its scope of competence. This number of out-of-scope complaints came mainly from Spain, Poland and Germany. This counts to justify the significant difference in percentage of opened inquiries compared to the number of complaints submitted.

In any case, the European Ombudsman tries to reply to all complaints submitted, even the ones outside the mandate. In those cases, European Ombudsman helps complainants by explaining the Ombudsman&#x27;s mandate, advising other bodies where to direct their complaint. If the complainant agrees, the European Ombudsman can also forward the complaint to members of the European Network of Ombudsmen (ENO).

The institution receiving the greatest number of inquiries conducted by the European Ombudsman has been throughout the years the European Commission. In 2020 for example, 210 inquiries opened concerned the European Commission, compared to 30 concerning the European Personnel Selection Office, 14 the European External Action Service, 12 the European Anti-Fraud Office, 11 the European Parliament, 9 the European Central Bank, 9 the European Investment Bank, 34 for EU agencies and 41 to all other organisms.

The major grand topic inquiries made by European Ombudsman in 2020 were: the functioning of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency&#x27;s (Frontex) &#x27;Complaints Mechanism&#x27; to deal with complaints related to fundamental rights; the transparency of the Council of the EU during the COVID-19 crisis; and the collection and processing of information by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control during the COVID-19 crisis.

== Advice, complaints, and inquiries throughout the years ==
The high number of maladministration complaints made to European Ombudsman in parallel with the literature support, shows that &quot;the ombudsman is an important platform protecting the rights of citizens and promoting democratic values at the EU level&quot;.

== Effectiveness, impact, and achievements ==
The European Ombudsman has, since its appearance in 1995, profiled itself as an institution with the &quot;good governance&quot; mission, promoting this cause and its own place within the EU institutional system. It is active towards serving the wider public interest and one of its goals is to achieve &quot;tangible improvements for complainants and the public &quot;vis-a-vis&quot; the EU administration&quot; On one hand, European Ombudsman is responsive towards complaints from individuals, companies and associations, replying to and resolving complaints related to administration problems in the EU institutions. On the other hand, the European Ombudsman also takes an autonomous and active approach in &quot;helping the institutions to improve the quality of the service they provide&quot; by making proposals through problem-solving &quot;proposals,&quot; &quot;recommendations,&quot; and &quot;suggestions&quot;.

Accessing the European Ombudsman&#x27;s effectiveness implies having into consideration quantitative data, such as the statistics of the responsiveness to complaints and statistics on own-initiative inquiries, but also qualitative data in order to try to better understand all kinds of achievements when contacting the institutions (that is, how EU institutions react to the European Ombudsman&#x27;s proposals).

For this purpose, complying with Article 4(5) of the Statute, the European Ombudsman submits a comprehensive report to the European Parliament at the end of each annual session, with information on the rate of EU institutions&#x27; compliance with recommendations made by the European Ombudsman.

One of the goals of the European Ombudsman is to achieve improvements in the EU administration and, according to its way of working, statistics can partially measure their results, in terms of how the institutions responded to the Ombudsman&#x27;s proposals.

=== European Ombudsman&#x27;s responsiveness to complaints ===
Data from the 2020 Annual Report shows how responsive the European Ombudsman was in 2020 towards the complaints received by individuals, companies, and associations, including the complaints that were outside its mandate scope (which were more than 1400 in 2020). In 2020, 849 complainants (39.5% of all complaints dealt with during 2020) received advice or found their case transferred to another complaints body. Other 934, (representing 43,5%) received a response informing the complaint that all advice from European Ombudsman had already been provided. Finally, 365 complaints (17% of all complaints dealt with that year) resulted in the opening of formal inquiries for further analyses.

=== Cooperation and acceptance by EU institutions ===
European Ombudsman reports that in 2019, &quot;the EU institutions responded positively to the Ombudsman&#x27;s proposals (solutions, recommendations, and suggestions) in 79% of instances&quot;. Out of 119 proposals from the Ombudsman related to corrections the EU institutions should do to improve their administrative practices, 95 were positively received and had an influence on the correction of the maladministration situations detected. In 2020, 10 out of the 17 institutions to which the Ombudsman made proposals, fully complied with all solutions, suggestions, and recommendations.

=== Some examples of influence ===
- Case 2168/2019/KR: &quot;Revolving doors&quot;. European Ombudsman opened an inquiry after the ex-executive director of the European Banking Authority moved to the position of CEO of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe. The European Ombudsman concluded that the EBA should have forbidden such move of job, given the high risks of conflict of interests. Therefore, a recommendation was made that, in the future, the EBA should forbid, with clear criteria, senior staff members moving to certain positions after their term of office and access to confidential information would stop once it was known that a member of staff was taking up another job. The EBA agreed to implement the Ombudsman&#x27;s recommendations.

- Case 860/2018/THH: positive cooperation following European Food Safety Authority&#x27;s refusal to grant public access to declarations of interest of middle management staff. The EFSA ended up following the Ombudsman&#x27;s request to make those declarations public and has a more transparent policy in this area.

- Case 357/2019/FP: positive cooperation following the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)&#x27;s refusal to grant public access to documents relating to contacts with stakeholders. The European Ombudsman opened an inquiry following a complaint and verified that some internal notes of meetings should have been disclosed. In the context of cooperation with the European Ombudsman, the ESMA disclosed to the complainant parts of eight documents.

- Joint cases 488/2018/KR and 514/2018/KR: positive cooperation in the context of an inquiry regarding the appointment of the commission&#x27;s Secretary-General (its highest civil servant). The Commission improved the appointment procedure as it had been suggested by the European Ombudsman, indicating a vacancy notice and a well-defined timeline in the procedure.

=== Conclusion ===
While the discourse on fundamental rights is relevant to the European Ombudsman, its profile and, to some extent, its mandate leave the conceptual field of human rights outside of its scope capacity to act. The mission and performance of the European Ombudsman is positively seen by the EU institutions, shown by the rates of positive cooperation and compliance with the European Ombudsman&#x27;s recommendations. Most scholars note that the European Ombudsman has been effective in promoting good governance in the EU. However, a few authors note that it has had less impact in the field of fundamental rights, subject EU citizens most complain about.

<text>Jodrell Bank Observatory ( ) in Cheshire, England hosts a number of radio telescopes as part of the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Manchester. The observatory was established in 1945 by Bernard Lovell, a radio astronomer at the university, to investigate cosmic rays after his work on radar in the Second World War. It has since played an important role in the research of meteoroids, quasars, pulsars, masers, and gravitational lenses, and was heavily involved with the tracking of space probes at the start of the Space Age.

The main telescope at the observatory is the Lovell Telescope. Its diameter of makes it the third largest steerable radio telescope in the world. There are three other active telescopes at the observatory; the Mark II and and 7 m diameter radio telescopes. Jodrell Bank Observatory is the base of the Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN), a National Facility run by the University of Manchester on behalf of the Science and Technology Facilities Council.

The Jodrell Bank Visitor Centre and an arboretum are in Lower Withington, and the Lovell Telescope and the observatory near Goostrey and Holmes Chapel. The observatory is reached from the A535. The Crewe to Manchester Line passes by the site, and Goostrey station is a short distance away. In 2019, the observatory became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

== Early years ==
Jodrell Bank was first used for academic purposes in 1939 when the University of Manchester&#x27;s Department of Botany purchased three fields from the Leighs. It is named from a nearby rise in the ground, Jodrell Bank, which was named after William Jauderell, an archer whose descendants lived at the mansion that is now Terra Nova School. The site was extended in 1952 by the purchase of a farm from George Massey on which the Lovell Telescope was built.

The site was first used for astrophysics in 1945, when Bernard Lovell used some equipment left over from World War II, including a gun laying radar, to investigate cosmic rays. The equipment was a GL II radar system working at a wavelength of 4.2 m, provided by J. S. Hey. He intended to use the equipment in Manchester, but electrical interference from the trams on Oxford Road prevented him from doing so. He moved the equipment to Jodrell Bank, south of the city, on 10 December 1945. Lovell&#x27;s main research was transient radio echoes, which he confirmed were from ionized meteor trails by October 1946. The first staff were Alf Dean and Frank Foden, who observed meteors with the naked eye while Lovell observed the electromagnetic signal using equipment. The first time Lovell turned the radar on – 14 December 1945 – the Geminids meteor shower was at a maximum.

Over the next few years, Lovell accumulated more ex-military radio hardware, including a portable cabin. The first permanent building was near to the cabin and was named after it.

== Searchlight telescope ==
A searchlight was loaned to Jodrell Bank in 1946 by the army; a broadside array, was constructed on its mount by J. Clegg. It consisted of 7 elements of Yagi–Uda antennas. It was used for astronomical observations in October 1946.

On 9 and 10 October 1946, the telescope observed ionisation in the atmosphere caused by meteors in the Giacobinids meteor shower. When the antenna was turned by 90 degrees at the maximum of the shower, the number of detections dropped to the background level, proving that the transient signals detected by radar were from meteors. The telescope was then used to determine the radiant points for meteors. This was possible as the echo rate is at a minimum at the radiant point, and a maximum at 90 degrees to it. The telescope and other receivers on the site studied the auroral streamers that were visible in early August 1947.

== Transit Telescope ==

The Transit Telescope was a parabolic reflector zenith telescope built in 1947. At the time, it was the world&#x27;s largest radio telescope. It consisted of a wire mesh suspended from a ring of scaffold poles, which focussed radio signals on a focal point above the ground. The telescope mainly looked directly upwards, but the direction of the beam could be changed by small amounts by tilting the mast to change the position of the focal point. The focal mast was changed from timber to steel before construction was complete.

The telescope was replaced by the steerable Lovell Telescope, and the Mark II telescope was subsequently built at the same location.

The telescope could map a ± 15-degree strip around the zenith at 72 and 160 MHz, with a resolution at 160 MHz of 1 degree. It discovered radio noise from the Great Nebula in Andromeda – the first definite detection of an extragalactic radio source – and the remnants of Tycho&#x27;s Supernova in the radio frequency; at the time it had not been discovered by optical astronomy.

== Lovell Telescope ==

The &quot;Mark I&quot; telescope, now known as the Lovell Telescope, was the world&#x27;s largest steerable dish radio telescope, in diameter, when it was constructed in 1957; it is now the third largest, after the Green Bank telescope in West Virginia and the Effelsberg telescope in Germany. Part of the gun turret mechanisms from the First World War battleships and were reused in the telescope&#x27;s motor system. The telescope became operational in mid-1957, in time for the launch of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Sputnik 1, the world&#x27;s first artificial satellite. The telescope was the only one able to track Sputnik&#x27;s booster rocket by radar; first locating it just before midnight on 12 October 1957, eight days after its launch.

In the following years, the telescope tracked various space probes. Between 11 March and 12 June 1960, it tracked the United States&#x27; NASA-launched Pioneer 5 probe. The telescope sent commands to the probe, including those to separate it from its carrier rocket and turn on its more powerful transmitter when the probe was eight million miles away. It received data from the probe, the only telescope in the world capable of doing so. In February 1966, Jodrell Bank was asked by the Soviet Union to track its unmanned Moon lander Luna 9 and recorded on its facsimile transmission of photographs from the Moon&#x27;s surface. The photographs were sent to the British press and published before the Soviets made them public.

In 1969, the Soviet Union&#x27;s Luna 15 was also tracked. A recording of the moment when Jodrell Bank&#x27;s scientists observed the mission was released on 3 July 2009.

With the support of Sir Bernard Lovell, the telescope tracked Russian satellites. Satellite and space probe observations were shared with the US Department of Defense satellite tracking research and development activity at Project Space Track.

Tracking space probes only took a fraction of the Lovell telescope&#x27;s observing time, and the remainder was used for scientific observations including using radar to measure the distance to the Moon and to Venus; observations of astrophysical masers around star-forming regions and giant stars; observations of pulsars (including the discovery of millisecond pulsars and the first pulsar in a globular cluster); and observations of quasars and gravitational lenses (including the detection of the first gravitational lens and the first Einstein ring). The telescope has also been used for SETI observations.

== Mark II and III telescopes ==
The Mark II telescope is an elliptical radio telescope, with a major axis of and a minor axis of . It was constructed in 1964. As well as operating as a standalone telescope, it has been used as an interferometer with the Lovell Telescope, and is now primarily used as part of the MERLIN project.
The Mark III telescope, the same size as the Mark II, was constructed to be transportable but it was never moved from Wardle, near Nantwich, where it was used as part of MERLIN. It was built in 1966 and decommissioned in 1996.

== Mark IV, V and VA telescope proposals ==

The Mark IV, V and VA telescope proposals were put forward in the 1960s through to the 1980s to build even larger radio telescopes.

The Mark IV proposal was for a diameter standalone telescope, built as a national project.

The Mark V proposal was for a moveable telescope. The concept of this proposal was for a telescope on a railway line adjoining Jodrell Bank, but concerns about future levels of interference meant that a site in Wales would have been preferable. Design proposals by Husband and Co and Freeman Fox, who had designed the Parkes Observatory telescope in Australia, were put forward.

The Mark VA was similar to the Mark V but with a smaller dish of and a design using prestressed concrete, similar to the Mark II (the previous two designs more closely resembled the Lovell telescope).

None of the proposed telescopes was constructed, although design studies were carried out and scale models were made, partly because of the changing political climate, and partly due to the financial constraints of astronomical research in the UK. Also it became necessary to upgrade the Lovell Telescope to the Mark IA, which overran in terms of cost.

== Other single dishes ==
A 50 ft (15 m) alt-azimuth dish was constructed in 1964 for astronomical research and to track the Zond 1, Zond 2, Ranger 6 and Ranger 7 space probes and Apollo 11. After an accident that irreparably damaged the 50 ft telescope&#x27;s surface, it was demolished in 1982 and replaced with a more accurate telescope, the &quot;42 ft&quot;. The 42 ft (12.8 m) dish is mainly used to observe pulsars, and continually monitors the Crab Pulsar.

When the 42 ft was installed, a smaller dish, the &quot;7 m&quot; (actually 6.4 m, or 21 ft, in diameter) was installed and is used for undergraduate teaching. The 42 ft and 7 m telescopes were originally used at the Woomera Rocket Testing Range in South Australia. The 7 m was originally constructed in 1970 by the Marconi Company.

A Polar Axis telescope was built in 1962. It had a circular 50 ft (15.2 m) dish on a polar mount, and was mostly used for moon radar experiments. It has been decommissioned. An reflecting optical telescope was donated to the observatory in 1951 but was not used much, and was donated to the Salford Astronomical Society around 1971.

== MERLIN ==

The Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN) is an array of radio telescopes spread across England and the Welsh borders. The array is run from Jodrell Bank on behalf of the Science and Technology Facilities Council as a National Facility. The array consists of up to seven radio telescopes and includes the Lovell Telescope, the Mark II, Cambridge, Defford, Knockin, Darnhall, and Pickmere (previously known as Tabley). The longest baseline is and MERLIN can operate at frequencies between 151 MHz and 24 GHz. At a wavelength of 6 cm (5 GHz frequency), MERLIN has a resolution of 50 milliarcseconds which is comparable to that of the HST at optical wavelengths.

== Very Long Baseline Interferometry ==

Jodrell Bank has been involved with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) since the late 1960s; the Lovell telescope took part in the first transatlantic interferometer experiment in 1968, with other telescopes at Algonquin and Penticton in Canada. The Lovell Telescope and the Mark II telescopes are regularly used for VLBI with telescopes across Europe (the European VLBI Network), giving a resolution of around 0.001 arcseconds.

== Square Kilometre Array ==
In April 2011, Jodrell Bank was named as the location of the control centre for the planned Square Kilometre Array, or SKA Project Office (SPO). The SKA is planned by a collaboration of 20 countries and when completed, is intended to be the most powerful radio telescope ever built. In April 2015 it was announced that Jodrell Bank would be the permanent home of the SKA headquarters for the period of operation expected for the telescope (over 50 years).

== Research ==
The Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, of which the Observatory is a part, is one of the largest astrophysics research groups in the UK. About half of the research of the group is in the area of radio astronomy – including research into pulsars, the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, gravitational lenses, active galaxies and astrophysical masers. The group also carries out research at different wavelengths, looking into star formation and evolution, planetary nebula and astrochemistry.

The first director of Jodrell Bank was Bernard Lovell, who established the observatory in 1945. He was succeeded in 1980 by Sir Francis Graham-Smith, followed by Professor Rod Davies around 1990 and Professor Andrew Lyne in 1999. Professor Phil Diamond took over the role on 1 October 2006, at the time when the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics was formed. Prof Ralph Spencer was Acting Director during 2009 and 2010. In October 2010, Prof. Albert Zijlstra became Director of the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics. Professor Lucio Piccirillo was the Director of the Observatory from Oct 2010 to Oct 2011. Prof. Simon Garrington is the JBCA Associate Director for the Jodrell Bank Observatory. In 2016, Prof. Michael Garrett was appointed as the inaugural Sir Bernard Lovell chair of Astrophysics and Director of Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics. As Director JBCA, Prof. Garrett also has overall responsibility for Jodrell Bank Observatory.

In May 2017 Jodrell Bank entered into a partnership with the Breakthrough Listen initiative and will share information with Jodrell Bank&#x27;s team, who wish to conduct an independent SETI search via its 76-m radio telescope and e-MERLIN array.

There is an active development programme researching and constructing telescope receivers and instrumentation. The observatory has been involved in the construction of several Cosmic Microwave Background experiments, including the Tenerife Experiment, which ran from the 1980s to 2000, and the amplifiers and cryostats for the Very Small Array. It has also constructed the front-end modules of the 30 and 44 GHz receivers for the Planck spacecraft. Receivers were also designed at Jodrell Bank for the Parkes Telescope in Australia.

==Visitor facilities, and events==

A visitors&#x27; centre, opened on 19 April 1971 by the Duke of Devonshire, attracted around 120,000 visitors per year. It covered the history of Jodrell Bank and had a planetarium and 3D theatre hosting simulated trips to Mars.
Asbestos in the visitors&#x27; centre buildings led to its demolition in 2003 leaving a remnant of its far end. A marquee was set up in its grounds while a new science centre was planned. The plans were shelved when Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST merged to become the University of Manchester in 2004, leaving the interim centre, which received around 70,000 visitors a year.
In October 2010, work on a new visitor centre started and the Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre opened on 11 April 2011. It includes an entrance building, the Planet Pavilion, a Space Pavilion for exhibitions and events, a glass-walled cafe with a view of the Lovell Telescope and an outdoor dining area, an education space, and landscaped gardens including the Galaxy Maze. A large orrery was installed in 2013. It does not, however, include a planetarium, though a small inflatable planetarium dome has been in use on the site in recent years.

The visitor centre is open Tuesday to Sunday and Mondays during school and bank holidays and organises public outreach events, including public lectures, star parties, and &quot;ask an astronomer&quot; sessions.

A path around the Lovell telescope is approximately 20 m from the telescope&#x27;s outer railway, information boards explain how the telescope works and the research that is done with it.

The arboretum, created in 1972, houses the UK&#x27;s national collections of crab apple &quot;Malus&quot; and mountain ash &quot;Sorbus&quot; species, and the Heather Society&#x27;s &quot;Calluna&quot; collection. The arboretum also has a small scale model of the Solar System, the scale is approximately 1:5,000,000,000. At Jodrell Bank, as part of the &quot;SpacedOut&quot; project, is the Sun in a 1:15,000,000 scale model of the Solar System covering Britain.

On 7 July 2010, it was announced that the observatory was being considered for the 2011 United Kingdom Tentative List for World Heritage Site status. It was announced on 22 March 2011 that it was on the UK government&#x27;s shortlist. In January 2018, it became the UK&#x27;s candidate for World Heritage status.

In July 2011 the visitor centre and observatory hosted &quot;Live from Jodrell Bank - Transmission 001&quot; – a rock concert with bands including The Flaming Lips, British Sea Power, Wave Machines, OK GO and Alice Gold. On 23 July 2012, Elbow performed live at the observatory and filmed a documentary of the event and the facility which was released as a live CD/DVD of the concert.
On 6 July 2013, Transmission 4 featured Australian Pink Floyd, Hawkwind, The Time &amp; Space Machine and The Lucid Dream. On 7 July 2013, Transmission 5 featured New Order, Johnny Marr, The Whip, Public Service Broadcasting, Jake Evans and Hot Vestry. On 30 August 2013, Transmission 6 featured Sigur Ros, Polca and Daughter.

On 31 August 2013, Jodrell Bank hosted a concert performed by the Hallé Orchestra to commemorate what would have been Lovell&#x27;s 100th birthday. As well as a number of operatic performances during the day, the evening Halle performance saw numbers such as themes from &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; among others. The main Lovell telescope was rotated to face the onlooking crowd and used as a huge projection screen showing various animated planetary effects. During the interval the &#x27;screen&#x27; was used to show a history of Lovell&#x27;s work and Jodrell Bank.

There is an astronomy podcast from the observatory, named &quot;The Jodcast&quot;. The BBC television programme &quot;Stargazing Live&quot; was hosted in the control room of the observatory from 2011 to 2016.

Since 2016, the observatory hosted Bluedot, a music and science festival, featuring musical acts such as Public Service Broadcasting, The Chemical Brothers, as well as talks by scientists and scientific communicators such as Jim Al-Khalili and Richard Dawkins.

== Threat of closure ==
On 3 March 2008, it was reported that Britain&#x27;s Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), faced with an £80 million shortfall in its budget, was considering withdrawing its planned £2.7 million annual funding of Jodrell Bank&#x27;s e-MERLIN project. The project, which aimed to replace the microwave links between Jodrell Bank and a number of other radio telescopes with high-bandwidth fibre-optic cables, greatly increasing the sensitivity of observations, was seen as critical to the survival of the facility. Bernard Lovell said &quot;It will be a disaster … The fate of the Jodrell Bank telescope is bound up with the fate of e-MERLIN. I don&#x27;t think the establishment can survive if the e-MERLIN funding is cut&quot;.

On 9 July 2008, it was reported that, following an independent review, STFC had reversed its initial position and would now guarantee funding of £2.5 million annually for three years.

== Fictional references ==
Jodrell Bank has been mentioned in several works of fiction, including &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (&quot;The Tenth Planet&quot;, &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot;, &quot;The Poison Sky&quot;, &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, &quot;Spyfall&quot;) and &quot;Birthday Boy&quot; by David Baddiel. It was intended to be a filming location for &quot;Logopolis&quot; (Tom Baker&#x27;s final &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial) but budget restrictions prevented this and another location with a superimposed model of a radio telescope was used instead. It was also mentioned in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; (as well as &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; film), &quot;The Creeping Terror&quot; and &quot;Meteor&quot;.

Jodrell Bank was also featured heavily in the 1983 music video &quot;Secret Messages&quot; by Electric Light Orchestra and also &quot;Are We Ourselves?&quot; by The Fixx. The Prefab Sprout song Technique (from debut album Swoon) opens with the line &quot;Her husband works at Jodrell Bank/He&#x27;s home late in the morning&quot;.

The observatory is the site of several episodes in the novel &quot;Boneland&quot; by the local novelist Alan Garner (2012), and the central character, Colin Whisterfield, is an astrophysicist on its staff.

Jodrell bank made an appearance in the CBBC series &quot;Bitsa&quot;.

==Appraisal==
Since 13 July 1988 the Lovell Telescope has been designated as a Grade I listed building. On 10 July 2017 the Mark II Telescope was also designated at the same grade. On the same date five other buildings on the site were designated at Grade II; namely the Searchlight Telescope, the Control Building, the Park Royal Building, the Electrical Workshop, and the Link Hut. Grade I is the highest of the three grades of listing, and is applied to buildings that are of &quot;exceptional interest&quot;, and Grade II, the lowest grade, is applied to buildings &quot;of special interest&quot;.

At the 43rd Session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee in Baku on 7 July 2019, the Jodrell Bank Observatory was adopted as a World Heritage Site on the basis of 4 criteria
* Criterion (i): Jodrell Bank Observatory is a masterpiece of human creative genius related to its scientific and technical achievements. 
* Criterion (ii): Jodrell Bank Observatory represents an important interchange of human values over a span of time and on a global scale on developments 
* Criterion (iv): Jodrell Bank Observatory represents an outstanding example of a technological ensemble which illustrates a significant stage in human history
* Criterion (vi): Jodrell Bank Observatory is directly and tangibly associated with events and ideas of outstanding universal significance.

<text>Sidney Gillman (October 26, 1911 – January 3, 2003) was an American football player, coach and executive. Gillman&#x27;s insistence on stretching the football field by throwing deep downfield passes, instead of short passes to running backs or wide receivers at the sides of the line of scrimmage, was instrumental in making football into the modern game that it is today. He was inducted as a coach into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1983, and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1989.

Gillman played football as an end at Ohio State University from 1931 to 1933. He played professionally for one season in 1936 with the Cleveland Rams of the second American Football League. After serving as an assistant coach at Ohio State from 1938 to 1940, Gillman was the head football coach at Miami University from 1944 to 1947 and at the University of Cincinnati from 1949 to 1954, compiling a career college football record of 81–19–2. He then moved to the ranks of professional football, where he headed the NFL&#x27;s Los Angeles Rams (1955–1959), the American Football League&#x27;s Los Angeles and San Diego Chargers (1960–1969), and the NFL&#x27;s Houston Oilers (1973–1974), amassing a career record of 123–104–7 in the National Football League and the American Football League. Gillman&#x27;s 1963 San Diego Chargers won the AFL Championship.

==Early life and college==
Sidney Gillman was born on October 26, 1911, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to a Jewish family. His father was an Austrian immigrant who was in the movie theater business. He attended North High School, and was elected captain of his high school football team in his senior year, and played on a state all-star team.

He played college football at Ohio State University under coach Sam Willaman, forming the basis of his offense. Gillman was not impressed by Willaman&#x27;s coaching ability. Gillman was an All-American at end in 1932 and 1933. He was a team co-captain on the 1933 team, and All-Big Ten Conference end in 1933. Gillman played in the first Chicago All-Star Game (1934) with the college all-stars playing against the NFL champion Chicago Bears, where he was flattened by Bears legend Bronko Nagurski. 

While attending Ohio State, Gillman was a brother of the Nu chapter of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity, living in the fraternity house for three years at college. He played piano in small bands during his college years to make extra money (including one called the Red Hot Peppers). He was a political science major.
==Career==
Gillman&#x27;s innovations in passing offense are often praised as the foundation of modern football, but &quot;Perhaps his most lasting legacy was his use of film to study players and formations...&quot; Always deeply interested in the game, while working as one of his family&#x27;s movie theater ushers, he removed football segments from newsreels the theater would show, so that he could take them home and study them on a projector he had bought. This dedication to filmed football plays made Gillman the first coach to study game footage, something that all coaches do today.

Gillman debated between pursuing a pro football career and entering coaching upon leaving college, with the Boston Redskins offering him a contract while Willaman wished to hire him as end coach at Western Reserve University. His participation in the inaugural Chicago College All-Star Game caused him to arrive late for Redskins training camp, and he would fail to make the team. He played one year in the American Football League (1936) for the Cleveland Rams.

=== College football coach ===
Gillman was a college football assistant coach for eight years before becoming a head coach. Gilman became an assistant coach at Ohio State under College Football Hall of Fame head coach Francis Schmidt (1934, 1938-40); Denison University under Tom Rogers (1935-37, 1941); and Miami University (Ohio) under Stu Holcomb.

At his Pro Football Hall of Fame induction, Gillman stated that Schmidt made a &quot;definite contribution to [Gillman&#x27;s] life&quot;. Gillman considered Schmidt an offensive football genius, ahead of his time, and the greatest coach ever. Schmidt&#x27;s number of plays and formations far exceeded his contemporaries, and he instituted a wide-open high scoring offense, extremely unusual for the 1930s (outside of the Southwest Conference), which also was a boon to the school growing its attendance during the Great Depression. However, Schmidt&#x27;s pursuit of high scoring, even in lop-sided games, resulted in his nickname being, Francis &quot;Shut the Gates of Mercy&quot; or &quot;Close the Gates of Mercy&quot; Schmidt. Gilman&#x27;s own offensive system as a coach was born under Schmidt&#x27;s influence. 

In 1948, after having started his head coaching career, he once more became an assistant coach, serving as the line coach under hall of fame head coach Earl Blaik of Army. He learned &quot;situational substitution&quot; (the platoon system) from Blaik, while teaching an innovative option blocking system to his players. While at Army he befriended future hall of fame coaching great Vince Lombardi, with whom he discussed football strategy. Upon leaving Army, Gillman successfully recommended Lombardi as his replacement. Lombardi would use Gillman&#x27;s blocking scheme to great effect as coach of the Green Bay Packers&#x27; championship teams. Lombardi also implemented Gillman&#x27;s method of film study and player grades with those teams.

In 1944, Gillman became head coach at Miami University, succeeding Holcomb, and coached there through 1947, where his record was 31–6–1. Among his players was Ara Parseghian, a future College Football Hall of Fame coach at Miami, Northwestern and Notre Dame. After a year at Army under Blaik, Gillman became head coach at the University of Cincinnati from 1949 to 1954, with a record of 50–13–1, three Mid-American Conference championships, and two bowl games; while making full use of situational substitution. He used film study and player grades at Cincinnati, and was once admonished by the NCAA for having the players review film during halftime of a game. 

At the time he left Cincinnati, it was written that Gillman had a forceful, confident and determined personality; was impatient with mistakes, the hardest working coach, a perfectionist, aimed to succeed at the highest level; and could run up the score like Schmidt. There was a division between those who admired him and those who criticized him. Altogether, he spent 21 years as a college coach or head coach, and his teams&#x27; total record as a head coach for these years was 81-19-2. As a college head coach, his teams outscored their opponents 2,571–1,017.

=== Professional football coach ===

==== Los Angeles Rams ====
He became a professional head coach for the first time with the Los Angeles Rams in 1955, after the team had declined in wins the previous two seasons (8–3–1 in 1953 and 6–5–1 in 1954). The Rams were a team bolstered and hindered by its emphasis on explosive offense as quarterbacked by Norm Van Brocklin. A trade for Jim Cason with the San Francisco 49ers also proved helpful in the rookie season that saw Gillman&#x27;s coaching described as &quot;red-meat, un-finessed brand of football&quot; on the way to a record of 8–3–1 that narrowly beat the Chicago Bears for the right to play for the 1955 NFL Championship Game (their fourth appearance in the past five seasons) against the defending league champion Cleveland Browns, appearing in their sixth straight NFL Championship Game. Playing at home in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum due to the rotation of the time, the Browns never trailed while forcing six Van Brocklin interceptions on their way to a 38–14 victory. 

His second season with the Rams, which saw them trade away future Hall of fame Defensive star Andy Robustelli in the offseason after a falling out with Gillman, was a disaster, as the team lost eight of their first ten games for a 4–8 overall record, their first losing mark since 1944 when the team was still in Cleveland. The 1957 season was the last for both Van Brocklin (traded to Philadelphia after the season, where he would win a championship in 1960 over Lombardi&#x27;s Packers) and receiver Elroy Hirsch, each future members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Van Brocklin and Gillman had clashed over tactics in 1957, and Van Brocklin would at times override Gillman. After that season, Van Brocklin demanded a trade or he would stay home and run his business, rather than join the team for the 1958 season. Hirsch retired after the 1957 season.

A multi-player deal with the Cardinals for Ollie Matson did not help matters. The season ended on a middling note as the Rams won their last two games of the year to finish at .500. The 1958 season was the closest the Rams got to the top of the division, finishing one game behind the Baltimore Colts. The 1959 season saw the Rams close the year with eight straight losses that led to the dismissal of Gillman.

==== Los Angeles/San Diego Chargers ====
He then moved to the American Football League (AFL, 1960–1969), where he coached the Los Angeles and San Diego Chargers to five Western Division titles and one league championship in the first six years of the AFL&#x27;s existence. 

His greatest coaching success came after he was persuaded by Barron Hilton, then the Chargers&#x27; majority owner, to become the head coach of the AFL franchise he planned to operate in Los Angeles. When the team&#x27;s general manager, Frank Leahy, became ill during the Chargers&#x27; founding season, its one season in Los Angeles before moving to San Diego, Gillman took on additional responsibilities as general manager. As the first coach of the Chargers, Gillman gave the team a mercurial personality that matched his own. 

It was with the Chargers that Gillman developed the innovative aggressive downfield passing attack for which he would become known, and which would change football. Gillman used the length and width of the field, and would stretch the field with the potential long pass, which opened up the middle of the field to runs and shorter passes. As described by one of Gillman&#x27;s first Chargers&#x27; offensive coaches, and future owner of the Oakland Raiders, hall of famer Al Davis, &quot;Sid Gillman was the father of modern-day passing... It had been thought of as vertical, the length of the field, but Sid also thought of it as horizontal. Sid used the width of the field.&quot; Hall of Fame coach Bill Walsh, who is usually identified with developing the West Coast Offense, stated much of what he did derived from Gillman. Walsh observed that Gilman had a level of understanding about football that only a few could fully comprehend. 

He had much to do with the AFL being able to establish itself. Gillman was a thorough professional, and in order to compete with him, his peers had to learn pro ways. They learned, and the AFL became the genesis of modern professional football. &quot;Sid Gillman brought class to the AFL,&quot; Oakland Raiders managing general partner Al Davis once said of the man he served under on that first Chargers team. &quot; Just being part of Sid&#x27;s organization was like going to a laboratory for the highly developed science of professional football.&quot; Others however, painted Gillman as someone who kept the team under pressure at all times regardless of how it felt for the players, with Dickie Post, a running back who played for Gillman from 1967-69, calling him a &quot;dictator&quot;. On the other hand, Chargers receiver and tight end Dave Kocourek (1960-65) found Gillman a people person who was not given proper credit for his interpersonal skills. Future Hall of Fame receiver Lance Alworth said of Gillman, &quot;Sid Gillman is a fantastic person, with a brilliant mind, and he has taught John [Hadl] a lot.&quot; 

Described as &quot;impulsive&quot; by quarterback John Hadl, in 1965, Gillman had arguments with defensive stars Ernie Ladd and Earl Faison over salaries and bonuses, in light of rookie bonuses being paid in sums that far exceeded the salaries of these two star players. Ladd and Faison took the position they would play out their contracts and become free agents. They were both traded to Houston before the 1966 season. The league&#x27;s owners were all concerned about paying bonuses to veteran players, and the effect on the league&#x27;s viability. When Faison was traded in 1966, Gillman called the former four-time All-AFL defensive end one who &quot;has a long way to go to become average, much less outstanding.&quot; Hadl stated that these removals were part of the beginning of the decline of the Chargers in the late 1960s. When asked about the money made by players once, Gillman responded by saying “With some of them, football is a vocation. With some, it&#x27;s an avocation. You know what football is to me? It&#x27;s blood.”

Through Gillman&#x27;s tenure as head coach, the Chargers went 87–57–6 and won five AFL Western Division titles. The 1960 and 1961 teams were led by future Hall of Fame player Jack Kemp (1960-61) at quarterback to go with Paul Lowe (1960-61) and Keith Lincoln (1961) as running backs. They narrowly lost each time in the AFL Championship Game to the Houston Oilers. In 1962, with injuries to Kemp and rookie future Hall of Fame receiver Lance Alworth, the Chargers had their only losing season in their AFL tenure (4–10). Even worse for Gillman, he put Kemp on waivers on a Saturday before a game to open up a roster spot, with the common custom being that no other team would claim a player when so waived. Lou Saban and the Buffalo Bills ignored custom and bought Kemp&#x27;s rights for $100. They made Kemp their starting quarterback at the end of the 1962 season until his retirement in 1969, where he won two AFL titles. Gillman was enraged beyond words, but could not undo the transaction. 

John Hadl had been drafted in 1962 as quarterback, but the 1963 season would have 35-year old Tobin Rote as the primary starter at quarterback. Thar year, under an MVP season from Rote (with Alworth second in the balloting), they captured the only league championship the franchise ever won by outscoring the Boston Patriots, 51–10, in the American Football League championship game in Balboa Stadium. Gillman crafted a game plan, &quot;Feast or Famine&quot;, that used motion, then seldom seen, to negate the Patriots&#x27; blitzes. His plan freed running back Keith Lincoln to rush for 206 yards, and have another 123 yards receiving. 

In addition to Lincoln, Alworth, Kemp, Lowe, Ladd, Faison and Hadl on Gillman&#x27;s teams through the &#x27;60s, Gillman also coached such notable players as future hall of fame offensive tackle Ron Mix, Speedy Duncan, Kenny Graham, Dick Westmoreland, and Frank Buncom. Mix grew up in Los Angeles in a sometimes hard-pressed Jewish family, living in a neighborhood where they were the only Jews, and had taken great pride as a young teenager in 1955 when he learned the Rams new head coach, Gillman, was also Jewish. As a player, he found Gillman hard but fair, treating everyone equally. Gillman and Al Davis (also Jewish), emphasized recruiting from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), and Gillman instituted a training camp policy that players would room together based on position so that black and white players would room together, a rarity in the early 1960s. 

Gillman was one of only two head coaches to hold that position for the entire 10-year existence of the American Football League (the other being fellow Hall of Fame coach Hank Stram, who coached the Dallas Texans and Kansas City Chiefs from 1960 through 1974). Gillman approached NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle in 1963 with the idea of having the champions of the AFL and the NFL play a single final game, but his idea was not implemented until the Super Bowl (originally titled the &quot;AFL-NFL World Championship Game&quot;) was played in 1967. Gillman left the Chargers nine games into the 1969 season due to a hiatal hernia only to come back to coach the first ten games of the 1971 season. He resigned as head coach and executive vice-president in November 1971, with general manager Harland Svare finishing out the year as coach.

==== Later NFL career ====
Gillman served as a quality control coach for the Dallas Cowboys in 1972. In March 1973, Bud Adams hired Gillman to serve as executive vice president and general manager of the Houston Oilers (to replace John W. Breen) after head coach Bill Peterson won one game in his inaugural season as coach. The 1973 season turned out to be a worse disaster, as the Oilers continued their losing ways. Before the fourth game, Gillman took over the duties of offensive coordinator. After a fifth straight loss to start the season, Gillman took over as coach by firing Peterson, which saw them win once the rest of the way. 

In 1974, Gillman hired Bum Phillips (the defensive coordinator for the 1967-71 Charger teams) to serve as defensive coordinator. The 1974 team won on opening day before going on a five-game losing streak. Midway through the season, Gillman and the Oilers acquired future Hall of Fame defensive tackle Curley Culp and a first-round draft choice in 1975 from the Kansas City Chiefs for John Matuszak (each player had threatened to jump to the World Football League). They then won four games in a row to get to 5–5 before trading wins and losses in the last four games of the year, which included a win over the Cleveland Browns to close the season at 7-7 (.500), their first non-losing season in four years. He was awarded the AFC Coach of the Year by UPI after the season before electing to move back to the GM position while Phillips was promoted to head coach. 

The matter of who would do what for personnel proved to key in the eventual departure of Gillman. The contract that Phillips had signed with Gillman had a clause that gave him final approval of the moves that Phillips wanted to make, but this clause was asked to be removed by Phillips in a meeting between him and Adams when Gillman was out of town, which was accepted. Later, with the support of Adams, Phillips had Gillman barred from being able to attend practice or be in the locker room. Gillman appealed to Adams about the changes but resigned when Adams sided with Phillips, who was later quoted as stating &quot;I had control of the team. I had the right to draft, waive, trade. I had the control I needed. That&#x27;s what [Gillman] gave me. I told Sid that&#x27;s what I wanted, and he said that was fine. We didn&#x27;t have any disagreement over that. Evidently, the disagreement was with Bud. “There was a whole lot of stories running around, I guess. Believe me, I&#x27;m telling you what happened. I worked for [Gillman] for six years, and I enjoyed it for six years. If he wanted to draft somebody that I didn&#x27;t want to draft, we wouldn&#x27;t have drafted him. I had no problem with knowing my responsibilities.&quot; With Phillips at the helm and a defensive front that would have Culp for years to come alongside that draft choice used to draft future Hall of Fame linebacker Robert Brazile, the Oilers jumped to ten wins in the following season (1975).

In 1977, Gillman was hired as offensive coordinator for the Chicago Bears. The Bears, with Walter Payton leading the way in rushing yards (1,852), won 9 games and earned their first postseason appearance in 14 years, which ended in a loss in the Divisional Round. However, Gillman resigned after the year when his ideas about opening up the offense was rejected. For four months of 1978, Gillman was the coach of the football team at United States International University; one of the coaches he hired was Tom Walsh, who would coach the team when Gillman left in early 1979. 

Philadelphia Eagles coach Dick Vermeil hired Gillman in 1979 to take over an offense ranked 27th, 19th, and 18th the previous three seasons. In Gillman&#x27;s three years under Vermeil, the Eagles scored the 3rd-most points in the NFL, won the 2nd-most games, reached the playoffs all three seasons, and reached their first Super Bowl in 1980, with Vermeil stating that the appearance in the Super Bowl would not have happened without the &quot;encyclopedia&quot; knowledge of Gillman. He had retired after the 1980 season as “Physically and mentally drained&quot; before returning in 1982 to the Eagles. Eagles quarterback Ron Jaworski considered Gilman his closest mentor. At this point in his career, Gillman was the measured buffer between Jaworski and the hard-driving intense Vermeil. Gillman taught Jaworski and future Hall of Fame receiver Harold Carmichael their signature &quot;meet me at the corner&quot; play.

In July 1983, at age 71, Gillman came out of retirement after an offer from Bill Tatham Sr. and Bill Tatham Jr., owners of the United States Football League (USFL) expansion team the Oklahoma Outlaws. Gillman agreed to serve as director of operations and signed quarterback Doug Williams, who later led the Washington Redskins to victory in Super Bowl XXII. Although Gillman signed a roster of players to play for the Tulsa, Oklahoma-based franchise, he was fired by Tatham six months later in a dispute over finances. Gillman then served as a consultant for the USFL&#x27;s Los Angeles Express in 1984, where John Hadl was the coach and future Hall of Famer Steve Young was the quarterback. He later did work for the Eagles as a quarterback coach in 1985 (Randall Cunningham&#x27;s rookie year) before serving as an unpaid consultant to the University of Pittsburgh football team (as coached by Mike Gottfried) in 1987, earning a game ball after Pitt upset Notre Dame. Even when he was out of coaching by 1991, Gillman was still at the helm of looking at tapes of game film, with a number of teams regularly sending him coaching tapes for him to view through multiple VCRs.

&quot;Numbers in parentheses indicate Super Bowls won by Gillman&#x27;s &quot;descendants&quot; as head coach, a total of 29.&quot;

Don Coryell, the coach at San Diego State University when Gillman was coaching the San Diego Chargers, would bring his team to Chargers&#x27; practices to watch how Gillman ran his practices. Coryell went on to coach in the NFL, and some of his assistants, influenced by the Gillman style, included coaches Joe Gibbs, Ernie Zampese, Tom Bass, and Russ A. Molzahn. A larger and more extended version of Sid Gillman&#x27;s coaching tree, which in some ways could be called a forest, can be found here.

<text>Middlemarch, A Study of Provincial Life is a novel by English author George Eliot, the pen name of Mary Ann Evans. It appeared in eight installments (volumes) in 1871 and 1872. Set in Middlemarch, a fictional English Midlands town, in 1829 to 1832, it follows distinct, intersecting stories with many characters. Issues include the status of women, the nature of marriage, idealism, self-interest, religion, hypocrisy, political reform, and education. Leavened with comic elements, &quot;Middlemarch&quot; approaches significant historical events in a realist mode: the Reform Act 1832, early railways, and the accession of King William IV. It looks at medicine of the time and reactionary views in a settled community facing unwelcome change. Eliot began writing the two pieces that formed the novel in 1869–1870 and completed it in 1871. Initial reviews were mixed, but it is now seen widely as her best work and one of the great English novels.

==Background==

&quot;Middlemarch&quot; originates in two unfinished pieces that Eliot worked on during 1869 and 1870: the novel &quot;&quot;Middlemarch&quot; (which focused on the character of Lydgate) and the long story &quot;Miss Brooke&quot; (which focused on the character of Dorothea). The former piece is first mentioned in her journal on 1 January 1869 as one of the tasks for the coming year. In August she began writing, but progress ceased in the following month amidst a lack of confidence in it and distraction by the illness of George Henry Lewes&#x27;s son Thornie, who was dying of tuberculosis. (Eliot had been living with Lewes since 1854.) After Thornie&#x27;s death on 19 October 1869, all work on the novel stopped; it is uncertain whether Eliot intended at the time to revive it at a later date.

In December she wrote of having begun another story, on a subject that she had considered &quot;ever since I began to write fiction&quot;. By the end of the month she had written 100 pages of this story and entitled it &quot;Miss Brooke&quot;. Although a precise date is unknown, the process of incorporating material from &quot;&quot;Middlemarch&quot; into the story she had been working on was ongoing by March 1871. While composing, Eliot compiled a notebook of hundreds of literary quotations, from poets, historians, playwrights, philosophers, and critics in eight different languages.

By May 1871, the growing length of the novel had become a concern to Eliot, as it threatened to exceed the three-volume format that was then the norm in publishing. The issue was compounded because Eliot&#x27;s most recent novel, &quot;Felix Holt, the Radical&quot; (1866) – also set in the same pre-Reform Bill England – had not sold well. The publisher John Blackwood, who had made a loss on acquiring the English rights to that novel, was approached by Lewes in his role as Eliot&#x27;s literary agent. He suggested that the novel be brought out in eight two-monthly parts, borrowing the method used for Victor Hugo&#x27;s novel &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. This was an alternative to the monthly issues that had been used for such longer works as Dickens&#x27;s &quot;David Copperfield&quot; and Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, and avoided Eliot&#x27;s objections to slicing her novel into small parts. Blackwood agreed, although he feared there would be &quot;complaints of a want of the continuous interest in the story&quot; due to the independence of each volume. The eight books duly appeared during 1872, the last three instalments being issued monthly.

With the deaths of Thackeray and Dickens in 1863 and 1870, respectively, Eliot became &quot;recognised as the greatest living English novelist&quot; at the time of the novel&#x27;s final publication.

==Plot==

&quot;Middlemarch&quot; centres on the lives of residents of Middlemarch, a fictitious Midlands town, from 1829 onwards – the years up to the 1832 Reform Act. The narrative may be considered to consist of four plots with unequal emphasis: the life of Dorothea Brooke, the career of Tertius Lydgate, the courtship of Mary Garth by Fred Vincy, and the disgrace of Nicholas Bulstrode. The two main plots are those of Dorothea and Lydgate. Each plot occurs concurrently, although Bulstrode&#x27;s is centred on the later chapters.
Dorothea Brooke is a 19-year-old orphan, living with her younger sister, Celia, as a ward of her uncle, Mr Brooke. Dorothea is an especially pious young woman whose hobby involves the renovation of buildings belonging to the tenant farmers, although her uncle discourages her. Dorothea is courted by Sir James Chettam, a man close to her own age, but she is oblivious to him. She is attracted instead to the Rev. Edward Casaubon, a 45-year-old scholar. Dorothea accepts Casaubon&#x27;s offer of marriage, despite her sister&#x27;s misgivings. Chettam is encouraged to turn his attention to Celia, who has developed an interest in him.

Fred and Rosamond Vincy are the eldest children of Middlemarch&#x27;s town mayor. Having never finished university, Fred is widely seen as a failure and a layabout, but is content because he is the presumed heir of his childless uncle Mr Featherstone, a rich but unpleasant man. Featherstone keeps as a companion a niece of his by marriage, Mary Garth; although she is considered plain, Fred is in love with her and wants to marry her.

Dorothea and Casaubon experience the first tensions in their marriage on their honeymoon in Rome, when Dorothea finds that her husband has no interest in involving her in his intellectual pursuits. She meets Will Ladislaw, Casaubon&#x27;s much younger disinherited cousin, whom he supports financially. Ladislaw begins to feel attracted to Dorothea; she remains oblivious, but the two become friendly.

Fred becomes deeply in debt and finds himself unable to repay what he owes. Having asked Mr Garth, Mary&#x27;s father, to co-sign the debt, he now tells Garth he must forfeit it. As a result, Mrs Garth&#x27;s savings from four years of income, held in reserve for the education of one of her sons, are wiped out, as are Mary&#x27;s savings. Mr Garth consequently warns Mary against ever marrying Fred.

Fred comes down with typhoid fever and is treated by Dr Tertius Lydgate, a newly-arrived doctor in Middlemarch. Lydgate has modern ideas about medicine and sanitation which draw the ire and criticism of many in town. He allies himself with Bulstrode, a wealthy, church-going landowner and developer who wants to build a hospital and clinic that follow Lydgate&#x27;s philosophy, despite the misgivings of Lydgate&#x27;s friend, the Rev. Farebrother, about Bulstrode&#x27;s integrity. Lydgate also becomes acquainted with Rosamond Vincy, who is beautiful and educated, but shallow and self-absorbed. Seeking to make a good match, she decides to marry Lydgate, who comes from a wealthy family, and uses Fred&#x27;s sickness as an opportunity to get close to him. Lydgate initially views their relationship as pure flirtation and backs away from Rosamond after discovering that the town considers them practically engaged. However, on seeing her a final time, he breaks his resolution, and the two become engaged.

Casaubon arrives back from Rome about the same time, but suffers a heart attack. Lydgate attends him and tells Dorothea it is difficult to pronounce on the nature of Casaubon&#x27;s illness and chances of recovery: that he may indeed live about 15 years if he takes it easy and ceases his studies, but it is equally possible the disease may develop rapidly, in which case death will be sudden. As Fred recovers, Mr Featherstone falls ill. On his deathbed, he reveals that he has made two wills and tries to get Mary to help him destroy one. Unwilling to be involved in the business, she refuses, and Featherstone dies with both wills still intact. Featherstone&#x27;s plan had been for £10,000 to go to Fred Vincy, but his estate and fortune instead go to his illegitimate son, Joshua Rigg.

Casaubon, in poor health, has grown suspicious of Dorothea&#x27;s goodwill to Ladislaw. He tries to make Dorothea promise, if he should die, to forever &quot;avoid doing what I should deprecate, and apply yourself to do what I should desire&quot;. She hesitates to make a promise without knowing what it would entail, and he dies before she can reply. Casaubon&#x27;s will is revealed to contain a provision that, if Dorothea marries Ladislaw, she will lose her inheritance. This proviso leads to the general suspicion that Ladislaw and Dorothea are lovers, creating awkwardness between the two. Ladislaw is in love with Dorothea but keeps this secret, having no desire to involve her in scandal or cause her disinheritance. She realizes she has romantic feelings for him, but must suppress them. He remains in Middlemarch, working as a newspaper editor for Mr Brooke, who is mounting a campaign to run for Parliament on a Reform platform.

Lydgate&#x27;s efforts to please Rosamond soon leave him deeply in debt, and he is forced to seek help from Bulstrode. Meanwhile, Fred Vincy&#x27;s humiliation at being responsible for Caleb Garth&#x27;s financial setbacks shocks him into reassessing his life. He resolves to train as a land agent under the forgiving Caleb. He asks the Rev. Farebrother to plead his case to Mary Garth, not realizing that Farebrother is also in love with her. Farebrother does speak to her, thereby sacrificing his own desires for the sake of Mary, who he realises truly loves Fred and is just waiting for Fred to find his place in the world.

John Raffles, a mysterious man who knows of Bulstrode&#x27;s shady past, appears in Middlemarch, intending to blackmail him. In his youth, the church-going Bulstrode engaged in questionable financial dealings; his fortune is founded on his marriage to a wealthy, much older widow. The widow&#x27;s daughter, who should have inherited her mother&#x27;s fortune, had run away; Bulstrode located her but did not tell the widow, so that he, instead of her daughter, inherited the fortune. The widow&#x27;s daughter had a son, who turns out to be Ladislaw. On grasping their connection, Bulstrode is consumed with guilt and offers Ladislaw a large sum of money, which Ladislaw refuses as being tainted. Bulstrode&#x27;s terror of public exposure as a hypocrite leads him to hasten the death of the mortally sick Raffles, while lending a large sum to Lydgate, whom Bulstrode had previously refused to bail out of his debt. However, the story of Bulstrode&#x27;s misdeeds has already spread. Bulstrode&#x27;s disgrace engulfs Lydgate: knowledge of the loan spreads and he is assumed to be complicit with Bulstrode. Only Dorothea and Farebrother retain any faith in him, yet the widespread condemnation still drives Lydgate and Rosamond to leave Middlemarch. Disgraced and reviled, Bulstrode&#x27;s one consolation is that his wife stands by him as he too faces exile.

When Mr Brooke&#x27;s election campaign collapses, Ladislaw decides to leave the town and visits Dorothea to say his farewell, but Dorothea has fallen in love with him. She renounces Casaubon&#x27;s fortune and shocks her family by announcing that she will marry Ladislaw. At the same time, Fred, having been successful in his new career, marries Mary.

The &quot;Finale&quot; details the ultimate fortunes of the main characters. Fred and Mary marry and live contentedly with their three sons. Lydgate operates a successful practice outside Middlemarch and attains a good income, but never finds fulfilment and dies at the age of 50, leaving Rosamond and four children. After he dies, Rosamond marries a wealthy physician. Ladislaw engages in public reform, and Dorothea is content as a wife and mother to their two children. Their son eventually inherits Arthur Brooke&#x27;s estate.

==Characters==

* Dorothea Brooke: An intelligent, wealthy woman with great aspirations, Dorothea avoids displaying her wealth and embarks upon projects such as redesigning cottages for her uncle&#x27;s tenants. She marries the elderly Reverend Edward Casaubon, with the idealistic idea of helping him in his research, &quot;The Key to All Mythologies&quot;. However, the marriage was a mistake, as Casaubon fails to take her seriously and resents her youth, enthusiasm, and energy. Her requests to assist him make it harder for him to conceal that his research is years out of date. Faced with Casaubon&#x27;s coldness on their honeymoon, Dorothea becomes friends with his relative, Will Ladislaw. Some years after Casaubon&#x27;s death she falls in love with Will and marries him.
* Tertius Lydgate: An idealistic, talented, but naive young doctor, is relatively poor, but of good birth. He hopes to make big advances in medicine through his research, but ends up in an unhappy marriage with Rosamond Vincy. His attempts to show he is answerable to no man fail, and he eventually has to leave town, sacrificing his high ideals to please his wife.
* Rev. Edward Casaubon : A pedantic, selfish, elderly clergyman who is so taken up with his scholarly research that his marriage to Dorothea is loveless. His unfinished book, &quot;The Key to All Mythologies&quot;, is intended as a monument to Christian syncretism, but his research is out of date as he cannot read German. He is aware of this but admits it to no one.
* Mary Garth: The plain, kind daughter of Caleb and Susan Garth serves as Mr Featherstone&#x27;s nurse. She and Fred Vincy were childhood sweethearts, but she will not let him woo her until he shows himself willing and able to live seriously, practically and sincerely.
* Arthur Brooke: The oft-befuddled, none-too-clever uncle of Dorothea and Celia Brooke has a reputation as the worst landlord in the county, but stands for Parliament on a Reform platform.
* Celia Brooke: Dorothea&#x27;s younger sister is a beauty. She is more sensual than Dorothea and does not share her idealism and asceticism. She is only too happy to marry Sir James Chettam when Dorothea rejects him.
* Sir James Chettam: A neighbouring landowner, he is in love with Dorothea and helps with her plans to improve conditions for the tenants. When she marries Casaubon, he marries Celia Brooke.
* Rosamond Vincy: Vain, beautiful and shallow, Rosamond has a high opinion of her own charms and a low opinion of Middlemarch society. She marries Tertius Lydgate, believing he will raise her social standing and keep her comfortable. When her husband meets financial difficulties, she thwarts his efforts to economise, seeing such sacrifices as beneath her and insulting. She cannot bear the idea of losing social status.
* Fred Vincy: Rosamond&#x27;s brother has loved Mary Garth from childhood. His family hopes he will advance socially by becoming a clergyman, but he knows Mary will not marry him if he does. Brought up to expect an inheritance from his uncle, Mr Featherstone, he is a spendthrift, but later changes through his love for Mary and finds by studying under Mary&#x27;s father a profession that gains Mary&#x27;s respect.
* Will Ladislaw: This young cousin of Mr Casaubon has no property, as his grandmother married a poor Polish musician and was disinherited. He is a man of verve, idealism and talent, but no fixed profession. He is in love with Dorothea, but cannot marry her without her losing Mr Casaubon&#x27;s property.
* Humphrey Cadwallader and Elinor Cadwallader: Neighbours of the Brookes, Mr Cadwallader is a rector and Mrs Cadwallader a pragmatic and talkative woman who comments on local affairs with wry cynicism. She disapproves of Dorothea&#x27;s marriage and Mr Brooke&#x27;s parliamentary endeavours.
* Walter Vincy and Lucy Vincy: A respectable manufacturing couple, they wish their children to advance socially and are disappointed by Rosamond&#x27;s and Fred&#x27;s marriages. Vincy&#x27;s sister is married to Nicholas Bulstrode. Mrs Vincy was an innkeeper&#x27;s daughter and her sister the second wife of Mr. Featherstone.
* Caleb Garth: Mary Garth&#x27;s father is a kind, honest, generous surveyor and land agent involved in farm management. He is fond of Fred and eventually takes him under his wing.
* Camden Farebrother: A poor but clever vicar and amateur naturalist, he is a friend of Lydgate and Fred Vincy and loves Mary Garth. His position improves when Dorothea appoints him to a living after Casaubon&#x27;s death.
* Nicholas Bulstrode: A wealthy banker married to Vincy&#x27;s sister, Harriet, he is a pious Methodist keen to impose his beliefs in Middlemarch society. However, he has a sordid past he is desperate to hide. His religion favours his personal desires and lacks sympathy for others.
* Peter Featherstone: An old landlord of Stone Court, he is a self-made man, who has married Caleb Garth&#x27;s sister. On her death he takes Mrs Vincy&#x27;s sister as his second wife.
* Jane Waule: A widow and Peter Featherstone&#x27;s sister, she has a son, John.
* Mr Hawley: A foul-mouthed businessman, he is an enemy of Bulstrode.
* Mr Mawmsey: A grocer
* Dr Sprague: A Middlemarch physician
* Mr Tyke: A clergyman favoured by Bulstrode
* Joshua Rigg Featherstone: Featherstone&#x27;s illegitimate son, he appears at the reading of Featherstone&#x27;s will and receives a fortune instead of Fred. He is also the stepson of John Raffles, who comes into town to visit Rigg, but instead reveals Bulstrode&#x27;s past. His appearance in the novel is crucial to the plot.
* John Raffles: Raffles is a braggart and a bully, a humorous scoundrel in the tradition of Sir John Falstaff, and an alcoholic. But unlike Falstaff, Raffles is a truly evil man. He holds the key to Bulstrode&#x27;s dark past and Lydgate&#x27;s future.

==Historical novel==
The action of &quot;Middlemarch&quot; takes place &quot;between September 1829 and May 1832&quot;, or 40 years before its publication in 1871–1872, a gap not so pronounced for it to be regularly labelled as a historical novel. By comparison, Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Waverley&quot; (1814) – often seen as the first major historical novel – takes place some 60 years before it appears. Eliot had previously written a more obviously historical novel, &quot;Romola&quot; (1862–1863), set in 15th-century Florence. The critics Kathleen Blake and Michael York Mason argue that there has been insufficient attention given to &quot;Middlemarch&quot; &quot;as a historical novel that evokes the past in relation to the present&quot;.

The critic Rosemary Ashton notes that the lack of attention to this side of the novel may indicate its merits: &quot;&quot;Middlemarch&quot; is that very rare thing, a successful historical novel. In fact, it is so successful that we scarcely think of it in terms of that subgenre of fiction.&quot; For its contemporary readers, the present &quot;was the passage of the Second Reform Act in 1867&quot;; the agitation for the Reform Act 1832 and its turbulent passage through the two Houses of Parliament, which provide the structure of the novel, would have been seen as the past.

Though rarely categorised as a historical novel, &quot;Middlemarch&quot;″s attention to historical detail has been noticed; in an 1873 review, Henry James recognised that Eliot&#x27;s &quot;purpose was to be a generous rural historian&quot;. Elsewhere, Eliot has been seen to adopt &quot;the role of imaginative historian, even scientific investigator in &quot;Middlemarch&quot; and her narrator as conscious &quot;of the historiographical questions involved in writing a social and political history of provincial life&quot;. This critic compares the novel to &quot;a work of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus&quot;, who is often described as &quot;The Father of History&quot;.

==Themes==
===&quot;A Study of Provincial Life&quot;===
The fictional town of Middlemarch, North Loamshire, is probably based on Coventry, where Eliot had lived before moving to London. Like Coventry, Middlemarch is described as a silk-ribbon manufacturing town.

The subtitle—&quot;A Study of Provincial Life&quot;—has been seen as significant. One critic views the unity of &quot;Middlemarch&quot; as achieved through &quot;the fusion of the two senses of &#x27;provincial&#x27;&quot;: on the one hand it means geographically &quot;all parts of the country except the capital&quot;; and on the other, a person who is &quot;unsophisticated&quot; or &quot;narrow-minded&quot;. Carolyn Steedman links Eliot&#x27;s emphasis on provincialism in &quot;Middlemarch&quot; to Matthew Arnold&#x27;s discussion of social class in England in &quot;Culture and Anarchy&quot; essays, published in 1869, about the time Eliot began working on the stories that became &quot;Middlemarch&quot;. There Arnold classes British society in terms of Barbarians (aristocrats and landed gentry), Philistines (urban middle class) and Populace (working class). Steedman suggests &quot;Middlemarch&quot; &quot;is a portrait of Philistine Provincialism&quot;.

It is worth noting that Eliot went to London, as her heroine Dorothea does at the end of the book. There Eliot achieved fame way beyond most women of her time, whereas Dorothea takes on the role of nurturing Will and her family. Eliot was rejected by her family once she had settled in her common-law relationship with Lewes, and &quot;their profound disapproval prevented her ever going home again&quot;. She omitted Coventry from her last visit to the Midlands in 1855.

===The &quot;Woman Question&quot;===
Central to &quot;Middlemarch&quot; is the idea that Dorothea Brooke cannot hope to achieve the heroic stature of a figure like Saint Teresa, for Eliot&#x27;s heroine lives at the wrong time, &quot;amidst the conditions of an imperfect social state, in which great feelings will often take the aspect of error, and great faith the aspect of illusion&quot;. Antigone, a figure from Greek mythology best known from Sophocles&#x27; play, is given in the &quot;Finale&quot; as a further example of a heroic woman. The literary critic Kathleen Blake notes Eliot&#x27;s emphasis on St Teresa&#x27;s &quot;very concrete accomplishment, the reform of a religious order&quot;, rather than her Christian mysticism. A frequent criticism by feminist critics is that not only is Dorothea less heroic than Saint Teresa and Antigone, but George Eliot herself. In response, Ruth Yeazell and Kathleen Blake chide these critics for &quot;expecting literary pictures of a strong woman succeeding in a period [around 1830] that did not make them likely in life&quot;. Eliot has also been criticised more widely for ending the novel with Dorothea marrying Will Ladislaw, someone so clearly her inferior. The novelist Henry James describes Ladislaw as a &quot;dilettante&quot; who &quot;has not the concentrated fervour essential in the man chosen by so nobly strenuous a heroine&quot;.

===Marriage===
Marriage is one of the major themes in &quot;Middlemarch&quot;. According to George Steiner, &quot;both principal plots [those of Dorothea and Lydgate] are case studies of unsuccessful marriage&quot;. This suggests that these &quot;disastrous marriages&quot; leave the lives of Dorothea and Lydgate unfulfilled. This is arguably more the case with Lydgate than with Dorothea, who gains a second chance through her later marriage to Will Ladislaw, but a favourable interpretation of this marriage depends on the character of Ladislaw himself, whom numerous critics have viewed as Dorothea&#x27;s inferior. In addition, there is the &quot;meaningless and blissful&quot; marriage of Dorothea&#x27;s sister Celia Brooke to Sir James Chettam, and more significantly Fred Vincy&#x27;s courting of Mary Garth. In the latter, Mary Garth will not accept Fred until he abandons the Church and settles on a more suitable career. Here Fred resembles Henry Fielding&#x27;s character Tom Jones, both being moulded into a good husband by the love they give to and receive from a woman.

Dorothea is a St Teresa, born in the wrong century, in provincial Middlemarch, who mistakes in her idealistic ardor, &quot;a poor dry mummified pedant... as a sort of angel of vocation&quot;. &quot;Middlemarch&quot; is in part a &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; focusing on the psychological or moral growth of the protagonist: Dorothea &quot;blindly gropes forward, making mistakes in her sometimes foolish, often egotistical, but also admirably idealistic attempt to find a role&quot; or vocation that fulfils her nature. Lydgate is equally mistaken in his choice of a partner, as his idea of a perfect wife is someone &quot;who can sing and play the piano and provide a soft cushion for her husband to rest after work&quot;. So he marries Rosamond Vincy, &quot;the woman in the novel who most contrasts with Dorothea&quot;, and thereby &quot;deteriorates from ardent researcher to fashionable doctor in London&quot;.

==Critical reception==
===Contemporary reviews===
&quot;The Examiner&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot; and &quot;Athenaeum&quot; reviewed each of the eight books that comprise &quot;Middlemarch&quot; as they were published from December 1871 to December 1872; such reviews speculated on the eventual direction of the plot and responded accordingly. Contemporary response to the novel was mixed. Writing as it was being published, the &quot;Spectator&quot; reviewer R. H. Hutton criticised it for what he saw as its melancholic quality. &quot;Athenaeum&quot;, reviewing it after &quot;serialisation&quot;, found the work overwrought and thought it would have benefited from hastier composition. &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Edinburgh Magazine&quot; reviewer W. L. Collins saw as the work&#x27;s most forceful impression its ability to make readers sympathise with the characters. Edith Simcox of &quot;Academy&quot; offered high praises, hailing it as a landmark in fiction owing to the originality of its form; she rated it first amongst Eliot&#x27;s œuvre, which meant it &quot;has scarcely a superior and very few equals in the whole wide range of English fiction&quot;.

Henry James presented a mixed opinion, &quot;Middlemarch&quot;, according to him, was &quot;at once one of the strongest and one of the weakest of English novels ... &quot;Middlemarch&quot; is a treasure-house of details, but it is an indifferent whole&quot;. Among the details, his greatest criticism (&quot;the only eminent failure in the book&quot;) was of the character of Ladislaw, who he felt was an insubstantial hero-figure as against Lydgate. The scenes between Lydgate and Rosamond he especially praised for their psychological depth – he doubted whether there were any scenes &quot;more powerfully real... [or] intelligent&quot; in all English fiction.
Thérèse Bentzon, for the &quot;Revue des deux Mondes&quot;, was critical of &quot;Middlemarch&quot;. Although finding merit in certain scenes and qualities, she faulted its structure as &quot;made up of a succession of unconnected chapters, following each other at random... The final effect is one of an incoherence which nothing can justify.&quot; In her view, Eliot&#x27;s prioritisation of &quot;observation rather than imagination... inexorable analysis rather than sensibility, passion or fantasy&quot; means that she should not be held amongst the first ranks of novelists. The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who read &quot;Middlemarch&quot; in a translation owned by his mother and sister, derided the novel for construing suffering as a means of expiating the debt of sin, which he found characteristic of &quot;little moralistic females à la Eliot&quot;.

Despite the divided contemporary response, &quot;Middlemarch&quot; gained immediate admirers: in 1873, the poet Emily Dickinson expressed high praise for the novel, exclaiming in a letter to a friend: &quot;What do I think of &quot;Middlemarch&quot;? What do I think of glory.&quot;
In separate centuries, Florence Nightingale and Kate Millett remarked on the eventual subordination of Dorothea&#x27;s own dreams to those of her admirer, Ladislaw. Indeed, the ending acknowledges this and mentions how unfavourable social conditions prevented her from fulfilling her potential.

===Later responses===
In the first half of the 20th century, &quot;Middlemarch&quot; continued to provoke contrasting responses; while Leslie Stephen dismissed the novel in 1902, his daughter Virginia Woolf described it in 1919 as &quot;the magnificent book that, which with all its imperfections, is one of the few English novels written for grown-up people.&quot; However, Woolf was &quot;virtually unique&quot; among the modernists in her unstinting praise for &quot;Middlemarch&quot;, and the novel also remained overlooked by the reading public of the time.

F. R. Leavis&#x27;s &quot;The Great Tradition&quot; (1948) is credited with having &quot;rediscovered&quot; the novel:
The necessary part of great intellectual powers in such a success as &quot;Middlemarch&quot; is obvious ... the sheer informedness about society, its mechanisms, the ways in which people of different classes live ... a novelist whose genius manifests itself in a profound analysis of the individual.
Leavis&#x27; appraisal of it has been hailed as the beginning of a critical consensus that still exists towards the novel, in which it is recognised not only as Eliot&#x27;s finest work, but as one of the greatest novels in English. V. S. Pritchett, in &quot;The Living Novel&quot;, two years earlier, in 1946 had written that &quot;No Victorian novel approaches &quot;Middlemarch&quot; in its width of reference, its intellectual power, or the imperturbable spaciousness of its narrative ... I doubt if any Victorian novelist has as much to teach the modern novelists as George Eliot ... No writer has ever represented the ambiguities of moral choice so fully&quot;.

In the 21st century, the novel is still held in high regard. The novelists Martin Amis and Julian Barnes have both called it probably the greatest novel in the English language, and today &quot;Middlemarch&quot; is frequently included in university courses. In 2013, the then British Education Secretary Michael Gove referred to &quot;Middlemarch&quot; in a speech, suggesting its superiority to Stephenie Meyer&#x27;s vampire novel &quot;Twilight&quot;. Gove&#x27;s comments led to debate on teaching &quot;Middlemarch&quot; in Britain, including the question of when novels like &quot;Middlemarch&quot; should be read, and the role of canonical texts in teaching. The novel has remained a favourite with readers and scores high in reader rankings: in 2003 it was No. 27 in the BBC&#x27;s The Big Read, and in 2007 it was No. 10 in &quot;The 10 Greatest Books of All Time&quot;, based on a ballot of 125 selected writers. In 2015, in a BBC Culture poll of book critics outside the UK, the novel was ranked at number one in &quot;The 100 greatest British novels&quot;.

On 5 November 2019, the &quot;BBC News&quot; reported that &quot;Middlemarch&quot; is on the BBC list of 100 &quot;most inspiring&quot; novels.

==Legacy and adaptations==
&quot;Middlemarch&quot; has been adapted several times for television and the stage. In 1968 it appeared as a BBC-produced TV mini-series of the same name, directed by Joan Craft, starring Michele Dotrice. The first episode, &quot;Dorothea&quot;, is missing from the BBC Archives, while the third episode, &quot;The New Doctor&quot;, can be viewed online, although only as a low-quality black and white telerecording owned by a private collector. The other five episodes have been withheld from public viewing. In 1994 it was again adapted by the BBC as a television series of the same name, directed by Anthony Page with a screenplay by Andrew Davies. This was a critical and financial success and revived public interest adaptating the classics. In 2013 came a stage adaptation, and also an Orange Tree Theatre Repertory production adapted and directed by Geoffrey Beevers as three plays: &quot;Dorothea&#x27;s Story&quot;, &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Story&quot;, and &quot;Fred &amp; Mary&quot;. The novel has never been made into a film, although the idea was toyed with by the English director Sam Mendes. In April 2022, Dash Arts produced &quot;The Great Middlemarch Mystery&quot;, an immersive theatre experience staged across three locations in Coventry, including Drapers Hall.

The opera &quot;Middlemarch in Spring&quot; by Allen Shearer, to a libretto by Claudia Stevens, has a cast of six and treats only the central story of Dorothea Brooke. It was first staged in San Francisco in 2015. In 2017, a modern adaptation, &quot;Middlemarch: The Series&quot;, aired on YouTube as a video blog. Lyrics for the song &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot; by The Smiths were taken from &quot;Middlemarch&quot; (&quot;I am the son and heir, of nothing in particular&quot;).

<text>All My Babies: A Midwife&#x27;s Own Story is a 1953 educational film written, directed and produced by George C. Stoney which was used to educate midwives in the Southern United States and promote greater cooperation between midwifery and the modern health system. It was produced by the Georgia Department of Public Health. The film follows Mary Francis Hill Coley (1900–66) an African American midwife from Albany, Georgia who helped deliver over 3,000 babies in the middle part of the 20th century. On December 17, 2002, it was announced by Librarian of Congress James H. Billington that &quot;All My Babies, George Stoney&#x27;s landmark educational film used to educate midwives in Georgia and throughout the South&quot; was among the annual selection of 25 motion pictures to be added to the National Film Registry.

== Plot ==
The film was produced as a method of educating &quot;granny midwives,&quot; the term applied to African-American lay women who delivered the majority of both black and white women&#x27;s babies in the rural south, and their patients. The film stresses the need for midwives to maintain scrupulous standards of sterility. This lecture comes from a doctor who is explaining the cause of a recent infant death. The second message concerns the necessity of prenatal care and here Coley, or &quot;Miss Mary&quot; as she&#x27;s referred to in the film, functions as the expert. The film follows her through two births, the first of which focuses on a woman who has had several successful deliveries, while the other woman has had two miscarriages due to lack of prenatal care. Under Coley&#x27;s careful guidance and tutelage, both women achieve successful pregnancies and home births. Films such as &quot;All My Babies&quot; represent part of the transition to State legal oversights and eventual elimination of lay midwifery (also called direct-entry midwifery) in many States.

== Production ==

&quot;All My Babies&quot; was written produced and directed by documentary filmmaker, George C. Stoney, and is one of his earliest and most widely recognized. Stoney was interested in the subject as a child watching the midwives go about their work in odd hours and later as a Southern field representative who gave midwives lifts and learning more about their work. He first worked with the Georgia Department of Public Health writing and directing &quot;Palmour Street&quot;, a documentary about mental health in black families. Due to its success the Georgia Department of Public Health determined he was qualified to direct a film on midwives and was initially granted $20,000. The final production cost was $45,000 and filming took place between August 1951 and fall 1952.

Stoney partnered local African American Dr. William Mason to gain the trust of the black community while Stoney, with backing from the health department, worked on gaining trust from the white community. To gain their trust, Stoney assured the white community that the film would not suggest an unhappy relationship between blacks and whites existed and worked with the local press to publish favorable articles. Stoney also gained the support of progressive black pastor, Bishop Noah, who preached to the Church of the Kingdom of God, and where Mary Coley attended, not to be afraid of white people. Coley and the congregation therefore welcomed both blacks and whites, including the all-white film crew, and weren&#x27;t overly suspicious due to Bishop Noah&#x27;s direction. While the white film crew and cast had a good working relationship, the film&#x27;s production wasn&#x27;t devoid of segregation or bias (racial and north–south) between the white community and cast and the crew and black cast. The southern medical establishment was also uneasy with the film&#x27;s glorification of the midwife&#x27;s role in the community.

Prior to filming, Stoney followed Coley at her appointments to do field research having learnt from &quot;Palmour Street&quot; that it is important to meet the black community where it was at to create an authentic film and not solely rely on information from experts and books. Coley advised on the film as well, helping to plan and structure the film&#x27;s scenes so they were more realistic to her work. While some scenes were scripted, the film is notable for featuring a 15-minute real-time sequence of a live birth, a technique pioneered by filmmakers Pare Lorentz and Robert Flaherty. The live birth scene is silent with narratives of the doctors, Coley, and the chorus creating the joyous music with the babies cries upon birth being the emphasis. The score, written by Louis Applebaum and performed by the Musical Art Chorus in Washington, D.C., gives the film a sense of joy during childbirth. Coley also sings throughout the film as she cares for mothers.

== Reception ==
The film met some criticism with the public due to the graphic nature of the birth scene, but was still shown to avant-garde audiences in New York at Cinema 16 and the inaugural Flaherty Film Seminar in 1953. It met all the requirements of the Health Department for safe birthing and was officially sanctioned for medical audiences due to the birth scene. This meant it could only be shown at private screenings, which included the New York locations, where it would not be fined or censored. Stoney also encouraged the restriction desiring to protect the film&#x27;s subjects and legitimatize the film as a teaching tool. The film was distributed by UNESCO, the World Health Organization, UNICEF, to various other countries, and become widely used in medical school curriculum. The film was also used to promote respect of midwives by doctors and the medical establishment, particularly in countries where the film was demonstrated the United States&#x27; medical establishment wasn&#x27;t afraid to work with midwives. However, the Georgia Department of Public Health provided an accompanying pamphlet with the film stating that the medical profession was not endorsing midwives, seeing them as a &quot;temporary and unfortunate necessity.&quot;

== Preservation ==
In 2002, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film is the subject of a short 2006 article by Christine Dell&#x27;Amore. Photographic stills by Robert Galbraith from the film formed the basis of an exhibition curated by Linda Janet Holmes called &quot;Reclaiming Midwives: Stills from All My Babies,&quot; on display at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of African American History and Culture.

<doc id="165329" wikidata="Q77066" url="?curid=165329" title="Baron Munchausen">
<text>Baron Munchausen (; ) is a fictional German nobleman created by the German writer Rudolf Erich Raspe in his 1785 book &quot;Baron Munchausen&#x27;s Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia&quot;. The character is loosely based on baron Hieronymus Karl Friedrich Freiherr von Münchhausen.

Born in Bodenwerder, Hanover, the real-life Münchhausen fought for the Russian Empire during the Russo-Turkish War of 1735–1739. After retiring in 1760, he became a minor celebrity within German aristocratic circles for telling outrageous tall tales based on his military career. After hearing some of Münchhausen&#x27;s stories, Raspe adapted them anonymously into literary form, first in German as ephemeral magazine pieces and then in English as the 1785 book, which was first published in Oxford by a bookseller named Smith. The book was soon translated into other European languages, including a German version expanded by the poet Gottfried August Bürger. The real-life Münchhausen was deeply upset at the development of a fictional character bearing his name, and threatened legal proceedings against the book&#x27;s publisher. Perhaps fearing a libel suit, Raspe never acknowledged his authorship of the work, which was only established posthumously.

The fictional Baron&#x27;s exploits, narrated in the first person, focus on his impossible achievements as a sportsman, soldier, and traveller; for instance: riding on a cannonball, fighting a forty-foot crocodile, and travelling to the Moon. Intentionally comedic, the stories play on the absurdity and inconsistency of Munchausen&#x27;s claims, and contain an undercurrent of social satire. The earliest illustrations of the character, perhaps created by Raspe himself, depict Munchausen as slim and youthful, although later illustrators have depicted him as an older man, and have added the sharply beaked nose and twirled moustache that have become part of the character&#x27;s definitive visual representation. Raspe&#x27;s book was a major international success, becoming the core text for numerous English, continental European, and American editions that were expanded and rewritten by other writers. The book in its various revised forms remained widely read throughout the 19th century, especially in editions for young readers.

Versions of the fictional Baron have appeared on stage, screen, radio, and television, as well as in other literary works. Though the Baron Munchausen stories are no longer well known in many English-speaking countries, they are still popular in continental Europe. The character has inspired numerous memorials and museums, and several medical conditions and other concepts are named after him.

==Historical figure==
Hieronymus Karl Friedrich von Münchhausen was born on 11 May 1720 in Bodenwerder, Hanover. He was born into the &quot;Münchhausen family&quot;, an aristocratic family from Brunswick-Lüneburg. The branch to which he belonged had landed estates in Rinteln and Bodenwerder and belonged to the &quot;Black Line&quot; of the family which was first mentioned in 1183. During his lifetime, his father&#x27;s second cousin, Gerlach Adolph von Münchhausen (1688–1770), was considered the most important representative of the family; He served as the Hanoverian Prime Minister under George II of Great Britain and initiated the founding of the University of Göttingen which he supervised as a curator.

At a young age, Hieronymus von Münchhausen served as a page in the court of Duke Anthony Ulrich of Brunswick, following the duke to the Russian Empire during the Russo-Turkish War of 1737–1739. The duke&#x27;s wife Anna Leopoldovna became regent of Russia in 1740–1741 for their newborn son Emperor Ivan VI. Münchhausen was appointed as a cornet in the Brunswick Cuirassiers in 1739, an Imperial Russian Army cavalry regiment. On 27 November 1740, Münchhausen was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. Though he was stationed in Riga, Münchhausen participated in two military campaigns against the Ottoman Empire in 1740 and 1741. However, after the overthrow of the Brunswick ducal family in Russia in 1741, his career stagnated and further promotion to captain (&quot;rotmistr&quot;) took a whole decade - until 1750 - to arrive. The garrison city of Riga became his main place of residence during these years. In 1744, he married Jacobine von Dunten (1725-1790), the daughter of a Baltic knight. The marriage remained childless. These years in Riga probably influenced his skills as a storyteller, because in the Baltic German noble circles gentlemen tended to tell imaginative stories about hunting or war experiences.
In 1760, he retired and settled down on his estates in Bodenwerder to live as a landowner and &quot;Freiherr&quot;, remaining there until his death in 1797. It was during this period of his life, especially at dinners he would host for local aristocrats, that Münchhausen developed a reputation as an imaginative storyteller, creating witty and highly exaggerated accounts of his military career in Russia. Over the ensuing decades, his storytelling abilities gained such renown that he frequently received visits from travelling noblemen wishing to hear his tales. One guest described Münchhausen as telling his stories &quot;cavalierly, indeed with military emphasis, yet without any concession to the whimsicality of the man of the world; describing his adventures as one would incidents which were in the natural course of events&quot;. However, rather than being considered a liar, Münchhausen was seen as an honest man. As another contemporary put it, Münchhausen&#x27;s unbelievable narratives were designed not to deceive, but &quot;to ridicule the disposition for the marvellous which he observed in some of his acquaintances&quot;.

Jacobine von Dunten died in 1790. In January 1794, Münchhausen married Bernardine Friederike Louise Brunsich von Brunn (1773-1839), a woman who was fifty-seven years his junior. Von Brunn reportedly became ill soon after the marriage and spent the summer of 1794 in the spa town of Bad Pyrmont, although contemporary gossip claimed that she spent her time there dancing and flirting. She gave birth to a daughter, Maria Wilhemina, on 16 February 1795, nine months after her summer trip. Münchhausen filed an official complaint that the child was not his, and spent the last years of his life in divorce proceedings and alimony litigation. Münchhausen died childless on 22 February 1797.

==Fictionalization==

The fictionalized character was created by a German writer, scientist, and con artist, Rudolf Erich Raspe. Raspe probably met Hieronymus von Münchhausen while studying at the University of Göttingen, and may even have been invited to dine with him at the mansion at Bodenwerder. Raspe&#x27;s later career mixed writing and scientific scholarship with theft and swindling; when the German police issued advertisements for his arrest in 1775, he fled continental Europe and settled in England.

In his native German language, Raspe wrote a collection of anecdotes inspired by Münchhausen&#x27;s tales, calling the collection &quot;M-h-s-nsche Geschichten&quot; (&quot;M-h-s-n Stories&quot;). It remains unclear how much of Raspe&#x27;s material comes directly from the Baron, but the majority of the stories are derived from older sources, including Heinrich Bebel&#x27;s &quot;Facetiæ&quot; (1508) and Samuel Gotthold Lange&#x27;s &quot;Deliciæ Academicæ&quot; (1765). &quot;M-h-s-nsche Geschichten&quot; appeared as a feature in the eighth issue of the &quot;Vade mecum für lustige Leute&quot; (&quot;Handbook for Fun-loving People&quot;), a Berlin humor magazine, in 1781. Raspe published a sequel, &quot;Noch zwei M-Lügen&quot; (&quot;Two more M-Fibs&quot;), in the tenth issue of the same magazine in 1783. The hero and narrator of these stories was identified only as &quot;M-h-s-n&quot;, keeping Raspe&#x27;s inspiration partly obscured while still allowing knowledgeable German readers to make the connection to Münchhausen. Raspe&#x27;s name did not appear at all.

In 1785, while supervising mines at Dolcoath in Cornwall, Raspe adapted the &quot;Vade mecum&quot; anecdotes into a short English-language book, this time identifying the narrator of the book as &quot;Baron Munchausen&quot;. Other than the anglicization of Münchhausen to &quot;Munchausen&quot;, Raspe this time made no attempt to hide the identity of the man who had inspired him, though he still withheld his own name.

This English edition, the first version of the text in which Munchausen appeared as a fully developed literary character, had a circuitous publication history. It first appeared anonymously as &quot;Baron Munchausen&#x27;s Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia&quot;, a 49-page book in 12mo size, published in Oxford by the bookseller Smith in late 1785 and sold for a shilling. A second edition released early the following year, retitled &quot;Singular Travels, Campaigns, Voyages, and Sporting Adventures of Baron Munnikhouson, commonly pronounced Munchausen&quot;, added five more stories and four illustrations; though the book was still anonymous, the new text was probably by Raspe, and the illustrations may have been his work as well.

By May 1786, Raspe no longer had control over the book, which was taken over by a different publisher, G. Kearsley. Kearsley, intending the book for a higher-class audience than the original editions had been, commissioned extensive additions and revisions from other hands, including new stories, twelve new engravings, and much rewriting of Raspe&#x27;s prose. This third edition was sold at two shillings, twice the price of the original, as &quot;Gulliver Revived, or the Singular Travels, Campaigns, Voyages, and Adventures of Baron Munikhouson, commonly pronounced Munchausen&quot;.

Kearsley&#x27;s version was a marked popular success. Over the next few years, the publishing house issued further editions in quick succession, adding still more non-Raspe material along the way; even the full-length &quot;Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot;, again not by Raspe and originally published in 1792 by a rival printer, was quickly subsumed into the body of stories. In the process of revision, Raspe&#x27;s prose style was heavily modified; instead of his conversational language and sportsmanlike turns of phrase, Kearsley&#x27;s writers opted for a blander and more formal tone imitating Augustan prose. Most ensuing English-language editions, including even the major editions produced by Thomas Seccombe in 1895 and F. J. Harvey Darton in 1930, reproduce one of the rewritten Kearsley versions rather than Raspe&#x27;s original text.

At least ten editions or translations of the book appeared before Raspe&#x27;s death in 1794. Translations of the book into French, Spanish, and German were published in 1786. The text reached the United States in 1805, expanded to include American topical satire by an anonymous Federalist writer, probably Thomas Green Fessenden.

The first German translation, &quot;Wunderbare Reisen zu Wasser und Lande&quot;, was made by the German Romantic poet Gottfried August Bürger. Bürger&#x27;s text is a close translation of Smith&#x27;s second edition, but also includes an interpolated story, based on a German legend called &quot;The Six Wonderful Servants&quot;. Two new engravings were added to illustrate the interpolated material. The German version of the stories proved to be even more popular than the English one. A second German edition in 1788 included heavily altered material from an expanded Kearsley edition, and an original German sequel, &quot;Nachtrag zu den wunderbaren Reisen zu Wasser und Lande&quot;, was published in 1789. After these publications, the English and Continental versions of the Raspe text continued to diverge, following increasingly different traditions of included material.

Raspe, probably for fear of a libel suit from the real-life Baron von Münchhausen, never admitted his authorship of the book. It was often credited to Bürger, sometimes with an accompanying rumor that the real-life Baron von Münchhausen had met Bürger in Pyrmont and dictated the entire work to him. Another rumor, which circulated widely soon after the German translation was published, claimed that it was a competitive collaboration by three University of Göttingen scholars—Bürger, Abraham Gotthelf Kästner, and Georg Christoph Lichtenberg—with each of the three trying to outdo one another by writing the most unbelievable tale. The scholar Johann Georg Meusel correctly credited Raspe for the core text, but mistakenly asserted that Raspe had written it in German and that an anonymous translator was responsible for the English version. Raspe&#x27;s authorship was finally proven in 1824 by Bürger&#x27;s biographer, Karl Reinhard.

In the first few years after publication, German readers widely assumed that the real-life Baron von Münchhausen was responsible for the stories. According to witnesses, Münchhausen was deeply angry that the book had dragged his name into public consciousness and insulted his honor as a nobleman. Although these publications made him world famous, they earned him a reputation as a &quot;lying baron&quot; and – in his eyes – exposed him to ridicule. The anger about this, along with the late marital adventure and subsequent ruin, plagued him for the rest of his years. Münchhausen became a recluse, refusing to host parties or tell any more stories, and he attempted without success to bring legal proceedings against Bürger and the publisher of the translation.

===Publication history===
The following tables summarize the early publication history of Raspe&#x27;s text, from 1785 to 1800. Unless otherwise referenced, information in the tables comes from the Munchausen bibliography established by John Patrick Carswell.


==Fictional character==

The fictional Baron Munchausen is a braggart soldier, most strongly defined by his comically exaggerated boasts about his own adventures. All of the stories in Raspe&#x27;s book are told in first-person narrative, with a prefatory note explaining that &quot;the Baron is supposed to relate these extraordinary Adventures over his Bottle, when surrounded by his Friends&quot;. The Baron&#x27;s stories imply him to be a superhuman figure who spends most of his time either getting out of absurd predicaments or indulging in equally absurd moments of gentle mischief. In some of his best-known stories, the Baron rides a cannonball, travels to the Moon, is swallowed by a giant fish in the Mediterranean Sea, saves himself from drowning by pulling up on his own hair, fights a forty-foot crocodile, enlists a wolf to pull his sleigh, and uses laurel tree branches to fix his horse when the animal is accidentally cut in two.

In the stories he narrates, the Baron is shown as a calm, rational man, describing what he experiences with simple objectivity; absurd happenings elicit, at most, mild surprise from him, and he shows serious doubt about any unlikely events he has not witnessed himself. The resulting narrative effect is an ironic tone, encouraging skepticism in the reader and marked by a running undercurrent of subtle social satire. In addition to his fearlessness when hunting and fighting, he is suggested to be a debonair, polite gentleman given to moments of gallantry, with a scholarly penchant for knowledge, a tendency to be pedantically accurate about details in his stories, and a deep appreciation for food and drink of all kinds. The Baron also provides a solid geographical and social context for his narratives, peppering them with topical allusions and satire about recent events; indeed, many of the references in Raspe&#x27;s original text are to historical incidents in the real-life Münchhausen&#x27;s military career.

Because the feats the Baron describes are overtly implausible, they are easily recognizable as fiction, with a strong implication that the Baron is a liar. Whether he expects his audience to believe him varies from version to version; in Raspe&#x27;s original 1785 text, he simply narrates his stories without further comment, but in the later extended versions he is insistent that he is telling the truth. In any case, the Baron appears to believe every word of his own stories, no matter how internally inconsistent they become, and he usually appears tolerantly indifferent to any disbelief he encounters in others.

Illustrators of the Baron stories have included Thomas Rowlandson, Alfred Crowquill, George Cruikshank, Ernst Ludwig Riepenhausen, Theodor Hosemann, Adolf Schrödter, Gustave Doré, William Strang, W. Heath Robinson, and Ronald Searle. The Finnish-American cartoonist Klaus Nordling featured the Baron in a weekly &quot;Baron Munchausen&quot; comic strip from 1935 to 1937, and in 1962, Raspe&#x27;s text was adapted for &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; #146 (British series), with both interior and cover art by the British cartoonist Denis Gifford.

In the first published illustrations, which may have been drawn by Raspe himself, the Baron appears slim and youthful. For the 1792 &quot;Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot;, an anonymous artist drew the Baron as a dignified but tired old soldier whose face is marred by injuries from his adventures; this illustration remained the standard portrait of the Baron for about seventy years, and its imagery was echoed in Cruikshank&#x27;s depictions of the character. Doré, illustrating a Théophile Gautier &quot;fils&quot; translation in 1862, retained the sharply beaked nose and twirled moustache from the 1792 portrait, but gave the Baron a healthier and more affable appearance; the Doré Baron became the definitive visual representation for the character.

The relationship between the real and fictional Barons is complex. On the one hand, the fictional Baron Munchausen can be easily distinguished from the historical figure Hieronymus von Münchhausen; the character is so separate from his namesake that at least one critic, the writer W. L. George, concluded that the namesake&#x27;s identity was irrelevant to the general reader, and Richard Asher named Munchausen syndrome using the anglicized spelling so that the disorder would reference the character rather than the real person. On the other hand, Münchhausen remains strongly connected to the character he inspired, and is still nicknamed the &quot;Lügenbaron&quot; (&quot;Baron of Lies&quot;) in German. As the Munchausen researcher Bernhard Wiebel has said, &quot;These two barons are the same and they are not the same.&quot;

==Critical and popular reception==

Reviewing the first edition of Raspe&#x27;s book in December 1785, a writer in &quot;The Critical Review&quot; commented appreciatively:

At around the same time, &quot;English Review&quot; was less approving: &quot;We do not understand how a collection of lies can be called a satire on lying, any more than the adventures of a woman of pleasure can be called a satire on fornication.&quot;

W. L. George described the fictional Baron as a &quot;comic giant&quot; of literature, describing his boasts as &quot;splendid, purposeless lie[s] born of the joy of life&quot;. Théophile Gautier &quot;fils&quot; highlighted that the Baron&#x27;s adventures are endowed with an &quot;absurd logic pushed to the extreme and which backs away from nothing&quot;. According to an interview, Jules Verne relished reading the Baron stories as a child, and used them as inspiration for his own adventure novels. Thomas Seccombe commented that &quot;Munchausen has undoubtedly achieved [a permanent place in literature] ... The Baron&#x27;s notoriety is universal, his character proverbial, and his name as familiar as that of Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, or Robinson Crusoe.&quot;

Steven T. Byington wrote that &quot;Munchausen&#x27;s modest seat in the Valhalla of classic literature is undisputed&quot;, comparing the stories to American tall tales and concluding that the Baron is &quot;the patriarch, the perfect model, the fadeless fragrant flower, of liberty from accuracy&quot;. The folklore writer Alvin Schwartz cited the Baron stories as one of the most important influences on the American tall tale tradition. In a 2012 study of the Baron, the literary scholar Sarah Tindal Kareem noted that &quot;Munchausen embodies, in his deadpan presentation of absurdities, the novelty of fictionality [and] the sophistication of aesthetic illusion&quot;, adding that the additions to Raspe&#x27;s text made by Kearsley and others tend to mask these ironic literary qualities by emphasizing that the Baron is lying.

By the beginning of the 19th century, Kearsley&#x27;s phenomenally popular version of Raspe&#x27;s book had spread to abridged chapbook editions for young readers, who soon became the main audience for the stories. The book, especially in its adaptations for children, remained widely popular throughout the century. It was translated into nearly all languages spoken in Europe; Robert Southey referred to it as &quot;a book which everybody knows, because all boys read it&quot;. Notable later translations include Gautier&#x27;s French rendering and Korney Chukovsky&#x27;s popular Russian adaptation. By the 1850s, &quot;Munchausen&quot; had come into slang use as a verb meaning &quot;to tell extravagantly untruthful pseudo-autobiographical stories&quot;. Robert Chambers, in an 1863 almanac, cited the iconic 1792 illustration of the Baron by asking rhetorically:

Though Raspe&#x27;s book is no longer widely read by English-speakers, the Munchausen stories remain popular in Europe, especially in Germany and in Russia.

==In culture==
===Literature===
As well as the many augmented and adapted editions of Raspe&#x27;s text, the fictional Baron has occasionally appeared in other standalone works. In 1838–39, Karl Leberecht Immermann published the long novel &quot;Münchhausen: Eine Geschichte in Arabesken&quot; (&quot;Münchhausen: A History of Arabesques&quot;) as an homage to the character, and Adolf Ellissen&#x27;s &quot;Munchausens Lügenabenteur&quot;, an elaborate expansion of the stories, appeared in 1846.

In his 1886 philosophical treatise &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;, Friedrich Nietzsche uses one of the Baron&#x27;s adventures, the one in which he rescues himself from a swamp, as a metaphor for belief in complete metaphysical free will; Nietzsche calls this belief an attempt &quot;to pull oneself up into existence by the hair, out of the swamps of nothingness&quot;. Another philosopher, Ludwig Wittgenstein, makes reference to the same adventure in a diary entry from 1937, recording a remark he made in a dream: &quot;But let us talk in our mother tongue, and not believe that we must pull ourselves out of the swamp by our own hair; that was – thank God – only a dream, after all. We are only supposed to remove misunderstandings, after all.&quot;

In the late 19th century, the Baron appeared as a character in John Kendrick Bangs&#x27;s comic novels &quot;A House-Boat on the Styx&quot;, &quot;Pursuit of the House-Boat&quot;, and &quot;The Enchanted Type-Writer&quot;. Shortly after, in 1901, Bangs published &quot;Mr. Munchausen&quot;, a collection of new Munchausen stories, closely following the style and humor of the original tales. Hugo Gernsback&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Baron Münchhausen&#x27;s New Scientific Adventures&quot;, put the Baron character in a science fiction setting; the novel was serialized in &quot;The Electrical Experimenter&quot; from May 1915 to February 1917.

Pierre Henri Cami&#x27;s character Baron de Crac, a French soldier and courtier under Louis XV, is an imitation of the Baron Munchausen stories. In 1998, the British game designer James Wallis used the Baron character to create a multi-player storytelling game, &quot;The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot;, in which players improvise Munchausen-like first-person stories while overcoming objections and other interruptions from opponents. The American writer Peter David had the Baron narrate an original short story, &quot;Diego and the Baron&quot;, in 2018.

===Stage and audio===

Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre produced the pantomime &quot;Baron Munchausen; or, Harlequin&#x27;s Travels&quot; in London in 1795, starring the actor-singer-caricaturist Robert Dighton as the Baron; another pantomime based on the Raspe text, &quot;Harlequin Munchausen, or the Fountain of Love&quot;, was produced in London in 1818. Herbert Eulenberg made the Baron the main character of a 1900 play, &quot;Münchhausen&quot;, and the Expressionist writer Walter Hasenclever turned the stories into a comedy, &quot;Münchhausen&quot;, in 1934. Grigori Gorin used the Baron as the hero of his 1976 play &quot;That Very Munchausen&quot;; a film version was made in 1980. &quot;Baron Prášil&quot;, a Czech musical about the Baron, opened in 2010 in Prague. The following year, the National Black Light Theatre of Prague toured the United Kingdom with a nonmusical production of &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot;.

In 1932, the comedy writer Billy Wells adapted Baron Munchausen for a radio comedy routine starring the comedians Jack Pearl and Cliff Hall. In the routine, Pearl&#x27;s Baron would relate his unbelievable experiences in a thick German accent to Hall&#x27;s &quot;straight man&quot; character, Charlie. When Charlie had had enough and expressed disbelief, the Baron would invariably retort: &quot;Vass &quot;you&quot; dere, Sharlie?&quot; The line became a popular and much-quoted catchphrase, and by early 1933 &quot;The Jack Pearl Show&quot; was the second most popular series on American radio (after Eddie Cantor&#x27;s program). Pearl attempted to adapt his portrayal to film in &quot;Meet the Baron&quot; in 1933, playing a modern character mistaken for the Baron, but the film was not a success. Pearl&#x27;s popularity gradually declined between 1933 and 1937, though he attempted to revive the Baron character several times before ending his last radio series in 1951.

For a 1972 Caedmon Records recording of some of the stories, Peter Ustinov voiced the Baron. A review in &quot;The Reading Teacher&quot; noted that Ustinov&#x27;s portrayal highlighted &quot;the braggadocio personality of the Baron&quot;, with &quot;self-adulation ... plainly discernible in the intonational innuendo&quot;.

===Film===

The early French filmmaker Georges Méliès, who greatly admired the Baron Munchausen stories, filmed &quot;Baron Munchausen&#x27;s Dream&quot; in 1911. Méliès&#x27;s short silent film, which has little in common with the Raspe text, follows a sleeping Baron through a surrealistic succession of intoxication-induced dreams. Méliès may also have used the Baron&#x27;s journey to the moon as an inspiration for his well-known 1902 film &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;. In the late 1930s, he planned to collaborate with the Dada artist Hans Richter on a new film version of the Baron stories, but the project was left unfinished at his death in 1938. Richter attempted to complete it the following year, taking on Jacques Prévert, Jacques Brunius, and Maurice Henry as screenwriters, but the beginning of the Second World War put a permanent halt to the production.

The French animator Émile Cohl produced a version of the stories using silhouette cutout animation in 1913; other animated versions were produced by Richard Felgenauer in Germany in 1920, and by Paul Peroff in the United States in 1929. Colonel Heeza Liar, the protagonist of the first animated cartoon series in cinema history, was created by John Randolph Bray in 1913 as an amalgamation of the Baron and Teddy Roosevelt. The Italian director Paolo Azzurri filmed &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot; in 1914, and the British director F. Martin Thornton made a short silent film featuring the Baron, &quot;The New Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot;, the following year. In 1940, the Czech director Martin Frič filmed &quot;Baron Prášil&quot;, starring the comic actor Vlasta Burian as a 20th-century descendant of the Baron.

For the German film studio U.F.A. GmbH&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 1943, Joseph Goebbels hired the filmmaker Josef von Báky to direct &quot;Münchhausen&quot;, a big-budget color film about the Baron. David Stewart Hull describes Hans Albers&#x27;s Baron as &quot;jovial but somewhat sinister&quot;, while Tobias Nagle writes that Albers imparts &quot;a male and muscular zest for action and testosterone-driven adventure&quot;. A German musical comedy, &quot;Münchhausen in Afrika&quot;, made as a vehicle for the Austrian singing star Peter Alexander, appeared in 1957. Karel Zeman&#x27;s 1961 Czech film &quot;The Fabulous Baron Munchausen&quot; commented on the Baron&#x27;s adventures from a contemporary perspective, highlighting the importance of the poetic imagination to scientific achievement; Zeman&#x27;s stylized &quot;mise-en-scène&quot;, based on Doré&#x27;s illustrations for the book, combined animation with live-action actors, including Miloš Kopecký as the Baron.

In the Soviet Union, in 1929, Daniil Cherkes released a cartoon, &quot;Adventures of Munchausen&quot;. Soviet Soyuzmultfilm released a 16-minute stop-motion animation &quot;Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot; in 1967, directed by Anatoly Karanovich. Another Soviet animated version was produced as a series of short films, &quot;Munchausen&#x27;s Adventures&quot;, in 1973 and 1974. The French animator Jean Image filmed &quot;&quot; in 1979, and followed it with a 1984 sequel, &quot;Moon Madness&quot;.

Oleg Yankovsky appeared as the Baron in the 1979 Russian television film &quot;The Very Same Munchhausen&quot;, directed by Mark Zakharov from Grigori Gorin&#x27;s screenplay, produced and released by Mosfilm. The film, a satirical commentary on Soviet censorship and social mores, imagines an ostracized Baron attempting to prove the truth of his adventures in a disbelieving and conformity-driven world.

In 1988, Terry Gilliam adapted the Raspe stories into a lavish Hollywood film, &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot;, with the British stage actor and director John Neville in the lead role. Roger Ebert, in his review of the film, described Neville&#x27;s Baron as a man who &quot;seems sensible and matter-of-fact, as anyone would if they had spent a lifetime growing accustomed to the incredible&quot;.

The German actor Jan Josef Liefers starred in a 2012 two-part television film titled &quot;&quot;; according to a &quot;Spiegel Online&quot; review, his characterization of the Baron strongly resembled Johnny Depp&#x27;s performance as Jack Sparrow in the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; film series.

==Legacy==
===Memorials===

In 2004, a fan club calling itself Munchausen&#x27;s Grandchildren was founded in the Russian city of Kaliningrad (formerly Königsberg). The club&#x27;s early activities included identifying &quot;historical proofs&quot; of the fictional Baron&#x27;s travels through Königsberg, such as a jackboot supposedly belonging to the Baron and a sperm whale skeleton said to be that of the whale in whose belly the Baron was trapped.

On 18 June 2005, to celebrate the 750th anniversary of Kaliningrad, a monument to the Baron was unveiled as a gift from Bodenwerder, portraying the Baron&#x27;s cannonball ride. Bodenwerder sports a Munchausen monument in front of its Town Hall, as well as a Munchausen museum including a large collection of illustrated editions of the stories. Another Munchausen Museum (&quot;Minhauzena Muzejs&quot;) exists in Duntes Muiža, Liepupe parish, Latvia, home of the real Baron&#x27;s first wife; the couple had lived in the town for six years, before moving back to the baronial estate in Hanover. In 2005, to mark the real-life Baron&#x27;s 285th birthday, the National Bank of Latvia issued a commemorative silver coin.

===Nomenclature===
In 1951, the British physician Richard Asher published an article in &quot;The Lancet&quot; describing patients whose factitious disorders led them to lie about their own states of health. Asher proposed to call the disorder &quot;Munchausen&#x27;s syndrome&quot;, commenting: &quot;Like the famous Baron von Munchausen, the persons affected have always travelled widely; and their stories, like those attributed to him, are both dramatic and untruthful. Accordingly, the syndrome is respectfully dedicated to the baron, and named after him&quot;. The disease is now usually referred to as Munchausen syndrome. The name has spawned two other coinages: Munchausen syndrome by proxy, in which illness is feigned by caretakers rather than patients, and Munchausen by Internet, in which illness is feigned online.

In 1968, Hans Albert coined the term Münchhausen trilemma to describe the philosophical problem inherent in having to derive conclusions from premises; those premises have to be derived from still other premises, and so on forever, leading to an infinite regress interruptible only by circular logic or dogmatism. The problem is named after the similarly paradoxical story in which the Baron saves himself from being drowned in a swamp by pulling on his own hair. The same story also inspired the mathematical term Munchausen number, coined by Daan van Berkel in 2009 to describe numbers whose digits, when raised to their own powers, can be added together to form the number itself (for example, 3435 = 33 + 44 + 33 + 55).

Subclass ATU1889 of the Aarne–Thompson–Uther classification system, a standard index of folklore, was named &quot;Münchhausen Tales&quot; in tribute to the stories. In 1994, a main belt asteroid was named 14014 Münchhausen in honor of both the real and the fictional Baron.

<text>The Black Stallion is a 1979 American adventure film based on the 1941 classic children&#x27;s novel of the same name by Walter Farley. The film starts in 1946, five years after the book was published. It tells the story of Alec Ramsey, a boy who is shipwrecked on a deserted island with a wild Arabian stallion that he befriends. After being rescued, they are set on entering a race challenging two champion horses.

The film is adapted by Melissa Mathison, Jeanne Rosenberg, and William D. Wittliff. It was directed by Carroll Ballard and stars Kelly Reno in his film debut, Teri Garr, Hoyt Axton, Michael Higgins and Mickey Rooney with the Arabian horse Cass Ole playing the eponymous Black Stallion. The film features music by Carmine Coppola, the father of Hollywood producer Francis Ford Coppola, who is credited as executive producer.

In 2002, &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1946, Alec Ramsey is travelling by steamer off the coast of North Africa, where he sees a wild black stallion being forced onto the boat. Captivated, Alec sneaks to the horse&#x27;s stall to feed him some sugar cubes, but he is caught by the horse&#x27;s supposed owner, who tells him in Arabic to stay away from &quot;Shetan&quot;.

Later, his father shows Alec his winnings from a card game and gives him a pocket knife and a small statue of Bucephalus, telling the story of how Alexander the Great became Bucephalus&#x27;s master. Later that night, Alec is thrown out of his bunk during a storm. The ship is engulfed in flames and is sinking. In the chaos, Alec makes his way to the black stallion and frees him. The horse then jumps into the sea. Alec is thrown overboard by the waves and grabs the ropes of the stallion&#x27;s restraints just as the ship explodes, rendering him unconscious.

Alec wakes on the shore of a deserted island and starts to explore. He finds the stallion caught in his restraints. With his knife, Alec frees the stallion again. As Alec suddenly faces a cobra, The Black kills the snake, only to run off.

Alec decides to get closer to the horse and offers him some seaweed. The hungry stallion finds himself unable to resist, and the two become inseparable. After many failed attempts, Alec rides the stallion, and they travel the beaches, united as one. One day, a fishing ship arrives, rescuing the two.

Back in America, Alec is given a hero&#x27;s welcome. The Black has a temporary home in his back yard, but a garbage man startles the horse, who races off. The next day, Alec finds the stallion in the barn of Henry Dailey, a retired racehorse jockey. Alec arranges for The Black to stay at the barn.

When Alec wonders how fast the horse is, he and Henry decide to train The Black for the racetrack, while Henry teaches Alec how to be a jockey. The Black surprises Henry with his speed. Henry starts planning to get The Black into a match race between the country&#x27;s current two champions. To do that, he sets up a secret demonstration at night where a prominent reporter can witness his speed. The news spreads about the &quot;mystery horse&quot; and The Black is entered into the race. At first Alec&#x27;s mother is totally against him racing the Black Stallion in a race, because of the dangers involved. However, after Alec tearfully explains to his mother the secrecy, does the mother relent.

Before the horses enter the starting gate, The Black gets into a fight with one of his opponents, wounding his leg. Alec does not see the injury until he is in the gate. As he begins to dismount, the bell rings and the horses take off. Alec desperately stays on his horse while trying to stop him. He falls far behind, but The Black will not stop. Alec starts urging him to run, and The Black catches his opponents to win.

==Cast==
===Horses===
Cass Ole, a champion Arabian stallion, was featured in most of the movie&#x27;s scenes, with Fae Jur, another black Arabian stallion, being his main double. Fae Jur&#x27;s main scene is the one where Alec is trying to gain the trust of The Black on the beach. Two other stunt doubles were used for running, fighting, and swimming scenes.

El Mokhtar, an Egyptian Arabian racehorse, was the producers&#x27; first choice to portray The Black, but they were unable to secure his services for the film from his owners, who declined any offers. He does appear in &quot;The Black Stallion Returns&quot;, alongside Cass Ole, by which time the studio bought out the syndicate of owners to secure El Mokhtar&#x27;s services.

Napoleon was portrayed by Junior, that previously appeared in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot; as Trooper, Niedermeyer&#x27;s horse.

<doc id="165331" wikidata="Q2630352" url="?curid=165331" title="Kinescope">
<text>Kinescope , shortened to kine , also known as telerecording in Britain, is a recording of a television program on motion picture film directly through a lens focused on the screen of a video monitor. The process was pioneered during the 1940s for the preservation, re-broadcasting, and sale of television programs before the introduction of quadruplex videotape, which from 1956 eventually superseded the use of kinescopes for all of these purposes. Kinescopes were the only practical way to preserve live television broadcasts prior to videotape.

Typically, the term can refer to the process itself, the equipment used for the procedure (a movie camera mounted in front of a video monitor, and synchronized to the monitor&#x27;s scanning rate), or a film made using the process. Film recorders are similar, but record source material from a computer system instead of a television broadcast. A telecine is the inverse device, used to show film directly on television.

The term originally referred to the cathode-ray tube (CRT) used in television receivers, as named by inventor Vladimir K. Zworykin in 1929. Hence, the recordings were known in full as kinescope films or kinescope recordings. RCA was granted a trademark for the term (for its CRT) in 1932; it voluntarily released the term to the public domain in 1950.

== History ==
The General Electric laboratories in Schenectady, New York, experimented with making still and motion picture records of television images in 1931.

There is anecdotal evidence that the BBC experimented with filming the output of the television monitor before its television service was suspended in 1939 due to the outbreak of World War II. A BBC executive, Cecil Madden, recalled filming a production of &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; in this way, only for film director Alexander Korda to order the burning of the negative as he owned the film rights to the book, which he felt had been infringed. While there is no written record of any BBC Television production of &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; during 1936–1939, the incident is dramatized in Jack Rosenthal&#x27;s 1986 television play &quot;The Fools on the Hill&quot;.

Some of the surviving live transmissions of the Nazi German television station Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow, dating as far back as the 1930s, were recorded by pointing a 35 mm camera to a receiver&#x27;s screen; although, most surviving Nazi live television programs, such as the 1936 Summer Olympics (not to be confused with the cinematic footage made during the same event by Leni Riefenstahl for her film &quot;Olympia&quot;), a number of Nuremberg Rallies, or official state visits (such as Benito Mussolini&#x27;s), were shot directly on 35 mm instead and transmitted over the air as a television signal, with only two minutes&#x27; delay from the original event, by means of the so-called &quot;Zwischenfilmverfahren&quot; (see intermediate film system) from an early outside broadcast van on the site.

According to a 1949 film produced by RCA, silent films had been made of early experimental telecasts during the 1930s. The films were produced by aiming a camera at television monitors – at a speed of eight frames per second, resulting in somewhat jerky reproductions of the images. By the mid-1940s, RCA and NBC were refining the filming process and including sound; the images were less jerky but still somewhat fuzzy.

By early 1946, television cameras were being attached to American guided missiles to aid in their remote steering. Films were made of the television images they transmitted for further evaluation of the target and the missile&#x27;s performance.

The first known surviving example of the telerecording process in Britain is from October 1947, showing the singer Adelaide Hall performing at the RadiOlympia event. Hall sings &quot;Chi-Baba, Chi-Baba (My Bambino Go to Sleep)&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Give You Anything But Love&quot;, as well as accompanying herself on ukulele and dancing. When the show was originally broadcast on BBC TV it was 60 minutes in length and also included performances from Winifred Atwell, Evelyn Dove, Cyril Blake and his Calypso Band, Edric Connor and Mable Lee, and was produced by Eric Fawcett. The six-minute footage of Miss Hall is all that survives of the show.

From the following month, the wedding of Princess Elizabeth to Prince Philip also survives, as do various early 1950s productions such as &quot;It is Midnight, Dr Schweitzer&quot;, &quot;The Lady from the Sea&quot; and the opening two episodes of &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, although in varying degrees of quality. A complete 7-hour set of telerecordings of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s 1953 coronation also exists.

=== Worldwide program distribution ===

In the era before satellite communications, kinescopes were used to distribute live events such as a royal wedding as quickly as possible to other countries of the Commonwealth that had started a television service. A Royal Air Force aircraft would fly the telerecording from the UK to Canada, where it would be broadcast over the whole North American network.

Prior to the introduction of videotape in 1956, kinescopes were the only way to record television broadcasts, or to distribute network television programs that were broadcast live from originating cities to stations not connected to the network, or to stations that wished to show a program at a time different than the network broadcast. Although the quality was less than desirable, television programs of all types from prestigious dramas to regular news shows were handled in this manner.

Even after the introduction of videotape, the BBC and the ITV companies made black and white kinescopes of selected programs for international sales and continued to do so until the early 1970s by which time programs were being videotaped in color. Most, if not all, recordings from the 405-line era have long since been lost as have many from the introduction of 625-line video to the early days of color. Consequently, the majority of British shows that still exist before the introduction of color, and a number thereafter, do so in the form of these telerecordings. A handful of shows, including some episodes of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and most of the first series of &quot;Adam Adamant Lives!&quot;, were deliberately telerecorded for ease of editing rather than being videotaped.

=== Eastman Television Recording Camera ===

In September 1947, Eastman Kodak introduced the Eastman Television Recording Camera, in cooperation with DuMont Laboratories and NBC, for recording images from a television screen under the trademark &quot;Kinephoto&quot;. NBC, CBS, and DuMont set up their main kinescope recording facilities in New York City, while ABC chose Chicago. By 1951, NBC and CBS were each shipping out some 1,000 16 mm kinescope prints each week to their affiliates across the United States, and by 1955 that number had increased to 2,500 per week for CBS. By 1954 the television industry&#x27;s film consumption surpassed that of all of the Hollywood studios combined.

=== Hot kinescope ===

After the network of coaxial cable and microwave relays carrying programs to the West Coast was completed in September 1951, CBS and NBC instituted a &quot;hot kinescope&quot; process in 1952, where shows being performed in New York were transmitted west, filmed on two kinescope machines in 35 mm negative and 16 mm reversal film (the latter for backup protection) in Los Angeles, rushed to film processing, and then transmitted from Los Angeles three hours later for broadcast in the Pacific Time Zone. In September 1956, NBC began making color &quot;hot kines&quot; of some of its color programs using a lenticular film process which, unlike color negative film, could be processed rapidly using standard black-and-white methods. They were called &quot;hot kines&quot; because the film reels being delivered from the lab were still warm from the developing process.

=== Double system editing ===

Even after the introduction of quadruplex videotape machines in 1956 removed the need for &quot;hot kines&quot;, the television networks continued to use kinescopes in the &quot;double system&quot; method of videotape editing. It was impossible to slow or freeze frame a videotape at that time, so the unedited tape would be copied to a kinescope, and edited conventionally. The edited kinescope print was then used to conform the videotape master. More than 300 videotaped network series and specials used this method over a 12-year period, including the fast-paced &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;.

== Alternatives to kinescoping ==

With the variable quality of Kinescopes, networks looked towards alternative methods to replace them with a higher degree of quality.

=== Change to 35 mm film broadcasts ===
Programs originally shot with film cameras (as opposed to kinescopes) were also used in television&#x27;s early years, although they were generally considered inferior to the big-production live programs because of their lower budgets and loss of immediacy.

In 1951, the stars and producers of the Hollywood-based television series &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball, decided to film the show directly onto 35 mm film using the three-camera system, instead of broadcasting it live. Normally, a live program originating from Los Angeles would be performed live in the late afternoon for the Eastern Time Zone and seen on a kinescope three hours later in the Pacific Time Zone. But as an article in &quot;American Cinematographer&quot; explained,

The &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; decision introduced reruns to most of the American television audience, and set a pattern for the syndication of TV shows after their network runs.

=== Electronicam ===
The program director of the DuMont Television Network, James L. Caddigan, devised an alternativethe Electronicam. In this, all the studio TV cameras had built-in 35 mm film cameras which shared the same optical path. An Electronicam technician threw switches to mark the film footage electronically, identifying the camera &quot;takes&quot; called by the director. The corresponding film segments from the various cameras then were combined by a film editor to duplicate the live program. The &quot;Classic 39&quot; syndicated episodes of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; were filmed using Electronicam (as well as the daily five-minute syndicated series &quot; Les Paul &amp; Mary Ford At Home&quot; in 1954–55), but with the introduction of a practical videotape recorder only one year away, the Electronicam system never saw widespread use. The DuMont network did not survive into the era of videotape, and in order to gain clearances for its programs, was heavily dependent on kinescopes, which it called Teletranscriptions.

===Electronovision===
Attempts were made for many years to take television images, convert them to film via kinescope, then project them in theatres for paying audiences. In the mid-1960s, Producer/entrepreneur H. William &quot;Bill&quot; Sargent, Jr. used conventional analog Image Orthicon video camera tube units, shooting in the B&amp;W 819-line interlaced 25fps French video standard, using modified high-band quadruplex VTRs to record the signal. The promoters of Electronovision (not to be confused with Electronicam) gave the impression that this was a new system created from scratch, using a high-tech name (and avoiding the word kinescope) to distinguish the process from conventional film photography. Nonetheless, the advances in picture quality were, at the time, a major step ahead. By capturing more than 800 lines of resolution at 25 frame/s, raw tape could be converted to film via kinescope recording with sufficient enhanced resolution to allow big-screen enlargement. The 1960s productions used Marconi image orthicon video cameras, which have a characteristic white glow around black objects (and a corresponding black glow around white objects), which was a defect of the pick-up. Later vidicon and plumbicon video camera tubes produced much cleaner, more accurate pictures.

=== Videotape ===
In 1951, singer Bing Crosby’s company Bing Crosby Enterprises made the first experimental magnetic video recordings; however, the poor picture quality and very high tape speed meant it would be impractical to use. In 1956, Ampex introduced the first commercial Quadruplex videotape recorder, followed in 1958 by a colour model. Offering high quality and instant playback at a much lower cost, Quadruplex tape quickly replaced kinescope as the primary means of recording television broadcasts.

== Decline ==
In the late 1960s, U.S. television networks continued to make kinescopes of their daytime dramas available, many of which still aired live during that time period, for their smaller network affiliates that did not yet have videotape capability but wished to time-shift the network programming. Some of these programs aired up to two weeks after their original dates, particularly in Alaska and Hawaii. Many episodes of programs from the 1960s survive only through kinescoped copies.

In Australia, kinescopes were still being made of some evening news programs as late as 1977, if they were recorded at all. A recording of a 1975 episode of Australian series &quot;This Day Tonight&quot; is listed on the National Archives of Australia website as a kinescope, while surviving episodes of the 1978 drama series &quot;The Truckies&quot; also exist as kinescopes, indicating that the technology was still being used by the ABC at that point.

Until the early 1960s, much of the BBC&#x27;s output, and British television in general, was broadcast live, and entire drama productions were performed live for a second time until recording methods improved. Eventually, telerecordings would be used to preserve a program for repeat showings. In the UK, telerecordings continued to be made after the introduction of commercial broadcast videotape in 1958 as they possessed several distinct advantages. Firstly, they were easier to transport and more durable than videotape. Secondly, they could be used in any country regardless of the television broadcasting standard, which was not true of videotape. Later, the system could be used to make black-and-white copies of color programs for sale to television stations that were not yet broadcasting in color.

The system was largely used for black-and-white reproduction. Although some color telerecordings were made, they were generally in the minority as by the time color programs were widely needed for sale, video standards conversion was easier and higher quality and the price of videotape had become much reduced. Before videotape became the exclusive recording format during the early to mid-1980s, any (color) video recordings used in documentaries or filmed program inserts were usually transferred onto film.

In the 1950s a home telerecording kit was introduced in Britain, allowing enthusiasts to make 16 mm film recordings of television programs. The major drawback, apart from the short duration of a 16 mm film magazine, was that a large opaque frame had to be placed in front of the TV set in order to block out any stray reflections, making it impossible to watch the set normally while filming. It is not known if any recordings made using this equipment still exist.

British broadcasters used telerecordings for domestic purposes well into the 1960s, with 35 mm film usually used as it produced a higher quality result. For overseas sales, 16 mm film would be used, as it was cheaper. Although domestic use of telerecording in the UK for repeat broadcasts dropped off sharply after the move to colour in the late 1960s, 16 mm black and white film telerecordings were still being offered for sale by British broadcasters well into the 1970s.

Telerecording was still being used internally at the BBC in the 1980s too, to preserve copies for posterity of programs that were not necessarily of the highest importance, but which nonetheless their producers wanted to be preserved. If there were no videotape machines available on a given day, then a telerecording would be made. There is evidence to suggest that the children&#x27;s magazine program &quot;Blue Peter&quot; was occasionally telerecorded as late as 1985. After this point, however, cheap domestic videotape formats such as VHS could more easily be used to keep a backup reference copy of a program.

Another occasional use of telerecording into the late 1980s was by documentary makers working in 16 mm film who wished to include a videotape-sourced excerpt in their work, although such use was again rare.

In other territories, film telerecordings stopped being produced after the introduction of videotape. In Czechoslovakia, the first videotape recorders (Machtronics MVR-15) were introduced in 1966 but soon were replaced by the Ampex 2&quot; Quadruplex in 1967. Most of the programs, like TV dramas, were recorded on video, but only a few programs continued to be telerecorded onto 16 mm film. The last known telerecording was produced in 1971 and soon after, all programs were recorded on video only.

== Legacy ==
Kinescopes were intended to be used for immediate rebroadcast, or for an occasional repeat of a program; thus, only a small fraction of kinescope recordings remain today. Many television shows are represented by only a handful of episodes, such as with the early television work of comedian Ernie Kovacs, and the original version of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; hosted by Art Fleming.

Another purpose of Kinescopes involved satisfying show sponsors. Kinescopes sometimes would be sent to the advertising agency for the sponsor of a show so that the ad agency could determine whether or not the sponsor&#x27;s ads appeared properly. Due to this practice, some kinescopes have actually been discovered in the storage areas of some of these older advertising agencies or in the storage areas of the program sponsors themselves.

===In the United States===
Certain performers or production companies would require that a kinescope be made of every television program. Such is the case with performers Jackie Gleason and Milton Berle, for whom nearly complete program archives exist. As Jackie Gleason&#x27;s program was broadcast live in New York, the show was kinescoped for later rebroadcast for the West Coast. Per his contract, he would receive one copy of each broadcast, which he kept in his vault, and only released them to the public (on home video) shortly before his death in 1987.

Milton Berle sued NBC late in his life, believing the kinescopes of a major portion of his programs were lost. However, the programs were later found in a warehouse in Los Angeles.

Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions, the producers of such TV game shows as &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, had a significant portion of their output recorded on both videotape and kinescopes. These programs are rebroadcast on the American cable TV&#x27;s Game Show Network.

All of the NBC Symphony Orchestra telecasts with Arturo Toscanini, from 1948 to 1952, were preserved on kinescopes and later released on VHS and LaserDisc by RCA and on DVD by Testament. The original audio from the kinescopes, however, was replaced with high fidelity sound that had been recorded simultaneously either on transcription discs or magnetic tape.

In the mid-1990s, Edie Adams, wife of Ernie Kovacs, claimed that so little value was given to the kinescope recordings of the DuMont Television Network that after the network folded in 1956 its entire archive was dumped into upper New York bay. Today however, efforts are made to preserve the few surviving DuMont kinescopes, with the UCLA Film and Television Archive having collected over 300 for preservation.

In September 2010, a kinescope of game 7 of the 1960 World Series was found in the wine cellar of Bing Crosby. The game was thought lost forever but was preserved due to Crosby&#x27;s superstition about watching the game live. The film was transferred to DVD and was broadcast on the MLB Network shortly afterwards.

===In Australia===
Early Australian television drama series were recorded as kinescopes, such as &quot;Autumn Affair&quot; and &quot;Emergency&quot;, along with variety series like &quot;The Lorrae Desmond Show&quot;. Kinescopes continued to be made after videotape was introduced to Australia; most existing episodes of the 1965–1967 children&#x27;s series &quot;Magic Circle Club&quot; are kinescopes (per listings for episodes on National Film and Sound Archive website)

===In Britain===
Telerecordings form an important part of British television heritage, preserving what would otherwise have been lost. Nearly every pre-1960s British television program in the archives is in the form of a telerecording, along with the vast majority of existing 1960s output. Videotape was expensive and could be wiped and re-used; film was cheaper, smaller, and in practice more durable. Only a very small proportion of British television from the black-and-white era survives at all.

As the BBC has taken stock of the large gaps in its archive and sought to recover as much of the missing material as possible, many recovered programs, have been returned from the 1980s onwards as telerecordings held by foreign broadcasters or private film collectors. Many of these surviving telerecorded programs, such as episodes of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; and &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; continue to be transmitted on satellite television stations such as UKTV Gold, and many such programs have been released on VHS and DVD.

In 2008, the BBC undertook color restoration work on the existing 16 mm monochrome telerecording of &quot;Room at the Bottom&quot;, a 1969 episode of the sitcom &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;. Although this episode was originally produced and broadcast in color, the black and white film was the only surviving copy of the episode following the wiping of the original videotape. However, the telerecording process left color information in the form of chroma dots in the frames of the film; using a specially designed computer program, these chroma dots were used to bring out the original color information, which as then applied to the film, allowing the color to be restored to the episode. The restored version of &quot;Room at the Bottom&quot; was broadcast on 13 December 2008, the first time it had been seen in color since May 1970.

== Technology ==

NTSC television images are scanned at roughly , with two interlaced fields per frame, displayed at 30 frames per second.

A kinescope must be able to convert the 30 frame/s image to 24 frame/s, the standard sound speed of film cameras and do so in a way so that the image is clear enough to then re-broadcast by means of a film chain back to 30 frame/s.

In kinescoping an NTSC signal, 525 lines are broadcast in one frame. A 35 mm or 16 mm camera exposes one frame of film for every one frame of television (525 lines), and moving a new frame of film into place during the time equivalent of one field of television (131.25 lines). In the British 405-line television system, the French 819-line television system and the greater European 625-line television system, television ran at 25 frames—or more correctly, 50 fields—per second, so the film camera would also be run at 25 frames per second rather than the cinematic film standard of 24 frames.

Therefore, in order to maintain successful kinescope photography, a camera must expose one frame of film for &quot;exactly&quot; 1/30th or 1/25th of a second, the time in which one frame of video is transmitted, and move to another frame of film within the small interval of 1/120th of a second.

In some instances, this was accomplished through means of an electronic shutter which cuts off the TV image at the end of every set of visible lines. Most US kinescope equipment, however, utilized a mechanical shutter, revolving at 24 revolutions per second. This shutter had a closed angle of 72° and an open angle of 288°, yielding the necessary closed time of 1/120th of a second and open time 1/30th of a second. Using this shutter, in 1 second of video (60 fields equalling 30 frames), 48 television fields (totaling to 24 frames of video) would be captured on 24 frames of film, and 12 additional fields would be omitted as the shutter closed and the film advanced.

Analog television is a field-based system, and most electronic video recording solutions retain both fields of every frame, preserving the temporal resolution of interlaced video. Some early consumer-grade video tape recorders preserved only one field of each frame. Film, being a frame-based system, can retain full information from interlaced video by converting every field into a frame, but the required frame rate had been deemed impractical. Various solutions to the mapping problem have been developed resulting in successive improvements to the quality of the image at the traditional 24 fps frame rate. Nevertheless, video converted to film loses the fluid look of interlaced video, taking on a look somewhat similar to film.

=== Shutter bar and banding problems ===

The 72°/288° shutter and the systematic loss of 12 fields per second were not without side effects. In going from 30 frame/s to 24 frame/s, the camera photographed &quot;part&quot; of some fields. The juncture on the film frame where these part-fields meet is called a &quot;splice&quot;.

If the timing is accurate, the splice is invisible. However, if the camera and television are out of phase, a phenomenon known as &quot;shutter bar&quot; or &quot;banding&quot; occurs. If the shutter is slow in closing, overexposure results where the partial fields join and the &quot;shutter bar&quot; takes the form of a white line. If the shutter closes too soon, underexposure takes place and the line is black. The term &quot;banding&quot; refers to the phenomenon occurring on the screen as two bars.

=== Suppressed field ===

A simpler system, less prone to breakdown, was to suppress one of the two fields in displaying the television picture. This left the time during which the second field would have been displayed for the film camera to advance the film by one frame, which proved sufficient. This method was called &quot;skip field&quot; recording.

The method had several disadvantages. In missing every other field of video, half the information of the picture was lost on such recordings. The resulting film thus consisted of fewer than 200 lines of picture information and as a result, the line structure was very apparent. The missing field information also made movement look jerky.

=== Stored field ===

A successful improvement on the suppressed field system was to display the image from one of the fields at a much higher intensity on the television screen during the time when the film gate was closed, and then capture the image as the second field was being displayed. By adjusting the intensity of the first field, it was possible to arrange it so that the luminosity of the phosphor had decayed to exactly match that of the second field, so that the two appeared to be at the same level and the film camera captured both.

Another technique developed by the BBC, known as &quot;spot wobble&quot;, involved the addition of an extremely high frequency but low voltage sine wave to the vertical deflection plate of the television screen, which changed the moving &#x27;spot&#x27; - a circular beam of electrons by which the television picture was displayed - into an elongated oval. While this made the image slightly blurred, it removed the visible line structure (by causing adjacent lines to touch, so that no separating band of darkness lay between them) and thereby resulted in a better image. It also prevented moiré pattern from appearing when the resulting film was re-broadcast on television, which occurred if the line structure on the film recording did not precisely match the scanning lines of the electronic film scanner.

=== Moye-Mechau film recording ===

The Mechau system used a synchronized rotating mirror to display each frame of a film in sequence without the need for a gate. When reversed, a high-quality television monitor was set up in place of the projection screen, and unexposed film stock is run through at the point where the lamp would have been illuminating the film.

This procedure had the advantage of capturing both fields of the frame on a film, but required significant attention to produce quality reulity results. The Mechau film magazine only held enough for nine minutes so two recorders were needed to run in sequence in order to record anything longer.

=== Lenses ===

Lenses did not need a great depth of field but had to be capable both of producing a very sharp image with high resolution of a flat surface and of doing so at high speed. In order to minimize light fall-off on the perimeter of the lens, a coated lens was preferable. 40 mm or 50 mm lenses were usually used with 16 mm in calibrated mounts. Focus was checked by examining a print under a microscope.

=== Sound recording ===

The camera could be equipped with sound recording to place the soundtrack and picture on the same film for single-system sound recording. More commonly, the alternative &quot;double system&quot;, whereby the soundtrack was recorded on an optical recorder or magnetic dubber in sync with the camera, yielded a better quality soundtrack and facilitated editing.

=== Kinescope image ===

Kinescope CRTs intended for photographic use were coated with phosphors rich in blue and ultraviolet radiation. This permitted the use of positive type emulsions for photographing in spite of their slow film speeds. The brightness range of kinescope CRTs was about 1 to 30.

Kinescope images were capable of great flexibility. The operator could make the CRT image brighter or darker, adjust contrast, width and height, rotate left, right or upside down, and positive or negative image.

Since kinescope CRTs were able to produce a negative image, direct positive recordings could be made by simply photographing the negative image on the kinescope CRT. When making a negative film, in order for final prints to be in the correct emulsion position, the direction of the image was reversed on the television. This applied only when &quot;double system&quot; sound was used.

=== Film stock used ===

For kinescopes, 16 mm film was the common choice by most studios because of the lower cost of stock and film processing, but in the larger network markets, it was not uncommon to see 35 mm kinescopes, particularly for national rebroadcast. Fine grain positive stock was most commonly used because of its low cost and high resolution.

=== Common issues ===
Videotape engineer Frederick M. Remley wrote of kinescope recordings:
Because each field is sequential in time to the next, a kinescope film frame that captured two interlaced fields at once often showed a ghostly fringe around the edges of moving objects, an artifact not as visible when watching television directly at 50 or 60 fields per second.

Some kinescopes filmed the television pictures at the television frame rate - 30 full frames per second for American System M broadcasts and 25 full frames per second for European System B broadcasts, resulting in more faithful picture quality than those that recorded at 24 frames per second. The standard was later changed to 59.94 fields/s or 29.97 frame/s for System M broadcasts, due to the technical requirements of color TV. Since these reasons did not affect System B, the color TV framerate in Europe remained at 25 frames/s.

In the era of early color TV, the chroma information included in the video signal filmed could cause visible artifacts. It was possible to filter the chroma out, but this was not always done. Consequently, the color information was included (but not in color) in the black-and-white film image. Using modern computing techniques, the color may now be recovered, a process known as color recovery.

Because videotape records at fifty interlaced fields per second and telerecordings at twenty-five progressive frames per second, videotaped programs that exist now only as telerecordings have lost their characteristic &quot;live video&quot; look and the motion now looks filmic. One solution to this problem is VidFIRE, an electronic process to restore video-type motion.

<text>Edward is an English male name. It is derived from the Anglo-Saxon name &quot;Ēadweard&quot;, composed of the elements &quot;&quot; &quot;wealth, fortunate; prosperous&quot; and &quot;&quot; &quot;guardian, protector”.

==History==
The name Edward was very popular in Anglo-Saxon England, but the rule of the Norman and Plantagenet dynasties had effectively ended its use amongst the upper classes. The popularity of the name was revived when Henry III named his firstborn son, the future Edward I, as part of his efforts to promote a cult around Edward the Confessor, for whom Henry had a deep admiration.

==Variant forms==

The name has been adopted in the Iberian peninsula since the 15th century, due to Edward, King of Portugal, whose mother was English. The Spanish/Portuguese forms of the name are Eduardo and Duarte. Other variant forms include French Édouard, Italian Edoardo and Odoardo, German, Dutch, Czech and Romanian Eduard and Scandinavian Edvard.
Short forms include Ed, Eddy, Eddie, Ted, Teddy and Ned.

<text>The Endless Summer is a 1966 American surf documentary film directed, produced, edited and narrated by Bruce Brown. The film follows surfers Mike Hynson and Robert August on a surfing trip around the world. Despite the balmy mediterranean climate of their native California, cold ocean currents make local beaches inhospitable during the winter, without later, modern wetsuits. They travel to the coasts of Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, Hawaii, Senegal (Dakar), Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa in a quest for new surf spots while introducing locals to the sport along the way.

The narrative presentation eases from the stiff, formal documentary of the 1950s and early 1960s to a more casual, fun-loving and personal style filled with sly humor, honed from six years of live narration. The film&#x27;s surf rock soundtrack was provided by The Sandals, and the theme song was written by Gaston Georis and John Blakeley of the Sandals; &quot;Theme From &quot;The Endless Summer&quot;&quot; has since become one of the best known film themes in the surf movie genre.

In 1994, it was followed by the sequel &quot;The Endless Summer II&quot;. In 2000, Dana Brown, compiled &quot;The Endless Summer Revisited&quot;, later directing &quot;Step into Liquid&quot;, in 2003, documenting tow-in surfing.

==Background==
===8 mm===
Bruce Brown started surfing in the early 1950s. He took still photographs to show his mother what the draw of the sport was. While serving in the U.S. Navy on Oahu years later, he used an 8mm movie camera to photograph surfers from California. Once Brown got back to the states, he edited his footage into an hour-long film. Surfer Dale Velzy showed it at his San Clemente shop, charging 25 cents for admission.

===16 mm===
Bob Bagley chose the equipment at the camera store, including a 16 mm camera, and Velzy peeled off the money from his wad of cash to outfit Brown&#x27;s $5,000 production &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; (1958), Brown&#x27;s first &quot;real&quot; surf film.

In the winter of 1958, Brown went back to Hawaii to film the North Shore&#x27;s big surf. Just as Allen had done, to learn promotion, Brown went to the library for a book about how to make movies, and on the plane ride over, the novice filmmaker read the book. Brown said, &quot;I never had formal training in filmmaking and that probably worked to my advantage&quot;. In 1959, Dick Metz&#x27;s meeting with John Whitmore, on a Cape Town beach, and introduction to Cape St. Francis, during his family-liquor-license-sale-to-Disneyland-funded three-year global surf trip (1958—1961) led to his inspiring Bruce Brown to film there, By 1962, he had spent five years making one surf film per year, exhibiting at high school gyms and coffee houses, as a live production, narrating the silent film, from the stage, and playing tape recorded music. and a letter, to Whitmore, about Brown. He would shoot during the fall and winter months, edit during the spring and show the finished product during the summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;laobserved/2017/12/bruce_brown&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to &quot;The Endless Summer&quot;, Brown made &quot;unnamed 25¢ silent 8mm film footage&quot;, &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; (1958), &quot;Surf Crazy&quot; (1959), &quot;Barefoot Adventure&quot; (1960), &quot;Surfing Hollow Days&quot; (1961), and &quot;Waterlogged&quot; (1962). Each year, Allen and Brown made two tours, of the West Coast of the United States, and Hawaiʻi, exhibiting a film.

&quot;We would take the films to the venues in a van, and we had rewinds and viewers in the back of the van and I would actually edit the stuff while we were traveling. I would adjust it according to the reactions of the audience from the previous night.&quot;—Bruce Brown

== Title ==
The film&#x27;s title comes from the idea expressed at both the beginning and end of the film that, if one had enough time and money, it would be possible to follow the summer up and down the world (northern to southern hemisphere and back), making it endless.

==Development==
Brown remembered, &quot;I felt if I could take two years to make a film, maybe I could make something special&quot;. To do this, he would need a bigger budget than he had on previous films. To raise the $50,000 budget for &quot;The Endless Summer&quot;, Brown took the best footage from his four previous films and made &quot;Waterlogged&quot;. With the money raised from &quot;Waterlogged&quot;, Brown filmed &quot;The Endless Summer&quot;, his sixth surf film.&lt;ref name=&quot;danapointtimes.com/five-decades&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown&#x27;s original concept was for Cape St. Francis to be the main destination, but through the suggestion of a travel agent, during the planning stages of the film, that a round-the-world ticket, would cost $50 cheaper than just a Los Angeles to Cape Town, South Africa round-trip flight. after which Bruce came up with the idea of following the summer season by traveling up and down the world.

== Production ==
&quot;The Endless Summer&quot; was filmed in:
*Southern Hemisphere: South Africa (Cape St. Francis), Australia, New Zealand (Manu Bay), and Tahiti.
*Northern Hemisphere: Hawaii, California (Salt Creek Beach, Steamer Lane, Malibu), Senegal, Ghana (Labadi), and Nigeria.

Mike Hynson and Robert August had to pay $1,400 for their own around-the-world tickets, and Brown required a commitment of three months. Production lasted four months.

The opening shot of Mike Hynson and Robert August as silhouettes walking to the beach with burnt orange sky evokes the movie poster.

== Poster ==

In 1964, fellow surfer John Van Hamersveld was a student at the Art Center College of Design and the art director of &quot;Surfing Illustrated Magazine&quot; and &quot;Surfer&quot; magazine. To produce the image that would become iconic, he organized a photo session with the producer and the two stars at Salt Creek Beach in Dana Point. Using photo techniques for the central image and hand-lettering the title Van Hamersveld created a “national phenomenon” image that has endured as a classic. He was paid $150 for the art. The poster is featured in the National Museum of American History section of the Smithsonian Institution. In the description the museum noted, “The poster’s premise was Browns but Van Hamersveld took Bob Bagley’s image of the movie’s stars Mike Hynson and Robert August and Brown and transformed it into a 1960s neon masterpiece.”

== Distribution ==
Bruce Brown, at first, narrated the silent film live, from the stage, and accompanied it with tape recorded music, at school auditoriums, and similar venues, with R. Paul Allen collecting tickets, travelling by camper. He later took the completed film to several Hollywood studio distributors but was rejected because they did not think it would have mainstream appeal. In January 1964, Bruce Brown and R. Paul Allen took &quot;The Endless Summer&quot; to Wichita, Kansas and four-walled the Sunset Theater for two weeks, amidst a projectionist strike, with a bomb threat on the first showing, where moviegoers lined up in snowy weather in the middle of winter, selling out multiple screenings, and locally outgrossing &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. Distributors were still not convinced and Brown rented a theater in New York City where his film ran successfully for 48 weeks. After the success of the run at New York&#x27;s Kips Bay Theater, Don Rugoff of Cinema V distribution said he did not want the film or poster changed and wanted them distributed as is, thus Brown selected him over other distributors who wished to alter the poster. When distributed by Cinema V, &quot;The Endless Summer&quot; grossed $5 million domestically and over $20 million worldwide.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an aggregate score of 100% based on 23 critic reviews. Roger Ebert said of Brown&#x27;s work, &quot;the beautiful photography he brought home almost makes you wonder if Hollywood hasn&#x27;t been trying too hard&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;Brown leaves analysis of the surf-cult mystique to seagoing sociologists, but demonstrates quite spiritedly that some of the brave souls mistaken for beachniks are, in fact, converts to a difficult, dangerous and dazzling sport&quot;.

In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Robert Alden wrote, &quot;the subject matter itself—the challenge and the joy of a sport that is part swimming, part skiing, part sky-diving and part Russian roulette—is buoyant fun&quot;.

==Legacy==
When &quot;The Endless Summer&quot; premiered on June 15, 1966, it encouraged many surfers to travel abroad, giving birth to the &quot;surf-and-travel&quot; culture, with prizes for finding &quot;uncrowded surf&quot;, meeting new people and riding the &quot;perfect wave&quot;. It also introduced the sport, which had become popular outside of Hawaii and the Polynesian Islands in places like California and Australia, to a broader audience.

The then-unknown break off Cape St. Francis in South Africa, characterized as having the “perfect wave”, became one of the world&#x27;s most famous surfing sites thanks to &quot;The Endless Summer&quot;.

In 2002, &quot;The Endless Summer&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Gallery==
== Sequels ==
In 1994, Brown released a sequel, &quot;The Endless Summer II&quot;, in which surfers Pat O&#x27;Connell and Robert &quot;Wingnut&quot; Weaver retrace the steps of Hynson and August. It shows the growth and evolution of the surfing scene since the first film, which presented only classic longboard surfing. O&#x27;Connell rides a shortboard, which was developed in the time between the two movies, and there are scenes of windsurfing and bodyboarding.

The 1994 film illustrates how far surfing had spread since 1964, with footage of surf sessions in France, South Africa, Costa Rica, Bali, Java, and even Alaska. The 1994 sequel follows a similar structure to the original, with another round the world surfing adventure reflecting on cultural differences since the first film was shot. The South Africa material includes a return visit to Cape St. Francis, where the “perfect wave” had deteriorated somewhat, due to onshore construction projects.

In 2000, Dana Brown, Bruce&#x27;s son, released &quot;The Endless Summer Revisited&quot;, which consisted of unused footage from the first two films, as well as original cast interviews.

<text>Wolfram von Eschenbach (; – ) was a German knight, poet and composer, regarded as one of the greatest epic poets of medieval German literature. As a Minnesinger, he also wrote lyric poetry.

==Life==
Little is known of Wolfram&#x27;s life. There are no historical documents which mention him, and his works are the sole source of evidence. In &quot;Parzival&quot;, he talks of (&quot;we Bavarians&quot;); the dialect of his works is East Franconian. On the basis of this and a number of geographical references, the present-day Wolframs-Eschenbach, until 1917 Obereschenbach, near Ansbach in present-day Bavaria, has been officially designated as his birthplace. However, the evidence is circumstantial and not without problems – there are at least four other places named Eschenbach in Bavaria, and Wolframs-Eschenbach was not part of the Duchy of Bavaria (, &#x27;Old Bavaria&#x27;) in Wolfram&#x27;s time.

The arms shown in the Manesse manuscript come from the imagination of a 14th-century artist, drawing on the figure of the Red Knight in &quot;Parzival&quot;, and have no heraldic connection with Wolfram. Wolfram&#x27;s work indicates a number of possible patrons (most reliably Hermann I of Thuringia), which suggests that he served at a number of courts during his life. He was presumably not a wealthy man, as he made frequent allusions to his own poverty.

In his &quot;Parzival&quot;, Wolfram states that he is illiterate; while the claim is treated with scepticism by some scholars, the truth of the assertion, difficult for some moderns to believe, is impossible to ascertain. But it has been credited by many commentators. It is noted in Thomas Mann&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; that &quot;the greatest poet of the Middle Ages, Wolfram von Eschenbach, could neither read nor write&quot;, and the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; observes: &quot;Wolfram in his &quot;Parzival&quot; tells us explicitly that he could neither read nor write. His poems were written down from dictation. His knowledge was extensive and varied rather than accurate. He certainly knew French, but only imperfectly; for his proper names often show a curious misunderstanding of French words and phrases.&quot;

==Works==
===&quot;Parzival&quot;===
Wolfram is best known today for his &quot;Parzival&quot;, sometimes regarded as the greatest of all German Arthurian romances. Based on Chrétien de Troyes&#x27; unfinished &quot;Perceval, le Conte du Graal&quot;, it is the first extant work in German to have as its subject the Holy Grail (in Wolfram&#x27;s interpretation a gemstone). In the poem, Wolfram&#x27;s narrator expresses disdain for Chrétien&#x27;s (unfinished) version of the tale, and states that his source was a poet from Provence called Kyot.

===&quot;Titurel&quot; and &quot;Willehalm&quot;===

Wolfram is the author of two other narrative works: the fragmentary &quot;Titurel&quot; and the unfinished &quot;Willehalm&quot;. These were both composed after &quot;Parzival&quot;, and &quot;Titurel&quot; mentions the death of Hermann I, which dates it firmly after 1217. &quot;Titurel&quot; consists of two fragments, which tell the story of Schionatulander and Sigune (lovers that were already depicted in &quot;Parzival&quot;). The first fragment deals with the birth of love between the main characters. The second fragment is quite different. Schionatulander and Sigune are alone in a forest, when their peace is suddenly disturbed by a mysterious dog, whose leash contains a story written in rubies. Sigune is eager to read the story, but the dog runs off. Schionatulander sets off to find him, but, as we already know from &quot;Parzival&quot;, he dies in the attempt.

&quot;Willehalm&quot;, an unfinished poem based on the Old French chanson de geste, &quot;Aliscans&quot;, was a significant work, and has been preserved in 78 manuscripts. It is set against the backdrop of the religious wars between the Christians and the Saracens. The eponymous hero Willehalm kidnaps a Saracen princess, converts her to Christianity and marries her. The Saracen king raises an army to rescue his daughter. The poem has many of the distinguishing features of medieval literature: the victory of the Christians over a much larger Saracen army, the touching death of the young knight Vivian, Willehalm&#x27;s nephew and the works mirror of chivalric courage and spiritual purity.

=== Lyric poetry ===
Wolfram&#x27;s nine surviving songs, five of which are dawn-songs, are regarded as masterpieces of Minnesang. Dawn-songs recount the story of a knight who spends the night with his beloved lady, but at dawn has to slip away unnoticed. Mostly it is the lady who wakes the knight up in the morning, but sometimes this mission is made by the watchman. No melodies survived. Two melodies are still connected to him, the &quot;Schwarzer Thon&quot;, attributed to Wolfram in a 14th-century manuscript, and the fragmentary and unfinished epic &quot;Titurel&quot; (after 1217) with a complicated four-line stanza form that was often used in later poems.

===Influence===
The 84 surviving manuscripts of &quot;Parzival&quot;, both complete and fragmentary, indicate the immense popularity of Wolfram&#x27;s major work in the following two centuries. &quot;Willehalm&quot;, with 78 manuscripts, comes not far behind. Many of these include a continuation written in the 1240s by Ulrich von Türheim under the title &quot;Rennewart&quot;. The unfinished &quot;Titurel&quot; was taken up and expanded around 1272 by a poet named Albrecht, who is generally presumed to be Albrecht von Scharfenberg and who adopts the narrative persona of Wolfram. This work is referred to as the &quot;Jüngere Titurel&quot; (&quot;Younger Titurel&quot;).

The modern rediscovery of Wolfram begins with the publication of a translation of &quot;Parzival&quot; in 1753 by the Swiss scholar Johann Jakob Bodmer. &quot;Parzival&quot; was the main source Richard Wagner used when writing the libretto to his opera, &quot;Parsifal&quot;. Wolfram himself appears as a character in another Wagner opera, &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;.

<text>Oristano (; , local pronunciation: )) is an Italian city and (municipality), the capital of the Province of Oristano in the central-western part of the island of Sardinia. It is located on the northern part of the Campidano plain. It was established as the provincial capital on 16 July 1974. , the city had 31,671 inhabitants.

The economy of Oristano is based mainly on services, agriculture, tourism and small industries.

==History==

Oristano was previously known by the Byzantines as ΑριστιάνηϚ λίμνη (Aristianis límni, Pond of Oristano), and founded close to the ancient Phoenician settlement of &quot;Othoca&quot; (now Santa Giusta). It acquired importance in 1070, when, as a result of the frequent Saracen attacks, Archbishop Torcotorio made it the seat of the bishopric, which was previously in the nearby coastal town of Tharros. It also became the capital of the &quot;Judicate&quot; (equivalent to a Kingdom) of Arborea. Consequently, fortifications were designed, but the building thereof went on until judge Mariano II rose to power.

In medieval times Oristano vied for power over the whole island of Sardinia, and therefore waged wars against the other Sardinian kingdoms which culminated in the attempt to conquer the whole island during the reign (1347–75) of Mariano IV and that of his son Hugh III (1376–1383) and his daughter Eleanor (1383–1404). The Judicate of Arborea held out to be the last Sardinian kingdom to cease to exist in 1420, about 10 years after the battle of Sanluri. It was transformed in Marchesato by the Aragonese and conquered, following a revolt by the last marquess Leonardo Alagon, by the Catalan troops of the Kingdom of Aragon, in 1478 after the battle of Macomer.

Thereafter, Oristano&#x27;s history was that of the island of Sardinia, characterised by the Aragonese-Spanish (until 1708) and Piedmontese (from 1720) dominations, and then the unification of Italy.
In April 1921, David Cova, Emilio Lussu, Camillo Bellieni and other Sardinian veterans of World War I founded in the city the Sardinian Action Party.

==Main sights==

* The Tower of St. Christophoros, otherwise known as Tower of Mariano II, was built in 1290, is tall and the most striking remaining evidence of the old walls built at the time of the Judicate, as it was one of the main gates thereof.
* &quot;Torrione&quot; (&quot;Big Tower&quot;) of Portixedda.
* St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral (1130) was rebuilt during the reign of Mariano II after being destroyed in a siege. Of the original structure of Mariano, only parts of the apse and base of the campanile are left, as well as the Gothic Chapel of the Rimedio, which houses some medieval sculptures. Parts of a more ancient Byzantine edifice can be seen in the court. To the 17th century renovation belongs the Chapel of the Archivietto (&quot;Chapel of the Small Archive&quot;). The current Baroque style is largely from the 19th-century restoration. It has been supposed that the cathedral was used for the burials of the Judges and their families, but the subsequent dominations have deleted all traces of them. In the interior is a wooden statue of the &quot;Annunziata&quot;, attributed to Nino Pisano.
* The Church of St. Francis of Assisi was built around 1200 and is currently in neo-classical style. Therewithin is the Christ of Nicodemus, a wooden sculpture believed to be the work of Valencian masters, dating back to the 14th century.
* The Franciscan church of &quot;Santa Chiara&quot; (consecrated in 1428) is an edifice in French-Gothic style with a single nave and a square apse.
* The Church and cloister of the &quot;Carmine&quot; is one of the best examples of Baroque-Roccoco architecture in Oristano.
* The Church of Saint Sebastian is the only medieval extramural church, i.e. it is located outside the walls.
* The Church of Saint Dominic (San Domenico) was built in 1634 at the initiative of friar Pietro Flores and financially supported by local nobleman Baldassarre Dedoni. Citizens also made donations in exchange for of floor space for a tomb therewithin. The building is a rectangularly-shaped chamber with two chapels formed in its right side wall: one of them is dedicated to Saint Vincent and the other one to the name of Jesus. Most notably, it has a wood retable that served as the main altar and includes several niches dedicated to Saint Dominic and other Saints. Upon the suppression of religious orders in 1832 the Dominicans, who had been in charge until then, bequeathed the church to the archconfraternity of the Saint Name of Jesus. It was thereafter refurbished several times, deconsecrated and currently serves as an Auditorium for congresses and concerts.
* In the village of Massama is the small pre-Romanesque church called Oratory of the Souls, showing influences from the Visigothic art of the 8th century.

===Sa Sartiglia and other events===
&quot;Sa Sartiglia&quot;, otherwise known at its inception as &quot;Sartilla&quot;, is an equestrian tournament held in Oristano for the past 500 years on Carnival Sunday and Mardi Gras. The tournament on Sunday is organized by the corporation (&quot;gremio&quot;) of farmers, whereas that on Mardi Gras is organised by the gremio of carpenters. It has arguably an ancient Castillan origin. Researchers M. Falchi and M. Zucca found a manuscript dating the first tournament to 1543, whereas Pau, a late local historian, believed it originated in Oristano before the Spaniards set foot on the island. In fact, in a letter written to an English friar in the 14th century, St. Catherine of Siena stated that the Judge of Arborea could provide two galleys and one thousand horsemen to fight in a crusade for ten years. While being far from conclusive evidence that the tournament had already been, or was about to be held, this letter is certainly a testament to the importance of horse-breeding in Oristano and its surrounding countryside at the time.

The name &quot;Sartiglia&quot; comes from &quot;Sortija&quot; which, in turn, evolved from the Latin word &quot;Sorticola&quot;, the diminutive form of &quot;Sors&quot; which does not only mean fate and fortune, but also &quot;ring&quot;.

The ring is a tin star provided with a hole at its centre, hanging from a ribbon strung above horseman&#x27;s height across the street near the cathedral, at which masked horsemen aim with their swords on steeds galloping at breath-taking speed, after being announced by trumpets and drums and having gathered pace down a route, covered with sand, snaking across the town centre. The number of stars caught on each day is a sign of the wealth that the harvest and carpentry work will bring to the corporations.

At the end of &quot;Sa Sartiglia&quot;, elsewhere within the old walls, another sand covered route will be trodden by horses ridden by those same masked horsemen and women showing their stunning prowess, while engaging in all sorts of acrobatics on two and three galloping steeds at a time. This is called &quot;La Pariglia&quot;, and ends at sunset.

The leader of both trials is called &quot;Su Componidori&quot;, meaning &quot;the one who marshals&quot;. He is chosen by the members of the Corporations, who do not disclose his name until Candlemas, when &quot;Su Majorale&quot; announces it directly to the appointee and a careful selection of the horses as well as adequate practice can start. He is neither a man, nor a woman but androgynous, much akin to the land and, at the end of the tournament, blesses bystanders and the town with the &quot;little doll of May&quot; (&quot;Sa Pippia &#x27;e maiu&quot;), a bunch of flowers swaddled in a ribbon, believed to pre-date the tournament itself, followed by the other horsemen at a canter first, and then alone, riding with his back on his galloping steed&#x27;s, face up gazing at the Heavens.

==Transport==
Oristano can be reached by train from Sardinia&#x27;s ports of Olbia and Porto Torres, and the island&#x27;s main cities Cagliari and Sassari. From Oristano all villages of the province can be reached by buses departing the bus station close to centrally-located Piazza G.Manno. Moreover, a private concern provides a twice-daily bus service to and from Cagliari Elmas Airport. The journey takes approximately 2 hours.

Oristano is served by the Fenosu Airport, from the city, and by a cargo sea port. The airport is no longer operating.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Oristano has a subtropical mediterranean climate with hot summers and mild winters. As manifests a mediterranean climate, precipitation patterns are highly seasonally defined, with the vast majority falling during winter. Summers are still retaining warmth and humidity during night in spite of the dry weather.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Oristano is twinned with:
* Ciutadella de Menorca, Spain, since 1991
* Garden City, Kansas, United States

<text>Gennargentu (; ) is a large massif in central-southern Sardinia, Italy, encompassing the provinces of Nuoro and Ogliastra. It includes the highest peaks on the island, such as Punta La Marmora (), Monte Spada (), Punta Erbas Virdes (), Bruncu Spina () and Punta Paulinu ().

The range forms part of the Gennargentu National Park. Geologically, its rocks are amongst the oldest in Europe, and are therefore smooth shaped: rock types include schist, limestone and granite.

The etymology of the name is not attested: it could mean &quot;Silver Door&quot; (), &quot;Door of the Winds&quot; () or &quot;Door of Absinthium&quot; ().

==Ski resorts==
The mountains are home to the only ski resort on the island: Bruncu Spina ski area.

<text>e-text (from &quot;electronic text&quot;; sometimes written as etext) is a general term for any document that is read in digital form, and especially a document that is mainly text. For example, a computer-based book of art with minimal text, or a set of photographs or scans of pages, would not usually be called an &quot;e-text&quot;. An e-text may be a binary or a plain text file, viewed with any open source or proprietary software. An e-text may have markup or other formatting information, or not. An e-text may be an electronic edition of a work originally composed or published in other media, or may be created in electronic form originally. The term is usually synonymous with e-book.

==E-text origins==

E-texts, or electronic documents, have been around since long before the Internet, the Web, and specialized E-book reading hardware. Roberto Busa began developing an electronic edition of Aquinas in the 1940s, while large-scale electronic text editing, hypertext, and online reading platforms such as Augment and FRESS appeared in the 1960s. These early systems made extensive use of formatting, markup, automatic tables of contents, hyperlinks, and other information in their texts, as well as in some cases (such as FRESS) supporting not just text but also graphics.

==&quot;Just plain text&quot;==

In some communities, &quot;e-text&quot; is used much more narrowly, to refer to electronic documents that are, so to speak, &quot;plain vanilla ASCII&quot;. By this is meant not only that the document is a plain text file, but that it has no information beyond &quot;the text itself&quot;—no representation of bold or italics, paragraph, page, chapter, or footnote boundaries, etc. Michael S. Hart, for example, argued that this &quot;is the only text mode that is easy on both the eyes and the computer&quot;. Hart made the correct point that proprietary word-processor formats made texts grossly inaccessible; but that is irrelevant to standard, open data formats. The narrow sense of &quot;e-text&quot; is now uncommon, because the notion of &quot;just vanilla ASCII&quot; (attractive at first glance), has turned out to have serious difficulties:

First, this narrow type of &quot;e-text&quot; is limited to the English letters. Not even Spanish ñ or the accented vowels used in many European languages cannot be represented (unless awkwardly and ambiguously as &quot;~n&quot; &quot;a&#x27;&quot;). Asian, Slavic, Greek, and other writing systems are impossible.

Second, diagrams and pictures cannot be accommodated, and many books have at least some such material; often it is essential to the book.

Third, &quot;e-texts&quot; in this narrow sense have no reliable way to distinguish &quot;the text&quot; from other things that occur in a work. For example, page numbers, page headers, and footnotes might be omitted, or might simply appear as additional lines of text, perhaps with blank lines before and after (or not). An ornate separator line might be represented instead by a line of asterisks (or not). Chapter and sections titles, likewise, are just additional lines of text: they might be detectable by capitalization if they were all caps in the original (or not). Even to discover what conventions (if any) were used, makes each book a new research or reverse-engineering project.

In consequence of this, such texts cannot be reliably re-formatted. A program cannot reliably tell where footnotes, headers or footers are, or perhaps even paragraphs, so it cannot re-arrange the text, for example to fit a narrower screen, or read it aloud for the visually impaired. Programs might apply heuristics to guess at the structure, but this can easily fail.

Fourth, and a perhaps surprisingly important issue, a &quot;plain-text&quot; e-text affords no way to represent information &quot;about&quot; the work. For example, is it the first or the tenth edition? Who prepared it, and what rights do they reserve or grant to others? Is this the raw version straight off a scanner, or has it been proofread and corrected? Metadata relating to the text is sometimes included with an e-text, but there is by this definition no way to say whether or where it is preset. At best, the text of the title page might be included (or not), perhaps with centering imitated by indentation.

Fifth, texts with more complicated information cannot really be handled at all. A bilingual edition, or a critical edition with footnotes, commentary, critical apparatus, cross-references, or even the simplest tables. This leads to endless practical problems: for example, if the computer cannot reliably distinguish footnotes, it cannot find a phrase that a footnote interrupts.

Even raw scanner OCR output usually produces more information than this, such as the use of bold and italic. If this information is not kept, it is expensive and time-consuming to reconstruct it; more sophisticated information such as what edition you have, may not be recoverable at all.

If actuality, even &quot;plain text&quot; uses some kind of &quot;markup&quot;—usually control characters, spaces, tabs, and the like: Spaces between words; two returns and 5 spaces for paragraph. The main difference from more formal markup is that &quot;plain texts&quot; use implicit, usually undocumented conventions, which are therefore inconsistent and difficult to recognize.

The narrow sense of e-text as &quot;plain vanilla ASCII&quot; has fallen out of favor. Nevertheless, many such texts are freely available on the Web, perhaps as much because they are easily produced as because of any purported portability advantage. For many years Project Gutenberg strongly favored this model of text, but with time, has begun to develop and distribute more capable forms such as HTML.

<doc id="165348" wikidata="Q841364" url="?curid=165348" title="Ayutthaya Kingdom">
<text>The Ayutthaya Kingdom or the Empire of Ayutthaya was a Mon–Siamese kingdom that existed in Southeast Asia from 1351 to 1767, centered around the city of Ayutthaya, in Siam, or present-day Thailand. European travellers in the early 16th century called Ayutthaya one of the three great powers of Asia (alongside Vijayanagara and China). The Ayutthaya Kingdom is considered to be the precursor of modern Thailand, and its developments are an important part of the history of Thailand.

The Ayutthaya Kingdom emerged from the mandala or merger of three maritime city-states on the Lower Chao Phraya Valley in the late 13th and 14th centuries (Lopburi, Suphanburi, and Ayutthaya). The early kingdom was a maritime confederation, oriented to post-Srivijaya Maritime Southeast Asia, conducting raids and tribute from these maritime states. After two centuries of political organization from the Northern Cities and a transition to a hinterland state, Ayutthaya centralized and became one of the great powers of Asia. From 1569 to 1584, Ayutthaya was a vassal state of Toungoo Burma; but quickly regained independence. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Ayutthaya emerged as an entrepôt of international trade and its cultures flourished. The reign of Narai ( 1657–1688) was known for Persian and later, European, influence and the sending of the 1686 Siamese embassy to the French court of King Louis XIV. The Late Ayutthaya Period saw the departure of the French and English but growing prominence of the Chinese. The period was described as a &quot;golden age&quot; of Siamese culture and saw the rise in Chinese trade and the introduction of capitalism into Siam, a development that would continue to expand in the centuries following the fall of Ayutthaya.

Ayutthaya&#x27;s failure to create a peaceful order of succession and the introduction of capitalism undermined the traditional organization of its elite and the old bonds of labor control which formed the military and government organization of the kingdom. In the mid-18th century, the Burmese Konbaung dynasty invaded Ayutthaya in 1759–1760 and 1765–1767. In April 1767, after a 14-month siege, the city of Ayutthaya fell to besieging Burmese forces and was completely destroyed, thereby ending the 417-year-old Ayutthaya Kingdom. Siam, however, quickly recovered from the collapse and the seat of Siamese authority was moved to Thonburi-Bangkok within the next 15 years.

In foreign accounts, Ayutthaya was called &quot;Siam&quot;, but people of Ayutthaya called themselves &quot;Tai&quot;, and their kingdom &quot;Krung Tai&quot; () meaning &#x27;Tai country&#x27; (). It was also referred to as &quot;Iudea&quot; in a painting requested by the Dutch East India Company. The capital city of Ayutthaya is officially known as &quot;Krung Thep Dvaravati Si Ayutthaya&quot; (), as documented in historical sources.

==History==
===Origins===

The lower Chao Phraya Basin around the turn of the second millennium was split between Lavo Kingdom, which dominated the eastern half of the Lower Chao Phraya, and Suphannabhum, which dominated the west. The western lower Chao Phraya Basin was also influenced by Angkorian culture but not direct Angkorian political and military influence. Ayutthaya, argued by Charnvit Kasetsiri, was the merger of four different port polities along the Lower Chao Phraya Basin: Lopburi (Lavo), Suphanburi, Ayutthaya, and Phetchaburi. Suphanburi had first sent a tribute mission to Song dynasty in 1180 and Phetchaburi to the Yuan dynasty in 1294 and tribute missions to Vijaynagar empire between 1400 and 1500. The earliest written records of Ayutthaya in the Chinese chronicles is that a Chinese official fled to Xian in 1282/83. Xian first sent an embassy to the Yuan dynasty in 1292, after which the Yuan requested another embassy. While older and traditional scholars argue that the ethnically Thai Sukhothai or Suphanburi was the &quot;Xiān&quot; mentioned in Chinese sources, more recent scholarship, like Chris Baker and Pasuk Phongpaichit, argue that &quot;Xian&quot; referred to Ayutthaya as that was the same name later used for Ayutthaya by the Chinese court. Michael Vickery argued that it is likely the Chinese used Xian to refer to the lower Chao Phraya Basin from its inception.

One of the earliest foreign sources to mention Xiān are the Đại Việt texts compiled during the reign of Lý Anh Tông, says merchants from Xiān Kingdom () and others arrived at &quot;Hǎidōng&quot; () and requested permission to trade and set up a trading post at &quot;Yún tún&quot; () in 1149. Other requests for trade were sent in 1241 and 1360. Xian also sent tributes to Đại Việt in 1182 and 1334. In 1313–1315, Xiān attempted to annex Champa but failed due to the reinforcements from Đại Việt. There was also a record of Siamese led by &quot;Passara&quot;, son of the king of Siam, settled in Java and established the city of &quot;Passaraan&quot; in 800 CE.

Archaeological findings have found evidence of buildings on the island of Ayutthaya prior to the 12th century. Pottery shards have been discovered to have been dated as early as the 1270s. Some temples to the east of Ayutthaya, off the island, have been known to exist before 1351. Recent archaeological works reveal pre-existing barays superimposed on by subsequent structures. The &quot;Tamnan mulasasana&quot; Buddhist chronicle notes that in the 1320s, two Buddhist monks visited Ayutthaya in search of scriptures and that a previous monk had been honored by the &quot;King of Ayodhia&quot; on his return from Lanka. Since the late 13th century, expeditions were sent to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra in the goal of extracting resources to gain a share of the maritime trade. Other contemporary scholars argued that Ayutthaya had been an important commercial center since the 11th century or at least several centuries prior to 1351.

21st-century archaeological surveys found that the name of the pre-Ayutthaya cities on the Khao Kop Inscription dated to the 14th–15th centuries is Ayodhaya Sriramthep Nakorn (), as stated in the Thai Chronicle, &quot;Phraratchaphongsawadan Nuea&quot; (Royal Chronicle of The North compiled in 1807 collected from old books from period of King Narai and stories told by northerners). At least three royal decrees in Thai were enacted during that period, and the name of the king who ruled Ayodhaya in the oldest of the three royal decrees, &quot;the Miscellaneous Laws (Phra Aiyakan Betset) 1225 AD&quot;, is found as King Uthong, who reigned from 1205 to 53 (not to be confused with King Uthong reigning from 1351 to 69). It was also found that Thai was used as the official language at that time, which reflected the social changes of the people in the Chao Phraya River Basin.

The existence of &quot;Ayodhya Sri Rama Thep Nakhon&quot; is also mentioned in the Burmese chronicle, &quot;Hmannan Yazawin&quot;, which mentions the Gywan warriors, who are descendants of the Thai Yuan, marched to Thaton kingdom in 1056 AD as inscribed on the Burmese inscriptions at Arakan Pagoda, Mandalay. The &quot;Hmannan Yazawin&quot; said the south-eastward country of the Gywans, also called &quot;Ayoja&quot;. George Cœdès pointed out that &quot;Ayoja&quot; or &quot;Arawsa&quot; meant Ayudhya or Siam.

The Malay annals (&quot;Sulalatus Salatin&quot;) and History of the Malay Kingdom of Patani (&quot;Sejarah Kerajaan Melayu Patani&quot;) stated that prior to 1160 CE, the Siam-Thai of Ayutthaya (Tai-Shan&#x27;s or Siam-Asli, literally &quot;aboriginal Siamese&quot;) were migrating southward and penetrating far into the Malay Peninsula. The History of the Malay Kingdom of Patani highlights the fact that Patani rulers treated the Siam-Thai of Ayutthaya (but not Sukhothai Kingdom) as equals rather than vassals when discussing the southward expansion of Siam. In the 12th century, the Malays were successful in establishing states such as Kedah, Melaka, and Temasek. However, Patani and other surrounding territories remained under the control of the aboriginal Siamese.

====Pre-Ayutthaya cities====

In 934, a royal lineage from Bang Pan (present-day in Phran Kratai, Kamphaeng Phet), Phra Maha Buddha Sakorn (พระมหาพุทธสาคร), founded a new city named Sangkaburi (สังขะบุรี) on the south bank of Lopburi River near the present-day Wat Thammikarat. Sakorn ruled the city until he died in 964. His son, Kothrabong (โคตรบอง), took over the throne but lost power to a usurper, Kreak (แกรก), a commoner from Lavo, who was then crowned as the new ruler named Sinthapomarin (สินธพอมรินทร์). After that, the throne was despoiled by Narai (not to be confused with King Narai reigning from 1656 to 88), the son of King Chadachota from Lavo Kingdom, who was of the Suphannabhum lineage. Narai renamed the city Ayodhya () and eventually set it Lavo&#x27;s new capital. The former capital was then renamed Lopburi. The majority of Ayodhya&#x27;s inhabitants are supposed to have migrated from Dvaravati&#x27;s Ayojjhapura following its fall in 946, as well as residents from Lavo&#x27;s Lavapura who fled after the city was destroyed by Angkor in 1001.

After the end of Narai&#x27;s reign in 1087, Ayodhya fell under the power struggles between nine amatyas for two years, and was won by Phra Chao Luang (พระเจ้าหลวง), who relocated the city, in 1097, southward to the east bank of the Chao Phraya River near the mouth of the Mae Bea River (แม่น้ำแม่เบี้ย), south of the present Wat Phanan Choeng. However, since he had no male heir, he had his only daughter marry Sai Nam Peung (), son of Kraisornrat () who was of Mon&#x27;s Chaliang and Tai&#x27;s Chiang Saen lineages and served as the Lavapura king at that time. Their descendants, later known as the Uthong (Lavo) dynasty, continued to rule Ayodhya until the traditional establishment of the Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1351.

During the pre-Aytthaya period, Ayodhya was mentioned as &quot;Xiān&quot; (; or Siam) in several Chinese and Đại Việt texts from 1149 to the official establishment of the Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1351. There are many records of Xiān invasion of Champa, &quot;Dān mǎ xī&quot; (, identified as far as Tumasik, or Singapore), Xī lǐ (), Ma-li-yü-êrh (Melayu), and Samudera Pasai Sultanate on Sumatra, as well as a well-known bas relief panel of Angkor Wat showing mercenaries of the Khmer army, who, among others, are identified as &quot;syam-kuk&quot;, perhaps &quot;of the land of Siam.&quot; One cannot be certain what ethnolinguistic group these mercenaries belonged to, but many scholars have thought them to be Siam people. According to The Customs of Cambodia written by Zhou Daguan as an official delegation sent by the Yuan Dynasty to Angkor from 1296–1297, the Siamese people exerted significant influence over Lavo&#x27;s Lavapura and appeared in huge numbers in the Angkorian capital of Yasodharapura. The wars against Angkor began in the 1290s.

====Traditional founding of Ayutthaya====
Ayutthaya was traditionally founded by King Uthong on 4 March 1351. This fact, however, has been subject to long scholarly debate. According to Chris Baker-Pasuk Phongpaichit, there are at least seven legends about who Uthong was: &quot;a Northern Thai prince, a fugitive Chinese prince from the sea, a Khmer noble from Angkor, a ruler from one of the gulf cities, or a Chola.&quot; Other than being the legendary founder of Ayutthaya, the only thing known about Uthong in the chronicles is the year of his death.

Before the official establishment of the kingdom, the lower Menam Valley entered the conflict-free era in the 12th century; artifacts and ruins dating back to the 12th–13th centuries found in the area indicate that there was a massive migration from surrounding neighbors, such as the Khmer from the east, the Mon from the west, and the Tai-Mon from the north. Several modern mandalas then emerged, such as Suphannabhum, , Sukhothai, as well as Ayutthaya Kingdom.

===Early maritime dominance===

In the 1290s through to the 1490s, Ayutthaya sent forces down to the peninsula and demanded tribute from the Malay principalities down to Temasek (Singapura (modern Singapore)) and Sumatra. The early Ayutthaya polity was a maritime-oriented confederation, more in line with the Malay polities of Maritime Southeast Asia than with states inland like Sukhothai and the Northern Cities. Muslim and European mapmakers labeled the Malay Peninsula up to the Tenasserim coast as part of Ayutthaya in the 15th and early 16th centuries. Early Ayutthaya did not keep records and their early dynastic chronology is likely fabricated by later Ayutthaya elites writing their histories: the early chronology in the palace chronicles does not correlate with the Ayutthaya temple chronicles nor the Chinese court chronicles.

The integrity of the patchwork of cities of the early Ayutthaya Kingdom was maintained largely through familial connections under the mandala system. King Uthong had his son, Prince Ramesuan, the ruler of Lopburi (Lavo), his brother, the ruler of Praek Sriracha(in modern Chainat Province) and his brother-in-law, Khun Luang Pa-ngua, the ruler of Suphanburi. The ruler of Phetchaburi was his distant relative. The king would appoint a prince or a relative to be the ruler of a city, and a city that was ruled by a prince was called &quot;Muang Look Luang&quot; (). Each city ruler swore allegiance and loyalty to the King of Ayutthaya but also retained certain privileges.

Politics of Early Ayutthaya was characterized by rivalries between the two dynasties; the Uthong dynasty based on Lopburi (Lavo) and the Suphannabhum dynasty based on Suphanburi. Traditional narratives argued that Ayutthaya conquered Sukhothai, Angkor, etc., but more modern narratives argue that territorial conquest was a European thing and not a Southeast Asian thing. Rather, the processes which saw Ayutthaya expand was one of political merger and consolidation between the cities at the head of the peninsula and slowly ascending up the Chao Phraya River Basin to the Northern Cities.

The culture of early Ayutthaya, described by Ma Huan, a scribe on Zheng He&#x27;s voyages, in the early 15th century, described Ayutthaya as a rowdy port town, whose men practice fighting on water, and where the affairs of everyday life was arranged by the women. The cities on the peninsula regularly complained to the Chinese court about constant Siamese attacks down the peninsula around this time period.

===Age of warfare===
The 1430s through to 1600 marked a period of rising warfare throughout Mainland Southeast Asia. In 1500, the Portuguese noted that Ayutthaya had 100 elephants, 50 years later, Ayutthaya had 50,000 elephants. Ayutthaya began launching military land expeditions far to the west and east. In the west, Ayutthaya fought to acquire the cities of Tavoy, Mergui, Tenasserim, and Martaban in the late 15th century. Song China&#x27;s increasing interests to sea commerce at the turn of the second millennium made trade between China and the Indian Ocean especially lucrative. In the 1430s, Ayutthaya attacked Angkor, but did not sack the city, although Ayutthaya did install a short-lived puppet ruler.

Palace Law Codes under Borommatrailokkanat exemplified the newfound attention to warfare, citing a number of rewards for the number of enemies beheaded. The introduction of elephants, guns, and mercenaries made wars in Southeast Asia much more chronic and much more deadly. By the late 16th century, Pegu (Bago) suffered a severe conscript revolt, Ayutthaya phrai fled into the forests or bribed the conscription officers, and the construction of sturdier and stronger city walls made warfare largely ineffective.

====Transition to a hinterland state====

The Ayutthaya Kingdom shifted from a maritime state to more of a hinterland state during the 15th and 16th centuries. Its absorption of the Northern Cities and the shifting of trade power to the inland trade routes with China facilitated this change of policy. The reign of King Borommatrailokkanat was the peak of this merger between the basin and the Northern Cities, being the scion of generations of intermarriage between the two.

Even though Borommatrailokkanat symbolized the merger between North and South, the Lan Na Kingdom, a state North of Ayutthaya (modern-day Northern Thailand), contested Ayutthaya&#x27;s growing influence over the Northern Cities. The Ayutthaya-Lan Na War was fought over the Upper Chao Phraya valley for control of the Northern Cities. Whether he preferred the Northern Cities to Ayutthaya or the necessity to have a capital closer to the war, Borommatrailokkanat moved his capital to Phitsanulok. Lan Na suffered setbacks and Borommatrailokkanat eventually sued for peace in 1475.

Ayutthaya&#x27;s sphere of influence down the peninsula was contested by the Malacca Sultanate. Ayutthaya launched several abortive conquests against Malacca which was diplomatically and economically fortified by the military support of Ming China. In the early-15th century the Ming admiral Zheng He established a base of operation in the port city, making it a strategic position the Chinese could not afford to lose to the Siamese. Under this protection, Malacca flourished, becoming one of Ayutthaya&#x27;s great foes until the capture of Malacca by the Portuguese. Ayutthaya&#x27;s attention to the portage routes across the upper peninsula meant that it did not send a military expedition to the lower peninsula and the Malay States throughout the 16th century.

====Centralization and dominance of the Northern lords====
Ayutthaya&#x27;s sphere of influence was now stretched from the Northern Cities to the Malay Peninsula, with its heartland centered around the old Ayutthaya-Suphanburi-Lopburi-Phetchaburi polity. The &quot;Muang Look Luang&quot; system was inadequate to govern relatively vast territories. The government of Ayutthaya was centralized and institutionalized under King Borommatrailokkanat in his reforms promulgating in Palatine Law of 1455, which became the constitution of Ayutthaya for the rest of its existence and continued to be the constitution of Siam until 1892, albeit in altered forms. The central government was dominated by the &quot;Chatusadom&quot; system ( lit. &quot;Four Pillars), in which the court was led by two Prime Ministers; the &quot;Samuha Nayok&quot; the Civil Prime Minister and the &quot;Samuha Kalahom&quot; the Grand Commander of Forces overseeing Civil and Military affairs, respectively. Under the &quot;Samuha Nayok&quot; were the Four Ministries. In the regions, the king sent not &quot;rulers&quot; but &quot;governors&quot; to govern cities. The cities were under governors who were from nobility not rulers with privileges as it had previously been. The &quot;Hierarchy of Cities&quot; was established and cities were organized into four levels. Large, top level cities held authorities over secondary or low-level cities.

The increased wealth of Ayutthaya resulted in the beginnings of a chronic succession struggle for the Ayutthaya throne. Due to the lack of stable succession law, from each succession from the 16th century onwards, princely governors or powerful dignitaries claiming their merit gathered their forces and moved on the capital to press their claims, culminating in several bloody coups. With the dominance of the Suphanburi clan, it now had to face the militaristic nobles of the Northern Cities, who increasingly came south for wealth prospects at an increasingly wealthy and powerful Ayutthaya. The first real succession struggles in Ayutthaya occurred in the early 16th century, with the Northern lords playing a prominent role. Under the reign of Maha Chakkraphat, the Northern lords, led by the Lord of Phitsanulok, Maha Thammarachathirat, became kingmakers in Ayutthaya. The final nail for this transition was the overthrow of the Suphanburi clan from the Ayutthaya throne following the 1569 Burmese capture of Ayutthaya, placing Maha Thammarachathirat on the Ayutthaya throne.

The 15th century also marked a turning point in Ayutthaya&#x27;s view of itself. King Borommatrailokkanat performed some sort of coronation ceremony, the first in Ayutthaya history, in the 1460s. Prior to the 15th century, Ayutthaya&#x27;s palaces and temples were inferior in grandeur to cities such as Sukhothai and Phitsanulok. By the early 16th century, Ayutthaya had now rivalled its regional competitors in its city grandeur, building magnificent wats and palaces for kings with a number of tributary states.

====First Burmese wars====
Starting in the middle of the 16th century, the kingdom came under repeated attacks by the Taungoo dynasty of Burma. The Burmese–Siamese War (1547–1549) resulted in a failed Burmese siege of Ayutthaya. A second siege (1563–1564) led by King Bayinnaung forced King Maha Chakkraphat to surrender in 1564. The royal family was taken to Pegu (Bago), with the king&#x27;s second son Mahinthrathirat installed as the vassal king. In 1568, Mahinthrathirat revolted when his father managed to return from Pegu as a Buddhist monk. The ensuing third siege captured Ayutthaya in 1569 and Bayinnaung made Maha Thammarachathirat (also known as Sanphet I) his vassal king, instating the Sukhothai dynasty.

In May 1584, less than three years after Bayinnaung&#x27;s death, Uparaja Naresuan (or Sanphet II), the son of Sanphet I, proclaimed Ayutthaya&#x27;s independence. This proclamation resulted in repeated invasions of Ayutthaya by Burma which the Siamese fought off ultimately finishing in an elephant duel between King Naresuan and Burmese heir-apparent Mingyi Swa in 1593 during the fourth siege of Ayutthaya in which Naresuan famously slew Mingyi Swa, although the existence of this battle has been challenged by modern scholars such as Sulak Sivaraksa. Today, this Siamese victory is observed annually on 18 January as Royal Thai Armed Forces day. Later that same year warfare erupted again (the Burmese–Siamese War (1593–1600)) when the Siamese invaded Burma, first occupying the Tanintharyi province in southeast Burma in 1593 and later the cities of Moulmein and Martaban in 1594. In 1599, the Siamese attacked the city of Pegu but were ultimately driven out by Burmese rebels who had assassinated Burmese King Nanda Bayin and taken power.

In 1613, after King Anaukpetlun reunited Burma and took control, the Burmese invaded the Siamese-held territories in Tanintharyi province, and took Tavoy. In 1614, the Burmese invaded Lan Na which at that time was a vassal of Ayutthaya. Fighting between the Burmese and Siamese continued until 1618 when a treaty ended the conflict. At that time, Burma had gained control of Lan Na and while Ayutthaya retained control of southern Tanintharyi (south of Tavoy).

===Peace and commerce===

The cessation of warfare around 1600 gave way to a prolonged period of peace and commerce, beginning with the reign of Ekathotsorot. The Portuguese and Dutch conquest of Malacca encouraged Asian traders to bypass Malacca by crossing the portage route mid-peninsula, controlled by Ayutthaya. This was a period of the great Asian empires: Ottoman Empire, Safavid Empire, Mughal Empire, Ming and Qing China, and Tokugawa Japan. Ayutthaya therefore became the lucrative middleman for trade between the global empires of the Early Modern World. Kings and nobles turned to hunting, trade, and the competition for the throne with the ending of warfare.

This period of Ayutthaya is also characterized by the emergence of mercantile absolutism, where the king had a virtual monopoly on all incomes into the kingdom, allowing the king to build new temples and palaces, sponsor ceremonies, and enshroud the monarchy in ritual mysticism. The king had the power to appoint governors of cities in the inner Ayutthaya mueang (cities) as well as appoint ministers in charge of the government. This however all made the target of the throne much more lucrative and rewarding than before. To be able to successfully put your target onto the throne would immensely reward its facilitators as much as the winner of the crown. The ability to appoint a Front Palace was effective in times of war but became a double-edged sword in regards to peace. Foreigners, due to their lack of connections within the kingdom, often became prominent officials within the Ayutthaya court during this period.

====Later Phitsanulok dynasty to early Prasat Thong dynasty====

In 1605, Naresuan died of illness while on campaign against a Burmese spillover conflict in the Shan region, leaving a greatly expanded Siamese kingdom to be ruled by his younger brother, Ekathotsarot (Sanphet III). Ekathotsarot&#x27;s reign was marked with stability for Siam and its sphere of influence, as well as increased foreign interactions, especially with the Dutch Republic, Portuguese Empire, and Tokugawa Shogunate (by way of the Red Seal Ships), among others. Indeed, representatives from many foreign lands began to fill Siam&#x27;s civil and military administration – Japanese traders and mercenaries led by Yamada Nagamasa, for example, had considerable influence with the king.

Ekathotsarot&#x27;s era ended with his death in 1610/11. The question of his succession was complicated by the alleged suicide of his eldest legitimate son, Suthat, while his second legitimate son, Si Saowaphak, was never legally designated as an heir by Ekathotsarot himself. Nonetheless, Si Saowaphak succeeded to the throne against his late father&#x27;s wishes, and led a short and ineffective reign in which he was kidnapped and held hostage by Japanese merchants, and later murdered. After this episode, the kingdom was handed to Songtham, a lesser son born of Ekathotsarot and a first-class concubine.

Songtham temporarily restored stability to Ayutthaya and focused inward on religious construction projects, most notably a great temple at Wat Phra Phutthabat. In the sphere of foreign policy, Songtham lost suzerainty of Lan Na, Cambodia and Tavoy, expelled the Portuguese, and expanded Siam&#x27;s foreign trade ties to include both the English East India Company and French East India Company, along with new merchant colonies in Siam representing communities from all across Asia. Additionally, Songtham maintained the service of Yamada Nagamasa, whose Japanese mercenaries were at this point serving as the king&#x27;s own royal guard.

As Songtham&#x27;s life began to fade, the issue of succession generated conflict once again when both King Songtham&#x27;s brother, Prince Sisin, and his son, Prince Chetthathirat, found support for their claims among the Siamese court. Although Thai tradition typically favored brothers over sons in matters of inheritance, Songtham enlisted the help of his influential cousin, Prasat Thong to ensure his son would inherit the kingdom instead. When Songtham died in 1628, Prasat Thong used his alliance with Yamada Nagamasa&#x27;s mercenaries to purge everyone who had supported Prince Sisin&#x27;s claim, eventually capturing and executing Sisin as well. Soon Prasat Thong became more powerful in Siam than the newly crowned King Chetthathriat, and through further intrigue staged a coup in which Chetthathirat was deposed and executed in favor of his even younger brother Athittayawong, whom Prasat Thong intended to use as a puppet ruler.

This form of government was quickly met with resistance by elements within the Thai court who were dissatisfied with the idea of having two acting heads of state. Since Prasat Thong already ruled Siam in all but name as Kalahom, he opted to resolve the issue by orchestrating the final dethronement and execution of the child king in 1629. Thus, Prasat Thong had completely usurped the kingdom by double (perhaps triple) regicide, extinguishing the Sukhothai dynasty 60 years after its installation by the Burmese. Many of King Prasat Thong&#x27;s former allies abandoned his cause following his ascension to the throne. In the course of quelling such resistance, Prasat Thong assassinated his former ally Yamada Nagamasa in 1630 (who now opposed Prasat Thong&#x27;s coup), and promptly banished all the remaining Japanese from Siam. While a community of Japanese exiles were eventually welcomed back into the country, this event marks the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate&#x27;s long-standing formal relationship with the Ayutthaya Kingdom.

====Persian and French influences====

Upon his death in 1656, King Prasat Thong was succeeded first by his eldest son, Chai, who was almost immediately deposed and executed by the late King&#x27;s brother, Si Suthammaracha, who in turn was defeated in single combat by his own nephew, Narai. Narai finally assumed a stable position as King of Ayutthaya with the support of a mainly foreign court faction consisting of groups that had been marginalized during the reign of his father, Prasat Thong. Among his benefactors were, notably, Persian, Dutch, and Japanese mercenaries. It should therefore come as no surprise that the era of King Narai was one of an extroverted Siam. Foreign trade brought Ayutthaya not only luxury items but also new arms and weapons. In the mid–17th century, during King Narai&#x27;s reign, Ayutthaya became very prosperous.

In 1662 war between Burma and Ayutthaya (the Burmese-Siamese War (1662-64)) erupted again when King Narai attempted to take advantage of unrest in Burma to seize control of Lan Na. Fighting along the border between the two adversaries continued for two years and at one time Narai seized Tavoy and Martaban. Ultimately, Narai and the Siamese ran out of supplies and returned home back within their border.

While commercially thriving, Narai&#x27;s reign was also socially tumultuous. Much of this can be attributed to three-way conflict between the Dutch, French, and English trading companies now operating in Siam at an unprecedented intensity due to Siam&#x27;s role as a center of trade, fostered by Narai. Of these competing foreign influences, Narai tended to favor relations with the French, wary of the growing Dutch and English colonial possessions in the South China Sea. Soon, Narai began to welcome communities of French Jesuits into his court, and pursue closer relations with both France and the Vatican. Indeed, the many diplomatic missions conducted by Narai to such far-flung lands are some of the most celebrated accomplishments of his reign. Narai as well leased the ports of Bangkok and Mergui to the French, and had many French generals incorporated into his army to train it in Western strategy and supervise the construction of European-style forts. During this time, Narai abandoned the traditional capital of Ayutthaya for a new Jesuit-designed palace in Lopburi.

As a growing Catholic presence cemented itself in Siam, and an unprecedented number of French forts were erected and garrisoned on land leased by Narai, a faction of native Siamese courtiers, Buddhist clergy, and other non-Catholic and/or non-French elements of Narai&#x27;s court began to resent the favorable treatment French interests received under his reign. This hostile attitude was especially directed at Constantine Phaulkon, a Catholic Greek adventurer and proponent of French influence who had climbed to the rank of Narai&#x27;s Prime Minister and chief advisor of foreign affairs. Much of this turmoil was primarily religious, as the French Jesuits were openly attempting to convert Narai and the royal family to Catholicism.
Narai was courted not just by Catholic conversion, but as well by proselytizing Muslim Persians, Chams and Makassars in his court, the later of which communities launched an unsuccessful revolt in 1686 to replace Narai with a Muslim puppet king. While members of the anti-foreign court faction were primarily concerned with Catholic influence, there is evidence to suggest that Narai was equally interested in Islam, and had no desire to fully convert to either religion.

Nonetheless, a dissatisfied faction now led by Narai&#x27;s celebrated elephantry commander, Phetracha, had long planned a coup to remove Narai. When the king became seriously ill in May 1688, Phetracha and his accomplices had him arrested along with Phaulkon and many members of the royal family, all of whom were put to death besides Narai, who died in captivity in July of that year. With the king and his heirs out of the way, Phetracha then usurped the throne and officially crowned himself King of Ayutthaya on 1 August. 

King Phetracha took Mergui back from French control almost immediately, and began the pivotal Siege of Bangkok, which culminated in an official French retreat from Siam. Phetracha&#x27;s reign, however, was not stable. Many of Phetracha&#x27;s provincial governors refused to recognize his rule as legitimate, and rebellions by the late Narai&#x27;s supporters persisted for many years. The most important change to Siam in the aftermath of the revolution was Phetracha&#x27;s refusal to continue Narai&#x27;s foreign embassies. King Phetracha opted instead to reverse much of Narai&#x27;s decisions and closed Thailand to almost all forms of European interaction except with the Dutch.

===Late Ayutthaya period===

====Continued prosperity and increased Chinese connections====
Despite the departure of most Europeans from Ayutthaya, their economic presence in Ayutthaya was negligible in comparison to the Ayutthaya China-Indian Ocean trade. Lieberman, later reinforced by Baker and Phongpaichit, refutes the idea that Siam&#x27;s alleged isolationism from global trade following the French and English departure in 1688 led to Ayutthaya&#x27;s gradual decline leading up to its destruction by the Burmese in 1767, stating: 

Instead, the 18th century was arguably the Ayutthaya Kingdom&#x27;s most prosperous, particularly due to trade with Qing China. The growth of China&#x27;s population in the late 17th–18th centuries, alongside nationwide rice shortages and famines in Southern China, meant that China was eager to import rice from other nations, particularly from Ayutthaya. During the Late Ayutthaya Period (1688–1767), the Chinese population in Ayutthaya possibly tripled in size to 30,000 from 1680 to 1767. The Chinese played a pivotal role in stimulating Ayutthaya&#x27;s economy in the last 100 years of the kingdom&#x27;s existence and eventually played a pivotal role in Siam&#x27;s quick recovery from the Burmese invasions of the 1760s, whose post-Ayutthaya monarchs (Taksin and Rama I), held close ties, through blood and through political connections, to this Sino-Siamese community.

====Succession conflicts and corruption====
Between 1600 and 1767, all but two royal successions were contested in a mini civil war in the capital. The throne became such a powerful and lucrative source of wealth during the 150 years of prosperity that many royals harbored ambitions to seize the throne. An Ayutthaya noble in the 18th century lamented that a large portion of court officials and able generals were killed in multiple succession struggles over the past 90 years. The last monarch, Ekkathat, alongside his brother, Uthumphon, undermined Prince Thammathibet, the Front Palace Uparaj and designated heir to his father, King Borommakot, by instigating or exposing his affair with two of his fathers&#x27; consorts. Prince Thammathibet was executed for his alleged crimes.

Corruption was rampant due to economic prosperity. Position buying and bribery for political offices became commonplace.

====Introduction of capitalism, rise of commoners, and proto-nationalism====
The mass arrival of Chinese farming settlers to Siam in 18th century introduced Capitalism to Siam. The past 150 years of growth encouraged phrai to flee the bonds of government control and become peasant farmers in the countryside to earn wealth. People fled the government phrai system in a variety of other ways, including entering the monkhood and fleeing into the wilderness.

A new category for people now appeared in the late Ayutthaya records, called phrai mangmi, or a rich &quot;serf&quot;.

From 1688 onwards, the period was characterized by the increasing severity of commoner revolts. The 1688 mass commoner revolt against French Catholicism was unprecedented in Ayutthaya history prior to 1688. The revolts of 1688 also marked the beginning of proto-nationalism, in which the concept of a proto-Siamese Buddhist nationality was formed. However, Ayutthaya kings only occasionally viewed themselves as the defender of &quot;the kingdom, people [sic], and Buddhism&quot;, which wouldn&#x27;t be fully realized until the Thonburi and Bangkok regimes in response to the traumatic destruction of the Siamese state in 1767.

====Nobility and Buddhism====
The 150 years of prosperity brought significant fortunes to the Ayutthaya elite. The Ayutthaya elite created theatre tropes and held elaborate celebrations, funeral ceremonies, and were awarded royal titles, all of which was previously privilege only to royalty.

Kings and nobles now contested with one another for control of the decreasing pool of labor. Repeated Ayutthaya laws on improving the controls of labor highlighted the increasing failures of the elite to control the people.

The turmoil which resulted from increasing wealth resulted in the Ayutthaya nobility turning towards the reformation of Buddhism as a new source of societal order. This was symbolized with the reign of King Borommakot (1733–1758), who was championed as a pious king for having all the characteristics of a virtuous and pious Bodhisattva: building and restoring new temples and dramatically transforming the Ayutthaya skyline during his reign. In 1753, following the request made by a delegation of Sri Lankan monks who traveled to Ayutthaya, Borommakot sent two Siamese monks to reform Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka.

It will however take until the early Rattanakosin period for the surviving Ayutthaya nobility (under the future King Rama I of the Rattanakosin Kingdom) to successfully reform Buddhism in their image and form a near unbroken bond between the Siamese monarchy and Buddhism lasting until the present in modern Thailand.

====Military and political situation to 1759====
In the period between 1600 and 1759, the scale of war subsided compared to the preceding era of warfare. Narai tried (and failed) to capture Chiang Mai in the 1650s and 1660s. Ayutthaya fought with the Nguyễn Lords (Vietnamese rulers of south Vietnam) for control of Cambodia starting around 1715. In contrast, the Ayutthaya Kingdom and the Restored Taungoo Burma overall generally engaged in harmonious relations with each other and traded an embassy with each other in the 17th century.

Ayutthaya&#x27;s military organization had remained virtually unchanged for the next 150 years. Ayutthaya still heavily relied on its mercenary forces. It had failed to create an elite military caste like the Samurai of Japan or the Sikh Rajputs, perhaps due to Ayutthaya kings purposely undermining the creation of such an elite group of warriors that can significantly influence or challenge the throne. On the other hand, the city of Ayutthaya relied on the wet season monsoons making the city impenetrable to a siege for six months a year. Ayutthaya had over time amassed a huge stockpile of large cannons and arms that amazed the Burmese when they opened the treasury of Ayutthaya in the sack of Ayutthaya in 1767. It however lacked the men to arm these weapons, with the failure of the Ayutthaya corvee system and increased economic incentives for phrai to escape due to greater integration with the world&#x27;s economy over the past 150 years of peace.

===Fall of Ayutthaya===

The weakened Burmese Toungoo dynasty was overthrown by the Mons of Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom in 1752. Aung Zeiya, a local Burmese leader, arose against the Mons and reconquered Upper Burma, proclaiming himself King Alaungpaya and establishing militaristic regime of the new Konbaung dynasty. Alaungpaya proceeded to conquer the Mons of Lower Burma in 1757, unifying Burma under his rule. Next year, in 1758, the Mons rebelled in Lower Burma against Alaungpaya but were quelled and took refuge in Siamese-held Tenasserim Coast. Alaungpaya demanded that Siam repatriate the Mon rebels but Ayutthaya was not cooperative. The Burmese king was then convinced that Siam supported the Mon rebels. Alaungpaya also sought to expand his powers and glory in accordance with &quot;Chakravartin&quot; ideology of universal ruler. Alaungpaya marched his war-hardened Burmese armies to attack Ayutthaya in mid-1759 conquering Tenasserim, coming through the Singkhon Pass and attacking on the way to northwestern outskirts of Ayutthaya city itself in early 1760. Ayutthaya was not prepared for war. Long absence of external threats and economic prosperity in the mid-eighteenth century rendered traditional conscription system useless and ineffective. Manpower shortage undermined Siamese defense system. Panicked Ayutthayan people beseeched the more-capable temple king Uthumphon to leave monkhood to lead the defenses. Fortunately, the treacherous wet rainy season arrived, obliging the Burmese to retreat. Alaungpaya himself was either ill and injured from cannon explosion, died on his way back to Burma in 1760. Ayutthaya was thus saved from Burmese conquest for one last time.

After the Burmese retreat, Siam did little to improve or reform its own military in preparation against Burmese invasions. Ekkathat pressured Uthumphon to return to monkhood permanently in mid-1760 and resumed powers. Prince Thepphiphit, who had been exiled to Ceylon previously in 1758, became involved in local rebellion and was repatriated to Siam in 1762, upsetting Ekkathat. The new Burmese king Hsinbyushin, who had partaken in the 1759–1760 invasion of Siam, was determined to accomplish the unfinished campaign of his father Alaungpaya to conquer Ayutthaya. Burma conquest of Lanna (modern Northern Thailand) in 1763 and Laos in 1765 allowed Burmese access to vast manpower. Hsinbyushin ordered the grand invasion of Ayutthaya through two routes; the Tavoy-Tenasserim route with 20,000 Burmese-Mon men under Maha Nawrahta and the Lanna route under Nemyo Thihapate with 20,000 Burmese-Lanna men. These two routes were to converge on Ayutthaya. In early 1765, the Burmese Tavoy regiment conquered Western Siam. In mid-1765, Nemyo Thihapate marched his Burmese-Lanna regiment to attack and conquer Northern Siam. Suppression of peripheral governors in response to internal rebellions meant that little could be provided for frontline defenses. Siamese peripheral cities fell to Burmese invaders one-by-one. Maha Nawrahta marched his main column from Tavoy to attack Ayutthaya in November 1765. William Powney, a British merchant who happened to be trading in Ayutthaya, led British-Siamese forces to attack the Burmese in the Battle of Nonthaburi in December 1765 but was defeated.

Two Burmese invading regiments eventually converged on Ayutthaya in January 1766 and laid siege. Maha Nawrahta placed his Tavoy regiment at Siguk (modern Bang Ban district) to the west of Ayutthaya in Nemyo Thihapate at Paknam Prasop (ฺBang Pahan district) to the north. Ayutthaya initially flaired well in the siege due to abundance of supplies as Ayutthayan defenders simply waited for rainy season to arrive. The Burmese, however, did not plan to leave. Bang Rachan camps, a group of self-defenders in Bang Rachan, managed to locally resist Burmese occupying forces for five months in early 1766. When the rainy season approached, the Burmese held their grounds by staying on flotillas and concentrated on high grounds. The Burmese approached Ayutthaya city walls in September 1766. In early 1766, due to conflicts over the Shan States, Qing China invaded Burma in the Sino-Burmese War. Burmese king Hsinbyushin urged his commanders to finish up the conquest of Ayutthaya in order to divert forces to the Chinese front. The besieging Burmese then constructed twenty-seven fort towers surrounding Ayutthaya to escalate the siege in January 1767. Situation for Ayutthayan defenders became dire as more Siamese people surrendered to the Burmese in escape from anarchy and starvation. Phraya Tak, a Siamese military man of Chinese heritage, upon realizing hopelessness in defenses of Ayutthaya, gathered men and broke through Burmese siege in January 1767 to seek for new position in Eastern Siam. French-Portuguese Christians and Chinese immigrants provided the last defense line south of Ayutthaya. In March 1767, Ekkathat attempted to reach for truce with the Burmese but failed. Shortly after that, Maha Nawrahta died, leaving Nemyo Thihapate to assume commands over all Burmese besiegers. The Burmese put down Chinese and Christian resistances in March 1767.

In April 1767, Nemyo Thihapate ordered the digging of underground tunnel into Ayutthaya, setting fire on the roots of the city walls, causing northeastern portion of city walls to collapse, allowing the Burmese to enter the city. After enduring fourteen months of siege, four-century-old Siamese royal capital of Ayutthaya finally fell to Burmese invaders on 7 April 1767. Unlike the previous fall of Ayutthaya in 1569, the Burmese destruction of Ayutthaya in April 1767 was permanent, profound and extensive. Palaces and temples were burnt to the grounds and inhabitants were indiscriminately slaughtered. Ekkathat, the last king of Ayutthaya, either died from starvation or random fatal gunshot. Treasures and cultural artifacts were seized. Buddha image of Phra Si Sanphet, stood at Wat Phra Si Sanphet Temple for two centuries and a half as the palladium of Ayutthaya kingdom, was destroyed and molten for gold. Estimated 200,000 Siamese people died during the war and 30,000 to 100,000 Siamese people, including the temple king Uthumphon, other members of Ban Phlu Luang dynasty and thousands of courtiers, were deported &quot;en masse&quot; from Central Thailand to Burmese capital of Ava. Burmese conquest of Siam in 1767 left Siam depopulated for about a century after until mid-nineteenth century. Nemyo Thihapate and Burmese victors left Ayutthaya in June 1767, leaving Mon commander Thugyi or Suki to be in charge of relatively small Burmese occupying forces at Phosamton north of Ayutthaya. Local regimes emerged from various regional centers due to absence of central authority.

Lieberman states that, &quot;hundreds of thousands possibly died during the [1765–67] Burmese invasion.&quot; Many people were either forcibly taken by the Burmese or fled into the forests. Objects were hauled back to Burma. Whatever that wasn&#x27;t movable was burned by Burmese soldiers. The fall of Ayutthaya was, paraphrasing historians Chris Baker and Pasuk Phongpaichit, &quot;a failure of defense, a failure of dealing with rising wealth&quot;. By 1767, Ayutthaya had become a prize that many kingdoms would have seek to acquire. In an age where warfare was fought among kings than ethnic boundaries, a number of Siamese joined the Burmese in the sack of Ayutthaya. Ayutthaya nobles who were seized from Ayutthaya settled according to their stations at the court of Ava and settled in well, according to the Burmese chronicles. To paraphrase the words of historian Nidhi Eoseewong, the &quot;kingdom fell even before the walls of Ayutthaya fell&quot;.

====Aftermath====
Ayutthaya however, according to Liberman, represented centuries of political and economic development that was hard to destroy. One general, Phraya Taksin, former governor of Tak and of Siamese-Chinese descent, began the reunification effort. He gathered his forces and retook the ruined capital of Ayutthaya from the Burmese garrison at Pho Sam Thon in June 1767, using his connections to the Chinese community to lend him significant resources and political support. He finally established a capital at Thonburi, across the Chao Phraya from the present capital, Bangkok. Taak-Sin ascended the throne, becoming known as King Taak-Sin or Taksin. By 1771, he reunited Siam (with the exception of the cities of Mergui and Tenasserim) and defeated all local warlords. The new conflict between Burma and Siam would last for another 50 years, depopulating large areas of Siam (including the Northern Cities and Phitsanulok, the former second capital of Ayutthaya) and leaving some areas deserted as late as the 1880s.

The palaces and temples that marked Ayutthaya as a royal capital was reduced to &quot;heaps of ruins and ashes&quot;. The city, described by a Danish visitor in 1779 to be a &quot;terrible spectacle&quot;, totally buried in undergrowth and inhabited by elephants and tigers,&quot; was resettled quite soon after, with former Ayutthaya temples being used for festivals and celebrations following the sack. According to one historian, the post-Ayutthaya monarchs were the real demolishers of the former capital, they took apart most of the ruins that survived the Burmese sack for the construction of the new capital at Bangkok for symbolic and practical reasons; Bangkok was the successor of Ayutthaya in the eyes of the new Bangkok elite and therefore had to transfer its spiritual power through the reuse of its bricks to build Bangkok while the prospect of future Burmese invasions meant that there was not enough time to build a capital via the traditional method during the early Rattanakosin Kingdom.

In its early maritime phase, Ayutthaya rulers were leaders of a port city. Ma Huan described the ruler of Ayutthaya in the 15th century as a ruler wearing gold-trimmed pants who rides on an elephant inspecting the city with one attendant and a ruler who lives in a modest-looking residence. Their relationships to the other cities were a first among equals status. Early Ayutthaya rulers had to balance their interests alongside those of their city vassal states. As Ayutthaya incorporated the Northern Cities and adapted their government functions in the 15th and 16th centuries, Ayutthaya rulers became more regal and assumed more power at the cost of their vassal cities. As the kings became richer through trade in the 17th century, they used their wealth to express their power, including the shrouding of the monarch in Angkorian and Brahmic rituals and symbolism.

The kings of Ayutthaya from the 17th century onwards were absolute monarchs with semi-religious status. Their authority derived from the ideologies of Hinduism and Buddhism as well as from natural leadership. The king of Sukhothai was the inspiration of Inscription 1 found in Sukhothai, which stated that King Ramkhamhaeng would hear the petition of any subject who rang the bell at the palace gate. The king was thus considered as a father by his people.

At Ayutthaya, however, the paternal aspects of kingship disappeared. The king was considered the &quot;chakkraphat&quot; (Sanskrit &quot;chakravartin&quot;) who through his adherence to the law made all the world revolve around him. According to Hindu tradition, the king is the avatar of Vishnu, destroyer of demons, who was born to be the defender of the people. The Buddhist belief in the king is as righteous ruler () who strictly follows the teaching of Gautama Buddha and aims at the well-being of his people.

The kings&#x27; official names were reflections of those religions: Hinduism and Buddhism. They were considered as the incarnation of various Hindu gods: Indra, Shiva, or Vishnu (Rama). The coronation ceremony was directed by brahmins as the Hindu god Shiva was &quot;lord of the universe&quot;. However, according to the codes, the king had the ultimate duty as protector of the people and the annihilator of evil.

According to Buddhism, the king was also believed to be a bodhisattva. One of the most important duties of the king was to build a temple or a Buddha statue as a symbol of prosperity and peace.

For locals, another aspect of the kingship was also the analogy of &quot;The Lord of the Land&quot; or &quot;He who Rules the Earth&quot; (&quot;Phra Chao Phaendin&quot;). According to the court etiquette, a special language, &quot;Rachasap&quot; (, &#x27;royal language&#x27;), was used to communicate with or about royalty. In Ayutthaya, the king was said to grant control over land to his subjects, from nobles to commoners, according to the &quot;sakna&quot; or &quot;sakdina&quot; system codified by King Borommatrailokkanat (1448–1488). The &quot;sakdina&quot; system was similar to, but not the same as feudalism, under which the monarch does not own the land. While there is no concrete evidence that this land management system constituted a formal palace economy, the French François-Timoléon de Choisy, who came to Ayutthaya in 1685, wrote, &quot;the king has absolute power. He is truly the god of the Siamese: no-one dares to utter his name.&quot; Another 17th century writer, the Dutchman Jan van Vliet, remarked that the King of Siam was &quot;honoured and worshipped by his subjects second to god.&quot; Laws and orders were issued by the king. For sometimes the king himself was also the highest judge who judged and punished important criminals such as traitors or rebels.

In addition to the &quot;sakdina&quot; system, another of the numerous institutional innovations of Borommatrailokkanat was to adopt the position of &quot;uparaja&quot;, translated as &#x27;viceroy&#x27; or &#x27;prince&#x27;, usually held by the king&#x27;s senior son or full brother, in an attempt to regularise the succession to the thronea particularly difficult feat for a polygamous dynasty. In practice, there was inherent conflict between king and &quot;uparaja&quot; and frequent disputed successions. However, it is evident that the power of the throne of Ayutthaya had its limits. The hegemony of the Ayutthaya king was always based on his charisma based on his age and supporters. Without supporters, bloody coups took place from time to time. The most powerful figures of the capital were always generals, or the Minister of Military Department, &quot;Kalahom&quot;. During the last century of Ayutthaya, bloody fighting among princes and generals, aiming at the throne, plagued the court.

With the exception of Naresuan&#x27;s succession by Ekathotsarot in 1605, &#x27;the method of royal succession at Ayutthaya throughout the seventeenth century was battle.&#x27; Although European visitors to Thailand at the time tried to discern any rules in the Siamese order of succession, noting that in practice the dead king&#x27;s younger brother often succeeded him, this custom appears not to have been enshrined anywhere. The ruling king did often bestow the title of &quot;uparaja&quot; upon his preferred successor, but in reality, it was an &#x27;elimination process&#x27;: any male member of the royal clan (usually the late king&#x27;s brothers and sons) could claim the throne of Ayutthaya for himself, and win by defeating all his rivals. Moreover, groupings of nobles, foreign merchants, and foreign mercenaries actively rallied behind their preferred candidates in hopes of benefiting from each war&#x27;s outcome.

===Mandala system===

Ayutthaya politically followed the mandala system, commonly used throughout Southeast Asia kingdoms before the 19th century. In the 17th century, the Ayutthaya monarchs were able to frequently appoint non-natives as governors of Ayutthaya-controlled towns and cities, in order to prevent competition from its nobility. By the end of the Ayutthaya period, the Siamese capital held strong sway over the polities in the lower Chao Phraya plain but had a gradually looser control of polities the further away from the capital at Ayutthaya. The Thai historian Sunait Chutintaranond notes, &quot;the view that Ayudhya was a strong centralized state&quot; did not hold and that &quot;in Ayudhya the hegemony of provincial governors was never successfully eliminated.&quot;

==Political development==
===Social classes===
The reforms of King Borommatrailokkanat (r. 1448–1488) placed the king of Ayutthaya at the centre of a highly stratified social and political hierarchy that extended throughout the realm. Despite a lack of evidence, it is believed that in the Ayutthaya Kingdom, the basic unit of social organization was the village community composed of extended family households. Title to land resided with the headman, who held it in the name of the community, although peasant proprietors enjoyed the use of land as long as they cultivated it. The lords gradually became courtiers () and tributary rulers of minor cities. The king ultimately came to be recognized as the earthly incarnation of Shiva or Vishnu and became the sacred object of politico-religious cult practices officiated over by royal court Brahmans, part of the Buddhist court retinue. In the Buddhist context, the &quot;devaraja&quot; (divine king) was a bodhisattva. The belief in divine kingship prevailed into the 18th century, although by that time its religious implications had limited impact.

===Ranking of social classes===
With ample reserves of land available for cultivation, the realm depended on the acquisition and control of adequate manpower for farm labor and defense. The dramatic rise of Ayutthaya had entailed constant warfare and, as none of the parties in the region possessed a technological advantage, the outcome of battles was usually determined by the size of the armies. After each victorious campaign, Ayutthaya carried a number of conquered people back to its own territory, where they were assimilated and added to the labour force. Ramathibodi II (r. 1491–1529) established a corvée system under which every freeman had to be registered as a &quot;phrai&quot; (servant) with the local lords, &quot;chao nai&quot; (). When war broke out, male &quot;phrai&quot; were subject to impressment. Above the &quot;phrai&quot; was a &quot;nai&quot; (), who was responsible for military service, labour on public works, and on the land of the official to whom he was assigned. &quot;Phrai Suay&quot; () met labour obligations by paying a tax. If he found the forced labour under his &quot;nai&quot; repugnant, he could sell himself as a &quot;that&quot; (, &#x27;slave&#x27;) to a more attractive &quot;nai&quot; or lord, who then paid a fee in compensation for the loss of corvée labour. As much as one-third of the manpower supply into the 19th century was composed of &quot;phrai&quot;.

Wealth, status, and political influence were interrelated. The king allotted rice fields to court officials, provincial governors, and military commanders, in payment for their services to the crown, according to the &quot;sakdina&quot; system. Understandings of this system have been evaluated extensively by Thai social scientists like Jit Phumisak and Kukrit Pramoj. The size of each official&#x27;s allotment was determined by the number of commoners or &quot;phrai&quot; he could command to work it. The amount of manpower a particular headman, or official, could command determined his status relative to others in the hierarchy and his wealth. At the apex of the hierarchy, the king, who was symbolically the realm&#x27;s largest landholder, theoretically commanded the services of the largest number of &quot;phrai&quot;, called &quot;phrai luang&quot; (&#x27;royal servants&#x27;), who paid taxes, served in the royal army, and worked on the crown lands.

However, the recruitment of the armed forces depended on &quot;nai&quot;, or &quot;mun nai&quot;, literally meaning &#x27;lord&#x27;, officials who commanded their own &quot;phrai som&quot;, or &#x27;subjects&#x27;. These officials had to submit to the king&#x27;s command when war broke out. Officials thus became the key figures in the kingdom&#x27;s politics. At least two officials staged coups, taking the throne themselves while bloody struggles between the king and his officials, followed by purges of court officials, were common.

King Borommatrailokkanat, in the early-16th century, established definite allotments of land and &quot;phrai&quot; for the royal officials at each rung in the hierarchy, thus determining the country&#x27;s social structure until the introduction of salaries for government officials in the 19th century.

Outside this system to some extent were the sangha (Buddhist monastic community), which all classes of men could join, and the overseas Chinese. Wats became centers of Thai education and culture, while during this period the Chinese first began to settle in Thailand and soon began to establish control over the country&#x27;s economic life.

The Chinese were not obliged to register for corvée duty, so they were free to move about the kingdom at will and engage in commerce. By the 16th century, the Chinese controlled Ayutthaya&#x27;s internal trade and had found important places in civil and military service. Most of these men took Thai wives as few women left China to accompany the men.
Uthong was responsible for the compilation of a &quot;Dharmaśāstra&quot;, a legal code based on Hindu sources and traditional Thai custom. The &quot;Dharmaśāstra&quot; remained a tool of Thai law until late in the 19th century. A bureaucracy based on a hierarchy of ranked and titled officials was introduced, and society was organized in a related manner. However, the caste system was not adopted.

The 16th century witnessed the rise of Burma, which had overrun Chiang Mai in the Burmese-Siamese War of 1563–1564. In 1569, Burmese forces, joined by Thai rebels, mostly royal family members of Thailand, captured the city of Ayutthaya and carried off the whole royal family to Burma (Burmese-Siamese War 1568–1570). Thammarachathirat (1569–1590), a Thai governor who had aided the Burmese, was installed as vassal king at Ayutthaya. Thai independence was restored by his son, King Naresuan (1590–1605), who turned on the Burmese and by 1600 had driven them from the country.

Determined to prevent another treason like his father&#x27;s, Naresuan set about unifying the country&#x27;s administration directly under the royal court at Ayutthaya. He ended the practice of nominating royal princes to govern Ayutthaya&#x27;s provinces, assigning instead court officials who were expected to execute policies handed down by the king. Thereafter royal princes were confined to the capital. Their power struggles continued, but at court under the king&#x27;s watchful eye.
To ensure his control over the new class of governors, Naresuan decreed that all freemen subject to &quot;phrai&quot; service had become &quot;phrai luang&quot;, bound directly to the king, who distributed the use of their services to his officials. This measure gave the king a theoretical monopoly on all manpower, and the idea developed that since the king owned the services of all the people, he also possessed all the land. Ministerial offices and governorshipsand the sakdina that went with themwere usually inherited positions dominated by a few families often connected to the king by marriage. Indeed, marriage was frequently used by Thai kings to cement alliances between themselves and powerful families, a custom prevailing through the 19th century. As a result of this policy, the king&#x27;s wives usually numbered in the dozens.

Even with Naresuan&#x27;s reforms, the effectiveness of the royal government over the next 150 years was unstable. Royal power outside the crown landsin theory, absolutewas in practice limited by the laxity of the civil administration. The influence of central government and the king was not extensive beyond the capital. When war with the Burmese broke out in the late 18th century, provinces easily abandoned the capital. As the enforcing troops were not easily rallied to defend the capital, the city of Ayutthaya could not stand against the Burmese aggressors.

===Military===

Ayutthaya&#x27;s military was the origin of the Royal Thai Army. The army was organized into a small standing army of a few thousand, which defended the capital and the palace, and a much larger conscript-based wartime army. Conscription was based on the &quot;Phrai&quot; system (including phrai luang and phrai som), which required local chiefs to supply their predetermined quota of men from their jurisdiction on the basis of population in times of war. This basic system of military organization was largely unchanged down to the early Rattanakosin period.

The main weaponry of the infantry largely consisted of swords, spears and bow and arrows. The infantry units were supported by cavalry and elephantry corps.

===Territory===
According to a French source, Ayutthaya in the 18th century included these principal cities: Martaban, Ligor or Nakhon Sri Thammarat, Tenasserim, Junk Ceylon or Phuket Island, Singora or Songkhla. Her tributaries were Patani, Pahang, Perak, Kedah and Malacca.

Particularly in the South, Ayutthaya&#x27;s claims were often discredited or underplayed by the Malay sultanates, resulting in some number of military expeditions starting in the 17th and 18th centuries to subjugate querulous sultanates, most infamously with King Narai&#x27;s military expedition to the Sultanate of Singora in 1680.

==Culture and society==
===Population===
For the entirety of the Ayutthaya Kingdom&#x27;s duration, it was largely managed by a society of a service nobility composed of a few thousand and serfs (phrai) composed of the rest of the population, comparable to the contemporary Ancien Regime in France or Feudalism in the rest of Europe. The social ladder existed during times of war and, particularly during the late Ayutthaya period, of rich commoners challenging the societal status quo of the Ayutthaya Kingdom as a result of commercial prosperity during the kingdom&#x27;s last 150 years of peaceful existence.

According to the historian Chris Baker, the Ayutthaya peasantry practiced commuter agriculturalism and largely lived in dense areas along the canals leading up to the city of Ayutthaya and other cities within the kingdom, producing homemade goods and textiles for the international market.

===Language===
The Siamese (Thai) language was initially spoken only by the Ayutthaya elite, but gradually grew to transcend social classes and becoming widespread throughout the kingdom by the Late Ayutthaya period (1688–1767), although the Mon language was spoken among everyday people throughout the Chao Phraya delta until as late as 1515. The Khmer language was an early prestige language of the Ayutthaya court, until it was supplanted by the Siamese language. However it was still continually spoken by the ethnic Khmer community living in Ayutthaya. Many variants of Chinese were spoken in the Ayutthaya Kingdom, with the Chinese becoming a large minority in the kingdom during the Late Ayutthaya period.

Various minor minority languages spoken in the Ayutthaya Kingdom included Malay, Persian, Japanese, Cham, Dutch, and Portuguese.

===Religion===

Ayutthaya&#x27;s main religion was Theravada Buddhism. However, many of the elements of the political and social system were incorporated from Hindu scriptures and were conducted by Brahmin priests. Many areas of the kingdom also practiced Mahayana Buddhism, Islam and, influenced by French Missionaries who arrived through China in the 17th century, some small areas converted to Roman Catholicism. The influence of Mahayana and Tantric practices also entered Theravada Buddhism, producing a tradition called Tantric Theravada.

The natural world was also home to a number of spirits which are part of the Satsana Phi. &quot;Phi&quot; () are spirits of buildings or territories, natural places, or phenomena; they are also ancestral spirits that protect people, or can also include malevolent spirits. The &quot;phi&quot; which are guardian deities of places, or towns are celebrated at festivals with communal gatherings and offerings of food. The spirits run throughout Thai folklore.

&quot;Phi&quot; were believed to influence natural phenomena including human illness and thus the baci became an important part of people identity and religious health over the millennia. Spirit houses were an important folk custom which were used to ensure balance with the natural and supernatural world. Astrology was also a vital part to understanding the natural and spiritual worlds and became an important cultural means to enforce social taboos and customs.

===Arts and performances===

The myth and epic stories of Ramakien provide the Siamese with a rich source of dramatic materials. The royal court of Ayutthaya developed classical dramatic forms of expression called &quot;khon&quot; () and &quot;lakhon&quot; (). &quot;Ramakien&quot; played a role in shaping these dramatic arts. During the Ayutthaya period, &quot;khon&quot;, or a dramatized version of Ramakien, was classified as &quot;lakhon nai&quot; or a theatrical performance reserved only for aristocratic audience. The Siamese drama and classical dance later spread throughout mainland Southeast Asia and influenced the development of high-culture art in most countries, including Burma, Cambodia, and Laos.

Historical evidence shows that the Thai art of stage plays must have already been highly evolved by the 17th century. Louis XIV, the Sun King of France, had a formal diplomatic relation with Ayutthaya&#x27;s King Narai. In 1687, France sent the diplomat Simon de la Loubère to record all that he saw in the Siamese Kingdom. In his famous account &quot;Du Royaume de Siam&quot;, La Loubère carefully observed the classic 17th century theatre of Siam, including an epic battle scene from a khon performance, and recorded what he saw in great detail:

Of the attire of Siamese Khôn dancers, La Loubère recorded that, &quot;[T]hose that dance in Rabam, and Cone, have gilded paper-bonnets, high and pointed, like the Mandarins caps of ceremony, but which hang down at the sides below their ears, which are adorned with counterfeit stones, and with two pendants of gilded wood.&quot;
La Loubère also observed the existence of muay Thai and muay Laos, noting that they looked similar (i.e., using both fists and elbows to fight) but the hand-wrapping techniques were different. Muay Thai from the Ayuthtaya period (better known as Muay Boran) would greatly influence the modern sport of Muay Thai.

The accomplishment and influence of Thai art and culture, developed during the Ayutthaya period, on the neighboring countries was evident in the observation of James Low, a British scholar on Southeast Asia, during the early-Rattanakosin Era: &quot;The Siamese have attained to a considerable degree of perfection in dramatic exhibitions – and are in this respect envied by their neighbours the Burmans, Laos, and Cambojans who all employ Siamese actors when they can be got.&quot;

Krabi-krabong is a form of sword fighting developed in Ayutthaya that is now recognized as an essential element of traditional Thai culture and arts. Wat Phutthaisawan, a major ancient temple in Ayutthaya, is considered to be the birthplace of krabi-krabong.

===Literature===

Ayutthaya was a kingdom rich in literary production. Even after the sack of Ayutthaya in 1767, many literary masterpieces in the Thai language survived. However, Ayutthayan literature (as well as Thai literature before the modern era) was dominated by verse composition (i.e., poetry), whereas prose works were reserved to legal matters, records of state affairs and historical chronicles. Thus, there are many works in the nature of epic poetry in the Thai language. The Thai poetical tradition was originally based on indigenous poetical forms such as &quot;rai&quot; (ร่าย), &quot;khlong&quot; (โคลง), &quot;kap&quot; (กาพย์) and &quot;klon&quot; (กลอน). Some of these poetical formsnotably &quot;khlong&quot;have been shared between the speakers of tai languages since ancient time (before the emergence of Siam).

====Sanskrit influence on the Siamese language====

Through Buddhist and Hindu influence, a variety of &quot;Chanda&quot; prosodic meters were received via Ceylon. Since the Thai language is mono-syllabic, a huge number of loan words from Sanskrit and Pali are needed to compose these classical Sanskrit meters. According to B.J. Terwiel, this process occurred with an accelerated pace during the reign of King Borommatrailokkanat (1448–1488) who reformed Siam&#x27;s model of governance by turning the Siamese polity into an empire under the mandala feudal system. The new system demanded a new imperial language for the noble class. This literary influence changed the course of the Thai or Siamese language, setting it apart from other &quot;tai&quot; languages, by increasing the number of Sanskrit and Pali words drastically and imposing the demand on the Thais to develop a writing system that preserves the orthography of Sanskrit words for literary purpose. By the 15th century, the Thai language had evolved into a distinctive medium along with a nascent literary identity of a new nation. It allowed Siamese poets to compose in different poetical styles and mood, from playful and humorous rimed verses, to romantic and elegant &quot;klong&quot; and to polished and imperious &quot;chan&quot; prosodies modified from classical Sanskrit meters. Thai poets experimented with these different prosodic forms, producing innovative &quot;hybrid&quot; poems such as &quot;Lilit&quot; (, an interleave of &quot;khlong&quot; and &quot;kap&quot; or &quot;rai&quot; verses) or &quot;Kap hor Klong&quot; ( – &quot;khlong&quot; poems enveloped by &quot;kap&quot; verses). The Thai thus developed a keen mind and a keen ear for poetry. To maximize this new literary medium, however, an intensive classical education in Pali was required. This made poetry an exclusive occupation of the noble classes. However, B.J. Terwiel notes, citing a 17th-century text book &quot;Jindamanee&quot;, that scribes and common Siamese men, too, were encouraged to learn basic Pali and Sanskrit for career advancement.

====&quot;Ramakien&quot;====
Most countries in Southeast Asia share an Indianised culture. Traditionally, therefore, Thai literature was heavily influenced by the Indian culture and Buddhist–Hindu ideology since the time it first appeared in the 13th century. Thailand&#x27;s national epic is a version of the story of Rama-Pandita, as recounted by Gotama Buddha in the Dasharatha Jataka called the Ramakien, translated from Pali and rearranged into Siamese verses. The importance of the Ramayana epic in Thailand is due to the Thai&#x27;s adoption of the Hindu religio-political ideology of kingship, as embodied by Rama. The Siamese capital, Ayutthaya, was named after the holy city of Ayodhya, the city of Rama. Thai kings of the current dynasty from Rama VI forward, and retroactively, have been referred to as &quot;Rama&quot; to the present day (relations with the west caused the crown to seek a brief name to convey royalty to both Thais and foreigners, following European styles).

A number of versions of the Ramakien epic were lost in the destruction of Ayutthaya in 1767. Three versions currently exist. One of these was prepared under the supervision (and partly written by) King Rama I. His son, Rama II, rewrote some parts for khon drama. The main differences from the original are an extended role for the monkey god Hanuman and the addition of a happy ending. Many of popular poems among the Thai nobles are also based on Indian stories. One of the most famous is Anirut Kham Chan which is based on an ancient Indian story of Prince Anirudha.

====Khun Chang Khun Phaen: the Siamese epic folk poem====
In the Ayutthaya period, folktales also flourished. One of the most famous folktales is the story of &quot;Khun Chang Khun Phaen&quot; (), referred to in Thailand simply as &quot;Khun Phaen&quot;, which combines the elements of romantic comedy and heroic adventures, ending in high tragedy. The epic of &quot;Khun Chang Khun Phaen&quot; (KCKP) revolves around &quot;Khun Phaen&quot;, a Siamese general with superhuman magical powers who served the King of Ayutthaya, and his love-triangle relationship between himself, Khun Chang, and a beautiful Siamese girl named Wan-Thong. The composition of KCKP, much like other orally-transmitted epics, evolved over time. It originated as a recitation or &quot;sepha&quot; within the Thai oral tradition from around the beginning of the 17th century (c. 1600). Siamese troubadours and minstrels added more subplots and embellished scenes to the original story line as time went on. By the late period of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, it had attained the current shape as a long work of epic poem with the length of about 20,000 lines, spanning 43 &quot;samut thai&quot; books. The version that exists today was composed with &quot;klon&quot; meter throughout and is referred to in Thailand as &quot;nithan Kham Klon&quot; () meaning a &#x27;poetic tale&#x27;.

===Architecture===
The Ayutthaya Buddhist temple falls into one of two broad categories: the &quot;stupa&quot;-style solid temple and the &quot;prang&quot;-style (). The prangs can also be found in various forms in Sukhothai, Lopburi, Bangkok (Wat Arun). Sizes may vary, but usually the prangs measure between 15 and 40 meters in height, and resemble a towering corn-cob like structure.

Prangs essentially represent Mount Meru. In Thailand Buddha relics were often housed in a vault in these structures, reflecting the belief that the Buddha is a most significant being, having attained enlightenment and having shown the path to enlightenment to others.

====Clothing====
Three clothing styles were evident in the Ayutthaya period. Each style depended on social class.

1. Court clothing (worn by the king, queen, concubines, and senior government officials): 
*Men: The king wore &quot;mongkut&quot; (), as headgear, round Mandarin collar with &quot;khrui&quot; and wore &quot;chong kben&quot; (), as trousers. 
**Court officers, (who served in the royal palace) wore &quot;lomphok&quot;, as headgear, &quot;khrui&quot;, and wore &quot;chong kben&quot;.
*Women The queen wore &quot;chada&quot; (), as headgear, &quot;sabai&quot; (), (a breast cloth that wrap over one shoulder around chest and back) and wore &quot;pha nung&quot; (), as a skirt. 
** Concubines wore long hair, &quot;sabai&quot;, and &quot;pha nung&quot;.
2. Nobles (rich citizens):
*Men: wore mandarin collar shirt, a &quot;mahadthai&quot; hair style (), and wore &quot;chong kben&quot;. 
*Women: wore the &quot;sabai&quot; and &quot;pha nung&quot;.
3. Villagers: 
*Men: wore a loincloth, displayed a naked chest, a &quot;mahadthai&quot; hair style, sometimes wore &quot;sarong&quot; or &quot;chong kben&quot;. 
*Women: wore the &quot;sabai&quot; and &quot;pha nung&quot;.

==Economy==
The Thais never lacked a rich food supply. Peasants planted rice for their own consumption and to pay taxes. Whatever remained was used to support religious institutions. From the 13th to the 15th centuries, however, a transformation took place in Thai rice cultivation. In the highlands, where rainfall had to be supplemented by a system of irrigation to control water levels in flooded paddies, the Thais sowed the glutinous rice that is still the staple in the geographical regions of the north and northeast. But in the floodplain of the Chao Phraya, farmers turned to a different variety of ricethe so-called floating rice, a slender, non-glutinous grain introduced from Bengalthat would grow fast enough to keep pace with the rise of the water level in the lowland fields.

The new strain grew easily and abundantly, producing a surplus that could be sold cheaply abroad. Ayutthaya, at the southern extremity of the floodplain, thus became the hub of economic activity. Under royal patronage, corvée labour dug canals on which rice was brought from the fields to the king&#x27;s ships for export to China. In the process, the Chao Phraya deltamud flats between the sea and firm land hitherto considered unsuitable for habitationwas reclaimed and cultivated. Traditionally the king had a duty to perform a religious ceremony to bless the rice planting.

Although rice was abundant in Ayutthaya, rice exports were banned from time to time when famine occurred because of natural calamity or war. Rice was usually bartered for luxury goods and armaments from Westerners, but rice cultivation was mainly for the domestic market and rice export was evidently unreliable.

===Trade and currency===
Ayutthaya officially used cowrie shells, &quot;prakab&quot; (baked clay coins), and &quot;pod duang&quot; as currencies. &quot;Pod duang&quot; became the standard medium of exchange from the early-13th century to the reign of King Chulalongkorn.

===Ayutthaya as international trading port===
Trade with Europeans was lively in the 17th century. In fact European merchants traded their goods, mainly modern arms such as rifles and cannons, for local products from the inland jungle such as &quot;sappan&quot; (lit. &#x27;bridge&#x27;) woods, deerskin, and rice. Tomé Pires, a Portuguese voyager, mentioned in the 16th century that Ayutthaya, or &quot;Odia&quot;, was &quot;rich in good merchandise&quot;. Most of the foreign merchants coming to Ayutthaya were European and Chinese, and were taxed by the authorities. The kingdom had an abundance of rice, salt, dried fish, arrack, and vegetables.

Trade with foreigners, mainly the Dutch, reached its peak in the 17th century. Ayutthaya became a main destination for merchants from China and Japan. It was apparent that foreigners began taking part in the kingdom&#x27;s politics. Ayutthaya&#x27;s kings employed foreign mercenaries who sometimes joined the wars with the kingdom&#x27;s enemies. However, after the purge of the French in the late-17th century, the major traders with Ayutthaya were the Chinese. The Dutch from the Dutch East Indies Company (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie or VOC), were still active. Ayutthaya&#x27;s economy declined rapidly in the 18th century, until the Burmese invasion caused the total collapse of Ayutthaya&#x27;s economy in 1767.

====Contacts with the West====

In 1511, immediately after having conquered Malacca, the Portuguese sent a diplomatic mission headed by Duarte Fernandes to the court of King Ramathibodi II of Ayutthaya. Having established amicable relations between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Kingdom of Siam, they returned with a Siamese envoy who carried gifts and letters to the King of Portugal. The Portuguese were the first Europeans to visit the country. Portuguese mercenaries would also play a major role in the invasion of Lanna in 1539 by King Chairachathirat, and Portuguese soldiers would be considered a respected fighting force for the Kingdom across its existence. Five years after that initial contact, Ayutthaya and Portugal concluded a treaty granting the Portuguese permission to trade in the kingdom. A similar treaty in 1592 gave the Dutch a privileged position in the rice trade.

Foreigners were cordially welcomed at the court of Narai (1657–1688), a ruler with a cosmopolitan outlook who was nonetheless wary of outside influence. Important commercial ties were forged with Japan. Dutch and English trading companies were allowed to establish factories, and Thai diplomatic missions were sent to Paris and The Hague. By maintaining these ties, the Thai court skillfully played off the Dutch against the English and the French, avoiding the excessive influence of a single power.

In 1664, however, the Dutch used force to exact a treaty granting them extraterritorial rights as well as freer access to trade. At the urging of his foreign minister, the Greek adventurer Constantine Phaulkon, Narai turned to France for assistance. French engineers constructed fortifications for the Thais and built a new palace at Lopburi for Narai. In addition, French missionaries engaged in education and medicine and brought the first printing press into the country. Louis XIV&#x27;s personal interest was aroused by reports from missionaries suggesting that Narai might be converted to Christianity.

The French presence encouraged by Phaulkon, however, stirred the resentment and suspicions of the Thai nobles and Buddhist clergy. When word spread that Narai was dying, a general, Phetracha (reigned 1688–1693) staged a coup d&#x27;état, the 1688 Siamese revolution, seized the throne, killed the designated heir, a Christian, and had Phaulkon put to death along with a number of missionaries. He then expelled the remaining foreigners. Some studies said that Ayutthaya began a period of alienation from European traders, while welcoming more Chinese merchants. But other recent studies argue that, due to wars and conflicts in Europe in the mid-18th century, European merchants reduced their activities in the East. However, it was apparent that the Dutch East Indies Company or VOC was still doing business in Ayutthaya despite political difficulties.

====Contacts with East Asia====

Between 1405 and 1433, the Chinese Ming dynasty sponsored a series of seven naval expeditions. Emperor Yongle designed them to establish a Chinese presence, impose imperial control over trade, and impress foreign peoples in the Indian Ocean basin. He also might have wanted to extend the tributary system. It is believed that the Chinese fleet under Admiral Zheng He travelled up the Chao Phraya River to Ayutthaya on three occasions.

Meanwhile, a Japanese colony was established in Ayutthaya. The colony was active in trade, particularly in the export of deer hides and saphan wood to Japan in exchange for Japanese silver and Japanese handicrafts (swords, lacquered boxes, high-quality paper). From Ayutthaya, Japan was interested in purchasing Chinese silks, as well as deerskins and ray or shark skins (used to make a sort of shagreen for Japanese sword handles and scabbards).

The Japanese quarters of Ayutthaya were home to about 1,500 Japanese inhabitants (some estimates run as high as 7,000). The community was called &quot;Ban Yipun&quot; in Thai, and was headed by a Japanese chief nominated by Thai authorities. It seems to have been a combination of traders, Christian converts (&quot;Kirishitan&quot;) who had fled their home country to various Southeast Asian countries following the persecutions of Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu, and unemployed former samurai who had been on the losing side at the battle of Sekigahara.

Padre António Francisco Cardim recounted having administered the sacrament to around 400 Japanese Christians in 1627 in the Thai capital of Ayuthaya (&quot;a 400 japoes christaos&quot;) There were also Japanese communities in Ligor and Patani.

==Historiography==
===Contemporary accounts of Ayutthaya===

The amount to which Ayutthaya texts were destroyed in the Burmese sack of 1767 varies greatly. Van Vliet&#x27;s written records on Siam is the earliest written history of Siam and Ayutthaya, which date from the early to mid 17th century and likely used the religious temple chronicles as his source. The earliest surviving palace chronicle is the Luang Prasoet chronicle, which dates from 1681. The histories of Ayutthaya was not regarded as important until the age of commerce and peace in the 17th and 18th centuries. Early Ayutthaya did not write down its history. The religious chronicles are also important to understanding Ayutthaya, which date as early as the 16th century. Early Ayutthaya did not write down its history. A significant portion of written evidence must therefore come from outside accounts. Aside from Van Vliet, a number of Europeans in the 17th and early 18th century wrote surviving accounts of Siam. The Chinese palace chronicles are also instrumental in analyzing Ayutthaya&#x27;s history.

The Ayutthaya Testimonies are another important account of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. Based on the testimonies of the former inhabitants of the Ayutthaya Kingdom and survived by three different documents, these accounts attests to the description of the city of Ayutthaya and the Ayutthaya Kingdom prior to and during its fall in 1767.

===Post-Ayutthaya historiography===
The history of the Ayutthaya Kingdom overall has been a neglected period of historiography in Thailand, as well as abroad, characterized by well-researched and popular histories of subperiods of Ayutthaya. Chris Baker and Pasuk Phongpaichit&#x27;s &quot;A History of Ayutthaya: Siam In the Early Modern World&quot;, published in 2017, was the first English-academic book to have analyzed the full four hundred years of the Ayutthaya Kingdom&#x27;s existence. The historiography of Southeast Asia originated from post-colonial capitals. As Thailand had never been fully colonized, it never had a European patron from which national histories could be written about themselves until the arrival of the Americans in the 1960s.

In the early Rattanakosin period, King Rama I compiled all surviving Ayutthaya law records and published the Three Seals Law in 1805. Early Rattanakosin period documents traced their &quot;national&quot; origins to the founding of Ayutthaya in 1351. In the early 20th-century however, Thai elites, influenced by Western ideas of European nationalism and the nation state, used that framework to create a nationalist history of Thailand, implementing it in ways deemphasized Ayutthaya&#x27;s importance to Thai history by portraying the Sukhothai Kingdom as the first &quot;Thai&quot; kingdom or golden age of &quot;Thai-ness&quot; (Buddhism, Thai-style democracy, free trade, abolition of slavery), Rattanakosin as the &quot;rebirth&quot;, and Ayutthaya as a period of decline between Sukhothai and Rattanakosin. This resulted in Ayutthaya being largely forgotten in the historiography of Thailand for half a century following the works of Prince Damrong in the early 20th century.

The nationalist-themed histories of Ayutthaya, pioneered by Prince Damrong, primarily featured the stories of kings fighting wars and the idea of territorial subjugation of neighboring states. These historical themes remains influential in Thailand and in Thai popular history up until the present, which has only been challenged by a newer generation of historians and academics in Thailand and abroad starting in the 1980s, emphasizing the long-neglected commercial and economic aspects which were important to Ayutthaya. New released sources and translations from a variety of historical records (China, the Netherlands, etc...) have made the researching of Ayutthaya history more accessible in the past two and three decades.

Since the 1970s, newer generations of academics have come up and challenged the old historiography, paying more attention and publishing works about the history of Ayutthaya, prominently beginning with Charnvit Kasetsiri&#x27;s &quot;The Rise of Ayudhya&quot;, published in 1977. Kasetsiri, in 1999, argues that, &quot;Ayutthaya was the first major political, cultural, and commercial center of the Thai.&quot;

===The &quot;General Crisis&quot; hypothesis===

The idea that Ayutthaya suffered a decline following the departure of Europeans in the late 17th century was an idea popularized, at first, in the Rattanakosin court, in an attempt to legitimize the new dynasty over the Ayutthaya Ban Phlu Luang dynasty, and more famously by Anthony Reid&#x27;s book on the &quot;Age of Commerce&quot; in recent decades. However, more recent studies, such as by Victor Lieberman in &quot;Strange Parallels in Southeast Asia&quot; and by Baker and Phongpaichit in &quot;A History of Ayutthaya&quot;, have mostly refuted Reid&#x27;s hypothesis, in particular Lieberman criticizing Reid&#x27;s methodology of using the example of Maritime Southeast Asia to explain Mainland Southeast Asia, citing the opening of Qing China&#x27;s revocation of its maritime ban and the subsequent increase in trade between China and Siam and Ayutthaya&#x27;s historical importance as a regional Asian trade center rather than one in which Europeans held any power or any significant influence for any extended period of time.
