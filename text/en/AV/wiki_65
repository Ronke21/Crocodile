<text>Emilio Stanley Mwai Kibaki (15 November 1931 – 21 April 2022) was a Kenyan politician who served as the third President of Kenya from December 2002 until April 2013.
He served in various leadership positions in Kenya&#x27;s government including being the longest serving Member of Parliament (MP) in Kenya from 1963 to 2013.

He had previously served as the fourth Vice-President of Kenya for ten years from 1978 to 1988 under President Daniel arap Moi. He also held cabinet ministerial positions in the Jomo Kenyatta and Daniel arap Moi governments, including as minister for Finance (1969–1981) under Kenyatta, and Minister for Home Affairs (1982–1988) and Minister for Health (1988–1991) under Moi.

Kibaki served as an opposition Member of Parliament from 1992 to 2002. He unsuccessfully vied for the presidency in 1992 and 1997. He served as the Leader of the Official Opposition in Parliament from 1998 to 2002. Following the 2002 presidential election, he was elected as President of Kenya.

==Early life and education==
Kibaki was born on 15 November 1931 in Gatuyaini village, Othaya division of Kenya&#x27;s then Nyeri District (now Nyeri County). He was the youngest son of Kikuyu peasants Kibaki Gĩthĩnji and Teresia Wanjikũ. Though baptised as Emilio Stanley by Italian missionaries in his youth, he has been known as Mwai Kibaki throughout his public life. Kibaki started his schooling at the village school in Gatuyaini, where he completed two years. He then continued his education at the Karima mission school, close to Othaya town, before moving to Mathari School (now Nyeri High School) between 1944 and 1946. In addition to his academic studies, he learned carpentry and masonry at the school. After Karima Primary and Nyeri Boarding primary schools, he proceeded to Mang&#x27;u High School, where he studied between 1947 and 1950, gaining the highest grade in his O Level examinations.

In his last year at Mang&#x27;u, Kibaki briefly considered enlisting in the army, but this ambition was thwarted when Kenya&#x27;s Chief colonial secretary, Walter Coutts, prohibited members of Kikuyu, Embu, and Meru communities from joining the military. Kibaki instead attended Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, where he studied economics, history, and political science. He graduated with a first class honours degree in economics. After graduation, Kibaki remained in Uganda, working for the Shell Company of East Africa. He then earned a scholarship entitling him to undertake postgraduate studies at any British university. He chose the London School of Economics, from which he obtained a BSc in public finance, with distinction. In 1958, he went back to Makerere, where he taught as an assistant lecturer in the economics department until 1961. In 1961, Kibaki married Lucy Muthoni, the daughter of a church minister, who was then a secondary school head teacher.

==Political career prior to presidency==
===1960–2002===
In early 1960, Mwai Kibaki left academia for active politics by giving up his job at Makerere and returning to Kenya to become an executive officer of Kenya African National Union (KANU), at the request of Thomas Joseph Mboya (who was the secretary general of KANU). Kibaki then helped to draft Kenya&#x27;s independence constitution.

In 1963, Kibaki was elected as Member of Parliament for the Doonholm Constituency (subsequently called Bahati and now known as Makadara) in Nairobi. His election was the start of a long political career. In 1963 Kibaki was appointed the Permanent Secretary for the Treasury. Appointed Assistant Minister of Finance and chairman of the Economic Planning Commission in 1963, he was promoted to Minister of Commerce and Industry in 1966. In 1969, he became Minister of Finance and Economic Planning where he served until 1982.

In 1974, Kibaki, facing serious competition for his Doonholm Constituency seat from an opponent Mrs. Jael Mbogo, whom he had only narrowly and controversially beaten for the seat in the 1969 elections, moved his political base from Nairobi to his rural home, Othaya, where he was subsequently elected as Member of Parliament. The same year &quot;Time magazine&quot; rated him among the top 100 people in the world who had the potential to lead. He was re-elected Member of Parliament for Othaya in the subsequent elections of 1979, 1983, 1988, 1992, 1997, 2002, and 2007.

When Daniel arap Moi succeeded Jomo Kenyatta as President of Kenya in 1978, Kibaki was elevated to the Vice Presidency, and kept the Finance portfolio until Moi changed his ministerial portfolio from Finance to Home Affairs in 1982. He had in 1978 rejected an offer to become World Bank Vice President for Africa instead choosing to further his political career. As of 2023, he is still regarded as one of the most effective and consequential finance ministers of the Republic of Kenya. Later as President, he kept close tabs with the treasury and directly influenced key economic policies resulting in steady economic growth. Kibaki fell out of favor with President Moi in March 1988, and was dropped as vice president and moved to the Ministry of Health.

Kibaki&#x27;s political style during these years was described as gentlemanly and non-confrontational. This style exposed him to criticism that he was a spineless, or even cowardly, politician who never took a stand: according to one joke, &quot;He never saw a fence he didn&#x27;t sit on&quot;. Similarly, Kenneth Matiba also referred to him as &quot;General Kiguoya&quot; for refusing to resign the Kanu government and join the opposition after he was dropped as vice president in 1988. &#x27;Kiguoya&#x27; translates to the &#x27;fearful one&#x27; in the Kikuyu language. He also, as the political circumstances of the time dictated, projected himself as a loyal stalwart of the ruling single party, KANU. In the months before multi-party politics were introduced in 1992, he infamously declared that agitating for multi-party democracy and trying to dislodge KANU from power was like &quot;trying to cut down a fig tree with a razor blade&quot;.

It was therefore with great surprise that the country received the news of Kibaki&#x27;s resignation from government and leaving KANU on Christmas Day in December 1991, only days after the repeal of Section 2A of the then Constitution of Kenya, which restored the multi-party system of government. Soon after his resignation, Kibaki founded the Democratic Party (DP) and entered the presidential race in the upcoming multi-party elections of 1992. Kibaki was regarded as one of the favourites among Moi&#x27;s challengers, although his support came mainly from the Kikuyu voters as the election was fought along ethnic lines, confirming a prediction made by both Moi and political analysts at the beginning of multipartyism.

Kibaki came third in the subsequent presidential elections of 1992, when the divided opposition lost to president Moi and KANU despite having received more than two-thirds of the vote. He then came second to Moi in the 1997 elections, when again, Moi beat a divided opposition to retain the presidency. Kibaki joined third-placed Raila Odinga in accusing the president of rigging the poll, and both opposition leaders boycotted Moi&#x27;s swearing in for his fifth term in office.

===2002 elections===
In preparation for the 2002 elections, Kibaki&#x27;s Democratic Party affiliated with several other opposition parties to form the National Alliance of Kenya (NAK). A group of disappointed KANU presidential aspirants then quit KANU in protest after being overlooked by outgoing President Moi when Moi had Uhuru Kenyatta (founding Father Jomo Kenyatta&#x27;s son and Kibaki&#x27;s successor as Kenya&#x27;s 4th President after the 2013 General Election) nominated to be the KANU presidential candidate, and hurriedly formed the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). NAK later combined with the LDP to form the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC). On 14 October 2002, at a large opposition rally in Uhuru Park, Nairobi, Kibaki was nominated the NARC opposition alliance presidential candidate after Raila Odinga made the famous declaration; &quot;Kibaki Tosha!&quot; (Swahili for &quot;Kibaki [is] enough&quot;)

On 3 December 2002, Kibaki was injured in a road accident while on his way back to Nairobi from a campaign meeting at Machakos junction from Nairobi. He was subsequently hospitalized in Nairobi, then London, after sustaining fracture injuries in the accident. After the accident, he had to move using a wheel chair up to months later after his presidency. For the remainder of his life, he walked rather awkwardly as a result of those injuries.

The rest of his presidential campaign was thus conducted by his NARC colleagues in his absence, led by Raila Odinga and Kijana Wamalwa (who went on to become the Vice President) who campaigned tirelessly for Kibaki after stating, &quot;The captain has been injured in the field... but the rest of the team shall continue.&quot;
On 27 December 2002, Kibaki and NARC won a landslide victory over KANU, with Kibaki getting 62% of the votes in the presidential elections, against only 31% for the KANU candidate Uhuru Kenyatta.

==Presidency==
===Swearing in===
On 30 December 2002, still nursing injuries from the motor vehicle accident and in a wheel chair, Kibaki was sworn in as the third President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kenya, in front of thousands of cheering supporters at the historic Uhuru Park within Nairobi City. At his inauguration, he stressed his opposition to government corruption, saying: 

Kibaki&#x27;s swearing in marked the end of four decades of KANU rule, the party having ruled Kenya since independence. Moi, who had been in power for 24 years, began his retirement.

===Leadership style===
President Kibaki&#x27;s style was that of a low key publicity averse but highly intelligent and competent technocrat.

He, unlike his predecessors, never tried to establish a personality cult; never had his portrait on every unit of Kenya&#x27;s currency; never had all manner of streets, places, and institutions named after him; never had state sanctioned praise songs composed in his honour; never dominated news bulletins with reports of his presidential activities - however routine or mundane; and never engaged in the populist sloganeering of his predecessors.

His style of leadership gave him the image of a seemingly aloof, withdrawn technocrat or intellectual and made him seem out of touch with the street, and his seemingly hands-off leadership-by-delegation style made his governments, especially at the cabinet level, appear dysfunctional.

===First term health issues===
It is widely acknowledged that age and the 2002 accident denied the country the witty, sporty, eloquent Kibaki of the previous years. A man who could make lengthy and flowery contributions on the floor of Parliament without notes was confined to reading speeches at every forum.

In late January 2003, it was announced that the President had been admitted to Nairobi Hospital to have a blood clot– the after-effect of his car accident– removed from his leg. He came out of hospital and addressed the public outside the hospital on TV in a visibly incoherent manner, and speculation after that was that he had suffered a stroke, his second, the first being said to have occurred sometimes in the 1970s. His subsequent ill health greatly diminished his performance during his first term and the affairs of government during that time are said to have been largely run by a group of loyal aides, both in and out of government. Kibaki did not seem well, for instance, when he appeared live on TV on 25 September 2003 to appoint Moody Awori Vice President after the death in office of Vice President, Michael Wamalwa Kijana.

===2003: Free primary education===
In January 2003, Kibaki introduced a free primary education initiative, which brought over 1 million children who would not have been able to afford school the chance to attend. The initiative received positive attention, including praise from Bill Clinton, who met Kibaki in Kenya in July 2005. In his tenure he was involved in numerous academic events including the famous Equity Group Foundation, Wings to Fly 2013 scholars commissioning.

===2005: Constitutional referendum, the NARC fallout and government of national unity===
The 2005 Kenyan constitutional referendum was held on 21 November 2005. The main issue of contention in the Constitution review process was how much power should be vested in the Kenyan Presidency. In previous drafts, those who feared a concentration of power in the president added provisions for European-style power-sharing between a ceremonial President elected via universal suffrage and an executive Prime Minister elected by Parliament. The draft presented by Attorney General Amos Wako for the referendum retained sweeping powers for the Presidency.

Though Kibaki supported the proposal, some members of his own cabinet, mainly from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) wing led by Raila Odinga, allied with the main opposition party KANU to mobilize a powerful NO campaign that resulted in a majority of 58% of voters rejecting the draft.

As a consequence of, and immediately after, the referendum loss, on 23 November 2005, Kibaki dismissed his entire cabinet in the middle of his administration&#x27;s term, with the aim of purging all Raila-allied ministers from the cabinet. About his decision Kibaki said; The only members of the cabinet office to be spared a midterm exit were the Vice President and Minister of Home Affairs, Moody Awori, and the Attorney General whose position is constitutionally protected. A new cabinet of Kibaki loyalists, including MP&#x27;s from the opposition, termed the Government of National Unity (GNU), was thereafter appointed, but some MP&#x27;s who were offered ministerial positions declined to take up posts.

A report by a Kenyan Commission of Inquiry, the Waki Commission, contextualises some issues. They reported that Kibaki, after agreeing to an informal Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to create the post of Prime Minister, reneged on this pact after being elected. They cited criticism of Kibaki neglecting his pre-election agreement, leaving the public to identify it as an attempt by the Kibaki Government to &quot;keep power to itself rather than share it.&quot;

===2007: Elections===
On 26 January 2007, President Kibaki declared his intention of running for re-election in the 2007 presidential election. On 16 September 2007, Kibaki announced that he would stand as the candidate of a new alliance incorporating all the parties who supported his re-election, called the Party of National Unity. The parties in his alliance included the much diminished former ruling KANU, DP, Narc-Kenya, Ford-Kenya, Ford People, and Shirikisho.

Kibaki&#x27;s main opponent, Raila Odinga, had used the referendum victory to launch the ODM, which nominated him as its presidential candidate for the 2007 elections.

On 30 September 2007, President Kibaki launched his presidential campaign at Nyayo Stadium, Nairobi.

Kalonzo Musyoka then broke away from Raila&#x27;s ODM to mount his own fringe bid for the presidency, thus narrowing down the contest between the main candidates, Kibaki, the incumbent, and Odinga. Opinion polls up to election day showed Kibaki behind Raila Odinga nationally, but closing. On regional analysis, the polls showed him behind Raila in all regions of the country except Central Province, Embu, and Meru, where he was projected to take most of the votes, and behind Kalonzo Musyoka in Kalonzo&#x27;s native Ukambani.

===2007–2008: Results dispute and post-election violence===

Three days later, after a protracted count which saw presidential results in Kibaki&#x27;s Central Kenya come in last, allegedly inflated, in a cloud of suspicion and rising tensions, amid vehement protests by Raila&#x27;s ODM, overnight re-tallying of results and chaotic scenes, all beamed live on TV, at the national tallying center at the Kenyatta International Conference Center in Nairobi, riot police eventually sealed off the tallying Center ahead of the result announcement, evicted party agents, observers, and the media, and moved the Chairman of the Electoral Commission, Samuel Kivuitu, to another room where Kivuitu went on to declare Kibaki the winner by 4,584,721 votes to Odinga&#x27;s 4,352,993, placing Kibaki ahead of Odinga by about 232,000 votes in the hotly contested election with Kalonzo Musyoka a distant third.

One hour later, in a hastily convened dusk ceremony, Kibaki was sworn in at the grounds of State House, Nairobi for his second term, defiantly calling for the &quot;verdict of the people&quot; to be respected and for &quot;healing and reconciliation&quot; to begin. Tension arose and led to protests by a huge number of Kenyans who felt that Kibaki had refused to respect the verdict of the people and was now forcibly remaining in office.

Immediately the results were announced, Odinga bitterly accused Kibaki of electoral fraud. Odinga&#x27;s allegations scored with his supporters, and seemed meritorious since the results had defied pre-election polls and expectations and election day exit polls. Furthermore, Odinga, who had campaigned against the concentration of political power in the hands of Kikuyu politicians, had won the votes of most of the other Kenyan tribes and regions, with Kibaki&#x27;s victory being attained only with the near exclusive support of the populous Kikuyu, Meru, and Embu communities-who had turned out to vote for Kibaki in large numbers after feeling, in reaction to the Odinga campaign, and with the covert encouragement of the Kibaki campaign, increasingly besieged and threatened by the pro-Odinga tribes. Moreover, ODM had won the most parliamentary and local authority seats by a wide margin. A joint statement by the British Foreign Office and Department for International Development cited &quot;real concerns&quot; over irregularities, while international observers refused to declare the election free and fair. The European Union chief observer, Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, cited one constituency where his monitors saw official results for Kibaki that were 25,000 votes lower than the figure subsequently announced by the Electoral Commission, leading him to doubt the accuracy of the announced results.

It was reported that Kibaki, who had previously been perceived as an &quot;old-school gentleman&quot;, had &quot;revealed a steely side&quot; when he swore himself in within an hour of being announced the victor of the highly contested election—one where the results were largely in question. Odinga&#x27;s supporters said he would be declared president at a rival ceremony on Monday, but police banned the event.
Koki Muli, the head of local watchdog, the Institute of Education in Democracy, said called the day the &quot;saddest...in the history of democracy in this country&quot; and &quot;a coup d&#x27;etat.&quot;

Opposition supporters saw the result as a plot by Kibaki&#x27;s Kikuyu tribe, Kenya&#x27;s largest, to keep power by any means. The tribes that lost the election were upset at the prospect of five years without political power, and anti-Kikuyu sentiment swelled, spawning the 2007–2008 Kenyan crisis, as violence broke out in several places in the country, started by the ODM supporters protesting the &quot;stealing&quot; of their &quot;victory&quot;, and subsequently escalating as the targeted Kikuyus retaliated. As unrest spread, television and radio stations were instructed to stop all live broadcasts. There was widespread theft, vandalism, looting, destruction of property, and a significant number of atrocities, killings, and sexual violence reported.

The violence continued for more than two months, as Kibaki ruled with &quot;half&quot; a cabinet he had appointed, with Odinga and ODM refusing to recognize him as president.

When the election was eventually investigated by the Independent Review Commission (IREC) on the 2007 Elections chaired by Justice Johann Kriegler, it was found that there were too many electoral malpractices from several regions perpetrated by all the contesting parties to conclusively establish which candidate won the December 2007 Presidential elections. Such malpractices included widespread bribery, vote buying, intimidation, and ballot stuffing by both sides, as well as incompetence from the Electoral Commission of Kenya (ECK), which was shortly thereafter disbanded by the new Parliament.

===2008: National accord and Grand Coalition Government===
The country was only saved by the mediation of United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan with a panel of &quot;Eminent African Personalities&quot; backed by the African Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

Following the mediation, a deal, called the national accord, was signed in February 2008 between Raila Odinga and Kibaki, now referred to as the &quot;two Principals&quot;. The accord, later passed by the Kenyan Parliament as the National Accord and Reconciliation Act 2008 provided &quot;inter alia&quot; for power-sharing, with Kibaki remaining President and Raila Odinga taking a newly re-created post of Prime Minister.

On 17 April 2008, Raila Odinga was sworn in as Prime Minister of Kenya, along with a power-sharing Cabinet, with 42 ministers and 50 assistant ministers, Kenya&#x27;s largest ever. The cabinet was fifty percent Kibaki appointed ministers and fifty percent Raila appointed ministers, and was in reality a carefully balanced ethnic coalition. The arrangement, which also included Kalonzo Musyoka as vice president, was known as the &quot;Grand Coalition Government&quot;.

===Economic legacy: turnaround===
The Kibaki presidency set itself the main task of reviving and turning round country after years of stagnation and economic mismanagement during the Moi tenure – a feat faced with several challenges, including the aftermath of the Nyayo Era (Moi Presidency), western donor fatigue, the President&#x27;s ill health during his first term, political tension culminating in the break-up of the NARC coalition, the 2007–2008 post election violence, the 2007–2008 Global Financial crisis, and a tenuous relationship with his coalition partner, Raila Odinga, during his second term.

President Kibaki, the economist whose term as Finance minister in the 1970s is widely celebrated as outstanding, did much as president to repair the damage done to the country&#x27;s economy during the 24-year reign of his predecessor, President Moi. Compared to the Moi years, Kenya was much better managed, by far more competent public sector personnel, and was much transformed.

Kenya&#x27;s economy in the Kibaki years experienced a major turnaround. GDP growth picked up from a low 0.6% (real −1.6%) in 2002 to 3% in 2003, 4.9% in 2004, 5.8% in 2005, 6% in 2006, and 7% in 2007, then after the post election chaos and Global Financial Crisis—2008 (1.7%)and 2009 (2.6%), recovered to 5% in 2010 and 5% in 2011.

Development was resumed in all areas of the country, including the hitherto neglected and largely undeveloped semi-arid or arid north. Many sectors of the economy recovered from total collapse pre-2003. Numerous state corporations that had collapsed during the Moi years were revived and began performing profitably. The telecommunications sector boomed. Rebuilding, modernisation, and expansion of infrastructure began in earnest, with several ambitious infrastructural and other projects, such as the Thika Superhighway, which would have been seen as unattainable during the Moi years were completed. The country&#x27;s cities and towns also began being positively renewed and transformed.

The Constituency Development Fund (CDF) was also introduced in 2003. The fund was designed to support constituency-level, grass-root development projects. It was aimed to achieve equitable distribution of development resources across regions and to control imbalances in regional development brought about by partisan politics. It targeted all constituency-level development projects, particularly those aiming to combat poverty at the grassroots. The CDF programme has facilitated the putting up of new water, health, and education facilities in all parts of the country including remote areas that were usually overlooked during funds allocation in national budgets. CDF was the first step towards the devolved system of government introduced by the 2010 Constitution, by which Local Government structures were Constitutionally redesigned, enhanced, and strengthened.

President Kibaki also oversaw the creation of Kenya&#x27;s Vision 2030, a long-term development plan aimed at raising GDP growth to 10% annually and transforming Kenya into a middle income country by 2030, which he unveiled on 30 October 2006.

The Kibaki regime also saw a reduction of Kenya&#x27;s dependence on western donor aid, with the country being increasingly funded by internally generated resources such as increased tax revenue collection. Relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Japan, and other non-western powers improved and expanded remarkably in the Kibaki years. The People&#x27;s Republic of China and Japan especially, the Asian Tigers such as Malaysia and Singapore, Brazil, the Middle East and to a lesser extent, South Africa, Libya, other African Countries, and even Iran, became increasingly important economic partners.

===Political legacy===
President Kibaki was accused of ruling with a small group of his elderly peers, mainly from the educated side of the Kikuyu elite that emerged in the Jomo Kenyatta era, usually referred to as the &quot;Kitchen Cabinet&quot; or the &quot;Mount Kenya Mafia&quot;. There was therefore the perception that his was a Kikuyu presidency. This perception was reinforced when the President was seen to have trashed the pre- 2002 election Memorandum of Understanding with the Raila Odinga-led Liberal Democratic Party, and was further reinforced by his disputed 2007 election victory over the Raila Odinga led ODM Party being achieved nearly exclusively with the votes of the populous Mt. Kenya Kikuyu, Meru and Embu communities.

The Commission of Inquiry into Post Election Violence (CIPEV) put it thus:
The post election violence [in early 2008 therefore is, in part, a consequence of the failure of President Kibaki and his first Government to exert political control over the country or to maintain sufficient legitimacy as would have allowed a civilised contest with him at the polls to be possible. Kibaki&#x27;s regime failed to unite the country, and allowed feelings of marginalisation to fester into what became the post election violence. He and his then Government were complacent in the support they considered they would receive in any election from the majority Kikuyu community and failed to heed the views of the legitimate leaders of other communities.
Critics noted that President Kibaki failed to take advantage of the 2002 popular mandate for a complete break with the past and fix the politics largely mobilized along ethnic interests. &quot;... when we achieved and the new world dawned, the old men came out again and took our victory to re-make in the likeness of the former world they knew.&quot; Elected in 2002 on a reform platform, Kibaki was seen to have re-established the &quot;status quo ante&quot;. His opponents charged that a major aim of his presidency was the preservation of the privileged position of the elite that emerged during the Kenyatta years, of which he was part.

In summary, the Kibaki Presidency did not do nearly enough to address the problem of tribalism in Kenya.

Lawyer George Kegoro, in an article published in the &quot;Daily Nation&quot; newspaper on 12 April 2013 summarized the Kibaki Political Legacy thus:-
&quot;Kibaki was, by far, a better manager of the economy than Moi before him. He brought order to the management of public affairs, a departure from the rather informal style that characterised the Moi regime. Kibaki&#x27;s push for free primary education remains an important achievement, as will the revival of key economic institutions such as the Kenya Meat Commission and the Kenya Cooperative Creameries, ruined during the Moi-era. ... However, Kibaki was not all success. Having come to power in 2003 on an anti-corruption platform, he set up two commissions, the Bosire Commission on the Goldenberg scandal and the Ndung&#x27;u Commission, which investigated irregular land allocation. However, the reports were not implemented. Further, the Kibaki administration was rocked by a corruption scandal of its own, the Anglo Leasing scam, involving his close associates. John Githongo, an inspired appointment by Kibaki for an anti-corruption czar, resigned from the government in 2005, citing lack of support from the president. As he leaves office, therefore, the fight against corruption remains unfulfilled. ... But, perhaps, the most controversial aspect of the Kibaki tenure will always be his relationship with senior politicians of his day, particularly Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka. The context of this complex relationship includes the post-election violence of 2007, whose roots go back to the dishonoured Memorandum of Understanding between Kibaki and Raila in 2002. The quarrel over the MoU directly led to the break-up of the Narc government, after which Kibaki showed Odinga the door and invited the opposition to rule with him. The effect was that the opposition, rejected at the polls, joined government while Raila&#x27;s faction, validly elected to power, was consigned to the opposition. ... To the supporters of Raila and Kalonzo, Kibaki will be remembered as a person who did not keep political promises.&quot;


===Failure to tame corruption===
Though President Kibaki was never personally accused of corruption, and managed to virtually end the grabbing of public land rampant in the Moi and Kenyatta eras, he was unable to adequately contain Kenya&#x27;s widely entrenched culture of endemic corruption.

Michela Wrong describes the situation thus:
&quot;Whether expressed in the petty bribes the average Kenyan had to pay each week to fat-bellied policemen and local councillors, the jobs for the boys doled out by civil servants and politicians on strictly tribal lines, or the massive scams perpetrated by the country&#x27;s ruling elite, corruption had become endemic. &#x27;Eating&#x27;, as Kenyans dubbed the gorging on state resources by the well-connected, had crippled the nation. In the corruption indices drawn up by the anti-graft organisation Transparency International, Kenya routinely trail[s] near the bottom ... viewed as only slightly less sleazy than Nigeria or Pakistan ...&quot;
The &quot;Daily Nation&quot;, in an article published on 4 March 2013 titled &quot;End of a decade of highs and lows for Mwai Kibaki&quot; summarised it thus:
For a leader who was popularly swept into power in 2002 on an anti-corruption platform, Kibaki&#x27;s tenure saw graft scandals where hundreds of millions of shillings were siphoned from public coffers. Kibaki&#x27;s National Rainbow Coalition – which took power from the authoritarian rule of Daniel arap Moi—was welcomed for its promises of change and economic growth, but soon showed that it was better suited to treading established paths.

The initial response to corruption was very solid ... but it became clear after a while that these scams reached all the way to the president himself,&quot; said Kenya&#x27;s former anti-corruption chief John Githongo in Michela Wrong&#x27;s book &quot;It&#x27;s Our Turn to Eat&quot;. Most notorious of a raft of graft scandals was the multi-billion shilling Anglo Leasing case, which emerged in 2004 and involved public cash being paid to a complicated web of foreign companies for a range of services—including naval ships and passports—that never materialised.&quot;

===2010 Constitution===
The passage of Kenya&#x27;s transformative 2010 Constitution, championed by President Kibaki in the Kenyan constitutional referendum in 2010 was a major triumph and achievement, which went a long way into addressing Kenya&#x27;s governance and institutional challenges. With the new Constitution started wide-ranging institutional and legislative reforms, which President Kibaki skilfully and successfully steered in the final years of this presidency.&quot;His greatest moment was the promulgation of the new Constitution... It was a very deep and emotional moment for him,&quot; Kibaki&#x27;s son Jimmy was quoted as saying.

===2013: Power handover===
Kibaki handed over the Kenyan presidency to his successor, Uhuru Kenyatta, on 9 April 2013 at a public inauguration ceremony held at Kenya&#x27;s largest stadium. &quot;I am happy to pass the torch of leadership to the new generation of leaders&quot;, said Kibaki. He also thanked his family and all Kenyans for the support they had given him throughout his tenure in office, and cited the various achievements his government made.

The handover marked the end of his presidency and of his 50 years of public service.

==Personal life==
Kibaki was married to Lucy Muthoni from 1961 until her death in 2016. They had four children: Judy Wanjiku, Jimmy Kibaki, David Kagai, and Tony Githinji. They also had several grandchildren: Joy Jamie Marie, Rachael Muthoni, Mwai Junior, and Krystinaa Muthoni. Jimmy Kibaki has declared and aspired to be his father&#x27;s political heir, though he has been unsuccessful in that endeavor so far.

In 2004, the media reported that Kibaki had a second spouse, whom he allegedly married under customary law, Mary Wambui, and a daughter, Wangui Mwai. State House in response released an unsigned statement that Kibaki&#x27;s only immediate family at the time was his then wife, Lucy, and their four children. In 2009, Kibaki, with Lucy in close attendance, held an odd press conference to re-state publicly that he only had one wife. The matter of Kibaki&#x27;s alleged mistress, and his wife&#x27;s unusually dramatic public reactions therein, provided an embarrassing side-show during his presidency, with the &quot;Washington Post&quot; terming the entire scandal as a &quot;new Kenyan soap opera&quot;.

Ms. Wambui, the rather popular &quot;other woman&quot;, who enjoyed the state trappings of a presidential spouse and became a powerful and wealthy business-woman during the Kibaki Presidency, frequently drove Lucy into episodes of highly embarrassing very publicly displayed rage. Ms. Wambui, despite opposition from Kibaki&#x27;s family, led publicly by Kibaki&#x27;s son, Jimmy, and despite Kibaki&#x27;s public endorsement and campaign for her opponent, succeeded Kibaki as Member of Parliament for Othaya in the 2013 General Election. In December 2014, Senator Bonny Khalwale stated on KTN&#x27;s Jeff Koinange Live that President Kibaki had introduced Wambui as his wife.

Kibaki enjoyed playing golf and was a member of the Muthaiga Golf Club. He was a practicing and a very committed member of the Roman Catholic Church and attended Consolata Shrines Catholic Church in Nairobi every Sunday at noon.

On 21 August 2016, Kibaki was taken to Karen Hospital, and later flew to South Africa for specialized treatment.
Unlike the Kenyatta and Moi families, Kibaki&#x27;s family has shown little interest in politics save for his nephew Nderitu Muriithi, Governor of Laikipia County, from 2017 to 2022.

==Death==
Kibaki died on 21 April 2022, at the age of 90. His death was announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta, who issued a proclamation that Kibaki would be granted a state funeral with full civilian and military honors and declared a period of national mourning with flags flying at half-mast until President Mwai Kibaki is buried.

On 25 April 2022, his body was taken to Parliament buildings on a military gun carriage to offset the lying in state component of his state funeral. President Uhuru Kenyatta and First Lady wife Margaret Kenyatta led Kenyans in viewing the body. His body was laid on a catafalque at the Speaker&#x27;s way bearing the colour of his presidential standard and dressed in his trademark pin-striped suits. His body was also guarded by four Kenya Defence Forces colonels changing shifts after two hours. The lying in state continued until 27 April 2022 ahead of funeral service held at Nyayo National Stadium on 29 April 2022 which was attended by key dignitaries including some sitting presidents. He was finally interred at his Othaya home in Nyeri County on 30 April 2022 with full military honors after a church service held by the Catholic church at Othaya approved school. The honors included the Last Post and The Long Reveille bugle cry, a 19 gun salute and The Missing Man formation fly past. South Sudan declared three days of mourning; Tanzania declared two days of mourning.

<text>Milan Šufflay (8 November 1879 – 19 February 1931) was a Croatian historian and politician. He was one of the founders of Albanology and the author of the first Croatian science fiction novel. As a Croatian nationalist, he was persecuted in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and his murder subsequently caused an internationally publicized affair.

==Early life==
Šufflay was born into a lower noble family (hence &quot;pl.&quot;, &quot;plemeniti&quot;, &quot;noble&quot;, equivalent of &quot;von&quot;) in Lepoglava, in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia to Augustin Šufflay (1847–190?), a teacher, and Franciska Welle von Vorstern (1847–1910), a German Hungarian from Osijek. The family coat of arms was included in &quot;Der Adel von Kroatien und Slavonien&quot; (1899) as &quot;Sufflay de Otrussevcz&quot;. Their original surname was Sufflei or Schufflei, and their estate was Otruševec.

He attended a comprehensive high school in Zagreb and studied history at the University of Zagreb. He received a Ph.D. in 1901 from the same university with the thesis &quot;Croatia and the Last Endeavor of the Eastern Empire Under the Scepter of Three Komnenos (1075–1180)&quot;. He was a brilliant student both in high school and at the university. Already during his studies, he spoke French, German, Italian, English, all the Slavic languages, as well as Latin, old Greek, and middle Greek. Later in life, he learned modern Greek, Albanian, Hebrew, and Sanskrit. Tadija Smičiklas considered Šufflay his most gifted student and took him as his assistant when editing &quot;Codex Diplomaticus&quot; of the Yugoslavian Academy of Sciences and Arts.

Šufflay became a historian of the Balkans and was convinced that the history of the Croats can only be researched properly from that perspective. This conviction clashed with the prevailing opinion of Croatian historians that the Croats were representatives of the West, as opposed to the Balkans. Ignoring the proposal of the university senate, Ban Pavao Rauch appointed him a university professor in Zagreb in 1908. However, when Nikola Tomašić, his distant cousin and enemy, became a Ban in 1910, Šufflay had to leave the university. No longer exempt from military duty as a university professor, he was drafted in early 1915 but was soon released because of illness. He wrote his most important works during this period.

==Politics==

In the new state, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, he was arrested for high treason and charged with spying for a foreign power (through links with the Croatian Committee) together with Ivo Pilar, another Croatian historian. Their defense lawyer was Ante Pavelić, at the time a leader of the Party of Rights and an associate of Šufflay. Šufflay was sentenced to three years and six months in prison. The reaction to the sentence was stronger abroad than in Croatia, as scientific colleagues from numerous countries tried to obtain his release but without success. He did his time in the Sremska Mitrovica prison. After serving over half of his sentence, he was released from prison in 1922 and he returned to his scientific work.

In 1924, Šufflay wrote his first science fiction novel, &quot;On the Pacific in 2255&quot;, which is considered the first Croatian science fiction novel. In that same year Šufflay became a member of the leadership of the Pure Party of Rights, a rightwing Croatian political party inspired by the work of Josip Frank, a fervent nationalist. One of the most important characteristics of the Frank&#x27;s followers was their anti-Serb position. The party had reportedly not managed to win more than a few seats in the 300-strong legislative.

In 1928, when Stjepan Radić was assassinated in the Yugoslav parliament, a year before king Alexander I would establish his dictatorship, Šufflay wrote &quot;Hrvatska u svijetlu svjetske historije i politike&quot; (Croatia in the Light of World History and Politics). He wrote that the Croatian people was suffering under the Yugoslav dictatorship and that it had to free itself. He claimed that the border between Western and the Eastern Civilisations lay on the Drina river, the &quot;destined borderline on the Drina river on which the mighty Roman Empire snapped into two... a border both spiritual and cultural&quot;. Šufflay&#x27;s idea about the delineation on the Drina river would later influence Greater Croatian irredentism.
In 1928, he was appointed a professor at the University of Budapest, but he could not take the job because he did not hold a passport.

On the request of the Albanian government and the Academy of Sciences in Vienna, he continued the work of Jireček and Thalloczy, editing the 3rd book of &quot;Codex albanicus&quot;, an archival collection. In 1931, he finally obtained a passport and travelled to Albania to sign a contract to work on &quot;Acta Albaniae&quot;.

==Murder==

Members of the regime organisation, Young Yugoslavia, under royal protection, ambushed him at his doorstep in Zagreb and broke his skull with an iron rod, killing him. Then, they broke into his apartment and took the manuscript of the third book of &quot;Codex albanicus&quot;. There was never any investigation about the criminals. The authorities denied any knowledge of the assailants and banned activities related to Šufflay&#x27;s funeral.

Albert Einstein and Heinrich Mann sent a letter to the International League for Human Rights in Paris appealing to the global cultural public to protest against the murder of Milan Šufflay appealing for protection of Croatian people from the oppression of Yugoslavian regime.
The appeal was addressed to the Paris-based &quot;Ligue des droits de l&#x27;homme&quot; (Human Rights League) and made the front page of the &quot;New York Times&quot; on 6 May 1931.
It accused the king of complicity in the crime.

In June 1940, in the Banovina of Croatia, a trial was organized for Šufflay&#x27;s murder.

The murderers were the police agents Belošević and Zwerger, who fled to Belgrade. All later attempts of the Banovina of Croatia to have them extradited were fruitless.

<text>Project Tiger is a wildlife conservation movement initiated in India to protect the endangered tiger. The project was initiated in 1973 by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change of the Government of India. As of December 2024, there are 57 protected areas that have been designated as tiger reserves under the project. As of 2023, there were 3,682 wild tigers in India, which is almost 75% of the world&#x27;s wild tiger population.

== History and objectives ==

Project Tiger was initiated in 1973 by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change of the Government of India. The project was initiated to protect the Bengal Tiger and its habitats and to establish dedicated tiger reserves for sustaining tiger populations. As per the section 38 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, the state governments are responsible for preparing a Tiger Conservation Plan which includes planning and management of notified areas and maintaining the requisite competent staff to ensure the protection of the tiger reserve and providing inputs for maintaining a viable population of tigers, co-predators and prey animals.

Tiger reserves consist of a core area which includes part(s) of protected areas such as a national park or a wildlife sanctuary and a buffer zone which is a mix of forested and non-forested land. Project tiger is aimed at performing the necessary activities to ensure viability of tiger population in the core area and to promote a balance between the existence of people and animals in the buffer zones. In 2006, National Tiger Conservation Authority was formed to administer the tiger reserves which were set up as a part of Project Tiger with Project Tiger becoming a centrally sponsored scheme (CSS) to provide funding for the establishment and administration of the tiger reserves.

In 1973, nine protected areas were initially designated as tiger reserves. By the late 1980s, the initial nine reserves covering an area of had been increased to 15 reserves covering an area of . By 1997, 23 tiger reserves encompassed an area of . As of December 2024, there are 57 protected areas that have been designated as tiger reserves.

==Tiger population==
During the tiger census of 2006, a new methodology was used extrapolating site-specific densities of tigers, their co-predators and prey derived from camera trap and sign surveys using GIS. Based on the result of these surveys, the total tiger population was estimated at 1,411 individuals ranging from 1,165 to 1,657 adult and sub-adult tigers of more than 1.5 years of age. The 2010 National Tiger Assessment estimated the total population of wild tigers in India at 1,706. As per Ministry of Environment and Forests, the wild tiger population in India stood at 2,226 in 2014 with an increase of 30.5% since the 2010 estimate. 

In 2018, according to the National Tiger Conservation Authority, there were an estimated 2,603–3,346 wild tigers with an average of 2,967 in existence in India. The wild tiger population increased to 3,682 as of 2022. As India is home to majority of the global wild tiger population, the increase in population of tigers in India played a major role in driving up global populations as well; the number of wild tigers globally rose from 3,159 in 2010 to 3,890 in 2016 according to the World Wide Fund and Global Tiger Forum.

== Management and administration ==

Project Tiger is headed by an additional director general (ADG) based at New Delhi with regional offices at Bangalore, Guwahati and Nagpur. The wildlife habitats that fall under Project Tiger are categorized into different conservation units: Shivalik-Terai, North East, Sunderbans, Western ghats, Eastern ghats, Central India and Sariska. 

Function under the ambit of Project Tiger include protection of tiger habitats, daily monitoring, facilitating ecological development for local people in the buffer zones, voluntary relocation of people from core/critical tiger habitats and addressing human-wildlife conflicts. As a part of the project, state are provided assistance on curtailing poaching activities such as disseminating information on poachers, assisting in combing forest floor to check for traps and other anti-poaching activities, maintaining tiger database, providing grants and training for deployment of Special Tiger Protection Force.

Wireless communication systems, infrared thermal cameras and monitoring systems have been developed within the tiger reserves to assist in patrol activities.

== Challenges ==
Project Tiger&#x27;s efforts are hampered by poaching, deforestation, construction and irregularities in administration of certain reserves. The Forest Rights Act enacted by the Indian government in 2006 recognizes the rights of forest dwelling communities in the buffer zones. Some of the wildlife experts have questioned the implications of the same on tiger conservation as it will increase human-animal conflict and might give opportunities for poaching. While others argue that this overlooks the reality of human-tiger coexistence and the abuse of power by authorities wherein local people who have been co-existing with the animals being evicted from their traditional lands rather than allowing them a proper role in decision-making to aid the tiger crisis.

<text>Leon Festinger (8 May 1919 – 11 February 1989) was an American social psychologist who originated the theory of cognitive dissonance and social comparison theory. The rejection of the previously dominant behaviorist view of social psychology by demonstrating the inadequacy of stimulus-response conditioning accounts of human behavior is largely attributed to his theories and research. Festinger is also credited with advancing the use of laboratory experimentation in social psychology, although he simultaneously stressed the importance of studying real-life situations, a principle he practiced when personally infiltrating a doomsday cult. He is also known in social network theory for the proximity effect (or propinquity).

Festinger studied psychology under Kurt Lewin, an important figure in modern social psychology, at the University of Iowa, graduating in 1941; however, he did not develop an interest in social psychology until after joining the faculty at Lewin&#x27;s Research Center for Group Dynamics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1945. Despite his preeminence in social psychology, Festinger turned to visual perception research in 1964 and then archaeology, history, and the human evolutionary sciences in 1979 until his death in 1989. Following B. F. Skinner, Jean Piaget, Sigmund Freud, and Albert Bandura, Festinger was the fifth most cited psychologist of the 20th century.

==Life==
===Early life and education===
Festinger was born in Brooklyn New York on May 8, 1919 to Russian-Jewish immigrants Alex Festinger and Sara Solomon Festinger. His father, an embroidery manufacturer, had &quot;left Russia a radical and atheist and remained faithful to these views throughout his life.&quot; Festinger attended Boys&#x27; High School in Brooklyn, and received his BS degree in psychology from the City College of New York in 1939.

He proceeded to study under Kurt Lewin at the University of Iowa, where Festinger received his MA in 1940 and PhD in 1942 in the field of child behavior. By his own admission, he was not interested in social psychology when he arrived at Iowa, and did not take a single course in social psychology during his entire time there; instead, he was interested in Lewin&#x27;s earlier work on tension systems, but Lewin&#x27;s focus had shifted to social psychology by the time Festinger arrived at Iowa. However, Festinger continued to pursue his original interests, studying level of aspiration, working on statistics, developing a quantitative model of decision making, and even publishing a laboratory study on rats. Explaining his lack of interest in social psychology at the time, Festinger stated, &quot;The looser methodology of the social psychology studies, and the vagueness of relation of the data to Lewinian concepts and theories, all seemed unappealing to me in my youthful penchant for rigor.&quot; Festinger considered himself to be a freethinker and an atheist.

After graduating, Festinger worked as a research associate at Iowa from 1941 to 1943, and then as a statistician for the Committee on Selection and Training of Aircraft Pilots at the University of Rochester from 1943 to 1945 during World War II. In 1943, Festinger married Mary Oliver Ballou, a pianist, with whom he had three children, Catherine, Richard, and Kurt. Festinger and Ballou were later divorced, and Festinger married Trudy Bradley, currently a professor of social work emeritus at New York University, in 1968.

===Career===
In 1945, Festinger joined Lewin&#x27;s newly formed Research Center for Group Dynamics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an assistant professor. It was at MIT that Festinger, in his own words, &quot;became, by fiat, a social psychologist, and immersed myself in the field with all its difficulties, vaguenesses, and challenges.&quot; It was also at MIT that Festinger began his foray into social communication and pressures in groups that marked a turning point in his own research. As Festinger himself recalls, &quot;the years at M.I.T. [sic] seemed to us all to be momentous, ground breaking, the new beginning of something important.&quot; Indeed, Stanley Schachter, Festinger&#x27;s student and research assistant at the time, states, &quot;I was lucky enough to work with Festinger at this time, and I think of it as one of the high points of my scientific life.&quot;

Yet, this endeavor &quot;started as almost an accident&quot; while Festinger was conducting a study on the impact of architectural and ecological factors on student housing satisfaction for the university. Although the proximity effect (or propinquity) was an important direct finding from the study, Festinger and his collaborators also noticed correlations between the degree of friendship within a group of residents and the similarity of opinions within the group, thus raising unexpected questions regarding communication within social groups and the development of group standards of attitudes and behaviors. Indeed, Festinger&#x27;s seminal 1950 paper on informal social communication as a function of pressures toward attitude uniformity within a group cites findings from this seemingly unrelated housing satisfaction study multiple times.

After Lewin&#x27;s death in 1947, Festinger moved with the research center to the University of Michigan in 1948. He then moved to the University of Minnesota in 1951, and then on to Stanford University in 1955. During this time, Festinger published his highly influential paper on social comparison theory, extending his prior theory regarding the evaluation of attitudes in social groups to the evaluation of abilities in social groups. Following this, in 1957, Festinger published his theory of cognitive dissonance, arguably his most famous and influential contribution to the field of social psychology. Some also view this as an extension of Festinger&#x27;s prior work on group pressures toward resolving discrepancies in attitudes and abilities within social groups to how the individual resolves discrepancies at the cognitive level. Festinger also received considerable recognition during this time for his work, both from within the field, being awarded the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award by the American Psychological Association in 1959, and outside of the field, being named as one of America&#x27;s ten most promising scientists by &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine shortly after publishing social comparison theory.

Despite such recognition, Festinger left the field of social psychology in 1964, attributing his decision to &quot;a conviction that had been growing in me at the time that I, personally, was in a rut and needed an injection of intellectual stimulation from new sources to continue to be productive.&quot; He turned his attention to the visual system, focusing on human eye movement and color perception. In 1968, Festinger returned to his native New York City, continuing his perception research at The New School, then known as the New School for Social Research. In 1979, he closed his laboratory, citing dissatisfaction with working &quot;on narrower and narrower technical problems.&quot;

===Later life===
Writing in 1983, four years after closing his laboratory, Festinger expressed a sense of disappointment with what he and his field had accomplished:

:Forty years in my own life seems like a long time to me and while some things have been learned about human beings and human behavior during this time, progress has not been rapid enough; nor has the new knowledge been impressive enough. And even worse, from a broader point of view we do not seem to have been working on many of the important problems.

Festinger subsequently began exploring prehistoric archaeological data, meeting with Stephen Jay Gould to discuss ideas and visiting archaeological sites to investigate primitive toolmaking firsthand. His efforts eventually culminated in the book, &quot;The Human Legacy,&quot; which examined how humans evolved and developed complex societies. Although seemingly the product of a disillusioned, wholesale abandonment of the field of psychology, Festinger considered this research as a return to the fundamental concerns of psychology. He described the goal of his new research interests as &quot;see[ing] what can be inferred from different vantage points, from different data realms, about the nature, the characteristics, of this species we call human,&quot; and felt bemused when fellow psychologists asked him how his new research interests were related to psychology.

Festinger&#x27;s next and final enterprise was to understand why an idea is accepted or rejected by a culture, and he decided that examining why new technology was adopted quickly in the West but not in the Eastern Byzantine Empire would illuminate the issue. However, Festinger was diagnosed with cancer before he was able to publish this material. He decided not to pursue treatment, and died on February 11, 1989.

==Work==
===Proximity effect===
Festinger, Stanley Schachter, and Kurt Back examined the choice of friends among college students living in married student housing at MIT. The team showed that the formation of ties was predicted by propinquity, the physical proximity between where students lived, and not just by similar tastes or beliefs as conventional wisdom assumed. In other words, people simply tend to befriend their neighbors. They also found that functional distance predicted social ties as well. For example, in a two-storey apartment building, people living on the lower floor next to a stairway are functionally closer to upper-floor residents than are others living on the same lower floor. The lower-floor residents near the stairs are more likely than their lower-floor neighbors to befriend those living on the upper floor. Festinger and his collaborators viewed these findings as evidence that friendships often develop based on passive contacts (e.g., brief meetings made as a result of going to and from home within the student housing community) and that such passive contacts are more likely to occur given closer physical and functional distance between people.

===Informal social communication===
In his 1950 paper, Festinger postulated that one of the major pressures to communicate arises from uniformity within a group, which in turn arises from two sources: social reality and group locomotion. Festinger argued that people depend on social reality to determine the subjective validity of their attitudes and opinions, and that they look to their reference group to establish social reality; an opinion or attitude is therefore valid to the extent that it is similar to that of the reference group. He further argued that pressures to communicate arise when discrepancies in opinions or attitudes exist among members of a group, and laid out a series of hypotheses regarding determinants of when group members communicate, with whom they communicate, and how recipients of communication react, citing existing experimental evidence to support his arguments.

Festinger labeled communications arising from such pressures toward uniformity as &quot;instrumental communication&quot; in that the communication is not an end in itself but a means to reduce discrepancies between the communicator and others in the group. Instrumental communication is contrasted with &quot;consummatory communication&quot; where communication is the end, such as emotional expression.

===Social comparison theory===
Festinger&#x27;s influential social comparison theory (1954) can be viewed as an extension of his prior theory related to the reliance on social reality for evaluating attitudes and opinions to the realm of abilities. Starting with the premise that humans have an innate drive to accurately evaluate their opinions and abilities, Festinger postulated that people will seek to evaluate their opinions and abilities by comparing them with those of others. Specifically, people will seek out others who are close to one&#x27;s own opinions and abilities for comparison because accurate comparisons are difficult when others are too divergent from those of oneself. To use Festinger&#x27;s example, a chess novice does not compare his chess abilities to those of recognized chess masters, nor does a college student compare his intellectual abilities to those of a toddler.

People will, moreover, take action to reduce discrepancies in attitudes, whether by changing others to bring them closer to oneself or by changing one&#x27;s own attitudes to bring them closer to others. They will likewise take action to reduce discrepancies in abilities, for which there is an upward drive to improve one&#x27;s abilities. Thus Festinger suggested that the &quot;social influence processes and some kinds of competitive behavior are both manifestations of the same socio-psychological process...[namely,] the drive for self evaluation and the necessity for such evaluation being based on comparison with other persons.&quot; Festinger also discussed implications of social comparison theory for society, hypothesizing that the tendency for people to move into groups that hold opinions which agree with their own and abilities that are near their own results in the segmentation of society into groups which are relatively alike.

In his 1954 paper, Festinger again systematically set forth a series of hypotheses, corollaries, and derivations, and he cited existing experimental evidence where available. He stated his main set of hypotheses as follows:

:1. There exists, in the human organism, a drive to evaluate his opinion and abilities.
:2. To the extent that objective, nonsocial means are available, people evaluate their opinions and abilities by comparison respectively with the opinions and abilities of others.
:3. The tendency to compare oneself with some other specific person decreases as the difference between his opinion or ability and one&#x27;s own increases.
:4. There is a unidirectional drive upward in the case of abilities which is largely absent in opinions.
:5. There are nonsocial restraints which make it difficult or even impossible to change one&#x27;s ability. These nonsocial restraints are largely absent for opinions.
:6. The cessation of comparison with others is accompanied by hostility or derogation to the extent that continued comparison with those persons implies unpleasant consequences.
:7. Any factors which increase the importance of some particular group as a comparison group for some particular opinion or ability will increase the pressure toward uniformity concerning that ability or opinion within that group.
:8. If persons who are very divergent from one&#x27;s own opinion or ability are perceived as different from oneself on attributes consistent with the divergence, the tendency to narrow the range of comparability becomes stronger.
:9. When there is a range of opinion or ability in a group, the relative strength of the three manifestations of pressures toward uniformity will be different for those who are close to the mode of the group than those who are distant from the mode. Specifically, those close to the mode of the group will have stronger tendencies to change the positions of others, relatively weaker tendencies to narrow the range of comparison, and much weaker tendencies to change their position compared to those who are distant from the mode of the group.

===&quot;When Prophecy Fails&quot;===

Festinger and his collaborators, Henry Riecken and Stanley Schachter, examined conditions under which disconfirmation of beliefs leads to increased conviction in such beliefs in the 1956 book &quot;When Prophecy Fails&quot;. The group studied a small apocalyptic cult led by Dorothy Martin (under the pseudonym Marian Keech in the book), a suburban housewife. Martin claimed to have received messages from &quot;the Guardians,&quot; a group of superior beings from another planet called &#x27;Clarion.&#x27; The messages purportedly said that a flood spreading to form an inland sea stretching from the Arctic Circle to the Gulf of Mexico would destroy the world on December 21, 1954. The three psychologists and several more assistants joined the group. The team observed the group firsthand for months before and after the predicted apocalypse. Many of the group members quit their jobs and disposed of their possessions in preparation for the apocalypse. When doomsday came and went, Martin claimed that the world had been spared because of the &quot;force of Good and light&quot; that the group members had spread. Rather than abandoning their discredited beliefs, group members adhered to them even more strongly and began proselytizing with fervor.

Festinger and his co-authors concluded that the following conditions lead to increased conviction in beliefs following disconfirmation:

:1. The belief must be held with deep conviction and be relevant to the believer&#x27;s actions or behavior.
:2. The belief must have produced actions that are arguably difficult to undo.
:3. The belief must be sufficiently specific and concerned with the real world such that it can be clearly disconfirmed.
:4. The disconfirmatory evidence must be recognized by the believer.
:5. The believer must have social support from other believers.

Festinger also later described the increased conviction and proselytizing by cult members after disconfirmation as a specific instantiation of cognitive dissonance (i.e., increased proselytizing reduced dissonance by producing the knowledge that others also accepted their beliefs) and its application to understanding complex, mass phenomena.

The observations reported in &quot;When Prophecy Fails&quot; were the first experimental evidence for belief perseverance.

===Cognitive dissonance===

Festinger&#x27;s seminal 1957 work integrated existing research literature on influence and social communication under his theory of cognitive dissonance. The theory was motivated by a study of rumors immediately following a severe earthquake in India in 1934. Among people who felt the shock but sustained no damage from the earthquake, rumors were widely circulated and accepted about even worse disasters to come. Although seemingly counter-intuitive that people would choose to believe &quot;fear-provoking&quot; rumors, Festinger reasoned that these rumors were actually &quot;fear-justifying.&quot; The rumors functioned to reduce the inconsistency of people&#x27;s feelings of fear despite not directly experiencing the effects of the earthquake by giving people a reason to be fearful.

Festinger described the basic hypotheses of cognitive dissonance as follows:

:1. The existence of dissonance [or inconsistency], being psychologically uncomfortable, will motivate the person to try to reduce the dissonance and achieve consonance [or consistency]. 
:2. When dissonance is present, in addition to trying to reduce it, the person will actively avoid situations and information which would likely increase the dissonance.

Dissonance reduction can be achieved by changing cognition by changing actions, or selectively acquiring new information or opinions. To use Festinger&#x27;s example of a smoker who has knowledge that smoking is bad for his health, the smoker may reduce dissonance by choosing to quit smoking, by changing his thoughts about the effects of smoking (e.g., smoking is not as bad for your health as others claim), or by acquiring knowledge pointing to the positive effects of smoking (e.g., smoking prevents weight gain).

Festinger and James M. Carlsmith published their classic cognitive dissonance experiment in 1959. In the experiment, subjects were asked to perform an hour of boring and monotonous tasks (i.e., repeatedly filling and emptying a tray with 12 spools and turning 48 square pegs in a board clockwise). Some subjects, who were led to believe that their participation in the experiment had concluded, were then asked to perform a favor for the experimenter by telling the next participant, who was actually a confederate, that the task was extremely enjoyable. Dissonance was created for the subjects performing the favor, as the task was in fact boring. Half of the paid subjects were given $1 for the favor, while those of the other half received $20. As predicted by Festinger and Carlsmith, those paid $1 reported the task to be more enjoyable than those paid $20. Those paid $1 were forced to reduce dissonance by changing their opinions of the task to produce consonance with their behavior of reporting that the task was enjoyable. The subjects paid $20 experienced less dissonance, as the large payment provided consonance with their behavior; they therefore rated the task as less enjoyable and their ratings were similar to those who were not asked to perform the dissonance-causing favor.

==Legacy==
Social comparison theory and cognitive dissonance have been described by other psychologists as &quot;the two most fruitful theories in social psychology.&quot; Cognitive dissonance has been variously described as &quot;social psychology&#x27;s most notable achievement,&quot; &quot;the most important development in social psychology to date,&quot; and a theory without which &quot;social psychology would not be what it is today.&quot; Cognitive dissonance spawned decades of related research, from studies focused on further theoretical refinement and development to domains as varied as decision making, the socialization of children, and color preference.

In addition, Festinger is credited with the ascendancy of laboratory experimentation in social psychology as one who &quot;converted the experiment into a powerful scientific instrument with a central role in the search for knowledge.&quot; An obituary published by the &quot;American Psychologist&quot; stated that it was &quot;doubtful that experimental psychology would exist at all&quot; without Festinger. Yet it seems that Festinger was wary about burdensome demands for greater empirical precision. Warning against the dangers of such demands when theoretical concepts are not yet fully developed, Festinger stated, &quot;Research can increasingly address itself to minor unclarities in prior research rather than to larger issues; people can lose sight of the basic problems because the field becomes defined by the ongoing research.&quot; He also stressed that laboratory experimentation &quot;cannot exist by itself,&quot; but that &quot;there should be an active interrelation between laboratory experimentation and the study of real-life situations.&quot; Also, while Festinger is praised for his theoretical rigor and experimental approach to social psychology, he is regarded as having contributed to &quot;the estrangement between basic and applied social psychology in the United States.&quot; He &quot;became a symbol of the tough-minded, theory-oriented, pure experimental scientist,&quot; while Ron Lippitt, a fellow faculty member at Lewin&#x27;s Research Center for Group Dynamics with whom Festinger often clashed, &quot;became a symbol of the fuzzy-minded, do-gooder, practitioner of applied social psychology.&quot;

One of the greatest impacts of Festinger&#x27;s studies lies in their &quot;depict[ion] of social behavior as the responses of a thinking organism continually acting to bring order into his world, rather than as the blind impulses of a creature of emotion and habit,&quot; as cited in his Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award. Behaviorism, which had dominated psychology until that time, characterized man as a creature of habit conditioned by stimulus-response reinforcement processes. Behaviorists focused only on the observable, i.e., behavior and external rewards, with no reference to cognitive or emotional processes. Theories like cognitive dissonance could not be explained in behaviorist terms. For example, liking was simply a function of reward according to behaviorism, so greater reward would produce greater liking; Festinger and Carlsmith&#x27;s experiment clearly demonstrated greater liking with lower reward, a result that required the acknowledgement of cognitive processes. With Festinger&#x27;s theories and the research that they generated, &quot;the monolithic grip that reinforcement theory had held on social psychology was effectively and permanently broken.&quot;

<doc id="163306" wikidata="Q188953" url="?curid=163306" title="Perak">
<text>Perak (; Perak Malay: &quot;Peghok&quot;) is a state of Malaysia on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula. Perak has land borders with the Malaysian states of Kedah to the north, Penang to the northwest, Kelantan and Pahang to the east, and Selangor to the south. Thailand&#x27;s Yala and Narathiwat provinces both lie to the northeast. Perak&#x27;s capital city, Ipoh, was known historically for its tin-mining activities until the price of the metal dropped, severely affecting the state&#x27;s economy. The royal capital remains Kuala Kangsar, where the palace of the Sultan of Perak is located. As of 2018, the state&#x27;s population was 2,500,000. Perak has diverse tropical rainforests and an equatorial climate. The state&#x27;s main mountain ranges are composed of the Titiwangsa, Bintang and Keledang Ranges, where all of them are part of the larger Tenasserim Hills system that connects Myanmar, Thailand and Malaysia.

The discovery of an ancient skeleton in Perak revealed missing information on the migration of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; from mainland Asia through Southeast Asia to the Australian continent. Known as Perak Man, the skeleton is dated at around 10,000 years old. An early Hindu or Buddhist kingdom, followed by several other minor kingdoms, existed before the arrival of Islam. By 1528, a Muslim sultanate began to emerge in Perak, out of the remnants of the Malaccan Sultanate. Although able to resist Siamese occupation for more than two hundred years, the sultanate was partly controlled by the Sumatra-based Aceh Sultanate. This was particularly the case after the Aceh lineage took over the royal succession. With the arrival of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), and the VOC&#x27;s increasing conflicts with Aceh, Perak began to distance itself from Acehnese control. The presence of the English East India Company (EIC) in the nearby Straits Settlements of Penang provided additional protection for the state, with further Siamese attempts to conquer Perak thwarted by British expeditionary forces.

The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 was signed to prevent further conflict between the British and the Dutch. It enabled the British to expand their control in the Malay Peninsula without interference from other foreign powers. The 1874 Pangkor Treaty provided for direct British intervention, with Perak appointing a British Resident. Following Perak&#x27;s subsequent absorption into the Federated Malay States (FMS), the British reformed administration of the sultanate through a new style of government, actively promoting a market-driven economy and maintaining law and order while combatting the slavery widely practised across Perak at the time. The three-year Japanese occupation in World War II halted further progress. After the war, Perak became part of the temporary Malayan Union, before being absorbed into the Federation of Malaya. It gained full independence through the Federation, which subsequently became Malaysia on 16 September 1963.

Perak is ethnically, culturally and linguistically diverse. The state is known for several traditional dances: &quot;bubu&quot;, &quot;dabus&quot;, and &quot;labu sayong&quot;, the latter name also referring to Perak&#x27;s unique traditional pottery. The head of state is the Sultan of Perak, and the head of government is the &quot;Menteri Besar&quot;. Government is closely modelled on the Westminster parliamentary system, with the state administration divided into administrative districts. Islam is the state religion, and other religions may be practised freely. Malay and English are recognised as the official languages of Perak. The economy is mainly based on services and manufacturing.

== Etymology ==
There are many theories about the origin of the name Perak. Although not used until after 1529, the most popular etymology is &quot;silver&quot; (in Malay: &quot;perak&quot;); associated with tin mining from the state&#x27;s large mineral deposits, reflecting Perak&#x27;s position as one of the world&#x27;s largest sources of tin. The first Islamic kingdom established in the state was of the lineage of the Sultanate of Malacca. Some local historians have suggested that Perak was named after Malacca&#x27;s &quot;bendahara&quot;, Tun Perak. In maps prior to 1561, the area is marked as &quot;Perat&quot;. Other historians believe that the name Perak derives from the Malay phrase &quot;kilatan ikan dalam air&quot; (the glimmer of fish in water), which looks like silver. Perak has been translated into Arabic as (&quot;Dār al-Riḍwān&quot;), &quot;abode of grace&quot;.

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
Among the prehistoric sites in Malaysia where artefacts from the Middle Palaeolithic era have been found are Bukit Bunuh, Bukit Gua Harimau, Bukit Jawa, Bukit Kepala Gajah, and Kota Tampan in the Lenggong Archaeological Heritage Valley. Of these, Bukit Bunuh and Kota Tampan are ancient lakeside sites, the geology of Bukit Bunuh showing evidence of meteoric impact. The 10,000-year-old skeleton known as Perak Man was found inside the Bukit Gunung Runtuh cave at Bukit Kepala Gajah. Ancient tools discovered in the area of Kota Tampan, including anvils, cores, debitage, and hammerstones, provide information on the migrations of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. Other important Neolithic sites in the country include Bukit Gua Harimau, Gua Badak, Gua Pondok, and Padang Rengas, containing evidence of human presence in the Mesolithic Hoabinhian era.
In 1959, a British artillery officer stationed at an inland army base during the Malayan Emergency discovered the Tambun rock art, identified by archaeologists as the largest rock art site in the Malay Peninsula. Most of the paintings are located high above the cave floor, at an elevation of . Seashells and coral fragments scattered along the cave floor are evidence that the area was once underwater.

The significant numbers of statues of Hindu deities and of the Buddha found in Bidor, Kuala Selensing, Jalong, and Pengkalan Pegoh indicate that, before the arrival of Islam, the inhabitants of Perak were mainly Hindu or Buddhist. The influence of Indian culture and beliefs on society and values in the Malay Peninsula from early times is believed to have culminated in the semi-legendary Gangga Negara kingdom. The &quot;Malay Annals&quot; mention that Gangga Negara at one time fell under Siamese rule, before Raja Suran of Thailand sailed further south down the Malay Peninsula.

=== Sultanate of Perak ===
By the 15th century, a kingdom named Beruas had come into existence. Inscriptions found on early tombstones of the period show clear Islamic influence, believed to have originated from the Sultanate of Malacca, the east coast of the Malay Peninsula, and the rural areas of the Perak River. The first organised local government systems to emerge in Perak were the Manjung government and several other governments in Central and Hulu Perak (Upper Perak) under Raja Roman and Tun Saban. With the spread of Islam, a sultanate subsequently emerged in Perak; the second oldest Muslim kingdom in the Malay Peninsula after the neighbouring Kedah Sultanate. Based on &quot;Salasilah Raja-Raja Perak&quot; (Perak Royal Genealogy), the Perak Sultanate was formed in the early 16th century on the banks of the Perak River by the eldest son of Mahmud Shah, the 8th Sultan of Malacca. He ascended to the throne as Muzaffar Shah I, first Sultan of Perak, after surviving the capture of Malacca by the Portuguese in 1511 and living quietly for a period in Siak on the island of Sumatra. He became sultan through the efforts of Tun Saban, a local leader and trader between Perak and Klang. There had been no sultan in Perak when Tun Saban first arrived in the area from Kampar in Sumatra. Most of the area&#x27;s residents were traders from Malacca and Selangor, and from Siak, Kampar, and Jambi in Sumatra. Among them was an old woman, Tok Masuka from Daik, who raised a Temusai child named Nakhoda Kassim. Before her death, she called on the ancestors of Sang Sapurba to take her place, to prevent the royal lineage from disappearing from the Malay Peninsula. Tun Saban and Nakhoda Kassim then travelled to Kampar, where Mahmud Shah agreed to their request and named his son the first Sultan of Perak.

Perak&#x27;s administration became more organised after the sultanate was established and adopted Malacca&#x27;s form of elective monarchy. With the opening up of Perak in the 16th century, the state became a source of tin ore. It appears that anyone was free to trade in the commodity, although the tin trade did not attract significant attention until the 1610s.
Throughout the 1570s, the Sultanate of Aceh subjected most parts of the Malay Peninsula to continual harassment. The sudden disappearance of Perak&#x27;s Sultan Mansur Shah I in 1577 gave rise to rumours of abduction by Acehnese forces. Soon afterwards, the late sultan&#x27;s widow and his 16 children were taken as captives to Sumatra. Sultan Mansur Shah I&#x27;s eldest son, Raja Alauddin Mansur Syah, married an Acehnese princess and subsequently became the Sultan of Aceh. The Sultanate of Perak was left without a ruling monarch, and Perak nobles went to Aceh in the same year to ask the new Sultan Alauddin for a successor. The ruler sent his younger brother to become Perak&#x27;s third monarch. Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Shah ruled Perak for seven years, maintaining the unbroken lineage of the Malacca dynasty. Although Perak did fall under the authority of the Acehnese Sultanate, it remained entirely independent of Siamese control for over two hundred years from 1612, in contrast with its neighbour, Kedah, and many of the Malay sultanates in the northern part of the Malay Peninsula, which became tributary states of Siam. In 1620, the Acehnese sultanate invaded Perak and captured its sultan.

When Sultan Sallehuddin Riayat Shah died without an heir in 1635, a state of uncertainty prevailed in Perak. This was exacerbated by a deadly cholera epidemic that swept through the state, killing many royal family members. Perak chieftains were left with no alternative but to turn to Aceh&#x27;s sultan Iskandar Thani, who sent his relative, Raja Sulong, to become the new Sultan of Perak as Muzaffar Shah II.

Aceh&#x27;s influence on Perak began to wane when the Dutch East India Company (VOC) arrived, in the mid-17th century. When Perak refused to enter into a contract with the VOC as its northern neighbours had done, a blockade of the Perak River was ordered that halted the tin trade, causing suffering among Aceh&#x27;s merchants. In 1650, Aceh&#x27;s sultana Taj ul-Alam ordered Perak to sign an agreement with the VOC, on the condition that the tin trade would be conducted exclusively with Aceh&#x27;s merchants. By the following year, the VOC had secured a monopoly over the tin trade, setting up a store in Perak. Following long competition between Aceh and the VOC over Perak&#x27;s tin trade, on 15 December 1653, the two parties jointly signed a treaty with Perak granting the Dutch exclusive rights to tin extracted from mines located in the state.
A fort was built on Pangkor Island in 1670 to act as a warehouse to store tin ore mined in Perak even though Perak nobles had destroyed an earlier store structure, on orders from the Dutch base in Batavia. This warehouse was also destroyed in further attacks in 1690, but was repaired when the Dutch returned with reinforcements. In 1699, when the regionally dominant Sultanate of Johor lost its last Malaccan dynasty sultan, Sultan Mahmud Shah II, Perak now had the sole claim of being the final heir of the Sultanate of Malacca. However, Perak could not match the prestige and power of either the Malacca or Johor Sultanates.

The early 18th century started with 40 years of civil war where rival princes were bolstered by local chiefs, the Bugis and Minang, fighting for a share of the tin revenue. The Bugis and several Perak chiefs were successful in ousting the Perak ruler, Sultan Muzaffar Riayat Shah III in 1743. In 1747, Sultan Muzaffar Riayat Shah III, now only holding power in the area of Upper Perak, signed a treaty with Dutch Commissioner Ary Verbrugge under which Perak&#x27;s ruler recognised the Dutch monopoly over the tin trade, agreed to sell all tin ore to Dutch traders, and allowed the Dutch to build a new warehouse fort on the Perak River estuary. With construction of the new warehouse near the Perak River (also known as Sungai Perak), the old warehouse was abandoned permanently and left in ruins.

The mid-18th century saw Sultan Muzaffar ruling inland Perak while the coastal region was ruled by Raja Iskandar, animosity grew between the two as Raja Iskandar was unable to reach the tin-bearing highlands while the Sultan had restricted access to the strait. Reconciliation occurred later with Iskandar&#x27;s marriage to the Sultan&#x27;s daughter. His accession in 1752 saw unprecedented peace in Perak, especially due to an alliance (which lasted until 1795) with the Dutch to protect Perak against external attacks.When repeated Burmese invasions resulted in the destruction and defeat of the Siamese Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1767 by the Burmese Konbaung dynasty, neighbouring Malay tributary states began to assert their independence from Siam. To further develop Perak&#x27;s tin mines, the Dutch administration suggested that its 17th sultan, Alauddin Mansur Shah Iskandar Muda, should allow Chinese miners into Perak. The sultan himself encouraged the scheme in 1776, requesting that additional Chinese workers be sent from Dutch Malacca. The Fourth Anglo-Dutch War in 1780 adversely affected the tin trade in Perak, and many Chinese miners left. In a move which angered the Siamese court, neighbouring Kedah&#x27;s Sultan Abdullah Mukarram Shah then entered into an agreement with the British East India Company (EIC), ceding Penang Island to the British in 1786 in exchange for protection.
Siam regained strength under the Thonburi Kingdom, led by Taksin, after freeing itself from Burmese occupation. After repelling another large-scale Burmese invasion, the Rattanakosin Kingdom (Chakri dynasty) led by Rama I, as the successor of the Thonburi Kingdom, turned its attention to its insubordinate southern Malay subjects, fearing renewed attacks from Burma along the western seaboard of the Malay Peninsula. Attention to the south was also needed because of disunity and rivalries among the various southern tributary sultanates, stemming from personal conflicts and a reluctance to submit to Siamese authority. One example of this resistance was the Sultanate of Pattani under Sultan Muhammad, who refused to aid Siam during the Siamese war of liberation. This led Rama I&#x27;s younger brother, Prince Surasi, to attack Pattani in 1786. Many Malays were killed, and survivors were taken to the Siamese stronghold in Bangkok as slaves. Siam&#x27;s subjugation of Pattani served as a warning to the other Malay tributary states, particularly Kedah, they too having been forced to provide thousands of men, and food supplies, throughout the Siamese resistance campaign against the Burmese.

In 1795, the Dutch temporarily withdrew from Malacca for the duration of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe. Malacca&#x27;s authority was transferred to the British Resident. When war ended, the Dutch returned to administer Malacca in 1818. In 1818, the Dutch monopoly over the tin trade in Perak was renewed, with the signing of a new recognition treaty. In the same year as when Perak refused to send a bunga mas tribute to the Siamese court, the king Rama II of Siam had Kedah attack Perak. The Sultanate of Kedah knew the intention behind the order was to weaken ties between fellow Malay states, but complied, unable to resist Siam&#x27;s further territorial expansion into inland Hulu Perak. Siam&#x27;s tributary Malay state, the Kingdom of Reman, then illegally operated tin mines in Klian Intan, angering the Sultan of Perak and provoking a dispute that escalated into civil war. Reman, aided by Siam, succeeded in controlling several inland districts.

In 1821, Siam invaded and conquered the Sultanate of Kedah, angered by a breach of trust. The exiled Sultan of Kedah turned to the British to help him regain his throne, despite Britain&#x27;s policy of non-engagement in expensive minor wars in the Malay Peninsula at the time, which the EIC upheld through the Governor-General of India. Siam&#x27;s subsequent plan to extend its conquests to the southern territory of Perak failed after Perak defeated the Siamese forces with the aid of mixed Bugis and Malay reinforcements from the Sultanate of Selangor. As an expression of gratitude to Selangor for assisting it to defeat Siam, Perak authorised Raja Hasan of Selangor to collect taxes and revenue in its territory. This power, however, was soon misused, causing conflict between the two sultanates.

When the EIC established a British presence in Penang, the British already had a trading post in Singapore, avoiding involvement in the affairs of the nearby Malay sultanates. In 1822, the British authority in India sent British diplomat John Crawfurd to Siam to negotiate trade concessions and gather information with a view to restoring the Sultan of Kedah to the throne. The mission failed. In 1823, the Sultanates of Perak and Selangor signed a joint agreement to block the Dutch tin monopoly in their territories. EIC policy shifted with the First Anglo-Burmese War in 1824 with Siam becoming an important ally.

Through its governor, Robert Fullerton, Penang tried to convince the main EIC authority in India to continue helping the Sultan of Kedah to regain his throne. Throughout 1824, Siam aimed to expand its control towards Perak and Selangor. The dispute between the British and Dutch formally ceased when Dutch Malacca in the Malay Peninsula was exchanged with British Bencoolen in Sumatra, both parties agreeing to limit their sphere of influence through the signing of the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty. In July 1825, an initial negotiation was held between Siam, represented by their tributary state the Kingdom of Ligor, and the EIC. The King of Ligor promised that Siam would not send its armada to Perak and Selangor, resolving the issue of its attacks. The British renounced any aspiration of conquering Perak or interfering in its administration, promising to prevent Raja Hasan of Selangor from making trouble in Perak, and to try to reconcile the differences between Selangor and Ligor. A month later, in August 1825, Sultan of Selangor Ibrahim Shah signed a friendship and peace treaty with the EIC, represented by John Anderson, ending the long feud between the governments of Selangor and Perak. Under the treaty, Selangor gave assurances to the British that it would not interfere in the affairs of Perak; the border between Perak and Selangor was finalised; and Raja Hasan of Selangor was to be immediately exiled from Perak, paving the way for peace between the two Malay states and the resolution of the power struggle between the British and Siam.
In 1826, the Kingdom of Ligor broke its promise and attempted to conquer Perak. A small British expeditionary force thwarted the attack. The Sultan of Perak then ceded to the British Dindings and Pangkor (the two now constitute Manjung District) so that the British could suppress pirate activity along the Perak coast where it became part of the Straits Settlements. The same year, the British and Siam concluded the Burney Treaty, signed by British Captain Henry Burney and the Siamese government, the British agreed not to intercede in the affairs of Kedah despite their friendly relations with Kedah&#x27;s ruler, and the Siamese agreed not to attack Perak or Selangor.

The discovery of tin in Larut and rapid growth of the tin ore trade in the 19th century saw an increasing influx of Chinese labour. Later, rivalry developed between two Chinese secret societies. This, coupled with internal political strife between two factions of Perak&#x27;s local Malay rulers, escalated into the Larut Wars in 1841. After 21 years of wars, neighbouring Kedah freed itself from full Siamese rule in 1843, although it remained a Siamese tributary state until 1909. By 1867, the link between the Straits Settlements on the Malay coast and the British authority in India was broken, with separate administration and the transfer of the respective territories to the Colonial Office. The Anglo-Dutch Treaties of 1870–1871 enabled the Dutch to consolidate control over Aceh in Sumatra. This later escalated into the Aceh War.Internal conflicts ensued in Perak. In 1873, the ruler of one of Perak&#x27;s two local Malay factions, Raja Abdullah Muhammad Shah II, wrote to the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Andrew Clarke, requesting British assistance. This resulted in the Treaty of Pangkor, signed on Pangkor Island on 20 January 1874, under which the British recognised Abdullah as the legitimate Sultan of Perak. In return, the treaty provided for direct British intervention through the appointment of a Resident who would advise the sultan on all matters except religion and customs, and oversee revenue collection and general administration, including maintenance of peace and order. Britain&#x27;s first priority in the region was preventing the internecine warfare among the Chinese at Larut which had been disrupting trade, and in bringing about an end to the piracy plaguing the region.The treaty marked the introduction of a British residential system, with Perak going on to become part of the Federated Malay States (FMS) in 1895. It was also a shift from the previous British policy of non-intervention in Perak&#x27;s affairs. James W. W. Birch was appointed as Perak&#x27;s first British Resident, and Captain Speedy, already stationed at Larut with a number of Sepoys, was appointed Assistant Resident. However, Birch&#x27;s inability to understand and communicate well with the locals, ignorance of Malay customs, and disparagement of the efforts of the sultan and his dignitaries to implement British tax control and collection systems caused resentment. This was also not helped by a lack of a coherent British policy for the area, and poor understanding from the Sultanate as to the implications of a British Resident. As a result, local nationalist Maharaja Lela and the new monarch, Sultan Abdullah Muhammad Shah II, opposed him, and the following year, in 1875, Birch was assassinated through a conspiracy of local Malay dignitaries Seputum, Pandak Indut, Che Gondah, and Ngah Ahmad. The assassination angered the British authority, and following anti-British uprisings in several areas, a major military campaign was fought by the British in Perak in 1875-76. The perpetrators were arrested and executed and the sultan and his chiefs, also suspected of involvement in the plot, were banished to the British Seychelles in the Indian Ocean in 1876. The swiftness of the campaign would would also act as a wake-up call to the chiefs that, unlike their other rivals, the British thoroughly intended to make their mark on the country, and had the power to enforce it.
During his exile, the Sultan had the use of a government-owned residence at Union Vale in Victoria, Mahé. The other exiled chiefs were given allowances but remained under strict surveillance. The sultan and his chiefs were temporarily relocated to Félicité Island for five years, before being allowed to return to Victoria in 1882 when the turmoil in Perak had subsided. The sultan led a quiet life in the Seychellois community, and had communications access to Government House. After many years, the Sultan was pardoned following petitioning by the Seychellois and correspondence between W. H. Hawley of Government House, Mauritius, and Secretary of State for the Colonies Henry Holland. He was allowed to return to the Malay Peninsula, and spent most of his later life in Singapore and Penang before returning to Kuala Kangsar in Perak in 1922.Being the only candidate to the Sultanate who could be confidently ascertained to be innocent of the plot, Abdullah&#x27;s brother Yusuf was dully appointed Sultan, albeit one that would be considered far more of a British puppet than before. Despite this, the Malay population seemed largely to welcome the British as a source of stability compared to the often feuding chiefs. Initially, the now vacant role of British Resident was taken over by James Guthrie Davidson, previous resident of of Selangor. However, the low pay and insecure position resulted in him disengaging from the role and leaving after only one year in office. Needing someone both local and skilled enough to handle the complicated circumstances of Perak, the Governor would subsequently appoint the more experienced Hugh Low, who had spent much of the past twenty-eight years in nearby Labuan, and who was considered a safe pair of hands by both London and the Governor.

British Resident in Perak Hugh Low proved an effective administrator, preferring to adopt a generous approach that avoided confrontation with local leaders. As a result, he was able to secure the co-operation of many rajas and village &quot;penghulu&quot; with his policy rather than resorting to force, despite giving transport infrastructure little attention during his term. In 1882, Frank Swettenham succeeded Low for a second term as the Resident of Perak. During his mandate, Perak&#x27;s rail and road infrastructure was put in place. Increasing numbers of labourers were brought from India, primarily to work as railway and municipal coolies.The British introduced several changes to the local political structure, exerting influence on the appointment of the sultan and restricting the power of his chiefs to Malay local matters. The sultan and his chiefs were no longer entitled to collect taxes but received a monthly allowance from the state treasury in compensation. British intervention marked the beginning of Perak&#x27;s transition from a primarily Malay society to a multi-ethnic one. The new style of government worked to promote a market-driven economy, maintain law and order, and combat slavery, seen by the British as an obstacle to economic development and incompatible with a capitalist economy.

Under the Anglo-Siamese Treaty, signed in Bangkok in 1909, Siam ceded its northern Malay tributary states of Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis, and Terengganu and nearby islands to Great Britain. Exceptions were the Patani region, which remained under Siamese rule, and Perak, which regained the previously lost inland territory that became the Hulu Perak District. The treaty terms stipulated that the British, through their government of the FMS, would assume responsibility for all debts owed to Siam by the four ceded Malay states, and relinquish British extraterritorial rights in Siam.

=== Second World War ===
There had been a Japanese community in Perak since 1893, managing the bus service between the town of Ipoh and Batu Gajah, and running brothels in Kinta. There were a number of other Japanese-run businesses in Ipoh, including dentists, photo studios, laundries, tailors, barbers, and hotels. Activity increased as a result of the close relationship created by the Anglo-Japanese Alliance.Early in July 1941, a Ceylonese Malay policeman serving under the British administration in Perak raised an alert after a Japanese business owner living in the same building told him that Japanese troops were on their way, approaching not around Singapore from the sea, as expected by the British, but from Kota Bharu in Kelantan, with bicycle infantry and rubber boats. The policeman informed the British Chief Police Officer in Ipoh, but his claim was laughed off. By 26 December 1941, the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) had arrived in Ipoh, the capital, moving southwards from Thailand. The following day they went on to Taiping, leaving destruction and heavy casualties in their wake. The British forces, retreating from the north of the Malay Peninsula under Lieutenant-General Lewis Heath, had moved a further to the Perak River (Sungai Perak), damaging the route behind them to slow the Japanese advance. With the approval of Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival, the British mounted a defensive stand near the river mouth and in Kampar, leaving the towns of Ipoh, Kuala Kangsar and Taiping unguarded.Most civil administrations were closed down, since the European administrators and civilians evacuated south. By mid-December, the Japanese had reached Kroh in the interior of Perak, moving in from Kota Bharu in Kelantan. The Japanese arrived both from the east and by boat along the western coast. Within 16 days of their first landings, they had captured the entire northern part of the Malay Peninsula. The British were left trying to blockade the main road heading south from Ipoh. While the defending troops briefly slowed the Japanese at the Battle of Kampar and at the mouth of the Perak River, the Japanese advance along the trunk road, followed up with bombing and water-borne incursions, forced the British to retreat further south.

The Japanese occupied all of Malaya and Singapore. Tokugawa Yoshichika, of the Tokugawa clan whose ancestors were Shoguns who ruled Japan from the 16th to 19th centuries, proposed a plan for reform. Under its terms, Johor, Terengganu, Kelantan, Kedah-Penang, and Perlis would be restored and federated. Johor would control Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, and Malacca. An area in southern Johor would be incorporated into Singapore for defence purposes.

In the context of the military alliance between Japan and Thailand and their joint participation in the Burma campaign against the Allied forces, in 1943 the Empire of Japan gave Thailand back its former Malay tributary states of Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis, and Terengganu, which had been ceded to the British under the 1909 treaty. These territories were then administered as Thailand&#x27;s Four Malay States (), with Japanese troops maintaining a presence. Perak suffered under harsh military control, restricted movement, and tight surveillance throughout the Japanese occupation until 1945. The press in occupied Malaya, including the English-language occupation-era newspaper &quot;The Perak Times&quot;, was entirely under the control of the Dōmei News Agency (&quot;Dōmei Tsushin&quot;), publishing Japanese-related war propaganda. The Dōmei News Agency also printed newspapers in Malay, Tamil, Chinese, and Japanese.

The indigenous Orang Asli stayed in the interior during the occupation. Much of their community was befriended by Malayan Communist Party guerrillas, who protected them from outsiders in return for information on the Japanese and their food supplies. Strong resistance came mainly from the ethnic Chinese community, while some Malays collaborated with the Japanese through the Kesatuan Melayu Muda (KMM) movement for Malayan independence. But Malay support waned with increasingly harsh Japanese treatment of civilians during the occupation. Two Chinese guerrilla organisations operated within Perak in northern Malaya. One, the Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese Army (OCAJA), was aligned with the Kuomintang. The other, the Malayan Peoples&#x27; Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA), was closely associated with the Chinese Communist Party. Although both opposed the Japanese, there were clashes between the two groups.

Sybil Kathigasu, a Eurasian nurse and member of the Perak resistance, was tortured after the Japanese &quot;Kempeitai&quot; military police discovered a clandestine shortwave radio set in her home. John Davis, an officer of the British commando Force 136, part of the Special Operations Executive (SOE), trained local guerrillas prior to the Japanese invasion at the 101 Special Training School in Singapore, where he sought Chinese recruits for their commando teams. Under the codename Operation Gustavus, Davis and five Chinese agents landed on the Perak coast north of Pangkor Island on 24 May 1943. They established a base camp in the Segari Hills, from which they moved to the plains to set up an intelligence network in the state. In September 1943, they met and agreed to co-operate with the MPAJA, which then provided Force 136 with support and manpower. This first intelligence network collapsed, when many of its leaders, including Lim Bo Seng, were caught, tortured and killed by the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; in June 1944. On 16 December 1944, a second intelligence network, comprising five Malay SOE agents and two British liaison officers, Major Peter G. Dobree and Captain Clifford, was parachuted into Padang Cermin, near Temenggor Lake Dam in Hulu Perak under the codename Operation Hebrides. Its main objective was to set up wireless communications between Malaya and Force 136 headquarters in Kandy, British Ceylon, after the MPAJA&#x27;s failure to do so.

=== Post-war and independence ===
The Malay states became unstable following Japan&#x27;s surrender to the Allies in 1945. This was exacerbated by the emergence of nationalism and a popular demand for independence as the British Military Administration took over from 1945 to 1946 to maintain peace and order, before the British began introducing new administrative systems under the Malayan Union. The four Malay states held by Thailand during the war were returned to the British. This was done under a proposal by the United States, offering Thailand admission to the United Nations (UN) and a substantial American aid package to support its economy after the war. The MPAJA, under the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM), had fought alongside the British against the Japanese, and most of its members received awards at the end of the war. However, party policy become radicalised under the authority of Perak-born Chin Peng, who took over the CPM administration after former leader Lai Teck disappeared with party funds.Under Chin&#x27;s authority, the MPAJA killed those they considered to have been Japanese collaborators during the war, who were mainly Malays. This sparked racial conflict and Malay retaliation. Death squads were also dispatched by the CPM to murder European plantation owners in Perak, and Kuomintang leaders in Johor. The Malayan government&#x27;s subsequent declaration of a state of emergency on 18 June 1948 marked the start of the Malayan Emergency. Perak and Johor became the main strongholds of the communist movement, the former through native-born figureheads like Abdullah CD and Rashid Maidin. In the early stages their actions were not co-ordinated, and the security forces were able to counter them. Earlier in 1947, the head of the Perak&#x27;s Criminal Investigation Department, H. J. Barnard, negotiated an arrangement with the Kuomintang-influenced OCAJA leader Leong Yew Koh. This resulted in most OCAJA members being absorbed into the national Special Constabulary, and fighting against the MPAJA&#x27;s successor, the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA).The Kinta Valley, one of the richest tin mining areas in Malaya, accounted for most of the country&#x27;s tin exports to the United States. On 1 May 1952, the Perak Chinese Tin Mining Association established the Kinta Valley Home Guard (KVHG) to protect it from the communists. Often described as a private Chinese Army, most of the KVHG&#x27;s Chinese members had links to the Kuomintang. Many of the Kuomintang guerrillas were absorbed from the Lenggong area, where there were also members of Chinese secret societies whose main purpose was to defend Chinese private property against the communists. Throughout the first emergency the British authorities and their Malayan collaborators fought against the communists. This continued even after the proclamation of the independence of the Federation of Malaya, on 31 August 1957. As a result, most of the communist guerrillas were successfully pushed across the northern border into Thailand. Other radical left nationalist movements started in Perak like those under Ahmad Boestamam and Burhanuddin al-Helmy; but were eventually overwhelmed by the United Malays National Organisation&#x27;s local mobilisation in the same decade.

=== Malaysia ===

In 1961, the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman, sought to unite Malaya with the British colonies of North Borneo, Sarawak, and Singapore. The Federation of Malaysia came into being on 16 September 1963, despite growing opposition from the governments of Indonesia and the Philippines, and from communist sympathisers and nationalists in Borneo. The Indonesian government later initiated a &quot;policy of confrontation&quot; against the new state. This prompted the British, and their allies Australia and New Zealand, to deploy armed forces, although no skirmishes arising from the Indonesian attacks occurred around Perak. A second communist insurgency began in the Malay Peninsula in 1968. This affected Perak mainly through attacks from Hulu Perak by the communist insurgents who had previously retreated to the Thai border. The Perak State Information Office launched two types of psychological warfare to counter the increasing communist propaganda disseminated from the insurgents&#x27; hide-out. The campaign against the second insurgency was carried out as two separate efforts, because communist activities in Perak were split into two factions. One faction involved infiltrators from across the Thai border; the other was a communist group living among local inhabitants.

With the end of British rule in Malaya and the subsequent formation of the Federation of Malaysia, new factories were built and many new suburbs developed in Perak. But there was also rising radicalism among local Malay Muslims, with increasing Islamisation initiated by several religious organisations, and by Islamic preachers and intellectuals who caught the interest of both Malay royalty and commoners. Good relations with the country&#x27;s rulers resulted in Islamic scholars being appointed as palace officers and dignitaries, teachers, and religious judges, contributing to the further spread of Islam. Islam is now seen as a major factor that shaped current attitudes towards standing up for Malay rights.

== Geography ==
Perak has a total land area of , and is situated in the west of the Malay Peninsula on the coast of the Strait of Malacca. Its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) extends into the Strait. It is the second largest Malaysian state on the Malay Peninsula, and the fourth largest in Malaysia. The state has of coastline, of which are affected by coastal erosion. Mangrove forests grow along most of Perak&#x27;s coast, with the exception of Pangkor Island, with its rich flora and fauna, where several of the country&#x27;s forest reserves are located.There is extensive swampland along the coastal alluvial zones of the west coast between central Perak and southern Selangor. Perak has an overall total forest cover of , including of forest lands, of mangroves, and another of forest plantations. A total of of forest has been gazetted by the state government as forest reserve, scattered across 68 areas throughout the state.Perak&#x27;s geology is characterised by eruptive masses, which form its hills and mountain ranges. The state is divided by three mountain chains into the three plains of Kinta, Larut and Perak, running parallel to the coast. The Titiwangsa Range passes along the eastern borders of Perak, with its highest point, the Mount Korbu, is located in the district of Kinta near the border with the state of Kelantan. Other mountain ranges in Perak are the Bintang Mountains and the Keledang Range. Alluvium covers much of the plains, with detached masses of sedimentary rock appearing at rare intervals.

An extensive network of rivers originates from the inland mountain ranges and hills. Perak&#x27;s borders with the states of Kedah, Penang and Selangor are marked by rivers, including the Bernam and Kerian Rivers. Perak has 11 major river basins of more than . Of these, the Perak River basin is the largest, with an area of , about 70% of the total area of the state. It is the second largest river basin on the Malay Peninsula, after the Pahang River basin. The Perak River is the longest river in the state, at some , and is the Malay Peninsula&#x27;s second longest after the Pahang River. It originates in the mountains of the Perak-Kelantan-Yala border, snaking down to the Strait of Malacca. Other major rivers include the Beruas, Jarum Mas, Kurau, Larut, Manjung, Sangga Besar, Temerloh, and Tiram Rivers.

Perak is located in a tropical region with a typically hot, humid and wet equatorial climate, and experiences significant rainfall throughout the year. The temperature remains fairly constant, between . Humidity is often above 80%. Annual rainfall is about , with the central area of the state receiving an average of of rain. The state experiences two monsoon seasons: the northeast and southwest seasons. The northeast season occurs from November to March, the southwest from May to September, and the transitional months for the monsoon seasons are April and June. The northeast monsoon brings heavy rains, especially in the upper areas of Hulu Perak, causing floods. Little effect of the southwest monsoon is felt in the Kinta Valley, although coastal areas of southern Perak occasionally experience thunderstorms, heavy rain and strong, gusting winds in the predawn and early morning.

=== Biodiversity ===

The jungles of Perak are highly biodiverse. The state&#x27;s main natural park, Royal Belum State Park, covers an area of in northern Perak. It contains 18 species of frog and toad, 67 species of snake, more than 132 species of beetle, 28 species of cicada, 97 species of moth, and 41 species of dragonfly and damselfly. The park was further gazetted as a National Heritage Site by the federal government in 2012, and was inscribed on the World Heritage Site tentative list of UNESCO in 2017. Royal Belum State Park also hosts an estimated 304 bird species, including migratory species, in addition to birds endemic to the three forest reserve areas of Pangkor Island. Ten hornbill species are found within the area, including large flocks of the plain-pouched hornbill. Mammal species include the &quot;Seladang&quot;, Asian elephant, and Malayan tiger. The area is also notable for harbouring high concentrations of at least three &quot;Rafflesia&quot; species. The Pulau Sembilan (Nine Islands) State Park in western Perak covers an area of . Its coral reefs are home to coral reef fish species. In addition, 173 freshwater fish species have been identified as native to the state. Another natural attraction, the tin-mining ponds in Kinta District, was gazetted as a state park in 2016. The Kinta Nature Park, Perak&#x27;s third state park, covers an area of .
The government of Perak has stated its commitment to protecting its forests to ensure the survival of endangered wildlife species, and to protect biodiversity. The Perak Forestry Department is the state body responsible for forest management and preservation. In 2013, the state planted some 10.9 million trees under the &quot;26 Million Tree Planting Campaign: One Citizen One Tree&quot;, associated with global Earth Day.

Widespread conversion and reclamation of mangroves and mudflats for economic and residential purposes has caused the rapid decline of shore birds, 86% of the reduction on the Malay Peninsula having occurred on Perak&#x27;s coasts. Poaching in forest reserve areas has caused a stark decline in mammal populations. The Perak State Park Corporation estimates that there were only 23 Malayan tigers left within the state&#x27;s two forest reserves of Royal Belum and Temenggor in 2019. The state government of Perak has also been blamed in part for destroying forest reserves for the lucrative wood and palm oil businesses. Records since 2009 reveal that more than of permanent forest reserves have been degazetted in the state, the latest occurring within the Bikam Permanent Forest Reserve in July 2013. A number of business activities permitted by the state government have caused environmental damage, including to many of Perak&#x27;s rivers, which require extensive water treatment because of severe pollution. Between 1982 and 1994, the state government was embroiled in a radioactive environmental pollution controversy over the deaths of seven residents who suffered from birth defects and leukaemia resulting from exposure. The factory involved was only closed and cleaned up following lengthy court action by affected residents and increasing international pressure. No responsibility has been accepted by the associated companies, the state government, or the federal government. Although Perak has the highest number of mangrove reserves of the Malay Peninsula states, with 19 reserves in the mangroves of Matang, growing uncontrolled clearance of mangroves for aquaculture projects and residential areas is causing significant coastal erosion in addition to the damage resulting from climate change.

== Government and politics ==

Perak is a constitutional monarchy, with a ruler elected by an electoral college composed of the major chiefs. The sultan is the constitutional head of Perak. The current Sultan of Perak is Nazrin Shah, who acceded to the throne on 29 May 2014. The main royal palace is the Iskandariah Palace in Kuala Kangsar. Kinta Palace in Ipoh is used by the sultan as an occasional residence during official visits. Other palaces in Ipoh include the Al-Ridhuan Palace, Cempaka Sari Palace, and Firuz Palace.

The state government is headed by a &quot;Menteri Besar&quot; (Chief Minister), assisted by an 11-member Executive Council (Exco) selected from the members of the Perak State Legislative Assembly. The 59-seat Assembly is the legislative branch of Perak&#x27;s government, responsible for making laws in matters regarding the state. It is based on the Westminster system. Members of the Assembly are elected by citizens every five years by universal suffrage. The Chief Minister is appointed on the basis of his or her ability to command a majority in the Assembly. The majority (33 seats) is currently held by Barisan Nasional (BN) and Pakatan Harapan (PH).

Prior to the major British overhaul of Perak&#x27;s administration, slavery was widely practised along with a type of corvée labour system, called &quot;kerah&quot;. The chief of a given area could call on his citizens to work as forced labour without pay, although under normal circumstances food was still provided. The system was created to ensure the maintenance of the ruling class. It was often described as onerous and demanding, as there were times when the call to duty, and its duration, interfered with citizens&#x27; individual work. The slaves were divided into two classes: debtor-bondsmen and ordinary slaves. The debtor-bondsmen had the higher status, being ranked as free men and acknowledged as members of their masters&#x27; society. In contrast, the ordinary slaves had no prospect of status redemption. As Islam does not allow enslavement of fellow Muslims, the ordinary slaves came mainly from non-Muslim groups, especially the Orang Asli, Batak, and Africans purchased by Malays on pilgrimage in Mecca.

=== State administration issues and subsequent 2009 constitutional crisis ===

The opposition Pakatan Rakyat (PR) coalition won in Perak in the 2008 general election. Although the Democratic Action Party (DAP) had won the most seats of the opposition parties, Mohammad Nizar Jamaluddin of the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) was appointed &quot;Menteri Besar&quot; of the state. This happened because the state constitution states that the &quot;Menteri Besar&quot; must be a Muslim, unless the sultan specially appoints a non-Muslim to the office. As the DAP did not have any Muslim assemblymen in Perak at that time, the &quot;Menteri Besar&quot; had to come from one of its two allied parties, the People&#x27;s Justice Party (PKR) or the PAS. However, the national ruling party, Barisan Nasional (BN), gained control over the state government administration when three PR assemblymen, Hee Yit Foong (Jelapang), Jamaluddin Mohd Radzi (Behrang), and Mohd Osman Mohd Jailu (Changkat Jering) defected to the BN as independent assemblymen during the crisis, on 3 February 2009. A statement from the office of the Sultan of Perak urged the PR &quot;Menteri Besar&quot; to resign, but also refused to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly, which would have triggered new elections. Amid multiple protests, lawsuits and arrests, a new BN-led Assembly was sworn in on 7 May. The takeover was then ruled illegal by the High Court in Kuala Lumpur, on 11 May 2009, restoring power to the PR. The following day, the Court of Appeal of Malaysia suspended the High Court ruling pending a new Court of Appeal judgement. On 22 May 2009, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court&#x27;s decision and returned power to the BN. Many opposition party supporters believed that the crisis was effectively a &quot;power grab&quot;, in which the democratically elected government was ousted through the political machinations of the more dominant national ruling party.

=== Administrative divisions ===

Perak is divided into 12 districts (&quot;daerah&quot;), 81 &quot;mukims&quot;, and 15 local governments. There are district officers for each district and a village headperson (&quot;ketua kampung&quot; or &quot;penghulu&quot;) for each village in the district. Before the British arrived, Perak was run by a group of relatives and friends of the sultan who held rights to collect taxes and duties. The British developed a more organised administration following Perak&#x27;s integration into the Federated Malay States (FMS). The FMS government created two institutions, the State Council and the Malay Administrative Service (MAS). The two institutions encouraged direct Malay participation and gave the former ruling class a place in the new administrative structure. Most of the sultan&#x27;s district chiefs removed from authority at that time were given new positions in the State Council, although their influence was restricted to Malay social matters raised in council business. The sultan and the district chiefs were compensated for their loss of tax revenue with a monthly allowance from the state treasury.

The role of the local &quot;penghulus&quot; changed considerably when they were appointed no longer by the sultan but by the British Resident. Colonial land policy introduced individual landholding, thereby making land a commodity, and the &quot;penghulu&quot; were then involved in matters relating to this property. The Perak State Council was established in 1875 to assist the British Resident in most administrative matters. It also brought together the Malay chiefs and Chinese leaders (&quot;Kapitan Cina&quot;) to deal with certain administrative issues relating to Perak&#x27;s growing Malay and Chinese populations. The State Council also helped provide education and training to assist Malays in qualifying for government positions. When the post of the FMS Resident was abolished, other European-held administrative posts were gradually occupied by local appointees. As in the rest of Malaysia, local government comes under the purview of state government.

On 26 November 2015, it was announced that the Batang Padang District sub-district of Tanjung Malim would become Perak&#x27;s 11th district, to be called Muallim. Sultan Nazrin officiated at its formal creation on 11 January 2016. On 9 January 2017, the sultan proclaimed Bagan Datuk the 12th district of the state. The proclamation marked the start of transformation for the district, one of the biggest coconut producers in Malaysia.

== Economy ==


From the 1980s on, Perak began an economic transition away from the primary sector, where for decades income was generated by the tin mining industry. Early in 2006, the state government established the Perak Investment Management Centre (InvestPerak) to serve as the contact point for investors in the manufacturing and services sectors. The state&#x27;s economy today relies mainly on the tertiary sector. In 2017, the tourism industry contributed RM201.4 billion (14.9%) to the state gross domestic product (GDP).

Through the Eleventh Malaysia Plan (11MP), the state has set targets under its five-year 2016–2020 development plan, including economic development corridor targets for Southern Perak. Perak has several development corridors, with a different focus for each district. A 20-year masterplan was also formulated in 2017 to drive economic development in the state, with a development value of up to RM30 billion.

In the first quarter of 2018, the state received a total of RM249.8 million in investments. A year later, investments in the first quarter of 2019 had increased to RM1.43 billion. Perak ranks fifth after Penang, Kedah, Johor and Selangor in total value of investments. In 2018, investments of RM1.9 billion were planned for the implementation of a range of manufacturing projects and associated factory construction from 2019.

Since 2005, Perak has made efforts to remain the biggest agricultural producer in Malaysia. In 2008, the state sought to legalise the prawn-farming industry, mostly located in western Perak with some activity in Tanjung Tualang. In 2016, some 17,589 young people in Perak were involved in implementing a range of state initiatives in Perak&#x27;s agriculture sector. In 2019, the Perak State Agriculture Development Corporation (SADC) launched the Perak AgroValley Project to increase the state&#x27;s agricultural production. This initiative covers an area of in the Bukit Sapi Mukim Lenggong region. Most of Perak&#x27;s abandoned tin mine lakes provide suitable environments for the breeding of freshwater fish. 65% of abandoned mines have been used for fisheries production, with 30% of the fish exported to neighbouring Singapore and Indonesia. To further improve agricultural productivity and meet increasing demand, the state plans to expand the permanent cultivation of vegetables, flowers, coconut, palm oil, durian, and mango, in different areas throughout Perak. The construction sector accounted for 5.6% of Perak&#x27;s economic growth in 2015, dropping to 4.0% the following year. Development and housing projects represented the sector&#x27;s major contribution to the state&#x27;s economic growth.

=== Tourism ===
The tertiary sector is Perak&#x27;s main economic sector. In 2018, the state was the second most popular destination for domestic tourists in Malaysia, after the state of Pahang. Perak&#x27;s attractions include the royal town of Kuala Kangsar and its iconic buildings, such as the Iskandariah Palace, Pavilion Square Tower, Perak Royal Museum, Sultan Azlan Shah Gallery, and Ubudiah Mosque. The British colonial legacy in Perak includes the Birch Memorial Clock Tower, Ipoh High Court, Ipoh railway station, Ipoh Town Hall and Old Post Office, Kellie&#x27;s Castle, Majestic Station Hotel, Malay College Kuala Kangsar, Maxwell Hill (Bukit Larut), Perak State Museum, Royal Ipoh Club, St. John Church, and Taiping Lake Gardens. The historical events of the local Malay struggle are remembered in the Pasir Salak Historical Complex. There are also several historical ethnic Chinese landmarks, mainly in Ipoh, the capital. They include the Darul Ridzuan Museum building, a former wealthy Chinese tin miner&#x27;s mansion; Han Chin Pet Soo, a former club for Hakka miners and haven of shadowy activities; and the Leaning Tower of Teluk Intan.
The state also contains a number of natural attractions, including bird sanctuaries, caves, forest reserves, islands, limestone cliffs, mountains, and white sandy beaches. Among the natural sites are Banding Island, Belum-Temengor Forest Reserve, Kek Lok Tong Cave Temple and Zen Gardens, Kinta Nature Park, Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve, Mount Yong Belar, Pangkor Island, Tempurung Cave, and Ulu Kinta Forest Reserve. Recreational attractions include the Banjaran Hotsprings Retreat, D. R Seenivasagam Recreational Park, Gaharu Tea Valley Gopeng, Go Chin Pomelo Nature Park, Gunung Lang Recreational Park, Kinta Riverfront Walk, Kuala Woh Jungle Park, Lang Mountain, Lost World of Tambun, My Gopeng Resort, Perak Herbal Garden, Sultan Abdul Aziz Recreational Park, and Sungai Klah Hot Spring Park.

== Infrastructure ==
Perak has a 2016–2020 state government development plan. A Development Fund amounting to RM397,438,000 was approved by the State Legislative Assembly in 2016. The 2018 Budget allocated Perak a further RM1.176 billion, of which RM421.28 million was earmarked for development expenditure, and RM755.59 million for management costs. In addition to attracting investors, the state government is working to improve and build new infrastructure. The new government elected in 2018 announced its intention to continue development projects initiated by the previous government for all districts in Perak.

=== Energy and water resources ===
Electricity distribution in Perak is operated and managed by the Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB). The Temenggor Power Station in Gerik has a capacity of 348 MW, the largest of the many hydroelectric plants in the state. Built by the British, Chenderoh Power Station, the state&#x27;s oldest hydroelectric dam power station, has a capacity of 40.5 MW. Other hydroelectric power stations include the Sultan Azlan Shah Kenering Power Station (120 MW), Sultan Azlan Shah Bersia Hydroelectric Power Station (72 MW), Sungai Piah Lower Power Station (54 MW), and Sungai Piah Upper Power Station (14.6 MW). The 4,100 MW Manjung Power Plant, also known as the Sultan Azlan Shah Power Station, is a coal-fired power station located on an artificial island off the Perak coast. It is owned and operated by TNB Janamanjung, a wholly owned subsidiary of the TNB. The plant is considered one of the biggest Independent Power Producer (IPP) projects in Asia. The GB3 combined cycle power plant in Lumut, operated by Malakoff, has a capacity of 640 MW.

The state&#x27;s piped water supply is managed by the Perak Water Board (PWB), a corporate body established under the Perak Water Board Enactment in 1988. It serves over 2.5 million people and is among the biggest water operators on the Malay Peninsula, after Selangor and Johor. Before the PWB was established, water services were initially provided by the Perak Public Works Department, and subsequently by the Perak Water Supply Department. The state&#x27;s water supplies mainly come from its two major dams, the Air Kuning Dam in Taiping and the Sultan Azlan Shah Dam in Ipoh.

=== Telecommunications and broadcasting ===
Telecommunications in Perak was originally administered by the Posts and Telecommunication Department and maintained by the British Cable &amp; Wireless Communications, responsible for all telecommunication services in Malaya. The first telegraph line, connecting the British Resident&#x27;s Perak House in Kuala Kangsar to the house of the Deputy British Resident at Taiping, was laid by the Department of Posts and Telegraph in 1874. Further lines were then built to link all of the key British economic areas of the time, and in particular the British Straits Settlements territory. Following the foundation of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, in 1968 the telecommunications departments in Malaya and Borneo merged to form the Telecommunications Department Malaysia, which later became Telekom Malaysia (TM). The state remains committed to full co-operation with the federal government to implement the latest telecommunications development projects in Perak.

Perak is set to become the first Malaysian state to introduce the National Fiberisation and Connectivity Plan (NFCP) for high-speed Internet in rural areas. Television broadcasting in the state is divided into terrestrial and satellite television. There are two types of free-to-air television providers: MYTV Broadcasting (digital terrestrial) and Astro NJOI (satellite), while IPTV is accessed via Unifi TV through the UniFi fibre optic internet subscription service. The Malaysian federal government operates one state radio channel, Perak FM.

=== Transport ===

Malaysia&#x27;s North–South Expressway connects Perak with the other west coast Malaysian states and federal territories. Perak has two categories of roads, as of 2016 totalling of federal roads, and of state roads. A new highway, the West Coast Expressway, is being built to link the coastal areas of the state and reduce the growing traffic congestion. Perak has a dual carriageway road network and follows the left-hand traffic rule. Towns provide public transport, including buses, taxis, and Grab services. Under the Eleventh Malaysia Plan (11MP), around 23 infrastructure projects, worth RM4.7 billion, have been implemented. These include 11 road projects for the state, involving allocations of RM1.84 billion for upgrade and expansion works carried out by the Public Works Department (PWD).

Ipoh railway station, on Jalan Panglima Bukit Gantang Wahab in the state capital, is the oldest station of Perak&#x27;s rail network. It was built by the British in 1917, and upgraded in 1936. In 2019, an integrated development project was launched to upgrade the railway station and its surrounding areas. Boat services provide the main transport access to Pangkor Island, in addition to air travel. Sultan Azlan Shah Airport is Perak&#x27;s main international airport, acting as the main gateway to the state. Other public airports include Pangkor Airport and Sitiawan Airport, and there are private or restricted airfields such as Jendarata Airport and the military Taiping Airport.

=== Healthcare ===

Health services in Perak are administered by the Perak State Health Department (). The state&#x27;s main government hospital is the 990-bed Raja Permaisuri Bainun Hospital, previously known as the Ipoh Hospital, which also incorporates a women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s hospital. Other hospitals include four specialist hospitals: Taiping Hospital, Teluk Intan Hospital, Seri Manjung Hospital, and the minor speciality Slim River Hospital; nine district hospitals: Batu Gajah Hospital, Changkat Hospital, Gerik Hospital, Kampar Hospital, Kuala Kangsar Hospital, Parit Buntar Hospital, Selama Hospital, Sungai Siput Hospital, Tapah Hospital; and one psychiatric hospital: Bahagia Ulu Kinta Hospital. Other public health clinics, 1Malaysia clinics, and rural clinics are scattered throughout the state. There are a number of private hospitals, including the Anson Bay Medical Centre, Apollo Medical Centre, Ar-Ridzuan Medical Centre, Colombia Asia Hospital, Fatimah Hospital, Ipoh Pantai Hospital, Ipoh Specialist Centre, Kinta Medical Centre, Manjung Pantai Hospital, Perak Community Specialist Hospital, Sri Manjung Specialist Hospital, Taiping Medical Centre, and Ulu Bernam Jenderata Group Hospital. In 2009, the state&#x27;s doctor–patient ratio was 3 per 1,000.

=== Education ===
All primary and secondary schools are within the jurisdiction of the Perak State Education Department, under the guidance of the national Ministry of Education. Among the oldest schools in Perak are the King Edward VII School (1883), the Anglo-Chinese School (1895), and St. Michael&#x27;s Institution (1912). As of 2019, Perak had a total of 250 government secondary schools, six international schools (City Harbour International School, Fairview International School Ipoh Campus, Imperial International School Ipoh, Seri Botani International School, Tenby Schools Ipoh, and the Westlake International School), and nine Chinese independent schools. There is one Japanese learning centre, located in the state capital, Ipoh. Sultan Idris Education University is the sole public university, and there are three private universities: the Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR), Quest International University, and Universiti Teknologi Petronas, as well as the campus branch of the University of Kuala Lumpur Malaysian Institute of Marine Engineering Technology (UniKL MIMET), and the University of Kuala Lumpur Royal College of Medicine Perak (UniKL RCMP). Other colleges include the Cosmopoint College, Maxwell College Ipoh, Olympia College Ipoh, Sunway College Ipoh, Syuen College, Taj College, Tunku Abdul Rahman College Perak Branch Campus, and WIT College Ipoh Branch. There are several polytechnics, including the Sultan Azlan Shah Polytechnic in Behrang, and Ungku Omar Polytechnic in Ipoh.

== Demography ==
=== Ethnicity and immigration ===

The 2015 Malaysian Census reported the population of Perak at 2,477,700, making it the fifth most populous state in Malaysia, with a non-citizen population of 74,200. Of the Malaysian residents, 1,314,400 (53.0%) are Malay, 713,000 (28.0%) are Chinese, 293,300 (11.0%) are Indian, and another 72,300 (2.9%) identified as other bumiputera. In 2010, the population was estimated to be around 2,299,582, with 1,212,700 (52.0%) Malay, 675,517 (29.0%) Chinese, 274,631 (11.0%) Indian, and another 62,877 (2.7%) from other bumiputera. Once the most populous state during the British administration under the FMS, Perak has yet to recover from the decline of the tin-mining industry. The associated economic downturn resulted in a massive manpower drain to higher-growth states such as Penang, Selangor, and Kuala Lumpur.

The current constitution defines Malays as someone who is Muslim and assimilated with Malay community Traditionally, the native Malays mostly live in Lenggong, Gerik, Kinta, Bota and Beruas while the Javanese mostly lived in Hilir Perak, comprising Bagan Datuk, Batak Rabit, Sungai Manik, Teluk Intan, and a few other places along the Perak shores. The Mandailing and Rawa people were mostly in Gopeng, Kampar, Tanjung Malim, and Kampung Mandailing at Gua Balak. These people had mostly come from neighbouring Selangor, escaping the Klang War. The Buginese are found in Kuala Kangsar, especially in Kota Lama Kiri and Sayong. The few Minangkabau people in the state lived among the other ethnic groups with no distinct villages or settlements of their own. As of 2015, there were some 3,200 Malaysian Siamese in Perak, a legacy of the Siamese presence in the northern Malay states. There is also a scattered Acehnese presence, dating back to the rule of the Sultanate of Aceh.

Perak&#x27;s highest population density is mainly concentrated in the coastal and lowland areas. The Chinese and Indian population represents a higher percentage of the state&#x27;s total population than in the neighbouring northern Malay states. The presence of these groups was particularly significant after the British opened many tin mines and extensive rubber plantations in the mid-19th century. More than half of Perak&#x27;s inhabitants in the 1930s were Chinese immigrants. Perak&#x27;s Indian community is mostly of Tamil ethnicity, although it also includes other South Indian communities such as the Malayalees, principally in Sitiawan, Sungai Siput, Trolak and Kuala Kangsar; the Telugus, in Teluk Intan and Bagan Datuk; and the Sikhs, scattered in and around Perak, predominantly in Ipoh and Tanjung Tualang.

Population density is relatively low in much of Perak&#x27;s interior, where the indigenous Orang Asli are scattered, including in the northernmost border district of Hulu Perak. The indigenous people originally inhabited most of Perak&#x27;s coastal areas but were pushed deeper into the interior with the arrival of increasing numbers of Javanese, Banjar, Mandailing, Rawa, Batak, Kampar, Bugis and Minangkabau immigrants in the early 19th century. The Orang Asli oral traditions preserve stories of Rawa and Batak atrocities and enslavement of the aboriginal population.

=== Religion ===

As in the rest of Malaysia, Islam is recognised as the state religion, although other religions may be freely practised. According to the 2010 Malaysian Census, Perak&#x27;s population was 55.3% Muslim, 25.4% Buddhist, 10.9% Hindu, 4.3% Christian, 1.7% Taoist or followers of Chinese folk religion, 0.8% other religions or unknown, and 0.9% non-religious. The census indicated that 83.7% of Perak&#x27;s Chinese population identified as Buddhist, with significant minorities identifying as Christian (9.2%), Chinese folk religion adherents (5.8%), and Muslim (0.2%). The majority of the Indian population identified as Hindu (87.6%), with significant minorities identifying as Christian (6.01%), Muslim (2.67%), and Buddhist (1.0%). The non-Malay bumiputera community was predominantly irreligion (28.2%), with significant minorities identifying as Muslim (24.1%), and Christian (22.9%). Among the majority population, all Malay bumiputera identified as Muslim. Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia defines professing the Islamic faith as one of the criteria of being a Malay.

=== Languages ===
As a multi-ethnic state, Perak is also linguistically diverse. The main local variety of Malay spoken in the state is Perak Malay, which is characterised by its &quot;e&quot; (as in &quot;red&quot;, ) and its &quot;r&quot;, like the French &quot;r&quot; (). It is commonly spoken in central Perak, more specifically in the districts of Kuala Kangsar and Perak Tengah. Speakers of the northern Kedah Malay dialect are also found in the northern part of Perak, comprising Kerian, Pangkor Island, and Larut, Matang and Selama districts. In the northeastern part of Perak (Hulu Perak), and some parts of Selama and Kerian, the Malay people speak another distinct Malay language variant known as Reman Malay or locally known as &quot;Basa Ulu/Grik&quot; (named after Grik), which is most closely related to Kelantan-Pattani Malay in Kelantan and southern Thailand (Yawi) due to geographical proximity and historical assimilation. In the southern parts of Perak (Hilir Perak and Batang Padang), and also in the districts of Kampar and Kinta and several parts of Manjung, the dialect spoken is heavily influenced by the southern Malay dialects of the peninsula such as Selangor, Malacca, and Johore-Riau Malay. It is also influenced by several languages of the Indonesian archipelago: Javanese, Banjar, Rawa (a variety of Minangkabau), Batak (Mandailing), and Buginese, as a result of historical immigration, civil wars such as the Klang War, and other factors.

Among Perak&#x27;s various Chinese ethnicities, Malaysian Cantonese has become the lingua franca, although a number of dialects are spoken including Cantonese, Hakka, Mandarin, Teochew, Hokkien, and Hokchiu.

The Tamil community mainly speaks a Malaysian dialect of the Tamil language; the Malayalees speak Malayalam; the Telugus speak the Telugu language; and the Sikhs speak Punjabi. Over time, Tamil became a lingua franca among Perak&#x27;s different Indian communities as Tamil-speaking people became the majority in several west coast Malaysian states with higher Indian populations. A small number of Sinhala speakers also found in parts of the state capital, Ipoh.

Several Orang Asli languages are spoken within the state, all belonging to the Aslian branch of the Austroasiatic languages. These languages are Lanoh, Temiar, Jahai, Kensiu, Kintaq, and Semai.

Members of the Siamese community mainly speak a Southern Thai variant, and are fluent in Malay, also having some knowledge of some of the Chinese dialects. With the multi-ethnic make-up of Perak&#x27;s society, some people speak more than one language.

== Culture ==


Perak&#x27;s multicultural society reflects the influences of different ethnicities throughout its history. Several Malay art forms, such as embroidery and performances like &quot;dabus&quot;, show apparent Arab cultural influence. The state&#x27;s characteristic embroidery, &quot;tekat emas&quot; (gold embroidery), was once presented to royalty. Designs are based on floral, animal, and geometric motifs. &quot;Dabus&quot; has existed for some 300 years, and is inseparable from a ritual involving incantation. It was brought to Perak by traders from Sumatra, and practised by the Malay community in Lumut, Pasir Panjang Laut Village in Sitiawan, and Teluk Intan. The traditional Malay pottery handicraft called &quot;labu sayong&quot; is part of the art heritage of Kuala Kangsar. Its unique design is uninfluenced by foreign techniques. &quot;Labu sayong&quot; is associated with a dance called the &quot;sayong&quot;. Another dance local to the Malays of Perak is the &quot;bubu&quot;, known for 120 years, which originates from Tanjung Bidara Village on Tiga Parit Island.

Cantonese opera once flourished in the town of Ipoh, as the majority of Chinese there were Cantonese. The history of China, and particularly Hong Kong, is recreated in Qing Xin Ling Leisure and Cultural Village (nicknamed Little Guilin) in Ipoh, with painted wooden structures around a lake set among limestone hills and caves. Another ethnic Chinese cultural location in Perak is Bercham, originally called &quot;Wo Tau Kok&quot; in Cantonese in the 1950s. The area was formerly a tin mining centre, which also become one of the relocation points for Malayan ethnic Chinese during the British era under the government&#x27;s Briggs Plan to protect and distance them from communist influence. Perak&#x27;s Malay, Chinese, and Indian communities, representing its three main ethnic groups, each have their own traditional arts and dance associations to maintain and preserve their respective cultural heritage.

=== Cuisine ===
As a melting pot of different cultures, Perak features various cuisines. &quot;Lemang&quot;, a Malay delicacy made from glutinous rice cooked in a bamboo tube over a slow fire, is very popular in the state. It is mainly served during the festivities of Eid al-Fitr (&quot;Hari Raya Aidilfitri&quot;) and Eid al-Adha (&quot;Hari Raya Haji&quot;), along with &quot;rendang&quot;. The method of its preparation is believed to derive partly from the indigenous Orang Asli of Perak, explaining the origins of the dish. Another popular Malay delicacy is &quot;tempoyak&quot;, a durian extract that is preserved and kept in a traditional urn. It is commonly mixed with bird&#x27;s eye chillies and eaten with other dishes. Chinese cuisine is very common in Perak, because of the state&#x27;s history of Chinese migration and trade relations over centuries. It was traditionally popular chiefly in Ipoh. Through over 2,000 years of contact with India, the influence of Indian cuisine also spread in Perak. The state is particularly known as a producer of the Bali pomelo (&quot;limau bali&quot;). This fruit was introduced by Hugh Low, Perak&#x27;s fourth British Resident, who brought seedlings from the neighbouring Dutch East Indies and distributed them both in Penang and in Perak (mainly in Tambun). Other districts are also known for their agricultural production: Bidor for its guava, Hulu Perak (durian), Menglembu (groundnut), and Tapah (petai). Ipoh white coffee, a popular Malaysian drink, traces its origin to Ipoh.

=== Sports ===

Perak became a part of Malaya since 1957, and its athletes have represented Malaya, and later Malaysia, at the Summer Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, Asian Games, and Southeast Asian Games. The Perak State Youth and Sports Department was established in 1964 to raise the standard of sports in the state. Perak hosted the Sukma Games in 1994 and 2018. The state has a number of sports complexes, located around Ipoh and in other districts. The state government allocates funds for sports development to each district-level sports association.

Ipoh&#x27;s Perak Stadium is the main stadium for Perak F.C. (formerly Perak FA). The team was formed in 1951, although the state had had a football team since 1921. Perak F.C. won the Malaysia FA Cup in 1990 and 2004; the Malaysia Cup in 1926, 1931, 1957, 1967, 1970, 1998, 2000, and 2018; was runner-up in the Malaysia Super League in 2006–07 and 2018; and won the President Cup Malaysia in 2006–07, 2012 and 2014. The state women&#x27;s football team was runner-up in the Tun Sharifah Rodziah Cup in 1977, 1979 and 1992. Another notable stadium in the state is Naval Base Stadium in Lumut.

The annual field hockey tournament in Perak, the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup, traced its roots to former state Sultan Azlan Shah, an avid fan of the sport. Perak was the first Malaysian state to introduce e-sports, in the Sukma Games. The state government is further targeting e-sports development with the increase in youth interest.

<text>The Maccabees (), also spelled Machabees (, or , ; or ; , ), were a group of Jewish rebel warriors who took control of Judea, which at the time was part of the Seleucid Empire. Its leaders, the Hasmoneans, founded the Hasmonean dynasty, which ruled from 167 BCE (after the Maccabean Revolt) to 37 BCE, being a fully independent kingdom from 104 to 63 BCE. They reasserted the Jewish religion, expanded the boundaries of Judea by conquest, and reduced the influence of Hellenism and Hellenistic Judaism.

==Etymology==
The name Maccabee is often used as a synonym for the entire Hasmonean dynasty, but the Maccabees proper comprised Judas Maccabeus and his four brothers. The name Maccabee was a personal epithet of Judah, and the later generations were not his direct descendants. One explanation of the name&#x27;s origins is that it derives from the Aramaic &quot;maqqəḇa&quot;, &quot;the hammer&quot;, in recognition of Judah&#x27;s ferocity in battle. The traditional Jewish explanation is that Maccabee ( ) is an acronym for the Torah verse that was the battle-cry of the Maccabees, &quot;Mi kamocha ba&#x27;elim YHWH&quot;, &quot;Who is like You among the heavenly powers, oh God!&quot;, as well as an acronym for &quot;Matityahu haKohen ben Yochanan&quot; (Matthias the priest, son of John). The correlating Torah verse Exodus 15:11, &quot;The song of Moses and the Children of Israel by the Sea&quot;, makes a reference to &quot;elim&quot;, with a mundane notion of natural forces, heavenly might, war and governmental powers. The scholar and poet Aaron Kaminka argues that the name is a corruption of Machbanai, a mighty warrior in the army of King David.

==Background==
In the 2nd century BCE, Judea lay between the Ptolemaic Kingdom (based in Egypt) and the Seleucid Empire (based in Syria), monarchies which had formed following the death of Alexander the Great. Judea had initially come under Ptolemaic rule but fell to the Seleucids around 197 BCE, after the Battle of Panium, during the Fifth Syrian War. Judea at that time had been affected by the Hellenization initiated by Alexander the Great. Some Jews, mainly those of the urban upper class, notably the Tobiad family, wished to dispense with Jewish law and to adopt a Greek lifestyle. According to historian Victor Tcherikover, the main motive for the Tobiads&#x27; Hellenism was economic and political. The Hellenizing Jews built a gymnasium in Jerusalem, competed in international Greek games, &quot;removed their marks of circumcision and repudiated the holy covenant&quot;.

When Antiochus IV Epiphanes became ruler of the Seleucid Empire in 175 BCE, Onias III held the office of high priest in Jerusalem. To Antiochus, the high priest was merely a local governor within his realm, a man whom he could appoint or dismiss at will, while orthodox Jews saw the holder of the high priesthood as divinely appointed. Jason, the brother of Onias, bribed Antiochus to make him high priest instead of Onias. Jason abolished the traditional theocracy and &quot;received from Antiochus permission to convert Jerusalem into a Greek &quot;polis&quot; called Antioch&quot;. In turn, Menelaus then bribed Antiochus and was appointed high priest in place of Jason. Menelaus had Onias assassinated. Menelaus&#x27; brother Lysimachus stole holy vessels from the Temple; the resulting riots led to the death of Lysimachus. Menelaus was arrested for Onias&#x27; murder and was arraigned before Antiochus, but he bribed his way out of trouble. Jason subsequently drove out Menelaus and became high priest again. In 168 Antiochus pillaged the Temple, attacked Jerusalem and &quot;led captive the women and children.&quot; From this point onwards, Antiochus pursued a zealous Hellenizing policy in the Seleucid satrapies of Coele Syria and Phoenicia.
Now Antiochus was not satisfied either with his unexpected taking the city (Jerusalem), or with its pillage, or with the great slaughter he had made there; but being overcome with his violent passions, and remembering what he had suffered during the siege, he compelled the Jews to dissolve the laws of their country, and to keep their infants uncircumcised, and to sacrifice swine&#x27;s flesh upon the altar; against which they all opposed themselves, and the most approved among them were put to death. —Flavius Josephus, &quot;, Book 1.1 §2&quot;

The author of the First Book of Maccabees regards the Maccabean revolt as a rising of pious Jews against the Seleucid king (who had tried to eradicate their religion) and against the Jews who supported him. The author of the Second Book of Maccabees presents the conflict as a struggle between &quot;Judaism&quot; and &quot;Hellenism&quot;, concepts which he coined. Most modern scholars argue that King Antiochus reacted to a civil war between traditionalist Jews in the Judean countryside and Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem, though the king&#x27;s response of persecuting the religious traditionalists was unusual in antiquity, and was the immediate provocation for the revolt. According to Joseph P. Schultz, modern scholarship &quot;considers the Maccabean revolt less as an uprising against foreign oppression than as a civil war between the orthodox and reformist parties in the Jewish camp&quot;, but John J. Collins writes that while the civil war between Jewish leaders led to the king&#x27;s new policies, it is wrong to see the revolt as simply a conflict between Hellenism and Judaism, since &quot;[t]he revolt was not provoked by the introduction of Greek customs (typified by the building of a gymnasium) but by the persecution of people who observed the Torah by having their children circumcised and refusing to eat pork.&quot;

In the conflict over the office of high priest, traditionalists with Hebrew/Aramaic names like Onias contested with Hellenizers with Greek names like Jason and Menelaus. Some scholars point to social and economic factors in the conflict. What began as a civil war took on the character of an invasion when the Hellenistic kingdom of Syria sided with the Hellenizing Jews against the traditionalists. As the conflict escalated, Antiochus prohibited the practices of the traditionalists, thereby, in a departure from usual Seleucid practice, banning the religion of an entire people. The motives of Antiochus remain unclear: he may have been incensed at the overthrow of his appointee, Menelaus, or – encouraged by a group of radical Hellenizers among the Jews, he may have been responding to an orthodox Jewish revolt that drew on the Temple and the Torah for its strength. Other scholars argue that, while the rising began as a religious rebellion, it was gradually transformed into a war of national liberation.

According to 1 Maccabees, Antiochus banned many traditional Jewish and Samaritan religious practices: he made possession of the Torah a capital offense and burned the copies he could find; sabbaths and feasts were banned; circumcision was outlawed, and mothers who circumcised their babies were killed along with their families; and traditional Jewish ritual sacrifice was forbidden. It was said that an idol of Olympian Zeus was placed on the altar of the Temple and that Israelites set up altars to Greek gods and sacrificed &quot;unclean&quot; animals on them.

The main objective of Antiochus is explained throughout Chabad Chassidic thought. It says that Antiochus didn&#x27;t mind that the Jews kept the culture of Judaism, rather all he wanted was to eradicate the laws of the Torah (mitzvos) that weren&#x27;t logical but rather kept solely because it is God&#x27;s command. But when he saw that even the logical/rational and cultural commandments of the Torah were being practiced by the Jews in a way higher than logic, he then opposed Judaism in its entirety.

==Revolt==


In the narrative of &quot;I Maccabees&quot;, after Antiochus issued his decrees forbidding Jewish religious practice, a rural Jewish priest from Modi&#x27;in, Mattathias the Hasmonean, sparked the revolt against the Seleucid Empire by refusing to worship the Greek gods. Mattathias killed a Hellenistic Jew who stepped forward to offer a sacrifice to an idol in Mattathias&#x27; place. He and his five sons fled to the wilderness of Judah. After Mattathias&#x27; death about one year later in 166 BCE, his son Judah Maccabee led an army of Jewish dissidents to victory over the Seleucids in guerrilla warfare, which at first was directed against Hellenizing Jews, of whom there were many. The Maccabees destroyed pagan altars in the villages, circumcised boys and forced Jews into outlawry. As a result, one explanation of the name &quot;Maccabees&quot; is based on the Aramaic word for &quot;hammer&quot;, because they &quot;strike hammer blows against their enemies&quot;.

The revolt involved many battles, in which the Maccabean forces gained notoriety among the Seleucid army for their use of guerrilla tactics. After the victory, the Maccabees entered Jerusalem in triumph and ritually cleansed the Temple, reestablishing traditional Jewish worship there and installing Jonathan Maccabee as high priest. A large Seleucid army was sent to quash the revolt but returned to Syria on the death of Antiochus IV. Its commander Lysias, preoccupied with internal Seleucid affairs, agreed to a political compromise that restored religious freedom.

The Jewish festival of Hanukkah celebrates the re-dedication of the Temple following Judah Maccabee&#x27;s victory over the Seleucids. According to rabbinic tradition, the victorious Maccabees could only find a small jug of oil that had remained uncontaminated by virtue of a seal, and although it only contained enough oil to sustain the Temple menorah for one day, it miraculously lasted for eight days, by which time further oil could be procured.

== Hasmonean dynasty ==

Following the re-dedication of the Temple, the supporters of the Maccabees were divided over the question of whether to continue fighting. When the revolt began under the leadership of Mattathias, it was seen as a war for religious freedom to end the oppression of the Seleucids. However, as the Maccabees realized how successful they had been, many wanted to continue the revolt and conquer other lands with Jewish populations or to convert their peoples. This policy exacerbated the divide between the Pharisees and Sadducees under later Hasmonean monarchs such as Alexander Jannaeus. Those who sought the continuation of the war were led by Judah Maccabee.

On his death in battle in 160 BCE, Judah was succeeded as army commander by his younger brother, Jonathan, who was already high priest. Jonathan made treaties with various foreign states, causing further dissent between those who merely desired religious freedom and those who sought greater power.

In 142 BCE, Jonathan was assassinated by Diodotus Tryphon, a pretender to the Seleucid throne, and was succeeded by Simon Maccabee, the last remaining son of Mattathias. Simon gave support to Demetrius II Nicator, the Seleucid king, and in return Demetrius exempted the Maccabees from tribute. Simon conquered the port of Joppa, where the Gentile population were &#x27;forcibly removed&#x27;, and the fortress of Gezer. He expelled the garrison from the Acra in Jerusalem. In 140 BCE, he was recognised by an assembly of the priests, leaders and elders as high priest, military commander and ruler of Israel. Their decree became the basis of the Hasmonean kingdom. Shortly after, the Roman Senate renewed its alliance with the Hasmonean kingdom and commanded its allies in the eastern Mediterranean to do so also. Although the Maccabees won autonomy, the region remained a province of the Seleucid Empire, and Simon was required to provide troops to Antiochus VII Sidetes, the brother of Demetrius II. When Simon refused to give up the territory he had conquered, Antiochus took them by force.

Simon was murdered in 134 BCE by his son-in-law Ptolemy and was succeeded as high priest and king by his son John Hyrcanus I. Antiochus conquered the entire district of Judea but refrained from attacking the Temple or interfering with Jewish observances. Judea was freed from Seleucid rule on the death of Antiochus in 129 BCE. Independent Hasmonean rule lasted until 63 BCE, when the Roman general Pompeius intervened in the Hasmonean civil war, making it a client kingdom of Rome. The Hasmonean dynasty ended in 37 BCE when the Idumean Herod the Great became king of Israel, designated &quot;King of the Jews&quot; by the Roman Senate, effectively transforming the Hasmonean kingdom into the Herodian kingdom—a client kingdom of Rome.

==Biblical accounts==

The Maccabean story is preserved in the books of the First and Second Maccabees, which describe in detail the re-dedication of the Temple in Jerusalem and the lighting of the menorah. These books are not part of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) which came from the Jewish canon; however, they were part of the Alexandrian canon which is also called the Septuagint. Both books are included in the Old Testament used by the Catholic and Orthodox churches, since those churches consider the books deuterocanonical. They are not included in the Old Testament books in most Protestant Bibles since most Protestants consider the books apocryphal.

Multiple references to Hanukkah are made in the Mishnah (Bikkurim 1:6, Rosh HaShanah 1:3, Taanit 2:10, Megillah 3:4 and 3:6, Moed Katan 3:9, and Bava Kama 6:6), though specific laws are not described. The miracle of the one-day supply of oil lasting eight days is first described in the Talmud, committed to writing about 600 years after the events described in the books of Maccabees. The New Testament mentions Jesus visiting the temple during Hanukkah (John 10:22-23).

==Christian veneration and possible Jewish preceding tradition==
===The nine &quot;Holy Maccabean Martyrs&quot; in Christianity===

The second and fourth books of the Maccabees recount the martyrdom of seven Jewish brothers, their mother and their teacher. Although these are not said to be of the Maccabee family, they are referred to in Christianity as the &quot;Holy Maccabean Martyrs&quot; or the &quot;Holy Maccabees.&quot; According to one tradition, their individual names are Habim, Antonin, Guriah, Eleazar, Eusebon, Hadim (Halim), Marcellus, their mother Solomonia, and their teacher Eleazar.

The three Ethiopian books of Meqabyan (quite distinct works from the other four books of Maccabees), which are canonical in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, also refer to the Maccabee martyrs. The first of these books states that their father was a Benjamite named Maccabeus and that three of the brothers, who are called Abya, Seela, and Fentos, were captured and martyred for leading a guerrilla war against Antiochus Epiphanes.

From before the time of the Tridentine calendar, the Holy Maccabees had a commemoration in the Roman Rite liturgy within the feast of Saint Peter in Chains. This commemoration remained within the weekday liturgy when in 1960 Pope John XXIII suppressed this particular feast of Saint Peter. Nine years later, 1 August became the feast of Saint Alphonsus Maria de&#x27; Liguori, and the mention of the Maccabee martyrs was omitted from the General Roman Calendar, since in its 1969 revision it no longer admitted commemorations. The feast day of these saints is 1 August in both the Eastern Orthodox Church (for which 1 August is also the first day of the Dormition Fast) and the Catholic Church.

===Theory: Jewish ancient veneration===

While studying a floor mosaic discovered during the 2012-2016 campaigns at the Huqoq synagogue near the Sea of Galilee and dating to the 4th–5th centuries, Russian researcher Nina V. Braginskaya comes to a different conclusion from that of the dig director, Jodi Magness. Braginskaya puts forward that the mosaic reflects the ancient Jewish veneration of the nine Maccabee martyrs from the books of the Maccabees, which is later perpetuated just in Christianity, while Jewish tradition preserves only the rite of lighting a nine-branched candelabrum during Hanukkah. In her opinion, there is a direct relationship between the Jewish symbolic object and the Christian symbolic story, with the Hanukkah menorah undergoing a one-and-a-half-millennium long secondary symbolic interpretation in Judaism, while the Christian tradition kept the original meaning, that of a martyrdom-for-the-faith tradition. This interpretation would help to explain the unique iconography of this particular mosaic carpet, which is the only one found so far in synagogues of its period depicting scenes not found in the Hebrew Bible. Only due to the discovery of the Huqoq mosaic could the connection between the Jewish and Christian traditions be noticed and proposed for discussion, to Braginskaya.

<text>The University of Kansas (KU) is a public research university with its main campus in Lawrence, Kansas, United States. Two branch campuses are in the Kansas City metropolitan area on the Kansas side: the university&#x27;s medical school and hospital in Kansas City, Kansas, the Edwards Campus in Overland Park. There are also educational and research sites in Garden City, Hays, Leavenworth, Parsons, and Topeka, an agricultural education center in rural north Douglas County, and branches of the medical school in Salina and Wichita. The university is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;.

Founded March 21, 1865, the university was opened in 1866 under a charter granted by the Kansas State Legislature in 1864 and legislation passed in 1863 under the state constitution, which was adopted two years after the 1861 admission of the former Kansas Territory as the 34th state into the Union.

, 23,872 students were enrolled at the Lawrence and Edwards campuses with an additional 2,836 students enrolled at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) for a total enrollment of 26,708 students across the three campuses. Overall, the university (including KUMC) employed 3,196 faculty members (faculty, faculty administrators, librarians, and unclassified academic staff) .

Kansas&#x27;s athletic teams compete in NCAA Division I sports as the Jayhawks, as members of the Big 12 Conference. They field 16 varsity sports, as well as club-level sports for ice hockey, rugby, men&#x27;s volleyball, soccer, basketball, rock climbing, triathlon, cross country, track, swim, pickleball, table tennis, and water skiing.

==History==

On February 20, 1863, Kansas Governor Thomas Carney signed into law a bill creating the state university in Lawrence. The law was conditioned upon a gift from Lawrence of a $15,000 endowment fund and a site for the university, in or near the town, of not less than of land. If Lawrence failed to meet these conditions, Emporia instead of Lawrence would get the university.

The site selected for the university was a hill known as Hogback Ridge (later known as Mount Oread), which was privately donated by Charles L. Robinson, the Republican governor of the state of Kansas from 1861 to 1863, and one of the original settlers of Lawrence, Kansas. Robinson and his wife Sara bestowed the site to the State of Kansas in exchange for land elsewhere. The philanthropist Amos Adams Lawrence donated $10,000 of the necessary endowment fund, and the citizens of Lawrence raised the remaining money themselves via private donations. On November 2, 1863, Governor Carney announced Lawrence had met the conditions to get into the state university, and the following year the university was officially organized.
The school&#x27;s Board of Regents held its first meeting in March 1865, which is the event that KU dates its founding from. Work on the first college building began later that year. The school opened for classes on September 12, 1866, and the first class graduated in 1873. According to William L. Burdick, the first degree awarded by the university was a Doctor of Divinity, bestowed upon noted abolitionist preacher Richard Cordley.

During the early development of the University of Kansas, Chancellors Joshua Lippincott, Francis H. Snow, and Frank Strong, along with the Kansas Board of Regents, worked to establish the university as not only a center for higher education but also a representative agency of the state. Snow, who served from 1890 to 1901, emphasized scientific research and public engagement, while Strong, beginning in 1902, advanced the university’s role in public service. This vision aligned with the sentiments expressed by Professor M. S. Ward, who stated in 1891 that &quot;Students should find in the University preparation for all the various pursuits and callings of society. The ultimate aim of our own State University ought to be [promoting] the highest Christian culture, an ample professional training, [which] will make our civilization the highest possible on earth.&quot;

In an effort to appeal to the predominantly Christian population of Kansas, many of who in the early history of the university were critical of state money being used to fund a secular institution, Chancellor Lippincott sought to reassure the public that the University of Kansas maintained strong Christian values. In response to a concerned parent questioning the university’s mission, Lippincott wrote, &quot;The University is a Christian institution founded by a Christian state. We have daily prayers conducted for the most part by members of the Faculty of whom nearly all are Christian and several ministers of the Gospel.&quot;

Although the university was a secular institution, religion remained a central cultural force among students. In an 1880 community letter, an anonymous student reflected on the broader moral and spiritual purpose of education at KU, writing, &quot;We are all seeking the truth, we are all earnest in our effort to correctly solve the great problem of a worthy and useful existence—we all recognize the wonderful features of a Christian age and a Christian country and we all hope to be true men and women [of the country] and almost all acknowledge that in accomplishing this we need an inspiration which is not of this earth nor fashioned after this world.&quot;

Chancellor Lippincott emphasized the importance of individual development in higher education, distinguishing universities from more rigid collegiate institutions in other parts of the country. In a lecture to students, James Marvin, the third Chancellor of the University stated, &quot;Higher education should aid students to realize all their potentialities, but only in a university are all individualities respected. Colleges that require all students [to] follow the same course have a factory air about them. Students go through the same milling process and come out machines, but God did not intend man to be a machine, and the University of Kansas should be about His work.&quot;

Beginning in 1880, the University began to field intercollegiate athletics programs, starting with baseball. The University would introduce football in 1890, men&#x27;s basketball in 1898, a women&#x27;s club basketball team in 1902, and various other varsity athletics programs throughout the 20th century.

During World War I, the University of Kansas became a key training ground for military personnel, and courses were added for male students to reflect this. Military drills and coursework in military science were made mandatory for male students, and in 1918, KU established a unit of the Students&#x27; Army Training Corps (SATC) to provide academic and military instruction. Faculty contributed to war-related research, while female students supported Red Cross efforts. Chancellor Frank Strong emphasized KU’s role in preparing students for both military service and national responsibility. Strong was a vocal opponent of the United States entering a foreign war, and helped found the Kansas Branch of the League to Enforce Peace in 1915, which was a collection of activists who were opposed to American involvement in foreign conflicts. Strong advocated for patriotism during his later years as Chancellor, stating at the University Assembly in 1915 that &quot;it is America&#x27;s destiny to preserve Western Civilization, which seems to be destroying itself abroad. While the youth of Europe are on its battlefields, the youth of America must seek higher education to enable them to carry on the material for the leadership of the world. America and its universities, with the University of Kansas having a big place among them, must become the center of the greatest intellectual life that the next generation should know.&quot; In April 1917, after Congress declared a state of war, Strong sent a letter to Congress stating that the University &quot;has always been loyal to country and to the flag, and always will be.&quot;

During World War II, Kansas was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

===Landmarks and structures===

KU is home to the Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics, the Beach Center on Disability, Lied Center of Kansas and radio stations KJHK, 90.7 FM, and KANU, 91.5 FM.

==Student activities==
===Athletics===

The school&#x27;s sports teams, wearing crimson and blue, are called the Kansas Jayhawks. They participate in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I and in the Big 12 Conference. The University of Kansas has won thirteen National Championships all-time: six in men&#x27;s basketball (two Helms Foundation championships and four NCAA championships, most recently in 2022), three in men&#x27;s indoor track and field, three in men&#x27;s outdoor track and field, one in men&#x27;s cross country and one in women&#x27;s outdoor track and field. The home course for KU Cross Country is Rim Rock Farm. Their most recent championship came in 2022, the men&#x27;s basketball team won the 2022 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament.

Kansas football dates from 1890 and is one of the oldest continuous programs in the nation. They have played in the Orange Bowl three times: 1948, 1969, and 2008, as well as nine other bowl games. They are currently coached by Lance Leipold, who was hired in May 2021. From its inception in 1890 to 1929, the program saw consistent success, winning several conference titles in 4 different conferences. After joining the Big 6 Conference (which would eventually become the Big 8) in 1929, Kansas began to struggle in the win-loss column. With the formation of the Big 8 conference in 1960, Kansas became a consistent winner again and fielded legendary coaches like Pepper Rodgers, Don Fambrough, Bud Moore, and Glen Mason. In 2008, under the leadership of Mark Mangino, the #7 Jayhawks emerged victorious in their first BCS bowl game, the FedEx Orange Bowl, with a 24–21 victory over the #3 Virginia Tech Hokies. This capstone victory marked the end of the most successful season in school history, in which the Jayhawks went 12–1 (.923). The team plays at David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium, which recently underwent an $85 million renovation to add an indoor practice facility with a 120-yard field, an outdoor practice facility with 2 full fields and three partial fields, new locker rooms, a new weight training facility, new residencies for players, new offices, new turf, new seats, and a state-of-the-art video board.

The KU men&#x27;s basketball team has fielded a team every year since 1898. The Jayhawks are a perennial national contender, coached by Hall of Fame coach Bill Self. The team has won six national titles, including four NCAA tournament championships in 1952, 1988, 2008, and 2022. The basketball program is currently the winningest program in college basketball history with an overall record of 2,355–877 up to their Final Four appearance in the 2021–22 season. The team plays at Allen Fieldhouse. Perhaps its best-recognized player was Wilt Chamberlain, who played in the 1950s, later becoming an NBA star and Harlem Globetrotter.

Kansas has counted among its coaches James Naismith (the inventor of basketball), Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Phog Allen (&quot;the Father of basketball coaching&quot; and a Kansas alumnus himself), Dick Harp, Ted Owens, Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Roy Williams, and Basketball Hall of Fame inductee and former NBA Champion Detroit Pistons coach Larry Brown. Currently, Kansas is coached by Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Bill Self. In addition, legendary University of Kentucky coach and Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Adolph Rupp played for KU&#x27;s 1922 and 1923 Helms National Championship teams, and NCAA Hall of Fame inductee and University of North Carolina Coach Dean Smith played for KU&#x27;s 1952 NCAA Championship team. Both Rupp and Smith played under Phog Allen. Allen also coached Hall of Fame coaches Dutch Lonborg and Ralph Miller. Allen founded the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), which started what is now the NCAA Tournament. The Tournament began in 1939 under the NABC and the next year was handed off to the newly formed NCAA.

Notable non-varsity sports include rugby, men&#x27;s hockey, and men&#x27;s soccer. The rugby team owns its private facility and tours internationally every two years. The men&#x27;s hockey team plays in nearby Kansas City.

===Debate teams===
The University of Kansas has had more teams (70) compete in the National Debate Tournament than any other university. Kansas has won the tournament 6 times (1954, 1970, 1976, 1983, 2009, and 2018) and had 15 teams make it to the final four. Kansas trails only Northwestern (15) and Harvard (7) for most tournaments won and is tied with Dartmouth (6). Kansas also won the Copeland Award in 1981–82 and 2017–18.

===Media===
The university&#x27;s newspaper is &quot;University Daily Kansan&quot;, which placed first in the Intercollegiate Writing Competition of the prestigious William Randolph Hearst Writing Foundation competition. In the winter of 2008, a group of students created KUpedia, a wiki about all things KU. They received student funding for operations in 2008–09. The KU Department of English publishes the &quot;Coal City Review&quot;, an annual literary journal of prose, poetry, reviews, and illustrations. The &quot;Review&quot; typically features the work of many writers, but periodically spotlights one author, as in the case of 2006 Nelson Poetry Book Award-winner &quot;Voyeur Poems&quot; by Matthew Porubsky.

The &quot;University Daily Kansan&quot; operates outside of the university&#x27;s William Allen White School of Journalism and reaches at least 30,000 daily readers through its print and online publications.

The university houses the following public broadcasting stations: KJHK, a student-run campus radio station, KUJH-LP, an independent station that primarily broadcasts public affairs programs, and KANU, the NPR-affiliated radio station. Kansas Public Radio station KANU was one of the nation&#x27;s first public radio stations. KJHK, the campus radio has roots back to 1952 and is completely run by students.

==Center for Community Health and Development==

The university&#x27;s Center for Community Health and Development (formerly KU Work Group) was designated as a World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Community Health and Development in 2004. It is affiliated with the Department of Applied Behavioral Science and the Schiefelbusch Institute for Life Span Studies at the university, and supports community health and development through a variety of means, including its free online resource, the Community Tool Box.

==Foundations==
===University of Kansas Memorial Corporation===
The first union was built on campus in 1926 as a campus community center. The unions are still the &quot;living rooms&quot; of campus and include three locations – the Kansas Union and Burge Union at the Lawrence Campus and Jayhawk Central at the Edwards Campus. The KU Memorial Unions Corporation manages the KU Bookstore (with seven locations). The KU Bookstore is the official bookstore of KU. The corporation also includes KU Dining Services, with more than 20 campus locations, including The Market (inside the Kansas Union) and The Underground (located in Wescoe Hall). The KU Bookstore and KU Dining Services are not-for-profit, with proceeds supporting student programs, such as Student Union Activities.

===KU Endowment===
KU Endowment was established in 1891 as the university&#x27;s primary institutional foundation to manage and build the university&#x27;s endowment.

<text>John Keble (25 April 1792 – 29 March 1866) was an English Anglican priest and poet who was one of the leaders of the Oxford Movement. Keble College, Oxford, is named after him.

==Early life==
Keble was born on 25 April 1792 in Fairford, Gloucestershire, where his father, also named John Keble, was vicar of Coln St. Aldwyns. He and his brother Thomas were educated at home by their father until each went to Oxford. In 1806, Keble won a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He excelled in his studies and in 1810 achieved double first-class honours in both Latin and mathematics. In 1811, he won the university prizes for both the English and Latin essays and became a fellow of Oriel College. He was for some years a tutor and examiner at the University of Oxford.

While still at Oxford, he was ordained in 1816, becoming a curate to his father and then curate of St Michael and St Martin&#x27;s Church, Eastleach Martin, in Gloucestershire while still residing at Oxford. On the death of his mother in 1823, he left Oxford and returned to live with his father and two surviving sisters at Fairford.

Between 1824 and 1835, he was three times offered a position and each time declined on the grounds that he ought not separate himself from his father and only surviving sister. In 1828, he was nominated as provost of Oriel College but not elected.

==&quot;The Christian Year&quot;==

Meantime, he had been writing &quot;The Christian Year&quot;, a book of poems for the Sundays and feast days of the church year. It appeared in 1827 and was very effective in spreading Keble&#x27;s devotional and theological views. It was intended as an aid to meditation and devotion following the services of the Prayer Book. Though at first anonymous, its authorship soon became known, with Keble in 1831 appointed to the Chair of Poetry at Oxford, which he held until 1841. Victorian scholar Michael Wheeler calls &quot;The Christian Year&quot; simply &quot;the most popular volume of verse in the nineteenth century&quot;. In his essay on &quot;Tractarian Aesthetics and the Romantic Tradition&quot;, Gregory Goodwin claims that &quot;The Christian Year&quot; is &quot;Keble&#x27;s greatest contribution to the Oxford Movement and to English literature.&quot; As evidence, Goodwin cites E. B. Pusey&#x27;s report that 95 editions of this devotional text were printed during Keble&#x27;s lifetime, and &quot;at the end of the year following his death, the number had arisen to a hundred-and-nine&quot;.

By the time that the copyright expired in 1873, over 375,000 copies had been sold in Britain and 158 editions had been published. Despite its widespread appeal among the Victorian readers and the familiarity of certain well-known hymns, the popularity of Keble&#x27;s &quot;The Christian Year&quot; faded in the 20th century.

At Oxford, Keble met John Taylor Coleridge who introduced him to the writings not only of his uncle, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, but also of Wordsworth. He dedicated his &quot;Praelectiones&quot; to and greatly admired Wordsworth, who once offered to go over &quot;The Christian Year&quot; with a view to correcting the English. To the same college friend, he was indebted for an introduction to Robert Southey, whom he found to be &quot;a noble and delightful character,&quot; and the writings of the three, especially Wordsworth, had much to do with the formation of Keble&#x27;s own mind as a poet.

==Tractarianism and vicar of Hursley==

Delivered on 14 July 1833, his famous Assize Sermon on &quot;National Apostasy&quot; gave the first impulse to the Oxford Movement, also known as the Tractarian movement. It marked the opening of a term of the civil and criminal courts and is officially addressed to the judges and officers of the court, exhorting them to deal justly. Keble contributed seven pieces for Tracts for the Times, a series of short papers dealing with faith and practice. Along with his colleagues, including John Henry Newman and Edward Pusey, he became a leading light in the movement but did not follow Newman into the Roman Catholic Church.

In 1835, his father died, and Keble and his sister retired from Fairford to Coln. In the same year he married Charlotte Clarke, and the vicarage of Hursley in Hampshire, becoming vacant, was offered to him; he accepted. In 1836, he settled in Hursley and remained for the rest of his life as a parish priest at All Saints&#x27; Church. In 1841 his neighbour Charlotte Mary Yonge, a resident at Otterbourne House in the adjacent village of Otterbourne, where Keble was responsible for building a new church, compiled &quot;The Child&#x27;s Christian Year: Hymns for every Sunday and Holy-Day&quot; to which Keble contributed four poems, including &quot;Bethlehem, above all cities blest&quot;.

In 1857, he wrote one of his more important works, his treatise on Eucharistical Adoration, written in support of George Denison, who had been attacked for his views on the Eucharist.

==Other writings==
In 1836, he published his edition of &quot;Hooker&#x27;s Works&quot;. In 1838, he began to edit, in conjunction with Edward Bouverie Pusey and John Henry Newman, the &quot;Library of the Fathers&quot;. A volume of &quot;Academical and Occasional Sermons&quot; appeared in 1847. Other works were a &quot;Life of Wilson, Bishop of Sodor and Man&quot;. After his death, &quot;Letters of Spiritual Counsel&quot; and 12 volumes of Parish Sermons were published.

Extracts from a number of his verses found their way into popular collections of Hymns for Public Worship, such as &quot;The Voice that Breathed o&#x27;er Eden&quot;, &quot;Sun of my soul, Thou Saviour dear&quot;, &quot;Blest are the pure in heart&quot; and &quot;New every morning is the love&quot;.

&quot;Lyra Innocentium&quot; was being composed while Keble was stricken by what he always seems to have regarded as the great sorrow of his life, the decision of Newman to leave the Church of England for Catholicism.

==Death==
Keble died in Bournemouth on 29 March 1866 at the Hermitage Hotel, after visiting the area to try and recover from a long-term illness as he believed the sea air had therapeutic qualities. He is buried in All Saints&#x27; churchyard, Hursley.

==Legacy==

Keble has been described thus:He was absolutely without ambition, with no care for the possession of power or influence, hating show and excitement, and distrustful of his own abilities... Though shy and awkward with strangers, he was happy and at ease among his friends, and their love and sympathy drew out all his droll playfulness of wit and manner... In personal appearance he was about middle height, with rather square and sloping shoulders, which made him look short until he pulled himself up, as he often did with &#x27;sprightly dignity.&#x27; His head, says Mozley, &#x27;was one of the most beautifully formed heads in the world,&#x27; the face rather plain-featured, with a large unshapely mouth, but the whole redeemed by a bright smile which played naturally over the lips; and under a broad and smooth forehead he had &#x27;clear, brilliant, penetrating eyes which lighted up quickly with merriment kindled into fire in a moment of indignation... a quiet country clergyman, with a very moderate income, who sedulously avoided public distinctions, and held tenaciously to an unpopular School all his life.
John Keble is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 14 July (the anniversary of his Assize Sermon), and a commemoration observed on 29 March (the anniversary of his death) elsewhere in the Anglican Communion. Keble College, Oxford, was founded in his memory, and John Keble Church, Mill Hill, and the ancient clapper bridge over the River Leach near the church in which he was curate in the village of Eastleach Martin were named after him.

The view from Bulverton Hill, Sidmouth, where Keble was a frequent visitor, is thought to have inspired some of his best loved work. The hill commands a panoramic view of the Lower Otter Valley and Dartmoor in the distance. Folklore suggests that his favourite spot was where a wooden bench known as Keble&#x27;s Seat has been in place for many years.
The &#x27;Te Deum&#x27; window in the south-east transept of St Peter&#x27;s Church, Bournemouth, was commissioned as a memorial to Keble, who had preferred to sit in the transept when worshipping at St Peter&#x27;s daily in the last months of his life. Later, in 1906, the transept was re-configured as the Keble Chapel.

Lives of Keble include one by John Taylor Coleridge (1869), who said, &quot;The Christian Year is so wonderfully scriptural. Keble&#x27;s mind was, by long, patient and affectionate study of Scripture, so imbued with it that its language, its train of thought, its mode of reasoning, seems to flow out into his poetry, almost, one should think, unconsciously to himself.&quot; Another is by Walter Lock (1895). In 1963 Georgina Battiscombe wrote a biography titled &quot;John Keble: A Study in Limitations&quot;.

<doc id="163334" wikidata="Q7966515" url="?curid=163334" title="Walter de Merton">
<text>Walter de Merton ( – 27 October 1277) was Lord Chancellor of England, Archdeacon of Bath, founder of Merton College, Oxford, and Bishop of Rochester. For the first two years of the reign of Edward I he was – in all but name – Regent of England during the King&#x27;s absence abroad. He died in 1277 after falling from his horse, and is buried in Rochester Cathedral.

==Early life==
Walter was born in around 1205 to a land-owning family at Basingstoke; beyond that there is no definite information about the date or place of birth. His mother was Christina Fitz-Oliver and his father William. By 1237 both his parents were dead, and Walter was a clerk in holy orders. He was perhaps educated at Merton Priory, but certainly was employed there as a young clerk, receiving from it the benefice of Cuddington. In 1241, Walter became clerk to Nicholas Farnham, quondam rector of another of Merton&#x27;s parishes, Long Ditton, and now promoted to bishop of Durham.

==Career==
In 1241, Walter already held a number of livings in various parts of the country; in 1256 he was an agent for Walter of Kirkham, bishop of Durham, in a lawsuit. Walter was also prothonotary of the chancery in 1258.

Walter rose to prominence as a skilled lawyer and negotiator. When Henry III went to France to negotiate the 1259 Treaty of Paris, Walter was left behind as a trusted royal servant. On 29 March, the Justiciar ordered 100 barons to muster in London for a secret meeting that would take them overseas. Only a few days later Walter could be seen at Malden, Surrey, assisting in the registration of the Justiciar&#x27;s army. The writs were pre-dated, then considered a new procedure at some risk to the messengers&#x27; delivery of the writs to Sheriffs in the locality. Walter also helped in the complex financial dealing with King Louis IX of France, when he reached London on 30 April. In return for a promise of peace, Henry received 12,500 Livres, the equivalent of 500 Knight&#x27;s Fees. By 1264, this would be a total of 134,000 Livres of subsidy from the King of France. Walter played an invaluable part in the administration of Henry&#x27;s revenues. By 1259, Walter had suitably impressed the king that he was granted a prebendary of St. Paul&#x27;s, London.

===Lord Chancellor===
On 12 July 1261 Henry III made him chancellor, in place of Nicholas of Ely. A month earlier, the Papal Bulls in support of Henry&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état had ensured it was safe for the king to return to the Tower of London. With a mercenary at his back, he had marched from Dover over Whitsun. In London, Walter was reinstalled as chancellor in a &#x27;resumption of royal power&#x27;, having been briefly challenged by the baronial movement.

Walter provided legal arguments for the collection of tallage, rejection of the baronial constitution, the appointment of royal Sheriffs, and a renewed attempt to justify the collection of Customs. Now only a cussed Philip Basset, among the barons, remained aloof from the fray, when the King&#x27;s new ministrations emerged against the Provisions of Oxford. As one of the arbitrators, Walter met the barons with Walerand and Basset. He was probably not the king&#x27;s first choice among the nobility, but the sticking point remained the method by which to appoint sheriffs, from &#x27;faithful men and people&#x27; in the shires.

Later that month of May 1261, De Merton had helped define &quot;Jus regalitatis&quot;, a law that prohibited criticism of the King; a flagrant breach of the commitment at Oxford. A year later, Henry would describe the sheriffs as &quot;bachelarii regis qui tenent comitatus&quot; or his bachelors. For the regents were men of the second rank, not nobles, yet they owed their elevated status entirely to royal service.

In 1262, Walter acquired lucrative sinecures such as the new prebendary of Exeter, and became a canon of Wells. The following year, when de Montfort was at the height of his powers, Walter was urged by the bishop of Worcester to accept a form of peace &quot;satis competens et honesta.&quot; It is possible that Walter was a member of Richard of Cornwall&#x27;s deputation sent from Windsor to greet Montfort&#x27;s army coming east from London and Kent. But on 16 July, when the king surrendered peace terms, and three days later de Montfort assumed power, Walter also left office.

===Merton College===

In 1261, two manors in Surrey were set aside for the support of &quot;scholars residing at the schools&quot; at Merton Priory; it was the beginning of Merton College. In 1264, Walter drew up statutes for a &quot;house of the scholars of Merton&quot;, at Malden in Surrey; ten years later these scholars were transferred to Oxford, and a permanent house was established. Merton College, thus founded and endowed, was one of the earliest examples of collegiate life at Oxford. De Merton&#x27;s statutes provided for a common corporate life under the rule of a warden but, as vows were to be taken and scholars entering a monastic order forfeited their scholarship, the college was really a place of training for the secular clergy.

Freed from the responsibilities of government, Walter turned his attention to his college again. The statutes were redrafted and scholars moved permanently to Oxford. They were established on the site of the parish church of St John whose advowson he had obtained in the early 1260s and where he had been buying adjoining houses and halls since 1264. In 1270 he bought Kibworth Harcourt, Leicestershire as part of the confiscated estate of Saer de Harcourt, an erstwhile supporter of Simon de Montfort. While De Merton was labouring for the establishment of Merton College, the barons emerged triumphant. Walter, a partisan friend of Henry III, was removed from the chancellorship in 1263. He was not immediately restored after the king&#x27;s victory, but he did renew his acquaintance with the royal circle, by now at Windsor.

===Edward I and Chancellor Merton===
Walter is mentioned as a Justiciar in 1271. He was re-appointed as Lord Chancellor, four days after Henry III&#x27;s death on 16 November 1272. For the first two years of Edward I&#x27;s reign he was in all but name regent of England during the king&#x27;s absence abroad. He was tasked with investigation into the 20,000 marks collected (1266) from tallage, about which many complaints had sparked the ire of the Citizens of London. Violent clashes on the streets worried King Edward in his first year on the throne. The &quot;vulgus&quot; (common people) clamoured for heads at the Guildhall, and the election of the baronial party. Merton argued that the &quot;communa&quot; election was a matter for Parliament, whereas the Aldermanic vote clashed with the other jurisdiction. Merton&#x27;s joint tribunal, appointed before Henry III&#x27;s death, was redundant until Edward I could appoint a royal warden. On 11 November, Edward wisely moved, prompted by his Chancellor, to enable counsellors to control the &#x27;men of Belial&#x27;. The violence subsided: Merton successfully negotiated the elected Walter Hervey as Mayor, and so he &quot;announced before all the people at the cross of St Paul&#x27;s that the aldermen had agreed to have Walter as mayor for that year.&quot; The contemporary historian, Matthew Paris, who died in 1275, left voluminous histories about these events.

===Bishop of Rochester===
Edward I had left England in 1268 to participate in the Ninth Crusade and, in the new king&#x27;s absence, Merton stood in his place, effective Regent of England. Edward commanded the respect of his household and wardrobe, anticipating a welcome return. This is signified in a letter of 9 August sent from Melun, France in which Walter was promised the King&#x27;s full support. However, on Edward&#x27;s return to England, Walter was dismissed as Lord Chancellor on 21 September 1274, in favour of Robert Burnell, who became a strong ally of the Edwardian regime. Walter&#x27;s compensation for this was the see of Rochester, to which he was elected in late July 1274, being consecrated on the 21 October following.

==Death and legacy==
He eagerly awaited in anticipation the appointment of a Warden of the new Merton College. For the last three years of his life, Walter divided his time between his duties in Rochester and the supervision of his fledgling academic house. On a journey back from Oxford in 1277, while fording the Medway, he fell from his horse; and died two days later on 27 October 1277 from his injuries. He was buried in Rochester Cathedral, where his tomb can still be visited. Walter de Merton was described in the &quot;Annales monastici&quot; as a man of liberality and great worldly learning, ever ready in his assistance to the religious orders.

<text>Sir Peter Levin Shaffer (15 May 1926 – 6 June 2016) was an English playwright, screenwriter, and novelist. He is best known for the plays &quot;Equus&quot; and &quot;Amadeus&quot;, the latter of which was adapted for the screen by Miloš Forman, with a screenplay by Shaffer, for which he won an Academy Award.

==Early life==
Shaffer was born to a Jewish family in Liverpool, the son of Reka (née Fredman) and estate agent Jack Shaffer. He grew up in London and was the identical twin brother of fellow playwright Anthony Shaffer.

He was educated at the Hall School, Hampstead, and St Paul&#x27;s School, London, and subsequently he gained a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, to study history. Shaffer was a Bevin Boy coal miner during World War II, and took a number of jobs including bookstore clerk, and assistant at the New York Public Library, before discovering his dramatic talents.

==Theatrical career==
Shaffer&#x27;s first play, &quot;The Salt Land&quot; (1955), was presented on ITV on 8 November 1955. Encouraged by this success, Shaffer continued to write and established his reputation as a playwright in 1958, with the production of &quot;Five Finger Exercise&quot;, which opened in London under the direction of John Gielgud and won the Evening Standard Drama Award. When &quot;Five Finger Exercise&quot; moved to New York City in 1959, it was equally well received and landed Shaffer the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award for Best Foreign Play.

Shaffer&#x27;s next piece was a double bill, &quot;The Private Ear and The Public Eye&quot;, two plays each containing three characters and concerning aspects of love. They were presented in May 1962 at the Globe Theatre, and both starred Maggie Smith and Kenneth Williams. Smith won the Evening Standard Theatre Award for Best Leading Actress.

The National Theatre was established in 1963, and virtually all of Shaffer&#x27;s subsequent work was done in its service. His canon contains a mix of philosophical dramas and satirical comedies. &quot;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot; (1964) presents the conquest and killing of the Inca ruler Atahuallpa by the conquistador Francisco Pizarro in Peru, while &quot;Black Comedy&quot; (1965) takes a humorous look at the antics of a group of characters feeling their way around a pitch-black room – although the stage is actually flooded with light.
&quot;Equus&quot; (1973) won Shaffer the 1975 Tony Award for Best Play as well as the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award. A journey into the mind of a seventeen-year-old stableboy who had plunged a spike into the eyes of six horses, &quot;Equus&quot; ran for more than 1,000 performances on Broadway. It was revived by Massachusetts&#x27; Berkshire Theatre Festival in the summers of 2005 and 2007, by director Thea Sharrock at London&#x27;s Gielgud Theatre in February 2007, and on Broadway (in the Sharrock staging) in September 2008. The latter production, which ran in New York City until February 2009, required the stableboy to appear naked; its star, Daniel Radcliffe, was still associated with the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series intended for general audiences, and this led to mild controversy.

Shaffer followed this success with &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1979) which won the Evening Standard Drama Award and the Theatre Critics&#x27; Award for the London production. This tells the story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and court composer Antonio Salieri who, overcome with jealousy at hearing the &quot;voice of God&quot; coming from an &quot;obscene child&quot;, sets out to destroy his rival. When the show moved to Broadway it won the 1981 Tony Award for Best Play and, like &quot;Equus&quot;, ran for more than a thousand performances.

After the success of &quot;Amadeus&quot;, Shaffer wrote the play &quot;Lettice and Lovage&quot; specifically for Dame Maggie Smith in 1986, for which he was nominated for another Tony Award and for which Smith eventually won the Tony Award for best actress after three nominations in 1990. &quot;Lettice and Lovage&quot; also enabled Margaret Tyzack to win the award for best featured actress, and the production was nominated for best direction of a play, at the 1990 Tony Awards.

==Screen adaptations==
Several of Shaffer&#x27;s plays have been adapted to film, including &quot;Five Finger Exercise&quot; (1962); &quot;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot; (1969); &quot;The Public Eye&quot; (1962), from which he adapted the 1972 film &quot;Follow Me!&quot; (1972); &quot;Equus&quot; (1977); and &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1984), which won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

For writing the screenplay for &quot;Equus&quot;, Schaffer was nominated for an Academy Award for his adapted screenplay, but the award went to Alvin Sargent, who wrote the screenplay for &quot;Julia&quot;. For writing the screenplay for &quot;Amadeus&quot;, Shaffer was awarded a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award.

==Personal life and death==
Shaffer was gay. In the 1970s, Shaffer was in a relationship with Paul Giovanni, musician and composer of &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;. His later partner, New York-based voice teacher Robert Leonard, died in 1990 at the age of 49. Shaffer lived in Manhattan from the 1970s onward.

While on a trip to Ireland shortly after his 90th birthday, Shaffer died on 6 June 2016 at a hospice facility in Curraheen, County Cork. Leonard and Shaffer are buried together in the east side of Highgate Cemetery.

==Awards==
In 1989 the Hamburg-based Alfred Toepfer Foundation awarded Shaffer its annual Shakespeare Prize in recognition of his life&#x27;s work. In 1993, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Letters) by the University of Bath.

Shaffer&#x27;s play, &quot;Five Finger Exercise&quot; won the Evening Standard Drama Award when it premiered in London and then won the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award for Best Foreign Play when it moved to New York City.

Shaffer&#x27;s play, &quot;Equus&quot; won the Tony Award for Best Play and the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle that year as well. His screenplay adaptation of the play was nominated for a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar in 1978.

Shaffer&#x27;s play &quot;Amadeus&quot; won the Evening Standard Drama Award and the Theatre Critics&#x27; Award for its initial London production. Upon moving to Broadway, &quot;Amadeus&quot; won the 1981 Tony Award for Best Play. His screenplay adaptation of the play won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar as well as the Golden Globe Best Screenplay in 1984.

Shaffer&#x27;s play &quot;Lettice and Lovage&quot; was nominated for another Tony Award, and for her performance in it, Dame Maggie Smith won the Tony Award for best actress after three nominations in 1990. &quot;Lettice and Lovage&quot; also won best supporting actress for Margaret Tyzack and was nominated for best direction of a play in 1990 Tony Awards.

==Honours==
Shaffer was appointed a CBE in 1987 and named Knight Bachelor in the 2001 New Year&#x27;s Honours. In 2007, he was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

<text>Anthony Joshua Shaffer (15 May 19266 November 2001) was an English playwright, screenwriter, novelist, barrister, and advertising executive. He is best remembered for his Tony Award winning play &quot;Sleuth&quot;, and its acclaimed 1972 film adaptation. His screenplays included Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Frenzy&quot; and folk horror &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;.

==Early life==
Shaffer was born to a Jewish family in Liverpool, the son of Reka (née Fredman) and Jack Shaffer, who was an estate agent with his wife&#x27;s family. He was the identical twin brother of writer and dramatist Peter Shaffer, and they had another brother, Brian. He graduated with a law degree from Trinity College, Cambridge.

==Career==
Shaffer worked as a barrister and advertising copywriter before becoming a full-time writer.

Shaffer&#x27;s most notable work was the play &quot;Sleuth&quot; (1970), which won the Tony Award for Best Play. The play was later adapted for the film version starring Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. He received Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America for both versions: for Best Play in 1971, and Best Screenplay in 1973.

His other major screenplays include the Hitchcock thriller &quot;Frenzy&quot; (1972) and the British cult thriller &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; (1973) with whose director, Robin Hardy, Shaffer had previously set up a television production company Hardy, Shaffer &amp; Associates.

==Personal life==

Shaffer was married three times – to Henrietta Glaskie, Carolyn Soley (with whom he had two children, Claudia and Cressida), and Australian actress Diane Cilento.

Shaffer met Cilento in 1973, when she appeared in &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;. He moved to Australia in 1975 and married Cilento in 1985. Together they built a house (&quot;The Castle&quot;) and a theatre (&quot;The Karnak Playhouse&quot;). Shaffer was legally domiciled in Australia (where he owned land and a restaurant, paid taxes and voted in elections), although he did maintain a flat in London.

In the last years of his life Shaffer had an extramarital relationship with Marie Josette &quot;JoJo&quot; Capece-Minutolo when in London. Cilento did not accompany Shaffer to England but remained in Australia. After Shaffer&#x27;s death, Capece-Minutolo made a claim on his estate in the British High Court, arguing that Shaffer had intended to divorce Cilento and marry her and that he had given her an engagement ring. The Shaffer estate argued that Shaffer had no desire to end his marriage to Cilento. The judge found that despite Shaffer&#x27;s being in &quot;an intimate and loving relationship&quot; with Capece in London, Shaffer and his estate were not legally domiciled in the United Kingdom at the time of his death, and that therefore Capece-Minutolo had no legal claims on his estate, other than any bequest in Shaffer&#x27;s will, which had been changed in 1999.

<text>Maceo Parker (; born February 14, 1943) is an American funk and soul jazz saxophonist, best known for his work with James Brown in the 1960s, Parliament-Funkadelic in the 1970s and Prince in the 2000s. Parker was a prominent soloist on many of Brown&#x27;s hit recordings, and a key part of his band, playing alto, tenor and baritone saxophones. Since the early 1990s, he has toured under his own name.

==Biography==
Parker was born in Kinston, North Carolina, United States. Parker&#x27;s father played piano and drums in addition to singing in church with Parker&#x27;s mother; his brother Melvin played drums and his brother Kellis played the trombone. Parker and his brother Melvin joined James Brown in 1963; in his autobiography, Brown claims that he originally wanted Melvin as his drummer, but agreed to additionally take Maceo under his wing as part of the deal. In March 1970, Parker, his brother Melvin, and a few of Brown&#x27;s band members left to establish the band Maceo &amp; All the King&#x27;s Men, which toured for two years.

In January 1973, Parker rejoined James Brown&#x27;s group. He also charted a single &quot;Parrty – Part I&quot; (No. 71 pop singles) with Maceo &amp; the Macks that year. In 1975, Parker and some of Brown&#x27;s band members, including Fred Wesley, left to join George Clinton&#x27;s band Parliament-Funkadelic. Parker once again re-joined James Brown from 1984 to 1988.

In the 1990s, Parker began a solo career. His first album of this period &quot;Roots Revisited&quot; spent 10 weeks at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Contemporary Jazz Charts. To date he has released 11 solo albums since 1990. Parker&#x27;s 1992 live album, &quot;Life on Planet Groove&quot;, is considered to be his seminal live album, marking his first collaboration with Dutch saxophonist Candy Dulfer.

In 1993, Parker made guest appearances on hip hop group De La Soul&#x27;s album &quot;Buhloone Mindstate&quot;. In the late 1990s, Parker began contributing semi-regularly to recordings by Prince and accompanying his band, The New Power Generation, on tour. He also played on the Jane&#x27;s Addiction track &quot;My Cat&#x27;s Name Is Maceo&quot; for their 1997 compilation album &quot;Kettle Whistle&quot;. In 1998, Parker performed as a guest on &quot;What Would You Say&quot; on a Dave Matthews Band concert, which also became one of their live albums, &quot;Live in Chicago 12.19.98&quot;.

In 2004, Parker toured as a part of Prince&#x27;s band for the &quot;Musicology Live 2004ever&quot; tour and again in 2007 he performed as part of Prince&#x27;s band for Prince&#x27;s 21 nights at the O2 arena. Parker also played as part of Prince&#x27;s band for his 21-night stay at LA&#x27;s Forum in 2011.

In 2008, Maceo Parker closed the Edmonton International Jazz Festival at Urban Lounge.
Parker&#x27;s album &quot;Roots &amp; Grooves&quot; with the WDR Big Band is a tribute to Ray Charles, whom Parker cites as one of his most important influences. The album won a Jammie for best Jazz Album in 2009. Parker followed this up with another collaboration with WDR Big Band in 2012 with the album &quot;Soul Classics&quot;.

In October 2011, Parker was inducted in the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame.

In July 2012, Parker was the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from Victoires Du Jazz in Paris. He continues touring, headlining many jazz festivals in Europe and doing as many as 290 concerts a year.

In May 2016, Parker received The North Carolina Heritage Award from his home state.

Parker toured with the Ray Charles Orchestra and the Raelettes performing a tribute to Ray Charles at major festivals worldwide, including Monterey Jazz Festival in 2016 and Playboy Jazz Festival in 2019.

==Book and media==
In February 2013, Maceo Parker published his autobiography, &quot;98% Funky Stuff: My Life in Music&quot; with the publisher Chicago Review Press. 

Parker was portrayed by Craig Robinson in the 2014 James Brown biopic &quot;Get on Up&quot;.

==Equipment==
Maceo plays a gold-plated Selmer Mark VI alto saxophone and the mouthpiece he uses is a #3 Brilhart Ebolin. Maceo&#x27;s reed of choice is the Vandoren Java, 3.5 gauge.

<doc id="163347" wikidata="Q181413" url="?curid=163347" title="Julie Christie">
<text>Julie Frances Christie (born 14 April 1940) is a British actress. Christie&#x27;s accolades include an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe, and a Screen Actors Guild Award. She has appeared in six films ranked in the British Film Institute&#x27;s BFI Top 100 British films of the 20th century, and in 1997, she received the BAFTA Fellowship for lifetime achievement.

Christie&#x27;s breakthrough film role was in &quot;Billy Liar&quot; (1963). She came to international attention for her performances in &quot;Darling&quot; (1965), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress, and &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (also 1965), the eighth highest-grossing film of all time after adjustment for inflation. She continued to receive Academy Award nominations, for &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; (1971), &quot;Afterglow&quot; (1997) and &quot;Away from Her&quot; (2007).

In addition, Christie starred in &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; (1966), &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; (1967), &quot;Petulia&quot; (1968), &quot;The Go-Between&quot; (1971), &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot; (1973), &quot;Shampoo&quot; (1975), and &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978). She is also known for her performances in &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1996) as well as &quot;Finding Neverland&quot;, &quot;Troy&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (all 2004).

==Early life==
Christie was born on 14 April 1940 at Singlijan Tea Estate, Chabua, Assam, British India, to Rosemary, a Welsh-born painter and Frank, who ran the tea plantation where she grew up. She has a younger brother, Clive, and an older (deceased) half-sister, June, from her father&#x27;s relationship with an Indian tea picker on his plantation. At the age of six she was sent to live with a foster mother so she could attend a convent school in England. Her parents separated when Julie was a child, and after their divorce, she spent time with her mother in rural Wales.

She was baptised in the Church of England, and studied as a boarder at the independent Convent of Our Lady school in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, after being expelled from another convent school for telling a risqué joke that reached a wider audience than she had anticipated. After being asked to leave the Convent of Our Lady as well, she attended the all-girls Wycombe Court School, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, during which time she lived with a foster mother from the age of six. At the Wycombe school, she played the Dauphin in a production of Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Saint Joan.&quot; She went to Paris to finish schooling and learn French. She later returned to England and studied at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London.

==Career==
=== Early career ===
Christie made her professional stage debut in 1957, and her first screen roles were on British television. Her earliest role to gain attention was in BBC serial &quot;A for Andromeda&quot; (1961). She was a contender for the role of Honey Ryder in the first James Bond film, &quot;Dr. No&quot;, but producer Albert R. Broccoli reportedly thought her breasts were too small.

=== 1960s ===
Christie appeared in two comedies for Independent Artists: &quot;Crooks Anonymous&quot; and &quot;The Fast Lady&quot; (both 1962). Her breakthrough role was as Liz, the friend and would-be lover of the character played by Tom Courtenay in &quot;Billy Liar&quot; (1963), for which she received a BAFTA Award nomination. The director, John Schlesinger cast Christie only after another actress, Topsy Jane, had dropped out of the film. It resulted in her being put under contract by Nat Cohen. Christie appeared as Daisy Battles in &quot;Young Cassidy&quot; (1965), a biopic of Irish playwright Seán O&#x27;Casey, co-directed by Jack Cardiff and (uncredited) John Ford.

Her role as an amoral model in &quot;Darling&quot; (also 1965) led to Christie becoming known internationally; it also inspired the singer Tony Christie to take his stage name from Christie. Directed by Schlesinger and co-starring Dirk Bogarde and Laurence Harvey, Christie had only been cast in the lead role after Schlesinger insisted, the studio having wanted Shirley MacLaine. She received the Academy Award for Best Actress and the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress in a Leading Role for her performance.

In David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (also 1965), adapted from the epic/romance novel by Boris Pasternak, Christie&#x27;s role as Lara Antipova became her best known. The film was a major box-office success. , &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; is the 8th highest-grossing film of all time, adjusted for inflation. According to &quot;Life&quot; magazine, 1965 was &quot;The Year of Julie Christie&quot;.

After dual roles in François Truffaut&#x27;s adaptation of the Ray Bradbury novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; (1966), starring with Oskar Werner, she appeared as Thomas Hardy&#x27;s heroine Bathsheba Everdene in Schlesinger&#x27;s &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; (1967). After moving to Los Angeles in 1967 (&quot;I was there because of a lot of American boyfriends&quot;), she appeared in the title role of Richard Lester&#x27;s &quot;Petulia&quot; (1968), co-starring with George C. Scott. Christie&#x27;s persona as the swinging sixties British woman she had embodied in &quot;Billy Liar&quot; and &quot;Darling&quot; was further cemented by her appearance in the documentary &quot;Tonite Let&#x27;s All Make Love in London&quot;. In 1967, &quot;Time&quot; magazine said of her: &quot;What Julie Christie wears has more real impact on fashion than all the clothes of the ten best-dressed women combined&quot;.

=== 1970s ===
In Joseph Losey&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;The Go-Between&quot; (1971), Christie had a lead role along with Alan Bates. The film won the Grand Prix, then the main award at the Cannes Film Festival. She earned a second Best Actress Oscar nomination for her role as a brothel madam in Robert Altman&#x27;s postmodern western &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; (also 1971). The film was the first of three collaborations between Christie and Warren Beatty, who described her as &quot;the most beautiful and at the same time the most nervous person I had ever known&quot;. The couple had a high-profile but intermittent relationship between 1967 and 1974. After the relationship ended, they worked together again in the comedies &quot;Shampoo&quot; (1975) and &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978).

Her other films during the decade were Nicolas Roeg&#x27;s thriller &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now &quot; (1973), based on a story by Daphne du Maurier, in which she co-starred with Donald Sutherland, and the science-fiction/horror film &quot;Demon Seed&quot; (1977), based on the novel of the same name by Dean Koontz and directed by Donald Cammell. &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot; in particular has received acclaim, with Christie nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, and in 2017 a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine ranked it the greatest British film ever.

Christie returned to the United Kingdom in 1977, living on a farm in Wales. In 1979, she was a member of the jury at the 29th Berlin International Film Festival. Never a prolific actress, even at the height of her career, Christie turned down many high-profile film roles, including &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot;, &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot;, &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot;, and &quot;Reds&quot;, all of which earned Oscar nominations for the actresses who eventually played them.

=== 1980s ===
In the 1980s, Christie appeared in non-mainstream films such as &quot;The Return of the Soldier&quot; (1982) and &quot;Heat and Dust&quot; (1983). She had a major supporting role in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s &quot;Power&quot; (1986) alongside Richard Gere and Gene Hackman, but apart from that, she avoided large budget films. She starred in the television film &quot;Dadah Is Death&quot; (1988), based on the Barlow and Chambers execution, as Barlow&#x27;s mother Barbara, who desperately fought to save her son from being hanged for drug trafficking in Malaysia.
=== 1990s ===
After a lengthy absence from the screen, Christie co-starred in the fantasy adventure film &quot;Dragonheart&quot; (1996), and appeared as Gertrude in Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (also 1996). Her next critically acclaimed role was the unhappy wife in Alan Rudolph&#x27;s domestic comedy-drama &quot;Afterglow&quot; (1997) with Nick Nolte, Jonny Lee Miller and Lara Flynn Boyle. Christie received a third Oscar nomination for her role. Appearing in six films that were ranked in the British Film Institute&#x27;s 100 greatest British films of the 20th century, in recognition of her contribution to British cinema Christie received BAFTA&#x27;s highest honour, the Fellowship in 1997. In 1994, she had been awarded the title Doctor of Letters from the University of Warwick.

=== 21st century ===
Christie made a brief cameo appearance in the third &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film, &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (2004), playing Madam Rosmerta. Around the same time, she also appeared in two other high-profile films: Wolfgang Petersen&#x27;s &quot;Troy&quot; and Marc Forster&#x27;s &quot;Finding Neverland&quot; (both 2004), playing mother to Brad Pitt and Kate Winslet, respectively. The latter performance earned Christie a BAFTA nomination as supporting actress in a film.
Christie portrayed the female lead in &quot;Away from Her&quot; (2006), a film about a long-married Canadian couple coping with the wife&#x27;s Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Based on the Alice Munro short story &quot;The Bear Came Over the Mountain&quot;, the movie was the first feature film directed by Christie&#x27;s sometime co-star, Canadian actress Sarah Polley. She took the role, she says, only because Polley is her friend. Polley has said Christie liked the script but initially turned it down as she was ambivalent about acting. It took several months of persuasion by Polley before Christie finally accepted the role.

In July 2006 she was a member of the jury at the 28th Moscow International Film Festival. Debuting at the Toronto International Film Festival on 11 September 2006 as part of the TIFF&#x27;s Gala showcase, &quot;Away from Her&quot; drew rave reviews from the trade press, including &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, and the four Toronto dailies. Critics singled out her performances as well as that of her co-star, Canadian actor Gordon Pinsent, and Polley&#x27;s direction. Christie&#x27;s performance generated Oscar buzz, leading the distributor, Lions Gate Entertainment, to buy the film at the festival to release the film in 2007 to build momentum during the awards season.

On 5 December 2007, she won the Best Actress Award from the National Board of Review for her performance in &quot;Away from Her&quot;. She won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Drama, the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role and the Genie Award for Best Actress for the same film. On 22 January 2008, Christie received her fourth Oscar nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role at the 80th Academy Awards. She appeared at the ceremony wearing a pin calling for the closure of the prison in Guantanamo Bay.

Christie narrated &quot;Uncontacted Tribes&quot; (2008), a short film for the British-based charity Survival International, featuring previously unseen footage of remote and endangered peoples. She has been a long-standing supporter of the charity, and in February 2008, was named as its first &#x27;Ambassador&#x27;. She appeared in a segment of the film, &quot;New York, I Love You&quot; (also 2008), written by Anthony Minghella, directed by Shekhar Kapur and co-starring Shia LaBeouf, as well as in &quot;Glorious 39&quot; (2009), about a British family at the start of World War II.

Christie played a &quot;sexy, bohemian&quot; version of the grandmother role in Catherine Hardwicke&#x27;s gothic retelling of &quot;Red Riding Hood&quot; (2011). Her most recent role was in the political thriller &quot;The Company You Keep&quot; (2012), where she co-starred with Robert Redford and Sam Elliott.

== Personal life ==
She is fluent in French and Italian.

In the early 1960s, Christie dated actor Terence Stamp. She had a live-in relationship with Don Bessant, a lithographer and art teacher, from December 1962 to May 1967, before dating actor Warren Beatty for seven on-and-off years (1967–1974). Christie was also linked romantically with musician Brian Eno, record producer Lou Adler, director Jim McBride and photographer Terry O&#x27;Neill.

Christie is married to journalist Duncan Campbell; they have lived together since 1979, but the date they married is disputed. In January 2008, several news outlets reported that the couple had quietly married in India two months earlier, in November 2007, which Christie called &quot;nonsense&quot;, adding, &quot;I have been married for a few years. Don&#x27;t believe what you read in the papers.&quot;

In the late 1960s, her advisers adopted a very complex scheme in an attempt to reduce her tax liability, giving rise to the leading case of &quot;Black Nominees Ltd v Nicol (Inspector of Taxes)&quot;. The case was heard by Judge Sydney Templeman (who later became Lord Templeman), who gave judgement in favour of the Inland Revenue, ruling that the scheme was ineffective.

She is active in various causes, including animal rights, environmental protection, and the anti-nuclear power movement. She is a Patron of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, as well as Reprieve, and the CFS/ME charity Action for ME. Christie is a vegetarian.

<doc id="163348" wikidata="Q2747986" url="?curid=163348" title="Billy Liar">
<text>Billy Liar is a 1959 novel by Keith Waterhouse that was later adapted into a play, a film, a musical and a TV series. The work has inspired and been featured in a number of popular songs.

The semi-comical story is about William Fisher, a working-class 19-year-old living with his parents in the fictional town of Stradhoughton in Yorkshire. Bored by his job as a lowly clerk for an undertaker, Billy spends his time indulging in fantasies and dreams of life in the big city as a comedy writer.

==Characters==
;William &quot;Billy&quot; Fisher
:Billy is 19, and living with parents Alice and Geoffrey, and his grandmother, Florence Boothroyd. Billy lies compulsively to everyone he comes across, whether it is by claiming that his father is a retired naval captain/cobbler, or telling his parents that Arthur&#x27;s mother has broken her leg. Billy works as a clerk for undertakers Shadrack &amp; Duxbury. He is engaged to two girls and in love with a third, and he constantly refers to a vague job offer writing scripts in London for comedian &quot;Danny Boon&quot;.

;Alice Fisher
:Billy&#x27;s mother. She rarely sits down in the play, constantly working hard to keep the house tidy and look after her husband, her mother, and Billy.

;Geoffrey Fisher
:Billy&#x27;s father. Geoffrey uses the word &quot;bloody&quot; in his sentences so often it has lost all meaning. Geoffrey has been a successful garage owner who also works in the removal business so his family live middle-class lives despite his working-class background. Geoffrey has a short temper, but otherwise rarely shows emotion. Relations between Geoffrey and Billy have broken down, providing the story&#x27;s main source of conflict.

;Florence Boothroyd
:Billy&#x27;s grandmother, Alice&#x27;s mother. She is ignored by her family and never seen as a loved character until the end. Florence talks to the sideboard more than her own family, and is always drinking tea out of a pint pot. She keeps pots of condensed milk upstairs. Florence falls ill in Act 2 and is taken upstairs. By Act 3, she has died. She likely has a form of dementia because of her strange behaviour throughout the book. Her age is either 80 or 81 years old, and she was born in August.

;Arthur Crabtree
:Billy&#x27;s best friend. Arthur works at Shadrack &amp; Duxbury with Billy. When we first see Arthur and Billy together in Act 1, they adopt thick northern accents and engage in buffoonery, imitating their elders. Despite this tomfoolery, Arthur&#x27;s mood towards Billy changes in Act 3. Arthur does not appear in Act 2.

;Barbara
:One of Billy&#x27;s fiancees. Barbara is prudish, always eating oranges, and harbours dreams of living with Billy in a cottage in Devon, with &quot;little Billy and little Barbara&quot;. She finds out about other girlfriends later in the play.

;Rita
:Rita is 17, is short, but comes across as a &quot;hard lass&quot;. She is engaged to Billy, and has a habit of mimicking Billy every time he offers an excuse for her missing engagement ring. Unbeknown to her, it is on Barbara&#x27;s finger. Rita appears in Acts 2 and 3.

;Liz
:Liz is described as a scruffy girl in need of a new skirt, but she&#x27;s the one who truly understands Billy and the only one in which he&#x27;s genuinely interested. Before her appearance in the play, Billy pretends he does not have much interest in her, but it is clear when she appears that he is still smitten with her.

==Adaptations==
===Stage play===
In 1960, the novel&#x27;s author, Keith Waterhouse, co-wrote a three-act stage version with Willis Hall. The action took place on a single set combining the living-room, hallway, and porch of the Fisher household. The first production opened in the West End of London with Albert Finney in the title role. It has since been produced all over the world, and has become a favourite with amateur groups. The play was adapted for the Irish stage as &quot;Liam Liar&quot; by Hugh Leonard in 1976.

The play is set in one Saturday: Act 1 in the morning, Act 2 in the early evening, and Act 3 at night.

===Film===

The 1963 film was directed by John Schlesinger and featured Tom Courtenay, who played the part when Albert Finney left the cast in the West End play, as Billy and Julie Christie as Liz, one of his three girlfriends. Mona Washbourne played Mrs. Fisher, and Wilfred Pickles played Mr. Fisher. Rodney Bewes, Finlay Currie, and Leonard Rossiter also had roles.

===British television series===

The novel was also used as the basis for a sitcom made by London Weekend Television in 1973–1974, starring Jeff Rawle as Billy. The series was scripted by the play&#x27;s writers, Waterhouse and Hall, and the action was updated to the 1970s. George A. Cooper reprised his West End role as Billy&#x27;s father. Other regular cast members included Pamela Vezey as Alice, Colin Jeavons as Shadrack, May Warden as Billy&#x27;s grandmother, and Sally Watts as Barbara. Several new girlfriends were also introduced.

The series was shown on the Seven Network in Australia during the non-ratings season of 1975–1976, shown on CBC Television in Canada in 1975–1976, and shown on RTÉ 2 in Ireland in 1982. It has never been rerun, although the first series was released on Region 2 DVD in August 2006. The second series was released in March 2007. The complete series was released on 07/05/2018.

===Stage musical===

In 1974, a successful West End musical (entitled simply &quot;Billy&quot;) starred Michael Crawford and, in her West End debut, Elaine Paige. The cast also included Gay Soper, Avis Bunnage, Bryan Pringle and Lockwood West. The book was by well-known British sitcom writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, and the music and lyrics were by film composer John Barry and Don Black respectively.

===American television series===
An American adaptation entitled &quot;Billy&quot; and starring Steve Guttenberg, Peggy Pope, and James Gallery aired briefly on CBS in 1979.

==In popular culture==

*Waterhouse later wrote a sequel called &quot;Billy Liar on the Moon&quot;.
*There is also an acoustic folk/punk singer from Scotland called Billy Liar.
*&quot;Billy Liar&quot; is the title of the second track of &quot;Her Majesty the Decemberists&quot; by The Decemberists.
*Saint Etienne sampled some lines from the movie in their song &quot;You&#x27;re in a Bad Way&quot;.
*The music video for the song &quot;The Importance of Being Idle&quot; by Oasis contains scenes based on scenes from &quot;Billy Liar&quot;, although most of it is based on the video for the Kinks&#x27; &quot;Dead End Street&quot;.
* The song &quot;Twisterella&quot; is shares its title with of a song that Billy co-writes in the novel.
* The Kids in the Hall &quot;Billy Dreamer&quot; character is based loosely on Billy Liar.
* The song &quot;William, It Was Really Nothing&quot; by The Smiths took inspiration from the book.
*It has been suggested that a local newspaper columnist parodied in both the book and the film bears a remarkable resemblance to the late-life Keith Waterhouse himself, when he was ensconced at the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. However, given that Billy Liar was written in 1959 when Keith Waterhouse was 30 years old, and that he died in 2009, in the absence of any evidence of a time-machine among his effects, a conscious parody appears to be a particularly ludicrous post-hoc rationalisation.

<doc id="163350" wikidata="Q856010" url="?curid=163350" title="Wellington Region">
<text>Greater Wellington, also known as the Wellington region (Māori: &quot;Te Upoko o te Ika&quot;), is a region of New Zealand that occupies the southernmost part of the North Island. The region covers an area of , and has a population of 

The region takes its name from Wellington, New Zealand&#x27;s capital city and the region&#x27;s seat. The Wellington urban area, including the cities of Wellington, Porirua, Lower Hutt, and Upper Hutt, accounts for percent of the region&#x27;s population; other major urban areas include the Kapiti conurbation (Waikanae, Paraparaumu, Raumati Beach, Raumati South, and Paekākāriki) and the town of Masterton.

==Local government==

The region is administered by the Wellington Regional Council, which uses the promotional name Greater Wellington Regional Council.

The council region covers the conurbation around the capital city, Wellington, and the cities of Lower Hutt, Porirua, and Upper Hutt, each of which has a rural hinterland; it extends up the west coast of the North Island, taking in the coastal settlements of the Kāpiti Coast District; east of the Remutaka Range it includes three largely rural districts containing most of Wairarapa, covering the towns of Masterton, Carterton, Greytown, Featherston and Martinborough. The Wellington Regional Council was first formed in 1980 from a merger of the Wellington Regional Planning Authority and the Wellington Regional Water Board.

Following the creation of the Auckland Council &#x27;super-city&#x27; in 2009, a similar merger for councils within the Wellington region was investigated by the Local Government Commission in 2013. The proposal was scrapped in 2015 following negative public feedback.

== Term &quot;Wellington region&quot; ==

In common usage the terms &quot;Wellington region&quot; and &quot;Greater Wellington&quot; are not clearly defined, and areas on the periphery of the region are often excluded. In its more restrictive sense the region refers to the cluster of built-up areas west of the Tararua ranges. The much more sparsely populated area to the east has its own name, Wairarapa, and a centre in Masterton. To a lesser extent, the Kāpiti Coast is sometimes excluded from the region. Otaki in particular has strong connections to the Horowhenua district to the north. This includes having been part of the MidCentral District Health Board (DHB) area, instead of the Capital and Coast DHB area like the rest of the Kāpiti Coast.

== History ==
The Māori who originally settled the region knew it as &quot;Te Upoko o te Ika a Māui&quot;, meaning &quot;the head of Māui&#x27;s fish&quot;. Legend recounts that Kupe discovered and explored the region in about the tenth century.

The region was settled by Europeans in 1839 by the New Zealand Company. Wellington became the capital of Wellington Province upon the creation of the province in 1853, until the Abolition of the Provinces Act came into force on 1 Nov 1876. Wellington became capital of New Zealand in 1865, the third capital after Russell and Auckland.

== Geography ==


The region occupies the southern tip of the North Island, bounded to the west, south and east by the sea. To the west lies the Tasman Sea and to the east the Pacific Ocean, the two seas joined by the narrow and turbulent Cook Strait, which is wide at its narrowest point, between Cape Terawhiti and Perano Head in the Marlborough Sounds.

The region covers , and extends north to Ōtaki and almost to Eketāhuna in the east.

Physically and topologically the region has four areas running roughly parallel along a northeast–southwest axis:
*The Kāpiti Coast, a narrow strip of coastal plain running north from Paekākāriki towards Foxton. It contains numerous small towns, many of which gain at least a proportion of their wealth from tourism, largely due to their fine beaches. 
*Rough hill country inland from the Kāpiti Coast, formed along the same major geologic fault responsible for the Southern Alps in the South Island. Though nowhere near as mountainous as the alps, the Remutaka and Tararua ranges are still hard country and support only small populations, although it is in small coastal valleys and plains at the southern end of these ranges that the cities of Wellington and the Hutt Valley are located.
*The undulating hill country of the Wairarapa around the Ruamahanga River, which becomes lower and flatter in the south and terminates in the wetlands around Lake Wairarapa and contains much rich farmland. 
*Rough hill country, lower than the Tararua Range but far less economic than the land around the Ruamahanga River. This and the other hilly striation are still largely forested.

==Demographics==
Wellington region covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.

Wellington region had a population of 520,971 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 14,157 people (2.8%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 49,656 people (10.5%) since the 2013 census. There were 253,278 males, 263,691 females and 4,002 people of other genders in 196,230 dwellings. 5.7% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. The median age was 37.9 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally). There were 89,685 people (17.2%) aged under 15 years, 109,104 (20.9%) aged 15 to 29, 241,272 (46.3%) aged 30 to 64, and 80,916 (15.5%) aged 65 or older.

Of those at least 15 years old, 113,526 (26.3%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, 199,524 (46.3%) had a post-high school certificate or diploma, and 82,521 (19.1%) people exclusively held high school qualifications.

=== Urban areas ===
Over three-quarters of the reside in the four cities at the southwestern corner. Other main centres of population are on the Kāpiti Coast and in the fertile farming areas close to the upper Ruamahanga River in the Wairarapa.

Along the Kāpiti Coast, numerous small towns sit close together, many of them occupying spaces close to popular beaches. From the north, these include Ōtaki, Waikanae, Paraparaumu, the twin settlements of Raumati Beach and Raumati South, Paekākāriki and Pukerua Bay, the latter being a northern suburb of Porirua. Each of these settlements has a population of between 2,000 and 10,000, making this moderately heavily populated.

In the Wairarapa the largest community by a considerable margin is Masterton, with a population of over 20,000. Other towns include Featherston, Martinborough, Carterton and Greytown.

===Income and employment===
The median income as of the 2023 census was $48,700, compared with $41,500 nationally. 78,597 people (18.2%) earned over $100,000 compared to 12.1% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 236,730 (54.9%) people were employed full-time, 57,411 (13.3%) were part-time, and 12,573 (2.9%) were unemployed.

===Culture and identity===
People could identify as more than one ethnicity. The results in the 2023 census were 72.6% European (Pākehā); 15.5% Māori; 9.1% Pasifika; 15.2% Asian; 2.3% Middle Eastern, Latin American and African New Zealanders (MELAA); and 2.2% other, which includes people giving their ethnicity as &quot;New Zealander&quot;. English was spoken by 96.2%, Māori language by 3.9%, Samoan by 2.8% and other languages by 17.2%. No language could be spoken by 2.0% (e.g. too young to talk). New Zealand Sign Language was known by 0.6%. The percentage of people born overseas was 28.1, compared with 28.8% nationally.

Religious affiliations were 31.1% Christian, 3.0% Hindu, 1.3% Islam, 0.7% Māori religious beliefs, 1.2% Buddhist, 0.5% New Age, 0.2% Jewish, and 1.7% other religions. People who answered that they had no religion were 54.3%, and 6.1% of people did not answer the census question.
In the 2013 census, around 25.3 percent of the Wellington region&#x27;s population was born overseas, second only to Auckland (39.1 percent) and on par with the New Zealand average (25.2 percent). The British Isles is the largest region of origin, accounting for 36.5 percent of the overseas-born population in the region. Significantly, the Wellington region is home to over half of New Zealand&#x27;s Tokelauan-born population.

Catholicism was the largest Christian denomination in Wellington with 14.8 percent affiliating, while Anglicanism was the second-largest with 11.9 percent affiliating. Hinduism (2.4 percent) and Buddhism (1.6 percent) were the largest non-Christian religions in the 2013 census.

===Museums===
Key cultural institutions in the region include Te Papa in Wellington, the Dowse Art Museum in Lower Hutt, Pataka museum and gallery in Porirua.

==Economy==
The subnational gross domestic product (GDP) of the Wellington region was estimated at NZ$39.00 billion in the year to March 2019, 12.9% of New Zealand&#x27;s national GDP. The subnational GDP per capita was estimated at $74,251 in the same period, the highest of all New Zealand regions. In the year to March 2018, primary industries contributed $389 million (1.0%) to the regional GDP, goods-producing industries contributed $5.93 billion (15.9%), service industries contributed $27.84 billion (74.5%), and taxes and duties contributed $3.20 billion (8.6%).

==Transport==
Public transport in the region is well developed compared to other parts of New Zealand. It consists of buses, trains, cars, ferries and a funicular (the Wellington Cable Car). It also included trams until 1964 and trolleybuses until 2018. Buses and ferries are privately owned, with the infrastructure owned by public bodies, and public transport is often subsidised. The Regional Council is responsible for planning and subsidising public transport. The services are marketed under the name &quot;Metlink&quot;. Transdev Wellington operates the metropolitan train network, running from the Wellington CBD as far as Waikanae in the north and Masterton in the east. In the year to June 2015, 36.41 million trips were made by public transport with passengers travelling a combined 460.7 million kilometres, equal to 73 trips and 927 km per capita.

The Wellington region has the lowest rate of car ownership in New Zealand; 11.7 percent of households at the 2013 census did not have access to a car, compared to 7.9 percent for the whole of New Zealand. The number of households with more than one car is also the lowest: 44.4 percent compared to 54.5 percent nationally.

The main port in the region is located in Wellington Harbour. CentrePort Wellington manages cargo passing through the port including containers, logs, vehicles and other bulk cargo. Fuel imports are managed at wharves at Seaview and Miramar. The company also leases wharf facilities to the Interislander and Bluebridge ferry services which operate across Cook Strait between Wellington and Picton in the South Island, and it provides support for cruise ships that visit Wellington each year. CentrePort is majority-owned by Greater Wellington Regional Council, with a 77% shareholding.

==Biodiversity==

From 2005 to 2015 there has been increase in the variety and number of native forest bird species, as well as an increase in the range of areas inhabited by these species, in Greater Wellington.

The internationally recognised Ramsar estuarine wetlands site at Foxton Beach is of note as having one of the most diverse ranges of wetlands birds to be seen at any one place in New Zealand. A total of 95 species have been identified at the estuary. It is a significant area of salt marsh and mudflat and a valuable feeding ground for many birds including the migratory Eastern bar-tailed Godwit, which flies all the way from Siberia to New Zealand to escape the harsh northern winter. The estuary is also a permanent home to 13 species of birds, six species of fish and four plants species, all of which are threatened. It regularly supports about one percent of the world population of wrybills.

<text>The Republican River is a river in the central Great Plains of North America, rising in the High Plains of eastern Colorado and flowing east through the U.S. states of Nebraska and Kansas.

==Geography==
The Republican River is formed by the confluence of the North Fork Republican River and the Arikaree River just north of Haigler in Dundy County, Nebraska. It joins with the South Fork Republican River immediately southeast of Benkelman, Nebraska. All three tributaries originate in the High Plains of northeastern Colorado. From the confluence, the river flows generally eastward along the southern border of Nebraska, passing through Swanson Reservoir and Harlan County Reservoir before curving southward into the Smoky Hills region of Kansas. The Republican River joins the Smoky Hill River at Junction City, Kansas to form the Kansas River.

Some cities along the river are McCook, Nebraska, Clay Center, Kansas, Concordia, Kansas and Junction City, Kansas. Near Concordia is the Republican River Pegram Truss, a bridge that goes over the Republican River that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
The river was named after a branch of Pawnee Indians known as &quot;the Republicans&quot;.

As early as 1785, the Spanish and French had identified one of the villages of the Pawnee people as &quot;aldea de la Republica&quot; (&quot;little village of the Republic&quot;). A French traders&#x27; custom was to name rivers for the tribal villages located on their banks. In this way, the north fork of the Kansas River was named &quot;Fourche des Republiques&quot; or &quot;Fork of the Republics&quot;.

The Kitkehahkis Pawnee villages farmed corn, beans, and pumpkin in the fertile Republican valley floor but seasonally left to hunt buffalo in the plains to the west and south.

The Kitkehahkis, or Republican Pawnee, occasionally abandoned and relocated various villages along the Republican River. In 1806, first the Spanish and then the Americans journeyed to the large Kitkehahkis village on Republican River, the Pike-Pawnee Village Site then near the present Guide Rock, Nebraska. Both parties were seeking the tribe&#x27;s assistance in enforcing competing claims to the Louisiana Territory. Leading the much smaller American expedition, Lieutenant Zebulon Pike convinced the Kitkehahkis to accept the American Flag in place of the Spanish.

In 1853, Fort Riley was established at the junction of the Republican with the Smoky Hill and Kansas Rivers. American settlement of the lower Republican River in began in the 1860s.

Prior to 1864, the Kansas River was publicly navigable under Kansas law. A side-wheel steamboat of 125 tons burden, &quot;Financier No. 2&quot;, reached the Republican River in 1855 and ascended it some 40 miles. However, in 1864, railroad interests passed a bill through the Kansas Legislature entitled, &quot;An act declaring the Kansas, Republican, Smoky Hill, Solomon, and Big Blue rivers not navigable, and authorizing the bridging of the same.&quot; Railroads were thus permitted to bridge or dam the Republican as if it were never declared navigable.

The Kansas Pacific Railway reached the fork of the Republican in 1866, crossing into the Junction City town site. The Junction City and Fort Kearney Railroad was constructed up the valley of the Republican to Clay Center in 1873.

The 1864 law was repealed in 1913; however, under Kansas Law, public access, whether for transport or recreation, is permitted only on publicly owned rivers. The State of Kansas owns only the Kansas and Arkansas Rivers as well as the portion of the Missouri River adjoining the northeastern corner of the state. As such, the limit of public river access is at the mouth of the Republican River. A public boat access ramp was opened on the mouth of the Republican River in 2009 just upstream of the railroad bridge, providing access to the upper end of the Kansas River National Water Trail, a part of the National Water Trail program.

Milford Lake, the largest man-made lake in Kansas, was completed on the Republican in 1967.

==Republican River Compact==
Allocation of the water from the Republican River is governed through an agreement called the Republican River Compact, involving the states of Nebraska, Kansas and Colorado, as modified by the settlement of a United States Supreme Court case (Kansas vs. Nebraska and Colorado) involving a water-use dispute under the Compact.

==Major flooding==
===July 1902===
On July 9, 1902, the river flooded near Concordia, Kansas, breaking a dam and re-routing the river by a quarter-mile (about half a kilometer).

===May/June 1935===
The storm of May 31 and June 1, 1935, (called &quot;Nebraska&#x27;s Deadliest Flood&quot;) dumped an average rainfall of on the river&#x27;s watershed. This storm was also unique in that it moved in the same direction as the drainage basin. As a result, the Frenchman, Red Willow, Medicine, Deer, Muddy, and Turkey creeks all reached their flood peaks at the same time as the crest passed on the Republican River.

According to witness accounts, the roar of the water could be heard coming down the Republican Valley away. Many survivors also reported that there were two crests - the water came up on May 28, then receded slightly, but the second crest on June 1 greatly exceeded the first. At one point, the water rose in 30 minutes and was higher than the previous record crest. One eyewitness said the water level rose in some places at 10 miles per hour or more. Another account states that the Republican rose in 12 minutes in McCook, destroying the structures in its path. Water was deep in some places, and the discharge was , more than 320 times the normal flow today.

Estimates show 113 people killed. From 11,400 to 41,500 head of cattle were killed; one report said that carcasses littering the roads made them impassable. A total of of highway and 307 bridges were destroyed, and of farmland were inundated.

<text>Frontier Group Holdings, Inc., doing business as Frontier Airlines, is a major American ultra low-cost airline headquartered in Denver, Colorado. It operates flights to over 120 destinations in the United States, Caribbean, Mexico and Central America, and employs more than 5,000 staff. The carrier is a publicly traded company and maintains bases at Denver International Airport, Orlando International Airport and eleven other cities across the Mainland United States and Puerto Rico.

== History ==
=== 1990s ===

Frontier Airlines was created by Frederick W. &quot;Rick&quot; Brown (a United Airlines pilot), his wife Janice Brown, and Bob Schulman, the latter two having worked at the original Frontier Airlines (1950–1986). In 1993, Continental Airlines was scaling back flights from Denver&#x27;s Stapleton International Airport (which was closed and replaced with the Denver International Airport in 1995), and the three proposed a charter airline named AeroDenver Travel Services to fill demand on international routes, potentially in partnership with Condor Airlines. To run the company, they brought in M. C. &quot;Hank&quot; Lund (ex-CEO of the original Frontier Airlines) as CEO and Sam Addoms as executive vice-president and treasurer (later CEO). As Continental&#x27;s Denver drawback expanded in scope in late 1993, the proposed airline pivoted to fill regional routes, and adopted the Frontier Airlines name. The company was incorporated in February and went public in May 1994. Scheduled flights began on July 5, 1994, using Boeing 737-200 jetliners between Denver and four cities in North Dakota. Around three-quarters of its 180 employees, and many executives, had worked for the original Frontier Airlines. By January 1995, Frontier had expanded its route network from Denver and was serving destinations in New Mexico, Montana, North Dakota, Texas, Nevada, Nebraska, and Arizona. Like the original airline of the same name, the new Frontier operated a hub at Denver (DEN) and for the first nine years used the slogan &quot;The Spirit of the West&quot; which was displayed above the windows and just behind the cursive letters &quot;Frontier&quot; on the fuselage of their aircraft.

In 1999, Frontier signed agreements to begin purchasing and leasing Airbus A318 and A319 jet aircraft and had also added Boeing 737-300 jetliners to its fleet as well. Also by September 1999, the airline was serving destinations from coast to coast in the U.S., having expanded its route network to include Atlanta (ATL); Baltimore (BWI); Bloomington/Normal, Illinois (BMI); Boston (BOS); Chicago (MDW, Midway Airport); Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW); Phoenix (PHX); Los Angeles (LAX); Minneapolis/St. Paul (MSP); New York City (LGA, LaGuardia Airport); Orlando (MCO); Portland, Oregon (PDX); Salt Lake City (SLC); San Diego (SAN); San Francisco (SFO); and Seattle (SEA), all served from its Denver hub.

=== 2000s ===

Frontier took delivery of its first Airbus aircraft (an A319) in 2001 and simultaneously launched with it DirecTV in-flight television along with a new company livery. Frontier Airlines was the launch customer of the Airbus A318 in 2003. In mid April 2005, Frontier officially became an all-Airbus fleet, retiring its last Boeing 737. Jeff Potter was appointed CEO in 2002.

As part of its plan to stay competitive in reaction to the entry of Southwest Airlines into Denver, the company underwent a reorganization early in 2006. On April 3, 2006, Frontier created Frontier Airlines Holdings (FRNT), a holding company incorporated in Delaware to take advantage of favorable tax laws in that state. The corporate headquarters did not leave Colorado. In 2007, Frontier established a commuter airline subsidiary, Lynx Aviation, Inc., chaired by Dr. Paul Stephen Dempsey. Also that year, Jeff Potter left the company and was replaced by Air Canada&#x27;s Sean Menke as CEO.

On January 24, 2007, Frontier was designated as a major carrier by the United States Department of Transportation.

On January 11, 2007, Frontier Airlines signed an 11-year service agreement with Republic Airways. Under the agreement, Republic was to operate 17 76-seat Embraer 170 aircraft for the former Frontier JetExpress operations. At the time the contract was canceled in April 2008, Republic Airways operated 11 aircraft for Frontier Airlines, with the remaining six aircraft expected to join the fleet by December 2008. With the integration of Republic aircraft, the &#x27;JetExpress&#x27; denotation was removed. Subsequent to the cessation of Horizon&#x27;s services for Frontier in December 2007, all flights operated by Republic were sold and marketed as &quot;Frontier Airlines, operated by Republic Airways.&quot; The first market created specifically for the Embraer 170 was Louisville, Kentucky, which began on April 1, 2007. Service to Louisville was suspended in August 2008 but restarted in April 2010.

Flights operated by Republic Airlines offered in-flight snack and beverage services similar to Frontier&#x27;s mainline flights. Unlike Frontier&#x27;s aircraft and due to the nature of contracting with regional carriers, these Embraer 170 aircraft were not fitted with LiveTV.

On April 10, 2008, Frontier filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in reaction to the intent of its credit card processor, First Data, to withhold significant proceeds from ticket sales. First Data decided that it would withhold 100% of the carrier&#x27;s proceeds from ticket sales beginning May 1. According to Frontier&#x27;s press release, &quot;This change in practice would have represented a material change to our cash forecasts and business plan. Unchecked, it would have put severe restraints on Frontier&#x27;s liquidity...&quot; Its operation continued uninterrupted, though, as Chapter 11 bankruptcy protected the corporation&#x27;s assets and allowed restructuring to ensure long-term viability. After months of losses, Frontier Airlines reported that they made their first profit during the month of November 2008, reporting in net income for the month.

On June 22, 2009, Frontier Airlines announced that, pending bankruptcy court approval, Republic Airways Holdings, the Indianapolis-based parent company of Republic Airways, would acquire all assets of Frontier for the amount of $108 million. Thus, Frontier Airlines would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Republic. However, five weeks later on July 30, Dallas-based Southwest Airlines announced that it would be making a competing bid of $113.6 million for Frontier with intentions to also operate Frontier as a wholly owned subsidiary, but that it would gradually fold Frontier resources into current Southwest operating assets.

During a bankruptcy auction on August 13, 2009, Republic Airways Holdings acquired Frontier Airlines and its regional airline, Lynx Aviation, as wholly owned subsidiaries. On October 1, Republic completed the transaction, and Frontier officially exited bankruptcy as a new airline.

In late 2009, Republic began to consolidate administrative positions and moved 140 jobs from the Frontier Airlines Denver headquarters to Indianapolis. Shortly after in January 2010, Republic Airways announced that it would move all of its executives to Indianapolis. Later in February, the &quot;Denver Business Journal&quot; stated that the headquarters would be moved &quot;soon&quot;. Despite this, according to the &quot;Denver Business Journal&quot;, Frontier Airlines will still maintain a local headquarters in Denver to house Training, Marketing, Customer Reservations, and Scheduling &amp; Planning teams after extending its lease on the building through 2020.

In 2010, Frontier&#x27;s then-CEO Bryan Bedford took part in the reality TV show &quot;Undercover Boss&quot;.

As Republic Airways Holdings was in the process of bidding to acquire Frontier in 2009, it was also in the process of acquiring Milwaukee-based Midwest Airlines. Through the fall and winter of 2009, Republic operated its two new acquisitions as separate brands. However, to improve efficiency by better matching aircraft capacity to route demand, Republic began to intermix the fleets of the two airlines, swapping a portion of its higher-capacity planes from Frontier with its smaller-capacity planes from Midwest and vice versa. However, the move caused some confusion amongst the public, as the two brands did not offer the same amenities and did not match the amenities mentioned on the airfare. As a result, in the spring of 2010, Frontier and Midwest Airlines announced that their brands would merge, with Frontier being the surviving brand. This was a merger of brands only—no Midwest Airlines aircraft was ever operated by Frontier, as by this time, all Midwest Airlines flights were operated on its behalf by other Republic Airways Holdings subsidiaries.

On April 13, 2011, Frontier formed a new subsidiary, Frontier Express, that was planned to operate the airline&#x27;s smaller aircraft with different services than those available on full-size aircraft.

=== 2010s ===

Upon the full merger and integration of Frontier and Midwest Airlines in October 2010, Frontier and its regional partners operated over 100 daily flights from the Milwaukee hub. However, on September 9, 2011, Frontier notified the public of a 40% reduction of arriving and departing flights from MKE. Along with this reduction of flights, the company laid off approximately 140 employees from the MKE station. This included but was not limited to: maintenance, grooming services, flight-line and gate.

In February 2012, Frontier Airlines further reduced service to Milwaukee by cutting five more nonstop routes. This move &quot;reduced Frontier&#x27;s daily departing flights out of Mitchell International from 32 to 18,&quot; or 56%. Frontier announced further layoffs in conjunction with this route change: up to 446 Milwaukee-area employees were affected by the job cuts that occurred between April 15 and 30, 2012.

In an effort to focus on regional contract flights for major carriers, Republic Airways Holdings announced in January 2012 its intention to sell or spin off Frontier. On January 26, 2012, Republic Airways Holdings appointed former US Airways and Gate Gourmet CEO David Siegel as president and CEO of Frontier Airlines. Republic also added new senior officers for Frontier&#x27;s finance and commercial team, among other changes in the executive leadership team. Siegel and other Frontier executives moved to Denver where Frontier is headquartered in order to facilitate management of all aspects of Frontier during its separation process from Republic and continue its transformation into an ultra low-cost carrier (ULCC).

In November 2012, Frontier started low-frequency service between Orlando International Airport and Trenton–Mercer Airport (TTN), located in Ewing, New Jersey, which at that time, had no commercial service. Frontier later expanded service several times from Trenton, and as of January 2023 services 9 destinations. Frontier currently bases three aircraft in Trenton. Trenton Mercer Airport lies roughly equidistant between Philadelphia International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport.

In July 2013, Frontier started service from Wilmington-New Castle Airport (ILG) near Wilmington, Delaware, to five destinations, which Frontier markets as Wilmington/Philadelphia. Again, this airport had no commercial service prior to Frontier&#x27;s entry. New Castle Airport lies roughly 30 miles southwest of Philadelphia International Airport and 75 miles northeast of Baltimore–Washington International Airport. As of 2022, Frontier does not serve ILG.

Frontier marketed both the Trenton-Mercer and Wilmington-Philadelphia airports as low-cost, low-hassle alternatives to the existing nearby commercial airports.
Frontier is the only commercial carrier at Trenton, and was the only carrier at ILG until it left in 2022.

In October 2013, Republic Airways Holdings entered into an agreement with private equity firm Indigo Partners to sell Frontier Airlines for approximately $145 million. According to Indigo, the transaction would further Frontier&#x27;s evolution into an ULCC. In December 2013, Indigo Partners LLC, through an affiliate, completed the purchase of Frontier Airlines from Republic Airways Holdings. The airline&#x27;s headquarters remained in Denver. On January 1, 2014, Republic Airways Holdings subsidiary Republic Airlines ceased its operation of Embraer 190 aircraft on behalf of Frontier.In 2014, Frontier announced it would be transitioning into an ULCC. Frontier also announced that it would cut several flights and jobs at its Denver hub and transition them to different markets. On January 16, 2015, Frontier announced that it would close both its Denver and Milwaukee call centers, laying off 1,300 employees and outsourcing the jobs to call center company Sitel, which operates a large call center for Frontier in Las Cruces, New Mexico. Frontier Airlines joined Spirit and Allegiant in June 2015 by eradicating its toll-free telephone number for customer service.

In June 2014, Frontier Airlines opened a crew base for flight attendants at Trenton–Mercer Airport.

In January 2015, Frontier Airlines cut several flights from Wilmington and Trenton. It also resumed service to Philadelphia, casting doubt on the airline&#x27;s existing bases. In late June 2015, Frontier announced it had ceased service in Wilmington, stating it was not profitable.

In February 2015, Frontier announced that they would begin service to several destinations from Atlanta, adding the airport as a focus city. In July, Frontier began to decrease service from Washington Dulles International Airport, removing the airport as a focus city. In early 2016, Frontier announced major route expansion from airports nationwide, including Atlanta, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Orlando, and Philadelphia. In June 2016, Frontier re-established service to John Glenn Columbus International Airport. In May 2017, the airline announced it would open a new crew base in Las Vegas in fall 2017, to improve operational reliability and potentially create new jobs in Las Vegas. In December 2017, Frontier began service to Buffalo, New York, with service to Denver, Colorado, and Florida, including Miami, Fort Myers, Orlando, and Tampa.

In May 2015, Indigo and Frontier announced the departure of David Siegel as CEO. He had already previously turned over the role of president to Barry Biffle, formerly of Spirit Airlines. Siegel was not immediately replaced; instead, his duties were split between Biffle and Indigo chairman Bill Franke. Biffle cited operational issues in connection with Siegel&#x27;s departure.

In 2015, in an airline quality rating report by Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and Wichita State University, Frontier was ranked amongst the five worst airlines in the United States, especially due to its rate of customer complaints and bumped passengers. The airline had relatively poor on-time performance, and the waiting time for help when calling the airline on the phone was reported to have risen to two hours or more.

In December 2016, a winter weather event disrupted fleet operations and caused Frontier to delay or cancel up to 70% of their flights suddenly during the peak of the crisis. On the weekend of December 17, the storm caused major delays at Frontier&#x27;s Denver hub. The effects of the storm were felt throughout the fleet. Flights were delayed or canceled at airports across the country; in some cases, planes were ready to depart, but the airline had no rested and available flight crews to service the flights. The head of Frontier&#x27;s pilot&#x27;s union issued a statement criticizing the companies&#x27; handling of the event, comparing the airline to a &quot;house of cards.&quot;

=== 2020s ===

In 2020, class-action lawsuits against Frontier were filed after the company refused to refund airfare for customers who could not travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company accepted part of the $25 billion in U.S. government funds to offset financial damage to the airline industry during the outbreak.

On April 1, 2021, Frontier went public with an initial public offering on the Nasdaq exchange. The company adopted the ticker symbol ULCC, a nod to the company&#x27;s ultra low-cost carrier business model.

In early 2022, Frontier attempted to acquire Spirit Airlines, another US-based ULCC in a cash-and-stock deal. The deal would have created the fifth-largest airline in the country. After announcing the proposal, JetBlue made a competing offer to acquire Spirit for in cash. On July 27, 2022, Spirit announced that its shareholders had rejected Frontier&#x27;s offer.

In November 2022, Frontier announced that it would establish a crew operating base at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) in early 2023, and would add a gate in DFW Terminal E for flights to additional destinations starting in April of that year. That month, it also eliminated its customer service phone line completely, referring customers to online channels.

==Corporate affairs==
=== Business trends ===
The key available trends for Frontier Group Holdings, Inc. over recent years are shown below (as at year ending December 31), although full annual accounts have not been published since Frontier has been owned by private equity firm Indigo Partners.

=== Management changes ===
Dave Siegel took the chief executive officer role in January 2012. Siegel&#x27;s tenure ran through May 2015, when he left for personal reasons and was succeeded by the company&#x27;s chairman, Bill Franke, who would manage strategy and finances. In April 2014, Barry L. Biffle was appointed as the company&#x27;s president, reporting to Siegel; after Siegel&#x27;s departure, Biffle was charged with managing the company&#x27;s day-to-day operations.

=== Former regional carriers ===
==== Frontier JetExpress ====
In February 2002, the airline launched its first regional product, Frontier JetExpress, initially operated by Mesa Airlines using CRJ-200 regional jets. Similar to the &quot;express&quot; operations of other carriers, Frontier JetExpress was targeted for markets to and from Denver that do not generate traffic sufficient to support Frontier&#x27;s smallest mainline jet, the Airbus A318, but could still offer lucrative business with a smaller jet.

The initial JetExpress partnership with Mesa ended in January 2004, when Horizon Air was selected to operate the routes. Horizon utilized slightly larger CRJ-700 regional jet aircraft on these routes. In August 2006, Frontier and Horizon planned to end their partnership. While Frontier was generally pleased with Horizon&#x27;s operation, the carrier decided that it needed to revisit the agreement and find a provider with additional regional jets to grow the operation. The last of the CRJ-700s was returned to the Horizon Air fleet on November 30, 2007. As the service by Horizon Air was winding down in November 2007, Frontier had some flights operated by ExpressJet using Embraer 145 regional jets.

==== Lynx Aviation ====
On September 6, 2006, Frontier created a new division of the holding company, known as Lynx Aviation, to operate Bombardier Q400 aircraft beginning in May 2007. On December 5, 2007, Lynx Aviation received its operating certificate from the FAA. Lynx began passenger operations on the morning of December 6, 2007.

After commencing operations, Lynx provided service to 19 regional destinations: Albuquerque, Aspen, Billings, Boise, Bozeman, Colorado Springs, Durango, El Paso, Fargo, Grand Junction, Hayden/Steamboat Springs (seasonal), Jackson Hole (Seasonal), Kansas City, Oklahoma City, Omaha, Rapid City, Salt Lake City, Tulsa, and Wichita. Most cities were also served by mainline Frontier jets however Lynx provided the only Frontier service to Aspen, Billings, Bozeman, Colorado Springs, Grand Junction, and Hayden.

In 2012, the Lynx Aviation operation was folded into Republic Airways Holdings&#x27; subsidiary, Republic Airways. The remaining Q400 aircraft were withdrawn from Frontier service and placed in service for United Airlines, flying as United Express.

==== Republic Airways ====
Republic Airways operated Embraer 170 regional jets on behalf of Frontier in 2007 through mid 2008. Republic was also providing feeder service for Midwest Airlines and as Frontier and Midwest began merging in 2009, retaining the Frontier brand, Republic resumed service for Frontier with the Embraer 170s and also introduced larger Embraer 190 jets.

==== Chautauqua Airlines ====
Chautauqua Airlines had been operating feeder flights on behalf of Midwest Airlines and began service for Frontier with the merger of Frontier and Midwest in October 2010. Chautauqua operated up to 12 Embraer 135 and Embraer 145 jets out of Milwaukee. Frontier began branding these flights as Frontier Express in the spring of 2011. New service began in 2011 on three subsidized Essential Air Service routes to the cities of Rhinelander, Wisconsin, as well as Ironwood and Manistee, Michigan. However, Frontier almost immediately began a pull-down of the Milwaukee hub and by the end of 2012, the only route that continued to operate with a Frontier Express ERJ-145 jet was Milwaukee to Rhinelander. Service to Rhinelander ended on January 3, 2013, and Chautauqua transferred the remaining aircraft to other partners.

==== Maverick Airways ====
In early 1997, Maverick Airways was operating codeshare service for Frontier with de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7 STOL capable turboprops between Denver (DEN) and two destinations in Colorado: Grand Junction (GJT) and Steamboat Springs (SBS).

==== Aspen Mountain Air ====
From mid 1997 through mid 1998, Aspen Mountain Air operated codeshare service for Frontier from Denver to Aspen, CO, Bozeman, MT, and Sioux City IA. The carrier flew Dornier 328 prop aircraft.

==== Great Lakes Airlines ====
Great Lakes Airlines also operated a codeshare service with Frontier from the early 2000s, until the airline shut down in 2018. Great Lakes provided connecting service to many smaller cities from the Denver hub as well as several other focus cities, using Beechcraft 1900D and Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia aircraft.

=== Airline branding ===
From 1994 to 2001, the airline&#x27;s livery consisted of green script &quot;Frontier&quot; titles on the forward fuselage, a small &quot;Spirit of the West&quot; slogan, and wildlife photography on the tail of each aircraft. Most Boeing 737 aircraft featured different imagery on both sides.

Beginning in 2001, a new livery was introduced on the airline&#x27;s new Airbus A319s, with large silver &quot;FRONTIER&quot; titles on the sides of the aircraft, and the airline&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of the West&quot; slogan, later changed to &quot;A whole different animal.&quot; The animal tails were retained, although only one image per aircraft was now used. Though the airline&#x27;s Boeing 737s remained in the fleet until 2005, none were repainted into this livery.

In April 2013, Frontier introduced a modified version of that livery, keeping the iconic animals on aircraft tails, but dropping its former slogan and replacing &quot;FRONTIER&quot; with &quot;FLYFRONTIER.COM&quot;, the company&#x27;s website, in support of new marketing that focused heavily on the airline&#x27;s web presence. This livery was only painted on a few newly delivered aircraft. Aircraft in the older livery received &quot;FLYFRONTIER.COM&quot; titles on engine nacelles.

On September 9, 2014, Frontier introduced an updated livery, as part of a rebranding that saw the spokesanimals&#x27; roles increase. The new livery reintroduced a green &quot;FRONTIER&quot; typeface to the fuselage, featuring the stylized &quot;F&quot; designed by Saul Bass for the original Frontier when the carrier unveiled a new livery in 1978. The livery of 2014 also includes the traditional arrow used by the original Frontier prior to 1978. Each aircraft features the name of the animal featured on its tail near the nose of the aircraft for easier identification.

Animal concepts used in the livery extend into Frontier&#x27;s marketing as well. Each animal has a specific name. Animal aircraft used in their radio and television commercials include Jack the rabbit, Grizwald the bear, Foxy the fox (for whom Jack has a crush), Flip the dolphin (who always gets stuck going to Chicago rather than the warmer climates the others are going to), Larry the lynx, Hector the sea otter, and Sal the cougar. New additions are Penguins Jim, Joe, Jay, and Gary, a barbershop-style quartet, singing the praises of EarlyReturns to an audience of Frontier&#x27;s well-known characters from the &quot;a whole different animal&quot; campaign, Hector the otter, advertising Frontier&#x27;s expanding service to Mexico, and Polly the Parrot, who won the new animal audition in 2012.

Expanding on these concepts in 2023, Frontier introduced a new approach with their animal mascots taking on promiscuous roles in a calendar titled &quot;Fur &amp; Feathers&quot;.

== Destinations ==

Frontier Airlines operates a network consisting of both domestic and international destinations in the United States, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.

=== Codeshare agreements ===
Frontier has a codeshare agreement with Volaris.

== Fleet ==
=== Current fleet ===
, Frontier Airlines operates an all-Airbus A320 family fleet composed of the following aircraft:

=== Fleet development ===
During the 2011 Paris Air Show, Republic Airways Holdings ordered 60 A320neo aircraft and 20 A319neo aircraft for Frontier. In 2014, the airline ordered 19 Airbus A321neos. In October 2016, Frontier Airlines took delivery of its first Airbus A320neo aircraft and became the second US operator of the type after Spirit Airlines.

On November 15, 2017, Frontier Airlines announced a $15 billion order for 134 additional A320neo family aircraft. The order, slightly revised under new owner Indigo, consisted of 100 A320neos and 34 A321neos. The order also included the conversion of the remaining A319neo to A320neo. With this order, Frontier Airlines fleet sought industry-leading fuel efficiency as well as one of the youngest and most modern fleets, particularly in comparison to other low-cost carriers, with an average fleet age of five years .

=== Historical fleet ===
In the past, Frontier Airlines has operated the following aircraft types:
Frontier was the launch customer of the Airbus A318; between 2003 and 2007, the airline took delivery of eleven of the type. Retirement of the type began in 2010 and was completed by autumn 2013. All of Frontier&#x27;s A318s were parted out for scrap. At the time, the five youngest examples had spent less than two and a half years in active service, while the oldest two were just over ten years old.

==Service concept==
=== Services ===
As an ultra low-cost carrier (ULCC), Frontier imposes fees for additional amenities and services, such as for advance seat reservation and baggage allowance, the waiving of fees associated with changing or cancelling itineraries, and operates a buy on board service for in-flight catering. Prior to its transition to an ULCC, the airline offered DirecTV channels on seat-mounted electronic screens for an additional fee. Following the removal of the electronic screens from its seats, the airline has not offered any in-flight entertainment options.

=== Seating ===
Frontier&#x27;s aircraft are configured in all-economy class seating in a 3–3 layout. Seats on its A320 aircraft have to of seat pitch, and seats on its A321 aircraft have to of seat pitch. At wide, the middle seats on Frontier&#x27;s aircraft are wider than the window and aisle seats. Seats do not have adjustable recline, with the exception of some premium &quot;Stretch&quot; seats in an exit row or near the bulkheads, which have an additional to of seat pitch.

== Frequent-flyer program ==
&quot;Frontier Miles&quot; is the airline&#x27;s frequent-flyer program, which replaced the &quot;EarlyReturns&quot; program that operated from 2003 to 2018. Originally a distance-based accrual program, it transitioned to a revenue-based accrual program in 2024, where Frontier Miles are accrued based on the amount spent on travel with the airline, or alternatively through co-branded products and services. Miles can be redeemed for travel with the airline; previously, the airline allowed miles to also be redeemed for other products and services.

The program has four tiers of elevated frequent flyer status, consisting of Elite Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond. Prior to the revamp of the program in 2024, it had three tiers consisting of Elite 20k, 50k, and 100k. Elite benefits progressively include more and more complimentary services and amenities, such as advance seat assignments, baggage allowance, or priority boarding.

== Accidents and incidents ==
* On November 30, 2018, a Frontier Airlines Airbus A320-200, (registered N227FR) operating as Frontier Airlines Flight 260, had its engine fan cowlings ripped off during take-off. The crew stated that a foreign object on the runway may have caused it. Although this did not interfere with the aircraft&#x27;s engine functionality, the crew decided to perform a precautionary emergency landing. No one aboard was injured.
* On Saturday, October 5, 2024, a Frontier Airlines Airbus A321 operating as Flight 1326 from San Diego, caught fire while landing at Las Vegas, Nevada. The pilots declared an emergency and the flight landed without injuries to its 197 occupants.

<text>The Smoky Hill River is a river in the central Great Plains of North America, running through Colorado and Kansas.

==Names==
The Smoky Hill is named from the Smoky Hills region of north-central Kansas through which it flows. American Indians living along the Smoky Hill considered it and the Kansas River to be the same river, and their names for it included Chetolah and Okesee-sebo. Early maps of European explorers called the river (also in combination with the Kansas River) the River of the Padoucas as its source is located in what was then Padouca (Comanche) territory.

The USGS lists several other names, including Chitolah River, Fork of the Hill Buckaneuse, La Fourche de la Cote Boucaniere, La Touche de la Cote Bucanieus, Manoiyohe, Pe P&#x27;a, Sand River, Shallow River, Smoky Creek, Branche de la Montagne a la Fumee, Ka-i-urs-kuta, Oke-see-sebo River, and Rahota katit hibaru.

==Geography==
The Smoky Hill River originates in the High Plains of eastern Colorado and flows east. Both the main course of it and of the North Fork Smoky Hill River rise in northern Cheyenne County, Colorado. The two streams converge roughly west of Russell Springs in Logan County, Kansas. From there, the river continues generally eastward through the Smoky Hills region. The Saline River joins it in eastern Saline County. The Solomon River joins the Smoky Hill River in western Dickinson County. The Smoky Hill River joins the Republican River at Junction City, Kansas to form the Kansas River.

The Smoky Hill River directly drains an area of . The combined Smoky Hill-Saline Basin drains . The entire Smoky Hill drainage basin covers approximately , including most of north-central and northwestern Kansas. Via the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, the Smoky Hill River is part of the Mississippi River watershed.

The Smoky Hill River feeds two reservoirs: Cedar Bluff Reservoir in Trego County and Kanopolis Lake in Ellsworth County.

The largest city along the Smoky Hill River is Salina, and other Kansas municipalities include Junction City, Ellsworth, Marquette, Lindsborg, and Abilene.

==History==

The earliest known reference to the river is on a 1732 map by French cartographer Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d&#x27;Anville who labeled it the &quot;River of the Padoucas&quot;. A 1758 map referred to it as the &quot;Padoucas River&quot;. An early reference to the river as the Smoky Hill was by American explorer Zebulon Pike during his 1806 expedition to visit the Pawnee. The Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 established Kansas Territory, including the entire length of the Smoky Hill River.

With the onset of the Pike&#x27;s Peak Gold Rush in 1858, an ancient American Indian trail along the river known as the Smoky Hill Trail provided the shortest, fastest route west across Kansas. Beginning in 1865, the trail was the route for the short-lived Butterfield Overland Despatch. To protect travelers, the U.S. Army established several forts along the trail, including Fort Downer, Fort Harker, Fort Hays, Fort Monument, and Fort Wallace. Before American colonization, the land along the Smoky Hill River was favored hunting ground for the Plains Indians. In 1867, the Comanche and the Kiowa, and in 1868, the Sioux and the Arapaho signed treaties withdrawing their opposition to the construction of a railroad along the Smoky Hill River. The Kansas Pacific Railway was completed in 1870, rendering the Smoky Hill Trail obsolete.

In 1948, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers finished construction of a dam on the Smoky Hill for flood control in southeastern Ellsworth County creating Kanopolis Lake. In 1951, the United States Bureau of Reclamation completed another dam on the river, for irrigation and flood control, in southeastern Trego County, Kansas, which created Cedar Bluff Reservoir.

<text>Charles Pinckney Jr. (October 26, 1757October 29, 1824) was an American Founding Father, planter, and politician who was a signer of the United States Constitution. He was elected and served as the 37th governor of South Carolina, later serving two more non-consecutive terms. He also served as a U.S. Senator and a member of the House of Representatives. He was a first cousin once removed of fellow signer Charles Cotesworth Pinckney.

Pinckney&#x27;s descendants included seven future South Carolina governors, including men related to the Maybank and Rhett families.

==Early life and education==

Pinckney was born and educated in Charles Town in the Province of South Carolina. His father, Colonel Charles Pinckney, was a wealthy lawyer and planter. His mother was Frances Brewton (b. 1733), daughter of a goldsmith and sister of Miles Brewton and Rebecca Brewton Motte, who were both also prominent in Charleston history.

His father had signed a loyalty oath to the British after they occupied Charleston in 1780 during the American Revolutionary War. This oath enabled him to keep his property. On his death in 1782, the senior Pinckney bequeathed Snee Farm, a plantation outside the city, and the enslavement of numerous people, to his eldest son Charles.

==Marriage and family==
Busy with the war and his political career, Pinckney did not marry until 1788. He married Mary Eleanor Laurens on April 27, 1788, at Saint Philip&#x27;s Church in Charleston. Mary was the daughter of Henry Laurens, a wealthy and politically powerful South Carolina slave trader. They had at least three children.

Among his in-laws were father-in-law Henry Laurens, Colonel John Laurens, and U.S. Representative David Ramsay. A brother-in-law married the daughter of South Carolina Governor John Rutledge.

==Career==
Pinckney was elected as a delegate to the Third Continental Congress (1777–78). Pinckney started to practice law in Charleston in 1779 at age 21. About that time, well after the War for Independence had begun, Pinckney enlisted in the militia. Pinckney became a lieutenant and served at the siege of Savannah. When Charleston fell to the British the following year, Pinckney was captured; he was held as a prisoner until June 1781 and sent north for a potential exchange. Pinckney did not return to Charleston until 1783. The British also captured Pinckney&#x27;s father. Pinckney and more than 160 men signed oaths of allegiance to the British to avoid having property confiscated. After the war, Pinckney was fined 12% on his property for having sworn the oath of allegiance.

Pinckney was elected again to the Continental Congress following the war, serving from 1784 to 1787. He was also elected to the state legislature for several terms (1779–1780, 1786–1789, and 1792–1796). As a nationalist, he worked in Congress to ensure that the United States would receive navigation rights from Spain to the Mississippi River and to strengthen congressional power.

Pinckney eventually owned several plantations and a townhouse in Charleston in addition to Snee Farm: Frankville and Hopton, situated on both sides of the Congaree River, near Columbia; a plantation in Georgetown consisting of 560 acres of tidal swamp and 600 acres of high land; a tract of 1,200 acres called Lynches Creek; Fee Farm on the Ashepoo River; Shell Hall, a house with four acres of land at Haddrell&#x27;s Point in Christ Church Parish; a house and garden lot on Meeting Street, Charleston; Wright&#x27;s Savannah plantation on the Carolina side of the Savannah River; and a tract of land on the Santee River above the canal, including a ferry, called Mount Tacitus. After Pinckney married Eleanor Laurens in 1788, the elegant three-story brick home at 16 Meeting Street in Charleston presumably became his principal residence. In the 1790 federal census, he is recorded as enslaving &quot;14 slaves in St. Philip&#x27;s and St. Michael&#x27;s Parish, 52 slaves in St. Bartholomew, and 45 slaves in the Orangeburg District,&quot; all in addition to Snee Farm, where his father&#x27;s probate record had listed 40 enslaved people in 1787.

===Constitutional Convention===
Pinckney&#x27;s role in the Constitutional Convention is controversial. Although one of the youngest delegates, he later claimed to have been the most influential one and contended he had submitted a draft, known as the Pinckney Plan, that was the basis of the final Constitution. This narrative was strongly disputed by James Madison and some of the other framers. Pinckney submitted an elaborate form of the Virginia Plan, proposed first by Edmund Randolph; other delegates disregarded it. Historians assess him as an important contributing delegate. Pinckney boasted that he was 24, allowing him to claim distinction as the youngest delegate, but he was 29 years old at the time of the convention. He attended full-time, spoke often and effectively, contributed to the final draft, and resolved problems that arose during the debates. He also worked to ratify the Constitution in South Carolina (1788).

At the Convention, Pierce Butler and Pinckney, both from South Carolina, introduced the Fugitive Slave Clause (Article IV, Section II, Clause III). James Wilson of Pennsylvania objected, saying that it was special protection for enslavers, requiring all state governments to enforce it at taxpayers&#x27; expense, in places where no one or most residents did not enslave people. Butler withdrew the clause, but the next day, a Southerner reinstated it, and the convention adopted it without further objection. This clause was added to the clause that provided extradition for fugitives from justice.

This clause was first applied to fugitive slaves and required that they be extradited upon enslavers&#x27; claims. Despite the clause, free states sometimes declined to enforce it. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 increased requirements on the states and penalties for failure to assist in re-enslavement. This practice was not eliminated until the Thirteenth Amendment abolished the institution of slavery. In 1864, during the Civil War, an effort to repeal this clause of the Constitution had failed.

Pinckney introduced a clause in the Constitution opposing an established state religion. His No Religious Test Clause read as follows:
Once the phrase was included in a vote, it passed with little opposition. For the first time, an official of a national government was not required to have a religion. Pinckney is also responsible for the inclusion of the writ of habeas corpus into the Constitution. Initially introduced as &quot;Nor shall the privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus ever be suspended, except in case of rebellion or invasion&quot;, it is now a part of Article 1 of the United States Constitution.

===Later career===
Pinckney&#x27;s political career blossomed. From 1789 to 1792, the state legislature elected him as governor of South Carolina, in 1790 he chaired the state constitutional convention, and in 1792 he received 8 votes from the legislature for the U.S. Senate. During this period, he became associated with the Federalist Party, where he and his cousin Charles Cotesworth Pinckney were leaders. But, with the passage of time, the former&#x27;s views began to change. In 1795 he attacked the Federalist-backed Jay Treaty. He increasingly began casting his lot with Carolina back-country Democratic-Republicans against his eastern elite. The population in the western part of the state was increasing, but legislative apportionment favored the Low Country planters. In 1796 Pinckney was elected governor again by the state legislature. In 1798 his Democratic-Republican supporters in the legislature elected him to the U.S. Senate.

Pinckney strongly opposed the actions of his former party. In the presidential election of 1800, Pinckney served as Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s campaign manager in South Carolina. The victorious Jefferson appointed Pinckney as minister to Spain (1801–05). Pinckney tried but failed to gain Spanish Florida cession to the United States. Pinckney facilitated Spanish acquiescence in the transfer of Louisiana from France to the United States in 1803 by the Louisiana Purchase. (Spain had already returned rule of this territory to France under Napoleon.)

Pinckney returned from Spain to Charleston and the leadership of the state Democratic-Republican Party. Pinckney served in the legislature in 1805–06 and was elected again as governor (1806–08). In this position, he favored legislative reapportionment to give more fair representation to back-country districts. Pinckney also advocated universal white manhood suffrage. He served again in the legislature from 1810 to 1814 and then temporarily withdrew from politics. In 1818, he won the U.S. House of Representatives election, where he fought against the Missouri Compromise. A major enslaver whose wealth depended on enslaved labor at his plantations, Pinckney supported an expansion of the institution of slavery to new territories and states.

In 1821, with his health beginning to fail, Pinckney retired for the last time from politics. Pinckney died in 1824. A memorial was erected in St. Michael&#x27;s Church in Charleston, South Carolina. The memorial was sculpted by Solomon Gibson (younger brother of John Gibson) in Liverpool in Great Britain.

==Legacy and honors==
Pinckney&#x27;s Snee Farm plantation is maintained as Charles Pinckney National Historic Site. The nearby Charles Pinckney Elementary School in Mount Pleasant is named for him. His son, Henry L. Pinckney, was a U.S. Representative from South Carolina and mayor of Charleston. His daughter married Robert Young Hayne, who became a U.S. Representative, mayor of Charleston, and governor of South Carolina. Pinckney was a Freemason and a Solomon&#x27;s Lodge No. 1 member in Charleston.

<text>Sir Thomas Daniel Courtenay (; born 25 February 1937) is an English actor. After studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, he achieved prominence in the 1960s as part of actors of the British New Wave. Courtenay has received numerous accolades including three BAFTA Awards, a Golden Globe Award, the Silver Bear, and the Volpi Cup for Best Actor as well as nominations for two Academy Awards, two Tony Awards, and a Emmy Award. He was knighted for his services to cinema and theatre in the 2001 New Year Honours.

Courtenay earned the BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer for his role in the coming-of-age film &quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot; (1962)⁠ and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in David Lean&#x27;s epic &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965). Other notable film roles during this period include &quot;Billy Liar&quot; (1963), &quot;King and Country&quot; (1964), &quot;King Rat&quot; (1965), and &quot;The Night of the Generals&quot; (1967).

For his performance in the 1983 film adaptation of the play &quot;The Dresser&quot;, in which he reprised the role of Norman he originated both on the West End and Broadway, Courtenay won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor and received Academy and BAFTA Award nominations. His later roles include &quot;Last Orders&quot; (2001), &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; (2002), &quot;Quartet&quot; (2012), &quot;45 Years&quot; (2015), and &quot;The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society&quot; (2018).

Courtenay received two British Academy Television Awards for his performances in the television film &quot;A Rather English Marriage&quot; (1998) and the first series of the crime drama &quot;Unforgotten&quot; (2015) as well as a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for the PBS miniseries &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; (2008).

==Early life and education==
Courtenay was born on 25 February 1937 in Kingston upon Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, the son of Annie Eliza (&quot;née&quot; Quest) and Thomas Henry Courtenay, a boat painter in Hull fish docks. He attended Kingston High School and went on to study English at University College London, where he failed his degree. After this he studied drama at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London.

==Career==
=== 1960–1977 ===

Courtenay made his stage debut in 1960 with the Old Vic theatre company at the Lyceum, Edinburgh, before taking over from Albert Finney in the title role of &quot;Billy Liar&quot; at the Cambridge Theatre in 1961. In 1963, he played that same title role in the film version, directed by John Schlesinger. He said of Albert Finney, &quot;We both have the same problem, overcoming the flat harsh speech of the North.&quot;

Courtenay&#x27;s film debut was in 1962 with &quot;Private Potter&quot;, directed by Finnish-born director Caspar Wrede, who had first spotted Courtenay while he was still at RADA. This was followed by &quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot;, directed by Tony Richardson, and &quot;Billy Liar&quot;, two highly acclaimed films and performances which helped usher in the British New Wave of the early-to-mid-1960s. For these performances Courtenay was awarded the 1962 BAFTA Award for most promising newcomer and the 1963 BAFTA Award for best actor respectively. He also was the first to record the song &quot;Mrs. Brown, You&#x27;ve Got a Lovely Daughter&quot;, doing so for the TV play &quot;The Lads&quot;. The song was released by Decca on a 45 rpm record.

For his role as the dedicated revolutionary leader Pasha Antipov in &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965), he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, but was bested by Martin Balsam. Among his other well-known films is &quot;King &amp; Country&quot;, directed by Joseph Losey, where he played opposite Dirk Bogarde; the all-star war film, &quot;Operation Crossbow&quot;, directed by Michael Anderson (starring George Peppard and Sophia Loren); &quot;King Rat&quot;, directed by Bryan Forbes and costarring James Fox and George Segal; and &quot;The Night of the Generals&quot;, directed by Anatole Litvak with Peter O&#x27;Toole and Omar Sharif. He provided physical slapstick comedy in the ultimately chilling anti-nuke black comedy &quot;The Day the Fish Came Out&quot; in 1967. In 1969 and 1971, he was in two spy-comedies, &quot;Otley&quot; (in the title role) along with &quot;Catch Me A Spy&quot; (1970) starring Kirk Douglas; and previously, in 1968, he co-starred in a serious film of that genre, &quot;A Dandy in Aspic&quot; (1968), opposite Laurence Harvey. Courtenay&#x27;s working relationship with Wrede returned to film when he played the title role in the latter&#x27;s 1970 production of &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot;.

Despite being catapulted to fame by the aforementioned films, Courtenay has said that he has not particularly enjoyed film acting; from the mid-1960s he concentrated more on stage work, although in a later Telegraph interview on 4/20/2005, he admitted &quot;I slightly overdid the anti-film thing&quot;. In 1968, Courtenay began a long association with Manchester when he played in &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot; for the Century Theatre at Manchester University directed by Michael Elliott. In 1969, Courtenay played Hamlet (John Nettles playing Laertes) for 69 Theatre Company at University Theatre in Manchester, this being the precursor of the Royal Exchange Theatre, which was founded in 1976 where he was to give many performances, firstly under the direction of Casper Wrede. His first roles for the Royal Exchange were as Faulkland in Richard Brinsley Sheridan&#x27;s The Rivals and the hero of Heinrich von Kleist&#x27;s &quot;The Prince of Homburg&quot;. Since then he has played a variety of roles, including in 1999 the leading role in the theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;King Lear&quot;, and in 2001 &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;.

=== 1980–1999 ===

Courtenay originated the role of Norman in Ronald Harwood&#x27;s &quot;The Dresser&quot; which was first produced in the West End in 1980. The production started at Royal Exchange, Manchester before transferring to the Queen&#x27;s Theatre. Courtenay acted opposite Freddie Jones as Sir. The production earned the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Play. He then reprised his role on Broadway at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre in 1981, acting opposite Paul Rogers. Courtenay received nominations for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Play for his performance. He then was cast as Norman in the film adaptation of &quot;The Dresser&quot; (1983), acting opposite Albert Finney as Sir with performances from Eileen Atkins, Edward Fox, and Michael Gough. Famed critic from the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert praised Courtenay for his performance writing, &quot;He is perfect for playing proud, resentful, self-doubting outsiders.&quot; Both Courtenay and Finney received nominations for Best Actor in the 1983 Academy Awards for their roles, losing to Robert Duvall in &quot;Tender Mercies&quot;.

He played the father of Derek Bentley (Christopher Eccleston) in the 1991 film &quot;Let Him Have It&quot;. And for an actor known to be cast in good or great films, he surprisingly co-starred in what&#x27;s been considered one of the worst movies ever, the infamous &quot;Leonard Part 6&quot; starring Bill Cosby. Courtenay&#x27;s television and radio appearances have been relatively few, but have included &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; in 1971 on BBC and several Ayckbourn plays. He appeared in &quot;I Heard the Owl Call My Name&quot; on US television in 1973. In 1994, he starred as Quilp opposite Peter Ustinov in a Disney Channel &#x27;made for television&#x27; version of &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot;. Rather unexpectedly, he had a cameo role as the anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski in the George Lucas 1995 US TV film &quot;Young Indiana Jones and the Treasure of the Peacock&#x27;s Eye&quot;. In 1998 he teamed with Albert Finney again for the acclaimed BBC drama &quot;A Rather English Marriage&quot;. He played the role of God, opposite Sebastian Graham-Jones, in Ben Steiner&#x27;s radio play &quot;A Brief Interruption&quot;, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2004. In the same year, he played the role of Stanley Laurel in Neil Brand&#x27;s radio play &#x27;Stan&#x27;, broadcast on Radio 4. Also for Radio 4, he played the title role in Nick Leather&#x27;s &quot;The Domino Man of Lancashire&quot; and &quot;Maurice&quot; in Richard Lumsden&#x27;s &quot;Man in the Moon&quot;, both broadcast in 2007. Courtenay also appeared in the 2008 Christmas special of the BBC show The Royle Family, playing the role of Dave&#x27;s father, David Sr, alongside Helen Fraser as Dave’s mother, who had played his girlfriend in Billy Liar.

=== 2001–present ===
In 2002, based on an idea by Michael Godley, Courtenay compiled a one-man show &quot;Pretending To Be Me&quot; based on the letters and writings of poet Philip Larkin, which first played at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds. It later transferred to the Comedy Theatre in the West End in London. In 2007, Courtenay appeared in two films: &quot;Flood&quot;, a disaster epic in which London is overwhelmed by floods, and &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;, an adaptation of Philip Pullman&#x27;s novel, playing the part of Farder Coram. In 2008, he appeared in the BBC adaptation of &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; by Charles Dickens, playing William Dorrit, and the Christmas edition of &quot;The Royle Family&quot;, playing David (Senior). In March 2011, he joined the cast of &quot;Gambit&quot;, a film starring fellow RADA alumnus Alan Rickman that began filming in May. The film was released in Great Britain in November 2012.

In 2012, he co-starred in romantic drama &quot;Quartet&quot; alongside Maggie Smith, directed by Dustin Hoffman. It premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival to positive reviews. In 2015, he co-starred with Charlotte Rampling in the highly-praised Andrew Haigh film, &quot;45 Years&quot;. Courtenay won international awards including the Berlin International Film Festival&#x27;s Silver Bear and Venice International Film Festival&#x27;s Volpi Cup for Best Actor. for his role as Geoff Mercer, and the film was critically-acclaimed and very well-received internationally as well as in the U.S. In 2018, he appeared in &quot;The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society&quot; starring Lily James and &quot;King of Thieves&quot; alongside Michael Caine and Michael Gambon.

In 2019, he was a panellist on &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s Alien Fun Capsule&quot;, Season 3 episode 1. For his introduction, after the other 3 guests had been announced Harry expressed surprise that the fourth seat (Courtenay&#x27;s) was empty. Harry said he knew the guest had set off some time ago, which was followed by a cut to the 1962 film &quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot; in which Courtenay&#x27;s character was running. Courtenay then entered the studio, apparently out of breath and in the same running kit he&#x27;d been wearing in the film. Also in 2019 he voiced the character of Prince Philip in &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Corgi&quot;, his first voice role, and also appeared in &quot;The Aeronauts&quot; starring Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne.

==Personal life==
Courtenay married actress Cheryl Kennedy in 1973. They divorced in 1982. In 1988, he married Isabel Crossley, a stage manager at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester. They have homes in Manchester and Putney in London. In 2000, Courtenay&#x27;s memoir &quot;Dear Tom: Letters From Home&quot; was published to critical acclaim. It comprises a selection of the letters exchanged between Courtenay and his mother, interspersed with his own recollections of life as a young student actor in London in the early 1960s.

Courtenay is the President of Hull City AFC&#x27;s Official Supporters&#x27; Club. In 1999, Courtenay was awarded an honorary doctorate by Hull University. In 2018, he was bestowed the Honorary Freedom of the City of Hull.

<text>Michael Patrick Smith (born 19 January 1942), known professionally as Michael Crawford, is an English actor, comedian and singer.

Crawford is best known for playing the hapless Frank Spencer in the sitcom &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot;, Cornelius Hackl in the musical film &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, and the titular character in the stage musical &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. His acclaimed performance in the latter earned him both the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical and Tony Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical. He has received international critical acclaim and won numerous awards during his acting career, which has included many film and television performances as well as stage work on both London&#x27;s West End and on Broadway.

Crawford has also published the autobiography &quot;Parcel Arrived Safely: Tied With String&quot;. Since 1987, he has served as the leader and public face for the British social cause organization the Sick Children&#x27;s Trust.

==Early life and education==
Crawford was brought up by his mother, Doris Agnes Mary Pike, and her parents, Montague Pike and his wife, Edith (née Keefe or O&#x27;Keefe), in what Crawford described as a &quot;close-knit Roman Catholic family&quot;. His maternal grandmother was born in County Londonderry, Ireland, and lived to be 99 years old. His mother&#x27;s first husband, Arthur Dumbell &quot;Smudge&quot; Smith, who was not his biological father, was killed, aged 22, on 6 September 1940 during the Battle of Britain, less than a year after they married. Sixteen months after Smith&#x27;s death, Crawford was born, the result of a short-lived relationship, and given his mother&#x27;s surname, which was that of her first husband.

During his early years, Crawford divided his time between the army camp in Wiltshire, where he and his mother lived during the war, and the Isle of Sheppey in Kent. The isle was where his mother had grown up and where Crawford would later live with his mother and maternal grandparents. He attended St Michael&#x27;s, a Catholic school in Bexleyheath which was run by nuns whom Crawford later described as not being shy in their use of corporal punishment. At the end of the Second World War, his mother remarried, this time to a grocer, Lionel Dennis &quot;Den&quot; Ingram. The couple moved to Herne Hill in London, where Crawford attended Oakfield Preparatory School, Dulwich, where he was known as Michael Ingram. His mother&#x27;s second marriage was abusive, according to Crawford.

==Acting career==
===Career beginnings===
Crawford made his first stage appearance in the role of Sammy the Little Sweep in his school production of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Make an Opera&quot;, conducted by Donald Mitchell, which was then transferred to Brixton Town Hall in London. He auditioned, unsuccessfully, for the role of Miles in Britten&#x27;s &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; – the role being given to another boy soprano, David Hemmings; but it appears that Crawford&#x27;s audition sufficiently impressed Britten as in 1955 he hired him to play Sammy, alternating with David Hemmings, in another production of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make an Opera&quot;, this time at the Scala Theatre in London. He also participated in the recording of that opera (as Michael Ingram, singing the role of Gay Brook) made that same year, conducted by the composer.

In 1958, Crawford was hired by the English Opera Group to create the role of Jaffet in another Britten opera, &quot;Noye&#x27;s Fludde&quot;, based on the story of Noah and the Great Flood. Crawford remembers that it was while working in this production that he realised he seriously wanted to become an actor. It was in between performances of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make an Opera&quot; and &quot;Noye&#x27;s Fludde&quot; that he was advised to change his name, &quot;to avoid confusion with a television newsman called Michael Ingram[s] who was registered with British Equity&quot;.

Crawford went on to perform in a wide repertoire. Among his stage work, he performed in André Birabeau&#x27;s French comedy &quot;Head of the Family (Dame Nature)&quot;, Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Come Blow Your Horn&quot;, Bernard Kops&#x27;s &quot;Change for the Angel&quot;, Francis Swann&#x27;s &quot;Out of the Frying Pan&quot;, Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, &quot;The Striplings&quot;, &quot;The Move After Checkmate&quot; and others. At the same time, he appeared in hundreds of BBC radio broadcasts and early BBC soap-operas, such as &quot;Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School&quot;, &quot;Emergency - Ward 10&quot;, &quot;Probation Officer&quot;, and &quot;Two Living, One Dead&quot;. He appeared as the cabin boy John Drake in the television series &quot;Sir Francis Drake&quot;, a 26-part adventure series made by ITC starring Terence Morgan and Jean Kent. He made his film debut in 1958 with leading roles in two children&#x27;s films, &quot;Blow Your Own Trumpet&quot; and &quot;Soapbox Derby&quot;, for The Children&#x27;s Film Foundation in Britain.

In 1961, Crawford appeared in an episode of &quot;One Step Beyond&quot; called &quot;The Villa&quot; in which he played a character experimenting with strobe lights. Crawford appears in the only surviving episode of the 1960 British crime series &quot;Police Surgeon&quot; alongside Ian Hendry. This series would spawn the much better-known &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

===Early adult career===
At age nineteen, he was approached to play an American, Junior Sailen, in the film &quot;The War Lover&quot; (1962), which starred Steve McQueen. To prepare for the role, he would spend hours listening to Woody Woodbury, a famous American comedian of the time, to try to perfect an American accent. After &quot;The War Lover&quot;, Crawford briefly returned to the stage and, after playing the lead role in the 1963 British film &quot;Two Left Feet&quot;, was offered a role in the British television series, &quot;Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life&quot;, as the Mod-style, tough-talking, motorbike-riding Byron. It was this character that attracted film director Richard Lester to hire him for the role of Colin in &quot;The Knack ...and How to Get It&quot; in 1965. The film was a huge success in the UK.

Lester also cast him in the film adaptation of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s musical &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot;, and &quot;How I Won the War&quot;, which starred Roy Kinnear and John Lennon (during the filming of which he lived in London with Lennon and his first wife Cynthia, and Gabrielle Lewis). Crawford starred in &quot;The Jokers&quot; (directed by Michael Winner) with Oliver Reed in 1967.

===Broadway debut===
In 1967, Crawford made his Broadway début in Peter Shaffer&#x27;s &quot;Black Comedy&quot; with Lynn Redgrave (making her début as well) in which he demonstrated his aptitude and daring for extreme physical comedy, such as walking into walls and falling down staircases. While working in the show, he was noticed by Gene Kelly and was called to Hollywood to audition for him for a part in the film adaptation of the musical &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;. He was cast and shared top billing with Barbra Streisand and Walter Matthau. Despite becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 1969, it failed to recoup its $25 million budget at the box office. It went on to win three Academy Awards, was nominated for a further four (including Best Picture), and is now considered to be one of the greatest musical films ever.

Crawford&#x27;s later films fared less successfully, although &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, in which he played the White Rabbit, enjoyed moderate success in the UK. After performing in &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, and with offers of work greatly reduced and much of his salary from &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; lost, reportedly due to underhanded investments by his agent, Crawford faced a brief period of unemployment, in which he helped his wife stuff cushions (for their upholstery business) and took a job as an office clerk in an electric company to pass the time between. During this difficult time, his marriage fell apart and divorce followed in 1975.

===&quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot;===
Crawford&#x27;s acting career took off again after he appeared on the London stage in the farce &quot;No Sex Please, We&#x27;re British&quot;, in which he played the part of frantic chief cashier Brian Runnicles. His performance led to an invitation to star in a BBC television comedy series about a childlike and eternally haphazard man who causes disaster everywhere he goes. Crawford was not the first choice for the role of Frank Spencer in &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot;. Originally, the part had been offered to comedy actor Ronnie Barker but after he and Norman Wisdom had turned it down, Crawford took on the challenge, adopting a similar characterisation to that which he used when playing Brian Runnicles. Cast alongside him was actress Michele Dotrice in the role of Frank&#x27;s long-suffering wife, Betty, and the series premiered in 1973.

&quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot; soon became one of the BBC&#x27;s most popular television series. Initially, only two series were produced, from 1973 to 1975, while the show&#x27;s creators felt that it should stop while at its peak. There was a brief hiatus until popular demand saw it revived for a final series in 1978. The immense popularity that followed the sitcom was due perhaps to the unusual amount of physical comedy involved. Crawford said he had always been a fan of comedians such as Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Laurel and Hardy, as well as the great sight gags employed in the days of silent film, and saw &quot;Some Mothers&quot; as the ideal opportunity to use such humour himself. He performed all of his own stunts during the show&#x27;s run, and never used a double.

===1970s===
While he was playing in &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot;, Crawford was approached to star in the musical &quot;Billy&quot; (based on the novel &quot;Billy Liar&quot;), which opened in 1974 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London. This was his first leading man role on the West End stage and helped to cement his career as both a singer and showman. The part was demanding, requiring proficiency in both song and dance, and in preparation for the role, Crawford began taking both more seriously, studying singing under the tutelage of vocal coach Ian Adam and spending hours perfecting his dancing capabilities with choreographer Onna White.

&quot;Billy&quot; gave the many fans of Crawford&#x27;s portrayal of Frank Spencer an opportunity to see him in a broadly similar role on the stage, and was a considerable hit (904 West End performances). After the closing of &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot;, Crawford continued to perform in plays and musicals, starring in &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; (1979) in the role of Charley Gordon, based on the book of the same title. He pursued another role on an ITV sitcom, &quot;Chalk and Cheese&quot;, as the slovenly, uncouth Dave Finn. The show did not go over well with his fans: the popularity of Crawford&#x27;s portrayal of Frank Spencer, and the similar Billy Fisher character, had left him somewhat typecast, to the extent that they could not accept his very different role as Dave Finn. Crawford abandoned the show during its first series and returned to theatre work.

===1980s===

====&quot;Condorman&quot;====
Crawford starred in the 1981 Disney comedy/adventure film &quot;Condorman&quot;, playing an eccentric American comic book writer and illustrator named Woody Wilkins who is asked by his friend at the CIA to help a Russian woman to defect while acting out the fantasy of bringing his comic book creation, Condorman, to life. Critics panned the film. On their television show, critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert featured the film in their round-up of the year&#x27;s worst films pointing out the less-than-special effects such as the visible harness and cable used to suspend Condorman in the air and the obvious bluescreen effect. The film performed poorly at the box office but years later gained a cult following among Disney fans.

====&quot;Barnum&quot;====
Also in 1981, Crawford starred in the original London production of Cy Coleman&#x27;s &quot;Barnum&quot; (1981) as the illustrious American showman P. T. Barnum. He trained at the &quot;Big Apple Circus School&quot; in New York City to prepare for the ambitious stunts, learning to walk the tight-rope, juggle and slide down a rope from the rafters of the theatre. After further training for the second opening of &quot;Barnum&quot;, he was awarded a British Amateur Gymnastics Association badge and certificate as a qualified coach.

&quot;Barnum&quot; opened on 11 June 1981 at the London Palladium, where it ran for 655 performances. Crawford and Deborah Grant headed the cast. It was well-received, becoming a favourite of Margaret Thatcher as well as the Queen Mother. Crawford earned his first Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical on the London stage. After the initial production of the show, he worked extensively with Torvill and Dean, and can be seen rinkside with them as they received their &quot;perfect six&quot; marks in the 1983 world championships for their &#x27;Barnum&#x27; routine.

In 1984 a revival of &quot;Barnum&quot; opened in Manchester at the Opera House, ending the tour at the Victoria Palace in the West End. In 1986 this production, with a new cast, though still headed by Crawford, was recorded for television and broadcast by the BBC. Crawford&#x27;s &quot;Barnum&quot; is one of the longest runs by a leading actor.

====&quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;====
In 1984, at the final preview of &quot;Starlight Express&quot;, Crawford happened to run into the show&#x27;s creator, Andrew Lloyd Webber. Lloyd Webber had met Crawford socially several times and remembered him from his work in &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;. He informed Crawford that he was working on a new project based on a Gaston Leroux novel and wanted to know whether he was interested. Crawford said he was, but the show was still in the early planning stages, and nothing had been decided. Several months passed, during which Lloyd Webber had already created a pitch video featuring his then-wife Sarah Brightman as the female lead Christine, and British rocker Steve Harley as the Phantom, singing the title song in the manner of a contemporary new wave video. Crawford was turned off by that, supposing the songwriter had chosen to do a &quot;rock opera&quot;-inspired spectacle in lieu of a more traditional operatic musical.

Since casting Harley, however, Lloyd Webber had also begun to regret his artistic choices. According to the &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; documentary, he and producer Cameron Mackintosh agreed that Harley was neither an actor nor a commanding theatre presence, two areas in which Crawford had gained significant experience by this point. As production continued on the show, the bulk of the score was revealing itself to be far more classical and operatic, entirely unsuited to Harley&#x27;s rough, contemporary voice. Wanting instead a performer with a more classic, melodic voice, as described in the original book, he began yet another search for the perfect actor to play his Phantom. Crawford&#x27;s landing of the role was due in large part to the coincidence that he and Brightman were taking lessons from the same vocal coach, Ian Adam. Brightman and her husband had arrived early for her lesson, and it was while waiting that they chanced to hear Crawford practising the aria &quot;Care Selve&quot;, from the opera &quot;Atalanta&quot; by Handel. Intrigued, Lloyd Webber asked Adam who his student was. Soon after, Crawford was called in for an audition and was hired virtually on the spot.

Many critics were sceptical; Crawford was still largely pigeonholed as the hapless Frank Spencer, and questions were asked about his ability to manage such a vocally and dramatically demanding role. 

In September 1986, Crawford began his performances in London at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre. In October 1987, he was replaced in London by Dave Willetts, as he transferred over to Broadway. In January 1988, he started performances of the show on Broadway and in October of that same year, he was replaced by Timothy Nolen. Crawford then went on to start performing the show in Los Angeles in 1989. He played the Phantom for three and a half years and over 1,300 performances across the three productions, winning an Olivier Award (Best Actor in a Musical), a Tony Award (Best Performance by an Actor in a Lead Role, Musical), a New York Drama Desk Award, and a Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for Distinguished Achievement in Theatre (Lead Performance).

During the run of &quot;Phantom&quot; in Los Angeles, Crawford was asked to perform &quot;The Music of the Night&quot; at the Inaugural Gala for President George H. W. Bush in Washington, D.C., on 19 January 1989. At the gala, Crawford was presented with a cake in celebration of his 47th birthday. 

On 29 April 1990, after three and a half years and over 1,300 performances later, Crawford left the show for the final time. He admits to having been saddened at his departure, and, during the final Lair scene, altered the Phantom&#x27;s line to &quot;Christine... I &quot;loved&quot; you&quot;, acknowledging that this was his final performance.

However, on 31 December 1990, he returned to the role in Los Angeles replacing Robert Guillaume in the role. Crawford played his true final performance on 28 April 1991. Davis Gaines replaced him in the production.

===1990s===
At the request of Liz Kirschner, wife of film producer David Kirschner, he obtained the role of Cornelius in 20th Century Fox&#x27;s animated film &quot;Once Upon a Forest&quot;, which was produced by her husband.

In 1995, Crawford created the high-profile starring role in &quot;EFX&quot;, the US$70 million production which officially opened the 1,700-seat MGM Grand Theatre in Las Vegas. The Atlantic Theater label released the companion album to EFX. Early into the run, Crawford suffered an accident during a performance (which involved him sliding from a wire hanger from the back of the theatre all the way to the stage and then jumping down to the stage itself) and left the show to recover from his injury, which resulted in an early hip replacement operation.

In the mid 1990s, Michael began a long-term relationship with Natasha MacAller, an American dancer and chef.

===2000s to present===
In 2001, Crawford sang Baby Mine from Disney&#x27;s &quot;Dumbo&quot; on its 60th anniversary VHS and DVD.
Crawford had a short comeback to Broadway as the Count von Krolock in the short-lived musical &quot;Dance of the Vampires&quot; (2002–03). He originated the role of Count Fosco in Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;The Woman in White&quot;, which opened at the Palace Theatre, London in September 2004. However, he was forced to leave the show three months later because of ill health caused by dehydration resulting from the enormous fat-suit he wore during the performance. He spent several months recuperating and was thus unable to reprise the role on Broadway. He learned he was suffering from the post-viral condition myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), which debilitated him for six years.

He later moved to New Zealand briefly, both to be near his daughter and her family in Australia and to convalesce from his illness.

In 2006, Crawford attended the Gala Performance of the stage version of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; on Broadway at the Majestic Theatre to celebrate the show&#x27;s becoming the longest-running musical in Broadway history (surpassing the run of &quot;Cats&quot;). He was delighted with it, stating this was the first time he had been an audience member of any of the shows he had done.

On 23 October 2010, Crawford attended the celebratory 10,000th performance of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; in London alongside composer Andrew Lloyd Webber. Crawford spoke of his own memories of the first performance 24 years ago, and was then presented, along with Lloyd Webber, with a special cake to commemorate the landmark achievement.

Beginning with previews in February 2011, Crawford originated the part of the Wizard in the new Andrew Lloyd Webber/Tim Rice musical version of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; at the London Palladium, which had its official opening on 1 March 2011. He stated on &quot;This Morning: Sunday&quot;, on 14 August 2011, that he had signed on for a further six months in the show. He left the production on 5 February 2012; the same day as co-star Danielle Hope played her final performance as Dorothy. From 14 February, Russell Grant took over the role.

On 2 October 2011 Crawford made a special appearance during the finale of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall&quot; — a fully staged production of the musical at the famous London venue – marking 25 years since the show received its world premiere. Although reunited with Sarah Brightman, he did no real singing as he had just finished performing in a matinee of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; at the London Palladium.

On 18 March 2016 Crawford and Dotrice reprised their roles in a one-off special of &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot;, broadcast as part of the Sport Relief charity fundraiser event.

Crawford starred in the new West End musical &quot;The Go-Between&quot; which premiered on 27 May 2016 at Apollo Theatre. He appeared in the 60th anniversary performance of Britten&#x27;s &quot;Noye&#x27;s Fludde&quot; in London in 2018, performing the Voice of God, and recalled in a BBC Radio 3 interview Benjamin Britten&#x27;s valuable support in his early career.

==Recording career and chart success==
In 1987, during Crawford&#x27;s starring role in &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, a double A-sided single was released featuring two songs from the musical: &quot;The Music of the Night&quot;, sung by Crawford, and &quot;Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again&quot;, sung by his &quot;Phantom&quot; co-star Sarah Brightman. It reached number seven in the UK Singles Chart.

Following on from this, in the same year Crawford released a studio album of show tunes with the London Symphony Orchestra, titled &quot;Songs from the Stage and Screen&quot;, which reached number 12 in the UK Albums Chart and number 74 on the Australian Music Report chart. From this album, his version of &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; was released as a single, reaching number 97 in the UK Singles Chart.

&quot;Songs from the Stage and Screen&quot; was followed by other charting studio albums recorded by Crawford, including &quot;With Love / The Phantom Unmasked&quot; (1989), &quot;Michael Crawford Performs Andrew Lloyd Webber&quot; (1991), &quot;A Touch of Music in the Night&quot; (1993), &quot;On Eagle&#x27;s Wings&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Disney Album&quot; (2001), as well as several compilation albums. &quot;A Touch of Music in the Night&quot; included a new version of the &quot;Phantom&quot; song &quot;The Music of the Night&quot;, this time recorded as a duet between Crawford and Barbra Streisand. Released as a single, it reached number 54 in the UK Singles Chart in early 1994. It was also included on Streisand&#x27;s album &quot;Back to Broadway&quot; (1993), and was nominated for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 1994 Grammy Awards.

==Concert tours==
Crawford has performed many concert tours in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, beginning with &quot;The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber&quot; in 1992. In 1998, Crawford began &quot;Michael Crawford: Live In Concert&quot; tour around the United States. One performance, done at the Cerritos Arts Center in Los Angeles, was filmed and broadcast on PBS for their annual fundraiser.

In 2006, he made a small concert tour of Australia and New Zealand, as well as a one-night benefit to open the LaSalle Bank Theatre in Chicago. He has also done various Michael Crawford International Fan Association (MCIFA) exclusive concerts around the US. The MCIFA makes contributions to many charities.

==Charity work==
Since the late 1980s, Crawford has affiliated himself with various charities, particularly for the good of children. He is a patron of the Lighthouse Foundation in Australia, and has also been President of the Sick Children&#x27;s Trust since 1987.

== Personal life ==

Crawford has three children. Two, born in 1966 and 1968, were daughters from his first marriage to Gabrielle Lewis.

In 2007, Crawford relocated to New Zealand for health reasons, as he sought recovery from his diagnosed myalgic encephalitis and to be closer to one of his daughters who had settled in Australia.

<text>Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em is a British sitcom broadcast on BBC1, created and written by Raymond Allen and starring Michael Crawford and Michele Dotrice. It was first broadcast in 1973 and ran for two series, including two Christmas specials in 1974 and 1975. After a three-year absence, the programme returned for a third series in 1978 and again in 2016 for a one-off special. The series regularly garnered 25 million viewers and was broadcast in 60 countries.

The series follows the maladroit Frank Spencer through his various attempts to get and keep a job, which frequently end in disaster. The sitcom was noted for its stunt work, performed by Crawford himself, and it featured several well-known and much-lampooned catchphrases that have become part of British popular culture. In the 2004 series &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;, &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot; placed 22nd in the list of all British sitcoms.

==Title==
The series was originally conceived under the working title &quot;Have a Break, Take a Husband&quot;.

The expression &quot;some mothers do have them&quot; was once a common British euphemism to refer to a foolish or inept person.

==Character of Frank Spencer==
The ambitious but accident-prone Frank Spencer, who often wears his trademark beret and mackintosh, is married to the long-suffering Betty (Michele Dotrice), and in later series they have a baby daughter, Jessica.

The character was popular with impressionists such as Mike Yarwood in the 1970s, particularly Frank&#x27;s ostensible main catchphrase, &quot;Ooh Betty&quot;, which may actually have been said in only one episode (Series 2, Episode 2).

Other catchphrases include a quavering &quot;Oooh ...&quot;, usually uttered with Frank&#x27;s forefinger to his mouth as he stands amidst the chaos of some disaster he has just caused. He also sometimes complains about being &quot;ha-RASSed!&quot;, or, occasionally, &quot;I&#x27;ve had a lot of ha-RASSments lately&quot; (originally an American pronunciation). Other recurring catchphrases include references to &quot;a bit of trouble&quot; and to the cat having &quot;done a whoopsie&quot; (presumably a euphemism for having defecated in an inappropriate place, on one occasion in Spencer&#x27;s beret). When Frank is pleased or confused, he will often use the catchphrases &quot;Mmmm – nice!&quot; or &quot;Ohhh – nice!&quot;.

Frank is essentially a sympathetic character who is loved by Betty despite his faults. He venerates the memory of his late mother and treasures his daughter. References to Frank&#x27;s mother suggest she was very much like her son. Frank claimed he last saw his father at Paddington Station when only 18 months old. Crawford has mentioned that he based many of Frank&#x27;s reactions on those of a young child.

The final series was produced after a break of five years (not counting two Christmas specials). Though still written by Raymond Allen, it was based on stories by Crawford. Frank&#x27;s character changes noticeably in this series, becoming more self-aware and keen to make himself appear educated and well-spoken. He develops an air of pomposity, best demonstrated when someone enquires for &quot;Mr. Spencer?&quot;, to which he habitually replies, &quot;I am he.&quot; He also becomes more self-assured and more willing to defend himself when criticised, sometimes winning arguments by leaving his opponents dumbfounded by the bizarre nature of his statements. Frank also commits numerous malapropisms, especially when using long words to sound clever. For example, in the final episode he says &#x27;pissimestic&#x27; instead of &#x27;pessimistic&#x27;.
Acknowledging the show&#x27;s success in Australia, in the final series Frank mentions relations who live there and contemplates emigrating himself.

==Legacy==
Crawford later had difficulty disassociating himself from the role, despite his career as a successful musical performer on the West End and Broadway stage and in popular musicals such as &quot;Barnum&quot; and &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;.

==Cast==
Ronnie Barker and Norman Wisdom were the BBC&#x27;s first and second choices for the role of Frank. David Jason was also a contender, but he was rejected because BBC executives at the time believed that he lacked star quality. However, the casting of Crawford proved effective because he invented many of Frank&#x27;s mannerisms and catchphrases (some of which he had employed in the 1969 film &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;), and because of his ability to perform stunts and physical comedy.

* Michael Crawford as Frank Spencer
* Michele Dotrice as Betty Spencer (née Fisher)

===Guest cameos===
Most episodes would introduce at least one other character (such as a doctor, neighbour or employer) who would usually become unnerved by Frank&#x27;s peculiar manner and clumsiness.

Guest cameo roles were played by actors including George Baker, James Cossins, Peter Jeffrey, Richard Wilson, Fulton Mackay, Bernard Hepton, Christopher Timothy, George Sewell, Bryan Pringle, Christopher Biggins, Milton Johns, Diane Holland, John Ringham, David Ryall, Gretchen Franklin, Geoffrey Chater, Royston Tickner, Michael Redfern, Babar Bhatti, Norman Chappell, Geoffrey Whitehead, Desmond Llewelyn and Elisabeth Sladen (who, in her autobiography, mentions that she was considered for the role of Betty).

==In popular culture==
* In &quot;The Now Show&quot;, Prince Edward is usually portrayed as Frank Spencer by Hugh Dennis. In an episode from June 2010, a sketch featured Fabio Capello using Frank Spencer impressions as a motivational strategy for the England World Cup squad.
* The programme, and the character of Frank Spencer specifically, have even been mentioned several times in the UK House of Commons. On one notable occasion, Labour Party leader John Smith taunted Conservative prime minister John Major in a speech in 1993 by saying that recent government mishaps would be considered &quot;too much&quot; if submitted to the show&#x27;s producers by scriptwriters.
* On 14 November 1998 during an edition of &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot;, Michael Crawford appeared as Frank to celebrate 25 years of the show.
* Arctic Monkeys mention Frank Spencer in their song &quot;You Probably Couldn&#x27;t See for the Lights but You Were Staring Straight at Me&quot; from their 2006 album, &quot;Whatever People Say I Am, That&#x27;s What I&#x27;m Not&quot; with the lines: &quot;I&#x27;m so tense, never tenser/Could all go a bit Frank Spencer.&quot;
* Reuben named a song after the show – &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot; is the second track on their second album Very Fast Very Dangerous.
* The title of the series, &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot;, is similar to Jimmy Clitheroe&#x27;s catchphrase from the late-1950s to early-1970s: &quot;Don&#x27;t Some Mothers &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em?&quot;
* Many of Frank Spencer&#x27;s antics and catchphrases have been lampooned by numerous comedians, including Mike Yarwood and Lenny Henry.
* In the &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; episode &quot;The Trial&quot;, when Victor Meldrew calls a garden centre to complain about a yucca plant that was delivered to his house being placed inside the toilet bowl with compost (after Meldrew requested that it be put in the downstairs toilet), he says that he does not know who delivered the plant but adds that it &quot;may have been Frank Spencer&quot;. Actor Richard Wilson who played Meldrew appeared in 1978 episode “Wendy House” of &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot; as Mr Harris.

==Stage adaptation==
A stage adaptation, written and directed by Guy Unsworth based on the television series, began a UK tour at the Wyvern Theatre, Swindon in February 2018. It starred Joe Pasquale as Frank Spencer, with Sarah Earnshaw as Betty and Susie Blake as Mrs. Fisher.

Following the success of the 2018 tour, the production began another tour in February 2020, but because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many dates were postponed to 2022.

<text>John Smith (1825–1910) was a Scottish dentist, philanthropist and pioneering educator. The founder of the Edinburgh school of dentistry, he served as president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (1883) and president of the
British Dental Association. He was the official surgeon/dentist to Queen Victoria when in Scotland.

==Life==
Smith was born in Edinburgh, the son of dental surgeon John Smith. His family lived at 30 Frederick Street in the New Town.

He was educated at the Edinburgh Institution, the University of Edinburgh (MD 1847) and the Royal College of Surgeons. He conducted postgraduate studies in London and Paris, making drawings of gunshot and sabre wounds. He took over his father&#x27;s dental practice in 1851.

In 1856 Smith started teaching the first regular courses on dental physiology and diseases in Scotland. His lectures were given at Surgeons&#x27; Hall as part of the Edinburgh Extramural School of Medicine. He was surgeon dentist to the Royal Public Dispensary. He co-founded the Hospital for Sick Children in 1859. Recognising the need for improved training, he founded, together with Francis Brodie Imlach, Peter Orphoot and Robert Nasmyth, the Edinburgh Dental Dispensary in 1860.

In 1862 Smith was elected a member of the Harveian Society of Edinburgh and served as president in 1888. In 1871 he was appointed Surgeon Dentist to Queen Victoria, and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, upon the nomination of John Hutton Balfour. In 1876 he was elected a member of the Aesculapian Club and was Honorary Secretary from 1887 to 1905.

The Dental Dispensary grew into the Edinburgh Dental Hospital and School by 1879.

He was awarded an honorary doctorate (LLD) by the University of Edinburgh in 1884.

Smith was also a moderately successful playwright. He was a senior elder in St Andrews Parish Church in Edinburgh.

In his final years he lived at 11 Wemyss Place, a fine Georgian house on the Moray Estate in Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town. The dental practice element (in the same property) was taken over by William Guy from around 1899.

He died on 15 April 1910. He is buried on the edge of the path which runs over the central vaults in Warriston Cemetery.

==Family==
In 1853 he married Elizabeth Marjory Peters (1830–1912).

<text>John Smith (27 June 1790 – 6 February 1824) was an English missionary and abolitionist whose experiences in the British West Indies attracted the attention of the anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce. As a result of his actions, trial by court-martial and subsequent death whilst under imprisonment, Smith became known as the &quot;Demerara Martyr&quot;. His case, and news of the enormous size of the uprising and the brutal loss of African life, caused a great awakening in England, strengthening the abolitionist cause which eventually succeeded in British territories worldwide in 1838.

==Biography==
Smith was born an orphan on 27 June 1790 in Northamptonshire. He received his early education only at Sunday school, and trained to be a baker, after which he applied to be a missionary. He married Jane Godden. On 12 December 1816 he was ordained at Tonbridge Chapel.

Smith arrived in Demerara under the auspices of the London Missionary Society on 23 February 1817. He lived at the &#x27;Le Resouvenir&#x27; plantation, where he preached at Bethel Chapel, primarily attended by African slaves.

In the morning of 18 August 1823, in what is known as the &#x27;Demerara rebellion of 1823&#x27;, about ten to twelve thousand slaves drawn from plantations on the East Coast of the Demerara colony rebelled, under the belief that their masters were concealing news of the slaves&#x27; emancipation.

Smith was subsequently charged with promoting discontent and dissatisfaction in the minds of the African slaves, exciting the slaves to rebel, and failing to notify the authorities that the slaves intended to rebel. In his trial he was defended by William Arrindell. John Smith was arraigned in a court-martial before Lt. Col. Goodman on 13 October.

Smith&#x27;s trial concluded one month later, on 24 November; Smith was found guilty of the principal charges, and was given the death sentence; he was transferred from Colony House to prison. Bryant suggested that a pre-existing illness was the cause of Smith&#x27;s demise on 6 February 1824, before the intended Royal reprieve arrived; he asserted that Smith had been ill for some time, but that his accommodation was airy and spacious and that had been looked after with &quot;utmost attention and kindness&quot;. Others, namely Jakobssen (1972) Craton (1982), however, state that Smith died in a damp prison of consumption. Out of fear of stirring up slave sentiment, the colonists interred him at four a.m., without marking his grave. His death was a major step forward in the campaign to abolish slavery. News of his death was published in British newspapers, provoked enormous outrage and garnered 200 petitions to Parliament.

<doc id="163381" wikidata="Q3778021" url="?curid=163381" title="Eamonn Andrews">
<text>Eamonn Andrews, (19 December 1922 – 5 November 1987) was an Irish radio and television presenter, employed primarily in the United Kingdom from the 1950s to the 1980s. From 1960 to 1964 he chaired the Radio Éireann Authority (now the RTÉ Authority), which oversaw the introduction of a state television service in Ireland. He is perhaps best remembered as the UK host of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; from its inception in 1955 until his death in 1987.

==Early life==

Andrews was born in Synge Street, Dublin, son of carpenter William Andrews and Margaret, née Farrell. He was educated at Synge Street CBS. He began his career as a clerk in an insurance office. He was a keen amateur boxer and won the Irish junior middleweight title in 1944.

==Broadcasting career==

By 1944, he was the Hon. Secretary of St. Andrew&#x27;s Boxing Club. In 1946, he became a full-time freelance sports commentator, working for Radio Éireann, Ireland&#x27;s state broadcaster. In 1950, he began presenting programmes for the BBC, being particularly well known for boxing commentaries, and soon became one of television&#x27;s most popular presenters. The following year, the game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; began and Andrews was the host. He was also an occasional panellist on the American version, and once acted as host when John Charles Daly was absent.

Throughout the 1950s, he commentated on the major British heavyweight fights on the BBC Light Programme, with inter-round summaries by W. Barrington Dalby. On 20 January 1956, he reached No 18 in the UK Singles Chart with a &quot;spoken narrative&quot; recording named &quot;The Shifting Whispering Sands (Parts 1 &amp; 2)&quot;, which was produced by George Martin with musical backing by the Ron Goodwin Orchestra, released by Parlophone as catalogue number R 4106, a double-sided 78 rpm record. The song later reappeared on Kenny Everett&#x27;s compilation album &quot;The World&#x27;s Worst Record Show&quot;, released in June 1978.

Between 1955 and 1964, he presented the long-running &quot;Sports Report&quot; on the BBC Light Programme. In 1965, he left the BBC to join the ITV contractor ABC, where he was the first host of &quot;World of Sport&quot; and where he pioneered the chat show format in the UK. He hosted &quot;The Eamonn Andrews Show&quot; on ITV for five years. He was known for coming up with off-the-cuff linkings that did not work, such as: &quot;Speaking of cheese sandwiches, have you come far?&quot; This was parodied by the character Seamus Android on &quot;Round the Horne&quot; in the 1960s, performed by Bill Pertwee. In the 1960s and 1970s he presented Thames Television&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; news magazine programme.

He was probably best known as the presenter of the UK version of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, between its inception in 1955 and his death in 1987, when he was succeeded by Michael Aspel (who like Andrews hosted &quot;Crackerjack!&quot; nearly twenty years earlier). Andrews was the first &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; subject on British television when he was surprised by the show&#x27;s creator, Ralph Edwards. Andrews also created a long-running panel game called &quot;Whose Baby?&quot; that originally ran on the BBC and later on ITV. He was a regular presenter of the early Miss World pageants.

Andrews chaired the Radio Éireann Authority (now the RTÉ Authority) between 1960 and 1964, overseeing the introduction of state television to the Ireland and establishing the broadcaster as an independent semi-state body. At about this time, he also acquired a number of business interests in Ireland, including recording studios and a dance hall. Andrews stepped down from the RTÉ Authority amidst a bitter political storm over what was seen as the controversial content of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. Before leaving RTÉ, Andrews defended the show as &#x27;freedom of expression&#x27;.

==Death==

After months of illness during 1987, originally caused by a virus contracted during a plane journey, Andrews died from heart failure on 5 November 1987 aged 64 at the Cromwell Hospital in London.

He had recorded his last edition of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; six days before on 30 October 1987. After his death, the show, and two others that had yet to be broadcast, were postponed until, with his widow&#x27;s permission, they were broadcast in January 1988.

A funeral service was held for Andrews at St Anne&#x27;s Church in Portmarnock where he had his home, and his body was buried in Balgriffin Cemetery to the north of Dublin. A memorial mass was held for him in Westminster Cathedral.

==Personal life==

Andrews married Gráinne Bourke in 1951. They raised three adopted children.

==Civic recognition==

For his work in British broadcasting, Andrews was awarded an honorary Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1970.

Andrews&#x27; contribution to radio in the United Kingdom is commemorated in the Radio Academy Hall of Fame.

<doc id="163382" wikidata="Q139712" url="?curid=163382" title="John Le Mesurier">
<text>John Le Mesurier (, born John Elton Le Mesurier Halliley; 5 April 191215 November 1983) was an English actor. He is probably best remembered for his comedic role as Sergeant Arthur Wilson in the BBC television situation comedy &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; (1968–1977). A self-confessed &quot;jobbing actor&quot;, Le Mesurier appeared in more than 120 films across a range of genres, normally in smaller supporting parts.

Le Mesurier became interested in the stage as a young adult and enrolled at the Fay Compton Studio of Dramatic Art in 1933. From there he took a position in repertory theatre and made his stage debut in September 1934 at the Palladium Theatre in Edinburgh in the J. B. Priestley play &quot;Dangerous Corner&quot;. He later accepted an offer to work with Alec Guinness in a John Gielgud production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. He first appeared on television in 1938 as Seigneur de Miolans in the BBC broadcast of &quot;The Marvellous History of St Bernard&quot;. During the Second World War Le Mesurier was posted to British India, as a captain with the Royal Tank Regiment. Following the war, he returned to acting and made his film debut in 1948, starring in the second feature comedy short &quot;Death in the Hand&quot;, opposite Esme Percy and Ernest Jay.

Le Mesurier had a prolific film career, appearing mostly in comedies, usually in roles portraying figures of authority such as army officers, policemen and judges. As well as &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;, Le Mesurier appeared in Tony Hancock&#x27;s two principal films, &quot;The Rebel&quot; and &quot;The Punch and Judy Man&quot;. In 1971, Le Mesurier received his only award: a British Academy of Film and Television Arts &quot;Best Television Actor&quot; award for his lead performance in Dennis Potter&#x27;s television play &quot;Traitor&quot;; it was one of his few lead roles.

He took a relaxed approach to acting and felt that his parts were those of &quot;a decent chap all at sea in a chaotic world not of his own making.&quot; Le Mesurier was married three times, most notably to the actress Hattie Jacques. A heavy drinker of alcohol for most of his life, Le Mesurier died in 1983, aged 71, from a stomach haemorrhage, brought about as a complication of cirrhosis of the liver. After his death, critics reflected that, for an actor who normally took minor roles, the viewing public were &quot;enormously fond of him&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Le Mesurier was born John Elton Le Mesurier Halliley in Bedford on 5 April 1912. His parents were Charles Elton Halliley, a solicitor, and Amy Michelle ( Le Mesurier), whose family were from Alderney in the Channel Islands; both families were affluent, with histories of government service or work in the legal profession. While John was an infant the family settled in Bury St Edmunds, in West Suffolk. He was sent to school, first to Grenham House in Kent, and later to Sherborne School in Dorset, where one of his fellow pupils was the mathematician Alan Turing.

Le Mesurier disliked both schools intensely, citing insensitive teaching methods and an inability to accept individualism. He later wrote: &quot;I resented Sherborne for its closed mind, its collective capacity for rejecting anything that did not conform to the image of manhood as portrayed in the ripping yarns of a scouting manual.”

From an early age Le Mesurier had been interested in acting and performing; as a child he had frequently been taken to the West End of London to watch Ralph Lynn and Tom Walls perform in the series of farces at the Aldwych Theatre. In his childhood in Bury St Edmunds, the family lived less than 300 yards from the Theatre Royal, and his autobiography records meeting actors from that theatre as his earliest childhood memory. These experiences fuelled an early desire to make a career on the stage. After leaving school he was initially persuaded to follow his father&#x27;s line of work, as an articled clerk at Greene &amp; Greene, a firm of solicitors in Bury St Edmunds; in his spare time he took part in local amateur dramatics. In 1933 he decided to leave the legal profession, and in September he enrolled at the Fay Compton Studio of Dramatic Art; a fellow student was the actor Alec Guinness, with whom he became close friends.

In July 1934, the studio staged their annual public revue in which both Le Mesurier and Guinness took part; among the judges for the event were John Gielgud, Leslie Henson, Alfred Hitchcock and Ivor Novello. Le Mesurier received a Certificate of Fellowship, while Guinness won the Fay Compton prize. After the revue, rather than remain at the studio for further tuition, Le Mesurier took an opportunity to join the Edinburgh-based Millicent Ward Repertory Players at a salary of £3.10s (£3.50) a week.

===Career===

====1934–1946====
The Millicent Ward repertory company typically staged evening performances of three-act plays; the works changed each week, and rehearsals were held during the daytime for the following week&#x27;s production. Under his birth name John Halliley, Le Mesurier made his stage debut in September 1934 at the Palladium Theatre, Edinburgh in the J. B. Priestley play &quot;Dangerous Corner&quot;, along with three other newcomers to the company. The reviewer for &quot;The Scotsman&quot; thought that Le Mesurier was well cast in the role. Appearances in &quot;While Parents Sleep&quot; and &quot;Cavalcade&quot; were followed by a break, as problems arose with the lease of the theatre. Le Mesurier then accepted an offer to appear with Alec Guinness in a John Gielgud production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, which began in Streatham in the spring of 1935 and later toured the English provinces. Le Mesurier understudied Anthony Quayle&#x27;s role of Guildenstern, and otherwise appeared in the play as an extra.

In July 1935, Le Mesurier was hired by the Oldham repertory company, based at the Coliseum Theatre; his first appearance with them was in a version of the Wilson Collison play, &quot;Up in Mabel&#x27;s Room&quot;; he was sacked after one week for missing a performance after oversleeping. In September 1935, he moved to the Sheffield Repertory Theatre to appear in &quot;Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary&quot;, and also played Malvolio in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. Le Mesurier later commented on the slow progress of his career: &quot;had I known it was going to take so long, I might well have given the whole thing up&quot;. In 1937 he joined the Croydon Repertory Theatre, where he appeared in nine productions in 1936 and 1937. During this period Le Mesurier changed his professional name from John Halliley to John Le Mesurier; his biographer Graham McCann observes that &quot;he never bothered, at least in public, to explain the reason for his decision&quot;. Le Mesurier used his new name for the first time in the September 1937 production of &quot;Love on the Dole&quot;.

Le Mesurier first appeared on television in 1938, thus becoming one of the medium&#x27;s pioneering actors. His initial appearance was in a production of &quot;The Marvellous History of St Bernard&quot; in which he appeared as Seigneur de Miolans in a play adapted from a 15th-century manuscript by Henri Ghéon. Alongside the television appearance, he continued to appear on stage in Edinburgh and Glasgow with the Howard and Wyndham Players, at least until late 1938 when he returned to London and re-joined Croydon Repertory Theatre.

His second spell with the troupe ended a few months later when, from May to October 1939 he appeared in &quot;Gaslight&quot;, first in London and subsequently on tour. The reviewer in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; considered that Le Mesurier gave &quot;a faultless performance&quot;, and that &quot;the character is not overemphasised. One may praise it best by saying that Mr. Le Mesurier gives one a really uncomfortable feeling in the stomach&quot;.

From November to December 1939, Le Mesurier toured Britain in a production of &quot;Goodness, How Sad&quot;, during which time he met the director&#x27;s daughter, June Melville, whom he married in April 1940. After spending January and February 1940 in &quot;French Without Tears&quot; at the Grand Theatre in Blackpool, he returned to London where he was employed by the Brixton Theatre, appearing in a series of productions. In his time in repertory, Le Mesurier took on a variety of roles across several genres; his biographer Graham McCann observed that his range included &quot;comedies and tragedies, thrillers and fantasies, tense courtroom dramas and frenzied farces, Shakespeare and Ibsen, Sheridan and Wilde, Molière and Shaw, Congreve and Coward. The range was remarkable&quot;.

In September 1940 Le Mesurier&#x27;s rented home was hit by a German bomb, destroying all his possessions, including his call-up papers. In the same bombing raid, the theatre in Brixton in which he was working was also hit. A few days later he reported for basic training with the Royal Armoured Corps; in June 1941 he was commissioned into the Royal Tank Regiment. He served in Britain until 1943 when he was posted to British India where he spent the rest of the war. Le Mesurier later claimed that he had had &quot;a comfortable war, with captaincy thrust upon me, before I was demobbed in 1946&quot;.

====1946–1959====
On his return to Britain, Le Mesurier returned to acting; he initially struggled for work, finding only a few minor roles. In February 1948 he made his film debut in the second feature comedy short &quot;Death in the Hand&quot;, which starred Esme Percy and Ernest Jay. He followed this with equally small roles in the 1949 film &quot;Old Mother Riley&#x27;s New Venture&quot;—where his name was misspelt on the credits as &quot;Le Meseurier&quot;—and the 1950 crime film &quot;Dark Interval&quot;. During the same period he also frequently appeared on stage in Birmingham.

Le Mesurier undertook several roles on television in 1951, including that of Doctor Forrest in &quot;The Railway Children&quot;, the blackmailer Eduardo Lucas in &quot;Sherlock Holmes: The Second Stain&quot;, and Joseph in the nativity play &quot;A Time to be Born&quot;. The same year Tony Hancock joined Le Mesurier&#x27;s second wife, Hattie Jacques (the couple had married in 1949 following his divorce from June Melville earlier that year) in the radio series &quot;Educating Archie&quot;. Le Mesurier and Hancock became friends; they would often go for drinking sessions around Soho, where they ended up in jazz clubs. After Hancock left &quot;Educating Archie&quot; in 1952 after one season, the friendship continued, and Jacques joined the cast of &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; during the fourth radio series in 1956.

In 1952, as well as appearing in the films &quot;Blind Man&#x27;s Bluff&quot; and &quot;Mother Riley Meets the Vampire&quot;, Le Mesurier also appeared as the doctor in &quot;Angry Dust&quot; at the New Torch Theatre, London. Parnell Bradbury, writing in &quot;The Times&quot;, thought Le Mesurier had played the role extraordinarily well; Harold Hobson, writing in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, thought that &quot;the trouble with Mr. John Le Mesurier&#x27;s Dr. Weston is that he approaches the man too snarlingly ... [it is] a notion of genius that would be unacceptable anywhere outside Victorian melodrama&quot;. In 1953, he had a role as a bureaucrat in the short film &quot;The Pleasure Garden&quot;, which won the &quot;Prix du Film de Fantaisie Poétique&quot; at the Cannes Film Festival in 1954. After a long run of small roles in second features, his 1955 portrayal of the registrar in Roy Boulting&#x27;s comedy &quot;Josephine and Men&quot;, &quot;jerked him out of the rut&quot;, according to Philip Oakes.

Following his appearance in &quot;Josephine and Men&quot;, John and Roy Boulting cast Le Mesurier as a psychiatrist in their 1956 Second World War film, &quot;Private&#x27;s Progress&quot;. The cast featured many leading British actors of the time, including Ian Carmichael and Richard Attenborough. Dilys Powell, reviewing for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, thought that the cast was &quot;embellished&quot; by Le Mesurier&#x27;s presence, among others. Later in 1956 Le Mesurier again appeared alongside Attenborough, with small roles in Jay Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Baby and the Battleship&quot; and Roy Boulting&#x27;s &quot;Brothers in Law&quot;, the latter of which also featured Carmichael and Terry-Thomas. He was also active in television, in a variety of roles in episodes of &quot;Douglas Fairbanks Presents&quot;, a series of short dramas.

Le Mesurier&#x27;s friendship with Tony Hancock provided a further source of work when Hancock asked him to be one of the regular supporting actors in &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;, when it moved from radio to television. Le Mesurier subsequently appeared in seven episodes of the show between 1957 and 1960, and then in an episode of a follow-up series entitled &quot;Hancock&quot;. In 1958 he appeared in ten films, among them Roy Boulting&#x27;s comedy &quot;Happy Is the Bride&quot;, about which Dilys Powell wrote in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;: &quot;[M]y vote for the most entertaining contributions ... goes to the two fathers, John Le Mesurier and Cecil Parker&quot;. In 1959, the busiest year of his career, Le Mesurier took part in 13 films, including &quot;I&#x27;m All Right Jack&quot;, which was the most successful of Le Mesurier&#x27;s credited films that year; he also had an uncredited role as a doctor in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;.

====1960–1968====
Le Mesurier appeared in nine films in 1960, as well as nine television programmes, including episodes of &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;, &quot;Saber of London&quot; and &quot;Danger Man&quot;. His work the following year included a part in Peter Sellers&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Mr. Topaze&quot;, a film which failed both critically and commercially. He provided the voice of Mr. Justice Byrne in a recording of excerpts from the transcript of &quot;R v Penguin Books Ltd.&quot;—the court case concerning the publication of D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;—which also featured Michael Hordern and Maurice Denham. J.W. Lambert, reviewing for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, wrote that Le Mesurier gave &quot;precisely the air of confident incredulity which the learned gentleman exhibited in court&quot;. Later that year he played Hancock&#x27;s office manager in the first of Tony Hancock&#x27;s two principal film vehicles, &quot;The Rebel&quot;.

In 1962 he appeared in Wendy Toye&#x27;s comedy film &quot;We Joined the Navy&quot; before reuniting with Peter Sellers in &quot;Only Two Can Play&quot;, Sidney Gilliat&#x27;s film of the novel &quot;That Uncertain Feeling&quot; by Kingsley Amis; Powell noted with pleasure &quot;the armour of his gravity pierced by polite bewilderment&quot;. She compared Le Mesurier with the well-known American straight-face comedian, John McGiver. After appearing in another Sellers film in 1962—&quot;Waltz of the Toreadors&quot;—Le Mesurier joined him in the 1963 comedy &quot;The Wrong Arm of the Law&quot;. Powell again reviewed the pair&#x27;s film, commenting that &quot;I thought I knew by now every shade in the acting of John Le Mesurier (not that I could ever get tired of any of them); but there seems a new shade here&quot;. The same year, he appeared in a third Sellers film, &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;, as a defence lawyer, and in the second and last of Tony Hancock&#x27;s starring vehicles, &quot;The Punch and Judy Man&quot;. Le Mesurier played Sandman in the latter film; Powell wrote that the role &quot;allowed a gentler and subtler character than usual&quot;. He also appeared in a series of advertisements for Homepride flour in 1964, providing the voice-over for the animated character Fred the Flourgrader; he continued as the voice until 1983.

In a change from his usual comedic roles, Le Mesurier portrayed the Reverend Jonathan Ives in Jacques Tourneur&#x27;s 1965 science fiction film, &quot;City Under the Sea&quot;, before returning to comedy in &quot;Where the Spies Are&quot;, a comedy-adventure film directed by Val Guest, which starred David Niven. In 1966 Le Mesurier also played the role of Colonel Maynard in the ITV sitcom &quot;George and the Dragon&quot;, with Sid James and Peggy Mount. The programme ran to four series between 1966 and 1968, totalling 26 episodes. He also took a role in four episodes of a &quot;Coronation Street&quot; spin-off series, &quot;Pardon the Expression&quot;, in which he starred opposite Arthur Lowe.

====1968–1977====
In 1968 Le Mesurier was offered a role in a new BBC situation comedy playing an upper-middle-class Sergeant Arthur Wilson in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;; he was the second choice after Robert Dorning. Le Mesurier was unsure about taking the part as he was finishing the final series of &quot;George and the Dragon&quot; and did not want another long-term television role. He was persuaded both by an increase in his fee – to £262 10s per episode – and by the casting of his old friend Clive Dunn as Corporal Jones. Le Mesurier was initially unsure of how to portray his character, and was advised by series writer Jimmy Perry to make the part his own. Le Mesurier decided to base the character on himself, later writing that &quot;I thought, why not just be myself, use an extension of my own personality and behave rather as I had done in the army? So I always left a button or two undone, and had the sleeve of my battle dress slightly turned up. I spoke softly, issued commands as if they were invitations (the sort not likely to be accepted) and generally assumed a benign air of helplessness&quot;. Perry later observed that &quot;we wanted Wilson to be the voice of sanity; he has become John&quot;.
Nicholas de Jongh, in a tribute written after Le Mesurier&#x27;s death, suggested that it was in the role of Wilson that Le Mesurier became a star. His interaction with Arthur Lowe&#x27;s character Captain George Mainwaring was described by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;a memorable part of one of television&#x27;s most popular shows&quot;. Tise Vahimagi, writing for the British Film Institute&#x27;s Screenonline, agreed, and commented that &quot;it was the hesitant exchanges of one-upmanship between Le Mesurier&#x27;s Wilson, a figure of delicate gentility, and Arthur Lowe&#x27;s pompous, middle class platoon leader Captain Mainwaring, that added to its finest moments&quot;. Le Mesurier enjoyed making the series, particularly the fortnight the cast would spend in Thetford each year filming the outside scenes. The programme lasted for nine series over nine years, and covered eighty episodes, ending in 1977.

During the filming of the series in 1969, Le Mesurier was flown to Venice over a series of weekends to appear in the film &quot;Midas Run&quot;, an Alf Kjellin-directed crime film that also starred Richard Crenna, Anne Heywood and Fred Astaire. Le Mesurier became friends with Astaire during the filming and they often dined together in a local cafe while watching horse-racing on television. In 1971 Norman Cohen directed a feature film of &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;; Le Mesurier also appeared as Wilson in a stage adaptation, which toured the UK in 1975–76. Following the success of &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, Le Mesurier recorded the single &quot;A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square&quot; with &quot;Hometown&quot; on the reverse side (the latter with Arthur Lowe). This, and an album, &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, featuring the whole cast, was released on the Warner label in 1975.

In between his performances in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, Le Mesurier acted in films, including the role of the prison governor opposite Noël Coward in the 1969 Peter Collinson-directed &quot;The Italian Job&quot;. The cinema historian Amy Sargeant likened Le Mesurier&#x27;s role to the &quot;mild demeanour&quot; of his Sergeant Wilson character. In 1970, Le Mesurier appeared in Ralph Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Doctor in Trouble&quot; as the purser; he also made an appearance in Vincente Minnelli&#x27;s &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot;, a romantic fantasy musical.

In 1971 Le Mesurier played the lead role in Dennis Potter&#x27;s television play &quot;Traitor&quot;, in which he portrayed a &quot;boozy British aristocrat who became a spy for the Soviets&quot;; his performance won him a British Academy of Film and Television Arts &quot;Best Television Actor&quot; award. Writing for the British Film Institute, Sergio Angelini considered &quot;Le Mesurier is utterly compelling throughout in an atypical role&quot;. Chris Dunkley, writing in &quot;The Times&quot;, described the performance as &quot;a superbly persuasive portrait, made vividly real by one of the best performances Mr Mesurier has ever given&quot;. The reviewer for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; agreed, saying that Le Mesurier, &quot;after a lifetime supporting other actors with the strength of a pit-prop, gets the main part; he looks, sounds and feels exactly right&quot;. Reviewing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Nancy Banks-Smith called the role &quot;his Hamlet&quot;, and said that it was worth waiting for. Although delighted to have won the award, Le Mesurier commented that the aftermath proved &quot;something of an anticlimax. No exciting offers of work came in&quot;.

Le Mesurier made a cameo appearance in Val Guest&#x27;s 1972 sex comedy &quot;Au Pair Girls&quot;, and starred alongside Warren Mitchell and Dandy Nichols in Bob Kellett&#x27;s &quot;The Alf Garnett Saga&quot;. In 1974 he played a police inspector in a similar Val Guest comedy, &quot;Confessions of a Window Cleaner&quot;, alongside Robin Askwith and Antony Booth. The following year he also narrated &quot;Bod&quot;, an animated children&#x27;s programme from the BBC; there were thirteen episodes in total.

====1977–1983====
In 1977 Le Mesurier portrayed Jacob Marley in a BBC television adaptation of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, which starred Michael Hordern as Ebenezer Scrooge; Sergio Angelini, writing for the British Film Institute about Le Mesurier&#x27;s portrayal, considered that &quot;although never frightening, he does exert a strong sense of melancholy, his every move and inflection seemingly tinged with regret and remorse&quot;. In 1979 he portrayed Sir Gawain in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Unidentified Flying Oddball&quot;, directed by Russ Mayberry, and co-starring Dennis Dugan, Jim Dale and Kenneth More. The film, an adaptation of Mark Twain&#x27;s novel &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot;, was hailed by &quot;Time Out&quot; as &quot;an intelligent film with a cohesive plot and an amusing script&quot; and cited it as &quot;one of the better Disney attempts to hop on the sci-fi bandwagon&quot;. The reviewers praised the cast, particularly Kenneth More&#x27;s Arthur and Le Mesurier&#x27;s Gawain, which they said were &quot;rather touchingly portrayed as friends who have grown old together&quot;.

Le Mesurier played The Wise Old Bird in the 1980 BBC Radio 4 series &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; and appeared on the same station as Bilbo Baggins in the 1981 radio version of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. In the spring of 1980 he took the role of David Bliss alongside Constance Cummings—as Judith Bliss—in a production of Noël Coward&#x27;s 1920s play &quot;Hay Fever&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Observer&quot;, Robert Cushman thought that Le Mesurier played the role with &quot;deeply grizzled torpor&quot;, while Michael Billington, reviewing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, saw him as a &quot;grey, gentle wisp of a man, full of half-completed gestures and seraphic smiles&quot;.

He took on the role of Father Mowbray in Granada Television&#x27;s 1981 adaptation of &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;. He guest-starred in episodes of the British comedy television series &quot;The Goodies&quot;, and in an early episode of &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot;. His final film appearance was also Peter Sellers&#x27;s final cinema role, &quot;The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu&quot;, which was completed just months before Sellers&#x27;s death in July 1980.

In 1982 Le Mesurier reprised the role of Arthur Wilson for &quot;It Sticks Out Half a Mile&quot;, a radio sequel to &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, in which Wilson had become the bank manager of the Frambourne-on-Sea branch, while Arthur Lowe&#x27;s character, Captain George Mainwaring, was trying to apply for a loan to renovate the local pier. The death of Lowe in April 1982 meant that only a pilot episode was recorded, and the project was suspended. It was revived later that year with Lowe&#x27;s role replaced by two other &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; cast members: Pike, played by Ian Lavender, and Hodges, played by Bill Pertwee. A pilot and twelve episodes were subsequently recorded, and broadcast in 1984. Le Mesurier also teamed up with another ex-&quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; colleague, Clive Dunn, to record a novelty single, &quot;There Ain&#x27;t Much Change from a Pound These Days&quot;/&quot;After All These Years&quot;, which had been written by Le Mesurier&#x27;s stepson, David Malin. The single was released on KA Records in 1982.

He appeared opposite Anthony Hopkins in a four-part television series, &quot;A Married Man&quot;, in March 1983, before undertaking the narration on the short film &quot;The Passionate Pilgrim&quot;, an Eric Morecambe vehicle, which was Morecambe&#x27;s last film before his death.

===Personal life===

In 1939, Le Mesurier accepted a role in the Robert Morley play &quot;Goodness, How Sad!&quot;, directed by June Melville—whose father Frederick owned several theatres, including the Lyceum, Prince&#x27;s and Brixton. Melville and Le Mesurier soon began a romance, and were married in April 1940. Le Mesurier was conscripted into the army in September 1940; after his demobilisation in 1946, he discovered that his wife had become an alcoholic: &quot;She became careless about appointments and haphazard professionally&quot;. As a result, the couple separated and were divorced in 1949.

In June 1947, Le Mesurier went with fellow actor Geoffrey Hibbert to the Players&#x27; Theatre in London, where among the performers was Hattie Jacques. Le Mesurier and Jacques began to see each other regularly; Le Mesurier was still married, albeit estranged from his wife. In 1949, when his divorce came through, Jacques proposed to Le Mesurier, asking him, &quot;Don&#x27;t you think it&#x27;s about time we got married?&quot; The couple married in November 1949 and had two sons, Robin and Kim.

Jacques began an affair in 1962 with her driver, John Schofield, who gave her the attention and support that Le Mesurier did not. When Jacques decided to move Schofield into the family home, Le Mesurier moved into a separate room and tried to repair the marriage. He later commented about this period: &quot;I could have walked out, but, whatever my feelings, I loved Hattie and the children and I was certain—I had to be certain—that we could repair the damage.&quot; The affair caused a downturn in his health; he collapsed on holiday in Tangier in 1963 and was hospitalised in Gibraltar. He returned to London to find the situation between his wife and her lover was unchanged, which caused a relapse.

During the final stages of the breakdown of his marriage, Le Mesurier met Joan Malin at the Establishment club in Soho in 1963. The following year he moved out of his marital house and that day proposed to Joan, who accepted his offer. Le Mesurier allowed Jacques to bring a divorce suit on grounds of his own infidelity, to ensure that the press blamed him for the break-up, thus avoiding any negative publicity for Jacques. Le Mesurier and Malin married in March 1966. A few months after they were married, Joan began a relationship with Tony Hancock and left Le Mesurier to move in with the comedian. Hancock was a self-confessed alcoholic by this time, and was verbally and physically abusive to Joan during their relationship.

After a year together, with Hancock&#x27;s violence towards her worsening, Joan attempted suicide; she subsequently realised that she could no longer live with Hancock and returned to her husband. Despite this, Le Mesurier remained friends with Hancock, calling him &quot;a comic of true genius, capable of great warmth and generosity, but a tormented and unhappy man&quot;. Without Le Mesurier&#x27;s knowledge, Joan resumed her affair with Hancock and, when the comic moved to Australia in 1968, she planned to follow him if he was able to overcome his alcoholism. She abandoned these plans and remained with Le Mesurier after Hancock committed suicide on 25 June 1968.
Le Mesurier was a heavy drinker but was never noticeably drunk. In 1977 he collapsed in Australia and flew home, where he was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and ordered to stop drinking. Until then he had not considered himself an alcoholic; he accepted that &quot;it was the cumulative effect over the years that had done the damage&quot;. It was a year and a half before he drank alcohol again, when he avoided spirits and drank only beer.

Jacques claimed that his calculated vagueness was the result of his dependence on cannabis, although according to Le Mesurier the drug was not to his taste; he smoked it only during his period of abstinence from alcohol. Le Mesurier&#x27;s favoured pastime was visiting the jazz clubs around Soho, such as Ronnie Scott&#x27;s, and he observed that &quot;listening to artists like Bill Evans, Oscar Peterson or Alan Clare always made life seem that little bit brighter&quot;.

Towards the end of his life Le Mesurier wrote his autobiography, &quot;A Jobbing Actor&quot;; the book was published in 1984, after his death. Le Mesurier&#x27;s health visibly declined from July 1983 when he was hospitalised for a short time after suffering a haemorrhage. When the condition recurred later in the year he was taken to Ramsgate Hospital; after saying to his wife, &quot;It&#x27;s all been rather lovely&quot;, he slipped into a coma and died on 15 November 1983, aged 71. His remains were cremated, and the ashes buried at the Church of St. George the Martyr, Church Hill, Ramsgate. His epitaph reads: &quot;John Le Mesurier. Much loved actor. Resting.&quot; His self-penned death notice in &quot;The Times&quot; of 16 November 1983 stated that he had &quot;conked out&quot; and that he &quot;sadly misses family and friends&quot;.

After Le Mesurier&#x27;s death fellow comedian Eric Sykes commented: &quot;I never heard a bad word said against him. He was one of the great of our time&quot;. Le Mesurier&#x27;s fellow &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; actor Bill Pertwee mourned the loss of his friend, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a shattering loss. He was a great professional, very quiet but with a lovely sense of humour&quot;. Director Peter Cotes, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, called him one of Britain&#x27;s &quot;most accomplished screen character actors&quot;, while &quot;The Times&quot; obituarist observed that he &quot;could lend distinction to the smallest part&quot;.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; reflected on Le Mesurier&#x27;s popularity, observing that &quot;No wonder so many whose lives were very different from his own came to be so enormously fond of him&quot;. A memorial service was held on 16 February 1984 at the &quot;Actors&#x27; Church&quot;, St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden, at which Bill Pertwee gave the eulogy.

==Approach to acting==
Le Mesurier took a relaxed approach to acting, saying, &quot;You know the way you get jobbing gardeners? Well, I&#x27;m a jobbing actor ... as long as they pay me I couldn&#x27;t care less if my name is billed above or below the title&quot;. Le Mesurier played a wide range of parts, and became known as &quot;an indispensable figure in the gallery of second-rank players which were the glory of the British film industry in its more prolific days&quot;. He felt his characterisations owed &quot;a lot to my customary expression of bewildered innocence&quot; and tried to stress for many of his roles that his parts were those of &quot;a decent chap all at sea in a chaotic world not of his own making&quot;.

Philip French of &quot;The Observer&quot; considered that when playing a representative of bureaucracy, Le Mesurier &quot;registered something ... complex. A feeling of exasperation, disturbance, anxiety [that] constantly lurked behind that handsome bloodhound face&quot;. The impression he gave in these roles became an &quot;inimitable brand of bewildered persistence under fire which Le Mesurier made his own&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; noted of him that although he was best known for his comedic roles, he, &quot;could be equally effective in straight parts&quot;, as evidenced by his BAFTA-award-winning role in &quot;Traitor&quot;. Director Peter Cotes agreed, adding, &quot;he had depths unrealised through the mechanical pieces in which he generally appeared&quot;; while Philip Oakes considered that, &quot;single-handed, he has made more films watchable, even absorbing, than anyone else around&quot;.

==Portrayals==
Le Mesurier&#x27;s second and third marriages have been the subject of two BBC Four biographical films, the 2008 &quot;Hancock and Joan&quot; on Joan Le Mesurier&#x27;s affair with Tony Hancock—with Le Mesurier played by Alex Jennings—and the 2011 &quot;Hattie&quot; on Jacques&#x27;s affair with John Schofield—with Le Mesurier played by Robert Bathurst. In &quot;We&#x27;re Doomed! The Dad&#x27;s Army Story&quot;, a 2015 comedy drama about the making of &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, Le Mesurier was portrayed by Julian Sands. Le Mesurier was portrayed by Anton Lesser in the BBC Radio 4 drama &quot;Dear Arthur, Love John&quot; on 7 May 2012.

<text>A parking meter is a device used to collect money in exchange for the right to park a vehicle in a particular place for a limited amount of time. Parking meters can be used by municipalities as a tool for enforcing their integrated on-street parking policy, usually related to their traffic and mobility management policies, but are also used for revenue.
==History==

An early patent for a parking meter, U.S. patent, was filed by Roger W. Babson, on August 30, 1928. The meter was intended to operate on power from the battery of the parking vehicle and required a connection from the car to the meter.

Holger George Thuesen and Gerald A. Hale designed the first working parking meter, the Black Maria, in 1935. The History Channel&#x27;s... &quot;History&#x27;s Lost and Found&quot; documents their success in developing the first working parking meter. Thuesen and Hale were engineering professors at Oklahoma State University. They began working on the parking meter in 1933 at the request of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma lawyer and newspaper publisher Carl C. Magee. The world&#x27;s first installed parking meter was in Oklahoma City on July 16, 1935. Magee received a patent for the apparatus on 24 May 1938.

Industrial production started in 1936 and expanded until the mid-1980s. The first models were based on a coin acceptor, a dial to engage the mechanism, and a visible pointer and flag to indicate the expiration of the paid period. This configuration lasted more than 40 years, with only a few changes in the exterior design, such as a double-headed design (to cover two adjacent parking spaces) and the incorporation of new materials and production techniques.

M.H. Rhodes Inc. of Hartford, Connecticut started making meters for Mark-Time Parking Meter Company of Miami, where the first Rhodes meters were installed in 1936. These were different from the Magee design because only the driver&#x27;s action of turning a handle was necessary to keep the spring wound. At the same time, Magee&#x27;s meters needed a serviceman to wind the spring occasionally.
Upon insertion of coins into a currency detector slot or swiping a credit card or smartcard into a slot, and turning a handle (or pressing a key), a timer is initiated within the meter. Some locations now allow payment by mobile phone (to remotely record payments for subsequent checking and enforcement). A dial or display on the meter indicates the time remaining. In many cities, all parking meters are designed to use only one type of coin. Use of other coins will fail to register, and the meter may cease to function altogether. For example, in Hackensack, New Jersey, all parking meters are designed for quarters only.

In 1960, New York City hired its first crew of &quot;meter maids&quot;; all were women. It was not until 1967 that the first man was hired.

In the mid-1980s, a digital version was introduced, replacing the mechanical parts with electronic components: boards, keyboards, and displays. This allowed the meter more flexibility, as an EEPROM chip can be reconfigured more easily than corresponding mechanical components.

By the beginning of the 1990s, millions of parking meter units had been sold worldwide. Still, the market was already looking into new solutions, like the collective pay and display machines and new forms of payment that appeared along with electronic money and communication technologies.

===Fully electrical===

More modern parking meters are generically called multi-space meters (as opposed to single-space meters) and control multiple spaces per block (typically 8-12) or lots (unlimited). While with these meters, the parker may have to walk several car lengths to the meter, there are significant customer service, performance, and efficiency benefits. Multispace meters incorporate more customer-friendly features such as on-screen instructions and acceptance of credit cards for payment—no longer do drivers have to have pockets full of coins. While they may still be prone to coin jams and other types of vandalism, most of these meters are wireless and can report problems immediately to maintenance staff, who can then fix the meters so they are not out of service for very long.

With pay-by-space meters, the driver parks in a space, goes to the meter, enters the space number, and makes payment. The meter memorizes the time remaining, and enforcement personnel press the bay buttons to check for violations.

Other advances in parking meters include vehicle detection technology, which allows the pay-by-space meters to know when a car is parked in a space. This opens the door for benefits for parking managers, including providing way-finding (directing drivers to unoccupied spaces via the web or street signs), enabling remote violation detection, and gathering vital statistics about parking supply and demand. Some meters allow payment for additional time by phone and notify drivers when they are about to expire. Parking meters in Santa Monica use vehicle detectors to prevent drivers from &quot;feeding the meter&quot; indefinitely, and to delete remaining time when a car departs so the next car cannot take any time without paying. Meters in Madrid give discounted and free parking to drivers of hybrid and electric vehicles, respectively. Drivers can reserve meters spots in Los Angeles by cellphone.

Another advancement with parking meters is the new solar-powered meters that accept credit cards and still coins.
Credit card enabled solar powered &quot;smart&quot; single-space meters were installed in Los Angeles in 2010, and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa stated &quot;the city&#x27;s Department of Transportation had projected the 10,000 Coin &amp; Card parking meters installed over the last six months would generate 1-1.5 million in revenue each year&quot;. These parking meters replace the top of the meter, but use the existing pole, and use solar power, which can help with sending technicians a wireless signal when in need for repair. DDOT (the District of Columbia Department of Transportation) states that this new parking meter will provide: &quot;better return on tax payer&#x27;s investment, a variety of options, reduced maintenance, a variety of easy payment options, and increased reliability&quot;.

New digital meters now account for all of New York City&#x27;s 62,000 single-space parking meters, which are more accurate and difficult to break into. New York City retired its last spring-loaded, single-space, mechanical parking meter at West 10th Street and Surf Avenue in Coney Island on December 20, 2006. &quot;The world changes. Just as the [subway] token went, now the manual meter has gone,&quot; said Iris Weinshall, the city&#x27;s transportation commissioner, at a small ceremony marking the occasion, the New York Times reported.
===Security issues===

Parking meters are exposed to the elements and vandals, so protection of the device and its cash contents is a priority. The meters are frequently targeted in areas where parking regulations and enforcement are widely perceived to be unfair and predatory.

Some cities have learned the hard way that these machines must be upgraded regularly, essentially playing an arms race with vandals. In Berkeley, California, the cut-off remains of meter poles were a common sight during the late 1990s, and parking was essentially free throughout the city until the city government installed digital parking meters with heavier poles in 2000 (which were eventually vandalized as well).

===Legality in the United States===
In a 1937 case in Oklahoma, H.E. Duncan contended that the ordinances impose a fee for the free use of the streets, which is a right of all citizens of the state granted by state law. The Courts ruled that free use of the streets is not an absolute right. Still, they agreed with an unpublished 1936 Florida court decision that said, &quot;If it had been shown that the streets on which parking meters have been installed under this ordinance are not streets where the traffic is sufficiently heavy to require any parking regulations of this sort, or that the city was making inordinate and unjustified profits using the parking meters, and was resorting to their use not for regulatory purposes but for revenue only, there might have been a different judgment.&quot;

One of the first parking meter tickets resulted in the first court challenge to metered parking enforcement. Rev. C.H. North of Oklahoma City&#x27;s Third Pentecostal Holiness Church had his citation dismissed when he claimed he had gone to a grocery store to get change for the meter.

The North Carolina Supreme Court judged that a city could not pledge on-street parking meter fee proceeds as security for bonds issued to build off-street parking decks. The court said, &quot;Streets of a municipality are provided for public use. A city board has no valid authority to rent, lease, or let a parking space on the streets be rented by an individual motorist &#x27;for a fee&#x27; or to charge a rate or toll. Much less may it lease or let the whole system of on-street parking meters for operation by a private corporation or individual.&quot;
A 2009 lawsuit filed by the Independent Voters of Illinois-Independent Precinct Organization claimed the City of Chicago&#x27;s 2008 concession agreement for the operation of its parking meters to a private company violated state law. In November 2010, portions of the suit were thrown out by the Cook County Circuit Court, including the claim that the city was using public funds unlawfully to enforce parking regulations after the presiding judge decided that the city retained its ability to write tickets and enforce parking laws. However, the judge allowed other parts of the suit to stand, including an accusation that the city unlawfully conceded some of its policing power and its ability to set parking and traffic policy to the private company in the concession agreement. As of January 2011, the suit remained active, with the City of Chicago maintaining that the city retains all policing power, maintains responsibility for traffic management, and, through the concession agreement, retains control over rates.

===Use in the United Kingdom===
Parking meters were first used in Britain in 1958. They were used in most towns and cities although from c. 1980s they have mostly been replaced by Pay and display, pay on foot and Pay-by-phone parking.

==Alternatives==
In the US states of Texas, Maryland, California, Massachusetts, Utah, Virginia, and the whole of the European Union, holders of a disabled parking permit are exempt from parking meter fees on public streets. In some states, handicapped parking meters exist, which must be paid at the same rate as regular meters. However, one will also receive a violation ticket if a valid handicapped license plate or placard is not displayed on the vehicle.

Some cities have gone to a device called a Parkulator, where the users purchase a display device, usually for $5 or $10, then load it with as much time as they care to buy. They then activate the device when they park at a location, and place the display device on their dashboard so it is visible from the front windshield. The device counts down the time remaining on the device while it remains activated. When they return, the clock stops running, and the person does not overpay for unused time. In the UK, parking and paying with a credit or debit card through a dedicated telephone service is now possible. Civil Enforcement Officers that patrol the parking area are automatically informed through their handheld devices.
An in-vehicle parking meter is a handheld electronic device, the size of a pocket calculator, that drivers display in their car windows as a parking permit or as proof of parking payment. Implementation of IVPM began in the late 1980s in Arlington, VA, and is spreading to campuses and municipalities worldwide as a centralized method of parking management, revenue collection, and compliance enforcement. Another technology offers the possibility of reloading money (parking time) to the device via a secure Internet site.

<text>Craig James Mundie (born July 1, 1949) is an American businessperson. In 1982, he co-founded Alliant Computer Systems, becoming CEO. He was later Senior Advisor to the CEO at Microsoft, after being Microsoft&#x27;s Chief Research and Strategy Officer from 2006 to 2012. He retired from Microsoft in 2014. During the Obama administration, he was a member of his President&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). 

==Biography==
Craig James Mundie was born on July 1, 1949 in Cleveland, Ohio. Mundie holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Electrical Engineering (1971) and a master&#x27;s degree in Information Theory and Computer Science (1972) from Georgia Tech. 

In 1970, Mundie began his career as an operating system developer for the Data General Nova computer at Systems Equipment Corporation. SEC was subsequently acquired by Data General Corporation, where Mundie later became director of its advanced development facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. In 1982, he co-founded Alliant Computer Systems, holding a variety of positions there before becoming CEO. Alliant filed for bankruptcy in 1992.

He started at Microsoft in the company&#x27;s consumer platforms division in 1992, managing the production of Windows CE for hand-held and automotive systems and early console games. In 1997, while at Microsoft Mundie oversaw the acquisition of WebTV Networks. He has championed Microsoft Trustworthy Computing and digital rights management. Starting in 2006, when Bill Gates retired full-time from Microsoft, Mundie and Ray Ozzie split Gates&#x27; former duties at the company, with Mundie becoming Microsoft&#x27;s Chief Research and Strategy Officer. In late 2012, he became Senior Advisor to the CEO, with plans to retire in 2014, at the age of 65.

In April, 2009, President Barack Obama named Mundie as a member of his President&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). Mundie attended all meetings of the Bilderberg Group between 2003 and 2019 (except in 2005). As of 2010 he was a member of the Steering Committee, which determines the invitation list and the agenda for the upcoming annual Bilderberg meetings.

<text>A payphone (alternative spelling: pay phone or pay telephone or public phone) is typically a coin-operated public telephone, often located in a telephone booth or in high-traffic public areas. Prepayment is required by inserting coins or telephone tokens, swiping a credit or debit card, or using a telephone card.

The company that operates the payphone generally pays either rent or a revenue share to the owner of the property where the phone is installed.

Invented in the late 19th century, payphones became ubiquitous worldwide in the 20th, enough to contribute to the notion of universal access to basic communication services. The charge for a call may be a flat rate, or dependent on call duration. Following the explosive growth of mobile telephony, the use of payphones, and the number installed, has decreased greatly.

==Countries==

===Canada===
Most payphones in Canada are owned and operated by large telecom providers such as Bell, Telus, and SaskTel. In the last 20 years, customer-owned coin-operated telephones (COCOT) have also appeared in the market, but their numbers are smaller due to the emergence of mobile phones.

The cost of most local payphone calls is 50 cents CAD, having increased from 25 cents since 2007. Payphones in Alberta were 35 cents for a time, but in most jurisdictions the price simply doubled. Newer phones allow users to use calling cards and credit cards. For coin-paid long distance, COCOTs are less expensive for short calls (typically $1 for three minutes) than incumbent providers (whose rates start near $5 for the first minute).

Dialing 0 for the operator and 911 calls are still free.

The Toronto Transit Commission deploys payphones on all subway platforms as a safety precaution; a blue &quot;Crisis Link&quot; button on 141 payphones connects directly with Distress Centres of Canada as a free suicide prevention measure.

As of 2013, there were about 70,000 payphones across the country.

In 2013, the CRTC issued a temporary moratorium on the removal of payphones in small communities.

In September 2015, the CRTC remarked that &quot;32 percent of Canadians used a payphone at least once in the past year,&quot; and that they are used &quot;as a last resort in times of inconvenience and emergency.&quot;

===Germany===
The payphone model 23, introduced at Deutsche Bundespost Telekom in 1992, is an electronic software-controlled payphone for analog connections. It is equipped with coin, (), and integrated test program setting. It has a remote maintenance – the independent reports of a background system by means of an integrated modem error (for example, defects in components, lack of listeners), operating states (for example, full coin box), or departures (for example standing open the cartridge mounting door, missing coin).

The Payphone 23 consists of two basic units, the equipment part including all the necessary for the operation modules (BG) and the secured below the growing payphone cassettes with the coin box.

===Italy===
In Italy, public payphones have been installed and maintained over the years by Telecom Italia (formerly SIP).

Many public telephones were removed in the early 2010s, but there are still several thousand in operation throughout Italy.

From 26 May 2023, following an AGCOM decision, TIM-Telecom Italia is no longer obliged to keep public telephones in service (but still has the option to do so). In hospitals, prisons, barracks and mountain refuges, the provision of public telephone services is in any case mandatory.

===Japan===
The majority of payphones on the street and in buildings in Japan are installed and maintained by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT).

===Russia===
In the Soviet period, different types of payphones were produced. There were also long-distance call payphones costing 15 kopeks, and also provided services of paid media such as listening to an anecdote, obtaining legal advice, or finding the address of the subscriber by phone number. After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the monetary reform of 1991, this form of payment became irrelevant. Some payphones were altered to accept tokens, while others have been designed to use telephone cards. For example, in St Petersburg, payment for payphones can be made with metro tokens. In some regions, calls from public phones are free of charge.

===Spain===
Telephones were a monopoly of the national government in Spain. Payphones took a slug or &quot;ficha&quot;, a piece of metal with two troughs in it, making it hard to counterfeit. Payphones were typically found in bars, restaurants, and stores, never freestanding. Phones would accept some five &quot;fichas&quot; at a time (the exact number varied depending on phone model), showing through a plastic window the number remaining, and return unused ones to the customer.

An older and simpler system was to use a mechanical counter, the &quot;marcador de pasos&quot;, which automatically counted units of time called &quot;pasos&quot;. The duration of each &quot;paso&quot; depended on the distance of the call, and its cost could vary by time of day. At the conclusion of a call a human attendant would collect the appropriate payment. This system survived in small hotels at least until the 1970s. Spain also had &quot;locutorios&quot; (&quot;speaking places&quot;), where a person could make and pay an attendant for phone calls. &quot;Locutorios&quot; diminished in the 21st century, as the country moved to direct distance dialing and mobile phones.

===United Kingdom===
The telephone service in Britain was run by the General Post Office (GPO), a state monopoly, which had taken over the National Telephone Company in 1912. Coin-operated payphones in Britain in about 1950 cost 2d (2 old pence) for a local call of unlimited duration. This eventually increased, and by about 1960 calls were timed, costing 3d for 3 minutes. Long-distance calls, connected by an operator, cost more. Telephones had a coin slot and two buttons, marked A and B. One or more coins had to be inserted and the number dialled. If answered, the call was enabled by pressing button A; if not answered, button B returned the coins. Payphones later changed and the old A/B button design was dropped; prices changed over time.

The telephone system was privatised in 1984, operated by British Telecom, still a monopoly. Phone cards were introduced for paying for calls. Payphones were later deregulated, no longer a BT monopoly. The great majority of them are still operated by British Telecom (BT) but other companies provide services, mostly in urban areas. Hull, Manchester, London, Cardiff and Glasgow, at the turn of the 21st century, have a greater concentration of non-BT payphones, since BT has been removing many payphones which are unprofitable. The use of payphones declined greatly in Britain, as everywhere, with the explosive growth of mobile telephones.

;Kiosk adoption
BT allows local communities to adopt the iconic Red K6 Kiosks due to strong opposition to their removal from the communities that the kiosks reside in. This will mean the removal of the phone, leaving the empty kiosk in-situ.

;Sponsored kiosk
Another option BT has provided is the sponsored kiosk, that will retain the phone service, and retain the kiosk for an annual fee of around £300 excluding VAT, whether it is the Red K6 or the newer aluminium and glass kiosks that cannot be adopted.

Payphone types

Due to disability discrimination law, specifically the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, in the past payphone providers were required to provide a certain number of textphone payphones as part of their network, as this was deemed a &quot;reasonable adjustment&quot; for deaf customers. These phones can also make voice calls, as well as send SMS and e-mail messages, and although this requirement is no longer in force due to minimal use of the textphone feature in these phones, many of these devices remain in service, generally in populated areas.

In addition, in the early 2000s BT installed a large number of &#x27;Multiphones&#x27; that provided internet access, on top of voice, SMS, and e-mail functionality. These payphones provided these services through the use of a 2-channel ISDN2 connection, a QNX-based operating system, and a touchscreen interface to allow the user to browse websites and receive e-mail messages on a pay-per-minute basis. However, these devices have since been removed due to quickly becoming obsolete, often with the ordinary payphone previously installed in that location taking its place once again.

;Cost

From 1 June 2010, BT payphones have a £0.60 minimum charge which is for the first 30 minutes of any direct-dialled national geographic call. Previously the minimum charge was £0.40 for the first 20 minutes of any direct-dialled national geographic call. Then before November 2006 the minimum charge was £0.30, before 2004 it was £0.20 and before 2000 it was £0.10. Credit/debit cards can also be used, and many BT payphones have card readers for this service; however, calls made using a card are charged at a significantly higher rate than calls made using cash.

BT Phonecards purchased from participating retailers were introduced in 1981, and could be used in most BT payphones to pay for calls. Cards originally used an optical system to register credit, changed to a chip-based system in the 1990s, and were withdrawn in 2003.

In the past, a BT Chargecard could be used from any UK landline to charge any telephone calls made to the cardholder&#x27;s BT home telephone account, with no charge to the landline the card was being used from. These were most commonly used in payphones, and some BT payphones had dedicated readers for these cards. This service was discontinued in 2018. Other cards which are often used instead include supermarket international calling cards and many other telephone cards which can be bought from newsagents.

Although 0800 and 0808 numbers are free to the caller when dialled from most payphones, the owner of the number called must pay a &#x27;Payphone Access Charge&#x27; (PAC) which has increased significantly in recent years, and is currently £0.79 per minute if their number is called from a payphone. This has led to many businesses, and even calling card providers, barring calls to their freephone numbers originating from payphones. Charity helplines are exempt from this charge if called from a BT payphone, however this exemption does not apply to calls made from payphones owned by other providers, and in these cases the charity must pay the PAC.

;Cost examples (from BT coin-operated payphones)

There is a £0.40 connection charge, in addition to the &quot;per minute&quot; charges shown below, and a minimum charge of £0.60. Some payphones also offer SMS and e-mail service, both charged at £0.20 per message.
===United States===
&quot;Dead-heads&quot;--non-subscriber users who make a call at a place of business and do not pay for it--may have influenced the development of the payphone. The Wisconsin Telephone Company in 1893, for example, attempted to put an end to this practice by implementing ten-cent coin slots so that users had to pay for the call. The idea behind this was to reduce the financial stress a smaller business may face from having dead-heads.

Payphones were preceded by pay stations, staffed by telephone company attendants who would collect rapid payment for calls placed. The Connecticut Telephone Co. reportedly had a payphone in their New Haven office beginning 1 June 1880; the fee was handed to an attendant. In 1889, a public telephone with a coin-pay mechanism was installed at the Hartford Bank in Hartford, Connecticut, by the Southern New England Telephone Co. It was a &quot;post-pay&quot; machine; coins were inserted at the end of a conversation. The coin mechanism was invented by William Gray; he was issued a series of patents for his devices, beginning with issued 23 June 1891 for a &quot;Signal Device for Telephone Pay-Stations&quot; which rang a bell for each coin inserted. He subsequently founded the Telephone Pay Station Co. in 1891. The &quot;pre-pay&quot; phone debuted in Chicago in 1898.

In the late 1920s, the cost of a payphone call in the United States was two cents. In the 1930s, calls were five cents; the cost of a typical local call had risen to 10 cents by the 1960s, 15 cents during the 1970s, then 25 cents in the 1980s. By the early 21st century, the price of a local call was usually fifty cents. The rise of mobile phones led to the near extinction of payphones by the early 21st century. New York City, which once had 30,000, removed its last public payphone in 2022.

The Bell System payphone took nickels (5¢), dimes (10¢), and quarters (25¢); a strip of metal along the top had holes the size of each coin. The US slang term &quot;&quot; means to inform the authorities about another person, originally by placing a call from a pay phone. It can also refer to the placing of a phone call for social purposes. The term has risen in popularity in the US since the 1980s, and is still in use since 2000, despite the price increase of pay phones and the rise of mobile phones.

Payphone calls generally cost 5¢ into the 1950s and 10¢ until the mid-1980s. Rates standardized at 25¢ during the mid-1980s to early 1990s. The Bell System was required to apply for increases through state public service commissions. Therefore, the actual increases took effect at different times in different locations. The small town of Beggs, Oklahoma attracted national attention in the late 1970s when public payphones offering calls for only five cents had been essentially phased out across the country, but Beggs still had one. As of 2020, Beggs still has a nickel payphone, maintained in front of the Beggs Telephone Company office.

After the breakup of the Bell System in 1984, it was not long before independent stores selling telephones opened up. After that, privately owned payphones hit the market. Sources differ as to whether the peak number of payphones in the United States was 2.6 million in 1995 or 2.2 million in 2000. Since then the number of payphones in the United States has declined. In July 2009, AT&amp;T officially stopped supporting the Public Payphone service. Over 139,000 locations were sold in 2009. At the end of 2012, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reported the number of payphones at 243,487 generating $362 million – falling to $286 million by 2015. The major carriers, AT&amp;T and Verizon, exited the business, leaving the market to independent payphone companies. In 2018, it was estimated 100,000 payphones remained in the U.S., with roughly a fifth of them located in New York. Four years later, NYC removed its last public one, though some private pay phones remained on public property, and four full-length booths still stood in the Upper West Side in May 2022.

<text>American Movie is a 1999 American documentary film directed by Chris Smith, produced by Smith and Sarah Price, and edited by Jun Diaz and Barry Poltermann.

Filmed between September 1995 and August 1997, &quot;American Movie&quot; documents the making of &quot;Coven&quot;, an independent short horror film directed by Mark Borchardt. Produced for the purpose of raising capital for &quot;Northwestern&quot;, a feature film Borchardt intends to make, &quot;Coven&quot; suffers from numerous setbacks, including poor financing, a lack of planning, Borchardt&#x27;s alcoholism, and the ineptitude of the friends and family he enlists as his production team. The documentary follows Borchardt&#x27;s filmmaking process, interspersed with footage from both of Borchardt&#x27;s developing projects.

&quot;American Movie&quot; received positive reviews and won the Grand Jury Prize for Documentary at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival. It has since become a cult film.

==Synopsis==
Mark Borchardt of Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, dreams of being a professional filmmaker. Currently, however, he delivers newspapers for a living, is deeply in debt, still lives with his parents, suffers from alcoholism, and is estranged from his ex-girlfriend, who is threatening to move out of state with their three children due in part to his inability to pay child support. He acknowledges his various failures, but aspires to one day make more of his life.

Hoping to jump-start his career, Mark restarts production on &quot;Northwestern&quot;, a feature film he has been planning for most of his adult life. &quot;Northwestern&quot; attracts some interest from the group of amateur actors with whom Mark has produced some radio plays, but by the fourth production meeting almost no one shows up and Mark is forced to acknowledge that he currently lacks the resources to continue the project.

In order to attract the attention and financial resources needed to produce &quot;Northwestern&quot;, Mark decides to complete &quot;Coven&quot; (which he mispronounces with a long &#x27;o&#x27;), a horror short that he began shooting in 1994 but ultimately abandoned. He receives financing from his uncle Bill, an increasingly senile retiree who lives in a dilapidated trailer despite having $280,000 in his bank account. Bill hesitantly agrees to invest in &quot;Coven&quot; with the goal of selling three thousand VHS copies, which Mark says will raise enough capital to finance &quot;Northwestern&quot;.

Although Mark is hard-working and knowledgeable about filmmaking, he is also poor at planning ahead and inarticulate as a director. He builds his production crew out of friends, family, and neighbors, many of whom are incompetent at their assigned tasks. Particular attention is given to his best friend Mike Schank, an amiable recovering alcoholic and drug addict who is one of the most reliable members of the crew. Mark and Mike bonded over their shared love of vodka as adolescents, but Mike is now sober and has joined Alcoholics Anonymous, though he has become a compulsive gambler; he reasons that, while you sometimes win and sometimes lose the lottery, &quot;when you use drugs or alcohol...you always lose.&quot;

As work on &quot;Coven&quot; continues, Mark faces the skepticism of his family and his deepening alcoholism, though he does eventually wrap principal photography. At Thanksgiving dinner and later at a Super Bowl XXXI watch party, he gets drunk and becomes alternately agitated, cheery, and despondent. He wistfully watches footage he had shot for &quot;Northwestern&quot; in 1990 and contemplates whether or not he is a failure.

After an extended post-production process, during which Mark occasionally sleeps in an editing room at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, &quot;Coven&quot; is finally finished minutes before its premiere at a theater in Milwaukee in the summer of 1997. The screening sells out, and Mark&#x27;s family and friends are happy that the project has finally been completed.

Mark visits Uncle Bill and discusses the prospect of future fame and wealth and realizing the American Dream. The closing text reveals that Bill died on September 13, 1997, leaving Mark $50,000 towards completing &quot;Northwestern&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==
On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 94% based on 49 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.28/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Well worth watching for film buffs and anyone who believes in following your dreams, &quot;American Movie&quot; is a warm, funny, and engrossing ode to creative passion&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film conveys Borchardt&#x27;s passion &quot;Insightfully and stirringly, not to mention hilariously&quot;, and that &quot;for anyone wondering where the spirit of maverick independent filmmaking has its source, you need look no further&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four possible stars, calling it &quot;a very funny, sometimes very sad documentary&quot;.

Amy Goodman of IndieWire called the film &quot;an inspiration for filmmakers everywhere&quot;, and Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that it &quot;is sure to draw lots of laughs&quot;. Glenn Lovell of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film an &quot;ambitious, wildly funny chronicle&quot; and a &quot;madcap tribute to a beer-guzzling Midwestern filmmaker&quot;.

===Awards===
The film was awarded the Grand Jury Prize for Documentary at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival. The International Documentary Association named it as one of the top twenty documentaries of all time in 2002. In 2004, it was named by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as one of the &quot;1,000 Greatest Movies Ever Made&quot;.

==Home media==
&quot;American Movie&quot; was released on DVD by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on May 23, 2000, as a &quot;Special Edition&quot; including deleted scenes, &quot;Coven&quot; itself, and a commentary track by Chris Smith, Sarah Price, Borchardt, and Schank. It was also released on VHS on January 16, 2001. After being out of print for years, it was released on Blu-ray on October 18, 2022. It was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu Ray on October 15, 2024, which also contained a standard Blu Ray of the film.

<doc id="163389" wikidata="Q1415650" url="?curid=163389" title="Diamond dust">
<text>Diamond dust is a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. This meteorological phenomenon is also referred to simply as &quot;ice crystals&quot; and is reported in the METAR code as IC. Diamond dust generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so it is sometimes referred to as clear-sky precipitation. Diamond dust is most commonly observed in Antarctica and the Arctic, but can occur anywhere with a temperature well below freezing. In the polar regions of Earth, diamond dust may persist for several days without interruption.

==Characteristics==

Diamond dust is similar to fog in that it is a cloud based at the surface; however, it differs from fog in two main ways. Generally fog refers to a cloud composed of liquid water (the term ice fog usually refers to a fog that formed as liquid water and then froze, and frequently seems to occur in valleys with airborne pollution such as Fairbanks, Alaska, while diamond dust forms directly as ice). Also, fog is a dense-enough cloud to significantly reduce visibility, while diamond dust is usually very thin and may not have any effect on visibility (there are far fewer crystals in a volume of air than there are droplets in the same volume with fog). Because mist is often classified to be more transparent than fog, diamond dust has often been referred to as ice mist. However, diamond dust still can often reduce the visibility, in some cases to under .

The depth of the diamond dust layer can vary substantially from as little as to . Because diamond dust does not always reduce visibility it is often first noticed by the brief flashes caused when the tiny crystals, tumbling through the air, reflect sunlight to the eye. This glittering effect gives the phenomenon its name since it looks like many tiny diamonds are flashing in the air.

==Formation==

These ice crystals usually form when a temperature inversion is present at the surface and the warmer air above the ground mixes with the colder air near the surface. Since warmer air frequently contains more water vapor than colder air, this mixing will usually also transport water vapor into the air near the surface, causing the relative humidity of the near-surface air to increase. If the relative humidity increase near the surface is large enough then ice crystals may form.

To form diamond dust the temperature must be below the freezing point of water, , or the ice cannot form or would melt. However, diamond dust is not often observed at temperatures near . At temperatures between and about increasing the relative humidity can cause either fog or diamond dust. This is because very small droplets of water can remain liquid well below the freezing point, a state known as supercooled water. In areas with a lot of small particles in the air, from human pollution or natural sources like dust, the water droplets are likely to be able to freeze at a temperature around , but in very clean areas, where there are no particles (ice nuclei) to help the droplets freeze, they can remain liquid to , at which point even very tiny, pure water droplets will freeze. In the interior of Antarctica diamond dust is fairly common at temperatures below about .

Artificial diamond dust can form from snow machines which blow ice crystals into the air. These are found at ski resorts. Diamond dust may also be observed immediately downwind from manufacturing facilities or chilled water plants that produce steam.

==Optical properties==

Diamond dust is often associated with halos, such as sun dogs, light pillars, etc. Like the ice crystals in cirrus or cirrostratus clouds, diamond dust crystals form directly as simple hexagonal ice crystals — as opposed to freezing drops — and generally form slowly. This combination results in crystals with well defined shapes - usually either hexagonal plates or columns - which, like a prism, can reflect and/or refract light in specific directions.

==Climatology==
While diamond dust can be seen in any area of the world that has cold winters, it is most frequent in the interior of Antarctica, where it is common year-round. Schwerdtfeger (1970) shows that diamond dust was observed on average 316 days a year at Plateau Station in Antarctica, and Radok and Lile (1977) estimate that over 70% of the precipitation that fell at Plateau Station in 1967 fell in the form of diamond dust. Once melted, the total precipitation for the year was only .

==Weather reporting and interference==
Diamond dust may sometimes cause a problem for automated airport weather stations. The ceilometer and visibility sensor do not always correctly interpret the falling diamond dust and report the visibility and ceiling as zero (overcast skies). However, a human observer would correctly notice clear skies and unrestricted visibility. The METAR identifier for diamond dust within international hourly weather reports is IC.

<doc id="163390" wikidata="Q205555" url="?curid=163390" title="Feeling">
<text>According to the &quot;APA Dictionary of Psychology&quot;, a feeling is &quot;a self-contained phenomenal experience&quot;; feelings are &quot;subjective, evaluative, and independent of the sensations, thoughts, or images evoking them&quot;. The term &quot;feeling&quot; is closely related to, but not the same as, emotion. &quot;Feeling&quot; may, for instance, refer to the conscious subjective experience of emotions. The study of subjective experiences is called &quot;phenomenology&quot;. Psychotherapy generally involves a therapist helping a client understand, articulate, and learn to effectively regulate the client&#x27;s own feelings, and ultimately to take responsibility for the client&#x27;s experience of the world. Feelings are sometimes held to be characteristic of embodied consciousness.

The English noun &quot;feelings&quot; may generally refer to any degree of subjectivity in perception or sensation. However, feelings often refer to an individual sense of well-being (perhaps of wholeness, safety, or being loved). Feelings have a semantic field extending from the individual and spiritual to the social and political. The word &quot;feeling&quot; may refer to any of a number of psychological characteristics of experience, or even to reflect the entire inner life of the individual (see Mood.) As self-contained phenomenal experiences, evoked by sensations and perceptions, feelings can strongly influence the character of a person&#x27;s subjective reality. Feelings can sometimes harbor bias or otherwise distort veridical perception, in particular through projection, wishful thinking, among many other such effects.

Feeling may also describe the senses, such as the physical sensation of touch.

== History ==
The modern conception of affect developed in the 19th century with Wilhelm Wundt. The word comes from the German &quot;Gefühl&quot;, meaning &quot;feeling.&quot;

A number of experiments have been conducted in the study of social and psychological affective preferences (i.e., what people like or dislike). Specific research has been done on preferences, attitudes, impression formation, and decision-making. This research contrasts findings with recognition memory (old-new judgments), allowing researchers to demonstrate reliable distinctions between the two. Affect-based judgments and cognitive processes have been examined with noted differences indicated. Some argue affect and cognition are under the control of separate and partially independent systems that can influence each other in a variety of ways (Zajonc, 1980). Both affect and cognition may constitute independent sources of effects within systems of information processing. Others suggest emotion is a result of an anticipated, experienced, or imagined outcome of an adaptational transaction between organism and environment, therefore cognitive appraisal processes are keys to the development and expression of an emotion (Lazarus, 1982).

== Emotions (in relation to feelings) ==
=== Difference between feeling and emotion ===
The neuroscientist Antonio Damasio distinguishes between emotions and feelings: Emotions are mental images (i.e. representing either internal or external states of reality) and the bodily changes accompanying them, whereas feelings are the perception of bodily changes. In other words, emotions contain a subjective element and a 3rd person observable element, whereas feelings are subjective and private. In general usage, the terms emotion and feelings are used as synonyms or interchangeable, but actually, they are not. The feeling is a conscious experience created after the physical sensation or emotional experience, whereas emotions are felt through emotional experience. They are manifested in the unconscious mind and can be associated with thoughts, desires, and actions.

==Sensations==
Sensation occurs when sense organs collect various stimuli (such as a sound or smell) for transduction, meaning transformation into a form that can be understood by the nervous system.

=== Interoception ===
====Gut====


A gut feeling, or gut reaction, is a visceral emotional reaction to something. It may be negative, such as a feeling of uneasiness, or positive, such as a feeling of trust. Gut feelings are generally regarded as not modulated by conscious thought, but sometimes as a feature of intuition rather than rationality. The idea that emotions are experienced in the gut has a long historical legacy, and many nineteenth-century doctors considered the origins of mental illness to derive from the intestines.

The phrase &quot;gut feeling&quot; may also be used as a shorthand term for an individual&#x27;s &quot;common sense&quot; perception of what is considered &quot;the right thing to do&quot;, such as helping an injured passerby, avoiding dark alleys and generally acting in accordance with instinctive feelings about a given situation. It can also refer to simple common knowledge phrases which are true no matter when said, such as &quot;Fire is hot&quot;, or to ideas that an individual intuitively regards as true (see &quot;truthiness&quot; for examples).

====Heart====

The heart has a collection of ganglia that is called the &quot;intrinsic cardiac nervous system&quot;. The feelings of affiliation, love, attachment, anger, hurt are usually associated with the heart, especially the feeling of love.

== Needs ==
A need is something required to sustain a healthy life (e.g. air, water, food). A (need) deficiency causes a clear adverse outcome: a dysfunction or death. Abraham H. Maslow, pointed out that satisfying (i.e., gratification of) a need, is just as important as deprivation (i.e., motivation to satisfy), for it releases the focus of the satisfied need, to other emergent needs

=== Motivation ===
Motivation is what explains why people or animals initiate, continue or terminate a certain behavior at a particular time. Motivational states are commonly understood as forces acting within the agent that create a disposition to engage in goal-directed behavior. It is often held that different mental states compete with each other and that only the strongest state determines behavior.

=== Valence ===

Valence tells organisms (e.g., humans) how well or how bad an organism is doing (in relation to the environment), for meeting the organism&#x27;s needs.

== Perception ==
=== Feelings of certainty ===

The way that we see other people express their emotions or feelings determines how we respond. The way an individual responds to a situation is based on feeling rules. If an individual is uninformed about a situation the way they respond would be in a completely different demeanor than if they were informed about a situation. For example, if a tragic event had occurred and they had knowledge of it, their response would be sympathetic to that situation. If they had no knowledge of the situation, then their response may be indifference. A lack of knowledge or information about an event can shape the way an individual sees things and the way they respond.

Timothy D. Wilson, a psychology professor, tested this theory of the feeling of uncertainty along with his colleague Yoav Bar-Anan, a social psychologist. Wilson and Bar-Anan found that the more uncertain or unclear an individual is about a situation, the more invested they are. Since an individual does not know the background or the ending of a story they are constantly replaying an event in their mind which is causing them to have mixed feelings of happiness, sadness, excitement, and et cetera. If there is any difference between feelings and emotions, the feeling of uncertainty is less sure than the emotion of ambivalence: the former is precarious, the latter is not yet acted upon or decided upon.

The neurologist Robert Burton, writes in his book &quot;On Being Certain&quot;, that feelings of certainty may stem from involuntary mental sensations, much like emotions or perceptual recognition (another example might be the tip of the tongue phenomenon).

Individuals in society want to know every detail about something in hopes to maximize the feeling for that moment, but Wilson found that feeling uncertain can lead to something being more enjoyable because it has a sense of mystery. In fact, the feeling of not knowing can lead them to constantly think and feel about what could have been.

=== Sense of agency &amp; sense of ownership ===
== Feelings about feelings ==

Individuals in society predict that something will give them a certain desired outcome or feeling. Indulging in what one might have thought would&#x27;ve made them happy or excited might only cause a temporary thrill, or it might result in the opposite of what was expected and wanted. Events and experiences are done and relived to satisfy one&#x27;s feelings.

Details and information about the past are used to make decisions, as past experiences of feelings tend to influence current decision-making, how people will feel in the future, and if they want to feel that way again. Gilbert and Wilson conducted a study to show how pleased a person would feel if they purchased flowers for themselves for no specific reason (birthday, anniversary, or promotion etc.) and how long they thought that feeling would last. People who had no experience of purchasing flowers for themselves and those who had experienced buying flowers for themselves were tested. Results showed that those who had purchased flowers in the past for themselves felt happier and that feeling lasted longer for them than for a person who had never experienced purchasing flowers for themselves.

Arlie Russell Hochschild, a sociologist, depicted two accounts of emotion. The organismic emotion is the outburst of emotions and feelings. In organismic emotion, emotions/feelings are instantly expressed. Social and other factors do not influence how the emotion is perceived, so these factors have no control on how or if the emotion is suppressed or expressed.

In interactive emotion, emotions and feelings are controlled. The individual is constantly considering how to react or what to suppress. In interactive emotion, unlike in organismic emotion, the individual is aware of their decision on how they feel and how they show it.

Erving Goffman, a sociologist and writer, compared how actors withheld their emotions to the everyday individual. Like actors, individuals can control how emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through. Individuals want to conform to society with their inner and outer feelings.

Anger, happiness, joy, stress, and excitement are some of the feelings that can be experienced in life. In response to these emotions, our bodies react as well. For example, nervousness can lead to the sensation of having &quot;knots in the stomach&quot; or &quot;butterflies in the stomach&quot;.

=== Self-harm ===

Negative feelings can lead to harm. When an individual is dealing with an overwhelming amount of stress and problems in their lives, there is the possibility that they might consider self-harm. When one is in a good state of feeling, they never want it to end; conversely, when someone is in a bad state of mind, they want that feeling to disappear. Inflicting harm or pain to oneself is sometimes the answer for many individuals because they want something to keep their mind off the real problem. These individuals cut, stab, and starve themselves in an effort to feel something other than what they currently feel, as they believe the pain to be not as bad as their actual problem. Distraction is not the only reason why many individuals choose to inflict self-harm. Some people inflict self-harm to punish themselves for feeling a certain way. Other psychological factors could be low self-esteem, the need to be perfect, social anxiety, and so much more.

<text>The Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, known in Islamic history as the Battle of Al-Uqab (), took place on 16 July 1212 and was an important turning point in the &quot;Reconquista&quot; and the medieval history of Spain. The Christian forces of King Alfonso VIII of Castile, were joined by the armies of his rivals, Sancho VII of Navarre and Peter II of Aragon, in battle against the Almohad Muslim rulers of the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula. The caliph al-Nasir (&quot;Miramamolín&quot; in the Spanish chronicles) led the Almohad army, made up of people from all over the Almohad Caliphate.

Navas de Tolosa (also called Las Navas) is a town and hamlet in southern Spain, in the municipality of La Carolina, in the province of Jaén, in the eastern part of the Sierra Morena region, from the border with the province of Ciudad Real.

==Background==
In 1195, the Almohads defeated Alfonso VIII of Castile in the Battle of Alarcos. After this victory, the Kingdom of León and the Kingdom of Navarre made an alliance with the Almohads and attacked Castile, starting the Castilian–Leonese War. During those years, Yaqub al-Mansur attacked several important cities: Toledo, Trujillo, Plasencia, Talavera, Cuenca, Guadalajara, Madrid, Uclés and others. However, he signed a ten-year truce with Alfonso VIII in 1197.

In 1211, Muhammad al-Nasir crossed the Strait of Gibraltar with a powerful army, invaded Christian territory, and captured the Salvatierra Castle, the stronghold of the knights of the Order of Calatrava. The threat to the Hispanic Christian kingdoms was so great that Pope Innocent III called Christian knights to a crusade.

== Previous movements ==
There were some disagreements among the members of the Christian coalition; notably, French and other European knights did not agree with Alfonso&#x27;s merciful treatment of Jews and Muslims who had been defeated in the conquest of Malagón and Calatrava la Vieja. Previously, they had caused problems in Toledo (where the different armies of the Crusade gathered), with assaults and murders in the Jewish Quarter.

==Battle==
Alfonso crossed the mountain range that defended the Almohad camp, sneaking through the Despeñaperros Pass, led by Martín Alhaja, a local shepherd who knew the area. On 16 July 1212, the Christian coalition caught the encamped Moorish army by surprise, and Alhaja was granted the hereditary title &quot;Cabeza de Vaca&quot; for his assistance to Alfonso VIII.
The battle was fought at relatively close range, so that neither the Almohads nor the Spaniards could use archers in the melee-dominated fight. Spanish knights became locked in close-quarter combat, in which they were superior to the Almohads.

Some of the Spanish knights, namely the Order of Santiago, eventually broke the Almohad line of defense decisively as they inflicted heavy casualties on the Almohads and established a breakthrough with gaps appearing in the enemy lines. This led to a possible spearhead. King Sancho VII then led his mounted knights through the gaps, exploiting them, and charged at the Caliph&#x27;s tent.

The Caliph had surrounded his tent with a bodyguard of black slave-warriors. Though it was once claimed that these men were chained together to prevent flight, it is considered more likely that this results from a mistranslation of the word &quot;serried&quot;, meaning a densely packed formation. The Navarrese force led by their king Sancho VII broke through this bodyguard. The Caliph escaped, but the Moors were routed, leaving heavy casualties on the battlefield. The victorious Christians seized several prizes of war; Muhammad al-Nasir&#x27;s tent and standard were delivered to Pope Innocent III.

Christian losses were far fewer, only about 2,000 men (though not so few as legend had it). The losses were particularly notable among the Orders: those killed included Pedro Gómez de Acevedo (bannerman of the Order of Calatrava), Alvaro Fernández de Valladares (&quot;comendator&quot; of the Order of Santiago), Pedro Arias (master of the Order of Santiago, died of wounds on 3 August), and Gomes Ramires (Portuguese master of the Knights Templar and simultaneously master of Leon, Castile, and Portugal); Ruy Díaz (master of the Order of Calatrava) was so grievously wounded that he had to resign his command.

Muhammad al-Nasir did not overcome the defeat of this battle: he went to Marrakesh and locked himself in his palace until his death a year later.

==Aftermath==
The crushing defeat of the Almohads significantly hastened their decline both in the Iberian Peninsula and in the Maghreb a decade later. That gave further impulse to the Christian Reconquest and sharply reduced the already declining power of the Moors in Iberia. Shortly after the battle, the Castilians took Baeza and then conquered Úbeda, major fortified cities near the battlefield and gateways to invade Andalusia. According to a letter from Alfonso VIII of Castile to Pope Innocent III, Baeza was evacuated and its people moved to Úbeda; Alfonso laid siege, killing 60,000 Muslims and enslaving many more. According to the &quot;Latin Chronicle of Kings of Castile&quot; the number given is almost 100,000 Saracens, including children and women, who were captured.

Thereafter, Alfonso VIII&#x27;s grandson Ferdinand III of Castile took Córdoba in 1236, Jaén in 1246, and Seville in 1248; then he took Arcos, Medina-Sidonia, Jerez, and Cádiz. In 1252, Ferdinand was preparing his fleet and army for invasion of the Almohad lands in Africa, but he died in Seville on 30 May 1252, during an outbreak of plague in southern Hispania;
only his death prevented the Castilians from taking the war to the Almohad on the Mediterranean coast. James I of Aragon conquered the Balearic Islands (from 1228 to 1232) and Valencia (the city capitulated on 28 September 1238).

By 1252 the Almohad empire was almost finished, at the mercy of another emerging Berber power. In 1269 a new association of Berber tribes, the Marinids, took control of present-day Morocco. Later, the Marinids tried to recover the former Almohad territories in Iberia, but they were definitively defeated by Alfonso XI of Castile and Afonso IV of Portugal in the Battle of Río Salado, the last major military encounter between large Christian and Muslim armies in Hispania. So, the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa seems to have been a true turning point in the history of the region, including the western Mediterranean sea.

===Moorish Granada===
In 1292 Sancho IV took Tarifa, key to the control of the Strait of Gibraltar. Granada, Almería, and Málaga were the only major Muslim cities remaining in the Iberian peninsula. These three cities were the core of the Emirate of Granada, ruled by the Nasrid dynasty. Granada was a vassal state of Castile, until finally taken by the Catholic Monarchs in 1492.

===In fiction===
Harry Harrison&#x27;s 1972 alternate history/science fiction novel &quot;Tunnel Through the Deeps&quot; depicts a history where the Moors won at Las Navas de Tolosa and retained part of Spain into the 20th century.
S.J.A Turney describes the battle in his historic novel &quot;The Crescent and the Cross&quot;.

<text>Traffic lights, traffic signals, or stoplights – also known as robots in South Africa, Zambia, and Namibia – are signaling devices positioned at road intersections, pedestrian crossings, and other locations in order to control the flow of traffic.

Traffic lights normally consist of three signals, transmitting meaningful information to road users through colours and symbols, including arrows and bicycles. The regular traffic light colours are red to stop traffic, amber for traffic change, and green for allowing the traffic, arranged vertically or horizontally in that order. Although this is internationally standardised, variations in traffic light sequences and laws exist on national and local scales.

Traffic lights were first introduced in December 1868 on Parliament Square in London to reduce the need for police officers to control traffic. Since then, electricity and computerised control have advanced traffic light technology and increased intersection capacity. The system is also used for other purposes, including the control of pedestrian movements, variable lane control (such as tidal flow systems or smart motorways), and railway level crossings.

== History ==

In December 1868, the first system of traffic signals, which was a semaphore traffic signal, was installed as a way to replace police officer control of vehicular traffic outside the Houses of Parliament in London. This system exploded on 2 January 1869 and was taken down. This early traffic signal led to other parts of the world implementing similar traffic signal systems. In the first two decades of the 20th century, semaphore traffic signals like the one in London were in use all over the United States. These traffic signals were controlled by a traffic officer who changed the commands on the signal to direct traffic.

In 1912, the first electric traffic light was developed by Lester Wire, a policeman in Salt Lake City, Utah. In August 1914, it was installed by the American Traffic Signal Company on the corner of East 105th Street and Euclid Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1920, the first four-way, three-colour traffic light was created by William Potts in Detroit, Michigan . His design was the first to include an amber &#x27;caution&#x27; light along with red and green lights. Potts was Superintendent of Signals for the Police Department of Detroit. In 1921, he installed automatic four-way, three-colour traffic lights in 15 towers across Detroit. 

By 1922, traffic towers were beginning to be controlled by automatic timers more widely. The main advantage of the use of the timer was that it saved cities money by replacing traffic officers. New York City was able to reassign all but 500 of its 6,000 officers working on the traffic squad, saving the city $12,500,000.

In 1923, Garrett Morgan patented a design of a manually operated three-way traffic light with moving arms.

The control of traffic lights changed with the rise of computers in America in the 1950s. One of the best historical examples of computerized control of lights was in Denver in 1952. In 1967, Toronto was the first to use more advanced computers that were better at vehicle detection. The computers maintained control over 159 signals in Toronto through telephone lines.

==Vehicular signals==
 A set of lights, known as a signal head, may have one, two, three, or more aspects. The most common signal type has three aspects facing the oncoming traffic: red on top, amber (yellow) below, and green below that. Additional aspects may be fitted to the signal, usually to indicate specific restrictions or filter movements.

=== Meanings of signals ===
The 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals Chapter III provides international standards for the setup of traffic signal operations. Not all states have ratified the convention. A three-colour signal head should have three non-flashing lights which are red, amber, and green, either arranged horizontally (on the side opposite to the direction of traffic) or vertically (with red on top). A two-colour signal head may be used in temporary operation and consists of red and green non-flashing lights. In both cases, all lights should be circular or arrow-shaped. Permissible signals for regulating vehicle traffic (other than public transport vehicles) are outlined in Article 23:

Green arrows are added to signals to indicate that drivers can travel in a particular direction, while the main lights for that approach are red, or that drivers can only travel in one particular direction. Alternatively, when combined with another green signal, they may indicate that turning traffic has priority over oncoming traffic (known as a &quot;filter arrow&quot;). Flashing amber arrows typically indicate that road users must give way (to other drivers and pedestrians) before making a movement in the direction of the arrow. These are used because they are safer, cause less delay, and are more flexible. Flashing amber arrows will normally be located below the solid amber.

==== Green arrows ====
Arrow aspects may be used to permit certain movements or convey other messages to road users. A green arrow may display to require drivers to turn in a particular direction only or to allow drivers to continue in a particular direction when the signal is red. Generally, a green phase is illuminated at the beginning of the green phase (a &quot;leading turn&quot;) or at the end of the green phase (a &quot;lagging turn&quot;). An &#x27;indicative arrow&#x27; may be displayed alongside a green light. This indicates to drivers that oncoming traffic is stopped, such that they do not need to give way to that traffic when turning across it. As right-turning traffic (left-side drive) or left-turning traffic (right-side drive) does not normally have priority, this arrow is used to allow turning traffic to clear before the next phase begins.

Some variations of this setup exist. One version is a horizontal bar with five lights – the green and amber arrows are located between the standard green and amber lights. A vertical five-light bar holds the arrows underneath the standard green light. In this arrangement, the amber arrow is sometimes omitted, leaving only the green arrow below the steady green light, or possibly an LED-based device capable of showing both green and amber arrows within a single lamp housing. 

A third type is known as a &quot;doghouse&quot; or &quot;cluster head&quot; – a vertical column with the two normal lights is on the right side of the signal, a vertical column with the two arrows is located on the left, and the normal red signal is in the middle above the two columns. Cluster signals in Australia and New Zealand use six signals, the sixth being a red arrow that can operate separately from the standard red light. In a fourth type, sometimes seen at intersections in Ontario and Quebec, Canada, there is no dedicated left-turn lamp per se.

Instead, the normal green lamp flashes rapidly, indicating permission to go straight as well as make a left turn in front of opposing traffic, which is being held by a steady red lamp. This &quot;advance green&quot;, or flashing green can be somewhat startling and confusing to drivers not familiar with this system. This can cause confusion amongst visitors to British Columbia, where a flashing green signal denotes a pedestrian-controlled crosswalk. For this reason, Ontario is phasing out the use of flashing green signals and instead replacing them with arrows.

==== Countdown lights ====
Popular in Vietnam and China, countdown lights are additional lights installed next to, or above or below, the main signal lights. The countdown light is displayed by a countdown number with different colors, usually red, yellow, green, matching the color of the light on. When the light counts to &quot;0&quot; (or 1), the main light color immediately changes. 

Countdown lights may have zeros in the tens or none, some countdown lights may flash when getting ready to zero. Yellow lights can have countdown lights, but most lights do not. Usually the countdown light has 2 digits, in case the time of the main light (usually the red light, rarely the green light) is longer than 100 seconds, depending on the type of light, the following possibilities may occur:

# Lights have not counted down, when 99 seconds are left, start counting. During the standby time, the light may be displayed as &quot;99&quot;, &quot;00&quot;, &quot;--&quot; or not displayed.
# Last 2 digits count light of the timeout (the counter light is 15 while the time is 115 seconds, there are some types of lights that count as &quot;-9&quot; or &quot;9-&quot; when the time is 109 seconds)
# Tens digit on the displayer becomes a letter. Displaying A0 for 100 seconds, B0 for 110 seconds, so forth.
# Displaying only last 2 digits but with flashing to indicate it&#x27;s more than 100.
==== Issue about yellow light dilemma zone in South Korea ====
In South Korea, the yellow light dilemma zone is not legally recognized. In other words, when the yellow light is on, traffic may not pass the stop line or enter the intersection, even if cannot safely stop when the light shows.

In May 2024, this was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court of Korea , for a case where the driver was speeding at 62 km/h in a street limited up to 40 km/h, % higher than the allowed speed.

Criticism in South Korea says that this is unrealistic and unreasonable. This can cause multiple collisions due to sudden braking.

In 2016, when speed limit was up to 60 km/h, proposed alternatives to this kind of collision were only roundabouts, speed compliance increase and speed practice reduction or elderly zones are also proposed solutions.

=== Yellow trap ===
Without an all-red phase, cross-turning traffic may be caught in a yellow trap. When the signal turns yellow, a turning driver may assume oncoming traffic will stop and a crash may result. For this reason, the US bans sequences that may cause a yellow trap. This can also happen when emergency vehicles or railroads preempt normal signal operation.
 In the United States, signs reading &quot;Oncoming traffic has extended green&quot; or &quot;Oncoming traffic may have extended green&quot; must be posted at intersections where the &quot;yellow trap&quot; condition exists.

===Variations===
The United States is not party to the Vienna Convention; rather, the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) outlines correct operation in that country. In the US, a single signal head may have three, four, or five aspects. A single aspect green arrow may be displayed to indicate a continuous movement. The signals must be arranged red, amber, and green vertically (top to bottom) or horizontally (left to right). In the US, a single-aspect flashing amber signal can be used to raise attention to a warning sign and a single-aspect flashing red signal can be used to raise attention to a &quot;stop&quot;, &quot;do not enter&quot;, or &quot;wrong way&quot; sign. Flashing red or amber lights, known as &quot;intersection control beacons&quot;, are used to reinforce stop signs at intersections. The MUTCD specifies the following vehicular signals:

In the Canadian province of Quebec and the Maritime provinces, lights are often arranged horizontally, but each aspect is a different shape: red is a square (larger than the normal circle) and usually in pairs at either end of the fixture, amber is a diamond, and green is a circle. In many southern and southwestern U.S. states, most traffic signals are similarly horizontal in order to ease wind resistance during storms and hurricanes. 

Japanese traffic signals mostly follow the same rule except that the green &quot;go&quot; signals are referred to as 青 (ao), typically translated as &quot;blue&quot;, reflecting a historical change in the Japanese language. As a result, Japanese officials decreed in 1973 that the &quot;go&quot; light should be changed to the bluest possible shade of green, bringing the name more in line with the color without violating the international &quot;green means go&quot; rule.

In the UK, normal traffic lights follow this sequence:
* Red – Stop, do not proceed.
* Red and amber – Get ready to proceed, but do not proceed yet.
* Green – Proceed if the intersection or crossing is clear; vehicles are not allowed to block the intersection or crossing.
* Amber – Stop, unless it is unsafe to do so.
A speed sign is a special traffic light, variable traffic sign, or variable-message sign giving drivers a recommended speed to approach the next traffic light in its green phase and avoid a stop due to reaching the intersection when lights are red.

==Pedestrian signals==
Pedestrian signals are used to inform pedestrians when to cross a road. Most pedestrian signal heads will have two lights: a &#x27;walk&#x27; light (normally a walking human figure, typically coloured green or white) and a &#x27;don&#x27;t walk&#x27; light (normally either a red or orange man figure or a hand), though other variations exist.


Where pedestrians need to cross the road between junctions, a signal-controlled crossing may be provided as an alternative to a zebra crossing or uncontrolled crossing. Traffic lights are normally used at crossings where vehicle speeds are high, where either vehicle or pedestrian flows are high or near signalised junctions. In the UK, this type of crossing is called a pelican crossing. More modern iterations are puffin and pedex crossings. In the UK, these crossings normally need at least four traffic signals, which are of a regular type (red, amber, and green), two facing in each direction. Pedestrians are provided with push buttons and pedestrian signals, consisting of a red and green man. Farside signals are located across the crossing, while nearside signals are located below the traffic lights, facing in the direction of oncoming traffic. 

A HAWK beacon is a special type of traffic used in the US at mid-block crossings. These consist of two red signals above a single amber signal. The beacon is unlit until a pedestrian pushes the cross button. Then an amber light will show, followed by both red lights, at which point the &#x27;Walk&#x27; symbol will illuminate for pedestrians. At the end of the crossing phase, the &#x27;Don&#x27;t Walk&#x27; symbol will flash, as will the amber traffic light.
Pedestrians are usually incorporated into urban signalised junctions in one of four ways: no facilities, parallel walk, walk with traffic, or all-red stages. No facilities may be provided if pedestrian demand is low, in areas where pedestrians are not permitted, or if there is a subway or overpass. No provision of formal facilities means pedestrians will have to self-evaluate when it is safe to cross, which can be intimidating for pedestrians. 

With a &quot;parallel walk&quot; design, pedestrians walk alongside the traffic flow. A leading pedestrian interval may be provided, whereby pedestrians get a &quot;walk&quot; signal before the traffic gets a green light, allowing pedestrians to establish themselves on the crossing before vehicles begin to turn, to encourage drivers to give way. 

A &#x27;walk with traffic&#x27; facility allows pedestrians to go at the same time as other traffic movements with no conflict between movements. This can work well on one-way roads, where turning movements are banned or where the straight-ahead movement runs in a different stage from the turning movement. A splitter island could also be provided. Traffic will pass on either side of the island and pedestrians can cross the road safely between the other flows.

An all-red stage, also known as a full pedestrian stage, a pedestrian scramble or a Barnes Dance, holds all vehicular traffic at the junction to allow pedestrians time to safely cross without conflict from vehicles. It allows allows the use of diagonal crossings. This may require a longer cycle time and increase pedestrian wait periods, though the latter can be eased by providing two pedestrian stages.
Pedestrian countdown timers are becoming common at urban signal-controlled crossings. Where a pedestrian countdown is shown, it is normally used in conjunction with the flashing hand signal (in the US and Canada) or blackout period (UK), showing the amount of time remaining in seconds until the end of the flashing hand or blackout. Pedestrian countdown timers do not significantly increase or reduce the number of red- and amber-light running drivers. Studies have found that pedestrian countdown timers do significantly improve pedestrian compliance over traditional pedestrian signals; however, results are mixed.

===Smartphone Zombie ribbon===
As 12 to 45% of pedestrian deaths caused by &#x27;pedestrian distraction&#x27; have been linked to cell phone usage, some cities (including Sydney, Seoul, Augsburg, Bodegraven, Tel Aviv, and Singapore) have installed LED strips embedded in the sidewalk before crosswalks to warn distracted pedestrians of immanent pedestrian crossings. This additional signal, which is synchronized with conventional signals, aims to decrease injury rates by telling distracted pedestrians when it is safe to cross the road without them having to lift their head.
===Auditory and tactile signals===
In some jurisdictions such as Australia, pedestrian lights are associated with a sound device, for the benefit of blind and visually impaired pedestrians. These make a slow beeping sound when the pedestrian lights are red and a continuous buzzing or fast beeping sound when the lights are green. In the Australian States of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia, the sound is produced in the same unit as the push buttons. In a circle above the button, the sound is produced and can be felt along with a raised arrow that points in the direction to walk. 

This system of assistive technology is also widely used at busy intersections in Canadian cities. In the United Kingdom, the Puffin crossings and their predecessor, the Pelican crossing, will make a fast beeping sound to indicate that it is safe to cross the road. The beeping sound is disabled during the nighttime so as not to disturb any nearby residents. 

In some states in the United States, at some busy intersections, buttons will make a beeping sound for blind people. When the light changes, a speaker built into the button will play a recording to notify blind people that it is safe to cross. When the signal flashes red, the recording will start to count down with the countdown timer. In several countries such as New Zealand, technology also allows deaf and blind people to feel when lights have changed to allow safe crossing. A small pad, housed within an indentation in the base of the box housing the button mechanism, moves downwards when the lights change to allow crossing. This is designed to be felt by anyone waiting to cross who has limited ability to detect sight or sound. 

In Japan, a traffic light emits an electronic sound that mimics the sound of birdsong to help the visually impaired. Some traffic lights fix the order and type of sound so that they can tell which direction is a green light. In general, &quot;&quot;Piyo&quot; (peep) and &quot;Piyo-piyo&quot;, which is a small bird call, and &quot;Kakkō&quot; and &quot;Ka-kakkō&quot;&quot;, which is a cuckoo call, are associated with this system. Some pedestrian crossings in Lithuania make a slow beeping sound indicating that the traffic light is about to turn off.

== Cycle signals ==

Where cycle lanes or cycle tracks exist on the approach to a signal-controlled junction, it must be considered how to incorporate cyclists safely into the junction to reduce conflict between motor vehicles and cyclists.

An advanced stop line can be placed after the stop line at traffic lights. This allows cyclists to position themselves in front of traffic at a red light and get a headstart.

In the US, design advice typically advises that the cycle lane should continue through the junction to the left of the right-turn lane; however, this creates conflict where motor vehicles wish to enter the right lane, as they must cross the cycle lane at a bad angle.

Under Dutch engineering principles, cyclists are instead kept to the right of the junction, with protected kerbs. This improves safety by putting cyclists into the eyeline of motor vehicles at the stop line, allowing cyclists a headstart over turning traffic. This design also allows cyclists to complete far-side turns without having to wait in the centre of the junction. UK engineers have innovated on this design through the Cycle Optimised Protected Signals (CYCLOPS) junction, e.g. in Manchester. This places the cycle track around the edge of the signal junction and gives cyclists and pedestrians a single all-red phase, entirely separate from motor traffic and shortens pedestrian crossing times.

Alternatively, cyclists can be considered pedestrians on approach to a junction, or where a cycle track crosses a road and combined pedestrian-cyclist traffic lights (known as Toucan crossings in the UK) can be provided.

== Public transport signals ==
Traffic lights for public transport often use signals that are distinct from those for private traffic. They can be letters, arrows or bars of white or (an LED 100-watt typical) coloured light.

=== Transit signals in North America ===

MUTCD specifies a standard vertically oriented signal with either two or three lenses, displaying white lines on a black background.

Some systems use the letter B for buses and T for trams. The METRO light rail system in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the Valley Metro Rail in Phoenix, Arizona. The RTA Streetcar System in New Orleans use a simplified variant of the Belgian/French system in the respective city&#x27;s central business district where only the &quot;go&quot; and &quot;stop&quot; configurations are used. A third signal equal to amber is accomplished by flashing the &quot;go&quot; signal.

=== Public transport signals in Europe ===
In some European countries and Russia, dedicated traffic signals for public transport (tram, as well any that is using a dedicated lane) four white lights that form the letter T. If the three top lamps are lit, this means &quot;stop&quot;. If the bottom lamp and some lamps on the top row are lit, this means permission to go in a direction shown. In the case of a tram signal, if there are no tram junctions or turns at an intersection, a simpler system of one amber signal in the form of the letter T is used instead; the tram must proceed only when the signal is lit.

In North European countries, the tram signals feature white lights of different forms: &quot;S&quot; for &quot;stop&quot;, &quot;—&quot; for &quot;caution&quot; and arrows to permit passage in a given direction. In Sweden, All signals use white lighting and special symbols (&quot;S&quot;, &quot;–&quot; and an arrow) to distinguish them from regular signals.
The Netherlands uses a distinctive &quot;negenoog&quot; (nine-eyed) design shown on the top row of the diagram. Bottom row signals are used in Belgium, Luxembourg, France, and Germany. The signals mean (from left to right): &quot;go straight ahead&quot;, &quot;go left&quot;, &quot;go right&quot;, &quot;go in any direction&quot; (like the &quot;green&quot; of a normal traffic light), &quot;stop, unless the emergency brake is needed&quot; (equal to &quot;amber&quot;), and &quot;stop&quot; (equal to &quot;red&quot;).

=== Public transport signals in the Asia-Pacific region ===

In Japan, tram signals are under the regular vehicle signal; however, the colour of the signal intended for trams is orange(&quot;yellow&quot;). The small light at the top tells the driver when the vehicle&#x27;s transponder signal is received by the traffic light. In Hong Kong, an amber T-signal is used for trams, in place of the green signal. At any tramway junction, another set of signals is available to indicate the direction of the tracks. In Australia and New Zealand, a white &quot;B&quot; or &quot;T&quot; sometimes replaces the green light indicating that buses or trams (respectively) have right of way.

=== Preemption and priority ===
Some regions have signals that are interruptible, giving priority to special traffic, usually emergency vehicles such as firefighting apparatus, ambulances, and police cars. Most of the systems operate with small transmitters that send radio waves, infrared signals, or strobe light signals that are received by a sensor on or near the traffic lights. Some systems use audio detection, where a certain type of siren must be used and detected by a receiver on the traffic light structure.

Upon activation, the normal traffic light cycle is suspended and replaced by the &quot;preemption sequence&quot;: the traffic lights to all approaches to the intersection are switched to &quot;red&quot; with the exception of the light for the vehicle that has triggered the preemption sequence. Sometimes, an additional signal light is placed nearby to indicate to the preempting vehicle that the preempting sequence has been activated and to warn other motorists of the approach of an emergency vehicle. The normal traffic light cycle resumes after the sensor has been passed by the vehicle that triggered the preemption.

In lieu of preemptive mechanisms, in most jurisdictions, emergency vehicles are not required to respect traffic lights. Emergency vehicles must slow down, proceed cautiously and activate their emergency lights to alert oncoming drivers to the preemption when crossing an intersection against the light.

Unlike preemption, which immediately interrupts a signal&#x27;s normal operation to serve the preempting vehicle and is usually reserved for emergency use, &quot;priority&quot; is a set of strategies intended to reduce delay for specific vehicles, especially mass transit vehicles such as buses. A variety of strategies exist to give priority to transit but they all generally work by detecting approaching transit vehicles and making small adjustments to the signal timing. These adjustments are designed to either decrease the likelihood that the transit vehicle will arrive during a red interval or decrease the length of the red interval for those vehicles that are stopped. Priority does not guarantee that transit vehicles always get a green light the instant they arrive as preemption does.

== Operation ==
A variety of different control systems are used to operate signal cycles smoothly, ranging from simple clockwork mechanisms to sophisticated computerised control systems. Computerised systems are normally actuated, i.e. controlled by loop detectors or other sensors on junction approaches. Area-wide coordination can allow green wave systems to be set up for vehicles or cycle tracks. Smart traffic light systems combine traditional actuation, a wider array of sensors and artificial intelligence to further improve performance of signal systems. A traffic signal junction or crossing is typically controlled by a controller mounted inside a cabinet nearby.

&quot;Phases&quot; (or &quot;signal groups&quot; in Australia and New Zealand) are indications show simultaneously, e.g. multiple green lights which control the same traffic approach. A &quot;movement&quot; is any path through the junction which vehicles or pedestrians are permitted to take, which is &quot;conflicting&quot; if these paths cross one another. A stage (or &quot;phase&quot; in ANZ) is a group of non-conflicting phases which move at the same time. The stages are collectively known as a &quot;cycle&quot;. 

The time between two conflicting green phases is called an &quot;intergreen period&quot;, which is set at an appropriate length for the junction to safely clear, especially for turning traffic which may be waiting in the centre of the junction. This often results in an all red stage, when all approaches are shown a red light and no vehicle can proceed. This all red is sometimes extended to allow a pedestrian scramble, where pedestrians can cross the empty junction in any direction all at once. Some signals have no &quot;all red&quot; phase: the light turns green for cross traffic the instant the other light turns red.

Many traffic light installations are fitted with vehicle actuation, i.e. detection, to improve the flexibility of traffic systems to respond to varying traffic flows. Detectors come in the form of digital sensors fitted to the signal heads or induction loops within the road surface. Induction loops are beneficial due to their smaller chance of breakdown, but their simplicity can limit their ability to handle some situations, particularly involving lighter vehicles such as motorcycles or pedal cycles. This situation most often occurs at times of day when other traffic is sparse as well as when the small vehicle is coming from a direction that does not have a high volume of traffic.

=== Timing ===
The timing of the intergreen is usually based on the size of the intersection, which can range from two to five seconds. Modelling programs include the ability to calculate intergreen times automatically. Intergreen periods are determined by calculating the path distance for every conflict point in the junction, which is the distance travelled to the conflict point by the movement losing right of way minus the distance travelled to the same conflict point by the movement gaining right of way using the possible conflict points (including with pedestrians) and calculating both the time it would take the last vehicle to clear the furthest collision point and the first vehicle from the next stage to arrive at the conflict point. At actuated junctions, integreens can be varied to account for traffic conditions.

Engineers also need to set the amber timings (and red–amber, where appropriate), which is normally standardised by a traffic authority. For example, in the UK, the amber time is fixed nationally at three seconds and the red–amber time at two seconds, which results in a minimum intergreen time of five seconds (plus any all-red time). The US also uses a minimum of three seconds, but local traffic authorities can make timings longer, especially on wider, suburban roads. This variation has resulted in controversy when municipalities with shorter amber times use red light cameras. Where pedestrian signals are used, the timing of the &quot;inivitation to cross&quot; – the period where a steady walk signal shows – and clearance periods – time when the walk signal flashes or no signal is shown – need to be calculated. This is normally set against a design speed, e.g. . Similarly, these can be made extendable using sensors, allowing slower-moving pedestrians more time to cross the street.

=== Design guidance ===

National or sub-national highway authorities often issue guidance documents on the specification of traffic signals and design of signalised intersections according to national or local regulations. For example, in the United States the Federal Highway Administration issues the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and the &quot;Signalized Intersections Information Guide&quot;, which is a synthesis of best practices and treatments to help practitioners make informed decisions.

== Variable lane control ==


Variable lane control is a form of intelligent transportation systems which involve the use of lane-use control signals, typically on a gantry above a carriageway. These lights are used in tidal flow systems to allow or forbid traffic to use one or more of the available lanes by the use of green lights or arrows (to permit) or by red lights or crosses (to prohibit). Variable lane control may be in use at toll plazas to indicate open or closed booths; during heavy traffic to facilitate merging traffic from a slip road.

In the US, most notably the Southeastern, there often is a &quot;continuous-flow&quot; lane. This lane is protected by a single, constant-green arrow pointing down at the lane(s) permitting the continuous flow of traffic, without regard to the condition of signals for other lanes or cross streets. Continuous lanes are restricted in that vehicles turning from a side street may not cross over the double white line to enter the continuous lane. No lane changes are permitted to the continuous lane from an adjacent lane or from the continuous lane to an adjacent lane, until the double white line has been passed. Some continuous lanes are protected by a raised curb located between the continuous lane and a normal traffic lane, with white and/or amber reflective paint or tape, prohibiting turning or adjacent traffic from entering the lane.

Continuous-flow traffic lanes are found only at &quot;T&quot; intersections where there is no side street or driveway entrance on the right side of the main thoroughfare. No pedestrians are permitted to cross the main thoroughfare at intersections with a continuous-flow lane, although crossing at the side street may be permitted. 

Intersections with continuous-flow lanes will be posted with a white regulatory sign approximately before the intersection with the phrase, &quot;right lane continuous traffic,&quot; or other, similar, wording. If the arrow is extinguished for any reason, whether by malfunction or design, traffic through the continuous lane will revert to the normal traffic pattern for adjacent lanes, except that turning or moving into or out of the restricted lane is still prohibited.

== Waterways and railways ==
The three-aspect standard is also used at locks on the Upper Mississippi River. Red means that another vessel is passing through. Amber means that the lock chamber is being emptied or filled to match the level of the approaching vessel. After the gate opens, green means that the vessel may enter.

Railroad signals, for stopping trains in their own right of way, generally use the opposite positioning of the colours; that is, for signals above the driver&#x27;s eyeline, green on top and red below is the standard placement of the signal colours on railroad tracks. There are three reasons for this variation: there is no risk that railway signals will be masked by a tall vehicle between the driver and the signal; train speeds in fog are much higher than for road vehicles, so it is important that the most restrictive signal is closest to the driver&#x27;s eyeline; and with railway signals often in exposed rural locations, there is a risk of any signal other than the bottom one being masked by snow building up on the hood of the signal below.

== Rules ==
Traffic lights control flows of traffic using social norms and legal rules. In most jurisdictions, it is against the law to disobey traffic signals and the police, or devices such as red light cameras, can issue fines or other penalties – and in some cases prosecute – drivers who break those laws. US-based studies have found that the majority of drivers think that it is dangerous to run a red light at speed and the most common reason for red light running include inattentive driving, following an oversized vehicle or during inclement weather.

The rules governing traffic light junctions for vehicles differ by jurisdiction. For example, it is common in North America that drivers can turn kerb-to-kerb (i.e. turning right at most junctions), even when a red light shows. This turn on red rule is uncommon in Europe, unless an arrow signal or traffic sign specifically permits it.

== Design ==

=== Bulbs ===
Conventional traffic signal lighting, still common in some areas, uses a standard light bulb. The light then bounces off a mirrored glass or polished aluminium reflector bowl, and out through a polycarbonate plastic or glass signal lens. In some signals, these lenses were cut to include a specific refracting pattern. Traditionally, incandescent and halogen bulbs were used. Because of the low efficiency of light output and a single point of failure (filament burnout), some traffic authorities are choosing to retrofit traffic signals with LED arrays that consume less power, have increased light output, and last significantly longer. 

In the event of an individual LED failure, the aspect will still operate albeit with a reduced light output. The light pattern of an LED array can be comparable to the pattern of an incandescent or halogen bulb fitted with a prismatic lens.

The low energy consumption of LED lights can pose a driving risk in some areas during winter. Unlike incandescent and halogen bulbs, which generally get hot enough to melt away any snow that may settle on individual lights, LED displays – using only a fraction of the energy – remain too cool for this to happen. As a response to the safety concerns, a heating element on the lens was developed.

=== Programmable visibility signals ===
Signals such as the 3M High Visibility Signal utilize light-diffusing optics and a Fresnel lens to create the signal indication. The light from a 150 W PAR46 sealed-beam lamp in these &quot;programmable visibility&quot; signals passes through a set of two glass lenses at the back of the signal. The first lens, a frosted glass diffusing lens, diffuses the light into a uniform ball of light around five inches in diameter. The light then passes through a nearly identical lens known as an optical limiter (3M&#x27;s definition of the lens itself), also known as a &quot;programming lens&quot;, also five inches in diameter.

Using a special aluminium foil-based adhesive tape, these signals are &quot;masked&quot; or programmed by the programming lens so that only certain lanes of traffic will view the indication. At the front of these programmable visibility signals is a 12&quot; Fresnel lens, each lens tinted to meet United States Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) chromaticity and luminance standards. The Fresnel lens collimates the light output created by the lamp and creates a uniform display of light for the lane in which it is intended.

In addition to being positioned and mounted for desired visibility for their respective traffic, some traffic lights are also aimed, louvered, or shaded to minimize misinterpretation from other lanes. For example, a Fresnel lens on an adjacent through-lane signal may be aimed to prevent left-turning traffic from anticipating its own green arrow. Intelight Inc. manufactures a programmable traffic signal that uses a software-controlled LED array and electronics to steer the light beam toward the desired approach. 

The signal is programmed unlike the 3M and McCain models. It requires a connection to a laptop or smartphone with the manufacturer&#x27;s software installed. Connections can be made directly with a direct-serial interface kit, or wirelessly with a radio kit over WIFI to the signal. In addition to aiming, Fresnel lenses, and louvers, visors and back panels are also useful in areas where sunlight would diminish the contrast and visibility of a signal face. Typical applications for these signals were skewed intersections, specific multi-lane control, left-turn pocket signals, or other areas where complex traffic situations existed.

=== Size ===
In the United States, traffic lights are currently designed with lights approximately in diameter. Previously the standard had been ; however, those are slowly being phased out in favour of the larger and more visible 12 inch lights. Variations used have also included a hybrid design, which had one or more 12 inch lights along with one or more lights of on the same light.

In the United Kingdom, 12-inch lights were implemented only with Mellor Design Signal heads designed by David Mellor. These were designed for symbolic optics to compensate for the light loss caused by the symbol. Following a study sponsored by the UK Highways Agency and completed by Aston University, Birmingham, UK, an enhanced optical design was introduced in the mid-1990s. 

Criticism of sunlight &quot;washout&quot; (cannot see the illuminated signal due to sunlight falling on it), and &quot;sun-phantom&quot; (signal appearing to be illuminated even when not due to sunlight reflecting from the parabolic mirror at low sun angles), led to the design of a signal that used lenslets to focus light from a traditional incandescent bulb through apertures in a matt black front mask. This cured both problems in an easily manufactured solution. This design proved successful and was taken into production by a number of traffic signal manufacturers through the engineering designs of Dr. Mark Aston, working firstly at the SIRA Ltd in Kent, and latterly as an independent optical designer.

The manufacturers took a licence for the generic design from the Highways Agency, with Dr. Aston engineering a unique solution for each manufacturer. Producing both bulb and LED versions of the signal aspects, these signals are still the most common type of traffic light on UK roads. With the invention of anti-phantom, highly visible Aston lenses, lights of could be designed to give the same output as plain lenses, so a larger surface area was unnecessary. Consequently, lights of are no longer approved for use in the UK and all lights installed on new installations have to be in accordance with TSRGD (Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions). Exemptions are made for temporary or replacement signals.

=== Mounting and placement ===
The MUTCD identifies five types of traffic light mounts. On pedestals, signal heads are mounted on a single pole. This is the normal installation method for the UK. On mast arms, signal heads are mounted on a rigid arm over the road protuding from the pole. On strained poles, signals are suspended over a roadway on a wire, attached to poles at opposite kerbs. This is the most common installation method in the United States. Unipoles are similar to strain poles, but a single structure over the road, rather than two poles linked with wire. Signals can be attached to existing structures such as an overpass. Dummy lights are traffic signs located in the centre of a junction, which operate on a fixed cycle. These have generally been decommissioned due to safety concerns. A number remain due to historic value.

Signals can either be placed nearside – between the stop line and the kerbline of the intersecting road – or farside – on the opposite side of the junction. In European countries, signals are often placed on the nearside. In the UK, at least two signal heads are required, known as the primary and secondary heads, one of which is normally nearside and the other of which could be nearside or farside. In the US, signals are normally located farside, though in some states, nearside signals are also used. Nearside signals can be beneficial to road safety, as drivers have more time to see a red light and are less likely to encroach on pedestrian crossings.

== Effects ==
Drivers spend on average around 2% of journey time passing through signalised junctions. Traffic lights can increase the traffic capacity at intersections and reduce delay for side road traffic, but can also result in increased delay for main road traffic. Hans Monderman, the innovative Dutch traffic engineer, and pioneer of shared space schemes, was sceptical of their role, and is quoted as having said of them: &quot;We only want traffic lights where they are useful and I haven&#x27;t found anywhere where they are useful yet.&quot;

A World Economic Forum study found that signalised junctions are linked to higher rates of localised air pollution. Drivers accelerate and stop frequently at lights and as such peak particle concentration can be around 29 times higher than during free-flow conditions. The WEF recommends that traffic authorities synchronise traffic signals, consider alternative traffic management systems and consider placing traffic lights away from residential areas, schools, and hospitals.

The separation of conflicting streams of traffic in time can reduce the chances of right-angle collisions by turning traffic and cross traffic, but they can increase the frequency of rear-end crashes by up to 50%. Since right-angled and turn-against-traffic collisions are more likely to result in injuries, this is often an acceptable trade-off. They can also adversely affect the safety of bicycle and pedestrian traffic. Between 1979 and 1988, the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, removed signals at 199 intersections that were not warranted. On average, the intersections had 24% fewer crashes after the unwarranted signals were removed. The traffic lights had been erected in the 1960s because of since-resolved protests over traffic. By 1992, over 800 traffic lights had been removed at 426 intersections, and the number of crashes at these intersections dropped by 60%.

== Justification ==

Criteria have been developed to help ensure that new traffic lights are installed only where they will do more good than harm and to justify the removal of existing traffic lights where they are not warranted. They are most often placed on arterial roads at intersections with either another arterial road or a collector road, or on an expressway where an interchange is not warranted. In some situations, traffic signals can also be found on collector roads in busy settings.

The International Municipal Signal Association provides input as to standards concerning traffic signals and control devices. One example is the input the association provided for the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). The MUTCD is issued by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) of the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT).

In the United States, the criteria for installation of a traffic control signal are prescribed by the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), which defines the criteria in nine &quot;warrants&quot;:
* Eight-hour vehicular volume. Traffic volume must exceed prescribed minima for eight hours of an average weekday.
* Four-hour vehicular volume. Traffic volume must exceed prescribed minima for four hours of an average weekday.
* Peak hour volume or delay. This is applied only in unusual cases, such as office parks, industrial complexes, and park and ride lots that attract or discharge large numbers of vehicles in a short time, and for a minimum of one hour of an average weekday. The side road traffic suffers undue delays when entering or crossing the major street.
* Pedestrian volume. If the traffic volume on a major street is so heavy that pedestrians experience excessive delays in attempting to cross it.
* School crossing. If the traffic density at school crossing times exceeds one per minute which is considered to provide too few gaps in the traffic for children to safely cross the street.
* Coordinated signal system. For places where adjacent traffic control signals do not keep traffic grouped together efficiently.
* Crash experience. The volumes in the eight- and four-hour warrants may be reduced if five or more right-angle and cross traffic turn collisions have happened at the intersection in a twelve-month period.
* Roadway network. Installing a traffic control signal at some intersections might be justified to encourage concentration and organization of traffic flow on a roadway network.
* Intersection near a grade crossing. A traffic control signal is often justified at an intersection near a railroad crossing, in order to provide a preemption sequence to allow traffic queued up on the tracks an opportunity to clear the tracks before the train arrives.

In the US, an intersection is usually required to meet one or more of these warrants before a signal is installed. However, meeting one or more warrants does not require the installation of a traffic signal, it only suggests that they may be suitable. It could be that a roundabout would work better. There may be other unconsidered conditions that lead traffic engineers to conclude that a signal is undesirable. For example, it may be decided not to install a signal at an intersection if traffic stopped by it will back up and block another, more heavily trafficked intersection. Also, if a signal meets only the peak hour warrant, the advantages during that time may not outweigh the disadvantages during the rest of the day.

== In other contexts ==
The symbolism of a traffic light (and the meanings of the three primary colours used in traffic lights) are frequently found in many other contexts. Since they are often used as single spots of colour without the context of vertical position, they are typically not comprehensible to up to one in ten males who are colour blind.

Traffic lights have also been used in computer software, such as the macOS user interface, and in pieces of artwork, particularly &quot;Traffic Light Tree&quot; in London, UK.

=== Racing ===

Automobile racing circuits can also use standard traffic signals to indicate to racing car drivers the status of racing. On an oval track, four sets may be used, two facing a straight-away and two facing the middle of the 180-degree turn between straight-away. Green would indicate racing is underway, while amber would indicate to slow or while following a pace car; red would indicate to stop, probably for emergency reasons.

Scuderia Ferrari, a Formula One racing team, formerly used a traffic light system during their pit stops to signal to their drivers when to leave the pits. The red light was on when the tires were being changed and fuel was being added, amber was on when the tires were changed, and green was on when all work was completed. The system is (usually) completely automatic. However, the system was withdrawn after the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, due to the fact that it heavily delayed Felipe Massa during the race, when he was in the lead. 

Usually, the system was automatic, but heavy traffic in the pit lane forced the team to operate it manually. A mechanic accidentally pressed the green light button when the fuel hose was still attached to the car, causing Massa to drive off, towing the fuel hose along. Additionally, Massa drove into the path of Adrian Sutil, earning him a penalty. He finally stopped at the end of the pit lane, forcing Ferrari&#x27;s mechanics to sprint down the whole of the pit lane to remove the hose. As a result of this, and the penalty he also incurred, Massa finished 13th. Ferrari decided to use a traditional &quot;lollipop&quot; for the remainder of the 2008 season.

Another type of traffic light that is used in racing is the Christmas Tree, which is used in drag racing. The Christmas Tree has six lights: a blue staging light, three amber lights, a green light, and a red light. The blue staging light is divided into two parts: Pre-stage and stage. Sometimes, there are two sets of bulbs on top of each other to represent them. Once a driver is staged at the starting line, then the starter will activate the light to commence racing, which can be done in two ways. If a Pro tree is used, then the three amber lights will flash at the same time. For the Sportsman tree, the amber light will flash from top to bottom. When the green light comes up, the race officially begins but if a driver crosses the line before that happens, then a red light will come up and that will be a foul. 

=== As a rating mechanism ===
The colours red, amber, and green are often used as a simple-to-understand rating system for products and processes. It may be extended by analogy to provide a greater range of intermediate colours, with red and green at the extremes.

<doc id="163398" wikidata="Q231682" url="?curid=163398" title="Cleopatra Thea">
<text>Cleopatra I or Cleopatra Thea (, which means &quot;Cleopatra the Goddess&quot;; c. 164 – 121 BC), surnamed Eueteria ( ) was a ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire. She was queen consort of Syria from 150 to about 125 BC as the wife of three Syrian kings: Alexander Balas, Demetrius II Nicator, and Antiochus VII Sidetes. She ruled Syria from 125 BC after the death of Demetrius II Nicator, eventually in co-regency with her son Antiochus VIII Grypus until 121 or 120 BC.

==Biography==

===Childhood===
Cleopatra Thea was born, probably ca. 164 BC, to Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II, and grew up in Egypt. She may have been engaged to her uncle Ptolemy VIII, king of Cyrene, in 154, but he eventually married her sister Cleopatra III.

===Queen of Alexander Balas ===

In 152 BC, her father, who had come into conflict with the Seleucid king Demetrius I Soter, chose to promote Antiochus IV&#x27;s son Alexander Balas against him and supported him with troops and officers. When Alexander triumphed over Demetrius in 150 BC, he requested Ptolemy&#x27;s daughter as a warranty of alliance. The two kings met, amid sumptuous ceremonies, in Ptolemais Akko, and Alexander received Cleopatra in marriage. The marriage soon produced a son named Antiochus Dionysus.

===Queen of Demetrius II===
In 147 BC, Demetrius Soter&#x27;s son Demetrius II invaded Cilicia. Two years later Ptolemy VI brought his army into Syria, ostensibly to help Alexander Balas fight the invaders. Having installed garrisons in the Seleucid coastal cities, he eventually betrayed Alexander outright by seizing Antioch. There he reunited with Cleopatra. In accordance with her father&#x27;s new political program, she divorced Alexander and married Demetrius II instead. The marriage deal stated that Ptolemy would help Demetrius take the throne from Alexander; in exchange, Egypt would receive the province of Coele-Syria, which had been Seleucid territory since Antiochus III took it from Ptolemy V in 200 BC. Alexander quelled the Cilician revolt and returned home, confronting Ptolemy and Demetrius in the plain of the river Oeneparas, close to Antioch. In the ensuing battle, Alexander was defeated and Ptolemy was wounded so badly that he died a few days later. Demetrius repudiated his alliance with Egypt and expelled or massacred all of Ptolemy&#x27;s garrisons in Syria as far as Gaza, reinstating a fragile Seleucid control over the province. The Syrians had hostile memories of his father, and he faced rebellions in Antioch as soon as 144 BC. Demetrius instituted purges, but these aggravated the discontent instead of stifling it. 

Diodotus, a former general of Alexander and probable participant in the Antiochene rebellion, abducted Cleopatra&#x27;s first son Antiochus VI and used him as a figurehead for a secessionist kingdom in Coele-Syria. In 142/1 BC, Diodotus murdered the boy and proclaimed himself as king. During these years of brutal civil war, Cleopatra and Demetrius had at least three children, Seleucus, Antiochus and a daughter called Laodike.

===Queen of Antiochus VII ===
In 139 BC, Demetrius II was captured in battle against the kingdom of Parthia, which held him prisoner until 129 BC. Diodotus took the opportunity to conquer all of the Seleucid kingdom except the city of Seleucia in Pieria, where Cleopatra sought refuge. She sent for Demetrius&#x27;s younger brother, Antiochus VII Sidetes, proposing that he should marry her and become the new king. Accepting the offer, Antiochus VII defeated and killed Diodotus in 138 BC, ending the civil wars which had been ongoing since 152. Cleopatra Thea had at least one son with the king, Antiochus IX Cyzicenus. The names of any other children are uncertain.

During his reign, Cleopatra&#x27;s third husband reestablished Seleucid authority in the kingdom west of the Euphrates. Between 134 and 130 BC he waged a war to reclaim all the satrapies his predecessors had lost to the Parthians. The Parthian king Phraates II decided to release Demetrius II, who had been married to his sister Rhodogune, and to send him to Syria, thus provoking a civil war between the brothers and compelling Antiochus VII to retreat. In the winter of 130/129 Phraates killed Antiochus in an ambush near Ectabane, but Demetrius managed to enter his kingdom before the Parthians could retrieve him.

Cleopatra received Demetrius peaceably, but took the precaution of sending Antiochus IX (her son by Antiochus VII) to Cyzicus, out of the king&#x27;s immediate reach; she was said to be secretly furious at Demetrius taking a Parthian wife and having children with her. In 128 BC, Demetrius took an army to Egypt to help Cleopatra&#x27;s mother, Cleopatra II, with her ongoing struggle against her brother and husband Ptolemy VIII Physcon. He was forced to retreat near Pelousion because his soldiers refused to obey him, and Cleopatra Thea, then in Antioch, rebelled against him and established her son Antiochus as king. In the same year, Antioch was occupied by Alexander II Zabinas, a false child of Alexander Balas sent with troops by Ptolemy to wage war against Demetrius in Syria. Cleopatra Thea fled the city, and probably went to Ptolemais, where she had married Alexander Balas some twenty years earlier.

During the period between 128 and 125, while Demetrius was fighting against Alexander, Cleopatra remained in Ptolemais, probably with her two sons by Demetrius, Seleucus and Antiochus. In 125 Demetrius was completely defeated near Damascus by Alexander and his Egyptian allies, and also fled to Ptolemais. Cleopatra refused to admit him to the city; he went instead to Tyre, where the local Seleucid administrator killed him on Cleopatra&#x27;s orders.

===Co-ruler of Antiochus VIII===

Demetrius&#x27; elder son, Seleucus, proclaimed himself the new king with the name Seleucus V, but Cleopatra Thea had him executed by archers soon after. From 125 BC to 121 BC Cleopatra ruled Syria, sharing the throne with her son, Antiochus VIII Grypus, whom she had proclaimed king in Antioch in 128 BC. Antiochus VIII was married to Tryphaena, the daughter of Ptolemy VIII Physcon and Cleopatra III. 
Cleopatra Thea thus procured an Egyptian alliance, causing Ptolemy to turn against Alexander II (whom he had previously supported as a means of keeping the Seleucids preoccupied with civil war). By 123 BC Alexander II had been defeated and executed, Cleopatra and Grypus remaining joint rulers in Cilicia, Syria and Northern Mesopotamia.

Grypus became less controllable as he grew up, and in 121 BC Cleopatra Thea decided to eliminate him. She offered him a cup of poisoned wine, but Grypus guessed her intention and forced her to drink the wine, which killed her. Grypus&#x27;s sole reign was peaceful until ca. 114 BC, when Cleopatra Thea&#x27;s other son, Antiochus IX, returned to Syria to claim the throne and civil war started again.

==Family==

Cleopatra Thea was a daughter of Ptolemy VI Philometor and Cleopatra II of Egypt. She had two brothers named Ptolemy Eupator and Ptolemy respectively. Her sister Cleopatra III was Queen of Egypt and married to Ptolemy VIII, an uncle, who had been a former co-ruler of Cleopatra Thea&#x27;s parents. It is possible that Berenice, the fiancée of Attalus III, king of Pergamum, is another sister.

Cleopatra Thea married three times:
* Alexander Balas in about 150 BC. This union produced Antiochus VI Dionysus. Alexander Balas was neither popular, nor an efficient ruler. The marriage was dissolved by her father. Alexander Balas died in battle against Demetrius II of Syria in 145 BC.
* Demetrius II Nicator in 145 BC. Demetrius became a captive of the Parthians from 139 to 129 BC. He was assassinated in Tyre in 125 BC on Cleopatra Thea&#x27;s orders. Demetrius and Cleopatra Thea had at least two sons–Seleucus V Philometor, who was killed by his mother for taking the crown without her permission; and Antiochus VIII Grypus, who eventually killed his mother in turn. They also had a daughter Laodice, whom Phraates II of Parthia captured and later married for her beauty.
* Antiochus VII Sidetes, Demetrius&#x27; younger brother, in 137 BC after Demetrius was captured by the Parthians. Cleopatra and Antiochus VII had at least one son: Antiochus IX Cyzicenus. They also likely had two other sons named Antiochus and Seleucus and one or two daughters named Laodice.

<text>Joanne Michèle Sylvie Harris (born 3 July 1964) is a British author, best known for her 1999 novel &quot;Chocolat&quot;, which was adapted into a film of the same name. 

== Early life ==
Joanne Harris was born in Barnsley, Yorkshire, to an English father and a French mother, and lived above her grandparents&#x27; corner sweet shop until the age of three. Harris&#x27;s mother did not speak English when she married, and so Harris spoke only French until she started school. Both her parents taught French at Barnsley Girls&#x27; High School. Harris attended Wakefield Girls&#x27; High School and Barnsley Sixth Form College. She studied modern and mediaeval languages at St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge. She met her husband Kevin when they were both students at Barnsley Sixth Form College.

Growing up, Harris was influenced by Norse mythology, classic adventure stories including Jules Verne and Rider Haggard, and the work of Shirley Jackson, Ray Bradbury, Mervyn Peake and Emily Brontë.

== Literary career==
After a year as an accountant, which she later described as &quot;like being trapped in a Terry Gilliam film&quot;, Harris trained as a teacher at the University of Sheffield, and for 15 years she taught modern languages, mostly at the independent Leeds Grammar School, and later taught French literature at the University of Sheffield. While she was a teacher, she published the horror/gothic novels &quot;The Evil Seed&quot; and &quot;Sleep, Pale Sister&quot;.

This was followed by &quot;Chocolat&quot;, a literary novel set in a French village, which was shortlisted for the 1999 Whitbread Novel of the Year Award. Following the success in 2000 of the motion picture &quot;Chocolat&quot;, starring Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp, with a screenplay by Robert Nelson Jacobs, the book sold more than a million copies. Harris wrote three further novels in the &quot;Chocolat&quot; series: &quot;The Lollipop Shoes&quot; (titled &quot;The Girl With No Shadow&quot; in the US), &quot;Peaches for Monsieur le Curé&quot; (&quot;Peaches for Father Francis&quot; in the US), and &quot;The Strawberry Thief&quot;, as well as three French cookbooks (co-written with Fran Warde).

&quot;Chocolat&quot; was followed by the novels &quot;Blackberry Wine&quot; (2000) and &quot;Five Quarters of the Orange&quot; (2001), described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;quirky, sensuous books set in the French countryside, in which food dominates events as a token of love, a bargaining chip, a gesture of defiance&quot;. They were followed by &quot;Coastliners&quot; in 2002 and &quot;Holy Fools&quot; in 2003, both of which are set on the fictional French island of Le Devin.

In 2007, Harris published &quot;Runemarks&quot;, a fantasy novel based on Norse mythology. The sequels, &quot;Runelight&quot;, &quot;The Gospel of Loki&quot; and &quot;The Testament of Loki&quot; followed between 2011 and 2017. Harris&#x27; fantasy novels and novellas were published under the name Joanne M. Harris to distinguish them from her other work.

In 2006, Harris published &quot;Gentlemen and Players&quot;, a psychological thriller set in the fictional boys&#x27; grammar school of St Oswald&#x27;s, inspired by her time as a teacher. This was followed by two more St Oswald&#x27;s books, &quot;Different Class&quot; and &quot;A Narrow Door&quot;, alongside two more psychological thrillers, &quot;Blueeyedboy&quot; and &quot;Broken Light&quot;, all set in the fictional town of Malbry, inspired by the Yorkshire village of Almondbury.

Harris has also published three novellas, &quot;A Pocketful of Crows&quot;, &quot;The Blue Salt Road&quot;, and &quot;Orfeia&quot;, loosely based on Child Ballads and illustrated by Bonnie Helen Hawkins, as well as two collections of short stories and numerous contributions to various charitable anthologies. In 2021, she published &quot;Honeycomb&quot;, a collection of original fairytales forming a mosaic novel, illustrated by Charles Vess. She has also published a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novella, &quot;The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Time Traveller&quot;. 

In 2024, Orion Books announced plans to bring out a prequel to &quot;Chocolat&quot;, entitled &quot;Vianne&quot;, due to be published in 2025.

Harris&#x27;s books have now been published in more than 50 languages.

== Journalism ==
Harris writes regularly for the press, and has written multiple travel pieces for &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;, as well as articles on more literary themes. In 2017 she won a Fragrance Foundation Jasmine Award for an article on memory and scent, published in &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;.

== Themes ==
Repeated themes in Harris&#x27; books include: food as a means of understanding character; the dynamic between feasting and fasting; motherhood and the patriarchy; tensions within communities; outsiders and outcasts; religious intolerance and &quot;the magic of everyday things&quot;.

Many of Harris&#x27; books are about women who challenge the status quo and the way in which women are perceived in society. Harris also regularly uses folklore and myth in her novels, giving a modern, original spin to traditional stories.

== Reception ==
The books have been praised for their multi-layered storytelling, use of culinary metaphors and arresting plot twists. &quot;The Guardian&quot; describes Harris&#x27;s books as &quot;astringent, highly original and often subtly fantastic mainstream novels&quot;. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; says: &quot;The &quot;Chocolat&quot; novels are poignant literary explorations of universal themes of pleasure and denial, the dangers of dogma, xenophobia and racism and the enduring power of love and understanding to eradicate the traumas of the past,&quot; with a &quot;Locus&quot; review calling Harris &quot;exceedingly gifted at producing vivid imagery&quot;. Critics have remarked on her skill at &quot;foreshadowing impending doom&quot; and &quot;unerring eye for school life&quot;. Some reviewers have questioned the plausibility of some of the plot twists, while acknowledging the compulsive nature of the read.

== Other activities ==

Harris has been involved in a number of musical projects, including collaborating with Lucie Treacher and the Tête à Tête Opera Festival to create two mini-operas, building a stage show with the Storytime Band based on her work, and co-writing and developing an original stage musical, &quot;Stunners&quot;, with Howard Goodall.

She has judged the Orange (Women&#x27;s) Prize, the Whitbread Prize, the Desmond Elliott Prize, the Betty Trask Prize, the Primadonna Prize, the Comedy Women in Print Award and the Winton Prize for Science Books. In 2024 Harris was announced as the chief judge of the new Entente Littéraire Prize for French and UK Young Adult novels, a joint initiative of Queen Camilla and Brigitte Macron, sponsored by the Royal Society of Literature.

She is active on social media, and in 2016 was nominated for a Shorty Award for her contributions.

In 2021, Harris was a guest on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, where her chosen book was the collected works of Victor Hugo, her luxury was her own shed, and the record she &quot;would save from the waves&quot; was Johnny Nash&#x27;s &quot;I Can See Clearly Now&quot;.

Harris is a patron of the charities Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), to which she donated the proceeds of her cookery books, and Plan UK. In 2009 she travelled to the Congo to report on MSF&#x27;s work there. Harris sits on the Board of the Authors&#x27; Licensing and Collecting Society. 

Harris was chair of the management committee of the Society of Authors for two terms from 2020 to 2024, being unanimously re-elected to the position in March 2022. She assisted in several SOA campaigns, including calling for more investment in libraries and the arts, calling for translators to have their names on the cover of books, and raising awareness on author pay and conditions. In 2022 she appeared on the &quot;Bookseller&quot;&#x27;s list of the 150 most influential people in publishing.

She has also campaigned for literary festivals to pay contributors, has spoken out in favour of trigger warnings in books and has spoken out against sexism in publishing and the gendering of children&#x27;s books. In 2015, Harris launched a protest against the Clean Reader app, which had been designed to replace profanities in books with &quot;clean&quot; alternatives, calling it &quot;censorship, not by the state, but by a religious minority&quot;. This campaign, which was supported by many other authors, including Chuck Wendig, Charles Stross and Margaret Atwood, led to the speedy removal of the app.

In 2022 a members&#x27; vote was raised calling for Harris to stand down as chair of the SOA, in relation to the society&#x27;s stance on protecting free speech. The motion was defeated, with 81% voting against.

==Honours and awards==
Harris is the holder of honorary doctorates in literature from the University of Huddersfield and the University of Sheffield, and is an Honorary Fellow of St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

Harris was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2013 Birthday Honours and Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2022 Birthday Honours for services to literature.

In 2022, she was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.

Harris was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2020, and discussed the diagnosis and her ongoing treatment on social media and at the Hay Festival. In 2023, she was declared cancer-free, and wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that the experience had made her reassess her priorities and had given her back her voice.

<text>&#x27; ( , ; fem. &#x27;, literally &#x27;mixed person&#x27;) is a person of mixed heritage, In certain regions such as Latin America, it may also refer to people who are culturally European even though their ancestors were Indigenous American, or African. The term was used as an ethno-racial exonym for mixed-race that evolved during the Spanish Empire. It was a formal label for individuals in official documents, such as censuses, parish registers, Inquisition trials, and others. Priests and royal officials might have classified persons as mestizos, but individuals also used the term in self-identification. With the Bourbon reforms and the independence of the Americas, the caste system disappeared and terms like &quot;mestizo&quot; fell in popularity.

The noun , derived from the adjective , is a term for racial mixing that did not come into usage until the 20th century; it was not a colonial-era term. In the modern era, &quot;mestizaje&quot; is used by scholars such as Gloria Anzaldúa as a synonym for miscegenation, but with positive connotations.

In the modern era, particularly in Latin America, has become more of a cultural term, with the term &quot;indio&quot; being reserved exclusively for people who have maintained a separate Indigenous ethnic and cultural identity, language, tribal affiliation, community engagement, etc. In late 19th- and early 20th-century Peru, for instance, &quot;mestizaje&quot; denoted those peoples with evidence of Euro-indigenous ethno-racial &quot;descent&quot; and accessusually monetary access, but not alwaysto secondary educational institutions. Similarly, well before the 20th century, Euramerican &quot;descent&quot; did not necessarily denote Spanish American ancestry (distinct Portuguese administrative classification: &quot;mestiço&quot;), especially in Andean regions re-infrastructured by United States and European &quot;modernities&quot; and buffeted by mining labor practices. This conception changed by the 1920s, especially after the national advancement and cultural economics of .

To avoid confusion with the original usage of the term , mixed people started to be referred to collectively as . In some Latin American countries, such as Mexico, the concept of the Mestizo became central to the formation of a new independent identity that was neither wholly Spanish nor wholly Indigenous. The word acquired another meaning in the 1930 census, being used by the government to refer to all Mexicans who did not speak Indigenous languages regardless of ancestry. In 20th- and 21st-century Peru, the nationalization of Quechuan languages and Aymaran languages as &quot;official languages of the State...wherever they predominate&quot; has increasingly severed these languages from &quot;mestizaje&quot; as an exonym (and, in certain cases, &quot;indio&quot;), with indigenous languages tied to linguistic areas as well as topographical and geographical contexts. &quot;La sierra&quot; from the Altiplano to Huascarán, for instance, is more commonly connected to language families in both urban and rural vernacular.

During the colonial era of Mexico, the category Mestizo was used rather flexibly to register births in local parishes and its use did not follow any strict genealogical pattern. With Mexican independence, in academic circles created by the &quot;mestizaje&quot; or &quot;Cosmic Race&quot; ideology, scholars asserted that Mestizos are the result of the mixing of all the races. After the Mexican Revolution the government, in its attempts to create an unified Mexican identity with no racial distinctions, adopted and actively promoted the &quot;mestizaje&quot; ideology.
==Etymology==
The Spanish word is from Latin &quot;mixticius&quot;, meaning mixed. Its usage was documented as early as 1275, to refer to the offspring of an Egyptian/Afro Hamite and a Semite/Afro Asiatic. This term was first documented in English in 1582.

===Cognates and related terms===
 ( ), ( ), (), (), (), (), (), (), and &quot;mixed&quot; are all cognates of the Latin word .

The Portuguese cognate, , historically referred to any mixture of Portuguese and local populations in the Portuguese colonies. In colonial Brazil, most of the non-enslaved population was initially , i.e. mixed Portuguese and Native Brazilian. There was no descent-based casta system, and children of upper-class Portuguese landlord males and enslaved females enjoyed privileges higher than those given to the lower classes, such as formal education. Such cases were not so common and the children of enslaved women tended not to be allowed to inherit property. This right of inheritance was generally given to children of free women, who tended to be legitimate offspring in cases of concubinage (this was a common practice in certain Indigenous American and African cultures). In the Portuguese-speaking world, the contemporary sense has been the closest to the historical usage from the Middle Ages. Because of important linguistic and historical differences, (mixed, mixed-ethnicity, miscegenation, etc.) is separated altogether from (which refers to any kind of brown people) and (brown people originally of European–Indigenous American admixture, or assimilated Indigenous American). The term can also refer to fully African or East Asian in their full definition (thus not brown). One does not need to be a to be classified as pardo or caboclo. 

In Brazil specifically, at least in modern times, all non-Indigenous people are considered to be a single ethnicity (. Lines between ethnic groups are historically fluid); since the earliest years of the Brazilian colony, the group has been the most numerous among the free people. As explained above, the concept of should not be confused with &quot;mestizo&quot; as used in either the Spanish-speaking world or the English-speaking one. It does not relate to being of Indigenous American ancestry, and is not used interchangeably with , literally &quot;brown people&quot;. (There are among all major groups of the country: Indigenous, Asian, , and African, and they likely constitute the majority in the three latter groups.)

In English-speaking Canada, Canadian Métis (capitalized), as a loanword from French, refers to persons of mixed French or European and Indigenous ancestry, who were part of a particular ethnic group. French-speaking Canadians, when using the word &quot;métis&quot;, are referring to Canadian Métis ethnicity, and all persons of mixed Indigenous and European ancestry. Many were involved in the fur trade with Canadian First Nations peoples (especially Cree and Anishinaabeg). Over generations, they developed a separate culture of hunters and trappers, and were concentrated in the Red River Valley and speak the Michif language.

==Mestizo as a colonial-era category==


In the Spanish colonial period, the Spanish developed a complex set of racial terms and ways to describe difference. Although this has been conceived of as a &quot;system,&quot; and often called the &quot;sistema de castas&quot; or &quot;sociedad de castas&quot;, archival research shows that racial labels were not fixed throughout a person&#x27;s life. Artwork created mainly in eighteenth-century Mexico, &quot;casta paintings,&quot; show groupings of racial types in hierarchical order, which has influenced the way that modern scholars have conceived of social difference in Spanish America.

During the initial period of colonization of the Americas by the Spanish, there were three chief categories of ethnicities: Spaniard (&quot;español&quot;), American Indian (&quot;indio&quot;), and African (&quot;negro&quot;). Throughout the territories of the Spanish Empire in the Americas, ways of differentiating individuals in a racial hierarchy, often called in the modern era the &quot;sistema de castas&quot; or the &quot;sociedad de castas&quot;, developed where society was divided based on color, &quot;calidad&quot; (status), and other factors.

The main divisions were as follows:
# &quot;Español&quot; (fem. española), i.e. Spaniard – person of Spanish ancestry; a blanket term, subdivided into &quot;Peninsulares&quot; and &quot;Criollos&quot;
#*&quot;Peninsular&quot; – a person of Spanish descent born in Spain who later settled in the Americas;
#* &quot;Criollo&quot; (fem. criolla) – a person of Spanish descent born in the Americas;
# &quot;Castizo&quot; (fem. castiza) – a person with primarily Spanish and some American Indian ancestry born into a mixed family.
# &quot;Mestizo&quot; (fem. mestiza) – a person of extended mixed Spanish and American Indian ancestry;
# &quot;Indio&quot; (fem. India) – a person of pure American Indian ancestry;
# &quot;Pardo&quot; (fem. parda) – a person of mixed Spanish, Amerindian and African ancestry; sometimes a polite term for a black person;
# &quot;Mulato&quot; (fem. mulata) – a person of mixed Spanish and African ancestry;
# &quot;Zambo&quot; – a person of mixed African and American Indian ancestry;
# &quot;Negro&quot; (fem. negra) – a person of African descent, primarily former enslaved Africans and their descendants.

In theory, and as depicted in some eighteenth-century Mexican casta paintings, the offspring of a castizo/a [mixed Spanish - Mestizo] and an Español/a could be considered Español/a, or &quot;returned&quot; to that status.

Racial labels in a set of eighteenth-century Mexican casta paintings by Miguel Cabrera:
*De Español e India, nace Mestiza
*De Español y Mestiza, nace Castiza
*De Castizo y Española, nace Española
*De Español y Negra, nace Mulata
*De Español y Mulata, nace Morisca
*De Español y Morisca, nace Albino
*De Español y Albina, nace Torna atrás
*De Español y Torna atrás, &quot;Tente en el ayre&quot;
*De Negro y India, Chino Cambuja
*De Chino Cambujo y India, Loba
*De Lobo y India, Albarazado
*De Albarazado y Mestiza, Barcino
*De Indio y Barcina, Zambaiga
*De Castizo y Mestiza, Chamizo
*Indios Gentiles (Barbarian Meco Indians)

In the early colonial period, the children of Spaniards and American Indians were raised either in the Hispanic world, if the father recognized the offspring as his natural child; or the child was raised in the Indigenous world of the mother if he did not. As early as 1533, Charles V mandated the high court (Audiencia) to take the children of Spanish men and Indigenous women from their mothers and educate them in the Spanish sphere. This mixed group born out of Christian wedlock increased in numbers, generally living in their mother&#x27;s Indigenous communities.

Mestizos were the first group in the colonial era to be designated as a separate category from the Spanish (Españoles) and enslaved African blacks (&quot;Negros&quot;) and were included in the designation of &quot;vagabonds&quot; (&quot;vagabundos&quot;) in 1543 in Mexico. Although Mestizos were often classified as &quot;castas&quot;, they had a higher standing than any mixed-race person since they did not have to pay tribute, the men could be ordained as priests, and they could be licensed to carry weapons, in contrast to &quot;negros&quot;, mulattoes, and other castas. Unlike Blacks and mulattoes, Mestizos had no African ancestors. Intermarriage between Españoles and Mestizos resulted in offspring designated &quot;Castizos&quot; (&quot;three-quarters white&quot;), and the marriage of a castizo/a to an Español/a resulted in the restoration of Español/a status to the offspring. Don Alonso O’Crouley observed in Mexico (1774), &quot;If the mixed-blood is the offspring of a Spaniard and an Indian, the stigma [of race mixture] disappears at the third step in descent because it is held as systematic that a Spaniard and an Indian produce a &quot;mestizo&quot;; a &quot;mestizo&quot; and a Spaniard, a &quot;castizo&quot;; and a &quot;castizo&quot; and a Spaniard, a Spaniard. The admixture of Indian blood should not indeed be regarded as a blemish, since the provisions of law give the Indian all that he could wish for, and Philip II granted to &quot;mestizos&quot; the privilege of becoming priests. On this consideration is based the common estimation of descent from a union of Indian and European or creole Spaniard.&quot;  O’Crouley states that the same process of restoration of racial purity does not occur over generations for European-African offspring marrying whites. &quot;From the union of a Spaniard and a Negro the mixed-blood retains the stigma for generations without losing the original quality of a mulato.&quot;

The Spanish colonial regime divided groups into two basic legal categories, the Republic of Indians (&quot;República de Indios&quot;) and the Republic of Spaniards (&quot;República de Españoles&quot;) comprised the Spanish (Españoles) and all other non-Indian peoples. Indians were free vassals of the crown, whose commoners paid tribute while Indigenous elites were considered nobles and tribute exempt, as were Mestizos. Indians were nominally protected by the crown, with non-Indians (Mestizos, blacks, and mulattoes) forbidden to live in Indigenous communities. Mestizos and Indians in Mexico habitually held each other in mutual antipathy. This was particularly the case with commoner American Indians against Mestizos, some of whom infiltrated their communities and became part of the ruling elite. Spanish authorities turned a blind eye to the Mestizos&#x27; presence, since they collected commoners&#x27; tribute for the crown and came to hold offices. They were useful intermediaries for the colonial state between the Republic of Spaniards and the Republic of Indians.

A person&#x27;s legal racial classification in colonial Spanish America was closely tied to social status, wealth, culture, and language use. Wealthy people paid to change or obscure their actual ancestry. Many Indigenous people left their traditional villages and sought to be counted as Mestizos to avoid tribute payments to the Spanish. Many Indigenous people, and sometimes those with partial African descent, were classified as Mestizo if they spoke Spanish and lived as Mestizos.

In colonial Venezuela, was more commonly used instead of . means being mixed without specifying which mixture; it was used to describe anyone born in the Americas whose ancestry was a mixture of European, Native American, and African.

When the First Mexican Republic was established in 1824, legal racial categories ceased to exist. The production of casta paintings in New Spain ceased at the same juncture, after almost a century as a genre.

Because the term had taken on a myriad of meanings, the designation &quot;Mestizo&quot; was actively removed from census counts in Mexico and is no longer in official nor governmental use.

===Mexico===

Around 40–90% of Mexicans can be classified as &quot;mestizos&quot;, meaning in modern Mexican usage that they identify fully neither with any European heritage nor with an Indigenous ethnic group, but rather identify as having cultural traits incorporating both European and Indigenous elements. In Mexico, mestizo has become a blanket term that not only refers to mixed Mexicans but includes all Mexican citizens who do not speak Indigenous languages
Sometimes, particularly outside of Mexico, the word &quot;mestizo&quot; is used with the meaning of Mexican persons with mixed Indigenous and European blood. This usage does not conform to the Mexican social reality where a person of pure Indigenous ancestry would be considered mestizo either by rejecting his Indigenous culture or by not speaking an Indigenous language, and a person with none or very low Indigenous ancestry would be considered Indigenous either by speaking an Indigenous language or by identifying with a particular Indigenous cultural heritage. In the Yucatán Peninsula, the word mestizo has a different meaning to the one used in the rest of Mexico, being used to refer to the Maya-speaking populations living in traditional communities, because during the Caste War of Yucatán of the late 19th century those Maya who did not join the rebellion were classified as mestizos. In Chiapas, the term &quot;Ladino&quot; is used instead of Mestizo.

Due to the extensiveness of the modern definition of mestizo, various publications offer different estimations of this group, some try to use a biological, racial perspective and calculate the mestizo population in contemporary Mexico as being around a half and two-thirds of the population, while others use the culture-based definition, and estimate the percentage of mestizos as high as 90% of the Mexican population, several others mix-up both due lack of knowledge in regards to the modern definition and assert that mixed ethnicity Mexicans are as much as 93% of Mexico&#x27;s population. Paradoxically to its wide definition, the word mestizo has long been dropped off popular Mexican vocabulary, with the word sometimes having pejorative connotations, which further complicates attempts to quantify mestizos via self-identification.

While for most of its history the concept of mestizo and mestizaje has been lauded by Mexico&#x27;s intellectual circles, in recent times the concept has been a target of criticism, with its detractors claiming that it delegitimizes the importance of ethnicity in Mexico under the idea of &quot;(racism) not existing here (in Mexico), as everybody is mestizo.&quot; Anthropologist Federico Navarrete concludes that reintroducing racial classification, and accepting itself as a multicultural country, as opposed to a monolithic mestizo country, would bring benefits to Mexican society as a whole.

====Genetic studies====

A 2020 study published in &quot;Human Immunology&quot; analyzed the genetic diversity of the Mexican population through the HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) system, a set of genes involved in immune response. The findings confirm that the genetic composition of mestizos varies significantly across different regions of Mexico, reflecting the admixture patterns observed in previous studies. Specifically:

* Indigenous American ancestry is predominant in the southern region
* European ancestry is higher in the northern and western regions
* A low but significant African ancestry is present in certain areas

The study also highlights that genetic variation among Mexican populations has medical implications, affecting susceptibility to autoimmune and infectious diseases. 

A 2012 study published by the Journal of Human Genetics found that the Y-chromosome (paternal) ancestry of the average Mexican mestizo was predominantly European (64.9%), followed by Indigenous American (30.8%), and African (4.2%). The European ancestry was more prevalent in the north and west (66.7–95%) and Indigenous American ancestry increased in the centre and south-east (37–50%), the African ancestry was low and relatively homogeneous (0–8.8%). The states that participated in this study were Aguascalientes, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Durango, Guerrero, Jalisco, Oaxaca, Sinaloa, Veracruz and Yucatán.

A study of 104 mestizos from Sonora, Yucatán, Guerrero, Zacatecas, Veracruz, and Guanajuato by Mexico&#x27;s National Institute of Genomic Medicine, reported that mestizo Mexicans are 58.96% European, 31.05% Indigenous American, and 10.03% African. Sonora shows the highest European contribution (70.63%) and Guerrero the lowest (51.98%) which also has the highest Indigenous American contribution (37.17%). African contribution ranges from 2.8% in Sonora to 11.13% in Veracruz. 80% of the Mexican population was classed as mestizo (defined as &quot;being racially mixed in some degree&quot;).

In May 2009, the same institution (Mexico&#x27;s National Institute of Genomic Medicine) issued a report on a genomic study of 300 mestizos from those same states. The study found that the mestizo population of these Mexican states were on average 55% of Indigenous ancestry followed by 41.8% of European, 1.8% of African, and 1.2% of East Asian ancestry. The study also noted that whereas mestizo individuals from the southern state of Guerrero showed on average 66% of Indigenous ancestry, those from the northern state of Sonora displayed about 61.6% European ancestry. The study found that there was an increase in Indigenous ancestry as one traveled towards to the Southern states in Mexico, while the Indigenous ancestry declined as one traveled to the Northern states in the country, such as Sonora.

=== Central America ===

The Ladino people are a mix of Mestizo or Hispanicized peoples in Latin America, principally in Central America. The demonym &quot;Ladino&quot; is a Spanish word that derives from &quot;Latino&quot;. &quot;Ladino&quot; is an exonym dating to the colonial era to refer to those Spanish-speakers who were not colonial elites (Peninsulares and Criollos), or Indigenous peoples.

====Costa Rica====


, most Costa Ricans are primarily of Spanish or mestizo ancestry with minorities of German, Italian, Jamaican, and Greek ancestry.

European migrants used Costa Rica to get across the isthmus of Central America as well to reach the U.S. West Coast (California) in the late 19th century and until the 1910s (before the Panama Canal opened). Other ethnic groups known to live in Costa Rica include Nicaraguan, Colombians, Venezuelans, Peruvian, Brazilians, Portuguese, Palestinians, Caribbeans, Turks, Armenians, and Georgians.

Costa Rica has four small minority groups: Mulattos, Afro, Indigenous Costa Ricas, and Asians. About 8% of the population is of African descent or mulatto (mix of European and African) who are called Afro-Costa Ricans, English-speaking descendants of 19th century Afro-Jamaican immigrant workers.

By the late 20th century, allusions in textbooks and political discourse to &quot;whiteness,&quot; or to Spain as the &quot;mother country&quot; of all Costa Ricans, were diminishing, replaced with a recognition of the multiplicity of peoples that make up the nation.

====El Salvador====

In Central America, intermarriage by European men with Indigenous women, typically of Lenca, Cacaopera and Pipil backgrounds in what is now El Salvador happened almost immediately after the arrival of the Spaniards led by Pedro de Alvarado. Other Indigenous groups in the country such as Maya Poqomam people, Maya Ch&#x27;orti&#x27; people, Alaguilac, Xinca people, Mixe and Mangue language people became culturally extinct due to the mestizo process or diseases brought by the Spaniards. Mestizo culture quickly became the most successful and dominant culture in El Salvador. The majority of Salvadorans in modern El Salvador identify themselves as 86.3% Mestizo roots.

Historical evidence and census supports the explanation of &quot;strong sexual asymmetry&quot;, as a result of a strong bias favoring children born to European man and Indigenous women, and to the important Indigenous male mortality during the conquest. The genetics thus suggests the Native men were sharply reduced in numbers due to the war and disease. Large numbers of Spaniard men settled in the region and married or forced themselves with the local women. The Natives were forced to adopt Spanish names, language, and religion, and in this way, the Lencas and Pipil women and children were Hispanicized. This has made El Salvador one of the world&#x27;s most highly mixed race nations.

In 1932, ruthless dictator Maximiliano Hernández Martínez was responsible for La Matanza (&quot;The Slaughter&quot;), known as the 1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre in which the Indigenous people were murdered in an effort to wipe out the Indigenous people in El Salvador during the 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising. Indigenous peoples, mostly of Lenca, Cacaopera, and Pipil descent are still present in El Salvador in several communities, conserving their languages, customs, and traditions.

There is a significant Arab population (of about 100,000), mostly from Palestine (especially from the area of Bethlehem), but also from Lebanon. Salvadorans of Palestinian descent numbered around 70,000 individuals, while Salvadorans of Lebanese descent is around 27,000. There is also a small community of Jews who came to El Salvador from France, Germany, Morocco, Tunisia, and Turkey. Many of these Arab groups naturally mixed and contributed into the modern Salvadoran Mestizo population.

Pardo is the term that was used in colonial El Salvador to describe a person of tri-racial or Indigenous, European, and African descent. El Salvador is the only country in Central America that does not have a significant African population due to many factors including El Salvador not having a Caribbean coast, and because of president Maximiliano Hernández Martínez, who passed racial laws to keep people of African descent and others out of El Salvador, though Salvadorans with African ancestry, called Pardos, were already present in El Salvador, the majority are tri-racial Pardo Salvadorans who largely cluster with the Mestizo population. They have been mixed into and were naturally bred out by the general Mestizo population, which is a combination of a Mestizo majority and the minority of Pardo people, both of whom are racially mixed populations. A total of only 10,000 enslaved Africans were brought to El Salvador over the span of 75 years, starting around 1548, about 25 years after El Salvador&#x27;s colonization. The enslaved Africans that were brought to El Salvador during the colonial times, eventually came to mix and merged into the much larger and vaster Mestizo mixed European Spanish/Native Indigenous population creating Pardo or Afromestizos who cluster with Mestizo people, contributing into the modern day Mestizo population in El Salvador, thus, there remains no significant extremes of African physiognomy among Salvadorans like there is in the other countries of Central America.

Today, many Salvadorans identify themselves as being culturally part of the majority Salvadoran mestizo population, even if they are racially European (especially Mediterranean), as well as Indigenous people in El Salvador who do not speak Indigenous languages nor have an Indigenous culture, and tri-racial/pardo Salvadorans or Arab Salvadorans.

====Guatemala====

The Ladino population in Guatemala is officially recognized as a distinct ethnic group, and the Ministry of Education of Guatemala uses the following definition: 
&quot;The Ladino population has been characterized as a heterogeneous population which expresses itself in the Spanish language as a maternal language, which possesses specific cultural traits of Hispanic origin mixed with Indigenous cultural elements, and dresses in a style commonly considered as western.&quot;

==Spanish-speaking South America==

===Argentina and Uruguay===
Initially colonial Argentina and Uruguay had a predominantly mestizo population like the rest of the Spanish colonies, but due to a flood of European migration in the 19th century and the repeated intermarriage with Europeans, the mestizo population became a so-called Castizo population. With more Europeans arriving in the early 20th century, the majority of these immigrants coming from Italy and Spain, the face of Argentina and Uruguay has overwhelmingly become European in culture and tradition. Because of this, the term Mestizo has fallen into disuse. Nevertheless, the cultural practice of the region is commonly centred on the figure of the Gaucho, which intrinsically mixes European and native traditions.

Argentine Northwest still has an important mestizo population, especially in the provinces of Jujuy and Salta.

===Chile===
In Chile, from the time the Spanish soldiers with Pedro de Valdivia entered northern Chile, a process of &#x27;mestizaje&#x27; began where Spaniards began to intermarry and reproduce with the local bellicose Mapuche population of Indigenous Chileans to produce an overwhelmingly mestizo population during the first generation in all of the cities they founded. In Southern Chile, the Mapuche, were one of the only Indigenous tribes in the Americas that were in continuous conflict with the Spanish Empire and did not submit to a European power. But because Southern Chile was settled by German settlers in 1848, many mestizos include descendants of Mapuche and German settlers.

A public health book from the University of Chile states that 60% of the population is of only European origin; mestizos are estimated to amount to a total of 35%, while Indigenous peoples comprise the remaining 5%. A genetic study by the same university showed that the average Chilean&#x27;s genes in the Mestizo segment are 60% European and 40% Indigenous American.

As Easter Island is a territory of Chile and the native settlers are Rapa Nui, descendants of intermarriages of European Chileans (mostly Spanish) and Rapa Nui are even considered by Chilean law as mestizos.

===Colombia===
Colombia whose land was named after explorer Christopher Columbus is the product of the interacting and mixing of the European conquistadors and colonist with the different Amerindian peoples of Colombia. With the arrival of Europeans came the arrival of the enslaved Africans, whose cultural element was mostly introduced into the coastal areas of Colombia. To this day, Afro-Colombians form a majority in several coastal regions of the country. 

Over time Colombia has become a primarily Mestizo country due to limited immigration from Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, with the minorities being: the mulattoes and pardos, both mixed race groups of significant partial African ancestry who live primarily in coastal regions among other Afro-Colombians; and pockets of Amerindians living around the rural areas and the Amazonian Basin regions of the country.

Estimates of the Mestizo or Mixed population in Colombia vary, as Colombia&#x27;s national census does not distinguish between White and Mestizo Colombians. According to the 2018 census, the Mestizo and White population combined make up approximately 87% of the Colombian population, while an estimated 49–60% of Colombians are Mestizo or mixed race. A study by Rojas et al. reported an average of 47% Amerindian, 42% European, and 11% African. A genetic study conducted by Criollo at el estimates that the average admixture for Mestizo Colombians is 50.8% European, 40.7% Amerindian, and 8.5% African ancestry, however this varies significantly across region.

===Ecuador===
During the colonial era, the majority of Ecuadorians were Amerindians and the minorities were the Spanish conquistadors, who came with Francisco Pizarro and Sebastián de Belalcázar. With the passage of time these Spanish conquerors and succeeding Spanish colonists sired offspring, largely nonconsensually, with the local Amerindian population, since Spanish immigration did not initially include many European females to the colonies. In a couple of generations a predominantly Mestizo population emerged in Ecuador with a drastically declining Amerindian population due to European diseases and wars.

Afro-Ecuadorians, (including zambos and mulattoes), are a significant minority in the country, and can be found mostly in the Esmeraldas Province and in the Valle del Chota of the Imbabura Province. They form a majority in both of those regions. There are also small communities of Afro-Ecuadorians living along the coastal areas outside of the Esmeraldas province. However, significant numbers of Afro-Ecuadorians can be found in the countries&#x27; largest cities of Guayaquil and Quito, where they have been migrating to from their ancestral regions in search of better opportunities.

Mestizos are the largest of all the ethnic groups, and comprise 70% of the current population. The next 30% of the population is comprised by four ethnic groups with about 7.5% each, the Montubio (a term for Mestizos from the inland countryside of coastal Ecuador - who are culturally distinct from Mestizos from the rest of the country), Afro-Ecuadorian, Amerindians, and Europeans.

===Paraguay===

During the reign of José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, the first consul of Paraguay from 1811 to 1840, he imposed a law that no Spaniard may intermarry with another Spaniard, and that they may only wed mestizos or Amerindians. This was introduced to eliminate any sense of racial superiority, and also to end the predominantly Spanish influence in Paraguay. De Francia himself was not a Mestizo (although his paternal grandfather was Afro-Brazilian), but feared that racial superiority would create class division which would threaten his absolute rule.

As a result of this, today 70% of Paraguay&#x27;s population is mestizo, and the main language is the native Guaraní, spoken by 60% of the population as a first language, with Spanish spoken as a first language by 40% of the population, and fluently spoken by 75%, making Paraguay one of the most bilingual countries in the world. After the tremendous decline of male population as a result of the War of the Triple Alliance, European male worker émigrés mixed with the female Mestizo population to create a middle-class of largely Mestizo background.

===Peru===
According to Alberto Flores Galindo, &quot;By the 1940 census, the last that utilized racial categories, Mestizos were grouped with white, and the two constituted more than 53% of the population. Mestizos likely outnumbered Indians and were the largest population group.&quot;

===Venezuela===
Mestizos are the majority in Venezuela, accounting for 51.6% of the country&#x27;s population. According to D&#x27;Ambrosio 57.1% of Mestizos have mostly European characteristics, 28.5% have mostly African characteristics and 14.2% have mostly Amerindian characteristics.

== Spanish East Indies==

===Guam and Northern Mariana Islands===

In Guam and Northern Mariana Islands, which were administered from the Philippines under the Spanish East Indies, the term &quot;mestizo&quot; referred to people of mixed Chamorro (&quot;indio&quot;) or Filipino and Spanish ancestry. In the administrative racial hierarchy, they were ranked below the full-blooded Spaniards (&quot;peninsulares&quot; and &quot;criollos&quot;), but ranked higher than full-blooded Indigenous Filipinos and Chamorro. The term &quot;indio&quot; originally applied to both Filipinos and Indigenous Chamorro, but they were later separately designated in Spanish censuses in Guam. Like in the Philippines, this caste system was legally mandated and determined what taxes a person must pay. Both full-blooded Spaniards and &quot;mestizos&quot; were exempt from paying tribute as specified in the Laws of the Indies.
In modern Guam, the Chamorro term &quot;mestisu&quot; (feminine &quot;mestisa&quot;) refers to a person of mixed Chamorro and any foreign ancestry. It can be heritage-specific, such as &quot;mestisan CHamoru yan Tagalu&quot; (&quot;female of mixed Chamorro and Filipino descent&quot;) or &quot;mestison CHamoru yan Amerikanu&quot; (&quot;male of mixed Chamorro and White American descent&quot;).
===Philippines===

In the Philippines, the term &quot;mestizo&quot; was used to refer to a person with mixed native (&quot;indio&quot;) and either Spanish or Chinese ancestry during the Spanish colonial period (1565–1898). It was a legal classification and played an important part in the colonial taxation system as well as social status.
The term most commonly applied to &quot;mestizos de español&quot; (&quot;Spanish mestizos&quot;), most of whom were descendants of intermarriage between Spanish settlers and the pre-colonial ruling families (&quot;caciques&quot;). They were part of the land-owning aristocratic class known as the &quot;Principalia&quot;. Like people of full Spanish ancestry (&quot;blanco&quot;, the &quot;peninsulares&quot; and &quot;insulares&quot;), &quot;mestizos de español&quot; were not required to pay the &quot;tribute&quot; (a personal tax) levied on natives specified in the Laws of the Indies.
The &quot;mestizo&quot; classification was also applied to people of mixed native and Chinese ancestry who converted to Catholicism, of which there was a much larger population. They were differentiated from the Spanish mestizos as &quot;mestizos de sangley&quot; (&quot;Chinese mestizos&quot;), most of whom were merchants and traders. They paid about twice the amount of taxes than natives, but less taxes than someone of full Chinese ancestry (the &quot;sangleyes&quot;).
Both &quot;mestizos de español&quot; and &quot;mestizos de sangley&quot; were often from wealthy families and thus part of the educated class in the late 19th century (the &quot;ilustrados&quot;). Along with children from wealthy native families, they played a prominent part in the Propaganda Movement (1880–1895), which called for reforms in the colonial government of the Philippines. &quot;Mestizos&quot; were a key demographic in the development of Filipino nationalism. During the 1700s, mixed Spanish Filipino Mestizos formed about 5% of the total tribute paying population whereas mixed Chinese Filipino Mestizos formed 20% of the population.
During the American occupation of the Philippines (1898–1946), the term expanded to include people of mixed native and American ancestry. 
In the modern Philippines, the Tagalog term &quot;&quot; (feminine &quot;mestisa&quot;) refers to anyone who has the fair-skinned appearance of mixed native and European ancestry, often used as a compliment. It is commonly shortened to &quot;&quot; (feminine &quot;tisay&quot;) in colloquial usage. &quot;Mestizo&quot; is also considered one of the archetypal beauty standards in the Philippines, the others being &quot;moreno&quot; (brown-skinned native appearance) and &quot;chinito&quot; (lighter-skinned East Asian appearance).

=== United States ===

In the United States, a number of Latino Americans of Mexican or Central American or South American descent have family histories bound to categories such as &quot;mestizaje&quot;. The term &quot;mestizo&quot; is not used for official purposes, with Mexican Americans being classed in roughly equal proportions as &quot;white&quot; or &quot;some other ethnicity&quot;.

A 2015 report by the Pew Research Center showed that &quot;When asked if they identify as &quot;mestizo,&quot; &quot;mulatto&quot; or some other mixed-race combination, one-third of U.S. Hispanics say they do&quot;. These were more likely to be U.S. born, non-Mexican, and have a higher education attainment than those who do not so identify.

==&quot;Mestizaje&quot; in Latin America==

 () is a term that came into usage in twentieth-century Latin America for racial mixing, not a colonial-era term. In the modern era, it is used to denote the positive unity of race mixtures in modern Latin America. This ideological stance is in contrast to the term &quot;miscegenation&quot;, which usually has negative connotations. The main ideological advocate of &quot;mestizaje&quot; was José Vasconcelos (1882–1959), the Mexican Minister of Education in the 1920s. The term was in circulation in Mexico in the late nineteenth century, along with similar terms, &quot;cruzamiento&quot; (&quot;crossing&quot;) and &quot;mestización&quot; (process of &quot;mestizo-izing&quot;). In Spanish America, the colonial-era system of castas sought to differentiate between individuals and groups on the basis of a hierarchical classification by ancestry, skin color, and status (&quot;calidad&quot;), giving separate labels to the perceived categorical differences and privileging whiteness. In contrast, the idea of modern &quot;mestizaje&quot; is the positive unity of a nation&#x27;s citizenry based on racial mixture. &quot;Mestizaje placed greater emphasis [than the casta system] on commonality and hybridity to engineer order and unity... [it] operated within the context of the nation-state and sought to derive meaning from Latin America&#x27;s own internal experiences rather than the dictates and necessities of empire... ultimately [it] embraced racial mixture.&quot;

===In post-revolution Mexico===
At independence in Mexico, the casta classifications were abolished, but discrimination based on skin color and socioeconomic status continued. Liberal intellectuals grappled with the &quot;Indian Problem&quot;, that is, the Amerindians&#x27; lack of cultural assimilation to Mexican national life as citizens of the nation, rather than members of their Indigenous communities. Urban elites spurned mixed-race urban plebeians and Amerindians along with their traditional popular culture. In the late nineteenth century during the rule of Porfirio Díaz, elites sought to be, act, and look like modern Europeans, that is, different from the majority of the Mexican population. Díaz was mixed-race himself, but powdered his dark skin to hide his Mixtec Indigenous ancestry. At the end of the nineteenth century, however, as social and economic tensions increased in Mexico, two major works by Mexican intellectuals sought to rehabilitate the assessment of the mestizo. Díaz&#x27;s Minister of Education, Justo Sierra published &quot;The Political Evolution of the Mexican People&quot; (1902), which situated Mexican identity in the mixing of European whites and Amerindians. Mexicans are &quot;the sons of two peoples, of two races. [This fact] dominates our whole history; to this we owe our soul.&quot; Intellectual Andrés Molina Enríquez also took a revisionist stance on Mestizos in his work &quot;Los grandes problemas nacionales&quot; (The Great National Problems) (1909).

The Mexican state after the Mexican Revolution (1910–20) embraced the ideology of mestizaje as a nation-building tool, aimed at integrating Amerindians culturally and politically in the construction of national identity. As such it has meant a systematic effort to eliminate Indigenous culture, in the name of integrating them into a supposedly inclusive mestizo identity. For Afro-Mexicans, the ideology has denied their historical contributions to Mexico and their current place in Mexican political life. Mexican politicians and reformers such as José Vasconcelos and Manuel Gamio were instrumental in building a Mexican national identity on the concept of &quot;mestizaje&quot; (the process of ethnic homogenization).

Cultural policies in early post-revolutionary Mexico were paternalistic towards the Indigenous people, with efforts designed to &quot;help&quot; Indigenous peoples achieve the same level of progress as the mestizo society, eventually assimilating Indigenous peoples completely to mainstream Mexican culture, working toward the goal of eventually solving the &quot;Indian problem&quot; by transforming Indigenous communities into mestizo communities.

In recent years, Mestizos&#x27; sole claim to Mexican national identity has begun to erode, at least rhetorically.&quot; A constitutional changes to Article 4 that now says that the &quot;Mexican Nation has a pluricultural composition, originally based on its Indigenous peoples. The law will protect and promote the development of their languages, cultures, uses, customs, resources, and specific forms of social organization and will guarantee their members effective access to the jurisdiction of the State.&quot;

===Elsewhere in Latin America===
There has been considerable academic work on race and race mixture in various parts of Latin America in recent years. Including South America; Venezuela Brazil, Peru and Colombia.

==Mestizos migrating to Europe==
Martín Cortés, son of the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés and of the Nahuatl–Maya Indigenous Mexican interpreter Malinche, was one of the first documented mestizos to arrive in Spain. His first trip occurred in 1528, when he accompanied his father who sought to have him legitimized by Pope Clement VII, the Pope of Rome from 1523 to 1534.

There is also verified evidence of the grandchildren of Moctezuma II, Aztec emperor, whose royal descent the Spanish Crown acknowledged, willingly having set foot on European soil. Among these descendants are the Counts of Miravalle, and the Dukes of Moctezuma de Tultengo, who became part of the Spanish peerage and left many descendants in Europe. The Counts of Miravalle, residing in Andalucía, Spain, demanded in 2003 that the government of Mexico recommence payment of the so-called &quot;Moctezuma pensions&quot; it had cancelled in 1934.

The mestizo historian Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, son of Spanish conquistador Sebastián Garcilaso de la Vega and of the Inca princess Isabel Chimpo Oclloun, arrived in Spain from Peru. He lived in the town of Montilla, Andalucía, where he died in 1616.
