<text>MSNBC is an American cable news channel owned by the NBCUniversal News Group division of NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast. Launched on July 15, 1996, and headquartered at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in Manhattan, the channel primarily broadcasts rolling news coverage and liberal-leaning political commentary. 

MSNBC was originally established as part of a joint venture between NBC News and Microsoft (with its name being a portmanteau of MSN and NBC), encompassing the channel and the news website MSNBC.com. Microsoft would divest its stake in the channel in 2005, followed by the website in 2012; the website was then rebranded as NBCNews.com to associate it more closely with the NBC News division, leaving MSNBC.com to become a website for the channel and its opinion content. 

MSNBC initially focused on rolling news coverage, including long-form reports, interactive programs, and stories contributed by the local news departments of NBC&#x27;s affiliates. By the late-2000s, MSNBC shifted to primarily airing opinion-based programming featuring liberal commentators such as Keith Olbermann, Chris Matthews, David Gregory, Ed Schultz, and Rachel Maddow; in 2010, MSNBC would beat CNN in primetime and overall viewership for the first time since 2001. In the mid-2010s, amid a decline in viewership, MSNBC increased its focus on hard news coverage, and added programs incorporating NBC News personalities. Under new leadership, MSNBC gradually decreased its reliance on NBC News personalities in the early-2020s, and began expanding opinion programming in its morning and weekend lineups.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, MSNBC was the second most-watched cable news network in the U.S., averaging 792,000 total day viewers, behind rival Fox News, which averaged 1.212 million viewers, and ahead of CNN, which averaged 502,000 viewers. In 2023, MSNBC&#x27;s top five highest-rated shows were &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot;, &quot;The Last Word with Lawrence O&#x27;Donnell&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Beat with Ari Melber&quot;, and &quot;All in with Chris Hayes&quot;. In November 2023, MSNBC&#x27;s most watched nightly shows were &quot;The Beat with Ari Melber&quot; and &quot;Deadline: White House;&quot; &quot;The Beat&quot; was &quot;the highest-rated non-Fox News show in the demo&quot; on cable news, &quot;AdWeek&quot; reported, averaging around 1.8 million viewers that year.

==History==
===Development===
MSNBC was established in 1996 under a strategic partnership between NBC and Microsoft. NBC executive Tom Rogers was instrumental in developing the partnership. James Kinsella, a Microsoft executive, served as president of the online component, MSNBC.com, and represented the technology company in the joint venture. Microsoft invested $221 million for a 50 percent share of the cable channel. MSNBC and Microsoft shared the cost of a $200 million newsroom in Secaucus, New Jersey, for msnbc.com. The network took over the channel space of NBC&#x27;s two-year-old America&#x27;s Talking (AT) network, although in most cases cable carriage had to be negotiated with providers who had never carried AT.

===1996–2007===

MSNBC was launched on July 15, 1996. The first show was anchored by Jodi Applegate and included news, interviews, and commentary. During the day, rolling news coverage continued with &quot;The Contributors&quot;, a show that featured Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham, as well as interactive programming coordinated by Applegate, John Gibson, and John Seigenthaler. Stories were generally longer and more detailed than the stories CNN was running. NBC also highlighted their broadcast connections by airing stories directly from NBC&#x27;s network affiliates, along with breaking news coverage from the same sources.

MSNBC gradually increased its emphasis on politics. After completing its seven-year survey of cable channels, the Project for Excellence in Journalism said in 2007 that &quot;MSNBC is moving to make politics a brand, with a large dose of opinion and personality.&quot;

In January 2001, Mike Barnicle&#x27;s MSNBC show started, but it was canceled in June 2001 because of high production costs. In June, Microsoft chief executive officer Steve Ballmer said that he would not have started MSNBC had he foreseen the difficulty of attracting viewers.

After the September 11, 2001, attacks, NBC used MSNBC as an outlet for the up-to-the-minute coverage being provided by NBC News as a supplement to the longer stories on broadcast NBC. With little financial news to cover, CNBC and CNBC Europe ran MSNBC for many hours each day following the attacks. The year also boosted the profile of Ashleigh Banfield, who was present during the collapse of Building 7 while covering the World Trade Center on September 11. Her &quot;Region in Conflict&quot; program capitalized on her newfound celebrity and showcased exclusive interviews from Afghanistan.

In the aftermath of September 11, MSNBC began calling itself &quot;America&#x27;s NewsChannel&quot; and hired opinionated hosts like Alan Keyes, Phil Donahue, Pat Buchanan, and Tucker Carlson. This branding makeover, however, was followed by declining ratings.

On December 23, 2005, NBC Universal announced its acquisition of an additional 32 percent share of MSNBC from Microsoft, which solidified its control over television operations and allowed NBC to further consolidate MSNBC&#x27;s backroom operations with NBC News and its other cable properties. (The news website msnbc.com remained a separate joint venture between Microsoft and NBC for another seven years.) NBC later exercised its option to purchase Microsoft&#x27;s remaining 18 percent interest in MSNBC.

In late 2005, MSNBC began attracting liberal and progressive viewers as Keith Olbermann began critiquing and satirizing conservative media commentators during his &quot;Countdown With Keith Olbermann&quot; program. He especially focused his attention on the Fox News Channel and Bill O&#x27;Reilly, its principal primetime commentator.

On June 7, 2006, Rick Kaplan resigned as president of MSNBC after holding the post for two years. Five days later, Dan Abrams, a nine-year veteran of MSNBC and NBC News, was named general manager of MSNBC with immediate effect. NBC News senior vice president Phil Griffin would oversee MSNBC while continuing to oversee NBC News&#x27; &quot;Today&quot; program, with Abrams reporting to Griffin.

On June 29, 2006, Abrams announced the revamp of MSNBC&#x27;s early-primetime and primetime schedule. On July 10, &quot;Tucker&quot; (formerly &quot;The Situation with Tucker Carlson&quot;) started airing at 4 p.m. and 6 pm. ET (taking over Abrams&#x27; old timeslot), while Rita Cosby&#x27;s &quot;Live &amp; Direct&quot; was canceled. Cosby was made the primary anchor for &quot;MSNBC Investigates&quot; at 10 and 11 pm. ET, a new program that took over Cosby and Carlson&#x27;s timeslots. According to the press release, &quot;MSNBC Investigates&quot; promised to &quot;complement MSNBC&#x27;s existing programming by building on [the channel&#x27;s] library of award-winning documentaries.&quot; The move to taped programming during 10 and 11 p.m. probably resulted from MSNBC&#x27;s successful Friday &quot;experiment&quot; of replacing all primetime programming with taped specials.

On September 24, 2007, Abrams announced that he was leaving his general manager position so he could focus on his 9:00 pm. ET talk show, &quot;Live With Dan Abrams&quot;. Oversight of MSNBC was shifted to Phil Griffin, a senior vice president at NBC.


MSNBC and NBC News began broadcasting from their new studios at NBC&#x27;s 30 Rockefeller Plaza complex in New York City on October 22, 2007. The extensive renovations of the associated studios allowed NBC to merge its entire news operation into one building. All MSNBC broadcasts and &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; originate from the new studios. More than 12.5 hours of live television across the NBC News family originate from the New York studios daily. MSNBC also announced new studios near the Universal Studios lot. MSNBC&#x27;s master control did not make the move to 30 Rock. It remained in the old Secaucus headquarters until it completed its move to the NBC Universal Network Origination Center located inside the CNBC Global Headquarters building in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey in 2007.

Major League Baseball uses the former MSNBC building for MLB Network, which launched from the facility on January 1, 2009.

=== 2008–2015 ===

From mid-2007 to mid-2008, MSNBC enjoyed a large increase in its Nielsen ratings. Primetime viewings increased by 61 percent. In May 2008, NBC News president Steve Capus said, &quot;It used to be people didn&#x27;t have to worry about MSNBC because it was an also-ran cable channel... That&#x27;s not the case anymore.&quot; Tim Russert&#x27;s sudden death in June 2008 removed the person whom &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; called the &quot;rudder for the network&quot; and led to a period of transition.

During the 2008 presidential election, MSNBC&#x27;s coverage was anchored by Olbermann, Chris Matthews, and David Gregory. They were widely viewed as the face of the channel&#x27;s political coverage. During the first three months of the presidential campaign, MSNBC&#x27;s ratings grew by 158 percent. Olbermann and Matthews, however, were criticized for expressing left-leaning opinions on the channel. Both were later removed from their anchor positions. Audience viewership during the 2008 presidential campaign more than doubled from the 2004 presidential election, and the channel topped CNN in ratings for the first time during the last three months of the campaign in the key 25–54 age demographic.

In September 2008, the channel hired political analyst and Air America Radio personality Rachel Maddow to host &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot;. The move to create a new program for the channel was widely seen as a well-calculated ratings move, where beforehand, MSNBC lagged behind in coveted primetime ratings. The show regularly outperformed CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, and made the channel competitive in the program&#x27;s time slot for the first time in over a decade.

In the first quarter of 2010, MSNBC beat CNN in primetime and overall ratings for the first time since 2001. The channel also beat CNN in total adult viewers in March, marking the seventh out of the past eight months that MSNBC achieved that result. In addition, the programs &quot;Morning Joe&quot;, &quot;The Ed Show&quot;, &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot;, &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;, and &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot; finished ahead of their time slot competitors at CNN.

In the third quarter of 2010, MSNBC continued its solid lead over CNN, beating the network in total day for the first time since the second quarter of 2001 in the key adult demographic. The network also beat CNN for the fourth consecutive quarter, among both primetime and total viewers, as well as becoming the only cable news network to have its key adult demographic viewership grow over the last quarter, increasing by 4 percent. During this time, MSNBC also became the number-one cable news network in primetime among both African American and Hispanic viewers.

On October 11, 2010, MSNBC unveiled a new $2 million marketing campaign, &quot;Lean Forward&quot;; MSNBC president Phil Griffin considered the two-year campaign an effort to promote the channel as a progressive competitor to the conservative-leaning Fox News Channel, explaining that &quot;we&#x27;ve taken on CNN and we beat them,&quot; and that the new slogan was &quot;about making tomorrow better than today, a discussion about politics and the actions and passions of our time.&quot; 

On January 21, 2011, Olbermann announced his departure from MSNBC and the episode would be the final episode of &quot;Countdown&quot;. His departure received much media attention. MSNBC issued a statement that it had ended its contract with Olbermann, with no further explanation. Olbermann later revealed that he had taken his show to Current TV.

On July 16, 2012, Microsoft sold its stake in MSNBC.com to NBCUniversal; concurrently, the website was rebranded as NBCNews.com to associate it with the NBC News division as a whole, while MSNBC.com was later relaunched as a website for the channel itself. Concerns had previously been raised by NBC News executives over potential confusion between the two properties due to their diverging editorial scopes, as MSNBC.com had largely remained a general-interest news website despite the channel&#x27;s pivot towards political commentary. NBCUniversal News Group was created on July 19, 2012, under chairwoman Pat Fili-Krushel. It has been the news division of NBCUniversal. It is composed of the NBC News, CNBC and MSNBC units.

During 2014, MSNBC&#x27;s total ratings in the 25–54 demographic declined 20 percent, falling to third place behind CNN. Nevertheless, MSNBC retained its lead among the Hispanic and African-American demographics.

===2015–2021===

Andrew Lack became the chairman of NBC News and MSNBC in 2015; he would impose a mandate on the network to reduce its emphasis on opinion programming, and place a larger focus on creating closer ties between it and the NBC News division.

In 2015, to help revive the struggling network, Griffin announced he was transitioning MSNBC from left-leaning, opinionated programming to hard news programming. Nearly all daytime opinionated news programs were replaced with more generic news programs. Ronan Farrow, Joy Reid, Krystal Ball, Touré, Abby Huntsman, Alex Wagner, and Ed Schultz lost their shows. Al Sharpton&#x27;s &quot;PoliticsNation&quot; was relegated to the weekend. News programs presented by established NBC News personalities such as Telemundo anchor Jose Diaz-Balart, &quot;Meet the Press&quot; anchor Chuck Todd, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; Sunday anchor Kate Snow, Thomas Roberts, and former &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; anchor Brian Williams replaced the opinion shows. The revamped on-air presentation debuted in late summer 2015 and included a new logo, news ticker, and graphics package.

&quot;MSNBC Live&quot; had at least eight hours of programming each day, barring any breaking news that could extend its time. Daytime news coverage was led primarily by Brian Williams, Stephanie Ruhle, Jose Diaz-Balart, Andrea Mitchell, Craig Melvin, Thomas Roberts, and Kate Snow, in addition to &quot;beat leaders&quot; stationed throughout the newsroom. These included chief legal correspondent Ari Melber, primary political reporter Steve Kornacki, business and finance correspondent Olivia Sterns, and senior editor Cal Perry. Morning and primetime programming did not change and remained filled mostly by opinionated personalities.

In April 2016, MSNBC launched a promotional ad campaign with the theme, &quot;in order to know beyond, you have to go beyond.&quot; The campaign portrayed MSNBC&#x27;s reporting and perspectives as &quot;in depth&quot; and an alternative to &quot;talking points&quot; coverage on other cable news outlets. A new tagline &quot;This is who we are&quot; appeared on MSNBC in June 2016. Promotional campaigns including the slogan were aired in March 2017.

In July 2016, the network debuted &quot;Dateline Extra&quot;, which was an abridged version of &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; and another step towards aligning MSNBC and NBC News. The new program was hosted by &quot;MSNBC Live&quot; anchor Tamron Hall.

In September 2016, MSNBC launched &quot;The 11th Hour with Brian Williams&quot; as a nightly wrap-up of the day&#x27;s news and a preview of the following day&#x27;s headlines. This was MSNBC&#x27;s first new primetime program in nearly four years.

In January 2017, MSNBC debuted a program in the 6 pm ET hour entitled &quot;For the Record with Greta&quot;, hosted by former Fox News Channel anchor Greta Van Susteren. The program aired for six months before being cancelled in late June 2017. The network promoted Ari Melber, the network&#x27;s chief legal correspondent, to host &quot;The Beat with Ari Melber&quot; at 6 pm.

In March 2017, MSNBC began to increase its use of the NBC News branding during daytime news programming, as part of an effort to emphasize MSNBC&#x27;s relationship with the division. On May 8, 2017, MSNBC introduced a new late-afternoon program, &quot;&quot;, hosted by NBC political analyst and former White House communications director Nicolle Wallace. That month, amid the first presidency of Donald Trump, MSNBC became the highest rated American cable news network in primetime for the first time. MSNBC&#x27;s increasing viewership was accompanied by declining numbers at Fox News Channel. MSNBC&#x27;s May 15–19 programming topped the programming of both CNN and Fox News in total viewers and viewers 18–49.

On April 16, 2018, MSNBC premiered a new early morning program, &quot;Morning Joe First Look&quot;, to replace &quot;Way Too Early&quot;. The same day, MSNBC also retired its on-air news ticker, citing a desire to reduce distractions and &quot;[put] our reporting more front and center&quot;. As of September 2018, approximately 87 million households in the United States (90.7 percent of pay television subscribers) were receiving MSNBC.

On March 2, 2020, Chris Matthews abruptly announced his resignation from &quot;Hardball&quot; and MSNBC effective immediately, amid controversy over remarks he made during coverage of the Nevada Democratic caucuses that compared Bernie Sanders&#x27; victory to the German invasion of France. The hour was hosted by a rotation of anchors until July 20, when MSNBC premiered &quot;The ReidOut&quot; with Joy Reid.

On December 7, 2020, MSNBC announced that Rashida Jones would succeed Griffin as president in 2021. Jones stated goals to increase the network&#x27;s investment into documentary-style programs, and to have viewers &quot;clearly understand&quot; the differences and value of its news-based and analysis-driven programming, as both were &quot;critical to our future success&quot;, and &quot;need to exist in a clear and compelling form on every single platform where news consumers go.&quot; As part of this remit, Jones named separate senior vice presidents for news programming and &quot;perspective and analysis&quot; programming.

In January 2021, MSNBC had its highest-rated week ever in the wake of the January 6 United States Capitol attack, exceeding the ratings of Fox News for the first time since 2000.

=== 2021–2024 ===

On March 29, 2021, MSNBC introduced a refreshed logo and on-air imaging, including a rebranding of its &quot;MSNBC Live&quot; rolling news block as &quot;MSNBC Reports&quot; (with each block carrying the anchor&#x27;s name, patterned after the existing daytime show &quot;Andrea Mitchell Reports&quot;). Under Jones, MSNBC also began to scale back its tighter integrations with NBC News, with some personalities and reporters leaving the network, or prioritizing contributions to NBC News&#x27; streaming channel NBC News Now instead.

In July 2021, MSNBC gained a presence on NBCUniversal&#x27;s Peacock streaming service by co-branding its streaming hub &quot;The Choice&quot; as &quot;The Choice by MSNBC&quot;; it included original news and opinion programs with personalities such as Mehdi Hasan, Zerlina Maxwell, and Sam Seder.

Brian Williams departed the network in late 2021 and was succeeded on &quot;The 11th Hour&quot; by Stephanie Ruhle. Meanwhile, as part of her new contract with NBCUniversal, Rachel Maddow took an extended hiatus from her program to focus on other film and podcast projects, with rotating guest hosts filling in for her. Upon Maddow&#x27;s return, she announced that she would only host the show on Monday nights beginning in May 2022, and continue to feature guest hosts throughout the rest of the week. The guest hosts appeared under the &quot;MSNBC Prime&quot; banner until August 16, 2022, when Alex Wagner became the permanent host in the timeslot with the premiere of &quot;Alex Wagner Tonight&quot;.

On March 10, 2022, it was announced that MSNBC would launch a hub on Peacock to subsume The Choice by MSNBC, including next-day, on-demand streaming of selected MSNBC programs, as well as specials and documentaries.

By 2022, MSNBC had begun to partly scale back its focus on hard news programming, including expanding &quot;Morning Joe&quot; with a fourth hour (displacing an hour of &quot;MSNBC Reports&quot; anchored by Stephanie Ruhle, who moved to &quot;The 11th Hour&quot; to succeed Brian Williams). Ahead of the mid-term elections, &quot;The Last Word with Lawrence O&#x27;Donnell&quot; was temporarily replaced on Friday evenings from October 14 to November 8, 2022, by &quot;The Kornacki Countdown&quot;, a weekly series hosted by MSNBC political correspondent and analyst Steve Kornacki. On March 19, 2023, MSNBC premiered the new Sunday-morning program &quot;Inside with Jen Psaki&quot;, which is hosted by the former White House press secretary. Between February and September 2023, the Monday edition of &quot;All in with Chris Hayes&quot; also featured rotating guest hosts, with Chris Hayes only hosting from Tuesdays to Fridays to accommodate Hayes&#x27; other projects. On September 7, 2023, it was announced that the program would be replaced by an additional Monday-night edition of &quot;Inside with Jen Psaki&quot; beginning September 25.&quot;&quot;

On January 13, 2024, MSNBC revamped its weekend schedule, ending Mehdi Hasan&#x27;s 9 p.m. ET show on Sundays and introducing an ensemble show—&quot;The Weekend&quot;—hosted by Alicia Menendez, Symone Sanders-Townsend, and Michael Steele from 8–10 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday mornings. The revamp would also end &quot;Yasmin Vossoughian Reports&quot;, &quot;Symone&quot;, and &quot;American Voices&quot;, and move &quot;The&quot; &quot;Sunday/Saturday Show&quot; &quot;with Jonathan Capehart&quot; into the 6  p.m. slot and &quot;The Katie Phang Show&quot; to 12  p.m. on Saturdays. &quot;Ayman&quot; would also expand to two hours each on Saturdays and Sundays, and &quot;Alex Witt Reports&quot; would take over Yasmin Vossoughian&#x27;s vacated two hours, now airing from 1–4  p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. The 5 p.m. hour would be filled by the week-in-review shows &quot;The Beat Weekend&quot; and &quot;MSNBC Prime Weekend&quot; on Saturday and Sunday, which air highlights from &quot;The Beat&quot; and MSNBC&#x27;s weekday lineup respectively.

=== 2025–present ===
On November 20, 2024, NBCUniversal announced its intent to spin off most of its cable networks, including MSNBC, as a new publicly traded company controlled by Comcast shareholders. It was initially unclear how the spin-off will affect MSNBC, including whether it will still be able to use NBC News resources or the NBC brand. Following the announcement, reports emerged of unsolicited offers to buy MSNBC from several parties; CNN media analyst Brian Stelter believed it was unlikely MSNBC would be sold, as NBCUniversal never declared any intent to divest properties when announcing the spin-off (with future CEO Mark Lazarus contrarily suggesting that the spin-off planned to target further investments and acquisitions), a sale would incur taxes (the spin-off is being structured to be tax-free), and that divesting the channel might not be seen as being in the best interest of shareholders. 

On January 13, 2025, it was announced that &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot; would temporarily return to a weeknight schedule from January 20 through April 30, to cover the first hundred days of the second presidency of Donald Trump. During this time, Alex Wagner would be placed on special assignment duty. On January 14, 2025, it was announced that Jones would step down as head of MSNBC. NBCUniversal executive Mark Lazarus also stated that MSNBC would be allowed to continue using its existing brand after the spin-off. After acting as interim president, Rebecca Kutler was appointed president of MSNBC in February 2025. 

Kutler was reported to have been focusing upon expanding MSNBC&#x27;s newsgathering resources in preparation for the spin-off, including the establishment of a dedicated Washington bureau, as well as a realignment of its weekday lineup. On February 24, 2025, Kutler announced upcoming changes to the network&#x27;s lineups; &quot;The ReidOut&quot; was cancelled, with Joy Reid leaving the network after that night&#x27;s episode. Her hour will be filled by rotating anchors in the interim, until the premiere of a new 7 p.m. show hosted by &quot;The Weekend&quot;″s panel of Alicia Menendez, Symone Sanders-Townsend, and Michael Steele. The new program will also substitute for &quot;All In&quot; on Mondays.

&quot;Alex Wagner Tonight&quot; will be replaced by a new show hosted by Jen Psaki; Wagner will remain with MSNBC as a senior political correspondent. Changes were also announced to the &quot;MSNBC Reports&quot; block, with José Díaz-Balart departing the network, and Ana Cabrera, Chris Jansing, and Katy Tur&#x27;s blocks each expanded to two hours. On weekends, &quot;Velshi&quot; will be expanded to three hours, while &quot;The Weekend&quot; will adopt new panels—with Jonathan Capehart to join the morning edition, and Ayman Mohyeldin to join a new 6 p.m. edition.

== Ratings and reception ==
In September 2018, approximately. 87 million households in the United States were receiving MSNBC, amounting to 90.7 percent of pay television subscribers. Nielsen ratings showed that MSNBC ranked second among basic cable networks, averaging 1.8 million viewers in 2019, behind rival Fox News.

In 2022, average weekday primetime viewership was 1.2 million, compared to rival Fox News&#x27;s 2.3 million, a decline of 21% from the previous year, and with 148,000 viewers in the &quot;key demographic&quot; of viewers aged 25–54. In 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that &quot;The Beat&quot; was one of the two &quot;most-watched news programs on cable&quot;, alongside &quot;The Five&quot; on Fox News.

During the first night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention, MSNBC had an average viewership of over 5 million, the highest among three major cable news networks and ahead of CNN.

=== Demographics ===
A 2014 Pew Research Center study found that MSNBC&#x27;s audience was more moderate than that of BuzzFeed, &quot;Politico&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, but slightly more liberal than CNN&#x27;s audience.

A 2019 Pew Research Center survey showed that among Americans who named MSNBC as their main source for political news, 74% are ages 50 or older, with 44% ages 65 or older. 95% of those who named MSNBC as their main political news source identify as Democrats; among the eight most commonly named main sources for political and election news by US adults, MSNBC and Fox News have the most partisan audiences.

== Carriage issues ==
Before 2010, MSNBC was not available to Verizon FiOS and AT&amp;T U-verse television subscribers in the portions of New York, northern New Jersey, and Connecticut that overlapped Cablevision&#x27;s service area. One of several reasons for this was an exclusive carriage agreement between MSNBC and Cablevision that prohibited competing wired providers from carrying MSNBC. The terms of the agreement were not publicly known.

In 2009, Verizon filed a formal &quot;program-access complaint&quot; with the Federal Communications Commission and petitioned for termination of the deal. In support of Verizon, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal argued that the arrangement could be illegal. After entering into a new contract, FiOS added the channel in New York City and New Jersey on February 2, 2010.

==MSNBC International==
In southern Africa, MSNBC is distributed free-to-air on satellite on Free2View TV as MSNBC Africa, a joint venture between Great Media Limited and MSNBC. Free2View airs MSNBC&#x27;s programming from 4 p.m. to midnight ET in a block that repeats twice (live for the first airing), with local Weather Channel forecasts.

In Australia, MSNBC launched November 2019 on the Fetch TV online PayTV network, on channel 171. As in Canada, this is a direct US feed of MSNBC, without any delay. Although Fetch TV has no MSNBC catchup channel/service, it also offers MSNBC programs on a reverse EPG which allows any shows from the previous 24 hours to be selected and watched. The channel was added to subscription-television outlet Foxtel and its streaming service Flash in April 2023, as part of a negotiated programming agreement between the Foxtel Group and NBCUniversal. It was also added to Binge, another of Foxtel&#x27;s streaming services, in October 2023.

In Asia and Europe, MSNBC is not shown on a dedicated channel. When MSNBC started in 1996, they announced plans to start broadcasting in Europe during 1997. This never happened although MSNBC was seen occasionally on affiliate channel CNBC Europe until the end of the 2000s, showing the channel overnight at the weekend and during the afternoon on American public holidays as well as during breaking news events.

In Turkey, NTV-MSNBC is the news channel of the Turkish broadcaster NTV Turkey. The channel is a joint partnership between the two, although very little Turkish content is shown on English MSNBC. English content on MSNBC is translated into Turkish.

== Online ==

MSNBC and its website msnbc.com were launched concurrently. Unlike the network, msnbc.com was operated as the general online news outlet of NBC News in partnership with Microsoft&#x27;s MSN.com portal. The network and website were editorially separate at the time.

In July 2012, NBC acquired Microsoft&#x27;s remaining stake in msnbc.com, which was re-launched in 2013 as the website for MSNBC. The website included news, videos, essays and opinion columns.

YouTube

MSNBC is one of the larger US news publishers on YouTube, with 6 million subscribers and &quot;the highest number of views per subscriber&quot; of any news account. Other news accounts have higher total views, including Fox News and Vox. MSNBC&#x27;s most watched shows online through YouTube include The Beat with Ari Melber, The Rachel Maddow Show, and Deadline: White House.

===Shift===
In July 2014, msnbc.com launched &quot;msnbc2&quot;, a brand for several web-only series hosted by MSNBC personalities. In December 2014, msnbc2 was renamed &quot;shift&quot;, with a programming schedule that was less focused on politics and more tailored to a younger audience.

==Radio==
MSNBC launched on XM Satellite Radio channel 120 and Sirius Satellite Radio channel 90 on April 12, 2010. This is the second time MSNBC has been available on satellite radio. The channel was dropped from XM Radio on September 4, 2006.

The simulcast of MSNBC&#x27;s programming is on SiriusXM channel 118.

==Controversies==
===Liberal bias===
, MSNBC&#x27;s evening programming features progressive hosts. In November 2007, a &quot;New York Times&quot; article stated that MSNBC&#x27;s primetime lineup was tilting more to the left. Since then, commentators have argued that MSNBC has a bias towards liberal politics and the Democratic Party. &quot;Washington Post&quot; media analyst Howard Kurtz said in 2008 that the channel&#x27;s evening lineup &quot;has clearly gravitated to the left in recent years and often seems to regard itself as the antithesis of Fox News.&quot; In 2011, &quot;Politico&quot; referred to MSNBC as &quot;left-leaning&quot;, and Steve Kornacki of &quot;Salon.com&quot; stated that, &quot;MSNBC&#x27;s prime-time lineup is now awash in progressive politics.&quot; Regarding changes in the channel&#x27;s evening programming, senior vice president of NBC News Phil Griffin said that &quot;it happened naturally. There isn&#x27;t a dogma we&#x27;re putting through. There is a &#x27;Go for it.

In the February 2008 issue of &quot;Men&#x27;s Journal&quot; magazine, an MSNBC interviewee quoted a senior executive as saying that liberal commentator Keith Olbermann &quot;runs MSNBC&quot; and that &quot;because of his success, he&#x27;s in charge&quot; of the channel. In 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Olbermann MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;most recognizable face&quot;. In September 2008, MSNBC stated that Olbermann and Chris Matthews would no longer anchor live political events, with David Gregory assuming that role. MSNBC cited the growing criticism that they were &quot;too opinionated to be seen as neutral in the heat of the presidential campaign.&quot; Olbermann&#x27;s show &quot;Countdown&quot; continued to run before and after the presidential and vice presidential debates, and both Matthews and Olbermann joined Gregory on the channel&#x27;s election night coverage.

On November 13, 2009, in the days leading up to the release of 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin&#x27;s book &quot;Going Rogue&quot;, MSNBC&#x27;s Dylan Ratigan used photoshopped pictures of Palin on the channel&#x27;s &quot;Morning Meeting&quot; program. Ratigan apologized a few days later.

In October 2010, MSNBC began using the tagline &quot;Lean Forward&quot;. Some media outlets, including msnbc.com, claimed that the network was now embracing its politically progressive identity.

In January 2012, MSNBC used Rachel Maddow, Chris Matthews, and other network commentators during its coverage of the Iowa Republican caucuses. Nando Di Fino of the Mediaite website said MSNBC was &quot;giving up on the straight news coverage, and instead [appearing] to be aiming to create some controversy.&quot;

In November 2012, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called MSNBC &quot;The Anti-Fox&quot; and quoted former President Bill Clinton as saying, &quot;Boy, it really has become our version of Fox.&quot; Citing data from the A.C. Nielsen TV ratings service, the article noted that while the Fox News Channel had a larger overall viewership than MSNBC, the two networks were separated by only around 300,000 viewers among the 25–54 age bracket most attractive to advertisers.

In the Pew Research Center&#x27;s 2013 &quot;State of the News Media&quot; report, MSNBC was found to be the most opinionated news network, with 85 percent of the content being commentary or opinions and the remaining 15 percent being factual reporting. The report also stated that in 2012, MSNBC spent only $240 million on news production compared to CNN&#x27;s $682 million and the Fox News Channel&#x27;s $820 million.

In October 2019, American socialist magazine &quot;Jacobin&quot; argued that &quot;MSNBC embodies the politics and sensibility of Trump-era liberalism.&quot;, but argued that MSNBC &quot;wasn&#x27;t always liberal.&quot;

Writing for the Poynter Institute for Media Studies in February 2021, senior media writer Tom Jones argued that the primary distinction between MSNBC and Fox News is not left bias vs. right bias, but rather that much of the content on Fox News, especially during its primetime programs, is not based in truth.

Under NBC News head Cesar Conde, the division had made moves to incorporate more diverse viewpoints—including from conservative perspectives—in its output outside of MSNBC (including &quot;Meet the Press&quot;) to counter concerns from NBC&#x27;s affiliate body that MSNBC&#x27;s partisan content reflected upon the division as a whole. These moves coincided with MSNBC&#x27;s own changes in leadership, which resulted in a gradual increase in opinion programming, and as a result, a gradual decrease in talent sharing with the remainder of NBC News.

====Obama era====
Some Democratic Party supporters, including former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell and Bill Clinton advisor Lanny Davis, criticized MSNBC during and after the 2008 Democratic Party primaries as covering Barack Obama more favorably than Hillary Clinton. Rendell said, &quot;MSNBC was the official network of the Obama campaign,&quot; and called their coverage &quot;absolutely embarrassing&quot;. Rendell later became an on-air contributor to MSNBC.

A study done by the Project for Excellence in Journalism showed that MSNBC had less negative coverage of Obama (14 percent of stories versus 29 percent in the press overall) and more negative stories about Republican presidential candidate John McCain (73 percent of its coverage versus 57 percent in the press overall). MSNBC&#x27;s on-air slogan during the week of the 2008 presidential election, &quot;The Power of Change&quot;, was criticized for being too similar to Obama&#x27;s campaign slogan of &quot;Hope and Change&quot;. After the election, conservative talk show host John Ziegler made a documentary entitled &quot;Media Malpractice... How Obama Got Elected&quot;, which was very critical of the media&#x27;s role, especially MSNBC&#x27;s, in the election. While promoting the documentary, he had an on-air dispute with MSNBC news anchor Contessa Brewer about how the media, especially MSNBC, had portrayed Sarah Palin.

During MSNBC&#x27;s coverage of the Potomac primary, MSNBC&#x27;s Chris Matthews said, &quot;I have to tell you, you know, it&#x27;s part of reporting this case, this election, the feeling most people get when they hear Barack Obama&#x27;s speech. My, I felt this thrill going up my leg. I mean, I don&#x27;t have that too often.&quot; This led Fox News to assert that both he and MSNBC were biased toward Obama.

====&quot;Rise of the New Right&quot; documentary====
In June 2010, the MSNBC documentary &quot;Rise of the New Right&quot; aired. It featured interviews with right-wing figures, including Dick Armey, the former House majority leader, Orly Taitz, a leading figure in the &quot;birther&quot; movement, and conspiracy theorist radio host Alex Jones. The documentary also showed the Michigan Militia&#x27;s survival training camp and hit the campaign trail with Kentucky senatorial candidate Rand Paul.

The documentary angered Tea Party movement figures and others on the right. After the documentary aired, FreedomWorks, chaired by Armey, called for a boycott of Dawn and Procter &amp; Gamble, which advertised during &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot;. The attempted boycott was ineffective as Procter &amp; Gamble continued to advertise on the show.

====Romney coverage during 2012 election====
A study by the Pew Research Center&#x27;s Project for Excellence in Journalism found that MSNBC&#x27;s coverage of Mitt Romney during the final week of the 2012 presidential campaign (68 percent negative with no positive stories in the sample) was far more negative than the overall press, and even more negative than it had been during October 1 to 28, when 5 percent was positive, and 57 percent was negative. On the other hand, their coverage of Barack Obama improved in the final week before the presidential election. From 1 to October 28, 33 percent of stories were positive and 13 percent negative. During the campaign&#x27;s final week, 51 percent of MSNBC&#x27;s stories were positive, while there were no negative stories about Obama in the sample.

===Allegations of conservative bias===
Others have argued that MSNBC has a bias against progressive politics. Phil Donahue&#x27;s show was canceled in 2003 due to his opposition to the Iraq War, and Donahue later commented that the management of MSNBC required that &quot;we have two conservative (guests) for every liberal. I was counted as two liberals.&quot; Cenk Uygur, after his departure from MSNBC in 2011, said that MSNBC management had told him &quot;people in Washington&quot; were &quot;concerned about [his] tone,&quot; and that he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to work in a place that didn&#x27;t challenge power.&quot;

Others have also noted that MSNBC anchors tended to be conservative or centrist and wealthy. For example, in 2000, host Joe Scarborough received a 95 rating from the American Conservative Union and supported anti-abortion policies when he was a U.S. representative, while host Stephanie Ruhle, a former hedge fund manager, declared, &quot;I don&#x27;t have any political ideals that I&#x27;m tied to.&quot; Former host Chris Matthews identifies as a &quot;liberal&quot; but voted for George W. Bush in 2000, while current host Nicolle Wallace, a registered Republican, worked for both Bush and Sarah Palin.

===Lack of diversity of views===
Maria Bustillos noted in 2019 that &quot;MSNBC&#x27;s bland, evenhanded respectability is buttressed with a careful performance of diversity both &#x27;ideological&#x27; and demographic&quot;, and that &quot;the network actively discourages consideration of its anchors&#x27; personal convictions&quot; in favor of &quot;interchangeable &#x27;television personalities&#x27;&quot; who are &quot;compressed into the network&#x27;s identity and subservient to it.&quot; It has been argued that MSNBC, like other cable networks, &quot;is simply not incentivized to be informative&quot;, and instead turns its &quot;viewers into partisan junkies who don&#x27;t change the channel because they need a fix that tells them they&#x27;re right about everything (and that the other side is wrong).&quot; Jason Linkins in 2014 claimed that MSNBC prefers &quot;the incessant production of insidery ideations&quot; over &quot;the service of the public trust in an honest and equitable way.&quot;

===Romney family grandchild===

Political commentator Melissa Harris-Perry and her guest panel, in a look back on the 2013 segment of her show, featured a picture of former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his extended family. Romney was holding on his knee his adopted grandchild, Kieran Romney, an African-American. Harris-Perry and her guests, including actress Pia Glenn and comedian Dean Obeidallah, joked about coming up with captions for the photo. Glenn sang out, &quot;One of these things is not like the others, one of these things just isn&#x27;t the same.&quot; Obeidallah said, &quot;It sums up the diversity of the Republican Party and the [Republican National Committee], where they have the whole convention and they find the one black person.&quot; Afterwards, Harris-Perry gave an on-air apology as well as apologized in a series of tweets.

=== Coverage of the 2020 Democratic primary ===
On February 2, 2019, NBC ran a story about presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard claiming that her campaign was benefiting from Russian state media, stating that she had received twice as many mentions on RT, Sputnik News and Russia Insider compared to expected front-runners Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden.

In March 2019, Yashar Ali, a journalist for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; accused Dafna Linzer, a managing editor at MSNBC, of ceding editorial control to the Democratic National Committee. Ali, who planned to announce the locations of the DNC debates in advance of MSNBC, received a call attempting to dissuade him with the phrase &quot;let them make a few phone calls,&quot; referring to party leaders. A source quoted by CNN stated that this approach was necessary for any network that has enough of a relationship with the DNC to host its debates.

Candidate Andrew Yang and his supporters have been critical of MSNBC&#x27;s coverage of his campaign and the speaking time allocated to Yang at a November 2019 primary debate hosted by MSNBC.

In December 2019, &quot;In These Times&quot; analyzed coverage of the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primary by MSNBC between August and September 2019. They said that &quot;MSNBC talked about Biden twice as often as Warren and three times as often as Sanders&quot;, and that Sanders was the candidate spoken of negatively the most frequently of the three.&quot;

MSNBC came under particular scrutiny during the first three primary-season state votes in 2020 due to historical references made by two of their hosts. Chris Matthews compared Sanders to George McGovern in terms of electability on February 3 and criticized Sanders for adopting the &quot;democratic socialist&quot; label on February 7. In reference to Sanders&#x27; praise of some aspects of Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba, Matthews said on air during &quot;Hardball&quot;, &quot;I believe if Castro and the Reds had won the Cold War there would have been executions in Central Park, and I might have been one of the ones executed&quot;. He then questioned what Sanders meant when he used the term &#x27;socialism&#x27;. The following week, Chuck Todd criticized the rhetoric of Sanders supporters by quoting a conservative article which compared them to Nazi brown shirts. Commenting on the 2020 Nevada Democratic caucuses, Matthews invoked &quot;the fall of France&quot; to the Nazis in 1940 as a metaphor for Sanders&#x27; apparent victory in the state. These analogies were criticized by the Sanders campaign and other commentators, who noted that members of Sanders&#x27; family had been murdered in the Holocaust. Matthews later issued an on-air apology to Sanders and his supporters.

Jason Johnson, an MSNBC contributor, was temporarily suspended in February 2020 after backlash over his accusing Bernie Sanders supporters of alienating minorities and saying of African-American Sanders staffers and surrogates, &quot;I don&#x27;t care how many people from the island of misfit black girls that you throw out to defend you on a regular basis.&quot; He was reinstated in July 2020.

=== Coverage of Israeli–Palestinian conflict ===
Ayman Mohyeldin has been alleged to have an anti-Israel bias in his reporting. In 2015, Mohyeldin was reporting live from Gaza, where he claimed to have witnessed an unarmed Palestinian man being shot by Israeli police at the Damascus Gate; the man turned out to be wielding a large knife.

Following the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, it was reported by &quot;Semafor&quot; that a number of Muslim hosts (including Mehdi Hasan, Mohyeldin, and Ali Velshi) were sidelined from coverage.

===Suspensions of hosts===

====Michael Savage====
Michael Savage briefly hosted a weekend talk show in 2003. That July, Savage responded to a prank caller on his show by calling him a &quot;pig&quot; and a &quot;sodomite&quot;, and telling him he &quot;should get AIDS and die.&quot; Savage&#x27;s show was canceled and he was dismissed from MSNBC shortly thereafter.

====Don Imus====
Don Imus&#x27; radio show &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; was simulcast on MSNBC for over ten years. In 2007, he described members of the Rutgers University women&#x27;s basketball team as &quot;some nappy-headed hoes.&quot; The remark was met with outrage, and advertisers withdrew from the show, with MSNBC canceling the simulcast. Both Imus and NBC News apologized to the Rutgers Basketball team for the remarks.

====Keith Olbermann and Joe Scarborough====
On November 5, 2010, MSNBC President Phil Griffin suspended Keith Olbermann indefinitely without pay for having contributed $2,400 (the maximum personal donation limit) to each of three Democratic Party candidates during the 2010 midterm election cycle. NBC News policy prohibited contributions to political campaigns unless NBC News had given its prior permission. On November 7, 2010, Olbermann posted a thank you message to supporters via Twitter. That same day, MSNBC announced that he would be back on the air starting on November 9.

Two weeks later, Griffin announced the suspension of Joe Scarborough for similar misconduct. The &quot;Morning Joe&quot; host had donated $4,000 to Republican candidates in Florida. Like Olbermann&#x27;s suspension, Scarborough&#x27;s was brief, and he returned to the airwaves on November 24.

====Martin Bashir====
Host Martin Bashir resigned after making a controversial comment about
Sarah Palin. On November 15, 2013, Bashir criticized Palin for equating the federal debt to slavery. Bashir referred to the cruel and barbaric punishment of slaves as described by slave overseer Thomas Thistlewood, specifically a punishment called &quot;Derby&#x27;s dose&quot;, which forced slaves to defecate or urinate into the mouth of another slave. Bashir then said, &quot;When Mrs. Palin invokes slavery, she doesn&#x27;t just prove her rank ignorance. She confirms if anyone truly qualified for a dose of discipline from Thomas Thistlewood, she would be the outstanding candidate.&quot;

====Alec Baldwin====
Alec Baldwin&#x27;s 2013 show &quot;Up Late with Alec Baldwin&quot; was suspended after five episodes because of a homophobic slur Baldwin made to a photographer in New York City.

<text>Sclerophyll is a type of vegetation that is adapted to long periods of dryness and heat. The plants feature hard leaves, short internodes (the distance between leaves along the stem) and leaf orientation which is parallel or oblique to direct sunlight.

Sclerophyllous plants occur in many parts of the world, but are most typical of areas with low rainfall or seasonal droughts, such as Australia, Africa, and western North and South America. They are prominent throughout Australia, parts of Argentina, the Cerrado biogeographic region of Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil, and in the Mediterranean biomes that cover the Mediterranean Basin, California, Chile, and the Cape Province of South Africa.

In the Mediterranean basin, holm oak, cork oak and olives are typical hardwood trees. In addition, there are several species of pine under the trees in the vegetation zone. The shrub layer contains numerous herbs such as rosemary, thyme and lavender. In relation to the potential natural vegetation, around 2% of the Earth&#x27;s land surface is covered by sclerophyll woodlands, and a total of 10% of all plant species on Earth live there.

==Etymology==
The word comes from the Greek &quot;sklēros&quot; (hard) and &quot;phyllon&quot; (leaf). The term was coined by Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper in 1898 (translated in 1903), originally as a synonym of xeromorph, but the two words were later differentiated.

==Description==
Sclerophyll woody plants are characterized by their relatively small, stiff, leathery and long-lasting leaves. The sclerophyll vegetation is the result of an adaptation of the flora to the summer dry period of a Mediterranean-type climate.

Plant species with this type of adaptation tend to be evergreen with great longevity, slow growth and with no loss of leaves during the unfavorable season. As a result, the thickets that make up these ecosystems are of the persistent evergreen type, in addition to the predominance of plants, even herbaceous ones, with &quot;hard&quot; leaves, which are covered by a thick leathery layer called the cuticle, that prevents water loss during the dry season. The aerial and underground structures of these plants are modified to make up for water shortages that may affect their survival.

The name sclerophyll derives from the highly developed sclerenchyma from the plant, which is responsible for the hardness or stiffness of the leaves. This structure of the leaves inhibits transpiration and thus prevents major water losses during the dry season. Most of the plant species in the sclerophyll zone are not only insensitive to summer drought, they have also used various strategies to adapt to frequent wildfires, heavy rainfall and nutrient deficiencies.

==Ecology==
The type of sclerophyllic trees in the Palearctic flora region include the holm oak (&quot;Quercus ilex&quot;), myrtle (&quot;Myrtus communis&quot;), strawberry tree (&quot;Arbutus unedo&quot;), wild olive (&quot;Olea europaea&quot;), laurel (&quot;Laurus nobilis&quot;), mock privet (&quot;Phillyrea latifolia&quot;), the Italian buckthorn (&quot;Rhamnus alaternus&quot;), etc.

* In central and southern California, the coastal hills are covered in sclerophyll vegetation known as chaparral. The flora of this ecoregion also includes tree species scrub oak (&quot;Quercus dumosa&quot;), California buckeye (&quot;Aesculus californica&quot;), San Gabriel Mountain liveforever (&quot;Dudlea densiflora&quot;), Catalina mahogany (&quot;Cercocarpus traskiae&quot;), and the threatened jewelflower (&quot;Streptanthus albidus&quot; ssp. &quot;Peramoenus&quot;).
* In South Africa, in the Cape region, there are Mediterranean open forests known as fynbos. The abundance of endemics is so extraordinary (68% of the 8600 vascular plant species in the area) that the South African sclerophyll area, the cape flora, forms the smallest of the six flora kingdoms on earth. Plants include &quot;Elegia&quot;, &quot;Thamnochortus&quot;, and &quot;Willdenowia&quot; and proteas such as king protea (&quot;Protea cynaroides&quot;) and blushing bride (&quot;Serruria florida&quot;). 
* In most of Australia, sclerophyll vegetation such as eucalyptus trees, melaleucas, banksias, callistemons and grevilleas dominate the mallee and woodland areas of its cities, including those lacking a Mediterranean climate, such as Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart and Brisbane.
* In Chile, south of the desert areas, there is evergreen bushland called matorral. Typical species include Litre &quot;(Lithraea venenosa)&quot;, Quillay or Soapbark Tree &quot;(Quillaja saponaria)&quot;, and bromeliads of genus &quot;Puya&quot;.

==Climate==

The sclerophyll regions are located in the outer subtropics bordering the temperate zone (also known as the warm-temperate zone). Accordingly, the annual average temperatures are relatively high at ; An average of over is reached for at least four months, eight to twelve months it is over and no month is below on average. Frost and snow occur only occasionally and the growing season lasts longer than 150 days and is in the winter half-year. The lower limit of the moderate annual precipitation is (semi-arid climate) and the upper limit .

Generally, the summers are dry and hot with a dry season of a maximum of seven months, but at least two to three months. The winters are rainy and cool. However, not all regions with sclerophyll vegetation feature the classic Mediterranean climate; parts of eastern Italy, eastern Australia and eastern South Africa, which feature sclerophyll woodlands, tend to have uniform rainfall or even a more summer-dominant rainfall, whereby falling under the humid subtropical climate zone (&quot;Cfa&quot;/&quot;Cwa&quot;). Furthermore, other areas with sclerophyll flora would grade to the oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;); particularly the eastern parts of the Eastern Cape province in South Africa, and Tasmania, Victoria and southern New South Wales in Australia.

==Soils==
Sclerophyll plants are also found in areas with nutrient-poor and acidic soils, and soils with heavy concentrations of aluminum and other metals. Sclerophyll leaves transpire less and have a lower uptake than malacophyllous or laurophyllous leaves. These lower transpiration rates may reduce the uptake of toxic ions and better provide for under nutrient-poor conditions, particularly low availability of mineral nitrogen and phosphate. Sclerophyllous plants are found in tropical heath forests, which grown on nutrient-poor sandy soils in humid regions in the Orinoco and the Rio Negro basins of northern South America on quartz sand, in the kerangas forests of Borneo and on the Malay Peninsula, in coastal sandy areas along the Gulf of Guinea in Gabon, Cameroon, and Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, and in eastern Australia. Since water drains rapidly through these soils, sclerophylly also protects plants against drought stress during dry periods.

Sclerophylly&#x27;s advantages in nutrient-poor conditions may be another factor in the prevalence of sclerophyllous plants in nutrient-poor areas in drier-climate regions, like much of Australia and the Cerrado of Brazil.

==Distribution==
The zone of the sclerophyll vegetation lies in the border area between the subtropics and the temperate zone, approximately between the 30th and 40th degree of latitude (in the northern hemisphere also up to the 45th degree of latitude). Their presence is limited to the coastal western sides of the continents, but nonetheless can typical in any regions of a continent with scarce annual precipitation or frequent seasonal droughts and poor soils that are heavily leached.

The sclerophyll zone often merges into temperate deciduous forests towards the poles, on the coasts also into temperate rainforests and towards the equator in hot semi-deserts or deserts. The Mediterranean areas, which have a very high biodiversity, are under great pressure from the population. This is especially true for the Mediterranean region since ancient times. Through overexploitation (logging, grazing, agricultural use) and frequent fires caused by people, the original forest vegetation is converted. In extreme cases, the hard-leaf vegetation disappears completely and is replaced by open rock heaths.

Some sclerophyll areas are closer to the equator than the Mediterranean zone—for example, the interior of Madagascar, the dry half of New Caledonia, the lower edge areas of the Madrean pine-oak woodlands of the Mexican highlands between or around high plateaus of the Asir Mountains on the western edge of the Arabian Peninsula.

===Land use===
While the winter rain areas of America, South Africa and Australia, with an unusually large variety of food crops, were ideal gathering areas for hunter-gatherers until European colonization, agriculture and cattle breeding spread in the Mediterranean area since the Neolithic, which permanently changed the face of the landscape. In the sclerophyll regions near the coast, permanent crops such as olive and wine cultivation established themselves; However, the landscape forms that characterize the degenerate shrubbery and shrub heaths maquis and garrigue are predominantly a result of grazing (especially with goats).

In the course of the last millennia, the original vegetation in almost all areas of this vegetation zone has been greatly changed by the influence of humans. Where the plants have not been replaced by vineyards and olive groves, the maquis was the predominant form of vegetation on the Mediterranean. The maquis has been degraded in many places to the low shrub heather, the garrigue. Many plant species that are rich in aromatic oils belong to both vegetation societies. The diversity of the original sclerophyll vegetation in the world is high to extremely high (3,000–5,000 species per hectare).

==Australian bush==
Most areas of the Australian continent able to support woody plants are occupied by sclerophyll communities as forests, savannas, or heathlands. Common plants include the Proteaceae (grevilleas, banksias and hakeas), tea-trees, acacias, boronias, and eucalypts.

The most common sclerophyll communities in Australia are savannas dominated by grasses with an overstorey of eucalypts and acacias. Acacia (particularly mulga) shrublands also cover extensive areas. All the dominant overstorey acacia species and a majority of the understorey acacias have a scleromorphic adaptation in which the leaves have been reduced to phyllodes consisting entirely of the petiole.

Many plants of the sclerophyllous woodlands and shrublands also produce leaves unpalatable to herbivores by the inclusion of toxic and indigestible compounds which assure survival of these long-lived leaves. This trait is particularly noticeable in the eucalypt and &quot;Melaleuca&quot; species which possess oil glands within their leaves that produce a pungent volatile oil that makes them unpalatable to most browsers. These traits make the majority of woody plants in these woodlands largely unpalatable to domestic livestock. It is therefore important from a grazing perspective that these woodlands support a more or less continuous layer of herbaceous ground cover dominated by grasses.

Sclerophyll forests cover a much smaller area of the continent, being restricted to relatively high rainfall locations. They have a eucalyptus overstory (10 to 30 metres) with the understory also being hard-leaved. &quot;Dry sclerophyll&quot; forests are the most common forest type on the continent, and although it may seem barren dry sclerophyll forest is highly diverse. For example, a study of sclerophyll vegetation in Seal Creek, Victoria, found 138 species.

Even less extensive are &quot;wet sclerophyll&quot; forests. They have a taller eucalyptus overstory than dry sclerophyll forests, or more (typically mountain ash, alpine ash, rose gum, karri, messmate stringybark, or manna gum, and a soft-leaved, fairly dense understory (tree ferns are common). They require ample rainfall—at least 1000 mm (40 inches).

===Evolution===

Sclerophyllous plants are all part of a specific environment and are anything but newcomers. By the time of European settlement, sclerophyll forest accounted for the vast bulk of the forested areas.

Most of the wooded parts of present-day Australia have become sclerophyll dominated as a result of the extreme age of the continent combined with Aboriginal fire use. Deep weathering of the crust over many millions of years leached chemicals out of the rock, leaving Australian soils deficient in nutrients, particularly phosphorus. Such nutrient deficient soils support non-sclerophyllous plant communities elsewhere in the world and did so over most of Australia prior to European arrival. However such deficient soils cannot support the nutrient losses associated with frequent fires and are rapidly replaced with sclerophyllous species under traditional Aboriginal burning regimens. With the cessation of traditional burning non-sclerophyllous species have re-colonized sclerophyll habitat in many parts of Australia.

The presence of toxic compounds combined with a high carbon : nitrogen ratio make the leaves and branches of scleromorphic species long-lived in the litter, and can lead to a large build-up of litter in woodlands. The toxic compounds of many species, notably Eucalyptus species, are volatile and flammable and the presence of large amounts of flammable litter, coupled with an herbaceous understorey, encourages fire.

All the Australian sclerophyllous communities are liable to be burnt with varying frequencies and many of the woody plants of these woodlands have developed adaptations to survive and minimise the effects of fire.

Sclerophyllous plants generally resist dry conditions well, making them successful in areas of seasonally variable rainfall. In Australia, however, they evolved in response to the low level of phosphorus in the soil—indeed, many native Australian plants cannot tolerate higher levels of phosphorus and will die if fertilised incorrectly. The leaves are hard due to lignin, which prevents wilting and allows plants to grow, even when there is not enough phosphorus for substantial new cell growth.

<text>In ancient Roman religion and myth, Janus ( ; ) is the god of beginnings, gates, transitions, time, duality, doorways, passages, frames, and endings. He is usually depicted as having two faces. The month of January is named for Janus (&quot;Ianuarius&quot;). According to ancient Roman farmers&#x27; almanacs, Juno was mistaken as the tutelary deity of the month of January, but Juno is the tutelary deity of the month of June.

Janus presided over the beginning and ending of conflict, and hence war and peace. The gates of a building in Rome, named after him (not a temple, as it is often called, but an open enclosure with gates at each end), were opened in time of war and closed to mark the arrival of peace. As a god of transitions, he had functions pertaining to birth and to journeys and exchange, and in his association with Portunus, a similar harbor and gateway god, he was concerned with travelling, trading and shipping.

Janus had no flamen or specialised priest &quot;(sacerdos)&quot; assigned to him, but the King of the Sacred Rites &quot;(rex sacrorum)&quot; himself carried out his ceremonies. Janus had a ubiquitous presence in religious ceremonies throughout the year. As such, Janus was ritually invoked at the beginning of each ceremony, regardless of the main deity honored on any particular occasion.

While the ancient Greeks had no known equivalent to Janus, there is considerable overlap with Culśanś of the Etruscan pantheon.

== Etymology ==
The name of the god &quot;Iānus&quot;, meaning in Latin &#x27;arched passage, doorway&#x27;, stems from Proto-Italic &quot;*iānu&quot; (&#x27;door&#x27;), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*ieh₂nu&quot; (&#x27;passage&#x27;). It is cognate with Sanskrit &quot;yāti&quot; (&#x27;to go, travel&#x27;), Lithuanian &quot;jóti&quot; (&#x27;to go, ride&#x27;), Irish &quot;áth&quot; (&#x27;ford&#x27;) or Serbo-Croatian &quot;jàhati&quot; (&#x27;to ride&#x27;).

Iānus would then be an action name expressing the idea of going, passing, formed on the root *yā- &lt; *y-eð- theme II of the root *ey- go from which eō, ειμι. Other modern scholars object to an Indo-European etymology either from Dianus or from root *yā-.

From &quot;Ianus&quot; derived &quot;ianua&quot; (&quot;door&quot;), and hence the English word &quot;janitor&quot; (Latin, &quot;ianitor&quot;).

===Ancient interpretations===
Three etymologies were proposed by ancient erudites, each of them bearing implications about the nature of the god. The first one is based on the definition of Chaos given by Paul the Deacon: &quot;hiantem&quot;, &quot;hiare&quot;, &quot;be open&quot;, from which the word &quot;Ianus&quot; would derive by the loss of the initial aspirate. In this etymology, the notion of Chaos would define the primordial nature of the god.

Another etymology proposed by Nigidius Figulus is related by Macrobius: &quot;Ianus&quot; would be Apollo and Diana &quot;Iana&quot;, by the addition of a &quot;D&quot; for the sake of euphony. This explanation has been accepted by A. B. Cook and J. G. Frazer. It supports all the assimilations of Janus to the bright sky, the sun and the moon. It supposes a former *Dianus, formed on *dia- &lt; *dy-eð from the Indo-European root *dey- shine represented in Latin by &quot;dies&quot; day, Diovis and Iuppiter. However the form Dianus postulated by Nigidius is not attested.

A third etymology indicated by Cicero, Ovid and Macrobius, which explains the name as Latin, deriving it from the verb &quot;ire&quot; (&quot;to go&quot;) is based on the interpretation of Janus as the god of beginnings and transitions.

== Theology and functions ==
While the fundamental nature of Janus is debated, in most modern scholars&#x27; view the god&#x27;s functions may be seen as being organized around a single principle: presiding over all beginnings and transitions, whether abstract or concrete, sacred or profane. Interpretations concerning the god&#x27;s fundamental nature either limit it to this general function or emphasize a concrete or particular aspect of it (identifying him with light, the sun, the moon, time, movement, the year, doorways, bridges, etc.) or else see in the god a sort of cosmological principle, interpreting him as a uranic deity.

Almost all of these modern explanations were originally formulated by the ancients.

===God of beginnings and passages===
His function as god of beginnings has been clearly expressed in numerous ancient sources, among them most notably Cicero, Ovid, and Varro. As a god of motion, Janus looks after passages, causes actions to start and presides over all beginnings. Since movement and change are interconnected, he has a double nature, symbolised in his two-headed image. He has under his tutelage the stepping in and out of the door of homes, the &quot;ianua&quot;, which took its name from him, and not vice versa. Similarly, his tutelage extends to the covered passages named &quot;iani&quot; and foremost to the gates of the city, including the cultic gate of the &#x27;, named &#x27; or &quot;&quot; from which he protects Rome against the Sabines. He is also present at the Sororium Tigillum, where he guards the terminus of the ways into Rome from Latium. He has an altar, later a temple near the &quot;Porta Carmentalis&quot;, where the road leading to Veii ended, as well as being present on the Janiculum, a gateway from Rome out to Etruria.

The connection of the notions of beginning (&quot;principium&quot;), movement, transition (&quot;eundo&quot;), and thence time was clearly expressed by Cicero. In general, Janus is at the origin of time as the guardian of the gates of Heaven: Jupiter himself can move forth and back because of Janus&#x27;s working. In one of his temples, probably that of Forum Holitorium, the hands of his statue were positioned to signify the number 355 (the number of days in a lunar year), later 365, symbolically expressing his mastership over time. He presides over the concrete and abstract beginnings of the world, such as religion and the gods themselves, he too holds the access to Heaven and to other gods: this is the reason why men must invoke him first, regardless of the god they want to pray to or placate. He is the initiator of human life, of new historical ages, and financial enterprises: according to myth he was the first to mint coins and the as, first coin of the liberal series, bears his effigy on one face.

===God of change===
Janus frequently symbolized change and transitions such as the progress of past to future, from one condition to another, from one vision to another, and young people&#x27;s growth to adulthood. He represented time because he could see into the past with one face and into the future with the other. Hence, Janus was worshipped at the beginnings of the harvest and planting times, as well as at marriages, deaths and other beginnings. He represented the middle ground between barbarism and civilization, rural and urban space, youth and adulthood. Having jurisdiction over beginnings Janus had an intrinsic association with omens and auspices.

=== Demi-god or a king reformator ===
Plutarch in his Parallel Lives mention that Numa Pompilius made January the first month in the calendar instead of March by the next reason: &quot;he wished in every case that martial influences should yield precedence to civil and political. For this Janus, in remote antiquity, whether he was a demi-god or a king, was a patron of civil and social order, and is said to have lifted human life out of its bestial and savage state. For this reason he is represented with two faces, implying that he brought men&#x27;s lives out of one sort and condition into another.&quot;
===Position in the pantheon===
Leonhard Schmitz suggests that he was likely the most important god in the Roman archaic &quot;pantheon&quot;. He was often invoked together with &quot;Iuppiter&quot; (Jupiter).

====Structural peculiarity theory====

In several of his works, G. Dumézil proposed the existence of a structural difference in level between the Proto-Indo-European gods of beginning and ending, and the other gods whom Dumézil postulated fall into a tripartite structure, reflecting the most ancient organization of society. So in IE religions there is an introducer god (such as Vedic Vâyu and Roman Janus) and a god of ending, and a nurturer goddess who is often also a fire spirit (such as Roman Vesta, Vedic Saraswati and Agni, Avestic Armaiti and Anâitâ) who show a sort of mutual solidarity.

The concept of &#x27;god of ending&#x27; is defined in connection to the human point of reference, i.e. the current situation of man in the universe, and not to endings as transitions into new circumstances, which are under the jurisdiction of the gods of beginning, owing to the ambivalent nature of the concept. Thus the god of beginning is not structurally reducible to a sovereign god, nor the goddess of ending to any of the three categories on to which Dumézil distributed goddesses. There is though a greater degree of fuzziness concerning the function and role of goddesses, which may have formed a preexisting structure allowing the absorption of the local Mediterranean mother goddesses, nurturers, and protectresses .

As a consequence, the position of the gods of beginning would not be the issue of a diachronic process of debasement undergone by a supreme sky god, but rather a structural feature inherent to the culture&#x27;s theology. The descent of primordial sky gods into the condition of &quot;deus otiosus&quot; is a well-known phenomenon in many religions.
Dumézil himself observed and discussed in many of his works the phenomenon of the fall of archaic celestial deities in numerous societies of ethnologic interest.

Mircea Eliade evaluated Dumezil&#x27;s views (1946) positively, and recommended their use in comparative research on Indo-European religions.

====Solar god theories====
According to Macrobius who cites Nigidius Figulus and Cicero, &quot;Janus&quot; and &quot;Jana&quot; (Diana) are a pair of divinities, worshipped as Apollo or the sun and moon, whence Janus received sacrifices before all the others, because through him is apparent the way of access to the desired deity.

A similar solar interpretation has been offered by A. Audin who interprets the god as the issue of a long process of development, starting with the Sumeric cultures, from the two solar pillars located on the eastern side of temples, each of them marking the direction of the rising sun at the dates of the two solstices: the southeastern corresponding to the Winter and the northeastern to the Summer solstice. These two pillars would be at the origin of the theology of the divine twins, one of whom is mortal (related to the NE pillar, nearest the Northern region where the sun does not shine) and the other is immortal (related to the SE pillar and the Southern region where the sun always shines). Later these iconographic models evolved in the Middle East and Egypt into a single column representing two torsos and finally a single body with two heads looking at opposite directions.

Numa, in his regulation of the Roman calendar, called the first month &quot;Januarius&quot; after Janus, according to tradition considered the highest divinity at the time.

== Temples ==

Numa built the &quot;Ianus geminus&quot; (also &quot;Janus Bifrons&quot;, &quot;Janus Quirinus&quot; or &quot;Portae Belli&quot;), a passage ritually opened at times of war, and shut again when Roman arms rested. It formed a walled enclosure with gates at each end, situated between the old Roman Forum and that of Julius Caesar, which had been consecrated by Numa Pompilius himself. About the exact location and aspect of the temple there has been much debate among scholars. In wartime the gates of the Janus were opened, and in its interior sacrifices and &quot;vaticinia&quot; were held, to forecast the outcome of military deeds. The doors were closed only during peacetime, an extremely rare event. The function of the Ianus Geminus was supposed to be a sort of good omen: in time of peace it was said to close the wars within or to keep peace inside; in times of war it was said to be open to allow the return of the people on duty.

A temple of Janus is said to have been consecrated by the consul Gaius Duilius in 260 BC after the Battle of Mylae in the Forum Holitorium. It contained a statue of the god with the right hand showing the number 300 and the left the number 65—i.e., the length in days of the solar year, and twelve altars, one for each month.

The four-sided structure known as the Arch of Janus in the Forum Transitorium dates from the 1st century of the Christian era: according to common opinion it was built by the Emperor Domitian. However American scholars L. Ross Taylor and L. Adams Holland on the grounds of a passage of Statius maintain that it was an earlier structure (tradition has it the &quot;Ianus Quadrifrons&quot; was brought to Rome from Falerii) and that Domitian only surrounded it with his new forum. In fact the building of the Forum Transitorium was completed and inaugurated by Nerva in AD 96.

== Cult epithets ==
Another way of investigating the complex nature of Janus is by systematically analysing his cultic epithets: religious documents may preserve a notion of a deity&#x27;s theology more accurately than other literary sources.

The main sources of Janus&#x27;s cult epithets are the fragments of the Carmen Saliare preserved by Varro in his work De Lingua Latina, a list preserved in a passage of Macrobius&#x27;s Saturnalia (I 9, 15–16), another in a passage of Johannes Lydus&#x27;s De Mensibus (IV 1), a list in Cedrenus&#x27;s &quot;Historiarum Compendium&quot; (I p. 295 7 Bonn), partly dependent on Lydus&#x27;s, and one in Servius Honoratus&#x27;s commentary to the &quot;Aeneis&quot; (VII 610). Literary works also preserve some of Janus&#x27;s cult epithets, such as Ovid&#x27;s long passage of the &quot;Fasti&quot; devoted to Janus at the beginning of Book I (89–293), Tertullian, Augustine and Arnobius.

=== Carmen Saliare ===
As may be expected the opening verses of the Carmen, are devoted to honouring Janus, thence were named &#x27;. Paul the Deacon mentions the &#x27;. Only part of the &#x27; and two of the &quot;&quot; are preserved.

The manuscript has:

:(paragraph 26): &quot;&quot;&quot;;

:(paragraph 27): &quot;.&quot; &quot;&quot;&quot;.

Many reconstructions have been proposed:
they vary widely in dubious points and are all tentative, nonetheless one can identify with certainty some epithets:

* &quot;Cozeiuod&quot; &quot;orieso.&quot; &#x27; &#x27;
* &#x27; (or &#x27;), &quot;Iane, es, duonus Cerus es, duonus Ianus.&quot;
* &#x27; (or &#x27;) &quot;.&quot;

The epithets that can be identified are:

=== Other sources ===
The above-mentioned sources give: &quot;Ianus Geminus, I. Pater, I. Iunonius, I. Consivius, I. Quirinus, I. Patulcius and Clusivius&quot; (Macrobius above I 9, 15): Ι. Κονσίβιον, Ι. Κήνουλον, Ι. Κιβουλλιον, I. Πατρίκιον, I. Κλουσίβιον, I. Ιουνώνιον, I. Κυρινον, I. Πατούλκιον, I. Κλούσιον, I. Κουριάτιον (Lydus above IV 1); I. Κιβούλλιον, I. Κυρινον, I. Κονσαιον, I. Πατρίκιον (Cedrenus &quot;Historiarum Compendium&quot; I p. 295 7 Bonn); &quot;I. Clusiuius, I. Patulcius, I. Iunonius, I. Quirinus&quot; (Servius &quot;Aen.&quot; VII 610).

Even though the lists overlap to a certain extent (five epithets are common to Macrobius&#x27;s and Lydus&#x27;s list), the explanations of the epithets differ remarkably. Macrobius&#x27;s list and explanation are probably based directly on Cornelius Labeo&#x27;s work, as he cites this author often in his &quot;Saturnalia&quot;, as when he gives a list of Maia&#x27;s cult epithets and mentions one of his works, &quot;Fasti&quot;. In relating Janus&#x27; epithets Macrobius states: &quot;We invoke in the sacred rites&quot;. Labeo himself, as it is stated in the passage on Maia, read them in the lists of indigitamenta of the libri pontificum. On the other hand, Lydus&#x27;s authority cannot have consulted these documents precisely because he offers different (and sometimes bizarre) explanations for the common epithets: it seems likely he received a list with no interpretations appended and his interpretations are only his own.

====Pater====
&quot;Pater&quot; is perhaps the most frequent epithet of Janus, found also in the composition &quot;Ianuspater&quot;. While numerous gods share this cultic epithet it seems the Romans felt it was typically pertinent to Janus. When invoked along with other gods, usually only he is called pater. For Janus the title is not just a term of respect; principally it marks his primordial role. He is the first of the gods and thus their father: the formula &quot;quasi deorum deum&quot; corresponds to &quot;diuum deus&quot; of the carmen Saliare. Similarly, in the expression &quot;duonus Cerus&quot;, Cerus means creator and is considered a masculine form related to Ceres.
Lydus gives Πατρίκιος (Patricius) and explains it as &quot;autóchthon&quot;: since he does not give another epithet corresponding to Pater it may be inferred that Lydus understands Patricius as a synonym of Pater. There is no evidence connecting Janus to gentilician cults or identifying him as a national god particularly venerated by the oldest patrician families.

====Geminus====
&quot;Geminus&quot; is the first epithet in Macrobius&#x27;s list. Although the etymology of the word is unclear, it is certainly related to his most typical character, that of having two faces or heads. The proof are the numerous equivalent expressions. The origin of this epithet might be either concrete, referring directly to the image of the god reproduced on coins and supposed to have been introduced by king Numa in the sanctuary at the lowest point of the Argiletum, or to a feature of the Ianus of the &quot;Porta Belli&quot;, the double gate ritually opened at the beginning of wars, or abstract, deriving metaphorically from the liminal, intermediary functions of the god themselves: both in time and space passages connected two different spheres, realms or worlds. The &quot;Janus quadrifrons&quot; or &quot;quadriformis&quot;, brought according to tradition from Falerii in 241 BC and installed by Domitian in the Forum Transitorium, although having a different meaning, seems to be connected to the same theological complex, as its image purports an ability to rule over every direction, element and time of the year. It did not give rise to a new epithet though.

====Patulcius and Clusivius the 1st====
&quot;Patulcius&quot; and &quot;Clusivius&quot; or &quot;Clusius&quot; are epithets related to an inherent quality and function of doors, that of standing open or shut. Janus as the Gatekeeper has jurisdiction over every kind of door and passage and the power of opening or closing them. Servius interprets Patulcius in the same way. Lydus gives an incorrect translation, &quot;αντί του οδαιον&quot; which however reflects one of the attributes of the god, that of being the protector of roads. Elsewhere Lydus cites the epithet θυρέος to justify the key held by Janus. The antithetical quality of the two epithets is meant to refer to the alterning opposite conditions and is commonly found in the &quot;indigitamenta&quot;: in relation to Janus, Macrobius cites instances of Antevorta and Postvorta, the personifications of two indigitations of Carmentis.
These epithets are associated with the ritual function of Janus in the opening of the &quot;&quot; or &quot;Porta Belli&quot;. The rite might go back to times pre-dating the founding of Rome. Poets tried to explain this rite by imagining that the gate closed either war or peace inside the &quot;ianus&quot;, but in its religious significance it might have been meant to propitiate the return home of the victorious soldiers.

====Quirinus====
&quot;Quirinus&quot; is a debated epithet. According to some scholars, mostly Francophone, it looks to be strictly related to the ideas of the passage of the Roman people from war back to peace, from the condition of &quot;miles&quot;, soldier, to that of &quot;quiris&quot;, citizen occupied in peaceful business, as the rites of the &quot;Porta Belli&quot; imply. This is in fact the usual sense of the word &quot;quirites&quot; in Latin. Other scholars, mainly Germanophone, think it is related on the contrary to the martial character of the god Quirinus, an interpretation supported by numerous ancient sources: Lydus, Cedrenus, Macrobius, Ovid, Plutarch and Paul the Daecon.

Schilling and Capdeville counter that it is his function of presiding over the return to peace that gave Janus this epithet, as confirmed by his association on 30 March with Pax, Concordia and Salus, even though it is true that Janus as god of all beginnings presides also over that of war and is thus often called &quot;belliger&quot;, bringer of war as well as &quot;pacificus&quot;. This use is also discussed by Dumézil in various works concerning the armed nature of the &quot;Mars qui praeest paci&quot;, the armed quality of the gods of the third function and the arms of the third function.

Koch on the other hand sees the epithet Janus Quirinus as a reflection of the god&#x27;s patronage over the two months beginning and ending the year, after their addition by king Numa in his reform of the calendar. This interpretation too would befit the liminal nature of Janus.
The compound term &quot;Ianus Quirinus&quot; was particularly in vogue at the time of Augustus, its peaceful interpretation complying particularly well with the Augustan ideology of the &quot;Pax Romana&quot;.

The compound &quot;Ianus Quirinus&quot; is to be found also in the rite of the spolia opima, a &quot;lex regia&quot; ascribed to Numa, which prescribed that the third rank spoils of a king or chief killed in battle, those conquered by a common soldier, be consecrated to &quot;Ianus Quirinus&quot;. Schilling believes the reference of this rite to Ianus Quirinus to embody the original prophetic interpretation, which ascribes to this deity the last and conclusive spoils of Roman history.

====Ποπάνων (Popanon, Libo?)====
The epithet &quot;Ποπάνων (Popanōn)&quot; is attested only by Lydus, who cites Varro as stating that on the day of the kalendae he was offered a cake which earned him this title. There is no surviving evidence of this name in Latin, although the rite is attested by Ovid for the kalendae of January and by Paul. This cake was named &quot;&quot; but the related epithet of Janus could not plausibly have been Ianualis: it has been suggested &quot;Libo&quot; which remains purely hypothetical. The context could allow an Etruscan etymology.

====Iunonius====
Janus owes the epithet &quot;Iunonius&quot; to his function as patron of all kalends, which are also associated with Juno. In Macrobius&#x27;s explanation: &quot;Iunonium, as it were, not only does he hold the entry to January, but to all the months: indeed all the kalends are under the jurisdiction of Juno&quot;. At the time when the rising of the new moon was observed by the pontifex minor the rex sacrorum assisted by him offered a sacrifice to Janus in the &quot;Curia Calabra&quot; while the regina sacrorum sacrificed to Juno in the regia.

Some scholars have maintained that Juno was the primitive paredra of the god. This point bears on the nature of Janus and Juno and is at the core of an important dispute: was Janus a debased ancient uranic supreme god, or were Janus and Jupiter co-existent, their distinct identities structurally inherent to their original theology?

Among Francophone scholars, Grimal and (implicitly and partially) Renard and Basanoff have supported the view of a uranic supreme god against Dumézil and Schilling. Among Anglophone scholars Frazer and Cook have suggested an interpretation of Janus as uranic supreme god.

Whatever the case, it is certain that Janus and Juno show a peculiar reciprocal affinity: while Janus is &quot;Iunonius&quot;, Juno is &quot;Ianualis&quot;, as she presides over childbirth and the menstrual cycle, and opens doors. Moreover, besides the kalends Janus and Juno are also associated at the rite of the Tigillum Sororium of 1 October, in which they bear the epithets &quot;Ianus Curiatius&quot; and &quot;Iuno Sororia&quot;. These epithets, which swap the functional qualities of the gods, are the most remarkable apparent proof of their proximity. The rite is discussed in detail in the section below.

====Consivius====
&quot;Consivius&quot;, sower, is an epithet that reflects the tutelary function of the god at the first instant of human life and of life in general, conception. This function is a particular case of his function of patron of beginnings. As far as man is concerned it is obviously of the greatest importance, even though both Augustine and some modern scholars see it as minor. Augustine shows astonishment at the fact that some of the dii selecti may be engaged in such tasks: &quot;In fact Janus himself first, when pregnancy is conceived, ... opens the way to receiving the semen&quot;.

Varro on the other hand had clear the relevance of the function of starting a new life by opening the way to the semen and therefore started his enumeration of the gods with Janus, following the pattern of the Carmen Saliare. Macrobius gives the same interpretation of the epithet in his list: &quot;&quot;Consivius from sowing (conserendo), i. e. from the propagation of the human genre, that is disseminated by the working of Janus&quot;.&quot; as the most ancient form. He though does not consider &quot;&quot; to be an epithet of Janus but a theonym in its own right.

Lydus understands as βουλαιον () owing to a conflation with Consus through Ops Consiva or Consivia. The interpretation of Consus as god of advice is already present in Latin authors and is due to a folk etymology supported by the story of the abduction of the Sabine women, (which happened on the day of the Consualia aestiva), said to have been advised by Consus. However no Latin source cites relationships of any kind between Consus and Janus Consivius. Moreover, both the passages that this etymology requires present difficulties, particularly as it seems Consus cannot be etymologically related to adjective &#x27; or &#x27;, found in Ops Consivia and thence the implied notion of sowing.

====Κήνουλος (Coenulus)====
&quot;Κήνουλος () &quot;and &quot;Κιβουλλιος ()&quot; are not attested by Latin sources. The second epithet is not to be found in Lydus&#x27;s manuscripts and is present in Cedrenus along with its explanation concerning food and nurture. The editor of Lydus R. Wünsch has added Cedrenus&#x27;s passage after Lydus&#x27;s own explanation of Coenulus as ευωχιαστικός, good host at a banquet. Capdeville considers Cedrenus&#x27; text to be due to a paleographic error: only &quot;Coenulus&quot; is indubitably an epithet of Janus and the adjective used to explain it, meaning to present and to treat well at dinner, was used in a ritual invocation before meals, wishing the diners to make good flesh. This is one of the features of Janus as shown by the myth that associates him with Carna, Cardea, Crane.

====Curiatius====
The epithet &quot;Curiatius&quot; is found in association with &quot;Iuno Sororia&quot; as designating the deity to which one of the two altars behind the Tigillum Sororium was dedicated. Festus and other ancient authors explain Curiatius by the aetiological legend of the Tigillum: the expiation undergone by P. Horatius after his victory over the Alban Curiatii for the murder of his own sister, by walking under a beam with his head veiled.

Capdeville sees this epithet as related exclusively to the characters of the legend and the rite itself: He cites the analysis by Dumézil as his authority.

Schilling supposes it was probably a &#x27; originally entrusted to the &#x27; that allowed the desacralisation of the &#x27; at the end of the military season, later transferred to the state. Janus&#x27;s patronage of a rite of passage would be natural. The presence of Juno would be related to the date (Kalends), her protection of the &#x27;, soldiers, or the legend itself.
Schilling&#x27;s opinion is that it is related to &quot;curia&quot;, as the Tigillum was located not far from the &quot;&quot;.

Renard considered Schilling&#x27;s interpretation unacceptable, even though supported by an inscription (&#x27;) because of the different quantity of the &quot;u&quot;, short in &#x27;, &#x27; and &#x27; and long in &quot;&quot;. Moreover, it is part of the different interpretation of the meaning of the ritual of the Tigillum Sororium proposed by Herbert Jennings Rose, Kurt Latte, and Robert Schilling himself.
Renard connects the epithet&#x27;s meaning to the &#x27; or &#x27;, the spear of Juno Curitis as here she is given the epithet of &quot;Sororia&quot;, corresponding to the usual epithet &quot;Geminus&quot; of Janus and to the twin or feminine nature of the passage between two coupled posts.

In summary, the etymology of &quot;Curiatius&quot; remains uncertain.

== Rites ==
The rites concerning Janus were numerous. Owing to the versatile and far reaching character of his basic function marking all beginnings and transitions, his presence was ubiquitous and fragmented. Apart from the rites solemnizing the beginning of the new year and of every month, there were the special times of the year which marked the beginning and closing of the military season, in March and October respectively. These included the rite of the &quot;arma movēre&quot; on 1 March and that of the &quot;arma condĕre&quot; at the end of the month performed by the Salii, and the &quot;Tigillum Sororium&quot; on 1 October. Janus Quirinus was closely associated with the anniversaries of the dedications of the temples of Mars on 1 June (a date that corresponded with the festival of Carna, a deity associated with Janus: see below) and of that of Quirinus on 29 June (which was the last day of the month in the pre-Julian calendar). These important rites are discussed in detail below.

Any rite or religious act whatsoever required the invocation of Janus first, with a corresponding invocation to Vesta at the end (&quot;Janus primus&quot; and &quot;Vesta extrema&quot;). Instances are to be found in the &quot;Carmen Saliare&quot;, the formula of the devotio, the lustration of the fields and the sacrifice of the &quot;porca praecidanea&quot;, the &quot;Acta&quot; of the Arval Brethren.

Although Janus had no flamen, he was closely associated with the rex sacrorum who performed his sacrifices and took part in most of his rites: the &quot;rex&quot; held the first place in the ordo sacerdotum, hierarchy of priests. The flamen of Portunus performed the ritual greasing of the spear of the god Quirinus on 17 August, day of the Portunalia, on the same date that the temple of Janus in the Forum Holitorium had been consecrated by consul Gaius Duilius in 260 BC.

=== Beginning of the year ===
The winter solstice was thought to occur on 25 December. On 1 January was New Year&#x27;s Day: the day was consecrated to Janus since it was the first of the new year and of the month (kalends) of Janus: the &quot;feria&quot; had an augural character as Romans believed the beginning of anything was an omen for the whole. Thus on that day it was customary to exchange cheerful words of good wishes. For the same reason everybody devoted a short time to his usual business, exchanged dates, figs and honey as a token of well wishing and made gifts of coins called &quot;strenae&quot;. Cakes made of spelt (&quot;far&quot;) and salt were offered to the god and burnt on the altar. Ovid states that in most ancient times there were no animal sacrifices and gods were propitiated with offerings of spelt and pure salt. This &#x27; was named &#x27; and it was probably correspondent to the &quot;summanal&quot; offered the day before the Summer solstice to god Summanus, which however was sweet being made with flour, honey and milk.
Shortly afterwards, on 9 January, on the &quot;&quot; of the Agonium of January, the rex sacrorum offered the sacrifice of a ram to Janus.

=== Beginning of the month ===
At the kalends of each month, the and the pontifex minor offered a sacrifice to Janus in the curia Calabra, while the regina offered a sow or a she lamb to Juno.

=== Beginning of the day ===
Morning belonged to Janus: men started their daily activities and business. Horace calls him &quot;Matutine Pater&quot;, morning father. G. Dumézil believes this custom is at the origin of the learned interpretations of Janus as a solar deity.

=== Space ===
Janus was also involved in spatial transitions, presiding over home doors, city gates and boundaries. Numerous toponyms of places located at the boundary between the territory of two communities, especially Etrurians and Latins or Umbrians, are named after the god. The most notable instance is the Ianiculum which marked the access to Etruria from Rome. Since borders often coincided with rivers and the border of Rome (and other Italics) with Etruria was the Tiber, it has been argued that its crossing had a religious connotation; it would have involved a set of rigorous apotropaic practices and a devotional attitude. Janus would have originally regulated particularly the crossing of this sacred river through the pons sublicius.
The name of the Iāniculum is not derived by that of the god, but from the abstract noun &quot;iānus, -us&quot;. Adams Holland opines it would have been originally the name of a small bridge connecting the Tiber Island (on which she supposes the first shrine of Janus stood) with the right bank of the river.
However Janus was the protector of doors, gates and roadways in general, as is shown by his two symbols, the key and the staff. The key too was a sign that the traveller had come to a harbour or ford in peace to exchange his goods.

The rite of the bride&#x27;s oiling the posts of the door of her new home with wolf fat at her arrival, though not mentioning Janus explicitly, is a rite of passage related to the &quot;ianua&quot;.

=== Rites of the Salii ===
The rites of the Salii marked the springtime beginning of the war season in March and its closing in October. The structure of the patrician sodalitas, made up by the two groups of the Salii Palatini, who were consecrated to Mars and whose institution was traditionally ascribed to Numa (with headquarter on the Palatine), and the Salii Collini or Agonales, consecrated to Quirinus and whose foundation was ascribed to Tullus Hostilius, (with headquarter on the Quirinal) reflects in its division the dialectic symbolic role they played in the rites of the opening and closing of the military season. So does the legend of their foundation itself: the peace-loving king Numa instituted the Salii of Mars Gradivus, foreseeing the future wars of the Romans while the warmonger king Tullus, in a battle during a longstanding war with the Sabines, swore to found a second group of Salii should he obtain victory.

The paradox of the pacifist king serving Mars and passage to war and of the warmonger king serving Quirinus to achieve peace under the expected conditions highlights the dialectic nature of the cooperation between the two gods, inherent to their own function. Because of the working of the talismans of the sovereign god they guaranteed alternatively force and victory, fecundity and plenty. It is noteworthy that the two groups of Salii did not split their competences so that one group only opened the way to war and the other to peace: they worked together both at the opening and the conclusion of the military season, marking the passage of power from one god to the other. Thus the Salii enacted the dialectic nature present in the warring and peaceful aspect of the Roman people, particularly the &quot;iuvenes&quot;.

This dialectic was reflected materially by the location of the temple of Mars outside the pomerium and of the temple of Quirinus inside it. The annual dialectic rhythm of the rites of the Salii of March and October was also further reflected within the rites of each month and spatially by their repeated crossing of the pomerial line. The rites of March started on the first with the ceremony of the &quot;ancilia movere&quot;, developed through the month on the 14th with Equirria in the Campus Martius (and the rite of Mamurius Veturius marking the expulsion of the old year), the 17th with the Agonium Martiale, the 19th with the Quinquatrus in the Comitium (which correspond symmetrically with the Armilustrium of 19 October), on the 23rd with the Tubilustrium and they terminated at the end of the month with the rite of the &quot;ancilia condere&quot;. Only after this month-long set of rites was accomplished was it fas to undertake military campaigns.

While Janus sometimes is named &quot;belliger&quot; and sometimes &quot;pacificus&quot; in accord with his general function of beginner, he is mentioned as &quot;Janus Quirinus&quot; in relation to the closing of the rites of March at the end of the month together with Pax, Salus and Concordia: This feature is a reflection of the aspect of Janus Quirinus which stresses the &quot;quirinal&quot; function of bringing peace back and the hope of soldiers for a victorious return.

As the rites of the Salii mimic the passage from peace to war and back to peace by moving between the two poles of Mars and Quirinus in the monthly cycle of March, so they do in the ceremonies of October, the &quot;Equus October&quot; (&quot;October Horse&quot;) taking place on the Campus Martius the &quot;Armilustrium&quot;, purification of the arms, on the Aventine, and the Tubilustrium on the 23rd. Other correspondences may be found in the dates of the founding of the temples of Mars on 1 June and of that of Quirinus on 29 June, in the pre-Julian calendar the last day of the month, implying that the opening of the month belonged to Mars and the closing to Quirinus.

The reciprocity of the two gods&#x27; situations is subsumed under the role of opener and closer played by Janus as Ovid states: &quot;Why are you hidden in peace, and open when the arms have been moved?&quot; Another analogous correspondence may be found in the festival of the Quirinalia of February, last month of the ancient calendar of Numa. The rite of the opening and closure of the Janus Quirinus would thus reflect the idea of the reintegration of the &quot;miles&quot; into civil society, i.e. the community of the &quot;quirites&quot;, by playing a lustral role similar to the &quot;Tigillum Sororium&quot; and the &quot;&quot; located at the south of the Campus Martius. In Augustan ideology this symbolic meaning was strongly emphasised.

=== Tigillum Sororium ===

This rite was supposed to commemorate the expiation of the murder of his own sister by Marcus Horatius. The young hero with his head veiled had to pass under a beam spanning an alley. The rite was repeated every year on 1 October. The &quot;tigillum&quot; consisted of a beam on two posts. It was kept in good condition at public expenses to the time of Livy. Behind the &quot;tigillum&quot;, on opposite sides of the alley, stood the two altars of Janus Curiatius and Juno Sororia. Its location was on the vicus leading to the Carinae, perhaps at the point of the crossing of the pomerium. The rite and myth have been interpreted by Dumezil as a purification and desacralization of the soldiers from the religious pollution contracted in war, and a freeing of the warrior from &quot;furor&quot;, wrath, as dangerous in the city as it is necessary on campaign.

The rite took place on the kalends of October, the month marking the end of the yearly military activity in ancient Rome. Scholars have offered different interpretations of the meaning of Janus Curiatius and Juno Sororia. The association of the two gods with this rite is not immediately clear. It is however apparent that they exchanged their epithets, as Curiatius is connected to (Juno) Curitis and Sororia to (Janus) Geminus. Renard thinks that while Janus is the god of motion and transitions he is not concerned directly with purification, while the arch is more associated with Juno. This fact would be testified by the epithet Sororium, shared by the &quot;tigillum&quot; and the goddess. Juno Curitis is also the protectress of the &quot;iuvenes&quot;, the young soldiers. Paul the Deacon states that the &quot;sororium tigillum&quot; was a &quot;sacer&quot; (sacred) place in honour of Juno. Another element linking Juno with Janus is her identification with Carna, suggested by the festival of this deity on the kalends (day of Juno) of June, the month of Juno.

Carna was a nymph of the sacred &quot;lucus&quot; of Helernus, made goddess of hinges by Janus with the name of Cardea, and had the power of protecting and purifying thresholds and the doorposts. This would be a further element in explaining the role of Juno in the &quot;Tigillum&quot;. It was also customary for new brides to oil the posts of the door of their new homes with wolf fat. In the myth of Janus and Carna (see section below) Carna had the habit when pursued by a young man of asking him out of shyness for a hidden recess and thereupon fleeing: but two headed Janus saw her hiding in a crag under some rocks. Thence the analogy with the rite of the Tigillum Sororium would be apparent: both in the myth and in the rite Janus, the god of motion, goes through a low passage to attain Carna as Horatius passes under the &quot;tigillum&quot; to obtain his purification and the restitution to the condition of citizen eligible for civil activities, including family life. The purification is then the prerequisite for fertility. The custom of attaining lustration and fertility by passing under a gap in rocks, a hole in the soil or a hollow in a tree is widespread.

The veiled head of Horatius could also be explained as an apotropaic device if one considers the &#x27; the &#x27; of Juno, the feminine principle of fecundity. Renard concludes that the rite is under the tutelage of both Janus and Juno, being a rite of transition under the patronage of Janus and of desacralisation and fertility under that of Juno: through it the &quot;&quot; coming back from campaign were restituted to their fertile condition of husbands and peasants. Janus is often associated with fecundity in myths, representing the masculine principle of motion, while Juno represents the complementary feminine principle of fertility: the action of the first would allow the manifestation of the other.

== Myths ==
In discussing myths about Janus, one should be careful in distinguishing those which are ancient and originally Latin and those others which were later attributed to him by Greek mythographers. In the &quot;Fasti&quot; Ovid relates only the myths that associate Janus with Saturn, whom he welcomed as a guest and with whom he eventually shared his kingdom in reward for teaching the art of agriculture, and to the nymph Crane, Grane, or Carna, whom Janus raped and made the goddess of hinges as Cardea, while in the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; he records his fathering with Venilia the nymph Canens, loved by Picus, first legendary king of the Aborigines.

The myth of Crane has been studied by M. Renard and G. Dumezil. The first scholar sees in it a sort of parallel with the theology underlying the rite of the Tigillum Sororium. Crane is a nymph of the sacred wood of Helernus, located at the issue of the Tiber, whose festival of 1 February corresponded with that of Juno Sospita: Crane might be seen as a minor &quot;imago&quot; of the goddess. Her habit of deceiving her male pursuers by hiding in crags in the soil reveals her association not only with vegetation but also with rocks, caverns, and underpassages. Her nature looks to be also associated with vegetation and nurture: G. Dumezil has proved that Helernus was a god of vegetation, vegetative lushness and orchards, particularly associated with vetch. As Ovid writes in his &quot;Fasti&quot;, 1 June was the festival day of Carna, besides being the calendary festival of the month of Juno and the festival of Juno Moneta. Ovid seems to purposefully conflate and identify Carna with Cardea in the aetiologic myth related above. Consequently, the association of both Janus and the god Helernus with Carna-Crane is highlighted in this myth: it was customary on that day to eat ivetch (mashed beans) and lard, which were supposed to strengthen the body. Cardea had also magic powers for protecting doorways (by touching thresholds and posts with wet hawthorn twigs) and newborn children by the aggression of the striges (in the myth the young Proca). M. Renard sees the association of Janus with Crane as reminiscent of widespread rites of lustration and fertility performed through ritual walking under low crags or holes in the soil or natural hollows in trees, which in turn are reflected in the lustrative rite of the Tigillum Sororium.

Macrobius relates that Janus was supposed to have shared a kingdom with Camese in Latium, in a place then named Camesene. He states that Hyginus recorded the tale on the authority of a Protarchus of Tralles. In Macrobius Camese is a male: after Camese&#x27;s death Janus reigned alone. However Greek authors make of Camese Janus&#x27;s sister and spouse: Atheneus citing a certain Drakon of Corcyra writes that Janus fathered with his sister Camese a son named Aithex and a daughter named Olistene. Servius Danielis states Tiber (i.e., Tiberinus) was their son.

Arnobius writes that Fontus was the son of Janus and Juturna. The name itself proves that this is a secondary form of Fons modelled on Janus, denouncing the late character of this myth: it was probably conceived because of the proximity of the festivals of Juturna (11 January) and the Agonium of Janus (9 January) as well as for the presence of an altar of Fons near the Janiculum and the closeness of the notions of spring and of beginning.

Plutarch writes that according to some Janus was a Greek from Perrhebia.

After Romulus and his men kidnapped the Sabine women, and Rome was attacked by the Sabines under king Tatius, Janus caused a volcanic hot spring to erupt, resulting in the would-be attackers being buried alive in the deathly hot, brutal water and ash mixture of the rushing hot volcanic springs that killed, burned, or disfigured many of Tatius&#x27;s men. This spring is called Lautolae by Varro. Later on, however, the Sabines and Romans agreed on creating a new community together. In honor of this, the doors of a walled roofless structure called &#x27;The Janus&#x27; (not a temple) were kept open during war after a symbolic contingent of soldiers had marched through it. The doors were closed in ceremony when peace was concluded.

== Origin, legends, and history ==

In accord with his fundamental character of being the Beginner, Janus was considered by Romans the first king of Latium, sometimes along with Camese. He would have received hospitably the god Saturn, who, expelled from Heaven by Jupiter, arrived on a ship to the Janiculum. Janus would have also effected the miracle of turning the waters of the spring at the foot of the Viminal from cold to scorching hot to fend off the assault of the Sabines of king Titus Tatius, come to avenge the kidnapping of their daughters by the Romans.

His temple named Janus Geminus had to stand open in times of war. It was said to have been built by king Numa Pompilius, who kept it always shut during his reign as there were no wars. After him it was closed very few times, one after the end of the first Punic War, three times under Augustus and once by Nero. It is recorded that emperor Gordianus III opened the Janus Geminus.

It is a noteworthy curiosity that the opening of the Janus was perhaps the last act connected to the ancient religion in Rome: Procopius writes that in 536, during the Gothic War, while general Belisarius was under siege in Rome, at night somebody opened the Janus Geminus stealthily, which had stayed closed since the 390 edict of Theodosius I that banned the ancient cults. Janus was faithful to his liminal role also in the marking of this last act.

===Distant origin hypothesis===
The uniqueness of Janus in Latium has suggested to L. Adams Holland and J. Gagé the hypothesis of a cult brought from far away by sailors and strictly linked to the amphibious life of the primitive communities living on the banks of the Tiber. In the myth of Janus, the ship of Saturn, as well as the myth of Carmenta and Evander are reminiscent of an ancient pre-Roman sailing life. The elements that seem to connect Janus to sailing are presented in two articles by J. Gagé summarised here below.

====1. The boat of Janus and the beliefs of the primitive sailing techniques====

;(a) The proximity of Janus and Portunus and the functions of the &quot;flamen Portunalis&quot;: The temple of Janus was dedicated by Gaius Duilius on 17 August, day of the Portunalia. The key was the symbol of both gods and was also meant to signify that the boarding boat was a peaceful merchant boat.

:The &quot;flamen Portunalis&quot; oiled the arms of Quirinus with an ointment kept in a peculiar container named &quot;persillum&quot;, term perhaps derived from Etruscan &quot;persie&quot;. A similar object seems to be represented in a fresco picture of the Calendar of Ostia on which young boys prepare to apply a resin contained in a basin to a boat on a cart, i.e. yet to be launched.

;(b) The &quot;Tigillum Sororium&quot;: The &quot;Tigillum Sororium&quot; would be related to a gentilician cult of wood of the Horatii, as surmised by the episodes of the &quot;pons sublicius&quot; defended by Horatius Cocles, and of the posts of the main entrance of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus on which Marcus Horatius Pulvillus lay his hand during the dedication rite. Gagé thinks the magic power of the &quot;Tigillum Sororium&quot; should be ascribed to the lively and burgeoning nature of wood.

====2. Religious quality of trees====
Trees as the wild olive, and the Greek or Italic lotus (&quot;Celtis australis&quot;), have analogous religious qualities to those of corniolum and wild fig for sailing communities: its wood does not rot in sea water, thence it was used in shipbuilding and in the making of rolls for hauling of ships overland.

====3. The depiction of Janus and Boreas as bifrons====
The depiction of both Janus and Boreas as bifrons, and seasonal elements.

;(a) The calendar of Numa and the role of Janus: Contradictions of the ancient Roman calendar on the beginning of the new year: originally March was the first month and February the last one. January, the month of Janus, became the first after several changes in the calendar. The liminal character of Janus is still present in the association to the Saturnalia of December, reflecting the strict relationship between the two gods Janus and Saturn and the rather blurred distinction of their stories and symbols.

:The initial role of Janus in the political-religious operations of January: the &quot;nuncupatio votorum&quot; spanning the year, the imperial symbol of the boat in the opening rite of the sailing season, the &quot;vota felicia&quot;: Janus and his myths allow for an ancient interpretation of the &quot;vota felicia&quot;, different from the Isiadic one.

;(b) The idea of the Seasons in the ancient traditions of the Ionian Islands: The crossing of the Hyperborean myths. Cephalonia as a place at the cross of famous winds. Application of the theory of winds for the navigation in the Ionian Sea. The type &quot;Boreas Bifrons&quot; as probable model of the Roman Janus.

:This observation was made first by the &quot;Roscher Lexicon&quot;: &quot;Ianus is he too, doubtlessly, a god of wind&quot; Grimal has taken up this interpretation connecting it to a vase with red figures representing Boreas pursuing the nymph Oreithyia: Boreas is depicted as a two headed winged demon, the two faces with beards, one black and the other fair, perhaps symbolising the double movement of the winds Boreas and Antiboreas. This proves that the Greeks of the 5th century BC knew the image of Janus. Gagé feels compelled to mention here another parallel with Janus to be found in the figure of Argos with one hundred eyes and in his association with his murderer Hermes.

;(c) Solar, solsticial and cosmological elements: While there is no direct proof of an original solar meaning of Janus, this being the issue of learned speculations of the Roman erudits initiated into the mysteries and of emperors as Domitian, the derivation from a Syrian cosmogonic deity proposed by P. Grimal looks more acceptable. Gagé though sees an ancient, preclassical Greek mythic substratum to which belong Deucalion and Pyrrha, and the Hyperborean origins of the Delphic cult of Apollo, as well as the Argonauts. The beliefs in the magic power of trees is reflected in the use of the olive wood, as for the rolls of the ship Argos: the myth of the Argonauts has links with Corcyra, remembered by Lucius Ampelius.

====4. The sites of the cults of Janus at Rome====
The sites of the cults of Janus at Rome and his associations in ancient Latium.

;(a) &quot;Argiletum&quot;: Varro gives either the myth of the killing of Argos as an etymology of the word Argi-letum (death of Argos), which looks to be purely fantastic, or that of place located upon a soil of clay, &quot;argilla&quot; in Latin. The place so named stood at the foot of the Viminal, the hill of the reeds. It could also be referred to the white willow tree, used to make objects of trelliswork.

;(b) The Janiculum: The Janiculum may have been inhabited by people who were not Latin but had close alliances with Rome. The right bank of the Tiber would constitute a typical, convenient, commodious landing place for boats and the cult of Janus would have been double insofar as amphibious.

;(c) Janus in Latium: Janus&#x27;s cultic alliances and relations in Latium show a pre-Latin character. Janus has no association in cult (calendar or prayer &quot;formulae&quot;) with any other entity. Even though he bears the epithet of &quot;Pater&quot; he is not head of a divine family; however some testimonies lend him a companion, sometimes female, and a son and / or a daughter. They belong to the family of the nymphs or genies of springs. Janus intervenes in the miracle of the hot spring during the battle between Romulus and Tatius: Juturna and the nymphs of the springs are clearly related to Janus as well as Venus, that in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; cooperates in the miracle and may have been confused with Venilia, or perhaps the two might have been originally one.

:Janus has a direct link only to Venilia, with whom he fathered Canens. The magic role of the wild olive tree (&quot;oleaster&quot;) is prominent in the description of the duel between Aeneas and Turnus reflecting its religious significance and powers: it was sacred to sailors, also those who had shipwrecked as a protecting guide to the shore. It was probably venerated by a Prelatin culture in association with Faunus.

:In the story of Venulus coming back from Apulia too one may see the religious connotation of the wild olive: the king discovers one into which a local shepherd had been turned for failing to respect the nymphs he had come across in a nearby cavern, apparently Venilia, who was the deity associated with the magic virtues of such tree.

:Gagé finds it remarkable that the characters related to Janus are in the &quot;Aeneis&quot; on the side of the Rutuli. In the poem Janus would be represented by Tiberinus. Olistene, the daughter of Janus with Camese, may reflect in her name that of the olive or &quot;oleaster&quot;, or of Oreithyia. Camese may be reflected in Carmenta: Evander&#x27;s mother is from Arcadia, comes to Latium as an exile migrant and has her two festivals in January: Camese&#x27;s name at any rate does not look Latin.

====5. Sociological remarks====

;(a) The vagueness of Janus&#x27;s association with the cults of primitive Latium: The vagueness of Janus&#x27;s association with the cults of primitive Latium and his indifference towards the social composition of the Roman State suggest that he was a god of an earlier amphibious merchant society in which the role of the guardian god was indispensable.

;(b) Janus bifrons and the Penates: Even though the cult of Janus cannot be confused with that of the Penates, related with Dardanian migrants from Troy, the binary nature of the Penates and of Janus postulates a correspondent ethnic or social organisation. Here the model is thought to be provided by the cult of the &quot;Magni Dei&quot; or Cabeiri preserved at Samothrace and worshipped particularly among sailing merchants.

:The aetiological myth is noteworthy too: at the beginning one finds Dardanos and his brother Iasios appearing as auxiliary figures in a Phrygian cult to a Great Mother.

:In Italy there is a trace of a conflict between worshippers of the Argive Hera (Diomedes and the Diomedians of the south) and of the Penates. The cult of Janus looks to be related to social groups remained at the fringe of the Phrygian ones. They might or might not have been related to the cult of the Dioscuri.

== Relationship with other gods ==

=== Janus and Juno ===
The relationship between Janus and Juno is defined by the closeness of the notions of beginning and transition and the functions of conception and delivery. The reader is referred to the above sections &quot;Cult epithets&quot; and &quot;Tigillum Sororium&quot; of this article and the corresponding section of article Juno.

=== Janus and Quirinus ===
Quirinus is a god that incarnates the &quot;quirites&quot;, i.e. the Romans in their civil capacity of producers and fathers. He is surnamed &quot;Mars tranquillus&quot; (peaceful Mars), &quot;Mars qui praeest paci&quot; (Mars who presides on peace). His function of &quot;custos&quot; guardian is highlighted by the location of his temple inside the pomerium but not far from the gate of Porta Collina or Quirinalis, near the shrines of Sancus and Salus.

As a protector of peace he is nevertheless armed, in the same way as the &quot;quirites&quot; are, as they are potentially &quot;milites&quot; soldiers: his statue represents him is holding a spear. For this reason Janus, god of gates, is concerned with his function of protector of the civil community. For the same reason the flamen Portunalis oiled the arms of Quirinus, implying that they were to be kept in good order and ready even though they were not to be used immediately.

Dumézil and Schilling remark that as a god of the third function Quirinus is peaceful and represents the ideal of the &quot;pax romana&quot; i. e. a peace resting on victory.

=== Janus and Portunus ===
Portunus may be defined as a sort of duplication inside the scope of the powers and attributes of Janus. His original definition shows he was the god of gates and doors and of harbours. In fact it is debated whether his original function was only that of god of gates and the function of god of harbours was a later addition: Paul the Deacon writes:
: &quot;... he is depicted holding a key in his hand and was thought to be the god of gates&quot;.

Varro would have stated that he was the god of harbours and patron of gates. His festival day named Portunalia fell on 17 August, and he was venerated on that day in a temple &quot;ad pontem Aemilium&quot; and &quot;ad pontem Sublicium&quot; that had been dedicated on that date.

Portunus, unlike Janus, had his own flamen, named &quot;Portunalis&quot;. It is noteworthy that the temple of Janus in the Forum Holitorium had been consecrated on the day of the Portunalia, and that the flamen Portunalis was in charge of oiling the arms of the statue of Quirinus.

=== Janus and Vesta ===
The relationship between Janus and Vesta touches on the question of the nature and function of the gods of beginning and ending in Indo-European religion. While Janus has the first place, Vesta has the last, both in theology and in ritual (&quot;Ianus primus, Vesta extrema&quot;).

The last place implies a direct connexion with the situation of the worshipper, in space and in time. Vesta is thence the goddess of the hearth of homes as well as of the city. Her inextinguishable fire is a means for men (as individuals and as a community) to keep in touch with the realm of gods. Thus there is a reciprocal link between the god of beginnings and unending motion, who bestows life to the beings of this world (Cerus Manus) as well as presiding over its end, and the goddess of the hearth of man, which symbolises through fire the presence of life. Vesta is a virgin goddess, but at the same time she is called a &#x27;mother&#x27; of Rome: She is thought to be indispensable to the existence and survival of the community.

== Janus in Etruria ==
It has long been believed that Janus was present among the theonyms on the outer rim of the Piacenza Liver in case 3, under the name of Aaron. This fact created a problem as the god of beginnings looked to be located in a situation other than the initial, i.e. the first case. After the new readings proposed by A. Maggiani, in case 3 one should read TINS: the difficulty has thus dissolved. Aaron has thence been eliminated from Franciscan theology as this was his only attestation. Maggiani remarks that this earlier identification was in contradiction with the testimony ascribed to Varro by Johannes Lydus that Janus was named &quot;caelum&quot; among the Etruscans.

On the other hand, as expected Janus is present in region I of Martianus Capella&#x27;s division of Heaven and in region XVI, the last one, are to be found the &quot;&quot; (along with Nocturnus), perhaps to be identified in Forculus, Limentinus and Cardea, deities strictly related to Janus as his auxiliaries (or perhaps even no more than concrete subdivisions of his functions) as the meaning of their names implies: Forculus is the god of the &quot;forca&quot;, a &quot;iugum&quot;, low passage, Limentinus the guardian of the &quot;limes&quot;, boundary, Cardea the goddess of hinges, here of the gates separating Earth and Heaven.

The problem posed by the qualifying adjective &quot;terrestres&quot; earthly, can be addressed in two different ways.
One hypothesis is that Martianus&#x27;s depiction implies a descent from Heaven onto Earth. However Martianus&#x27;s depiction does not look to be confined to a division Heaven-Earth as it includes the Underworld and other obscure regions or remote recesses of Heaven. Thence one may argue that the articulation Ianus-Ianitores could be interpreted as connected to the idea of the Gates of Heaven (the &quot;Synplegades&quot;) which open on the Heaven on one side and on Earth or the Underworld on the other.

From other archaeological documents though it has become clear that the Etruscans had another god who was double-faced like Janus: Culśanś, of which there is a bronze statuette from Cortona (now at Cortona Museum). While Janus is a bearded adult, Culśans is an unbearded youth, making his identification with Hermes look possible. However, his name is also connected with the Etruscan word for doors and gates.

According to Capdeville, Culśans may also be found on the outer rim of the Piacenza Liver, on case 14, in the compound form &quot;CULALP&quot;, i.e., &quot;of Culśans and of Alpan(u)&quot; on the authority of Pfiffig, but perhaps here it indicates instead the female goddess Culśu, the guardian of the door of the Underworld. Although the location is not strictly identical, there is some approximation in his situations on the Liver and in Martianus&#x27; system.

A. Audin connects the figure of Janus to Culśans and Turms (Etruscan rendering of Hermes, the Greek god mediator between the different worlds, brought by the Etruscan from the Aegean Sea), considering these last two Etruscan deities as the same. This interpretation would then identify Janus with Greek god Hermes. Etruscan medals from Volterra too show the double-headed god and the Janus Quadrifrons from Falerii may have an Etruscan origin.

== Association with non-Roman gods ==
Roman and Greek authors maintained Janus was an exclusively Roman god. This claim is excessive according to R. Schilling, at least as far as iconography is concerned. A god with two faces appears repeatedly in Sumerian and Babylonian art.
The ancient Sumerian deity Isimud was commonly portrayed with two faces facing in opposite directions. Sumerian depictions of Isimud are often very similar to the typical portrayals of Janus in ancient Roman art. Unlike Janus, however, Isimud is not a god of doorways. Instead, he is the messenger of Enki, the ancient Sumerian god of water and civilization. Reproductions of the image of Isimud, whose Babylonian name was Usimu, on cylinders in Sumero-Accadic art can to be found in H. Frankfort&#x27;s work &quot;Cylinder seals&quot; (London 1939) especially in plates at p. 106, 123, 132, 133, 137, 165, 245, 247, 254. On plate XXI, c, Usimu is seen while introducing worshippers to a seated god.

Janus-like heads of gods related to Hermes have been found in Greece, perhaps suggesting a compound god.

William Betham argued that the cult arrived from the Middle East and that Janus corresponds to the &quot;Baal-ianus&quot; or Belinus of the Chaldeans, sharing a common origin with the Oannes of Berosus.

P. Grimal considers Janus a conflation of a Roman god of doorways and an ancient Syro-Hittite uranic cosmogonic god.

The Roman statue of the Janus of the Argiletum, traditionally ascribed to Numa, was possibly very ancient, perhaps a sort of xoanon, like the Greek ones of the 8th century BC.

In Hinduism, the image of double- or four-faced gods is quite common, as it is a symbolic depiction of the divine power of seeing through space and time. The supreme god Brahma is represented with four faces. Another instance of a four-faced god is the Slavic god Svetovid.

Other analogous or comparable deities of the &quot;prima&quot; in Indo-European religions have been analysed by G. Dumézil. They include the Indian goddess Aditi who is called &quot;two-faced&quot; as she is the one who starts and concludes ceremonies, and Scandinavian god Heimdallr. The theological features of Heimdallr look similar to Janus&#x27;s: both in space and time he stands at the limits. His abode is at the limits of Earth, at the extremity of Heaven; he is the protector of the gods; his birth is at the beginning of time; he is the forefather of mankind, the generator of classes and the founder of the social order. Nonetheless he is inferior to the sovereign god Oðinn: the &quot;Minor Völuspá&quot; defines his relationship to Oðinn almost with the same terms as those in which Varro defines that of Janus, god of the &quot;prima&quot; to Jupiter, god of the &quot;summa&quot;: Heimdallr is born as the &quot;firstborn &quot;(&quot;primigenius&quot;, &quot;var einn borinn í árdaga&quot;), Oðinn is born as the &quot;greatest&quot; (&quot;maximus&quot;, &quot;var einn borinn öllum meiri&quot;). Analogous Iranian &quot;formulae&quot; are to be found in an Avestic &quot;gāthā&quot; (Gathas). In other towns of ancient Latium the function of presiding over beginnings was probably performed by other deities of feminine sex, notably the &quot;Fortuna Primigenia&quot; of Praeneste.

== Legacy ==

In the Middle Ages, Janus was taken as the symbol of Genoa, whose Medieval Latin name was &quot;Ianua&quot;, as well as of other European communes. The &quot;comune&quot; of Selvazzano di Dentro near Padua has a grove and an altar of Janus depicted on its standard, but their existence is unproved.

In demonology, Janus is corrupted into Bifrons, and is described by grimoires such as &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; as a demonic earl in charge of moving bodies into graves and lighting candles over them, possibly suggesting the retention of Janus&#x27; role as a deity of endings and guardian of passages.

In Act I Scene 1 of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Merchant of Venice&quot;, Salarino refers to the two-headed Janus while failing to find the reason of Antonio&#x27;s melancholy. In Act I Scene 2 of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;, Iago invokes the name of Janus after the failure of his plot against the titular character.

In her 1921 book &quot;The Witch-Cult in Western Europe&quot;, folklorist Margaret Murray claimed that evidence found in records of the early modern witch trials showed the witches&#x27; god, usually identified in the records as the Devil, was in fact often a male priest dressed in a double mask representing Janus. Murray traced the presence of a man dressed with a mask on the back of his head at some witch meetings to confessions of accused witches in the Pyrenees region, and one statement in particular that the leader of the witches appeared &quot;comme le dieu Janus&quot; (&quot;as the god Janus&quot;). Via the etymology given by James Frazier, Murray further connected the figure on Janus or Dianus in the witch-cult with the more well known goddess of witchcraft, Diana. Both Murray&#x27;s contemporaries and modern scholars have argued that Murray&#x27;s hypothesis and the connections she drew between Janus and Diana, and linking the early modern witch trials with ancient pagan beliefs, are dubious.

Janus Films, a film distribution company founded in 1956, takes its name from the god and features a two-faced Janus as its logo.

The Janus Society was an early homophile organization founded in 1962 and based in Philadelphia. It is notable as the publisher of &quot;DRUM&quot; magazine, one of the earliest gay-interest publications in the United States and most widely circulated in the 1960s, and for its role in organizing many of the nation&#x27;s earliest gay rights demonstrations. The organization focused on a policy of militant respectability, a strategy demanding respect by showing the public gay individuals conforming to hetero-normative standards of dress at protests.

The Society of Janus is the second BDSM organization founded in the United States (after The Eulenspiegel Society), and is a San Francisco, California based BDSM education and support group. It was founded in August 1974 by the late Cynthia Slater and Larry Olsen. According to the Leather Hall of Fame biography of Slater, she said of the Society of Janus:There were three basic reasons why we chose Janus. First of all, Janus has two faces, which we interpreted as the duality of SM (one&#x27;s dominant and submissive sides). Second, he&#x27;s the Roman god of portals, and more importantly, of beginnings and endings. To us, it represents the beginning of one&#x27;s acceptance of self, the beginning of freedom from guilt, and the eventual ending of self-loathing and fear over one&#x27;s SM desires. And third, Janus is the Roman god of war—the war we fight against stereotypes commonly held against us.In the 1987 thriller novel &quot;The Janus Man&quot; by British novelist Raymond Harold Sawkins, Janus is used as a metaphor for a Soviet agent infiltrated into British Secret Intelligence Service – &quot;The Janus Man who faces both East and West&quot;.

In the 1995 spy film &quot;GoldenEye&quot; in the James Bond film series, the main antagonist Alec Trevelyan calls himself the code name &quot;Janus&quot; after he betrays Bond and subsequently MI6 after learning he is a Lienz Cossack. Bond, portrayed by Pierce Brosnan, goes on to state, &quot;Hence, Janus. The two-faced Roman god come to life,&quot; after learning of Trevelyan&#x27;s betrayal.

The University of Maryland&#x27;s undergraduate history journal, created in 2000, is named &quot;Janus&quot;.

Cats with the congenital disorder diprosopus, which causes the face to be partly or completely duplicated on the head, are known as Janus cats.

In the 1995 game, Chrono Trigger, Janus is the young prince of Zeal Kingdom and later becomes the Demon King Magus.

In 2020, the character Deceit from the series &quot;Sanders Sides&quot;, created by Thomas Sanders, revealed his name to be Janus in the episode &quot;Putting Others First&quot;.

In Cassandra Clare&#x27;s &quot;The Shadowhunter Chronicles&quot;, the counterpart of Jace Herondale from an alternate dimension called Thule chooses the name &quot;Janus&quot; for himself after the Roman god.

Janus particles are engineered micro- or nano-scopic particles possessing two distinct faces which have distinct physical or chemical properties.

&quot;Janus&quot; is the name of a time-reversible programming language. It is also the name of a concurrent constraint programming language.

William Janus is a minor character in the American sitcom &quot;South Park&quot; who suffers from dissociative identity disorder; his surname is derived from the Roman god.

<text>Janus is an inner satellite of Saturn. It is also known as Saturn X. It is named after the mythological Janus. This natural satellite was first identified by Audouin Dollfus on December 15, 1966, although it had been unknowingly photographed earlier by Jean Texereau. Further observations led to the realization that Janus shares a unique orbital relationship with another moon, Epimetheus. The discovery of these two moons&#x27; peculiar co-orbital configuration was later confirmed by Voyager 1 in 1980.

==History==

=== Discovery ===
Janus was identified by Audouin Dollfus on 15 December 1966 and given the temporary designation . Previously, had photographed Janus on 29 October 1966 without realising it. On 18 December, Richard Walker observed an object in the same orbit as Janus, but whose position could not be reconciled with the previous observations. Twelve years later, in October 1978, Stephen M. Larson and John W. Fountain realised that the 1966 observations were best explained by two distinct objects (Janus and Epimetheus) sharing very similar orbits, Walker is now credited with the discovery of Epimetheus. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; confirmed this orbital configuration in 1980.

===Observational history===
Janus was observed on subsequent occasions and given different provisional designations. &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; three energetic-particle detectors detected its &quot;shadow&quot; when the probe flew by Saturn on 1 September 1979 (&#x27;). Janus was observed by Dan Pascu on 19 February 1980 (&#x27;), and then by John W. Fountain, Stephen M. Larson, Harold J. Reitsema and Bradford A. Smith on 23 February 1980 ().

=== Name ===
Janus is named after the two-faced Roman god Janus. Although the name was informally proposed soon after the initial 1966 discovery, it was not officially adopted until 1983, when Epimetheus was also named.

== Orbit ==

Janus&#x27;s orbit is co-orbital with that of Epimetheus. Janus&#x27;s mean orbital radius from Saturn was, as of 2006, only 50 km less than that of Epimetheus, a distance smaller than either moon&#x27;s mean radius. In accordance with Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion, the closer orbit is completed more quickly. Because of the small difference, it is completed in only about 30 seconds less. Each day, the inner moon is an additional 0.25° farther around Saturn than the outer moon. As the inner moon catches up to the outer moon, their mutual gravitational attraction increases the inner moon&#x27;s momentum and decreases that of the outer moon. This added momentum means that the inner moon&#x27;s distance from Saturn and orbital period are increased, and in exchange the outer moon&#x27;s are decreased. The timing and magnitude of the momentum exchange is such that the moons effectively swap orbits, never approaching closer than about 10,000 km. At each encounter Janus&#x27;s orbital radius changes by ~20 km and Epimetheus&#x27;s by ~80 km: Janus&#x27;s orbit is less affected because it is four times as massive as Epimetheus. 

The exchange takes place close to every four years; the last close approaches occurred in January 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018, and 2022 and the next in 2026. This is the only such orbital configuration known in the Solar System.

The orbital relationship between Janus and Epimetheus can be understood in terms of the circular restricted three-body problem, as a case in which the two moons (the third body being Saturn) are similar in size to each other.

== Physical characteristics ==

Janus is extensively cratered with several craters larger than 30 km and has few linear features. Janus&#x27;s surface appears to be older than Prometheus&#x27;s but younger than Pandora&#x27;s. 
Janus has a very low density and relatively high albedo, meaning that it is likely icy in composition and structurally a rubble pile object.

===Features===
Craters on Janus, like those on Epimetheus, are named after characters in the legend of Castor and Pollux.

== Interactions with rings ==

A faint dust ring is present around the region occupied by the orbits of Janus and Epimetheus, as revealed by images taken in forward-scattered light by the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft in 2006. The ring has a radial extent of about 5000 km. Its source is particles blasted off their surfaces by meteoroid impacts, which then form a diffuse ring around their orbital paths.

Along with Epimetheus, Janus acts as a shepherd moon, maintaining the sharp outer edge of the A Ring in a 7:6 orbital resonance. The effect is more obvious when the more massive Janus is on the resonant (inner) orbit.

== In fiction ==
Janus is the location of the plot in the Alastair Reynolds science-fiction novel Pushing Ice.

<text>Shad Gregory Moss (born March 9, 1987), better known by his stage name Bow Wow (formerly Lil&#x27; Bow Wow), is an American rapper and actor. His career began upon being discovered by rapper Snoop Dogg in 1993 at the age of six; five years later, he signed with record producer Jermaine Dupri&#x27;s So So Def Recordings, an imprint of Columbia Records. As Lil&#x27; Bow Wow, he released his debut studio album, &quot;Beware of Dog&quot; (2000) at age 13, and his second album, &quot;Doggy Bag&quot; (2001) the following year. Both met with commercial success, the albums peaked at numbers ten and 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, respectively.

Moss then parted ways with So So Def and signed with its parent label, Columbia Records, to release his third album, &quot;Unleashed&quot; (2003). It peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was his first release after dropping &quot;Lil&#x27;&quot; from his stage name. His fourth album, &quot;Wanted&quot; (2005), spawned the singles &quot;Let Me Hold You&quot; (featuring Omarion) and &quot;Like You&quot; (featuring Ciara), which peaked at numbers four and three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively, and remain his highest-charting songs. His 2006 single, &quot;Shortie Like Mine&quot; (featuring Chris Brown and Johntá Austin), peaked within the chart&#x27;s top ten and preceded the release of his fifth album, &quot;The Price of Fame&quot; (2006). His sixth, &quot;New Jack City II&quot; (2009), was met with trailing critical and commercial response, serving as his final album on a major label. He briefly signed with Birdman&#x27;s Cash Money Records in 2009 to release a series of promotional singles—including &quot;Ain&#x27;t Thinkin&#x27; &#x27;Bout You&quot; (featuring Chris Brown) and &quot;Sweat&quot; (featuring Lil Wayne)—leading up to his seventh album &quot;Underrated&quot;, which remains unreleased. He then signed with Puff Daddy&#x27;s Bad Boy Records in 2015, and likewise released no albums with the label.

Moss first appeared in the 2002 film &quot;All About the Benjamins&quot; as a cameo. That same year, Moss was cast in the lead role for the sports comedy film, &quot;Like Mike&quot;. He later starred in the films &quot;Johnson Family Vacation&quot; in 2004 and &quot;Roll Bounce&quot; in 2005. He played a supporting role in the film &quot;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift&quot; in 2006, a character he reprised in &quot;F9&quot; (2021). Moss appeared in five episodes of the television series &quot;Entourage&quot;, and starred as Brody Nelson in &quot;&quot; until the show&#x27;s 2016 cancellation.

== Life and career ==

=== 1987–2001: Early life and &quot;Beware of Dog&quot; ===
Bow Wow was born Shad Gregory Moss in Columbus, Ohio, the son of Teresa Rena Caldwell (née Jones) and Alfonso Preston Moss. At age three, he became interested in rap. Under the moniker &quot;Kid Gangsta&quot;, he began rapping recreationally at age six; he was also a fan of N.W.A at that age. In 1993, he performed at a concert in Los Angeles, and was noticed by rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg, who subsequently gave him a stage name, &quot;Lil&#x27; Bow Wow&quot;. He then appeared on the &quot;Doggystyle&quot; album on the track, &quot;Gz and Hustlas&quot;, and on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; in late 1993. He also appeared in the &quot;Gin and Juice&quot; music video. Furthermore, he was supposed to appear on the &quot;Murder Was the Case&quot; soundtrack with the song &quot;After 3&quot;, featuring Kurupt, Jewell, and CPO Boss Hogg, but it remained in the vault until the early 2010s.

In 1998, at the age of eleven, Bow Wow met record producer Jermaine Dupri, who helped shape his career. In 1999, the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; featured his song &quot;Stick Up&quot; with Dupri.

The Recording Industry Association of America certified &quot;Beware of Dog&quot; double platinum on March 5, 2001, signifying sales of two million copies. In a 2009 interview, the rapper claimed that the album had sold over 3 million copies since its release.

Bow Wow dropped the &quot;Lil&#x27;&quot; from his stage name in April 2002; he told &quot;MTV News&quot;: &quot;I changed my name because I&#x27;m getting older now and it&#x27;s too many Lil&#x27;s. All these Lil&#x27; rappers, I&#x27;m just kind of getting real irritated by it. I said, &#x27;You know what? Drop the Lil&#x27;. Forget it. I&#x27;m Bow Wow. Besides, I&#x27;m growing up, I&#x27;m not little anymore. [I just decided that] two weeks ago. I really got irritable. It&#x27;s all these Lil&#x27; cats, forget it. I&#x27;m Bow Wow now. Everything is just &#x27;Bow Wow,&#x27; no &#x27;Lil&#x27; Bow Wow.&#x27;&quot;

=== 2003–2006: &quot;Unleashed, Wanted&quot; and &quot;The Price of Fame&quot; ===
The first album released under his new name was &quot;Unleashed&quot; in 2003. Its first single was &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Down&quot; featuring Birdman, the founder of Cash Money Records, which reached #14 on the Hot 100 and #6 on the Hot Rap Tracks charts. The second single was then released, &quot;My Baby&quot;, featuring Jagged Edge. Unlike his previous albums, this one was not produced under the mentorship of Jermaine Dupri. Guest appearances include Jagged Edge, Birdman, Mario, and Amerie. &quot;Unleashed&quot; was certified gold on September 25, 2003. Bow Wow appeared on the remix of JoJo&#x27;s single &quot;Baby It&#x27;s You&quot; in 2004.

&quot;Wanted&quot; was released in 2005. Its first single was &quot;Let Me Hold You&quot;, featuring Omarion, and peaked at #1 on the rap chart and #4 on the Hot 100. The next single, &quot;Like You&quot;, featuring Ciara, coincided with the beginning of Bow Wow&#x27;s relationship with the singer. &quot;Fresh Azimiz&quot;, featured J-Kwon and Jermaine Dupri, followed and peaked at #23 on the Hot 100 and #6 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart.

Bow Wow and Omarion released a collaborative album on December 11, 2007, &quot;Face Off&quot;. The first single was &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, which peaked at #33 on the Hot 100. The second single was &quot;Hey Baby (Jump Off)&quot;. He released a mixtape title &quot;Half Man, Half Dog Vol. 1&quot; that year. &quot;Half Man, Half Dog Vol. 2&quot; was released as a sequel to the mixtape in February 2009.

&quot;New Jack City II&quot;, his sixth album, was released in March 2009 was his first album to include a Parental Advisory: Steven Roberts of MTV News observed that this album explored &quot;the influence of crack cocaine in inner-city communities&quot;, and featured such guests as T.I.

Three promo singles were released in late 2008: &quot;Marco Polo&quot; featuring Soulja Boy, &quot;Big Girls&quot;, and &quot;Roc The Mic&quot;. The first official single, &quot;You Can Get It All&quot; featuring Johntá Austin, samples TLC&#x27;s &quot;Baby-Baby-Baby&quot; and peaked at #55 on the Hot 100 and #9 on the Hot Rap Tracks. On July 4, 2009, his new song &quot;I Know I&#x27;m The Shit&quot; off his DJ Drama-hosted mixtape, makes a references working on his new album &quot;Underrated&quot; and that it is already in production. On August 16, Bow Wow announced his signing to Cash Money Records, joining an all-star roster that already includes Nicki Minaj, Drake, Lil Wayne and Birdman, among others.

=== 2010–present ===
Bow Wow planned to release his new then-titled album &quot;Underrated&quot; on Cash Money Records, but the record underwent a number of delays and, in mid-November 2011, Bow Wow announced on his blog that the record wouldn&#x27;t be out before 2012. The album was intended to feature Birdman, Boyz II Men, Chris Brown, DJ Khaled, Fabolous, Game, Lil Wayne, Lloyd Banks, Meek Mill, Nas, Nelly, Sean Kingston, Snoop Dogg, DMX, Styles P and Talib Kweli. The first promo single being &quot;For My Hood&quot;, featuring DJ Khaled &amp; Sean Kingston.

On November 1, 2010, Bow Wow released his first promotional single from the album entitled &quot;Ain&#x27;t Thinkin&#x27; &#x27;Bout You&quot; featuring Chris Brown. The music video was a success on &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot; and made the countdown in just one day. Two weeks later, it peaked at #1 on the show&#x27;s charts and remained #1 for three days. On June 2, 2011, a song from his album called &quot;I&#x27;m Da Man&quot;, which features Chris Brown, was leaked and wasn&#x27;t the first official single from the album. On October 24, 2011, Bow Wow released the single entitled &quot;Sweat&quot; featuring Lil Wayne, and though it was thought to be the first official single from the album, it was also dubbed by Bow Wow as a promotional single.

On May 18, 2012, after several delays, Bow Wow released the first single from the album titled &quot;Better&quot; featuring T-Pain. The music video for the song was directed by Bow Wow&#x27;s personal cameraman Rico Da Crook and was a success on &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot; and made it to the top of the countdown. On June 26, 2012, Bow Wow released the second single from the album titled &quot;We In Da Club&quot; and was produced by DJ Mustard. The song went nowhere on any billboard charts, but the video was also another success on &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot; making it to the top of the countdown. The third single scheduled from the album was intended to feature Miguel that was titled &quot;Right Now&quot;. Later, there was an announcement that Universal Republic Records was going defunct; all of the artists on the roster that were moved from the label, including Bow Wow, were moved to Republic Records, making the label itself revived.

On August 10, 2013, via his official YouTube page, Bow Wow stated the reason that &quot;Underrated&quot; had been delayed was the result of raising his daughter and waiting until he was more mature; he also stated he planned on working on and releasing the album after he turned 28. On June 24, 2014, Bow Wow announced via Instagram that after the 2014 BET Awards, he was going by his real name Shad Moss, claiming that he made a lot of history as Bow Wow and that it was now time for &quot;the next chapter and challenge&quot;. He stated that &quot;Bow Wow&quot; no longer fit with his new personality as he was now a father, host, and actor, and he had matured from what he had been early on in his life.

In May 2015, with his long-delayed album with Cash Money still without a release date, Bow Wow announced that he had amicably parted ways with Cash Money Records so he could move on with his music career. He said, &quot;I wanna dictate when my music come out. I&#x27;m tired of going to the studio to make records and then I listen to them. &#x27;Cuz then they get old. Then when y&#x27;all ask for new music I don&#x27;t wanna hear it &#x27;cuz I&#x27;ve been listening to it for two or three months. I just can&#x27;t be held up up by nobody. It&#x27;s as simple as that. I got a daughter. I got a family I gotta provide for.&quot;

On September 27, 2015, Bow Wow signed to Puff Daddy&#x27;s record label Bad Boy Records. He then named the members of his new management team and finished the post by writing, &quot;Making money won&#x27;t be the issue. Figuring out where to keep it all is another story!&quot;

On August 7, 2016, Bow Wow officially announced that he was retiring from rapping and would release one more album, titled &quot;NYLTH&quot;, which was initially tentatively scheduled for release in 2017. In 2021, he announced that his final album would be titled &quot;Before 30&quot;, and would be released by Death Row Records. He teased the album again in March 2024.

Prior to his final album release, Bow Wow and Soulja Boy released a joint retail mixtape titled &quot;Ignorant Shit&quot; on October 25, 2016.

In 2020, Bow Wow competed in the third season of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Frog&quot; and finished in third place. He agreed to appear on the show because he felt it would be a good rehearsal before headlining The Millennium Tour. He headlined the tour in 2020, 2021 and 2022.

On October 2, 2012, Bow Wow claimed he was broke and only making $4,000 a month and only had $1,500 in his checking account. However, the next day he signed on to be one of the four new co-hosts of BET&#x27;s &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot;. Later on he would address this by saying:

One thing about me, I&#x27;m a smart guy. Very smart. Things that I do, are for reasons. Things that I don&#x27;t do are for reasons. So for myself, I&#x27;m comfortable, very comfortable. For me, it&#x27;s all about the work. But as far as rumors, those are people&#x27;s opinions -- until you see me on a corner with a cardboard box saying I&#x27;ll tap dance for food or canned goods, then you can say that [I&#x27;m broke].

On February 2, 2019, Bow Wow was arrested in Atlanta, Georgia, for battery after a fight with a woman. At the time of arrest, both suffered minor injuries and it was unclear who the aggressor was, so both parties were charged.

In 2016, Bow Wow was involved in a controversy on Twitter when he told his followers that he had decided not to vote in the presidential election that year. In response to a suggestion that refusing to vote dishonors the struggle for civil rights in the United States, Moss said that he did not identify with the fight for civil rights because his heritage was &quot;mixed&quot; and not exclusively black.

On March 15, 2017, Bow Wow, responding to President Donald Trump&#x27;s criticism of Snoop Dogg&#x27;s music video for &quot;Lavender (Nightfall Remix)&quot;, sent a tweet to Trump in which he threatened to &quot;pimp your wife and make her work for us&quot;. In less than 24 hours, Bow Wow deleted the offending tweet.

=== Bow Wow challenge ===
In 2017, a new photo challenge went viral over social media, called &quot;Bow Wow Challenge&quot;.

<text>Adhocracy is a flexible, adaptable, and informal form of organization defined by a lack of formal structure and employs specialized multidisciplinary teams grouped by function. It operates in a fashion opposite to bureaucracy. Warren Bennis coined the term in his 1968 book &quot;The Temporary Society.&quot; Alvin Toffler popularized the term in 1970 with his book, &quot;Future Shock&quot;, and has since become often used in the management theory of organizations (particularly online organizations). The concept has been further developed by academics such as Henry Mintzberg.

Adhocracy is the system of adaptive, creative, and flexible integrative behavior based on non-permanence and spontaneity. These characteristics are believed to allow adhocracy to respond faster than traditional bureaucratic organizations while being more open to new ideas.

== Overview ==
Robert H. Waterman, Jr. defines adhocracy as &quot;any form of organization that cuts across normal bureaucratic lines to capture opportunities, solve problems, and get results&quot;. For Henry Mintzberg, an adhocracy is a complex and dynamic organizational form. It is different from bureaucracy; like Toffler, Mintzberg considers bureaucracy a thing of the past, and adhocracy one of the future. When done well, adhocracy can be very good at problem solving and innovation and thrive in diverse environments. It requires sophisticated and often automated technical systems to develop and thrive. Academics have described Wikipedia as an adhocracy.

== Characteristics ==
Some characteristics of Mintzberg&#x27;s definition include:
* highly organic structure
* little formalization of behavior
* job specialization not necessarily based on formal training
* a tendency to group the specialists in functional units for housekeeping purposes but to deploy them in small, market-based project teams to do their work
* a reliance on liaison devices to encourage mutual adjustment within and between these teams
* low or no standardization of procedures
* roles not clearly defined
* selective decentralization
* work organization rests on specialized teams
* power-shifts to specialized teams
* horizontal job specialization
* high cost of communication
* culture based on non-bureaucratic work

All members of an organization have the authority within their areas of specialization, and in coordination with other members, to make decisions and to take actions affecting the future of the organization. There is an absence of hierarchy.

According to Robert H. Waterman, Jr., &quot;Teams should be big enough to represent all parts of the bureaucracy that will be affected by their work, yet small enough to get the job done efficiently.&quot;

== Types ==
*administrative – &quot;feature an autonomous operating core; usually in an institutionalized bureaucracy like a government department or standing agency&quot; 
*operational – solves problems on behalf of its clients
Alvin Toffler claimed in his book &quot;Future Shock&quot; that adhocracies will get more common and are likely to replace bureaucracy. He also wrote that they will most often come in form of a temporary structure, formed to resolve a given problem and dissolved afterwards.
An example are cross-department task forces.

== Issues ==
Downsides of adhocracies can include &quot;half-baked actions&quot;, personnel problems stemming from organization&#x27;s temporary nature, extremism in suggested or undertaken actions, and threats to democracy and legality rising from adhocracy&#x27;s often low-key profile. To address those problems, researchers in adhocracy suggest a model merging adhocracy and bureaucracy, the bureau-adhocracy.

== Etymology ==
The word is a portmanteau of the Latin &quot;ad hoc&quot;, meaning &quot;for the purpose&quot;, and the suffix -cracy, from the ancient Greek &quot;kratein&quot; (κρατεῖν), meaning &quot;to govern&quot;, and is thus a heteroclite.

== Use in fiction ==
The term is also used to describe the form of government used in the science fiction novels &quot;Voyage from Yesteryear&quot; by James P. Hogan and &quot;Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom&quot;, by Cory Doctorow.

In the radio play &quot;Das Unternehmen Der Wega&quot; (The Mission of the Vega) by Friedrich Dürrenmatt, the human inhabitants of Venus, all banished there from various regions of Earth for civil and political offenses, form and live under a peaceful adhocracy, to the frustration of delegates from an Earth faction who hope to gain their cooperation in a war brewing on Earth.

In the Metrozone series of novels by Simon Morden, The novel &quot;The Curve of the Earth&quot; features &quot;ad-hoc&quot; meetings conducted virtually, by which all decisions governing the Freezone collective are taken. The ad-hocs are administered by an artificial intelligence and polled from suitably qualified individuals who are judged by the AI to have sufficient experience. Failure to arrive at a decision results in the polling of a new ad-hoc, whose members are not told of previous ad-hocs before hearing the decision which must be made.

The asura in the fictional world of Tyria within the Guild Wars universe present this form of government, although the term is only used in out-of-game lore writings.

<doc id="159858" wikidata="Q823244" url="?curid=159858" title="Decapolis">
<text>The Decapolis (Greek: ) was a group of ten Hellenistic cities on the eastern frontier of the Roman Empire in the Southern Levant in the first centuries BC and AD. Most of the cities were located to the east of the Jordan Rift Valley, between Judaea, Iturea, Nabataea, and Syria.

The Decapolis was a center of Hellenistic and Roman culture in a region which was otherwise populated by Jews, Arab Nabataeans and Arameans. The cities formed a group because of their language, culture, religion, location, and political status, with each functioning as an autonomous city-state dependent on Rome. They are sometimes described as a league of cities, although some scholars believe that they were never formally organized as a political unit.

In the time of the Emperor Trajan, the cities were incorporated into the provinces of Syria and Arabia Petraea; several cities were later placed in Syria Palaestina and Palaestina Secunda. The Decapolis region is located in modern-day Jordan (Philadelphia, Gerasa, Pella and Gadara), Israel (Scythopolis and Hippos) and Syria (Raphana, Dion, Canatha and Damascus).

==Cities==
The names of the traditional ten cities of the Decapolis come from Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;. They are:

Damascus was further north than the others and so is sometimes thought to have been an &quot;honorary&quot; member. Josephus states that Scythopolis was the largest of the ten towns. Biblical commentator Edward Plumptre suggests that this is the reason why Damascus was not included in Josephus&#x27; list. According to other sources, there may have been as many as 18 or 19 Greco-Roman cities counted as part of the Decapolis.

==History==
===Hellenistic period===

Except for Scythopolis, Damascus and Canatha, the Decapolis cities were by and large founded during the Hellenistic period, between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the Roman conquest of Coele-Syria, including Judea in 63 BC. Some were established under the Ptolemaic dynasty which ruled Judea until 198 BC. Others were founded later, when the Seleucid Empire ruled the region. Some of the cities included &quot;Antiochia&quot; or &quot;Seleucia&quot; in their official names (&quot;Antiochia Hippos&quot;, for example), which attest to Seleucid origins. The cities were Greek from their founding, modeling themselves on the Greek polis.

In 63 BC, the Roman general Pompey conquered the eastern Mediterranean. The people of the Hellenized cities, who were under the rule of the Jewish Hasmonean Kingdom, welcomed Pompey as a liberator. When Pompey reorganized the region, he awarded a group of these cities with autonomy under Roman protection; this was the origin of the Decapolis. For centuries the cities based their calendar era on this conquest: 63 BC was the epochal year of the Pompeian era, used to count the years throughout the Roman and Byzantine periods.

===Autonomy under Rome===
Under Roman rule, the cities of the Decapolis were not included in the territory of the Herodian kingdom, its successor states of the Herodian tetrarchy, or the Roman province of Judea. Instead, the cities were allowed considerable political autonomy under Roman protection. Each city functioned as a polis or city-state, with jurisdiction over an area of the surrounding countryside. Each minted its own coins. Many coins from Decapolis cities identify their city as &quot;autonomous,&quot; &quot;free,&quot; &quot;sovereign,&quot; or &quot;sacred&quot;—terms that imply some sort of self-governing status.
The Romans left their cultural stamp on all of the cities. Each one was eventually rebuilt with a Roman-style grid of streets based around a central cardo and/or decumanus. The Romans sponsored and built numerous temples and other public buildings. The imperial cult, the worship of the Roman emperor, was a very common practice throughout the Decapolis and was one of the features that linked the cities. A small open-air temple or façade, called a kalybe, was unique to the region.

The cities may also have enjoyed strong commercial ties, fostered by a network of new Roman roads. This has led to their common identification today as a &quot;federation&quot; or &quot;league&quot;. The Decapolis was probably never an official political or economic union; most likely it signified the collection of city-states which enjoyed special autonomy during early Roman rule.

The New Testament gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke mention that the Decapolis region was a location of the ministry of Jesus. According to the Decapolis was one of the areas from which Jesus drew his multitude of disciples, attracted by His &quot;healing all kinds of sickness&quot;. The Decapolis was one of the few regions where Jesus travelled in which Gentiles were in the majority: most of Jesus&#x27; ministry focused on teaching to Jews. Mark 5:1-10 emphasizes the Decapolis&#x27; gentile character when Jesus encounters a herd of pigs, an animal forbidden by Kashrut, the Jewish dietary laws. A demon-possessed man healed by Jesus in this passage asks to be included among the disciples who traveled with Jesus; but Jesus does not permit him, as he wanted him to tell his friends what the Lord had done and instructs him to remain in the Decapolis region.

===Direct Roman rule===

The Decapolis came under direct Roman rule in AD 106, when Arabia Petraea was annexed during the reign of the emperor Trajan. The cities were divided between the new province and the provinces of Syria and Judea. In the later Roman Empire, they were divided between Arabia and Palaestina Secunda, of which Scythopolis served as the provincial capital; while Damascus became part of Phoenice Libanensis. The cities continued to be distinct from their neighbors within their provinces, distinguished for example by their use of the Pompeian calendar era and their continuing Hellenistic identities. However, the Decapolis was no longer a unit of administration.

The Roman and Byzantine Decapolis region was influenced and gradually taken over by Christianity. Some cities were more receptive than others to the new religion. Pella was a base for some of the earliest church leaders (Eusebius reports that the apostles fled there to escape the First Jewish–Roman War). In other cities, paganism persisted long into the Byzantine era. Eventually, however, the region became almost entirely Christian, and most of the cities served as seats of bishops.

Most of the cities continued into the late Roman and Byzantine periods. Some were abandoned in the years following Palestine&#x27;s conquest by the Rashidun Caliphate in 641, but other cities continued to be inhabited long into the Islamic period.

==Evolution and excavation==
Jerash (Gerasa) and Bet She&#x27;an (Scythopolis) survive as towns today, after periods of abandonment or serious decline. Damascus has never lost its prominent role throughout later history. Philadelphia was long abandoned but was revived in the 19th century and has become the capital city of Jordan under the name Amman. Twentieth-century archaeology has identified most of the other cities on Pliny&#x27;s list, and most have undergone or are undergoing considerable excavation.

== Culture ==
The Decapolis was a region where two cultures interacted: the culture of the Greek colonists and the indigenous Jewish and Aramean cultures. There was some conflict. The Greek inhabitants were shocked by the Jewish practice of circumcision, which was regarded as a cruel and barbaric genital mutilation. Various elements of Jewish dissent towards the dominant and assimilative nature of Hellenic civilization arose gradually in the face of assimilation. At the same time, cultural blending and borrowing also occurred in the Decapolis region. 

The cities acted as centers for the diffusion of Hellenistic culture. Some local deities began to be called by the name Zeus, from the chief Greek god. Meanwhile, in some cities Greeks began worshipping these local &quot;Zeus&quot; deities alongside their own Zeus Olympios. There is evidence that the colonists adopted the worship of other Semitic gods, including Phoenician deities and the chief Nabatean god, Dushara (worshipped under his Hellenized name, &quot;Dusares&quot;). The worship of these Semitic gods is attested in coins and inscriptions from the cities.

<doc id="159859" wikidata="Q216478" url="?curid=159859" title="Italo Svevo">
<text>Aron Hector Schmitz (19 December 186113 September 1928), better known by the pseudonym Italo Svevo (), was an Italian and Austro-Hungarian writer, businessman, novelist, playwright, and short story writer.

A close friend of Irish novelist and poet James Joyce, Svevo was considered a pioneer of the psychological novel in Italy and is best known for his modernist novel &quot;La coscienza di Zeno&quot; (1923), which became a widely appreciated classic of Italian literature. He was also the cousin of the Italian academic Steno Tedeschi.

== Early life ==
Born in Trieste (at the time in the Austrian Empire, then in Austria-Hungary since 1867) as Aron Ettore Schmitz to a Jewish German father and an Italian mother, Svevo was one of seven children, and grew up enjoying a passion for literature from a young age, reading works of Goethe, Schiller, Shakespeare, and the classics of French and Russian literature.

Svevo was a citizen of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the end of the First World War. He spoke Italian as a second language, as he usually spoke the Triestine dialect. Due to his Germanophone ancestry by his father, he and his brothers were sent to a boarding school near Würzburg, in the German Empire, where he learnt and became fluent in German.

After returning to Trieste in 1880, Svevo continued his studies for a further two years at Istituto Revoltella, before being forced to take financial responsibility when his father filed for bankruptcy, after his once successful glassware business failed. This 20-year period as a bank clerk at the Unionbank of Vienna served as inspiration for his first novel, &quot;Una Vita&quot; (1892).

During his time at the bank, Svevo contributed to Italian-language socialist publication &quot;L&#x27;Indipendente&quot; (it), and began writing plays (which he rarely finished) before beginning work on &quot;Una vita&quot; in 1887. Svevo adhered to a humanistic and democratic socialism, which predisposed him to pacifism, and to advocate for the creation of a European economic union after the war.

Following the death of his parents, Svevo married his cousin Livia Veneziani in a civil ceremony in 1896. Soon after, Livia convinced him to convert to Catholicism and take part in a religious wedding (probably after a troublesome pregnancy). Personally, however, Svevo was an atheist. He became a partner in his wealthy father-in-law&#x27;s paint business - that specialized in manufacturing industrial paint, that was used on naval warships. He became successful in growing the business, and after trips to France and Germany set up a branch of the company in England.

Svevo lived for part of his life in Charlton, south-east London, while working for a family firm. He documented this period in his letters to his wife, which highlighted the cultural differences he encountered in Edwardian England. His old home at 67 Charlton Church Lane now carries a blue plaque.

== Writing career ==
Svevo first started writing short stories in 1880. He took on the pseudonym &quot;Italo Svevo&quot; (literally &quot;Italus the Swabian&quot;) for the publication of his first novel, &quot;Una Vita&quot;, in 1892. The novel was not a success.

His second novel, &quot;Senilità&quot; (1898), was also received poorly. In 1919 he began work on &quot;La Coscienza di Zeno&quot; (known in English as &quot;Zeno&#x27;s Conscience&quot; or &quot;Confessions of Zeno&quot;).

== &quot;Zeno&#x27;s Conscience&quot; ==
In 1923 Italo Svevo published the psychological novel &quot;La Coscienza di Zeno&quot;. The work, showing the author&#x27;s interest in the theories of Sigmund Freud, is written in the form of the memoirs of Zeno Cosini, who writes them at the insistence of his psychoanalyst. Svevo&#x27;s novel received almost no attention from Italian readers and critics at the time.

The work might have disappeared altogether if it were not for the efforts of James Joyce. Joyce had met Svevo in 1907, when Joyce tutored him in English, while working for Berlitz in Trieste. Joyce read Svevo&#x27;s earlier novels, &quot;Una Vita&quot; and &quot;Senilità&quot;.

Joyce championed &quot;Zeno&#x27;s Conscience&quot;, helping to have it translated into French and then published in Paris, where critics praised it extravagantly. That led Italian critics, including Eugenio Montale, to discover it. Zeno Cosini, the book&#x27;s hero and unreliable narrator, mirrored Svevo himself, being a businessman fascinated by Freudian theory. Svevo was also a model for Leopold Bloom, the protagonist of Joyce&#x27;s seminal novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

&quot;Zeno&#x27;s Conscience&quot; never looks outside the narrow confines of Trieste, much like Joyce&#x27;s work, which rarely left Dublin in the last years of Ireland&#x27;s time as part of the United Kingdom. Svevo employed often sardonic wit in his observations of Trieste and, in particular, of his hero, an indifferent man, who cheats on his wife, lies to his psychoanalyst, and is trying to explain himself to his psychoanalyst, by revisiting his memories.

There is a final connection between Svevo and the character Cosini. Cosini sought psychoanalysis, he said, in order to discover why he was addicted to nicotine. As Svevo reveals in his memoirs, each time he had given up smoking, with the iron resolve that this would be the &quot;ultima sigaretta!!&quot;, he experienced the exhilarating feeling that he was now beginning life over without the burden of his old habits and mistakes. That feeling was, however, so strong that he found smoking irresistible, if only so that he could stop smoking again, in order to experience that thrill once more.

== Death ==
After being involved in a serious car crash, he was brought into hospital in Motta di Livenza, where his health rapidly failed. As death approached, he asked one of his visitors for a cigarette. It was refused. Svevo replied: &quot;That would have been my last&quot;. He died that afternoon.

== Legacy ==
Svevo, along with Luigi Pirandello, is considered a prominent figure of early 20th-century Italian literature, and has had an important influence on later generations of the country&#x27;s writers.

Though only recognised for his literary achievements towards the end of his life, Svevo is celebrated as one of Italy&#x27;s finest writers, particularly in his home city of Trieste, and has a statue in front of the Museum of Natural History erected in his honour.

<text>Lorraine Fair Allen (born Lorraine Ming Fair; August 5, 1978) is a retired American professional soccer midfielder who was a member of the World Cup Champion United States women&#x27;s national soccer team in 1999. Over the span of ten years, she was a part of one World Cup Team and three Olympic teams, and retired from international play in 2005.

Her twin sister, Ronnie Fair, (now Ronnie Fair Sullins) was also a member of the national team. When Ronnie was called in to participate in a game against England on May 9, 1997 at San Jose, California, it became the first time a pair of sisters played together on the USWNT.

In 2023, Fair was named to the San Jose Sports Hall of Fame.

== Early career ==
Lorrie and Ronnie both participated on Los Altos High School&#x27;s female soccer team in Los Altos, California, where they grew up. They were born at Stanford Hospital, but moved to New York for three years before returning to the Bay Area in 1982. While Ronnie chose Stanford to go to college, Lorrie decided on the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill instead, but not before being a two time NSCAA all-American and Parade magazine all-American. At UNC, she was picked as one of &quot;Soccer America&quot;&#x27;s freshmen of the year, and she helped lead UNC to the NCAA championship in 1996, 1997, and 1999. She also won the Honda Sports Award as the nation&#x27;s top soccer player.

== National team career ==

She joined the United States women&#x27;s national under-20 soccer team in 1994, playing in the Nordic Cup (amongst other events). In 1995, she was a member of the West Team at the US Olympic Festival, and she was invited to train with the National team. While a senior in high school, at the age of 17, she was named an alternate for the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games team (which won gold at the tournament). Fair rejected the chance to travel as an alternate because she was upset at being cut from national coach Tony DiCicco&#x27;s main 16 player squad.

Fair had made her senior international debut against Norway in February 1996. In March 1998 she scored her first international goal against New Zealand at RFK Stadium.

After sitting out the 1996 Olympic games, she earned a more permanent spot on the team and in 1999, she was the youngest member of the team that won that year&#x27;s FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. She played every minute of the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, taking home a silver medal after an overtime loss to Norway in the championship game. In her last world event, she was an alternate on the gold medal-winning Olympic team in 2004 and then retired in 2005 with 120 international appearances.

==International goals==
== Club career ==

Fair played for the Philadelphia Charge in the WUSA (2001–2003), Olympique Lyonnais in Lyon, France (2005), and Chelsea FC in the UK (2008–2009).

Lorrie, Ronnie and their older brother, Greg all got their start and played for many years in AYSO Region 43.

She most recently played for Chelsea in the FA Women&#x27;s Premier League. On February 1, 2008, it was announced that Fair had signed for Chelsea Ladies as a player, for whom she had been working solely as an ambassador up to that point. Fair vowed to continue her work with the club at grass roots level. The move was significant as she became the first American international to sign for a club in the Women&#x27;s Premier League. Fair suffered a serious cruciate ligament injury in May 2008, which ruled her out of the following season.

<text>Vienna Airport is an international airport serving Vienna, the capital of Austria. It is located in Schwechat, southeast of central Vienna and west of Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. Its official name according to the Austrian Aeronautical Information Publication is Wien-Schwechat Airport. It is the country&#x27;s largest airport and serves as the hub for Austrian Airlines as well as a base for low-cost carriers Ryanair and Wizz Air. It is capable of handling wide-body aircraft up to the Airbus A380. The airport features a dense network of European destinations as well as long-haul flights to Asia, North America and Africa.

==History==
===Early years===
Originally built as a military airport in 1938 and used during World War II as the Heinkel firm&#x27;s southern military aircraft design and production complex, or &quot;Heinkel-Süd&quot; facility, it was taken over by the British in 1945 and became RAF Schwechat under the occupation of the country. In 1954, the &quot;Betriebsgesellschaft&quot; was founded, and the airport replaced Wien-Aspern Airport as Vienna&#x27;s (and Austria&#x27;s) principal aerodrome. There was just one runway, which in 1959 was expanded to measure . The erection of the new airport building began in 1959.

In 1972, another runway was built. In 1982, the airport was connected to the national motorway network (Ostautobahn). In 1986, the enlarged arrivals hall was opened, and in 1988 Pier East with 8 jet bridges was opened.

On 27 December 1985, the El Al ticket counter was attacked by Abu Nidal, a Palestinian terrorist organization that simultaneously conducted a terrorist attack at Fiumicino Airport in Rome.

, one of the few publicly traded airport operators in Europe, was privatised in 1992. The state of Lower Austria and the City of Vienna each hold 20% of the shares, the private employee participation foundation holds 10%, with the remaining 50% held privately. The shares are part of the Austrian Traded Index.

In 1992, the new Terminal 1 was opened and a year later the shopping area around the plaza in the transit area of the B, C and D gates was opened. In 1996, Pier West with 12 jetbridges became operational.

===Development since the 2000s===
In 2006, the tall control tower started operating. It allows a free overview of the entire airport area and offers a night laser show, which aims to welcome the passengers even from the aircraft. From 2004 to 2007, an Office Park had been erected offering of rentable space. A VIP and general aviation terminal, including a separated apron, opened in 2006.

To accommodate future growth, in 1998 Vienna Airport published a master plan that outlined expansion projects until 2015. These projects included a new office park, railway station, cargo center, general aviation center, air traffic control tower, terminal, and runway. Additionally, the plan called for streamlined security control. The centerpiece of the enlargement was the new terminal, dubbed Skylink during its construction. In 2002, the airport&#x27;s management estimated that building the new terminal will cost €401.79 million. However, costs skyrocketed and in 2009 stood at an estimated €929.5 million. The Austrian Court of Audit then recommended that the airport implement several cost-savings measures, which in the Court&#x27;s estimate brought down final costs to €849.15 million, still more than double the original plans.

On 5 June 2012, the new &quot;Austrian Star Alliance Terminal&quot; (Terminal 3, named &quot;Skylink&quot; during its construction) was opened, which enables the airport to handle up to 30 million passengers per year. Construction started in 2004 and was suspended due to projected cost increases in 2009, but resumed in 2010. The maximum planned costs totaled less than €770 million. Following concerns over the mismanagement of the Skylink project, chief executive Herbert Kaufman agreed to resign at the end of December 2010. The new building with its North Pier has 17 jetbridges and makes the airport capable of handling more aircraft, although the new terminal is not able to handle Airbus A380 aircraft. However, the older Concourse D will see an upgrade to accommodate the A380.

Since the opening of Terminal 3, a few terminals and concourses underwent refurbishment. Terminal 1 and Concourses B and D were refurbished between 2012 and 2018. Between 2018 and 2022, a refurbishment of Terminal 2 took place, which has now got a new security check for the C and D concourses.

==Terminals==


The airport has four terminal buildings named &quot;Terminal 1, 2&quot; and &quot;3&quot; which are directly built against each other as well as the additional &quot;Terminal 1A&quot; located opposite Terminal 1. Terminals 1, 2 and 3 connect to the five concourses. The central arrivals hall for all terminal areas is located in Terminal 3.

===Terminals===
*Terminal 1 was built in 1990, operating as the second terminal of the airport. It underwent refurbishment in January 2013 and is now mainly used by some Oneworld and SkyTeam airlines along with Turkish Airlines, Ryanair and Wizz Air.
*Terminal 1A, located in a standalone building opposite Terminal 1, built as temporary structure in 2005. It hosted check-in facilities for a number of low-cost carriers, leisure airlines including Condor, SunExpress and Vueling along with Hainan Airlines, and has been reopened in March 2023 after being closed for nearly three years in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
*Terminal 2 was finished in 1960, when it was the only terminal of the airport. A huge extension was built in 1993, when the Plaza opened. Because of the opening of the new Terminal 3, the check-in area of Terminal 2 stopped operating in 2012. It was refurbished between 2016 and 2022 and now features new security screening areas and a revamped baggage reclaim, which is connected to the baggage reclaim of Terminal 3. The original Terminal 2 is now used as the entrance of Concourses C and D.
*Terminal 3, also referred to as the Austrian Star Alliance Terminal, with its adjoining Concourses F and G is the airport&#x27;s newest facility. It was built between 2006 and 2012. It is used by Austrian Airlines, most Star Alliance members, and a number of other carriers including Emirates, El Al, Korean Air, Royal Jordanian and Qatar Airways. A planned expansion has been postponed indefinitely.

===Concourses===
*Concourse B is in the basement of Concourse C and features Gates B31–B42 (boarding by buses) for Schengen destinations. Since 2021 it was temporarily used to handle non-Schengen bus arrivals. In 2022 it has been refurbished to assume that role permanently.
*Concourse C (pier west) was finished in 1996. It is used for Schengen destinations; features Gates C21-24) (boarding via buses), C31–C42 (jetbridges) C71–C75 (boarding via buses)
*Concourse D (&quot;pier east&quot;; formerly &quot;Concourse A&quot;) opened 1988 and is used for non-Schengen destinations with shared passport control at the entrance of Pier East; features Gates D21–D29 (boarding via jetbridges), D31–D37 (boarding via buses), D61–D70 (buses). Concourse D has been closed and partially refurbished during the COVID-19 pandemic.
*Concourse F (Level 1 of &quot;pier north&quot;) was finished in 2012, when the new Terminal 3 opened. It is used for Schengen destinations and consists of Gates F01-F37 (jetbridges and buses) and Gates F71-F75 (bus gates)
*Concourse G (Level 3 and basement of &quot;pier north&quot;) for non-Schengen destinations; shared passport control at the entrance of Level 3; features Gates G01-G37 (jetbridges and bus gates) and G61-67 (boarding via buses).

==Expansion projects==
===Terminal 3 expansion===
In addition to the aforementioned refurbishments of existing passenger facilities, a completely new building is under construction as of early 2024, which is supposed to connect the existing pier east and pier north. The so-called &quot;T3 Southern Enlargement&quot; will be offering of leisure area, 10,000 m² of which will be used for shops and restaurants etc. The building will also feature 18 new additional bus gates, including 9 gates for Schengen Destinations and 9 gates for Non-Schengen Destinations. The opening had originally been planned for 2023, however, the project had been delayed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2023 it was announced that the construction of the new building was then set to start in mid-2023. Construction for the new terminal annex subsequently started in February 2024 with a completion date expected for early 2027.

===Third runway===

Vienna Airport originally projected that it would need a third runway by 2012, or 2016 at the latest, in the event of cooperation with nearby Bratislava Airport. The third runway is planned to be parallel to and south of the existing runway 11/29. It will be designated 11R/29L, with the existing runway being renamed 11L/29R. The new runway is planned to be long and wide, and equipped with a category III instrument landing system in one direction (29L).

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic the airport projected that a third runway will be necessary by 2025, however, environmental organizations and some local communities oppose construction. These groups have attacked the decision of Lower Austria (the state in which the airport is located) to move ahead with the first phase of construction. A verdict from the administrative court that has taken up the lawsuit was expected later in 2015. As of September 2016, there were ongoing public protests while no legal decision had been made. On 28 March 2018, the Austrian Federal Administrative Court ruled in favour of a third runway.

<doc id="159865" wikidata="Q27479" url="?curid=159865" title="Northern Europe">
<text>The northern region of Europe has several definitions. A restrictive definition may describe northern Europe as being roughly north of the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, which is about 54°N, or may be based on other geographical factors such as climate and ecology.

==Climate==
The climate is mainly Oceanic climate (Cfb), Humid continental climate (Dfb), Subarctic climate (Dfc and Dsc) and Tundra (ET).

==Geography==

Northern Europe might be defined roughly to include some or all of the following areas: British Isles, Fennoscandia, the peninsula of Jutland, the Baltic plain that lies to the east, and the many islands that lie offshore from mainland northern Europe and the main European continent. In some cases, Greenland is also included, although it is only politically European, comprising part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and not considered to be geographically in Europe.

The area is partly mountainous, including the northern volcanic islands of Iceland and Jan Mayen, and the mountainous western seaboard, Scotland and Scandinavia, and also often includes part of the large plain east of the Baltic Sea.

The entire region&#x27;s climate is at least mildly affected by the Gulf Stream. From the west climates vary from maritime and maritime subarctic climates. In the north and central climates are generally subarctic or Arctic and to the east climates are mostly subarctic and temperate/continental.

Just as both climate and relief are variable across the region, so too is vegetation, with sparse tundra in the north and high mountains, boreal forest on the north-eastern and central regions temperate coniferous forests (formerly of which a majority was in the Scottish Highlands and south west Norway) and temperate broadleaf forests growing in the south, west and temperate east.

==Classifications==
There are various definitions of northern Europe which always include the Nordic countries, often the British Isles and Baltic states, and sometimes Greenland.

===UN geoscheme classification===
The United Nations geoscheme is a system devised by the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) which divides the countries of the world into regional and subregional groups, based on the M49 coding classification. The partition is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories.

In the UN geoscheme, the following countries are classified as being in northern Europe:
* Denmark
* Estonia
* Finland
* Iceland
* Ireland
* Latvia
* Lithuania
* Norway
* Sweden
* United Kingdom

as well as the dependent areas:
* Åland
* Channel Islands
** Bailiwick of Guernsey
** Bailiwick of Jersey
* Faroe Islands
* Isle of Man
* Svalbard and Jan Mayen

===EuroVoc===

EuroVoc is a multilingual thesaurus maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union, giving definitions of terms for official use. In the definition of &quot;northern Europe&quot;, the following countries are included:
*Estonia
*Latvia
*Lithuania
*Denmark
*Finland
*Iceland
*Norway
*Sweden
as well as the dependent area:
*Faroe Islands
In this classification Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom and Ireland are included in Western Europe.

===&quot;CIA World Factbook&quot;===
In the &quot;CIA World Factbook&quot;, the description of each country includes information about &quot;Location&quot; under the heading &quot;Geography&quot;, where the country is classified into a region. The following countries are included in their classification &quot;northern Europe&quot;:
*Denmark
*Finland
*Iceland
*Norway
*Sweden
as well as the dependent areas:
*Faroe Islands 
*Jan Mayen
*Svalbard
In this classification Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom and Ireland are included in Western Europe, while Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are included in Eastern Europe.

===World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions===

The World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions is a biogeographical system developed by the international Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) organization, formerly the International Working Group on Taxonomic Databases. The WGSRPD standards, like other standards for data fields in botanical databases, were developed to promote &quot;the wider and more effective dissemination of information about the world&#x27;s heritage of biological organisms for the benefit of the world at large&quot;. The system provides clear definitions and codes for recording plant distributions at four scales or levels, from &quot;botanical continents&quot; down to parts of large countries. The following countries are included in their classification of &quot;northern Europe&quot;:
*Denmark
*Finland
*Iceland
*Ireland
*Norway
*Sweden
*United Kingdom
as well as the dependent areas:
*Åland
*Faroe Islands
*Isle of Man
*Jan Mayen
*Svalbard

==Demographics==

Countries in northern Europe generally have developed economies and some of the highest standards of living in the world. They often score highly on surveys measuring quality of life, such as the Human Development Index. Aside from the United Kingdom, they generally have a small population relative to their size, most of whom live in cities. The quality of education in much of Northern Europe is rated highly in international rankings, with Estonia and Finland topping the list among the OECD countries in Europe.

===Language===
Germanic languages are widely spoken in northern Europe with North Germanic languages being the most common first language in the Faroe Islands (Faroese), Iceland (Icelandic), Denmark (Danish), Norway (Norwegian) and Sweden (Swedish). The West Germanic language English is the most common first language in Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom and Ireland, however, the West Germanic language Scots is also spoken as a minority language in parts of Scotland and Ireland. Beyond this, the Finnic languages of Finnish and Estonian are the most common first languages of Finland and Estonia respectively. The Baltic languages of Lithuanian and Latvian are the most common first languages of Lithuania and Latvia respectively. A number of Celtic languages are spoken in the British Isles including the Brythonic Welsh and the Goidelic Scots Gaelic and Irish. The Celtic languages Cornish and Manx have been revived since becoming classed as extinct, being now spoken to a limited extent in Cornwall and the Isle of Man respectively. The Norman languages of Jèrriais and Guernésiais are spoken in Jersey and Guernsey, though are listed as endangered due to the increasing prominence of English in the islands.

While not the most common first languages in any country, Sámi languages such as North Sámi, Lule Sámi and South Sámi are spoken in the transnational region of Sápmi and are listed as endangered.

===Religion===

During the Early Middle Ages, the Roman Catholic Church expanded into northern Europe and spread Christianity among the Germanic peoples. Christianity reached the peoples of Scandinavia and the Baltic region in later centuries. The Latin alphabet along with the influence of Western Christianity spread northward from Rome, leading to written English, German, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Icelandic, Latvian, Lithuanian, Estonian, Finnish and Sámi languages. The Sámi were the last peoples to be converted in the 18th century.

==Regional cooperation==

The Hansa group in the European Union comprises most of the northern European states, plus the Netherlands.

The melting of the Arctic is likely to create new possibilities and issues involving collaboration in the region.

<text>Fotballklubben Bodø/Glimt (), also referred to as Bodø/Glimt or its former name Glimt, is a Norwegian professional football club from the town of Bodø in Bodø Municipality, Nordland county, Norway. The club currently plays in Eliteserien, the Norwegian top division. The club was founded in 1916.

Bodø/Glimt are four-time champions in Norway after winning the 2020, 2021, 2023 and 2024 Eliteserien seasons. They also have won the now defunct Northern Norwegian Cup nine times, and the Norwegian Cup twice. They were the first team from northern Norway to win a national title by winning the cup in 1975, the first team from the region to win the national league and also the northernmost European club to win a national league competition.

Glimt is known for its yellow kits and the huge yellow toothbrushes that its supporters carry to the matches — a supporter symbol from the 1970s. After being promoted to the top flight ahead of the 2018 season, the club has experienced the greatest success in its history, winning the league championship four years in a row, reaching the quarterfinals of the UEFA Europa Conference League and the Play-off round of the Champions League before dropping into the Europa League in the following season.

== History ==
While other towns in Nordland county like Narvik, Mo i Rana and Mosjøen had started their football clubs earlier, the larger town of Bodø was without a major football club until the latter part of 1916. The new club was founded as Fotballklubben Glimt. One of the founders was Erling Tjærandsen, who also became the club&#x27;s first president and later an honorary club member. Tjærandsen was also a known footballer and skier. Glimt&#x27;s first match was against Bodø Highschool, because Glimt was the only football club in town.
In 1919, Glimt won their first title: County Champions of Nordland. In the 1920s, Glimt suffered from bad morale and poor finances. At one point, there were talks about merging Glimt into the Ski Club B. and O.I, but following discussions, the intentions were not carried through. The club received an infusion of new encouragement through visiting footballing stars and coaches from southern Norway such as Jørgen Juve in 1929. In the 1930s, Glimt also began training indoors to reduce the impact of the severe arctic winters.

This new approach in the late 1920s and early 1930s yielded some positive results and Glimt have since been a top club in Northern Norway, winning nine North-Norwegian championships, and nationally in Norway since the 1970s.

The club changed its name in 1948, due to an older club from Trøndelag having the same name, and has since gone by the name Fotballklubben Bodø/Glimt. The slash was originally a hyphen, but was gradually changed in the 1980s to avoid confusion as hyphens were often used to separate teams on betting coupons and in result tables in newspapers.

Teams from Northern Norway were not allowed to compete in the Norwegian cup-competition until 1963. In their first appearance in the Norwegian FA cup in 1963, Bodø/Glimt managed to get as far as the fourth round after a home win 7–1 over Nordil, and two away wins. The first beating Nidelv (from Trondheim) and then a mighty win over Rosenborg. In the fourth round, Glimt had to play another away game, this time against Frigg from Oslo. Frigg won 2–0 and Glimt was out of the Cup. However, Bodø/Glimt had proven that teams from Northern Norway could play at the same level as the southern teams.

It was not until 1972 that northern teams had the right to gain promotion to the Norwegian top division. This was due to the old belief that the teams from Nordland, Troms, and Finnmark could not compete at the same level as the southern teams. Bodø/Glimt is one of three teams from Northern Norway that have played in the Norwegian top division, the others being Tromsø and Mjølner.

From 1973, Norway had three second divisions: two divisions for southern teams and one for northern teams. Bodø/Glimt took three years to gain promotion, due to the promotion rules. The first place holders in the two southern divisions gained instant promotion, but the first place holder in the northern second division had to compete in play-off matches against the two second-place holders from the south. This league system caused a lot of bitterness in the north. This worsened in 1975 when Bodø/Glimt, as the first club from Northern-Norway, won the Norwegian Cup, but did not gain promotion due to the special play-off rules for North-Norwegian clubs.

In the 1974 and 1975 season, Bodø/Glimt won their division (they had played a few draws but no losses), but still lost in the play-offs.

In 1976, Bodø/Glimt managed at last to beat the league-system with a 4–0 win over Odd and a 1–1 draw against Lyn, making Glimt the second North-Norwegian team to gain promotion to the top division, after FK Mjølner&#x27;s promotion in 1971. Not until the late 1970s did the Norwegian Football Association change the promotion rules; the play-off matches for Northern clubs were dropped. From then on there was no difference where a club had its home-ground.

After a glorious top-division debut in 1977 — second place in the league and the cup, both against Lillestrøm — Bodø/Glimt played four seasons at the top level before relegation in 1980, finishing last at 12th place.

The 1980s were the darkest hours in the club history, with Bodø/Glimt playing in the 2nd division and the regional 3rd division. For a couple of years in the mid-1980s, they weren&#x27;t even the best team in Bodø, with rivals Grand Bodø surpassing them in the standings. But the tide turned in 1991. With coach Jan Muri in charge, Glimt was promoted to 1st division. The following season they hired Trond Sollied as coach, and the team won the 1st division in the 1992 season. At last, in 1993, Bodø/Glimt was back in the top-division, and as in the debut season of 1977 they took second place in the league. This time they also managed to win the cup final (a 2–0 win over Strømsgodset). The Cup-Championship was the crowning of three remarkable seasons, going from 2nd division to 2nd place in the top-division in only three years — an achievement rarely seen in the Norwegian league system.

Since reentering the top division Bodø/Glimt have had a rather checkered performance-chart. A good league performance one season has usually been followed with near relegation the next. This was illustrated with the 1993 and 1994 seasons when Glimt won the cup and became league runners-up, in 1994 only a better goal-difference allowed Bodø/Glimt to stay in the top division.

Another example of the rollercoaster ride of Bodø/Glimt league performance is the 2003 and 2004 seasons. In 2003 season the club finished runner-up behind league valedictorians Rosenborg. The team also lost the 2003 Norwegian Cup final to Rosenborg. In the 2004 season Glimt finished third last and had to play a two-game qualification match against Kongsvinger to avoid relegation. Glimt lost the first game 0–1 in Kongsvinger, but soundly defeated Kongsvinger in Bodø by the score of 4–0, winning 4–1 on aggregate.

After the club&#x27;s comeback in 1993, Glimt played continuously in the Norwegian top division for 12 seasons, for a total of 16 top division seasons. In the 2005 season however, Bodø/Glimt was relegated.

Life in the Adecco League proved harder than most fans had anticipated. Many were disappointed when Glimt failed to secure the third place play-off spot they had held during most of the course of the season, finally ending in fifth place. The season was tainted by financial difficulties, forcing the team to sell their top scorer Håvard Sakariassen and captain Cato Andrè Hansen to promotion rivals Bryne in the middle of the season. This had to be done to stabilize their financial situation, which was so poor that the Norwegian Football Association threatened to not give the team their playing license for next season, which would have resulted disastrously in forced relegation to the second division.

The poor results towards the end of the season finally prompted the board of the supporters’ club to write an open letter in which the training and alcohol consumption habits of certain unnamed players were criticised. In a bizarre twist a few weeks later, the supporters’ club was threatened with a lawsuit in the multi-million class by former coach Trond Sollied, who was briefly mentioned in a by-sentence of the letter as having been in charge when the bad habits of the team had begun. All claims were quickly retracted by the supporters’ club.

In the second season in Adeccoligaen, Bodø/Glimt achieved promotion back to Tippeligaen after two promotion matches – once again, as in 1976 – against Odd. Bodø/Glimt was the first team for nine years in Norway to win the promotion matches to Tippeligaen. This was also the final match for Bodø/Glimt for the Norwegian legends Erik Hoftun and Kent Bergersen. The return to Tippeligaen was a successful one as the team performed well to end in 4th place in 2008, but the next season followed the club trend of struggling after a good season, and Bodø/Glimt was again relegated with a 15th place, second to last in the league.

In 2013, Bodø/Glimt was again promoted to Tippeligaen, after becoming the winner of Adecco-ligaen. Coach Jan Halvor Halvorsen managed to keep Glimt in the top lead for the next two seasons.

Ahead of the 2016 season, club legend Aasmund Bjørkan was appointed as head coach. The team started the season well, and was on top of the league table after three games. However, Glimt lost the next six games. The place in the top league nevertheless looked secure with four games remaining, but Glimt lost all of them and was relegated. Despite relegation, Aasmund Bjørkan stayed on as head coach, and the club brought in then unknown Kjetil Knutsen as assistant coach. Bodø/Glimt won the league by a 16-point margin, and was once again back at the top flight. Aasmund Bjørkan was named coach of the year, but stepped down as head coach, and took the role as sporting director at the club ahead of the 2018 season. Assistant Kjetil Knutsen was promoted to head coach. Glimt made a decent performance during 2018, however a record of 14 draws saw them finishing only in 11th place, but retaining their status as a top-flight team.

Ahead of the 2019 season, Glimt was mentioned among the relegation candidates by most pundits, especially since the club had sold key players like captain Martin Bjørnbak and top scorer Kristian Fardal Opseth. Glimt surprised everyone, and clinched a 2nd place in the Norwegian Eliteserien. Kjetil Knutsen was named coach of the year, and Håkon Evjen was named both player of the year and young player of the year. Ahead of the 2020 season, Glimt again sold several key players, among them captain Ricardo Friedrich and Håkon Evjen, and was not considered among the title candidates. However, Glimt performed a record breaking season, winning 26 games and scoring 103 goals in 30 matches. Bodø/Glimt won the Eliteserien for the first time in history, also becoming the first team from Northern Norway to win the Eliteserien. Again Kjetil Knutsen was named coach of the year. Philip Zinckernagel was named player of the year, having contributed 19 goals and 18 assists. Ahead of the 2021 season, Bodø/Glimt had sold their three front men Philip Zinckernagel, Jens Petter Hauge and Kasper Junker. These three players scored all together 60 goals and provided 35 assists in the 2020 season, and Glimt had not brought in clear replacements for these players. Pundits were again skeptical to Glimts title chances, but again Glimt surprised everyone, and were crowned back-to-back league champions after a 3–0 victory at Mjøndalen in the last match of the season.

As a result of the 2019 league finish, Glimt qualified for the UEFA Europa League. Following two wins against Lithuanian teams, Glimt faced AC Milan at San Siro in the third qualifying round, narrowly losing 2-3. In the 2021-22 European season, the results drastically improved. After losing the first Champions league qualifying round tie against Legia Warszawa, Glimt qualified for the Europa Conference League group stage (in the process defeating Zalgiris from Vilnius for the second time in two years).

Having been drawn into group C, Glimt first defeated Zorya Luhansk, and then drew CSKA Sofia 0-0 away. Glimt then defeated group-winner favourite A.S. Roma 6-1 at home at Aspmyra. This was Roma&#x27;s biggest defeat in European competitions since losing 1-6 to Barcelona in the 2015-16 Champions league group stage, and their biggest loss in any non-Champions League tournament. The away game two weeks later at Stadio Olimpico finished 2-2. After winning their home game against CSKA Sofia and drawing their away game against Zorya, Glimt finished in second place in the group stage without a single loss (and one point behind Roma). In the subsequent knockout phase, Glimt first defeated Celtic F.C. both home and away in the play-offs, and then AZ on aggregate in the round of 16. The aggregate win against AZ was sealed by an extra time goal from Alfons Sampsted away at Alkmaar. Glimt then proceeded to draw Roma as their opponent once again for the quarter-finals. The first quarter-final at Aspmyra again resulted in a Glimt win, this time 2-1. Notably, of the eleven starting players from the group stage win, only four were present in the starting line-up for the home quarter-final.

===Domestic history===

1971 was the first year northern Norwegian teams could win promotion for the top division (First possible year in the top division would have been 1972). Until 1978, the winner of the northern Norwegian group of the second tier had to enter promotion playoffs against the second placed teams of the two southern Norwegian second tier groups. 1979 was thus the first year northern Norwegian teams competed on equal terms as the southern Norwegian teams.
1 Third tier was renamed as 2. divisjon (Top tier renamed as Tippeligaen, 2nd tier renamed as 1. divisjon) ahead of 1991 season.

=== Europe ===

Bodø/Glimt have participated in European Cups a number of times. The first time was in 1976, when they lost against Napoli in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. In 1978, they lost to Inter Milan, and in 1994 to Sampdoria in the same competition.

In 2004, they lost to Beşiktaş in the first round of the UEFA Cup and in 2020 to A.C. Milan in the first qualifying round of the UEFA Europa League. Due to a shortened season during the COVID-19 pandemic, the double against Milan was played as a single match at San Siro, with no return leg. Glimt was narrowly defeated then by a score of 3–2.

In 2021, they made their debut UEFA Champions League appearance, facing Legia Warsaw from Poland&#x27;s Ekstraklasa in the first qualifying round. After being eliminated then, following the 2–5 defeat in the aggregate, the club managed to make their debut in the group stage of UEFA Europa Conference League, where they recorded surprisingly positive results, winning over A.S. Roma 8–3 on aggregate and reaching past this stage to eventually defeat Celtic F.C. and gain a place in the Round of 16 in 2022. The club managed to reach the quarter-finals of UEFA Europa Conference League then, eventually losing to future champions AS Roma, while initially managing to win over them in the first match of the double.

In 2023, the Norway side qualified to play KKS Lech Poznań in the UEFA Europa Conference League knockout round play-offs. Following their first leg 0-0 draw, they got eliminated after the Mikael Ishak’s second-half goal for the Polish KKS.

== Kit ==
The club is known to play in yellow kits. However, it wasn&#x27;t until the mid 70s that FK Bodø/Glimt changed their white shorts to an all yellow strip. In 1980, the club signed its first kit-manufacturer deal with the German firm Adidas, though the club used training jackets and shorts from Adidas since 1976. Nordlandsbanken, a major bank in the region, was one of the main sponsor of the club, present on their shirts until 2011.

Since the 2007 season, Diadora has been manufacturing the kits, giving the club a clean, minimalistic design. In October 2023, FK Bodø/Glimt signed a new manufacter deal with Puma.




=== Sponsorship ===
== Supporters ==
Glimt supporters are known as &quot;1916&quot;, &quot;Den Gule Horde&quot; (The Yellow Horde), &quot;Glimt i Sør&quot; (Glimt in the South) and &quot;Glimt i Steigen&quot; (Glimt in Steigen). 1916 and Den Gule Horde have merged to form the new supporter group &quot;J-feltet&quot;, named from the area of the stadion where the singing supporters are located. Glimt i Sør is a supporter group based in Oslo, the capital of Norway, and has members from across southern Norway. There is also a smaller group called &quot;Glimt i Midten&quot; (Glimt in the Middle) located in and around Trondheim. The Steigen branch is a small group of supporters which are known for their online support, especially on Twitter.

Glimt supporters were among the first to introduce the tradition of singing supporters dressed in club colours to Norwegian stands in the 1970s. The supporters are well known across Norway for bringing a giant toothbrush to their games, a tradition that started after supporter leaders used toothbrushes to conduct the singing, as someone often had a toothbrush in their pockets from traveling to the match. A representative for Jordan, Norway&#x27;s biggest dental company, spotted this at a match and offered the supporters a sponsor deal. For many years visiting teams have received a yellow toothbrush (of normal size) from Bodø/Glimt&#x27;s team captain ahead of matches.

<text>Beaucaire (; Occitan and Provençal: &quot;Bèucaire&quot; ) is a commune in the Gard department in the Occitanie region of Southern France.

In 2020, the commune was awarded one flower by the National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom in the Competition of cities and villages in Bloom.
==Geography==

Beaucaire is located on the River Rhône some 15 km south-west of Avignon and 10 km north of Arles. Across the river from Beaucaire lies Tarascon, which is in Bouches-du-Rhône department of Provence. Access to the commune is by the D999 road from Jonquières-Saint-Vincent in the west which passes through the north of the commune and the town and continues east to Tarascon. The D966L comes from Saint-Bonnet-du-Gard in the north and comes down the banks of the Rhône to the town. The D90 branches off the D986L in the commune and passes in a circle around the town then continues east across the Rhone changing to the D99B. The D15 goes south from the town to Fourques. The D38 goes south-west from the town to Bellegarde. The D28 links the &quot;Ile du Comte&quot; to the east bank of the Rhone. A railway passes through the commune coming from Tarascon in the east with a station in the commune then it continues to Nîmes in the west. Beaucaire station has rail connections to Nîmes, Avignon and Montpellier. Apart from the main town there are also the districts of Gaudon, Tour Saint-Pierre, Pauvre Menage, Malatrache, Mas du Consul, Mas Saint-Andre du Boschet, Mas de la Bastide, Mas des Lecques, Le Fer a Cheval, Saujean, Mas de Sicard, Bieudon, and Enclos d&#x27;Argent. The commune has a large urban area in the north-east with the rest of the commune farmland. There is also an extensive network of irrigation canals covering most of the farmland.

The Rhône river forms the whole eastern border of the commune as it flows south to join the sea at Port-Saint-Louis-du-Rhône. The river is also the departmental border between Gard and Bouches-du-Rhône. The Canal du Rhône à Sète passes through the commune from Saint-Gilles in the south-west and joins the Rhone in the town. Parallel to the Rhône on its eastern side is a canalised waterway called &quot;Laune de Pillet&quot; (the branch of the Rhone here called the &quot;Bras de Beaucaire&quot;). The Rhône and the waterway together create the &quot;Ile de Pillet&quot;. The river itself has not been navigable to the south since the creation of the Vallebregues barage in 1969; through traffic must navigate the &quot;Laune de Pillet&quot;. The river lock which once connected the Canal du Rhône à Sète to the Rhône has also been closed since 1969, but the lock is planned to reopen in due course. As it is the north-east arm of the Canal du Rhône à Sète is a &quot;cul-de-sac&quot;.

===Terrain===
The entire town is located in the Rhône Valley and has fairly flat terrain mainly formed by the plain of the Rhône. The north of the commune has hills, especially north of the town centre where the castle is located (80 metres high) as well as Saint-Roman (130 metres).n
==Name==

Called &quot;Ugernum&quot; by the Romans, Beaucaire derived its modern name from the medieval &quot;Belli Quadrum&quot;, which described the pine-clad rock rising abruptly from the river.

Alternatively, &#x27;Beaucaire&#x27; may be the French version of the Occitan language name &#x27;Bèucaire&#x27;:
* &quot;Beau&quot; &lt; French &quot;beau&quot; (&#x27;Beautiful&#x27;) &lt; Occitan &quot;bèl&quot;/&quot;bèu&quot; (&#x27;Beautiful&#x27;)
* &quot;Caire&quot; &lt; Occitan &quot;caire&quot; (&#x27;Cut stone or rock&#x27;) [in French &quot;pierre de taille&quot;].

Beaucaire appears as &quot;Beaucaire&quot; on the 1750 Cassini Map and the same on the 1790 version.

==History==

===Ancient time===
Founded in the 7th century BC, Beaucaire was known as a city on the famous Via Domitia, the first Roman road built in Gaul linking Italy to Spain (121 BC.). It was at this point that the Via Domitia divides in the direction of Arles, Nîmes, Remoulins, and Saint-Gilles. At that time, Beaucaire was called &quot;Ugernum&quot;. This was where, after the capture of Rome by the Vandals in 455, the Gallo-Roman nobility met to elect Avitus as the new emperor. A Roman mausoleum has been discovered on the &quot;Île du Comté&quot;.

===Middle Ages===
The Middle Ages saw a slowdown in the expansion of the city. Beaucaire did not escape the troubles during this dark period. It underwent invasions of Burgundians, Visigoths, and Saracens. It was at that time that the first ramparts were built and the castle was expanded. The city took the name &quot;Beaucaire&quot; (which means &quot;beautiful stone&quot;, probably in reference to its many buildings, to its quarries, or the fact that it had the first hills on the Rhone coming from the sea).

During the Albigensian Crusade, Raymond VII of Toulouse besieged Beaucaire in May 1216 to reclaim his father&#x27;s property. The efforts of Simon de Montfort to relieve the town were repulsed. The city fell after a three-month siege.

In the 13th century Louis IX made several trips to Beaucaire. The city was expanding and its population increasing. Despite the Hundred Years War and the Wars of Religion (14th to the 16th century), the splendour and refinement of the architecture grew along with the wealth of the Beaucairois merchants.

In 1579 Beaucaire was held by Henri I de Montmorency, the catholic governor of Languedoc, but tolerant. The captain of the city was Jean de Parabere who was soon to play his own game. Damville then provoked a riot to recover the city but even though Parabere was decapitated, the city remained in the hands of the Huguenots, thanks to reinforcements sent by François de Coligny, the son of Gaspard II de Coligny.

===Modern era===
At the end of the Hundred Years War in 1453, Charles VII of France declared that Beaucaire would become the site of the &quot;Fair of la Madeleine&quot;, a commercial fair that would enable the trade of goods from all of the Mediterranean Basin countries to all of France. By the mid-seventeenth century, the Fair was the largest commercial fair in the Mediterranean region, allegedly exceeding in a week the total volume of trade done in Marseilles in a year. It remained the dominant Mediterranean trade fair until the arrival of the railway in the mid-nineteenth century. The advent of the railway and the end of river trade as well as the removal of its tax-free status by Napoleon gradually destroyed the Fair of the Madeleine and plunged Beaucaire into anonymity. One result of these years of commercial dominance was the construction of a remarkable number of architecturally significant mansions and palaces by rich merchants of many nationalities. The fair still exists in the form of carnivals, bullfights, and various festivities. Camargue bulls are run through the streets. It always starts on 21 July and always ends on a Monday and lasts at least six days.

===French Revolution and Empire===
Beaucaire was capital of the district from 1790 to 1795. During the French Revolution the commune was temporarily called &quot;Pont-National&quot;.

===Contemporary period===
At the end of the 19th century and the early 20th century some works of great value are built such as the &quot;banquette&quot; - a stone retaining wall along the eastern side of the city which protected it from the flooding of the Rhône, food markets, and the Municipal Casino which is now the Festival Hall. It was also at this time that the Canal du Rhône à Sète was widened. It connects Beaucaire to the Canal du Midi.

In 1940 Beaucaire had a large population of Belgian refugees, mostly from Farciennes. They became twin communes in 1969. In 2016, they gained international attention for naming a street &quot;Rue du Brexit&quot; as a tribute to the United Kingdom voting to leave the European Union.

===Croix Couverte de Beaucaire===


The &quot;Croix Couverte de Beaucaire&quot;, or the Covered Cross, is a 14th-century stone oratory located in Beaucaire at what is now the intersection of the &quot;Route to Fourques&quot; and the &quot;Chemin de Beauvoir.&quot; The monument has three faces rising off a triangular base, each with a large Gothic arched opening and an open stone balustrade at the top.

The vaulted space holds the support for a stone cross, the oratory&#x27;s original cross is now located in the Auguste Jacquet Museum at the Château de Beaucaire. Classified as a historical monument since October 10, 1906, the structure was likely built by John, Duke of Berry, Governor of Languedoc.

===Legend===
Beaucaire has a legend of the formidable &quot;drac&quot;, a monster that rises from the depths of the sea to seize and devour its prey. One day the monster grabbed a young laundress and brought her to his cave. The story says the woman expected the worst, but the &quot;drac&quot; explained that what he wanted was a nanny for his son, the &quot;draconnet&quot;. Thus the washerwoman fed the little monster for seven years before she was set free. But one day at the fair the &quot;drac&quot; came to the market, having taken on a human appearance. The washerwoman recognized her former captor and incited the crowd to riot. Furious at being unmasked, the &quot;drac&quot; blinded the washerwoman. According to Gervase of Tilbury who wrote this tale in 1214, she remained blinded until the end of her days.

<doc id="159877" wikidata="Q726563" url="?curid=159877" title="Danger triangle of the face">
<text>The danger triangle of the face consists of the area from the corners of the mouth to the bridge of the nose, including the nose and maxilla. Due to the special nature of the blood supply to the human nose and surrounding area, it is possible for retrograde infection from the nasal area to spread to the brain, causing cavernous sinus thrombosis, meningitis, or brain abscess.

This is possible because of veinous communication (via the ophthalmic veins) between the facial vein and the cavernous sinus. The cavernous sinus lies within the cranial cavity, between layers of the meninges, and is a major conduit of venous drainage from the brain. Despite this relatively plausible anatomical argument, only severe facial infections (e.g., nasal abscess) can lead to a deeper central nervous system infection complication.

It was discovered that venous valves are present in the ophthalmic and facial veins. Thus, it is not the absence of venous valves but rather the existence of communications between the facial vein and cavernous sinus and the direction of blood flow that is important in the spread of infection from the face. Most people, but not all, have valves in these particular veins of the face.

The relationship between this area and a risk of cavernous sinus thrombosis was described as early as 1852. In 1937, a study found that 61% of the cases of cavernous sinus thrombosis were the result of boils on the upper part of the face. While the disorder has become extremely uncommon with the development of antibiotics, it still carries a very small chance to develop a high risk of death, and needs to be treated aggressively with antibiotics and blood thinners.

== Infection of cavernous sinus ==

If the cavernous sinus is infected, it can cause the blood within the sinus to clot, resulting in a cavernous sinus thrombosis. This affects the structures that are going through it or surround it. Inside the cavernous sinus, constriction of the following cranial nerves (CN) can be found: CN III (oculomotor nerve), CN IV (trochlear nerve), CN VI (abducens nerve), CN V (trigeminal nerve), specifically V1 (ophthalmic nerve) and V2 (maxillary nerve) branches. Failure of each of the nerves listed above will manifest in loss of function of the specific muscle, gland, or parasympathetic innervations (from CN III). In addition, it is possible that inflammation of the cavernous sinus will result in compression of the optic chiasm (resulting in vision problems) and/or the pituitary gland.

Failure of CN III will result in loss of function of the following muscles: medial rectus, superior rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique, as well as muscles that are responsible for opening the eyelid: the levator palpebrae superioris muscle and the superior tarsal muscle (Müller&#x27;s muscle). CN III damage also results in loss of parasympathetic innervation of the eye (loss of pupillary constriction and lens accommodation).

<text>The province of Carbonia-Iglesias (; ) was a province in the autonomous region of Sardinia, Italy. It included the historical area of Sulcis-Iglesiente and it was the smallest province of Sardinia. It is bordered by the provinces of Cagliari and Medio Campidano. All three provinces (Carbonia-Iglesias, Cagliari and Medio Campidano) have been suppressed by the regional decree in 2016, integrated into the newly founded province of South Sardinia. 

As of 2015, it has a population of 127,857 inhabitants over an area of , giving it a population density of 85.25 people per square kilometer. The provincial president was Salvatore Cherchi. It had two provincial capitals, Carbonia and Iglesias, with populations of 29,007 and 27,332 as of 2015, respectively.

==History==
Colonies in the province were established by the Phoenicians and Carthaginians in the 9th or 8th centuries BC. Its mining industry developed during the nineteenth century due to its barium, copper, lead, silver and zinc deposits, but this industry fell into decline after World War II. It was formed in 2001 by a Sardinian regional law and became functional in 2005.

On 6 May 2012 the regional referendums of Sardinia took place regarding the abolition of certain provinces and a variety of other matters. The suggestion of reforming or abolishing certain provinces in Sardinia was approved by the Regional Council of Sardinia on 24 May 2012. Due to this, the province of Carbonia-Iglesias was ordered to form a new administrative body or be abolished on 1 March 2013, but this expiry date for constitutional changes was extended to 1 July 2013. It has not been abolished as a regional law regarding it has not yet been created.

In April 2021, under Sardinian Regional Council&#x27;s Regional Law Nr. 7, the province was restored, now bearing the name of province of Sulcis Iglesiente (Provincia del Sulcis Iglesiente), named after the historical region where the province is located. Whilst the Italian government challenged the law, thus stalling its implementation, on March 12, 2022, the Constitutional Court ruled in favor of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia. On April 13, 2023, the regional council, at the proposal of the regional government, approved an amendment to the 2021 reform, defining the timeframe and manner of its implementation, which would see its full implementation in 2024.

<text>The Riga Autobus Factory (RAF; ) was a factory in Jelgava, Latvia, making vans and minibuses under the brand name Latvija.

==History==

=== Origins, Riga period ===
During the Soviet period, RAF and UAZ were the only producers of vans and minibuses in Soviet Union. RAF vans and minibuses were used only by state enterprises, most often as ambulances and for public transit. Private persons were not allowed to own them, the only exception being for families with at least five children.

In 1949, the factory began producing van bodies on the site of the Riga auto repair factory No.2 (commonly known as RARZ). In 1955, it was renamed the Riga Experimental Bus Factory (, ), and the products started to be abbreviated to RAF. It would become the main Soviet producer of minibuses.

RAF&#x27;s first product was the RAF-251, a 22-seat local bus, based on the GAZ-51 chassis (which RAF also built), with a wood and metal body. There was also a passenger- and freight version (&quot;Kombi&quot;), the 251T, with a payload of 14 passengers and cargo.

From 1958, the factory started to produce RAF-977 minibuses, based on GAZ-21 Volga engine (between the front seats, rather like the Dodge A100; the engine was accessible through an inside hatch), transmission, axles, and steering. It was planned to produce passenger (&quot;route taxis&quot; for airports, and for sporting teams), freight, mail, and ambulance versions of the vehicle, to replace the modified estates then in use. Drawing inspiration from the VW Type 2, it had a front-mounted water-cooled engine (based on the Volga&#x27;s, with a lower compression ratio), and seated ten. It debuted in 1957, and ten were built for display at that year&#x27;s Moscow Youth Festival, leading to a proposed name Festival. The first batch was produced in 1959, under the new RAF 977 name. It got and could reach , the majority of those being hand-built.

In 1965, RAF proposed two prototypes, with the hope of persuading &quot;Minavtoprom&quot; to finance a new factory: a conventional version, comparable to the Ford Transit (dubbed the RAF 962-I), or a forward control version, similar to the Renault Estafette (dubbed the 962-II). RAF management, in a rare move for a Soviet company, created two competing teams to individually design a new van. The conventional 962-I was selected, which seemed less likely to provide the money for an all-new facility. So RAF tried to persuade the selection committee to adopt the more radical 962-II, and did.

A one-tonne variant was based on a modernized 977D chassis. However, the factory size was not large enough to put this model into mass production, and therefore it was moved to ErAZ (Yerevan, Armenia).

=== Move to Jelgava, decline and collapse ===
Construction of a new factory in Jelgava (to build the new 962-II, now known as the RAF-2203 Latvia) was begun on 25 July 1969, and finished in February 1976. It was designed to produce 17,000 vehicles per year. The factory produced several versions of the RAF-2203, which was widely sold in the Soviet Union and exported, mainly to Socialist bloc and aligned nations.

The massive factory created profound challenges for Soviet-occupied Latvia. During its planning, local economists warned that the project was unfeasible in the long term, but were ignored by the Soviet government. Due to a lack of local manpower, workers from all around the Soviet Union were brought to Jelgava, increasing the already high levels of immigration and putting strain on local infrastructure and the ethnic relations between Latvians and the mostly Russian-speaking newcomers. The proportion of Latvians living in Jelgava shrank from 80% to less than 50% during the Soviet times. An entirely new neighbourhood of Jelgava, bearing the RAF name, was built.

In addition, even with the imported workforce, the factory suffered from a lack of qualified manpower: engineers (later on, also conscript soldiers of the Soviet Army) were made to work on the production line. Quality issues were rampant and well-known; on some days, all of the manufactured vehicles turned out to be defective. Even the large factory, in the end, turned out to be too small (with a planned yearly output of just 12,000 cars per year) to install important machinery, slowing down production. A heavy blow for the factory came during Perestroika – around 1986, the factory was stripped of the State quality mark of the USSR. In 1987, the factory organized one of the first open management contests in the USSR, with Viktor Bossert from Omsk elected as director by the factory workers. Bossert tried to improve quality, even announcing a competition with Renault&#x27;s Trafic van, but couldn&#x27;t overcome the ineffective supply chain of the Soviet planned economy and the lack of incentive and competition due to guaranteed tenders from the Gossnab. He left the factory in 1990.

By the beginning of the 1990s, the RAF-2203 was completely outdated and the factory set about designing a new model. The original plan was to build a new RAF vehicle to be called the M1 &quot;Roksana”, designed with help from the British consultancy &quot;International Automotive Developments&quot;. The model was successfully displayed at several auto salons, but never got further than a prototype. The same thing happened to the front-wheel drive 1994 RAF M2 &#x27;Stils&#x27; (“Style”) microbus.

After the collapse of the USSR, the new borders broke the supply chains and production fell drastically. An investment proposal came from the Russian GAZ company, but it was rejected by the Latvian government, which considered Russian capital a threat to Latvian independence. Although some Western and East Asian investors also showed their interest in RAF, all of them considered this investment too risky as the local economy was too small to support large production and the Russian market was virtually closed due to the volatile Russian economy and a complicated political relationship between Russia and Latvia. The large factory, largely dependent on parts and materials brought from outside Latvia, required a lot of resources for its maintenance and was described by some investors as the only valuable asset of the factory. Another blow was the popularity of the Russian GAZelle van, unveiled in 1994.

In 1997, the last batch of 13-seat RAF-22039s was released. The last automobile produced by the dying giant was the RAF-3311 — a hearse.

In 1998, RAF went bankrupt. The only part of the company that survived was RAF-Avia, a charter airline set up using the four airplanes owned by the plant. The manufacturing site, complete with machinery, is owned by JSC Balitva. They considered selling it to a western automaker, but this proved unrealistic. As of 2002, the assembly shop was still in order and all the design documents existed, so production could be started again if there should be a need. ErAZ expressed interest, but probably only for the designs.

After the bankruptcy of RAF, factory&#x27;s buildings and land were purchased by SIA Baltiva for 150 thousand lats (later known as SIA NP Jelgava Business Park). Shortly after, company&#x27;s shares were transferred to the Nordic Partners group, which was originally financed by the Icelandic businessman Gisli Reyninsson (Icelandic: Reynisson Gisli). On the estates purchased, SIA NP Jelgava Business Park developed an industrial park with a total area of 23 ha. 

=== Legacy ===
Rumors came out in 2018 of RAF being revived as &quot;Rīgas Autobusu Fabrika, RAF&quot; was registered in a Latvian company database. It is believed they will show off their first new model in 2019 and start production in 2020. It was also believed that RAF will now focus on electric powered vehicles like vans and trolleybuses.

Surviving prototypes of the plant are on display at the Riga Motor Museum, as well as production models in other institutions.

<text>The province of Ogliastra ( , ) was a former province in eastern Sardinia, Italy. Ogliastra was the most mountainous province in Sardinia. With only some 57,642 inhabitants, it was also the least populous province of Italy. The province had a population density of 31.08 inhabitants per square kilometer and the president of the province was Bruno Pilia. It corresponded roughly to the medieval Judicate of Agugliastra. The province of Ogliastra contained 23 &quot;comuni&quot; (plural; singular: &quot;comune&quot;), see the list of communes of the Province of Ogliastra.

In 2016 it was suppressed and all of its municipalities but one joined the Province of Nuoro. The municipality of Seui joined the newest Province of South Sardinia.

The province had two capitals, the towns and comuni Tortolì (the largest &quot;comune&quot;) and Lanusei. On 6 May 2012 the regional referendums of Sardinia took place regarding the abolition of certain provinces and a variety of other matters. The suggestion of reforming or abolishing certain provinces in Sardinia was approved by the Regional Council of Sardinia on 24 May 2012. Due to this, the province of Ogliastra was ordered to form a new administrative body or be abolished on 1 March 2013, but this expiry date for constitutional changes was extended to 1 July 2013. After the regional law number 15 of 28 June 2013, the province was allowed to maintain its functions, before it was eventually disbanded in 2016.

To the south it bordered the province of Cagliari and it borders the province of Nuoro in the north. Ogliastra was founded in 2001 when the number of Sardinian provinces was doubled. It contained the river Flumendosa and the lake of Basso Flumendosa, and it also contained large massif Gennargentu. Ogliastra took its name from the olive trees in the province, known as the &quot;olivastri&quot;. It was situated on the Tyrrhenian Sea.

In April 2021, under Sardinian Regional Council&#x27;s Regional Law Nr. 7, the province was restored with 22 &quot;comuni&quot;; the &quot;comune&quot; of Seulo remained a part of the province of Nuoro, whilst the comune of Seui joined the Metropolitan City of Cagliari. Whilst the Italian government challenged the law, thus stalling its implementation, on March 12, 2022, the Constitutional Court ruled in favor of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia. On April 13, 2023, the regional council, at the proposal of the regional government, approved an amendment to the 2021 reform, defining the timeframe and manner of its implementation, which would see its full implementation in 2024.

<doc id="159886" wikidata="Q217491" url="?curid=159886" title="Network Time Protocol">
<text>The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. In operation since before 1985, NTP is one of the oldest Internet protocols in current use. NTP was designed by David L. Mills of the University of Delaware.

NTP is intended to synchronize participating computers to within a few milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It uses the intersection algorithm, a modified version of Marzullo&#x27;s algorithm, to select accurate time servers and is designed to mitigate the effects of variable network latency. NTP can usually maintain time to within tens of milliseconds over the public Internet, and can achieve better than one millisecond accuracy in local area networks under ideal conditions. Asymmetric routes and network congestion can cause errors of 100 ms or more.

The protocol is usually described in terms of a client–server model, but can as easily be used in peer-to-peer relationships where both peers consider the other to be a potential time source. Implementations send and receive timestamps using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on port number 123. They can also use broadcasting or multicasting, where clients passively listen to time updates after an initial round-trip calibrating exchange. NTP supplies a warning of any impending leap second adjustment, but no information about local time zones or daylight saving time is transmitted.

The current protocol is version 4 (NTPv4), which is backward compatible with version 3.

== NTP packet header format ==

== History ==

In 1979, network time synchronization technology was used in what was possibly the first public demonstration of Internet services running over a trans-Atlantic satellite network, at the National Computer Conference in New York. The technology was later described in the 1981 Internet Engineering Note (IEN) 173 and a public protocol was developed from it that was documented in . The technology was first deployed in a local area network as part of the Hello routing protocol and implemented in the Fuzzball router, an experimental operating system used in network prototyping, where it ran for many years.

Other related network tools were available both then and now. They include the Daytime and Time protocols for recording the time of events, as well as the ICMP Timestamp messages and IP Timestamp option (). More complete synchronization systems, although lacking NTP&#x27;s data analysis and clock disciplining algorithms, include the Unix daemon &quot;timed&quot;, which uses an election algorithm to appoint a server for all the clients; and the Digital Time Synchronization Service (DTSS), which uses a hierarchy of servers similar to the NTP stratum model.

In 1985, NTP version 0 (NTPv0) was implemented in both Fuzzball and Unix, and the NTP packet header and round-trip delay and offset calculations, which have persisted into NTPv4, were documented in . Despite the relatively slow computers and networks available at the time, accuracy of better than 100 milliseconds was usually obtained on Atlantic spanning links, with accuracy of tens of milliseconds on Ethernet networks.

In 1988, a much more complete specification of the NTPv1 protocol, with associated algorithms, was published in . It drew on the experimental results and clock filter algorithm documented in and was the first version to describe the client–server and peer-to-peer modes. In 1991, the NTPv1 architecture, protocol and algorithms were brought to the attention of a wider engineering community with the publication of an article by David L. Mills in the &quot;IEEE Transactions on Communications&quot;.

In 1989, was published defining NTPv2 by means of a state machine, with pseudocode to describe its operation. It introduced a management protocol and cryptographic authentication scheme which have both survived into NTPv4, along with the bulk of the algorithm. However the design of NTPv2 was criticized for lacking formal correctness by the DTSS community, and the clock selection procedure was modified to incorporate Marzullo&#x27;s algorithm for NTPv3 onwards.

In 1992, defined NTPv3. The RFC included an analysis of all sources of error, from the reference clock down to the final client, which enabled the calculation of a metric that helps choose the best server where several candidates appear to disagree. Broadcast mode was introduced.

In subsequent years, as new features were added and algorithm improvements were made, it became apparent that a new protocol version was required. In 2010, was published containing a proposed specification for NTPv4. Following the retirement of Mills from the University of Delaware, the reference implementation is currently maintained as an open source project led by Harlan Stenn. On the IANA side, a ntp (network time &quot;protocols&quot;) work group is in charge of reviewing proposed drafts.

The protocol has significantly progressed since NTPv4. , three RFC documents describing updates to the protocol have been published, not counting the numerous peripheral standards such as Network Time Security. Mills had mentioned plans for a &quot;NTPv5&quot; on his page, but one was never published. An unrelated draft termed &quot;NTPv5&quot; by M. Lichvar of chrony was initiated in 2020 and includes security, accuracy, and scaling changes.

=== SNTP ===
As NTP replaced the use of the old Time Protocol, some use cases nevertheless found the full protocol too complicated. In 1992, Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) was defined to fill this niche. The SNTPv3 standard describes a way to use NTPv3, such that no storage of state over an extended period is needed. The topology becomes essentially the same as with the Time Protocol, as only one server is used. In 1996, SNTP was updated to SNTPv4 with some features of the then-in-development NTPv4. The current version of SNTPv4 was merged into the main NTPv4 standard in 2010. SNTP is fully interoperable with NTP since it does not define a new protocol. However, the simple algorithms provide times of reduced accuracy and thus it is inadvisable to sync time from an SNTP source.

== Clock strata ==

NTP uses a hierarchical, semi-layered system of time sources. Each level of this hierarchy is termed a &quot;stratum&quot; and is assigned a number starting with zero for the reference clock at the top. A server synchronized to a stratum &quot;n&quot; server runs at stratum &quot;n&quot; + 1. The number represents the distance from the reference clock and is used to prevent cyclical dependencies in the hierarchy. Stratum is not always an indication of quality or reliability; it is common to find stratum 3 time sources that are higher quality than other stratum 2 time sources. A brief description of strata 0, 1, 2 and 3 is provided below.

; Stratum 0
: These are high-precision timekeeping devices such as atomic clocks, GNSS (including GPS) or other radio clocks, or a PTP-synchronized clock. They generate a very accurate pulse per second signal that triggers an interrupt and timestamp on a connected computer. Stratum 0 devices are also known as reference clocks. NTP servers cannot advertise themselves as stratum 0. A stratum field set to 0 in NTP packet indicates an unspecified stratum.
; Stratum 1
: These are computers whose system time is synchronized to within a few microseconds of their attached stratum 0 devices. Stratum 1 servers may peer with other stratum 1 servers for sanity check and backup. They are also referred to as primary time servers.
; Stratum 2
: These are computers that are synchronized over a network to stratum 1 servers. Often a stratum 2 computer queries several stratum 1 servers. Stratum 2 computers may also peer with other stratum 2 computers to provide more stable and robust time for all devices in the peer group.
; Stratum 3
: These are computers that are synchronized to stratum 2 servers. They employ the same algorithms for peering and data sampling as stratum 2, and can themselves act as servers for stratum 4 computers, and so on.

The upper limit for stratum is 15; stratum 16 is used to indicate that a device is unsynchronized. The NTP algorithms on each computer interact to construct a Bellman–Ford shortest-path spanning tree, to minimize the accumulated round-trip delay to the stratum 1 servers for all the clients.

In addition to stratum, the protocol is able to identify the synchronization source for each server in terms of a reference identifier (refid).

For servers on stratum 2 and below, the refid is an encoded form of the upstream time server&#x27;s IP address. For IPv4, this is simply the 32-bit address; for IPv6, it would be the first 32 bits of the MD5 hash of the source address. Refids serve to detect and prevent timing loops to the first degree.

The refid field is filled with status words in the case of kiss-o&#x27;-death (KoD) packets, which tell the client to stop sending requests so that the server can rest. Some examples are INIT (initialization), STEP (step time change), and RATE (client requesting too fast). The program output may additionally use codes not transmitted in the packet to indicate error, such as XFAC to indicate a network disconnection.

The IANA maintains a registry for refid source names and KoD codes. Informal assignments can still appear.

== Timestamps ==
The 64-bit binary fixed-point timestamps used by NTP consist of a 32-bit part for seconds and a 32-bit part for fractional second, giving a time scale that rolls over every 232 seconds (136 years) and a theoretical resolution of 2−32 seconds (233 picoseconds). NTP uses an epoch of January 1, 1900. Therefore, the first rollover occurs on February 7, 2036.

NTPv4 introduces a 128-bit date format: 64 bits for the second and 64 bits for the fractional-second. The most-significant 32 bits of this format is the &quot;Era Number&quot; which resolves rollover ambiguity in most cases. According to Mills, &quot;The 64-bit value for the fraction is enough to resolve the amount of time it takes a photon to pass an electron at the speed of light. The 64-bit second value is enough to provide unambiguous time representation until the universe goes dim.&quot;

== Clock synchronization algorithm ==
A typical NTP client regularly polls one or more NTP servers. The client must compute its time offset and round-trip delay. Time offset &quot;θ&quot; is positive or negative (client time &gt; server time) difference in absolute time between the two clocks. It is defined by

formula_1
and the round-trip delay &quot;δ&quot; by
formula_2
where
*&quot;t&quot;0 is the client&#x27;s timestamp of the request packet transmission,
*&quot;t&quot;1 is the server&#x27;s timestamp of the request packet reception,
*&quot;t&quot;2 is the server&#x27;s timestamp of the response packet transmission and
*&quot;t&quot;3 is the client&#x27;s timestamp of the response packet reception.

To derive the expression for the offset, note that for the request packet,
formula_3
and for the response packet,
formula_4
Solving for &quot;θ&quot; yields the definition of the time offset.

The values for &quot;θ&quot; and &quot;δ&quot; are passed through filters and subjected to statistical analysis (&quot;mitigation&quot;). Outliers are discarded and an estimate of time offset is derived from the best three remaining candidates. The clock frequency is then adjusted to reduce the offset gradually (&quot;discipline&quot;), creating a feedback loop.

Accurate synchronization is achieved when both the incoming and outgoing routes between the client and the server have symmetrical nominal delay. If the routes do not have a common nominal delay, a systematic bias exists of half the difference between the forward and backward travel times. A number of approaches have been proposed to measure asymmetry, but among practical implementations only chrony seems to have one included.

== Software implementations ==

=== Reference implementation ===
The NTP reference implementation, along with the protocol, has been continuously developed for over 20 years. Backwards compatibility has been maintained as new features have been added. It contains several sensitive algorithms, especially to discipline the clock, that can misbehave when synchronized to servers that use different algorithms. The software has been ported to almost every computing platform, including personal computers. It runs as a daemon called ntpd under Unix or as a service under Windows. Reference clocks are supported and their offsets are filtered and analysed in the same way as remote servers, although they are usually polled more frequently. This implementation was audited in 2017, finding 14 potential security issues.

=== Windows Time ===
All Microsoft Windows versions since Windows 2000 include the Windows Time service (W32Time), which has the ability to synchronize the computer clock to an NTP server.

W32Time was originally implemented for the purpose of the Kerberos version 5 authentication protocol, which required time to be within 5 minutes of the correct value to prevent replay attacks. The network time server in Windows 2000 Server (and Windows XP) does not implement NTP disciplined synchronization, only locally disciplined synchronization with NTP/SNTP correction.

Beginning with Windows Server 2003 and Windows Vista, the NTP provider for W32Time became compatible with a significant subset of NTPv3. Microsoft states that W32Time cannot reliably maintain time synchronization with one second accuracy. If higher accuracy is desired, Microsoft recommends using a newer version of Windows or different NTP implementation.

Beginning with Windows 10 version 1607 and Windows Server 2016, W32Time can be configured to reach time accuracy of 1 s, 50 ms or 1 ms under certain specified operating conditions.

=== OpenNTPD ===
In 2004, Henning Brauer of OpenBSD presented OpenNTPD, an NTPv3/SNTPv4 implementation with a focus on security and encompassing a privilege separated design. Whilst it is aimed more closely at the simpler generic needs of OpenBSD users, it also includes some protocol security improvements while still being compatible with existing NTP servers. The simpler code base sacrifices accuracy, deemed unnecessary in this use case. A portable version is available in Linux package repositories.

=== NTPsec ===
NTPsec is a fork of the reference implementation that has been systematically security-hardened. The fork point was in June 2015 and was in response to a series of compromises in 2014. The first production release shipped in October 2017. Between removal of unsafe features, removal of support for obsolete hardware, and removal of support for obsolete Unix variants, NTPsec has been able to pare away 75% of the original codebase, making the remainder easier to audit. A 2017 audit of the code showed eight security issues, including two that were not present in the original reference implementation, but NTPsec did not suffer from eight other issues that remained in the reference implementation.

=== chrony ===

chrony is an independent NTP implementation mainly sponsored by Red Hat, who uses it as the default time program in their distributions. Being written from scratch, has a simpler codebase allowing for better security and lower resource consumption. It does not however compromise on accuracy, instead syncing faster and better than the reference ntpd in many circumstances. It is versatile enough for ordinary computers, which are unstable, go into sleep mode or have intermittent connection to the Internet. It is also designed for virtual machines, a more unstable environment.

 has been evaluated as &quot;trustworthy&quot;, with only a few incidents. It is able to achieve improved precision on LAN connections, using hardware timestamping on the network adapter. Support for Network Time Security (NTS) was added on version 4.0. is available under GNU General Public License version 2, was created by Richard Curnow in 1997 and is currently maintained by Miroslav Lichvar.

=== ntpd-rs ===

ntpd-rs is a security-focused implementation of the NTP protocol, founded by the Internet Security Research Group as part of their Prossimo initiative for the creation of memory safe Internet infrastructure. ntpd-rs is implemented in Rust programming language which offers memory safety guarantees in addition to the Real-time computing capabilities which are required for an NTP implementation. ntpd-rs is used in security-sensitive environments such as the Let&#x27;s Encrypt non-profit Certificate Authority. Support for NTS is available. ntpd-rs is part of the &quot;Pendulum&quot; project which also includes a Precision Time Protocol implementation &quot;statime&quot;. Both projects are available under Apache and MIT software licenses.

=== Others ===
* was started by Poul-Henning Kamp of FreeBSD in 2014 and abandoned in 2015. The implementation was sponsored by the Linux Foundation.
* is the SNTP client built into systemd. It is used by Debian since version &quot;bookworm&quot; and the downstream Ubuntu.

== Leap seconds ==
On the day of a leap second event, ntpd receives notification from either a configuration file, an attached reference clock, or a remote server. Although the NTP clock is actually halted during the event, because of the requirement that time must appear to be strictly increasing, any processes that query the system time cause it to increase by a tiny amount, preserving the order of events. If a negative leap second should ever become necessary, it would be deleted with the sequence 23:59:58, 00:00:00, skipping 23:59:59.

An alternative implementation, called leap smearing, consists in introducing the leap second incrementally during a period of 24 hours, from noon to noon in UTC time. This implementation is used by Google (both internally and on their public NTP servers), Amazon AWS, and Facebook. supports leap smear in and configurations, but such use is not to be mixed with a public NTP pool as leap smear is non-standard and will throw off client calculation in a mix.

== Security concerns ==
Because adjusting system time is generally a privileged operation, part or all of NTP code has to be run with some privileges in order to support its core functionality. Only a few other security problems have been identified in the reference implementation of the NTP codebase, but those that appeared in 2009 were cause for significant concern. The protocol has been undergoing revision and review throughout its history. The codebase for the reference implementation has undergone security audits from several sources for several years.

A stack buffer overflow exploit was discovered and patched in 2014. Apple was concerned enough about this vulnerability that it used its auto-update capability for the first time. On systems using the reference implementation, which is running with root user&#x27;s credential, this could allow unlimited access. Some other implementations, such as OpenNTPD, have smaller code base and adopted other mitigation measures like privilege separation, are not subject to this flaw.

A 2017 security audit of three NTP implementations, conducted on behalf of the Linux Foundation&#x27;s Core Infrastructure Initiative, suggested that both NTP and NTPsec were more problematic than chrony from a security standpoint.

NTP servers can be susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks unless packets are cryptographically signed for authentication. The computational overhead involved can make this impractical on busy servers, particularly during denial of service attacks. NTP message spoofing from a man-in-the-middle attack can be used to alter clocks on client computers and allow a number of attacks based on bypassing of cryptographic key expiration. Some of the services affected by fake NTP messages identified are TLS, DNSSEC, various caching schemes (such as DNS cache), Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), Bitcoin and a number of persistent login schemes.

NTP has been used in distributed denial of service attacks. A small query is sent to an NTP server with the return IP address spoofed to be the target address. Similar to the DNS amplification attack, the server responds with a much larger reply that allows an attacker to substantially increase the amount of data being sent to the target. To avoid participating in an attack, NTP server software can be upgraded or servers can be configured to ignore external queries.

=== Secure extensions ===

NTP itself includes support for authenticating servers to clients. NTPv3 supports a symmetric key mode, which is not useful against MITM. The public key system known as &quot;autokey&quot; in NTPv4 adapted from IPSec offers useful authentication, but is not practical for a busy server. Autokey was also later found to suffer from several design flaws, with no correction published, save for a change in the message authentication code. Autokey should no longer be used.

Network Time Security (NTS) is a secure version of NTPv4 with TLS and AEAD. The main improvement over previous attempts is that a separate &quot;key establishment&quot; server handles the heavy asymmetric cryptography, which needs to be done only once. If the server goes down, previous users would still be able to fetch time without fear of MITM. NTS is supported by several NTP servers including Cloudflare and Netnod. It can be enabled on , NTPsec, and ntpd-rs.

Microsoft also has an approach to authenticate NTPv3/SNTPv4 packets using a Windows domain identity, known as MS-SNTP. This system is implemented in the reference ntpd and chrony, using samba for the domain connection.

<text>Pere Bosch-Gimpera (1891 in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain – 1974 in Mexico) was a Spanish-born Mexican archaeologist and anthropologist.

He went into exile in Mexico, with many other intellectuals, after the Spanish Civil War. He became a Mexican citizen in 1971.

==Career==
Although he began studying Law, he changed to Philology, in which he obtained a doctorate in 1911. With the aim of becoming professor of Greek he also obtained a doctorate in History in 1913. From 1911 to 1914 he studied Greek Philology, Prehistory and Ancient History in Berlin, with the aid of a scholarship. Once there, the advice of Wilamowitz-Moellendorf made him change course and he moved from Greek language and literature to prehistoric archaeology.

From 1916 to 1939, he was chair of Ancient and Medieval History at the University of Barcelona. At the same time he served as director of the Archaeological Research Service of the “Institut d&#x27;Estudis Catalans”. From the publication in 1919 of &quot;Prehistòria Catalana&quot;, he strongly advocated the use of Catalan in scientific publications. Between 1916 and 1931, he led the archaeological section of the museums of Barcelona; from 1931 to 1933, he was dean of the Faculty of Philosophy and Philology; between 1933 and 1939, he was president of the University of Barcelona.

Involved in Catalan politics, he was Minister of Justice of Catalonia in the Government of Lluís Companys. After the events of 6 October 1934, he was made prisoner along with other members of the Catalan Government on the ship &quot;Uruguay&quot;, which aroused international complaints. After the Spanish Civil War he went into exile in Mexico, together with many intellectuals. Subsequently, he suffered from a vilifying campaign at the University of Barcelona. He acquired Mexican nationality in 1971.

He also taught at the universities of Berlin (1921), Edinburgh (1936), Oxford (1939–1941), Paris (1961) and Heidelberg (1966), among other European universities. From 1941, he was professor at the Autonomous University and the School (Escuela General) of Archaeology at the University of Mexico City, positions he held until his death in 1974. 
He was also a professor at the University of Guatemala (1945–1947), director of the Division of Philosophy and Humanities of UNESCO (1948–1953), and secretary general of the Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences (1953–1966)

<doc id="159890" wikidata="Q200642" url="?curid=159890" title="Palatine Hill">
<text>The Palatine Hill (; Classical Latin: &quot;Palatium&quot;; Neo-Latin: &quot;Collis/Mons Palatinus&quot;; ), which relative to the seven hills of Rome is the centremost, is one of the most ancient parts of the city; it has been called &quot;the first nucleus of the Roman Empire&quot;. The site is now mainly a large open-air museum whilst the Palatine Museum houses many finds from the excavations here and from other ancient Italian sites. 

Imperial palaces were built there, starting with Augustus. Before imperial times the hill was mostly occupied by the houses of the rich.

The hill originally had two summits separated by a depression; the highest part was called Palatium and the other Germalus (or Cermalus). Using the Forma Urbis its perimeter enclosed ; while the Regionary Catalogues of the 4th century enclose .

== Etymology ==

According to Livy (59 BC – AD 17) the Palatine hill got its name from the Arcadian settlers from Pallantium, named from its founder Pallas, son of Lycaon. More likely, it is derived from the noun &quot;palātum&quot; &quot;palate&quot;; Ennius uses it once for the &quot;heaven&quot;, and it may be connected with the Etruscan word for sky, &quot;falad&quot;.

The name of the hill is the etymological origin of the word &quot;palace&quot; and its cognates in other languages (Greek: &quot;παλάτιον&quot;, , , Spanish: &quot;palacio&quot;, Portuguese: &quot;palácio&quot;, and &quot;Palast&quot;, , , etc.). 

The Palatine Hill is also the etymological origin (via the Latin adjective &quot;&quot;) of &quot;palatine&quot;, a 16th-century English adjective that originally signified something pertaining to the Caesar&#x27;s palace, or someone who is invested with the king&#x27;s authority. Later its use shifted to a reference to the German Palatinate. The office of the German count palatine (&quot;Pfalzgraf&quot;) had its origins in the &quot;comes palatinus&quot;, an earlier office in Merovingian and Carolingian times.

Another modern English word, &quot;&quot;, came into usage to refer to any distinguished knight (especially one of the Twelve Peers of Charlemagne) under Charlemagne in late renditions of the Matter of France.

==Mythology==
According to Roman mythology, the Palatine Hill was the location of the cave, known as the Lupercal, where Romulus and Remus were found by the she-wolf Lupa that kept them alive. This is also the hill on which the adult Romulus chose to found the city, and where he murdered his brother Remus. This ritualistic murder on the Palatine formed an important part of Roman identity and the mythological origins of the Pomerium.

Another legend occurring on the Palatine is Hercules&#x27; defeat of Cacus after the monster had stolen some cattle. Hercules struck Cacus with his characteristic club so hard that it formed a cleft on the southeast corner of the hill, where later a staircase bearing the name of Cacus was constructed.

==History==

Rome has its origins on the Palatine. Excavations show that people have lived in the area since the 10th century BC. Excavations performed on the hill in 1907 and again in 1948 unearthed a collection of huts believed to have been used for funerary purposes between the 9th and 7th century BC approximating the time period when the city of Rome was founded.

Pallantium was an ancient city near the Tiber river on the Italian peninsula. Roman mythology, as recounted in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; for example, states that the city was founded by Evander of Pallene and other ancient Greeks sometime previous to the Trojan War. In addition, Dionysius of Halicarnassus writes that Romans say that the city was founded by Greeks from Pallantium of Arcadia, about sixty years before the Trojan war and the leader was Evander. The myth of the city&#x27;s origin was significant in ancient Roman mythology because Pallantium became one of the cities that was merged later into ancient Rome, thereby tying Rome&#x27;s origins to the ancient Greek heroes. Other cities in the area were founded by various Italic tribes.

Virgil states that Evander named the city in honor of his ancestor, Pallas, although Pausanias as well as Dionysius of Halicarnassus say that Evander&#x27;s birth city was Pallantium, and thus he named the new city after the one in Arcadia. Dionysius of Halicarnassus also mention that some writers, including Polybius of Megalopolis, say that the town was named after Pallas, who was the son of Heracles and Lavinia, the daughter of Evander, and when he died his grandfather raised a tomb to him on the hill and called the place Pallantium, after him.

According to Livy, after the immigration of the Sabines and the Albans to Rome, the original Romans lived on the Palatine. The Palatine Hill was also the site of the ancient festival of the Lupercalia.

Many affluent Romans of the Republican period ( – 44 BC) had their residences there.

From the start of the Empire (27 BC) Augustus built his palace there and the hill gradually became the exclusive domain of emperors; the ruins of the palaces of at least Augustus (27 BC – 14 AD), Tiberius (14 – 37 AD) and Domitian (81 – 96 AD) can still be seen.

Augustus also built a temple to Apollo here.

The Great Fire of Rome in AD 64 destroyed Nero&#x27;s palace, the Domus Transitoria, but he replaced it by AD 69 with the even larger Domus Aurea, over which was eventually built Domitian&#x27;s Palace.

From the 16th century, the hill was owned by the Farnese family and was occupied by the Farnese Gardens, still partially preserved above the remains of the Domus Tiberiana.

At the top of the hill, between the Domus Flavia and the Domus Augustana, the Villa Mattei was built in the 16th century, then purchased around 1830 by the Scot Charles Mills who turned it into an elaborate neo-Gothic villa. At the end of the 19th century the villa was converted into a convent. This was partially demolished from 1928 to allow excavations and in the surviving part of the building the Palatine Museum has been installed.

==Monuments==

Dominating the site is the Palace of Domitian which was rebuilt largely during the reign of Domitian over earlier buildings of Nero. Later emperors, particularly those of the Severan Dynasty, made significant additions to the buildings, notably the Domus Severiana.

===The Palace of Domitian===
===Houses of Livia and Augustus===

The House of Livia, the wife of Augustus, is conventionally attributed to her based only on the generic name on a clay pipe and circumstantial factors such as proximity to the House of Augustus.

The building is located near the Temple of Magna Mater at the western end of the hill, on a lower terrace from the temple. It is notable for its frescoes.

===House of Tiberius===
Known as the Domus Tiberiana because the original house was built by Tiberius, he spent much of his time in his palaces in Campania and Capri. It was later incorporated into Nero&#x27;s Domus Transitoria. Part of its remains lie in the current Farnese Gardens.

===Domus Severiana===
===Temple of Cybele===
===Temple of Apollo Palatinus===
===Septizodium===
===Domus Transitoria===
==Excavations==

Already during Augustus&#x27; reign an area of the Palatine Hill was subject to a sort of archaeological expedition which found fragments of Bronze Age pots and tools. He declared this site the &quot;original town of Rome.&quot; Modern archaeology has identified evidence of Bronze Age settlement in the area which predates Rome&#x27;s founding. 

Intensive archaeological excavations began in the 18th century and culminated in the late 19th century, after the proclamation of Rome as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy. Discoveries continued sporadically throughout the 20th century until the present time.
In 2006, archaeologists announced the discovery of the Palatine House, believed to be the birthplace of Rome&#x27;s first Emperor, Augustus. A section of corridor and other fragments under the Hill were found and described as &quot;a very ancient aristocratic house.&quot; The two-story house appears to have been built around an atrium, with frescoed walls and mosaic flooring, and is situated on the slope of the Palatine that overlooks the Colosseum and the Arch of Constantine. The Republican-era houses on the Palatine were overbuilt by later palaces after the Great Fire of Rome (AD 64), but apparently this one was not and perhaps was preserved for an important reason. On the ground floor, three shops opened onto the Via Sacra. The location of the &quot;domus&quot; is significant because of its potential proximity to the &quot;Curiae Veteres&quot;, the earliest shrine of the &quot;curies&quot; of Rome.

In 2007 the legendary Lupercal cave was claimed to have been found beneath the remains of the &quot;Domus Livia&quot; (House of Livia) on the Palatine. Archaeologists came across the 16-metre-deep cavity while restoring the decaying palace, with a richly decorated vault encrusted with mosaics and seashells. The Lupercal was probably converted to a sanctuary by Romans in later centuries. Many others have denied its identification with the Lupercal on topographic and stylistic grounds, and believe that the grotto is actually a &quot;nymphaeum&quot; or underground &quot;triclinium&quot; from Neronian times.

<text>The Shipping Forecast is a BBC Radio broadcast of weather reports and forecasts for the seas around the British Isles. It is produced by the Met Office and broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The forecast dates back over 150 years. There are currently two or three broadcasts per day, at 00:48, 05:20, and 17:54 (weekends only) UK local time.

In the forecast, the waters around the British Isles are divided into 31 sea areas, also known as weather areas. The forecast begins by listing areas with gale warnings, followed by a general synopsis of pressure areas, then a forecast for each individual sea area covering wind speed and direction, precipitation, and visibility. Extended forecasts at 00:48 and 05:20 include information from coastal weather stations and an inshore waters forecast.

The unique and distinctive presentation style of these broadcasts has led to their attracting an audience much wider than that directly interested in maritime weather conditions. It is frequently referred to and parodied in British popular culture.

==History==

The Shipping Forecast was established by Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy, the first professional weather forecaster, captain of and founder of the Met Office. In October 1859, the steam clipper &quot;Royal Charter&quot; was wrecked in a strong storm off Anglesey; 450 people lost their lives. In response to this loss, FitzRoy introduced a warning service for shipping in February 1861, using telegraph communications. This remained the United Kingdom&#x27;s Met Office primary responsibility for some time afterward. In 1911, the Met Office began issuing marine weather forecasts which included gale and storm warnings via radio transmission for areas around Great Britain. This service was discontinued during and following the First World War, between 1914 and June 1921, and again during the Second World War between 1939 and 1945.

The programme was first broadcast on the radio on 1 January 1924, then called &quot;Weather Shipping&quot;. From October 1925, it has been broadcast by the BBC.

Today, although most ships have onboard technology to provide the Forecast&#x27;s information, they still use it to check their data.

On Friday 30 May 2014, for the first time in more than 90 years, BBC Radio 4 failed to broadcast the Shipping Forecast at 0520. Staff at Broadcasting House were reading out the report but it was not transmitted. Listeners instead heard BBC World Service.

The 150th anniversary of the shipping forecast was on 24 August 2017.

Between 30 March 2020 and 5 July 2020, as a result of emergency rescheduling because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of bulletins a day was reduced to three, at 00:48, 05:33, and either 12:03 (weekdays) or 17:54 (weekends).

==Broadcast times and frequencies==
From 1 April 2024, there is no longer a separate long wave schedule for Radio 4, so the number of broadcasts per day has been reduced to two on weekdays and three at weekends, at the following (UK local) times. They can be received on long wave, FM, DAB and online via BBC Sounds.
* 00:48. Includes weather reports from an extended list of coastal stations at 00:52 and an inshore waters forecast at 00:55 and concludes with a brief UK weather outlook for the coming day. The broadcast finishes at approximately 00:58.
* 05:20. Includes weather reports from coastal stations at 05:25, and an inshore waters forecast at 05:27.
* 17:54 (Saturdays and Sundays only).

The 00:48 and 17:54 forecasts are read by the duty announcer, but the 05:20 forecast is read by the weather forecaster (there being no separate Radio 4 continuity operation at that time).

Until 31 March 2024, there were four broadcasts per day at the following (UK local) times:
* 00:48 – transmitted on FM and LW. 
* 05:20 – transmitted on FM and LW. 
* 12:01 – normally transmitted on LW only.
* 17:54 – transmitted only on LW on weekdays, as an opt-out from the &quot;PM&quot; programme, but at weekends transmitted on both FM and LW.

===Longwave===
The Shipping Forecast has been broadcast on BBC longwave radio services so the signal can be received clearly at sea all around the British Isles, regardless of time of day or radio conditions. The forecast was broadcast on the BBC National Programme until September 1939, and then after the Second World War on the BBC Light Programme (later BBC Radio 2) until November 1978. When BBC Radio 4 took over the longwave frequency from Radio 2 on 23 November 1978, the Shipping Forecast was moved to Radio 4 to keep it broadcasting on longwave.

As part of the BBC&#x27;s plans to switch off BBC Radio 4 longwave transmissions, it reduced daily broadcasts of the Shipping Forecast to the FM simulcast schedule of twice on weekdays and three times on weekends in April 2024.

===Online===
The Shipping Forecast is published online by the Met Office and the BBC. It is also available on BBC Sounds.

===Television broadcasts===
On 18 December 1993, as part of the &quot;Arena Radio Night&quot;, BBC Radio 4 and BBC 2 collaborated on a one off simulcast so the shipping forecast – read that night by Laurie Macmillan – could be seen as well as heard. To date, it is the only time that it has been broadcast on television.

==Region names==

The 31 sea areas covered in the forecast are as shown in this table and map. The forecast follows the order shown, going clockwise around the British Isles, with each area except Trafalgar, Irish Sea, Shannon, and Fair Isle bordering the previous. Trafalgar is included only in the 00:48 forecast, except when gales or more are due there.
These areas still largely follow the format of the chart adopted in 1949. In 1955, meteorologists from countries bordering the North Sea met and recommended the following changes: that the area Heligoland be renamed German Bight, to conform with the name generally used by other countries; that a new area, Fisher, be split off from the north-eastern half of Dogger; that a new area, Viking, be split off from the northern half of Forties; and that the area Iceland be renamed Southeast Iceland to clarify its position. After international consultation, these were adopted in 1956. In August 1984, to conform with common North Sea area boundaries agreed upon by neighbouring countries, the areas North Utsire and South Utsire were created. In 2002, the area Finisterre was renamed FitzRoy, to avoid confusion with a different area called Finisterre used by the Spanish meteorological service. 

The sea areas match the forecast areas used by other North Sea countries, though some names differ. The Dutch KNMI and Norwegian counterpart names Forties the Fladen Ground, while uses for Dover, for Wight, for Portland and for Plymouth.

===Coastal weather stations===
The coastal weather stations named in the Shipping Forecast (and numbered on the map) are:

* Tiree Automatic (1)
* Stornoway (2)
* Lerwick (3)
* Wick Automatic (0048 only)
* Aberdeen (0048 only)
* Leuchars (4)
* Boulmer (0048 only)
* Bridlington (5)
* Sandettie Light Vessel Automatic (6)
* Greenwich Light Vessel Automatic (7)
* St. Catherine&#x27;s Point Automatic (0048 only)
* Jersey (8)
* Channel Light Vessel Automatic (9)
* Scilly Automatic (10)
* Milford Haven (0048 only)
* Aberporth (0048 only)
* Valley (0048 only)
* Liverpool Crosby (0048 only)
* Valentia (11)
* Ronaldsway (12)
* Malin Head (13)
* Machrihanish Automatic (0048 only)
===Inshore waters===
The inshore waters forecast uses the following coastal areas of the United Kingdom: 

# Cape Wrath – Rattray Head including Orkney
# Rattray Head – Berwick-upon-Tweed
# Berwick-upon-Tweed – Whitby
# Whitby – Gibraltar Point
# Gibraltar Point – North Foreland
# North Foreland – Selsey Bill
# Selsey Bill – Lyme Regis
# Lyme Regis – Land&#x27;s End including the Isles of Scilly
# Land&#x27;s End – St David&#x27;s Head including the Bristol Channel
# St David&#x27;s Head – Great Orme Head including St George&#x27;s Channel
# Great Orme Head – Mull of Galloway
# Isle of Man
# Lough Foyle – Carlingford Lough (covers the entire coastline of Northern Ireland)
# Mull of Galloway – Mull of Kintyre including the Firth of Clyde and the North Channel
# Mull of Kintyre – Ardnamurchan Point
# Ardnamurchan Point – Cape Wrath
# Shetland Isles

==Broadcast format==

The Shipping Forecast follows a very strict format. Excluding the header line, it has a limit of 350 words—except for the 0048 broadcast, where it is increased to 380 to accommodate Trafalgar&#x27;s inclusion. 

Forecast times are spelled out as digits on the 24-hour clock, for example &quot;two-three-double-O&quot;, and barometric pressures are pronounced as whole numbers, for example &quot;a thousand and five&quot;. With regard to the timing of weather events, the words &quot;Imminent&quot;, &quot;Soon&quot; and &quot;Later&quot; are used and are tightly defined. &quot;Imminent&quot; means within 6 hours, &quot;Soon&quot; means within 6 to 12 hours and &quot;Later&quot; means within 12 to 24 hours.

The basic order of the forecast is:

# Gale warnings in force (if any)
# General synopsis
# Area forecasts: wind direction/speed, weather, visibility, ship icing if any
# Coastal weather stations (00:48 and 05:20 only): wind direction/speed, precipitation if any, visibility, pressure
# Inshore waters (00:48 and 05:20 only): wind direction/speed, weather, visibility

===Introduction, gale warnings, and general synopsis ===
The forecast begins with &quot;And now the Shipping Forecast, issued by the Met Office on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency at xxxx today.&quot; This format is followed quite strictly, although some continuity announcers read out the actual date of issue as opposed to the word &quot;today&quot;. 

This is followed by gale warnings (winds of force 8 or more on the Beaufort scale), if any (e.g., &quot;There are warnings of gales in Rockall, Malin, Hebrides, Bailey, and Fair Isle&quot;). This sometimes follows the opposite format (e.g., &quot;There are warnings of gales in all areas except Biscay, Trafalgar and FitzRoy&quot;).

The general synopsis follows, giving the position, pressure (in millibars) and track of pressure areas (e.g., &quot;Low, Rockall, 987, deepening rapidly, expected Fair Isle 964 by 0700 tomorrow&quot;). With the information provided in the Shipping Forecast it is possible to compile a pressure chart for the coasts of northwestern Europe. 

===Area forecasts===
Each area&#x27;s 24-hour forecast is then read out. Several areas may be combined into a single forecast where the conditions are expected to be similar. Wind direction is given first, then strength (on the Beaufort scale), followed by precipitation, if any, and (usually) lastly visibility.

Change in wind direction is indicated by &quot;veering&quot; (clockwise change) or &quot;backing&quot; (anti-clockwise change). Winds at or above force 8 are also described by name for emphasis, i.e., Gale 8, Severe Gale 9, Storm 10, Violent Storm 11 and Hurricane force 12. The word &quot;force&quot; is only officially used when announcing force 12 winds. 

Visibility is given in the format &quot;Good&quot;, meaning that the visibility is greater than ; &quot;Moderate&quot;, where visibility is between nautical miles; &quot;Poor&quot;, where visibility is between 1,000 metres and two nautical miles and &quot;Fog&quot;, where visibility is less than . When severe winter cold combines with strong winds and a cold sea, icing can occur, normally only in sea area Southeast Iceland; if expected, icing warnings (light, moderate or severe) are given as the last item of each sea area forecast.
Examples of area forecasts:
:* &quot;Humber, Thames. Southeast veering southwest 4 or 5, occasionally 6 later. Thundery showers. Moderate or good, occasionally poor.&quot;
:* &quot;Tyne, Dogger. Northeast 3 or 4. Occasional rain. Moderate or poor.&quot;
:* &quot;Rockall, Malin, Hebrides. Southwest gale 8 to storm 10, veering west, severe gale 9 to violent storm 11. Rain, then squally showers. Poor, becoming moderate.&quot;
:* &quot;Southeast Iceland. Northerly 7 to severe gale 9. Heavy snow showers. Good, becoming poor in showers. Moderate icing.&quot;

On 10 January 1993, during the Braer Storm, a record North Atlantic low pressure of 914 mb was recorded. The shipping forecast was:
:* &quot;Rockall, Malin, Hebrides, Bailey. Southwest hurricane force 12 or more.&quot;

===Coastal weather stations and inshore waters===
Extended shipping forecasts (00:48 and 05:20) also include weather reports from coastal weather stations followed by a forecast for the inshore waters of the United Kingdom. This additional information does not fall within the 350/380-word restriction.

The reports for coastal weather stations use the following format: name of the station, wind direction/speed, precipitation (if any), visibility in miles, barometric pressure, and trend in pressure. For example, &quot;Machrihanish Automatic. West by south 6, rain, 1 mile, 981, falling more slowly.&quot;

The inshore waters forecast begins with a summary of the general situation, followed by forecasts for coastal sections, moving clockwise, using a format similar to that used for sea areas.

==&quot;Sailing By&quot;==
The 00:48 Shipping Forecast, at the end of the broadcast day, is traditionally preceded by the playing of &quot;Sailing By&quot;, a light orchestral piece by Ronald Binge. This is only very rarely omitted, generally when the schedule is running late. Though occasionally played in full, it is common for only a section of the piece to be broadcast; that section being the length required to fill the gap between the previous programme&#x27;s ending and the start of the forecast at precisely 00:48. &quot;Sailing By&quot; serves as an identification tool – it is distinctive and as such assists anyone attempting to tune in. The forecast is then followed by a more general weather report, the sign-off, traditionally ending with the presenter wishing the audience a good night, the national anthem &quot;God Save the King&quot; and the closedown of the station for the day, with the BBC World Service taking over the frequencies after the pips of the Greenwich Time Signal at 01:00.

==Related forecasts==
The Shipping Forecast should not be confused with similar broadcasts given by HM Coastguard to vessels at sea tuned into marine VHF and MF radio frequencies. HM Coastguard&#x27;s broadcasts can only be heard by vessels or persons using or tuned into marine VHF and MF radio frequencies, whereas the Shipping Forecast can be heard by anyone tuned into BBC Radio 4. The Coastguard&#x27;s broadcasts follow the same format as the shipping forecast using the same terminology and style, but the information only normally applies to the area sector or region covered by that particular Coastguard Co-ordination Centre (such as the Bristol Channel, for instance). 

Announcements of pending broadcasts by HM Coastguard are given on marine channel 16 VHF and are announced with (e.g.), &quot;Sécurité. All stations. This is Milford Haven Coastguard... For the Maritime Safety Information, list on Channel 62. This is Milford Haven Coastguard.&quot;

A similar broadcast on MF is initially announced on 2182 kHz, with a further frequency specified, e.g., 1770 kHz. VHF optimum range is approximately 30 nautical miles (nmi), effectively line of sight, whereas MF range is much greater at approximately 150nmi, allowing ships in the Atlantic Ocean and North Sea to receive the broadcast.

The forecasts sent over the Navtex system use a similar format and the same sea areas. 

RTÉ Radio 1 broadcasts coastal reports for Ireland similar to those in the Shipping Forecast for the UK. Also in Sweden, Svergies Radio P1 broadcasts maritime weather broadcasts &quot;()&quot; similar to the Shipping Forecast during its weather forecasts which its receives from SMHI. The Swedish forecast uses the same names as the British forecast in the areas that Shipping Forecast uses, except they are translated into Swedish for example German Bight is known as Tyska bukten.

==Influences on popular culture==
The Shipping Forecast is immensely popular with the British public; it attracts listeners in the hundreds of thousands daily – far more than actually require it. In 1995, a plan to move the late night broadcast by 12 minutes triggered angry newspaper editorials and debates in the UK Parliament and was ultimately scrapped. Similar outcry greeted the Met Office&#x27;s decision to rename Finisterre to FitzRoy, but in that case, the decision was carried through. Peter Jefferson, who read the Forecast for 40 years until 2009, says that he received letters from listeners across the UK saying that the 0048 broadcast helped them get to sleep after a long day. The Controller of BBC Radio 4, Mark Damazer, attempted to explain its popularity:
Zeb Soanes, a regular Shipping Forecast reader, described it thus:

Soanes also wrote the foreword to &quot;The Shipping Forecast Puzzle Book&quot; (BBC Books, 2020), in which he explains:The forecast gives the wind direction and force, atmospheric pressure, visibility and the state of the sea. It is a nightly litany with a rhythm and indefinable poetry that have made it popular with millions of people who never have cause to put to sea and have little idea what it actually means; a reminder that whilst you&#x27;re tucked-up safely under the bedclothes, far out over the waves it&#x27;s a wilder and more dangerous picture, one that captures the imagination and leads it into uncharted waters whilst you sleep. Dependable, reassuring and never hurried, in these especially uncertain times The Shipping Forecast is a still small voice of calm across the airwaves.

Another regular reader of the Forecast, Kathy Clugston, described it as &quot;Like a lullaby, almost&quot;. Jo Ellison of &quot;Financial Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Over time it has become a beloved cultural icon, a tacit expression of our national identity.&quot;

The Twentieth Century Society Director Catherine Croft commented:
BBC Sounds took inspiration by the comments from people using the forecast to fall asleep and created a podcast called &quot;The Sleeping Forecast,&quot; where samples of the forecast are paired with classical and ambient music.

===Music===
The Shipping Forecast has inspired a number of songs and poems, including the following:
===Radio===
Frank Muir and Denis Norden parodied the Shipping Forecast in a song written for an episode of &quot;Take It From Here&quot;:
&quot;Dead Ringers&quot; parodied the Shipping Forecast using Brian Perkins rapping the forecast (&quot;Dogger, Fisher, German Bight – becoming quite cyclonic. Occasional showers making you feel cat-atatatatatata-tonic...&quot;). Many other versions have been used including a &quot;Dale Warning&quot; to warn where Dale Winton could be found over the coming period, and a spoof in which sailors are warned of ghostly galleons and other nightmarish apparitions.

Stephen Fry, in his 1988 radio programme &quot;Saturday Night Fry&quot;, issued the following &quot;Shipping Forecast&quot; in the first episode of the programme:
The BBC Radio 4 monologue sketch show &quot;One&quot; features a number of Shipping Forecast parodies, written by David Quantick and Daniel Maier, such as the following, originally broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Thursday 21 February 2008:
In an episode of the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;Live on Arrival&quot;, Steve Punt reads the Shopping Forecast, in which the regions are replaced with supermarket names, e.g. &quot;Tesco, Fine Fare, Sainsbury&quot;. The sketch ends with the information, &quot;joke mileage decreasing, end of show imminent&quot;.

On the broadcast at 0048 on Saturday 19 March 2011, the area forecasts were delivered by John Prescott to raise awareness of Red Nose Day 2011, a charity event organised by Comic Relief. The format then reverted to the BBC continuity announcer Alice Arnold for the reports on coastal areas. On delivering the area forecast for Humber, Prescott (who had represented the parliamentary constituency of Kingston upon Hull East for almost 40 years before retiring) slipped deliberately into his distinctive East Yorkshire accent – &quot;&#x27;Umber – without the &#x27;H&#x27;, as we say it up there&quot;.

The comedian Marti Caine listed the Shipping Forecast as one of her eight records when she made her second appearance on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; on 24 March 1991.

The BBC Radio 1 &quot;That&#x27;s What He Said&quot; podcast by Greg James featured the shipping forecast being read out by Grace Hopper. This was done to make light of her inability to pronounce certain words.

On his December 28 2024 BBC Radio 6 show, Gilles Peterson paid tribute to “100 years of The Shipping Forecast” playing “Seamus Heaney The Shipping Forecast - Poem”.

On 1 January 2025 BBC Radio 4 broadcast a series of programmes under the title &quot;Shipping Forecast Day&quot;, to mark the start of a year of celebrations of the centenary of the Shipping Forecast.

===Film and television===
Terence Davies&#x27; film &quot;Distant Voices, Still Lives&quot;, a largely autobiographical account of growing up in Liverpool during the 1940s and 1950s, opens with a shipping forecast from this period.

In an episode of the BBC sitcom &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;, a soon-to-be-sailing Hyacinth Bucket calls over the telephone for an advance shipping forecast, even though the yacht she and her husband Richard are to visit is moored on the Thames near Oxford. Names mentioned (in scene sequence) are: Fisher, German Bight and Cromarty, Dogger and Heligoland (also known as German Bight).

In an episode of the BBC sitcom &quot;Ever Decreasing Circles&quot;, Howard and Hilda leave their neighbour Paul&#x27;s house party early, explaining that they must get back to listen to the Shipping Forecast. Paul asks why, seeing as they have never owned a boat. Howard explains, &quot;Well, it takes us nicely into the news.&quot;

Mentioned briefly in the film &quot;Kes&quot;

A recording of part of the forecast is played over the opening and closing credits of Rick Stein&#x27;s 2000 TV series &quot;Rick Stein&#x27;s Seafood Lover&#x27;s Guide&quot;.

In an episode of the Channel 4 television series &quot;Black Books&quot;, the character Fran Katzenjammer listens to the shipping forecast because a friend from her college is reading it. She finds his voice arousing.

In the BBC sitcom &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;, the character Mrs Bale is obsessed by and constantly mentions The Shipping Forecast much to the befuddlement of the other characters.

Many characters in the 1983 children&#x27;s cartoon, &quot;The Adventures of Portland Bill&quot; are named after features mentioned in the Shipping Forecast.

In the 2011 movie &quot;Page Eight&quot;, the Shipping Forecast plays as the main protagonist Jonnie Worricker drives his car through London late at night.

In the movie &quot;I, Daniel Blake&quot;, the titular character&#x27;s late wife is said to have been a listener of the Shipping Forecast, with Daniel playing &quot;Sailing By&quot; on a cassette. The song is played at the end of the film at Daniel&#x27;s funeral.

The actress Olivia Colman has said that listening to the Shipping Forecast through an earpiece helps her keep her emotions in check while filming some of the more emotional scenes on &quot;The Crown&quot;, to accurately portray the cool and collected character of the monarch Elizabeth II.

===Video games===
In Funcom&#x27;s massively multiplayer online role-playing game &quot;The Secret World&quot;, the shipping forecast plays over the radio in a London Underground station, adding to the British flavour distinguishing the setting from other worldwide locations featured in the game.

===Literature===
A number of minor characters in Jasper Fforde&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot;, are named after Sea Areas in the shipping forecast.

Charlie Connelly&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;Attention All Shipping&quot; (Little Brown: ) describes a project to visit every sea area with any land, and to travel by air or sea over the others.

In the &quot;New York Times&quot; magazine dated 19 February 2023, the letter of recommendation by Grace Linden was an article on the shipping forecast, in which she stated: &quot;Like the sea itself, the Shipping Forecast is a reminder of the larger, more elemental forces at play, those things that are much more powerful than any of our individual worries or wants.&quot;

&quot;Moderate Becoming Good Later&quot; (Summersdale: ) is a 2023 book by siblings Toby and Katie Carr, describing Toby&#x27;s kayaking trip around the shipping areas; Katie completed the book, from Toby&#x27;s notes, after his death.

In Carol Ann Duffy&#x27;s poem &quot;Prayer&quot;, the final line is &quot;Darkness outside. Inside, the radio&#x27;s prayer - Rockall. Malin. Dogger. Finisterre.&quot;

In Amelia Ellis&#x27; 2008 novel &quot;The Fourth Aspect&quot;, the protagonist is overcome by an emotional reaction when by chance listening to the shipping forecast on a road trip from London to the Scottish Highlands, leading her to the realization that &quot;Sometimes we hold on to things or people for reasons that have nothing to do with them at all.&quot;

===Art===
For his project &quot;The Shipping Forecast – an Artist&#x27;s Journey&quot;, which began in 2015, the Troon-based artist Ian Rawnsley plans to travel by sea through each of the sea areas and create a painting inspired by each, to raise funds for Macmillan Cancer Support.

=== Bedtime story ===
In March 2017, Peter Jefferson recorded a reinvented version of the Shipping Forecast as &quot;a bedtime story for grown-ups&quot;.

<text>The Doolittle Raid, also known as Doolittle&#x27;s Raid, as well as the Tokyo Raid, was an air raid on 18 April 1942 by the United States on the Japanese capital Tokyo and other places on Honshu during World War II. It was the first American air operation to strike the Japanese archipelago. Although the raid caused comparatively minor damage, it demonstrated that the Japanese mainland was vulnerable to American air attacks. It served as an initial retaliation for the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor, and provided an important boost to American morale. The raid was named after Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle, who planned and led the attack. It was one of six American carrier raids against Japan and Japanese-held territories conducted in the first half of 1942.

Under the final plan, 16 B-25B Mitchell medium bombers, each with a crew of five, were launched from the US Navy aircraft carrier , in the Pacific Ocean. There were no fighter escorts. After bombing the military and industrial targets, the crews were to continue westward to land in China.

On the ground, the raid killed around 50 people and injured 400. Damage to Japanese military and industrial targets was minimal, but the raid had major psychological effects. In the United States, it raised morale. In Japan, it raised fear and doubt about the ability of military leaders to defend the home islands, but the bombing and strafing of civilians created a desire for retribution—this was exploited for propaganda purposes. The raid also pushed forward Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto&#x27;s plans to attack Midway Island in the Central Pacific—an attack that turned into a decisive defeat of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) by the US Navy in the Battle of Midway. The consequences of the Doolittle Raid were most severely felt in China: in reprisal for the raid, the Japanese launched the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign, killing 250,000 civilians and 70,000 soldiers.

Of the 16 crews involved, 14 returned to the United States or reached the safety of American forces, though one man was killed while bailing out. Eight men were captured by Japanese forces in eastern China (the other two crew members having drowned in the sea), and three of them were later executed. All but one of the 16 B-25s were destroyed in crashes, while one of the planes landed at Vladivostok in the Soviet Union.

Because the Soviet Union was not officially at war with Japan, it was required, under international law, to intern the crew for the duration of the war, and their B-25 was confiscated. However, within a year, the crew was secretly allowed to leave the Soviet Union, under the guise of an escape—they returned to the United States or to American units elsewhere by way of Allied-occupied Iran and North Africa.

Doolittle initially believed that the loss of all of his aircraft would lead to his court-martial—instead he received the Medal of Honor and was promoted two ranks to brigadier general.

==Background==

President Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in a meeting at the White House on 21 December 1941 and said that Japan should be bombed as soon as possible to boost public morale after Pearl Harbor. Doolittle recounted in his autobiography that the raid was intended to bolster American morale and to cause the Japanese to begin doubting their leadership: &quot;An attack on the Japanese homeland would cause confusion in the minds of the Japanese people and sow doubt about the reliability of their leaders. ... Americans badly needed a morale boost.&quot;

The concept for the attack came from Navy Captain Francis S. Low, Assistant Chief of Staff for antisubmarine warfare. He reported to Admiral Ernest J. King on 10 January 1942 that he thought that twin-engined Army bombers could be launched from an aircraft carrier, after observing several at Naval Station Norfolk Chambers Field in Norfolk, where the runway was painted with the outline of a carrier deck for landing practice. Doolittle, a famous military test pilot, civilian aviator, and aeronautical engineer before the war, was assigned to Army Air Forces Headquarters to plan the raid. The aircraft to be used would need a cruising range of with a bomb load, so Doolittle selected the B-25B Mitchell to carry out the mission. The range of the Mitchell was about 1,300 miles, so the bombers had to be modified to hold nearly twice the normal fuel reserves. Doolittle also considered the Martin B-26 Marauder, Douglas B-18 Bolo, and Douglas B-23 Dragon, but the B-26 had questionable takeoff characteristics from a carrier deck and the B-23&#x27;s wingspan was nearly 50-percent greater than the B-25&#x27;s, reducing the number that could be taken aboard a carrier and posing risks to the ship&#x27;s superstructure. The B-18 was one of the final two types that Doolittle considered, and he rejected it for the same reason. The B-25 had yet to see combat, but tests indicated that it could fulfill the mission&#x27;s requirements.

Doolittle&#x27;s first report on the plan suggested that the bombers might land in Vladivostok, shortening the flight by on the basis of turning over the B-25s as Lend-Lease. Negotiations with the Soviet Union were fruitless for permission to land because it had signed a neutrality pact with Japan in April 1941. China&#x27;s Chiang Kai-shek agreed to the landing sites in China despite the concern of Japanese reprisals. Five possible airfields were selected. These sites would serve as refueling stops, allowing the crews to fly to Chongqing. Bombers attacking defended targets often relied on a fighter escort to defend them from enemy fighters, but accompanying fighters were not possible.

==Preparation==

When planning indicated that the B-25 was the aircraft that best met all of the requirements of the mission, two were loaded aboard the aircraft carrier at Norfolk and were flown off the deck without difficulty on 3 February 1942. The raid was immediately approved and the 17th Bombardment Group (Medium) was chosen to provide the pool of crews from which volunteers would be recruited. The 17th BG had been the first group to receive B-25s, with all four of its squadrons equipped with the bomber by September 1941. The 17th not only was the first medium bomb group of the Army Air Corps, but in early 1942, also had the most experienced B-25 crews. Its first assignment following the entry of the United States into the war was to the U.S. Eighth Air Force.

The 17th BG, then flying antisubmarine patrols from Pendleton, Oregon, was immediately moved cross-country to Columbia Army Air Base at West Columbia, South Carolina, ostensibly to fly similar patrols off the East Coast of the United States, but in actuality to prepare for the mission against Japan. The group officially transferred effective 9 February 1942 to Columbia, where its combat crews were offered the opportunity to volunteer for an &quot;extremely hazardous&quot;, but unspecified mission. On 19 February, the group was detached from the Eighth Air Force and officially assigned to III Bomber Command.

Initial planning called for 20 aircraft to fly the mission, and 24 of the group&#x27;s B-25B Mitchell bombers were diverted to the Mid-Continent Airlines modification center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. With support provided by two senior airline managers, Wold-Chamberlain Field&#x27;s maintenance hangar was the first modification center to become operational. From nearby Fort Snelling, the 710th Military Police Battalion provided tight security around this hangar. B-25B aircraft modifications included the following:
* Removal of the lower gun turret.
* Installation of de-icers and anti-icers.
* Mounting of steel blast plates on the fuselage around the upper turret.
* Removal of the liaison radio set to save weight.
* Installation of a collapsible neoprene auxiliary fuel tank, fixed to the top of the bomb bay, and installation of support mounts for additional fuel cells in the bomb bay, crawlway, and lower turret area, to increase fuel capacity from 646 to 1,141 U.S. gallons (538 to 950 imperial gallons, or 2,445 to 4,319 L).
* Installation of mock gun barrels (broomsticks) in the tail cone.
* Replacement of the Norden bombsight with a makeshift aiming sight devised by pilot Capt. C. Ross Greening that was dubbed the &quot;Mark Twain&quot;. The materials for this bombsight cost only 20 cents.

Two bombers also had cameras mounted to record the results of the bombing.

The 24 crews were selected and picked up the modified bombers in Minneapolis and flew them to Eglin Field, Florida, beginning 1 March 1942. There, the crews received concentrated training for three weeks in simulated carrier deck takeoffs, low-level and night flying, low-altitude bombing, and over-water navigation, operating primarily out of Eglin Auxiliary Field #1, a more secluded site. Lieutenant Henry L. Miller, a U.S. Navy flight instructor from nearby Naval Air Station Pensacola, supervised their takeoff training and accompanied the crews to the launch. For his efforts, Miller is considered an honorary member of the Raider group.

Doolittle stated in his after-action report that the crews reached a &quot;safely operational&quot; level of training, despite several days when flying was not possible because of rain and fog. One aircraft was written off in a landing accident on 10 March and another was heavily damaged in a takeoff accident on 23 March, while a third was removed from the mission because of a nose wheel shimmy that could not be repaired in time.

On 25 March 1942, the remaining 22 B-25s took off from Eglin for McClellan Field, California. They arrived two days later at the Sacramento Air Depot for inspection and final modifications. According to notes written at the time, five crews did additional training on March 30 and 31 at the Willows-Glenn County Airport. A total of 16 B-25s were flown to Naval Air Station Alameda on 31 March. Fifteen made up the mission force and the 16th, by last-minute agreement with the Navy, was loaded so that it could be launched shortly after departure from San Francisco to demonstrate to the Army pilots that there was sufficient deck space for a safe takeoff. Instead, that bomber was made part of the mission force.

==Participating aircraft==

In order of launching, the 16 aircraft were:

== Mission ==

On 1 April 1942, the 16 modified bombers, their five-man crews, and Army maintenance personnel, totaling 71 officers and 130 enlisted men, were loaded onto &quot;Hornet&quot; at Naval Air Station Alameda in California. Each aircraft carried four specially constructed 500-pound (225 kg) bombs. Three of these were high-explosive munitions and one was a bundle of incendiaries. The incendiaries were long tubes, wrapped together to be carried in the bomb bay, but designed to separate and scatter over a wide area after release. Five bombs had Japanese &quot;friendship&quot; medals wired to them—medals awarded by the Japanese government to U.S. servicemen before the war.

The bombers&#x27; armament was reduced to increase range by decreasing weight. Each bomber launched with two .50-caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns in an upper turret and a .30-caliber (7.62 mm) machine gun in the nose. The aircraft were clustered closely and tied down on &quot;Hornet&quot;″s flight deck in the order of launch.

&quot;Hornet&quot; and Task Force 18 got underway from San Francisco Bay at 08:48 on 2 April with the 16 bombers in clear view. At noon the next day, parts to complete modifications that had not been finished at McClellan were lowered to the forward deck of &quot;Hornet&quot; by Navy blimp &quot;L-8&quot;. A few days later, the carrier met with Task Force 16, commanded by Vice Admiral William Halsey Jr.—the carrier and her escort of cruisers and destroyers in the mid-Pacific Ocean north of Hawaii. &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s fighters and scout planes provided protection for the entire task force in the event of a Japanese air attack, since &quot;Hornet&quot;″s fighters were stowed below decks to allow the B-25s to use the flight deck.

The combined force was two carriers (&quot;Hornet&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot;), three heavy cruisers (, , ), one light cruiser (), eight destroyers (, , , , , , , ), and two fleet oilers ( and ). The ships proceeded in radio silence. On the afternoon of 17 April, the slow oilers refueled the task force, then withdrew with the destroyers to the east while the carriers and cruisers dashed west at toward their intended launch point in enemy-controlled waters east of Japan.
At 07:38 on the morning of 18 April, while the task force was still about from Japan (around ), it was sighted by the Japanese picket boat No. 23&quot; Nittō Maru&quot;, a 70-ton patrol craft, which radioed an attack warning to Japan. The boat was sunk by gunfire from &quot;Nashville&quot;. The chief petty officer who captained the boat killed himself rather than be captured, but five of the 11 crew were picked up by &quot;Nashville&quot;.

Doolittle and &quot;Hornet&quot; skipper Captain Marc Mitscher decided to launch the B-25s immediately—10 hours early and farther from Japan than planned. After respotting to allow for engine start and runups, Doolittle&#x27;s aircraft had of takeoff distance. Although none of the B-25 pilots, including Doolittle, had ever taken off from a carrier before, all 16 aircraft launched safely between 08:20 and 09:19, though Doolittle&#x27;s bomber was witnessed to have almost hit the water before pulling up at the last second. The B-25s then flew toward Japan, most in groups of two to four aircraft, before flying singly at wave-top level to avoid detection.

The aircraft began arriving over Japan about noon Tokyo time, six hours after launch, climbed to and bombed 10 military and industrial targets in Tokyo, two in Yokohama, and one each in Yokosuka, Nagoya, Kobe, and Osaka. Although some B-25s encountered light antiaircraft fire and a few enemy fighters (made up of Ki-45s and prototype Ki-61s, the latter being mistaken for Bf 109s) over Japan, no bomber was shot down. Only the B-25 of 1st Lt. Richard O. Joyce received any battle damage, minor hits from antiaircraft fire. B-25 No. 4, piloted by 1st Lt. Everett W. Holstrom, jettisoned its bombs before reaching its target when it came under attack by fighters after its gun turret malfunctioned.

The Americans claimed to have shot down three Japanese fighters—one by the gunners of the &quot;Whirling Dervish&quot;, piloted by 1st Lt. Harold Watson, and two by the gunners of the &quot;Hari Kari-er&quot;, piloted by 1st Lt. Ross Greening. Many targets were strafed by the bombers&#x27; nose gunners. The subterfuge of the simulated gun barrels mounted in the tail cones was described afterwards by Doolittle as effective, in that no airplane was attacked directly from behind.

Fifteen of the 16 aircraft then proceeded southwest off the southeastern coast of Japan and across the East China Sea toward eastern China. One B-25, piloted by Captain Edward J. York, was extremely low on fuel, and headed instead for the Soviet Union rather than be forced to ditch in the middle of the East China Sea. Several fields in Zhejiang province were supposed to be ready to guide them in using homing beacons, then recover and refuel them for continuing on to Chongqing, the wartime Kuomintang capital. The primary base was at Zhuzhou, toward which all the aircraft navigated, but Halsey never sent the planned signal to alert them, apparently because of a possible threat to the task force.

The raiders faced several unforeseen challenges during their flight to China: night was approaching, the aircraft were running low on fuel, and the weather was rapidly deteriorating. None would have reached China if not for a tail wind as they came off the target, which increased their ground speed by for seven hours. The crews realized they would probably not be able to reach their intended bases in China, leaving them the option of either bailing out over eastern China or crash-landing along the Chinese coast.

All 15 aircraft reached the Chinese coast after 13 hours of flight and crash-landed or the crews bailed out. One crewman, 20-year-old Corporal Leland D. Faktor, flight engineer/gunner with 1st Lt. Robert M. Gray, was killed during his bailout attempt over China, the only man in that crew to be lost. Two crews (10 men) were missing.

The 16th aircraft, commanded by Capt. Edward York (eighth off – AC #40-2242) flew to the Soviet Union and landed beyond Vladivostok at Vozdvizhenka. As the USSR was not at war with Japan, and the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact was officially in force, the Soviet government was officially unable to immediately repatriate any Allied personnel involved in hostilities who entered Soviet territory. Furthermore, at the time, the Soviet Far East was vulnerable to military action by Japanese forces. Consequently, in accordance with international law, the crew members were interned, despite official US requests for their release, and the B-25 was impounded. York would later report that he and his crew had been treated well by the Soviet authorities. Several months later, they were relocated to Ashgabat (Ashkhabad), in what was then the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic, from the Soviet-Iranian border. In mid-1943, they were allowed to cross the border into Allied-occupied Iran. The Americans presented themselves to a British consulate on 11 May 1943. A cover story was concocted that York had bribed a smuggler to assist them in escaping from Soviet custody. The fact that the &quot;smuggling&quot; had been staged by the NKVD was later confirmed by declassified Soviet archives.

Doolittle and his crew, after parachuting into China, received assistance from Chinese soldiers and civilians, as well as John Birch, an American missionary in China. As did the others who participated in the mission, Doolittle had to bail out, but he landed in a heap of dung (saving a previously injured ankle from breaking) in a paddy in China near Quzhou. The mission was the longest ever flown in combat by the B-25 Mitchell medium bomber, averaging about .

==Aftermath==
===Fate of the missing crewmen===

Following the Doolittle Raid, most of the B-25 crews who had reached China eventually found safety with the help of Chinese civilians and soldiers.
Of the 16 planes and 80 airmen who participated in the raid, all either crash-landed, were ditched, or crashed after their crews bailed out, with the single exception of Capt. York and his crew, who landed in the Soviet Union. Despite the loss of these 15 aircraft, 69 airmen escaped capture or death, with only three killed in action. When the Chinese helped the Americans escape, the grateful Americans, in turn, gave them whatever they had on hand. The people who helped them paid dearly for sheltering the Americans. Most of them were tortured and executed for giving aid. During the search an estimated 250,000 Chinese lives were taken by the Japanese Imperial Army. Eight Raiders were captured, but their fate was only known in April 1943.
Some of the men who crashed were aided by Patrick Cleary, the Irish Bishop of Nancheng. The Japanese troops retaliated by burning down the city.

The crews of two aircraft (10 men in total) were unaccounted for: those of 1st Lt. Dean E. Hallmark (sixth off) and 1st Lt. William G. Farrow (last off). On 15 August 1942, the United States learned from the Swiss Consulate General in Shanghai that eight of the missing crew members were prisoners of the Japanese at the city&#x27;s police headquarters. Two of the missing crewmen, bombardier S/Sgt. William J. Dieter and flight engineer Sgt. Donald E. Fitzmaurice of Hallmark&#x27;s crew, were found to have drowned when their B-25 crashed into the sea. Both of their remains were recovered after the war and were buried with military honors at Golden Gate National Cemetery.

The other eight were captured: 1st Lt. Dean E. Hallmark, 1st Lt. William G. Farrow, 1st Lt. Robert J. Meder, 1st Lt. Chase Nielsen, 1st Lt. Robert L. Hite, 2nd Lt. George Barr, Cpl. Harold A. Spatz, and Cpl. Jacob DeShazer. All eight captured in Jiangxi were tried and sentenced to death at a military trial in China, and then transported to Tokyo. There the Army Ministry reviewed their case, with five of the sentences being commuted and the other three being executed. Out of the 80 crewmen, three died, eight were captured, and three were killed in captivity by the Japanese.

The surviving captured airmen remained in military confinement on a starvation diet, their health rapidly deteriorating. In April 1943, they were moved to Nanjing, where Meder died on 1 December 1943. The remaining men—Nielsen, Hite, Barr and DeShazer—eventually began receiving slightly better treatment and were given a copy of the Bible and a few other books. They were freed by American troops in August 1945. Four Japanese officers were tried for war crimes against the captured Doolittle Raiders, found guilty, and sentenced to hard labor, three for five years and one for nine years. Barr had been near death when liberated and remained in China recuperating until October, by which time he had begun to experience severe emotional problems. Untreated after transfer to Letterman Army Hospital and a military hospital in Clinton, Iowa, Barr became suicidal and was held virtually incommunicado until November, when Doolittle&#x27;s personal intervention resulted in treatment that led to his recovery. DeShazer graduated from Seattle Pacific University in 1948 and returned to Japan as a missionary, where he served for over 30 years.

When their remains were recovered after the war, Farrow, Hallmark, and Meder were buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. Spatz was buried with military honors at National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. Of the surviving prisoners, Barr died of heart failure in 1967, Nielsen in 2007, DeShazer on 15 March 2008, and the last, Hite, died 29 March 2015.

===Service of the returning crewmen===

Immediately following the raid, Doolittle told his crew that he believed the loss of all 16 aircraft, coupled with the relatively minor damage to targets, had rendered the attack a failure, and that he expected a court-martial upon his return to the United States. Instead, the raid bolstered American morale. Doolittle was promoted two grades to brigadier general on 28 April while still in China, skipping the rank of colonel, and was presented with the Medal of Honor by Roosevelt upon his return to the United States in June. When General Doolittle toured the growing Eglin Field facility in July 1942 with commanding officer Col. Grandison Gardner, the local paper of record (the &quot;Okaloosa News-Journal&quot;, Crestview, Florida), while reporting his presence, made no mention of his still-secret recent training at Eglin. He went on to command the Twelfth Air Force in North Africa, the Fifteenth Air Force in the Mediterranean, and the Eighth Air Force in England during the next three years.
All 80 Raiders were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, and those who were killed or wounded during the raid were awarded the Purple Heart. Every Doolittle Raider was also decorated by the Chinese government. In addition, Corporal David J. Thatcher (a flight engineer/gunner on Lawson&#x27;s crew) and 1st Lt. Thomas R. White (flight surgeon/gunner with Smith) were awarded the Silver Star for helping the wounded crew members of Lt. Lawson&#x27;s crew to evade Japanese troops in China. Finally, as Doolittle noted in his autobiography, he successfully insisted that all of the Raiders receive a promotion.

Twenty-eight of the crewmen remained in the China Burma India theater, including the entire crews of planes 4, 10, and 13, flying missions, most for more than a year; five were killed in action. Nineteen crew members flew combat missions in the Mediterranean theater after returning to the United States, four of whom were killed in action and four becoming prisoners of war. Nine crew members served in the European Theater of Operations; one was killed in action, and one, David M. &quot;Davy&quot; Jones, was shot down and became a POW in Stalag Luft III at Sagan, where he played a part in The Great Escape. Altogether, 12 of the survivors died in air crashes within 15 months of the raid. Two survivors were separated from the USAAF in 1944 due to the severity of their injuries.

The 17th Bomb Group, from which the Doolittle Raiders had been recruited, received replacement crews and transferred to Barksdale Army Air Field in June 1942, where it converted to Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers. In November 1942, it deployed overseas to North Africa, where it operated in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations with the Twelfth Air Force for the remainder of the war.

===Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign===

After the raid, the Japanese Imperial Army began the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign (also known as Operation Sei-go) to prevent these eastern coastal provinces of China from being used again for an attack on Japan and to take revenge on the Chinese people. An area of some was laid waste. &quot;Like a swarm of locusts, they left behind nothing but destruction and chaos&quot;, eyewitness Father Wendelin Dunker wrote. The Japanese killed an estimated 10,000 Chinese civilians during their search for Doolittle&#x27;s men. People who aided the airmen were tortured before they were killed. Father Dunker wrote of the destruction of the town of Ihwang: &quot;They shot any man, woman, child, cow, hog, or just about anything that moved, They raped any woman from the ages of 10–65, and before burning the town they thoroughly looted it ... None of the humans shot were buried either&quot;. The Japanese entered Nancheng (Jiangxi), population 50,000 on June 11, &quot;beginning a reign of terror so horrendous that missionaries would later dub it &#x27;the Rape of Nancheng, evoking memories of the infamous Rape of Nanjing five years before. Less than a month later, the Japanese forces put what remained of the city to the torch. &quot;This planned burning was carried on for three days,&quot; one Chinese newspaper reported, &quot;and the city of Nancheng became charred earth.&quot;

When Japanese troops moved out of the Zhejiang and Jiangxi areas in mid-August, they left behind a trail of devastation. Chinese estimates put the civilian death toll at 250,000. The Imperial Japanese Army had also spread cholera, typhoid, plague infected fleas and dysentery pathogens. The Japanese biological warfare Unit 731 brought almost 300 pounds of paratyphoid and anthrax to be left in contaminated food and contaminated wells with the withdrawal of the army from areas around Yushan, Kinhwa and Futsin. Around 1,700 Japanese troops died out of a total 10,000 Japanese soldiers who fell ill with disease when their biological weapons attack rebounded on their own forces.

Shunroku Hata, the commander of Japanese forces involved in the massacre of the 250,000 Chinese civilians, was sentenced in 1948 in part due to his &quot;failure to prevent atrocities&quot;. He was given a life sentence but was paroled in 1954.

=== Battle of the Coral Sea ===

Admiral Nimitz attempted to commit &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot; to support and against Japanese forces involved in Operation Mo. However, the close timing between the Doolittle Raid and the eventual Battle of the Coral Sea prevented &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot; from being able to take part in the battle in early May 1942.

=== Additional perspectives ===
Doolittle recounted in his autobiography that at the time he thought the mission was a failure and he would be demoted upon return to the US.

This mission showed that a B-25 takeoff from a carrier was easier than previously thought, and night operations could be possible in the future. Shuttle bombing runs (taking off and landing at different air bases) were shown to be an effective carrier task force tactic since there was no need for the ships to wait for the returning aircraft.

The American pilots, instead of landing as planned, were forced to bail out due to a lack of ground lighting to provide guidance. Chinese airfield crews recounted that due to the unexpected early arrival of the B-25s, homing beacon and runway torch lights were not on for fear of possible Japanese airstrikes (as had happened previously). If Claire Lee Chennault had been informed of the mission specifics, the outcome might have been very much better for the Americans: Chennault had built an effective air surveillance net in China that would have been able to provide updated arrival information about the raiders to the airfield crews, and could have confirmed that there was no risk of Japanese airstrikes, allowing the landing lights to be lit at the time necessary to allow safe landings.

Chiang Kai-Shek awarded the raiders China&#x27;s highest military decorations, and predicted (in his diary) that Japan would alter its goals and strategy as a result of the disgrace. Indeed, the raid was a shock to staff at Japanese Imperial General Headquarters. As a direct consequence, Japan attacked territories in China to prevent similar shuttle bombing runs. High command withdrew substantial air force resources from supporting offensive operations in order to defend the home islands. The Aleutian Islands campaign was launched to prevent the US from using the islands as bomber bases to attack Japan—this required two carriers that otherwise would have been used for the Battle of Midway. Thus, the raid&#x27;s most significant strategic accomplishment was that it compelled the Japanese high command into ordering a very inefficient disposition of their forces, and poor decision-making due to fear of attack, for the rest of the war.

Mitsuo Fuchida and Shigeyoshi Miwa considered the &quot;one-way&quot; raid &quot;excellent strategy&quot;, with the bombers evading Army fighters by flying &quot;much lower than anticipated&quot;. Kuroshima said the raid &quot;passed like a shiver over Japan&quot; and Miwa criticized the Army for claiming to have shot down nine aircraft rather than &quot;not even one&quot;.

== Effect ==

Compared with the future devastating Boeing B-29 Superfortress attacks against Japan, the Doolittle raid did little material damage, and all of it was easily repaired. Preliminary reports stated 12 were killed and more than 100 were wounded. Eight primary and five secondary targets were struck. In Tokyo, the targets included an oil tank farm, a steel mill, and several power plants. In Yokosuka, at least one bomb from the B-25 piloted by 1st Lt. Edgar E. McElroy struck the nearly completed light carrier , delaying her launch until November. Six schools and an army hospital were also hit. Japanese officials reported the two aircraft whose crews were captured had struck their targets.
Allied ambassadors and staff in Tokyo were still interned until agreement was reached about their repatriation via the neutral port of Lourenço Marques in Portuguese East Africa in June–July 1942. When Joseph Grew (US) realized the low-flying planes overhead were American (not Japanese planes on maneuvers) he thought they may have flown from the Aleutian Islands. The Japanese press claimed that nine had been shot down, but there were no pictures of crashed planes. Embassy staff were &quot;very happy and proud&quot; and the British said that they &quot;drank toasts all day to the American flyers&quot;. Sir Robert Craigie, the interned British Ambassador to Japan who was under house arrest in Tokyo at the time, said that Japanese staff had been amused at the embassy&#x27;s air raid precautions as the idea of an attack on Tokyo was &quot;laughable&quot; with the Allies in retreat, but the guards now showed &quot;considerable excitement and perturbation&quot;. Several false alarms followed, and in poorer districts people rushed into the streets shouting and gesticulating, losing their normal &quot;iron control&quot; over their emotions and showing a &quot;tendency to panic&quot;. The police guards on Allied and neutral missions were doubled to foil reprisal attacks; and the guard on the German mission was tripled.

Despite the minimal damage inflicted, American morale, still reeling from the attack on Pearl Harbor and Japan&#x27;s subsequent territorial gains, soared when news of the raid was released. The Japanese press was told to describe the attack as a cruel, indiscriminate bombing against civilians, including women and children. After the war, the casualty count was 87 dead, 151 serious injuries, and more than 311 minor injuries; children were among those killed, and newspapers asked their parents to share their opinion on how the captured raiders should be treated.

The Japanese Navy attempted to locate and pursue the American task force. The Second Fleet, its main striking force, was near Formosa, returning from the Indian Ocean Raid to refit and replace its air losses. Spearheaded by five aircraft carriers and its best naval aircraft and aircrews, the Second Fleet was immediately ordered to locate and destroy the U.S. carrier force, but failed to do so, due to the American fleet choosing to head back to Hawaii (had they stayed after all, they would&#x27;ve found themselves attacked by the carriers &quot;Akagi&quot;, and ). Nagumo and his staff on &quot;Akagi&quot; heard that an American force was near Japan but expected an attack on the next day.

The Imperial Japanese Navy also bore a special responsibility for allowing an American aircraft carrier force to approach the Japanese Home Islands in a manner similar to the IJN fleet to Hawaii in 1941, and permitting it to escape undamaged. The fact that medium, normally land-based bombers carried out the attack confused the IJN&#x27;s high command. This confusion and the knowledge that Japan was now vulnerable to air attack strengthened Yamamoto&#x27;s resolve to destroy the American carrier fleet, which was not present in the Pearl Harbor Attack, resulting in a decisive Japanese defeat several weeks later at the Battle of Midway.

After the raid the Americans were worried in April about the &quot;still very badly undermanned west coast&quot; and Chief of Staff George Marshall discussed a &quot;possible attack by the Japanese upon our plants in San Diego and then a flight by those Japs down into Mexico after they have made their attack&quot;. So Secretary Stimson asked State to &quot;touch base with their people south of the border&quot;, and Marshall flew to the West Coast on 22 May.

An unusual consequence of the raid came after when—in the interests of secrecy—President Roosevelt answered a reporter&#x27;s question by saying that the raid had been launched from &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, the fictional faraway land of the James Hilton novel &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;. The true details of the raid were revealed to the public one year later, in April 1943. The Navy, in 1944, commissioned the , with Doolittle&#x27;s wife Josephine as the sponsor.

== After the war ==


The Doolittle Raiders held an annual reunion almost every year from the late 1940s to 2013. The high point of each reunion was a solemn, private ceremony in which the surviving Raiders performed a roll call, then toasted their fellow Raiders who had died during the previous year. Specially engraved silver goblets, one for each of the 80 Raiders, were used for this toast; the goblets of those who had died were inverted. Each Raider&#x27;s name was engraved on his goblet both right side up and upside down. The Raiders drank a toast using a bottle of cognac that accompanied the goblets to each Raider reunion. In 2013, the remaining Raiders decided to hold their last public reunion at Fort Walton Beach, Florida, not far from Eglin Air Force Base, where they trained for the original mission. The bottle and the goblets had been maintained by the United States Air Force Academy on display in Arnold Hall, the cadet social center, until 2006. On 19 April 2006, these memorabilia were transferred to the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

On 18 April 2013, a final reunion for the surviving Raiders was held at Eglin Air Force Base, with Robert Hite the only survivor unable to attend.

The &quot;final toast to fallen comrades&quot; by the surviving raiders took place at the NMUSAF on 9 November 2013, preceded by a B-25 flyover, and was attended by Richard Cole, Edward Saylor, and David Thatcher.

Seven other men, including Lt. Miller and raider historian Col. Carroll V. Glines, are considered honorary Raiders for their efforts for the mission.

The Children of the Doolittle Raiders organization was founded on 18 April 2006, authorized by the Doolittle Raiders organization and the surviving members at the time. Descendants of the Doolittle Raiders organize fundraisers for a scholarship fund and continue to organize the Doolittle Raiders reunions. The 2019 reunion was held at Lt. Col. Richard E. Cole&#x27;s memorial service.

===Last surviving airmen===
Col. Bill Bower, the last surviving Doolittle raider aircraft commander, died on 10 January 2011 at age 93 in Boulder, Colorado.

Lt. Col. Edward Saylor, the then-enlisted engineer/gunner of aircraft No. 15 during the raid, died 28 January 2015 of natural causes at his home in Sumner, Washington, at the age of 94.

Lt. Col. Robert L. Hite, co-pilot of aircraft No. 16, died at a nursing home in Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 95 on 29 March 2015. Hite was the last living prisoner of the Doolittle Raid.

S/Sgt. David J. Thatcher, gunner of aircraft No. 7, died on 22 June 2016 in Missoula, Montana, at the age of 94.

Lt Col. Richard E. Cole, Doolittle&#x27;s copilot in aircraft No. 1, was the last surviving Doolittle Raider and the only one to live to an older age than Doolittle, who died in 1993 at age 96. Cole was the only Raider still alive when the wreckage of &quot;Hornet&quot; was found in late January 2019 by the research vessel at a depth of more than off the Solomon Islands. Cole died 9 April 2019, at the age of 103.

===Doolittle Raid exhibits===
The most extensive display of Doolittle Raid memorabilia is at the National Museum of the United States Air Force (on Wright-Patterson Air Force Base) in Dayton, Ohio. The centerpiece is a like-new B-25, which is painted and marked as Doolittle&#x27;s aircraft, &quot;40-2344&quot;, (rebuilt by North American Aviation to B-25B configuration from an F-10D photo reconnaissance version of the B-25D). The bomber, which North American Aviation presented to the Raiders in 1958, rests on a reproduction of &quot;Hornet&quot;″s flight deck. Several authentically dressed mannequins surround the aircraft, including representations of Doolittle, &quot;Hornet&quot; Captain Marc Mitscher, and groups of Army and Navy men loading the bomber&#x27;s bombs and ammunition. Also exhibited are the silver goblets used by the Raiders at each of their annual reunions, pieces of flight clothing and personal equipment, a parachute used by one of the Raiders in his bailout over China, and group photographs of all 16 crews, and other items.

The last B-25 to be retired from the U.S. Air Force inventory is displayed at the Air Force Armament Museum at Eglin AFB, also in the markings of Gen. Doolittle&#x27;s aircraft.

A fragment of the wreckage of one of the aircraft, and the medals awarded to Doolittle, are on display at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.

The 2006 Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor on Ford Island, Oʻahu, Hawaii, also has a 1942 exhibit in which the centerpiece is a restored B-25 in the markings of &quot;The Ruptured Duck&quot; used on the Doolittle Raid.

The San Marcos, Texas, chapter of the Commemorative Air Force has in its museum the armor plate from the pilot seat of the B-25 Doolittle flew in the raid.

The interchange of Edmund Highway (South Carolina 302) and Interstate 26 nearest the former Columbia Army Air Base is designated the Doolittle Raiders Interchange.

In China, a memorial hall honoring the Doolittle Raiders and the Chinese who provided them with assistance in aftermath of the raid is located at the city of Jiangshan in Quzhou, Zhejiang.

A small exhibit about the Doolittle Raid exists (or used to?) at the USS &quot;Hornet&quot; Museum in Alameda, California.

=== Doolittle Raiders re-enactment ===

On 21 April 1992, in conjunction with other Department of Defense World War II 50th-Anniversary Commemorative Events, two B-25 Mitchell bombers, B-25J &quot;Heavenly Body&quot; and B-25J &quot;In The Mood&quot;, were hoisted aboard . The bombers participated in a commemorative re-enactment of the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, taking off from &quot;Ranger&quot;″s flight deck before more than 1,500 guests. The launch took place off the coast of San Diego. Four B-25s were approved by the US Navy for the reenactment with two selected. The other two participants were B-25J &quot;Executive Sweet&quot; and B-25J &quot;Pacific Princess&quot;. Following the launch, eight B-25s flew up the coast where General Doolittle and his son John P. Doolittle watched as each B-25 came in for a low pass, dropping 250 red, white, and blue carnations into the surf, concluding the event.

=== Congressional Gold Medal ===

On 19 May 2014, the United States House of Representatives passed , to award the Doolittle Raiders a Congressional Gold Medal for &quot;outstanding heroism, valor, skill, and service to the United States in conducting the bombings of Tokyo.&quot; The award ceremony took place at the Capitol Building on 15 April 2015 with retired Air Force Lieutenant General John Hudson, the Director of the National Museum of the Air Force, accepting the award on behalf of the Doolittle Raiders.

=== Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider ===
In September 2016, the Northrop Grumman B-21 was formally named &quot;Raider&quot; in honor of the Doolittle Raiders. The last surviving Doolittle Raider, retired Lt Col Richard E. Cole, was present at the naming ceremony at the Air Force Association conference. The name is fitting since the Doolittle Raiders flew such a long distance and the B-21 Raider is also intended to have an extremely long range. This is because it is designed for the Indo-Pacific theater, where ranges are very long.

==In popular culture==
===Books===
Many books have been written about the Doolittle Raid:
* &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; (1943), by Captain Ted W. Lawson – a pilot who participated in the raid, focuses on the experiences of himself and his crew. A popular film based on the book was released in 1944. Written while the war was still in progress, Lawson disguised the identities of the persons in China assisting the raiders and did not publish the story until after the USAAF had released an official communique on 20 April 1943 detailing most aspects of the mission, including the identities of the raiders and their fates.
* &quot;Doolittle&#x27;s Tokyo Raiders&quot;, by C. V. Glines (1964) – tells the complete story of the raid, including the unique experiences of each B-25 crew. He followed this with a second account, &quot;The Doolittle Raid: America&#x27;s daring first strike against Japan&quot; (1988), incorporating information from first-hand accounts of the Raiders and from Japanese sources.
* &quot;Target Tokyo: Jimmy Doolittle and the Raid That Avenged Pearl Harbor&quot;, by James M. Scott (2015) – based on scores of never-before-published records drawn from archives across four continents as well as new interviews with survivors.
* &quot;Last Mission to Tokyo&quot;, by Michel Paradis (2020) – revealed the story of the two crews who were captured by the Japanese and the war crimes trials that followed based upon newly discovered records in the United States and Japan.
* &quot;Raid of No Return&quot;, by Nathan Hale (2017) – a fictionalized account of the raid, presented in graphic novel format for early readers; the book is a part of the Nathan Hale&#x27;s &quot;Hazardous Tales&quot; series.
* &quot;The First Heroes: The Extraordinary Story of the Doolittle Raid – America&#x27;s First World War II Victory&quot;, by Craig Nelson (2003)

===Films===
The raid inspired several films.

A highly fictionalized film in 1943, &quot;Destination Tokyo&quot; starring Cary Grant, tangentially involved the raid, concentrating on the fictional submarine . The submarine&#x27;s mission is to enter Tokyo Bay undetected and place a landing party ashore to obtain weather information vital to the upcoming Doolittle raid. The film suggests the raid did not launch until up-to-the-minute data were received. All the after-action reports indicated the raid launched without time for weather briefings because of the encounter with the picket ship.

A 1944 film, &quot;The Purple Heart&quot;, was a highly fictionalized account of the torture and execution of Doolittle Raid prisoners.

The Doolittle Raid was the subject of another 1944 feature film, &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot;, based on the book of the same title by Ted Lawson, who was seriously injured in a crash landing off the coast of China. Spencer Tracy played Doolittle and Van Johnson portrayed Lawson. Footage from the film was later used for the opening scenes of &quot;Midway&quot; and in the TV miniseries &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;.

The 2001 film &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (with Alec Baldwin playing Doolittle) presented a heavily fictionalized version of the raid. The film used the retired World War II aircraft carrier in Corpus Christi, Texas, to stand in for a Japanese carrier, while the aircraft were launched from , standing in for &quot;Hornet&quot; from which the Doolittle Raid was launched. The film&#x27;s portrayal of the planning of the raid, the air raid itself, and the raid&#x27;s aftermath, is not historically accurate.

The VHS video &quot;DeShazer&quot;, including film footage of Doolittle and the flight preparations, along with the B-25s launching, is the story of missionary Sergeant Jake DeShazer of B-25 No. 16 (the last to launch from &quot;Hornet&quot;). The video is based on &quot;The Amazing Story of Sergeant Jacob De Shazer: The Doolittle Raider Who Turned Missionary&quot; by C. Hoyt Watson. At the end of both the video and the book, DeShazer after the war meets Mitsuo Fuchida, the commander and lead pilot of the Pearl Harbor attack.

&quot;Doolittle&#x27;s Raiders: A Final Toast&quot;, a documentary by Tim Gray and the World War II Foundation, released in 2015, has interviews with the few surviving members of the raid.

The 2018 film &quot;The Chinese Widow&quot; (aka &quot;The Hidden Soldier&quot; and &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot;) presented a heavily fictionalized version of the raid with Emile Hirsch playing a fictional Captain Jack Turner who was hidden from the Japanese in China by a Chinese widow and her daughter, after he parachutes from his B-25 near her village. Vincent Riotta played Jimmy Doolittle.

The raid is depicted in the 2019 film &quot;Midway&quot;, with actor Aaron Eckhart portraying Jimmy Doolittle. Emperor Hirohito is seen being told to go to a shelter during this scene.

=== Television ===
The character of Harry Broderick in the 1979 television series &quot;Salvage 1&quot; (played by Andy Griffith), was a fictional veteran of the raid.

<text>Gustav Meyrink (19 January 1868 – 4 December 1932) was the pseudonym of Gustav Meyer, an Austrian author, 
novelist, dramatist, translator, and banker, most famous for his novel &quot;The Golem&quot;.
He has been described as the &quot;most respected German language writer in the field of supernatural fiction&quot;.

==Childhood==

Gustav Meyrink was born with the name &quot;Gustav Meyer&quot; in Vienna, Austria-Hungary (now Austria) on 19 January 1868. He was the illegitimate son of Baron Karl von Varnbüler und zu Hemmingen, a Württembergian minister, and actress Maria Wilhelmina Adelheyd Meier. Meyrink was not, despite the statements of some of his contemporaries, of Jewish descent – this rumour arose due to a confusion of his mother with a Jewish woman of the same name.

Until thirteen years of age Meyrink lived mainly in Munich, where he completed elementary school. He then stayed in Hamburg for a brief time, until his mother relocated to Prague in 1883.

==Prague==

Meyrink lived in Prague for twenty years and has depicted it many times in his works. In 1889, together with the nephew of poet Christian Morgenstern, Meyrink established his own banking company, named &quot;Meier &amp; Morgenstern&quot;.

In Prague an event occurred which played a providential role in Meyrink&#x27;s life. Meyrink described it in the autobiographical short story &quot;The Pilot&quot;. That day, 14 August 1892, on Assumption Eve, Meyrink, twenty-four years old, was allegedly standing at his table with a gun at his head, determined to shoot himself. At that moment he heard a strange scratching sound and someone&#x27;s hand put a tiny booklet under his door. The booklet was called Afterlife. Meyrink was surprised by this dramatic coincidence and started to study the literature of the occult. He studied theosophy, Kabbala, Christian Sophiology and Eastern mysticism. Until his death Meyrink practiced yoga and other occult exercises. Results of these studies and practices are found in Meyrink&#x27;s works, which almost always deal with various occult traditions.

In 1902 Meyrink was charged with fraud. He was charged with using spiritualism in order to benefit from banking operations. Though after two months he was released from jail, his banking career was effectively ended. His jailhouse experiences are depicted in his most famous novel, &quot;The Golem&quot; (1913–14).

==Early works==

During the 1900s Meyrink started publishing satiric short stories in the magazine &quot;Simplicissimus&quot;, signing them with his mother&#x27;s surname. During spring 1903 Meyrink&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Hot Soldier and Other Stories&quot;, was published. Approximately at the same time he relocated to Vienna. Almost immediately after his arrival he published another compilation of his short stories, &quot;The Orchid. Strange stories&quot;.

On 8 May 1905 Meyrink married Philomene Bernt, whom he had known since 1896. On 16 July 1906 his daughter Sybille Felizitas was born. On 17 January 1908, two days before Meyrink&#x27;s fortieth birthday, the second son, Harro Fortunat, was born. Subsequently, the main character of the second Meyrink&#x27;s novel &quot;The Green Face&quot; was given the same name. In 1908 the third compilation of short stories, &quot;Waxworks&quot;, was published.

Being in need of money, Meyrink started working as a translator, and he became a prolific one; during five years he managed to translate into German fifteen volumes of Charles Dickens, as well as work by Rudyard Kipling and Lafcadio Hearn. He continued translating until his death, including various occult works and even the Egyptian &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;. Meyrink also edited a series of books on the occult.

In 1911 Meyrink relocated with his family to the little Bavarian town Starnberg, and in 1913 the book &quot;Des deutschen Spießers Wunderhorn&quot; (&quot;The German Philistine&#x27;s Magic Horn&quot;) was published in Munich. It was a compilation of short stories from the previous three books and several new ones; the title is a parody of &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot;. Many of these stories had satirical styles, ridiculing institutions such as the army and the church; Austrian writer Karl Kraus would later describe Meyrink&#x27;s work as combining &quot;Buddhism with a dislike for the infantry&quot;.

==Fame==

In 1915 the first and most famous of Meyrink&#x27;s novels, &quot;The Golem&quot;, was published, though its drafts may be traced back to 1908. The novel is based on the Jewish legend about a rabbi who made a living being known as a golem (גולם) out of clay and animated it with a Kabbalistic spell, although these legends have little to do with the story&#x27;s plotline. The main character is Athanasius Pernath, a contemporary lapidary from Prague. It is left to the reader to decide whether Pernath is simply writing down his hallucinations or gradually becoming a real golem. Frenschkowski describes &quot;the Golem&quot; as both &quot;a deep-footed initiatory tale and an
urban fantasy&quot;. The novel was a great commercial success. In 1916 one more compilation of short stories, &quot;Bats&quot;, and soon a second novel, &quot;The Green Face&quot;, was published. The next year his third novel, &quot;Walpurgis Night&quot;, was written. The success of these works caused Meyrink to be ranked as one of the three main German-language supernatural fiction authors (along with Hanns Heinz Ewers and Karl Hans Strobl).

Meyrink was opposed to World War I (then called the Great War), which caused him to be denounced by German nationalists; the German
&quot;Völkisch&quot; journalist Albert Zimmermann (1873-1933) described Meyrink as &quot;one of the cleverest and most dangerous opponents of the German nationalist ideal. He will influence – and corrupt – thousands upon thousands, just as Heine did&quot;. In 1916 &quot;Des deutschen Spießers Wunderhorn&quot; was banned in Austria.

By 1920 Meyrink&#x27;s financial affairs improved so that he bought a villa in Starnberg. The villa became known as &quot;The House at the Last Lantern&quot; after the name of the house from &quot;The Golem&quot;. There he and his family lived for the next eight years and two more works – &quot;The White Dominican&quot; and Meyrink&#x27;s longest novel &quot;The Angel of the West Window&quot; – were written.

In 1927 Meyrink formally converted to Mahayana Buddhism.

==Death==

During the winter of 1931, while skiing, Meyrink&#x27;s son seriously injured his backbone and for the rest of his life he was confined to his armchair. On 12 July, at the age of 24, he committed suicide – at the same age his father was going to do it. Meyrink survived his son by half a year. He died on 4 December 1932 in Starnberg, Bavaria, Germany. He is buried in Starnberg Cemetery.

==Reputation==
Frenschkowski notes &quot;like those of most other German and Austrian fantastic writers, his books were

<doc id="159901" wikidata="Q448086" url="?curid=159901" title="Jacques Herbrand">
<text>Jacques Herbrand (12 February 1908 – 27 July 1931) was a French mathematician. Although he died at age 23, he was already considered one of &quot;the greatest mathematicians of the younger generation&quot; by his professors Helmut Hasse and Richard Courant.

He worked in mathematical logic and class field theory. He introduced recursive functions. &quot;Herbrand&#x27;s theorem&quot; refers to either of two completely different theorems. One is a result from his doctoral thesis in proof theory, and the other one half of the Herbrand–Ribet theorem. The Herbrand quotient is a type of Euler characteristic, used in homological algebra. He contributed to Hilbert&#x27;s program in the foundations of mathematics by providing a constructive consistency proof for a weak system of arithmetic. The proof uses the above-mentioned, proof-theoretic Herbrand&#x27;s theorem.

==Biography==
Herbrand finished his doctorate at École Normale Supérieure in Paris under Ernest Vessiot in 1929. He joined the army in October 1929, however, and so did not defend his thesis at the Sorbonne until the following year. He was awarded a Rockefeller fellowship that enabled him to study in Germany in 1930-1931, first with John von Neumann in Berlin, then during June with Emil Artin in Hamburg, and finally with Emmy Noether in Göttingen.

In Berlin, Herbrand followed a course on Hilbert&#x27;s proof theory given by von Neumann. During the course, von Neumann explained Gödel&#x27;s first incompleteness theorem and found, independently of Gödel, the second incompleteness theorem that he also presented in the lectures. A letter of Herbrand&#x27;s of 5 December 1930 to his friend Claude Chevalley contains a description of von Neumann&#x27;s idea. An earlier letter to Vessiot, of 28 November, explained Gödel&#x27;s first incompleteness theorem in the form of failure of omega-consistency.

Herbrand&#x27;s last paper was titled &quot;Sur la non-contradiction de l&#x27;arithmétique&quot; (On the consistency of arithmetic). It contains a consistency proof for a restricted system of arithmetic, similar to a result of von Neumann&#x27;s. Herbrand had studied Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness article in Easter 1931 through the page proofs Paul Bernays had lent him. In the last section of his paper, Herbrand makes a comparison of his restricted result to that of Gödel&#x27;s. The paper was received by the editors the very same day Herbrand lost his life, 27 July, and published posthumously.

== Death ==
In July 1931, Herbrand was mountain-climbing in the French Alps with two friends when he fell to his death in the granite mountains of Massif des Écrins. 

==Quotation==
&quot;Jacques Herbrand would have hated Bourbaki&quot; said French mathematician Claude Chevalley quoted in Michèle Chouchan, &quot;Nicolas Bourbaki Faits et légendes&quot;, Éditions du choix, 1995.

Valentine) in the &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; film &quot;Seed of Chucky&quot; (2004) and second season of the television series &quot;Chucky&quot; (2022).

==Early life==
Boyd was born in Glasgow, to William and Mary Boyd, who both died a year apart when Boyd was in his early teens. He worked as a bookbinder for six years before pursuing an acting career. After graduating from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, he went on to perform with St Andrews Repertory and the Traverse Theatre.

==Career==

===Acting===
Boyd started his career appearing in &quot;Taggart&quot; (1996), &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Leap&quot; (1998), and &quot;Urban Ghost Story&quot; (1998). He also appeared in the 7:84 Theatre Company Scotland production of &quot;Caledonia Dreaming&quot; by David Greig in 1997. His breakthrough, and most notable acting role, was Peregrin &quot;Pippin&quot; Took in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, from 2001 to 2003. Boyd wrote the melody for and sang the song &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, which was featured in &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;. The song was later used over the trailer for &quot;The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies&quot; (2014), the final film in the &quot;Hobbit&quot; trilogy. Boyd also wrote and performed the song &quot;The Last Goodbye&quot;, which is played during the ending credits of the film.

In 2004, he starred as Glen and Glenda, Chucky&#x27;s (Brad Dourif) and Tiffany&#x27;s (Jennifer Tilly) offsprings in the &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; film &quot;Seed of Chucky&quot;. He has also made a cameo appearance in the popular Scottish comedy &quot;Still Game&quot; in the second episode of the first series.

As well as being a screen actor, he also appears on the stage. Boyd has been in several plays; including &quot;San Diego&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of Crazy Paola&quot;. He performed at the Dundee Repertory Theatre in the role of Davie in &quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot;, as well as in &quot;Long Hong Jimmy&quot;, in which he was the lead actor. He also starred (2007) as Richard MacDuff in the BBC Radio adaptation of the book: &quot;Dirk Gently′s Holistic Detective Agency&quot; written by Douglas Adams.

In 2011, his feature film &quot;Glenn, the Flying Robot&quot; was shown in the Dawn Breakers International Film Festival, and was followed by a Netflix release. In June 2012, he appeared on stage as the voice of the guide in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; live radio show. In 2013, Boyd played Banquo in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, at the Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe alongside Joseph Millson and Samantha Spiro.

Boyd together with fellow &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; castmates Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen, Miranda Otto, John Rhys-Davies, Andy Serkis, Liv Tyler, Karl Urban, and Elijah Wood, plus writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson on 31 May 2020 joined Josh Gad&#x27;s YouTube series &quot;Reunited Apart&quot; which reunites the cast of popular movies through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities.

In 2022, he reprised his &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; role in the second season finale of the television series &quot;Chucky&quot;, titled &quot;Chucky Actually&quot;, as a merged incarnation of Glen and Glenda Tilly, known as G.G. Valentine.

He made his stage debut in 2024 with &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; castmate Dominic Monaghan in the Canadian production of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;.

===Music===
Boyd fronts a band called Beecake. The band was named after a time when Boyd&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; co-star Dominic Monaghan sent a picture of a cake covered in bees. Other members of the band included Paul Burke, Billy Johnston, and Rick Martin.

Boyd made a guest appearance on Viggo Mortensen&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Pandemoniumfromamerica&quot;, where he played the bass on two songs, as well as drums on another.

In June 2010, Beecake released an album &quot;Soul Swimming&quot;. As well as topping some of the international MySpace charts, the band was awarded VisitScotland&#x27;s award for Best Live Act at the Tartan Clef Music Awards. The award was created by VisitScotland to celebrate Scotland&#x27;s live music scene and Glasgow&#x27;s new title of UNESCO City of Music.

Beecake released the EP &quot;Please Stay&quot; on 4 June 2012. The music video for the song &quot;Please Stay&quot; from the EP was released to coincide with the release of the EP. The song&#x27;s music video was directed by Michael Ferns, a graduate from the RSAMD where Boyd himself graduated. The group released their second album &quot;Blue Sky Paradise&quot; in December 2012. The band released a second EP titled &quot;Just B&quot; in July 2013.

In 2014, Boyd wrote and performed the song &quot;The Last Goodbye&quot;, which was played over the ending credits of the movie &quot;The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies&quot;.

==Personal life==
Boyd is an avid surfer and spent his free time surfing in New Zealand during the production for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. He also holds a Grade 7 in foil fencing. He trained in martial arts at the Krauseworld Academy in Glasgow under brothers Steve Krause and Mike Krause where he achieved Phase 4 rank in both Jeet Kune Do and Filipino Kali. He topped a list of the 100 Most Eligible Men in Scotland in 2002.

He owns a house in Glasgow with his wife, Alison McKinnon. The couple had their first child, a boy named Jack William Boyd, on 26 April 2006. He and McKinnon were married in a ceremony with 30 guests at Òran Mór in Glasgow&#x27;s West End on 29 December 2010. The wedding was attended by castmates Elijah Wood and Dominic Monaghan. A reception was held afterwards for about 130 guests.

Boyd has a tattoo of the Elvish word for &quot;nine&quot; written with the Tengwar script, a reference to his involvement in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and the fact that his character was one of the nine members of the &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. The other actors of &quot;The Fellowship&quot; (Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen, and Orlando Bloom) got the same tattoo with the exception of John Rhys-Davies whose stunt double got the tattoo instead.

He remains close with &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; co-star Dominic Monaghan. Monaghan revealed in an interview for the national breakfast television show &quot;GMTV&quot; that he continues to see Boyd on a regular basis, as he is &quot;essentially, kind of, godfather to his kid.&quot; Boyd and Monaghan co-host the podcast ‘The Friendship Onionʼ together.

Boyd is one of the patrons of Scottish Youth Theatre, Scotland&#x27;s National Theatre &quot;for and by&quot; young people. He is also the patron of the National Boys&#x27; Choir of Scotland.

===Holidays in Scotland===
In 2008, Boyd fronted VisitScotland&#x27;s Perfect Day Campaign, and talked of his love of surfing in Scotland, particularly in Machrihanish near the town of Campbeltown in Kintyre in the west coast of Scotland, and Pease Bay and Coldingham Bay on Scotland&#x27;s east coast. In an interview about the campaign with &quot;The Scotsman&quot; on 28 July 2008, he said: &quot;I don&#x27;t really do much promotional stuff but felt that with this one I could be honest... I&#x27;m very proud of where I come from and I get very excited if a friend comes over and I can show them around.&quot;

<doc id="159908" wikidata="Q18670161" url="?curid=159908" title="Mascot">
<text>A mascot is any human, animal, or object thought to bring luck, or anything used to represent a group with a common public identity, such as a school, sports team, society, military unit, or brand name. Mascots are also used as fictional, representative spokespeople for consumer products.

In sports, mascots are also used for merchandising. Team mascots are often related to their respective team nicknames. This is especially true when the team&#x27;s nickname is something that is a living animal and/or can be made to have humanlike characteristics. For more abstract nicknames, the team may opt to have an unrelated character serve as the mascot. For example, the athletic teams of the University of Alabama are nicknamed the Crimson Tide, while their mascot is an elephant named Big Al. Team mascots may take the form of a logo, person, live animal, inanimate object, or a costumed character, and often appear at team matches and other related events. Since the mid-20th century, costumed characters have provided teams with an opportunity to choose a fantasy creature as their mascot, as is the case with the Philadelphia Phillies&#x27; mascot: Phillie Phanatic, the Philadelphia Flyers&#x27; mascot: Gritty, the Seattle Kraken mascot: Buoy, and the Washington Commanders&#x27; mascot: Major Tuddy.

Costumed mascots are commonplace, and are regularly used as goodwill ambassadors in the community for their team, company, or organization.

==History==
It was sports organizations that initially first thought of using animals as a form of mascot to bring entertainment and excitement for their spectators. Before mascots were fictional icons or people in suits, animals were mostly used in order to bring a somewhat different feel to the game and to strike fear upon the rivalry teams.

As time went on, mascots evolved from predatory animals, to two-dimensional fantasy mascots, to finally what we know today, three-dimensional mascots. Stylistic changes in American puppetry in the mid-20th century, including the work of Jim Henson and Sid and Marty Krofft, soon were adapted to sports mascots. It allowed people to not only have visual enjoyment but also interact physically with the mascots.

Marketers quickly realized the great potential in three-dimensional mascots and took on board the costumed puppet idea. This change encouraged other companies to start creating their own mascots, resulting in mascots being a necessity amongst not only the sporting industry but for other organisations.

==Etymology==
The word &#x27;mascot&#x27; originates from the French term &#x27;mascotte&#x27; which means lucky charm. This was used to describe anything that brought luck to a household. The word was first recorded in 1867 and popularised by a French composer Edmond Audran who wrote the opera &quot;La mascotte&quot;, performed in December 1880. The word entered the English language in 1881 with the meaning of a specific living entity associated with a human organization as a symbol or live logo. However, before this, the terms were familiar to the people of France as a slang word used by gamblers. The term is a derivative of the word &#x27;masco&#x27; meaning sorceress or witch. Before the 19th century, the word &#x27;mascot&#x27; was associated with inanimate objects that would be commonly seen such as a lock of hair or a figurehead on a sailing ship. From then to the twentieth century, the term has been used in reference to any good luck animals, objects etc., and more recently including human caricatures and fictional creatures created as logos for sports teams.

==Choices and identities==

Often, the choice of the mascot reflects the desired quality; a typical example of this is the &quot;fighting spirit,&quot; in which a competitive nature is personified by warriors or predatory animals.

Mascots may also symbolize a local or regional trait, such as the Nebraska Cornhuskers&#x27; mascot, Herbie Husker: a stylized version of a farmer, owing to the agricultural traditions of the area in which the university is located. Similarly, Pittsburg State University uses Gus the Gorilla as its mascot, &quot;gorilla&quot; being an old colloquial term for coal miners in the Southeast Kansas area in which the university was established.

In the United States, controversy surrounds some mascot choices, especially those using human likenesses. Mascots based on Native American tribes are particularly contentious, as many argue that they constitute offensive exploitations of an oppressed culture. However, several Indian tribes have come out in support of keeping the names. For example, the Utah Utes and the Central Michigan Chippewas are sanctioned by local tribes, and the Florida State Seminoles are supported by the Seminole Tribe of Florida in their use of Osceola and Renegade as symbols. FSU chooses not to refer to them as mascots because of the offensive connotation. This has not, however, prevented fans from engaging in &quot;Redface&quot;—dressing up in stereotypical, Plains Indian outfits during games, or creating offensive banners saying &quot;Scalp &#x27;em&quot; as was seen at the 2014 Rose Bowl.

Some sports teams have &quot;unofficial&quot; mascots: individual supporters or fans that have become identified with the team. The New York Yankees have such an individual in fan Freddy Sez. Former Toronto Blue Jays mascot BJ Birdie was a costumed character created by a Blue Jays fan, ultimately hired by the team to perform at their home games. USC Trojans mascot is Tommy Trojan who rides on his horse (and the official mascot of the school) Traveler.

==Sports mascots==
Many sports teams in the United States have official mascots, sometimes enacted by costumed humans or even live animals. One of the earliest was a taxidermy mount for the Chicago Cubs, in 1908, and later a live animal used in 1916 by the same team. They abandoned the concept shortly thereafter and remained without an official &quot;cub&quot; until 2014, when they introduced a version that was a person wearing a costume.

In the United Kingdom, some teams have young fans become &quot;mascots&quot;. These representatives sometimes have medical issues, and the appearance is a wish grant, the winner of a contest, or under other circumstances. Mascots also include older people such as Mr England, who are invited by national sports associations to be mascots for the representative teams. One of the earliest was Ken Baily, whose John Bull-inspired appearance was a regular at England matches from 1963 to 1990.

===Controversies===

On October 28, 1989, University of Miami mascot Sebastian the Ibis was tackled by a group of police officers for attempting to put out Chief Osceola&#x27;s flaming spear prior to Miami&#x27;s game against long-standing rival Florida State at Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee. Sebastian was wearing a fireman’s helmet and yellow raincoat and holding a fire extinguisher. When a police officer attempted to grab the fire extinguisher, the officer was sprayed in the chest. Sebastian was handcuffed by four officers but ultimately released. 

University of Miami quarterback Gino Torretta told ESPN, &quot;Even if we weren&#x27;t bad boys, it added to the mystique that, &#x27;Man, look, even their mascot&#x27;s getting arrested.&#x27;&quot;

As of 2024, five high schools in the United States use midgets for their mascots. Advocates working with Little People of America have been campaigning to change it because of its common usage as a pejorative slur against disabled people.

==Corporate mascots==
Mascots or advertising characters are very common in the corporate world. Recognizable mascots include Chester Cheetah, Sonic the Hedgehog (character), Keebler Elf, the Fruit of the Loom Guys, Mickey Mouse, Pizza Pizza Guy for Little Caesars, Rocky the Elf, Pepsiman and the NBC Peacock. These characters are typically known without even having to refer to the company or brand. This is an example of corporate branding, and soft selling a company. Mascots are able to act as brand ambassadors where advertising is not allowed. For example, many corporate mascots can attend non-profit events, or sports and promote their brand while entertaining the crowd. Some mascots are simply cartoons or virtual mascots, others are characters in commercials, and others are actually created as costumes and will appear in person in front of the public at tradeshows or events.

==School mascots==

American high schools, colleges, and even middle and elementary schools typically have mascots. Many college and university mascots started out as live animals, such as bulldogs and bears that attended sporting events. Today, mascots are usually represented by animated characters, campus sculptures, and costumed students who attend sporting events, alumni gatherings, and other campus events.

==International mascots – Olympics and World Expositions==
The mascots that are used for the Summer and Winter Olympic games are fictional characters, typically a human figure or an animal native to the country to which is holding that year&#x27;s Olympic Games. The mascots are used to entice an audience and bring joy and excitement to the Olympics festivities. Likewise, many World expositions since 1984 have had mascots representing their host city in some way, starting with the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition&#x27;s mascot Seymore D. Fair.

Since 1968, nearly all of the cities that have hosted the Summer or Winter Olympic Games have designed and promoted a mascot that relates to the culture of the host country the overall &quot;brand&quot; of that year&#x27;s Games. Recent Winter/Summer Olympic games mascots include Miga, Quatchi, Mukmuk (Vancouver, 2010), Wenlock and Mandeville (London, 2012), Bely Mishka, Snow Leopard, Zaika (Sochi, 2014) and Vinicius and Tom (Rio, 2016) have all gone on to become iconic symbols in their respective countries. Since 2010, it has been common for the Olympic and Paralympic games to each have their own mascots, which are presented together. For example, the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo is represented by Miraitowa, while the 2020 Summer Paralympics are represented by Someity, and the two often appear together in promotional materials.

==Government mascots==
===Yuru-chara===

In Japan, many municipalities have mascots, which are known as Yuru-chara (Japanese: ゆるキャラ Hepburn: yuru kyara). Yuru-chara is also used to refer to mascots created by businesses to promote their products.

===NASA mascot===
Camilla Corona SDO is the mission mascot for NASA&#x27;s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and assists the mission with Education and Public Outreach (EPO).

===Military mascots===

Mascots are also popular in military units. For example, the United States Marine Corps uses the English Bulldog as its mascot, while the United States Army uses the mule, the United States Navy uses the goat, and the United States Air Force uses the Gyrfalcon.

The goat in the Royal Welsh is officially not a mascot but a ranking soldier. Lance Corporal William Windsor retired on 20 May 2009, and his replacement &quot;William Windsor II&quot; was captured and formally recruited on June 15 that same year. Several regiments of the British Army have a live animal mascot which appear on parades. The Parachute Regiment and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders have a Shetland pony as their mascot, a ram for The Mercian Regiment; an Irish Wolfhound for the Irish Guards and the Royal Irish Regiment; a drum horse for the Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars and the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards; an antelope for the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers; and a goat for the Royal Welsh. Other British military mascots include a Staffordshire Bull Terrier and a pair of ferrets.

The Norwegian Royal Guard adopted a king penguin named Nils Olav as its mascot on the occasion of a visit to Edinburgh by its regimental band. The (very large) penguin remains resident at Edinburgh Zoo and has been formally promoted by one rank on the occasion of each subsequent visit to Britain by the band or other detachments of the Guard. Regimental Sergeant Major Olav was awarded the Norwegian Army&#x27;s Long Service and Good Conduct medal at a ceremony in 2005.

===Smokey Bear===

The U.S. Forest Service uses mascot Smokey Bear to raise awareness and educate the public about the dangers of unplanned human-caused wildfires.

==In music==

Some bands, particularly in the heavy metal genre, use band mascots to promote their music. The mascots are usually found on album covers or merchandise such as band T-shirts, but can also make appearances in live shows or music videos. One example of a band mascot is Eddie of the English heavy metal band Iron Maiden. Eddie is a zombie-like creature which is personified in different forms on all of the band&#x27;s albums, most of its singles and some of its promotional merchandise. Eddie is also known to make live appearances, especially during the song &quot;Iron Maiden&quot;.

Another notable example of a mascot in music is Skeleton Sam of The Grateful Dead. South Korean hip hop band B.A.P uses rabbits named Matoki as their mascot, each bunny a different color representing each member. Although rabbits have an innocent image, BAP gives off a tough image. Hip hop artist Kanye West used to use a teddy bear named Dropout Bear as his mascot; Dropout Bear has appeared on the cover of West&#x27;s first three studio albums, and served as the main character of West&#x27;s music video, &quot;Good Morning&quot;.

The question of whether a &quot;hype-man&quot; can legitimately be considered a hip-hop organization&#x27;s mascot is currently an active subject of debate within academic Hip-Hop circles. However, local polling in relevant regions suggests acceptance of the &quot;hype-man&quot; as a legitimate organizational mascot.

==In television==
Some television series have mascots, like the Cleatus the Robot animated cartoon figure on the U.S. sports television show &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot;.

Another example of a cartoon mascot on television is the Sir Seven knight character on Wisconsin&#x27;s WSAW-TV.

<doc id="159909" wikidata="Q3066682" url="?curid=159909" title="Max Gaines">
<text>Maxwell Charles Gaines (born Max Ginzberg, September 21, 1894 – August 20, 1947) was an American publisher and a pioneering figure in the creation of the modern comic book.

In 1933, Gaines devised the first four-color, saddle-stitched newsprint pamphlet (&quot;Funnies on Parade&quot;), a precursor to the color-comics format that became the standard for the American comic book industry. He was co-publisher of All-American Publications, a seminal comic-book company that introduced such enduring fictional characters as Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and Hawkman. He went on to found Educational Comics, producing the series &quot;Picture Stories from the Bible&quot;. He authored one of the earliest essays on comic books, a 1942 pamphlet titled &quot;Narrative Illustration, The Story of the Comics.&quot;

After Gaines&#x27; death in 1947, Educational Comics was taken over by his son Bill Gaines, who transformed the company (now known as EC Comics) into a pioneer of horror, science fiction, and satirical comics.

==Early life==
Max Ginzberg was born in New York City to a Jewish family. Maxwell Charles Gaines was described as a &quot;hard-nosed, pain-wracked, loud aggressive man&quot;. At age four, Gaines had leaned out too far from a second story window and fell to the ground, catching his leg on a picket fence. The leg would give him pain and discomfort for the rest of his life, aggravating his disposition. As an adult he developed a vicious temper, and according to his son, William M. Gaines, &quot;expected the worst from his son and was rarely disappointed.&quot; Gaines continually reinforced this belief by venting his frustrations on the boy, beating him savagely with a leather belt while shouting, &quot;You&#x27;ll never amount to anything!&quot;.

==Career==
Gaines had been a teacher, an elementary school principal, a munitions factory worker, and a haberdasher. In 1933 he had begun a new job as a salesperson at Eastern Color Printing, which printed Sunday newspaper comic strips. Deducing that packaging such strips together could create promotional publications, Gaines contacted Harry L. Wildenberg, Eastern&#x27;s sales manager and his direct superior. The two needed promotional ideas for a client, Procter &amp; Gamble, and suggested to the company a tabloid-sized book of color comic-strip reprints available for five cents and a label or coupon from any Procter &amp; Gamble product. The company, however, rejected the idea. Undaunted, and with Wildenberg&#x27;s blessing, Gaines produced &quot;Funnies on Parade&quot;, an eight-page newsprint magazine reprinting several comic strips licensed from the McNaught Syndicate and the McClure Syndicate. These included such popular strips as cartoonist Al Smith&#x27;s &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot;, Ham Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Joe Palooka&quot;, and Percy Crosby&#x27;s &quot;Skippy&quot;. This periodical, however, was neither sold nor available on newsstands, but rather sent free as a promotional item to consumers who mailed in coupons clipped from Procter &amp; Gamble soap and toiletries products. Ten-thousand copies were made. The promotion proved a success, and Eastern Color that year produced similar periodicals for Canada Dry soft drinks, Kinney Shoes, Wheatena cereal, Phillips&#x27; Dental Magnesia, John Wanamaker Department Stores, and others, with print runs of from 100,000 to 250,000.

Later in 1933, Gaines collaborated with Dell Publishing to publish the 36-page one-shot &quot;Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics&quot;, followed in 1934 by &quot;Famous Funnies&quot;, which ran for 218 issues and is considered the first true American comic book. After he quit Eastern Color, he joined McClure Newspaper Syndicate as company manager, and eventually partnered with Dell Comics to produce three of the comic books &quot;The Funnies&quot;, &quot;Popular Comics&quot; and &quot;The Comics&quot; whereas Dell financed Gaines of its three comic book titles, until Dell became associated with Western Publishing in 1938.

===All-American Publications===
In 1938, Gaines and Jack Liebowitz began publishing comics with original material under the name &quot;All-American Publications&quot;. At the time, Liebowitz was the co-owner with Harry Donenfeld of National Allied Publications, the precursor company to DC Comics, and Donenfeld financed Gaines&#x27; creation of All-American. All-American published several superhero/adventure anthologies such as &quot;All-American Comics&quot; and &quot;Flash Comics&quot;, as well as other titles. For a time, All-American and National shared marketing and promotional efforts as well as characters. Several of National&#x27;s characters (Starman, Doctor Fate, The Spectre) appeared alongside All-American&#x27;s Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and Hawkman in that company&#x27;s successful &quot;All Star Comics&quot;.

Gaines&#x27; relationship with Donenfeld and National waxed and waned over the years. By the early 1940s, the All-American titles were branded separately and no longer featured National-owned characters. In 1944, Donenfeld bought out Gaines and merged National and All-American into a single company.

===EC Comics===
Gaines used the proceeds from the sale of All-American to establish another comics line, Educational Comics. EC Comics continued All-American&#x27;s &quot;Picture Stories from the Bible&quot; and added new titles such as &quot;Picture Stories from American History&quot;. Gaines soon expanded the line with humor and talking animal books such as &quot;Land of the Lost&quot;, &quot;Animal Fables&quot;, and Ed Wheelan&#x27;s &quot;Fat and Slat&quot;. Some of these books carried a slightly revised publisher logo which changed the &quot;Educational&quot; in EC to display the Entertaining Comics insignia.

==Death and legacy==
On August 20, 1947, at Lake Placid, New York, Gaines, his friend Sam Irwin, and the latter&#x27;s 8-year-old son William Irwin were aboard a motorboat when it was struck by another boat. Gaines and the elder Irwin died in the accident.

Max Gaines&#x27; 25-year-old son, William Gaines, inherited EC and changed the direction of the company.

Although it continued to advertise and sell back issues of the Educational titles, Bill Gaines concentrated on adding new titles to the Entertaining Comics line. He replaced the juvenile humor books with titles pitched to an older audience and strongly influenced by his own love of popular culture. These spanned several genres as he made a transition from romance (&quot;Modern Love&quot;) and Westerns (&quot;Gunslingers&quot;) to science fiction (&quot;Weird Science&quot;), horror (&quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;), and satire (Harvey Kurtzman&#x27;s &quot;Mad&quot;).

In 1985, Max Gaines was posthumously named as one of the honorees by DC Comics in the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot;.

<doc id="159915" wikidata="Q332377" url="?curid=159915" title="John Smith (Labour Party leader)">
<text>John Smith (13 September 1938 – 12 May 1994) was a Scottish politician who was Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Labour Party from July 1992 until his death in May 1994. He was also Member of Parliament (MP) for Monklands East.

Smith first entered Parliament in 1970 and, following junior ministerial roles as Minister of State for Energy (1975–1976) and Minister of State for the Privy Council Office (1976–1978), he entered the Cabinet towards the end of James Callaghan&#x27;s tenure as Prime Minister, as Secretary of State for Trade and President of the Board of Trade (1978–1979). During Labour&#x27;s time in Opposition to Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Conservative government, he rose through the Shadow Cabinet, as Shadow Secretary of State for Trade (1979–1982), Energy (1982–1983), Employment (1983–1984), Trade and Industry (1984–1987) and Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer (1987–1992).

After Labour leader Neil Kinnock resigned following the Party&#x27;s surprise loss in the 1992 general election to new Conservative leader John Major, Smith was elected his successor in July 1992. He continued Kinnock&#x27;s moves to reform Labour, abolishing the trade union block vote at Labour Party Conferences and replacing it with &quot;one member, one vote&quot; at the 1993 party conference. However, his overall cautious approach to reform, which was dubbed &quot;one more heave&quot;, sought to avoid controversy and win the next election by capitalising on the unpopularity of the Conservative government. This frustrated Tony Blair and Gordon Brown as well as Peter Mandelson. Following Smith&#x27;s sudden death in May 1994, he was succeeded as leader by Blair, who led the party to victory at the next general election in 1997.

== Early life ==

Smith was born at Baddarroch, Dalmally, Argyll, the eldest of three children of Sarah Cameron, née Scott (29 July 1910 – 11 January 1997), and Archibald Leitch Smith (18 June 1907 – 1981). At the time of Smith&#x27;s birth, his father was schoolmaster at Portnahaven, Islay; however, two years later he became the headmaster of the primary school at Ardrishaig, Argyll, which Smith went on to attend. From September 1952, Smith attended Dunoon Grammar School, lodging in the town with a landlady and going home during the school holidays, before enrolling at the University of Glasgow. He studied History from 1956 to 1959, and then Law. He joined the Labour Party in 1955.

Smith became involved in debating with the Glasgow University Dialectic Society and the Glasgow University Union, and in 1962 won &quot;The Observer&quot; Mace debating competition, speaking with Gordon Hunter. In 1995, after his death, the competition was renamed the John Smith Memorial Mace in his honour.

In 1963, he became a solicitor and then in 1967, an advocate at the Scottish bar, supplementing his income by working as a libel lawyer for the &quot;Daily Record&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Mail&quot;.

== Member of Parliament ==
Smith first stood as a Labour parliamentary candidate aged 23 at a by-election in 1961 in the East Fife constituency; he contested that seat again in the 1964 general election. As it was a safe seat for the Unionist Party (who at the time ran in place of the Conservatives), Smith came second by some distance on both occasions. At the 1970 general election he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for North Lanarkshire, succeeding Peggy Herbison. Smith made his maiden speech on 10 November 1970, opposing the Conservative government&#x27;s Family Income Supplements Act 1970. On 28 October 1971, Smith defied the Labour whips in joining Labour MPs led by Roy Jenkins to vote in favour of entry to the European Communities. These included Roy Hattersley, Shirley Williams, Bill Rodgers and David Owen, with all of whom he was later to sit in the Callaghan cabinet.

=== In government ===
In February 1974, Smith declined Harold Wilson&#x27;s offer of the office of Solicitor General for Scotland, not wishing his political career to become side-lined as a law officer. In October, he was made an Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Energy. In December 1975, he was made a Minister of State. Smith supported James Callaghan in the Labour Party leadership election after Wilson resigned in April 1976. When Callaghan became Prime Minister, Smith became a Minister of State at the Privy Council Office, serving with Labour&#x27;s Deputy leader, Michael Foot, the Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons. In this position, Smith piloted the highly controversial devolution proposals for Scotland and Wales through the House of Commons. Smith&#x27;s adroit handling of these proposals impressed Callaghan, and in November 1978, when Edmund Dell retired, Callaghan appointed Smith Secretary of State for Trade. In this post, Smith was the youngest member of the cabinet, and served there until the 1979 general election.

=== Shadow Cabinet ===
Smith was voted to the Shadow Cabinet in the elections of June 1979 and would be re-elected every year until 1992. Smith became Shadow Energy Secretary. In the Labour leadership election of November 1980, Smith voted for Denis Healey over Michael Foot. Smith remained in the Labour Party after figures on the right of the party formed the breakaway Social Democratic Party, remarking: &quot;I am comfortable with the unions. They aren&#x27;t. That&#x27;s the big difference&quot;. Smith voted for Healey in the deputy leadership election of September 1981.

He became a QC in 1983, the same year that his constituency became Monklands East. During the 1983 general election, Smith concentrated on unemployment, arguing that the Conservatives had caused deindustrialisation and that a Labour government would increase investment, and therefore employment. Smith received over 50 per cent of the vote in Monklands East, but Labour lost badly nationally. Smith then acted as Roy Hattersley&#x27;s campaign manager in the leadership election and the deputy leadership election. After serving a year as Shadow Employment Secretary, Smith was Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry between late 1984 and 1987.

=== Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer ===
Smith was appointed Shadow Chancellor by Neil Kinnock in July 1987 following the Labour Party&#x27;s general election defeat. Despite a quiet, modest manner and his politically moderate stance, he was a witty, often scathing speaker. Smith was named as Parliamentarian of the Year twice: first in November 1986 for his performances during the Westland controversy during which Leon Brittan resigned, and the second time in November 1989 for taking Nigel Lawson to task over the state of the economy and over his difficult relationship with Sir Alan Walters, the Prime Minister&#x27;s economic adviser. Smith made two notably witty attacks on Lawson that year. On 7 June 1989, he sang the theme tune for the soap &quot;Neighbours&quot; at the dispatch box, lampooning the differences between Lawson and Walters, who was critical of Lawson&#x27;s policies but whom Thatcher refused to sack. Then, on 24 October, he made another scathing attack on the differences. Two days later, Lawson resigned, followed shortly afterwards by Walters.

=== First heart attack ===
Smith suffered a heart attack on 9 October 1988, and was forced to spend three months away from Westminster to recover. On that occasion, he had complained of chest pains the night before and had to be persuaded to cancel a flight to London so he could go to hospital for a check-up. He was examined at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary by an ECG. The doctor who examined him said, &quot;Whatever it is, we don&#x27;t think it is your heart&quot;. Then, Smith suddenly collapsed and was briefly unconscious before coming around. He spent three days in intensive care before leaving hospital on 20 October 1988 and made a full recovery.

Smith made modifications to his lifestyle by going on a diet of 1,000 calories, cutting down on rich foods and fine wines, giving up smoking and taking up Munro bagging. By the time of his death, he had succeeded in climbing 108 of the 277 Scottish Munros (mountains over 3,000 feet above sea level at the summit). His weight dropped from at the time of the first heart attack, to when he returned to Parliament on 23 January 1989.

=== Leader of the Opposition ===

Following Labour&#x27;s fourth consecutive defeat at the general election of April 1992, Neil Kinnock resigned as leader and Smith was elected Labour leader.

Although Labour had now been out of power for 13 years, their performance in the 1992 election had been much better than in the previous three. They had cut the Conservative majority from 102 seats to 21, and for most of the three years leading up to the election, opinion polls had indicated that Labour were more likely to win the election than the Conservatives. The resignation of long-serving but increasingly unpopular Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher, and the well-received election of John Major as her successor, had seen the comfortable Labour lead in the opinion polls wiped out and in the 17 months leading up to the election, its outcome had become much harder to predict. Much of the blame had been placed on Labour&#x27;s &quot;shadow budget&quot; drawn up by Smith, which included raising the top rate of income tax from 40p in the pound to 50p, and the Conservative election campaign was centred on warning voters that they would face higher taxes under a Labour government.

In September 1992, Smith made his maiden Commons speech as party leader, in which he attacked the government&#x27;s ERM debacle eight days earlier – an event which was seen by many observers as playing a large part in determining the outcome of the next general election, long before it was even on the political horizon, as from that point onwards the Labour Party was ascendant in the opinion polls, winning several seats from the Conservatives in by-elections (eventually even attracting a Conservative MP to defect to Labour) and trouncing them in local council elections.

In this speech, he referred to John Major as &quot;the devalued Prime Minister of a devalued Government&quot;. At Labour&#x27;s party conference, Smith branded Major and Norman Lamont the &quot;Laurel and Hardy of British politics&quot;. This echoed his attacks on Major&#x27;s government made before the 1992 election (while he was still shadow chancellor), most memorably when he labelled &quot;irresponsible&quot; Conservative plans for cutting income tax to 20 per cent, and joked at a Labour Party rally in Sheffield that the Conservatives would have a box-office disaster with &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Economy&quot; – in reference to the recent Disney motion picture &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; – mocking the recession which was plaguing the British economy at the time.

In a June 1993 debate, Smith again savaged the Conservative government, saying that under John Major&#x27;s premiership, &quot;the man with the non-Midas touch is in charge. It is no wonder that we live in a country where the Grand National does not start and hotels fall into the sea&quot; (in reference to the 1993 Grand National, which was cancelled after a false start, and to Holbeck Hall Hotel in Scarborough, which had recently collapsed off a cliff).

During the same debate, Smith commented on a recent government defeat in the Newbury by-election to the Liberal Democrats, a poor showing in the local elections and a subsequent Cabinet reshuffle by saying that &quot;if we were to offer that tale of events to the BBC Light Entertainment Department as a script for a programme, I think that the producers of &quot;Yes Minister&quot; would have turned it down as hopelessly over the top. It might have even been too much for &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot;&quot;. In the same speech, Smith also attacked the Conservatives&#x27; broken election promises (in particular Lamont&#x27;s recent Budget decision to impose VAT on domestic energy bills) – claiming he possessed the last copy of a 1992 policy document &quot;to escape the Central Office shredder&quot;. He also performed very well in the July 1993 motion of confidence debate on the Conservative government.

Despite his dispatch box successes (Smith was always more effective in the House of Commons than on platforms or at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, though he began to improve at the latter towards the end of his life), Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were, under Smith&#x27;s leadership, restless and privately anxious that the party had adopted a &quot;One more heave&quot; approach and had become over-cautious in tackling the legacy of &quot;tax and spend&quot;.

Despite this, during his time as leader of the Labour Party, Smith abolished the trade union block vote at Labour Party Conferences and replaced it with &quot;One member, one vote&quot; at the 1993 party conference. He also committed a future Labour government to establishing a Scottish Parliament, an aim fulfilled by his successors following his death (most notably his close friend Donald Dewar). Smith was also a committed British Unionist. During Smith&#x27;s tenure as leader the Labour Party gained a significant lead in the polls over the Conservatives; on 5 May 1994, one week before Smith&#x27;s death, the Conservatives suffered a major defeat in the British council elections, their worst in over 30 years. This happened in spite of the strong economic recovery and reduction of unemployment which had followed the declaration of the recession&#x27;s end in April 1993. In May 1994, a poll estimated that the Labour Party was on average 23 points ahead of the Conservative Party.

==Death==

On the evening of 11 May 1994, with around 500 people present, Smith made a speech at a fundraising dinner at Park Lane Hotel, London, saying &quot;The opportunity to serve our country—that is all we ask&quot;. At 8:05am the following morning, whilst in his Barbican flat, Smith suffered a fatal heart attack. His wife phoned an ambulance and he was taken to St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital where he died at 9:15am, having never regained consciousness. On 28 April, a fortnight before his death, Smith had visited the same accident and emergency department to campaign against its proposed closure; it had also been the subject of his questions at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions later that day.
The doctor who had served as his tour guide, Professor Mike Besser, tried unsuccessfully to save Smith&#x27;s life.

In response to his death, the Speaker of the House of Commons Betty Boothroyd recalled Parliament to give MPs the opportunity to pay tribute to him. Prime Minister John Major was the first who paid tribute, including the line that he and Smith &quot;would share a drink: sometimes tea, sometimes not tea&quot;. It was reported that there was weeping in the chamber. MPs from across the house also paid tribute to him, including Margaret Beckett, Paddy Ashdown, Neil Kinnock and Dennis Skinner.

On the day of his death, the &quot;BBC Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; was extended to an hour as opposed to the usual half-hour. This replaced the medical drama which was due to follow at 9:30, coincidentally entitled &quot;Cardiac Arrest&quot;. During &quot;Question Time&quot; that evening, panellists paid tribute to Smith instead of debating. George Robertson and Menzies Campbell were among the participants.

On 20 May 1994, following a public funeral service in Cluny Parish Church, Edinburgh, which was attended by almost 1,000 people, Smith was buried in a private family service on the island of Iona, at the sacred burial ground of Reilig Odhráin, where many early Scottish and Norse kings are said to be buried. His grave is marked with an epitaph quoting the Fourth Epistle of &quot;An Essay on Man&quot; by Alexander Pope: &quot;An honest man&#x27;s the noblest work of God&quot;. His close friend Donald Dewar acted as one of Smith&#x27;s pallbearers. On 14 July 1994, a memorial service for Smith took place at Westminster Abbey and was attended by over 2,000 people. The Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, gave an address.

=== Aftermath in the Labour Party ===
Following Smith&#x27;s death, the Labour Party renamed its Walworth Road headquarters John Smith House in his memory. Tony Blair, Smith&#x27;s successor as Leader of the Labour Party, was an effective campaigner who capitalised on public mistrust of the Conservative Party to win a landslide victory at the 1997 general election. 

Smith&#x27;s biographer, Mark Stuart, said that Smith could have won Labour a victory on a scale similar to that achieved by Blair because of the combination of the Black Wednesday debacle and internal Conservative Party divisions over Europe since 1992; estimating that, in the absence of the &quot;Blair effect&quot;, the Conservative Party would have held slightly over 200 seats (rather than the 165 it actually won) in the House of Commons, leaving the Conservatives in a position similar to that of Labour following the 1983 general election.

== Personal life ==
Smith was married to Elizabeth Bennett from 5 July 1967 until his death. Elizabeth Smith was created Baroness Smith of Gilmorehill in 1995. They had three daughters including Sarah Smith and Catherine Smith.

<doc id="159917" wikidata="Q449791" url="?curid=159917" title="Clarence Darrow">
<text>Clarence Seward Darrow (; April 18, 1857 – March 13, 1938) was an American lawyer who became famous in the 19th century for high profile representations of trade union causes, and in the 20th century for several criminal matters, including the Leopold and Loeb murder trial, the Scopes &quot;monkey&quot; trial, and the Ossian Sweet defense. He was a leading member of the American Civil Liberties Union and a prominent advocate for Georgist economic reform. Darrow was also well known as a public speaker, debater, and writer.

Darrow is considered by some legal analysts and lawyers to be the greatest lawyer of the 20th century. He was posthumously inducted into the Trial Lawyer Hall of Fame. Called a &quot;sophisticated country lawyer&quot;, Darrow&#x27;s wit and eloquence made him one of the most prominent attorneys and civil libertarians in the nation.

==Early life==
Clarence Darrow was born in the small town of Farmdale, Ohio, on April 18, 1857, the fifth son of Amirus and Emily Darrow (née Eddy), but grew up in nearby Kinsman, Ohio. Both the Darrow and Eddy families had deep roots in colonial New England, and several of Darrow&#x27;s ancestors served in the American Revolution. Darrow&#x27;s father was an ardent abolitionist and a proud iconoclast and religious freethinker. He was known throughout the town as the &quot;village infidel&quot;. Emily Darrow was an early supporter of female suffrage and a women&#x27;s rights advocate.

The young Clarence attended Allegheny College and the University of Michigan Law School, but did not graduate from either institution. He attended Allegheny College for only one year before the Panic of 1873 struck, and Darrow was determined not to be a financial burden to his father any longer. Over the next three years he taught in the winter at the district school in a country community.

While teaching, Darrow started to study the law on his own, and by the end of his third year of teaching, his family urged him to enter the law department at Ann Arbor. Darrow studied there for only a year when he decided that it would be much more cost-effective to read law in an actual law office. When he felt that he was ready, he took the Ohio bar exam and passed. He was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1878. The Clarence Darrow Octagon House, his childhood home in Kinsman, contains a memorial to him.

===Marriages and child===
Darrow married Jessie Ohl in April 1880. They had one child, Paul Edward Darrow, in 1883. They were divorced in 1897. Darrow married Ruby Hammerstrom, a journalist 16 years his junior, in 1903. They had no children.

==Legal career==

Following his departure from the University of Michigan Law School in late 1879 Darrow moved to the small village of Harvard, Illinois, with his classmate L.H. Stafford, who was from Harvard. It is in the McHenry County Courthouse that Darrow successfully tried one of his first cases in January 1880. Soon after Darrow decided to return to Ohio and opened a law office in Andover, Ohio, a small farming town just from Kinsman. Having little experience, he started off slowly and gradually building up his career by dealing with the everyday complaints and problems of a farming community. After two years Darrow felt he was ready to take on new and different cases and moved his practice to Ashtabula, Ohio, which had a population of 5,000 people and was the largest city in the county. There he became involved in Democratic Party politics and served as the town counsel.

In 1880, he married Jessie Ohl, and eight years later he moved to Chicago with his wife and young son, Paul. He did not have much business when he first moved to Chicago, and spent as little as possible. He joined the Henry George Club and made some friends and connections in the city. Being part of the club also gave him an opportunity to speak for the Democratic Party on the upcoming election. He slowly made a name for himself through these speeches, eventually earning the standing to speak in whatever hall he liked. He was offered work as an attorney for the city of Chicago. Darrow worked in the city law department for two years when he resigned and took a position as a lawyer at the Chicago and North-Western Railway Companyin 1891. In 1894, Darrow represented Eugene V. Debs, the leader of the American Railway Union, who was prosecuted by the federal government for leading the Pullman Strike of 1894. Darrow severed his ties with the railroad to represent Debs, making a financial sacrifice. He saved Debs in one trial but could not keep him from being jailed in another.

Also in 1894, Darrow took on the first murder case of his career, defending Patrick Eugene Prendergast, the &quot;mentally deranged drifter&quot; who had confessed to murdering Chicago mayor Carter Harrison III Darrow&#x27;s insanity defense of Prendergast failed and he was executed. Among fifty defenses in murder cases in Darrow&#x27;s career, the Prendergast case was the only one that resulted in an execution, though Darrow did not join the defense team until after Prendergast&#x27;s conviction, in an effort to spare him the noose.

===From corporate lawyer to labor lawyer===

Darrow soon became one of America&#x27;s leading labor attorneys. He helped organize the Populist Party in Illinois and then ran for U.S. Congress as a Democrat in 1895 but lost to Hugh R. Belknap. In 1897, his marriage to Jessie Ohl ended in divorce. He joined the Anti-Imperialist League in 1898 in opposition to the U.S. annexation of the Philippines. He represented the woodworkers of Wisconsin in a notable case in Oshkosh in 1898 and the United Mine Workers in Pennsylvania in the great anthracite coal strike of 1902. He flirted with the idea of running for mayor of Chicago in 1903 but ultimately decided against it. The following year, in July, Darrow married Ruby Hammerstrom, a young Chicago journalist. His former mentor, Governor John Peter Altgeld, joined Darrow&#x27;s firm following his Chicago mayoral electoral defeat in 1899 and worked with Darrow until his death in 1902. From 1903 to 1911, Darrow was partners in the firm of Darrow, Masters and Wilson with Edgar Lee Masters, who later became a famous poet, and Francis S. Wilson, who later served as Chief Justice of the Illinois Supreme Court.
From 1906 to 1908, Darrow represented the Western Federation of Miners leaders William &quot;Big Bill&quot; Haywood, Charles Moyer, and George Pettibone when they were arrested and charged with conspiring to murder former Idaho Governor Frank Steunenberg in 1905. Haywood and Pettibone were acquitted in separate trials, and the charges against Moyer were then dropped.

In 1911, the American Federation of Labor (AFL) called on Darrow to defend the McNamara brothers, John and James, who were charged in the Los Angeles &quot;Times&quot; bombing on October 1, 1910, during the bitter struggle over the open shop in Southern California. The bomb had been placed in an alley behind the building, and although the explosion itself did not bring the building down, it ignited nearby ink barrels and natural gas main lines. In the ensuing fire, 20 people were killed. The AFL appealed to local, state, regional and national unions to donate 25 cents per capita to the defense fund, and set up defense committees in larger cities throughout the nation to accept donations.

In the weeks before the jury was seated, Darrow became increasingly concerned about the outcome of the trial and began negotiations for a plea bargain to spare the defendants&#x27; lives. During the weekend of November 19–20, 1911, he discussed with pro-labor journalist Lincoln Steffens and newspaper publisher E.W. Scripps the possibility of reaching out to the &quot;Times&quot; about the terms of a plea agreement. The prosecution had demands of its own, however, including an admission of guilt in open court and longer sentences than the defense proposed.

The defense&#x27;s position weakened when, on November 28, Darrow was accused of orchestrating to bribe a prospective juror. The juror reported the offer to police, who set up a sting and observed the defense team&#x27;s chief investigator, Bert Franklin, delivering $4,000 to the juror two blocks away from Darrow&#x27;s office. After making payment, Franklin walked one block in the direction of Darrow&#x27;s office before being arrested right in front of Darrow himself, who had just walked to that very intersection after receiving a phone call in his office. With Darrow himself on the verge of being discredited, the defense&#x27;s hope for a simple plea agreement ended. On December 1, 1911, the McNamara brothers changed their pleas to guilty, in open court. The plea bargain Darrow helped arrange earned John fifteen years and James life imprisonment. Despite sparing the brothers the death penalty, Darrow was accused by many in organized labor of selling the movement out.

====From defense lawyer to defendant====
Two months later, Darrow was charged with two counts of attempting to bribe jurors in both cases. He faced two lengthy trials. In the first, defended by Earl Rogers, he was acquitted. Rogers became ill during the second trial and rarely came to court. Darrow served as his own attorney for the remainder of the trial, which ended with a hung jury. A deal was struck in which the district attorney agreed not to retry Darrow if he promised not to practice law again in California. Darrow&#x27;s early biographers, Irving Stone and Arthur and Lila Weinberg, asserted that he was not involved in the bribery conspiracy, but more recently, Geoffrey Cowan and John A. Farrell, with the help of new evidence, concluded that he almost certainly was. In the biography of Earl Rogers by his daughter Adela, she wrote: &quot;I never had any doubts, even before one of my father&#x27;s private conversations with Darrow included an admission of guilt to his lawyer.&quot;

===From labor lawyer to criminal lawyer===

As a consequence of the bribery charges, most labor unions dropped Darrow from their list of preferred attorneys. This effectively put Darrow out of business as a labor lawyer, and he switched to civil and criminal cases. He took the latter because he had become convinced that the criminal justice system could ruin people&#x27;s lives if they were not adequately represented.

Throughout his career, Darrow devoted himself to opposing the death penalty, which he felt to be in conflict with humanitarian progress. In more than 100 cases, only one of Darrow&#x27;s clients was executed. He became renowned for moving juries and even judges to tears with his eloquence. Darrow had a keen intellect often hidden by his rumpled, unassuming appearance.

A July 23, 1915, article in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; describes Darrow&#x27;s effort on behalf of J.H. Fox, an Evanston, Illinois, landlord, to have Mary S. Brazelton committed to an insane asylum against the wishes of her family. Fox alleged that Brazelton owed him rent money, although other residents of Fox&#x27;s boarding house testified to her sanity.

===National renown===

====Leopold and Loeb====

In the summer of 1924, Darrow took on the case of Nathan Leopold Jr. and Richard Loeb, the teenage sons of two wealthy Chicago families who were accused of kidnapping and killing Bobby Franks, a 14-year-old boy, from their stylish southside Kenwood neighborhood. Leopold was a law student at the University of Chicago about to transfer to Harvard Law School, and Loeb was the youngest graduate ever from the University of Michigan; they were 19 and 18, respectively, when they were arrested. When asked why they committed the crime, Leopold told his captors: &quot;The thing that prompted Dick to want to do this thing and prompted me to want to do this thing was a sort of pure love of excitement ... the imaginary love of thrills, doing something different ... the satisfaction and the ego of putting something over.&quot;

Chicago newspapers labeled the case the &quot;Trial of the Century&quot; and Americans around the country wondered what could drive the two young men, blessed with everything their society could offer, to commit such a depraved act. The killers had been arrested after a passing workman spotted the victim&#x27;s body in an isolated nature preserve near the Indiana border just half a day after it was hidden, before they could collect a $10,000 ransom. Nearby were Leopold&#x27;s eyeglasses with their distinctive, traceable frames, which he had dropped at the scene.

Leopold and Loeb made full confessions and took police on a hunt around Chicago to collect the evidence that would be used against them. The state&#x27;s attorney told the press that he had a &quot;hanging case&quot; for sure. Darrow stunned the prosecution when he had his clients plead guilty in order to avoid a vengeance-minded jury and place the case before a judge. The trial, then, was actually a long sentencing hearing in which Darrow contended, with the help of expert testimony, that Leopold and Loeb were mentally diseased.

Darrow&#x27;s closing argument lasted 12 hours. He repeatedly stressed the ages of the &quot;boys&quot; (before the Vietnam War, the age of majority was 21) and noted that &quot;never had there been a case in Chicago where on a plea of guilty a boy under 21 had been sentenced to death.&quot; His plea was designed to soften the heart of Judge John Caverly, but also to mold public opinion, so that Caverly could follow precedent without too huge an uproar. Darrow succeeded. Caverly sentenced Leopold and Loeb to life in prison plus 99 years. Darrow&#x27;s closing argument was published in several editions in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and was reissued at the time of his death.

The Leopold and Loeb case raised, in a well-publicized trial, Darrow&#x27;s lifelong contention that psychological, physical, and environmental influences—not a conscious choice between right and wrong—control human behavior. Darrow&#x27;s psychiatric expert witnesses testified that both boys &quot;were decidedly deficient in emotion&quot;. Darrow later argued that emotion is necessary for the decisions that people make. When someone tries to go against a certain law or custom that is forbidden, he wrote, he should feel a sense of revulsion. As neither Leopold nor Loeb had a working emotional system, they did not feel revolted.

During the trial, the newspapers claimed that Darrow was presenting a &quot;million dollar defense&quot; for the two wealthy families. Many ordinary Americans were angered at his apparent greed. He had the families issue a statement insisting that there would be no large legal fees and that his fees would be determined by a committee composed of officers from the Chicago Bar Association. After trial, Darrow suggested $200,000 would be reasonable. After lengthy negotiations with the defendants&#x27; families, he ended up getting some $70,000 in gross fees, which, after expenses and taxes, netted Darrow $30,000, worth over $375,000 in 2016.

====Scopes Trial====

In 1925, Darrow defended John T. Scopes in the &quot;State of Tennessee v. Scopes&quot; trial. It has often been called the &quot;Scopes Monkey Trial,&quot; a title popularized by author and journalist H.L. Mencken. The trial, which was deliberately staged to bring publicity to the issue at hand, pitted Darrow against William Jennings Bryan in a court case that tested Tennessee&#x27;s Butler Act, which had been passed on March 21, 1925. The act forbade the teaching of &quot;the Evolution Theory&quot; in any state-funded educational establishment. More broadly, it outlawed in state-funded schools (including universities) the teaching of &quot;any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.&quot;

During the trial, Darrow requested that Bryan be called to the stand as an expert witness on the Bible. Over the other prosecutor&#x27;s objection, Bryan agreed. Popular media at the time portrayed the following exchange as the deciding factor that turned public opinion against Bryan in the trial:
:Darrow: &quot;You have given considerable study to the Bible, haven&#x27;t you, Mr. Bryan?&quot;
:Bryan: &quot;Yes, sir; I have tried to... But, of course, I have studied it more as I have become older than when I was a boy.&quot;
:Darrow: &quot;Do you claim then that everything in the Bible should be literally interpreted?&quot;
:Bryan: &quot;I believe that everything in the Bible should be accepted as it is given there; some of the Bible is given illustratively. For instance: &#x27;Ye are the salt of the earth.&#x27; I would not insist that man was actually salt, or that he had flesh of salt, but it is used in the sense of salt as saving God&#x27;s people.&quot;

After about two hours, Judge John T. Raulston cut the questioning short and on the following morning ordered that the whole session (which in any case the jury had not witnessed) be expunged from the record, ruling that the testimony had no bearing on whether Scopes was guilty of teaching evolution. Scopes was found guilty and ordered to pay the minimum fine of $100.

A year later, the Tennessee Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Dayton court on a procedural technicality—not on constitutional grounds, as Darrow had hoped. According to the court, the fine should have been set by the jury, not Raulston. Rather than send the case back for further action, however, the Tennessee Supreme Court dismissed the case. The court commented, &quot;Nothing is to be gained by prolonging the life of this bizarre case.&quot;

The event led to a change in public sentiment and an increased discourse on the creation claims of religious teachers versus those of secular scientists i.e., creationism compared to evolutionism that still exists. It also became popularized in a play based loosely on the trial, &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;, which has been adapted several times on film and television.

====Ossian Sweet====
On September 9, 1925, a white mob in Detroit attempted to drive a black family out of the home they had purchased in a white neighborhood. During the struggle, a white man was killed, and the eleven black people in the house were later arrested and charged with murder. Ossian Sweet, a doctor, and three members of his family were brought to trial, and after an initial deadlock, Darrow argued to the all-white jury: &quot;I insist that there is nothing but prejudice in this case; that if it was reversed and eleven white men had shot and killed a black man while protecting their home and their lives against a mob of blacks, nobody would have dreamed of having them indicted. They would have been given medals instead...&quot;

Following a mistrial, it was agreed that each of the eleven defendants would be tried individually. Darrow, alongside Thomas Chawke, would first defend Ossian&#x27;s brother Henry, who had confessed to firing the shot on Garland Street. Henry was found not guilty on grounds of self-defense, and the prosecution determined to drop the charges on the remaining ten. The trials were presided over by Frank Murphy, who went on to become Governor of Michigan and an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

Darrow&#x27;s closing statement, which lasted over seven hours, is seen as a landmark in the civil rights movement and was included in the book &quot;Speeches that Changed the World&quot; (given the name &quot;I Believe in the Law of Love&quot;). The two closing arguments of Clarence Darrow, from the first and second trials, show how he learned from the first trial and reshaped his remarks.

====Massie Trial====
The Scopes Trial and the Sweet trial were the last big cases that Darrow took on before he retired from full-time practice at the age of 68. He still took on a few cases such as the 1932 Massie Trial in Hawaii.

In his last headline-making case, the Massie Trial, Darrow, devastated by the Great Depression, was hired by Eva Stotesbury, the wife of Darrow&#x27;s old family friend Edward T. Stotesbury, to come to the defense of Grace Fortescue, Edward J. Lord, Deacon Jones, and Thomas Massie, Fortescue&#x27;s son-in-law, who were accused of murdering Joseph Kahahawai. Kahahawai had been accused, along with four other men, of raping and beating Thalia Massie, Thomas&#x27;s wife and Fortescue&#x27;s daughter; the resulting 1931 case ended in a hung jury (though the charges were later dropped and repeated investigation has shown them to be innocent). Enraged, Fortescue and Massie then orchestrated the murder of Kahahawai in order to extract a confession and were caught by police officers while transporting his dead body.

Darrow entered the racially charged atmosphere as the lawyer for the defendants. He reconstructed the case as a justified honor killing by Thomas Massie. Considered by &quot;The New York Times&quot; to be one of Darrow&#x27;s three most compelling trials (along with the Scopes Trial and the Leopold and Loeb case), the case captivated the nation and most of America strongly supported the honor killing defense. In fact, the final defense arguments were transmitted to the mainland through a special radio hookup. In the end, the jury came back with a unanimous verdict of guilty, but on the lesser crime of manslaughter. As to Darrow&#x27;s closing, one juror commented, &quot;[h]e talked to us like a bunch of farmers. That stuff may go over big in the Middle West, but not here.&quot; Governor Lawrence Judd later commuted the sentences to one hour in his office. Years later Deacon admitted to shooting Kahahawai; Kahahawai was found not guilty in a posthumous trial.

==Religious beliefs==
===&quot;Why I Am An Agnostic&quot;===
As part of a public symposium on belief held in Columbus, Ohio, in 1929, Darrow delivered a speech, later titled &quot;Why I Am An Agnostic&quot;, on agnosticism, skepticism, belief, and religion. In the speech, Darrow thoroughly discussed the meaning of being an agnostic and questioned the doctrines of Christianity and the Bible. He concluded that &quot;the fear of God is not the beginning of wisdom. The fear of God is the death of wisdom. Skepticism and doubt lead to study and investigation, and investigation is the beginning of wisdom.&quot;

===Mecca Temple Debate===
In January 1931 Darrow had a debate with English writer G. K. Chesterton during the latter&#x27;s second trip to America. This was held at New York City&#x27;s Mecca Temple. The topic was &quot;Will the World Return to Religion?&quot;. At the end of the debate those in the hall were asked to vote for the man they thought had won the debate. Darrow received 1,022 votes while Chesterton received 2,359 votes. There is no known transcript of what was said except for third party accounts published later on. The earliest of these was in the February 4, 1931, issue of &quot;The Nation&quot; in an article written by Henry Hazlitt.

===Position on eugenics===
In the edition of November 18, 1915, of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Darrow stated: &quot;Chloroform unfit children. Show them the same mercy that is shown beasts that are no longer fit to live.&quot; However, Darrow was also critical of some eugenics advocates.

By the 1920s, the eugenics movement was very powerful and Darrow was a pointed critic of that movement. In the years immediately before the Supreme Court of the United States would endorse eugenics through &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot;, Darrow wrote multiple essays criticizing the illogic of the eugenicists, especially the confirmation bias in eugenicist arguments.

In a 1925 essay, &quot;The Edwardses and the Jukeses&quot;, he imitated the eugenicists&#x27; tracking of pedigrees as a way to demonstrate that their retrospective centuries-long family tree studies were omitting literally thousands of relatives whose lives did not support the researchers&#x27; preconceptions. Eugenicist arguments about the eminent Edwards family (of the theologian Jonathan Edwards) ignored that family&#x27;s mediocre relatives, and even ignored some immediately related murderers. Eugenicist arguments about the Jukes family did just the opposite, leaving ignored or untraced many functional and law-abiding relatives.

In Darrow&#x27;s subsequent essay, &quot;The Eugenics Cult&quot; (1926), he attacked the reasoning of eugenicists. &quot;On the basis of what biological principles, and by what psychological hocus-pocus [Dr. William McDougall] reaches the conclusion that the ability to read intelligently denotes a good germ-plasm and desirable citizens I cannot say,&quot; he wrote. Darrow also criticized the idea that humanity knows what qualities it would take to make humanity &quot;better,&quot; and compared humanity&#x27;s biology experiments unfavorably to those of Nature.

==Political career==
Darrow was well-involved in Chicago&#x27;s Democratic politics. In the 1903 Chicago mayoral election there was a strong push by members of the Chicago Federation of Labor and others to draft Darrow as a third-party candidate. Darrow considered accepting, and even seemed prepared to announce his candidacy, but ultimately declined to run. Darrow served in the Illinois House of Representatives from the 17th district during the 43rd General Assembly as one of two members of the Public Ownership Party along with John J. McManaman. He was elected on a platform &quot;advocating the municipal ownership of public utilities.&quot;

Darrow was appointed in 1905 by newly elected Chicago mayor Edward Fitzsimmons Dunne to serve in the position of &quot;Special Traction Counsel to the Mayor&quot;, assisting Dunne in his attempts to resolve the city&#x27;s traction problem. He and Dunne had presented two plans to the Chicago City Council, both of which it rejected. Darrow resigned his position in November 1905.

==Death==
Darrow died on March 13, 1938, at his home, in Chicago, Illinois, of pulmonary heart disease.

==Legacy==
Today, Clarence Darrow is remembered for his reputation as a fierce trial attorney who, in many cases, championed the cause of the underdog; because of this, he is generally regarded as one of the greatest criminal defense lawyers in American history.
According to legend, before he died, Darrow declared that if there was an afterlife, he would return on the small bridge (now known as the Clarence Darrow Memorial Bridge) located just south of the Museum of Science and Industry in Hyde Park, Chicago on the date of his death. Darrow was skeptical of a belief in life after death (he is reported to have said: &quot;Every man knows when his life began... If I did not exist in the past, why should I, or could I, exist in the future?&quot;) but he made this promise to dissuade mediums from charging people money to &quot;talk&quot; to his spirit. People still gather on the bridge in the hope of seeing his ghost.

* &quot;Compulsion&quot;, 1957 play based on Meyer Levin&#x27;s novel of the same name. The basis for the 1959 film adaptation, with Dean Stockwell reprising his role from the Broadway production opposite Bradford Dillman and Orson Welles.
* &quot;Darrow&quot;, a full-length one-man play created after his death, featuring Darrow&#x27;s reminiscences about his career. Originated by Henry Fonda, many actors (including Leslie Nielsen and David Canary) have since taken on the role of Darrow in this play, which was adapted as &quot;Darrow&quot;, a film starring Kevin Spacey and released by American Playhouse in 1991.
* &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;, a play (later adapted to the screen) that is a broadly fictionalized account of the Scopes Trial. Though the authors noted that the 1925 trial was &quot;clearly the genesis&quot; of their play, they insisted the characters had a &quot;life and language of their own.&quot; They also mention that the issues raised in the play &quot;have acquired new dimension and meaning&quot;, a possible reference to the political controversies of the 1950s. Still, they finished their foreword by inviting a more universal reading of the play: &quot;It might have been yesterday. It could be tomorrow.&quot; Spencer Tracy played the Darrow character (&quot;Henry Drummond&quot;) in the film, and Jason Robards played him in a TV remake in 1988.
* &quot;Malice Aforethought: The Sweet Trials&quot; is a play written by Arthur Beer, based on the trials of Ossian and Henry Sweet, and derived from Kevin Boyle&#x27;s &quot;Arc of Justice&quot;.
* &quot;My Name is Ossian Sweet&quot;, a docudrama written by Gordon C. Bennett, based on the Sweet trials in which the black family was defended by Darrow against a charge of murder in Detroit 1925. Published (2011) at HeartlandPlays.com.
* &quot;Clarence Darrow&quot; by David W. Rintels, where Kevin Spacey again portrayed Darrow in this one-man performance in 2014 and 2015.
* &quot;Clarence Darrow Tonight!&quot; written and performed by Laurence Luckinbill, debuted at The Ensemble Theater in NYC and performed throughout the country, including at President Bill Clinton&#x27;s second inaugural in 1996. Winner of the 1996 Silver Gavel Award for Theater, given by the American Bar Association.
* During an interrogation at the police station in the 1949 movie &quot;Holiday Affair&quot;, the character Connie Ennis (Janet Leigh) said to the lieutenant (Harry Morgan), &quot;Your honor, I think I can clear this all up.&quot; The lieutenant said, &quot;Go ahead, if Clarence Darrow here doesn&#x27;t have any objections.&quot; He was referring to her fiancé in the movie Carl Davis, played by Wendell Corey.

* Darrow was reported to have distracted juries during the closing arguments of his opponents with a cigar trick. He allegedly inserted a thin piano wire into his cigar, which he lit up in the courtroom, to prevent the cigar ash from falling. The jury was reportedly distracted by the fact that the ashes, held together by the wire, never fell from Darrow&#x27;s cigar.
Darrow was briefly mentioned in an episode of the award-winning drama series &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;.

==Books by Darrow==
A volume of Darrow&#x27;s boyhood reminiscences, entitled &quot;Farmington&quot;, was published in Chicago in 1903 by McClurg and Company.

Darrow shared offices with Edgar Lee Masters, who achieved more fame for his poetry, in particular, the &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot;, than for his advocacy.

The Riesenfeld Rare Books Research Center of the University of Minnesota Law School has the largest collection of Clarence Darrow material including personal letters to and from Darrow.

“The Oshkosh Woodworkers’Strike of 1898: A Wisconsin Community in Crisis” 
by Virginia Glenn Crane (1998). Darrow successfully defended strike organizers charged with crimes (State of Wisconsin vs. Kidd, Zentner, and Troiber) with a six hour closing argument resulting in a jury verdict of “not guilty” at 4:15PM on 11/2/1898,(an important precedent for organized labor in the United States that laborers could not be criminally charged by exercising their right to seek better working conditions).

<text>Margaret Leijonhufvud or Margareta Eriksdotter (1 January 1516 – 26 August 1551) was Queen of Sweden from 1536 to 1551 by marriage to King Gustav I. She played a political role as the advisor and intermediary to her spouse.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Margaret Leijonhuvfud was a member of one of Sweden&#x27;s most powerful noble families: the early Leijonhufvud clan of Swedish nobility (the name meaning &quot;Lion&#x27;s Head&quot;), being the daughter of Erik Abrahamsson Leijonhufvud, a man executed in the Stockholm bloodbath, and wife Ebba Eriksdotter Vasa, the second cousin of king Gustav.

There is very little known of her life prior to her marriage. Her father was executed when she was four years old, during which time she hid with her mother and siblings in the Västerås Monastery. She spent her childhood mainly at Lo Castle in Västergötland and Ekeberg in Närke. At that time, the contemporary educational ideal for a Swedish noblewoman was to be tutored in reading, writing, economics, and mathematics. She was expected to learn how to manage a large estate and landholding and perform the duties of her future spouse in his absence, as well as to have knowledge at least in the German language except Swedish, and to deport herself with humility but also dignity by reading religious literature. Finally, it was customary for a girl from the nobility to spend some time in a convent to complete her education, and Margaret is likely to have received this customary education.

Though there is no explicit confirmation of this, it is considered very likely for Margaret to have served as a maid-of-honour to the queen, Catherine of Saxe-Lauenburg: she was fifteen years old in 1531 when the king married Catherine. Her sister Brita married the king&#x27;s favorite courtier Gustav Olofsson Stenbock in the presence of the royal couple shortly after, and though no list of Queen Catherine&#x27;s ladies survives, Margaret&#x27;s social position, connections, age, and contemporary custom makes it extremely likely that she completed her education by serving the queen, as was the custom for girls of her position at the time.

===Marriage===

In 1535, the King was widowed by Catherine of Saxe-Lauenburg and left with only one legitimate child and heir. A new marriage for the King was deemed necessary, and his decision to choose a spouse from among the nobility has been explained by the need to secure inner support and allies among the nobility for his rule, and because of the political and religious difficulties, along with the great cost and time, involved in negotiating a marriage with a foreign princess.

Margaret was selected to marry the king as she belonged to one of the leading noble families of the realm, creating an alliance between the king and one of the most powerful factions of the nobility; her mother was a relative of the king, and her sisters were both married to the king&#x27;s favorite courtiers: Birgitta &quot;Brita&quot; to Gustav Olofsson Stenbock, and Anna to Axel Eriksson Bielke.

There is no confirmation about how Margaret felt about the marriage: both church law, as well as secular law, banned forced marriages, but both religious and secular custom demanded that children should obey their parents. According to the traditional tale, Margaret hid in a box when the king came to her parents&#x27; estate to propose.

Margaret married King Gustav I October 1536 in Uppsala Cathedral in a ceremony conducted by archbishop Laurentius Petri and was crowned Queen there the next day. At her wedding, her brothers Abraham and Sten were knighted, as well as her brother-in-law were named &quot;riksråd&quot;, beginning what was referred to as the period of the &quot;Kungafränderna&quot; (&#x27;The King&#x27;s Relatives&#x27;), meaning the relatives he acquired through marriage with Margaret, in which her relatives were given prominent positions and influence at court as the king&#x27;s closest allies, married in with the king&#x27;s relatives and often present at official royal representational ceremonies. During the first years of their marriage, Margaret&#x27;s mother Ebba played a dominating role in the royal court, and it was said that even the king did not dare to oppose his mother-in-law.

According to tradition, Margaret was engaged to Svante Sture when the king decided to marry her, but her family broke the engagement and her former fiancé was married to her sister, Martha Leijonhufvud, instead. A story describes how her sister&#x27;s marriage came about. According to tradition, the king caught his new queen and her former fiancé together alone, with the young man, Svante Sture, on his knees before the queen. The king reportedly asked in a rage: &quot;What is this?!&quot; upon which Queen Margaret swiftly answered: &quot;My Lord Sture is asking me for the hand of my sister!&quot; At this, the king just as swiftly answered: &quot;Granted!&quot; 
And so, Svante Sture hastily married the queen&#x27;s sister Martha Leijonhufvud. There is not documented confirmation that Margaret and Sture were engaged, but it is considered very likely, as their marriage would have been exactly what her family would have arranged for her, had she not married the king.

===Queen===

Queen Margaret has been given a very good estimation in contemporary documents as well as in history, and referred to as intelligent and beautiful; she is described as a loyal wife who never abused her influence, as a responsible parent, a skillful manager of the royal court and household, and as a compassionate philanthropist of the poor and needing. The marriage has been described as happy, and the king was not known ever to have been unfaithful to her.

Margaret was loyally devoted to her birth family her entire life, who was greatly benefited by her royal marriage, and often successfully used her as mediator for benefits from the king. Several of her male relatives was given offices by the king, and her sisters benefited from favors granted to their spouses: her sister Anna&#x27;s spouse was made the greatest landholder in Östergötland and her sister Brita&#x27;s spouse the equivalent in Västergötland, while her widowed mother and maternal grandmother Anna Karlsdotter was granted personal lands and the right to the income of personal taxes from their peasantry. On a personal level, Margaret seems to have been closest to her sister Martha, who is most frequently mentioned in her correspondence, addressed as &quot;The Dearest Sister of My Heart&quot; and who more often than other family members successfully asked her for mediation with the king on behalf of herself, her spouse and supplicants.

As queen, she was given the responsibility of the royal household and as such the right to appoint artisans and merchants with Royal warrant of appointment. 
The members of the royal household are only fragmentarily known during her tenure, but she hosted a great number of maids-of-honour, who were successively married to the king&#x27;s male courtiers in order to carefully balance the power among the noble families of the realm. One of the most well-known of such marriages is that of the great heiress Ebba Lilliehöök. Among the most prominent members of her own staff was the cunning woman Birgitta Lass Andersson, a trusted favorite and confidante with medical knowledge, who was entrusted many of her private affairs and also saw to the health of herself, her sister Martha and children. 
Margaret was also a landlord in her own right, and she was closely involved in the management of her personal estates and its dependents. She remained a Catholic her entire life despite the Swedish Reformation, and is known to have made donations to the still active Vadstena Abbey, following the example of her family, her mother being the benefactor of Vreta Abbey.

Queen Margaret is credited with meaningful influence over the monarch. Her influence was of the kind accepted for a queen consort in accordance with contemporary ideals — that of speaking to the King on the behalf of others, as well as performing political tasks he assigned to her as his deputy, rather than to have used her influence to promote any personal agenda. She was thus not regarded to have been politically active, and has been favorable compared to Queen Gunilla Bielke, who was said to meddle in politics.
Margaret allegedly had the ability to keep the monarchs&#x27; temperament under control, and was a calming influence on him. In accordance with the ideal of Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism, it was her task as a wife to give her spouse advice, and act as a go-between and mediator to mitigate her spouse&#x27;s punishments to the benefit of those in need, a form of influence which was considered legitimate and thus not regarded as interference in state affairs. She is known in history for her great activity in this regard and often successful, something Gustavus himself admitted, when he reduced a sentence at her request. She managed to get punishments he meted out reduced, and advised him to show mercy and leniency, all of which made her popular.

Because of this activity she received a large number of petitions from supplicants who used her as a go-between for them and the king. She is said to have been credited with a great diplomatic ability, which made it possible for her to have success rather than to irritate the king when she came to him and spoke to him on others&#x27; behalf in various issues, some of them indeed political. There are many examples of this, ranging from business permits to death sentences and political issues. Already in the autumn of 1536, a pardon for a criminal sentenced to execution was mitigated by the king &quot;For the sake of the Prayer of Our Dear Mistress Queen Margaret&quot;, and she also managed to have the king return the confiscated property of Margareta Gire, wife of the exiled suspected conspirator Wulf Gyler, release her from custody and allow her to depart to her spouse in Germany. The king, however, did not always like her influence over him to be abused and her mediation activity to be so extensive and was on at least one occasion known to have reprimanded a supplicant for having asked his queen to mediate rather than to come to him directly.

Queen Margaret could however also help supplicants without involving the king at all. Several cases are documented in which she helped supplicants with funds from her personal fortune, by contacting the right people and authorities in a court case or legal dispute, and when legal courts mitigated sentences &quot;Because of the Gracious Prayer of Our Lady&quot;. In October 1547, for example, a woman named Anna, recently a widow of Peder Mattsson from Stockholm, was accused of adultery (at the time a legal offense) with her lover Rasmus Jute by a man named Simon; instead of attending her trial, however, Anna &quot;entered the royal palace in secrecy and appealed personally to Our Dear Gracious Lady to be her of assistance&quot;, upon which the queen called for Anna&#x27;s accuser and &quot;Banned him from having anything whatever to do with her [Anna]&quot;, after which Anna was spared a trial and could remarry her lover. In a similar fashion, she interrupted the ongoing witch trial against the cunning woman Karin Åsmundz and had her let free. When the king arrested statesman Conrad von Pyhy, the queen sent for his wife Anna von Pyhy and gave her money so that she might return to her relatives in Germany before she would be in any danger due to her spouse&#x27;s arrest.

King Gustav eventually gave Margaret political assignments and responsibilities. He gave her tasks such as supervising the governors of royal estates and power holders such as bailiffs or landholders, in order to prevent power abuse that could otherwise breed political unrest and rebellions. In 1543, he asked her to send spies to Södermanland to investigate whether there was any truth in rumored plans for rebellion there and if so, why the peasantry was discontent. She was entrusted tasks within foreign policy: when her brother Sten was sent as ambassador to the French royal court in 1542 in order to negotiate a Swedish-French alliance, Margaret was tasked to perform a diplomatic correspondence with the French king&#x27;s influential sister Marguerite de Navarre in Latin, and she also attended the First Treaty of Brömsebro (1541). 
In 1542, the king gave instructions to the governors of the royal castles of Läckö, Stegeborg, Gripsholm and Stockholm to keep them for Margaret in her name until his son became of age, if he should die while his heir was still a child, which in effect gave her control of the kingdom. In his succession order issued in Västerås in 1544, he stated that if he should die when his successor was still a child, Margaret should rule as regent in a guardian government with representatives of the nobility until the age of majority of his son.

===Death===

Margaret was almost constantly pregnant, which devastated her health. In August 1551, she and her children made an excursion by boat on Mälaren between Gripsholm and Västerås, and on their return, she took ill with pneumonia. According to the chronicle of Aegidius Girs, Margaret thanked her spouse on her death bed for making her queen, regretted that she had not been worthy of it, and asked her children not to quarrel. When she died, she was deeply mourned by the king. Tradition say that an eclipse took place upon her death. She died at Tynnelsö Castle.

<text>The Kingdom of Travancore (), also known as the Kingdom of Thiruvithamkoor () or later as Travancore State, was a kingdom that lasted from until 1949. It was ruled by the Travancore Royal Family from Padmanabhapuram, and later Thiruvananthapuram. At its zenith, the kingdom covered most of the south of modern-day Kerala (Idukki, Kottayam, Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta, Kollam, and Thiruvananthapuram districts, major portions of Ernakulam district, Puthenchira village of Thrissur district) and the southernmost part of modern-day Tamil Nadu (Kanyakumari district and some parts of Tenkasi district) with the Thachudaya Kaimal&#x27;s enclave of Irinjalakuda Koodalmanikyam temple in the neighbouring Kingdom of Cochin. However Tangasseri area of Kollam city and Anchuthengu near Attingal in Thiruvananthapuram were parts of British India. 

Malabar District of Madras Presidency to the north, Madurai and Tirunelveli districts of Pandya Nadu region in Madras Presidency to the east, the Indian Ocean to the south, and the Arabian Sea to the west. 

Travancore was divided into five divisions:
Padmanabhapuram, Thiruvananthapuram, Quilon, Kottayam, and Devikulam, of which Padmanabhapuram and Devikulam was predominantly Tamil speaking region with small Malayalam speaking minorities.
The divisions of Thiruvananthapuram,Kollam,Kottayam was predominantly Malayalam speaking region with small Tamil speaking Minority.

King Marthanda Varma inherited the small feudal state of Venad in 1723, and built it into Travancore. Marthanda Varma led the Travancorean forces during the Travancore-Dutch War of 1739–46, which culminated in the Battle of Colachel. The defeat of the Dutch by Travancore is considered the earliest example of an organised power from Asia overcoming European military technology and tactics. Marthanda Varma went on to conquer most of the smaller principalities of the native rulers.

The Travancore royal family signed a treaty with the British in 1788, thereby adopting British dominance. Later, in 1805, they revised the treaty, leading to a diminution of royal authority and the loss of political independence for Travancore. They had to give up their ruling rights over the common people in 1949 when Travancore were forced to merge with Independent India.

==Etymology==

The kingdom takes its name from Thiruvithamcode in the present-day Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu.

The region had many small independent kingdoms. Later, at the peak of the Chera-Chola-Pandya, this region became part of the Chera Kingdom (except for the Ay kingdom, which always remained independent). When the region was part of the Chera empire, it was still known as &quot;Thiruvazhumkode&quot;. It was contracted to &quot;Thiruvankode&quot;, and anglicised by the English to &quot;Travancore&quot;.

In the course of time, the Ay clan, part of the Chera empire, which ruled the Thiruvazhumkode area, became an independent kingdom, and the land was called &quot;Aayi Desam&quot; or &quot;Aayi Rajyam&quot;, meaning &#x27;Aayi territory&#x27;. The Aayis controlled the land from the present-day Kollam district in the north, through Thiruvananthapuram district to Kanyakumari district in the south. There were two capitals, the major one at Kollam (&quot;Venad Swaroopam&quot; or &quot;Desinganadu&quot;) and a subsidiary one at Thrippapur (&quot;Thrippapur Swaroopam&quot; or &quot;Nanjinad&quot;). The kingdom was thus also called Venad. Kings of Venad had, built residential palaces in Thiruvithamcode and Kalkulam. Thiruvithamcode became the capital of the Thrippapur Swaroopam, and the country was referred to as &quot;Thiruvithamcode&quot; by Europeans even after the capital had been moved in 1601 to Padmanabhapuram, near Kalkulam.

The Chera empire had dissolved by around 1100 and thereafter the territory comprised numerous small kingdoms until the time of Marthanda Varma who, as king of Venad from 1729, employed brutal methods to unify them. During his reign, Thiruvithamkoor (Anglicized as Travancore) became the official name.

==Geography==
The Kingdom of Travancore was located at the extreme southern tip of the Indian subcontinent. Geographically, Travancore was divided into three climatically distinct regions: the eastern highlands (rugged and cool mountainous terrain), the central midlands (rolling hills), and the western lowlands (coastal plains).

==History==
Due to the geographical isolation of the Malabar Coast from the rest of the Indian peninsula, attributed to the presence of the Western Ghats mountain ranges lying parallel to the coast, the population and language spoken in Kerala differed from those in neighboring states such as Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

According to the religious text &quot;Keralolpathi&quot; by the Nambudhiri Brahmins, the region from Gokharna to Kanyakumari district was created when Parashurama threw his axe and claimed this land, known as Parashuramakshetra.

===Medieval Kerala===

The Chera dynasty governed the Malabar Coast between Alappuzha in the south and Kasaragod in the north. The region around Coimbatore was ruled by the Cheras during the Sangam period roughly between the first and the fourth centuries CE and served as the eastern entrance to the Palakkad Gap, the principal trade route between the Malabar Coast and Tamil Nadu. However the southern region of the present-day Kerala state was under the Ay dynasty. During the Ay dynasty, they spoke a language known as Middle Tamil, which differed from Tamil spoken in Tamil Nadu. Later Ay dynasty, conquered and succeeded by the Kulashekara Perumals, based in Kollam (later known as Venad), during the period of the Chera Kulashekara Perumal (Keralaputras) dynasty, the language evolved into Old-Malayalam. The Quilon copper plates (849/850 CE) are considered the oldest available inscription written in Old Malayalam. Later, the northern regions of Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alapuzha, and Pathanamthitta districts became proper Malayalam-speaking populations in Kerala, while the other districts showed influences from Arabic, Tamil and Kannada languages. During the period of Pattom Thanu Pillai, Travancore was referred to as Malayalam state or the land of proper Malayalis.

===Venad Swaroopam===

The former state of Venad at the tip of the Indian subcontinent, traditionally ruled by rajas known as the Venattadis. Until the end of the 11th century AD, it was a small principality in the Ay Kingdom. The Ays were the earliest ruling dynasty in southern Kerala, who, at their zenith, ruled over a region from Nagercoil in the south to Thiruvananthapuram in the north. Their capital during the first Sangam age was in Aykudi and later, towards the end of the eighth century AD, at Quilon (Kollam). Though a series of attacks by the resurgent Pandyas between the seventh and eighth centuries caused the decline of the Ays, the dynasty was powerful until the beginning of the tenth century. Sulaiman al-Tajir, a Persian merchant who visited Kerala during the reign of Sthanu Ravi Varma (9th century CE), records that there was extensive trade between Kerala and China at that time, based at the port of Kollam.

When the Ay diminished, Venad became the southernmost principality of the Second Chera Kingdom. An invasion of the Cholas into Venad caused the destruction of Kollam in 1096. However, the Chera capital, Mahodayapuram, also fell in the subsequent Chola attack, which compelled the Chera king, Rama Varma Kulasekara, to shift his capital to Kollam. Thus, Rama Varma Kulasekara, the last emperor of the Chera dynasty, was probably the founder of the Venad royal house, and the title of the Chera kings, &quot;Kulasekara&quot;, was thenceforth kept by the rulers of Venad. Thus the end of the Second Chera dynasty in the 12th century marks the independence of Venad.

In the second half of the 12th century, two branches of the Ay dynasty, the Thrippappur and Chirava, merged in the Venad family, which set up the tradition of designating the ruler of Venad as Chirava Moopan and the heir-apparent as &quot;Thrippappur Moopan&quot;. While the Chrirava Moopan had his residence at Kollam, the Thrippappur Moopan resided at his palace in Thrippappur, nine miles north of Thiruvananthapuram, and was vested with authority over the temples of Venad kingdom, especially the Sri Padmanabhaswamy temple.

===Formation and development of Travancore===



In the early 18th century CE, the Travancore royal family adopted some members from the royal family of Kolathunadu based at Kannur, and Parappanad in present-day Malappuram district. The history of Travancore began with Marthanda Varma, who inherited the kingdom of Venad (Thrippappur), and expanded it into Travancore during his reign (1729–1758). After defeating a union of feudal lords and establishing internal peace, he expanded the kingdom of Venad through a series of military campaigns from Kanyakumari in the south to the borders of Kochi in the north during his 29-year rule. This rule also included Travancore-Dutch War (1739–1753) between Travancore and the Dutch East India Company, which had been allied to some of these kingdoms.

In 1741, Travancore won the Battle of Colachel against the Dutch East India Company, resulting in the complete eclipse of Dutch power in the region. In this battle, the Dutch Captain, Eustachius De Lannoy, was captured. He later defected to Travancore.

De Lannoy was appointed captain of His Highness&#x27; bodyguard and later Senior Admiral (&quot;Valiya kappittan&quot;) and modernised the Travancore army by introducing firearms and artillery. From 1741 to 1758, De Lannoy remained in command of the Travancore forces and was involved in annexation of small principalities.

Travancore became the most dominant state in the Kerala region by defeating the powerful Zamorin of Kozhikode in the battle of Purakkad in 1755. Ramayyan Dalawa, the prime minister (1737–1756) of Marthanda Varma, also played an important role in this consolidation and expansion.

On 3 January 1750, (5 Makaram, 925 Kollavarsham), Marthanda Varma virtually &quot;dedicated&quot; Travancore to his tutelary deity Padmanabha, one of the aspects of the Hindu God Vishnu with a lotus issuing from his navel on which Brahma sits. From then on the rulers of Travancore ruled as the &quot;servants of Padmanabha&quot; (the Padmnabha-dasar).

At the Battle of Ambalapuzha, Marthanda Varma defeated the union of the kings who had been deposed and the king of the Cochin kingdom.

===Mysore invasion===

Marthanda Varma&#x27;s successor Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma (1758–1798), who was popularly known as Dharma Raja, shifted the capital in 1795 from Padmanabhapuram to Thiruvananthapuram. Dharma Raja&#x27;s period is considered a Golden Age in the history of Travancore. He not only retained the territorial gains of his predecessor, but also improved and encouraged social development. He was greatly assisted by a very efficient administrator, Raja Kesavadas, the Diwan of Travancore. 

Travancore often allied with the English East India Company in military conflicts. During Dharma Raja&#x27;s reign, Tipu Sultan, the de facto ruler of Mysore and the son of Hyder Ali, attacked Travancore in 1789 as a part of the Mysore invasion of Kerala. Dharma Raja had earlier refused to hand over the Hindu political refugees from the Mysore occupation of Malabar who had been given asylum in Travancore. The Mysore army entered the Cochin kingdom from Coimbatore in November 1789 and reached Thrissur in December. On 28 December 1789 Tipu Sultan attacked the Nedunkotta (Northern Lines) from the north, causing the Battle of Nedumkotta (1789), and the defeat of the Mysore army.

===Velu Thampi Dalawa&#x27;s rebellion===


On Dharma Raja&#x27;s death in 1798, Balarama Varma (1798–1810), the weakest ruler of the dynasty, took over at the age of sixteen. A treaty brought Travancore under a Subsidiary alliance with the East India Company in 1795.

The Prime Ministers (Dalawas or Dewans) started to take control of the kingdom beginning with Velu Thampi Dalawa (Velayudhan Chempakaraman Thampi) (1799–1809) who was appointed as the &quot;divan&quot; following the dismissal of Jayanthan Sankaran Nampoothiri (1798–1799). Initially, Velayudhan Chempakaraman Thampi and the English East India Company got along very well. When a section of the Travancore army mutinied in 1805 against Velu Thampi Dalawa, he sought refuge with the British Resident Colonel (later General) Colin Macaulay and later used English East India Company troops to crush the mutiny. Velu Thampi also played a key role in negotiating a new treaty between Travancore and the English East India Company. However, the demands of the East India Company for the payment of compensation for their involvement in the Travancore-Mysore War (1791) on behalf of Travancore, led to tension between the Diwan and Colonel Macaulay. Velu Thampi and the diwan of Cochin kingdom, Paliath Achan Govindan Menon, who was unhappy with Macaulay for granting asylum to his enemy Kunhi Krishna Menon, declared &quot;war&quot; on the East India Company. 

The East India Company army defeated Paliath Achan&#x27;s army in Cochin on 27 February 1809. Paliath Achan surrendered to the East India Company and was exiled to Madras and later to Benaras. The Company defeated forces under Velu Thampi Dalawa at battles near Nagercoil and Kollam, and inflicted heavy casualties on the rebels, many of whom then deserted and went back home. The Maharajah of Travancore, who hitherto had not openly taken any part in the rebellion, now allied with the British and appointed one of Thampi&#x27;s enemies as his prime minister. The allied East India Company army and the Travancore soldiers camped in Pappanamcode, just outside Thiruvananthapuram. Velu Thampi Dalawa now organised a guerrilla struggle against the company, but committed suicide to avoid capture by the Travancore army. After the mutiny of 1805 against Velu Thampi Dalawa, most of the Nair army battalions of Travancore were disbanded, and after Velu Thampi Dalawa&#x27;s uprising, almost all of the remaining Travancore forces were also disbanded, with the East India Company undertaking to serve the Rajah in cases of external and internal aggression. 

===Cessation of mahādanams===

The Rajahs of Travancore had been conditionally promoted to Kshatriyahood with periodic performance of 16 mahādānams (great gifts in charity) such as Hiranya-garbhā, Hiranya-Kāmadhenu, and Hiranyāswaratā in each of which thousands of Brahmins had been given costly gifts apart from each getting a minimum of 1 &quot;kazhanch&quot; (78.65 gm) of gold. In 1848 the Marquess of Dalhousie, then Governor-General of India, was apprised that the depressed condition of the finances in Travancore was due to the mahādanams by the rulers. Lord Dalhousie instructed Lord Harris, Governor of the Madras Presidency, to warn the then King of Travancore, Martanda Varma (Uttram Tirunal 1847–60), that if he did not put a stop to this practice, the Madras Presidency would take over his state&#x27;s administration. This led to the cessation of the practice of mahādanams. 

All Travancorean Kings including Sree Moolam Thirunal conducted the &quot;Hiranyagarbham&quot; and &quot;Tulapurushadaanam&quot; ceremonies. Maharaja Chithira Thirunal was the only King of Travancore not to have conducted these rituals as he considered them extremely costly.

===The 19th and early 20th centuries===

In Travancore, the caste system was more rigorously enforced than in many other parts of India up to the mid-1800s. The hierarchical caste order was deeply entrenched in the social system and was supported by the government, which transformed this caste-based social system into a religious institution. In such a context, the belief in Ayyavazhi, apart from being a religious system, served also as a reform movement in uplifting the downtrodden of society, both socially and religiously. The rituals of Ayyavazhi constituted a social discourse. Its beliefs, mode of worship, and religious organisation seem to have enabled the Ayyavazhi group to negotiate, cope with, and resist the imposition of authority. The hard tone of Vaikundar towards this was perceived as a revolution against the government. So King Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma initially imprisoned Vaikundar in the Singarathoppu jail, where the jailor Appaguru ended up as a disciple of Vaikundar. Vaikundar was later set at liberty by the King.
After the death of Sree Moolam Thirunal in 1924, Sethu Lakshmi Bayi became regent (1924–1931), as the heir apparent, Sree Chithira Thirunal was then a minor, 12 years old.

In 1935, Travancore joined the Indian State Forces Scheme and a Travancore unit was named 1st Travancore Nair Infantry, Travancore State Forces. The unit was reorganised as an Indian State Infantry Battalion by Lieutenant Colonel H S Steward, who was appointed commandant of the Travancore State Forces.

The last ruling king of Travancore, Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma, reigned from 1931 to 1949. &quot;His reign marked revolutionary progress in the fields of education, defence, economy and society as a whole.&quot; He made the famous Temple Entry Proclamation on 12 November 1936, which opened all the Kshetrams (Hindu temples in Kerala) in Travancore to backward communities. This act won him praise from across India, most notably from Mahatma Gandhi. The first public transport system (Thiruvananthapuram–Mavelikkara) and telecommunication system (Thiruvananthapuram Palace–Mavelikkara Palace) were launched during his reign. He also started the industrialisation of the state, enhancing the role of the public sector. He introduced heavy industry in the state and established giant public sector undertakings. As many as twenty industries were established, mostly for utilizing the local raw materials such as rubber, ceramics, and minerals. A majority of the premier industries in Kerala even today, were established by Sree Chithira Thirunal. He patronized musicians, artists, dancers, and Vedic scholars. Sree Chithira Thirunal appointed, for the first time, an &quot;Art Advisor&quot; to the Government, Dr. G. H. Cousins. He also established a new form of University Training Corps, viz. &quot;Labour Corps&quot;, preceding the N.C.C, in the educational institutions. The expenses of the university were to be met fully by the government. Sree Chithira Thirunal also built a beautiful palace named &quot;Kowdiar Palace&quot;, finished in 1934, which was previously an old &quot;Naluektu&quot;, given by Sree Moolam Thirunal to his mother Sethu Parvathi Bayi in 1915.

A famine in 1943 claimed approximately 90,000 lives in Travancore.

However, his prime minister, Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer, was unpopular among the communists of Travancore. The tension between the Communists and Iyer led to minor riots. In one such riot in Punnapra-Vayalar in 1946, the Communist rioters established their own government in the area. This was put down by the Travancore Army and Navy. The prime minister issued a statement in June 1947 that Travancore would remain an independent country instead of joining the Indian Union; subsequently, an attempt was made on his life, following which he resigned and left for Madras, to be succeeded by Sri P.G.N. Unnithan. According to witnesses such as K.Aiyappan Pillai, constitutional adviser to the Maharaja and historians like A. Sreedhara Menon, the rioters and mob-attacks had no bearing on the decision of the Maharaja. After several rounds of discussion and negotiation between Sree Chithira Thirunal and V.P. Menon, the king agreed that the Kingdom should accede to the Indian Union on 12 August 1947. On 1 July 1949 the Kingdom of Travancore was merged with the Kingdom of Cochin and the short-lived state of Travancore-Kochi was formed.

On 11 July 1991, Maharaja Sree Chithira Thirunal suffered a stroke and was admitted to a hospital, where he died on 20 July. He had ruled Travancore for 67 years and at his death was one of the few surviving rulers of a first-class princely state in the old British Raj. He was also the last surviving Knight Grand Commander of both the Order of the Star of India and of the Order of the Indian Empire. He was succeeded as &quot;head&quot; of the Royal House as well as the &quot;Titular Maharajah&quot; of Travancore by his younger brother, Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma. The Government of India issued a stamp on 6 Nov 1991, commemorating the reforms that marked his reign in Travancore.

===Formation of Kerala===

The State of Kerala came into existence on 1 November 1956, with a governor appointed by the president of India as the head of state instead of a king. The king was stripped of all political powers and of the right to receive privy purses, according to the twenty-sixth amendment of the Indian constitution act of 31 July 1971. He died on 20 July 1991.

===Merger of Kanyakumari with Madras State===

Tamils lived in large numbers in the Thovalai, Agastheeswaram, Sengottai, Eraniel, Vilavancode, Kalkulam, Devikulam, Neyyattinkara, Thiruvananthapuram South and Thiruvananthapuram North taluks of erstwhile Travancore State. In the Tamil regions, Malayalam was the official language and there were only a few Tamil schools. So the Tamils met many hardships. The Travancore state government continued rejecting the requests of Tamils. During that period the Travancore State Congress favoured the idea of uniting all the Malayalam speaking regions and forming a &quot;Unified Kerala&quot;. In protest against this idea, many Tamil leaders vacated the party. Tamils gathered together at Nagercoil on 16 December 1945 under the leadership of Sam Nathaniel and formed the new political party All Travancore Tamilian Congress. That party pushed for the merger of Tamil regions in Travancore with Tamil Nadu. During the election campaign, clashes occurred between the Tamil Nadar community and the Malayali Nair community in Kalkulam – Vilavancode taluks. The police force suppressed the agitating Nadars. In February 1948 police opened fire and two Tamil-speaking Nadars were killed.

In the working committee meeting of Tamilian congress at Eraviputhur on 30 June 1946, the name of the political party was changed to Travancore Tamil Nadu Congress (T.T.N.C). T.T.N.C was popular among the Tamils living in Thovalai and Agateeswaram taluks. Ma. Po. Sivagnanam (Ma.Po.Si) was the only leader from Tamil Nadu who acted in favour of T.T.N.C. After the independence of India, State Assembly elections were announced in Travancore. As a consequence, T.T.N.C improved its popularity among Tamils. A popular and leading advocate from Vilavancode, A. Nesamony organised a meeting of his supporters at Allan Memorial Hall, Nagercoil on 8 September 1947. In that meeting it was declared that they must achieve their objective through their political organisation, the T.T.N.C. And T.T.N.C started gaining strength and momentum in Kalkulam – Vilavancode Taluks.

T.T.N.C won in 14 constituencies in the election to the State Legislative Assembly. Mr. A. Nesamony was elected as the legislative leader of the party. Then under his leadership, the awakened Tamil population was prepared to undergo any sacrifice to achieve their goal.

In 1950, a meeting was held at Palayamkottai to make compromises between state congress and T.T.N.C. The meeting met with failure and Mr. Sam Nathaniel resigned from the post of president of T.T.N.C Mr. P. Ramasamy Pillai, a strong follower of Mr. A. Nesamony was elected as the New President. The first general election of Independent India was held on 1952. T.T.N.C won 8 legislative assembly seats. Mr. A. Chidambaranathan became the minister on behalf of T.T.N.C in the coalition state government formed by the Congress. In the parliamentary Constituency Mr. A. Nesamony was elected as M.P. and in the Rajyasabha seat. Mr. A. Abdul Razak was elected as M.P. on behalf of T.T.N.C. In due course, accusing the Congress government for not showing enough care the struggle of the Tamils, T.T.N.C had broken away from the coalition and the Congress government lost the majority. So fresh elections were announced. In 1954 elections, T.T.N.C gained victory in 12 constituencies. 
Pattom Thanu Pillai was the chief minister for Thiru – Kochi legislative assembly. He engaged hard measures against the agitations of Tamils. Especially the Tamils at Devikulam – Peermedu regions went through the atrocities of Travancore Police force. Condemning the attitude of the police, T.T.N.C leaders from Nagercoil went to Munnar and participated in agitations against the prohibitive orders. The leaders were arrested and an uncalm atmosphere prevailed in South Travancore.

On 11 August, Liberation Day celebrations were held at many places in South Travancore. Public meetings and processions were organised. Communists also collaborated with the agitation programmes. Police opened fire at the processions in Thoduvetty (Martandam) and Puthukadai. Nine Tamil volunteers were killed and thousands of T.T.N.C and communist sympathizers were arrested in various parts of Tamil main land. At the end, Pattom Thanu Pillai&#x27;s ministry was toppled and normalcy returned to the Tamil regions. The central government had appointed Fazal Ali Commission(1953 dec) for the states reorganisation based on language. It submitted its report on 10 August 1955. Based on this report, Devikulam – Peermedu and Neyyattinkara Taluks were merged with Kerala state. On 1 November 1956 – four Taluks Thovalai, Agastheeswaram, Kalkulam, Vilavancode were recognised to form the New Kanyakumari District and merged with Tamil Nadu State. Half of Sengottai Taluk was merged with Tirunelveli District. The main demand of T.T.N.C was to merger the Tamil regions with Tamil Nadu and major part of its demand was realised. So T.T.N.C was dissolved thereafter.

===Retainment of Devikulam and Peerumedu Taluks in Kerala===

Apart from Kanyakumari district, the Taluks of Devikulam and Peermade in present-day Idukki district also had a Tamil-majority until late 1940&#x27;s. The T.T.N.C had also requested to merge these Taluks with Madras State. However it was due to some decisions of Pattom Thanu Pillai, who was the first prime minister of Travancore, that they retained in the modern-state of Kerala. Pattom came up with a colonisation project to re-engineer the demography of Cardamom Hills. His colonisation project was to relocate 8,000 Malayalam-speaking families into the Taluks of Devikulam and Peermade. About 50,000 acres in these Taluks, which were Tamil-majority area, were chosen for the colonisation project. As a victory of the Colonisation project done by post-independence Travancore, these two Taluks and a larger portion of Cardamom Hills retained in the state of Kerala, after States Reorganisation Act, 1956.

==Politics==

Under the direct control of the King, Travancore&#x27;s administration was headed by a Dewan assisted by the &quot;Neetezhutthu Pillay&quot; or secretary, &quot;Rayasom Pillay&quot; (assistant or under-secretary) and a number of &quot;Rayasoms&quot; or clerks along with &quot;Kanakku Pillamars&quot; (accountants). Individual districts were run by &quot;Sarvadhikaris&quot; under the supervision of Diwan, while dealings with the neighbouring states and Europeans was under the purview of the &quot;Valia Sarvahi&quot;, who signed treaties and agreements.

===Prime Ministers of Travancore (1948–49)===

==Administrative divisions==

In 1856, the princely state was sub-divided into three divisions, each of which was administered by a Divan Peishkar, with a rank equivalent to a District Collector in British India. These were the:
* Northern Travancore (Cottayam) comprising the talukas of Sharetalay, Vycome, Yetmanoor, Cottayam, Chunginacherry, Meenachil, Thodupolay, Moovatupolay, Kunnathnaud, Alangaud and Paravoor;
* Quilon (Central Travancore), comprising the talukas of Quilon, Amabalapulay, Chengannoor, Pandalam, Kunnattur, Karungapully, Kartikapully, Harippad and Mavelikaray
* Southern Travancore (Padmanabhapuram) comprising Thiruvananthapuram, Chirayinkir, Thovalay, Auguteeswarom, Kalculam, Eraneel, and Velavencode.

===Divisions according to the 1911 Census of Travancore===

====1. Padmanabhapuram Division====

The 1911 Census Report of Travancore states that Padmanabhapuram Division was the original seat of Travancore, where Thiruvithamcode and Padmanabhapuram are located. The report further states that a vast majority of this division was ethnic Tamils. Padamanabhapuram Division consisted of the present-day district of Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu. The report also states that the two southernmost Taluks of this division, namely Thovalai and Agastheeswaram, geographically too more resembles to Pandya Nadu of Tamil country and the eastern Coromandel Coast of the Madras Presidency than the rest of Malayalam country.

====2. Thiruvananthapuram Division====

It was the headquarters of Travancore since 1795. The Neyyattinkara taluk was a main seat of industry according the 1911 census report of Travancore. This division also contained many ethnic Tamils, mostly concentrated in the southern Taluks of Neyyattinkara and Thiruvananthapuram. The Trivandrum Division consisted of the present-day Thiruvananthapuram district excluding the British colony at Anchuthengu.

====3. Quilon Division====

Quilon was the capital of Venad and the largest port town in Travancore, and was also one of the oldest ports on Malabar Coast. The 1911 Census of Travancore states that it was from Quilon division onwards that the genuine country of Malayalam starts. However, the Sengottai taluk of this division which was earlier under Kottarakkara Thampuran, was a Tamil-majority region. Geographically too Sengottai resembled to Madurai and Pandya Nadu than rest of the Malayalam country. The Quilon division encompassed present-day Kollam district, Pathanamthitta district, Alappuzha district and some parts of Kottayam district.

====4. Kottayam Division====

It was situated in the northernmost area of Travancore. It was a pure Malayalam-speaking and geographical region. The Vembanad Lake was a speciality of this division.

====5. Devikulam Division====

It consisted most of the present-day Idukki district. It was also related to Pandya Nadu and Kongu Nadu. Devikulam division was Tamil-speaking region.

==Demographics==


Travancore had a population of 6,070,018 at the time of the 1941 Census of India.

===Religions===

===Languages===


==Currency==

Unlike the rest of India, Travancore divided the rupee into unique values, as represented on coins and stamps, as follows:

Cash and Chuckram coins are copper. Travancore Fanam and Travancore Rupee coins are silver.

==Culture==

Travancore was characterised by the popularity of its rulers among their subjects. The Kings of Travancore, unlike their counterparts in the other princely states of India, spent only a small portion of their state&#x27;s resources for personal use. This was in sharp contrast with some of the northern Indian kings. Since they spent most of the state&#x27;s revenue for the benefit of the public, they were naturally much loved by their subjects.

Violence rooted in religion or caste was uncommon in Travancore, but the barriers based on these parameters were rigid. Swami Vivekananda described Travancore as &quot;The Lunatic Asylum in India&quot; due to the level of caste discrimination. Vaikom Satyagraha point out the high-level casteism existed in Travancore.

Travancore was once a dominant feudal state during the Venad period, with the Nair aristocracy reaching its peak compared to other kingdoms. Later Nairs and Tamil Brahmins alone dominated the bureaucracy until the early 20th century. Many political ideologies (such as communism) and social reforms were not welcomed in Travancore, and in Punnapra, communist protesters were fired at. The Travancorean royal family are devout Hindus. Some practiced untouchability with British officers, European aristocrats and diplomats (for instance, Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, has reported that Maharaja Visakham Thirunal had to take bath after touching Richard&#x27;s wife, to remove ritual pollution, when they visited in 1880). The decline of the caste system began at the end of the 19th century due to a series of reformation movements. As a result, the Kingdom of Travancore became the region with the highest male literacy rate in India.

Unlike most of India, In South Canara and Travancore (and the rest of Kerala), the social status and freedom of women who belong to forward castes were relatively high. However, the Upper cloth revolt of 19th century is an exception to this. The women of backward castes had not the permission to wear upper cloth in Travancore. In some communities, the daughters inherited the property (though property was exclusively administered by men, their brothers) (until 1925), were educated, and had the right to divorce and remarry, but due to laws passed starting from 1925, by regent queen Sethu Lakshmi Bayi proper patriarchy was established and now women have relatively little rights.

<text>Ostprignitz-Ruppin is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the northwestern part of Brandenburg, Germany. Neighboring are (from north clockwise) the districts Müritz and Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the districts
Oberhavel and Havelland, the district Stendal in Saxony-Anhalt, and the district Prignitz.

==Geography==
The district consists of plain countryside northwest of Berlin. It is densely forested. Many rivers and lakes can be found in its western, its central and its northeastern part. The main river in the district is the Dosse.

==History==
The district has always been distinguishable from the West Prignitz, having been settled originally by Slavs from a different part of Mecklenburg. It was officially created in 1993 by merging the districts Kyritz, Neuruppin and Wittstock. The district roughly covers the same territory as the two historic districts Ostprignitz and Ruppin. Osprignitz was created in 1815 as one of two districts covering the former county Prignitz, and was split into the districts Kyritz, Pritzwalk and Wittstock in 1952. Also in 1952 the district Ruppin was renamed to Neuruppin and had to give part of its territory to the districts Kyritz and Gransee.

== Demography ==


==Coat of arms==
The eagle in the top of the coat of arms derives from the Counts of Arnstein, who ruled Ruppin in the 13th century. To the left is a fleur-de-lis representing the Counts von Plotho, a Wendish family who ruled Kyritz, where they had migrated from the Magdeburg area bringing German families such as the von Blumenthals with them. The mitre to the right symbolizes Wittstock, as Bishop Heinrich I made Wittstock the capital of the Prince-Bishopric of Havelberg.

The game was first released in 1983 and has gone through three revisions. As of 2024, the fifth edition (2024) is the latest version. The board game sold over 800,000 units by 2000.

From 2008 to 2017 Fantasy Flight Games produced &quot;Talisman&quot; under license from Games Workshop. Beginning in 2019 Pegasus Spiele took over production of &quot;Talisman&quot; and all of the game expansions.

== History ==
The game was created by Robert Harris for the amusement of himself and his friends. The game&#x27;s original objective was to become prefect of a boys&#x27; school. Changing the theme to fantasy, and naming the game &quot;Talisman&quot;, Harris signed a royalty publishing contract with Games Workshop, and the game was shown at Games Day 1983. After releasing the third edition, Games Workshop bought out his remaining interest.

The primary object of the game is to reach the Crown of Command at the centre of the board. The game contains three regions: Outer, Middle, and Inner. Players start in the Outer Region and try to progress to the Inner Region, through the Valley of Fire, and claim the Crown of Command. The game&#x27;s name, &quot;Talisman&quot;, refers to the rule that only characters possessing a Talisman card may enter the Valley of Fire.

=== First and second editions ===
Gameplay begins by selecting a character, or &quot;hero&quot;, at the beginning of the game. All characters have the attributes of Life, Strength, and Craft; all characters start with four lives and one bag of gold, but different characters start with different levels of Strength and Craft and have different special gameplay abilities. Players then take turns rolling a die, moving their characters, and following the board&#x27;s instructions for the locations where they land. Locations may activate events, initiate encounters, or provide &quot;Adventure&quot; cards. Adventure cards may be events, encounters, places, or treasure, and the cards sometimes remain on the board for other players to land on. Through gameplay, players search for a Talisman while increasing their character&#x27;s attributes to become strong enough to venture inward to the Crown of Command. Once at the Crown, a character can cast the &quot;Command Spell&quot;, causing opponents to lose one life each time it is successfully cast. The game is over when all opposing players have lost all their lives.

The second edition of &quot;Talisman&quot; made only cosmetic changes to the first edition. The 1st edition cards, featuring black and white art by Gary Chalk, were colourized, and the game board was changed from a single folded unit to four interlocking pieces. The box art also used a painting by Chris Achilleos instead of a pen-and-ink drawing.

==== Expansions ====

Games Workshop released several expansions for the game. Each expansion added new locations, characters and Adventure cards to the game, while some added new spells and objects. Some even allowed characters the opportunity to bypass the Valley of Fire and be transported directly to the Inner Region or the Crown of Command.

The first, &quot;Talisman Expansion Set&quot;, was released in 1986, followed by &quot;Talisman The Adventure&quot; which gave rules clarifications, alternative endings, character sheets, and additional slotted bases for up to 12 players.

The third expansion set, &quot;Talisman Dungeon&quot;, was released in 1987 and added a second &quot;Dungeon&quot; board to be placed alongside the main &quot;Talisman&quot; game board. The dungeon is laid out in a spiral pattern, leading to the Treasure Chamber in the centre. Some spells and character abilities are nullified or altered within the dungeon. Players encounter dungeon entrances on the main &quot;Talisman&quot; board, and, having entered the dungeon, navigate its traps and creatures to reach the fabulous treasure at its centre. On their next turn after reaching the Treasure Chamber, players are transported back to a location on the main board determined by a die roll. &quot;Dungeon&quot; can be played without the main game board by starting at the entrance to the dungeon and racing to the centre, with the first to arrive declared the winner.

&quot;Talisman Timescape&quot;, loosely based on the &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; science fiction setting, was released in 1988. The Timescape added a new board, representing a linked chain of different dimensions, as well as new heroes and objects with a science-fiction theme. Characters may enter the Timescape by encountering a Warp Gate, stumbling upon the Horrible Black Void, or by visiting special people such as the Enchantress or the Warlock. Characters cannot encounter each other while in the Timescape—they have been teleported to an entirely different reality. To move, players roll a die and consult a table to see where they are drawn to next.

The next expansion, &quot;Talisman City&quot;, was released in 1989, and replaces the single &quot;city&quot; space (in the Outer Region on the &quot;Talisman&quot; board) with an entire &quot;city&quot; board. Within the new city region there are more places to visit and additional items to purchase. Characters can have arrest warrant served on them in the city, either for having no gold or for fighting. If a character with a warrant encounters the City Patrol or Watch, they will be arrested and taken prisoner.

The final expansion, &quot;Talisman Dragons&quot;, was released in 1993 and added dragon-related cards and heroes.

=== Reception ===
Andy Blakeman reviewed &quot;Talisman&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;Obviously, this is a luck game, and the amount of luck required is sometimes very frustrating. However, quite an epic fantasy atmosphere builds up around the game, and it plays efficiently and cleanly. If you like fantasy boardgames, then this is quite a good example.&quot;

In the April 1984 edition of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; (Issue 52), Alan Paull liked the high quality of the game components, but thought that games went on for far too long, and winning seemed to be a matter of luck. Paull gave the game a below-average rating of 6 out of 10, concluding, &quot;&quot;Talisman&quot; is not a bad game. If it was shorter, it would make an enjoyable family game.&quot;

In the March–April 1985 edition of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; (Issue No. 73), Matthew Costello commented that &quot;This is an ideal fantasy game for your non-gaming friends or relatives. There&#x27;s enough familiar &#x27;boardgame&#x27; here so that they&#x27;ll be comfortable, but &quot;Talisman&quot; adds subtle and challenging elements from the FRP world.&quot;

In the December 1993 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 200), Allen Varney considered &quot;Talisman&quot; a classic, calling it &quot;a nutty romp that calls for lots of luck, a laid-back attitude, and tolerance for getting turned into a toad. You won’t believe how often this game toadifies you.&quot;

&quot;Talisman&quot; was chosen for inclusion in the 2007 book &quot;Hobby Games: The 100 Best&quot;. Shane Lacy Hensley commented that the very name of &quot;Talisman&quot; &quot;conjures a smile – if not a nerdish giggle – from most thirty-something gamers as they recall countless high school and college days playing this simple and addictive game.&quot;

=== Third Edition ===
The third edition made numerous changes to the artistic design and mechanics of the game.

Games Workshop released the third edition for &quot;Talisman&quot; in the Spring of 1994. The third edition contained a new board which included many of the same locations as the first and second editions, but had a new art treatment. The Inner Region became &quot;The Wizard&#x27;s Tower&quot;. In the Tower, the heroes encounter a couple of traps and tests, through a set of Tower cards, before combat with the Dragon King, who must be defeated to win the game.

The first and second editions used cards to represent the characters in the game. The cards were placed on plastic bases (called &quot;slotta bases&quot;) and moved about the board as the game was played (paintable metal miniature figures for the characters could be purchased separately). The Third Edition did away with the stand-up character cards and instead included plastic miniatures. It removed many characters from the Second Edition and added new ones which tied the world of &quot;Talisman&quot; more closely to the &quot;Warhammer Fantasy&quot; settings games.

The Third edition also added an additional character attribute, Experience, not unlike a role-playing game to help the character develop their powers. By defeating enemies (hostile monsters, but not other player characters), the characters accrue experience points. The experience they gain is equal to the defeated enemies&#x27; craft or strength. These experience points can then be redeemed for gold, strength, craft or life at the cost of seven experience points for one. The earlier editions used a similar, but more limited feature which applied to strength.

==== Expansions ====
Three expansions were released and some extra characters were printed through &quot;White Dwarf&quot; magazine. Each of the expansions used &quot;realm dice&quot; (a die marked from 1–4) which made movement slower in the realms. The realms were normally accessible from only one square on the main board.

The first expansion, &quot;City of Adventure&quot;, was released in 1994 added two boards: the City board (based on, but more compact than, the 2nd Edition &quot;Talisman City&quot; expansion) and a Forest realm.

&quot;Dungeon of Doom&quot; was released later in 1994 and added 2 additional game boards: a &quot;Dungeon realm&quot; and a &quot;Mountain realm&quot; which fit around the 2 corners of the original board not used by the &quot;City of Adventure&quot; expansion. It was based loosely on the expansion &quot;Talisman Dungeon&quot; for the Second Edition. At the end of the Mountain realm and Dungeon realms there were valuable treasures; reaching and defeating the Eagle King of the Mountain realm entitled the player to move to any square on the board, including the causeway that connected the Wizard&#x27;s Tower to the middle board.

The 1995 expansion pack, &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Tower&quot; added a playing board, a card tower surmounted by a dragon model, extra rules, a realm die and four additional characters. Two extra characters were printed in &quot;White Dwarf&quot; to coincide with its release. The Dragon&#x27;s Tower replaced the normal endgame of entering the centre square. Movement through the tower is slower (a die marked only 1-4 is used) and used its own deck of adventure cards.

====Reception====
Chris McDonough reviewed &quot;Talisman Boxed Game&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #49 (Nov., 1994), rating it a 4 out of 5 and stated that &quot;Despite &quot;Talisman&quot;&#x27;s [high] price tag, however, this really is one of the most fun games I have played. So, if money is no object, run out and buy it. if not, [the price] is a lot of dough to pay for the contents of this box. The only significant additions to the old [...] set are the plastic miniatures. That&#x27;s a lot to pay for figures.&quot;

=== Fourth Edition ===

On January 8, 2007, Black Industries (an imprint of Games Workshop&#x27;s publishing division, BL Publishing) announced the launch of a new edition of &quot;Talisman&quot;, which was released on the confirmed release date of October 5, 2007. This new edition is based around the second edition, incorporating some rule revisions from the Third, as well as a larger six-piece board. The game board is about 30% larger than the second edition board and has an art treatment in-line with contemporary fantasy role-playing games from Games Workshop. The game comes with 14 playable characters: Priest, Monk, Prophetess, Minstrel, Elf, Wizard, Sorceress, Assassin, Ghoul, Warrior, Thief, Druid, Dwarf, and Troll.

At the GAMA Trade Show, it was announced that there would be expansions, but no details were provided at that time.

A few copies of the fourth edition were sold at the Games Day 2007 on September 23, 2007. Numerous images of the pre-production version of the game were posted on Board Game Geek before its general release on October 5, 2007.

=== Revised Fourth Edition ===
On 28 January 2008 Black Industries announced that they would no longer be publishing board games, including &quot;Talisman&quot;. On 22 February 2008, Fantasy Flight Games announced that they would be taking over the license for &quot;Talisman&quot;, continuing to produce the 4th edition and its expansions. Fantasy Flight Games published the &quot;Talisman Revised 4th Edition&quot; on 17 December 2008, as well as an upgrade pack with updated cards and miniatures for people who bought the original 4th edition.

==== Expansions ====
Through 2016, Fantasy Flight produced numerous expansions to Talisman. Most came with new characters and one or more new endings for the game.
=== Fifth Edition ===
In February 2024, it was announced that a 5th edition of the game would be released on August 1, with preorders beginning May 21, 2024. On May 23, 2024, Nomad Games&#x27; website stated that a Talisman Digital Edition 5th edition for Steam was in the works and players could wishlist it on their Steam accounts.

=== Video game versions ===
A version of the game for the ZX Spectrum, &quot;Talisman&quot;, was released in 1985.

In 2007, Capcom announced plans to release a version of &quot;Talisman&quot; for the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, and Microsoft Windows platforms. This product was originally to coincide with the release of the Fourth Edition of the board game (Q4 2007), but on October 12, 2008, Capcom&#x27;s Senior Director of Strategic Planning announced the cessation of development, due to a &quot;misfire&quot; and the costs of transferring the project to new developers. He stated that the rights to &quot;Talisman&quot; had reverted to Games Workshop. This digital version would have supported up to four players, either online or offline. Including 25 different characters from the game and its expansions, it also promised additional downloadable content, such as extra characters and alternative ending conditions.

On November 15, 2012, Nomad Games Ltd released &quot;Talisman: Prologue&quot;, a single-player video game version of &quot;Talisman&quot;.

On February 12, 2014, a multiplayer version of the game called &quot;&quot; was released on Steam by Nomad Games and later ported to the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, along with Android and iOS mobile devices.

Nomad Games released &quot;Talisman: Origins&quot; on May 16, 2019 for the PC, Mac, iOS, and Android.

== Legacy ==
There are several active communities for the game on the Internet and many individuals have produced their own versions of the game, featuring custom expansions complete with custom Adventure cards, characters and objects.

Random Games attempted to convert &quot;Talisman&quot; into a Microsoft Windows video game. However, they lost support from their publisher and could not find another before they went out of business.

An unofficial Talisman video game was released in July 2008 but has since been taken down after Games Workshop asserted its intellectual property rights.

In 2012, Fantasy Flight Games announced Relic, a board game using the &quot;Talisman&quot; rules system and set in Games Workshop&#x27;s Warhammer 40,000 universe, available in early 2013.

&quot;Talisman: Batman&quot; was released in 2019, allowing players to play as several members of Batman&#x27;s rogues gallery attempting to escape from Arkham Asylum.

== International editions ==

&quot;Talisman&quot; was translated into several languages: Finnish (2nd Edition), French (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th revised Edition), German (2nd, 3rd and 4th revised Edition), Italian (2nd and 4th revised Edition), Czech (2nd Edition and 4th revised Edition), Slovak (2nd Edition), Hebrew (1st, 2nd and 4th Edition), Swedish (1st and 2nd Edition), Polish (2nd and 4th Edition), and Hungarian (4th Edition). All save the Polish versions were only translations of the original game.

=== Hebrew Edition ===
The Hebrew edition was published by Meytzuv in Israel. It was published in both 1st and 2nd edition.

Years after Meytzuv went bankrupt, the game was republished by Lemada and is still played by many fans in Israel. During the Champions&#x27; Hall 2nd convention – ChampsCon 2006.

In 2015, Monkey Time, the distributor of Fantasy Flight Games in Israel, translated the 4th revised edition of the game and will publish it instead of the 2nd edition still in the stores in Israel.

=== Polish Edition ===
The Polish edition, published in 1989 by BPiRF Sfera (Biuro Promocji i Reklamy Fantastyki Sfera) company as &quot;Magia i Miecz&quot; (&quot;Magic and Sword&quot;) was based on 1st edition rules, and was the only edition with new artwork for all cards. All 2nd Edition expansions were translated, although some were bundled together (&quot;Talisman Expansion&quot; cards came together with the main set, and &quot;The Adventure&quot; cards with &quot;Dungeon&quot;). Furthermore, the Polish edition had one additional expansion, &quot;Jaskinia&quot; (&quot;The Cave&quot;), with a new board, cards and heroes. The Cave had some tough monsters and only very advanced heroes could think of going inside.

When Sfera lost the &quot;Talisman&quot; license from Games Workshop, they published an unauthorized new version of the game: &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Magic Sword&quot;). The main board was changed (it had four regions, and &quot;The Beast&quot; (a copy of the Dragon King alternative ending), instead of the Crown of Command), the heroes and cards were different (although many were just copies of the original ones with changed names), and the terminology was changed (event cards instead of adventure cards, sorcery cards instead of spell cards, etc.). &quot;The Magic Sword&quot; had new graphics (no images from the Polish &quot;Talisman&quot; were kept, except for the re-edition of Cave, as all expansions were re-released under new names) which was not well received as compared to &quot;Talisman.&quot; &quot;Magic Sword&quot; also had one more board, &quot;Krypta upiorów&quot; (&quot;The Crypt of Wraiths&quot;), with some innovations. &quot;Magic Sword&quot; was not well received by &quot;Talisman&quot; fans, although it appealed to many new players. Later, a second edition of this game, with improved graphics, was released (this time only the main set).

Revised 4th Edition was translated and published in Poland under the name &quot;Talisman. Magia i Miecz&quot;, owing to popularity of &quot;Magia i Miecz&quot; in the 1990s.

== Popular culture ==
In several episodes of the television show &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, some of the main characters can be seen playing &quot;Talisman&quot; (4th Edition) in Sheldon and Leonard&#x27;s living room.

<text>The Dice Man is a 1971 novel by American novelist George Cockcroft, writing under the pen name &quot;Luke Rhinehart&quot;. The book tells the story of a psychiatrist who makes daily decisions based on the casting of a die. Cockcroft describes the origin of the title idea variously in interviews, once recalling a college &quot;quirk&quot; he and friends used to decide &quot;what they were going to do that night&quot; based on a die-roll, or sometimes to decide between mildly mischievous pranks. 

At the time of its publication, &quot;[i]t was not clear whether the book was fiction or autobiography&quot;, all the more because the protagonist and the alleged author were eponymous; both were described as having the same profession (psychiatry), and elements of the described lives of both (e.g., places of residence, date of birth) were also in common; hence, curiosity over its authorship have persisted since its publication. Years later, in 1999, Emmanuel Carrère, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, presented a long-form expose on Cockroft and the relationship between author and legend, disclosing him as a life-long English professor living &quot;in an old farmhouse with a yard that slopes down to a duck pond&quot;, a husband of fifty-years, father of three, and a caregiver to a special-needs child.

The book was not initially successful, but gradually became considered a cult classic. Writing in 2017 for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Tanya Gold noted that &quot;over the course of 45 years&quot; it was still in print, had become famous, had devoted fans, and had &quot;sold more than 2m copies in multiple languages&quot;. It initially sold poorly in the United States, but well in Europe, particularly England, Sweden, Denmark, and Spain. Cockroft continued the premise of the book in two other novels, &quot;Adventures of Wim&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Search for the Dice Man&quot; (1993), and in a companion title, &quot;The Book of the Die&quot; (2000), none of which achieved the commercial success of &quot;The Dice Man&quot;.
