<text>David Edward Jenkins (26 January 19254 September 2016) was a Church of England cleric and theologian. He was Bishop of Durham from 1984 until 1994. After his retirement, he continued to serve as an honorary assistant bishop in the Diocese of Ripon and Leeds.

==Early life==
Jenkins was born in Bromley, Kent, to Lionel Jenkins, who worked in a bank, and his wife Dora (née Page). His family were Methodist. He was educated at St Dunstan&#x27;s College, Catford. Having attended a Church of England ordination conference at Bangalore during his service in India, he took up a scholarship to enter Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1954.

During the Second World War, he was called up in the autumn of 1943. He was commissioned in the Royal Artillery after officer training at Harrogate in April 1945. At the end of the war he was a staff officer at General Headquarters in India. In 1946 he was attached to the 10th Indian Field Regiment, Royal Indian Artillery before its disbandment. He demobilised as a captain in 1947.

==Ordained ministry==
Jenkins trained for ordination at Lincoln Theological College. He was ordained in the Church of England as a deacon in 1953, and as a priest in 1954 by the Bishop of Birmingham. He served as curate at St Philip&#x27;s Cathedral, Birmingham.

He was chaplain and Fellow of Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford (1954–1969), and a lecturer in theology at the University of Oxford (1955–1969). He also worked for the World Council of Churches and the William Temple Foundation. He was appointed Professor of Theology at the University of Leeds in 1979, and was made Emeritus Professor when he left Leeds in 1984. In addition to his teaching appointments Jenkins had been Examining Chaplain to the Bishops of Lichfield (1956–69), Newcastle upon Tyne (1957–69), Bristol (1958–84), Wakefield (1978–84) and Bradford (1979–84).

==Bishop of Durham==

His selection as Bishop of Durham was controversial due to allegations that he held heterodox beliefs, particularly regarding the virgin birth and the bodily resurrection. Between his selection and consecration, he said in an interview: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t put it past God to arrange a virgin birth if he wanted. But I don&#x27;t think he did.&quot; His widely quoted comment about the resurrection of Christ being &quot;just a conjuring trick with bones&quot; is a misrepresentation; his actual words as recorded on television say the reverse: the resurrection is &quot;not&quot; a conjuring trick with bones. The original line appears to have been &quot;[the Resurrection] is real. That&#x27;s the point. All I said was &#x27;literally physical&#x27;. I was very careful in the use of language. After all, a conjuring trick with bones proves only that somebody&#x27;s very clever at a conjuring trick with bones.&quot; According to his BBC obituary, he considered &quot;the resurrection was not a single event, but a series of experiences that gradually convinced people that Jesus&#x27;s life, power, purpose and personality were actually continuing.&quot;

Nonetheless, Jenkins&#x27; public pronouncements caused great disquiet, particularly within his own diocese. As a result of doubts concerning his elevation to bishop, a petition signed by more than 12,000 people was submitted to the Archbishop of York.

Three days after his consecration as bishop on 6 July 1984, York Minster was struck by lightning, resulting in a disastrous fire which some interpreted as a sign of divine wrath at Jenkins&#x27;s appointment.

As a bishop, Jenkins was known for his willingness to speak his mind. In 1989 he made an extended appearance on the television discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot;, alongside among others Steven Rose, Frank Cioffi, Dorothy Rowe and Michael Bentine.

After leaving office in 1994 he continued to voice his opinions, such as in a BBC interview in 2003.

==Political views==

Jenkins also became identified with opposition to the policies of the Thatcher and Major governments and subsequently was a critic of New Labour. He argued that what these governments shared was a dogmatic faith in the market which had many pseudo-religious elements to it. This led him to write at length about what he saw as the intellectual deficiencies of economic theory and market theorising and its pseudo-theological character.

His book &quot;Market Whys and Human Wherefores: Thinking Again About Markets, Politics, and People&quot; was an extended layman&#x27;s critique of economic theory and its application to policy, in which he described himself as an &#x27;anxious idiot&#x27; using the latter term in its original meaning of an ordinary person with no professional expertise. It nevertheless diagnosed many of the problems with economic theory and its application to a deregulated economy that would later be seen as prescient in the light of the global economic crisis of 2007 onwards. In &quot;Dilemmas of Freedom&quot;, he also challenged the idea that markets created freedom. In &quot;Price, Cost, Excellence and Worth: Can the idea of a university survive the force of the market?&quot; he similarly questioned whether they were compatible with the idea of a university while in &quot;The Market and Health Care&quot;, he addressed the issue of health care in a similar vein.

==Controversies==

In 2005, he became one of the first clerics in the Church of England to participate to the public blessing of a civil partnership between two homosexual men, one of whom was a Church of England priest.

In 2006, Jenkins was banned from preaching in some of his local churches after reportedly &quot;swearing&quot; in a sermon, using the words &quot;bloody&quot; and &quot;damn&quot;. In 2002 he published his memoir &quot;The Calling of a Cuckoo: Not Quite an Autobiography&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1949, Jenkins married Stella Mary Peet, known as Mollie. She died in 2008. The couple had two sons and two daughters. His daughter Rebecca was his assistant and PR officer while he was the Bishop of Durham. Jenkins died on 4 September 2016 at the age of 91.

<doc id="162693" wikidata="Q958470" url="?curid=162693" title="Templeton College, Oxford">
<text>Templeton College was one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford, England. It was an all-graduate college, concentrating on the recruitment of students in business and management studies. In 2008, the college merged with Green College, Oxford to form Green Templeton College, based on the existing Green College site.

==History==
The college was founded in 1965 as the Oxford Centre for Management Studies. The college was based at Egrove Park in Kennington, south of Oxford. Its buildings were opened in 1969 and were listed in 1999.

It was renamed Templeton College in 1983 as a result of a donation from Sir John Templeton, in honour of his parents, Harvey Maxwell and Vella Handly Templeton. The intention was to raise professional standards in British management. The endowment was one of the largest endowments ever made to a British educational establishment. Initially a &quot;society of entitlement&quot; in the university, Templeton College began admitting graduate students in 1984 and became a full graduate college of the university by royal charter in 1995.

In November 2005, the college transferred its executive education business to the Saïd Business School.

On 26 February 2007, two bombs were found planted at Templeton College. An animal rights activist was convicted of conspiracy to commit arson in February 2009.

On 3 July 2007, it was announced that Templeton College would merge with Green College, Oxford with effect from 1 October 2008 to form Green Templeton College, Oxford, based on the existing Green College site. Templeton&#x27;s former site at Egrove Park remains in use by the Saïd Business School as its Executive Education Centre.

<text>&quot;&#x27;&quot; or &quot;&#x27;&quot; is a Latin hymn in honor of John the Baptist, written in Horatian Sapphics with text traditionally attributed to Paulus Diaconus, the eighth-century Lombard historian. It is famous for its part in the history of musical notation, in particular solmization. The hymn belongs to the tradition of Gregorian chant.

It is not known who wrote the melody. Guido of Arezzo possibly composed it, but he more likely used an existing melody. A variant of the melody appears in an eleventh-century musical setting of Horace&#x27;s poem &quot;Ode to Phyllis&quot; (4.11) recorded in a manuscript in France.

==Structure==
The hymn uses classical metres: the Sapphic stanza consisting of three Sapphic hendecasyllables followed by an adonius (a type of dimeter).

The chant is useful for teaching singing because of the way it uses successive notes of the scale: the first six musical phrases of each stanza begin on a successively higher notes of the hexachord, giving &quot;ut–re–mi–fa–so–la&quot;; though &quot;ut&quot; is replaced by &quot;do&quot; in modern solfège. The naming of the notes of the hexachord by the first syllable of each hemistich (half line of verse) of the first verse is usually attributed to Guido of Arezzo. Guido, who was active in the eleventh century, is regarded as the father of modern musical notation. He made use of clefs (C &amp; F clefs) and invented the &quot;ut-re-mi-fa-sol-la&quot; notation. The hymn does not help with the seventh tone as the last line, &quot;Sancte Iohannes&quot;, breaks the ascending pattern. The syllable &quot;si&quot;, for the seventh tone, was added in the 18th century.

The first stanza is:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;Ut queant laxīs
resonāre fibrīs
Mīra gestōrum
famulī tuōrum,
Solve pollūtī
labiī reātum,
Sāncte Iohannēs.&lt;/poem&gt;

It may be translated: &quot;So that your servants may, with loosened voices, resound the wonders of your deeds, clean the guilt from our stained lips, O Saint John.&quot;

A paraphrase by Cecile Gertken, OSB (1902–2001) preserves the key syllables and loosely evokes the original meter:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;Do let our voices
resonate most purely,
miracles telling,
far greater than many;
so let our tongues be
lavish in your praises,
Saint John the Baptist.&lt;/poem&gt;

&quot;Ut&quot; is now mostly replaced by &quot;Do&quot; in solfège due to the latter&#x27;s open sound, in deference to Italian theorist Giovanni Battista Doni. The word &quot;Ut&quot; is still in use to name the C-clef. The seventh note was not part of the medieval hexachord and does not occur in this melody, and it was originally called &quot;si&quot; from &quot;Sancte Ioannes&quot; (Johannes). In the nineteenth century, Sarah Glover, an English music teacher, renamed &quot;si&quot; to &quot;ti&quot; so that every syllable might be notated by its initial letter. But this was not adopted in countries using fixed do solfège: in Romance languages &quot;si&quot; is used alike for B and B flat, and no separate syllable is required for sharp &quot;sol&quot;.
==Liturgical use==
In the Roman Rite, the hymn is sung in the Divine Office on June 24, the Feast of the Nativity of John the Baptist. The full hymn is divided into three parts, with &quot;Ut queant laxis&quot; sung at Vespers, &quot;Antra deserti&quot; sung at Matins, &quot;O nimis felix&quot; sung at Lauds, and doxologies added after the first two parts.

<text>Heteronormativity is the privileging of heterosexuality as the normative human sexuality. It assumes the gender binary (i.e., that there are only two distinct, opposite genders) and that sexual and marital relations are most fitting between people of opposite sex.

Heteronormativity creates and upholds a social hierarchy based on sexual orientation with the practice and belief that heterosexuality is deemed as the societal norm. A heteronormative view, therefore, involves alignment of biological sex, sexuality, gender identity and gender roles. Heteronormativity has been linked to heterosexism and homophobia, and the effects of societal heteronormativity on lesbian, gay and bisexual individuals have been described as heterosexual or &quot;straight&quot; privilege.

==Etymology==
Michael Warner popularized the term in 1991, in one of the first major works of queer theory. The concept&#x27;s roots are in Gayle Rubin&#x27;s notion of the &quot;sex/gender system&quot; and Adrienne Rich&#x27;s notion of compulsory heterosexuality. From the outset, theories of heteronormativity included a critical look at gender; Warner wrote that &quot;every person who comes to a queer self-understanding knows in one way or another that her stigmatization is intricated with gender. ... Being queer ... means being able, more or less articulately, to challenge the common understanding of what gender difference means.&quot; Lauren Berlant and Warner further developed these ideas in their seminal essay, &quot;Sex in Public&quot;.

==Relation to marriage and the nuclear family==
Modern family structures in the past and present vary from what was typical of the 1950s nuclear family. In the United States, the families of the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century were characterized by the death of one or both parents for many American children. In 1985, the United States is estimated to have been home to approximately 2.5 million post-divorce, stepfamily households containing children. During the late 1980s, almost 20% of families with children headed by a married couple were stepfamilies.

Over the past three decades, rates of divorce, single parenting, and cohabitation have risen precipitously. Nontraditional families (which diverge from &quot;a middle-class family with a bread-winning father and a stay-at-home mother, married to each other and raising their biological children&quot;) constitute the majority of families in the United States and Canada today. Shared Earning/Shared Parenting Marriage (also known as Peer Marriage) where two heterosexual parents are both providers of resources and nurturers to children has become popular. Modern families may also have single-parent headed families which can be caused by divorce, separation, death, families who have two parents who are not married but have children, or families with same-sex parents. With artificial insemination, surrogate mothers, and adoption, families do not have to be formed by the heteronormative biological union of a male and a female. 

The consequences of these changes for the adults and children involved are heavily debated. In a 2009 Massachusetts spousal benefits case, developmental psychologist Michael Lamb testified that parental sexual orientation does not negatively affect childhood development. &quot;Since the end of the 1980s... it has been well established that children and adolescents can adjust just as well in nontraditional settings as in traditional settings,&quot; he argued. However, columnist Maggie Gallagher argues that heteronormative social structures are beneficial to society because they are optimal for the raising of children. Australian-Canadian ethicist Margaret Somerville argues that &quot;giving same-sex couples the right to found a family unlinks parenthood from biology&quot;. Recent criticisms of this argument have been made by Timothy Laurie, who argues that both intersex conditions and infertility rates have always complicated links between biology, marriage, and child-rearing.

Heteronormative temporality, a subset of heteronormativity, posits that the ideal societal trajectory involves achieving heterosexual marriage as life&#x27;s ultimate goal. This ideology imposes societal expectations that encourage individuals to conform to traditional roles within a nuclear family structure: seeking an opposite-sex partner, entering into heterosexual marriage, and raising children. Heteronormative temporality promotes abstinence-only until marriage. Many American parents adhere to this heteronormative narrative and teach it to their children. According to Amy T. Schalet, it seems that the bulk of parent-child sex education revolves around abstinence-only practices in the United States, but this differs in other parts of the world. Similarly, George Washington University Professor, Abby Wilkerson, discusses how the healthcare and medicinal industries reinforce the views of heterosexual marriage to promote heteronormative temporality. The concept of heteronormative temporality extends beyond heterosexual marriage to include a pervasive system where heterosexuality is seen as a standard, and anything outside of that realm is not tolerated. Wilkerson explains that it dictates aspects of everyday life such as nutritional health, socio-economic status, personal beliefs, and traditional gender roles.

==Transgressions==
===Intersex people===

Intersex people have biological characteristics that are ambiguously either male or female. If such a condition is detected, intersex people in most present-day societies are almost always assigned a normative sex shortly after birth. Surgery (usually involving modification to the genitalia) is often performed in an attempt to produce an unambiguously male or female body, with the parents&#x27;—rather than the individual&#x27;s—consent. The child is then usually raised and enculturated as a cisgender heterosexual member of the assigned sex, which may or may not match their emergent gender identity throughout life or some remaining sex characteristics (for example, chromosomes, genes or internal sex organs).

===Transgender people===
Transgender people experience a mismatch between their gender identity and their assigned sex. &quot;Transgender&quot; is also an umbrella term because, it includes trans men and trans women who may be binary or non-binary, and also includes genderqueer people (whose identities are not exclusively masculine or feminine, but may, for example, be bigender, pangender, genderfluid, etc.). Some authors also believe that the trans umbrella includes &quot;transsexual&quot; people, who have transitioned through hormonal replacement therapy and sex reassignment surgery.

Other definitions include third-gender people as transgender or conceptualize transgender people as a third gender, and infrequently the term is defined very broadly to include cross-dressers.

Some transgender people seek sex reassignment therapy, and may not behave according to the gender role imposed by society. Some societies consider transgender behavior a crime worthy of capital punishment, including Saudi Arabia and many other nations. In some cases, gay or lesbian people were forced to undergo sex change treatments to &quot;fix&quot; their sex and gender in some European countries during the 20th century, and in South Africa in the 1970s and 1980s.

In some countries, including North American and European countries, certain forms of violence against transgender people may be tacitly endorsed when prosecutors and juries refuse to investigate, prosecute, or convict those who perform the murders and beatings. Other societies have considered transgender behavior as a psychiatric illness serious enough to justify institutionalization.

In medical communities with these restrictions, patients have the option of either suppressing transsexual behavior and conforming to the norms of their birth sex (which may be necessary to avoid social stigma or even violence) or by adhering strictly to the norms of their &quot;new&quot; sex in order to qualify for sex reassignment surgery and hormonal treatments. Attempts to achieve an ambiguous or &quot;alternative&quot; gender identity would not be supported or allowed. Sometimes sex reassignment surgery is a requirement for a legal sex change, and often &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot; are the only choices available, even for intersex and non-binary people. For governments which allow only heterosexual marriages, official gender changes can have implications for related rights and privileges, such as child custody, inheritance, and medical decision-making.

==Homonormativity==

Homonormativity is a term which can refer to the privileging of homosexuality or the assimilation of heteronormative ideals and constructs into LGBTQ culture and individual identity. Specifically, Catherine Connell states that homonormativity &quot;emphasizes commonality with the norms of heterosexual culture, including marriage, monogamy, procreation, and productivity&quot;. The term is almost always used in its latter sense, and was used prominently by Lisa Duggan in 2003, although transgender studies scholar Susan Stryker, in her article &quot;Transgender History, Homonormativity, and Disciplinary&quot;, noted that it was also used by transgender activists in the 1990s in reference to the imposition of gay/lesbian norms over the concerns of transgender people. Transgender people were not included in healthcare programs combating the AIDS epidemic, and were often excluded from gay/lesbian demonstrations in Washington, D.C. Homonormativity has also grown to include transnormativity, or &quot;the pressure put on trans people to conform to traditional, oppositional sexist understandings of gender&quot;. In addition, homonormativity can be used today to cover or erase the radical politics of the queer community during the Gay Liberation Movement, by not only replacing these politics with more conservative goals like marriage equality and adoption rights, but also commercializing and mainstreaming queer subcultures.

According to Penny Griffin, Politics and International Relations lecturer at the University of New South Wales, homonormativity upholds neoliberalism rather than critiquing the enforcement of its values of monogamy, procreation, and binary gender roles as inherently heterosexist and racist. In this sense, homonormativity is deeply intertwined with the expansion and maintenance of the internationally structured and structuring capitalistic worldwide system. Duggan asserts that homonormativity fragments LGBT communities into hierarchies of worthiness, and that LGBT people that come the closest to mimicking heteronormative standards of gender identity are deemed most worthy of receiving rights. She also states that LGBT individuals at the bottom of this hierarchy (e.g. bisexual people, trans people, non-binary people, people of non-Western genders, intersex people, queers of color, queer sex workers) are seen as an impediment to this class of homonormative individuals receiving their rights. For example, one empirical study found that in the Netherlands, transgender people and other gender non-conforming LGBT people are often looked down upon within their communities for not acting &quot;normal&quot;. Those who do assimilate often become invisible in society and experience constant fear and shame about the non-conformers within their communities. Stryker referenced theorist Jürgen Habermas and his view of the public sphere allowing for individuals to come together, as a group, to discuss diverse ideologies and by excluding the non-conforming LGBTQ community, society as a whole were undoubtedly excluding the gender-variant individuals from civic participation.

==Criticism==
Critics of heteronormative attitudes, such as Cathy J. Cohen, Michael Warner, and Lauren Berlant, argue that such attitudes are oppressive, stigmatizing, marginalizing of perceived deviant forms of sexuality and gender, and make self-expression more challenging when that expression does not conform to the norm. Heteronormativity describes how social institutions and policies reinforce the presumption that people are heterosexual and that gender and sex are natural binaries. Heteronormative culture privileges heterosexuality as normal and natural and fosters a climate where LGBT individuals are discriminated against in marriage, tax codes, and employment. Following Berlant and Warner, Laurie and Stark also argue that the domestic &quot;intimate sphere&quot; becomes &quot;the unquestioned non‐place that anchors heteronormative public discourses, especially those concerning marriage and adoption rights&quot;.

According to cultural anthropologist Gayle Rubin, heteronormativity in mainstream society creates a &quot;sex hierarchy&quot; that graduates sexual practices from morally &quot;good sex&quot; to &quot;bad sex&quot;. The hierarchy considers reproductive, monogamous sex between committed heterosexuals as &quot;good&quot;, whereas any sexual act or individual who falls short of this standard is labeled as &quot;bad&quot;. Specifically, this standard categorizes long-term committed gay couples and non-monogamous/sexually active gay individuals between the two poles. Patrick McCreery, lecturer at New York University, argues that this hierarchy explains how gay people are stigmatized for socially &quot;deviant&quot; sexual practices that are often practiced by straight people as well, such as consumption of pornography or sex in public places. There are many studies of sexual orientation discrimination on college campuses.

McCreery states that this heteronormative hierarchy carries over to the workplace, where gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals face discrimination such as anti-homosexual hiring policies or workplace discrimination that often leaves &quot;lowest hierarchy&quot; individuals such as transsexual people vulnerable to the most overt discrimination and unable to find work.

Applicants and current employees can be legally passed over or fired for being non-heterosexual or perceived as non-heterosexual in many countries. An example of this practice is found in the case of the chain restaurant Cracker Barrel, which garnered national attention in 1991 after they fired an employee for being openly lesbian, citing their policy that employees with &quot;sexual preferences that fail to demonstrate normal heterosexual values were inconsistent with traditional American values.&quot; Workers such as the fired employee and effeminate male waiters (allegedly described as the true targets), were legally fired by work policies &quot;transgressing&quot; against &quot;normal&quot; heteronormative culture. Another study indicates that heteronormativity extends to social media platforms as well. While these channels are often seen as &quot;safe spaces&quot; for LGBT individuals, they can also perpetuate heteronormative expectations from work that were previously confined to face-to-face interactions.

Mustafa Bilgehan Ozturk analyzes the interconnectivity of heteronormativity and sexual employment discrimination by tracing the impact of patriarchal practices and institutions on the workplace experiences of lesbian, gay, and bisexual employees in a variety of contexts in Turkey. This further demonstrates the specific historicity and localized power/knowledge formations that give rise to physical, professional, and psycho-emotive acts of prejudice against sexual minorities. 

Certain religions have been known to promote heteronormative beliefs through their teachings. According to Sociology professors Samuel Perry and Kara Snawder from The University of Oklahoma, multiple research studies in the past have shown that there can be and often is a link between the religious beliefs of Americans and homophobic behavior. Out of the world&#x27;s five major religions, the Abrahamic religions—Christianity, Judaism, and Islam—all uphold heteronormative views on marriage. Some examples of this playing out in recent years include the incident involving Kentucky clerk Kim Davis, who refused to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples on the grounds that it violated her spiritual views, as well as the Supreme Court ruling that a Colorado baker did not have to provide a wedding cake for a gay couple based on his religion.

=== Media representation ===
Five different studies have shown that gay characters appearing on TV decreases the prejudice among viewers. Cable and streaming services are beginning to include more characters who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender than broadcast television. Cable and streaming services are lacking in diversity, according to a GLAAD report, with many of the LGBT characters being gay men (41% and 39% respectively). The total number of LGBT characters counted on cable was reported to be 31% up from 2015, and bisexual representations saw an almost twofold increase.

Intersex people are excluded almost completely from television, though about 1% of the population is intersex. News medias outline what it means to be male or female, which causes a gap for anyone who doesn&#x27;t fall into those two categories. Newspapers have covered the topic of intersex athletes with the case of Caster Semenya, where news spread of sporting officials having to determine whether she was to be considered female or male.

Those who do not identify as either woman or man are gender non-binary, or gender non-conforming. States in the United States are increasingly legalizing this &quot;third&quot; gender on official government documents as the existence of this identity is continuously debated among individuals. There have been criticisms that representations of non-binary people in media are limited in number and diversity.

<text>Singing is the art of creating music with the voice. It is the oldest form of musical expression, and the human voice can be considered the first musical instrument. The definition of singing varies across sources. Some sources define singing as the act of creating musical sounds with the voice. Other common definitions include &quot;the utterance of words or sounds in tuneful succession&quot; or &quot;the production of musical tones by means of the human voice&quot;.

A person whose profession is singing is called a singer or a vocalist (in jazz or popular music). Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir. Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art songs or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Many styles of singing exist throughout the world.

Singing can be formal or informal, arranged, or improvised. It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort, as part of a ritual, during music education or as a profession. Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction, and regular practice. If practice is done regularly then the sounds can become clearer and stronger. Professional singers usually build their careers around one specific musical genre, such as classical or rock, although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre). Professional singers usually take voice training provided by voice teachers or vocal coaches throughout their careers.

Singing should not be confused with rapping as they are not the same. According to music scholar and rap historian Martin E. Connor, &quot;Rap is often defined by its very opposition to singing.&quot; While also a form of vocal music, rap differs from singing in that it does not engage with tonality in the same way and does not require pitch accuracy. Like singing, rap does use rhythm in connection to words but these are spoken rather than sung on specific pitches. &quot;Grove Music Online&quot; states that &quot;Within the historical context of popular music in the United States, rap can be seen as an alternative to singing that could connect directly with stylistic speech practices in African American English.&quot; However, some rap artists do employ singing as well as rapping in their music; using the switch between the rhythmic speech of rapping and the sung pitches of singing as a striking contrast to grab the attention of the listener.
== Voices ==
In its physical aspect, singing has a well-defined technique that depends on the use of the lungs, which act as an air supply or bellows; on the larynx, which acts as a reed or vibrator; on the chest, head cavities and the skeleton, which have the function of an amplifier, as the tube in a wind instrument; and on the tongue, which together with the palate, teeth, and lips articulate and impose consonants and vowels on the amplified sound. Though these four mechanisms function independently, they are nevertheless coordinated in the establishment of a vocal technique and are made to interact upon one another. During passive breathing, air is inhaled with the diaphragm while exhalation occurs without any effort. Exhalation may be aided by the abdominal, internal intercostal and lower pelvis/pelvic muscles. Inhalation is aided by use of external intercostals, scalenes, and sternocleidomastoid muscles. The pitch is altered with the vocal cords. With the lips closed, this is called humming.

The sound of each individual&#x27;s singing voice is entirely unique not only because of the actual shape and size of an individual&#x27;s vocal cords, but also due to the size and shape of the rest of that person&#x27;s body. Humans have vocal folds which can loosen, tighten, or change their thickness, and over which breath can be transferred at varying pressures. The shape of the chest and neck, the position of the tongue, and the tightness of otherwise unrelated muscles can be altered. Any one of these actions results in a change in pitch, volume (loudness), timbre, or tone of the sound produced. Sound also resonates within different parts of the body and an individual&#x27;s size and bone structure can affect the sound produced by an individual.

Singers can also learn to project sound in certain ways so that it resonates better within their vocal tract. This is known as vocal resonation. Another major influence on vocal sound and production is the function of the larynx which people can manipulate in different ways to produce different sounds. These different kinds of laryngeal function are described as different kinds of vocal registers. The primary method for singers to accomplish this is through the use of the singer&#x27;s formant; which has been shown to match particularly well to the most sensitive part of the ear&#x27;s frequency range.

It has also been shown that a more powerful voice may be achieved with a fatter and fluid-like vocal fold mucosa. The more pliable the mucosa, the more efficient the transfer of energy from the airflow to the vocal folds.

=== Vocal classification ===

In European classical music and opera, voices are treated like musical instruments. Composers who write vocal music must have an understanding of the skills, talents, and vocal properties of singers. Voice classification is the process by which human singing voices are evaluated and are thereby designated into voice types. These qualities include but are not limited to vocal range, vocal weight, vocal tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal registration. The science behind voice classification developed within European classical music has been slow in adapting to more modern forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. There are currently several different systems in use within classical music including the German &quot;Fach&quot; system and the choral music system among many others. No system is universally applied or accepted.

However, most classical music systems acknowledge seven different major voice categories. Women are typically divided into three groups: soprano, mezzo-soprano, and contralto. Men are usually divided into four groups: countertenor, tenor, baritone, and bass. With regard to voices of pre-pubescent children, an eighth term, treble, can be applied. Within each of these major categories, several sub-categories identify specific vocal qualities like coloratura facility and vocal weight to differentiate between voices.

Within choral music, singers&#x27; voices are divided solely on the basis of vocal range. Choral music most commonly divides vocal parts into high and low voices within each sex (SATB, or soprano, alto, tenor, and bass). As a result, the typical choral situation gives many opportunities for misclassification to occur. Since most people have medium voices, they must be assigned to a part that is either too high or too low for them; the mezzo-soprano must sing soprano or alto and the baritone must sing tenor or bass. Either option can present problems for the singer, but for most singers, there are fewer dangers in singing too low than in singing too high.

Within contemporary forms of music (sometimes referred to as contemporary commercial music), singers are classified by the style of music they sing, such as jazz, pop, blues, soul, country, folk, and rock styles. There is currently no authoritative voice classification system within non-classical music. Attempts have been made to adopt classical voice type terms to other forms of singing but such attempts have been met with controversy. The development of voice categorizations were made with the understanding that the singer would be using classical vocal technique within a specified range using unamplified (no microphones) vocal production. Since contemporary musicians use different vocal techniques and microphones and are not forced to fit into a specific vocal role, applying such terms as soprano, tenor, baritone, etc. can be misleading or even inaccurate.

=== Vocal registration ===

&quot;Vocal registration&quot; refers to the system of vocal registers within the voice. A register in the voice is a particular series of tones, produced in the same vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, and possessing the same quality. Registers originate in laryngeal function. They occur because the vocal folds are capable of producing several different vibratory patterns. Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular range of pitches and produces certain characteristic sounds. The occurrence of registers has also been attributed to the effects of the acoustic interaction between the vocal fold oscillation and the vocal tract. The term &quot;register&quot; can be somewhat confusing as it encompasses several aspects of the voice. The term register can be used to refer to any of the following:
* A particular part of the vocal range such as the upper, middle, or lower registers.
* A resonance area such as chest voice or head voice.
* A phonatory process (phonation is the process of producing vocal sound by the vibration of the vocal folds that is in turn modified by the resonance of the vocal tract)
* A certain vocal timbre or vocal &quot;color&quot;
* A region of the voice which is defined or delimited by vocal breaks.

In linguistics, a register language is a language which combines tone and vowel phonation into a single phonological system. Within speech pathology, the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the vocal fry register, the modal register, the falsetto register, and the whistle register. This view is also adopted by many vocal pedagogues.

=== Vocal resonation ===

Vocal resonation is the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound. There are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the chest, the tracheal tree, the larynx itself, the pharynx, the oral cavity, the nasal cavity, and the sinuses.

=== Chest voice and head voice ===
&quot;Chest voice&quot; and &quot;head voice&quot; are terms used within vocal music. The use of these terms varies widely within vocal pedagogical circles and there is currently no one consistent opinion among vocal music professionals in regards to these terms. Chest voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the vocal range or type of vocal register; a vocal resonance area; or a specific vocal timbre. Head voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the vocal range or type of vocal register or a vocal resonance area. In Men, the head voice is commonly referred to as the falsetto. The transition from and combination of chest voice and head voice is referred to as vocal mix or vocal mixing in the singer&#x27;s performance. Vocal mixing can be inflected in specific modalities of artists who may concentrate on smooth transitions between chest voice and head voice, and those who may use a &quot;flip&quot; to describe the sudden transition from chest voice to head voice for artistic reasons and enhancement of vocal performances.

==== History and development ====
The first recorded mention of the terms chest voice and head voice was around the 13th century when it was distinguished from the &quot;throat voice&quot; (pectoris, guttoris, capitis—at this time it is likely that head voice referred to the falsetto register) by the writers Johannes de Garlandia and Jerome of Moravia. The terms were later adopted within bel canto, the Italian opera singing method, where chest voice was identified as the lowest and head voice the highest of three vocal registers: the chest, passagio, and head registers. This approach is still taught by some vocal pedagogists today. Another current popular approach that is based on the bel canto model is to divide both men and women&#x27;s voices into three registers. Men&#x27;s voices are divided into &quot;chest register&quot;, &quot;head register&quot;, and &quot;falsetto register&quot; and woman&#x27;s voices into &quot;chest register&quot;, &quot;middle register&quot;, and &quot;head register&quot;. Such pedagogists teach that the head register is a vocal technique used in singing to describe the resonance felt in the singer&#x27;s head.

However, as knowledge of physiology has increased over the past two hundred years, so has the understanding of the physical process of singing and vocal production. As a result, many vocal pedagogists, such as Ralph Appelman at Indiana University and William Vennard at the University of Southern California, have redefined or even abandoned the use of the terms chest voice and head voice. In particular, the use of the terms &quot;chest register&quot; and &quot;head register&quot; have become controversial since vocal registration is more commonly seen today as a product of laryngeal function that is unrelated to the physiology of the chest, lungs, and head. For this reason, many vocal pedagogists argue that it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the chest or head. They argue that the vibratory sensations which are felt in these areas are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to vocal resonance, not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the terms &quot;chest voice&quot; and &quot;head voice&quot; over the term register. This view believes that the problems which people identify as register problems are really problems of resonance adjustment. This view is also in alignment with the views of other academic fields that study vocal registration including speech pathology, phonetics, and linguistics. Although both methods are still in use, current vocal pedagogical practice tends to adopt the newer more scientific view. Also, some vocal pedagogists take ideas from both viewpoints.

The contemporary use of the term chest voice often refers to a specific kind of vocal coloration or vocal timbre. In classical singing, its use is limited entirely to the lower part of the modal register or normal voice. Within other forms of singing, chest voice is often applied throughout the modal register. Chest timbre can add a wonderful array of sounds to a singer&#x27;s vocal interpretive palette.
However, the use of an overly strong chest voice in the higher registers in an attempt to hit higher notes in the chest can lead to forcing. Forcing can lead consequently to vocal deterioration.

===Vocal registers: General discussion of transitions===

Passaggio () is a term used in classical singing to describe the transition area between the vocal registers. The &quot;passaggi&quot; (plural) of the voice lie between the different vocal registers, such as the chest voice, where any singer can produce a powerful sound, the middle voice, and the head voice, where a penetrating sound is accessible, but usually only through vocal training. The historic Italian school of singing describes a &quot;primo passaggio&quot; and a &quot;secondo passaggio&quot; connected through a &quot;zona di passaggio&quot; in the male voice and a &quot;primo passaggio&quot; and &quot;secondo passaggio&quot; in the female voice. A major goal of classical voice training in classical styles is to maintain an even timbre throughout the passaggio. Through proper training, it is possible to produce a resonant and powerful sound.

===Vocal registers and transitions===

One cannot adequately discuss the vocal &quot;passaggio&quot; without having a basic understanding of the different vocal registers. In his book &quot;The Principles of Voice Production&quot;, Ingo Titze states, &quot;The term &quot;register&quot; has been used to describe perceptually distinct regions of vocal quality that can be maintained over some ranges of pitch and loudness.&quot; Discrepancies in terminology exist between different fields of vocal study, such as teachers and singers, researchers, and clinicians. As Marilee David points out, &quot;Voice scientists see registration primarily as acoustic events.&quot; For singers, it is more common to explain registration events based on the physical sensations they feel when singing. Titze also explains that there are discrepancies in the terminology used to talk about vocal registration between speech pathologists and singing teachers. Since this article discusses the &quot;passaggio&quot;, which is a term used by classical singers, the registers will be discussed as they are in the field of singing rather than speech pathology and science.

The three main registers, described as head, middle (mixed), and chest voice, are described as having a rich timbre, because of the overtones due to the sympathetic resonance within the human body. Their names are derived from the area in which the singer feels these resonant vibration in the body. The chest register, more commonly referred to as the chest voice, is the lowest of the registers. When singing in the chest voice the singer feels sympathetic vibration in the chest. This is the register that people most commonly use while speaking. The middle voice falls in between the chest voice and head voice. The head register, or the head voice, is the highest of the main vocal registers. When singing in the head voice, the singer may feel sympathetic vibration occurring in the face or another part of the head. Where these registers lie in the voice is dependent on sex and the voice type within each sex.

There are an additional two registers called falsetto and flageolet register, which lie above their head register. Training is often required to access the pitches within these registers. Men and women with lower voices rarely sing in these registers. Lower-voiced women in particular receive very little if any training in the flageolet register. Men have one more additional register called the &quot;strohbass&quot;, which lies below the chest voice. Singing in this register is hard on the vocal cords, and therefore, is hardly ever used.

== Vocal pedagogy ==

Vocal pedagogy is the study of the teaching of singing. The art and science of vocal pedagogy has a long history that began in Ancient Greece and continues to develop and change today. Professions that practice the art and science of vocal pedagogy include vocal coaches, choral directors, vocal music educators, opera directors, and other teachers of singing.

Vocal pedagogy concepts are a part of developing proper vocal technique. Typical areas of study include the following:
* Anatomy and physiology as it relates to the physical process of singing
** Vocal health and voice disorders related to singing
** Breathing and air support for singing

=== Vocal technique ===
Singing when done with proper vocal technique is an integrated and coordinated act that effectively coordinates the physical processes of singing. There are four physical processes involved in producing vocal sound: respiration, phonation, resonation, and articulation. These processes occur in the following sequence:
# Breath is taken
# Sound is initiated in the larynx
# The vocal resonators receive the sound and influence it
# The articulators shape the sound into recognizable units

Although these four processes are often considered separately when studied, in actual practice, they merge into one coordinated function. With an effective singer or speaker, one should rarely be reminded of the process involved as their mind and body are so coordinated that one only perceives the resulting unified function. Many vocal problems result from a lack of coordination within this process.

Since singing is a coordinated act, it is difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus intensively on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions that it is hard to discuss them under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration.

Once the voice student has become aware of the physical processes that make up the act of singing and of how those processes function, the student begins the task of trying to coordinate them. Inevitably, students and teachers will become more concerned with one area of the technique than another. The various processes may progress at different rates, with a resulting imbalance or lack of coordination. The areas of vocal technique which seem to depend most strongly on the student&#x27;s ability to coordinate various functions are:
# Extending the vocal range to its maximum potential
# Developing consistent vocal production with a consistent tone quality
# Developing flexibility and agility
# Achieving a balanced vibrato
# A blend of chest and head voice on every note of the range

==== Developing the singing voice ====
Singing is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes. Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Vocal exercises have several purposes, including warming up the voice; extending the vocal range; &quot;lining up&quot; the voice horizontally and vertically; and acquiring vocal techniques such as legato, staccato, control of dynamics, rapid figurations, learning to sing wide intervals comfortably, singing trills, singing melismas and correcting vocal faults.

Vocal pedagogists instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound they are making and the kind of sensations they are feeling while they are singing.

Learning to sing is an activity that benefits from the involvement of an instructor. A singer does not hear the same sounds inside his or her head that others hear outside. Therefore, having a guide who can tell a student what kinds of sounds he or she is producing guides a singer to understand which of the internal sounds correspond to the desired sounds required by the style of singing the student aims to re-create.

=== Extending vocal range ===
An important goal of vocal development is to learn to sing to the natural limits of one&#x27;s vocal range without any obvious or distracting changes of quality or technique. Vocal pedagogists teach that a singer can only achieve this goal when all of the physical processes involved in singing (such as laryngeal action, breath support, resonance adjustment, and articulatory movement) are effectively working together. Most vocal pedagogists believe in coordinating these processes by (1) establishing good vocal habits in the most comfortable tessitura of the voice, and then (2) slowly expanding the range.

There are three factors that significantly affect the ability to sing higher or lower:

# The &quot;energy&quot; factor – &quot;energy&quot; has several connotations. It refers to the total response of the body to the making of sound; to a dynamic relationship between the breathing-in muscles and the breathing-out muscles known as the breath support mechanism; to the amount of breath pressure delivered to the vocal folds and their resistance to that pressure; and to the dynamic level of the sound.
# The &quot;space&quot; factor – &quot;space&quot; refers to the size of the inside of the mouth and the position of the palate and larynx. Generally speaking, a singer&#x27;s mouth should be opened wider the higher he or she sings. The internal space or position of the soft palate and larynx can be widened by relaxing the throat. Vocal pedagogists describe this as feeling like the &quot;beginning of a yawn&quot;.
# The &quot;depth&quot; factor – &quot;depth&quot; has two connotations. It refers to the actual physical sensations of depth in the body and vocal mechanism, and to mental concepts of depth that are related to tone quality.

McKinney says, &quot;These three factors can be expressed in three basic rules: (1) As you sing higher, you must use more energy; as you sing lower, you must use less. (2) As you sing higher, you must use more space; as you sing lower, you must use less. (3) As you sing higher, you must use more depth; as you sing lower, you must use less.&quot;

=== Posture ===
The singing process functions best when certain physical conditions of the body are put in place. The ability to move air in and out of the body freely and to obtain the needed quantity of air can be seriously affected by the posture of the various parts of the breathing mechanism. A sunken chest position will limit the capacity of the lungs, and a tense abdominal wall will inhibit the downward travel of the diaphragm. Good posture allows the breathing mechanism to fulfill its basic function efficiently without any undue expenditure of energy. Good posture also makes it easier to initiate phonation and to tune the resonators as proper alignment prevents unnecessary tension in the body. Vocal pedagogists have also noted that when singers assume good posture it often provides them with a greater sense of self-assurance and poise while performing. Audiences also tend to respond better to singers with good posture. Habitual good posture also ultimately improves the overall health of the body by enabling better blood circulation and preventing fatigue and stress on the body.

There are eight components of the ideal singing posture:

# Feet slightly apart
# Legs straight but knees slightly bent
# Hips facing straight forward
# Spine aligned
# Abdomen flat
# Chest comfortably forward
# Shoulders down and back
# Head facing straight forward

=== Breathing and breath support ===
Natural breathing has three stages: a breathing-in period, breathing out period, and a resting or recovery period; these stages are not usually consciously controlled. Within singing, there are four stages of breathing: a breathing-in period (inhalation); a setting up controls period (suspension); a controlled exhalation period (phonation); and a recovery period.

These stages must be under conscious control by the singer until they become conditioned reflexes. Many singers abandon conscious controls before their reflexes are fully conditioned which ultimately leads to chronic vocal problems.

=== Vibrato ===
Vibrato is a technique in which a sustained note wavers very quickly and consistently between a higher and a lower pitch, giving the note a slight quaver. Vibrato is the pulse or wave in a sustained tone. Vibrato occurs naturally and is the result of proper breath support and a relaxed vocal apparatus. Some studies have shown that vibrato is the result of a neuromuscular tremor in the vocal folds. In 1922 Max Schoen was the first to make the comparison of vibrato to a tremor due to change in amplitude, lack of automatic control and it being half the rate of normal muscular discharge. Some singers use vibrato as a means of expression. Many successful artists can sing a deep, rich vibrato.

=== Extended vocal technique ===
Extended vocal techniques include rapping, screaming, growling, overtones, sliding, falsetto, yodeling, belting, use of vocal fry register, using sound reinforcement systems, among others. A sound reinforcement system is the combination of microphones, signal processors, amplifiers, and loudspeakers. The combination of such units may also use reverb, echo chambers and Auto-Tune among other devices.

== Vocal music ==

Vocal music is music performed by one or more singers, which are typically called songs, and which may be performed with or without instrumental accompaniment, in which singing provides the main focus of the piece. Vocal music is probably the oldest form of music since it does not require any instrument or equipment besides the voice. All musical cultures have some form of vocal music and there are many long-standing singing traditions throughout the world&#x27;s cultures. Music which employs singing but does not feature it prominently is generally considered instrumental music. For example, some blues rock songs may have a short, simple call-and-response chorus, but the emphasis in the song is on the instrumental melodies and improvisation. Vocal music typically features sung words called lyrics, although there are notable examples of vocal music that are performed using non-linguistic syllables or noises, sometimes as musical onomatopoeia. A short piece of vocal music with lyrics is broadly termed a song, although, in classical music, terms such as aria are typically used.

=== Genres of vocal music ===
Vocal music is written in many different forms and styles which are often labeled within a particular genre of music. These genres include popular music, art music, religious music, secular music, and fusions of such genres. Within these larger genres are many subgenres. For example, popular music would encompass blues, jazz, country music, easy listening, hip hop, rock music, and several other genres. There may also be a subgenre within a subgenre such as vocalese and scat singing in jazz.

==== Popular and traditional music ====
In many modern pop musical groups, a lead singer performs the primary vocals or melody of a song, as opposed to a backing singer who sings backup vocals or the harmony of a song. Backing vocalists sing some, but usually, not all, parts of the song often singing only in a song&#x27;s refrain or humming in the background. An exception is five-part gospel a cappella music, where the lead is the highest of the five voices and sings a descant and not the melody. Some artists may sing both the lead and backing vocals on audio recordings by overlapping recorded vocal tracks.

Popular music includes a range of vocal styles. Hip hop uses rapping, the rhythmic delivery of rhymes in a rhythmic speech over a beat or without accompaniment. Some types of rapping consist mostly or entirely of speech and chanting, like the Jamaican &quot;toasting&quot;. In some types of rapping, the performers may interpolate short sung or half-sung passages. Blues singing is based on the use of the blue notes – notes sung at a slightly lower pitch than that of the major scale for expressive purposes. In heavy metal and hardcore punk subgenres, vocal styles can include techniques such as screams, shouts, and unusual sounds such as the &quot;death growl&quot;.

One difference between live performances in the popular and Classical genres is that whereas Classical performers often sing without amplification in small- to mid-size halls, in popular music, a microphone and PA system (amplifier and speakers) are used in almost all performance venues, even a small coffee house. The use of the microphone has had several impacts on popular music. For one, it facilitated the development of intimate, expressive singing styles such as &quot;crooning&quot; which would not have enough projection and volume if done without a microphone. As well, pop singers who use microphones can do a range of other vocal styles that would not project without amplification, such as making whispering sounds, humming, and mixing half-sung and sung tones. As well, some performers use the microphone&#x27;s response patterns to create effects, such as bringing the mic very close to the mouth to get an enhanced bass response, or, in the case of hip-hop beatboxers, doing plosive &quot;p&quot; and &quot;b&quot; sounds into the mic to create percussive effects. In the 2000s, controversy arose over the widespread use of electronic Auto-Tune pitch correction devices with recorded and live popular music vocals. Controversy has also arisen due to cases where pop singers have been found to be lip-syncing to a pre-recorded recording of their vocal performance or, in the case of the controversial act Milli Vanilli, lip-syncing to tracks recorded by other uncredited singers.

While some bands use backup singers who only sing when they are on stage, it is common for backup singers in popular music to have other roles. In many rock and metal bands, the musicians doing backup vocals also play instruments, such as rhythm guitar, electric bass, or drums. In Latin or Afro-Cuban groups, backup singers may play percussion instruments or shakers while singing. In some pop and hip hop groups and in musical theater, the backup singers may be required to perform elaborately choreographed dance routines while they sing through headset microphones.

== Careers ==
The salaries and working conditions for vocalists vary a great deal. While jobs in other music fields such as music education choir conductors tend to be based on full-time, salaried positions, singing jobs tend to be based on contracts for individual shows or performances, or for a sequence of shows.

Aspiring singers and vocalists must have musical skills, an excellent voice, the ability to work with people, and a sense of showmanship and drama. Additionally, singers need to have the ambition and drive to continually study and improve.

Professional singers continue to seek out vocal coaching to hone their skills, extend their range, and learn new styles. As well, aspiring singers need to gain specialized skills in the vocal techniques used to interpret songs, learn about the vocal literature from their chosen style of music, and gain skills in choral music techniques, sight singing and memorizing songs, and vocal exercises.

Some singers learn other music jobs, such as the composing, music producing and songwriting. Some singers put videos on YouTube and streaming apps. Singers market themselves to buyers of vocal talent, by doing auditions in front of a music director. Depending on the style of vocal music that a person has trained in, the &quot;talent buyers&quot; that they seek out may be record company, A&amp;R representatives, music directors, choir directors, nightclub managers, or concert promoters. A CD or DVD with excerpts of vocal performances is used to demonstrate a singer&#x27;s skills. Some singers hire an agent or manager to help them to seek out paid engagements and other performance opportunities; the agent or manager is often paid by receiving a percentage of the fees that the singer gets from performing onstage.

==Singing competitions==

There are several television shows that showcase singing. &quot;American Idol&quot; was launched in 2002. The first singing reality show was &quot;Sa Re Ga Ma Pa&quot; launched by Zee TV in 1995. At the &quot;American Idol&quot; Contestants audition in front of a panel of judges to see if they can move on to the next round in Hollywood, from then, the competition begins. The field of contestants is narrowed down week by week until a winner is chosen. To move on to the next round, the contestants&#x27; fate is determined by a vote by viewers. &quot;The Voice&quot; is another singing competition program. Similar to &quot;American Idol&quot;, the contestants audition in front of a panel of judges, however, the judges&#x27; chairs are faced towards the audience during the performance. If the coaches are interested in the artist, they will press their button signifying they want to coach them. Once the auditions conclude, coaches have their team of artists and the competition begins. Coaches then mentor their artists and they compete to find the best singer. Other well-known singing competitions include &quot;The X Factor&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, &quot;Rising Star&quot; and &quot;The Sing-Off&quot;.

A different example of a singing competition is &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget the Lyrics!&quot;, where the show&#x27;s contestants compete to win cash prizes by correctly recalling song lyrics from a variety of genres. The show contrasts to many other music-based game shows in that artistic talent (such as the ability to sing or dance in an aesthetically pleasing way) is irrelevant to the contestants&#x27; chances of winning; in the words of one of their commercials prior to the first airing, &quot;You don&#x27;t have to sing it well; you just have to sing it right.&quot; In a similar vein, &quot;The Singing Bee&quot; combines karaoke singing with a spelling bee-style competition, with the show featuring contestants trying to remember the lyrics to popular songs.

== Singing and language ==
Every spoken language, natural or non-natural language has its own intrinsic musicality which affects singing by means of pitch, phrasing, and accent.

=== American Sign Language: Artistic Song Signing ===
An artistic signer, a signer who translates the lyrics of a song into American Sign Language (ASL), can modify existing signs, create new signs from the three basic parameters of sign language, and manipulate the typical signing space, thus deliberately expressing &quot;rhythm, pitch, phrasing, and timbre.&quot; Moreover, an artistic signer can be a person who is &quot;Deaf, hearing, or hard of hearing&quot; such as Justina Miles, a Deaf performer who used ASL to interpret Rihanna&#x27;s 2023 Super Bowl Halftime Show performance, and Stephen Torrence, a hearing person who created signed songs on YouTube.

=== Neurological aspects ===
Much research has been done recently on the link between music and language, especially singing. It is becoming increasingly clear that these two processes are very much alike, and yet also different. Levitin describes how, beginning with the eardrum, sound waves are translated into pitch, or a tonotopic map, and then shortly thereafter &quot;speech and music probably diverge into separate processing circuits&quot; (130). There is evidence that neural circuits used for music and language may start out in infants undifferentiated. There are several areas of the brain that are used for both language and music. For example, Brodmann area 47, which has been implicated in the processing of syntax in oral and sign languages, as well as musical syntax and semantic aspects of language. Levitin recounts how in certain studies, &quot;listening to music and attending its syntactic features&quot;, similar to the syntactic processes in language, activated this part of the brain. In addition, &quot;musical syntax ... has been localized to ... areas adjacent to and overlapping with those regions that process speech syntax, such as Broca&#x27;s area&quot; and &quot;the regions involved in musical semantics ... appear to be [localized] near Wernicke&#x27;s area.&quot; Both Broca&#x27;s area and Wernicke&#x27;s area are important steps in language processing and production.

Singing has been shown to help stroke victims recover speech. According to neurologist Gottfried Schlaug, there is a corresponding area to that of speech, which resides in the left hemisphere, on the right side of the brain. This is casually known as the &quot;singing center&quot;. By teaching stroke victims to sing their words, this can help train this area of the brain for speech. In support of this theory, Levitin asserts that &quot;regional specificity&quot;, such as that for speech, &quot;may be temporary, as the processing centers for important mental functions actually move to other regions after trauma or brain damage.&quot; Thus in the right hemisphere of the brain, the &quot;singing center&quot; may be retrained to help produce speech.

=== Accents and singing ===
The speaking dialect or accent of a person may differ greatly from the general singing accent that a person uses while singing. When people sing, they generally use the accent or neutral accent that is used in the style of music they are singing in, rather than a regional accent or dialect; the style of music and the popular center/region of the style has more influence on the singing accent of a person than where they come from. For example, in the English language, British singers of rock or popular music often sing in an American accent or neutral accent instead of an English accent.

<doc id="162711" wikidata="Q152524" url="?curid=162711" title="Robert Capa">
<text>Robert Capa (; born Endre Ernő Friedmann; October 22, 1913 – May 25, 1954) was a Hungarian-American war photographer and photojournalist. He is considered by some to be the greatest combat and adventure photographer in history.

Friedman had fled political repression in Hungary when he was a teenager, moving to Berlin, where he enrolled in college. He witnessed the rise of Hitler, which led him to move to Paris, where he met and began to work with his professional partner Gerda Taro, and they began to publish their work separately. Capa&#x27;s deep friendship with David Seymour-Chim was captured in Martha Gellhorn&#x27;s novella &quot;Two by Two&quot;. He subsequently covered five wars: the Spanish Civil War, the Second Sino-Japanese War, World War II across Europe, the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and the First Indochina War, with his photos published in major magazines and newspapers.

During his career he risked his life numerous times, most dramatically as the only civilian photographer landing on Omaha Beach on D-Day. He documented the course of World War II in London, North Africa, Italy, and the liberation of Paris. His friends and colleagues included Ernest Hemingway, Irwin Shaw, John Steinbeck and director John Huston.

In 1947, for his work recording World War II in pictures, U.S. general Dwight D. Eisenhower awarded Capa the Medal of Freedom. That same year, Capa co-founded Magnum Photos in Paris. The organization was the first cooperative agency for worldwide freelance photographers. Hungary has issued a stamp and a gold coin in his honor.

He was killed when he stepped on a landmine in Vietnam.

==Early years==
Capa was born Endre Ernő Friedmann to the Jewish family of Júlia (née Berkovits) and Dezső Friedmann in Budapest, Austria-Hungary, on October 22, 1913. His mother, Julianna Henrietta Berkovits was a native of Nagykapos (now Veľké Kapušany, Slovakia) and Dezső Friedmann came from the Transylvanian village of Csucsa (now Ciucea, Romania). At the age of 18, he was accused of alleged communist sympathies and was forced to flee Hungary.

He moved to Berlin, where he enrolled at Berlin University where he worked part-time as a darkroom assistant for income and then became a staff photographer for the German photographic agency, Dephot. It was during that period that the Nazi Party came into power, which made Capa, a Jew, decide to leave Germany and move to Paris.

==Career==
Capa&#x27;s first published photograph was of Leon Trotsky making a speech in Copenhagen on &quot;The Meaning of the Russian Revolution&quot; in 1932.

After moving to Paris, he became professionally involved with Gerta Pohorylle, later known as Gerda Taro, a German-Jewish photographer who had moved to Paris for the same reasons he did. The two of them decided to work under the alias Capa at this time, and she contributed to much of the early work. However, the two of them later separated aliases, with Pohorylle quickly creating her own alias &#x27;Gerda Taro&#x27;, and began publishing their work independently. Capa and Taro developed a romantic relationship alongside their professional one. Capa proposed and Taro refused, but they continued their involvement. He also shared a darkroom with French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, with whom he would later co-found the Magnum Photos cooperative.

===Spanish Civil War, 1936===
From 1936 to 1939, Capa worked in Spain, photographing the Spanish Civil War, along with Taro and David Seymour.

It was during that war that Capa took the photo now called &quot;The Falling Soldier&quot; (1936), purported to show the death of a Republican soldier. The photo was published in magazines in France and then by &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Picture Post&quot;. The authenticity of the photo was later questioned, with evidence including other photos from the scene suggesting it was staged. &quot;Picture Post,&quot; a pioneering photojournalism magazine published in the United Kingdom, had once described then twenty-five year old Capa as &quot;the greatest war photographer in the world.&quot;

The next year, in 1937, Taro died when the motor vehicle on which she was traveling (apparently standing on the footboard) collided with an out-of-control tank. She had been returning from a photographic assignment covering the Battle of Brunete.

Capa accompanied then-journalist and author Ernest Hemingway to photograph the war, which Hemingway would later describe in his novel, &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (1940). &quot;Life&quot; magazine published an article about Hemingway and his time in Spain, along with numerous photos by Capa.

In December 2007, three boxes filled with rolls of film, containing 4,500 35mm negatives of the Spanish Civil War by Capa, Taro, and Chim (David Seymour), which had been considered lost since 1939, were discovered in Mexico. In 2011, Trisha Ziff directed a film about those images, entitled &quot;The Mexican Suitcase&quot;.

=== Chinese resistance to Imperial Japan, 1938 ===
In 1938, he traveled to the Chinese city of Hankou, now within Wuhan, to document the resistance to the Japanese invasion. He sent his images to &quot;Life&quot; magazine, which published some of them in its May 23, 1938, issue.
=== World War II ===
At the start of World War II, Capa was in New York City, having moved there from Paris to look for work, and to escape Nazi persecution. During the war, Capa was sent to various parts of the European Theatre on photography assignments. He first photographed for &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, before switching to &quot;Life&quot; after he was fired by Collier&#x27;s. He was the only &quot;enemy alien&quot; photographer for the Allies. On October 7, 1943, Robert Capa was in Naples with &quot;Life&quot; reporter Will Lang Jr., and there he photographed the Naples post office bombing.
==== D-Day, Omaha beach, 1944 ====
A group of images known as &quot;The Magnificent Eleven&quot; were taken by Capa on D-Day. Taking part in the Allied invasion, Capa was attached to the 16th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division (&quot;Big Red One&quot;) on Omaha Beach. The US personnel attacking Omaha Beach faced some of the heaviest resistance from German troops inside the bunkers of the Atlantic Wall. Photographic historian A. D. Coleman has suggested that Capa traveled to the beach in the same landing craft as Colonel George A. Taylor, commander of the 16th Infantry Regiment, who landed 1½ hours after the first wave, near Colleville-sur-Mer.

Capa subsequently stated that he took 106 pictures, but later discovered that all but 11 had been destroyed. This incident may have been caused by Capa&#x27;s cameras becoming waterlogged at Normandy, although the more frequent allegation is that a young assistant accidentally destroyed the pictures while they were being developed at the photo lab in London. However, this narrative has been challenged by Coleman and others. In 2016, John G. Morris, who was picture editor at the London bureau of &quot;Life&quot; in 1944, agreed that it was more likely that Capa captured 11 images in total on D-Day. The 11 prints were included in &quot;Life&quot; magazine&#x27;s issue on June 19, 1944, with captions written by magazine staffers, as Capa did not provide &quot;Life&quot; with notes or a verbal description of what they showed.

The captions have since been shown to be erroneous, as were subsequent descriptions of the images by Capa himself. For example, men described by &quot;Life&quot; as infantrymen taking cover behind a hedgehog obstacle during the assault landing were in fact members of Gap Assault Team 10 – a combined US Navy/US Army demolition unit tasked with blowing up obstacles and clearing the way for landing craft after the beach had been secured.

==== &quot;The Shaved Woman of Chartres&quot; ====
Capa took photographs during the Allied invasion of France in 1944. His picture &quot;The Shaved Woman of Chartres&quot;, taken on August 16, 1944, shows a woman whose head has been shaved as a punishment for collaboration with the Nazis.

==== &quot;The Picture of the Last Man to Die&quot; ====

On April 18, 1945, Capa captured images of a fight to secure a bridge in Leipzig, Germany. These pictures included an image of Raymond J. Bowman&#x27;s death by sniper fire. This image was published in a spread in &quot;Life&quot; magazine with the caption &quot;The picture of the last man to die.&quot;

=== Post-war Soviet Union, 1947 ===
In 1947 Capa traveled to the Soviet Union with his friend, the American writer John Steinbeck. They originally met when they shared a room in an Algiers hotel with other war correspondents before the Allied invasion of Italy in 1943. They reconnected in New York, where Steinbeck told him he was thinking about visiting the Soviet Union, now that the war was over.

Capa suggested they go there together and collaborate on a book, with Capa documenting the war-torn nation with photographs. The trip resulted in Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;A Russian Journal&quot;, which was published both as a book and a syndicated newspaper serial. Photos were taken in Moscow, Kyiv, Tbilisi, Batumi and among the ruins of Stalingrad. They remained good friends until Capa&#x27;s death; Steinbeck took the news of Capa&#x27;s death very hard.

===Magnum Photos agency, 1947===
In 1947, Capa founded the cooperative venture Magnum Photos in Paris with Henri Cartier-Bresson, William Vandivert, David Seymour, and George Rodger. It was a cooperative agency to manage work for and by freelance photographers, and developed a reputation for the excellence of its photo-journalists. In 1952, he became the president.

===Founding of Israel, 1948===
Capa toured Israel during its founding and while it was being attacked by neighboring states. He took the numerous photographs that accompanied Irwin Shaw&#x27;s book, &quot;Report on Israel&quot;.
===Documenting film productions, 1953===
In 1953 he joined screenwriter Truman Capote and director John Huston in Italy where Capa was assigned to photograph the making of the film, &quot;Beat the Devil&quot;. During their off time they, and star Humphrey Bogart, enjoyed playing poker.

===First Indochina War and death, 1954===
In the early 1950s, Capa travelled to Japan for an exhibition associated with Magnum Photos. While there, &quot;Life&quot; magazine asked him to go on assignment to Southeast Asia, where the French had been fighting for eight years in the First Indochina War. Although he had claimed a few years earlier that he was finished with war, Capa accepted the job. He accompanied a French regiment located in Thái Bình Province with two &quot;Time-Life&quot; journalists, John Mecklin and Jim Lucas. On May 25, 1954, the regiment was passing through a dangerous area under fire when Capa decided to leave his jeep and go up the road to photograph the advance. Capa was killed when he stepped on a landmine near the road.

He was 40 at the time of his death. He is buried in plot #189 at Amawalk Hill Cemetery (also called Friends Cemetery), Amawalk, Westchester County, New York along with his mother, Julia, and his brother, Cornell Capa.

==Personal life==
Capa was born into a middle-class Jewish family in Budapest, where his parents were tailors; Capa&#x27;s mother was a successful fashion shop owner, and his father was an employee of her shop. Capa had two brothers: a younger brother, photographer Cornell Capa and an older brother, László Friedmann. Cornell moved to Paris in 1936 to join his older brother Capa, where he found an interest in photography instead of staying in the field of medicine. Not much is known of Capa&#x27;s older brother László, except that he married Angela Maria Friedmann-Csordas in 1933. He died a year later and was buried next to his father in the Kozma Utca Jewish Cemetery.

At the age of 18, Capa moved to Vienna, later relocated to Prague, and finally settled in Berlin: all cities that were centers of artistic and cultural ferment in this period. He started studies in journalism at the German Political College, but the Nazi Party instituted restrictions on Jews and banned them from colleges. Capa relocated to Paris, where he adopted the name &#x27;Robert Capa&#x27; in 1934. (In Hungarian, &quot;cápa&quot; means &quot;shark&quot;.) At that time, he had already been a hobby-photographer.

In 1934, &quot;André Friedman&quot;, as he still called himself then, met Gerda Pohorylle, a German Jewish refugee. The couple lived in Paris where André taught Gerda photography. Together they created the name and image of &quot;Robert Capa&quot; as a famous American photographer, and at the beginning of the war, both photographers published their work under the pseudonym of Robert Capa. Gerda took the name Gerda Taro and became successful in her own right. She travelled with Capa to Spain in 1936 intending to document the Spanish Civil War. In July 1937, Capa traveled briefly to Paris while Gerda remained in Madrid. She was killed near Brunete during a battle. Capa, who was reportedly engaged to her, was deeply shocked and never married.

In February 1943, Capa met Elaine Justin, then married to the actor John Justin. They fell in love and the relationship lasted until the end of the war. Capa spent most of his time in the frontline. Capa called the redheaded Elaine &quot;Pinky,&quot; and wrote about her in his war memoir, &quot;Slightly Out of Focus&quot;. In 1945, Elaine Justin broke up with Capa; she later married Chuck Romine.

Some months later, Capa became the lover of the actress Ingrid Bergman, who was touring in Europe to entertain American soldiers.p. 176 In December 1945, Capa followed her to Hollywood. The relationship ended in the summer of 1946 when Capa traveled to Turkey.

==Legacy==
The government of Hungary issued a postage stamp in Capa&#x27;s honor in 2013. That same year it issued a 5,000-forint ($20) gold coin, also in his honor, showing an engraving of Capa.

His younger brother, Cornell Capa, also a photographer, worked to preserve and promote Robert&#x27;s legacy as well as develop his own identity and style. He founded the International Fund for Concerned Photography in 1966. To give this collection a permanent home, he founded the International Center of Photography in New York City in 1974. This was one of the foremost and most extensive conservation efforts on photography to be developed. Indeed, Capa and his brother believed strongly in the importance of photography and its preservation, much like film would later be perceived and duly treated in a similar way.
The Overseas Press Club created the Robert Capa Gold Medal in the photographer&#x27;s honor.

Capa is known for redefining wartime photojournalism. His work came from the trenches as opposed to the more arms-length perspective that was the precedent. He was famed for saying, &quot;If your photographs aren&#x27;t good enough, you&#x27;re not close enough.&quot;

He is credited with coining the term Generation X. He used it as a title for a photo-essay about the young people reaching adulthood immediately after the Second World War. It was published in 1953 in &quot;Picture Post&quot; (UK) and &quot;Holiday&quot; (US). Capa said, &quot;We named this unknown generation, The Generation X, and even in our first enthusiasm we realised that we had something far bigger than our talents and pockets could cope with.&quot;

In 1947, for his work recording World War II in pictures, U.S. general Dwight D. Eisenhower awarded Capa the Medal of Freedom Citation The International Center of Photography organized a travelling exhibition titled &quot;This Is War: Robert Capa at Work&quot;, which displayed Capa&#x27;s innovations as a photojournalist in the 1930s and 1940s. It includes vintage prints, contact sheets, caption sheets, handwritten observations, personal letters and original magazine layouts from the Spanish Civil War, the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. The exhibition appeared at the Barbican Art Gallery, the International Center of Photography of Milan, and the Museu Nacional d&#x27;Art de Catalunya in the fall of 2009, before moving to the Nederlands Fotomuseum from October 10, 2009, until January 10, 2010.

In 1976 Capa was posthumously inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum.

==Politics==
As a young boy, Capa was drawn to the Munkakör (Employment Circle), a group of socialist and avant-garde artists, photographers, and intellectuals centered around Budapest. He participated in the demonstrations against the Miklós Horthy regime. In 1931, just before his first photo was published, Capa was arrested by the Hungarian secret police, beaten, and jailed for his radical political activity. A police official&#x27;s wife—who happened to know his family—won Capa&#x27;s release on the condition that he would leave Hungary immediately.

The &quot;Boston Review&quot; has described Capa as &quot;a leftist, and a democrat—he was passionately pro-Loyalist and passionately anti-fascist ...&quot; During the Spanish Civil War, Capa travelled with and photographed the Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), which resulted in his best-known photograph.

The British magazine &quot;Picture Post&quot; ran his photos from Spain in the 1930s accompanied by a portrait of Capa, in profile, with the simple description: &quot;He is a passionate democrat, and he lives to take photographs.&quot;

==In popular culture==
* In 2013, the Japanese Female Musical Theater group Takarazuka Revue produced a musical piece based on the life of Capa. Ms. Ouki Kaname performed the lead role as Capa. The group performed the musical in 2012 in Takarazuka and Tokyo and in 2014 in Nagoya. 
* In Patrick Modiano&#x27;s novella &quot;Afterimage&quot; Capa is a mentor for the subject of the novella, Francis Jansen, a photographer who retires to Mexico.
* In Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s movie &quot;Rear Window&quot;, the protagonist L. B. &quot;Jeff&quot; Jefferies (James Stewart) was partly based on Capa.
* Poet Owen Sheers wrote a poem about Capa, named &quot;Happy Accidents&quot;. It can be found in the anthology &quot;Skirrid Hill&quot;.
* In English indie rock group Alt-J&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;An Awesome Wave,&quot; the love between Capa and Taro, and the circumstances of his death are described in the last track, &quot;Taro&quot;.
* The Austrian rock singer Falco wrote the song &quot;Kamikaze Cappa&quot; in tribute to Capa.

<doc id="162712" wikidata="Q5437446" url="?curid=162712" title="Fatemeh Is Fatemeh">
<text>Fatemeh is Fatemeh () is a book written by Ali Shariati. The book was written in 1971.

It was written in the pre-revolutionary era of Iran&#x27;s history where there were no specific sources by which one might interpret who she was, and he assures the readers that he is giving them more than an analytical description of her personality and that it needs the criticism of the enlightened thinker. Ali Shariati introduces Fatima as a revolutionary Muslim woman in his famous lecture and subsequent book Fatima is Fatima (1971). He presents Fatima, the daughter of Prophet Muhammad, as an independent historical figure embodying resistance, social justice, and revolutionary action. Shariati&#x27;s portrayal moves beyond traditional religious narratives, framing her as a model for young Muslim women engaged in sociopolitical struggles. He crafts Fatima’s image in response to two key socio-political phenomena of the 1970s: the constrained role of women in political activism and the lack of a collective revolutionary Islamic identity for young Muslim women. By emphasizing her defiance against political injustice and her commitment to social change, Shariati constructs Fatima as a symbol of resistance, paralleling the struggles of contemporary revolutionary women in Iran. His discourse sought to mobilize Muslim women into revolutionary action, positioning Islam as a liberating force against imperialism and oppression. Shariati’s Fatima stands in contrast to both Western consumerist models and traditional passive roles for women. Instead, he envisions a new archetype: the revolutionary Muslim woman who is intellectually engaged, politically active, and committed to transforming society. His interpretation played a crucial role in shaping the collective revolutionary identity of many Iranian women leading up to the 1979 Islamic Revolution. By writing this book he was to complete the work of French scholar Professor Louis Massignon. 
In the book, Fatima Zahra, the daughter of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, is described as a role model for Muslim women around the world and a woman who is free. He describes Fatima as a manifestation and a symbol of the way and an essential direction of &#x27;Islamic thought&#x27;. He states that even in the ever-changing world in which people&#x27;s views towards life constantly change, as a role model Fatima can still be looked up to by women around the world.
Shariati also admonished the ulema for not giving sufficient teachings about the lives of Muhammad’s family members.

<text>Brassaï (; pseudonym of Gyula Halász; 9 September 1899 – 8 July 1984) was a Hungarian–French photographer, sculptor, medalist, writer, and filmmaker who rose to international fame in France in the 20th century. He was one of the numerous Hungarian artists who flourished in Paris beginning between the world wars.

In the early 21st century, the discovery of more than 200 letters and hundreds of drawings and other items from the period 1940 to 1984 has provided scholars with material for understanding his later life and career.

==Early life and education==
Gyula Halász, a.k.a. Brassaï (pseudonym), was born on 9 September 1899 in Brassó, Kingdom of Hungary (today Brașov, Romania) to an Armenian mother and a Hungarian father. He grew up speaking Hungarian and Romanian. When he was three his family lived in Paris for a year, while his father, a professor of French literature, taught at the Sorbonne.

As a young man, he studied painting and sculpture at the Hungarian Academy of Fine Arts (Magyar Képzőművészeti Egyetem) in Budapest. He joined a cavalry regiment of the Austro-Hungarian army, where he served until the end of the First World War. He cited Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec as an artistic influence.

==Career==

Following WWI, his hometown of Brassó, and the rest of Transylvania, was transferred from the Kingdom of Hungary to Romania at the Treaty of Trianon. Halász left for Berlin in 1920 where he worked as a journalist for the Hungarian papers &quot;Keleti&quot; and &quot;Napkelet&quot;. He started studies at the Berlin-Charlottenburg Academy of Fine Arts (&quot;Hochschule für Bildende Künste&quot;), now Universität der Künste Berlin. There he became friends with several older Hungarian artists and writers, including the painters Lajos Tihanyi and Bertalan Pór, who later moved to Paris and became part of the Hungarian circle.

In 1924, Halasz moved to Paris to live, where he would stay for the rest of his life. He began teaching himself the French language by reading the works of Marcel Proust. Living among the gathering of young artists in the Montparnasse quarter, he took a job as a journalist. He soon became friends with the American writer Henry Miller, and the French writers Léon-Paul Fargue and Jacques Prévert. In the late 1920s, he lived in the same hotel as Tihanyi.

Miller later played down Brassai&#x27;s claims of friendship. In 1976 he wrote of Brassai: &quot;Fred [Perles] and I used to steer shy of him – he bored us.&quot; Miller added that the biography Brassai had written of him was typically &quot;padded&quot;, &quot;full of factual errors, full of suppositions, rumors, documents he filched which are largely false or give a false impression.&quot;

Halász&#x27;s job and his love of the city, whose streets he often wandered late at night, led to photography. He first used it to supplement some of his articles for more money, but rapidly explored the city through this medium, in which he was tutored by his fellow Hungarian André Kertész. He later wrote that he used photography &quot;to capture the beauty of streets and gardens in the rain and fog, and to capture Paris by night.&quot; Using the name of his birthplace, Halász went by the pseudonym &quot;Brassaï,&quot; which means &quot;from Brasso.&quot;

Brassaï captured the essence of the city in his photographs, published as his first collection in the 1933 book entitled &quot;Paris de nuit&quot; (&quot;Paris by Night&quot;). His book gained great success, resulting in being called &quot;the eye of Paris&quot; in an essay by Henry Miller. In addition to photos of the seedier side of Paris, Brassai portrayed scenes from the life of the city&#x27;s high society, its intellectuals, its ballet, and the grand operas. He had been befriended by a French family who gave him access to the upper classes. Brassai photographed many of his artist friends, including Salvador Dalí, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Alberto Giacometti, and several of the prominent writers of his time, such as Jean Genet and Henri Michaux.

Young Hungarian artists continued to arrive in Paris through the 1930s and the Hungarian circle absorbed most of them. Kertész immigrated to New York City in 1936. Brassai befriended many of the new arrivals, including Ervin Marton, a nephew of Tihanyi, whom he had been friends with since 1920. Marton developed his own reputation in street photography in the 1940s and 1950s. Brassaï continued to earn a living with commercial work, also taking photographs for the U.S. magazine &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. He was a founding member of the Rapho agency, created in Paris by Charles Rado in 1933.

Brassaï&#x27;s photographs brought him international fame. In 1948, he had a one-man show at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, which travelled to George Eastman House in Rochester, New York; and the Art Institute of Chicago, Illinois. MoMA exhibited more of Brassai&#x27;s works in 1953, 1956, and 1968.
He was presented at the Rencontres d&#x27;Arles festival in France in 1970 (screening at the Théâtre Antique, &quot;Brassaï&quot; by Jean-Marie Drot), in 1972 (screening &quot;Brassaï si, Vominino&quot; by René Burri), and in 1974 (as guest of honour).

In 1979, Brassaï was inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum.

==Marriage==
In 1948, Brassaï married Gilberte Boyer, a French woman. She worked with him in supporting his photography. In 1949, he became a naturalized French citizen after years of being stateless.

==Death==
Brassaï died on 8 July 1984 at his home on the French Riviera near Nice and was buried at Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris. He was 84 years old.

<doc id="162714" wikidata="Q165632" url="?curid=162714" title="Dust">
<text>Dust is made of fine particles of solid matter. On Earth, it generally consists of particles in the atmosphere that come from various sources such as soil lifted by wind (an aeolian process), volcanic eruptions, and pollution.

Dust in homes is composed of about 20–50% dead skin cells. The rest, and in offices and other built environments, is composed of small amounts of plant pollen, human hairs, animal fur, textile fibers, paper fibers, minerals from outdoor soil, burnt meteorite particles, and many other materials which may be found in the local environment.

==Atmospheric==
Atmospheric or wind-borne fugitive dust, also known as &quot;aeolian dust&quot;, comes from dry regions where high-speed winds can remove mostly silt-sized material, abrading susceptible surfaces. This includes areas where grazing, ploughing, vehicle use, and other human behaviors have further destabilized the land, though not all source areas have been largely affected by anthropogenic impacts. Dust-producing surfaces cover one-third of the global land area. These are made up of hyper-arid regions like the Sahara, which covers 0.9 billion hectares, and drylands, which occupy 5.2 billion hectares.

Dust in the atmosphere is produced by saltation and abrasive sandblasting of sand-sized grains, and it is transported through the troposphere. This airborne dust is considered an aerosol, and once in the atmosphere, it can produce strong local radiative forcing. Saharan dust, in particular, can be transported and deposited as far as the Caribbean and the Amazon basin and may affect air temperature, cause ocean cooling, and alter rainfall amounts.

===Middle East===
Dust in the Middle East has been a historic phenomenon. Recently, because of climate change and the escalating process of desertification, the problem has worsened dramatically. As a multi-factor phenomenon, there is not yet a clear consensus on the sources or potential solutions to the problem.

====Iran====
The dust in Iraq and Iran are migratory systems that move from west to east or east to west in the spring and have the highest intensity, concentration, and extent until mid-summer. The causes of their occurrence are the lack of humidity, dry environment, low rainfall, and annual droughts. Due to the decrease of rainfall in areas such as Iraq and Syria, most of the dust in Iran also originates from the regions of Iraq, Syria, and Jordan.

In addition to the foreign foci, there are areas inside the country that have either formed new dust foci in recent years or were from the past and their extent has increased. Among these areas, parts of southern Tehran, south of Alborz province – which in the past were plains, riverbeds, seasonal lakes, and seasonal reservoirs – and Gavkhoni wetland of Isfahan province can be mentioned because they have become dry and prone to dust. Among other areas that have become dust centers, Qom province, the Qom salt lake and its surroundings can be mentioned, as well as the Urmia lake, which due to strong winds and due to the dryness of the lake and the reduction of its size, some areas of its bed which were underwater in the past are subject to wind erosion.

In Iran, the dust directly affects more than 5 million people and has become a serious government issue recently. In the Khuzestan province, it has led to the severe increase of air pollution. The amount of pollutants in the air has surpassed more than 50 times the normal level several times in a year. Recently, initiatives such as Project-Dust have been established to study dust in the Middle East directly.

The continuation of drought has caused water scarcity or drying up of some wetlands and lakes such as Hamon and Urmia Lake. This has turned them into centers of dust.

Director General of the Office of Desert Affairs of Iran&#x27;s Natural Resources and Watershed Organization stated that according to the data of the 2018 studies, 30 million hectares of land in the country are affected by wind erosion, and 14 million hectares of this area are considered to be the focal points of wind erosion, which causes serious damage to infrastructure.

===Roads===

Dust kicked up by vehicles traveling on roads is a significant source of harmful air pollution. Road dust consists of deposits of vehicle and industrial exhaust gas, particles from tire and brake wear, dust from paved roads or potholes, and dust from construction sites. Road dust is a significant contributor to the generation and release of particulates into the atmosphere. Control of road dust is a significant challenge in urban areas, and also in other locations with high levels of vehicular traffic upon unsealed roads, such as mines and landfills.

&quot;Engine exhaust emissions, especially from those operating on diesel fuel, can be a significant source of fine particle generation from construction sites.&quot; Construction and demolition activities can also produce a large amount of construction waste. The dust and particulates can become fugitive and airborne with vehicle movements both on and outside the sites, especially when it is windy and dry.

Road dust may be suppressed by mechanical methods like street sweeper, vehicles equipped with vacuum cleaners, vegetable oil sprays, or with water sprayers. Calcium chloride can be used. Improvements in automotive engineering have reduced the amount of PM10s produced by road traffic; the proportion representing re-suspension of existing particulates has increased as a result.

==Coal==

Coal dust is responsible for the respiratory disease known as pneumoconiosis, including coal worker&#x27;s pneumoconiosis disease that occurs among coal miners. The danger of coal dust resulted in environmental law regulating workplace air quality in some jurisdictions. In addition, if enough coal dust is dispersed within the air in a given area, in very rare circumstances, it can cause a dust explosion. These circumstances are typically within confined spaces.

==Control==

===Atmospheric===

Most governmental Environmental Protection Agencies, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandate that facilities that generate fugitive dust, minimize or mitigate the production of dust in their operation. The most frequent dust control violations occur at new residential housing developments in urban areas. United States federal law requires that construction sites obtain planning permissions to conduct earth moving and clearing of areas, so that plans to control dust emissions while the work is being carried out are specified. Control measures include such simple practices as spraying construction and demolition sites with water, and preventing the tracking of dust onto adjacent roads.

Some of the issues include:
*Reducing dust related health risks that include allergic reactions, pneumonia and asthmatic attacks.
*Improving visibility and road traffic safety.
*Providing cleaner air, cleaner vehicles and cleaner homes and promoting better health.
*Improving agricultural productivity.
*Reducing vehicle maintenance costs by lowering the levels of dust that clog filters, bearings and machinery.
*Reducing driver fatigue, maintenance on car suspension systems and improving fuel economy in automobiles.
*Increasing cumulative effects—each new application builds on previous progress.

US federal laws require dust control on sources such as vacant lots, unpaved parking lots, and dirt roads. Dust in such places may be suppressed by mechanical methods, including paving or laying down gravel, or stabilizing the surface with water, vegetable oils or other dust suppressants, or by using water misters to suppress dust that is already airborne.

===Domestic===

Dust control is the suppression of solid particles with diameters less than 500micrometers (&quot;i.e.&quot; half a millimeter). Dust poses a health risk to children, older people, and those with respiratory diseases.

House dust can become airborne easily. Care is required when removing dust to avoid causing the dust to become airborne. A feather duster tends to agitate the dust so it lands elsewhere.

Certified HEPA (tested to MIL STD 282) can effectively trap 99.97% of dust at 0.3 micrometers. Not all HEPA filters can effectively stop dust; while vacuum cleaners with HEPA filters, water, or cyclones may filter more effectively than without, they may still exhaust millions of particles per cubic foot of air circulated. Central vacuum cleaners can be effective in removing dust, especially if they are exhausted directly to the outdoors.

Air filters differ greatly in their effectiveness. Laser particle counters are an effective way to measure filter effectiveness; medical grade instruments can test for particles as small as 0.3 micrometers. In order to test for dust in the air, there are several options available. Pre-weighed filter and matched weight filters made from polyvinyl chloride or mixed cellulose ester are suitable for respirable dust (less than 10 micrometers in diameter).

===Dust resistant surfaces===
A dust resistant surface is a state of prevention against dust contamination or damage, by a design or treatment of materials and items in manufacturing or through a repair process . A reduced tacticity of a synthetic layer or covering can protect surfaces and release small molecules that could have remained attached. A panel, container or enclosure with seams may feature types of strengthened structural rigidity or sealant to vulnerable edges and joins.

==Outer space==
Cosmic dust is widely present in outer space, where gas and dust clouds are the primary precursors for planetary systems. The zodiacal light, as seen in a dark night sky, is produced by sunlight reflected from particles of dust in orbit around the Sun. The tails of comets are produced by emissions of dust and ionized gas from the body of the comet. Dust also covers solid planetary bodies, and vast dust storms can occur on Mars which cover almost the entire planet. Interstellar dust is found between the stars, and high concentrations produce diffuse nebulae and reflection nebulae.

Dust is widely present in the galaxy. Ambient radiation heats dust and re-emits radiation into the microwave band, which may distort the cosmic microwave background power spectrum. Dust in this regime has a complicated emission spectrum and includes both thermal dust emission and spinning dust emission.

Dust samples returned from outer space have provided information about conditions of the early solar system. Several spacecraft have sought to gather samples of dust and other materials. Among these craft was &quot;Stardust&quot;, which flew past 81P/Wild in 2004, and returned a capsule of the comet&#x27;s remains to Earth. In 2010 the Japanese &quot;Hayabusa&quot; spacecraft returned samples of dust from the surface of an asteroid.

== Dust mites ==
House dust mites are present indoors wherever humans live. Positive tests for dust mite allergies are extremely common among people with asthma. Dust mites are microscopic arachnids whose primary food is dead human skin cells, but they do not live on living people. They and their feces and other allergens are major constituents of house dust, but because they are so heavy they are not suspended for long in the air. They are generally found on the floor and other surfaces until disturbed (by walking, for example). It could take between twenty minutes and two hours for dust mites to settle back out of the air.

Dust mites are a nesting species that prefer a dark, warm, and humid climate. They flourish in mattresses, bedding, upholstered furniture, and carpets. Their feces include enzymes that are released upon contact with a moist surface, which can happen when a person inhales, and these enzymes can kill cells within the human body. House dust mites did not become a problem until humans began to use textiles, such as western style blankets and clothing.

<text>Emilia-Romagna (, , , ; or ; ) is an administrative region of northern Italy, comprising the historical regions of Emilia and Romagna. Its capital is Bologna. It has an area of , and a population of 4.4 million.

Emilia-Romagna is one of the wealthiest and most developed regions in Europe, with the third highest gross domestic product per capita in Italy. It is also a cultural center, being the home of the University of Bologna, the oldest university in the world. Some of its cities, such as Modena, Parma, Ferrara, and Ravenna, are UNESCO heritage sites. It is a center for food and automobile production (such as Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Maserati). It has coastal resorts such as Cervia, Cesenatico, and Rimini. In 2018, the Lonely Planet guide named Emilia-Romagna as the best place to see in Europe.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Emilia-Romagna&quot; is a legacy of Ancient Rome. &quot;Emilia&quot; derives from the &quot;via Aemilia&quot;, the Roman road connecting Piacenza to Rimini, completed in 187 BC, and named after the consul Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. &quot;Romagna&quot; derives from &quot;Romània&quot;, the name of the Eastern Roman Empire applied to Ravenna by the Lombards when the western Empire had ceased to exist and Ravenna was an outpost of the east (540–751).

== History ==

===Prehistory and antiquity===
Before the Romans took control of present-day Emilia-Romagna, it had been part of the Etruscan world and subsequently that of the Gauls. During the first thousand years of Christianity, trade flourished, as did culture and religion, thanks to the region&#x27;s numerous monasteries.

===Early origins===
The history of Emilia-Romagna dates back to Roman times when the region of Emilia was ruled by imperial judges linked to the nearby regions of either Liguria or Tuscany. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, the Lombards, a Germanic tribe, founded the kingdom of Lombardy in northern and central Italy. This kingdom, which included the region known as Emilia, flourished until the Lombard dynasty was overthrown by the Frankish king Charlemagne in 774. From the 6th to 8th centuries, the region of Romagna was under Byzantine rule and Ravenna was the capital of the Exarchate of Italy within the Eastern Roman Empire. In the 8th century, this region became a province of the Papal States when Pepin, the father of Charlemagne, donated the land to the Pope in 754.

===High Middle Ages to early modern period===
During the 10th century, northern Italy became part of the Holy Roman Empire under the control of the Germanic leader Otto I. The Holy Roman emperors had varying degrees of control over northern Italy until the close of the Middle Ages. In the 12th century, the papacy extended its political influence and city states began to form in opposition to the Holy Roman emperors.

The northern cities, supported by the Pope, formed the Lombard League and reduced the influence of the ruling Hohenstaufen dynasty over their lands. Division between imperial partisans and their opponents created factions called the Guelphs and the Ghibellines which would divide the cities for centuries. For the next few centuries both Emilia and Romagna were ruled by papal legates or representatives of the Pope.

The University of Bologna—the oldest university in the world, established in AD 1088—and its bustling towns kept trade and intellectual life alive. Local nobility like the Este of Ferrara, the Malatesta of Rimini, the Popes of Rome, the Farnese of Parma and Piacenza, and the Duchy of Modena and Reggio, jostled for power and influence.

The House of Este gained a notable profile for its political and military might and its patronage of the arts: it left behind a vast heritage of splendid Renaissance palaces, precious paintings and literary masterpieces, such as the works of Ludovico Ariosto, Torquato Tasso and Matteo Maria Boiardo.

Following the rise of Napoleon, the region of Emilia came under French control. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, there was a growing movement for Italian national unity and independence. In 1848, a revolution in Vienna initiated uprisings against Austrian rule. The following decades saw uprisings in several regions and, in 1861, the Kingdom of Italy was established. During this Italian Unification, the territories of Emilia and Romagna would be incorporated into the new nation.

===Late modern and contemporary===
In the 16th century, most of what would become Emilia-Romagna had been seized by the Papal States, but the territories of Parma, Piacenza, and Modena remained independent until Emilia-Romagna became part of the Italian kingdom between 1859 and 1861.

After the First world war, Emilia-Romagna was at the centre of the so-called Biennio Rosso, a period of left-wing agitations that paved the way for Benito Mussolini&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état in 1922 and the birth of the Fascist regime in Italy. Mussolini, a native of Emilia-Romagna, sponsored the rise of many hierarchs coming from his same region, such as Italo Balbo, Dino Grandi and Edmondo Rossoni.

Towards the end of the Second World War, Emilia-Romagna was occupied by Germany and has been the theatre of numerous Nazi war crimes, such as the Marzabotto massacre in which 770 innocent civilians were brutally executed by German troops.

During the Cold war era, Bologna, traditionally a left-wing city, was particularly hit by political street violence and terrorism; in 1980 a far-right terrorist group detonated a bomb at the city&#x27;s main railway station, killing 85 people and wounding more than 200.

After the referendum of 2006, seven municipalities of Montefeltro were detached from the Province of Pesaro and Urbino (Marche) to join that of Rimini on 15 August 2009. The municipalities are Casteldelci, Maiolo, Novafeltria, Pennabilli, San Leo, Sant&#x27;Agata Feltria and Talamello.

On 20 and 29 May 2012 two powerful earthquakes struck the central area of the region, killing 27 people and causing substantial damages to the region&#x27;s artistic heritage as well as to numerous manufacturing facilities. The 5.8 magnitude earthquake left 14,000 people temporarily homeless.

== Geography ==


The region of Emilia-Romagna consists of nine provinces and covers an area of , ranking sixth in Italy. Nearly half of the region (48%) consists of plains while 27% is hilly and 25% mountainous. The region&#x27;s section of the Apennines is marked by areas of flysch, badland erosion (calanques) and caves. The mountains stretch for more than from the north to the south-east, with only three peaks above 2,000 m – Monte Cimone (2,165 m), Monte Cusna (2,121 m) and Alpe di Succiso (2,017 m).

The plain was formed by the gradual retreat of the sea from the Po basin and by the detritus deposited by the rivers. Almost entirely marshland in ancient times, its history is characterised by the hard work of its people to reclaim and reshape the land in order to achieve a better standard of living.

The geology varies, with lagoons and saline areas in the north and many thermal springs throughout the rest of the region as a result of groundwater rising towards the surface at different periods of history. All the rivers rise locally in the Apennines except for the Po, which has its source in the Alps in Piedmont. The northern border of Emilia-Romagna follows the path of the river for .

The region has temperate broadleaved and mixed forests and the vegetation may be divided into belts: the Common oak-European hornbeam belt (Padan plain and adriatic coast) which is now covered (apart from the Mesóla forest in Province of Ferrara) with fruit orchards and fields of wheat and sugar beet, the Pubescent oak-European hop-hornbeam belt on the lower slopes up to 800–900 m, the European beech-Silver fir belt between 800–900 m and 1,700 m and the final mountain heath belt above 1,700–1,800 m. Emilia-Romagna has two Italian National Parks, the Foreste Casentinesi National Park and the Appennino Tosco-Emiliano National Park.

=== Land use ===
Emilia-Romagna has been a highly populated area since ancient times. Inhabitants over the centuries have radically altered the landscape, building cities, reclaiming wetlands, and establishing large agricultural areas. All these transformations in past centuries changed the aspect of the region, converting large natural areas to cultivation, up until the 1960s. The trend then changed, and agricultural lands began giving way to residential and industrial areas. The increase of urban-industrial areas continued at very high rates until the end of the 2010s. In the same period, hilly and mountainous areas saw an increase in the registration of semi-natural areas, because of the abandonment of agricultural lands.

Land use changes can have strong effects on ecological functions. Human interactions such as agriculture, forestation and deforestation affect soil function, e.g. food and other biomass production, storing, filtering and transformation, habitat and gene pool.

In the Emilia-Romagna plain, which represents half of the region and where three quarters of the population of the region live, the agricultural land area has been reduced by 157 km2 while urban and industrial areas have increased to over 130 km2 between 2003 and 2008. The impact of land use and particularly of the urbanisation of the Emilia-Romagna plain during this period has had some strong consequences in the economic and ecological assessment of the region. The loss of arable land is equivalent to a permanent loss of the capacity to feed 440,000 persons per year from resources grown within the region. The increased water runoff due to soil sealing requires adaptation measures for river and irrigation canals such as the building of retention basins, at a total cost estimated in the order of billions of euros.

In 2000 there were 103,700 farm holdings and in 2010 there were 73,470, or a -29.2% loss in holdings for the region. The total utilised agricultural area (UAA) was in 2000 and in 2014 for a loss of 4.5%, indicating a downturn of smaller farm ownership. During this same timeframe there was a 14.5% decrease in the farm labor workforce.

== Government and politics ==
The Regional Government (&quot;Giunta Regionale&quot;) is presided by the President of the Region (&quot;Presidente della Regione&quot;), who is elected for a five-year term. The Regional Government is composed of the President and the Ministers (&quot;Assessori&quot;), of which there are currently twelve including the Vice President and the Under-Secretary for the President&#x27;s office.

Apart from the province of Piacenza, Emilia-Romagna was historically a stronghold of the Italian Communist Party, forming the Italian &quot;Red Quadrilateral&quot; or sometimes &quot;Red Belt&quot; called with Tuscany, Umbria and Marche. This is probably due to the strength of the anti-fascist resistance around the time of World War II as well as a strong tradition of anti-clericalism dating from the 19th century, when part of the region belonged to the Papal States. The strength of the anti-fascist resistance is one of the main factors, along with the effectiveness of trade-unionism, that led to the dominance of the PCI in the region.

Emilia-Romagna has since World War II been a left-wing stronghold, nowadays led by the Democratic Party, since its creation in 2007.

== Administrative divisions ==

Emilia-Romagna is divided into nine provinces. Apart from the creation of the Metropolitan City of Bologna, plans to reduce the number of provinces from nine to four have been dropped.

== Demographics ==
ISTAT estimates the population of Emilia-Romagna was 4,459,577 on 1 January 2019. The population density, which was equal to 200 inhabitants per km2 in 2019, is close to the national average. The population of this region is traditionally evenly distributed, with no dominant metropolis but rather a line of medium-sized cities along the Via Emilia, where two thirds of the population and the majority of the industrial production are concentrated. The coast of Romagna is also densely populated due to the booming seaside tourism in recent decades. In the peripheral areas of the Apennine Mountains and the agricultural plains around Ferrara and Piacenza, the population is less dense.

===Cities, towns and metropolitan areas===

The region has nine cities with populations exceeding one hundred thousand: Bologna, Parma, Modena, Reggio Emilia, Ravenna, Rimini, Ferrara, Forlì and Piacenza. These cities rank among the 50 most populous in Italy. The regional capital, Bologna, has about 400,000 inhabitants and lies at the heart of a metropolitan area of about one million residents.

===Immigration and ethnicity===

Between 1876 and 1976, about 1.2 million people emigrated from Emilia-Romagna to other countries. , there were 119,369 people from this region living outside Italy, particularly in Argentina, Switzerland, France, the United Kingdom and Brazil. , the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) estimated that 365,687 foreign-born immigrants lived in Emilia-Romagna, equal to 8.5% of the total regional population.

===Language===

Apart from standard Italian, Emilian and Romagnolo, two closely related languages that are part of the Emiliano-Romagnolo language family, are the local languages of Emilia-Romagna. They are Romance languages spoken in the region, in Northern Marche and other nearby areas such as parts of Massa-Carrara, Mantua, Pavia and Rovigo provinces and in San Marino. The Sillaro river ( in Emilian), near the town of Castel San Pietro Terme, is the border between Emilia and Romagna. They belong to the Northern Italian group within Romance languages (like Piedmontese, Lombard, Ligurian and Venetian), which is included in the wider group of western Romance languages (including French, Occitan and Catalan). They are considered minority languages, structurally separated from Italian by the Ethnologue and by the &quot;Red Book of Endangered Languages&quot; of UNESCO.

== Economy ==

Emilia-Romagna today is considered one of the richest European regions and the third wealthiest Italian region by gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. These results have been achieved by developing a balanced integration of agriculture and manufacturing and of different industries.


===Agriculture===
In spite of the depth and variety of industrial activities in the region, agriculture has not been eclipsed. Emilia-Romagna is among the leading regions in the country, with farming contributing 5.8% of the gross regional product. The agricultural sector has aimed for increased competitiveness by means of structural reorganisation and high-quality products, and this has led to the success of marketed brands. Cereals, potatoes, maize, tomatoes and onions are the most important products, along with fruit and grapes for the production of wine (of which the best known are Emilia&#x27;s Lambrusco, Bologna&#x27;s , Romagna&#x27;s Sangiovese and white Albana). Alongside cereals, which for centuries remained the first local product, the cultivation of fruit trees has developed (especially peaches, but also apricots, plums, apples and pears).

Cattle and pig breeding are also highly developed. Farm cooperatives have been working along these lines in recent years. With their long tradition in the region there are now about 8,100 cooperatives, generally in the agricultural sector and mainly located in the provinces of Bologna (2,160) and Forlì-Cesena (1,300).

===Industry===
The regional economy is more geared to export markets than other regions in the country: the main exports are from mechanical engineering (53%), the extraction of non-metallic minerals (13%) and the clothing industry (10%). Industry in the region presents a varied and complex picture and is located along the Via Emilia.

The food industry (e.g. Barilla, Parmalat, Granarolo, Zanetti, Grandi Salumifici Italiani, Cremonini, Fini, Conserve Italia) is particularly concentrated in Parma, Modena and Bologna. Very important is production of Parma ham, Parmesan and Grana Padano cheeses, Modena balsamic vinegar, and Mortadella sausages. It is not restricted to these famous products, but also include production of sausages, other cheese, dairy products, coffee, sugar, fruit and vegetable conserves and stuffed pasta.

Automotive industry produces sports cars (Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati, Pagani), trucks (Astra), buses (Menarinibus) and motorcycles (Ducati, Bimota).

Machine building is well-developed and represented with fork-lifts (OM Still, FMTH Fantuzzi), skid-steer loader (CNH Industrial), tractors (Argo, Goldoni, Arbos), motors (VM Motori, Lombardini), vehicle gas-fuel equipment (Landi Renzo), undercarriages (ThyssenKrupp Berco), ceramic machine (SACMI), packaging machine (, SACMI, IMA), pumps (Interpump), wood-working machine tools (SCM Group), home appliance (Smeg, Saeco), automatic data capture equipment (Datalogic) etc.

There is a in Ferrara, where different companies manufacturing polyethylene, polypropylene, synthetic rubber and nitrogenous fertilizers. Other industrial park is Mirandola Biomedical District. In Parma there is pharmaceutical manufacturing from Chiesi Farmaceutici.

Sport and fitness articles is manufacturing by Technogym in Cesena.

The ceramic sector is concentrated in Faenza and Sassuolo.

Footwear industry is well developed and located in 2 industrial districts San Mauro Pascoli and between Fusignano and Bagnacavallo.

===Tourism===
Tourism is increasingly important, especially along the Adriatic coastline and the cities of art. The most popular location for seaside tourism is Rimini. Emilia-Romagna has many small and picturesque villages, 16 of them have been selected by (), a non-profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest, that was founded on the initiative of the Tourism Council of the National Association of Italian Municipalities.

=== Unemployment rate ===
The unemployment rate stood at 5.1% in 2022 and was lower than the national average of 8.1%.
==Transport==
The region of Emilia-Romagna has a very good system of transport, with 574 km of motorways, 1,053 km of railways and airports in Bologna, Forlì, Parma and Rimini. The main motorway crosses the region from north-west (Piacenza) to the south-east (Adriatic coast), connecting the main cities of Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, and from here further to Ravenna, Rimini and the Adriatic coast.
==Culture==
===Cinema===
Emilia-Romagna has given birth to a number of important filmmakers and actors and was the main setting for numerous important movies. Bernardo Bertolucci was a native from Parma and his 1976 masterpiece, &quot;1900&quot;, was partially set in Emilia-Romagna. Federico Fellini, a native of Rimini, shot many movies in the region, among them &quot;Amarcord&quot;.

===Cuisine and gastronomy===

Emilia-Romagna is considered one of the richest regions of Italy with regard to its gastronomic and wine-making tradition. The region is known for its egg and filled pasta made with soft wheat flour. Bologna is notable for pasta dishes like &quot;tortellini&quot;, &quot;lasagne&quot;, &quot;gramigna&quot; and &quot;tagliatelle&quot; made by &quot;sfoglini&quot; out of &quot;sfoglia&quot;. These are found also in many other parts of the region in different declinations. The Romagna subregion is known as well for pasta dishes like &quot;garganelli&quot;, &quot;strozzapreti&quot;, &quot;sfoglia lorda&quot; and &quot;tortelli alla lastra&quot;. In the Emilia subregion, except Piacenza which is heavily influenced by the cuisines of Lombardia where rice is more common, rice is eaten to a lesser extent. &quot;Polenta&quot;, a maize-based dish, is common both in Emilia and Romagna. The celebrated balsamic vinegar is made only in the Emilian cities of Modena and Reggio Emilia, following legally binding traditional procedures. Parmigiano Reggiano (Parmesan Cheese) is produced in Reggio Emilia, Parma, Modena and Bologna and is much used in cooking, while Grana Padano variety is produced in the rest of the region.

Although the Adriatic coast is a major fishing area which produces eels and clams, the region produces more meat products, especially pork-based, including Parma&#x27;s &quot;prosciutto&quot;, &quot;culatello&quot; and &quot;Salame Felino&quot;, Piacenza&#x27;s &quot;pancetta&quot;, &quot;coppa&quot; and salami, Bologna&#x27;s &quot;mortadella&quot; and &quot;salame rosa&quot;, Modena&#x27;s &quot;zampone&quot;, &quot;cotechino&quot; and &quot;cappello del prete&quot; and Ferrara&#x27;s &quot;salama da sugo&quot;. Reggio Emilia is the origin of the fresh egg-made pasta &quot;cappelletti&quot; (similar to Bologna&#x27;s tortellini but differing in size), the typical &quot;Erbazzone Reggiano&quot; (Emilian spinach cheese pie) and &quot;Parmigiano Reggiano&quot; salted cake, and &quot;Gnocco Fritto&quot;, mixed flour stripes fried in boiling oil, eaten in combination with ham or salami. &quot;Crescentina&quot; is a thin round bread that originates in the Apennines around Modena and is usually filled with &quot;cunza&quot; (a spread made from pork lard and flavoured with garlic and rosemary) or with cold cuts, cheese and salty dressings or sweet spreads. Piacenza and Ferrara are also known for some dishes prepared with horse and donkey meat. Regional desserts include &quot;zuppa inglese&quot; (custard-based dessert made with sponge cake and Alchermes liqueur) and &quot;panpepato&quot; (Christmas cake made with pepper, chocolate, spices, and almonds). An exhaustive list of the most important regional wines should include Sangiovese from Romagna, Lambrusco from Reggio Emilia or Modena, Cagnina di Romagna, Gutturnio and Trebbiano from Piacenza.

=== Music ===
Emilia-Romagna gave birth to one of the most important composers in the history of music, Giuseppe Verdi, as well as Arturo Toscanini, one of the most acclaimed conductors of the 20th century, and the operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti.

The region is well known in Italy for its rock and folk musicians, such as Laura Pausini, Raffaella Carrà, Samuele Bersani, Luciano Ligabue, Lucio Dalla, Francesco Guccini, Vasco Rossi and Zucchero. &quot;Romagna mia&quot;, a song written in 1954 by Secondo Casadei, is considered by many as the unofficial anthem of Romagna.

Ducati Corse is the motorsports division of Ducati&#x27;s motorcycle company, being the predominant Italian constructor in MotoGP and the Superbike World Championship. Ducati has won two MotoGP titles, with Australian Casey Stoner in 2007 and with Italian Pecco Bagnaia in 2022. Stoner is also the most successful rider for the team in MotoGP, having won 23 Grands Prix in his four seasons. Ducati have had multiple World Champions Valentino Rossi and Jorge Lorenzo race for the team. In 2017, Emilia-Romagna native Andrea Dovizioso finished second in the MotoGP championship for Ducati. The team has frequently had at least one Italian rider in its factory team since its entry into the premier class in 2003 at the beginning of the four-stroke engine era. Its first Grand Prix winner was Emilia-Romagna native Loris Capirossi in the team&#x27;s inaugural season. Ducati have also won multiple Superbike titles with riders such as Carl Fogarty, Troy Bayliss, and Alvaro Bautista being among title winners.

Aside from Dovizioso and Capirossi, high-profile racers such as Marco Melandri and Marco Simoncelli have also come out of Emilia-Romagna. Simoncelli died in an accident when he was run over on track in the 2011 Malaysian Grand Prix at the age of 24, and was honoured by having the Misano World Circuit named after him.

Emilia-Romagna have two major international race circuits; Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in Imola and the aforementioned circuit in Misano Adriatico. Imola used to host Formula One between 1980 and 2006, under the banner of San Marino Grand Prix on all but one occasion; as well as hosting two non-championship races in 1963 and 1979. The track was the site for the fatal crash of three-time world champion Ayrton Senna on 1 May 1994, along with a fatal crash the day before of Austrian Roland Ratzenberger. The track was rebuilt after the tragedies and returned to the calendar in a new guise already the following year. Imola was a happy hunting ground for Emilia-Romagna team Scuderia Ferrari during the era on the re-built track, with Michael Schumacher winning the race five times in front of the home crowd. In 2020, Imola returned to the calendar due to the COVID-19 pandemic and hosted the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix.

<text>Kamal Ahmed (; born May 7, 1966), commonly known as Kamal, is an American director, comedian, and a former member of prank phone call comedy group The Jerky Boys.

==Early life and career==
Kamal was born in East New York, Brooklyn and raised in Astoria, Queens and the Lower East Side of Manhattan. His father, Manir Ahmed, a former chemical engineer, started the restaurant &quot;Shah Bagh&quot; in the East Village, which eventually led to him owning a string of Indian restaurants in an area that became known as &quot;Little India&quot;. Kamal&#x27;s mother, originally from Trinidad &amp; Tobago, worked for the United Nations. His sister, a chemical engineer, has worked for major pharmaceutical companies. Kamal developed an early interest in music and has become an accomplished bass guitar player and scores many of his productions.

Kamal was a founding member of The Jerky Boys and co-starred with John G. Brennan in the 1995 Touchstone comedy film &quot;The Jerky Boys: The Movie&quot;. He played &quot;Kissel&quot;, a World War II veteran; &quot;Tarbash the Egyptian Magician;&quot; &quot;Curly G. Cradle-Rock&quot;, and other characters on the Jerky Boys albums. Kamal also appeared in &quot;Punch&quot;, a 1994 episode of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;. Tensions began to rise between Brennan and Kamal during the filming of &quot;The Jerky Boys&quot; movie and their collaboration deteriorated further during the production of &quot;Big Money Hustlas&quot;, in which Kamal appeared in a cameo appearance.

In 2000, Kamal released a solo album titled &quot;Once a Jerk, Always a Jerk.&quot; He has made multiple television and radio appearances, including on Late Night with David Letterman, Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien and The Howard Stern Show. Kamal has also acted in and directed several films, including &quot;Laugh Killer Laugh&quot;, which was completed in 2015. In 2022, Kamal released his first mini-series, &quot;Crash the System&quot;, which was distributed on streaming media platforms worldwide.

== Filmography ==
, Kamal has directed 8 full-length films and 1 TV mini series.

<text>Embryology (from Greek ἔμβρυον, &quot;embryon&quot;, &quot;the unborn, embryo&quot;; and -λογία, &quot;-logia&quot;) is the branch of animal biology that studies the prenatal development of gametes (sex cells), fertilization, and development of embryos and fetuses. Additionally, embryology encompasses the study of congenital disorders that occur before birth, known as teratology.

Early embryology was proposed by Marcello Malpighi, and known as preformationism, the theory that organisms develop from pre-existing miniature versions of themselves. Aristotle proposed the theory that is now accepted, epigenesis. Epigenesis is the idea that organisms develop from seed or egg in a sequence of steps. Modern embryology developed from the work of Karl Ernst von Baer, though accurate observations had been made in Italy by anatomists such as Aldrovandi and Leonardo da Vinci in the Renaissance.

== Comparative embryology ==

=== Preformationism and epigenesis ===
As recently as the 18th century, the prevailing notion in western human embryology was preformation: the idea that semen contains an embryo – a preformed, miniature infant, or &quot;homunculus&quot; – that simply becomes larger during development.

The competing explanation of embryonic development was &quot;epigenesis&quot;, originally proposed 2,000 years earlier by Aristotle. Much early embryology came from the work of the Italian anatomists Aldrovandi, Aranzio, Leonardo da Vinci, Marcello Malpighi, Gabriele Falloppio, Girolamo Cardano, Emilio Parisano, Fortunio Liceti, Stefano Lorenzini, Spallanzani, Enrico Sertoli, and Mauro Ruscóni. According to epigenesis, the form of an animal emerges gradually from a relatively formless egg. As microscopy improved during the 19th century, biologists could see that embryos took shape in a series of progressive steps, and epigenesis displaced preformation as the favored explanation among embryologists.

==== Cleavage ====
Cleavage is the very beginning steps of a developing embryo. Cleavage refers to the many mitotic divisions that occur after the egg is fertilized by the sperm. The ways in which the cells divide is specific to certain types of animals and may have many forms.

==== Holoblastic ====
Holoblastic cleavage is the complete division of cells. Holoblastic cleavage can be radial (see: Radial cleavage), spiral (see: Spiral cleavage), bilateral (see: Bilateral cleavage), or rotational (see: Rotational cleavage). In holoblastic cleavage, the entire egg will divide and become the embryo, whereas in meroblastic cleavage, some cells will become the embryo and others will be the yolk sac.

==== Meroblastic ====
Meroblastic cleavage is the incomplete division of cells. The division furrow does not protrude into the yolky region as those cells impede membrane formation and this causes the incomplete separation of cells. Meroblastic cleavage can be bilateral (see: Bilateral cleavage), discoidal (see: Discoidal cleavage), or centrolecithal (see: Centrolecithal).

=== Basal phyla ===
Animals that belong to the basal phyla have holoblastic radial cleavage which results in radial symmetry (see: Symmetry in biology). During cleavage, there is a central axis that all divisions rotate about. The basal phyla also has only one to two embryonic cell layers, compared to the three in bilateral animals (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm).

=== Bilaterians ===
In bilateral animals, cleavage can be either holoblastic or meroblastic depending on the species. During gastrulation, the blastula develops in one of two ways that divide the whole animal kingdom into two-halves (see: &quot;Embryological origins of the mouth and anus&quot;). If in the blastula, the first pore, or blastopore, becomes the mouth of the animal, it is a protostome; if the blastopore becomes the anus, then it is a deuterostome. The protostomes include most invertebrate animals, such as insects, worms and molluscs, while the deuterostomes include a few invertebrates such as the echinoderms (starfish and relatives) and all the vertebrates. In due course, the blastula changes into a more differentiated structure called the gastrula. Soon after the gastrula is formed, three distinct layers of cells (the germ layers) from which all the bodily organs and tissues then develop.

==== Germ layers ====
* The innermost layer, or endoderm, give rise to the digestive organs, the gills, lungs or swim bladder if present, and kidneys or nephrites.
* The middle layer, or mesoderm, gives rise to the muscles, skeleton if any, and blood system.
* The outer layer of cells, or ectoderm, gives rise to the nervous system, including the brain, and skin or carapace and hair, bristles, or scales.

====&quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; (fruit fly)====
Drosophila have been used as a developmental model for many years. The studies that have been conducted have discovered many useful aspects of development that not only apply to fruit flies but other species as well.

Outlined below is the process that leads to cell and tissue differentiation.

# Maternal-effect genes help to define the anterior-posterior axis using Bicoid (gene) and Nanos (gene).
# Gap genes establish 3 broad segments of the embryo.
# Pair-rule genes define 7 segments of the embryo within the confines of the second broad segment that was defined by the gap genes.
# Segment-polarity genes define another 7 segments by dividing each of the pre-existing 7 segments into anterior and posterior halves using a gradient of Hedgehog and Wnt.
# Homeotic (Hox) genes use the 14 segments as pinpoints for specific types of cell differentiation and the histological developments that correspond to each cell type.

====Humans====

Humans are bilateral animals that have holoblastic rotational cleavage. Humans are also deuterostomes. In regard to humans, the term embryo refers to the ball of dividing cells from the moment the zygote implants itself in the uterus wall until the end of the eighth week after conception. Beyond the eighth week after conception (tenth week of pregnancy), the developing human is then called a fetus.

== Evolutionary embryology ==
Evolutionary embryology is the expansion of comparative embryology by the ideas of Charles Darwin. Similarly to Karl Ernst von Baer&#x27;s principles that explained why many species often appear similar to one another in early developmental stages, Darwin argued that the relationship between groups can be determined based upon common embryonic and larval structures.

=== Von Baer&#x27;s principles ===

# The general features appear earlier in development than do the specialized features.
# More specialized characters develop from the more general ones.
# The embryo of a given species never resembles the adult form of a lower one.
# The embryo of a given species does resemble the embryonic form of a lower one.

Using Darwin&#x27;s theory evolutionary embryologists have since been able to distinguish between homologous and analogous structures between varying species. Homologous structures are those that the similarities between them are derived from a common ancestor, such as the human arm and bat wings. Analogous structures are those that appear to be similar but have no common ancestral derivation.

== Origins of modern embryology ==
Until the birth of modern embryology through observation of the mammalian ovum by Karl Ernst von Baer in 1827, there was no clear scientific understanding of embryology, although later discussions in this article show that some cultures had a fairly refined understanding of some of the principles. Only in the late 1950s when ultrasound was first used for uterine scanning, was the true developmental chronology of human fetus available. Karl Ernst von Baer along with Heinz Christian Pander, also proposed the germ layer theory of development which helped to explain how the embryo developed in progressive steps. Part of this explanation explored why embryos in many species often appear similar to one another in early developmental stages using his four principles.

=== Modern embryology research ===
Embryology is central to evolutionary developmental biology (&quot;evo-devo&quot;), which studies the genetic control of the development process (e.g. morphogens), its link to cell signalling, its roles in certain diseases and mutations, and its links to stem cell research. Embryology is the key to Gestational Surrogacy, which is when the sperm of the intended father and egg of intended mother are fused in a lab forming an embryo. This embryo is then put into the surrogate who carries the child to term.

== Medical embryology ==
Medical embryology is used widely to detect abnormalities before birth. 2-5% of babies are born with an observable abnormality and medical embryology explores the different ways and stages that these abnormalities appear in. Genetically derived abnormalities are referred to as malformations. When there are multiple malformations, this is considered a syndrome. When abnormalities appear due to outside contributors, these are disruptions. The outside contributors causing disruptions are known as teratogens. Common teratogens are alcohol, retinoic acid, ionizing radiation or hyperthermic stress.

== Vertebrate and invertebrate embryology ==
Many principles of embryology apply to invertebrates as well as to vertebrates. Therefore, the study of invertebrate embryology has advanced the study of vertebrate embryology. However, there are many differences as well. For example, numerous invertebrate species release a larva before development is complete; at the end of the larval period, an animal for the first time comes to resemble an adult similar to its parent or parents. Although invertebrate embryology is similar in some ways for different invertebrate animals, there are also countless variations. For instance, while spiders proceed directly from egg to adult form, many insects develop through at least one larval stage.
For decades, a number of so-called normal staging tables were produced for the embryology of particular species, mainly focussing on external developmental characters. As variation in developmental progress makes comparison among species difficult, a character-based Standard Event System was developed, which documents these differences and allows for phylogenetic comparisons among species.

== Birth of developmental biology ==
After the 1950s, with the DNA helical structure being unraveled and the increasing knowledge in the field of molecular biology, developmental biology emerged as a field of study which attempts to correlate the genes with morphological change, and so tries to determine which genes are responsible for each morphological change that takes place in an embryo, and how these genes are regulated.
As of today, human embryology is taught as a cornerstone subject in medical schools, as well as in biology and zoology programs at both an undergraduate and graduate level.

==History==

===Ancient Egypt===
Knowledge of the placenta goes back at least to ancient Egypt, where it was viewed as the seat of the soul. There was an Egyptian official with the title &quot;Opener of the Kings Placenta&quot;. An Egyptian text from the time of Akhenaten said that a human originates from the egg that grows in women.

===Ancient Asia===
Various interpretations of embryology have existed in Asia throughout history. Included in the ancient Indian tradition of Ayurveda is &quot;garbhasharir&quot; or the study of embryology, which refers to conceptions of embryology from antiquity. Descriptions of the amniotic sac appear in the &quot;Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavata Purana&quot;, and the &quot;Sushruta Samhita&quot;. One of the Upanishads known as the &quot;Garbhopanisaḍ&quot; states that the embryo is &quot;like water in the first night, in seven nights it is like a bubble, at the end of half a month it becomes a ball. At the end of a month it is hardened, in two months the head is formed&quot;. In Indian literature, the start of consciousness in an embryo is not clearly defined. Some scriptures state that it is active at conception, while others suggest that consciousness begins in the seventh to ninth month of fetal development. Many South Asian traditions, including some Tibetan traditions, believe that the fetus has conscious experiences towards the end of its development. 

The development of the human embryo is mentioned in the ancient Buddhist text of Garbhāvakrāntisūtra (1st-4th century CE). It mentions the human gestation period of 38 days. The text describes embryonic development in first three weeks as a liquid part of yogurt and the differentiation of body parts such as arms, leg, feet and head in the third month.

===Ancient Greece===
====Pre-Socratic philosophers====
Many pre-Socratic philosophers are recorded as having opinions on different aspects of embryology, although there is some bias in the description of their views in later authors such as Aristotle. According to Empedocles (whose views are described by Plutarch in the 1st century AD), who lived in the 5th century BC, the embryo derives and receives its blood from four vessels in all; two arteries and two veins. He also held sinews as originating from equal mixtures of earth and air. He further said men begin to form within the first month and are finished within fifty days. Asclepiades agreed that men are formed within fifty days, but he believed that women took a full two months to be fully knit. One observation, variously attributed to either Anaxagoras of Clazomenae or Alcmaeon of Croton, says that the milk produced by mammals is analogous to the white of fowl egg. Diogenes of Apollonia said that a mass of flesh forms first, only then followed by the development of bone and nerves. Diogenes recognized that the placenta was a nutritional source for the growing fetus. He also said that the development of males took four months, but that the development of females took five months. He did not think the embryo was alive. Alcmaeon also made some contributions, and he is the first person reported to have practiced dissection. One idea, first stated by Parmenides, was that there was a connection between the right side of the body and the male embryo, and between the left side of the body and the female embryo. According to Democritus and Epicurus, the fetus is nourished at the mouth inside the mother and there are comparable teats that supply this nourishment within the mother&#x27;s body to the fetus. Discussion on various views regarding how long it takes for specific parts of the embryo to form appear in an anonymous document known as the &quot;Nutriment&quot;.

Ancient Greeks discussed whether only the male had a seed which developed into the embryo within the female womb, or both the male and the female each had a seed that made a contribution to the developing embryo. The difficulty that one-seed theorists confronted was to explain the maternal resemblance of the progeny. One issue that two-seed theorists confronted was why the female seed was needed if the male already had a seed. One common solution to this problem was to assert that the female seed was either inferior or inactive. Another question was the origin of the seed. The encephalomyelogenic theory stated that the seed originated from the brain or and/or bone marrow. Later came pangenesis, which asserted the seed was drawn from the whole body in order to explain the general resemblance in the body of the offspring. Later on hematogenous theory developed which asserted that the seed was drawn from the blood. A third question was how or in what form the progeny existed in the seed prior to developing into an embryo and a fetus. According to preformationists, the body of the progeny already existed in a pre-existing but undeveloped form in the seed. Three variants of preformationism were homoiomerous preformationism, anhomoiomerous preformationism, and homuncular preformationism. According to the first, the homoiomerous parts of the body (e.g. humors, bone) already exist pre-formed in the seed. The second held that it was the anhomoiomerous parts that were pre-formed. Finally, the third view held that the whole was already a unified organic thing. Preformationism was not the only view. According to epigenesists, parts of the embryo successively form after conception takes place.

====Hippocrates====
Some of the most well-known early ideas on embryology come from Hippocrates and the Hippocratic Corpus, where discussion on the embryo is usually given in the context of discussing obstetrics (pregnancy and childbirth). Some of the most relevant Hippocratic texts on embryology include the &quot;Regimen on Acute Diseases&quot;, &quot;On Semen&quot;, and &quot;On the Development of the Child&quot;. Hippocrates claimed that the development of the embryo is put into motion by fire and that nourishment comes from food and breath introduced into the mother. An outer layer of the embryo solidifies, and the fire within consumes humidity which makes way for development of bone and nerve. The fire in the innermost part becomes the belly and air channels are developed in order to route nourishment to it. The enclosed fire also helps form veins and allows for circulation. In this description, Hippocrates aims at describing the causes of development rather than describing what develops. Hippocrates also develops views similar to preformationism, where he claims that all parts of the embryo simultaneously develop. Hippocrates also believed that maternal blood nourishes the embryo. This blood flows and coagulates to help form the flesh of the fetus. This idea was derived from the observation that menstrual blood ceases during pregnancy, which Hippocrates took to imply that it was being redirected to fetal development. Hippocrates also claimed that the flesh differentiates into different organs of the body, and Hippocrates saw as analogous an experiment where a mixture of substances placed into water will differentiate into different layers. Comparing the seed to the embryo, Hippocrates further compared the stalk to the umbilical cord.

====Aristotle====

Some embryological discussion appears in the writings of Aristotle&#x27;s predecessor Plato, especially in his &quot;Timaeus&quot;. One of his views were that the bone marrow acted as the seedbed, and that the soul itself was the seed out of which the embryo developed, though he did not explain how this development proceeded. Scholars also continue to debate the views he held on various other aspects of embryology. However, a much more voluminous discussion on the subject comes from the writings of Aristotle, especially as appears in his &quot;On the Generation of Animals&quot;. Some ideas related to embryology also appear in his &quot;History of Animals&quot;, &quot;On the Parts of Animals&quot;, &quot;On Respiration&quot;, and &quot;On the Motion of Animals&quot;. Means by which we know Aristotle studied embryology, and most likely his predecessors as well, was through studying developing embryos taken out from animals as well as aborted and miscarried human embryos. Aristotle believed that the female supplied the matter for the development of the embryo, formed from the menstrual blood whereas the semen that comes from the male shapes that matter. Aristotle&#x27;s belief that both the male and female made a contribution to the actual fetus goes against some prior beliefs. According to Aeschylus and some Egyptian traditions, the fetus solely develops from the male contribution and that the female womb simply nourishes this growing fetus. On the other hand, the Melanesians held that the fetus is solely a product of the female contribution. Aristotle did not believe there were any external influences on the development of the embryo. Against Hippocrates, Aristotle believed that new parts of the body developed over time rather than all forming immediately and developing from then on. He also considered whether each new part derives from a previously formed part or develops independently of any previously formed part. On the basis that different parts of the body do not resemble each other, he decided in favor of the latter view. He also described development of fetal parts in terms of mechanical and automatic processes. In terms of the development of the embryo, he says it begins in a liquid-like state as the material secreted by the female combines with the semen of the male, and then the surface begins to solidify as it interacts with processes of heating and cooling. The first part of the body to differentiate is the heart, which Aristotle and many of his contemporaries believed was the location of reason and thinking. Aristotle claimed that vessels join to the uterus in order to supply nourishment to the developing fetus. Some of the most solid parts of the fetus cool and, as they lose moisture to heat, turn into nails, horns, hoofs, beaks, etc. Internal heat dries away moisture and forms sinews and bones and the skin results from drying of the flesh. Aristotle also describes the development of birds in eggs at length. He further described embryonic development in dolphins, some sharks, and many other animals. Aristotle singularly wrote more on embryology than any other pre-modern author, and his influence on the subsequent discussion on the subject for many centuries was immense, introducing into the subject forms of classification, a comparative method from various animals, discussion of the development of sexual characteristics, compared the development of the embryo to mechanistic processes, and so forth.

====Later Greek embryology====
Reportedly, some Stoics claimed that most parts of the body formed at once during embryological development. Some Epicureans claimed that the fetus is nourished by either the amniotic fluid or the blood, and that both male and female supply material to the development of the fetus. According to the writings of Tertullian, Herophilus in the 5th century BC described the ovaries and fallopian tubes (but not past what was already described by Aristotle) and also dissected some embryos. One advance Herophilus made, against the conceptions of other individuals such as Aristotle, was that the brain was the center of intellect rather than the heart. Though not a part of Greek tradition, in Job 10, the formation of the embryo is likened to the curdling of milk into cheese, as described by Aristotle. Whereas Needham sees this statement in Job as part of the Aristotelian tradition, others see it as evidence that the milk analogy predates the Aristotelian Greek tradition and originates in Jewish circles. In addition, the Wisdom of Solomon (7:2) also has the embryo formed from menstrual blood. Soranus of Ephesus also wrote texts on embryology which went into use for a long time. Some rabbinic texts discuss the embryology of a female Greek writer named Cleopatra, a contemporary of Galen and Soranus, who was said to have claimed that the male fetus is complete in 41 days whereas the female fetus is complete in 81 days. Various other texts of less importance also appear and describe various aspects of embryology, though without making much progress from Aristotle. Plutarch has a chapter in one of his works titled &quot;Whether was before, the hen or egg?&quot; Discussion on embryological tradition also appears in many Neoplatonic traditions.

Next to Aristotle, the most impactful and important Greek writer on biology was Galen of Pergamum, and his works were transmitted throughout the Middle Ages. Galen discusses his understanding of embryology in two of his texts, those being his &quot;On the Natural Faculties&quot; and his &quot;On the Formation of the Foetus&quot;. There is an additional text spuriously attributed to Galen known as &quot;On the Question of whether the Embryo is an Animal&quot;. Galen described embryological development in four stages. In the first stage, the semen predominates. In the second stage, the embryo is filled with blood. In the third stage, the main outlines of the organs have developed but various other parts remain undeveloped. In the fourth stage, formation is complete and has reached a stage where we can call it a child. Galen described processes that played a role in furthering development of the embryo such as warming, drying, cooling, and combinations thereof. As this development plays out, the form of life of the embryo also moves from that like a plant to that of an animal (where the analogy between the root and umbilical cord is made). Galen claimed that the embryo forms from menstrual blood, by which his experimental analogy was that when you cut the vein of an animal and allow blood to flow out and into some mildly heated water, a sort of coagulation can be observed. He gave detailed descriptions of the position of the umbilical cord relative to other veins.

===Patristics===

The question of embryology is discussed among a number of early Christian writers, largely in terms of theological questions such as whether the fetus has value and/or when it begins to have value. (Although a number of Christian authors continued the classical discussions on the description of the development of the embryo, such as Jacob of Serugh. Passing reference to the embryo also appears in the eighth hymn of Ephrem the Syrian&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Hymns&quot;.) Many patristic treatments of embryology continued in the stream of Greek tradition. The earlier Greek and Roman view that it was not was reversed and all pre-natal infanticide was condemned. Tertullian held that the soul was present from the moment of conception. The Quinisext Council concluded that &quot;we pay no attention to the subtle division as to whether the foetus is formed or unformed&quot;. In this time, then, the Roman practice of child exposure came to an end, where unwanted yet birthed children, usually females, were discarded by the parents to die. Other more liberal traditions followed Augustine, who instead viewed that the animation of life began on the 40th day in males and the 80th day in females but not prior. Before the 40th day for men and 80th day for women, the embryo was referred to as the &quot;embryo informatus&quot;, and after this period was reached, it was referred to as the &quot;embryo formatus&quot;. The notion originating from the Greeks that the male embryo developed faster remained in various authors until it was experimentally disproven by Andreas Ottomar Goelicke in 1723.

Various patristic literature from backgrounds ranging from Nestorian, Monophysite and Chalcedonian discuss and choose between three different conceptions on the relation between the soul and the embryo. According to one view, the soul pre-exists and enters the embryo at the moment of conception (&quot;prohyparxis&quot;). According to a second view, the soul enters into existence at the moment of conception (&quot;synhyparxis&quot;). In a third view, the soul enters into the body after it has been formed (&quot;methyparxis&quot;). The first option was proposed by Origen, but was increasingly rejected after the fourth century. On the other hand, the other two options were equally accepted after this point. The second position appears to have been proposed as a response to Origen&#x27;s notion of a pre-existing soul. After the sixth century, the second position was also increasingly seen as Origenist and so rejected on those grounds. The writings of Origen were condemned during the Second Origenist Crises in 553. Those defending &quot;prohyparxis&quot; usually appealed to the Platonic notion of an eternally moving soul. Those defending the second position also appealed to Plato but rejected his notion on the eternality of the soul. Finally, those appealing to the third position appealed both to Aristotle and scripture. Aristotelian notions included the progression of the development of the soul, from an initial plant-like soul, to a sensitive soul found in animals and allows for movement and perception, and finally the formation of a rational soul which can only be found in the fully-formed human. Furthermore, some scriptural texts were seen as implying the formation of the soul temporally after the formation of the body (namely Genesis 2:7; Exodus 21:22-23; Zachariah 12:1). In the &quot;De hominis opificio&quot; of Gregory of Nyssa, Aristotle&#x27;s triparitate notion of the soul was accepted. Gregory also held that the rational soul was present at conception. Theodoret argued based on Genesis 2:7 and Exodus 21:22 that the embryo is only ensouled after the body is fully formed. Based on Exodus 21:22 and Zachariah 12:1, the Monophysite Philoxenus of Mabbug claimed that the soul was created in the body forty days after conception. In his &quot;De opificio mundi&quot;, the Christian philosopher John Philoponus claimed that the soul is formed after the body. Later still, the author Leontius held that the body and soul were created simultaneously, though it is also possible he held that the soul pre-existed the body.

Some Monophysites and Chalcedonians seemed to have been compelled into accepting &quot;synhyparxis&quot; in the case of Jesus because of their view that the incarnation of Christ resulted in both one hypostasis and one nature, whereas some Nestorians claimed that Christ, like us, must have had his soul formed after the formation of his body because, per Hebrews 4:15, Christ was like us in all ways but sin. (On the other hand, Leontinus dismissed the relevance of Hebrews 4:15 on the basis that Christ differed from us not only in sinfulness but also conception without semen, making &quot;synhyparxis&quot; another of Christ&#x27;s supernatural feats.) They felt comfortable holding this view, under their belief that the human nature of Jesus was separate from the divine hypostasis. Some Nestorians still wondered, however, if the body united with the soul in the moment the soul was created or whether it came with it only later. The Syriac author Babai argued for the former on the basis that the latter was hardly better than adoptionism. Maximus the Confessor ridiculed the Aristotelian notion of the development of the soul on the basis that it would make humans parents of both plants and animals. He held to &quot;synhyparxis&quot; and regarded the other two positions both as incorrect extremes. After the 7th century, Chalcedonian discussion on embryology is slight and the few works that touch on the topic support &quot;synhyparxis&quot;. But debate among other groups remains lively, still divided on similar sectarian grounds. The patriarch Timothy I argued that the Word first united with the body, and only later with the soul. He cited John 1:1, claiming on its basis that the Word became flesh first, not a human being first. Then, Jacob of Edessa rejected &quot;prohyparxis&quot; because Origen had defended it and &quot;methyparxis&quot; because he believed that it made the soul ontologically inferior and as only being made for the body. Then, Moses Bar Kepha claimed, for Christological reasons as a Monophysite, that only &quot;synhyparxis&quot; was acceptable. He claimed that Genesis 2:7 has no temporal sequence and that Exodus 21:22 regards the formation of the body and not the soul and so is not relevant. To argue against &quot;methyparxis&quot;, he reasoned that body and soul are both present at death and, because what is at the end must correspond to what is also at the beginning, conception must also have body and soul together.

===Embryology in Jewish tradition===

Many Jewish authors also discussed notions of embryology, especially as they appear in the Talmud. Much of the embryological data in the Talmud is part of discussions related to the impurity of the mother after childbirth. The embryo was described as the &quot;peri habbetten&quot; (fruit of the body) and it developed through various stages: (1) &quot;golem&quot; (formless and rolled-up) (2) &quot;shefir meruqqam&quot; (embroidered foetus) (3) &quot;ubbar&quot; (something carried) (4) &quot;walad&quot; (child) (5) &quot;walad shel qayama&quot; (viable child) (6) &quot;ben she-kallu khadashaw&quot; (child whose months have been completed). 

Some mystical notions regarding embryology appear in the Sefer Yetzirah. The text in the Book of Job relating to the fetus forming by analogy to the curdling of milk into cheese was cited in the Babylonian Talmud and in even greater detail in the Midrash: &quot;When the womb of the woman is full of retained blood which then comes forth to the area of her menstruation, by the will of the Lord comes a drop of white-matter which falls into it: at once the embryo is created. [This can be] compared to milk being put in a vessel: if you add to it some lab-ferment [drug or herb], it coagulates and stands still; if not, the milk remains liquid.&quot; The Talmud sages held that there were two seeds that participated in the formation of the embryo, one from the male and one from the female, and that their relative proportions determine whether that develops into a male or a female. 

In the Tractate Nidda, the mother was said to provide a &quot;red-seed&quot; which allows for the development of skin, flesh, hair, and the black part of the eye (pupil), whereas the father provides the &quot;white-seed&quot; which forms the bones, nerves, brain, and the white part of the eye. And finally, God himself was thought to provide the spirit and soul, facial expressions, capacity for hearing and vision, movement, comprehension, and intelligence. Not all strands of Jewish tradition accepted that both the male and female contributed parts to the formation of the fetus. 

The 13th century medieval commentator Nachmanides, for example, rejected the female contribution. In Tractate Hullin in the Talmud, whether the organs of the child resemble more closely those of the mother or father is said to depend on which one contribute more matter to the embryo depending on the child. Rabbi Ishmael and other sages are said to have disagreed on one matter: they agreed that the male embryo developed on the 41st day, but disagreed on whether this was the case for the female embryo. Some believed that the female embryo was complete later, whereas others held that they were finished at the same time. The only ancient Jewish authors who associated abortion with homicide were Josephus and Philo of Alexandria in the 1st century. In the Talmud, a child is granted humanness at birth, while other rabbinical texts place it at the 13th postnatal day. 

Some Talmudic texts discuss magical influences on the development of the embryo, such as one text which claims that if one sleeps on a bed that is pointed to the north–south will have a male child. According to Nachmanides, a child born of a cold drop of semen will be foolish, one born from a warm drop of semen will be passionate and irascible, and one born from a semen drop of medium temperature will be clever and level-headed. Some Talmudic discussions follow from Hippocratic claims that a child born on the eighth month could not survive, whereas others follow Aristotle in claiming that they sometimes could survive. One text even says that survival is possible on the seventh month, but not the eighth. Talmudic embryology, in various aspects, follows Greek discourses especially from Hippocrates and Aristotle, but in other areas, makes novel statements on the subject.

Judaism allows assisted reproduction, such as IVF embryo transfer and maternal surrogacy, when the spermatozoon and oocyte originate from the respective husband and wife. 

===Embryology in the Islamic tradition===

Passing reference to embryological notions also appear in the Qur&#x27;an (22:5), where the development of the embryo proceeds in four stages from drop, to a clinging clot, to a partially developed stage, to a fully developed child. The notion of clay turning into flesh is seen by some as analogous to a text by Theodoret that describes the same process. The four stages of development in the Qur&#x27;an are similar to the four stages of embryological development as described by Galen. In the early 6th century, Sergius of Reshaina devoted himself to the translation of Greek medical texts into Syriac and became the most important figure in this process. Included in his translations were the relevant embryological texts of Galen. Anurshirvan founded a medical school in the southern Mesopotamian city of Gundeshapur, known as the Academy of Gondishapur, which also acted as a medium for the transmission, reception, and development of notions from Greek medicine. These factors helped the transmission of Greek notions on embryology, such as found in Galen, to enter into the Arabian milieu. Very similar embryonic descriptions also appear in the Syriac Jacob of Serugh&#x27;s letter to the Archdeacon Mar Julian.

Embryological discussions also appear in the Islamic legal tradition.

<text>Johnny Brennan (born December 1, 1961) is an American actor, voice actor, comedian, and writer, known as the creator of The Jerky Boys, which released a series of prank phone call CDs, between 1993 and 1999.

He appears as himself as a member of the Jerky Boys in an episode of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; in 1994.

In 1995, Johnny Brennan wrote and starred with Kamal Ahmed in a motion picture portraying the antics of Johnny&#x27;s Jerky Boys characters called &quot;The Jerky Boys: The Movie&quot; (the film was shot between April and June 1994). In 1997, Johnny appeared in the Mariah Carey music video &quot;Honey&quot;.

Brennan later became known for his voice work in the Emmy-nominated animated series &quot;Family Guy&quot;, where he performs the voices of Mort Goldman and Horace the bartender of the Drunken Clam.

In 2007, Brennan released &quot;Sol&#x27;s Rusty Trombone&quot; without Ahmed. It was the first Jerky Boys release since 2001. In April, Brennan reprised his role of Frank Rizzo on the animated web series &quot;Clock Suckers&quot; in the episode &quot;If You Can&#x27;t Beat &#x27;Em, Then You&#x27;re a Pussy&quot;.

<doc id="162721" wikidata="Q702625" url="?curid=162721" title="Marc Riboud">
<text>Marc Riboud (; 24 June 1923 – 30 August 2016) was a French photographer, best known for his extensive reports on the Far East: &quot;The Three Banners of China&quot;, &quot;Face of North Vietnam&quot;, &quot;Visions of China&quot;, and &quot;In China&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Riboud was born in Saint-Genis-Laval and went to the lycée in Lyon. He photographed his first picture in 1937, using his father&#x27;s Vest Pocket Kodak camera. As a young man during World War II, he was active in the French Resistance, from 1943 to 1945. After the war, he studied engineering at the École Centrale de Lyon from 1945 to 1948.

==Career==
Until 1951 Riboud worked as an engineer in Lyon factories, but took a week-long picture-taking vacation, inspiring him to become a photographer. He moved to Paris where he met Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa, and David Seymour, the founders of Magnum Photos. By 1953 he was a member of the organization. His ability to capture fleeting moments in life through powerful compositions was already apparent, and this skill was to serve him well for decades to come.

Over the next several decades, Riboud traveled around the world. In 1957, he was one of the first European photographers to go to China, and in 1968, 1972, and 1976, Riboud made several reportages on North Vietnam. Later he traveled all over the world, but mostly in Asia, Africa, the U.S. and Japan. Riboud has been witness to the atrocities of war (photographing from both the Vietnam and the American sides of the Vietnam War), and the apparent degradation of a culture repressed from within (China during the years of chairman Mao Zedong&#x27;s Cultural Revolution). In contrast, he has captured the graces of daily life, set in sun-drenched facets of the globe (Fès, Angkor, Acapulco, Niger, Bénarès, Shaanxi), and the lyricism of child&#x27;s play in everyday Paris. In 1979 Riboud left the Magnum agency.

Riboud&#x27;s photographs have appeared in numerous magazines, including &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Géo&quot;, &quot;National Geographic&quot;, &quot;Paris Match&quot;, and &quot;Stern&quot;. He twice won the Overseas Press Club Award, received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2009 Sony World Photography Awards and has had major retrospective exhibitions at the Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris and the International Center of Photography in New York.

Riboud was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society in 1998.

==Photography==
One of Riboud&#x27;s best known images is &quot;Eiffel Tower Painter&quot;, taken in Paris in 1953. It depicts a man painting the tower, posed like a dancer, perched between the metal armature of the tower. Below him, Paris emerges from the photographic haze. Lone figures appear frequently in Riboud&#x27;s images. In &quot;Ankara&quot;, a central figure is silhouetted against an industrial background, whereas in &quot;France&quot;, a man lies in a field. The vertical composition emphasizes the landscape, the trees, sky, water and blowing grass, all of which surround but do not overpower the human element.

An image taken by Riboud on 21 October 1967, entitled &quot;The Ultimate Confrontation: The Flower and the Bayonet,&quot; is among the most celebrated anti-war pictures. Shot in Washington, D.C. where thousands of anti-war activists had gathered in front of the Pentagon to protest against America&#x27;s involvement in Vietnam, the picture shows a young girl, Jan Rose Kasmir, with a flower in her hands and a kindly gaze in her eyes, standing in front of several rifle-wielding soldiers stationed to block the protesters. Riboud said of the photo, &quot;She was just talking, trying to catch the eye of the soldiers, maybe trying to have a dialogue with them. I had the feeling the soldiers were more afraid of her than she was of the bayonets.&quot;

In contrast to the images in his photo essay, &quot;A Journey to North Vietnam&quot; (1969), Riboud says in the accompanying interview:
&quot;My impression is that the country&#x27;s leaders will not allow the slightest relaxation of the population at large [...] it is almost as if [...] they are anxious to forestall the great unknown – peace.&quot; In the same &quot;Newsweek&quot; article, he expanded further in his observations on life in North Vietnam:

I was astonished, for example, at the decidedly gay atmosphere in Hanoi&#x27;s Reunification Park on a Sunday afternoon [...] I honestly did not have the impression they were discussing socialism or the &#x27;American aggressors&#x27; [...] I saw quite a few patriotic posters crudely &#x27;improved&#x27; with erotic graffiti and sketches.

There is a divide between what is photographed (or published) and what Riboud had to say by way of his interview. Commenting on this in 1970, the author Geoffrey Wolff wrote:

Riboud&#x27;s photographs illustrate the proposition. The French photographer has been to North Vietnam twice [...] and he is most friendly, on the evidence of his pictures, to the people and the institutions he found there. His photographs are of happy faces,[...] An Air Force ace illustrates how he shot the American &quot;air pirates&quot; from the sky [...] Who knows the truth about these places?

American, revolutionary political Rap Metal band, Rage Against the Machine used two of Riboud&#x27;s photographs for their second single &quot;Bullet in the Head&quot;. Both photographs carry strong political and social messages, but are very different. The front cover is a picture of American school children pledging allegiance to the &#x27;flag&#x27; (Stars and Stripes) in a classroom; the back cover picture, is of a young (probably Vietnamese) boy, who is pointing a pistol, while soldiers stand on parade in the background. It is unclear who or what the boy is aiming at and whether the gun is real or a toy.

==Marriage and family==
In 1961 Riboud married the American sculptor Barbara Chase, who was living in Paris. They had two children. She became well known for her novel, &quot;Sally Hemings&quot; (1979), which earned critical acclaim and became a bestseller. They divorced before 1981.

He later married Catherine Chaine, a journalist and author.

Riboud died in Paris on 30 August 2016, at the age of 93.

<text>Daniel Toroitich arap Moi ( ; 2 September 1924 – 4 February 2020) was a Kenyan politician who served as the second president of Kenya from 1978 to 2002. He is the country&#x27;s longest-serving president to date. Moi previously served as the third vice president of Kenya from 1967 to 1978 under President Jomo Kenyatta, becoming the president following the latter&#x27;s death.

Born into the Tugen sub-group of the Kalenjin people in the Kenyan Rift Valley, Moi studied as a boy at the Africa Inland Mission school before training as a teacher at the Tambach teachers training college, working in that profession until 1955. He then entered politics and was elected a member of the Legislative Council for Rift Valley. As independence approached, Moi joined the Kenyan delegation which travelled to London for the Lancaster House Conferences, where the country&#x27;s first post-independence constitution was drafted. In 1960, he founded the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU) as a rival party to Kenyatta&#x27;s Kenya African National Union (KANU). Following independence in 1963, Kenyatta who became Prime Minister and later President of the new nation, convinced Moi to merge the two parties. Kenyatta appointed Moi to his government in 1964 and then promoted him to vice-president in 1967. Despite opposition from a Kikuyu elite known as the Kiambu Mafia, Kenyatta retained Moi as his Vice President. Moi took over as president when Kenyatta died in 1978.

Initially popular both nationally and in Western countries, who saw his regime as countering against influences from the Eastern Bloc-aligned governments of Ethiopia and Tanzania, Moi&#x27;s popularity fell around 1990 as the economy stagnated after the end of the Cold War. Following the agitation and external pressure, he was forced to allow multiparty elections in 1991. He then led his party, KANU, to victory in the 1992 and 1997 elections, both of which have generally been regarded as neither free nor fair by independent observers. Constitutionally barred from seeking a third term, Moi chose Uhuru Kenyatta as his successor, but Kenyatta was defeated by opposition leader Mwai Kibaki in the 2002 general election, and Kibaki succeeded Moi as president. Kenyatta would eventually win the presidency in the 2013 election.

Moi&#x27;s regime was deemed dictatorial especially before 1992 when Kenya was a one-party state. Human rights organisations such as Amnesty International, as well as a special investigation by the United Nations, accused Moi of human rights abuses during his presidency. Inquiries held after the end of his presidency found evidence that Moi and his sons had engaged in significant levels of corruption, including the 1990s Goldenberg scandal.

==Early life and entry into politics==
Moi was born Toroitich arap (son of) Moi, Toroitich meaning &quot;welcome home the cattle&quot;, in the Rift Valley village of Kuriengwo, which is now in Sacho division of Baringo County. Moi&#x27;s father, Kimoi arap Chebii, died in 1928. Moi was only four then and little is known about his mother, Kabon. What is known is that Tuitoek, his elder brother, became his guardian. Moi was one of the herdsboys from Sacho location recommended to join the new Africa Inland Mission (AIM) School at Kabartonjo in 1934 before it was shifted to Kapsabet. He was from the Tugen sub-group of the Kalenjin people.

At the African Mission School at Kabartonjo, Moi became a Christian and adopted the name Daniel. Moi attended Tambach Teachers Training College after its relocation from Kabartonjo from 1945 to 1947. This is after the colonial government denied him a chance to enroll at Alliance High School. He later attended Kagumo Teacher&#x27;s College, and taught classes at Tambach Teacher&#x27;s Training College. Later he became the headmaster of a school in the Keiyo District. He worked as a teacher from 1946 until 1955.

Moi entered politics in 1955 when he was elected Member of the Legislative Council for Rift Valley. He was the chosen replacement of Dr. John ole Tameno, the former representative who had had to quit due to heavy drinking and suspected connections to the freedom movement. In 1957 Moi was re-elected Member of the Legislative Council for Rift Valley. Moi was part of the Kenyan delegation at the Lancaster House Conferences in London, which drafted the country&#x27;s first post-independence constitution, and in 1961, he became Minister of Education in the pre-independence government.

In 1960 he founded the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU) with Ronald Ngala as a political alternative to the Kenya African National Union (KANU) led by Jomo Kenyatta. KADU pressed for a federalist constitution, while KANU was in favour of a centralized government. The advantage lay with the numerically stronger KANU, and the first post-independence constitution emphasised national unity, structuring the country as a unitary state.

==Vice-Presidency==

After Kenya gained independence on 12 December 1963, Kenyatta convinced Moi that KADU and KANU should merge to complete the process of decolonisation. Accordingly, KADU dissolved and joined KANU in 1964. The only real challenge to KANU&#x27;s dominance came from the Kenya People&#x27;s Union, starting in 1966. That party was banned in 1969, and from that point onward Kenya was a de facto one-party state dominated by the Kĩkũyũ-Luo alliance. However, with an eye on the fertile lands of the Rift Valley populated by members of Moi&#x27;s Kalenjin tribe, Kenyatta secured their support by first promoting Moi to Minister for Home Affairs in 1964, and then to Vice-President in 1967. As a member of a minority tribe Moi was also an acceptable compromise for the major tribes. Moi was elected to the Kenyan parliament in 1963 from Baringo North. From 1966 until his retirement in 2002, he served as the MP for Baringo Central in addition to his various other offices.

However, Moi faced opposition from the Kikuyu elite known as the Kiambu Mafia, who would have preferred one of their own to accede to the presidency. This resulted in an attempt by the constitutional drafting group to change the constitution to prevent the vice-president automatically assuming power in the event of the president&#x27;s death. However, many senior Kikuyu politicians, including Mwai Kibaki and Charles Njonjo, as well as Kenyatta himself, opposed such a change to the order of succession, fearing it might lead to political instability if Kenyatta died, given his advanced age and perennial illnesses. Thus, Moi&#x27;s position as successor to Kenyatta was safeguarded.

==Presidency==

When Jomo Kenyatta died on 22 August 1978, Moi became acting president. Per the Constitution, a special presidential election for the balance of Kenyatta&#x27;s term was to be held on 8 November, 90 days later. However, a Cabinet meeting decided that no one else was interested in running for presidency, thus various politicians began campaigning across the country for Moi to be declared the president unopposed. He was therefore sworn in as the second President of Kenya on 14 October 1978 as a result of the walkover electoral process.

In the beginning, Moi was popular with widespread support all over the country. He toured the country and came into contact with the people everywhere, which was in great contrast to Kenyatta&#x27;s imperious style of leadership from behind closed doors. However, political realities dictated that he would continue to be beholden to the system of government that Kenyatta had created and to whose headship he had acceded, including the nearly dictatorial powers vested in his office. Despite his popularity, Moi was still unable to fully consolidate his power. From the beginning, anti-communism was an important theme of Moi&#x27;s government; speaking on the new President&#x27;s behalf, Vice-President Mwai Kibaki bluntly stated, &quot;There is no room for Communists in Kenya.&quot;

On 1 August 1982, lower-level Air Force personnel, led by Senior Private Grade-I Hezekiah Ochuka and backed by university students, attempted a coup d&#x27;état to oust Moi. The revolt was quickly suppressed by military and police forces commanded by Chief of General Staff Mahamoud Mohamed. There may have been two or even three independent groups attempting to seize power at the same time, for differing reasons, but the most serious was led by prominent Kikuyu politicians and members of the police and armed forces.

Moi took the opportunity to dismiss political opponents and consolidate his power. He reduced the influence of Kenyatta&#x27;s men in the cabinet through a long-running judicial enquiry that resulted in the identification of key Kenyatta men as traitors. Moi pardoned them but not before establishing their traitor status in the public view. The main conspirators in the coup, including Ochuka, were sentenced to death, marking the last judicial executions in Kenya. Moi appointed loyalists to key positions and changed the constitution to formally make KANU the only legally permitted party in the country. But this made little difference to the political situation, as all significant opposition parties had been outlawed since 1969. Kenya&#x27;s academics and other intelligentsia did not accept this and educational institutions across the country became sites of movements that sought to introduce democratic reforms. However, Kenyan secret police infiltrated these groups and many of their members were exiled. Marxism could no longer be taught at Kenyan universities. The remaining opposition at home went underground.

Starting in the late 1980s, Moi&#x27;s regime faced the end of the Cold War, as well as a national economic stagnation under rising oil prices and falling prices of agricultural commodities. Western governments also became more hostile to the KANU regime, a change of policy from the time of the Cold War, when Kenya had been viewed as an important regional stabilizer, preventing the spread of Soviet influence beyond Ethiopia, Somalia, and Tanzania. During that time, Kenya had received much foreign aid, and the country was accepted as a stable, if authoritarian, regime with Moi and the KANU firmly in charge. Western allies overlooked the increasing degree of political repression, including the use of torture at the infamous Nyayo House torture chambers. Some of the evidence of these torture cells was exposed in 2003 after opposition leader Mwai Kibaki became president.

With the fall of the Soviet Union and a lessening need to counter socialist influence in the region, Western policymakers changed their policy towards Moi, increasingly regarding him as a despotic ruler rather than an important regional stabilizer. Foreign aid was withheld pending compliance with economic and political reforms. One of the key conditions imposed on his regime, especially by the United States through fiery ambassador Smith Hempstone, was the restoration of a multi-party system. Despite his own lack of enthusiasm for the reintroduction of a multi-party system, Moi managed to win over his party who were against the reform. Moi announced his intention to repeal Section 2(A) of the constitution, lifting the ban on opposition parties, at a KANU conference in Kasarani in December 1991. Despite fierce debate and opposition from many delegates, the conference passed the motion unanimously.

Regardless of the presence of opposition parties, Moi and the KANU clinched power in the first multi-party elections in 1992, and once again in 1997. Both elections were marred by political violence on both the government and opposition forces. Moi skillfully exploited Kenya&#x27;s mix of ethnic tensions in these contests, gaining a plurality in both elections through a mix of picking votes across the country while his opponents&#x27; support was more concentrated, attracting votes from smaller tribes, and the Luhya, and taking advantage of fears of Kikuyu domination over the non-Kikuyu majority. In the absence of an effective and organised opposition, Moi had no difficulty in winning. Although it is also suspected that electoral fraud may have occurred, the key to his victory in both elections was a divided opposition. In 1992 he polled 36.3% of the votes, and in 1997 he received 40.4%, but both were comfortable victories due to vote-splitting between the various opposition groups, which failed to unify and field one opposition candidate.

==Criticism and corruption allegations==
In 1999, the findings of NGOs like Amnesty International and a special investigation by the United Nations were published, and they indicated that human rights abuses were prevalent in Kenya under the Moi regime.

Reporting on corruption and human rights abuses by British reporter Mary Anne Fitzgerald from 1987 to 1988 resulted in her being vilified by the government and finally deported. Moi was implicated in the 1990s&#x27; Goldenberg scandal and subsequent cover-ups, where the Kenyan government subsidised exports of gold far in excess of the foreign currency earnings of exporters. In this case, the gold was smuggled from Congo, as Kenya has negligible gold reserves. The Goldenberg scandal cost Kenya the equivalent of more than 10% of the country&#x27;s annual GDP.

Inquiries that began at the request of foreign aid donors never amounted to anything substantial during Moi&#x27;s presidency. Although it appears that the peaceful transition of power to Mwai Kibaki may have involved an understanding that Moi would not stand trial for offences committed during his presidency, foreign aid donors reiterated their requests, and Kibaki reopened the inquiry. As the inquiry progressed, Moi, his two sons; Philip and Gideon (now a Senator), and his daughter, June, as well as a host of high-ranking Kenyans, were implicated. In a testimony delivered in late July 2003, Treasury Permanent Secretary Joseph Magari recounted that in 1991 Moi ordered him to pay Ksh34.5 million ($460,000) to Goldenberg, contrary to the laws then in force.

Wangari Maathai discussed Moi&#x27;s actions during the 1980s and early 1990s, systematically attempting to dismantle the Greenbelt Movement after Maathai voiced displeasure at the government&#x27;s attempts to build an office tower in Uhuru Park. According to Maathai, Moi&#x27;s actions included removing the Greenbelt Movement from government office space and attempting to cut off funding from international donors by limiting funding through government sanctioned bodies. Maathai also discussed Moi&#x27;s tactics during the beginning of the multiparty movement in the 1990s (see Forum for the Restoration of Democracy) whereby Moi announced the military would take over the government before the December 1992 elections. Maathai received communication during that time that an assassination list had been drawn up, and noted the mysterious deaths of Bishop Alexander Muge and Robert Ouko. The Release Political Prisoners party was also formed in the early 1990s to secure the release of political prisoners of the Moi regime and to protest state-sanctioned torture and random imprisonment. The police dispersed the protestors and many of the mothers of these political prisoners from Freedom Corner in Uhuru Park on March 3, 1992. After a year-long vigil and hunger strike by many of the mothers of these political prisoners in the Anglican All Saints Cathedral near Uhuru Park, the government released 51 prisoners en masse in early 1993.

In October 2006, Moi was found by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes to have taken a bribe from a Pakistani businessman, to award a monopoly of duty-free shops at the country&#x27;s international airports in Mombasa and Nairobi. The businessman, Ali Nasir, claimed to have paid Moi US$2 million in cash to obtain government approval for the World Duty Free Limited investment in Kenya.

On 31 August 2007, WikiLeaks published a secret report that laid bare a web of shell companies, secret trusts and front men that his entourage had used to channel hundreds of millions of pounds into nearly 30 countries.

==Retirement==

Moi was constitutionally barred from running in the 2002 presidential elections. Some of his supporters flirted with the idea of amending the constitution to allow him to run for a third term, but Moi preferred to retire, choosing Uhuru Kenyatta, the son of Kenya&#x27;s first President, as his successor. However, Mwai Kibaki was elected president by a two to one majority over Kenyatta, which was confirmed on 29 December 2002. At that point Kibaki required the use of a wheelchair, having narrowly escaped death in a road accident on the campaign trail. Moi handed over power in a poorly organised ceremony that had one of the largest crowds ever seen in Nairobi in attendance. The crowd was openly hostile to Moi.

After leaving office in December 2002, Moi lived in retirement, largely shunned by the political establishment. Nevertheless, he still retained some popularity with the masses, and his presence never failed to gather a crowd. He spoke out against a proposal for a new constitution in 2005, which according to him, the document was contrary to the aspirations of the Kenyan people. After the proposal was defeated in a November 2005 constitutional referendum, President Kibaki called Moi to arrange for a meeting to discuss the way forward.

On 25 July 2007, Kibaki appointed Moi as special peace envoy to Sudan, referring to Moi&#x27;s &quot;vast experience and knowledge of African affairs&quot; and &quot;his stature as an elder statesman&quot;. In his capacity as peace envoy, Moi&#x27;s primary task was to help secure peace in southern Sudan where an agreement, signed in early 2005, was being implemented. At the time, the Kenyan press speculated that Moi and Kibaki were planning an alliance ahead of the December 2007 election. On 28 August 2007, Moi announced his support for Kibaki&#x27;s re-election and said that he would campaign for Kibaki. He sharply criticised the two opposition Orange Democratic Movement factions, arguing that they were tribal in nature.

Moi owned the Kiptagich Tea Factory, established in 1979, which has been involved in controversy. In 2009, the factory was under the threat of being closed down by the government during the Mau Forest evictions.

==Personal life==
Moi was married to (née Helena Bomett) from 1950 until their separation in 1974, before his assumption of the presidency. Lena&#x27;s parents, the Paul Bomett family, were pioneer Christians in Eldama Ravine. They respected Moi, the young, tall, handsome and well-mannered orphan boy.

It was at the Bometts that Moi sought shelter during school holidays, unable to return home, 160 kilometres away, like the older boys. He would also stay at the home of the Christian family of Isaiah Chesire, the father of Kanu&#x27;s nominated MP Zipporah Kittony, and former Eldoret North MP Reuben Chesire.

In 1950, after leaving Kagumo Teacher&#x27;s College, Moi, who had been dating Lena, married her in a church wedding officiated by Erik Barnett, the son of Albert Barnett (after whom Kabarnet Town is named) at the AIC mission in Eldama Ravine after he paid two heifers, one ox, and four sheep to the Bomett family. Moi&#x27;s long-time friend, Francis Cherogony, was the best man. With the marriage, Lena abandoned her career as a teacher and immersed herself in bringing up her family, settling down with Moi at Tambach Government School, where his first two children, Jennifer and Jonathan Kipkemboi, were born in 1952 and 1953 respectively.

Daniel arap Moi had eight children: five sons and three daughters. Among the children are Gideon Moi, who had a political career of his own in Kenya and Jonathan Toroitich (a former rally driver, died 2019) and Philip Moi (a retired army officer). His older and only brother William Tuitoek died in 1995. He was a lifelong member of the Africa Inland Mission Church, following his enrollment at the church&#x27;s school with fellow acquaintance Sammy C. and Philip M. in 1934.

Moi was the founder and patron of major schools in Kenya which include Moi Educational Centre, Kabarak High School, Kabarak University and Sunshine Secondary Schools, and Sacho Primary and Secondary, among others.

==Death==
In October 2019, retired president Moi was hospitalized under critical condition at The Nairobi Hospital due to complications of pleural effusion. He was discharged in November 2019, only to be hospitalized again days later for knee surgery. He developed respiratory complications and underwent a tracheotomy. A month later, he suffered from gastrointestinal hemorrhage which led to multiple organ failure, and was placed on life-support.

Moi died at The Nairobi Hospital in the early morning of 4 February 2020, at the age of 95; however, during Moi&#x27;s memorial service on 9 February 2020 at his Kabarnet Gardens home in Nairobi, his son Raymond, told congregants that he was 105 years old at the time of his death. Moi&#x27;s body was lain at parliament building for public view for three days, from 8 February to 10 February 2020. A state funeral service was conducted at Nyayo Stadium on 11 February 2020, before the burial in his Kabarak home in Nakuru county. He was buried at his Kabarak home on 12 February 2020, complete with military honors which included a 19-gun salute followed by a missing man formation flyby. His grave is next to his former wife Lena Bomett.

<text>A détournement (), meaning &quot;rerouting, hijacking&quot; in French, is a technique developed in the 1950s by the Letterist International, and later adapted by the Situationist International (SI), that was defined in the SI&#x27;s inaugural 1958 journal as &quot;[t]he integration of present or past artistic productions into a superior construction of a milieu. In this sense there can be no situationist painting or music, but only a situationist use of those means. In a more elementary sense, &quot;détournement&quot; within the old cultural spheres is a method of propaganda, a method which reveals the wearing out and loss of importance of those spheres.&quot; 

The brand marketing specialist Douglas B. Holt defined it as &quot;turning expressions of the capitalist system and its media culture against itself&quot;. 

Détournement was prominently used to set up subversive political pranks, an influential tactic called situationist prank that was reprised by the punk movement in the late 1970s and inspired the culture jamming movement in the late 1980s.

Its opposite is recuperation, in which radical ideas or the social image of people who are viewed negatively are twisted, commodified, and absorbed in a more socially acceptable context.

== Definition ==
In general it can be defined as a variation on previous work, in which the newly created work has a meaning that is antagonistic or antithetical to the original. The original media work that is &quot;détourned&quot; must be somewhat familiar to the target audience, so that it can appreciate the opposition of the new message. The artist or commentator making the variation can reuse only some of the characteristic elements of the originating work.

Détournement is similar to satirical parody, but employs more direct reuse or faithful mimicry of the original works rather than constructing a new work which merely alludes strongly to the original. It may be contrasted with recuperation, in which originally subversive works and ideas are themselves appropriated by mainstream media. Détournement, on the other hand, makes it possible for the images produced by the spectacle get altered and subverted so that rather than supporting the &quot;status quo&quot;, their meaning becomes changed in order to put across a more radical or oppositional message.

Guy Debord and Gil J. Wolman categorized détourned elements into two types: &quot;minor détournements&quot; and &quot;deceptive détournements&quot;. Minor détournements are détournements of elements that in themselves are of no real importance such as a snapshot, a press clipping, an everyday object which draw all their meaning from being placed in a new context. Deceptive détournements are when already significant elements such as a major political or philosophical text, great artwork or work of literature take on new meanings or scope by being placed in a new context. For Debord, a détournement is a way to expose explicitly the inner workings of the objective reality of the Spectacle, thus creating a window for criticism.

== Examples after the Situationist International ==
In the United States, Frank Discussion is widely known for his use of détournement in his works dating from the late 1970s through the present, particularly with the Feederz. The use of détournement by Barbara Kruger familiarised many with the technique, and it was extensively and effectively used as part of the early HIV/AIDS activism of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Examples of contemporary detournement include Adbusters&#x27; &quot;subvertisements&quot; and other instances of culture jamming, as well as poems composed collaboratively by Marlene Mountain, Paul Conneally, and others, in which quotations from such famous sources as the Ten Commandments and quotations by United States President George W. Bush are combined with haiku-like phrases to produce a larger work intended to subvert the original source. The comic artist Brad Neely&#x27;s reinterpretation of Harry Potter, &quot;Wizard People,&quot; took Warner Bros.&#x27; first Harry Potter film, &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone,&quot; and substituted the original soundtrack with a narration that casts the hero as a Nietzschean superman.

The concept of detournement has had a popular influence amongst contemporary radicals, and the technique can be seen in action in the present day when looking at the work of Culture Jammers including the Cacophony Society, Billboard Liberation Front, monochrom, Occupy Movements and Adbusters, whose &quot;subvertisements&quot; &quot;detourn&quot; Nike adverts, for example. In this case, the original advertisement&#x27;s imagery is altered in order to draw attention to said company&#x27;s policy of shifting their production base to cheap-labour third-world &quot;free trade zones&quot;. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s health campaigners operating under the name of BUGA-UP (Billboard Utilising Graffitists Against Unhealthy Promotions) revised hundreds of tobacco and alcohol industry billboards around Australia to include satirical and condemnatory messages. However, the line between &quot;recuperation&quot; and &quot;détournement&quot; can become thin (or at least very fuzzy) at times, as Naomi Klein points out in her book &quot;No Logo&quot;. Here she details how corporations such as Nike, Pepsi or Diesel have approached Culture Jammers and Adbusters and offered them lucrative contracts in return for partaking in &quot;ironic&quot; promotional campaigns. She points out further irony by drawing attention to merchandising produced in order to promote Adbusters&#x27; Buy Nothing Day, an example of the recuperation of détournement if ever there was one.

Klein&#x27;s arguments about irony rather than breaking down power structures are echoed by Slavoj Žižek. Žižek argues that the kind of distance opened up by détournement is the condition of possibility for ideology to operate: by attacking and distancing oneself from the sign-systems of capital, the subject creates a fantasy of transgression that &quot;covers up&quot; their actual complicity with capitalism as an overarching system. In contrast, scholars are very fond of pointing out the differences between hypergraphics, &quot;detournement&quot;, the postmodern idea of appropriation and the Neoist use of plagiarism as the use of different and similar techniques used for different and similar means, effects and causes.

The Neue Slowenische Kunst has a long history of aggressive détournement of extreme political ideologies, as do several industrial music groups, such as Die Krupps, Nitzer Ebb, KMFDM, and Front 242.

Chris Morris uses détournement and culture jamming extensively in his work, particularly in the British television series &quot;The Day Today&quot; and &quot;Brass Eye&quot;.

== Détournement in advertising ==
In advertising, a détournement (&quot;détournement publicitaire&quot; in French) is almost like subvertising, except that the goal of a détournement is to promote a product by mocking the way another one is promoted. In October 2023, Netflix used the advertising visual style of luxury jewelry brands but with models that were obviously missing those jewels, a trick to promote the series Lupin. In 2012, Sixt made a détournement of François Hollande&#x27;s presidential campaign for a billboard ad.

Naomi Klein describes this as a récuperation of détournement. In Debord&#x27;s words, in the case of advertising, the détournement reverses the Spectacle, and in doing so becomes the Spectacle. Examples include Sprite&#x27;s &quot;Image is nothing&quot;, Nike&#x27;s 1997 campaign slogan &quot;&#x27;I am not/A target market/I am an athlete&quot;&#x27;, and Colin Kaepernick&#x27;s &quot;Taking the knee&quot; Nike campaign.

<text>Diane Arbus (; ; March 14, 1923 – July 26, 1971) was an American photographer. She photographed a wide range of subjects including strippers, carnival performers, nudists, people with dwarfism, children, mothers, couples, elderly people, and middle-class families. She photographed her subjects in familiar settings: their homes, on the street, in the workplace, in the park. &quot;She is noted for expanding notions of acceptable subject matter and violates canons of the appropriate distance between photographer and subject. By befriending, not objectifying her subjects, she was able to capture in her work a rare psychological intensity.&quot; In his 2003 &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; article, &quot;Arbus Reconsidered&quot;, Arthur Lubow states, &quot;She was fascinated by people who were visibly creating their own identities—cross-dressers, nudists, sideshow performers, tattooed men, the nouveaux riches, the movie-star fans—and by those who were trapped in a uniform that no longer provided any security or comfort.&quot; Michael Kimmelman writes in his review of the exhibition &quot;Diane Arbus Revelations&quot;, that her work &quot;transformed the art of photography (Arbus is everywhere, for better and worse, in the work of artists today who make photographs)&quot;. Arbus&#x27;s imagery helped to normalize marginalized groups and highlight the importance of proper representation of all people.

In her lifetime she achieved some recognition and renown with the publication, beginning in 1960, of photographs in such magazines as &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, London&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Times Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Artforum&quot;. In 1963 the Guggenheim Foundation awarded Arbus a fellowship for her proposal entitled, &quot;American Rites, Manners and Customs&quot;. She was awarded a renewal of her fellowship in 1966. John Szarkowski, the director of photography at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City from 1962 to 1991, championed her work and included it in his 1967 exhibit &quot;New Documents&quot; along with the work of Lee Friedlander and Garry Winogrand. Her photographs were also included in a number of other major group shows.

In 1972, a year after her suicide, Arbus became the first photographer to be included in the Venice Biennale where her photographs were &quot;the overwhelming sensation of the American Pavilion&quot; and &quot;extremely powerful and very strange&quot;.

The first major retrospective of Arbus&#x27; work was held in 1972 at MoMA, organized by Szarkowski. The retrospective garnered the highest attendance of any exhibition in MoMA&#x27;s history to date. Millions viewed traveling exhibitions of her work from 1972 to 1979. The book accompanying the exhibition, &quot;Diane Arbus: An Aperture Monograph&quot;, edited by Doon Arbus and Marvin Israel and first published in 1972, has never been out of print.

==Personal life==
Arbus was born Diane Nemerov to David Nemerov and Gertrude Russek Nemerov, Jewish immigrants from Soviet Russia and Poland, who lived in New York City and owned Russeks, a Fifth Avenue women&#x27;s wear department store, co-founded by Arbus&#x27; grandfather Frank Russek, a Polish-Jewish immigrant to the United States, of which David rose to become chairman. Because of her family&#x27;s wealth, Arbus was insulated from the effects of the Great Depression while growing up in the 1930s. Her father became a painter after retiring from Russeks. Her younger sister became a sculptor and designer, and her older brother, the poet Howard Nemerov, taught English at Washington University in St. Louis and was appointed United States Poet Laureate. Howard&#x27;s son is the Americanist art historian Alexander Nemerov.

Arbus&#x27;s parents were not deeply involved in raising their children, who were overseen by maids and governesses. Her mother had a busy social life and underwent a period of clinical depression for approximately a year, then recovered, and her father was busy with work. Diane separated herself from her family and her lavish childhood.

Arbus attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, a college-preparatory school. In 1941, at the age of 18, she married her childhood sweetheart, Allan Arbus, whom she had dated since age 14. Their daughter Doon, who would become a writer, was born in 1945; their daughter Amy, who would become a photographer, was born in 1954. Arbus and her husband worked together in commercial photography from 1946 to 1956, but Allan remained very supportive of her work even after she left the business and began an independent relationship to photography.

Arbus and her husband separated in 1959, although they maintained a close friendship. The couple also continued to share a darkroom, where Allan&#x27;s studio assistants processed her negatives, and she printed her work. The couple divorced in 1969 when he moved to California to pursue acting. He was popularly known for his role as Dr. Sidney Freedman on the television show &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. Before his move to California, Allan set up her darkroom, and they thereafter maintained a long correspondence.

In late 1959, Arbus began a relationship with the art director and painter Marvin Israel that would last until her death. All the while, he remained married to Margaret Ponce Israel, an accomplished mixed-media artist. Marvin Israel both spurred Arbus creatively and championed her work, encouraging her to create her first portfolio. Richard Avedon was among the photographers and artists Arbus befriended; he was approximately the same age, his family had also run a Fifth Avenue department store, and many of his photographs were also characterized by detailed frontal poses.

==Photographic career==
Arbus received her first camera, a Graflex, from Allan shortly after they married. Shortly thereafter, she enrolled in classes with photographer Berenice Abbott. The Arbuses&#x27; interests in photography led them, in 1941, to visit the gallery of Alfred Stieglitz, and learn about the photographers Mathew Brady, Timothy O&#x27;Sullivan, Paul Strand, Bill Brandt, and Eugène Atget. In the early 1940s, Diane&#x27;s father employed Diane and Allan to take photographs for the department store&#x27;s advertisements. Allan was a photographer for the U.S. Army Signal Corps in World War II.

In 1946, after the war, the Arbuses began a commercial photography business called &quot;Diane &amp; Allan Arbus&quot;, with Diane as art director and Allan as the photographer. She would come up with the concepts for their shoots and then take care of the models. She grew dissatisfied with this role, a role even her husband thought was &quot;demeaning&quot;. They contributed to &quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, and other magazines even though &quot;they both hated the fashion world&quot;. Despite over 200 pages of their fashion editorial in &quot;Glamour&quot;, and over 80 pages in &quot;Vogue&quot;, the Arbuses&#x27; fashion photography has been described as of &quot;middling quality&quot;. Edward Steichen&#x27;s noted 1955 photography exhibition, &quot;The Family of Man&quot;, did include a photograph by the Arbuses of a father and son reading a newspaper.

She studied briefly with Alexey Brodovich in 1954. However, it was her studies with Lisette Model, which began in 1956, that encouraged Arbus to focus exclusively on her own work. That year Arbus quit the commercial photography business and began numbering her negatives. (Her last known negative was labeled #7459.) Based on Model&#x27;s advice, Arbus spent time with an empty camera so she could practice observation. Arbus also credits Model with making it clear to her that &quot;the more specific you are, the more general it&#x27;ll be.&quot;

By 1956 she worked with a 35mm Nikon, wandering the streets of New York City and meeting her subjects largely, though not always, by chance. The idea of personal identity as socially constructed is one that Arbus came back to, whether it be performers, women and men wearing makeup, or a literal mask obstructing one&#x27;s face. Critics have speculated that the choices in her subjects reflected her own identity issues, for she said that the only thing she suffered from as a child was never having felt adversity. This evolved into a longing for things that money couldn&#x27;t buy such as experiences in the underground social world. She is often praised for her sympathy for these subjects, a quality which is not immediately understood through the images themselves, but through her writing and the testimonies of the men and women she portrayed. A few years later, in 1958 she began making lists of who and what she was interested in photographing. She began photographing on assignment for magazines such as &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, and &quot;The Sunday Times Magazine&quot; in 1959.

Around 1962, Arbus switched from a 35 mm Nikon camera which produced the grainy rectangular images characteristic of her post-studio work to a twin-lens reflex Rolleiflex camera which produced more detailed square images. She explained this transition saying &quot;In the beginning of photographing I used to make very grainy things. I&#x27;d be fascinated by what the grain did because it would make a kind of tapestry of all these little dots ... But when I&#x27;d been working for a while with all these dots, I suddenly wanted terribly to get through there. I wanted to see the real differences between things ... I began to get terribly hyped on clarity.&quot; In 1964, Arbus began using a 2-1/4 Mamiyaflex camera with flash in addition to the Rolleiflex.

Arbus&#x27;s style is described as &quot;direct and unadorned, a frontal portrait centered in a square format. Her pioneering use of flash in daylight isolated the subjects from the background, which contributed to the photos&#x27; surreal quality.&quot; Her methods included establishing a strong personal relationship with her subjects and re-photographing some of them over many years.

In spite of being widely published and achieving some artistic recognition, Arbus struggled to support herself through her work. &quot;During her lifetime, there was no market for collecting photographs as works of art, and her prints usually sold for $100 or less.&quot; It is evident from her correspondence that lack of money was a persistent concern.

In 1963, Arbus was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for a project on &quot;American rites, manners, and customs&quot;; the fellowship was renewed in 1966.

Throughout the 1960s, Arbus supported herself largely by taking magazine assignments and commissions. For example, in 1968 she shot documentary photographs of poor sharecroppers in rural South Carolina (for &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine). In 1969 a rich and prominent actor and theater owner, Konrad Matthaei, and his wife, Gay, commissioned Arbus to photograph a family Christmas gathering. During her career, Arbus photographed Mae West, Ozzie Nelson and Harriet Nelson, Bennett Cerf, atheist Madalyn Murray O&#x27;Hair, Norman Mailer, Jayne Mansfield, Eugene McCarthy, billionaire H. L. Hunt, Gloria Vanderbilt&#x27;s baby Anderson Cooper, Coretta Scott King, and Marguerite Oswald (Lee Harvey Oswald&#x27;s mother). In general, her magazine assignments decreased as her fame as an artist increased. Szarkowski hired Arbus in 1970 to research an exhibition on photojournalism called &quot;From the Picture Press&quot;; it included many photographs by Weegee whose work Arbus admired. She also taught photography at the Parsons School of Design and the Cooper Union in New York City, and the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, Rhode Island.

Late in her career, the Metropolitan Museum of Art indicated to her that they would buy three of her photographs for $75 each, but citing a lack of funds, purchased only two. As she wrote to Allan Arbus, &quot;So I guess being poor is no disgrace.&quot;

Beginning in 1969 Arbus undertook a series of photographs of people at New Jersey residences for developmentally and intellectually disabled people, posthumously named &quot;Untitled&quot;. Arbus returned to several facilities repeatedly for Halloween parties, picnics, and dances. In a letter to Allan Arbus dated November 28, 1969, she described these photographs as &quot;lyric and tender and pretty&quot;.

&quot;Artforum&quot; published six photographs, including a cover image, from Arbus&#x27;s portfolio, &quot;A box of ten photographs&quot;, in May 1971. After his encounter with Arbus and the portfolio, Philip Leider, then editor in chief of &quot;Artforum&quot; and a photography skeptic, admitted, &quot;With Diane Arbus, one could find oneself interested in photography or not, but one could no longer . . . deny its status as art.&quot; She was the first photographer to be featured in &quot;Artforum&quot; and &quot;Leider&#x27;s admission of Arbus into this critical bastion of late modernism was instrumental in shifting the perception of photography and ushering its acceptance into the realm of &#x27;serious&#x27; art.&quot;

The first major exhibition of her photographs occurred at the Museum of Modern Art in the influential &quot;New Documents&quot; (1967) alongside the work of Garry Winogrand and Lee Friedlander, curated by John Szarkowski. New Documents, which drew almost 250,000 visitors demonstrated Arbus&#x27;s interest in what Szarkowski referred to as society&#x27;s &quot;frailties&quot; and presented what he described as &quot;a new generation of documentary photographers...whose aim has been not to reform life but to know it&quot;, described elsewhere as &quot;photography that emphasized the pathos and conflicts of modern life presented without editorializing or sentimentalizing but with a critical, observant eye&quot;. The show was polarizing, receiving both praise and criticism, with some identifying Arbus as a disinterested voyeur and others praising her for her evident empathy with her subjects.

In 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a belated obituary of Arbus as part of the Overlooked history project. The Smithsonian American Art Museum housed an exclusive exhibit from April 6, 2018, to January 27, 2019, that featured one of Arbus&#x27; portfolios, &quot;A box of ten photographs&quot;. The SAAM is the only museum currently displaying the work. The collection is &quot;one of just four complete editions that Arbus printed and annotated. The three other editions—the artist never executed her plan to make 50—are held privately&quot;. The Smithsonian edition was made for Bea Feitler, an art director who both employed and befriended Arbus. After Feitler&#x27;s death, Baltimore collector G. H. Dalsheimer bought her portfolio from Sotheby&#x27;s in 1982 for $42,900. The SAAM then bought it from Dalsheimer in 1986. The portfolio was put away in the museum&#x27;s collection, until 2018.

==Death==
Arbus experienced &quot;depressive episodes&quot; during her life, similar to those experienced by her mother; the episodes may have been made worse by symptoms of hepatitis. In 1968, Arbus wrote a letter to a friend, Carlotta Marshall, that says: &quot;I go up and down a lot. Maybe I&#x27;ve always been like that. Partly what happens though is I get filled with energy and joy and I begin lots of things or think about what I want to do and get all breathless with excitement and then quite suddenly either through tiredness or a disappointment or something more mysterious the energy vanishes, leaving me harassed, swamped, distraught, frightened by the very things I thought I was so eager for! I&#x27;m sure this is quite classic.&quot; Her ex-husband once noted that she had &quot;violent changes of mood&quot;.

On July 26, 1971, while living at Westbeth Artists Community in New York City, Arbus died by suicide by ingesting barbiturates and cutting her wrists with a razor. She wrote the words &quot;Last Supper&quot; in her diary and placed her appointment book on the stairs leading up to the bathroom. Marvin Israel found her body in the bathtub two days later; she was 48 years old. Photographer Joel Meyerowitz told journalist Arthur Lubow, &quot;If she was doing the kind of work she was doing and photography wasn&#x27;t enough to keep her alive, what hope did we have?&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;[Arbus&#x27;s] work has had such an influence on other photographers that it is already hard to remember how original it was&quot;, wrote the art critic Robert Hughes in a November 1972 issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. She has been called &quot;a seminal figure in modern-day photography and an influence on three generations of photographers&quot; and is widely considered to be among the most influential artists of the last century.

When the film &quot;The Shining&quot;, directed by Stanley Kubrick, was released to cinemas worldwide in 1980 and became hugely successful, millions of moviegoers experienced Diane Arbus&#x27; legacy without realizing it. The movie&#x27;s recurring characters of identical twin girls who are wearing identical dresses appear on-screen as a result of a suggestion Kubrick received from crew member Leon Vitali. He is described by film historian Nick Chen as &quot;Kubrick&#x27;s right-hand man from the mid-70s onwards&quot;. Chen goes on to reveal, &quot;Not only did Vitali videotape and interview 5,000 kids to find [the right child actor to portray] Jack Nicholson&#x27;s [character&#x27;s] son, Danny, he was also responsible for discovering the creepy twin sisters on the final day of auditions. The pair, in fact, weren&#x27;t twins in Kubrick&#x27;s script, and it was Vitali who immediately suggested Diane Arbus&#x27; infamous photo of identical twin sisters as a point of reference.&quot;

Since Arbus died without a will, the responsibility for overseeing her work fell to her daughter, Doon. She forbade examination of Arbus&#x27; correspondence and often denied permission for exhibition or reproduction of Arbus&#x27; photographs without prior vetting, to the ire of many critics and scholars. The editors of an academic journal published a two-page complaint in 1993 about the estate&#x27;s control over Arbus&#x27; images and its attempt to censor characterizations of subjects and the photographer&#x27;s motives in article about Arbus. A 2005 article called the estate&#x27;s allowing the British press to reproduce only fifteen photographs an attempt to &quot;control criticism and debate&quot;. On the other hand, it is common institutional practice in the U.S. to include only a handful of images for media use in an exhibition press kit. The estate was also criticized in 2008 for minimizing Arbus&#x27; early commercial work, although those photographs were taken by Allan Arbus and credited to the Diane and Allan Arbus Studio.

In 2011, a review in &quot;The Guardian&quot; of &quot;An Emergency in Slow Motion: The Inner Life of Diane Arbus&quot; by William Todd Schultz references &quot;...the famously controlling Arbus estate who, as Schultz put it recently, &#x27;seem to have this idea, which I disagree with, that any attempt to interpret the art diminishes the art.

In 1972, Arbus was the first photographer to be included in the Venice Biennale; her photographs were described as &quot;the overwhelming sensation of the American Pavilion&quot; and &quot;an extraordinary achievement&quot;.

The Museum of Modern Art held a retrospective curated by John Szarkowski of Arbus&#x27;s work in late 1972 that subsequently traveled around the United States and Canada through 1975; it was estimated that over seven million people saw the exhibition. A different retrospective curated by Marvin Israel and Doon Arbus traveled around the world between 1973 and 1979.

Doon Arbus and Marvin Israel edited and designed a 1972 book, &quot;Diane Arbus: An Aperture Monograph&quot;, published by Aperture and accompanying the Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s exhibition. It contained eighty of Arbus&#x27; photographs, as well as texts from classes that she gave in 1971, some of her writings, and interviews,

In 2001–04, &quot;Diane Arbus: An Aperture Monograph&quot; was selected as one of the most important photobooks in history.

Neil Selkirk, a former student, began printing for the 1972 MOMA retrospective and Aperture Monograph. He remains the only person who is authorized to make posthumous prints of Arbus&#x27; work.

A half-hour documentary film about Arbus&#x27; life and work known as &quot;Masters of Photography: Diane Arbus&quot; or &quot;Going Where I&#x27;ve Never Been: The Photography of Diane Arbus&quot; was produced in 1972 and released on video in 1989. The voiceover was drawn from recordings made of Arbus&#x27; photography class by Ikkō Narahara and voiced by Mariclare Costello, who was Arbus&#x27; friend and the wife of her ex-husband Allan.

Patricia Bosworth wrote an unauthorized biography of Arbus published in 1984. Bosworth reportedly &quot;received no help from Arbus&#x27;s daughters, or from their father, or from two of her closest and most prescient friends, Avedon and ... Marvin Israel&quot;. The book was also criticized for insufficiently considering Arbus&#x27;s own words, for speculating about missing information, and for focusing on &quot;sex, depression and famous people&quot;, instead of Arbus&#x27; art.

In 1986, Arbus was inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum.

Between 2003 and 2006, Arbus and her work were the subject of another major traveling exhibition, &quot;Diane Arbus Revelations&quot;, which was organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Accompanied by a book of the same name, the exhibition included artifacts such as correspondence, books, and cameras as well as 180 photographs by Arbus. By &quot;making substantial public excerpts from Arbus&#x27;s letters, diaries and notebooks&quot; the exhibition and book &quot;undertook to claim the center-ground on the basic facts relating to the artist&#x27;s life and death&quot;. Because Arbus&#x27;s estate approved the exhibition and book, the chronology in the book is &quot;effectively the first authorized biography of the photographer&quot;.

In 2006, the fictional film &quot;Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus&quot; was released, starring Nicole Kidman as Arbus; it used Patricia Bosworth&#x27;s unauthorized biography &quot;Diane Arbus: A Biography&quot; as a source of inspiration. Critics generally took issue with the film&#x27;s &quot;fairytale&quot; portrayal of Arbus.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art purchased twenty of Arbus&#x27; photographs (valued at millions of dollars) and received Arbus&#x27; archives, which included hundreds of early and unique photographs, and negatives and contact prints of 7,500 rolls of film, as a gift from her estate in 2007.

In 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a belated obituary of Arbus as part of the Overlooked history project.

==Critical reception==
* In a 1967 review of MoMA&#x27;s &quot;New Documents&quot; exhibition, which featured the work of Diane Arbus, Lee Friedlander, and Garry Winogrand, Max Kozloff wrote, &quot;What these photographers have in common is a complete loss of faith in the mass media as vehicle, or even market for their work. Newsiness, from the journalistic point of view, and &#x27;stories&#x27;, from the literary one, in any event, do not interest them...Arbus&#x27; refusal to be compassionate, her revulsion against moral judgment, lends her work an extraordinary ethical conviction.&quot;
* Writing for &quot;Arts Magazine&quot;, Marion Magid stated, &quot;Because of its emphasis on the hidden and the eccentric, this exhibit has, first of all, the perpetual, if criminal, allure of a sideshow. One begins by simply craving to look at the forbidden things one has been told all one&#x27;s life not to stare at... One does not look at such subjects with impunity, as anyone knows who has ever stared at the sleeping face of a familiar person, and discovered its strangeness. Once having looked and not looked away, we are implicated. When we have met the gaze of a midget or a female impersonator, a transaction takes place between the photograph and the viewer; in a kind of healing process, we are cured of our criminal urgency by having dared to look. The picture forgives us, as it were, for looking. In the end, the great humanity of Diane Arbus&#x27; art is to sanctify that privacy which she seems at first to have violated.&quot;
* Robert Hughes in a &quot;Time&quot; magazine review of the 1972 Diane Arbus retrospective at MoMA wrote, &quot;Arbus did what hardly seemed possible for a still photographer. She altered our experience of the face.&quot;
* In his review of the 1972 retrospective, Hilton Kramer stated that Arbus was &quot;one of those figures—as rare in the annals of photography as in the history of any other medium—who suddenly, by a daring leap into a territory formerly regarded as forbidden, altered the terms of the art she practiced...she completely wins us over, not only to her pictures but to her people, because she has clearly come to feel something like love for them herself. &quot;
* Susan Sontag wrote an essay in 1973 entitled &quot;Freak Show&quot; that was critical of Arbus&#x27; work; it was reprinted in her 1977 book &quot;On Photography&quot; as &quot;America, Seen Through Photographs, Darkly&quot;. Among other criticisms, Sontag opposed the lack of beauty in Arbus&#x27; work and its failure to make the viewer feel compassionate about Arbus&#x27;s subjects. Sontag&#x27;s essay itself has been criticized as &quot;an exercise in aesthetic insensibility&quot; and &quot;exemplary for its shallowness&quot;. Sontag has also stated that &quot;the subjects of Arbus&#x27;s photographs are all members of the same family, inhabitants of a single village. Only, as it happens, the idiot village is America. Instead of showing identity between things which are different (Whitman&#x27;s democratic vista), everybody is the same.&quot; A 2009 article noted that Arbus had photographed Sontag and her son in 1965, causing one to &quot;wonder if Sontag felt this was an unfair portrait&quot;. Philip Charrier argues in a 2012 article that despite its narrowness and widely discussed faults, Sontag&#x27;s critique continues to inform much of the scholarship and criticism of Arbus&#x27;s oeuvre. The article proposes overcoming this tradition by asking new questions, and by shifting the focus away from matters of biography, ethics, and Arbus&#x27;s suicide.
* In Susan Sontag&#x27;s essay &quot;Freak Show&quot;, she writes, &quot;The authority of Arbus&#x27;s photographs comes from the contrast between their lacerating subject matter and their calm, matteroffact attentiveness. This quality of attention—the attention paid by the photographer, the attention paid by the subject to the act of being photographed—creates the moral theater of Arbus&#x27;s straight on, contemplative portraits. Far from spying on freaks and pariahs, catching them unawares, the photographer has gotten to know them, reassured them—so that they pose for her as calmly and stiffly as any Victorian notable sat for a studio portrait by Nadar or Julia Margaret Cameron. A large part of the mystery of Arbus&#x27;s photographs lies in what they suggest about how her subjects felt after consenting to be photographed. Do they see themselves, the viewer wonders, like that? Do they know how grotesque they are? It seems as if they don&#x27;t.&quot;
* Judith Goldman in 1974 posited that, &quot;Arbus&#x27; camera reflected her own desperateness in the same way that the observer looks at the picture and then back at himself.&quot;
* David Pagel&#x27;s 1992 review of the &quot;Untitled&quot; series states, &quot;These rarely seen photographs are some of the most hauntingly compassionate images made with a camera...The range of expressions Arbus has captured is remarkable in its startling shifts from carefree glee to utter trepidation, ecstatic self-abandonment to shy withdrawal, and simple boredom to neighborly love. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of her photographs is the way they combine sentiments we all share with experiences we can imagine but never know.&quot;
* In reviewing &quot;Diane Arbus: Untitled&quot; for &quot;Artforum&quot;, Nan Goldin said, &quot;She was able to let things be, as they are, rather than seeking to transform them. The quality that defines her work, and separates it from almost all other photography, is her ability to empathize, on a level far beyond language. Arbus could travel, in the mythic sense. Perhaps out of the desire not to be herself, she tried on the skins of others and took us along for the trip. Arbus was obsessed with people who manifested trauma, maybe because her own crisis was so internalized. She was able to look full in the faces we normally avert our eyes from, and to show beauty there as well as pain. Her work is often difficult but it isn&#x27;t cruel. She undertook that greatest act of courage—to face the terror of darkness and remain articulate.&quot;
* Hilton Als reviewed &quot;Untitled&quot; in 1995 for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, saying, &quot;The extraordinary power of &quot;Untitled&quot; confirms our earliest impression of Arbus&#x27;s work; namely, that it is as iconographic as it gets in any medium.&quot;
* In her review of the traveling exhibition &quot;Diane Arbus Revelations&quot;, Francine Prose writes, &quot;Even as we grow more restive with conventional religion, with the intolerance and even brutality it so frequently exacts in trade for meaning and consolation, Arbus&#x27;s work can seem like the bible of a faith to which one can almost imagine subscribing—the temple of the individual and irreducible human soul, the church of obsessive fascination and compassion for those fellow mortals whom, on the basis of mere surface impressions, we thoughtlessly misidentify as the wretched of the earth.&quot;
* Barbara O&#x27;Brien in a 2004 review of the exhibition &quot;Diane Arbus: Family Albums&quot; found her and August Sander&#x27;s work &quot;filled with life and energy.&quot;
* Peter Schjeldahl, in a 2005 review of the exhibition &quot;Diane Arbus Revelations&quot; for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; stated, &quot;She turned picture-making inside out. She didn&#x27;t gaze at her subjects; she induced them to gaze at her. Selected for their powers of strangeness and confidence, they burst through the camera lens with a presence so intense that whatever attitude she or you or anyone might take toward them disintegrates...You may feel, crazily, that you have never really seen a photograph before. Nor is this impression of novelty evanescent. Over the years, Arbuses that I once found devastating have seemed to wait for me to change just a little, then to devastate me all over again. No other photographer has been more controversial. Her greatness, a fact of experience, remains imperfectly understood.&quot;
* Michael Kimmelman wrote in 2005, &quot;If the proper word isn&#x27;t spirituality then it&#x27;s grace. Arbus touches her favorite subjects with grace. It&#x27;s in the spread-arm pose of the sword swallower, in the tattooed human pincushion, like St. Sebastian, and in the virginal waitress at the nudist camp, with her apron and order pad and her nicked shin. And it&#x27;s famously in the naked couple in the woods, like Adam and Eve after the Fall.&quot;
* Ken Johnson, reviewing a show of Arbus&#x27;s lesser-known works in 2005, wrote, &quot;Arbus&#x27;s perfectly composed, usually centered images have a way of arousing an almost painfully urgent curiosity. Who is the boy in the suit and tie and fedora who looks up from the magazine in a neighborhood store and fixes us with a gaze of unfathomable seriousness? What is the story with the funny, birdlike lady with the odd, floppy knit hat perched on her head? What is the bulky dark man in the suit and hat saying to the thin, well-dressed older woman with the pinched, masklike face as he jabs the air with a finger while they walk in Central Park? Arbus was a wonderful formalist and just as wonderful a storyteller—the Flannery O&#x27;Connor of photography.
* Leo Rubinfien wrote in 2005, &quot;No photographer makes viewers feel more strongly that they are being directly addressed...When her work is at its most august, Arbus sees through her subject&#x27;s pretensions, her subject sees that she sees, and an intricate parley occurs around what the subject wants to show and wants to conceal...She loved conundrum, contradiction, riddle, and this, as much as the pain in her work, puts it near Kafka&#x27;s and Beckett&#x27;s...I doubt anyone in the modern arts, not Kafka, not Beckett, has strung such a long, delicate thread between laughter and tears.&quot;
* In Stephanie Zacharek&#x27;s 2006 review of the movie &quot;Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus&quot;, she writes, &quot;When I look at her pictures, I see not a gift for capturing whatever life is there, but a desire to confirm her suspicions about humanity&#x27;s dullness, stupidity, and ugliness.&quot;
* Wayne Koestenbaum asked in 2007 whether Arbus&#x27;s photographs humiliate the subjects or the viewers. In a 2013 interview for the &quot;Los Angeles Review of Books&quot; he also said, &quot;She&#x27;s finding little pockets of jubilation that are framed within each photograph. The obvious meaning of the photograph is abjection, but the obtuse meaning is jubilation, beauty, staunchness, pattern.&quot;
* Mark Feeney&#x27;s 2016 &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; review of &quot;in the beginning&quot; at the Met Breuer states, &quot;It&#x27;s not so much that Arbus changed how we see the world as how we allow ourselves to see it. Underbelly and id are no less part of society for being less visible. Outcasts and outsiders become their own norm – and with Arbus as ambassador, ours, too. She witnesses without ever judging.&quot;
* In a 2018 review for &quot;The New York Times&quot; on Diane Arbus&#x27;s &quot;Untitled&quot; series, Arthur Lubow writes, &quot;The &#x27;Untitled&#x27; photographs evoke paintings by Ensor, Bruegel and especially the covens and rituals conjured up by Goya...In the almost half century that has elapsed since Arbus made the &#x27;Untitled&#x27; pictures, photographers have increasingly adopted a practice of constructing the scenes they shoot and altering the pictures with digital technology in an effort to bring to light the visions in their heads. The &#x27;Untitled&#x27; series, one of the towering achievements of American art, reminds us that nothing can surpass the strange beauty of reality if a photographer knows where to look. And how to look.&quot;
* Adam Lehrer wrote, in his &quot;Forbes&quot; review of &quot;Untitled&quot;, Arbus calls attention to vibrant expressions of joy while never letting us forget life&#x27;s eternal anguish. Some critics have suggested that Arbus sees herself in her subjects. But perhaps that&#x27;s only partially true. It&#x27;s probably a more factual assertion to claim that Arbus sees all of us in her subjects...Arbus&#x27;s only delusion was believing, or hoping, that others would share her peculiar fixations. But to say that her work is merely about human imperfection is both accurate and laughably dismissive. Arbus surely was focused on human imperfection, but within imperfection, she found unvarnished, perfect humanity. And humanity, to Arbus, was beautiful.&quot;

Some of Arbus&#x27;s subjects and their relatives have commented on their experience being photographed by Diane Arbus:
* The father of the twins pictured in &quot;Identical Twins, Roselle, N.J. 1967&quot; said, &quot;We thought it was the worst likeness of the twins we&#x27;d ever seen. I mean it resembles them, but we&#x27;ve always been baffled that she made them look ghostly. None of the other pictures we have of them looks anything like this.&quot;
* Writer Germaine Greer, who was the subject of an Arbus photograph in 1971, criticized it as an &quot;undeniably bad picture&quot; and Arbus&#x27;s work in general as unoriginal and focusing on &quot;mere human imperfection and self-delusion.&quot;
* Norman Mailer said, in 1971, &quot;Giving a camera to Diane Arbus is like putting a live grenade in the hands of a child.&quot; Mailer was reportedly displeased with the well-known &quot;spread-legged&quot; &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; photo. Arbus photographed him in 1963.
* Colin Wood, the subject of &quot;Child With a Toy Grenade in Central Park&quot;, said, &quot;She saw in me the frustration, the anger at my surroundings, the kid wanting to explode but can&#x27;t because he&#x27;s constrained by his background.&quot;

== Notable photographs ==


Arbus&#x27;s most well-known photographs include:
* &quot;Child with Toy Hand Grenade in Central Park, N.Y.C. 1962&quot; – Colin Wood, with the left strap of his jumper awkwardly hanging off his shoulder, tensely holds his long, thin arms by his side. Clenching a toy grenade in his right hand and holding his left hand in a claw-like gesture, his facial expression is one of consternation. The contact sheet demonstrates that Arbus made an editorial choice in selecting which image to print. A print of this photograph was sold in 2015 at auction for $785,000, an auction record for Arbus.
* &quot;Teenage Couple on Hudson Street, N.Y.C., 1963&quot; – Wearing long coats and &quot;worldlywise expressions&quot;, two adolescents appear older than their ages.
* &quot;Triplets in Their Bedroom, N.J. 1963&quot; – Three girls sit at the head of a bed.
* &quot;A Young Brooklyn Family Going for a Sunday Outing, N.Y.C. 1966&quot; – Richard and Marylin Dauria, who lived in the Bronx. Marylin holds their baby daughter, and Richard holds the hand of their young son, who is intellectually disabled.
* &quot;A Young Man in Curlers at Home on West 20th Street, N.Y.C. 1966&quot; – A close-up shows the man&#x27;s pock-marked face with plucked eyebrows, and his hand with long fingernails holds a cigarette. Early reactions to the photograph were strong; for example, someone spat on it in 1967 at the Museum of Modern Art. A print was sold for $198,400 at a 2004 auction.
* &quot;Boy With a Straw Hat Waiting to March in a Pro-War Parade, N.Y.C. 1967&quot; – With an American flag at his side, he wears a bow tie, a pin in the shape of a bow tie with an American flag motif, and two round button badges: &quot;Bomb Hanoi&quot; and &quot;God Bless America / Support Our Boys in Viet Nam&quot;. The image may cause the viewer to feel both different from the boy and sympathetic toward him. An art consulting firm purchased a print for $245,000 at a 2016 auction.
* &quot;Identical Twins, Roselle, N.J. 1967&quot; – Young twin sisters Cathleen and Colleen Wade stand side by side in dark dresses. The uniformity of their clothing and haircut characterize them as being twins while the facial expressions strongly accentuate their individuality. This photograph is echoed in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film &quot;The Shining&quot;, which features twins in an identical pose as ghosts. A print was sold at auction for $732,500 in 2018.
* &quot;A Family on Their Lawn One Sunday in Westchester, N.Y. 1968&quot; – A woman and a man sunbathe while a boy bends over a small plastic wading pool behind them. In 1972, Neil Selkirk was put in charge of producing an exhibition print of this image when Marvin Israel advised him to make the background trees appear &quot;like a theatrical backdrop that might at any moment roll forward across the lawn.&quot;. This anecdote illustrates vividly just how fundamental dialectics between appearance and substance are for the understanding of Arbus&#x27;s art. A print was sold at auction in 2008 for $553,000.
* &quot;A Naked Man Being a Woman, N.Y.C. 1968&quot; – The subject has been described as in a &quot;Venus-on-the-half-shell pose&quot; (referring to &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot; by Sandro Botticelli) or as &quot;a Madonna turned in contrapposto... with his penis hidden between his legs&quot; (referring to a Madonna in contrapposto). The parted curtain behind the man adds to the theatrical quality of the photograph.
* &quot;A Very Young Baby, N.Y.C. 1968&quot; – A photograph for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; depicts Gloria Vanderbilt&#x27;s then-infant son, the future CNN anchorman Anderson Cooper.
* &quot;A Jewish Giant at Home with His Parents in The Bronx, N.Y. 1970&quot; – Eddie Carmel, the &quot;Jewish Giant&quot;, stands in his family&#x27;s apartment with his much shorter mother and father. Arbus reportedly said to a friend about this picture: &quot;You know how every mother has nightmares when she&#x27;s pregnant that her baby will be born a monster?... I think I got that in the mother&#x27;s face...&quot; The photograph motivated Carmel&#x27;s cousin to narrate a 1999 audio documentary about him. A print was sold at auction for $583,500 in 2017.

In addition, Arbus&#x27;s &quot;A box of ten photographs&quot; was a portfolio of selected 1963–1970 photographs in a clear Plexiglas box/frame that was designed by Marvin Israel and was to have been issued in a limited edition of 50. However, Arbus completed only eight boxes and sold only four (two to Richard Avedon, one to Jasper Johns, and one to Bea Feitler). After Arbus&#x27;s death, under the auspices of the Estate of Diane Arbus, Neil Selkirk began printing to complete Arbus&#x27;s intended edition of 50. In 2017, one of these posthumous editions sold for $792,500 in 2017.

<doc id="162736" wikidata="Q109038773" url="?curid=162736" title="Heterogamy">
<text>Heterogamy is a term applied to a variety of distinct phenomena in different scientific domains. Usually having to do with some kind of difference, &quot;hetero&quot;, in reproduction, &quot;gamy&quot;. See below for more specific senses.

==Science==
===Reproductive biology===
In reproductive biology, heterogamy is the alternation of differently organized generations, applied to the alternation between parthenogenetic and a sexual generation. This type of heterogamy occurs for example in some aphids.

Alternately, &quot;heterogamy&quot; or &quot;heterogamous&quot; is often used as a synonym of heterogametic, meaning the presence of two unlike chromosomes in a sex. For example, XY males and ZW females are called the heterogamous sex.

===Cell biology===

In cell biology, heterogamy is a synonym of anisogamy, the condition of having differently sized male and female gametes produced by different sexes or mating types in a species.

===Botany===

In botany, a plant is heterogamous when it carries at least two different types of flowers in regard to their reproductive structures, for example male and female flowers or bisexual and female flowers. Stamens and carpels are not regularly present in each flower or floret.

==Social science==

In sociology, heterogamy refers to a marriage between two individuals that differ in a certain criterion, and is contrasted with homogamy for a marriage or union between partners that match according to that criterion. For example, ethnic heterogamy refers to marriages involving individuals of different ethnic groups. Age heterogamy refers to marriages involving partners of significantly different ages. Heterogamy and homogamy are also used to describe marriage or union between people of unlike and like sex (or gender) respectively.

<doc id="162742" wikidata="Q75889" url="?curid=162742" title="Friedrich Hölderlin">
<text>Johann Christian Friedrich Hölderlin (, ; ; 20 March 1770 – 7 June 1843) was a German poet and philosopher. Described by Norbert von Hellingrath as &quot;the most German of Germans&quot;, Hölderlin was a key figure of German Romanticism. Particularly due to his early association with and philosophical influence on Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, he was also an important thinker in the development of German Idealism.

Born in Lauffen am Neckar, Hölderlin had a childhood marked by bereavement. His mother intended for him to enter the Lutheran ministry, and he attended the Tübinger Stift, where he was friends with Hegel and Schelling. He graduated in 1793 but could not devote himself to the Christian faith, instead becoming a tutor. Two years later, he briefly attended the University of Jena, where he interacted with Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Novalis, before resuming his career as a tutor. He struggled to establish himself as a poet, and was plagued by mental illness. He was sent to a clinic in 1806 but deemed incurable and instead given lodging by a carpenter, Ernst Zimmer. He spent the final 36 years of his life in Zimmer&#x27;s residence, and died in 1843 at the age of 73.

Hölderlin followed the tradition of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller as an admirer of Greek mythology and Ancient Greek poets such as Pindar and Sophocles, and melded Christian and Hellenic themes in his works. Martin Heidegger, upon whom Hölderlin had a great influence, said: &quot;Hölderlin is one of our greatest, that is, most impending thinkers because he is our greatest poet.&quot;

==Biography==
===Early life===

Johann Christian Friedrich Hölderlin was born on 20 March 1770 in Lauffen am Neckar, then a part of the Duchy of Württemberg. He was the first child of Johanna Christiana Heyn (1748—1828) and Heinrich Friedrich Hölderlin (1736—1772). His father, the manager of a church estate, died when he was two years old, and Friedrich and his sister, Heinrike, were brought up by their mother.

In 1774, his mother moved the family to Nürtingen when she married Johann Christoph Gok. Two years later, Johann Gok became the burgomaster of Nürtingen, and Hölderlin&#x27;s half-brother, Karl Christoph Friedrich Gok, was born. In 1779, Johann Gok died at the age of 30. Hölderlin later expressed how his childhood was scarred by grief and sorrow, writing in a 1799 correspondence with his mother:

===Education===
Hölderlin began his education in 1776, and his mother planned for him to join the Lutheran church. In preparation for entrance exams into a monastery, he received additional instruction in Greek, Hebrew, Latin and rhetoric, starting in 1782. During this time, he struck a friendship with Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, who was five years Hölderlin&#x27;s junior. On account of the age difference, Schelling was &quot;subjected to universal teasing&quot; and Hölderlin protected him from abuse by older students. Also during this time, Hölderlin began playing the piano and developed an interest in travel literature through exposure to Georg Forster&#x27;s &quot;A Voyage Round the World&quot;.

In 1784, Hölderlin entered the Lower Monastery in Denkendorf and started his formal training for entry into the Lutheran ministry. At Denkendorf, he discovered the poetry of Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, and took tentative steps in composing his own verses. The earliest known letter of Hölderlin&#x27;s is dated 1784 and addressed to his former tutor Nathanael Köstlin. In the letter, Hölderlin hinted at his wavering faith in Christianity and anxiety about his mental state.

Hölderlin progressed to the Higher Monastery at Maulbronn in 1786. There he fell in love with Luise Nast, the daughter of the monastery&#x27;s administrator, and began to doubt his desire to join the ministry; he composed &quot;Mein Vorsatz&quot; in 1787, in which he states his intention to attain &quot;Pindar&#x27;s light&quot; and reach &quot;Klopstock-heights&quot;. In 1788, he read Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlos&quot; on Luise Nast&#x27;s recommendation. Hölderlin later wrote a letter to Schiller regarding &quot;Don Carlos&quot;, stating: &quot;It won&#x27;t be easy to study &quot;Carlos&quot; in a rational way, since he was for so many years the magic cloud in which the good god of my youth enveloped me so that I would not see too soon the pettiness and barbarity of the world.&quot;
In October 1788, Hölderlin began his theological studies at the Tübinger Stift, where his fellow students included Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Isaac von Sinclair and Schelling. It has been speculated that it was Hölderlin who, during their time in Tübingen, brought to Hegel&#x27;s attention the ideas of Heraclitus regarding the unity of opposites, which Hegel would later develop into his concept of dialectics. In 1789, Hölderlin broke off his engagement with Luise Nast, writing to her: &quot;I wish you happiness if you choose one more worthy than me, and then surely you will understand that you could never have been happy with your morose, ill-humoured, and sickly friend,&quot; and expressed his desire to transfer out and study law but succumbed to pressure from his mother to remain in the Stift.

Along with Hegel and Schelling and his other peers during his time in the Stift, Hölderlin was an enthusiastic supporter of the French Revolution. Although he rejected the violence of the Reign of Terror, his commitment to the principles of 1789 remained intense. Hölderlin&#x27;s republican sympathies influenced many of his most famous works such as &quot;Hyperion&quot; and &quot;The Death of Empedocles&quot;.

===Career===
After he obtained his magister degree in 1793, his mother expected him to enter the ministry. However, Hölderlin found no satisfaction in the prevailing Protestant theology, and worked instead as a private tutor. In 1794, he met Friedrich Schiller and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and began writing his epistolary novel &quot;Hyperion&quot;. In 1795 he enrolled for a while at the University of Jena where he attended Johann Gottlieb Fichte&#x27;s classes and met Novalis.

There is a seminal manuscript, dated 1797, now known as the &quot;Das älteste Systemprogramm des deutschen Idealismus&quot; (&quot;The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism&quot;). Although the document is in Hegel&#x27;s handwriting, it is thought to have been written by Hegel, Schelling, Hölderlin, or an unknown fourth person.

As a tutor in Frankfurt am Main from 1796 to 1798, he fell in love with Susette Gontard, the wife of his employer, the banker Jakob Gontard. The feeling was mutual, and this relationship became the most important in Hölderlin&#x27;s life. After a while, their affair was discovered, and Hölderlin was harshly dismissed. He then lived in Homburg from 1798 to 1800, meeting Susette in secret once a month and attempting to establish himself as a poet, but his life was plagued by financial worries and he had to accept a small allowance from his mother. His mandated separation from Susette Gontard also worsened Hölderlin&#x27;s doubts about himself and his value as a poet; he wished to transform German culture but did not have the influence he needed. From 1797 to 1800, he produced three versions—all unfinished—of a tragedy in the Greek manner, &quot;The Death of Empedocles&quot;, and composed odes in the vein of the Ancient Greeks Alcaeus and Asclepiades of Samos.

===Mental breakdown===
In the late 1790s, Hölderlin was diagnosed with schizophrenia, then referred to as &quot;hypochondrias&quot;, a condition that would worsen after his last meeting with Susette Gontard in 1800. After a sojourn in Stuttgart at the end of 1800, likely to work on his translations of Pindar, he found further employment as a tutor in Hauptwyl, Switzerland, and then at the household of the Hamburg consul in Bordeaux, in 1802. His stay in the French city is celebrated in &quot;Andenken&quot; (&quot;Remembrance&quot;), one of his greatest poems. In a few months, however, he returned home on foot via Paris (where he saw authentic Greek sculptures, as opposed to Roman or modern copies, for the only time in his life). He arrived at his home in Nürtingen both physically and mentally exhausted in late 1802, and learned that Gontard had died from influenza in Frankfurt at around the same time.

At his home in Nürtingen with his mother, a devout Christian, Hölderlin melded his Hellenism with Christianity and sought to unite ancient values with modern life; in his elegy &quot;Brod und Wein&quot; (&quot;Bread and Wine&quot;), Christ is seen as sequential to the Greek gods, bringing bread from the earth and wine from Dionysus. After two years in Nürtingen, Hölderlin was taken to the court of Homburg by Isaac von Sinclair, who found a sinecure for him as court librarian, but in 1805 von Sinclair was denounced as a conspirator and tried for treason. Hölderlin was in danger of being tried too but was declared mentally unfit to stand trial. On 11 September 1806, he was delivered into the clinic at Tübingen run by Dr. Johann Heinrich Ferdinand von Autenrieth, the inventor of a mask for the prevention of screaming in the mentally ill.
The clinic was attached to the University of Tübingen and the poet Justinus Kerner, then a student of medicine, was assigned to look after Hölderlin. The following year Hölderlin was discharged as incurable and given three years to live, but was taken in by the carpenter Ernst Zimmer (a cultured man, who had read &quot;Hyperion&quot;) and given a room in his house in Tübingen, which had been a tower in the old city wall with a view across the Neckar river. The tower would later be named the Hölderlinturm, after the poet&#x27;s 36-year-long stay in the room. His residence in the building made up the second half of his life and is also referred to as the &quot;Turmzeit&quot; (or &quot;Tower period&quot;). 

===Later life and death===

In the tower, Hölderlin continued to write poetry of a simplicity and formality quite unlike what he had been writing up to 1805. As time went on he became a minor tourist attraction and was visited by curious travelers and autograph-hunters. Often he would play the piano or spontaneously write short verses for such visitors, pure in versification but almost empty of affect—although a few of these (such as the famous &quot;Die Linien des Lebens&quot; (&quot;The Lines of Life&quot;), which he wrote out for his carer Zimmer on a piece of wood) have a piercing beauty and have been set to music by many composers.

Hölderlin&#x27;s own family did not financially support him but petitioned successfully for his upkeep to be paid by the state. His mother and sister never visited him, and his stepbrother did so only once. His mother died in 1828: his sister and stepbrother quarreled over the inheritance, arguing that too large a share had been allotted to Hölderlin, and unsuccessfully tried to have the will overturned in court. Neither of them attended his funeral in 1843 nor did his childhood friends, Hegel (as he had died roughly a decade prior) and Schelling, who had long since ignored him; the Zimmer family were his only mourners. His inheritance, including the patrimony left to him by his father when he was two, had been kept from him by his mother and was untouched and continually accruing interest. He died a rich man, but did not know it.

==Works==
The poetry of Hölderlin, widely recognized today as one of the highest points of German literature, was little known or understood during his lifetime, and slipped into obscurity shortly after his death; his illness and reclusion made him fade from his contemporaries&#x27; consciousness—and, even though selections of his work were published by his friends during his lifetime, it was largely ignored for the rest of the 19th century.
Like Goethe and Schiller, his older contemporaries, Hölderlin was a fervent admirer of ancient Greek culture, but for him the Greek gods were not the plaster figures of conventional classicism, but wonderfully life-giving actual presences, yet at the same time terrifying. Much later, Friedrich Nietzsche would recognize Hölderlin as the poet who first acknowledged the Orphic and Dionysian Greece of the mysteries, which he would fuse with the Pietism of his native Swabia in a highly original religious experience. Hölderlin developed an early idea of cyclical history and therefore believed political radicalism and an aesthetic interest in antiquity, and, in parallel, Christianity and Paganism should be fused. He understood and sympathised with the Greek idea of the tragic fall, which he expressed movingly in the last stanza of his &quot;Hyperions Schicksalslied&quot; (&quot;Hyperion&#x27;s Song of Destiny&quot;).

In the great poems of his maturity, Hölderlin would generally adopt a large-scale, expansive and unrhymed style. Together with these long hymns, odes and elegies—which included &quot;Der Archipelagus&quot; (&quot;The Archipelago&quot;), &quot;Brod und Wein&quot; (&quot;Bread and Wine&quot;) and &quot;Patmos&quot;—he also cultivated a crisper, more concise manner in epigrams and couplets, and in short poems like the famous &quot;Hälfte des Lebens&quot; (&quot;The Middle of Life&quot;).

In the years after his return from Bordeaux, he completed some of his greatest poems but also, once they were finished, returned to them repeatedly, creating new and stranger versions sometimes in several layers on the same manuscript, which makes the editing of his works troublesome. Some of these later versions (and some later poems) are fragmentary, but they have astonishing intensity. He seems sometimes also to have considered the fragments, even with unfinished lines and incomplete sentence-structure, to be poems in themselves. This obsessive revising and his stand-alone fragments were once considered evidence of his mental disorder, but they were to prove very influential on later poets such as Paul Celan. In his years of madness, Hölderlin would occasionally pencil ingenuous rhymed quatrains, sometimes of a childlike beauty, which he would sign with fantastic names (most often &quot;Scardanelli&quot;) and give fictitious dates from previous or future centuries.

==Dissemination and influence==

Hölderlin&#x27;s major publication in his lifetime was his novel &quot;Hyperion&quot;, which was issued in two volumes (1797 and 1799). Various individual poems were published but attracted little attention. In 1799 he produced a periodical, &quot;Iduna&quot;.

In 1804, his translations of the dramas of Sophocles were published but were generally met with derision over their apparent artificiality and difficulty, which according to his critics were caused by transposing Greek idioms into German. However, 20th-century theorists of translation such as Walter Benjamin have vindicated them, showing their importance as a new—and greatly influential—model of poetic translation. &quot;Der Rhein&quot; and &quot;Patmos&quot;, two of the longest and most densely charged of his hymns, appeared in a poetic calendar in 1808.

Wilhelm Waiblinger, who visited Hölderlin in his tower repeatedly in 1822–23 and depicted him in the protagonist of his novel &quot;Phaëthon&quot;, stated the necessity of issuing an edition of his poems, and the first collection of his poetry was released by Ludwig Uhland and Christoph Theodor Schwab in 1826. However, Uhland and Schwab omitted anything they suspected might be &quot;touched by insanity&quot;, which included much of Hölderlin&#x27;s fragmented works. A copy of this collection was given to Hölderlin, but later was stolen by an autograph-hunter. A second, enlarged edition with a biographical essay appeared in 1842, the year before Hölderlin&#x27;s death.

Only in 1913 did Norbert von Hellingrath, a member of the literary Circle led by the German Symbolist poet Stefan George, publish the first two volumes of what eventually became a six-volume edition of Hölderlin&#x27;s poems, prose and letters (the &quot;Berlin Edition&quot;, &quot;Berliner Ausgabe&quot;). For the first time, Hölderlin&#x27;s hymnic drafts and fragments were published and it became possible to gain some overview of his work in the years between 1800 and 1807, which had been only sparsely covered in earlier editions. The Berlin edition and von Hellingrath&#x27;s advocacy led to Hölderlin posthumously receiving the recognition that had always eluded him in life. As a result, Hölderlin has been recognized since 1913 as one of the greatest poets ever to write in the German language.
Norbert von Hellingrath enlisted in the Imperial German Army at the outbreak of World War I and was killed in action at the Battle of Verdun in 1916. The fourth volume of the Berlin edition was published posthumously. The Berlin Edition was completed after the German Revolution of 1918 by Friedrich Seebass and Ludwig von Pigenot; the remaining volumes appeared in Berlin between 1922 and 1923.

Already in 1912, before the Berlin Edition began to appear, Rainer Maria Rilke composed his first two &quot;Duino Elegies&quot; whose form and spirit draw strongly on the hymns and elegies of Hölderlin. Rilke had met von Hellingrath a few years earlier and had seen some of the hymn drafts, and the &quot;Duino Elegies&quot; heralded the beginning of a new appreciation of Hölderlin&#x27;s late work. Although his hymns can hardly be imitated, they have become a powerful influence on modern poetry in German and other languages, and are sometimes cited as the very crown of German lyric poetry.
The Berlin Edition was to some extent superseded by the Stuttgart Edition (&quot;Grosse Stuttgarter Ausgabe&quot;), which began to be published in 1943 and eventually saw completion in 1986. This undertaking was much more rigorous in textual criticism than the Berlin Edition and solved many issues of interpretation raised by Hölderlin&#x27;s unfinished and undated texts (sometimes several versions of the same poem with major differences). Meanwhile, a third complete edition, the Frankfurt Critical Edition (&quot;Frankfurter Historisch-kritische Ausgabe&quot;), began publication in 1975 under the editorship of Dietrich Sattler.

Though Hölderlin&#x27;s hymnic style—dependent as it is on a genuine belief in the divine—creates a deeply personal fusion of Greek mythic figures and romantic mysticism about nature, which can appear both strange and enticing, his shorter and sometimes more fragmentary poems have exerted wide influence too on later German poets, from Georg Trakl onwards. He also had an influence on the poetry of Hermann Hesse and Paul Celan. (Celan wrote a poem about Hölderlin, called &quot;Tübingen, January&quot; which ends with the word &quot;Pallaksch&quot;—according to Schwab, Hölderlin&#x27;s favourite neologism &quot;which sometimes meant Yes, sometimes No&quot;.)

Hölderlin was also a thinker who wrote, fragmentarily, on poetic theory and philosophical matters. His theoretical works, such as the essays &quot;Das Werden im Vergehen&quot; (&quot;Becoming in Dissolution&quot;) and &quot;Urteil und Sein&quot; (&quot;Judgement and Being&quot;) are insightful and important if somewhat tortuous and difficult to parse. They raise many of the key problems also addressed by his Tübingen roommates Hegel and Schelling, and, though his poetry was never &quot;theory-driven&quot;, the interpretation and exegesis of some of his more difficult poems have given rise to profound philosophical speculation by thinkers such as Martin Heidegger, Theodor Adorno, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault and Alain Badiou.

===Music===

Hölderlin&#x27;s poetry has inspired many composers, generating vocal music and instrumental music.

;Vocal music
One of the earliest settings of Hölderlin&#x27;s poetry is &quot;Schicksalslied&quot; by Johannes Brahms, based on &quot;Hyperions Schicksalslied&quot;. Other composers of Hölderlin settings include Ludwig van Beethoven (&quot;An die Hoffnung - Opus 32&quot;), Peter Cornelius, Hans Pfitzner, Richard Strauss (&quot;Drei Hymnen&quot;), Max Reger (&quot;An die Hoffnung&quot;), Alphons Diepenbrock (&quot;Die Nacht&quot;), Walter Braunfels (&quot;Der Tod fürs Vaterland&quot;), Richard Wetz (&quot;Hyperion&quot;), Josef Matthias Hauer, Denise Roger, Hermann Reutter, Margarete Schweikert, Stefan Wolpe, Paul Hindemith, Benjamin Britten (&quot;Sechs Hölderlin-Fragmente&quot;), Hans Werner Henze, Bruno Maderna (&quot;Hyperion&quot;, &quot;Stele an Diotima&quot;), Luigi Nono (&quot;Prometeo&quot;), Heinz Holliger (the &quot;Scardanelli-Zyklus&quot;), Hans Zender (&quot;Hölderlin lesen I-IV&quot;), György Kurtág (who planned an opera on Hölderlin), György Ligeti (&quot;Three Fantasies after Friedrich Hölderlin&quot;), Hanns Eisler (&quot;Hollywood Liederbuch&quot;), Viktor Ullmann, Wolfgang von Schweinitz, Walter Zimmermann (&quot;Hyperion&quot;, an epistolary opera) and Wolfgang Rihm. Siegfried Matthus composed the orchestral song cycle &quot;Hyperion-Fragmente&quot;. Carl Orff used Hölderlin&#x27;s German translations of Sophocles in his operas &quot;Antigone&quot; and &quot;Oedipus der Tyrann&quot;. In 2020, for the 250th anniversary of Hölderlin&#x27;s birth, the American composaer Chris Jarrett wrote &quot;Sechs Hölderlin Lieder&quot; for baritone and piano. They have been recorded on the DaVinci Classics label and are available in print as well.

Wilhelm Killmayer based three song cycles, &quot;Hölderlin-Lieder&quot;, for tenor and orchestra on Hölderlin&#x27;s late poems; Kaija Saariaho&#x27;s &quot;Tag des Jahrs&quot; (2001) for mixed choir and electronics is based on four of these poems, while more are set in her &quot;Überzeugung&quot; for choir (2001) and &quot;Die Aussicht&quot; for soprano and four instruments (1996). In 2003, Graham Waterhouse composed a song cycle, &quot;Sechs späteste Lieder&quot;, for voice and cello based on six of Hölderlin&#x27;s late poems. Lucien Posman based a concerto-cantate for clarinet, choir, piano &amp; percussion on 3 Hölderlin poems (Teil 1. &quot;Die Eichbäume&quot;, Teil 2. &quot;Mein Eigentum&quot;, Teil 3. &quot;Da ich ein Knabe war&quot;) (2015). He also set &quot;An die Parzen&quot; to music for choir &amp; piano (2012) and &quot;Hälfte des Lebens&quot; for choir. Several works by Georg Friedrich Haas take their titles or text from Hölderlin&#x27;s writing, including &quot;Hyperion&quot;, &quot;Nacht&quot;, and the solo ensemble &quot;... &quot;Einklang freier Wesen&quot; ...&quot; as well as its constituent solo pieces each named &quot;... aus freier Lust ... verbunden ...&quot;. In 2020, as part of the German celebration of Hölderlin&#x27;s 250th birthday, Chris Jarrett composed his &quot;Sechs Hölderlin Lieder&quot; for baritone and piano.

Finnish melodic death metal band Insomnium set Hölderlin&#x27;s verses to music in several of their songs, and many songs of Swedish alternative rock band ALPHA 60 also contain lyrical references to Hölderlin&#x27;s poetry.

;Instrumental music
Robert Schumann&#x27;s late piano suite &quot;Gesänge der Frühe&quot; was inspired by Hölderlin, as was Luigi Nono&#x27;s string quartet &quot;Fragmente-Stille, an Diotima&quot; and parts of his opera &quot;Prometeo&quot;. Josef Matthias Hauer wrote many piano pieces inspired by individual lines of Hölderlin&#x27;s poems. Paul Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;First Piano Sonata&quot; is influenced by Hölderlin&#x27;s poem &quot;Der Main&quot;. Hans Werner Henze&#x27;s Seventh Symphony is partly inspired by Hölderlin.

<text>Ingeborg Hermine &quot;Inge&quot; Morath (; 27 May 1923 – 30 January 2002) was an Austrian photographer. In 1953, she joined the Magnum Photos Agency, founded by top photographers in Paris, and became a full photographer with the agency in 1955. Morath was the third wife of Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Arthur Miller; their daughter is screenwriter/director Rebecca Miller.

==Early years (1923–1945)==
Morath was born in Graz, Austria, to Mathilde (Wiesler) and Edgar Morath, scientists whose work took them to different laboratories and universities in Europe during her childhood. Her parents had converted from Catholicism to Protestantism. First educated in French-speaking schools, Morath relocated in the 1930s with her family to Darmstadt, a German intellectual center, and then to Berlin, where Morath&#x27;s father directed a laboratory specializing in wood chemistry. Morath was registered at the &quot;Luisenschule&quot; near Bahnhof Friedrichstraße.

Morath&#x27;s first encounter with &quot;avant-garde&quot; art was the &quot;Entartete Kunst&quot; (Degenerate Art) exhibition organized by the Nazi Party in 1937, which sought to inflame public opinion against modern art. &quot;I found a number of these paintings exciting and fell in love with Franz Marc&#x27;s &quot;Blue Horse&quot;&quot;, Morath later wrote. &quot;Only negative comments were allowed, and thus began a long period of keeping silent and concealing thoughts.&quot;

After finishing high school, Morath passed the &quot;Abitur&quot; and was obliged to complete six months of service for the &quot;Reichsarbeitsdienst&quot; (Reich Labour Service) before entering Berlin University. At university, Morath studied languages. She became fluent in French, English and Romanian in addition to her native German (to these she later added Spanish, Russian and Chinese). &quot;I studied where I could find a quiet space, in the University and the Underground stations that served as air-raid shelters. I did not join the &quot;Studentenschaft&quot; (Student Body).&quot;

Toward the end of World War II, Morath was drafted for factory service in Tempelhof, a neighbourhood of Berlin, alongside Ukrainian prisoners of war.

During an attack on the factory by Russian bombers, she fled on foot to Austria. In later years, Morath refused to photograph war, preferring to work on stories that showed its consequences.

==Middle years (1945–1962)==

After the war, Morath worked as a translator and journalist. In 1948, she was hired by Warren Trabant, first as Vienna Correspondent and later as the Austrian editor, for &quot;Heute&quot;, an illustrated magazine published by the Office of War Information in Munich. Morath encountered photographer Ernst Haas in post-war Vienna, and brought his work to Trabant&#x27;s attention. Working together for &quot;Heute&quot;, Morath wrote articles to accompany Haas&#x27; pictures. In 1949, Morath and Haas were invited by Robert Capa to join the newly founded Magnum Photos in Paris, where she started as an editor. Working with contact sheets sent into the Magnum office by founding member Henri Cartier-Bresson fascinated Morath. &quot;I think that in studying his way of photographing I learned how to photograph myself, before I ever took a camera into my hand.&quot;

Morath was briefly married to the British journalist Lionel Birch and relocated to London in 1951. That same year, she began to photograph during a visit to Venice. &quot;It was instantly clear to me that from now on I would be a photographer&quot;, she wrote. &quot;As I continued to photograph I became quite joyous. I knew that I could express the things I wanted to say by giving them form through my eyes.&quot; Morath applied for an apprenticeship with Simon Guttman, who was then an editor for &quot;Picture Post&quot; and running the picture-agency Report. When Guttman asked what Morath wanted to photograph, and why, she answered that &quot;after the isolation of Nazism I felt I had found my language in photography.&quot; After Morath had spent several months working as Guttman&#x27;s secretary, she had an opportunity to take photographs. She sold her first photographs - of opening nights, exhibitions, inaugurations, etc. - under the pseudonym &quot;Egni Tharom&quot;, her names spelled backwards.

Morath divorced Birch and returned to Paris to pursue a career in photography. In 1953, after Morath presented her first large picture story, on the Worker Priests of Paris, to Capa, he invited her to join Magnum as a photographer. Her first assignments were stories that did not interest &quot;the big boys.&quot; She went to London on an early assignment to photograph the residents of Soho and Mayfair. Morath&#x27;s portrait of Mrs. Eveleigh Nash, from that assignment, is among her best-known works. At Capa&#x27;s suggestion, in 1953–54, Morath worked with Cartier-Bresson as a researcher and assistant. In 1955 she was invited to become a full member of Magnum Photos. During the late 1950s, Morath traveled widely, covering stories in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the United States, and South America, for such publications as &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;Paris Match&quot;, and &quot;Vogue&quot;. In 1955 she published &quot;Guerre à la Tristesse&quot;, photographs of Spain, with Robert Delpire, followed by &quot;De la Perse à l&#x27;Iran&quot;, photographs of Iran, in 1958. Morath published more than thirty monographs during her lifetime.

Like many Magnum members, Morath worked as a stills photographer on numerous motion picture sets. Having met director John Huston while she was living in London, Morath worked on several of his films. Huston&#x27;s &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; (1952) was one of Morath&#x27;s earliest assignments, and her first time working in a film studio. When Morath confessed to Huston that she had only one roll of color film to work with and asked for his help, Huston bought three more rolls for her, and occasionally waved to her to indicate the right moments to step in with her camera. Huston later wrote of Morath that she &quot;is a high priestess of photography. She has the rare ability to penetrate beyond surfaces and reveal what makes her subject tick.&quot;

In 1959, while photographing the making of &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;, starring Audrey Hepburn, Burt Lancaster, and Audie Murphy, Morath accompanied Huston and his friends duck hunting on a mountain lake outside Durango, Mexico. Photographing the excursion, Morath saw through her telephoto lens that Murphy&#x27;s companion had capsized their boat from shore. She could see that Murphy was stunned, and the men were struggling. A skilled swimmer, Morath swam out, stripped down and used her bra straps to haul the two men ashore .
Morath worked again with Huston in 1960 on the set of &quot;The Misfits&quot;, a film featuring Marilyn Monroe, Clark Gable and Montgomery Clift, with a screenplay by Arthur Miller. Magnum Photos had been given exclusive rights to photograph the making of the movie, and Morath and Cartier-Bresson were the first of nine photographers to work on location outside Reno, Nevada during the process. Morath met Miller while working on &quot;The Misfits&quot;.

==Later years (1962–2002)==

Morath married Arthur Miller on 17 February 1962 and relocated permanently to the United States. Miller and Morath&#x27;s first child, Rebecca, was born in September 1962. The couple&#x27;s second child, Daniel, was born in 1966 with Down syndrome and was institutionalized shortly after his birth. Rebecca Miller is a film director, actress, and writer who is married to the actor Daniel Day-Lewis.

After re-locating to the United States, during the 1960s and 1970s Morath worked closer to home, raising a family with Miller and working with him on several projects. Their first collaboration was the book &quot;In Russia&quot; (1969), which, together with &quot;Chinese Encounters&quot; (1979), described their travels and meetings in the Soviet Union and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. &quot;In the Country&quot;, published in 1977, was an intimate look at their immediate surroundings. For both Miller, who had lived much of his life in New York City, and Morath, who had come to the US from Europe, the Connecticut countryside offered a fresh encounter with America.

Reflecting on the importance of Morath&#x27;s linguistic gifts, Miller wrote that &quot;travel with her was a privilege because [alone] I would never been able to penetrate that way.&quot; In their travels Morath translated for Miller, while his literary work was the entrée for Morath to encounter an international artistic elite. The Austrian photographer Kurt Kaindl, her long-time colleague, noted that &quot;their cooperation develop[ed] without outward pressure and is solely motivated by their common interest in the people and the respective cultural sphere, a situation that corresponds to Inge Morath&#x27;s working style, since she generally feels inhibited by assignments.&quot;

Morath sought out, befriended, and photographed artists and writers. During the 1950s she photographed artists for Robert Delpire&#x27;s magazine &quot;L&#x27;Oeil&quot;, including Jean Arp and Alberto Giacometti. She met the artist Saul Steinberg in 1958. When she went to his home to make a portrait, Steinberg came to the door wearing a mask which he had fashioned from a paper bag. Over a period of several years, they collaborated on a series of portraits, inviting individuals and groups of people to pose for Morath wearing Steinberg&#x27;s masks. Another long-term project was Morath&#x27;s documentation of many of the most important productions of Arthur Miller&#x27;s plays.
Some of Morath&#x27;s signal achievements are in portraiture, including posed images of celebrities as well as fleeting images of anonymous passersby. Her pictures of Boris Pasternak&#x27;s home, Pushkin&#x27;s library, Chekhov&#x27;s house, Mao Zedong&#x27;s bedroom, as well as artists&#x27; studios and cemetery memorials, are permeated with the spirit of invisible people still present. The writer Philip Roth, whom Morath photographed in 1965, described her as &quot;the most engaging, sprightly, seemingly harmless voyeur I know. If you&#x27;re one of her subjects, you hardly know your guard is down and your secret recorded until it&#x27;s too late. She is a tender intruder with an invisible camera.&quot;

As the scope of her projects grew, Morath prepared extensively by studying the language, art, and literature of a country to encounter its culture fully. Although photography was the primary means through which Morath found expression, it was but one of her skills. In addition to the many languages in which she was fluent, Morath was also a prolific diary and letter-writer; her dual gift for words and pictures made her unusual among her colleagues. Morath wrote extensively, and often amusingly, about her photographic subjects. Although she rarely published these texts during her lifetime, posthumous publications have focused upon this aspect of her work. They have brought together her photographs with journal writings, caption notes, and other archival materials relating to her various projects.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Morath continued to pursue both assignments and independent projects. The film &quot;Copyright by Inge Morath&quot; was made by German filmmaker Sabine Eckhard in 1992, and was one of several films selected for a presentation of Magnum Films at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2007. Eckhard filmed Morath at home and in her studio, and in New York and Paris with her colleagues, including Cartier-Bresson, Elliott Erwitt and others. In 2002, working with film director Regina Strassegger, Morath fulfilled a long-held wish to revisit the lands of her ancestors, along the borderlands of Styria and Slovenia. This mountainous region, once part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, had become the faultline between two conflicting ideologies after World War II and until 1991, when attempts at rapprochement led to conflict on both sides of the border. The book &quot;Last Journey&quot; (2002), and Strasseger&#x27;s film &quot;Grenz Räume&quot; (Border Space, 2002), document Morath&#x27;s visits to her homeland during the final years of her life.

<doc id="162745" wikidata="Q441276" url="?curid=162745" title="James Brooke">
<text>Sir James Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak (29 April 1803 – 11 June 1868), was a British soldier and adventurer who founded the Raj of Sarawak in Borneo. He ruled as the first White Rajah of Sarawak from 1841 until his death in 1868.

Brooke was born and raised in India during the rule of the British East India Company. After a few years of education in England, he served in the Bengal Army, was wounded, and resigned his commission. He then bought a ship and sailed to the Malay Archipelago where, in gratitude for helping to crush a rebellion, he was rewarded with the position of governor of Sarawak. He then vigorously suppressed piracy in the region and, in the ensuing turmoil, restored the Sultan of Brunei to his throne, for which the Sultan made Brooke the Rajah of Sarawak. He ruled until his death.

Brooke was not without detractors and was criticised in the British Parliament and officially investigated in Singapore for his anti-piracy measures. He was, however, honoured and feted in London for his activities in Southeast Asia. The naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace was one of many visitors whose published work spoke of his hospitality and achievements.

==Early life==
Brooke was born in Bandel, near Calcutta, Bengal, but baptised in Secrole, a suburb of Benares. His father, Thomas Brooke, was an English judge in the Court of Appeal at Bareilly, British India; his mother, Anna Maria was born in Hertfordshire and was the daughter of Scottish peer Colonel William Stuart, 9th Lord Blantyre, and his mistress Harriott Teasdale. Brooke stayed at home in India until he was sent to England at the age of 12 for a brief education at Norwich School from which he ran away. Some home tutoring followed in Bath before he returned to India in 1819 as an ensign in the Bengal Army of the British East India Company. He saw action in Assam during the First Anglo-Burmese War until he was seriously wounded in 1825 and sent to England for recovery. In 1830, he arrived back in Madras but was too late to rejoin his unit, and resigned his commission. He remained on the ship he had travelled out in – the &quot;Castle Huntley –&quot; and returned home via China.

==Sarawak==
Brooke attempted to trade in the Far East, but was not successful. In 1835 he inherited £30,000 (£3M or US$3.7M in 2022 currency), which he used as capital to purchase the &quot;Royalist,&quot; a 142-ton schooner.
Setting sail for Borneo in 1838, he arrived in Kuching in August to find the settlement facing an uprising against the Sultan of Brunei. In Sarawak he met the Sultan&#x27;s uncle, Pengiran Muda Hashim, to whom he gave assistance in crushing the rebellion, winning the gratitude of Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II of Brunei, who in 1841 offered Brooke the governorship of Sarawak in return for his help.

Rajah Brooke was highly successful in suppressing the widespread piracy of the region. However, some Malay nobles in Brunei, unhappy over Brooke&#x27;s measures against piracy, arranged for the murder of Muda Hashim and his followers. Brooke, with assistance from a unit of Britain&#x27;s China Squadron, took over Brunei and restored its sultan to the throne.

In 1842, the Sultan ceded complete sovereignty of Sarawak to Brooke. He was granted the title of Rajah of Sarawak on 24 September 1841, although the official declaration was not made until 18 August 1842. Brooke&#x27;s cousin, Arthur Chichester Crookshank (1825–1891) joined his service on 1 March 1843 and was appointed as a magistrate.

==Cession of Labuan to Great Britain==

In 1844 Brooke began anti-pirate operations with ships of the Royal Navy and the East India Company off north-east Sumatra. On 12 February, he received a gunshot wound to his right arm and a spear cut to his eyebrow in their second engagement, at Murdu. Later in 1844 the Sultan offered to cede the island of Labuan to the British but terms were not discussed at that time. In November 1846 Captain Rodney Mundy was ordered to obtain the cession of Labuan. He negotiated the cession on 18 December 1846 and took possession of Labuan on 24 December 1846. James Brooke was appointed governor and commander-in-chief of Labuan in 1848.

==Reign==

During his reign, Brooke began to cement his rule over Sarawak: reforming the administration, codifying laws and fighting piracy, which proved to be an ongoing issue throughout his rule. Brooke returned temporarily to England in 1847, where he was given the Freedom of the City of London, appointed British consul-general in Borneo and created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB).

Brooke pacified the native peoples, including the Dayaks, and suppressed headhunting and piracy. He had many Dayaks in his forces and said that only Dayaks could kill Dayaks.

In 1851 Brooke was accused of using excessive force against the native people, under the guise of anti-piracy operations, leading to the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry in Singapore in 1854. After an investigation, the commission dismissed the charges.

Brooke wrote to Alfred Russel Wallace on leaving England in April 1853, &quot;to assure Wallace that he would be very glad to see him at Sarawak.&quot; This was an invitation that helped Wallace decide on the Malay Archipelago for his next expedition, an expedition that lasted for eight years and established him as one of the foremost Victorian intellectuals and naturalists of the time. When Wallace arrived in Singapore in September 1854, he found Rajah Brooke &quot;reluctantly preparing to give evidence to the special commission set up to investigate his controversial anti-piracy activities.&quot;

During his rule, Brooke suppressed an uprising by Liu Shan Bang in 1857 and faced threats from Sarawak warriors like Sharif Masahor and Rentap and managed to suppress them.

==Personal life==

James Brooke was &#x27;a great admirer&#x27; of the novels of Jane Austen, and would &#x27;read them and re-read them&#x27;, including aloud to his companions in Sarawak.

Brooke was influenced by the success of previous British adventurers and the exploits of the East India Company. His actions in Sarawak were directed at expanding the British Empire and the benefits of its rule, assisting the local people by fighting piracy and slavery, and securing his own personal wealth to further these activities. His own abilities, and those of his successors, provided Sarawak with excellent leadership and wealth generation during difficult times, and resulted in both fame and notoriety in some circles. His appointment as rajah by the Sultan, and his subsequent knighthood, are evidence that his efforts were widely applauded in both Sarawak and British society.

Among his alleged relationships was one with Badruddin, a Sarawak prince, of whom he wrote, &quot;my love for him was deeper than anyone I knew.&quot; This phrase led to some considering him to be either homosexual or bisexual. Later, in 1848, Brooke is alleged to have formed a relationship with 16‑year‑old Charles T.C. Grant, grandson of the seventh Earl of Elgin, who supposedly &#x27;reciprocated&#x27;. Whether this relationship was purely a friendship or otherwise is not known. Nigel Barley, one of Brooke&#x27;s recent biographers, wrote that during Brooke&#x27;s final years in Burrator in Devon &quot;there is little doubt ... he was carnally involved with the rough trade of Totnes.&quot; However, Barley does not note from where he garnered this opinion. Others have suggested Brooke was instead &quot;homo-social&quot; and simply preferred the social company of other men, disagreeing with assertions he was a homosexual.

Although Brooke died unmarried, he did acknowledge a son to his family in 1858. Neither the identity of the son&#x27;s mother nor his birth date is clear. This son was brought up as Reuben George Walker in the Brighton household of Frances Walker (1841 and 1851 census, apparently born ). By 1858 he was aware of his connection to Brooke and by 1871 he is on the census at the parish of Plumtree, Nottinghamshire as &quot;George Brooke&quot;, age &quot;40&quot;, birthplace &quot;Sarawak, Borneo&quot;. He married Martha Elizabeth Mowbray on 10 July 1862, and had seven children, three of whom survived infancy; the oldest was named James. George died travelling to Australia, in the wrecking of the SS &quot;British Admiral&quot; on 23 May 1874. A memorial to this effect – giving a birthdate of 1834 – is in the churchyard at Plumtree.

Francis William Douglas (1874–1953), the Acting Resident for Brunei and Labuan from November 1913 to January 1915 in a letter to the Foreign Office on 19 July 1915 stated that he heard from Pengiran Anak Hashima that Brooke had been married to her aunt Pengiran Fatima, the daughter of Pengiran Anak Abdul Kadir and also the granddaughter of Muhammad Kanzul Alam, the 21st Sultan of Brunei. Douglas goes on to say that he had met Dr Ogilvie who told him that he had met a daughter of Rajah Brooke&#x27;s in 1866: she was married but &quot;evidently had foreign blood in her.&quot;

==Succession, death and burial==
Having no legitimate children, in 1861 he formally named his nephew, Captain John Brooke Johnson Brooke, as his successor. Two years later, the Rajah reacted to criticism by returning to the East: after a brief meeting in Singapore, John was deposed and banished from Sarawak. James increased the charges to treasonous conduct and later named John&#x27;s younger brother, Charles Anthoni Johnson Brooke, as his successor.

Brooke died in Burrator, Dartmoor, Devon, in south-west England, on 11 June 1868, having suffered three strokes during his last ten years, and was buried at the graveyard of St Leonard&#x27;s Church in Sheepstor.

==In popular culture==
Fictionalised accounts of Brooke&#x27;s exploits in Sarawak include &quot;Kalimantaan&quot; by C.S. Godshalk and &quot;The White Rajah&quot; by Nicholas Monsarrat. Another book, also called &quot;The White Rajah&quot;, by Tom Williams, was published by JMS Books in 2010. Brooke is also featured in &quot;Flashman&#x27;s Lady&quot;, the 6th book in George MacDonald Fraser&#x27;s meticulously researched &quot;The Flashman Papers&quot; novels. 

James Brooke is the main antagonist in the second and third novels of Emilio Salgari&#x27;s Sandokan series. In the 1976 TV production he&#x27;s played by Adolfo Celi.

Brooke was also a model for the hero of Joseph Conrad&#x27;s novel &quot;Lord Jim&quot;, and he is briefly mentioned in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s short story &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot;.

Charles Kingsley dedicated the novel &quot;Westward Ho!&quot; (1855) to Brooke.

In 1936, Errol Flynn intended to star in a film of Brooke&#x27;s life called &quot;The White Rajah&quot; for Warner Bros., based on a script by Flynn himself. However, although the project was announced for filming, it was never made.

In September 2016, a film based on Brooke&#x27;s life was to be made in Sarawak with the support of Abang Abdul Rahman Johari of the Government of Sarawak, with writer Rob Allyn and Sergei Bodrov as its director. The Brooke Heritage Trust, a non-profit organisation, was to serve as the film&#x27;s technical advisors, with one of them being Jason Brooke, the current heir of the Brooke family. The film, titled &quot;Edge of the World&quot;, directed by Michael Haussman, was released in 2021.

===Places named after Brooke===
In 1857, the native village of Newash in Grey County, Ontario, Canada, was renamed Brooke and the adjacent township was named Sarawak by William Coutts Keppel (known as Viscount Bury, later the 7th Earl of Albemarle) who was Superintendent of Indian Affairs in Canada. James Brooke was a close friend of Viscount Bury&#x27;s uncle, Henry Keppel having met in 1843 while fighting pirates off the coast of Borneo. Townships to the northwest of Sarawak were named Keppel and Albemarle. In 2001, Sarawak and Keppel became part of the township of Georgian Bluffs; Albemarle joined the town of South Bruce Peninsula in 1999. Keppel-Sarawak School is located in Owen Sound, Ontario.

Brooke&#x27;s Point, a major municipality on the island of Palawan, Philippines, is named after him. Both Brooke&#x27;s Lighthouse and Brooke&#x27;s Port are historical landmarks in Brooke&#x27;s Point and are believed to have been constructed by James Brooke. Today, owing to erosion and the constant movement of the tides, only a few stones can still be seen at the Port. The remnants of the original lighthouse tower are still visible, although the area now has a new lighthouse.

:a.The term &quot;Rajah&quot; reflects traditional usage in Sarawak and English writing, although &quot;Raja&quot; may be better orthography in Malay.

<doc id="162749" wikidata="Q332020" url="?curid=162749" title="César Gaviria">
<text>César Augusto Gaviria Trujillo ( ; born 31 March 1947) is a Colombian economist and politician who served as the President of Colombia from 1990 to 1994, Secretary General of the Organization of American States from 1994 to 2004 and National Director of the Colombian Liberal Party from 2005 to 2009. During his tenure as president, he summoned the Constituent Assembly of Colombia that enacted the Constitution of 1991.

==Early life and education ==
Born in Pereira, the Gaviria family had been important figures in Colombian politics and economy for over 30 years. César Gaviria is the distant cousin of José Narces Gaviria, the CEO of Bancolombia from 1988 to 1997. José N. Gaviria encouraged César Gaviria to run for the Congress of Colombia in early childhood. He was first elected to Congress in 1974. He served in Virgilio Barco&#x27;s government, first as Minister of Finance and later as the Minister of the Interior.

As a student, Gaviria spent a year as an exchange student in the United States with AFS Intercultural Programs.

Before entering politics, he studied at the University of the Andes in the 1960s. He established AIESEC there, and then in 1968 was elected President of AIESEC in Colombia. This began his public service career.

==Political career==
At 23, he was elected councilman in his hometown of Pereira, and four years later he became the city&#x27;s mayor. In 1974 he was elected to the Chamber of Representatives, of which he was president of in 1984–85. Three years later he became co-chair of the Colombian Liberal Party.

He was the debate chief of Luis Carlos Galán, during Galán&#x27;s 1989 presidential campaign, which was cut short by Galán&#x27;s assassination on 18 August. Recently promoted to his campaign manager, Gaviria was proclaimed as Galán&#x27;s political successor by his son, Juan Manuel Galán. His two main competitors were Hernando Durán Dussán, backed by regional party leaders, and Ernesto Samper. His campaign was also the target of attacks by Pablo Escobar; Gaviria was to take Avianca Flight 203, bound for Cali. For security reasons he did not board the flight. The plane, with 107 people aboard, exploded, killing everyone on board. Despite these challenges, he was nominated as the Liberal presidential candidate, receiving 60% of the vote against Samper&#x27;s 18.5% and Durán&#x27;s 14.4%.

===Presidency===
In 1990, he was elected President of Colombia, running as a Liberal Party candidate. During his government a new constitution was adopted in 1991. As president, Gaviria also led the fight against the Medellín and Cali drug cartels, and various guerrilla factions.

Under his presidency, the prison La Catedral was built, but to Pablo Escobar&#x27;s specifications. When Escobar was imprisoned there, he continued to control his drug empire; he also murdered several of his rivals inside the prison. On 20 July 1992, Escobar escaped after learning that he was going to be moved to a different prison. On 2 December 1993, the notorious drug lord was gunned down. His death was a triumph for the Gaviria administration.
Despite stable economic growth and foreign investment, 45 per cent of Colombians lived below the poverty line (particularly in rural areas) and slums were growing around major cities. Created by drug traffickers and supported by the army (President Gaviria said he saw them as a &quot;possible solution&quot;), paramilitary groups (&quot;autodefensas&quot;) were often engaged in fighting the country&#x27;s various guerrilla factions. In cities, these groups carried out social cleaning missions. Tramps, marginalized people, street children and homosexuals were murdered by these groups. Many judges, several senators, priests, and even the head of the national police have been convicted of links with traffickers.

His government created the &quot;Convivir&quot; in 1994, which was supposed to help the army predict the activities of insurgent groups through a network of informers. However, according to journalist Hernando Calvo Ospina, &quot;the reality has shown that the Convivir have legalized networks of hired killers in the service of drug traffickers and landowners, while having as their main objective the use of the civilian population as a cover for the paramilitary movement.&quot;

===Secretary General of the OAS===

In 1994, Gaviria was elected Secretary General of the OAS (his term beginning after the end of his presidential term in August 1994). Reelected in 1999, he worked extensively on behalf of Latin America. Between October 2002 and May 2003, he served as international facilitator of the OAS mesa process, aimed at finding a solution to the internal Venezuelan political crisis between President Hugo Chávez and the Coordinadora Democrática opposition.

===President===
Gaviria was proclaimed the sole chief of the Liberal Party in June 2005. On 27 April 2006, his sister Liliana Gaviria was killed by unknown gunmen.
His son, Simón Gaviria, led the Liberal Party between 2011 and 2014 and then served as national director of planning under the government of Juan Manuel Santos from 2014 to 2017. César Gaviria then took over the leadership of the party. He supported Iván Duque&#x27;s candidacy for the 2018 presidential election, which Duque won. 

Gaviria is a member of the Club of Madrid, an independent non-profit organization created to promote democracy and change in the international community, composed by more than 100 members: former democratic Heads of State and Government from around the world.

===Pandora Papers===
In October 2021, his name was mentioned in the Pandora Papers as the owner of a company located in Panama, a country considered a tax haven, through which he acquired Colombian companies.

==In popular culture==
* In the television series. &quot;El cartel&quot;, he is referred to as &quot;NFrancisco Buendía&quot;&#x27;
* Gaviria is portrayed by the Colombian actor Fabián Mendoza in the television series &quot;Escobar, el Patrón del Mal&quot;.
* In the television series &quot;Tres Caínes&quot;, he is portrayed by the Colombian actor Mario Ruiz as the character of Germán Giraldo.

<doc id="162757" wikidata="Q7575482" url="?curid=162757" title="Speed Graphic">
<text>The Speed Graphic was a press camera produced by Graflex in Rochester, New York. Although the first Speed Graphic cameras were produced in 1912, production of later versions continued until 1973; with significant improvements occurring in 1947 with the introduction of the Pacemaker Speed Graphic (and Pacemaker Crown Graphic, which was lighter and lacked the focal plane shutter).

==Description==
Despite the common appellation of &quot;Speed Graphic&quot;, various Graphic models were produced between 1912 and 1973. The authentic Speed Graphic has a focal plane shutter that the Crown Graphic and Century Graphic models lack. The eponymous name &quot;speed&quot; came from the maximum speed of 1/1000 sec. that could be achieved with the focal plane shutter. The Speed Graphic was available in 2¼ × 3¼ inch, 3¼ × 4¼ inch, 5 × 7 inch and the most common format 4 × 5 inch. Because of the focal plane shutter, the Speed Graphic can also use lenses that do not have shutters (known as barrel lenses).

Using a Speed Graphic, especially with the rear shutter system, was a slow process. Setting the focal plane shutter speed required selecting both a slit width and a spring tension. Each exposure required the photographer to change the film holder, open the lens shutter, cock the focal plane shutter, remove the dark slide from the inserted film holder, focus the camera, and release the focal plane shutter. Conversely, if the lens shutter were used, the focal plane shutter (on the Speed Graphic and Pacemaker Graphic models with both shutters) had to be opened prior to cocking using the &quot;T&quot; or TIME setting, and then releasing the shutter in the lens. If indoors, the photographer also had to change the flashbulb. Each film holder contained one or two pieces of sheet film, which the photographer had to load in complete darkness. Faster shooting could be achieved with the Grafmatic film holder—a six sheet film &quot;changer&quot; that holds each sheet in a septum. Even faster exposures could be taken if the photographer was shooting film packs of 12 exposures, or later 16 exposures (discontinued in the late 1970s). With film packs one could shoot as fast as one could pull the tab and cock the shutter, and film packs could be loaded in daylight. A roll film adapter that used 120 or 220 film was available for 2.25 × 3.25, 3.25 × 4.25 and 4 × 5 inch cameras that permitted 8 to 20 exposures per roll, depending on the model of the adapter. Photographers had to be conservative and anticipate when the action was about to take place to take the right picture. The cry, &quot;Just one more!&quot; if a shot was missed was common. President Harry Truman introduced the White House photographers as the &quot;Just One More Club.&quot;

===Operation of the focal plane shutter===
The focal plane shutter consists of a rubberized flexible curtain with slits of varying widths that cross the film plane at speeds determined by the tension setting of the spring mechanism. There are 4 slits with widths of 1/8 in, 3/8 in, 3/4 in, 1 1/2 in and “T” (T = “time” setting, used when lens diaphragm shutter is used to control exposure duration. The focal plane shutter is left completely open until manually released. The opening covers the entire area of the film for the size of the camera.) On Speed Graphic models, there are 6 tension settings, adjusted by a butterfly winding knob that increases the speed that the slit crosses the film plane. On Pacemaker Graphic models, there are only 2 settings (high and low). The combination of the slit width and the spring tension allows for exposure speeds varying from 1/10 to 1/1000 sec.

==Famous users==
A famous Speed Graphic user was New York City press photographer Arthur &quot;Weegee&quot; Fellig, who covered the city in the 1930s and 1940s.

Barbara Morgan used a Speed Graphic to photograph Martha Graham&#x27;s choreography.

Recent auctions show Irving Klaw used one in his studio for his iconic pin up &amp; bondage photos of models such as Bettie Page.

In the 1950s and 1960s, the iconic photo-journalists of the Washington Post and the former Washington Evening Star shot on Speed Graphics exclusively. Some of the most famous photographs of this era were taken on the device by the twin brothers, Frank P. Hoy (for the Post) and Tom Hoy (for the Star).

The 1942-1953 Pulitzer Prizes for photography were taken with Speed Graphic cameras, including AP photographer Joe Rosenthal&#x27;s image of Marines raising the American flag on Iwo Jima in 1945. A few winning photographs after 1954 were taken with Rolleiflex or Kodak cameras. 1961 was the last Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph with a Speed Graphic, which taken by Yasushi Nagao showing Otoya Yamaguchi assassinating Inejiro Asanuma on stage.

In 2004, American photojournalist David Burnett used his 4×5 inch Speed Graphic with a 178 mm f/2.5 Aero Ektar lens removed from a K-21 aerial camera to cover John Kerry&#x27;s presidential campaign.
Burnett also used a 4×5 inch Speed Graphic to shoot images at the Winter and Summer Olympics.

==Graflex manufacturing history==
The company name changed several times over the years as it was acquired and later spun off by the Eastman Kodak Company, finally becoming a division of the Singer Corporation and then dissolved in 1973. The award-winning Graflex plant in Pittsford, New York is still standing and is home to Veramark Technologies, Inc., formerly known as the MOSCOM Corporation.

==Graflex model history==

The Speed Graphic was
manufactured in a number of sizes, 4×5&quot; being the most common, but
also in 2.25×3.25&quot;, 3.25×4.25&quot; and 5×7&quot;.

<doc id="162758" wikidata="Q819968" url="?curid=162758" title="Imperial County of Reuss">
<text>Reuss ( ) was the name of several historical states located in present-day Thuringia, Germany. Several lordships of the Holy Roman Empire which arose after 1300 and became Imperial Counties from 1673 and Imperial Principalities in the late 18th century were ruled by the House of Reuss.

A varying number of these counties came into being by partition; they were partially merged and divided again. After the end of the empire in 1806, the principality of the elder line, as well as several of the younger, became sovereign member states of the German Confederation, with the younger ones merging into a unified principality by 1848. The two remaining territories became federal principalities of the German Empire in 1871, the Principality of Reuss Elder Line with the state capital of Greiz and the Principality of Reuss Younger Line with the state capital of Gera. Both states were ruled by the House of Reuss until the German Revolution of 1918–1919. The head of each branch bore the German title &quot;Fürst&quot; (Prince, as head of a princely house) while their children and all other members of the house bore the title &quot;Prinz/Prinzessin&quot; (Prince/Princess, as agnate members of a princely house).

Since the end of the 12th century, all male members of the House of Reuss are named &quot;Heinrich&quot; (), in honour of Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor (1190–1197), to whom they owed the dominions of Weida and Gera. For the purpose of differentiation, they are given order numbers according to certain systems (see below, section &quot;Numbering of the Heinrichs&quot;), and in private life they are distinguished by nicknames.

==History of the various states==
Several different principalities of the House of Reuss which had previously existed had by the time of the formation of the German Confederation become part of the two remaining lines (the Elder and the Younger lines). Before then, they had been part first of the Holy Roman Empire, and then the Confederation of the Rhine.

===Origins===
The region including what would become the Principality of Reuss was inhabited in early medieval times by Slavic people who were converted to Christianity by the German Emperor Otto I (936–973). In church matters the region was under the Diocese of Zeitz (founded in 968), which became a suffragan of Magdeburg. On account of the frequent inroads of the Slavs, the residence of the Bishop of Zeitz was removed to Naumburg in 1028, after which the See was called Naumburg-Zeitz.

Upon its subjection to German authority, the whole province was allotted to the March of Zeitz. As early as the year 1000, however, Emperor Otto III permitted the entire part lying on the eastern boundary of Thuringia, a wooded area, sparsely populated by the West Slavic people of the Sorbs, to be cleared for farmland and settled by German settlers. Emperor Henry IV appointed Henry the Pious of Gleissberg (c. 1040−1120) imperial vogt, or bailiff (&quot;advocatus imperii&quot;) of this settlement area, under the rule of the imperial Quedlinburg Abbey. He was a son of Erkenbert I of Weida, the oldest known ancestor of the family, who is mentioned in 1122 in the entourage of Count Adalbert of Everstein at the consecration of St John&#x27;s church in Plauen. The name of the area Heinrich controlled derives from his office: Vogtland (&quot;Terra advocatorum&quot;, Land of the Bailiff). This designation has remained to this day a geographical summary for a region of 3,467 km2 (comparable roughly to the county of Essex) which is located in Saxony, Thuringia and, to a lesser extent, in northern Bavaria.

=== The House of the &quot;Vogts&quot; (Bailiffs) ===
The position of &quot;vogt&quot; soon became hereditary. While the dominions of Heinrich von Gleissberg included the towns Gera and Weida, his grandson Henry II the Rich (d. before 1209) also acquired Plauen. When his three sons divided their inheritance, three independent areas emerged, ruled by the branches of the bailiffs of Weida-Ronneburg, Plauen-Gera and Greiz-Reichenbach. The bailiffs, initially unfree nobles &quot;(Ministerialis)&quot;, quickly rose to the rank of lords. After the division, the official title &quot;Vogt&quot; was carried on by all branches and passed on like a hereditary imperial fiefdom. When the bailiffs negotiated a treaty with Henry III, Margrave of Meissen in 1254, they acted as equal partners. In 1329 Emperor Ludwig the Bavarian confirmed the bailiffs a rank equal to Princes of the Holy Roman Empire, albeit without the title itself, they continued to use the designation &quot;Vogt&quot;.

In the 12th and 13th centuries, the bailiffs of Weida gradually became independent of the Quedlinburg Abbey on the lands they administered. Their area included what is generally understood today as Vogtland. Over time the dominions of the bailiffs extended beyond the Vogtland into the Western Ore Mountains, with areas extending into what is now the Czech Republic.

The Weida branch was extinct in 1535, the branch of Greiz-Reichenbach was soon inherited by the branch of Plauen-Gera which then divided into Plauen (elder and younger line) and Gera-Schleiz-Lobenstein (extinct in 1550). The elder Plauen line of the vogts was extinct in 1380, the founder of the younger Plauen line was Henry (d. about 1300), who on account of his stay in Eastern European regions and his marriage with a granddaughter of King Daniel of Galicia received the surname of &quot;der Reusse&quot; (Ruthenus, a term for the Kievan Rus&#x27;), whence the name later passed to his country. His descendants were styled &quot;Lords Reuss of Plauen, Greiz and Gera&quot;. The House of Reuss is thus descended from the vogts of Plauen from whom they inherited the cities and lordships of Gera, Greiz, Schleiz and Lobenstein. However, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the vogts had lost the greater part of their possessions, most of which fell to the Electorate of Saxony, including Weida in 1427 and Plauen in 1482.

===House of Reuss===
In 1306 the Plauen branch of the vogts was subdivided into an elder line (at Plauen) that died out around 1380, and a younger line (at Greiz and Reichenbach), called &quot;Reuss&quot;. In 1564 the latter was subdivided into three branches, the Elder (extinct in 1927), the Middle (extinct in 1616), and the Younger (of which the ruling line became extinct in 1945) and a side line, split off in 1692, Reuss-Köstritz, which had been raised to (however non-ruling) princes in 1806, still exists with about 30 male relatives, all named &quot;Heinrich&quot;, as the last surviving branch of the family, with the senior of this branch, the Prince Reuss-Köstritz, as head of the entire house, hence now &quot;The Fürst Reuss&quot;, while the others hold the agnatic title of prince.

In 1673 the Lords Reuss were raised to Imperial Counts and (depending on the line) from 1778 (1790 or 1802) to Imperial Princes. The dynasty ruled divided areas in various lines and sub-lines; around 1700 there were ten Reussian counties of both main branches. The lords, counts and princes were never styled &quot;of&quot; Reuss, but rather count or &quot;prince Reuss&quot;, as Reuss was originally not the name of a town or castle, but rather a personal designation for the founder of the branch that indicated his foreign connection through marriage (&quot;Reussen&quot; is in fact an older German term for &quot;Russians&quot;), and the family is still referred to today in the plural as &quot;die Reussen&quot;.

On account of the close relations of Reuss with the neighbouring Saxon states, Lutheranism speedily gained a foothold in Reuss. The rulers joined the Schmalkaldic League against the German emperor, and forfeited their possessions, but afterwards recovered them.

===Numbering of the Heinrichs===

All the males of the House of Reuss are named Heinrich (Henry) plus a number.

In the elder line the numbering covers all male children of the elder House, and the numbers increase until 100 is reached and then start again at 1.

In the younger line the system is similar but the numbers increase until the end of the century before starting again at 1.

This odd regulation was formulated as a Family Law in 1688, but the tradition of the uniformity of name was in practice as early as 1200. It was seen as a way of honoring the Hohenstaufen Emperor Heinrich/Henry VI, who raised Heinrich der Reiche/Henry the Rich (+1209) to the office of provost of the Quedlinburg Abbey, thus taking on the title of &quot;vogt&quot;.

===Main partition===

In 1564 the sons of Henry XIII of Reuss at Greiz divided the estates into
*Reuss at Lower Greiz, descendants of Henry XIV the Elder
*Reuss at Upper Greiz, descendants of Henry XV the Middle
*Reuss at Gera, descendants of Henry XVI the Younger.
While the Middle Reuss became extinct in 1616, the Older and Younger lines were divided again several times until in 1778 Count Henry XI united the possessions of Upper and Lower Greiz to the Principality of Reuss Elder Line. In return the remaining estates of Gera, considerably larger though, became the Principality of Reuss Younger Line in 1806. The two remaining Reuss principalities joined the German Confederation in 1815. Several subdivisions of the Younger Line merged into a unified state by 1848.

Henry XXII of Reuss Elder line is notable among the modern princes of this house for his enmity to Prussia, which he opposed in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, when the Prussian troops occupied his domain. Henry joined the North German Confederation and the new German Empire in 1871. He alone of all the confederate princes remained until his death in 1902 an implacable enemy of Prince Bismarck and of the conditions created in Germany by the foundation of the empire. Despite his views, his daughter Hermine Reuss of Greiz later became the second wife of the exiled German Emperor Wilhelm II. Other daughters of the house also made important marriages: Countess Augusta Reuss of Ebersdorf, by marriage the Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, was the maternal grandmother of Queen Victoria and the paternal grandmother of Albert, Prince Consort. Princess Augusta Reuss of Köstritz married the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in 1849 and Eleonore Reuss of Köstritz became queen consort of Bulgaria in 1908.

Heinrich XXIV, Prince Reuss of Greiz (1878–1927), was incapable of ruling and therefore the regency passed to the ruling prince of the younger line of Reuss. Since the childless Heinrich XXIV was the last of his line, it was to be expected that the principality of the elder line would fall to the younger line after his death, and that a united state of Reuss would emerge as a result. However, both lines lost their thrones in the German Revolution of 1918–19 and a united, albeit republican state, the People&#x27;s State of Reuss, emerged in 1919, only to merge with the larger state of Thuringia in 1920. The unified state of Reuss had a non-contiguous area of 1,143 square kilometers and 211,324 inhabitants (1919).

A (non-governing) side branch of the younger line had emerged in 1692 when Heinrich XXIV, Count Reuss of Köstritz, a younger son of the ruling count Heinrich I. Reuss of Schleiz, received a number of landed estates as a paréage within his eldest brother&#x27;s county, with his main seat at Köstritz Castle. This branch connected through marriages with important ruling houses, did however not govern their own territory, but lived as landowners in the county of the Schleiz Line. Henry XLIII., count Reuss of Köstritz, was elevated to hereditary Fürst (prince) by Emperor Francis II in 1806 (however without governmental power); the paréage of Köstritz remained within the principality of the younger line.

When the elder line died out with Heinrich XXIV in 1927 and the younger one when Heinrich XLV, son of the last ruler, died childless in 1945 as a prisoner of the communists, thus both main branches having become extinct, the dynastic succession (and the theoretical claims to their thrones) passed to the princely House &quot;Reuss of Köstritz&quot;. This side line of the Younger Line is therefore the only branch of the entire house that still exists today, but has over 30 male members, all named Heinrich. The family council decided on June 5, 1930, that all members of the remaining family should henceforth omit any line addition (Younger Line or Köstritz) from their names and call themselves &quot;Prince&quot; or &quot;Princess Reuss&quot;. This name (as well as the Heinrichs&#x27; count) was retained by a court order even in the Weimar republic. The current head of the family, Heinrich XIV, dynastic actually &quot;the Fürst (Prince) Reuss of Köstritz&quot; (b. 1952), is also styled &quot;The Fürst (Prince) Reuss&quot;, as Köstritz is no longer a side line but the only branch of the house. His main seat is Ernstbrunn Castle in Austria which his family had inherited in 1822, while Köstritz Castle was expropriated by communist East Germany in 1945 and demolished in the 1970s. In 1945, the Princes Reuss lost all of their extended possessions and castles in their ancestral homeland through expropriation. Heinrich XIV and some of his relatives regained some properties in the former Reuss states following German Reunification in 1990.

===Aftermath===
After World War I, the Reuss territories were unified in 1919 as the People&#x27;s State of Reuss, which was incorporated into the new state of Thuringia in 1920.

== Side branch member&#x27;s links to Reichsbürger movement ==
On 7 December 2022, German police conducted an operation which resulted in the arrest of 25 alleged members of the far-right group Reichsbürger, including a member of the Köstritz branch of the House of Reuss, identified as Heinrich XIII Prince Reuss. The suspects arrested in the operation were allegedly planning to overturn the existing German government, and instate Heinrich XIII as the new German &quot;de facto&quot; leader. His distant cousin Heinrich XIV Prince Reuss, the head and speaker of the House of Reuss and its family association, had previously referred to Heinrich XIII as &quot;a confused old man who had been radicalised through disappointments&quot;. On behalf of the family association, which Heinrich XIII had left years ago, Heinrich XIV sharply distanced himself from him again after he was arrested, saying that &quot;30 years ago he was a modern businessman, but nowadays he is fooled by all sorts of conspiracy theories&quot;. In the line of succession to the House of Reuss, Heinrich XIII only ranked 17th, and the head of the house called him &quot;a marginal figure&quot;. He said his behaviour was a &quot;catastrophe&quot; for the family, whose heritage as tolerant and cosmopolitan rulers was now associated with &quot;terrorists and reactionaries&quot;. He believes Reuss&#x27; anti-government views derive from his resentment at the German judicial system for its failure to recognize his claims to family properties expropriated at the end of World War II.

==In fiction==
A young Reuss count, sent to the 1815 Congress of Vienna, is the protagonist of the 1899 operetta &quot;Wiener Blut&quot; and the 1942 film based on it. Much of the hilarity of the film centers around his impossible name of &quot;Reuss-Schleiz-Greiz&quot;.

<text>The Nevada National Security Sites (N2S2 or NNSS), popularized as the Nevada Test Site (NTS) until 2010, is a reservation of the United States Department of Energy located in the southeastern portion of Nye County, Nevada, about northwest of the city of Las Vegas. 

Formerly known as the Nevada Proving Grounds of the United States Army, the site was acquired in 1951 to be the testing venue for the American nuclear devices. The first atmospheric test was conducted at the site&#x27;s Frenchman Flat area by the United States Atomic Energy Commission (USAEC) on January 27, 1951. About 928 nuclear tests were conducted here through 1994, when the United States stopped its underground nuclear testing. 

The site consists of about of desert and mountainous terrain. Some 1,100 buildings in 28 areas are connected by of paved roads, of unpaved roads, ten heliports, and two airstrips. The site is privately managed and operated by Mission Support and Test Services LLC, a joint venture of Honeywell, Jacobs, and Huntington Ingalls, on behalf of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). 

The mushroom clouds from the 100 atmospheric tests were visible from almost away; they could be seen from the Las Vegas Strip in the early 1950s. Many iconic images at nuclear science museums throughout the United States come from the site. Las Vegas experienced noticeable seismic effects. Westerly winds routinely carried the fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests, increasing cancer in Utah and elsewhere, according to a 1984 medical report. 

The site has hosted 536 publicized and organized anti-nuclear protests, with 37,488 participants and 15,740 involved in arrests, according to government records.

==History==

The site was established as a area by President Harry S. Truman on December 18, 1950, within the Nellis Air Force Gunnery and Bombing Range.

===1951–1992===
The site was the primary testing location of American nuclear devices from 1951 to 1992; 928 announced nuclear tests occurred there. Of those, 828 were underground&lt;ref name=&quot;DOE/NV-209&quot;&gt;U.S. Department of Energy / Nevada Operations Office, &quot;United States Nuclear Tests – July 1945 through September 1992&quot;, December 2000, DOE/NV-209 Rev 15 &lt;/ref&gt; (62 of the underground tests included multiple, simultaneous nuclear detonations, adding 93 detonations and bringing the total number of NTS nuclear detonations to 1,021, of which 921 were underground). The site contains many subsidence craters from the testing.

The site was the United States&#x27; primary location for tests smaller than . One hundred twenty-six tests were conducted elsewhere, including most larger tests. Many of these occurred at the Pacific Proving Grounds in the Marshall Islands.
During the 1950s, the mushroom clouds from atmospheric tests could be seen for almost . The city of Las Vegas experienced noticeable seismic effects, and the distant mushroom clouds, which could be seen from the downtown hotels, became tourist attractions. The last atmospheric test detonation at the site was &quot;Little Feller I&quot; of Operation Sunbeam, on July 17, 1962.

Although the United States did not ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, it honors the articles of the treaty, and underground testing of weapons ended as of September 23, 1992. Subcritical tests not involving a critical mass continued.
One notable test shot was the &quot;Sedan&quot; shot of Operation Storax on July 6, 1962, a shot for Operation Plowshare, which sought to prove that nuclear weapons could be used for peaceful means in creating bays or canals. It created a crater 1,280 feet (390 m) wide and 320 feet (100 m) deep.

===1992–present===
More than 27 subcritical tests have been conducted at the site.

In 2018, the State of Nevada sued the federal government to block a plan to ship &quot;more than a metric ton&quot; of plutonium to the site for temporary storage.

In 2022, the government acknowledged that 13,625 cubic meters of radioactive material conforming to its disposal criteria had been shipped to the site for disposal.

==Destruction and survivability testing==
 Testing of the various effects of detonation of nuclear weapons was carried out during above-ground tests. Many kinds of vehicles (ranging from cars to aircraft), nuclear-fallout and standard bomb-shelters, public-utility stations and other building structures and equipment were placed at measured distances away from &quot;ground zero&quot;, the spot on the surface immediately under or over the center of the blast. Operation Cue tested civil defense measures. Such civilian and commercial effects testing was done with many of the atomic tests of Operation Greenhouse on Eniwetok Atoll, Operation Upshot-Knothole and Operation Teapot at the site.

Homes and commercial buildings of many different types and styles were built to standards typical of American and (less-often) European cities. Other such structures included military fortifications (of types used by both NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact) and civil-defense as well as &quot;backyard&quot;-type shelters. In such a typical test, several of the same buildings and structures might be built using the same layouts and plans with different types of materials, paints, general landscaping, cleanliness of the surrounding yards, wall-angles or varying distances from ground zero. Mannequins were placed in and around the test vehicles and buildings, aside from some left out in the open, for testing clothing and shock effects.

High-speed cameras were placed in protected locations to capture effects of radiation and shock waves. Typical imagery from these cameras shows paint boiling off the buildings, which are then pushed violently away from ground zero by the shock wave before being drawn toward the detonation by the suction caused by the climbing mushroom cloud. Footage from these cameras has become iconic, used in various media and available in the public domain.

This testing allowed the development of Civil Defense guidelines, distributed to the public, to increase the likelihood of survival in case of air- or spaceborne nuclear attack.

==Environmental impact==
Each of the below-ground explosions—some as deep as 5,000 feet (1.5 km)—vaporized a large chamber, leaving a cavity filled with radioactive rubble. About a third of the tests were conducted directly in aquifers, and others were hundreds or thousands of feet below the water table.

When underground explosions ended in 1992, the Department of Energy estimated that more than of radioactivity remained in the environment at that time, making the site one of the most contaminated locations in the United States. In the most seriously affected zones, the concentration of radioactivity in groundwater reaches millions of picocuries per liter. (The federal standard for drinking water is 20 picocuries per liter (0.74 Bq/L).) Although radioactivity levels in the water continue to decline over time, the longer-lived isotopes like plutonium or uranium could pose risks for thousands of years.

The Department of Energy has more than 48 monitoring wells at the site. Because the contaminated water poses no immediate health threat, the department ranked the site as low priority for clean-up. In 2009, tritium with a half-life of 12.3 years was first detected in groundwater off-site in Pahute Mesa, near the locations of the 1968 Benham and 1975 Tybo tests.

The DOE issues an annual environmental monitoring report containing data from the monitoring wells both on and off site.

Janice C. Beatley started to study the botany of the Nevada test site in 1962 when she created 68 study sites. The intention had been to study the effect of radiation on the plants but this plan had to be changed when the United States abandoned atmospheric testing in 1963. The sites however became important because they recorded long term change through 1980. Much of her data was never published; however it was all transferred to the United States Geological Survey after her death. It was &quot;an ideal place to conduct long-term ecosystem research.&quot;

==Protests and demonstrations==

In 1983, four Greenpeace activists made the first incursion into the site of an active test. Two American men, one from West Germany and one from the United Kingdom hiked 30 miles on foot to hide in the desert near ground zero at Yucca Flats. The four evaded capture for a week with the stated objective of delaying the test, and were charged with trespassing. 

From 1986 through 1994, two years after the United States ended nuclear weapons testing, 536 demonstrations were held at the site involving 37,488 participants and 15,740 arrests, according to government records.

In 1986, a coalition of organizations including Greenpeace sent protestors into Frenchman&#x27;s Flat 
From 1986 through 1994, two years after the United States ended nuclear weapons testing, 536 demonstrations were held at the site involving 37,488 participants and 15,740 arrests, according to government records.

On February 5, 1987, more than 400 people were arrested trying to enter the site after nearly 2,000 demonstrators held a rally to protest nuclear weapons testing. Those arrested included the astronomer Carl Sagan and the actors Kris Kristofferson, Martin Sheen, and Robert Blake. Five Democratic members of Congress attended the rally: Thomas J. Downey, Mike Lowry, Jim Bates, Leon E. Panetta, and Barbara Boxer.

American Peace Test (APT) and Nevada Desert Experience (NDE) held most of these. In March 1988, APT held an event where more than 8,000 people attended a ten-day action to &quot;Reclaim the Test Site&quot;, where nearly 3,000 people were arrested, including more than 1,200 in one day. This set a record for most civil disobedience arrests in a single protest.

On October 12, 1992, an 11-day protest took place at the Test Site. At the invitation of the Western Shoshone Tribe and Corbin Harney, an anti-nuclear activist and spiritual leader for the Newe people, over 2000 protesters from 12 different countries gathered for &quot;Healing Global Wounds&quot;. In their media work, protesters and organizers demanded an end to nuclear weapons testing and return of the test site to the Western Shoshone people. Camped in the desert, participants took part in anti-racism and peaceful civil disobedience trainings. They planned actions and demonstrations, eventually using culverts and other means to enter the Test Site where 530 were arrested by Wackenhut Security forces on charges of trespassing. Full-scale nuclear weapons testing did not resume.
After 1994, Shundahai Network in cooperation with Nevada Desert Experience and Corbin Harney continued the protests of the work at the site and staged efforts to stop a repository for highly radioactive waste adjacent to the test site at nearby Yucca Mountain.

==Modern usage==

The site continues to be used for nuclear weapons research and development. This includes subcritical testing. These tests are conducted jointly by Los Alamos National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and the British Atomic Weapons Establishment. A recent one was &quot;Ediza&quot; (2019), and &quot;Nightshade A&quot; (2020).

The site offers monthly public tours, often booked months in advance. Visitors are not allowed to bring cameras, binoculars, or cell phones, nor are they permitted to pick up rocks for souvenirs.

While there are no longer any explosive tests of nuclear weapons at the site, there is still testing done to determine the viability of the United States&#x27; aging nuclear arsenal. Additionally, the site is the location of the Area 5 Radioactive Waste Management Complex, which sorts and stores low-level radioactive waste that is not transuranic and has a half life of less than 20 years.

The Radiological/Nuclear WMD Incident Exercise Site (T-1) replicates multiple terrorist radiological incidents with train, plane, automobile, truck, and helicopter props. It is located in Area 1, at the former site of tests EASY, SIMON, APPLE-2, and GALILEO.

==Landmarks and geography==

A table of interesting places in and around the NNSS is presented here, which corresponds with many of the descriptions in the Nevada Test Site Guide.

==Cancer and test site==
Many communities east of the Nevada Test Site, including Cedar City, Enterprise, and St. George, Utah, received fallout from above-ground nuclear testing in the Yucca Flats at the site. Winds routinely carried the fallout of these tests directly through St. George and southern Utah. Marked increases in cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, bone cancer, brain tumors, and gastrointestinal tract cancers were reported from the mid-1950s through 1980.

On May 19, 1953, the 32-kiloton (130 TJ) atomic bomb (nicknamed &quot;Harry&quot;) was detonated at the site. The bomb later gained the name &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; because of the amount of off-site fallout generated by the bomb.

A 1962 United States Atomic Energy Commission report found that &quot;children living in St. George, Utah may have received doses to the thyroid of radioiodine as high as 120 to 440 rads&quot; (1.2 to 4.4 Gy). A 1979 study reported in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; concluded that:

A significant excess of leukemia deaths occurred in children up to 14 years of age living in Utah between 1959 and 1967. This excess was concentrated in the cohort of children born between 1951 and 1958, and was most pronounced in those residing in counties receiving high fallout.

In 1982, a lawsuit brought by nearly 1,200 people accused the government of negligence in atomic and/or nuclear weapons testing at the site, which they said had caused leukemia and other cancers. Dr. Karl Z. Morgan, Director of Health Physics at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, testified that radiation protection measures in the tests were substandard to best practices at the time.

In a report by the National Cancer Institute, released in 1997, it was determined that 90 atmospheric tests at the site deposited high levels of radioactive iodine-131 (5.5 exabecquerels) across much of the contiguous United States, especially in the years 1952, 1953, 1955, and 1957doses large enough, it claimed, to produce 10,000 to 75,000 cases of thyroid cancer. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 allowed for people living downwind of the site for at least two years in particular Nevada, Arizona, or Utah counties, between January 21, 1951, and October 31, 1958, or June 30 and July 31, 1962, and suffering from certain cancers or other serious illnesses deemed to have been caused by fallout exposure to receive compensation of $50,000. By 2014, over 28,000 downwinder claims for a total compensation of $1.9 billion had been processed. Additionally, the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 provides compensation and medical benefits for nuclear weapons workers who may have developed certain work-related illnesses.

Uranium miners, mill workers, and ore transporters are also eligible for $100,000 compassionate payment under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Program, while $75,000 is the fixed payment amount for workers who were participants in the above-ground nuclear weapons tests.

== Areas ==

The site is broken down into areas. Some of the areas and their uses include the following:

===Area 1===

Area 1 held eight nuclear tests for a total of nine detonations.
Four early atmospheric tests were conducted above Area 1 in the early 1950s, as well as three underground tests in 1971 and 1990. In 1955, a Civil Defense experiment (called Operation Cue in the press) studied nuclear blast effects on various building types; a few structures still stand.

Heavy drilling equipment and concrete construction facilities are sited in Area 1. Non-destructive X-ray, gamma ray, and subcritical detonation tests continue to be conducted in Area 1.

The radioactivity present on the ground in Area 1 provides a radiologically contaminated environment for the training of first responders.

===Area 2===
Area 2 was the site of 144 tests comprising 169 detonations. A test named &quot;Gabbs&quot; was intended for early 1993 but was cancelled in 1992 due to a pre-emptive halt to testing based on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.

===Area 3===
Area 3 held 266 nuclear tests for a total of 288 detonations, including Upshot-Knothole &#x27;Harry&#x27;, more than in any other area of the site.

As part of Operation Tinderbox, on June 24, 1980, a large satellite prototype (DSCS III) was subjected to radioactivity from the &quot;Huron King&quot; shot in a vertical line-of-sight (VLOS) test undertaken in Area 3. This was a program to improve the database on nuclear hardening design techniques for defense satellites.

The final nuclear test detonation at site was Operation Julin&#x27;s &quot;Divider&quot; on September 23, 1992, just prior to the moratorium ending all nuclear testing. Divider was a safety experiment test shot that was detonated at the bottom of a shaft sunk into Area 3.

In 1995 and 1997, plutonium-contaminated soil from &quot;Double Tracks&quot; and &quot;Clean Slate 1&quot; of Operation Roller Coaster (1963) was picked up from the Tonopah Test Range and brought to the Area 3 Radioactive Waste Management Site as a first step in eventually returning Tonopah Test Range to an environmentally neutral state. Corrective action regarding the contaminated material from the &quot;Clean Slate 2&quot; and &quot;Clean Slate 3&quot; tests has yet to be agreed upon.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOE/NV-1046&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Area 4===

Area 4 held 40 nuclear tests for a total of 44 detonations.

It is home to the Big Explosives Experimental Facility (BEEF).&lt;ref name=&quot;DOE/NV-715&quot;&gt;&quot;Nevada Test Site Guide&quot;, National Nuclear Security Administration, DOE/NV-715 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Area 5===

Area 5 held 19 nuclear tests.
Five atmospheric tests were detonated, starting on January 27, 1951, at Area 5 as part of Operation Ranger. These were the first nuclear tests at the site. Further tower detonations were studied at Area 5, and the &quot;Grable&quot; shot which was fired from a M65 Atomic Cannon located in Area 11 exploded in Area 5. The &quot;Priscilla&quot; test was conducted at Area 5 on June 24, 1957.

Five underground tests were set up at Area 5; four of those included accidental release of radioactive materials. On March 16, 1968, physicist Glenn T. Seaborg toured the upcoming &quot;Milk Shake&quot; shot of Operation Crosstie.
&quot;Milk Shake&quot;″s radioactive release was not detected outside of the site&#x27;s boundaries.

===Area 6===
Area 6 held four nuclear tests for a total of six detonations. The area features an asphalt runway, that was constructed on top of a dirt landing strip, that had existed since the 1950s. Some buildings, including a hangar, are situated near the runway.

The Device Assembly Facility (DAF) was originally built to consolidate nuclear explosives assembly operations. It now serves as the Criticality Experiments Facility (CEF).

The Control Point is the communication hub of the site. It was used by controllers to trigger and monitor nuclear test explosions.

In 1982, while a live nuclear bomb was being lowered underground, the base came under attack by armed combatants. The combatants turned out to be a security team conducting an improperly scheduled drill. 

More recently, an airstrip in Area 6 is in use by the Departments of Defense and Homeland security to test UAV sensors.

===Area 7===
Area 7 held 92 nuclear tests.

During Operation Buster, four successful tests were conducted via airdrop, with bomber aircraft releasing nuclear weapons over Area 7.

Shot &quot;Icecap&quot; planned for 1993 was abandoned in Area 7 following 1992&#x27;s testing moratorium. The tower, shaft and wiring remain in place, along with a crane intended to lower the nuclear test package into the shaft.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOE/NV-1212&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Area 8===

Area 8 held 13 nuclear tests for a total of 15 detonations.

Area 8 hosted the &quot;Baneberry&quot; shot of Operation Emery on December 18, 1970. The Baneberry test detonated below the surface but its energy cracked the soil in unexpected ways, causing a fissure near ground zero and the failure of the shaft stemming and cap. A plume of fire and dust was released, raining fallout on workers in different locations within the site. The radioactive plume released of radioactive material, including of Iodine131.

===Area 9===
Area 9 held 115 nuclear tests for a total of 133 detonations.

In Area 9, the &quot;Hood&quot; test on July 5, 1957, part of Operation Plumbbob, was the largest atmospheric test ever conducted within the continental United States; nearly five times larger in yield than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. A balloon carried Hood up to 460 meters above the ground where it was detonated. Over 2,000 troops took part in the test in order to train them in conducting operations on the nuclear battlefield. of iodine-131 (131I) were released into the air.

===Area 10===

Area 10 held 57 nuclear tests for a total of 71 detonations.

The first underground test at the site was the &quot;Uncle&quot; shot of Operation Jangle. Uncle detonated on November 29, 1951, within a shaft sunk into Area 10.

The &quot;John&quot; shot of Plumbbob, on July 19, 1957, was the first test firing of the nuclear-tipped AIR-2 Genie air-to-air rocket designed to destroy incoming enemy bombers with a nuclear explosion. The warhead exploded approximately three miles above five volunteers and a photographer who stood unprotected at &quot;ground zero&quot; in Area 10 to show the safety of battlefield nuclear weapons to personnel on the ground. The test also demonstrated the ability of a fighter aircraft to deliver a nuclear-tipped rocket and avoid being destroyed in the process. A Northrop F-89J fired the rocket.

The &quot;Sedan&quot; test of Operation Storax on July 6, 1962, a shot for the Operation Plowshare which sought to discover whether nuclear weapons could be used for peaceful means in creating lakes, bays or canals. The explosion displaced 12 million tons of earth, creating the Sedan crater which is 1,280 feet (390 m) wide and 320 feet (100 m) deep.

===Area 11===

Area 11 held 9 nuclear tests.
Four of the tests were weapons safety experiments conducted as Project 56; they spread so much radioactive material that Area 11 has been called &quot;Plutonium Valley&quot;. As is the case with Area 1, background radiation levels make Area 11 suitable for realistic training in methods of radiation detection.

===Area 12===

Area 12 held 61 nuclear tests between 1957 and 1992, one of which involved two detonations. All tests were conducted below Rainier and Aqueduct mesas.

Area 12 was the primary location for tunnel tests and used almost exclusively for that purpose. The tunnel complexes mined into Rainier and Aqueduct Mesa include the B-, C-, D-, E-, F-, G-, I-, J-, K-, N-, P-, and T-Tunnel complexes, and the R- and S- shafts.

===Area 13===
There is no Area 13 within NNSS, though such a name is attached to a section of Nellis Air Force Range which abuts the northeastern corner of Area 15. Project 57&#x27;s weapons safety test was conducted here on April 24, 1957, spreading particles emitting alpha radiation over a large area.

===Area 14===
Area 14 occupies approximately in the central portion of the NNSS. Various outdoor experiments are conducted in this area.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOE/EIS-246-D&quot;&gt;National Nuclear Security Administration / Nevada Site Office, &quot;Draft Site-Wide Environmental Impact Statement Nevada&quot;, ch.2, July 2011, DOE/EIS-246-D &lt;/ref&gt; No atmospheric or underground nuclear tests were conducted in Area 14.

===Area 15===

Three underground detonations took place in area 15 in the 1960s.

&quot;Pile Driver&quot; was a notable Department of Defense test. A large underground installation was built to study the survivability of hardened underground bunkers undergoing a nuclear attack. Information from the test was used in designing hardened missile silos and the North American Aerospace Defense Command facility in Colorado Springs.

The abandoned Crystal and Climax mines are found in Area 15. Storage tanks hold contaminated materials.

From 1964 to 1981, the Environmental Protection Agency operated a experimental farm in Area 15. Extensive plant and soil studies evaluated the uptake of pollutants in farm-grown vegetables and from the forage eaten by a dairy herd of some 30 Holstein cows. Scientists also studied horses, pigs, goats, and chickens.

===Area 16===
Area 16 held six nuclear tests.

===Area 17===
No nuclear tests took place in Area 17.

===Area 18===
Area 18 held five nuclear tests and includes the Pahute Mesa Airstrip.

===Area 19===

Pahute Mesa is one of four major nuclear test regions within the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS). It occupies in the northwest corner of the NNSS. The eastern section is known as Area 19 and the western section as Area 20.

A total of 85 nuclear tests were conducted in Pahute Mesa between 1965 and 1992. Three of them – Boxcar, Benham and Handley – had a yield of over one megaton. Three tests were conducted as part of Operation Plowshare and one as part of Vela Uniform.

===Area 20===

The western section of Pahute Mesa, with a portion of the 85 nuclear tests conducted in the Pahute Mesa occurring in this section.

===Area 21===
There is no Area 21 within NNSS, though such a name is attached to a section of Los Alamos National Laboratory.

===Area 22===
No nuclear tests took place in Area 22. Area 22 once held Camp Desert Rock, a staging base for troops undergoing atmospheric nuclear blast training; as many as 9,000 troops camped there in 1955. Desert Rock Airport&#x27;s runway was enlarged to a length in 1969 by the Atomic Energy Commission. It is a transport hub for personnel and supplies going to NNSS and also serves as an emergency landing strip.

===Area 23===
No nuclear tests took place in Area 23. The town of Mercury, Nevada lies within Area 23. The area is the main pathway to and from NNSS test locations by way of U.S. Route 95. An open sanitary landfill is located to the west of Mercury, and a closed hazardous waste site abuts the landfill. Mercury is also the main management area for the site which includes a bar and large cafeteria, printing plant, medical center, warehousing, fleet management, liquidation and recycling center, engineering offices, dormitories, and other administrative areas for both the O&amp;M contractors, LLNL, LANL, and SNL personnel. At its height in the 1950s and &#x27;60s, it also held several restaurants, a bowling alley, a movie theater, and a motel.

===Area 24===
There is no Area 24 within NNSS, though such a name is attached to a satellite site of the NNSS referred to as the North Las Vegas Facility.

===Area 25===
===Area 26===

No nuclear tests took place in Area 26, the most arid section of the NNSS. An old abandoned mine, the Horn Silver Mine, was used for waste disposal between 1959 and the 1970s; some of the waste is radioactive. Water flow past the shaft could pose a human health risk, so corrective action has been planned.

In 1983 the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency performed the NUWAX-83 tests near Port Gaston in Area 26, simulating the explosion of a nuclear-armed helicopter and the resulting spread of nuclear debris over 65 acres. The radioactive material used to simulate the accident became inert in less than six months.

An eight-square-mile complex was constructed in Area 26 in support of Project Pluto. It consisted of six miles of roads, the critical assembly building, the control building, the assembly and shop buildings, and utilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOE/NV-763&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Those buildings have been used recently as mock reactor facilities in the training of first responders.

===Area 27===
===Area 28===
Area 28 no longer exists; it was absorbed into Areas 25 and 27.

===Area 29===
No nuclear tests took place in Area 29. The rugged terrain of Area 29 serves as a buffer between other areas of NNSS. A helipad is present at Shoshone Peak.

===Area 30===

Area 30 occupies approximately at the center of the western edge of the NNSS. Area 30 has rugged terrain and includes the northern reaches of Fortymile Canyon. It is used primarily for military training and exercises.

Area 30 was the site of a single nuclear test, the &quot;Crosstie Buggy&quot; row charge experiment, part of Operation Plowshare, which involved five simultaneous detonations.

<text>The People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen, commonly referred to as South Yemen, became independent as the People&#x27;s Republic of South Yemen on 30 November 1967. The President of the Republic served as head of state, appointing a Prime Minister to serve as head of government.

On 22 June 1969, the left wing of National Liberation Front (NLF) took power in the country, reorganizing the government. The Chairman of the Presidential Council became the head of state. This was followed closely in 1970 by the renaming of the country to the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen. Another reorganization in 1978 after Yemen Socialist Party foundation in October made the head of state&#x27;s title Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme People&#x27;s Council. This lasted until unification with the Yemen Arab Republic on 22 May 1990, when the then-Chairman became the Prime Minister of the united Yemen.

== President of the People&#x27;s Republic of South Yemen ==
== Chairman of the Presidential Council ==
The Presidential Council of Democratic Yemen was established as part of the reforms made during the &quot;Corrective Move&quot;, in which Qahtan al-Shaabi got overthrown by the left wing of the National Liberation Front (NLF). Its role was to manage internal divisions within the National Liberation Front (NLF), which evolved into the Yemeni Socialist Party in 1978, and maintain regional balance.

The council consisted of five members: Abdul Fattah Ismail of the North, Mohammed Ali Haytham of Abyan, Mohammed Saleh al-Awlaqi of Shabwa, Ali Antar of Dhale and Salim Rubaya Ali (Salmin) of Abyan who served as president. Over the next two years, personnel changes occurred, with Ali Nasir Muhammad replacing al-Awlaqi. The council&#x27;s membership was based primarily on regional influence within the National Liberation Front, rather than military power, as in the Yemen Arab Republic up north.

The council&#x27;s structure, with equal power for all members, resulted in a de facto triple presidency shared by Salmin, Ismail, and Ali Nasser. However, this balance did not prevent internal strife, particularly between Rubai, who favored a pro-Chinese Maoist approach, and Ismail, who advocated for a Russian Marxist model. While Rubai relied on his regional base and the loyalty of the army, Ismail&#x27;s influence stemmed from his role as the party&#x27;s ideological leader and his own &quot;Popular Militia&quot;. Ali Nasser acted as a mediator between the two. Despite the council&#x27;s power-sharing arrangement, conflict persisted, culminating in Rubai&#x27;s assassination in 1978. The council&#x27;s structure mirrored the factionalism within the National Liberation Front and was never designed to be a democratic body.

== Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme People&#x27;s Council ==
After Salmeen&#x27;s assassination in 1978, Ismail briefly succeeded him, only to be replaced by Ali Nasser Mohammed after two years, and on 1986 a civil war eventually led to Ali Nasser&#x27;s own removal.

For Presidents after unification in 1990, see: List of Presidents of Yemen

==President of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, 1994==

South Yemen also rebelled as the Democratic Republic of Yemen for a period of weeks in 1994.

<doc id="162770" wikidata="Q845889" url="?curid=162770" title="Murder on the Orient Express">
<text>Murder on the Orient Express is a work of detective fiction by English writer Agatha Christie featuring the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. It was first published in the United Kingdom by the Collins Crime Club on 1 January 1934. In the United States, it was published on 28 February 1934, under the title of Murder in the Calais Coach, by Dodd, Mead and Company. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $2.

The elegant train of the 1930s, the &quot;Orient Express&quot;, is stopped by heavy snowfall. A murder is discovered, and Poirot&#x27;s trip home to London from the Middle East is interrupted to solve the case. The opening chapters of the novel take place primarily in Istanbul. The rest of the novel takes place in Yugoslavia, with the train trapped between Vinkovci and Brod, in what is now northeastern Croatia.

The American title of &quot;Murder in the Calais Coach&quot; was used to avoid confusion with the 1932 Graham Greene novel &quot;Stamboul Train&quot;, which had been published in the United States as &quot;Orient Express&quot;.

==Plot==
After taking the &quot;Taurus Express&quot; from Aleppo to Istanbul, private detective Hercule Poirot arrives at the Tokatlian Hotel, where he receives a telegram prompting him to return to London. He instructs the concierge to book him a first-class compartment on the Simplon-route &quot;Orient Express&quot; service leaving that night. Although the train is fully booked, Poirot obtains a second-class berth through the intervention of friend, fellow Belgian, and fellow passenger Monsieur Bouc, director of the train operator &quot;Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits&quot; (CIWL). Other passengers include American widow Caroline Hubbard; English governess Mary Debenham; Swedish missionary Greta Ohlsson; American businessman Samuel Ratchett, with his secretary/translator Hector MacQueen, and his English valet Edward Henry Masterman; Italian-American car salesman Antonio Foscarelli; Russian Princess Natalia Dragomiroff and her German maid Hildegarde Schmidt; Hungarian Count Rudolph Andrenyi and his wife Helena; English Colonel John Arbuthnot; American salesman Cyrus B. Hardman; and Greek medical doctor Stavros Constantine.

Ratchett has been receiving death threats; recognizing Poirot, he tries to hire him for protection. Poirot, repulsed by Ratchett, refuses, telling him, &quot;I will not take your case because I do not like your face.&quot; Bouc has taken the last first-class cabin, but on the first morning he arranges to move to a separate coach and gives Poirot his space. That night, Poirot observes some strange occurrences. Early in the morning, he is awakened by a cry from Ratchett&#x27;s compartment next door. Pierre Michel, the train&#x27;s conductor, knocks on Ratchett&#x27;s door, but a voice from inside responds, &quot;Ce n&#x27;est rien. Je me suis trompé.&quot; (&quot;It is nothing. I was mistaken.&quot;) Hubbard rings her bell and tells Michel a man passed through her room. When Poirot rings his bell for water, Michel informs him that the train is stuck in a snowdrift between Vinkovci and Brod before he hears a loud thump next door. He observes a woman in a scarlet kimono going towards the washroom, then goes to sleep.

The next morning, with the train still stalled, Bouc informs Poirot that Ratchett has been murdered and the murderer is still aboard, having no way to escape in the snow. As there are no police on board, Poirot takes up the case. With help from Dr. Constantine, Poirot examines Ratchett&#x27;s body and compartment, discovering the following: the body has twelve stab wounds, the window had been left open, a handkerchief with the initial &quot;H&quot;, a pipe cleaner, a flat match different from the ones Ratchett used, and a charred piece of paper with &quot;member little Daisy Armstrong&quot; written on it.

The piece of paper helps Poirot work out the murderer&#x27;s motive. Many years earlier, American gangster Cassetti kidnapped three-year-old Daisy Armstrong. Cassetti collected a significant ransom from the wealthy Armstrong family, then revealed that he had already killed the child. Sonia Armstrong, Daisy&#x27;s mother, who was pregnant with her second child, went into premature labor upon hearing the news and died, along with the baby. Her grieving husband, Colonel Armstrong, shot himself, and Daisy&#x27;s French nursemaid, Susanne, was accused of aiding Cassetti and killed herself, only to be found innocent afterwards. Cassetti escaped justice through corruption and legal technicalities, and fled the country. Poirot concludes that Ratchett was actually Cassetti. Whoever had answered the conductor was not Ratchett, as Ratchett did not speak French.

As Poirot begins interviewing everyone on the train, he discovers MacQueen is directly involved as he knows about the Armstrong note and believed it was destroyed and that Hubbard believes the murderer was in her cabin. While the passengers and Pierre all provide suitable alibis for each other, Poirot notes that some of them observed the woman in the scarlet kimono walking down the hallway on the night of the murder. However, no one admits to owning a scarlet kimono. Hubbard had Ohlsson lock the communicating door between her compartment and that of Cassetti, which invalidates her story of the man in her compartment, and Schmidt bumped into a stranger wearing a Wagons-Lits uniform. Miss Debenham inadvertently reveals she has been to America, contrary to her earlier statements, and Ohlsson shows much emotion when the subject of Daisy is brought up, causing further suspicion. Arbuthnot remarks that Cassetti should have been found guilty in a second trial instead of murdered, and Hardman admits he is actually a MacNeil Agency private detective who was asked to watch out for an assassin that was stalking Cassetti.

While inspecting the passengers&#x27; luggage, Poirot is surprised to find the label on Countess Andrenyi&#x27;s luggage is wet and that her passport is smudged, Schmidt&#x27;s bag contains the uniform in question, and Poirot&#x27;s own luggage contains the red kimono, recently hidden there. Hubbard herself finds the murder weapon hidden in her sponge bag. Poirot meets with Dr. Constantine and Bouc to review the case and develop a list of questions. With these and the evidence in mind, Poirot thinks about the case, going into a trance-like state. When he surfaces from it, he deduces the solution.

He calls in the suspects and reveals their true identities and that they were all connected to the Armstrong tragedy in some way, gathering them in the dining car for the second solution. Countess Andrenyi (née Goldenberg) is Helena, Daisy&#x27;s aunt, who was a child herself at the time of the tragedy. Rudolph, her loving husband, smudged her luggage label and obscured her name to conceal her identity. Debenham was Helena&#x27;s and Daisy&#x27;s governess; Foscarelli was the Armstrongs&#x27; chauffeur and a suspect in the kidnapping; Masterman was Col. Armstrong&#x27;s valet; Michel is Susanne&#x27;s father and the person who procured the false second uniform; Hubbard is actually actress Linda Arden (Daisy&#x27;s grandmother and Sonia&#x27;s and Helena&#x27;s mother); Schmidt was the Armstrongs&#x27; cook; and Ohlsson was Daisy&#x27;s nurse. Princess Dragomiroff, in reality Sonia&#x27;s godmother, claims the monogrammed handkerchief, saying that her forename is Natalia, and the &quot;H&quot; is actually a Cyrillic letter &quot;N&quot;. Arbuthnot is there on Debenham&#x27;s behalf and his own, as he was a personal friend of Colonel Armstrong. Hardman is an ex-policeman who admits he was in love with Susanne, and MacQueen, who had feelings for Sonia, was the son of the lawyer who represented the Armstrongs. The only passengers not involved in the murder are Bouc and Dr. Constantine, both having slept in the other coach, which was locked.

Poirot propounds two possible solutions, one far simpler than the other, and advises them to consider both seriously. The first is that a stranger boarded the train when it stopped at Vinkovci, disguised as a train conductor; he killed Cassetti as a result of a Mafia feud, and disembarked just before the train started off again. The second is that all the clues except the note about Daisy Armstrong were planted and that Michel and all the passengers in the coach, except Helena, stabbed Cassetti, acting as their own jury. Arden acknowledges everything and offers to take responsibility as she was the mastermind. Bouc and Dr. Constantine, however, decide the first solution should be relayed to the police. Poirot retires from the case.

==Writing==
The kidnapping and murder of Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s son in 1932 inspired that element in Christie&#x27;s novel two years later. The novel used many elements of the real life case: a young child, firstborn of the family, was kidnapped for ransom directly from the crib, the parents were famous, the father was a well-known pilot and the mother pregnant, and the ransom was paid but the child found dead soon after. An innocent, but perhaps loose-lipped, maid employed by Lindbergh&#x27;s parents was suspected of involvement in the crime. After being harshly interrogated by police, she killed herself.

Two less notable events helped inspire her novel: Agatha Christie&#x27;s first journey on the Orient Express in late 1928, and a blizzard near Çerkezköy, Turkey, that thwarted the Orient Express&#x27;s progress for six days just a few months later, in February 1929.

Flooding from rainfall that washed sections of track away in December 1931 halted Christie&#x27;s return from her husband&#x27;s archaeological dig at Nineveh aboard an Orient Express for 24 hours. Her authorised biography details that event in a complete quotation of a letter to her husband, which describes several passengers on her train who inspired both the plot and the characters in her novel, including an American, Mrs. Hilton, who inspired Mrs. Hubbard.

==Reception==
The &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; of 11 January 1934 outlined the plot and concluded that &quot;The little grey cells solve once more the seemingly insoluble. Mrs Christie makes an improbable tale very real, and keeps her readers enthralled and guessing to the end.&quot;

In &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; of 4 March 1934, Isaac Anderson wrote, &quot;The great Belgian detective&#x27;s guesses are more than shrewd; they are positively miraculous. Although both the murder plot and the solution verge upon the impossible, Agatha Christie has contrived to make them appear quite convincing for the time being, and what more than that can a mystery addict desire?&quot;

The reviewer in &quot;The Guardian&quot; of 12 January 1934 noted that the murder would have been &quot;perfect&quot; (i.e. a perfect crime) had Poirot not been on the train and also overheard a conversation between Miss Debenham and Colonel Arbuthnot before he boarded; however, Poirot&#x27;s little grey cells&#x27; worked admirably, and the solution surprised their owner as much as it may well surprise the reader, for the secret is well kept and the manner of the telling is in Mrs Christie&#x27;s usual admirable manner.&quot;

Robert Barnard said that this novel was &quot;The best of the railway stories. The Orient Express, snowed up in Yugoslavia, provides the ideal &#x27;closed&#x27; set-up for a classic-style exercise in detection, as well as an excuse for an international cast-list. Contains my favourite line in all Christie: &#x27;Poor creature, she&#x27;s a Swede.&#x27; Impeccably clued, with a clever use of the Cyrillic script (cf. &quot;The Double Clue&quot;). The solution raised the ire of Raymond Chandler, but won&#x27;t bother anyone who doesn&#x27;t insist his detective fiction mirror real-life crime.&quot; The reference is to Chandler&#x27;s criticism of Christie in his essay, &quot;The Simple Art of Murder&quot;. H.R.F. Keating included the novel in his list of &quot;100 Best Crime and Mystery Books&quot;. In 1995, the novel was included in Mystery Writers of America&#x27;s The Top 100 Mystery Novels of All Time list. In December 2014, the novel was included in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s list of the Nine Great Christie Novels.

==Adaptations==

===Radio===
John Moffatt starred as Poirot in a five-part BBC Radio 4 adaptation by Michael Bakewell, directed by Enyd Williams, and originally broadcast from 28 December 1992 – 1 January 1993. André Maranne appeared as Bouc, Joss Ackland as Ratchett/Cassetti, Sylvia Syms as Mrs Hubbard, Siân Phillips as Princess Dragomiroff, Francesca Annis as Mary Debenham, and Peter Polycarpou as Dr. Constantine.

In 2017, the streaming service Audible released another radio adaptation that featured Tom Conti as the voice of Poirot. The voice cast also featured Sophie Okonedo as Mary Debenham, Eddie Marsan as Ratchett/Cassetti, and narration from Art Malik.

The Soviet radio play was released in 1966. The voice cast featured Vsevolod Yakut as Poirot, Rostislav Plyatt as Colonel Arbuthnot, Maria Babanova as Hubbard, Oleg Yefremov as Hector McQueen, Leonid Kanevsky as Antonio Foscarelli, Angelina Stepanova as Princess Dragomiroff and Alexander Lazarev as Hardman.

===Film===

==== &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974) ====

The book was made into a 1974 movie directed by Sidney Lumet and produced by John Brabourne and Richard B. Goodwin; it was a critical and commercial hit. The film starred Albert Finney as Poirot, Martin Balsam as Signor Bianchi, George Coulouris as Dr Constantine, and Richard Widmark as Ratchett/Cassetti, with the remaining cast of suspects including Sean Connery (Arbuthnot), Lauren Bacall (Mrs Hubbard), Anthony Perkins (MacQueen), John Gielgud (Beddoes), Michael York (Count Andrenyi), Jean-Pierre Cassel (Pierre Michel), Jacqueline Bisset (Countess Andrenyi), Wendy Hiller (Princess Dragomiroff), Vanessa Redgrave (Mary Debenham), Rachel Roberts (Hildegarde Schmidt), Colin Blakely (Hardman), Denis Quilley (Foscarelli), and Ingrid Bergman (Greta Ohlsson), who won the 1974 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Only minor changes were made for the film: Mary Debenham was the Armstrong&#x27;s secretary rather than Daisy&#x27;s governess; Masterman was renamed Beddoes; the dead maid was named Paulette instead of Susanne; Helena Goldenberg became Helena Grünwald (which is German for &quot;Greenwood&quot;); Antonio Foscarelli became Gino Foscarelli; Caroline Martha Hubbard became Harriet Belinda Hubbard; and the train company&#x27;s Belgian director, Monsieur Bouc, became instead an Italian director, Signor Bianchi.

==== &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (2017) ====

On 16 June 2015, 20th Century Fox hired Kenneth Branagh to direct and star as Poirot in another film adaptation of the story, which was released on 3 November 2017. On 29 September 2016, the studio issued a press release announcing much of the cast, including Johnny Depp as Ratchett, Michelle Pfeiffer as Mrs Hubbard, Penélope Cruz as Pilar Estravados (a Spanish version of Greta Ohlsson, the name coming from a character in &quot;Hercule Poirot&#x27;s Christmas&quot;), Judi Dench as Princess Dragomiroff, Derek Jacobi as Masterman, Leslie Odom Jr. as Dr Arbuthnot, Daisy Ridley as Mary Debenham, Lucy Boynton as Countess Andrenyi, Tom Bateman as Monsieur Bouc, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo as Biniamino Marquez (a Cuban version of Antonio Foscarelli), Josh Gad as Hector MacQueen, Marwan Kenzari as Pierre Michel, Sergei Polunin as Count Andrenyi, Willem Dafoe as Cyrus Hardman, and Olivia Colman as Hildegarde Schmidt. The character of Col. Arbuthnot is combined with Dr. Constantine to create Dr Arbuthnot, a sniper who served under Col. Armstrong in the war and had his medical school paid for by Armstrong; MacQueen&#x27;s father is portrayed as having been a prosecutor in the Armstrong case rather than the Armstrong family&#x27;s lawyer, and whose career was ruined after he prosecuted the maid Susanne; and Monsieur Bouc is changed from the director of the company to the director&#x27;s nephew. Added was a direct link for Poirot to the Armstrong kidnapping—before Sonia&#x27;s death, John Armstrong wrote to Poirot for help. Also unlike the book, the kidnapping does not take place on Long Island but in New Jersey, where the Lindbergh kidnapping took place. Susanne Michel is switched from Pierre Michel&#x27;s daughter to his sister. Cyrus Hardman poses as an Austrian scientist named Gerhard Hardman for part of the film. The last scene also sets up &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; as a sequel.

===Television===
====German adaptation (1955)====
The novel was first adapted as a 1955 episode of the West German television series &quot;Die Galerie der großen Detektive&quot;. Heini Göbel played the role of Poirot.

====&quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (2001)====

A thoroughly modernized and poorly received made-for-TV version starring Alfred Molina as Poirot was presented by CBS in 2001. This version co-starred Meredith Baxter as Mrs Hubbard and Leslie Caron as Señora Alvarado (based on Princess Dragomiroff, and portrayed as the widow of a South American dictator). Poirot is portrayed as significantly younger and less eccentric than Christie&#x27;s detective, and is given a subplot involving a romantic relationship with Vera Rosakoff, who is loosely based on an infrequently recurring character of the same name. The story is updated to a contemporary setting, and four of the suspects (Hildegarde Schmidt, Cyrus Hardman, Edward Masterman and Greta Ohlsson) are deleted, as is Dr Constantine.

====&quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;: &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (2010)====
David Suchet reprised the role of Hercule Poirot in &quot;&quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;&quot; (2010), a 90-minute movie-length episode of the television series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; co-produced by ITV Studios and WGBH-TV, adapted for the screen by Stewart Harcourt. The original air date was 11 July 2010 in the United States, and it was aired on Christmas Day 2010 in the UK.

The cast includes Dame Eileen Atkins as Princess Dragomiroff, Hugh Bonneville as Masterman, Jessica Chastain as Mary Debenham, Barbara Hershey as Mrs Hubbard, Toby Jones as Ratchett, and David Morrissey as Colonel Arbuthnot.

The character Cyrus Hardman (the former American police officer turned private detective) has been largely amalgamated with the chauffeur Foscarelli (inasmuch as being the lover of the dead maid) and Dr Constantine (who in the novel is unrelated to the murders) becomes a coconspirator, depicted as having been the Armstrong family&#x27;s doctor in America.

As in the 2017 film, MacQueen&#x27;s father was the prosecutor rather than the Armstrongs&#x27; lawyer, whose career was ruined after he was threatened into acquitting Cassetti. The adaptation&#x27;s treatment of Ratchett&#x27;s murder is much darker than the novel. The killers gather in his cabin and stab him one by one while he is drugged but awake, rather than stabbing him independently while he is unconscious. The ending dwells on Poirot&#x27;s horror at the act of mob justice and his moral conflict, in view of his Catholic faith and commitment to the law, when he decides not to tell the Yugoslavian police what he knows.

The interior of the Orient Express was reproduced at Pinewood Studios in London, while other locations include the Freemason Hall, Nene Valley Railway, and a street in Malta (shot to represent Istanbul).

====Japanese TV adaptation (2015)====
A Japanese adaptation was broadcast over two nights in January 2015 on Fuji Television, titled &quot;&quot;, and it featured several famous actors, including Ninomiya Kazunari, Matsushima Nanako, Tamaki Hiroshi, Kichise Michiko, Nishida Toshiyuki, and Sawamura Ikki. The main character, Suguro Takeru, modeled on Hercule Poirot, was played by actor Nomura Mansai.

The first night featured a storyline true to the original text, but set in Japan in 1933. In this version, the train &quot;Orient Kyuukou&quot; ran from the western city of Shimonoseki to Tokyo, with the train stopped by a small avalanche near Sekigahara, Gifu.

The second night was an original story.

====Chinese TV adaptation (2022)====
The first four episodes of &quot;Checkmate&quot; (&quot;Min guo da zhen tan&quot;) is based on the story. Hu Yitian plays Si Tu Yan, a young lawyer from Peking who was dismissed from his post for sticking to his principles. He comes to Harbin to become a detective where he meets the forthright and wealthy friend Luo, played by Zhang Yunlong.

===Stage===
American playwright Ken Ludwig adapted the novel into a play, &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;, which premiered at the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey on 14 March 2017. The production was directed by Emily Mann, and starred Allan Corduner in the role of Hercule Poirot.

In 2024, Old Globe Theatre presented the Asolo Repertory Theatre Production reprise of the Ken Ludwig adoption. Andrew Sellon led the cast in the starring role previously played at Maltz Jupiter Theatre. The stage&#x27;s turntable rotated between the train exterior, the dining car, the sleeping compartments, and the parlor car as snow effects set the scene.

===Comics===

On 12 September 2023, &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; was adapted into an authorized graphic novel illustrated by Bob Al-Greene and published by William Morrow Paperbacks.

===Games===

A board game based on the novel named &quot;Orient Express&quot; was released in 1985. 

The point and click computer game &quot;Agatha Christie: Murder on the Orient Express&quot; was released in November 2006 for Windows and expanded on Agatha Christie&#x27;s original story, revolving around Antoinette Marceau – a new character created specifically for the game – as Hercule Poirot (voiced by David Suchet) is ill and recovering in his train compartment.

On October 19, 2023, Microids released a new video game adaptation titled &quot;Agatha Christie – Murder on the Orient Express&quot;. Having one prologue and thirteen chapters, &quot;Agatha Christie – Murder on the Orient Express&quot; faithfully adapts and modernizes the novel&#x27;s plot, with the main characters retaining their original names and using mobile phones and computers. Players alternately take on the two roles of Poirot and an American detective named Joanna Locke. For four years, Locke has been investigating the kidnapping and murder of Daisy Armstrong, and boarded the &quot;Orient Express&quot; in a failed attempt to arrest Cassetti for the crime and prove Susanne&#x27;s innocence. Switching between flashbacks and the present time, the in-game investigation progresses as Poirot and Locke exchange clues regarding Cassetti and the Armstrong case. While the first eight chapters of the game adapt the entire novel, a twist expands the plot by adding a thirteenth killer, who had murdered Cassetti before the Armstrongs&#x27; and Susanne&#x27;s loved ones unleashed their revenge on him. The five remaining chapters of the game revolve around Poirot and Locke hunting down the perpetrator and bringing to light Cassetti&#x27;s own crimes and other victims. &quot;Agatha Christie – Murder on the Orient Express&quot; is available on PC and PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch consoles.

The story&#x27;s first true publication was the US serialisation in six instalments in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; from 30 September to 4 November 1933 (Volume 206, Numbers 14 to 19). The title was &quot;Murder in the Calais Coach&quot;, and it was illustrated by William C. Hoople.

The UK serialisation appeared after book publication, appearing in three instalments in the &quot;Grand Magazine&quot;, in March, April, and May 1934 (Issues 349 to 351). This version was abridged from the book version (losing some 25% of the text), was without chapter divisions, and named the Russian princess as Dragiloff instead of Dragomiroff. Advertisements in the back pages of the UK first editions of &quot;The Listerdale Mystery&quot;, &quot;Why Didn&#x27;t They Ask Evans&quot;, and &quot;Parker Pyne Investigates&quot; claimed that &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; had proven to be Christie&#x27;s best-selling book to date and the best-selling book published in the Collins Crime Club series.

<doc id="162772" wikidata="Q1507619" url="?curid=162772" title="Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">
<text>The deputy prime minister of the United Kingdom is an honorific title given to a minister of the Crown and a member of the British Cabinet, normally to signify a very senior minister, the deputy leader of the governing party, or a key political ally of the prime minister. It does not entail any specific legal responsibilities, though the holder may be assigned some, and is usually paired with a departmental secretary of state position. The title is not always in use and prime ministers have been known to appoint deputies with title first secretary of state or informal deputies without any honorific title. The current deputy prime minister is Angela Rayner.

==Constitutional position==
Deputy prime minister is a title and successive monarchs have refused to officially recognise the position. It brings with it no salary and the holder of the title has no right to automatic succession to the premiership. 

When Winston Churchill attempted to have Anthony Eden appointed deputy prime minister in 1942, George VI said that the &#x27;office ... does not exist&#x27; and that conferring the title may be seen as an attempt to designate the prime minister&#x27;s successor and thus may restrict the monarch&#x27;s royal prerogative. However, Vernon Bogdanor has said that that argument holds little weight in the modern context, since the monarch no longer has any real discretion, and that, even in the past, a person acting as deputy prime minister had no real advantage to being appointed prime minister.

== Responsibilities ==
The title is not always in use and the holder&#x27;s responsibilities will vary depending on the circumstances. As of December 2024, the deputy prime minister&#x27;s responsibilities include: deputising for the prime minister (in the House of Commons, domestically and internationally), supporting the prime minister, special responsibility for employment rights and cross-governmental coordination of communities policy.

Rodney Brazier has written that there are three reasons why a deputy prime minister has been appointed: to set out the line of succession to the premiership preferred by the prime minister, to promote the efficient discharge of government business and (in the case of Labour governments) to accord recognition to the status of the deputy leader of the Labour party. Jonathan Kirkup and Stephen Thornton suggest that there are multiple motivations behind a prime minister appointing a deputy: leader of a party in a coalition government, as their designated successor, to neuter or mollify a rival, because they are a &#x27;safe pair of hands&#x27; and to create a &#x27;balanced ticket&#x27;.

Philip Norton says that there are two advantages to a prime minister of having a deputy prime minister (or first secretary of state): functional (to serve the prime minister free of departmental responsibilities, so they can do &#x27;correlation, co-ordination and chairmanship of committees&#x27;, in the words of Rab Butler) and political (to send a signal as to the status of the holder). Bogdanor, Brazier and Anthony Seldon also suggest that the title may be of use if a prime minister were to die or fall unable to exercise their functions.

==History==
Before World War II, while a minister was occasionally invited to deputise as prime minister when the prime minister was ill or abroad, no one was styled as such when the prime minister was in the country and physically able to run the government. This changed in 1942 when Clement Attlee was styled as deputy prime minister by Winston Churchill. This designation was seen as an exceptional result of a coalition and the war, and Attlee&#x27;s 1942 appointment was not formally approved by the King and was a matter of form rather than fact. The designation was because Churchill wanted to demonstrate the importance of the Labour party in the coalition, not for any reasons relating to succession; he actually left written advice that the King should send for Anthony Eden if he were to die, not Attlee. Unusually in comparison to other unofficial deputy prime ministers, Clement Attlee was described as deputy prime minister by Hansard, whereas other unofficial deputies are described using their official position.

After this, fearing a possible curtailment of the monarch&#x27;s prerogative to choose a prime minister, no one was formally styled deputy prime minister (though there was often a senior minister generally regarded as such) until Michael Heseltine in 1995. As the title of deputy prime minister did not hold any statutory authority, Heseltine was also appointed as First Secretary of State. John Prescott served as deputy prime minister under Tony Blair during the entirety of Blair&#x27;s premiership, and remains the longest-serving deputy prime minister. Prescott&#x27;s statutory authority was originally drawn from his concurrent position as Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions; however, in 2001 this department was broken up and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) was also formed within the Cabinet Office. To ensure he continued to hold statutory authority, he was appointed First Secretary of State. In June 2003, the ODPM became a separate department and absorbed the local government and regions portfolios from the defunct Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions. During the 5 May 2006 reshuffle of Tony Blair&#x27;s government, Prescott kept his position as deputy prime minister but lost his departmental authority and OPDM was renamed the Department for Communities and Local Government and headed by Ruth Kelly. The position was vacant during Gordon Brown&#x27;s premiership.

After the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats formed a coalition government in 2010, Nick Clegg was appointed deputy prime minister under David Cameron, and served in this role until he resigned after the Conservatives won a majority in the 2015 general election. During the coalition William Hague was appointed by Cameron as First Secretary of State, the only time that both these positions have existed concurrently but not been held by the same person. During this time Cameron described Hague rather than Clegg as being his &#x27;de facto political deputy&#x27;. The office of deputy prime minister was vacant for the remainder of Cameron&#x27;s premiership and the entirety of Theresa May&#x27;s premiership; during this time, the Prime Minister was deputised by the Minister for the Cabinet Office.

In 2020, a year before being formally styled deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab deputised for Boris Johnson while Johnson was in hospital with COVID-19, though was not formally styled deputy prime minister until September 2021. Raab served as deputy prime minister during the remainder of Johnson&#x27;s premiership. Thérèse Coffey served as deputy prime minister in September and October 2022 under Liz Truss, becoming the shortest serving deputy prime minister in history. After Rishi Sunak became prime minister, he reappointed Raab as deputy prime minister, making him the first non-consecutive holder of the office. Raab resigned in April 2023 after the investigation into his alleged bullying was published, and was succeeded by deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden, who resigned after the 2024 general election, whereupon he was replaced by Angela Rayner in Keir Starmer&#x27;s Labour government.

==Office and residence==
There is no set of offices permanently ready to house the deputy prime minister. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg maintained an office at the Cabinet Office headquarters, 70 Whitehall, which is linked to 10 Downing Street. Clegg&#x27;s predecessor, Prescott, maintained his main office at 26 Whitehall.

The prime minister may also give them the use of a grace and favour country house. While in office, Nick Clegg resided at his private residence in Putney and he shared Chevening House with First Secretary William Hague as a weekend residence. Clegg&#x27;s predecessor, John Prescott, used Dorneywood.

== List of deputy prime ministers ==
The following people have held the title of deputy prime minister.

== Timeline ==
== Unofficial deputies ==
The prime minister&#x27;s second-in-command has variably served as deputy prime minister, first secretary and &quot;de facto&quot; deputy and at other times prime ministers have chosen not to select a permanent deputy at all, preferring &quot;ad hoc&quot; arrangements. It has also been suggested that the office of Lord President of the Council (which comes with leading precedence) has been intermittently used for deputies in the past.

=== Lists ===

Picking out definitive deputies to the prime minister has been described as a highly problematic task.

Bogdanor, in his 1995 publication &quot;The Monarchy and the Constitution&quot;, said that the following people had acted as deputy prime ministers (by this he meant they had chaired the Cabinet in the absence of the prime minister and chaired a number of key Cabinet Committees):

In an academic article first published in 2015, Jonathan Kirkup and Stephen Thornton used five criteria to identify deputies: gazetted or styled in Hansard as deputy prime minister; &#x27;officially&#x27; designated deputy prime minister by the prime minister; widely recognised by their colleagues as deputy prime minister; second in the ministerial ranking; and chaired the Cabinet or took Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions in the prime minister&#x27;s absence. They said that the following people have the best claim to the position of deputy to the prime minister:

They also said that the following three people would have a reasonable claim:

Brazier has listed the following ministers as unambiguously deputy to or &quot;de facto&quot; deputies of the prime minister:

Lord Norton of Louth has listed the following people as serving as deputy prime minister, but not being formally styled as such:
==Succession==
Nobody has the right of automatic succession to the prime ministership. However, it is generally considered that in the event of the death of the prime minister, it would be appropriate to appoint an interim prime minister, though there is some debate as to how to decide who this should be. In 2021, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case suggested:When the prime minister is travelling, it is standard practice for a senior duty minister to be appointed who can attend to urgent business and meetings if required, though the prime minister remains in charge and updated throughout. And, on 6 April 2020, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted into ICU, he asked First Secretary of State Dominic Raab &quot;to deputise for him where necessary&quot;.

<doc id="162773" wikidata="Q49326" url="?curid=162773" title="Majapahit">
<text>Majapahit (; or ), also known as Wilwatikta (; ), was a Javanese Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empire in Southeast Asia based on the island of Java (in modern-day Indonesia). At its greatest extent, following significant military expansions, the territory of the empire and its tributary states covered almost the entire Nusantara archipelago, spanning both Asia and Oceania. After a civil war that weakened control over the vassal states, the empire slowly declined before collapsing in 1527 due to an invasion by the Sultanate of Demak. The fall of Majapahit saw the rise of Islamic kingdoms in Java.

Established by Raden Wijaya in 1292, Majapahit rose to power after the Mongol invasion of Java and reached its peak during the era of the queen Tribhuvana and her son Hayam Wuruk, whose reigns in the mid-14th century were marked by conquests that extended throughout Southeast Asia. This achievement is also credited to the famous prime minister Gajah Mada. According to the &quot;Nagarakṛtāgama&quot; written in 1365, Majapahit was an empire of 98 tributaries, stretching from Sumatra to New Guinea; including territories in present-day Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, southern Thailand, Timor Leste, and southwestern Philippines (in particular the Sulu Archipelago), although the scope of Majapahit sphere of influence is still the subject of debate among historians. The nature of Majapahit&#x27;s relations and influence upon its overseas vassals and also its status as an empire still provokes discussion.

Majapahit was one of the last major Hindu-Buddhist empires of the region and is considered to be one of the greatest and most powerful empires in the history of Indonesia and Southeast Asia. It is sometimes seen as the precedent for Indonesia&#x27;s modern boundaries. Its influence extended beyond the modern territory of Indonesia and has been the subject of many studies.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Majapahit&quot; (sometimes also spelled &quot;Mojopait&quot; to reflect Javanese pronunciation), derives from Javanese, meaning &quot;bitter &quot;maja&quot;&quot;. German orientalist Berthold Laufer suggested that the &quot;maja&quot; element comes from the Javanese name of &quot;Aegle marmelos&quot;, an Indonesian tree. Majapahit is also referred to by the Sanskrit-derived synonym &quot;Wilwatikta&quot; (). Toponyms containing the word &quot;maja&quot; are common in the area in and around Trowulan (e.g. Mojokerto), as it is a widespread practice in Java to name an area, a village or settlement with the most conspicuous or abundant tree or fruit species found in that region. The 16th-century chronicle &quot;Pararaton&quot; records a legend linked to the establishment of a new settlement in the forest of Trik by Raden Wijaya in 1292. It was said that the workers clearing the Trik forest encountered some &quot;maja&quot; trees and consumed their bitter-tasting fruit which then gave its name to the village.

Strictly speaking, the name &quot;Majapahit&quot; refers to the kingdom&#x27;s capital, but today it is common to refer to the kingdom with its capital&#x27;s name. In Javanese primary sources, the kingdom as an extended territory is generally referred to not as &quot;Majapahit&quot; but rather as &quot;bhūmi Jawa&quot; (&quot;land of Java&quot;) in Old Javanese or &quot;yava-dvīpa-maṇḍala&quot; (&quot;country of the island of Java&quot;) in Sanskrit.

==Historiography==
===Archaeological evidence===
Compared to contemporary societies elsewhere in Asia, little physical evidence of Majapahit remains, Majapahit did produce physical evidence: the main ruins dating from the Majapahit period are clustered in the Trowulan area, which was the royal capital of the kingdom. The area has become the centre for the study of Majapahit history. The Trowulan archaeological site was first documented in the 19th century by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, Lieutenant-Governor of British Java of the East India Company from 1811 to 1816. He reported the existence of &quot;ruins of temples... scattered about the country for many miles&quot;, and referred to Trowulan as &quot;this pride of Java&quot;. Aerial and satellite imagery has revealed an extensive network of canals crisscrossing the Majapahit capital. Findings from April 2011 indicate the Majapahit capital was much larger than previously believed after some artefacts were uncovered.

===Inscriptions===
While significant details about the history of Majapahit remain vague, this period of Javanese history is the more comprehensively documented than any other. The most reliable written sources for this period are Old Javanese inscriptions on stone and metal, which are contemporary with the events they describe. These inscriptions provide valuable information about dynasties, religious affairs, village communities, society, economics, and the arts.

The Majapahit dynasty is described in royal inscriptions such as Kudadu (issued in 1294), Sukhamerta (1296), Tuhanyaru (1323), Gajah Mada (1351), Waringin Pitu (1447) and Trailokyapuri (1486). These sources help us to clarify the family relationships and chronologies of the Majapahit rulers, as well as to correct certain errors found in the &quot;Pararaton&quot;. A few inscriptions found outside Java, such as the Pura Abang C inscription discovered in northern Bali, offer conclusive evidence that these areas were under Majapahit control during the late 14th century.

===Javanese chronicles===
Two important chronicle sources are available to historians of Majapahit: &quot;Deśavarṇana&quot; (&quot;Description of Districts&quot;) was composed 1365 and the &quot;Pararaton&quot; (&quot;The Monarchs&quot;) was compiled sometime between 1481 and 1600. Both of these chronicles survive as 19th- or 20th-century palm-leaf manuscripts. The &quot;Deśavarṇana&quot; (also known as &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot;) is an Old Javanese eulogy written during the Majapahit golden age under the reign of Hayam Wuruk, after which some events are covered narratively. Composed by Mpu Prapanca, it provides a primary historical account of Majapahit court during the reign of King Hayam Wuruk, as well as detailed information about the East Javanese countryside and a summary of Singhasari history. The &quot;Pararaton&quot; focuses on Ken Arok, the founder of Singhasari, but includes a number of shorter narrative fragments about the formation of Majapahit.

The Javanese sources incorporate some poetic mythological elements into their historical accounts. This complexity has led to a variety of interpretive approaches. Cornelis Christiaan Berg, a Dutch historian, have considered the entire historical record to be not a record of the past, but a supernatural means by which the future can be determined. Most scholars do not accept this view, as the historical record corresponds in part with Chinese materials that could not have had similar intention. The references to rulers and details of the state structure show no sign of being invented.

===Chinese sources===
The Chinese historical sources on Majapahit mainly acquired from the chronicles of the Yuan and following Ming dynasty. The Chinese accounts on Majapahit are mainly owed to the Ming admiral Zheng He&#x27;s reports during his visit to Majapahit between 1405 and 1432. Zheng He&#x27;s translator Ma Huan wrote a detailed description of Majapahit and where the king of Java lived. The report was composed and collected in &quot;Yingya Shenglan&quot;, which provides valuable insight on the culture, customs, and also various social and economic aspects of Java (, ) during Majapahit period. The Veritable Records of the Ming Dynasty (&quot;Ming shi-lu&quot;) provide supporting evidence for specific events in Majapahit history, such as the Regreg War.

==History==

===Formation===
After defeating the Melayu Kingdom in Sumatra in 1275, Singhasari became the most powerful kingdom in the region. Kublai Khan, the Khagan of the Mongol Empire and the Emperor of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty of China, challenged Singhasari by sending emissaries demanding tribute. Kertanegara of Singhasari refused to pay the tribute, insulted Kublai&#x27;s envoy, and challenged the Khan instead. In response, Kublai Khan sent a massive expedition of 1000 ships to Java in 1293.

====Mongol invasion====
By that time, Jayakatwang, the &quot;Adipati&quot; (Duke) of Kediri, a vassal state of Singhasari, had usurped and killed Kertanagara. After being pardoned by Jayakatwang with the aid of Madura&#x27;s regent Arya Wiraraja, Kertanegara&#x27;s son-in-law Raden Wijaya was given the land of Tarik timberland. He then opened the vast timberland and built a new settlement there. The village was named &quot;Majapahit&quot;, which was taken from the name of a fruit that had a bitter taste (&quot;maja&quot; is the fruit name and &quot;pahit&quot; means bitter). When the Yuan army sent by Kublai Khan arrived, Wijaya allied himself with the army to fight against Jayakatwang. Once Jayakatwang was destroyed, Raden Wijaya forced his allies to withdraw from Java by launching a surprise attack. The Yuan army had to withdraw in confusion as they were in hostile territory, with their ships being attacked by Javanese navy. It was also their last chance to catch the monsoon winds home; otherwise, they would have had to wait for another six months.

====The first king, Kertarajasa Jayawardhana====

In 1293, Raden Wijaya founded a stronghold with the capital Majapahit. The exact date used as the birth of the Majapahit kingdom is the day of his coronation, the 15th of Kartika month in the year 1215 using the Javanese Shaka era, which equates to 10 November 1293. During his coronation he was given the formal name Kertarajasa Jayawardhana. King Kertarajasa took all four daughters of Kertanegara as his wives, his first wife and prime queen consort Tribhuwaneswari, and her sisters: Prajnaparamita, Narendraduhita, and Gayatri Rajapatni the youngest. According to Pararaton, he also took a Sumatran Malay Dharmasraya princess named Dara Petak as his wife.

The new kingdom faced challenges. Some of Kertarajasa&#x27;s most trusted men, including Ranggalawe, Sora, and Nambi rebelled against him, though unsuccessfully. It was suspected that the Mahapati Halayudha set the conspiracy to overthrow all of his rivals in the court, led them to revolt against the king, while he gained king&#x27;s favour and attained the highest position in the government. However, following the death of the last rebel Kuti, Halayudha&#x27;s treachery was exposed, subsequently, he was captured, jailed for his stratagems and then sentenced to death. Wijaya himself died in 1309.

====Jayanegara====

Kertarajasa Wijaya was succeeded by his heir Jayanegara. The reign of Jayanegara was a difficult and chaotic one, troubled with several rebellions by his father&#x27;s former companions in arms. Among others are Gajah Biru&#x27;s rebellion in 1314, Semi rebellion in 1318, and the Kuti rebellion in 1319. The Kuti rebellion was the most dangerous one, as Kuti managed to take control of the capital city. With the help of Gajah Mada and his &quot;Bhayangkara&quot; palace guard, Jayanegara barely escaped from the capital and safely hid in Badander village. While the king was in hiding, Gajah Mada returned to the capital city to assess the situation. After learning that Kuti&#x27;s rebellion was not supported by the people or nobles of Majapahit court, Gajah Mada raised resistance forces to crush the Kuti rebellion.

After Kuti forces were defeated, Jayanegara was safely returned to his throne. For his loyalty and excellent service, Gajah Mada was promoted to high office to begin his career in royal court politics.

According to tradition, Wijaya&#x27;s son and successor, Jayanegara, was notorious for his immorality. One of his distasteful acts was his desire to take his half-sisters, Gitarja and Rajadewi, as wives. Since Javanese tradition abhorred the practice of half-siblings marrying, the council of royal elders spoke strongly against the king&#x27;s wishes. It was not clear what motivated Jayanegara&#x27;s wishit might have been his way to ensure his claim to the throne by preventing rivals from being his half-sisters&#x27; suitors, although in the later period of the Majapahit court the custom of marriage among cousins was quite common. In the &quot;Pararaton&quot;, he was known as &quot;Kala Gemet&quot;, or &quot;weak villain&quot;. Around the time of Jayanegara&#x27;s reign in the early 14th century, the Italian Friar Odoric of Pordenone visited the Majapahit court in Java. He mentioned Java to be well-populated and filled with cloves, nutmeg and many other spices. He also mentioned that the king of Java had seven vassals under him and engaged in several wars with the &quot;khan of Cathay&quot;.

In 1328, Jayanegara was murdered by his physician, Tanca, during a surgical operation. In complete mayhem and rage, Gajah Mada immediately killed Tanca. The motive behind this regicide was never clear. According to the &quot;Pararaton&quot;, it was Tanca&#x27;s revenge for the king sexually abusing his wife. However, according to the Balinese manuscript &quot;Babad Dalem&quot;, the assassination was a stratagem crafted by Gajah Mada himself to rid the kingdom of an evil tyrant. Tradition mentions that the immoral, cruel and abusive king often seduced and abused women, even the wives of his own subordinates. Other possible reason includes to protect the two princesses – Gitarja and Rajadewi, the daughters of Gayatri Rajapatni from the king&#x27;s cruelty. Since the slain king was childless, he left no successor.

===Golden age===

====Queen Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi====
Jayanegara&#x27;s stepmother, Gayatri Rajapatni – the most revered matriarch of the court – was supposed to take the helm. However, Rajapatni had retired from worldly affairs to become a Buddhist nun. Rajapatni appointed her daughter, Dyah Gitarja, or known in her formal regnal name as Tribhuwannottungadewi Jayawishnuwardhani, as the queen of Majapahit under Rajapatni&#x27;s auspices. Tribhuwana appointed Gajah Mada as the prime minister in 1336. During his inauguration Gajah Mada declared his Palapa oath, revealing his plan to expand Majapahit realm and building an empire.

During Tribhuwana&#x27;s rule, the Majapahit kingdom grew much larger and became famous in the area. Under the initiative of her able and ambitious prime minister, Gajah Mada, Majapahit sent its armada to conquer the neighbouring island of Bali. According to the Babad Arya Tabanan manuscript, in 1342 Majapahit forces led by Gajah Mada, assisted by his general Arya Damar, the regent of Palembang, landed in Bali. After seven months of battles, Majapahit forces defeated the Balinese king and captured the Balinese capital of Bedulu in 1343. After the conquest of Bali, Majapahit distributed the governing authority of Bali among Arya Damar&#x27;s younger brothers, Arya Kenceng, Arya Kutawandira, Arya Sentong, and Arya Belog. Arya Kenceng led his brothers to govern Bali under Majapahit suzerainty, and he would become the progenitor of the Balinese kings of the Tabanan and Badung royal houses. Through this campaign, Majapahit planted a vassal dynasty that would rule the Bali Kingdom in the following centuries. Tribhuwana ruled Majapahit until the death of her mother in 1350. She abdicated the throne in favour of her son, Hayam Wuruk.

Ibn Battuta in his travels between 1332 and 1347 visited a place called &quot;Mul Jawa&quot; (island of Java or Majapahit Java, as opposed to &quot;al-Jawa&quot; which refers to Sumatra). The empire spanned 2 months of travel and ruled over the country of Qaqula and Qamara. He arrived at the walled city named Qaqula/Kakula, and observed that the city had war junks for pirate raiding and collecting tolls and that elephants were employed for various purposes. He met the ruler of Mul Jawa and stayed as a guest for three days. Ibn Battuta said that the women of Java ride horses, understand archery, and fight like men. Ibn Battuta recorded a story about a country called Tawalisi which oppose the king of China (Yuan dynasty) and waged war with him using numerous junks until he made a peace on certain conditions.

====Reign of Hayam Wuruk and Gajah Mada&#x27;s conquest====

Hayam Wuruk, also known as Rajasanagara, ruled Majapahit in 1350–1389. During this period, Majapahit attained its peak with the help of the prime minister Gajah Mada. Under Gajah Mada&#x27;s command (1313–1364), Majapahit conquered more territories and became the regional power. According to the &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot;, canto XIII and XIV mentioned several states in Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara islands, Maluku, New Guinea, Mindanao, Sulu Archipelago, Luzon and some parts of the Visayas islands as under the Majapahit realm of power. The Hikayat Raja Pasai, a 14th-century Aceh chronicle describe a Majapahit naval invasion on Samudra Pasai in 1350. The attacking force consisted of 400 large jong and an uncountable number of malangbang and kelulus. This expansion marked the greatest extent of Majapahit, making it one of the most influential empires in Indonesian history. It is considered a commercial trading empire in the civilisation of Asia.
In 1355, Hayam Wuruk launched the third invasion of Dayak Ma&#x27;anyan kingdom of Nan Sarunai, which at the time was led by Raden Anyan or Datu Tatuyan Wulau Miharaja Papangkat Amas. This invasion was led by Ampu Jatmika from Kalingga, Kediri with his entourage which according to &quot;Hikayat Banjar&quot; included his advisor Aria Megatsari, general Tumenggung Tatah Jiwa, minister Wiramartas, &quot;punokawan&quot; Patih Baras, Patih Basi, Patih Luhu, dan Patih Dulu, and bodyguards Sang Panimba Segara, Sang Pembelah Batung, Sang Jampang Sasak, and Sang Pengeruntung &#x27;Garuntung&#x27; Manau. Multiple battles happened with the first battle in April 1358; killed Majapahit soldiers were burned in Tambak Wasi. Nansarunai captain Jamuhala was also killed in this battle. While prince Jarang and prince Idong hid in Man near Tabalong-kiwa river. Nansarunai soldiers were concentrated in Pulau Kadap before the second battle happened in December 1362. Casualties from this second battle were buried in &quot;Tambak&quot; in Bayu Hinrang. In this war Raden Anyan was killed, speared by Mpu Nala, and buried in Banua Lawas. In its place, Ampu Jatmika founded a Hindu kingdom state, Negara Dipa under Majapahit tributary, predecessor of Banjar. While surviving Javanese, Dayak, Madurese, and Bugis soldiers, sailors, metalsmiths of this war settled in Amuntai, Alabio, and Nagara. These invasions were recorded in Dayak Ma&#x27;anyan poetry as &quot;Nansarunai Usak Jawa&quot;.

Along with launching naval and military expeditions, the expansion of the Majapahit Empire involved diplomacy and alliance. Hayam Wuruk decided, probably for political reasons, to take princess Citra Rashmi (Dyah Pitaloka) of neighbouring Sunda Kingdom as his consort. The Sundanese took this proposal as an alliance agreement. In 1357 the Sunda king and his royal family came to Majapahit to accompany and marry his daughter to Hayam Wuruk. However, Gajah Mada saw this event as an opportunity to demand Sunda&#x27;s submission to Majapahit overlordship. The skirmish between the Sunda royal family and the Majapahit troops on Bubat square was inevitable. Despite courageous resistance, the royal family were overwhelmed and decimated. Almost the whole of the Sundanese royal party was killed. Tradition mentioned that the heartbroken princess committed suicide to defend the honour of her country. The Battle of Bubat, or the Pasunda Bubat tragedy, became the main theme of &quot;Kidung Sunda&quot;, also mentioned in &quot;Carita Parahyangan&quot; and &quot;Pararaton&quot;, but it was never mentioned in &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot;.
The &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot;, written in 1365, depicts a sophisticated court with refined taste in art and literature and a complex system of religious rituals. The poet describes Majapahit as the centre of a huge mandala extending from New Guinea and Maluku to Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. Local traditions in many parts of Indonesia retain accounts of 14th-century Majapahit&#x27;s power in more or less legendary form. The direct administration of Majapahit did not extend beyond east Java and Bali, but challenges to Majapahit&#x27;s claim to overlordship in outer islands drew forceful responses.

To revive the fortune of Malayu in Sumatra, in the 1370s, a Malay ruler of Palembang sent an envoy to the court of the first emperor of the newly established Ming dynasty. He invited China to resume the tributary system, just like Srivijaya did several centuries earlier. Learning this diplomatic manoeuvre, immediately King Hayam Wuruk sent an envoy to Nanking, convinced the emperor that Malayu was their vassal, and was not an independent country. Subsequently, in 1377, a few years after the death of Gajah Mada, Majapahit sent a punitive naval attack against a rebellion in Palembang, contributing to the end of the Srivijayan successor kingdom. Besides Gajah Mada, Another famous military leader was Adityawarman, known for his chronicle in Minangkabau.
The nature of the Majapahit empire and its extent is subject to debate. It may have had limited or entirely notional influence over some of the tributary states, including Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, Kalimantan, and eastern Indonesia, over which authority was claimed in the &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot;. Geographical and economic constraints suggest that rather than a regular centralised authority, the outer states were most likely to have been connected mainly by trade connections, which were probably a royal monopoly. It also claimed relationships with Champa, Cambodia, Siam, southern Burma, and Vietnam, and even sent missions to China. Although the Majapahit rulers extended their power over other islands and destroyed neighbouring kingdoms, their focus seems to have been on controlling and gaining a larger share of the commercial trade that passed through the archipelago.

About the time Majapahit was founded, Muslim traders and proselytisers began entering the area. The Troloyo/Tralaya tomb, a remnant of Islamic cemetery compound was discovered within the Trowulan area, the royal capital of Majapahit. Experts suggest that the cemetery was used between 1368 and 1611 AD, which means Muslim traders had resided in the capital as early as the mid-14th century during the reign of Hayam Wuruk. Two Muslim tombstones in Troloyo were dated from the 14th century (1368 AD, 1376 AD). The close proximity of the site with the &quot;kraton&quot; means there were Muslim people in close relation with the court.

===Decline===
Following Hayam Wuruk&#x27;s death in 1389, Majapahit power entered a period of decline with conflict over succession. Hayam Wuruk was succeeded by the crown princess Kusumawardhani, who married a relative, Prince Wikramawardhana. Hayam Wuruk also had a son from his previous marriage, the crown prince Wirabhumi, who also claimed the throne.

By the time of Hayam Wuruk&#x27;s death, Majapahit had lost its grip on its vassal states on the northern coasts of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, the latter which according to Chinese sources, would become a tributary state of the Ayutthaya Kingdom until the rise of Malacca Sultanate, supported by the Ming dynasty.

In the 14th century a Malay Kingdom of Singapura was established, and it promptly attracted a Majapahit navy that regarded it as Tumasik, a rebellious colony. Singapura was finally sacked by Majapahit in 1398, after approximately 1 month long siege by 300 jong and 200,000 men. The last king, Parameswara, fled to the west coast of the Malay Peninsula to establish the Melaka Sultanate in 1400.

==== Regreg War ====

A war of succession, called the Regreg War, is thought to have occurred from 1405 to 1406. The war was fought as a contest of succession between the western court led by Wikramawardhana and the eastern court led by Bhre Wirabhumi. Wikramawardhana was victorious. Wirabhumi was caught and decapitated. However the civil war drained financial resources, exhausted the kingdom, and weakened Majapahit&#x27;s grip on its outer vassals and colonies.

====Wikramawardhana and Ming expedition====
During the reign of Wikramawardhana, a series of Ming armada naval expeditions led by Zheng He, a Muslim Chinese admiral, arrived in Java several times spanning the period from 1405 to 1433. These Chinese voyages visited numbers of ports in Asia as far as Africa, including Majapahit ports. It was said that Zheng He has paid a visit to the Majapahit court in Java.

These massive Chinese voyages were not merely a naval exploration, but also a show of power and a display of geopolitical reach. The Chinese Ming dynasty had recently overthrown the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty, and was eager to establish their hegemony in the world, which changed the geopolitical balance in Asia. The Chinese intervened in the politics of the southern seas by supporting Thais against the declining Khmer Empire, supporting and installing allied factions in India, Sri Lanka and other places in Indian Ocean coasts. However, perhaps the most significant Chinese intervention was its support for the newly established Sultanate of Malacca as a rival and counter-weight to the Majapahit influence of Java.

Previously, Majapahit had succeeded in asserting its influence in Malacca strait by containing the aspiration of Malay polities in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula to ever reach the geopolitical might like those of Srivijaya. The Hindu Majapahit was the most powerful maritime power in Southeast Asian seas that time and were opposed to Chinese expansion into their sphere of influence. The Ming&#x27;s support for Malacca and the spread of Islam propagated by both Malacca and Zheng He&#x27;s treasure fleet has weakened Majapahit maritime influence in Sumatra, which caused the northern part of the island to increasingly converting to Islam and gained independence from Majapahit, leaving Indragiri, Jambi and Palembang, remnants of the old Srivijaya, the only suzerainty under Majapahit in Sumatra, bordering Pagaruyung Kingdom on the west and independent Muslim kingdoms on the north.

This Ming dynasty voyages are extremely important for Majapahit historiography, since Zheng He&#x27;s translator Ma Huan wrote &quot;Yingya Shenglan&quot;, a detailed description of Majapahit, which provides valuable insight on the culture, customs, and also various social and economic aspects of Java during Majapahit period.

The Chinese provided systematic support to Malacca, and its sultan made at least one trip to personally pay obeisance to the Ming emperor. Malacca actively encouraged the conversion to Islam in the region, while the Ming fleet actively established Chinese-Malay Muslim community in coastal northern Java, thus created a permanent opposition to the Hindus of Java. By 1430, the expeditions had established Muslim Chinese, Arab and Malay communities in northern ports of Java such as Semarang, Demak, Tuban, and Ampel; thus Islam began to gain a foothold on the northern coast of Java. Malacca prospered under Chinese Ming protection, while the Majapahit were steadily pushed back.

====Queen Suhita====

Wikramawardhana ruled until 1429 and was succeeded by his daughter Suhita, who ruled from 1429 to 1447. She was the second child of Wikramawardhana by a concubine who was the daughter of Wirabhumi. She was married to future Kelantan king Iskandar Shah or Kemas Jiwa in 1427. Both of them had a daughter together and he stayed with her in Java. Kelantan was ruled by his brother, Sultan Sadik Muhammad Shah, until his death in 1429. This necessitated Kemas Jiwa to return and took the throne as Iskandar, where he declared Kelantan as Majapahit II in Mahligai. Although &quot;Pararaton&quot; listed her husband as Bhra Hyang Parameswara Ratnapangkaja, which suggests she remarried after Kemas Jiwa returned.

The reign of Suhita was the second time Majapahit was reigned by a queen regnant after her great-grandmother Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi. Her reign is immortalized in Javanese legend of Damarwulan, as it involves a maiden queen named Prabu Kenya in the story, and during Suhita&#x27;s reign there was a war with Blambangan as stated in the legend.

In 1447, Suhita died and was succeeded by Kertawijaya, her brother. He ruled until 1451. After Kertawijaya died, Bhre Pamotan became a king with formal name Rajasawardhana. He died in 1453. A three-year kingless period was possibly the result of a succession crisis. Girisawardhana, son of Kertawijaya, came to power in 1456. He died in 1466 and was succeeded by Singhawikramawardhana.

====The divide====
In 1468 Prince Kertabhumi rebelled against Singhawikramawardhana, promoting himself as the king of Majapahit. Deposed Singhawikramawardhana retreated upstream of Brantas River, moved the kingdom&#x27;s capital further inland to Daha (the former capital of Kediri kingdom), effectively splitting Majapahit, under Bhre Kertabumi in Trowulan and Singhawikramawardhana in Daha. Singhawikramawardhana continued his rule until he was succeeded by his son Girindrawardhana (Ranawijaya) in 1474.

And in between this period of the dividing court of Majapahit, the kingdom found itself unable to control its western part of the already crumbling empire. The rising power of the Sultanate of Malacca began to gain effective control of the Malacca Strait in the mid-15th century and expanding its influence to Sumatra. And amidst these events, Indragiri and Siantan, according to Malay Annals were given to Malacca as a dowry for the marriage of a Majapahit princess and the sultan of Malacca, further weakening Majapahit&#x27;s influence on the western part of the archipelago. Kertabhumi managed to stabilize this situation by allying with Muslim merchants, giving them trading rights on the north coast of Java, with Demak as its centre and in return asked for their loyalty to Majapahit. This policy boosted the Majapahit treasury and power but weakened Hindu-Buddhism as its main religion because Islamic proselytizing spread faster, especially in Javanese coastal principalities. Hindu-Buddhist followers&#x27; grievances later paved the way for Ranawijaya to defeat Kertabumi.

Dates for the end of the Majapahit Empire range from 1478, traditionally described in &quot;sinengkalan&quot; or &quot;chandrasengkala&quot; (chronogram) &quot;Sirna ilang kertaning bhumi&quot; that is correspond to 1400 Saka, to 1527. The year 1478 was the year of Sudarma Wisuta war, when Ranawijaya&#x27;s army under general Udara (who later became vice-regent) breached Trowulan defences and killed Kertabumi in his palace, but not the actual fall of Majapahit itself as a whole.

Demak sent reinforcements under Sunan Ngudung, who later died in battle and was replaced by Sunan Kudus, but they came too late to save Kertabumi although they managed to repel the Ranawijaya army. This event is mentioned in Trailokyapuri (Jiyu) and Petak inscription, where Ranawijaya claimed that he already defeated Kertabhumi and reunited Majapahit as one Kingdom. Ranawijaya ruled from 1474 to 1498 with the formal name Girindrawardhana, with Udara as his vice-regent. This event led to the war between the Sultanate of Demak and Daha since Demak rulers were descendants of Kertabhumi.

During this period, Demak, being the dominant ruler of the Javanese coastal lands and Java as a whole, seized the region of Jambi and Palembang in Sumatra from Majapahit.

====Demak invasion and the fall of Majapahit====

In 1498, there was a turning point when Girindrawardhana was deposed by his vice-regent, Udara. After this coup, the war between Demak and Majapahit receded, since Raden Patah, Sultan of Demak, left Majapahit alone like his father had done before, some source said Udara agreed to become a vassal of Demak, even marrying Raden Patah&#x27;s youngest daughter.

Meanwhile, in the west, Malacca was captured by Portuguese in 1511. The delicate balance between Demak and Majapahit ended when Udara, seeing an opportunity to eliminate Demak, asked for Portuguese help in Malacca, forcing Demak to attack both Malacca and Majapahit under Adipati Yunus to end this alliance.

With the fall of Majapahit, crushed by Demak in 1527, the Muslim emerging forces finally defeated the remnants of the Majapahit kingdom in the early 16th century; and with the fall of Majapahit, a large number of courtiers, artisans, priests, and members of the royalty moved east to the island of Bali. The refugees fled to the east to avoid Demak retribution for their support for Ranawijaya against Kertabhumi.

Demak came under the leadership of Raden (later crowned as Sultan) Patah, who was acknowledged as the legitimate successor of Majapahit. According to Babad Tanah Jawi and Demak tradition, the source of Patah&#x27;s legitimacy was because their first sultan, Raden Patah, was the son of Majapahit king Brawijaya V with a Chinese concubine. Another argument supports Demak as the successor of Majapahit; the rising Demak sultanate was easily accepted as the nominal regional ruler, as Demak was the former Majapahit vassal and located near the former Majapahit realm in eastern Java.

Demak established itself as the regional power and the first Islamic sultanate in Java. After the fall of Majapahit, the Hindu kingdoms in Java only remained in Pasuruan, Panarukan, and Blambangan on the eastern edge and Sunda Kingdom Pajajaran in the western part. Gradually Hindu communities began to retreat to the mountain ranges in East Java and also to the neighbouring island of Bali. A small enclave of Hindu communities remain in the Tengger mountain range.

==Culture==
The capital Trowulan, was grand and known for its great annual festivities. The main event of the administrative calendar took place on the first day of the month of Caitra (March–April) when representatives from all territories paying tax or tribute to Majapahit came to the capital to pay court. Majapahit&#x27;s territories were roughly divided into three types: the palace and its vicinity; the areas of east Java and Bali which were directly administered by officials appointed by the king; and the outer dependencies which enjoyed substantial internal autonomy.

The first European record about Majapahit came from the travel log of the Italian Mattiussi, a Franciscan friar. In his book &quot;Travels of Friar Odoric of Pordenone&quot;, he visited several places in today&#x27;s Indonesia: Sumatra, Java, and Banjarmasin in Borneo, between 1318 and 1330. He was sent by the Pope to launch a mission into the Asian interiors. In 1318 he departed from Padua, crossed the Black Sea into Persia, all the way across Calcutta, Madras, and Sri Lanka. He then headed to Nicobar island to Sumatra, before visiting Java and Banjarmasin. He returned to Italy by land through Vietnam, China, all the way through the silkroad to Europe in 1330.

In his book, he mentioned that he visited Java without explaining the exact place he had visited. He said that king of Java ruled over seven other kings (vassals). He described the richness of this island, and recorded that the Mongol emperors had repeatedly tried to attack Java, but always ended up in failure and managed to be sent back to the mainland. His full account is as follows:
In the neighbourhood of that realm (Sumatra) is a great island, Java by name, which hath a compass of a good three thousand miles. And the king of it hath subject to himself seven crowned kings. Now this island is populous exceedingly, and is the second best of all islands that exist. For in it grow camphor, cubebs, cardamoms, nutmegs, and many other precious spices. It hath also very great store of all victuals save wine.

The king of this island hath a palace which is truly marvellous. For it is very great, and hath very great staircases, broad and lofty, and the steps thereof are of gold and silver alternately. Likewise the pavement of the palace hath one tile of gold and the other of silver, and the wall of the same is on the inside plated all over with plates of gold, on which are sculptured knights all of gold, which have great golden circles round their heads, such as we give in these parts to the figures of saints. And these circles are all beset with precious stones. Moreover, the ceiling is all of pure gold, and to speak briefly, this palace is richer and finer than any existing at this day in the world.

Now the Great Khan of Cathay many a time engaged in war with this king; but this king always vanquished and got the better of him. And many other things there be which I write not. 
The Javanese kingdom mentioned in this record is Majapahit, and the time of his visit was in 1321 during the reign of Jayanegara (1309–1328).

In &quot;Yingya Shenglan&quot;a record about Zheng He&#x27;s expedition (1405–1433)Ma Huan describes the culture, customs, various social and economic aspects of &quot;Chao-Wa&quot; (Java) during Majapahit period. Ma Huan visited Java during Zheng He&#x27;s 4th expedition in 1413, during the reign of Majapahit king Wikramawardhana. He describes his travel to Majapahit capital, first, he arrived at the port of &quot;Tu-pan&quot; (Tuban) where he saw large numbers of Chinese settlers migrated from Guangdong and Chou Chang. Then he sailed east to thriving new trading town of &quot;Ko-erh-hsi&quot; (Gresik), &quot;Su-pa-erh-ya&quot; (Surabaya), and then sailing inland into the river by smaller boat to the southwest until reached the river port of &quot;Chang-ku&quot; (Changgu). Continued travel by land to the southwest he arrived in &quot;Man-che-po-I&quot; (Majapahit), where the king stay. There are about 200 or 300 foreign families resides in this place, with seven or eight leaders to serve the king. The climate is constantly hot, like summer.
He describes the king&#x27;s costumes; wearing a crown of gold leaves and flowers or sometimes without any headgear; bare-chested without wearing a robe, the bottom parts wears two sashes of embroidered silk. Additional silk rope is looped around the waist as a belt, and the belt is inserted with one or two short blades, called &quot;pu-la-t&#x27;ou&quot; (&quot;belati&quot; or more precisely kris dagger), walking barefoot. When travelling outside, the king rides an elephant or an ox-drawn carriage.

Commoners&#x27; clothing for men is without headgear and women arrange their hair like a bun secured with a hairpin. They wore clothing on the upper body and wrapped unstitched fabrics around the bottom part, Men from a boy aged three to elders slipped &quot;pu-la-t&#x27;ou&quot; (dagger) in their belt. The dagger, made entirely of steel with intricate motifs smoothly drawn. The handles are made of gold, rhino&#x27;s horn or ivory carved with a depiction of human or demon, the carving works are exquisite and skilfully made.

Majapahit people, men and women, favoured their head. If someone was touched on his head, or if there is a misunderstanding or argument when drunk, they will instantly draw their knives and stab each other.

The population of the country did not have a bed or chair to sit and to eat they do not use a spoon or chopsticks. Men and women enjoy chewing betel nut mixed with, betel leaves, and white chalk made from ground mussels shells. They eat rice for the meal, first, they took a scoop of water and soak betel in their mouth, then wash their hands and sit down to make a circle; getting a plate of rice soaked in butter (probably coconut milk) and gravy, and eat using hands to lift the rice and put it in their mouth. When receiving guests, they will offer the guests, not the tea, but with betel nut.

The population consisted of Muslim merchants from the west (Arab and Muslim Indians, but mostly those from Muslim states in Sumatra), Chinese (claimed to be descendants of Tang dynasty), and unrefined locals. The king held annual jousting tournaments. About the marriage rituals; the groom pays a visit to the house of the bride&#x27;s family, the marriage union is consummated. Three days later, the groom escorts his bride back to his home, where the man&#x27;s family beat drums and brass gongs, blowing pipes made from coconut shells (&quot;senterewe&quot;), beating a drum made from bamboo tubes (probably a kind of bamboo gamelan or kolintang), and light fireworks. Escorted in front, behind, and around by men holding short blades and shields. While the bride is a matted-hair woman, with an uncovered body and barefooted. She wraps herself in embroidered silk, wears a necklace around her neck adorned with gold beads, and bracelets on her wrist with ornaments of gold, silver and other precious ornaments. Family, friends and neighbours decorate a decorative boat with betel leaf, areca nut, reeds and flowers are sewn, and arrange a party to welcome the couple on such a festive occasion. When the groom arrives home, the gong and drum are sounded, they will drink wine (possibly arrack or tuak) and play music. After a few days, the festivities end.

About the burial rituals, the dead body was left on the beach or empty land to be devoured by dogs (for lower-class), cremated, or committed into the waters (Javanese: &quot;Larung&quot;). The upper-class performed sati, a suicide ritual by widowed wives, concubines or female servants, through self immolation by throwing themselves into flaming cremation fire.

In this record, Ma Huan also describes a musical troupe travelling during full moon nights. Numbers of people holding shoulders creating an unbroken line while singing and chanting in unison, while the families whose houses being visited would give them copper coins or gifts. He also describes a class of artisans that draws various images on paper and give a theatrical performance. The narrator tells the story of legends, tales and romance drawn upon a screen of rolled paper. This kind of performance is identified as &quot;wayang bébér&quot;, an art of story-telling that has survived for many centuries in Java.

Portuguese diplomat Tomé Pires, who visited the archipelago in 1512, recorded the culture of Java in the late Majapahit era, after his visit to the island between March and June 1513. Pires&#x27; account tells about the lords and nobles in Java. They are described as:

===Religion===
Buddhism, Shaivism, and Vaishnavism were all practised: the king was regarded as the incarnation of the three. The &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot; however, does not mention Islam, but there were certainly Muslim courtiers by this time.

Hinduism and Buddhism already shaped the Javanese civilisation, religion, and spiritualism since the earlier era, from the 9th century Mataram Kingdom, Kahuripan, Kadiri, to Singhasari kingdom. It seems that both Hinduism and Buddhism are widely practised by Majapahit subjects. Nevertheless, native Javanese shamanism possibly still exist and practised in peripheral rural regions.
The monarch and most of the royal family adhered to Hinduism, with certain emphasis on the cult of their own preferred main deity, either Shiva, Vishnu, Durga or other deities. The first king of Majapahit, Kertarajasa Jayawardhana was posthumously portrayed as Harihara, the god combination of Shiva and Vishnu, in his mortuary temple in Candi Simping. Mahayana Buddhism however, was also favoured by the royal family and officials of Majapahit. For example, the queen of Majapahit Gayatri Rajapatni and Gajah Mada are known as Buddhists. Gayatri later posthumously portrayed as Prajnaparamita.

The state religion however, was possibly the &quot;Siwa Buddha&quot;, the Javanese syncretism of Shaivism and Buddhism, which emphasise the similarity between Shiva and Buddha which both described as ascetics and spiritual teacher. The spiritual circumstances of Majapahit, seems to promote the harmony between the adherents of Shiva and Buddha. As demonstrated in the manuscript Sutasoma written in the 14th century by Mpu Tantular which promotes the religious tolerance between the Hinduism and Buddhism, specifically promote the syncretic Shiva-Buddha doctrine.

During the Majapahit period, religious teaching played an important role in the society. The religious education could be done individually within households of kshatriya nobles and brahmana religious elites, or in a centre for religious teaching which resembles ashram or boarding school called &quot;Mandala&quot; or &quot;Kadewaguruan&quot;. A &quot;Kadewaguruan&quot; was usually located in remote areas far from habitation places, such as quiet forest, on hills or mountainous region. A &quot;Kadewaguruan&quot; is led by a mahāresi or high priest, who is also known as śiddharesi or dewaguru; hence the education centre is called &quot;Kadewaguruan&quot;.

===Literature===
The literature of Majapahit was the continuation of Javanese Kawi Hindu-Buddhist scholarly tradition that produces &quot;kakawin&quot; poem that has been developed in Java since the 9th century Medang Mataram era, all the way through Kadiri and Singhasari periods. Notable Javanese literary works dated from an earlier period, such as Kadiri&#x27;s 11th century Kanwa&#x27;s Arjunawiwaha, 12th-century Dharmaja&#x27;s Smaradahana, Sedah&#x27;s Bharatayuddha, Panuluh&#x27;s Hariwangsa also popular Panji cycles are continuously preserved and rewritten by &quot;Rakawi&quot; (Hindu-Buddhist poet or scholar) in Majapahit era. Notable literary works that were produced in the Majapahit period among others are Prapanca&#x27;s Nagarakretagama, Tantular&#x27;s Sutasoma, and Tantu Pagelaran. Popular tale of Sri Tanjung and Damarwulan also dated from Majapahit period. These Old Javanese &quot;kakawins&quot; were written and composed by &quot;Rakawis&quot; (poets) to worship the king of the gods whose incarnation the king represented.

Nagarakretagama composed by Prapanca in 1365 is a vital source of the premier historical account of Majapahit historiography. While Sutasoma is an important literature for modern Indonesian nationhood, since the national motto &quot;Bhinneka Tunggal Ika&quot;, which is usually translated as &quot;Unity in Diversity&quot;, was taken from a &quot;pupuh&quot; (canto) of this manuscript.
This quotation comes from Sutasoma canto 139, stanza 5. The full stanza reads as follows:

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Rwâneka dhâtu winuwus Buddha Wiswa,&quot;
&quot;Bhinnêki rakwa ring apan kena parwanosen,&quot;
&quot;Mangka ng Jinatwa kalawan Siwatatwa tunggal,&quot;
&quot;Bhinnêka tunggal ika tan hana dharma mangrwa.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

Originally, the poem was meant to promote the religious tolerance between the Hindu and Buddhist religions, specifically promote the syncretic Shiva-Buddha doctrine.

In &quot;Yingya Shenglan&quot;, Ma Huan describes the writing system used in Majapahit. For the writing, they had known the alphabet using &quot;So-li&quot; (CholaCoromandel/Southern India) letters. There is no paper or pen, they use &quot;Chiao-chang&quot; (&quot;kajang&quot;) or palm leaf (&quot;lontar&quot;), written by scraping it with a sharp knife. They also have a developed language system and grammar.

===Art===
The Pala school of art of the Indian Pala Empire influenced the art and architecture of Majapahit.
Majapahit art was the continuation of East Javanese art, style and aesthetically developed since the 11th century during the Kediri and Singhasari period. Unlike the earlier naturalistic, relaxed and flowing figures of classical Central Java-style (Sailendra art c. 8th to 10th century), this East Javanese style demonstrates a stiffer pose, stylised and rendered in wayang-like figures, such as those carved on East Javanese temple&#x27;s bas-reliefs. The bas-reliefs were projected rather flat from the background. This style was later preserved in Balinese art, especially in its Kamasan style classical paintings and Balinese wayang.

The statues of Hindu gods and Buddhist deities in Majapahit art were also the continuations of its previous Singhasari art. The statues of East Javanese period tends to be a stiffer and frontal-formal pose, compared to the statues of Central Javanese art (c. 9th century) that are more Indianized style, relaxed in tribhanga pose. The stiffer pose of Majapahit gods statues is probably in accordance with the statue&#x27;s function as the deified portrayal self of the dead Majapahit monarch. The carving, however, is richly decorated, especially with a fine floral carving of lotus plants carved on the stela behind the statue. Examples of Majapahit statues are the Harihara statue from Simping temple, believed to be the deified portrayal of King Kertarajasa, the statue of Parwati believed to be the portrayal of Queen Tribhuwana, and a statue of the queen Suhita discovered at Jebuk, Kalangbret, Tulungagung, East Java.

Clay pottery and brick masonry are a popular feature in Majapahit art and architecture. The Majapahit Terracotta art also flourished in this period. Significant numbers of terracotta artefacts were discovered in Trowulan. The artefacts range from human and animal figurines, jars, vessels, water containers, piggy banks, bas reliefs, architectural ornaments, roof pinnacles, floor tiles, to pipes and roof tiles.

One of the most interesting findings is the Majapahit piggy bank. Several boar-shaped piggy banks have been discovered in Trowulan. It is probably the origin of Javanese-Indonesian word to refer for saving or money container. The word &quot;celengan&quot; in Javanese and Indonesian means both &quot;savings&quot; and &quot;piggy bank&quot;. It was derived from the word &quot;celeng&quot; which means &quot;wild boar&quot;, the suffix &quot;-an&quot; was added to denote its likeness. One important specimen is stored in the National Museum of Indonesia, it has been reconstructed since this large piggy bank has been found broken to pieces.

Terracotta money boxes also have been found in different shapes, such as tubular or boxes, with slits to slip coins. Another important terracotta artefact is the head figurine of a man popularly thought to be the depiction of Gajah Mada, although it is not certain about who was depicted in these figurines.

===Architecture===

In his book &quot;Yingya Shenglan&quot;, Ma Huan also describes the Majapahit cities: most of them do not have walls surrounding the city or the suburbs. He describes the king&#x27;s palace in Majapahit. The king&#x27;s residence is surrounded with thick red brick walls more than three &quot;chang&quot; high (about ), with length of more than 200 paces () and on the wall there are two layers of gates, the palace is very well guarded and clean. The king&#x27;s palace was a two-storey building, each of them 3 or 4 &quot;chang&quot; high (). It had wooden plank floors and exposed mats made from rattan or reeds (presumably palm leaves), where people sat cross-legged. The roof was made of hardwood shingles (Javanese: &quot;sirap&quot;) laid as tiles. This description of the palace is very different than that of Odoric of Pordenone, who visited Majapahit in the previous century during the reign of Jayanegara (1309–1328). The reason of this was because Ma Huan likely stayed at a special area reserved for envoys, which was still 1.5 days&#x27; journey away from the real Majapahit palace.

Odoric described the palace in more detail: The palace was described as being richer and finer than any existing palace at that time in the world. It had grand, broad, and lofty staircases; which the steps alternately made of gold and silver. The pavement of the palace was made alternately with one tile of gold and the other of silver, and the inside wall plated all over with gold, with knight sculptures of gold ornamented with precious stones. The ceiling of Majapahit palace was made of pure gold.

According to Ma Huan, the houses of commoners had thatched roofs (nipa palm leaves). Every family has a storage shed made of bricks, about 3 or 4 &quot;chi&quot; () above the ground, where they kept the family property, and they lived on top of this building, to sit and sleep. Not every house in Java looked like this: According to the &quot;History of the Song dynasty&quot;, houses in Java are grand and handsomethey are decorated with gold and jade. The chronicle also noted that when Chinese merchants arrive there they are received as guests in a public building. This indicates that Ma Huan had not yet arrived at the center of Majapahit capital, and was only observing the outskirts.

The Majapahit temple architecture follows the east Javanese styles, in contrast to earlier central Javanese style. This east Javanese temple style is also dated back from Kediri period c. 11th century. The shapes of Majapahit temples tend to be slender and tall, with a roof constructed from multiple parts of stepped sections formed a combined roof structure curved upward smoothly creating the perspective illusion that the temple is perceived taller than its actual height. The pinnacle of the temples are usually cube (mostly Hindu temples), sometimes dagoba cylindrical structures (Buddhist temples). Although some of the temples dated from Majapahit period used andesite or sandstone, the red bricks is also a popular construction material.

Although brick had been used in the &quot;candi&quot; of Indonesia&#x27;s classical age, it was Majapahit architects of the 14th and 15th centuries who mastered it. Making use of a vine sap and palm sugar mortar, their temples had a strong geometric quality. The example of Majapahit temples are Brahu temple in Trowulan, Pari in Sidoarjo, Jabung in Probolinggo, and Surawana temple near Kediri. Jabung temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Bajrajinaparamitapura, despite some parts of its roof and pinnacles are now missing, it is one of the most well-preserved Majapahit temple architecture. Another example includes Gunung Gangsir temple near Pasuruan. Some of the temples are dated from the earlier period but renovated and expanded during Majapahit era, such as Penataran, the largest temple in East Java dated back to Kediri era. This temple was identified in Nagarakretagama as Palah temple and reported being visited by King Hayam Wuruk during his royal tour across East Java. Another notable temple of Eastern Javanese style is Jawi temple in Pandaanalso visited by King Hayam Wuruk, the temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Jajawa, and was dedicated as a mortuary temple for his great-grandfather, King Kertanegara of Singhasari.

Some of the typical architectural styles are believed to be developed during Majapahit era; such as tall and slender roofed red brick gate commonly called as &quot;kori agung&quot; or &quot;paduraksa&quot;, and also split gate of &quot;candi bentar&quot;. The large split gate of Wringin Lawang located at Jatipasar, Trowulan, Mojokerto, East Java, is one of the oldest and the largest surviving &quot;candi bentar&quot; dated from Majapahit era. The &quot;candi bentar&quot; took shape of typical Majapahit temple structureconsists of three parts; foot, body and tall roofevenly split into two mirroring structures to make a passage in the centre for people to walk through. This type of split gate has no doors and provides no real defensive purpose but narrowing the passage. It probably only served the ceremonial and aesthetic purpose, to create the sense of grandeur, before entering the next compound through tall roof &quot;paduraksa&quot; gate with enclosed door. The example of &quot;kori agung&quot; or &quot;paduraksa&quot; style gate is the elegant Bajang Ratu gate richly decorated with Kala demon, cyclops and also the bas-relief telling the story of Sri Tanjung. Those typical Majapahit architectural style has deeply influenced the Javanese and Balinese architecture of later period. The current prevalence of Majapahit style pendopo pavilion, candi bentar and paduraksa gates was owed to the influence of Majapahit aesthetics on Javanese and Balinese architecture.
In later period near the fall of Majapahit, the art and architecture of Majapahit witnessed the revival of indigenous native Austronesian megalithic architectural elements, such as Sukuh and Cetho temples on western slopes of Mount Lawu. Unlike previous Majapahit temples that demonstrate typical Hindu architecture of high-rise towering structure, the shape of these temples are step pyramid, quite similar to Mesoamerican pyramids. The stepped pyramid structure called &quot;Punden Berundak&quot; (stepped mounds) is a common megalithic structure during Indonesian prehistoric era before the adoption of Hindu-Buddhist culture.

==Economy==
The &quot;Daoyi Zhi&quot;, which was written c. 1339 CE, mentioned about Java&#x27;s wealth and prosperity of the period:&quot;The fields of Java are rich and its soil is level and well watered, therefore grain and rice are abundant, twice as much as in other countries. The people do not steal, and what is dropped on the road is not taken up. The common saying: &quot;prosperous Java&quot; means this country. Men and women wrap up their head and wear long clothes.&quot;Also in &quot;Yingya Shenglan&quot;, Ma Huan reported the Javanese economy and market. Rice is harvested twice a year, and its grain is small. They also harvest white sesame and lentils, but there is no wheat. This land produces sapan wood (useful to produce red dye), diamonds, sandalwood, incense, &quot;puyang&quot; pepper, cantharides (green beetles used for medicine), steel, turtles, tortoiseshell, strange and rare birds; such as a large parrot as big as a hen, red and green parrots, five-colored parrots, (all of them can imitate the human voice), also guinea fowl, &#x27; bird hanging upside down &#x27;, five-coloured pigeon, peacock, &#x27;betel tree bird&#x27;, pearl bird, and green pigeons. The beasts here are strange: there are white deer, white monkey, and various other animals. Pigs, goats, cattle, horses, poultries, and there are all types of ducks, however donkeys and geese are not found.

For the fruits, there are all kinds of bananas, coconut, sugarcane, pomegranate, lotus, &quot;mang-chi-shi&quot; (&quot;manggis&quot; or mangosteen), watermelon and &quot;lang Ch&#x27;a&quot; (&quot;langsat&quot; or lanzones). &quot;Mang-chi-shi&quot;is something like a pomegranate, peel it like an orange, it has four lumps of white flesh, sweet and sour taste and very delicious. &quot;Lang-ch&#x27;a&quot; is a fruit similar to Loquat, but larger contained three blocky white flesh with a sweet and sour taste. Sugarcane has white stems, large and coarse, with roots reaching 3 &quot;chang&quot; (30 feet 7 inches). In addition, all types of squash and vegetables are there, just a shortage of peach, plum and leek.

Taxes and fines were paid in cash. Javanese economy had been partly monetised since the late 8th century, using gold and silver coins. Previously, the 9th-century Wonoboyo hoard discovered in Central Java shows that ancient Javan gold coins were seed-shaped, similar to corn, while the silver coins were similar to buttons. In about the year 1300, in the reign of Majapahit&#x27;s first king, an important change took place: the indigenous coinage was completely replaced by imported Chinese copper cash. About 10,388 ancient Chinese coins weighing about 40 kg were even unearthed from the backyard of a local commoner in Sidoarjo in November 2008. Indonesian Ancient Relics Conservation Bureau (BP3) of East Java verified that those coins dated as early as Majapahit era. The reason for using the foreign currency is not given in any source, but most scholars assume it was due to the increasing complexity of Javanese economy and a desire for a currency system that used much smaller denominations suitable for use in everyday market transactions. This was a role for which gold and silver are not well suited. These &quot;kepeng&quot; Chinese coins were thin rounded copper coins with a square hole in the centre of it. The hole was meant to tie together the money in a string of coins. These small changesthe imported Chinese copper coinsenabled Majapahit further invention, a method of savings by using a slitted earthenware coin container. These are commonly found in Majapahit ruins, the slit in the small opening to put the coins in. The most popular shape is boar-shaped &quot;celengan&quot; (piggy bank).

Some idea of the scale of the internal economy can be gathered from scattered data in inscriptions. The Canggu inscriptions dated 1358 mentions 78 ferry crossings in the country (mandala Java). Majapahit inscriptions mention a large number of occupational specialities, ranging from gold and silversmiths to drink vendors and butchers. Although many of these occupations had existed in earlier times, the proportion of the population earning an income from non-agrarian pursuits seems to have become even greater during the Majapahit era.

The great prosperity of Majapahit was probably due to two factors. Firstly, the northeast lowlands of Java were suitable for rice cultivation, and during Majapahit&#x27;s prime numerous irrigation projects were undertaken, some with government assistance. Secondly, Majapahit&#x27;s ports on the north coast were probably significant stations along the route to obtain the spices of Maluku, and as the spices passed through Java they would have provided an important source of income for Majapahit.

The Nagarakretagama states that the fame of the ruler of Wilwatikta (a synonym for Majapahit) attracted foreign merchants from far and wide, including Indians, Khmers, Siamese, and Chinese among others. While in the later period, &quot;Yingya Shenglan&quot; mentioned that large numbers of Chinese traders and Muslim merchants from the west (from Arabia and India, but mostly from Muslim states in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula) are settling in Majapahit port cities, such as Tuban, Gresik and Hujung Galuh (Surabaya). A special tax was levied against some foreigners, possibly those who had taken up semi-permanent residence in Java and conducted some type of enterprise other than foreign trade. The Majapahit Empire had trading links with Chinese Ming dynasty, Đại Việt and Champa in today Vietnam, Cambodia, Siamese Ayutthayan, Burmese Martaban and the south Indian Vijayanagara Empire.

During the Majapahit era, almost all of the commodities from Asia were found in Java. This is because of extensive shipping by the Majapahit empire using various type of ships, particularly the jong, for trading to faraway places. Ma Huan (Zheng He&#x27;s translator) who visited Java in 1413, stated that ports in Java were trading goods and offer services that were more numerous and more complete than other ports in Southeast Asia.

==Administration==
During the reign of Hayam Wuruk, Majapahit employed a well-organised bureaucratic structure for administrative purposes. The hierarchy and structure relatively remain intact and unchanged throughout Majapahit history. The king is the paramount ruler, as the chakravartin he is considered the universal ruler and believed to be the living god on earth. The king holds the highest political authority and legitimacy.

===Law and order===
The law and order of Majapahit kingdom follows the regulations related to the criminal code of law which became the guidelines for people&#x27;s lives at that time. This rule of law can be found in a manuscript called &quot;Kutaramanawa Dharmashastra&quot; or translated as &quot;the Book of Religious Legislation&quot;. According to the historian Slamet Muljana&#x27;s notes in the book &quot;Perundang-undangan Madjapahit&quot; (1967), there is no definite record regarding the time when this criminal law was drafted. However, based on some evidence, it can be concluded that this book of law written in old Javanese was originated from the Majapahit period during the reign of King Rajasanagara.

In Majapahit, the punishment for the crime of murder was death. According to the manuscript Kidung Sorandaka, it was said that Demung Sora, a minister of Majapahit court, was sentenced to death penalty under the &quot;Astadusta&quot; provisions for his crime on killing Mahisa Anabrang. &quot;Astadusta&quot; is a part of the &quot;Kutaramanawa Dharmashastra&quot; which regulates the punishment for murder. Overall, this criminal code consists of 19 sections that regulate various aspects of life. In addition to the punishment for the crime of murders which are summarised in the &quot;Astadusta&quot; section, there are also rules regarding buying and selling, debts, marriage, and pawnbroker. The punishments handed down included the death penalty, mutilation of the guilty body parts, fines and compensation. Additional penalties included ransom, confiscation, and money compensation for medication and drugs.

According to the Chinese description in &quot;Yingya Shenglan&quot;, when the one being stabbed was wounded and dead, the murderer will flee and hide for three days, then he will not lose his life. But if he was caught during the fight, he will instantly be stabbed to death (execution by stabbing). The country of Majapahit knows no caning for major or minor punishment. They tied the guilty men on his hands in the back with rattan rope and paraded them, and then stabbed the offender in the back where there is a floating rib which resulted in instant death. Judicial executions of this kind were frequent.

===Bureaucracy officials===
During his daily administration, the king is assisted by bureaucratic state officials that also included the close relatives of the kings that hold certain esteemed titles. The royal order or edict usually transmitted from the king to the high officials well to their subordinates. The officials in Majapahit courts are:
:* &quot;Rakryan Mahamantri Katrini&quot;, usually reserved for the king&#x27;s heir
:* &quot;Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran&quot;, the board of ministers that conduct the daily administration
:* &quot;Dharmmadhyaksa&quot;, the officials of laws, state laws as well as religious laws
:* &quot;Dharmma-upapatti&quot;, the officials concerning religious affairs

Within the ministers of &quot;Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran&quot; there is the most important and the highest minister titled &quot;Rakryan Mapatih&quot; or &quot;Patih Hamangkubhumi&quot;. This position is analogous to prime minister, and together with the king, they determine the important state policies, including war or peace. Among the Dharmmadhyaksa officials, there is &quot;Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasewan&quot; (State&#x27;s highest Hindu Shivaist priest) and &quot;Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasogatan&quot; (State&#x27;s highest Buddhist priest), both are the authorities of the religious law of each dharmic faiths.

There is also the board of advisors which consists of the elders within the royal family called &quot;Bhattara Saptaprabhu&quot;. This council consists of seven influential eldersmostly directly related to the king. They are the &quot;Bhres&quot; (Duke or Duchess) acted as regional kings, the rulers of Majapahit provinces. This council congregates, offers advice, considered the king, and often formed an assembly to judge a certain important case in the court. Example of their office was, their sentence to temporarily suspend Mahamantri Gajah Mada, as a punishment since he was held responsible for the shamefully disastrous Bubat incident. The council also sentenced the execution of Raden Gajah (Narapati) for decapitating Bhre Wirabhumi in Regreg war.

===Territorial hierarchy===

Majapahit recognise the hierarchy classifications of lands within its realm:
:#&quot;Bhumi&quot;: the kingdom, ruled by the king
:#&quot;Nagara&quot;: the province, ruled by the &quot;rajya&quot; (governor), or &quot;natha&quot; (lord), or &quot;bhre&quot; (prince or duke)
:#&quot;Watek&quot;: the regency, administered by &quot;wiyasa&quot;,
:#&quot;Kuwu&quot;: the district, administered by &quot;lurah&quot;,
:#&quot;Wanua&quot;: the village, administered by &quot;thani&quot;,
:#&quot;Kabuyutan&quot;: the hamlet or sanctuary place.

During its formation, Majapahit traditional realm only consists of lesser vassal kingdoms (provinces) in eastern and central Java. This region is ruled by provincial kings called &quot;Paduka Bhattara&quot; with the title &quot;Bhre&quot;, shortened form of &quot;Bhatara i&quot; (Bhatara of). This title is the highest position below the monarch and similar to duke or duchess. Usually, this position reserved for the close relatives of the king. They have to administer their provinces, collect taxes, send annual tributes to the capital, and manage the defences of their borders.

During the reign of Dyah Hayam Wuruk (formally King Rajasanagara; 1350–1389) there were 12 provinces of Majapahit, administered by king&#x27;s close relatives:
 List of Majapahit provinces administered by the king&#x27;s relatives based on Waringin Pitu inscription (1447) written during the reign of Dyah Kertawijaya (formally King Wijayaparakramawardhana).
===Territorial division===

When Majapahit entered the thalassocracy imperial phase during the administration of Gajah Mada, several overseas vassal states were included within the Majapahit sphere of influence, as a result, the new larger territorial concept was defined:

* Negara Agung, or the Grand State, the core kingdom. The traditional or initial area of Majapahit during its formation before entering the imperial phase. This includes the capital city and the surrounding areas where the king effectively exercises his government. The area in and around royal capital of Trowulan, the port of Canggu and sections of Brantas River valley near the capital, also mountainous areas south and southeast of the capital, all the way to Pananggungan and Arjuno-Welirang peaks, are the core realm of the kingdom. The Brantas river valley corridor, connecting Majapahit Trowulan area to Canggu and estuarine areas in Kahuripan (Sidoarjo) and Hujung Galuh port (Surabaya) are considered parts of &quot;Negara Agung&quot;.
* Mancanegara, areas surrounding &quot;Negara Agung&quot;traditionally refer to Majapahit provinces in East and Central Java. This area covered the eastern half of Java, with all its provinces ruled by the &quot;Bhres&quot; (dukes), the king&#x27;s close relatives. These areas are directly influenced by Javanese Majapahit court culture and obliged to pay annual tributes. These areas usually possess their rulers that might be directly related, foster an alliance or intermarried with the Majapahit royal family. Majapahit stationed their officials and officers in these places and regulate their foreign trade activities and collect taxes, yet they enjoyed substantial internal autonomy. This includes the rest of Java island, Madura and Bali. However, in the later period, overseas provinces which have developed culture reflected or comparable to those of Java, or possess significant trading importance, are also considered &quot;mancanegara&quot;. Either the province has its own native rulers subject (vassal) to the king, or a regent appointed and sent by the king to rule the region. This realm includes Dharmasraya, Pagaruyung, Lampung and Palembang in Sumatra.
* Nusantara, areas which do not reflect Javanese culture, but are included as colonies and they had to pay an annual tribute. They had their native polity intact, enjoyed substantial autonomy and internal freedom, and Majapahit did not necessarily station their officials or military officers here; however, any challenges on Majapahit oversight might draw a severe response. These areas such as the vassal kingdoms and colonies in the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Lesser Sunda Islands, Sulawesi and Maluku.
Nagarakretagama mentioned more than 80 places in the archipelago described as the vassal states. In Canto 13, several lands on Sumatra are mentioned, and some possibly correspond to contemporary areas: Jambi, Palembang, Teba (either Tebo in Jambi or Toba areas by Lake Toba), and Dharmasraya. Also mentioned are Kandis, Kahwas, Minangkabau, Siak, Rokan, Kampar and Pane, Kampe, Haru (coastal North Sumatra, today around Medan) and Mandailing. Tamiyang (Aceh Tamiang Regency), negara Perlak (Peureulak) and Padang Lawas, are noted in the west, together with Samudra (Samudra Pasai) and Lamuri, Batan (Bintan), Lampung, and Barus. Also listed are the states of Tanjungnegara (believed to be on Borneo): Kapuas Katingan, Sampit, Kota Lingga, Kotawaringin, Sambas, and Lawas.

In Nagarakretagama Canto 14 more lands are noted: Kadandangan, Landa, Samadang, Tirem, Sedu (Sibu in Sarawak), Barune (Brunei), Kalka, Saludung (Serudong River in Sabah), Solot (Sulu), Pasir, Barito, Sawaku, Tabalung, and Tanjung Kutei. In Hujung Medini (Malay Peninsula), Pahang is mentioned first. Next Langkasuka, Saimwang, Kelantan and Trengganu, Johor, Paka, Muar, Dungun, Tumasik (Temasek, where Singapore is today), Kelang (Klang Valley) and Kedah, Jerai (Gunung Jerai), Kanjapiniran, all are united.

Also in Canto 14 are territories east of Java: Badahulu and Lo Gajah (part of today&#x27;s Bali). Gurun and Sukun, Taliwang, Sapi (Sape town, east end of Sumbawa island, by the Sape Strait) and Dompo, Sang Hyang Api, Bima. Sheran and Hutan Kadali (Buru island). Gurun island, and Lombok Merah. Together with prosperous Sasak (central, north and east Lombok) are already ruled. Bantayan with Luwu. Further east are Udamakatraya (Sangir and Talaud). Also mentioned are Makassar, Buton, Banggai, Kunir, Galiao with Selayar, Sumba, Solot, Muar. Also Wanda(n) (Banda island), Ambon or Maluku islands, Kai Islands, Wanin (Onin Peninsula, today Fakfak Regency, West Papua), Sran, Timor and other islands.
The true nature of Majapahit suzerainty is still a subject of study and even has sparked controversy. Nagarakretagama describes Majapahit as the centre of a huge mandala consists of 98 tributaries stretching from Sumatra to New Guinea. Some scholars have discounted this claim as merely a sphere of limited influence, or even just a statement of geographical knowledge.

Nevertheless, the Javanese overseas prestige and influence during the lifetime of Hayam Wuruk was undoubtedly considerable. Majapahit fleets must have periodically visited many places in the archipelago to acquire formal submission, or the splendour of Majapahit court might have attracted regional rulers to send a tribute, without any intention to submit to Majapahit&#x27;s order.

All of those three categoriesthe &quot;Negara Agung, Mancanegara&quot; and &quot;Nusantara&quot;, were within the sphere of influence of the Majapahit empire.

The model of political formations and power diffusion from its core in the Majapahit capital city that radiates through its overseas possessions was later identified by historians as &quot;mandala&quot; model. The term mandala derived from Sanskrit &quot;circle&quot; to explain the typical ancient Southeast Asian polity that was defined by its centre rather than its boundaries, and it could be composed of numerous other tributary polities without undergoing administrative integration. The territories belongs within Majapahit Mandala sphere of influence were those categorised as Mancanegara and Nusantara. These areas usually have their indigenous rulers, enjoy substantial autonomy and have their political institution intact without further integration into Majapahit administration. The same mandala model also applied to previous empires; Srivijaya and Angkor, and also Majapahit&#x27;s neighbouring mandalas; Ayutthaya and Champa.

Foreign or overseas territories are mentioned in Nagarakretagama canto 15 stanza 1. These territories include Syangka (Siam), Ayodyapura (Ayutthaya), Dharmmanagari (Ligor), Marutma (Martaban or Mergui), Rajapura (Rajpuri in the south of Siam), Singhanagari (Singhapuri on the branch of the river Menam), Campa, and Kamboja (Cambodia). The relationship between Majapahit and these territories is called &quot;kachaya&quot;, which means &quot;to be exposed to light&quot;. It is interpreted as protected or sheltered. The term &quot;protected area&quot; in the modern state system is referred to as a protectorate.

In addition, in canto 83 stanza 4 and 93 stanza 1 are mentioned the places that became the origin of merchants and scholars. The regions are Jambudwipa (India), Cina, Karnataka (South India), and Goda (Gauḍa). What is different is Yawana (Arabs, see explanation), as mentioned &quot;anyat i yawana mitreka satata&quot; (different is Yawana who is a permanent ally).

The question whether Majapahit is considered an empire or not is actually depends on the definition of the word and concept of &quot;empire&quot; itself. Majapahit did not performed direct administration of its overseas possessions, they did not maintain permanent military occupation, and did not imposes its political and cultural norms over a wide area; thus it is not sufficiently considered an empire in a traditional sense. However, if being an empire means the projection of military power at will, formal acknowledgement of overlordship by vassals, and the regular tribute delivery to the capital, then Java&#x27;s relationship to the rest of archipelagic realm can well be considered an imperial one; thus Majapahit can be considered an empire.

In later period, Majapahit&#x27;s hold on its overseas possessions began to wane. According to Waringin Pitu inscription (dated 1447) it was mentioned that Majapahit&#x27;s core realm was consisted of 14 provinces, that administrated by the ruler titled &quot;Bhre&quot;. The provinces written in the inscription are:

* Daha (former capital of Kediri)
* Jagaraga
* Kabalan
* Kahuripan (or Janggala, modern Surabaya)
* Keling
* Kelinggapura
* Kembang Jenar
* Matahun (today Bojonegoro)
* Pajang (today Surakarta)
* Singhapura
* Tanjungpura
* Tumapel (former capital of Singhasari)
* Wengker (today Ponorogo)
* Wirabhumi (today Blambangan)
The inscription, however, did not mention Majapahit&#x27;s vassals in other areas around the period, such as:
* Indragiri in Sumatra and Siantan (now in Pontianak in the west coast of Borneo), which according to the Malay Annals, were given as a dowry to Malacca for the marriage of a Majapahit princess and Mansur Shah sometime during his reign. Sultan Mansur Shah reigned from 1459 to 1477, which implies that Indragiri and Siantan were both still under Majapahit&#x27;s control in 1447.
* Jambi and Palembang, which only ceased to be under Majapahit suzerainty when seized by Demak.
* And Bali, which were known to be the last stronghold of the Hindu-Javanese civilization during Majapahit&#x27;s downfall.
The book &quot;Suma Oriental&quot; by Tomé Pires written in 1515 records that Java (Majapahit) ruled as far as the Moluccas on the east side and most of the west side of the archipelago; and almost the whole island of Sumatra was under its control and also controlled all the islands known to the Javanese. Majapahit ruled over these for a long time until about a hundred years earlier, when its power began to wane until it became similar to that during the year of Pires&#x27; visit to Java (March–June 1513).

==Military==

The army of Majapahit was divided into 2 main types, namely &quot;prajurit&quot; (professional soldier) and levy taken up from peasants. The main weapon used was the spear. Initially, cavalry only existed in limited numbers. They were mainly used for scouting and patrol, and were most likely armed with lances. After the Mongol invasion, the use of horses became more widespread in Java, especially for war. Chariots are used for transporting soldiers to the battlefield and were &quot;parked&quot; before the battle. Some chariots were indeed used in battle, for example, the prime minister Nambi rode a chariot and served as an archer in the Rangga Lawe rebellion (1295 CE). Gajah Mada also rode in a chariot when attacking Sundanese troops in the Bubat battle (1357). Chariots were carved at the Penataran Temple, seemingly modeled from the real world. War elephants were used mainly for transport, or as a mount for nobility and soldiers of higher rank.

Majapahit had 30,000 full-time professional troops, whose soldiers and commanders were paid in gold. This shows the existence of a standing army, an achievement that only a handful of Southeast Asian empires could hope to achieve. In addition to these professional soldiers, Majapahit was strengthened by troops from subordinate countries and regional leaders. From the records of &quot;Suma Oriental&quot; and Malay Annals, the total number of Majapahit troops could reach 200,000 people. The Majapahit troops were multiethnic, similar to the Yogyakarta Sultanate military which had Bugis and Dhaeng (Makassar) troops. As noted in &quot;Hikayat Raja-Raja Pasai&quot;:So the two parties returned to their respective places. That was how the war went on every day, for about three months, the war was unrelenting, because the Javanese kingdom also received help from foreign lands.

Gunpowder technology entered Java in the Mongol invasion of Java (1293 A.D.). Majapahit under &quot;Mahapatih&quot; (prime minister) Gajah Mada utilized gunpowder technology obtained from the Yuan dynasty for use in the naval fleet. During the following years, the Majapahit army have begun producing cannons known as cetbang. Early cetbang (also called eastern-style cetbang) resembled Chinese cannons and hand cannons. Eastern-style cetbangs were mostly made of bronze and were front-loaded cannons. It fires arrow-like projectiles, but round bullets and co-viative projectiles can also be used. These arrows can be solid-tipped without explosives, or with explosives and incendiary materials placed behind the tip. Near the rear, there is a combustion chamber or room, which refers to the bulging part near the rear of the gun, where the gunpowder is placed. The cetbang is mounted on a fixed mount, or as a hand cannon mounted on the end of a pole. There is a tube-like section on the back of the cannon. In the hand cannon-type cetbang, this tube is used as a socket for a pole.

Because of the close maritime relations of the Nusantara archipelago with the territory of west India, after 1460 new types of gunpowder weapons entered the archipelago through Arab intermediaries. This weapon seems to be cannon and gun of Ottoman tradition, for example the prangi, which is a breech-loading swivel gun. It resulted in a new type of cetbang, called &quot;western-style cetbang&quot;. It can be mounted as a fixed or swivel gun, small-sized ones can be easily installed on small vessels. In naval combat, this gun is used as an anti-personnel weapon, not anti-ship. In this age, even to the 17th century, Nusantaran soldiers fought on a platform called &quot;balai&quot; and performed boarding actions. Loaded with scatter shots (grapeshot, case shot, or nails and stones) and fired at close range, the cetbang would have been effective at this type of fighting.

Majapahit had elite troops called &quot;Bhayangkara&quot;. The main task of these troops is for protecting the king and nobilities, but they may also be deployed to the battlefield if required. The Hikayat Banjar noted the &quot;Bhayangkara&quot; equipments in the Majapahit palace:

&quot;Maka kaluar dangan parhiasannya orang barbaju-rantai ampat puluh sarta padangnya barkupiah taranggos sakhlat merah, orang mambawa astenggar ampat puluh, orang mambawa parisai sarta padangnya ampat puluh, orang mambawa dadap sarta sodoknya sapuluh, orang mambawa panah sarta anaknya sapuluh, yang mambawa tumbak parampukan barsulam amas ampat puluh, yang mambawa tameng Bali bartulis air mas ampat puluh.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
So came out with their ornaments men with chain mail numbered forty alongside their swords and red &quot;kopiah&quot; [skull cap], men carrying &quot;astengger&quot; [arquebus] numbered forty, men carrying shield and swords numbered forty, men carrying &quot;dadap&quot; [a type of shield] and &quot;sodok&quot; [broad-bladed spear-like weapon] numbered ten, men carrying bows and arrows numbered ten, (men) who carried &quot;parampukan&quot; spears embroidered with gold numbered forty, (men) who carried Balinese shields with golden water engraving numbered forty.&lt;br&gt; Hikayat Banjar, 6.3

Military forces in various parts of Southeast Asia were lightly armored. As was common in Southeast Asia, most of the Javanese forces were composed of temporarily conscripted commoners (levy) led by the warrior and noble castes. The &quot;peasant army&quot; was usually bare-chested wearing a &quot;sarung&quot;, armed with spear, short sword, or bow and arrows. The richer (higher rank) soldiers wore armor called &quot;kawaca&quot;. Irawan Djoko Nugroho argues that it may be shaped like a long tube and was made of cast copper. In contrast, the regular infantry (professional soldiers, not the levy) wore a scale armor called &quot;siping-siping&quot;. There is also a kind of steel helmet called &quot;rukuh&quot;. Other kinds of armor used in Majapahit-era Java was &quot;waju rante&quot; (chain mail armor) and &quot;karambalangan&quot; (a layer of metal worn in front of the chest). In Kidung Sunda canto 2 stanza 85 it is explained that the &quot;mantri&quot;s (ministers or officers) of Gajah Mada wore armor in the form of chain mail or breastplate with gold decoration and dressed in yellow attire, while Kidung Sundayana canto 1 stanza 95 mentioned that Gajah Mada wore golden embossed &quot;karambalangan&quot;, armed with gold-layered spear, and with a shield full of diamond decoration.

Majapahit also pioneered the use of firearms in the archipelago. Even though the knowledge of making gunpowder-based weapons has been known after the failed Mongol invasion of Java, and the predecessor of firearms, the pole gun (bedil tombak) was recorded by Ma Huan in his &quot;Yingya Shenlan&quot; as being used by the Javanese for marriage ceremony in 1413, the knowledge of making &quot;true&quot; firearms came much later, after the middle of the 15th century. It was brought by the Islamic nations of West Asia, most probably the Arabs. The precise year of introduction is unknown, but it may be safely concluded to be no earlier than 1460.

&quot;Xingcha Shenglan&quot; (星槎勝覽) written by Fei Xin c. 1436 stated that Java (Majapahit) is equipped with armored soldiers and equipment, and it is the center of the Eastern people. &quot;Haiguo Guangji&quot; (海国广记) and &quot;Shuyu zhouzi lu&quot; (殊域周咨錄) recorded that Java is vast and densely populated, and their armored soldiers and hand cannons (火銃—huǒ chòng) dominated the Eastern Seas.

Tomé Pires&#x27; 1513 account tells the army of Gusti Pati (Patih Udara), viceroy of &quot;Batara Vojyaya&quot; (probably Brawijaya or Ranawijaya), numbered 200,000 men, 2,000 of which are horsemen and 4,000 musketeers. Duarte Barbosa ca. 1514 recorded that the inhabitants of Java are great masters in casting artillery and very good artillerymen. They make many one-pounder cannons (cetbang or rentaka), long muskets, &quot;spingarde&quot; (arquebus), &quot;schioppi&quot; (hand cannon), Greek fire, guns (cannons), and other fire-works. Every place is considered excellent in casting artillery, and in the knowledge of using it.

The first true cavalry (organized units of cooperative horsemen) in Java may have appeared during the 12th century CE. The old Javanese manuscript &quot;kakawin Bhomāntaka&quot; mentioned early Javanese horse lore and horsemanship. The manuscript may reflect the conflict (allegorically) between the newly formed Javanese cavalry and the well-established elite infantry of Javanese armies. In the 14th century CE, Java became an important horse breeder and the island was even listed among horse suppliers to China. During the Majapahit period, the quantity and quality of Javanese horse breeds steadily grew. In 1513 CE Tomé Pires praised the highly decorated horses of Javanese nobility, complemented by gold-studded stirrups and lavishly decorated saddles that were &quot;not found anywhere else in the world&quot;. The Sumbawa pony seems to have been derived from the Javanese domesticated horse introduced by Majapahit in the 14th century CE.

Majapahit had a naval troops that was distinguished from ground troop units, which was called &quot;wwang jaladhi&quot;. Naval troops get preferential treatment in terms of facilities. Majapahit navy personnel were large, as noted Nagarakretagama canto 16 stanza 5:




The main warship of the Majapahit navy was the jong. The jongs were large transport ships that could carry 100–2000 tons of cargo and 50–1000 people. They are about 26.36–80.51 m in LOD (deck length) and 28.99–88.56 m in LOA (overall length). A jong from 1420 nearly crossed the Atlantic Ocean. A type of large nine-decked jong that was recorded in &quot;Kidung&quot; &quot;Panji Wijayakrama-Rangga Lawe&quot; (c. 1334) was called &quot;jong sasangawangunan&quot;, it carried 1000 fighting men with red sails. The exact number of jongs fielded by Majapahit is unknown, but the largest number of jongs deployed in an expedition was about 400 jongs when Majapahit attacked Pasai. The average jong used by Majapahit would be about 76.18–79.81 m LOA, carrying 600–700 men, with 1200–1400 tons deadweight. Before the Battle of Bubat in 1357, the Sunda king and the royal family arrived in Majapahit after sailing across the Java Sea in a fleet of 200 large ships and 2000 smaller vessels. The royal family boarded a nine-decked hybrid Sino-Southeast Asian junk (Old Javanese: &quot;Jong sasanga wangunan&quot; &quot;ring Tatarnagari tiniru&quot;). This hybrid junk incorporated Chinese techniques, such as using iron nails alongside wooden dowels, the construction of watertight bulkheads, and the addition of a central rudder. Besides that, other types of vessels used by Majapahit navy are malangbang, kelulus, pelang, jongkong, cerucuh, and tongkang. In the 16th century lancaran and penjajap are also used. Modern depictions of the Majapahit navy often depict outrigger ships, in reality, these ships were from 8th-century Borobudur ship bas relief. Research by Nugroho concluded that the main vessels used by Majapahit did not use outriggers, and using Borobudur engraving as the basis for reconstructing the Majapahit ship is wrong and misleading.

== Explorations and navigation ==
During the Majapahit era, Nusantaran exploration reached its greatest accomplishment. Ludovico di Varthema (1470–1517), in his book &quot;Itinerario de Ludouico de Varthema Bolognese&quot; stated that the Southern Javanese people sailed to &quot;far Southern lands&quot; up to the point they arrived at an island where a day only lasted four hours long and was &quot;colder than in any part of the world&quot;. Modern studies have determined that such place is located at least 900 nautical miles (1666 km) south of the southernmost point of Tasmania.

The Javanese people, like other Austronesian ethnicities, use a solid navigation system: Orientation at sea is carried out using a variety of different natural signs, and by using a very distinctive astronomy technique called &quot;star path navigation&quot;. Basically, the navigators determine the bow of the ship to the islands that are recognized by using the position of rising and setting of certain stars above the horizon. In the Majapahit era, compasses and magnets were used, and cartography (mapping science) was developed. In 1293 CE Raden Wijaya presented a map and census record to the Yuan Mongol invader, suggesting that mapmaking has been a formal part of governmental affairs in Java. The use of maps full of longitudinal and transverse lines, rhumb lines, and direct route lines traveled by ships were recorded by Europeans, to the point that the Portuguese considered the Javanese maps were the best map in the early 1500s.

When Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Malacca (1511), the Portuguese recovered a chart from a Javanese maritime pilot, which already included part of the Americas. Regarding the chart Albuquerque said:
&quot;...a large map of a Javanese pilot, containing the Cape of Good Hope, Portugal and the land of Brazil, the Red Sea and the Sea of Persia, the Clove Islands, the navigation of the Chinese and the Gores, with their rhumbs and direct routes followed by the ships, and the hinterland, and how the kingdoms border on each other. It seems to me. Sir, that this was the best thing I have ever seen, and Your Highness will be very pleased to see it; it had the names in Javanese writing, but I had with me a Javanese who could read and write. I send this piece to Your Highness, which Francisco Rodrigues traced from the other, in which Your Highness can truly see where the Chinese and Gores come from, and the course your ships must take to the Clove Islands, and where the gold mines lie, and the islands of Java and Banda, of nutmeg and mace, and the land of the King of Siam, and also the end of the land of the navigation of the Chinese, the direction it takes, and how they do not navigate farther.&quot;

:— Letter of Albuquerque to King Manuel I of Portugal, 1 April 1512.Duarte Barbosa mention places and route which the Majapahit ships visited, which include Maluku Islands, Timor, Banda, Sumatra, Malacca, China, Tenasserim, Pegu (Bago), Bengal, Pulicat, Coromandel, Malabar, Cambay (Khambat), and Aden. From the notes of other authors, it is known that there were also those who went to the Maldives, Calicut (Kozhikode), Oman, Aden, and the Red Sea. The passenger brought their wives and children, even some of them never leave the ship to go on shore, nor have any other dwelling, for they are born and die in the ship.

==Relations with regional powers==

For several centuriessince the era of Srivijaya and Medang Mataram (circa 10th century), the classic rivalry between Sumatran Malay states and Javanese kingdoms has shaped the dynamics of geopolitics in the region.
Their activities in guarding the sea in pursuit of their economic interest, plus their military activities to safeguard this interests, has led to conflicts between Malays and Javanese. Since early of its formation, Majapahit inherited the foreign outlook of its predecessor entity – Singhasari kingdom, in which its last king Kertanegara projected his influence abroad by launching Pamalayu expedition (1275–1293) to incorporate Malay polities in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula within Javanese sphere of influence. Previously, Singhasari seeks to dominate trade route, especially Malacca strait, and also saw the outreach of Mongolian-Chinese Yuan influence into Southeast Asia as the threat to their interest. During its formation, the returning Pamalayu expedition in 1293 has brought Malayu Kingdoms in Jambi and Dharmasraya under Javanese suzerainty. Therefore, Java often considers itself as the overlord of most of the polities in the Indonesian archipelago.

During the reign of Majapahit&#x27;s first two monarchWijaya and Jayanegara, the kingdom struggled to consolidate its rule, plagued by several rebellions. However, it was not until the reign of its third monarchQueen Tribhuwana Tunggadewi, and her son, Hayam Wurukthat the kingdom began to project its power overseas. Majapahit&#x27;s confidence for dominance was stemmed for their economic and demographic comparative advantage; agrarian as well as a maritime nation; their large rice production, immense human resources, well-organized society, also their mastery in shipbuilding, navigation and military technology; are excellent relatively compared to their neighbours. These strengths were used by Gajah Mada to expand the kingdom&#x27;s influence and building a maritime empire. This rather imperialistic outlook has projected in the way he forcefully dealt with Majapahit&#x27;s neighbours; the Pabali (conquest of Bali, 1342–1343) and the Pasunda Bubat (1356). Majapahit pulled Bali into their orbit as a vassal state. While the disastrous diplomacy with the Sunda kingdom has led to the enmity among them.
Majapahit overlordship upon Malay states of Sumatra was demonstrated by the rule of Adityawarman of Malayupura. Adityawarman, the cousin of King Jayanegara, was raised within Majapahit palace and rose to become a senior minister in Majapahit court. He was sent to led Majapahit military expansion to conquer east coast region in Sumatra. Adityawarman then founded the royal dynasty of Minangkabau in Pagarruyung and presided over the central Sumatra region to take control of the gold trade between 1347 and 1375.

Within Indonesian archipelago, Majapahit saw itself as the centre of a huge mandala. This notion is demonstrated by its three-tier administrative hierarchy; Nagara Agung, Mancanegara, and Nusantara.

In Sumatran front, Majapahit did capture Palembang, Jambi and Dharmasraya, invade Pasai, and it also saw the settlement of Tumasik, that later become Kingdom of Singapura, as its rebellious colony, and thus deal with them accordingly.

In later years after the era of Hayam Wuruk, Majapahit has lost their grips on some of their overseas possessions. This led to the thrive and the rise of several polities previously held under Majapahit domination, such as Brunei and Malacca. The rise of Malacca in the 15th century, in particular, is important, because it represents Majapahit eventual failure to control Malacca strait. Previously Majapahit tried to contain the rise of a potential regional rival; a Malay polity in par with Srivijaya, by punishing a rebellion in Palembang and capturing Singapura. In this sense, Malacca was indeed the rival of Majapahit in the competition to dominate the archipelagic realm. Despite this perceived rivalry, in practice, however, the two kingdoms had some close and intense economic and cultural relations. At that time, the trade link between Majapahit ports of Hujung Galuh and Tuban with the port of Melaka must have thrived.
Majapahit true rival for domination, however, was the powerful Ming Chinese. After the fall of Yuan, the Ming Emperor eager to project his power into Southeast Asia. On the other hand, Majapahit saw this archipelagic realm as theirs and unwelcome to any perceived Chinese interference. After Majapahit was weakened by Paregreg civil war, and incessant conflicts among its nobles, the arrival of the formidable Ming treasure voyages led by Zheng He upon Majapahit shores has pushed Majapahit prestige and power to the side. Ming on the other hand, actively support the rise of Malacca. This Ming protection has made Majapahit unwilling and unable to push Malacca anymore.

Majapahit ultimate nemesis, however, was located very close at home; the Demak Sultanate on the northern coast of Central Java. Ming support to Malacca, and Malacca active proselytizing of Islam, has led to the thriving and rise of Muslim traders community in the archipelago, including in Majapahit ports on the north coast of Java. This in turn gradually corroded the prestige of Javanese Hindu-Buddhist kingship, and after several generations, led to the fall of once-mighty Majapahit empire.

==Legacy==

Majapahit was the largest empire ever to form in Southeast Asia. Although its political power beyond the core area in east Java was diffuse, constituting mainly ceremonial recognition of suzerainty, Majapahit society developed a high degree of sophistication in both commercial and artistic activities. Its capital was inhabited by a cosmopolitan population among whom literature and art flourished.

Numbers of local legends and folklores in the region had mentioned about the Majapahit kingdom. Other than Javanese sources, some regional legends mentioning Majapahit kingdom or its general Gajah Mada also can be found; from Aceh, Minangkabau, Palembang, the Malay Peninsula, Sunda, Brunei, Bali to Sumbawa. Most of them mentioned about the incoming Javanese forces to their land, which was probably a local testament of the empire&#x27;s expansive nature that once dominating the archipelago. The Hikayat Raja Pasai, a 14th-century Aceh chronicle tell a Majapahit naval invasion against Samudra Pasai in 1350. The chronicle described that the Majapahit invasion was a punishment for Sultan Ahmad Malik Az-Zahir&#x27;s crime on ruining a royal marriage between Pasai Prince Tun Abdul Jalil and Raden Galuh Gemerencang, a Majapahit princessthat led to the death of the royal couple. 

In West Sumatra, the legend of Minangkabau mentioned an invading foreign princeassociated with Javanese Majapahit kingdombeing defeated in a buffalo fight. In West Java, the Pasunda Bubat tragedy caused a myth to revolve around Indonesians, which forbids marriage between a Sundanese and a Javanese, as it would be unsustainable and only bring misery to the couple. In Malay Peninsula, the Malay Annals mentioned the legend of the fall of Singapura to Majapahit forces in 1398 was due to the betrayal of Sang Rajuna Tapa that opened the fortified city gate. In Brunei, the folk legend of Lumut Lunting and Pilong-Pilongan islands in Brunei Bay also connected to Majapahit.

Several Javanese legends were originated or become popular during the Majapahit period. The Panji cycles, the tale of Sri Tanjung, and the epic of Damarwulan, are popular tales in Javanese and Balinese literatures. The tales of Panji was dated from the older period during Kediri kingdom, while the tale of Sri Tanjung and the epic of Damarwulan took place during the Majapahit period. These tales remained a popular theme in Javanese culture of later period during Mataram Sultanate, and often became the source of inspiration for wayang shadow puppet performance, ketoprak and topeng dance drama. The Panji tales, in particular, have spread from East Java to become a source of inspiration for literature and dance drama throughout the region, as far as the Malay Peninsula, Cambodia and Siam where he is known as Raden Inao or Enau () of Kurepan.

Majapahit had a momentous and lasting influence on Indonesian art and architecture. The empire&#x27;s expansion circa 14th-century contributed to the diffusion Javanese cultural influence throughout the archipelago, which can be seen as a form of Javanisation. It was probably during this period that some of the Javanese cultural elements, such as gamelan and kris, being expanded and introduced to islands outside of Java. The descriptions of the architecture of the capital&#x27;s pavilions (&quot;pendopo&quot;) in the &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot; evoke the Javanese Kraton also the Balinese temples and palace compounds of today. The Majapahit architectural style that often employs terracotta and red brick heavily influenced the architecture of Java and Bali in the later period. The Majapahit style &quot;candi bentar&quot; split gate, the &quot;kori&quot; or &quot;paduraksa&quot; towering red-brick gate, and also &quot;pendopo&quot; pavilion have become ubiquitous in Javanese and Balinese architectural features, as seen in Menara Kudus Mosque, Keraton Kasepuhan and Sunyaragi park in Cirebon, Mataram Sultanate royal cemetery in Kota Gede, Yogyakarta, and various palaces and temples in Bali.

The vivid, rich and festive Balinese culture is considered one of Majapahit&#x27;s legacy. The Javanese Hindu civilisation since the era of Airlangga to the era of Majapahit kings has profoundly influenced and shaped the Balinese culture and history. The ancient links and Majapahit legacy is observable in many ways; architecture, literature, religious rituals, dance-drama and artforms. The aesthetics and style of bas-reliefs in Majapahit East Javanese temples were preserved and copied in Balinese temples. It is also because, after the fall of the empire, many Majapahit nobles, artisans and priests had taken refuge either in the interior mountainous region of East Java or across the narrow strait to Bali. Indeed, in some ways, the Kingdom of Bali was the successor of Majapahit. Large numbers of Majapahit manuscripts, such as Nagarakretagama, Sutasoma, Pararaton and Tantu Pagelaran, were being well-kept in royal libraries of Bali and Lombok and provides the glimpse and valuable historical records on Majapahit. The Majapahit Hindu-Javanese culture has shaped the culture of Bali, that led to popular expression; &quot;without Java, there is no Bali&quot;. Yet in return, Bali is credited as the last stronghold to safeguard and preserve the ancient Hindu Javanese civilisation.

In weaponry, the Majapahit expansion is believed to be responsible for the widespread use of the keris dagger in Southeast Asia; from Java, Bali, Sumatra, Malaysia, Brunei to Southern Thailand. Although it has been suggested that the keris, and native daggers similar to it, predate Majapahit, nevertheless the empire expansion contributed to its popularity and diffusion in the region around the year 1492. For example, Kris of Knaud, one of the oldest surviving kris is dated to 1264 Saka (which correspondents to 1342). The Malay legend of Kris Taming Sari is also attributed to Majapahit origin.

For Indonesians in later centuries, Majapahit became a symbol of past greatness. The Islamic sultanates of Demak, Pajang, and Mataram sought to establish their legitimacy to the Majapahit. The Demak claimed a line of succession through Kertabumi, as its founder Raden Patah, in court chronicles was said to be the son of Kertabumi with Putri Cina, a Chinese princess, who had been sent away before her son was born. Sultan Agung&#x27;s conquest of Wirasaba (present-day Mojoagung) in 1615during that time just a small town without significant strategic and economic valueled by the sultan himself, may probably have had such symbolic importance as it was the location of the former Majapahit capital. Central Javanese palaces have traditions and genealogy that attempt to prove links back to the Majapahit royal linesusually in the form of a grave as a vital &quot;link&quot; in Java – where legitimacy is enhanced by such a connection. Bali, in particular, was heavily influenced by Majapahit and the Balinese consider themselves to be the true heirs of the kingdom.

Modern Indonesian nationalists, including those of the early 20th-century Indonesian National Revival, have invoked the Majapahit Empire. Indonesian founding fathers—especially Sukarno and Mohammad Yamin, built a historical construct around Majapahit to argue for the ancient unified realm, as a predecessor of modern Indonesia. The memory of its greatness remains in Indonesia and is sometimes seen as a precedent for the current political boundaries of the Republic. Many of modern Indonesian national symbols derived from Majapahit Hindu-Buddhist elements. The Indonesian national motto, &quot;&quot;Bhinneka Tunggal Ika&quot;, is a quotation from an Old Javanese poem &quot;Kakawin Sutasoma&quot;&quot;, written by a Majapahit poet, Mpu Tantular.

The Indonesian coat of arms, &quot;Garuda Pancasila&quot;, also derives from Javanese Hindu elements. The statue and relief of Garuda have been found in many temples in Java such as Prambanan from the ancient Mataram era, and the Panataran as well as the Sukuh temple dated from the Majapahit era. The notable statue of Garuda is the statue of the king Airlangga depicted as Vishnu riding Garuda.

In its propaganda from the 1920s, the Communist Party of Indonesia presented its vision of a classless society as a reincarnation of a romanticised Majapahit. It was invoked by Sukarno for nation building and by the New Order as an expression of state expansion and consolidation. Like Majapahit, the modern state of Indonesia covers vast territory and is politically centred on Java.

Palapa, the series of communication satellites owned by Telkom Indonesia, an Indonesian telecommunication company, was named after &quot;Sumpah Palapa&quot;, the famous oath taken by Gajah Mada, who swore that he would not taste any spice as long as he had not succeeded in unifying Nusantara (Indonesian archipelago). This ancient oath of unification signifies the Palapa satellite as the modern means to unify the Indonesian archipelago by way of telecommunication. The name was chosen by the president Suharto, and the program was started in February 1975.

Pura Kawitan Majapahit was built in 1995 as a homage to honour the empire that inspires the nation. Majapahit is often regarded as the antecedent of the modern state of Indonesia. This Hindu temple complex is located within Trowulan just north of Segaran pool.

During the last half-year of 2008, the Indonesian government sponsored a massive exploration on the site that is believed to be the place where the palace of Majapahit once stood. Jero Wacik, the Indonesian Minister of Culture and Tourism stated that the Majapahit Park would be built on the site and completed as early as 2009, to prevent further damage caused by home-made brick industries that developed in the surrounding area. Nevertheless, the project leaves a huge attention to some historians, since constructing the park&#x27;s foundation in Segaran site located in south side of Trowulan Museum will inevitably damage the site itself. Ancient bricks which are historically valuable were found scattered on the site. The government then argued that the method they were applying were less destructive since digging method were used instead of drilling.

==List of rulers==

The rulers of Majapahit belong to the Rajasa dynasty, which was founded in the early 13th century by Sri Ranggah Rajasa, the first king of Singhasari.

==Majapahit in popular culture==
Celebrated as &#x27;the golden era of the archipelago&#x27;, the Majapahit empire has inspired many writers and artists (and continues to do so) to create their works based on this era or to describe and mention it. The impact of the Majapahit theme on popular culture can be seen in the following:

===Literature===
* &quot;Sandyakalaning Majapahit&quot; (1933), or Twilight/Sunset in Majapahit is a historical romance that took place during the fall of Majapahit empire, written by Sanusi Pane.
* &quot;Panji Koming&quot; (since 1979), a weekly comic strip by Dwi Koendoro published in the Sunday edition of Kompas, telling the everyday life of Panji Koming, a common Majapahit citizen. Although it took place in the Majapahit era, the comic strip serves as witty satire and criticism of modern Indonesian society. From a political, social, cultural and current point of view, Indonesia is described as the &#x27;reincarnation&#x27; of the Majapahit empire. The current Indonesian president is often portrayed as a Majapahit monarch or prime minister.
* &quot;Senopati Pamungkas&quot; (1986, reprinted in 2003), a martial art-historical epic novel by Arswendo Atmowiloto. It takes place in the late Singhasari period and formation of Majapahit. This novel describes the sagas, royal intrigues, and romance of the formation of the kingdom as well as the adventure of the main character, a commoner named Upasara Wulung and his forbidden love affair with princess Gayatri Rajapatni, whom later becomes the consort of Raden Wijaya, the first king of Majapahit.
* &quot;Imperium Majapahit&quot;, a comic book series by Jan Mintaraga, published by Elexmedia Komputindo. This series tells the history of Majapahit from its formation until the decline.
* &quot;Gajah Mada&quot;, a pentalogy written by Langit Kresna Hariadi depicting a fictionalised detail of Gajah Mada&#x27;s life from the Kuti rebellion up to the Bubat War.
* &quot;Dyah Pitaloka&quot; (2007), a novel written by Hermawan Aksan, fictionalising the detailed life story of Sundanese princess Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi set around the Bubat War. The novel virtually takes the same context and was inspired by the Kidung Sundayana.
* &quot;Jung Jawa&quot; (2009), an anthology of short stories written by Rendra Fatrisna Kurniawan, imagining the life of the Nusantara people, published by Babel Publishing.

===Film and Radio===
* &quot;Saur Sepuh&quot; (1987–1991), a radio drama and film by Niki Kosasih. Begun as a popular radio drama program in the late 1980s, Saur Sepuh is based on 15th-century Java, centred around the story about a fictional hero named Brama Kumbara, the king of Madangkara, a fictional kingdom neighbour of the Pajajaran. In several stories the Paregreg war is described, that is to say, the civil war of Majapahit between Wikramawardhana and Bhre Wirabhumi. This part has been made into a single feature film entitled &#x27;Saur Sepuh&#x27; as well.
* &quot;Tutur Tinular&quot;, a radio drama and film by S Tidjab. Tutur Tinular is a martial art historical epic fictional story with the Majapahit era serving as the background of the story. The story also involved a romance between the hero named Arya Kamandanu and his Chinese lover Mei Shin.
* &quot;Wali Songo&quot;, the film tells the story of nine Muslim saints (&#x27;wali&#x27;) who spread Islam to Java. The story took place near the end of the Majapahit era and the formation of Demak. It describes the decaying Majapahit empire where royals are fighting each other for power while the commoners suffer.
* &quot;Puteri Gunung Ledang&quot; (2004), a Malaysian epic film based on a traditional Malay legend. This film recounts the love story between Gusti Putri Retno Dumilah, a Majapahit princess, and Hang Tuah, a Malaccan admiral.

===Video game===
* &quot;Civilization 5: Brave New World (2013)&quot;, where Gajah Mada appeared as one of the leaders of a great civilisation in the second expansion of the Civilization 5 game. He is the leader of the Indonesian civilisation, with the emblem of the Indonesian empire being the Surya Majapahit, although in the game the empire is known as the &quot;Indonesian empire&quot; instead.
* Later, in &quot;Civilization 6 (2016),&quot; &quot;a&quot; downloadable content has one of its rulers, Dyah Gitarja (referred as Gitarja in-game) as the leader of the Indonesian civilization, with the emblem being a simpler version of the Surya Majapahit. The unique unit of Indonesian civilization is the &quot;jong&quot;.
* On the &quot;Rise of the Rajas&quot; expansion pack from &quot;Age of Empires II&quot;, Gajah Mada appears in a campaign detailing his rise and then fall after the Pasunda Bubat tragedy. He also made appearance in the &quot;Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition&quot;.
* A unit called Cetbang Cannon is available for Indonesia, a revolutionary nation available for the Dutch and Portuguese civilization in &quot;Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition&quot;.
* Majapahit is featured as a civilization in &quot;Civilization VII&quot;. They appear during the exploration period of the game.

<doc id="162776" wikidata="Q1122538" url="?curid=162776" title="Hylomorphism">
<text>Hylomorphism is a philosophical doctrine developed by the Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, which conceives every physical entity or being (&quot;ousia&quot;) as a compound of matter (potency) and immaterial form (act), with the generic form as immanently real within the individual. The word is a 19th-century term formed from the Greek words ὕλη (&quot;hyle&quot;: &quot;wood, matter&quot;) and μορφή (&quot;morphē&quot;: &quot;form&quot;). Hylomorphic theories of physical entities have been undergoing a revival in contemporary philosophy.

== Aristotle&#x27;s concept of matter ==

The Ancient Greek language originally had no word for matter in general, as opposed to raw material suitable for some specific purpose or other, so Aristotle adapted the word for &quot;wood&quot; to this purpose. The idea that everything physical is made of the same basic substance holds up well under modern science, although it may be thought of more in terms of energy or matter/energy.

The Latin equivalent of the &quot;hyle&quot; concept – and later its medieval version – also emerged from Aristotle&#x27;s notion. The Greek term&#x27;s Latin equivalent was &quot;silva&quot;, which literally meant woodland or forest. However, Latin thinkers opted for a word that had a technical sense (rather than literal meaning). This emphasized &quot;silva&quot; as that of which a thing is made, but one that remained a substratum with changed form. The word &quot;materia&quot; was chosen instead to indicate a meaning not in handicraft but in the passive role that mother (&quot;mater&quot;) plays in conception.

Aristotle&#x27;s concept of &quot;hyle&quot; is the principle that correlates with shape and this can be demonstrated in the way the philosopher described &quot;hyle,&quot; saying it is that which receives form or definiteness, that which is formed. It can also be the material cause underlying a change in Aristotelian philosophy. Aristotle explained that &quot;By &quot;hyle&quot; I mean that which in itself is neither a particular thing nor of a certain quantity nor assigned to any other of the categories by which being is determined.&quot; This means that hyle is brought into existence not due to its being its agent or its own actuality but only when form attaches to it. It has been described as a plenum or a field, a conceptualization that opposed Democritus&#x27; atomistic ontology. It is maintained that the Aristotelian concept should not be understood as a &quot;stuff&quot; since there is, for example, &quot;hyle&quot; that is intellectual as well as sensible &quot;hyle&quot; found in the body.

For Aristotle, &quot;hyle&quot; is composed of four elements – fire, water, air, and earth – but these were not considered pure substances since matter and form exist in a combination of hot, moist, dry, and cold so that everything is united to form the elements.

Aristotle defines matter as &quot;that out of which&quot; something is made. For example, letters are the matter of syllables. Thus, &quot;matter&quot; is a relative term: an object counts as matter relative to something else. For example, clay is matter relative to a brick because a brick is made of clay, whereas bricks are matter relative to a brick house. Change is analyzed as a material transformation: matter is what undergoes a change of form. For example, consider a lump of bronze that&#x27;s shaped into a statue. Bronze is the matter, and this matter loses one form (&quot;morphe&quot;) (that of a lump) and gains a new form (that of a statue). According to Aristotle&#x27;s theory of perception, we perceive an object by receiving its form (&quot;eidos&quot;) with our sense organs. Thus, forms include complex &quot;qualia&quot; such as colors, textures, and flavors, not just shapes.

==Body–soul hylomorphism==
===Basic theory===

Aristotle applies his theory of hylomorphism to living things. He defines a soul as that which makes a living thing alive. Life is a property of living things, just as knowledge and health are. Therefore, a soul is a form—that is, a specifying principle or cause—of a living thing. Furthermore, Aristotle says that a soul is related to its body as form to matter.

Hence, Aristotle argues, there is no problem in explaining the unity of body and soul, just as there is no problem in explaining the unity of wax and its shape. Just as a wax object consists of wax with a certain shape, so a living organism consists of a body with the property of life, which is its soul. On the basis of his hylomorphic theory, Aristotle rejects the Pythagorean doctrine of metempsychosis, ridiculing the notion that just any soul could inhabit just any body.

According to Timothy Robinson, it is unclear whether Aristotle identifies the soul with the body&#x27;s structure. According to one interpretation of Aristotle, a properly organized body is already alive simply by virtue of its structure. However, according to another interpretation, the property of life—that is, the soul—is something in addition to the body&#x27;s structure. Robinson uses the analogy of a car to explain this second interpretation. A running car is running not only because of its structure but also because of the activity in its engine. Likewise, according to this second interpretation, a living body is alive not only because of its structure but also because of an additional property: the soul, which a properly organized body needs in order to be alive. John Vella uses Frankenstein&#x27;s monster to illustrate the second interpretation: the corpse lying on Frankenstein&#x27;s table is already a fully organized human body, but it is not yet alive; when Frankenstein activates his machine, the corpse gains a new property, the property of life, which Aristotle would call the soul.

=== Living bodies ===
Some scholars have pointed out a problem facing Aristotle&#x27;s theory of soul-body hylomorphism. According to Aristotle, a living thing&#x27;s matter is its body, which needs a soul in order to be alive. Similarly, a bronze sphere&#x27;s matter is bronze, which needs roundness in order to be a sphere. Now, bronze remains the same bronze after ceasing to be a sphere. Therefore, it seems that a body should remain the same body after death. However, Aristotle implies that a body is no longer the same body after death. Moreover, Aristotle says that a body that has lost its soul is no longer potentially alive. But if a living thing&#x27;s matter is its body, then that body should be potentially alive by definition.

One approach to resolving this problem relies on the fact that a living body is constantly replacing old matter with new. A five-year-old body consists of different matter than does the same person&#x27;s seventy-year-old body. If the five-year-old body and the seventy-year-old body consist of different matter, then what makes them the same body? The answer is presumably the soul. Because the five-year-old and the seventy-year-old bodies share a soul—that is, the person&#x27;s life—we can identify them both as the body. Apart from the soul, we cannot identify what collection of matter is the body. Therefore, a person&#x27;s body is no longer that person&#x27;s body after it dies.

Another approach to resolving the problem relies on a distinction between &quot;proximate&quot; and &quot;non-proximate&quot; matter. When Aristotle says that the body is matter for a living thing, he may be using the word &quot;body&quot; to refer to the matter that makes up the fully organized body, rather than the fully organized body itself. Unlike the fully organized body, this &quot;body&quot; remains the same thing even after death. In contrast, when he says that the body is no longer the same after its death, he is using the word &quot;body&quot; to refer to the fully organized body.

=== Intellect ===

Aristotle says that the intellect (&quot;nous&quot;), the ability to think, has no bodily organ (in contrast with other psychological abilities, such as sense-perception and imagination). Aristotle distinguishes between two types of intellect. These are traditionally called the &quot;passive intellect&quot; and the &quot;active (or agent) intellect&quot;. He says that the &quot;active (or agent) intellect&quot; is not mixed with the body and suggests that it can exist apart from it. Hence, scholars face the challenge of explaining the relationship between the intellect and the body in Aristotle.

According to one interpretation, a person&#x27;s ability to think (unlike his other psychological abilities) belongs to some incorporeal organ distinct from his body. This would amount to a form of dualism. However, according to some scholars, it would not be a full-fledged Cartesian dualism. This interpretation creates what Robert Pasnau has called the &quot;mind-soul problem&quot; within Aristotelian hylomorphism: if the intellect belongs to an entity distinct from the body, and the soul is the form of the body, then how is the intellect part of the soul?

Another interpretation rests on the distinction between the passive intellect and the agent intellect. According to this interpretation, the passive intellect is a property of the body, while the agent intellect is a substance distinct from the body. Some proponents of this interpretation think that each person has his own agent intellect, which presumably separates from the body at death. Others interpret the agent intellect as a single divine being, perhaps the unmoved mover, Aristotle&#x27;s God.

A third interpretation relies on the theory that an individual form is capable of having properties of its own. According to this interpretation, the soul is a property of the body, but the ability to think is a property of the soul itself, not of the body. If that is the case, then the soul is the body&#x27;s form and yet thinking need not involve any bodily organ.

==Teleology and ethics==

Aristotle holds a teleological worldview: he sees the universe as inherently purposeful. Basically, Aristotle claims that potentiality exists for the sake of actuality. Thus, matter exists for the sake of receiving its form, as an organism has sight for the sake of seeing. Now, each thing has certain potentialities as a result of its form. Because of its form, a snake has the potential to slither; we can say that the snake &quot;ought to&quot; slither. The more a thing achieves its potential, the more it succeeds in achieving its purpose.

Aristotle bases his ethical theory on this teleological worldview. Because of his form, a human being has certain abilities. Hence, his purpose in life is to exercise those abilities as well and as fully as possible. Now, the most characteristic human ability, which is not included in the form of any other organism, is the ability to think. The ability to deliberate makes it possible to choose the course of action that reason deems best—even if it is emotionally undesirable. Contemporary Aristotelians tend to stress exercising freedom and acting wisely as the best way to live. Yet, Aristotle argued that the best type of happiness is virtuously contemplating God and the second best is acting in accord with moral virtue. Either way, for Aristotle the best human life is a life lived rationally.

==Legacy==
===Universal hylomorphism===
The Neoplatonic philosopher Avicebron (Solomon ibn Gabirol) proposed a Neoplatonic version of this Aristotelian concept, according to which all things, including soul and intellect, are composed of matter and form.

Hasdai Crescas imagines that celestial-body is like Hylé but as matter in actuality, sure over the opposition about this, i.e. in potential existence. Matter and form is always presents in all but celestial-bodies are without form because of their nature; so Hasdai Crescas finds the solution also about this paradox.

===Medieval modifications===
Thomas Aquinas emphasized the act/potency understanding of form/matter whereby form activates the potency of matter and existence activates souls. The angels are accordingly composites of esse (potentiality) and existence (actuality) that activates immaterial souls, while God alone is per se existence, pure act without any potencies.

Medieval theologians, newly exposed to Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy, applied hylomorphism to Christian doctrines such as the transubstantiation of the Eucharist&#x27;s bread and wine into the body and blood of Jesus. Theologians such as Duns Scotus and Thomas Aquinas developed Christian applications of hylomorphism.

Aristotle&#x27;s texts on the agent intellect have given rise to diverse interpretations. Some following Averroes (Ibn Rushd 1126–1198) argue that Aristotle equated the active intellect with a divine being who infuses concepts into the passive intellect to aid human understanding. Others following Aquinas (1225–74) argue that the Neoplatonic interpretation is a mistake: the active intellect is actually part of the human soul.

====Substantial form, accidental form, and prime matter====

Medieval philosophers who used Aristotelian concepts frequently distinguished between substantial forms and accidental forms. A substance necessarily possesses at least one substantial form. It may also possess a variety of accidental forms. For Aristotle, a &quot;substance&quot; (&quot;ousia&quot;) is an individual thing—for example, an individual man or an individual horse. Within every physical substance, the substantial form determines what kind of thing the physical substance is by actualizing prime matter as individualized by the causes of that thing&#x27;s coming to be. For instance, the chick comes to be when the substantial form of chickens actualizes the hen&#x27;s egg and that actualization is possible insofar as that egg is in potency to being actualized both as a chicken due to the receptivity of its prime matter to the substantial form of chickens and into a chick with certain colored feathers due to the individualization of the egg given by its parents. So while the individualized matter determines individualized properties, the substantial form determines essential properties. The substantial form of substance S consists of S&#x27;s essence and its essential properties (the properties that S needs in order to be the kind of substance that S is). Substantial change destroys the ability of a substantial form to actualize individualized prime matter without affecting prime matter&#x27;s ability to be actualized by a new substantial form. When the wolf eats the chick, the chick&#x27;s rearranged matter becomes part of the wolf and animated by the wolf&#x27;s substantial form.

In contrast, S&#x27;s accidental forms are S&#x27;s non-essential properties, properties that S can lose or gain without changing into a different kind of substance. The chick can lose its feathers due to parasites without ceasing to be an individual chicken.

====Plurality vs. unity of substantial form====
Many medieval theologians and philosophers followed Aristotle in seeing a living being&#x27;s soul as that being&#x27;s form—specifically, its substantial form. However, they disagreed about whether X&#x27;s soul is X&#x27;s &quot;only&quot; substantial form. Some medieval thinkers argued that X&#x27;s soul is X&#x27;s only substantial form animating the entire body of X. In contrast, other medieval thinkers argued that a living being contains at least two substantial forms—(1) the shape and structure of its body, and (2) its soul, which makes its body alive.

====Thomistic hylomorphism====

Thomas Aquinas claimed that X&#x27;s soul was X&#x27;s only substantial form, although X also had numerous accidental forms that accounted for X&#x27;s nonessential features. Aquinas defined a substantial form as that which makes X&#x27;s matter constitute X, which in the case of a human being is also able to transcend the limitations of matter and establish both the rational capacity and natural immortality of human beings. Nevertheless, Aquinas did not claim that human persons were their disembodied souls because the human soul is essentially a substantial form activating matter into the body. He held that a proper human being is a composite of the rational soul and matter (both prime matter and individualized matter). So a soul separated from its body does not become an angel but retains its orientation to animate matter, while a corpse from which the soul has departed is not actually or potentially a human being.

Eleonore Stump describes Aquinas&#x27; theory of the soul in terms of &quot;configuration&quot;. The body is matter that is &quot;configured&quot;, i.e. structured, while the soul is a &quot;configured configurer&quot;. In other words, the soul is itself a configured thing, but it also configures the body. A dead body is merely matter that was once configured by the soul. It does not possess the configuring capacity of a human being.

Aquinas believed that rational capacity was a property of the soul alone, not of any bodily organ. However, he did believe that the brain had some basic cognitive function. Aquinas’ attribution of rational capacity to the immaterial soul allowed him to claim that disembodied souls could retain their rational capacity as his identification of the soul&#x27;s individual act of existence allowed him to claim that personal immortality is natural for human beings. Aquinas was also adamant that disembodied souls were in an unnatural state and that the perfection of heaven includes God miraculously enabling the soul to function once again as a substantial form by reanimating matter into a living body as promised by the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead.

===Modern physics===
The idea of hylomorphism can be said to have been reintroduced to the world when Werner Heisenberg invented his duplex world of quantum mechanics. In his 1958 text &quot;Physics and Philosophy&quot;, Heisenberg states:

A hylomorphic interpretation of Bohmian mechanics has been suggested, in which the cosmos is a single substance that is composed of both material particles and a substantial form. There is also a hylomorphic interpretation of the collapse of the wave function.
