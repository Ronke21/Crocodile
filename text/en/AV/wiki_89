<text>Charles Stewart Parnell (27 June 1846 – 6 October 1891) was an Irish nationalist politician who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the United Kingdom from 1875 to 1891, Leader of the Home Rule League from 1880 to 1882, and then of the Irish Parliamentary Party from 1882 to 1891, who held the balance of power in the House of Commons during the Home Rule debates of 1885–1886. He fell from power following revelations of a long-term affair, and died at age 45.

Born into a powerful Anglo-Irish Protestant landowning family in County Wicklow, he was a land reform agitator and founder of the Irish National Land League in 1879. He became leader of the Home Rule League, operating independently of the Liberal Party, winning great influence by his balancing of constitutional, radical, and economic issues, and by his skilful use of parliamentary procedure.

He was imprisoned in Kilmainham Gaol, Dublin, in 1882, but he was released when he renounced violent extra-parliamentary action. The same year, he reformed the Home Rule League as the Irish Parliamentary Party, which he controlled minutely as Britain&#x27;s first disciplined democratic party.

The hung parliament of 1885 saw him hold the balance of power between William Gladstone&#x27;s Liberal Party and Lord Salisbury&#x27;s Conservative Party. His power was one factor in Gladstone&#x27;s adoption of Home Rule as the central tenet of the Liberal Party. Parnell&#x27;s reputation peaked from 1889 to 1890, after letters published in &quot;The Times&quot;, linking him to the Phoenix Park killings of 1882, were shown to have been forged by Richard Pigott.

The Irish Parliamentary Party split in 1890, following the revelation of Parnell&#x27;s long adulterous love affair, which led to many British Liberals, many of whom were Nonconformists, refusing to work with him, and engendered strong opposition from Catholic bishops. He headed a small minority faction until his death in 1891.

Parnell&#x27;s funeral was attended by 200,000, and the day of his death is still remembered as Ivy Day. Parnell Square and Parnell Street in Dublin are named after him, and he is celebrated as the best organiser of an Irish political party up to that time, and one of the most formidable figures in parliamentary history.

==Early life==
Charles Stewart Parnell was born in Avondale House, County Wicklow. He was the third son and seventh child of John Henry Parnell (1811–1859), a wealthy Anglo-Irish Anglican landowner, and his American wife Delia Tudor Stewart (1816–1898) of Bordentown, New Jersey, daughter of the American naval hero Admiral Charles Stewart (the stepson of one of George Washington&#x27;s bodyguards). There were eleven children in all: five boys and six girls. Admiral Stewart&#x27;s mother, Parnell&#x27;s great-grandmother, belonged to the Tudor family, so Parnell had a distant relationship with the British royal family. John Henry Parnell himself was a cousin of one of Ireland&#x27;s leading aristocrats, Viscount Powerscourt, and also the grandson of a Chancellor of the Exchequer in Grattan&#x27;s Parliament, Sir John Parnell, who lost office in 1799, when he opposed the Act of Union.

The Parnells of Avondale were descended from a Protestant English merchant family, which came to prominence in Congleton, Cheshire, early in the 17th century where two generations held the office of Mayor of Congleton before moving to Ireland. The family produced a number of notable figures, including Thomas Parnell (1679–1718), the Irish poet, and Henry Parnell, 1st Baron Congleton (1776–1842), the Irish politician. Parnell&#x27;s grandfather William Parnell (1780–1821), who inherited the Avondale Estate in 1795, was an Irish liberal Party MP for Wicklow from 1817 to 1820. Thus, from birth, Charles Stewart Parnell possessed an extraordinary number of links to many elements of society; he was linked to the old Irish Parliamentary tradition via his great-grandfather and grandfather, to the American War of Independence via his grandfather, to the War of 1812 (where his grandfather Charles Stewart (1778–1869) had been awarded a gold medal by the United States Congress for gallantry in the U.S. Navy). Parnell belonged to the Church of Ireland, disestablished in 1868 (its members mostly unionists) though in later years he began to drop away from formal church attendance; and he was connected with the aristocracy through the Powerscourts. Yet it was as a leader of Irish Nationalism that Parnell established his fame.

Parnell&#x27;s parents separated when he was six, and as a boy, he was sent to different schools in England, where he spent an unhappy youth. His father died in 1859 and he inherited the Avondale estate, while his older brother John inherited another estate in County Armagh. The young Parnell studied at Magdalene College, Cambridge (1865–1869) but, due to the troubled financial circumstances of the estate he inherited, he was absent a great deal and never completed his degree. In 1871, he joined his elder brother John Howard Parnell (1843–1923), who farmed in Alabama (later an Irish Parnellite MP and heir to the Avondale estate), on an extended tour of the United States. Their travels took them mostly through the South and apparently, the brothers neither spent much time in centres of Irish immigration nor sought out Irish-Americans.

In 1874, he became High Sheriff of Wicklow, his home county in which he was also an officer in the Wicklow Militia (commissioned as Lieutenant 25 February 1865, retired 1870). He was noted as an improving landowner who played an important part in opening the south Wicklow area to industrialisation. His attention was drawn to the theme dominating the Irish political scene of the mid-1870s, Isaac Butt&#x27;s Home Rule League formed in 1873 to campaign for a moderate degree of self-government. It was in support of this movement that Parnell first tried to stand for election in Wicklow, but as high sheriff was disqualified. He was unsuccessful as a home rule candidate in the 1874 County Dublin by-election.

== Rise to political power ==
On 17 April 1875, Parnell was first elected to the House of Commons in a by-election for Meath, as a Home Rule League MP, backed by Fenian Patrick Egan. He replaced the deceased League MP, veteran Young Irelander John Martin. Parnell later sat for the constituency of Cork City, from 1880 until 1891.

During his first year as an MP, Parnell remained a reserved observer of parliamentary proceedings. He first came to attention in the public eye in 1876, when he claimed in the House of Commons that he did not believe that any murder had been committed by Fenians in Manchester. That drew the interest of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), a physical force Irish organisation that had staged a rebellion in 1867. Parnell made it his business to cultivate Fenian sentiments both in Britain and Ireland and became associated with the more radical wing of the Home Rule League, which included Joseph Biggar (MP for Cavan from 1874), John O&#x27;Connor Power (MP for County Mayo from 1874) (both, although constitutionalists, had links with the IRB), Edmund Dwyer-Gray (MP for Tipperary from 1877), and Frank Hugh O&#x27;Donnell (MP for Dungarvan from 1877). He engaged with them and played a leading role in a policy of obstructionism (i.e., the use of technical procedures to disrupt the House of Commons ability to function) to force the House to pay more attention to Irish issues, which had previously been ignored. Obstruction involved giving lengthy speeches which were largely irrelevant to the topic at hand. This behaviour was opposed by the less aggressive chairman (leader) of the Home Rule League, Isaac Butt.

Parnell visited the United States that year, accompanied by O&#x27;Connor Power. The question of Parnell&#x27;s closeness to the IRB, and whether indeed he ever joined the organisation, has been a matter of academic debate for a century. The evidence suggests that later, following the signing of the Kilmainham Treaty, Parnell did take the IRB oath, possibly for tactical reasons. What is known is that IRB involvement in the League&#x27;s sister organisation, the &quot;Home Rule Confederation of Great Britain&quot;, led to the moderate Butt&#x27;s ousting from its presidency (even though he had founded the organisation) and the election of Parnell in his place, on 28 August 1877. Parnell was a restrained speaker in the House of Commons, but his organisational, analytical and tactical skills earned wide praise, enabling him to take on the presidency of the British organisation. Butt died in 1879, and was replaced as chairman of the Home Rule League by the Whig-oriented William Shaw. Shaw&#x27;s victory was only temporary.

===New departure===
From August 1877, Parnell held a number of private meetings with prominent Fenian leaders. He visited Paris where he met John O&#x27;Leary and J. J. O&#x27;Kelly both of whom were impressed by him and reported positively to the most capable and militant Leader of the American republican Clan na Gael organisation, John Devoy. In December 1877, at a reception for Michael Davitt on his release from prison, he met William Carrol who assured him of Clan na Gael&#x27;s support in the struggle for Irish self-government. This led to a meeting in March 1878 between influential constitutionalists, Parnell and Frank Hugh O&#x27;Donnell, and leading Fenians O&#x27;Kelly, O&#x27;Leary and Carroll. This was followed by a telegram from John Devoy in October 1878 which offered Parnell a &quot;New Departure&quot; deal of separating militancy from the constitutional movement as a path to all-Ireland self-government, under certain conditions: abandonment of a federal solution in favour of separatist self-government, vigorous agitation in the land question on the basis of peasant proprietorship, exclusion of all sectarian issues, collective voting by party members and energetic resistance to coercive legislation.

Parnell preferred to keep all options open without clearly committing himself when he spoke in 1879 before Irish Tenant Defence Associations at Ballinasloe and Tralee. It was not until Davitt persuaded him to address a second meeting at Westport, County Mayo in June that he began to grasp the potential of the land reform movement. At a national level, several approaches were made which eventually produced the &quot;New Departure&quot; of June 1879, endorsing the foregone informal agreement which asserted an understanding binding them to mutual support and a shared political agenda. In addition, the New Departure endorsed the Fenian movement and its armed strategies. Working together with Davitt (who was impressed by Parnell) he now took on the role of leader of the New Departure, holding platform meeting after platform meeting around the country. Throughout the autumn of 1879, he repeated the message to tenants, after the long depression had left them without income for rent:

===Land League leader===
Parnell was elected president of Davitt&#x27;s newly founded Irish National Land League in Dublin on 21 October 1879, signing a militant Land League address campaigning for land reform. In so doing, he linked the mass movement to the parliamentary agitation, with profound consequences for both of them. Andrew Kettle, his &#x27;right-hand man&#x27;, became honorary secretary.

In a bout of activity, he left for America in December 1879 with John Dillon to raise funds for famine relief and secure support for Home Rule. Timothy Healy followed to cope with the press and they collected £70,000 for distress in Ireland. During Parnell&#x27;s highly successful tour, he had an audience with American President Rutherford B. Hayes. On 2 February 1880, he addressed the United States House of Representatives on the state of Ireland and spoke in 62 cities in the United States and in Canada. He was so well received in Toronto that Healy dubbed him &quot;the uncrowned king of Ireland&quot;. (The same term was applied 30 years earlier to Daniel O&#x27;Connell.) He strove to retain Fenian support but insisted when asked by a reporter that he personally could not join a secret society. Central to his whole approach to politics was ambiguity in that he allowed his hearers to remain uncertain. During his tour, he seemed to be saying that there were virtually no limits. To abolish landlordism, he asserted, would be to undermine English misgovernment, and he is alleged to have added:

His activities came to an abrupt end when the 1880 United Kingdom general election was announced for April and he returned to fight it. The Conservatives were defeated by the Liberal Party; William Gladstone was again Prime Minister. Sixty-three Home Rulers were elected, including twenty-seven Parnell supporters, Parnell being returned for three seats: Cork City, Mayo and Meath. He chose to sit for the Cork seat. His triumph facilitated his nomination in May in place of Shaw as leader of a new Home Rule League Party, faced with a country on the brink of a land war.

Although the League discouraged violence, agrarian outrages grew from 863 incidents in 1879 to 2,590 in 1880 after evictions increased from 1,238 to 2,110 in the same period. Parnell saw the need to replace violent agitation with country-wide mass meetings and the application of Davitt&#x27;s boycott, also as a means of achieving his objective of self-government. Gladstone was alarmed at the power of the Land League at the end of 1880. He attempted to defuse the land question with &quot;dual ownership&quot; in the Land Law (Ireland) Act 1881, establishing a Land Commission that reduced rents and enabled some tenants to buy their farms. These halted arbitrary evictions, but not where rent was unpaid.

Historian R. F. Foster argues that in the countryside the Land League &quot;reinforced the politicization of rural Catholic nationalist Ireland, partly by defining that identity against urbanization, landlordism, Englishness and—implicitly—Protestantism.&quot;

===Kilmainham Treaty===
Parnell&#x27;s own newspaper, the &quot;United Ireland&quot;, attacked the Land Act and he was arrested on 13 October 1881, together with his party lieutenants, William O&#x27;Brien, John Dillon, Michael Davitt and Willie Redmond, who had also conducted a bitter verbal offensive. They were imprisoned under a proclaimed Coercion Act in Kilmainham Gaol for &quot;sabotaging the Land Act&quot;, from where the &quot;No Rent Manifesto&quot;, which Parnell and the others signed, was issued calling for a national tenant farmer rent strike. The Land League was suppressed immediately.

Whilst in gaol, Parnell moved in April 1882 to make a deal with the government, negotiated through Captain William O&#x27;Shea MP, that, provided the government settled the &quot;rent arrears&quot; question allowing 100,000 tenants to appeal for fair rent before the land courts, then withdrawing the manifesto and undertaking to move against agrarian crime, after he realised militancy would never win Home Rule. Parnell also promised to use his good offices to quell the violence and to cooperate cordially for the future with the Liberal Party in forwarding Liberal principles and measures of general reform.

His release on 2 May, following the so-called Kilmainham Treaty, marked a critical turning point in the development of Parnell&#x27;s leadership when he returned to the parameters of parliamentary and constitutional politics, and resulted in the loss of support of Devoy&#x27;s American-Irish. His political diplomacy preserved the national Home Rule movement after the Phoenix Park killings of the Chief Secretary Lord Frederick Cavendish, and his Under-Secretary, T. H. Burke on 6 May. Parnell was shocked to the extent that he offered Gladstone to resign his seat as MP. The militant Invincibles responsible fled to the United States, which allowed him to break links with radical Land Leaguers. In the end, it resulted in a Parnell – Gladstone alliance working closely together. Davitt and other prominent members left the IRB, and many rank-and-file Fenians drifted into the Home Rule movement. For the next 20 years, the IRB ceased to be an important force in Irish politics, leaving Parnell and his party the leaders of the nationalist movement in Ireland.

===Party restructured===
Parnell now sought to use his experience and huge support to advance his pursuit of Home Rule and resurrected the suppressed Land League, on 17 October 1882, as the Irish National League (INL). It combined moderate agrarianism, a Home Rule programme with electoral functions, was hierarchical and autocratic in structure with Parnell wielding immense authority and direct parliamentary control. Parliamentary constitutionalism was the future path.

The informal alliance between the new, tightly disciplined INL and the Catholic Church was one of the main factors for the revitalisation of the national Home Rule cause after 1882. Parnell saw that the explicit endorsement of Catholicism was of vital importance to the success of this venture and worked in close cooperation with the Catholic hierarchy in consolidating its hold over the Irish electorate. The leaders of the Catholic Church largely recognised the Parnellite party as guardians of church interests, despite uneasiness with a powerful lay leadership.

At the end of 1885, the highly centralised organisation had 1,200 branches spread around the country, though there were fewer in Ulster than in the other provinces. Parnell left the day-to-day running of the INL in the hands of his lieutenants Timothy Harrington as Secretary, William O&#x27;Brien, editor of its newspaper &quot;United Ireland&quot;, and Tim Healy. Its continued agrarian agitation led to the passing of several Irish Land Acts that over three decades changed the face of Irish land ownership, replacing large Anglo-Irish estates with tenant ownership.
Parnell next turned to the Home Rule League Party, of which he was to remain the re-elected leader for over a decade, spending most of his time at Westminster, with Henry Campbell as his personal secretary. He fundamentally changed the party, replicated the INL structure within it and created a well-organised grassroots structure, introduced membership to replace &quot;ad hoc&quot; informal groupings in which MPs with little commitment to the party voted differently on issues, often against their own party. Some did not attend the House of Commons at all, citing expense, given that MPs were unpaid until 1911 and the journey to Westminster was both costly and arduous.

In 1882, he changed his party&#x27;s name to the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP). A central aspect of Parnell&#x27;s reforms was a new selection procedure to ensure the professional selection of party candidates committed to taking their seats. In 1884, he imposed a firm &#x27;party pledge&#x27; which obliged party MPs to vote as a bloc in parliament on all occasions. The creation of a strict party whip and formal party structure was unique in party politics at the time. The Irish Parliamentary Party is generally seen as the first modern British political party, its efficient structure and control contrasting with the loose rules and flexible informality found in the main British parties, which came to model themselves on the Parnellite model. The Representation of the People Act 1884 enlarged the franchise, and the IPP increased its number of MPs from 63 to 85 in the 1885 election.

The changes affected the nature of candidates chosen. Under Butt, the party&#x27;s MPs were a mixture of Catholic and Protestant, landlord and others, Whig, Liberal and Conservative, often leading to disagreements in policy that meant that MPs split in votes. Under Parnell, the number of Protestant and landlord MPs dwindled, as did the number of Conservatives seeking election. The parliamentary party became much more Catholic and middle class, with a large number of journalists and lawyers elected and the disappearance of Protestant Ascendancy landowners and Conservatives from it.

===Push for home rule===

Parnell&#x27;s party emerged swiftly as a tightly disciplined and, on the whole, energetic body of parliamentarians. By 1885, he was leading a party well-poised for the next general election, his statements on Home Rule designed to secure the widest possible support. Speaking in Cork on 21 January 1885, he stated:

Both British parties toyed with various suggestions for greater self-government for Ireland. In March 1885, the British cabinet rejected the proposal of radical minister Joseph Chamberlain of democratic county councils which in turn would elect a Central Board for Ireland. Gladstone on the other hand said he was prepared to go &#x27;rather further&#x27; than the idea of a Central Board. After the collapse of Gladstone&#x27;s government in June 1885, Parnell urged the Irish voters in Britain to vote against the Liberal Party. The November general elections (delayed because boundaries were being redrawn and new registers prepared after the Third Reform Act) brought about a hung Parliament in which the Liberals with 335 seats won 86 more than the Conservatives, with a Parnellite bloc of 86 Irish Home Rule MPs holding the balance of power in the Commons. Parnell&#x27;s task was now to win acceptance of the principle of a Dublin parliament.

Parnell at first supported a Conservative government – they were still the smaller party after the elections – but after renewed agrarian distress arose when agricultural prices fell and unrest developed during 1885, Lord Salisbury&#x27;s Conservative government announced coercion measures in January 1886. Parnell switched his support to the Liberals. The prospects shocked Unionists. The Orange Order, revived in the 1880s to oppose the Land League, now openly opposed Home Rule. On 20 January, the Irish Unionist Party was established in Dublin. By 28 January, Salisbury&#x27;s government had resigned.

The Liberal Party regained power on 1 February, their leader Gladstone – influenced by the status of Norway, which at the time was self-governing but under the Swedish Crown – moving towards Home Rule, which Gladstone&#x27;s son Herbert revealed publicly under what became known as the &quot;flying of the Hawarden Kite&quot;. The third Gladstone administration paved the way towards the generous response to Irish demands that the new Prime Minister had promised, but was unable to obtain the support of several key players in his own party. Lord Hartington (who had been Liberal leader in the late 1870s and was still the most likely alternative leader) refused to serve at all, while Joseph Chamberlain briefly held office then resigned when he saw the terms of the proposed bill.

On 8 April 1886, Gladstone introduced the First Irish Home Rule Bill, his object to establish an Irish legislature, although large imperial issues were to be reserved to the Westminster parliament. The Conservatives now emerged as enthusiastic unionists, Lord Randolph Churchill declared, &quot;The Orange card is the one to play&quot;. In the course of a long and fierce debate Gladstone made a remarkable , beseeching parliament to pass the bill. However, the split between pro- and anti-home rulers within the Liberal Party caused the defeat of the bill on its second reading in June by 341 to 311 votes.

Parliament was dissolved and elections called, with Irish Home Rule the central issue. Gladstone hoped to repeat his triumph of 1868, when he fought and won a general election to obtain a mandate for Irish Disestablishment (which had been a major cause of dispute between Conservatives and Liberals since the 1830s), but the result of the July 1886 general election was a Liberal defeat. The Conservatives and the Liberal Unionist Party returned with a majority of 118 over the combined Gladstonian Liberals and Parnell&#x27;s 85 Irish Party seats. Salisbury formed his second government – a minority Conservative government with Liberal Unionist support.

The Liberal split made the Unionists (the Liberal Unionists sat in coalition with the Conservatives after 1895 and would eventually merge with them) the dominant force in British politics until 1906, with strong support in Lancashire, Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham (the fiefdom of its former mayor Joseph Chamberlain who as recently as 1885 had been a furious enemy of the Conservatives) and the House of Lords where many Whigs sat (a second Home Rule Bill would pass the Commons in 1893 only to be overwhelmingly defeated in the Lords).

===Pigott forgeries===
Parnell next became the centre of public attention when in March and April 1887 he found himself accused by the British newspaper &quot;The Times&quot; of supporting the brutal murders in May 1882 of the newly appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland, Lord Frederick Cavendish, and the Permanent Under-Secretary, Thomas Henry Burke, in Dublin&#x27;s Phoenix Park, and of the general involvement of his movement with crime (i.e., with illegal organisations such as the IRB). Letters were published which suggested Parnell was complicit in the murders. The most important one, dated 15 May 1882, ran as follows:

A Commission of Enquiry, which Parnell had requested, revealed in February 1889, after 128 sessions that the letters were a fabrication created by Richard Pigott, a disreputable anti-Parnellite rogue journalist. Pigott broke down under cross-examination after the letter was shown to be a forgery by him with his characteristic spelling mistakes. He fled to Madrid where he committed suicide. Parnell was vindicated, to the disappointment of the Tories and the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury.

The 35-volume commission report published in February 1890, did not clear Parnell&#x27;s movement of criminal involvement. Parnell then took &quot;The Times&quot; to court and the newspaper paid him £5,000 () damages in an out-of-court settlement. When Parnell entered the House of Commons on 1 March 1890, after he was cleared, he received a hero&#x27;s reception from his fellow MPs led by Gladstone. It had been a dangerous crisis in his career, yet Parnell had at all times remained calm, relaxed and unperturbed which greatly impressed his political friends. But while he was vindicated in triumph, links between the Home Rule movement and militancy had been established. This he could have survived politically were it not for the crisis to follow.

===Pinnacle of power===

During the period 1886–1890, Parnell continued to pursue Home Rule, striving to reassure British voters that it would be no threat to them. In Ireland, unionist resistance (especially after the Irish Unionist Party was formed) became increasingly organised. Parnell pursued moderate and conciliatory tenant land purchase and still hoped to retain a sizeable landlord support for home rule. During the agrarian crisis, which intensified in 1886 and launched the Plan of Campaign organised by Parnell&#x27;s lieutenants, he chose in the interest of Home Rule not to associate himself with it.

All that remained, it seemed, was to work out details of a new home rule bill with Gladstone. They held two meetings, one in March 1888 and a second more significant meeting at Gladstone&#x27;s home in Hawarden on 18–19 December 1889. On each occasion, Parnell&#x27;s demands were entirely within the accepted parameters of Liberal thinking, Gladstone noting that he was one of the best people he had known to deal with, a remarkable transition from an inmate at Kilmainham to an intimate at Hawarden in just over seven years. This was the high point of Parnell&#x27;s career. In the early part of 1890, he still hoped to advance the situation on the land question, with which a substantial section of his party was displeased.

== Political downfall ==

===Divorce crisis===
Parnell&#x27;s leadership was first put to the test in February 1886, when he forced the candidature of Captain William O&#x27;Shea, who had negotiated the Kilmainham Treaty, for a Galway by-election. Parnell rode roughshod over his lieutenants Healy, Dillon and O&#x27;Brien who were not in favour of O&#x27;Shea. Galway was the harbinger of the fatal crisis to come. O&#x27;Shea had separated from his wife Katharine O&#x27;Shea, sometime around 1875, but would not divorce her as she was expecting a substantial inheritance. Mrs. O&#x27;Shea acted as liaison in 1885 with Gladstone during proposals for the First Home Rule Bill. Parnell later took up residence with her in Eltham, Kent, in the summer of 1886, and was a known overnight visitor at the O&#x27;Shea house in Brockley, Kent. When Mrs O&#x27;Shea&#x27;s aunt died in 1889, her money was left in trust.

On 24 December 1889, Captain O&#x27;Shea filed for divorce, citing Parnell as co-respondent, although the case did not come to trial until 15 November 1890. The two-day trial revealed that Parnell had been the long-term lover of Mrs. O&#x27;Shea and had fathered three of her children. Meanwhile, Parnell assured the Irish Party that there was no need to fear the verdict because he would be exonerated. During January 1890, resolutions of confidence in his leadership were passed throughout the country. Parnell did not contest the divorce action at a hearing on 15 November, to ensure that it would be granted and he could marry Mrs O&#x27;Shea, so Captain O&#x27;Shea&#x27;s allegations went unchallenged. A divorce decree was granted on 17 November 1890, but Parnell&#x27;s two surviving children were placed in O&#x27;Shea&#x27;s custody.

News of the long-standing adultery created a huge public scandal. The Irish National League passed a resolution to confirm his leadership. The Catholic Church hierarchy in Ireland was shocked by Parnell&#x27;s immorality and feared that he would wreck the cause of Home Rule. Besides the issue of tolerating immorality, the bishops sought to keep control of Irish Catholic politics, and they no longer trusted Parnell as an ally. The chief Catholic leader, Archbishop Walsh of Dublin, came under heavy pressure from politicians, his fellow bishops, and Cardinal Manning; Walsh finally declared against Parnell. says, &quot;For the first time in Irish history, the two dominant forces of Nationalism and Catholicism came to a parting of the ways.

In England one strong base of Liberal Party support was Nonconformist Protestantism, such as the Methodists; the &#x27;nonconformist conscience&#x27; rebelled against having an adulterer play a major role in the Liberal Party. Gladstone warned that if Parnell retained the leadership, it would mean the loss of the next election, the end of their alliance, and also of Home Rule. With Parnell obdurate, the alliance collapsed in bitterness.

===Party divides===
When the annual party leadership election was held on 25 November, Gladstone&#x27;s threat was not conveyed to the members until after they had loyally re-elected their &#x27;chief&#x27; in his office. Gladstone published his warning in a letter the next day; angry members demanded a new meeting, and this was called for 1 December. Parnell issued a manifesto on 29 November, saying a section of the party had lost its independence; he falsified Gladstone&#x27;s terms for Home Rule and said they were inadequate. A total of 73 members were present for the fateful meeting in committee room 15 at Westminster. Leaders tried desperately to achieve a compromise in which Parnell would temporarily withdraw. Parnell refused. He vehemently insisted that the independence of the Irish party could not be compromised either by Gladstone or by the Catholic hierarchy. As chairman, he blocked any motion to remove him.

On 6 December, after five days of vehement debate, a majority of 44 present led by Justin McCarthy walked out to found a new organisation, thus creating rival Parnellite and anti-Parnellite parties. The minority of 28 who remained true to their embattled &#x27;Chief&#x27; continued in the Irish National League under John Redmond, but all of his former close associates, Michael Davitt, John Dillon, William O&#x27;Brien and Timothy Healy deserted him to join the anti-Parnellites. The vast majority of anti-Parnellites formed the Irish National Federation, later led by John Dillon and supported by the Catholic Church. The bitterness of the split tore Ireland apart and resonated well into the next century. Parnell soon died, and his faction dissipated. The majority faction henceforth played only a minor role in British or Irish politics until the next time the UK had a hung Parliament, in 1910.

===Undaunted defiance===
Parnell fought back desperately, despite his failing health. On 10 December, he arrived in Dublin to a hero&#x27;s welcome. He and his followers forcibly seized the offices of the party paper &quot;United Irishman&quot;. A year before, his prestige had reached new heights, but the new crisis crippled this support, and most rural nationalists turned against him. In the December North Kilkenny by-election, he attracted Fenian &quot;hillside men&quot; to his side. This ambiguity shocked former adherents, who clashed physically with his supporters; his candidate lost by almost two to one. Deposed as leader, he fought a long and fierce campaign for reinstatement. He conducted a political tour of Ireland to re-establish popular support. In a North Sligo by-election, the defeat of his candidate by 2,493 votes to 3,261 was less resounding.

He fulfilled his loyalty to Katharine when they married on 25 June 1891, after Parnell had unsuccessfully sought a church wedding. On the same day, the Irish Catholic hierarchy, worried by the number of priests who had supported him in North Sligo, signed and published a near-unanimous condemnation: &quot;by his public misconduct, has utterly disqualified himself to be ... leader.&quot; Only Edward O&#x27;Dwyer, bishop of Limerick withheld his signature. The Parnells took up residence in Brighton.

He returned to fight the third and last by-election in County Carlow, having lost the support of the &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot; when its proprietor Edmund Dwyer-Gray defected to the anti-Parnellites. At one point quicklime was thrown at his eyes by a hostile crowd in Castlecomer, County Kilkenny. Parnell continued the exhausting campaigning. One loss followed another but he looked to the next general election in 1892 to restore his fortunes. On 27 September, he addressed a crowd in pouring rain at Creggs, subjecting himself to a severe soaking. On the difficult campaign trail, his health continuously deteriorated; furthermore, he had kidney disease. Parnell fought on furiously but, though aged just 45, he was a dying man.

==Death and legacy==
He returned to Dublin on 30 September. He died in his home at 10 Walsingham Terrace, Hove (now replaced by Dorset Court, Kingsway) on 6 October 1891 of pneumonia and in the arms of his wife Katharine. He was 45 years of age at the time of his death. Though an Anglican, his funeral on 11 October was at the Irish National nondenominational Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin, and was attended by more than 200,000 people. His notability was such that his gravestone of unhewn Wicklow granite, erected in 1940, reads only &quot;Parnell&quot;.

His brother John Howard inherited the Avondale estate. He found it heavily mortgaged and eventually sold it in 1899. Five years later, at the suggestion of Horace Plunkett, it was purchased by the state. It is open to public view and is where the &quot;Parnell Society&quot; holds its annual August summer school. The &quot;Parnell National Memorial Park&quot; is in nearby Rathdrum, County Wicklow. Dublin has locations named Parnell Street and Parnell Square. At the north end of O&#x27;Connell Street stands the Parnell Monument. This was planned and organised by John Redmond, who chose the American Augustus Saint Gaudens to sculpt the statue; it was funded by Americans and completed in 1911. Art critics said it was not an artistic success.

He is also commemorated on the first Sunday after the anniversary of his death on 6 October, known as Ivy Day, which originated when the mourners at his funeral in 1891, taking their cue from a wreath of ivy sent by a Cork woman &quot;as the best offering she could afford&quot;, took ivy leaves from the walls and stuck them in their lapels. Ever after, the ivy leaf became the Parnellite emblem, worn by his followers when they gathered to honour their lost leader.

Since 1991, the centenary of his death, Magdalene College, Cambridge, where Parnell studied, has offered the Parnell Fellowship in Irish Studies, which is awarded to a scholar for up to a year for study without teaching or administrative responsibilities. Parnell Fellows have often been historians, but have spanned a wide range of disciplines.

==Political views and affiliations==
Parnell&#x27;s personal political views remained an enigma. An effective communicator, he was skilfully ambivalent and matched his words depending on circumstances and audience, but he would always first defend constitutionalism on which basis he sought to bring about change, but he was hampered by the crimes that hung around the Land League and by the opposition of landlords against the attacks on their property.

Parnell&#x27;s personal complexities or his perception of a need for political expediency to his goal permitted him to condone the radical republican and atheist Charles Bradlaugh, while he associated himself with the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. Parnell was a close friend and political associate of fellow land reform activist Thomas Nulty, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath, until Parnell&#x27;s divorce crisis in 1889.

Parnell was linked both with the landed aristocracy class and the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), with speculation in the 1890s that he may have even joined the latter organisation. Historian Andrew Roberts argues that he was sworn into the IRB in the Old Library at Trinity College Dublin in May 1882 and that this was concealed for 40 years. In Barry O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;Parnell&quot;, X, Fenian Parliamentarian John O&#x27;Connor Power, relates, &#x27;And, in fact, I was, about this time [1877], deputed to ask Parnell to join us. I did ask him. He said &quot;No&quot; without a moment&#x27;s hesitation.&#x27;

On 24 September 1877, Parnell told his constituents that &quot;No amount of eloquence could achieve what the fear of an impending insurrection, what the Clerkenwell explosion and the shot in the police van [Manchester Martyrs incident] had achieved.&quot; Parnell also attributed the explosion and the Manchester Martyrs incident as leading to &quot;some measure of protection being given to the Irish tenant&quot; and the Church of Ireland being &quot;disestablished and disendowed&quot;. Speaking in the House of Commons, Parnell told the House: &quot;I wish to say as directly as I can that I do not believe, and never shall believe, that any murder was committed in Manchester.&quot;

Parnell was conservative by nature, which leads some historians to suggest that personally, he would have been closer to the Conservative Party, rather than the Liberal Party, but for political needs. Andrew Kettle, Parnell&#x27;s right-hand man, who shared many of his opinions, wrote of his own views, &quot;I confess that I felt [in 1885], and still feel, a greater leaning towards the British Tory party than I ever could have towards the so-called Liberals&quot;. In later years, the double effect of the Phoenix Park trauma and the O&#x27;Shea affair reinforced the conservative side of his nature.

==Legacy==

Charles Stewart Parnell possessed the remarkable attribute of charisma, was an enigmatic personality and politically gifted, and is regarded as one of the most extraordinary figures in Irish and British politics. He played a part in the process that undermined his own Anglo-Irish caste; within two decades absentee landlords were almost unknown in Ireland. He created single-handedly in the Irish Party Britain&#x27;s first modern, disciplined, political-party machine. He held all the reins of Irish nationalism and also harnessed Irish-America to finance the cause. He played an important role in the rise and fall of British governments in the mid-1880s and in Gladstone&#x27;s conversion to Irish Home Rule.

Over a century after his death he is still surrounded by public interest. His death, and the divorce upheaval which preceded it, gave him a public appeal and interest that other contemporaries, such as Timothy Healy or John Dillon, could not match. His leading biographer, F. S. L. Lyons, says historians emphasise numerous major achievements: 
Above all there is the emphasis on constitutional action, as historians point to the Land Act 1881; the creation of the powerful third force in Parliament using a highly disciplined party that he controlled; the inclusion of Ireland in the Land Law (Ireland) Act 1881, while preventing any reduction in the number of Irish seats; the powerful role of the Irish National League and organising locally, especially County conventions that taught peasants about democratic self-government; forcing Home Rule to be a central issue in British politics; and persuading the great majority of the Liberal party to adopt his cause. Lyons agrees that these were remarkable achievements, but emphasises that Parnell did not accomplish them alone, but only in close coordination with men such as Gladstone and Davitt.

Gladstone described him: &quot;Parnell was the most remarkable man I ever met. I do not say the ablest man; I say the most remarkable and the most interesting. He was an intellectual phenomenon.&quot; Liberal leader H. H. Asquith called him one of the three or four greatest men of the 19th century, while Lord Haldane described him as the strongest man the House of Commons had seen in 150 years. Historian A. J. P. Taylor says, &quot;More than any other man he gave Ireland the sense of being an independent nation.&quot;

Lyons points up the dark side as well. The decade-long liaison with Mrs. O&#x27;Shea was a disaster waiting to happen, and Parnell had made no preparations for it. He waited so long because of money – there was an expectation that Mrs. O&#x27;Shea would receive a large inheritance from her elderly aunt who might have changed her will if she had known about the affair. In the aftermath of the divorce he fought violently to retain control in a hopeless cause. Thereby he ruined his health and wrecked his movement, which never fully recovered. The bottom line for Lyons, however, is positive: 
==Portrayal in fiction==

In Knut Hamsun&#x27;s 1892 novel &quot;Mysteries&quot;, the characters, on a couple of occasions, briefly discuss Charles Stewart Parnell, particularly in relation to Gladstone: &quot;Dr. Stenerson had a high opinion of Parnell, but if Gladstone was so opposed to him, he must know what he was about—with apologies to the host, Mr. Nagel, who couldn&#x27;t forgive Gladstone for being an honourable man&quot;.

Parnell&#x27;s death shocks the character Eleanor in Virginia Woolf&#x27;s novel &quot;The Years&quot;, published in 1937: &quot;...how could he be dead? It was like something fading in the sky.&quot;

Parnell is toasted in the 1938 poem of William Butler Yeats, &quot;Come Gather Round Me, Parnellites&quot;, while he is also referred to in &quot;To a Shade&quot;, where he performs the famous &quot;C.S.Parnell Style&quot;, and in Yeats&#x27; two-line poem &quot;Parnell&quot;.

In W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;, published in 1944, the author mentions Parnell and O&#x27;Shea: &quot;Passion is destructive. It destroyed Antony and Cleopatra, Tristan and Isolde, Parnell and Kitty O&#x27;Shea.&quot;

Parnell is the subject of a discussion in Irish author James Joyce&#x27;s first chapter of the semi-autobiographical novel &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;, first serialised in &quot;The Egoist&quot; magazine in 1914–15. Parnell appears in &quot;Ivy Day in the Committee Room&quot; in &quot;Dubliners&quot;. He is also discussed in &quot;Ulysses&quot;, as is his brother. The main character in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, HCE, is partially based on Parnell; among other resemblances, both are accused of transgressions in Phoenix Park.

Parnell is a major background character in Thomas Flanagan&#x27;s 1988 historical novel &quot;The Tenants of Time&quot;, and in Leon Uris&#x27;s 1976 historical novel &quot;Trinity&quot;.

Parnell was played by Clark Gable in &quot;Parnell&quot;, the 1937 MGM production about the Irish leader. Instead of wearing a full beard like the real Parnell, the popular actor sported sideburns in addition to his trademark moustache. The film is notable as Gable&#x27;s biggest flop and occurred at the height of his career when almost every Gable film was a smash hit. Parnell was portrayed by Robert Donat in the 1947 film &quot;Captain Boycott&quot;. In 1954, Patrick McGoohan played Parnell in &quot;The Fall of Parnell (December 6, 1890)&quot;, an episode of the historical television series &quot;You Are There&quot;.

In 1991, Trevor Eve played Parnell in the television mini-series &quot;Parnell and the Englishwoman&quot;.

The 1992 novel &quot;Death and Nightingales&quot; by Eugene McCabe mentions him numerous times.

The Irish rebel song by Dominic Behan &quot;Come Out, Ye Black and Tans&quot; contains a reference to Parnell:

<text>Linköping University (LiU; ) is a public research university based in Linköping, Sweden. Originally established in 1969, it was granted full university status in 1975 and is one of Sweden&#x27;s largest academic institutions. 

The university has four campuses across three cities: Campus Valla and Campus US in Linköping, Campus Norrköping in Norrköping and Campus Lidingö in Stockholm. It is organized into four faculties: Arts and Sciences; Medicine and Health Sciences; Science and Engineering (also referred to as the Institute of Technology); and Educational Sciences. To facilitate interdisciplinary work, there are 12 large departments combining knowledge from several disciplines and often belonging under more than one faculty. In 2021 the university had 35,900 students and 4,300 employees. Linköping University emphasizes dialogue with the surrounding business sphere and the community at large, both in terms of research and education. 

It is a founding member of the Conceive Design Implement Operate (CDIO) Initiative, as well as a member of the European Consortium of Innovative Universities (ECIU), the European University Association (EUA), the European Society for Engineering Education (SEFI) and NORDTEK.
==History==
The origins of Linköping University date back to the 1960s. In 1965, The Swedish National Legislative Assembly (Riksdag) decided to locate some programmes within the fields of technology and medicine to Linköping. A branch of Stockholm University was placed in Linköping in 1967, offering education within humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. 

Two years later in 1969, a unit for medical training and the Institute of Technology were established, marking the founding of the university. In 1970 all activities were brought together in three faculties within the Linköping University College: the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Faculty of Medicine and the Institute of Technology. Linköping University College was granted full university status in 1975 and renamed Linköping University.

In 1977 the teacher training colleges in Linköping and Norrköping were transferred to Linköping University. The Faculty of Health Sciences was formed in 1986 based on the faculty of medicine and regional funded education in health care professions. In 1997 a campus was opened in the neighbouring city of Norrköping. The renowned Carl Malmsten School of Furniture — officially Malmstens Linköping University (MLU), and most often referred to as Malmstens — has been part of Linköping University since 2000; after almost 60 years at the city centre, in 2009 Malmstens moved into new premises on the outskirts of Stockholm.

==Campuses==

Education and research are conducted at three campuses in the cities of Linköping and Norrköping — &quot;Campus Valla&quot;, &quot;Campus US&quot; and &quot;Campus Norrköping&quot; — situated approximately 200 and 160 kilometers southwest of Stockholm, respectively. The Campus Bus (free of charge for students) connects the three campuses in Linköping and Norrköping. A fourth campus, &quot;Campus Lidingö&quot;, is located in Lidingö, an island in the inner Stockholm archipelago. 

===Campus Valla===

Campus Valla, three kilometers from the city centre of Linköping, is the university&#x27;s largest campus and where the majority of students and researchers study and work. Campus Valla is sandwiched between Linköping Science Park and Linköping Golf Course to the west, and Valla Wood — a 200 acres large nature reserve — to the east. Campus Valla also houses several government research institutes, such as the Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI) and the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI). 

===Campus US===

Campus US (the University Hospital campus) in Linköping houses the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences. Campus US is located next to Linköping University Hospital and Linköping City Park (&quot;The Garden Society&quot;, ), and only a few hundred meters from the city centre.

===Campus Norrköping===

Campus Norrköping is a city campus in central Norrköping, 40 kilometers northeast of Linköping. Approximately one-fourth of the students are enrolled here. The campus is located in the historical &quot;Industrilandskapet&quot; district, with campus buildings on both sides of the river Motala ström connected by &quot;Campusbron&quot;, a footbridge.

===Campus Lidingö===

Campus Lidingö houses the Carl Malmsten School of Furniture (&quot;Malmstens Linköping University&quot;), which has been part of Linköping University since 2000. After almost 60 years at the city centre, in 2009 the school moved into new premises in Lidingö, on the outskirts of Stockholm.

===Education===

Linköping University offers education at the basic and advanced levels via 120 study programmes, 550 single-subject courses and specialised as well as interdisciplinary postgraduate studies. 
A large number of the degree programmes lead to qualified professional degrees in fields such as medicine, business and economics, teacher education and engineering. Many of the programmes are interdisciplinary, combining for example industrial management and engineering, medicine and engineering, or integrating economics, law and languages.

In 1986 the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences became the first faculty in Sweden to put problem-based learning into practice within medical training and health-care programmes. 

In 2000, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in collaboration with three Swedish universities — Linköping University, Chalmers University of Technology and the KTH Royal Institute of Technology — formally founded the Conceive Design Implement Operate (CDIO) Initiative, a framework for engineering education. 
CDIO developed into an international collaboration, with universities around the world adopting the same framework.

In 2007, the Medical Programme and the Department of Electrical Engineering, Control systems were recognized as Centres of Excellence in Higher Education by the Swedish National Agency for Higher Education. Linköping University was awarded two out of eight Centres of Excellence recognized at Swedish universities, with the recognition based on a thorough quality assessment by a panel of experts.

<text>Bournemouth ( ) is a coastal resort town in the Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole unitary authority area, in the ceremonial county of Dorset, England. The 2021 census built-up area had a population of 196,455, making it the largest town in Dorset.

Previously an uninhabited and rarely-visited heathland, other than by occasional fishermen and smugglers, a health resort was founded in the area by Lewis Tregonwell in 1810. After the Ringwood, Christchurch and Bournemouth Railway opened in 1870, it grew into an important resort town which attracts over five million visitors annually with the town&#x27;s beaches and popular nightlife. It now has a financial sector that is worth more than £1 billion in gross value added.

Part of Hampshire since before the Domesday Book, it was assigned to Dorset under the Local Government Act 1972 in 1974. Bournemouth Borough Council became a unitary authority in 1997 and was replaced by Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council in 2019; the current unitary authority also covers Poole, Christchurch and adjoining land.

The town centre has notable Victorian architecture. St Peter&#x27;s Church has a spire and is one of three Grade I listed churches in the borough. The town also has both an events venue and a concert hall, the Bournemouth International Centre (BIC) and Pavilion Theatre respectively.

==Toponymy==

The first mention of Bournemouth comes in the Christchurch cartulary of 1406, where a monk describes how a large fish (&quot;uni magno piscis&quot;), long, was washed up at &quot;La Bournemothe&quot; in October of that year and taken to the Manor of Wick; six days later, a portion of the fish was collected by a canon from Christchurch Priory and taken away as tithe. &quot;La Bournemowthe&quot;, however, was purely a geographic reference to the uninhabited area around the mouth of the small river which, in turn, drained the heathland between the towns of Poole and Christchurch. The word &quot;bourne&quot;, meaning a small stream, is a derivative of &quot;burna&quot;, old English for a brook. From the latter half of the 16th century &quot;Bourne Mouth&quot; seems to be preferred, being recorded as such in surveys and reports of the period, but this appears to have been shortened to &quot;Bourne&quot; after the area had started to develop. A travel guide published in 1831 calls the place &quot;Bourne Cliffe&quot; or &quot;Tregonwell&#x27;s Bourne&quot; after its founder. &quot;The Spas of England&quot;, published ten years later, calls it simply &quot;Bourne&quot; as does an 1838 edition of the &quot;Hampshire Advertiser&quot;. In the late 19th century &quot;Bournemouth&quot; became predominant, although its two-word form appears to have remained in use up until at least the early 20th century, turning up on a 1909 ordnance map. The Coat of arms of Bournemouth was first granted on 24 March 1891.

==History==
In the 12th century, the region around the mouth of the River Bourne was part of the Hundred of Holdenhurst. The hundred later became the Liberty of Westover when it was extended to include the settlements of North Ashley, Muscliff, Muccleshell, Throop, Iford, Pokesdown, Tuckton and Wick, and incorporated into the Manor of Christchurch. Although the Dorset and Hampshire region surrounding it had been the site of human settlement for thousands of years, Westover was largely a remote and barren heathland before 1800. In 1574 the Earl of Southampton noted that the area was &quot;Devoid of all habitation&quot;, and as late as 1795 the Duke of Rutland recorded that &quot;... on this barren and uncultivated heath there was not a human to direct us&quot;.

There were some prehistoric settlements in the area, notably along the River Stour, including Longham where a skull thought to be 5,500 years old was found in 1932. Bronze Age burials near Moordown, and the discovery of Iron Age pottery on the East Cliff in 1969, suggest there may have been settlements there during that period. Hengistbury Head, added to the borough in 1932, was the site of a much older Palaeolithic encampment. During the latter half of the 16th century James Blount, 6th Baron Mountjoy, began mining for alum in the area, and at one time part of the heath was used for hunting, although by the late 18th century little evidence of either event remained. No-one lived at the mouth of the Bourne river and the only regular visitors to the area before the 19th century were a few fishermen, turf cutters and gangs of smugglers.
Prior to the Christchurch Inclosures Act 1802, more than 70% of the Westover area was common land. The act, together with the Inclosure Commissioners&#x27; Award of 1805, transferred into the hands of five private owners, including James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury, and Sir George Ivison Tapps. In 1809 the Tapps Arms public house was built on the heath. A few years later, in 1812, the first official residents, retired army officer Lewis Tregonwell and his wife, moved into their new home built on land purchased from Tapps. The area was well known to Tregonwell who, during the Napoleonic Wars, spent much of his time searching the heath and coastline for French invaders and smugglers.

Anticipating that people would come to the area to indulge in the newly fashionable pastime of sea-bathing, an activity with perceived health benefits, Tregonwell built a series of villas on his land between 1816 and 1822, which he hoped to let out. The common belief that pine-scented air was good for lung conditions, and in particular tuberculosis, prompted Tregonwell and Tapps to plant hundreds of pine trees. These early attempts to promote the town as a health resort meant that by the time Tregonwell died in 1832, Bournemouth had grown into a small community with a scattering of houses, villas and cottages. The town would ultimately grow up around the scattered pines and tree-lined walk to the beach, later to become known as the Invalids&#x27; Walk.

After the death of Tapps in 1835, his son Sir George William Tapps-Gervis inherited his father&#x27;s estate. He hired the young local architect Benjamin Ferrey to develop Bournemouth Gardens along the coastal area on the east side of the stream. Bournemouth&#x27;s first hotel, later to become part of the Royal Bath Hotel, opened in 1838 and is one of the few buildings designed by Ferrey still standing and operating. Bournemouth grew at a faster rate as Tapps-Gervis began developing the area similarly to the south coast resorts of Weymouth and Brighton. Despite enormous investment, the town&#x27;s share of the market remained modest. In 1841 Tapps-Gervis invited the physician and writer Augustus Granville to stay. Granville was the author of &quot;The Spas of England&quot;, which described health resorts around the country, and as a result of his visit, he included a chapter on Bournemouth in the second edition of his book. The publication of the book, and the increase in visitors seeking the medicinal use of seawater and the pine-scented air, helped the town to grow and establish itself as an early tourist destination.

In the 1840s Benjamin Ferrey was replaced by Decimus Burton, whose plans for Bournemouth included the construction of Bournemouth Gardens alongside the Bourne stream, an idea first mooted by Granville. The fields south of the road crossing (later Bournemouth Square) were drained and laid out with shrubberies and walks. Many of these paths, including the Invalids&#x27; Walk, remain in the town today. A second suggestion of Granville&#x27;s, a sanatorium, was completed in 1855 and greatly raised Bournemouth&#x27;s profile as a place for recuperation.

At a time when the most convenient way to arrive in the town was by sea, a pier was considered to be a necessity. The Holdenhurst parish vestry was reluctant to find the money, and an attempt to raise funds privately in 1847 had only succeeded in financing a small jetty. The Bournemouth Improvement Act of 1856 granted greater financial autonomy to the town and a pier was approved that year. A number of wooden structures were built before an cast iron design by Eugenius Birch was completed in 1880. Under the Act, a board of 13 Commissioners was established to build and organise the expanding infrastructure of the town, such as paving, sewers, drainage, street lighting and street cleaning.
The arrival of the railways in 1870 precipitated a massive growth in seaside and summer visitors to the town, especially from the Midlands and London. In 1880 the town had a population of 17,000, but by 1900, when railway connections to Bournemouth were at their most developed, the town&#x27;s population had risen to 60,000 and it had become a favourite location for visiting artists and writers. The town was improved greatly during this period through the efforts of Sir Merton Russell-Cotes, the town&#x27;s mayor and a local philanthropist, who helped to establish the town&#x27;s first library and museum. The Russell-Cotes Art Gallery &amp; Museum was housed in his mansion, and after his death, it was given to the town. Bournemouth became a municipal borough in 1890 and a county borough in 1900.

As Bournemouth&#x27;s growth increased in the early 20th century, the town centre spawned theatres, cafés, two art deco cinemas, and more hotels. Bournemouth Corporation Tramways was established in 1902, becoming the town&#x27;s first public transport system. In 1908, a deadly tram crash in the town gardens killed seven people. Other new buildings constructed included the war memorial in 1921 and the Bournemouth Pavilion, the town&#x27;s concert hall and grand theatre, finished in 1925.

The Bournemouth Blitz saw heavy damage to the town during the Second World War despite initially escaping heavy bombing. A raid by German fighter bombers on 23 May 1943 killed 131 people and damaged 3,359 buildings, with two large hotels being completely destroyed. It is believed that the large number of RAF airmen billeted in the town may have been the reason for the attack. The seafront incurred damage when it was fortified against invasion. The cast iron lampposts and benches along the front were removed and melted down for munitions, as was much of the superstructure from both Bournemouth and Boscombe piers before they were breached to prevent their use by enemy ships. The large amounts of barbed wire and anti-tank obstacles along the beach, and the mines at the foot of the chines, took two years to remove when peace was finally achieved.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution stationed an inshore lifeboat at Bournemouth between 1965 and 1972. Coverage for the area has otherwise been provided from Poole Lifeboat Station. The Bournemouth International Centre (BIC), a large conference and exhibition centre, was constructed near the seafront in 1984, and in the following year Bournemouth became the first town in the United Kingdom to introduce and use CCTV cameras for public street-based surveillance.

In 1993, the IRA orchestrated a terrorist attack in the town centre. The only injuries sustained were minor ones but over £1 million in damage was caused.

From 2000 to 2001 the Tesco bomb campaign hit the town with a plot to extort money from Supermarket giant Tesco. Visitors to the town plummeted during the campaign, especially after a bomb exploded at an elderly woman&#x27;s home after she opened a letter sent by the bomber. During the eight months, over seven bombs were found by Dorset Police, ranging from small letter bombs, to pipe bombs and parcel bombs. The culprit was found to be Robert Edward Dyer, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison.

The Waterfront complex, which was intended to hold an IMAX cinema, was constructed on the seafront in 1998. The concrete and smoked glass building featured a wavy roof design, but was despised by residents and visitors alike because it blocked views of the bay and the Isle of Purbeck. In 2005 it was voted the most hated building in England in a 10,000-person poll conducted by the Channel 4 programme &quot;Demolition&quot;, and was pulled down in spring 2013. The site is now used as an outdoor event arena. The council has recently completed a larger redevelopment of the site and adjoining council land.

In 2010, Bournemouth celebrated its bicentenary. In 2012 Bournemouth was unsuccessful in its bid for city status, losing out to Chelmsford, Essex in competition with 26 other towns to commemorate Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee. Bournemouth sought city status once again for the Platinum Jubilee Civic Honours in 2022 but was unsuccessful.

On 13 March 2022, 21-year-old Thomas Roberts was stabbed to death in Bournemouth Town Centre by Lawangeen Abdulrahimzai in a high-profile murder case.

On 31 May 2023, two people died and eight others were injured in an incident at Bournemouth beach.

==Governance==
There is one tier of local government covering Bournemouth, at unitary authority level: Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council, which is based at the Civic Centre (formerly known as Bournemouth Town Hall) on Bourne Avenue in Bournemouth.

===Administrative history===
The area that is now Bournemouth was historically mostly within the ancient parish of Christchurch in Hampshire. A chapel of ease was established at Holdenhurst to serve the west of the parish, and the chapelry of Holdenhurst subsequently came to be treated as a separate civil parish from medieval times.

When the development of Bournemouth began in 1810, the site straddled the parishes of Holdenhurst and Christchurch. An ecclesiastical parish of Bournemouth was created in 1845, but for civil purposes the town continued to straddle the parishes of Holdenhurst and Christchurch. A body of improvement commissioners was established in 1856 to provide local government services in the town.

Bournemouth was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1890. In 1900 it was elevated to the status of a county borough, making it independent from Hampshire County Council, whilst remaining part of the geographical county of Hampshire. The borough boundaries were enlarged on several occasions, notably in 1901 when it absorbed Pokesdown, Southbourne and Winton, and in 1931 when it absorbed Holdenhurst and Kinson (the latter being transferred from Dorset to Hampshire on its absorption into Bournemouth). In 1921 the borough council bought the former Mont Dore Hotel on Bourne Avenue, which had been completed in 1885, and converted into the Town Hall.

The county borough of Bournemouth was reconstituted as a non-metropolitan district in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The district kept the same boundaries, but was transferred from Hampshire to Dorset, it being considered desirable that the whole of the South East Dorset conurbation should be in the same county. Bournemouth&#x27;s borough status was transferred to the new district, allowing the council to take the name Bournemouth Borough Council and giving the chair of the council the title of mayor, continuing Bournemouth&#x27;s series of mayors dating back to 1890.

On 1 April 1997, Bournemouth Borough Council became a unitary authority, taking over the provision of county council functions from Dorset County Council.

As from April 2019, the nine councils of Dorset were merged into two and Bournemouth became part of a unitary authority with Christchurch and Poole (known as BCP). For the purposes of Lieutenancy it remains part of the ceremonial county of Dorset. Since the abolition of Bournemouth Borough Council in 2019, Bournemouth has had charter trustees, being the BCP councillors representing wards in the former borough of Bournemouth. The trustees preserve the town&#x27;s civic charters and traditions, including appointing one of their number each year to serve as mayor.

===Parliamentary representation===
Bournemouth is represented by two parliamentary constituencies in the House of Commons; Bournemouth East and Bournemouth West. In the 2024 general election, the former was gained for Labour by Tom Hayes with 40.8% of the vote, while the latter was also gained for Labour by Jessica Toale with 36.4%. However, the seats had previously both been considered Conservative safe seats. In 2022, both of the towns Conservative MPs, Conor Burns and Tobias Ellwood had the whip withdrawn forcing them to sit as Independents.

==Geography==

Bournemouth is about southwest of London. The town borders the neighbouring towns of Poole and Christchurch to the west and east respectively. Poole Bay lies to the south. The River Stour forms a natural boundary to the north and east, terminating at Christchurch Harbour; while the River Bourne rises in Poole and flows through the middle of Bournemouth town centre, into the English Channel. The towns of Poole, Bournemouth and Christchurch form the South East Dorset conurbation with a combined population of over 400,000. Bournemouth is both a retail and commercial centre. Areas within Bournemouth include: Boscombe, Kinson, Southbourne, Springbourne, Throop, Westbourne, Winton and Pokesdown.

The area&#x27;s geology has little variety, comprising almost entirely of Eocene clays which, prior to urbanisation, supported a heathland environment. Patches of the original heath still remain, notably Turbary Common, a site, much of which is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. This heathland habitat is home to all six species of native reptile, the Dartford warbler and some important flora such as sundew and bog asphodel. Small populations of Exmoor pony and Shetland cattle help to maintain the area.
Bournemouth is directly north of Old Harry Rocks, the easternmost end of the Jurassic Coast, of coastline designated a World Heritage Site in 2001. Bournemouth&#x27;s own coastline stretches from Sandbanks to Christchurch Harbour and comprises mainly sandy beaches backed by gravel and sandy clay cliffs. These cliffs are cut by a number of chines which provide natural access to the shore. At the easternmost point lies Hengistbury Head, a narrow peninsula that forms the southern shore of Christchurch Harbour. It is a local nature reserve and the site of a Bronze Age settlement.

===Climate===
Like all of the UK, Bournemouth has a temperate oceanic climate with moderate variation in annual and daily temperatures, mild summers, and cool winters. From 1991 to 2020 the annual mean temperature was . The warmest months are July and August, which have an average temperature range of , while the coolest months are January and February, which have an average temperature range of . Average rainfall in Bournemouth is around annually, well below the national average of . It records both higher and lower temperatures than would be expected for its coastal location. Since 1960, temperature extremes as measured at Bournemouth Hurn Airport have ranged from in August 1990, down to in January 1963. The lowest temperature recorded in recent years was in December 2010. The February and winter month record high was broken in 2019, with a temperature of .

=== Green belt ===

Bournemouth lies at the centre of a green belt region that extends into the wider surrounding counties. It is in place to reduce urban sprawl, prevent the towns in the South East Dorset conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas, and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.

Bournemouth has small areas of green belt within its district to the north and east, mostly along the fringes of the shared border with the Christchurch and East Dorset districts. These cover landscape features and greenfield facilities including the River Stour, Stour Valley Way, Millhams Mead and Stour Valley nature reserves and arboretum, Hengistbury Head, and the small communities of Throop and Holdenhurst. Turbary Park is a heathland which is a protected Site of Special Scientific Interest.

==Demography==

The 2011 census records the population of Bournemouth as 183,491, comprising 91,386 males and 92,105 females, which equates to 49.8% and 50.2% of the population respectively. The mean average age of all persons is 40 years. With 4,000 residents per square kilometre, Bournemouth has the highest population density of any authority in the South-West region, and is the eighth most populated.

Much of the population, 83.8%, describe their ethnicity as &#x27;White British&#x27; while other white groups account for a further 8.1%. Asian groups; Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese and other Asian, make up 3.9%. Black British, Black African, Black Caribbean and other Black groups form 1.0% of the population, Those who are Mixed race make up 2.3% of the population, and 0.9% are from other ethnic groups.

Christians made up 57.1% of the population but 30% of residents said they had no religion and 7.8% declined to say whether they were religious or not. Muslims were 1.8%, Buddhists, Hindus and Jews each had a 0.7% share, Sikhs were 0.1%. and other religions made up 0.7%.

Of all Bournemouth residents aged 16 or over, 19.1% had no qualifications at all, although 35% said they had between one and four O-levels, CSEs, GCSEs or equivalent, and 36.5% have more than five O-level equivalents (grade C and above), an A-level or two to three AS-levels. Those with an NVQ level 1 comprise 8.0% of the population while 15.2% have a level 2 NVQ, a City and Guilds craft certificate, BTEC or general diploma. Just over 20% of residents had two or more A-levels, four or more AS-Levels or an advanced diploma while 15.8% possessed a degree, such as a BA or BSc or a higher degree such as an MA or PhD. An NVQ level 4 or 5, HNC, HND, higher BTEC or higher diploma, is held by 4.2% and a professional qualification is held by 13.9% of residents. An apprenticeship has been completed by 6.3% of the population while 16.9% have some other work-related or vocational qualification and 8.3% hold a foreign qualification.
Historically, Bournemouth has suffered from negative rates of natural increase and has relied on immigration to maintain population growth. In 2007, however, births exceeded deaths for the first time, and this trend has continued through to 2011. This, coupled with a substantial increase in people moving into the area, has led to a sharp rise in the resident population since 2001. Of the total population, 3.3% are 85 or over, compared to 2.2% nationally; however the largest group of people moving into the area are students in the 16-24-year age group, and 9% of the current population are between 20 and 24. In England this age group accounts for only 7%. According to the Centre for Cities in 2016, Bournemouth&#x27;s population had the third highest average age among 63 large towns and cities in the UK, at 42.8 years.
==Economy==

Similarly to the rest of Dorset, Bournemouth&#x27;s economy is primarily in the service sector, which employed 95% of the workforce in 2010. This was 10% higher than the average employment in the service sector for Great Britain and 11% higher than the South West. Of particular importance are the financial and public service sectors which through 2011 continued to show sustained growth. Compared to the rest of the country, Bournemouth performed well in these two areas but under performed in transport and communications.

The smallest geographical region for which gross value added information is available is the NUTS3 area, Bournemouth and Poole. The latest figures, , are for the year 2009 which showed that the Bournemouth and Poole area enjoyed the strongest annualised growth in the South-West region. In 2009 the South West Regional Accounts showed that the Financial Services sector in Bournemouth was worth £1,031.8 million in Gross Value Added. Important employers in this sector include JPMorgan, Nationwide Building Society, and the Liverpool Victoria, Tata Consultancy Services (formerly Unisys), and RIAS insurance companies. The manufacturing sector is predominantly based in neighbouring Poole, but still employed 2% of the workforce in 2010 and 2.6% in 2011. Notable employers in this sector include Escor Toys and Parvalux.

Tourism is also important to the local economy. In 2011, domestic and overseas visitors made more than 5.6 million trips to the town and spent over £460 million between them. The equivalent of 8,531 full-time jobs exist as a result which accounts for 15% of all employment in the town. Bournemouth seafront is one of the UK&#x27;s biggest attractions with 4.5 million visitors in 2011. RNLI lifeguards provide seasonal coverage of Bournemouth&#x27;s beaches.

With a third of all town centre businesses in the leisure industry, Bournemouth has a booming nightlife economy and is a popular destination for stag and hen parties. These party-goers contribute £125 million a year to the economy and support 4,000 jobs. In 2010 the town was awarded a Purple Flag for providing a wide variety of night-time activities while maintaining the safety of both residents and visitors. An independent report published in 2012 indicates there has been a rise in antisocial behaviour which it attributes to the increase in nightlife.

Those of working age make up approximately 65% of Bournemouth&#x27;s population and of these, 74.6% are economically active although not necessarily employed within the Bournemouth area. Industry in Bournemouth employed more than 76,400 people in 2011 but not all of these were Bournemouth residents. Of those employed in Bournemouth based industries, 29.32% were employed in the public administration, education and health sector. This compares favourably with Dorset, the South-West region, and the country as a whole, as do the other large sectors; distribution, hotels &amp; restaurants (29.06%), and banking, finance and insurance (24.48%).
37.2% of Bournemouth&#x27;s resident population are employed full-time while 13.3% are employed part-time. An additional 7.1% full-time workers are self-employed, 3.1% are self-employed part-time. Full-time students with jobs account for 5.3% and 3.8% are unemployed.

The shopping streets are mostly pedestrianised with modern shopping malls, Victorian arcades and a large selection of bars, clubs, and cafés. Westover Road in central Bournemouth has been referred to in local press as the &quot;Bond Street of Bournemouth&quot; due to the shops there, one of which has been present since 1909, selling predominantly high-end goods.
North of the centre there is an out-of-town shopping complex called Castlepoint. The site has 40 units and was the largest shopping centre in the UK when it opened it 2003. Other major shopping areas are situated in the districts of Westbourne and Boscombe.

==Culture==
Bournemouth is a tourist and regional centre for leisure, entertainment, culture and recreation. Local author and former mayor, Keith Rawlings, suggests that Bournemouth has a thriving youth culture due to its large university population and many language school students. In recent years, Bournemouth has become a popular nightlife destination with UK visitors and many clubs, bars and restaurants are located within the town centre. In a 2007 survey by First Direct, Bournemouth was found to be the happiest place in the UK, with 82% of people questioned saying they were happy with their lives.

Major venues for concerts include BIC, Pavilion Theatre and O2 Academy. Built in 1984, the BIC is also a popular place for party political conferences and has been used by all three major political parties. Its four auditoria make it the largest venue on the south coast. The O2 and Pavilion are older and are both Grade II listed buildings. The O2, which opened in 1895 as the Grand Pavilion Theatre, was initially used as a circus and later for music hall theatre. The Pavilion opened in 1929 as concert hall and tea room while also providing a venue for the municipal orchestra. It continues to provide traditional entertainment today, presenting West End stage shows, ballet and operas. The Palace Court Theatre opened in 1931, was later used as a Christian centre, and has recently been bought and reopened as a theatre by Arts University Bournemouth. Bournemouth has more than 200 listed buildings, mainly from the Victorian and Edwardian eras, including three Grade I listed churches: St Peter&#x27;s (largely by the architect G. E. Street), St Clement&#x27;s (the first major church by J. D. Sedding) and St Stephen&#x27;s (considered a masterpiece of J. L. Pearson&#x27;s).

The Russell-Cotes Museum is a Grade II* listed, villa completed in 1901. It houses artefacts and paintings collected by the Victorian philanthropist Merton Russell-Cotes and his wife during their extensive travels around the world. The four art galleries display paintings by William Powell Frith, Edwin Landseer, Edwin Long, William Orchardson, Arthur Hughes, Albert Moore and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. It was Russell-Cotes who successfully campaigned to have a promenade built; it runs continuously along the Bournemouth and Poole shoreline.
The Lower, Central and Upper Gardens are Grade II* public parks, leading for several miles down the valley of the River Bourne through the centre of the town to the sea. Bournemouth has a further of parkland. Initially serving to compensate for the loss of common rights after common land was enclosed in 1802, it was held in trust until 1889 when ownership passed to Bournemouth Corporation and the land became five public parks: King&#x27;s Park, Queen&#x27;s Park, Meyrick Park, Seafield Gardens and Redhill Common.

The detailed Land Use Survey by the Office for National Statistics in 2005 noted that the local authority area of Bournemouth had the third-highest proportion of land taken up by domestic gardens, 34.6%, of the 326 districts in England; narrowly less than the London Boroughs of Harrow and Sutton at the time with 34.7% and 35.1%.

One of Bournemouth&#x27;s most noted cultural institutions is Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra which was formed in 1893 under Dan Godfrey. It became the first municipal orchestra in the country when in 1896, Bournemouth Borough Council took control and Godfrey was appointed musical director and head of the town&#x27;s entertainments. Originally playing three concerts a day during the summer season, in the great glass palm house known as the Winter Gardens; the orchestra is now based in Poole and performs around 130 concerts a year across Southern England.
Bournemouth is currently host to a number of festivals. Bournemouth Food and Drink Festival is a ten-day event which combines a market with live cookery demonstrations. The Arts by the Sea Festival is a mix of dance, film, theatre, literature, and music which was launched in 2012 by the local university, the Arts University Bournemouth, and is set to become an annual event. The Bourne Free carnival is held in the town each year during the summer. Initially a gay pride festival, it has become a celebration of diversity and inclusion.

Since 2008, Bournemouth has held its own air festival over four days in August. This has featured displays from the Red Arrows as well as appearances from the Yakovlevs, Blades, Team Guinot Wing-Walkers, Battle of Britain Memorial Flight including Lancaster, Hurricane, Spitfire and also the last flying Vulcan. The festival has also seen appearances from modern aircraft such as the Eurofighter Typhoon. The air festival attracts up to a million people over the four-day event. Bournemouth 7s Festival is a sports and music festival taking place in May each year. Hosting rugby, netball, hockey, dodgeball and volleyball tournaments, the event is a celebration of team sports in a festival atmosphere and was launched in 2008.
The town was especially rich in literary associations during the late 19th century and earlier years of the 20th century. P. C. Wren author of Beau Geste, Frederick E. Smith, writer of the 633 Squadron books, and Beatrice Webb, later Potter, all lived in the town. Paul Verlaine taught at a Bournemouth preparatory school and the writer J. R. R. Tolkien, spent 30 years taking holidays in Bournemouth, staying in the same room at the Hotel Miramar. He eventually retired to the area in the 1960s with his wife Edith, where they lived close to Branksome Chine. Tolkien died in September 1973 at his home in Bournemouth but was buried in Oxfordshire. The house was demolished in 2008.

Sir Percy Shelley, 3rd Baronet, lived at Boscombe Manor, a house he had built for his mother, Mary Shelley, the writer and author of the Gothic horror novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Mary died before the house was completed but she was buried in Bournemouth, in accordance with her wishes. The family plot in St Peter&#x27;s churchyard also contains her parents William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft, and the heart of her husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley.
Robert Louis Stevenson wrote &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; and most of his novel &quot;Kidnapped&quot; from his house &quot;Skerryvore&quot; on the west cliff, Westbourne. A novel of Stevenson&#x27;s life while residing in Westbourne was written by Adelaide A. Boodle, who had met him there. Henry James, already acquainted with Stevenson through correspondence, and residing in Bournemouth in 1885 in large part because his invalid sister Alice lived there, visited Stevenson most evenings.

Vladimir Chertkov established a Tolstoyan publishing house with other Russian exiles at Tuckton, and under the &#x27;Free Age Press&#x27; imprint, published the first edition of several works by Leo Tolstoy. In Roald Dahl&#x27;s 1983 children&#x27;s dark fantasy novel &quot;The Witches&quot;, the international conference of witches is set in a luxury hotel in Bournemouth. Author Bill Bryson worked for a time with the &quot;Bournemouth Echo&quot; newspaper and wrote about the town in his 1995 work &quot;Notes from a Small Island&quot;.

==Landmarks==
Bournemouth has many historic landmarks, mainly dating from the Victorian and Edwardian era.
Bournemouth has three Grade I listed churches, St Peter&#x27;s and St Stephen&#x27;s in the town centre and St Clement&#x27;s in Boscombe. St Peter&#x27;s was the town&#x27;s first church, completed in 1879 and designed by George Edmund Street. In his book, &quot;England&#x27;s Thousand Best Churches&quot;, Simon Jenkins describes the chancel as &quot;one of the richest Gothic Revival interiors in England&quot;, while the spire dominates the surrounding skyline. When the architect, John Loughborough Pearson, designed St Stephen&#x27;s his aim was to &quot;bring people to their knees&quot;. It has a high stone groined roof, twin aisles and a triforium gallery, although the tower lacks a spire. Other listed churches include the Victorian St Mark&#x27;s Church in the historic Talbot Village and the 12th-century St. Andrew&#x27;s Church in Kinson.

The borough has two piers: Bournemouth Pier, close to the town centre, and the shorter but architecturally more important Boscombe Pier. Designed by the architect Archibald Smith, Boscombe Pier opened in 1889 as a structure which was extended to in 1927 when a new head was constructed. Added in 1958, the boomerang-shaped entrance kiosk and overhanging concrete roof is now a Grade II listed building. In 1961 a theatre was added but this was demolished in 2008 when the rest of the pier was renovated. In 2009, fashion designer Wayne Hemingway described Boscombe Pier as &quot;Britain&#x27;s coolest pier&quot;. It was also voted Pier of the Year 2010 by the National Piers Society.

In 1856, Bournemouth Pier was a simple, wooden jetty. This was replaced by a longer, wooden pier five years later, and a cast-iron structure in 1880. Two extensions to the pier in 1894 and 1905, brought the total length to . After World War II, the structure was strengthened to allow for the addition of a Pier Theatre, finally constructed in 1960. This survived until the 2000s when it was turned into a climbing adventure centre. Between 1979 and 1981, a £1.7 million redevelopment programme, saw a great deal of reconstruction work, and the addition of a large two-storey, octagonal-shaped entrance building.

Built as the Mont Dore Hotel in 1881, Bournemouth Town Hall was designated a Grade II listed building in 2001. Designed by Alfred Bedborough in the French, Italian and neo-classical styles, the foundation stone was laid by King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway and the hotel opened in 1885. The buff brick exterior features Bath stone dressings and terracotta friezes. The main entrance is sited within a projected façade that reaches to the eaves and is topped with a pediment, while above sits a belvedere with turrets and a pavilion roof. During the First World War the hotel was used as a hospital for British and Indian soldiers and after as a convalescent home. It never opened as a hotel again and was purchased by Bournemouth Borough Council in 1919. Other Victorian hotels in Bournemouth include the Royal Bath Hotel in the Town Centre and the Norfolk Royale Hotel in Richmond Hill.

Built in the Art Deco style in 1929, situated close to the seafront, the Pavilion Theatre was at the time considered to be the greatest ever municipal enterprise for the benefit of entertainment. Built from brick and stone, the frontage features square Corinthian columns. Still a popular venue, it is today a Grade II listed building.
The Bournemouth Eye was a helium-filled balloon attached to a steel cable in the town&#x27;s lower gardens. The spherical balloon was in circumference and carried an enclosed, steel gondola. Rising to a height of , it provided a panoramic view of the surrounding area for up to 28 passengers.
 After the balloon suffered damage in 2016, the Bournemouth Borough Council, Lower Central Gardens Trust and S&amp;D Leisure announced in 2017 that the contract for operating the Bournemouth Eye would not be renewed due to &quot;increased operating costs.&quot;

Bournemouth is known for having only one &quot;street&quot;. This is Orchard Street, now a small alley between Commercial Road and Terrace Road. Originally named because it led to an orchard, it pre-dates the build up of the modern town. The 19th century developers thought that names such as Road, Avenue and Drive would be more suitable names, with Street associated with poorer areas of existing towns and cities.

==Sport==
The town has a professional football club, AFC Bournemouth, which plays in the Premier League. Known as the &quot;Cherries&quot;, they play at Dean Court stadium near Boscombe in Kings Park, east of the town centre.

Bournemouth Rugby Club, which competes in the National League Division Two South, has its home at Bournemouth Sports Club; it is sited next to Bournemouth Airport. It hosts an annual Bournemouth 7s Festival, the world&#x27;s largest sport and music festival, combining Rugby sevens, netball, hockey, dodgeball and crossfit tournaments with festival entertainment. Oakmeadians RFC is the oldest RFU accredited rugby club in Bournemouth, established in 1963. They train and play at Meyrick Park, competing in the South West Division.

Bournemouth Cricket Club also plays at Bournemouth Sports Club and is reported to be one of the biggest cricket clubs in the country. Its first team plays in the Southern Premier League.
Dean Park is a former county cricket ground, once home to Hampshire County Cricket Club and later Dorset County Cricket Club. Today it is a venue for university cricket.

The BIC has become a venue for a round of the Premier League Darts Championship, organised by the Professional Darts Corporation.

The Bournemouth Rowing Club is the town&#x27;s coastal rowing club. Established in 1865, as &quot;Westover and Bournemouth Rowing Club&quot;, it is reported to be the oldest sporting association in the county. The club regularly competes in regattas organised by the Hants and Dorset Amateur Rowing Association, which take place on the south coast of England between May and September.

Other watersports popular in Poole Bay include sailing and surfing; there are a number of local schools for the beginner to learn either sport. Bournemouth has the third largest community of surfers in the UK and, in 2009, an artificial surf reef, one of only four in the world, was constructed there. The reef failed to deliver the promised grade 5 wave, suffered a series of delays and ran over budget, finally costing £3.2 million.

The town is also home to Bournemouth and Southampton Octopush Club, otherwise known as underwater hockey. They train at Ringwood Leisure Centre, as well as Totton Health and Leisure Centre in Southampton. In the 2023 Nautilus Tournament, Bournemouth and Southampton OC finished 7th (out of 7) in Division 2.

==Transport==
===Railway===

Bournemouth is the main railway station that serves the town; Pokesdown also serves its eastern suburbs and Branksome the west. All three stations lie on the South West Main Line between Weymouth and London Waterloo.

South Western Railway operates a comprehensive service along this line, which also serves Southampton, Winchester and Basingstoke to the east, with Poole, Wareham and Dorchester South to the west.

Before its closure in 1966, Bournemouth was also served by the Somerset &amp; Dorset Joint Railway which provided direct access to Somerset and the Midlands.

===Road===
The principal route to the town centre is the A338 spur road, a dual carriageway that connects to the A31 close to the Hampshire border. The A31 joins the M27 at Cadnam and, from there, the M3 to London and the A34 to the Midlands and the North can be accessed.

The main road west is the A35 to Honiton in Devon which runs through the South East Dorset Conurbation and continues east as far as Southampton, albeit as a non-primary route. The A350 in the neighbouring borough of Poole provides the only northern route out of the conurbation.

===Buses and coaches===
Bus services are operated by Morebus, who run all local services around the town and to Christchurch, Lymington, New Milton, Poole and Ringwood.

Yellow Buses ceased operating on 4 August 2022; it was the former Bournemouth Council-owned company and successor to Bournemouth Corporation Transport which began operating trams in 1902.

National Express coaches serve Bournemouth Travel Interchange and Bournemouth University. There are frequent departures to London, Gatwick Airport, Poole and Weymouth.

===Air===
Originally an RAF airfield, Bournemouth Airport was transferred to the Civil Aviation Authority in 1944 and was the UK&#x27;s only intercontinental airport before the opening of Heathrow Airport in 1946. Acquired by the Manchester Airports Group in 2001, the airport underwent a £45 million phased expansion programme between 2007 and 2011.

Situated near the village of Hurn in Christchurch, Dorset, the airport is from Bournemouth town centre and serves around 600,000 passengers annually. There are direct flights to 23 international destinations in nine countries: Cyprus, Finland, Greece (3 destinations), Italy (4), Malta, Portugal, Spain (10), Switzerland and Turkey.

==Education==
The Bournemouth local education authority was first set up in 1903 and remained in existence until local government was reorganised in 1974 when Bournemouth lost its County Borough status and became part of the county of Dorset. Under the later reforms of 1997, Bournemouth became a unitary authority and the Bournemouth local education authority was re-established.

The local council operates a traditional two-tier system whereby pupils attend one of the 26 primary schools in the borough before completing their education at secondary school. Bournemouth is one of the minority of local authorities in England still to maintain selective education, with two grammar schools (one for boys, one for girls) and ten secondary modern/non-selective schools. There are also a small number of independent schools in the town. Bournemouth and Poole College offers further education, higher education and community courses. Bournemouth has two universities: Bournemouth University and Arts University Bournemouth, both of which are located across the boundary in neighbouring Poole. They are also home to AECC University College (formally known as Anglo European College of Chiropractic), which is located on Parkwood Road in Bournemouth. In 2012, 60.7% of the borough&#x27;s school leavers gained 5 GCSEs of grade C or above. This was slightly better than the national average of 59.4% and above the average for the rest of Dorset, with 58.8% of pupils from the local authority of Poole, and 54.1% from the remainder of the county, managing to do likewise.

==Religion==

The 2011 census revealed that 57.1% of the borough&#x27;s population are Christian. With all other religions combined only totalling 4.7%, Christianity is by far the largest religious group.
40% of the borough falls within the Church of England Diocese of Salisbury. The remainder, to the east, belongs to the Diocese of Winchester.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Portsmouth incorporates most of Bournemouth with the exception of two small parishes to the west which are covered by the Diocese of Plymouth.

The borough has several notable examples of Victorian church architecture including the previously mentioned St. Peter&#x27;s, the churchyard of which contains the grave of the author Mary Shelley; St Stephen&#x27;s Church, completed in 1898 for services under the influence of the Oxford Movement and St Clement&#x27;s, one of the first churches to be designed by John Dando Sedding, built in Boscombe in 1871. To serve a rapidly expanding population a third church was built in the town centre in 1891. St Augustin&#x27;s church was commissioned by Henry Twells who was &#x27;priest-in-charge&#x27; there until 1900. The largest church in the town is the Richmond Hill St Andrew&#x27;s Church, part of the United Reformed Church. Built in 1865 and enlarged in 1891, it has a seating capacity of 1,100 and is unusually ornate for a non-conformist church.

Holy Trinity Church was built, at 161, Old Christchurch Road, in 1868-9 (tower added 1878) in Italian Romanesque style, designed by Cory &amp; Ferguson of Carlisle; it was deconsecrated in 1973, and burnt down in 1979. The site now contains a modern office building named &quot;Trinity&quot;.
Few purpose-built places of worship exist in the borough for faiths other than Christianity, although with a higher proportion of Jewish residents than the national average, there are three synagogues.
Chabad-Lubavitch of Bournemouth is a branch of the worldwide movement. The Bournemouth Reform Synagogue, formerly known as Bournemouth New Synagogue, is a Reform Jewish synagogue with over 700 members. There is also the architecturally notable Bournemouth Hebrew Congregation synagogue built in 1911 with an Art Nouveau take on the Moorish Revival style. There are also two Christadelphian meeting halls in the town.

The Bournemouth Islamic Centre provides information, support and a place of worship for the Islamic community. There is also a mosque in the town.

* Although it has a significant presence in Bournemouth town centre, Bournemouth University&#x27;s main campus is located in Poole, on the boundary with Bournemouth.
* Bournemouth Airport is located near Hurn in the borough of Christchurch, and was originally named RAF Hurn.
* &quot;Bournemouth Bay&quot; is sometimes used for Poole Bay

<text>Leasowe Lighthouse is an historic lighthouse in Moreton on the Wirral Peninsula in Merseyside, England. The lighthouse was built in 1763 by The Mersey Docks and Harbour Company to guide shipping safely to the Port of Liverpool and is the oldest lighthouse built from bricks in the United Kingdom. The lighthouse became obsolete and was closed in 1908. The last lighthouse keeper was a Mrs. Williams, the only known female lighthouse keeper of the period.

==History==

An Act of Parliament passed in 1761 allowed the Liverpool Docks Trustees to build four lighthouses. Two were built at Moreton. These were the Upper Mockbeggar Light and Lower Mockbeggar Light. When lined up, these allowed for safe passage through &quot;Rock Channel&quot; to the Port of Liverpool. 
The former is now known as Leasowe Lighthouse, while the latter was built one quarter of a mile into the sea and was destroyed by a storm in 1769, with its replacement, Bidston Lighthouse, built in 1771 on Bidston Hill. The other two lighthouses permitted by the Act were built at Hoylake (the name &quot;Hoylake&quot; was derived from &quot;Hoyle Lake&quot;, the name of a channel of water between Hilbre Island and Dove Point, Meols) to facilitate safe access into the Hoyle Lake anchorage. Protected by a wide sandbank known as Hoyle Bank and with a water depth of about 20 feet, it provided a safe anchorage for ships.

Leasowe Lighthouse was in use until 14 July 1908; by this time, the sand banks had shifted so much that Rock Channel was barely navigable, rendering the lighthouse obsolete. The lighthouse was a place of work and also a home. The last lighthouse keeper was a Mrs. Williams, the only known female lighthouse keeper in this period. Upon its closure as a lighthouse, Williams moved into a cottage but kept the lighthouse open as a tearoom during the summer months. In 1930, the lighthouse was bought by the Wallasey Corporation, in 1935 Williams died and the building was closed. The lighthouse was listed as a historic Grade II building with Historic England in 1952. A period of disrepair ensued and the lighthouse became derelict. It was then restored by a community group called &quot;The Friends of Leasowe Lighthouse&quot;.

==Construction==

The lighthouse is a tapering cylindrical design that is one hundred and one feet tall with cavity walls that are several feet thick and a plain balcony. The construction used 660,000 hand-made bricks. It has seven floors. The original wooden staircase was replaced in 1898, with one made of cast iron that has one hundred and thirty steps. The light was originally coal-fired, but in 1772 changed to oil burning. Robert Stevenson said in 1801, while on his lighthouse tour, that the tower had &quot;one reflector of silvered glass 7½ feet in diameter and 13 inches focal distance&quot;. Later, in 1861, it was reportedly equipped with eight Argand lamps and reflectors. It was staffed by a keeper and an assistant, who resided in the tower.

==Location==
The lighthouse is on Moreton Common near Mockbeggar Wharf. The Wharf takes its name from &quot;Mockbeggar Hall&quot;, which is an alternative name for the nearby Leasowe Castle. The area is in the North Wirral Coastal Park and used for recreational purposes such as walking and bird watching.

==Facilities==

The lighthouse is a community facility that is used as a location for numerous activities and is used by the ranger service of the North Wirral Coastal Park. It is used for charity abseiling events and paranormal visits, as well as for a meeting place for running groups. It has also been used by film and television companies. The lighthouse has a small visitor centre and is a focal location on the North Wirral Coastal Park. It is open on the first and third Sunday of every month for visits.

<text>Leasowe () is a village in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, Merseyside, England. Located on the north coast of the Wirral Peninsula, it is approximately to the west of Wallasey.

Historically within Cheshire, Leasowe was part of the old County Borough of Wallasey. It is now within the Leasowe and Moreton East Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral. Leasowe is also part of the parliamentary constituency of Wallasey.

At the 2001 census, Leasowe had a population of 6,180. 
By the time of the 2011 census, specific figures for Leasowe were no longer maintained; the total population of the Leasowe and Moreton East ward was 14,640.

==History==
The name &quot;Leasowex&quot; comes from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Leasowes&quot; or &quot;Meadow Pastures&quot;; its sand dunes are the largest such system on the Wirral. Much of the area is at or below sea level and is protected by the coastal embankment. Houses built in the early 20th century were often flooded and unsanitary but, after about 1926, new roads and drainage were put in by the Borough Council and much new housing was developed. Along the embankment between Leasowe and Moreton are the remains of fortifications built during the Second World War.

The world&#x27;s first passenger hovercraft service operated in 1961–62; the service travelled from Moreton Common and was advertised as between Wallasey and Rhyl in North Wales. However, the service was not profitable and soon ceased.

==Geography==
The River Fender merges with the Birket at Leasowe; the Birket then continues towards West Float at the site of the former Wallasey Pool.

==Landmarks==
===Solar School===

The Solar Campus, on Leasowe Road, is the former St Georges Secondary School, and is the site of the Solar Building, the first building in the world to be heated entirely by solar energy. At 53.4°N, it is also the most northerly. The school was built in 1955, in the contemporary style as the St Georges Secondary School for Girls; in 1958, it was decided to admit boys, requiring a doubling in capacity. 

This was met by building a new block, now known as the Solar Building, to a design by Emslie Morgan, the Assistant Borough Architect, who spent a lifetime looking into ways of harnessing the sun&#x27;s rays. His design featured a high south-facing solar wall, largely of glass, to absorb the sun&#x27;s warmth, a sloping well-insulated roof, and a low blind north-facing wall backing the buildings corridor. The solar wall is built of glass leaves two feet apart; these draw the ultra violet rays from sunshine and reflect them around the walls of the classrooms. The walls become warm and heat the air. Hardly any warmth escapes through the school&#x27;s massively thick roof and walls covered with slabs of plastic foam. On the coldest days it is always inside and, in summer, the school is cooler than its more conventional neighbours; panels inside the glass wall can be turned to deflect heat or absorb it.

A small secondary single-pipe heating system was installed to give additional heating on cold winter days with very few hours of sunlight but, by 1966, it had never been used and was dismantled. In 1963, the Liverpool Echo reported that during the previous winter temperatures never dropped below , while in the summer it was cooler than the older part of the school. 

The property is Grade II listed and is maintained by the Children &amp; Young People&#x27;s Department of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, 

===Leasowe Castle===
Leasowe Castle may have been built for Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby – a patron of Shakespeare – in 1593, possibly (though this is disputed) as an observation platform for the Wallasey races which took place on the sands in the 16th and 17th centuries, and which are regarded as a forerunner of the Derby races. Ferdinando&#x27;s brother William, the 6th Earl, was described as a noted sportsman and is remembered as a keen supporter of the Wallasey races.

At first the castle consisted only of an octagonal tower. This had become disused by 1700, and it became known as &quot;Mockbeggar Hall&quot;, a term often used for an ornate but derelict building. The term &quot;Mockbeggar Wharf&quot; is still used for the adjoining foreshore. The &quot;Mockbeggar Hall&quot; is also the name of a Wetherspoons pub in neighbouring Moreton.

In 1821, ownership passed to the Cust family. After 1826, the building was used as a hotel for some years. The ceiling of the Star Chamber at the Palace of Westminster was brought to the castle in 1836 along with panelling and other furnishings; they had been salvaged from the old Palace of Westminster before the Star Chamber was demolished in an 1806 building project. The Star Chamber was so called because the ceiling was decorated with bright stars. The ceiling and four tapestries depicting the four seasons still remain. Oak panelling from the Star Chamber and some made from the submerged forest along the coast were also installed; however, these were removed in 1893.

Between 1911 and 1970, it became a railway convalescent home; between 1974 and 1980, it was owned by Wirral Borough Council. It reopened as a hotel in December 1982 and was acquired by Lawton Hotels Ltd in 2000. The hotel is now a popular venue for weddings and other family functions, with around 50 bedrooms. Leasowe Castle is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building.

===Leasowe Lighthouse===
Leasowe Lighthouse was built in 1763 by Liverpool Corporation&#x27;s Docks Committee (the forerunner of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board) and is the oldest brick-built lighthouse in Britain. According to local tradition its foundations were built on bales of cotton from a nearby shipwreck. Around 1763, William Hutchinson installed what may have been the first parabolic reflector in a lighthouse. The lighthouse was one of four lights on the North Wirral foreshore, the others being two at Hoylake and another – a lower light – at Leasowe. The latter was soon destroyed by the sea and was replaced by a lighthouse on Bidston Hill in 1771.

The lighthouse was operational until 14 July 1908, 
with the only known female lighthouse keeper in those days, a Mrs. Williams. It then became a tearoom for a period, but was unused before 1989, since when it has been the base for the ranger service of the North Wirral Coastal Park. The lighthouse is a Grade II listed building and houses a visitor centre which is occasionally open to the public.

===Leasowe Hospital===

Leasowe Hospital or &quot;The Leasowe Sanatorium For Crippled Children and Hospital for Tuberculosis&quot;, to give its full and original name, later became known as the Liverpool Open-Air Hospital, Leasowe, and finally Leasowe Hospital. Margaret Beavan (1877–1931) was the driving force of the hospital, admired by all, she was known affectionately as the &quot;Little Mother of Liverpool&quot;, also not quite as complimentary, the &quot;Mighty Atom&quot; and &quot;Clever Beggar&quot;.

The first mention of a sanatorium for children with tuberculosis occurred on 16 December 1911. Slowly, Leasowe Hospital changed from being principally a children&#x27;s T.B. hospital to one for dealing with burns and skin grafts, and then arthritis until its closure in 1979. Another name closely associated with Leasowe, amongst others, is that of (the late) Dr T.R. Littler, Consultant Rheumatologist, who was devoted to Leasowe. Leasowe Hospital was eventually bought by the Wirral Christian Centre in 1981; it was used later as a retirement home and handicap centre. After failing to make that facility work, the buildings were eventually repossessed then later demolished around 2002–03. Luxury flats and houses have since been built on the site.

==== Notable staff at Leasowe Hospital ====
* Edith Marie Tucker (1876-unknown), Matron of the new hospital building from 1915 to 1919. Tucker trained at The London Hospital under Matron Eva Luckes between 1904 and 1906. After her training Tucker remained at the London as a staff nurse, then gained promotion to sister working as holiday sister, night sister, in Outpatients department and in Matron&#x27;s Office until she was seconded to head a party of London Hospital nurses to the Balkan Wars between 1912 and 1913.
* Charlotte Hughes (1883–1961), Matron 1919- 1943. Hughes also trained at The London Hospital between 1906 and 1908. After her training Hughes remained at The London working in various departments including the Private Nursing Institute, as a ward staff nurse, and pupil (student) Midwife, before being promoted to holiday sister, then ward sister. Hughes was in charge of both the TB hospital and adjacent Liverpool Babies Hospital, comprising over 300 beds. In 1927, Hughes wrote an article about Orthopaedic Nursing. Whilst she was Matron at Leasowe, one of Hughes&#x27;s ward sister&#x27;s married, and Hughes &#x27;gave the bride away.&#x27; Probationer nurses trained for two years at Leasowe in the nursing care of children with Surgical Tuberculosis.

==Transport==
Leasowe railway station is a stop on the Wirral Line of the Merseyrail network. Electric trains run every 15 minutes during the day eastbound to and westbound to ; this reduces to 30 minutes in late evenings and on Sundays.

Bus services in the area are operated primarily by Arriva North West, A2B Travel and Al&#x27;s Coaches. Routes connect Leasowe with nearby towns including Birkenhead, Hoylake and Wallasey; the 423 provides a regular service to Whitechapel, Liverpool.

==Governance==
Leasowe is part of the Wallasey parliamentary constituency and represented by Angela Eagle MP.

The majority of the Leasowe area is governed locally as part of the Leasowe &amp; Moreton East ward, which takes in the Leasowe housing estate, developments along Leasowe Road and East Moreton. Between 2008 and 2014, one of the councillors was Ian Lewis - the first-ever Conservative councillor to represent the area on Wirral Council. The most recent local elections took place on 6 May 2021, with the ward being represented by three Labour Party councillors.

<text>Muretus is the Latinized name of Marc Antoine Muret (; 12 April 1526 – 4 June 1585), a French humanist who was among the revivers of an Attic, or anti-Ciceronian, prose style, and is among the usual candidates for the best Latin prose stylist of the Renaissance.

==Biography==
He was born at Muret near Limoges. At the age of eighteen he attracted the notice of the elder Scaliger, and was invited to lecture in the archiepiscopal college at Auch. He afterwards taught Latin at Villeneuve, and then at the College of Guienne, Bordeaux, where his Latin tragedy &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; was presented. Some time before 1552 he delivered a course of lectures in the Collège du Cardinal Lemoine at Paris, which drew a large audience, King Henry II and his queen being among his hearers. In Paris he formed part of the larger circle of humanists and poets that included Jean Dorat and Pierre de Ronsard. He wrote almost exclusively in Latin: epigrams, odes, satires and letters, which were widely circulated before they were printed. His orations remained models for students through the eighteenth century.

His success made him many enemies, and he was thrown into prison on a charge of homosexuality, but released by the intervention of powerful friends. The same accusation was brought against him at Toulouse, and he only saved his life by timely flight. The records of the town show that he was burned in effigy as a Huguenot and as sodomite (1554).

After a wandering and insecure life of some years in Italy, he received and accepted the invitation of the Cardinal Ippolito II d&#x27;Este to settle in Rome in 1559. In 1561 Muretus revisited France as a member of the cardinal&#x27;s suite at the conference between Roman Catholics and Protestants held at Poissy.

He returned to Rome in 1563. His lectures gained him a European reputation, and in 1578 he received a tempting offer from the king of Poland to become teacher of jurisprudence in his new college at Kraków. Muretus, however, who about 1576 had taken holy orders, was induced by the liberality of Gregory XIII to remain in Rome, where he died.

Muretus edited a number of classical authors with learned and scholarly notes. His other works include &quot;Juvenilia et poemata varia&quot;, &quot;orationes&quot; and &quot;epistolae&quot;.

==Works==
*Two volumes of &quot;Scripta selecta&quot;, edited by J. Frey, 1871.
*&quot;Variae lectiones&quot;, edited by Friedrich August Wolf and J. H. Fasi, 1791–1828.
*&quot;The Iuvenilia of Marc-Antoine Muret&quot;, edited and translated by Kirk. M. Summers, Columbus, OH: 2006

<doc id="165535" wikidata="Q549923" url="?curid=165535" title="List of Dreamcast games">
<text>The is a home video game console developed and sold by Sega. The first of the sixth generation of video game consoles, it was released in Japan on November 27, 1998, in North America on September 9, 1999, and in Europe on October 14, 1999. The fifth and final home console produced by Sega, the Dreamcast is the successor to the Sega Saturn, whose commercial failure prompted the company to release it only four years after its predecessor&#x27;s initial release.

All licensed games for the Dreamcast were released on the GD-ROM format, a proprietary CD-based optical disc format jointly developed by Sega and Yamaha Corporation that was capable of storing up to 1 GB of data. The Dreamcast itself features regional lockout.
While the higher-capacity DVD-ROM format was available during the console&#x27;s development, its then-fledgling technology was deemed too expensive to implement at the time, which resulted in ramifications for Sega when competitors such as Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 2 came to market; the Dreamcast was unable to offer DVD movie playback when the general public began switching from VHS to DVD, and its games were unable to take advantage of the DVD&#x27;s higher storage capacity and lower cost. Furthermore, an exploit in the console&#x27;s copy protection system via its support for the little-used MIL-CD format effectively allowed users to play many games burned onto CD-Rs, without any hardware modifications.

The Dreamcast&#x27;s initial release in Japan had four launch titles, which were &quot;Virtua Fighter 3tb&quot;, &quot;Pen Pen TriIcelon&quot;, &quot;Godzilla Generations&quot;, and &quot;July&quot;. The North American debut featured 19 launch titles, which included highly anticipated ones such as &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, &quot;Soulcalibur&quot;, and &quot;NFL 2K&quot;. The European introduction was originally going to feature 10 launch titles, but the list increased to 15 as its delay from the original September 23 launch date allowed the inclusion of a handful of additional titles. Due to the similarity of the Dreamcast&#x27;s hardware with Sega&#x27;s own New Arcade Operation Machine Idea (NAOMI) arcade board, it saw several near-identical ports of arcade games. Plus, since the Dreamcast&#x27;s hardware used parts similar to those found in personal computers (PCs) of the era, specifically ones with Pentium II and III processors, it also saw a handful of ports of PC games. American third-party publisher Electronic Arts, which had extensively supported Sega&#x27;s prior consoles beginning with the Sega Genesis, elected not to develop games for the Dreamcast due to a dispute with Sega over licensing.

Sega discontinued the Dreamcast&#x27;s hardware in March 2001, and software support quickly dwindled as a result. Software largely trickled to a stop by 2002, though the Dreamcast&#x27;s final licensed game on GD-ROM was &quot;Karous&quot;, released only in Japan on March 8, 2007, nearly coinciding with the end of GD-ROM production the previous month. The final first-party game for the Dreamcast was &quot;Puyo Puyo Fever&quot;, released as a Japanese exclusive on February 24, 2004.

This list documents all officially released and homebrew games for the Dreamcast. It does not include any cancelled games, which are documented at the list of cancelled Dreamcast games.

<doc id="165537" wikidata="Q441066" url="?curid=165537" title="Julius Caesar Scaliger">
<text>Julius Caesar Scaliger (; 23 April or August 1484 – 21 October 1558), or Giulio Cesare della Scala, was an Italian scholar and physician, who spent a major part of his career in France. He employed the techniques and discoveries of Renaissance humanism to defend Aristotelianism against the New Learning. In spite of his contentious disposition, his contemporary reputation was high. Jacques Auguste de Thou claimed that none of the ancients could be placed above him and that he had no equal in his own time.

==Biography==
Scaliger&#x27;s father, Benedetto Bordone, was a miniaturist and illuminator. Scaliger himself was known in his youth by the family name Bordone, but later insisted that he was a scion of the house of La Scala, for a hundred and fifty years lords of Verona. He was born in Padua on 23 April or August 1484, though his son later claimed that he was born at the Rocca di Riva, on Lake Garda.

There are two accounts of his life, his own and that of his critics.

===His own account===
When he was twelve, his kinsman the emperor Maximilian placed him among his pages. He remained for seventeen years in the service of the emperor, distinguishing himself as a soldier and as a captain. He also studied art under Albrecht Dürer.

In 1512 at the Battle of Ravenna, where his father and elder brother were killed, his conduct earned him Order of the Golden Spur, augmented with the collar and the eagle of gold.

He left the service of Maximilian, and after a brief employment by another kinsman, the duke of Ferrara, he decided to quit the military life, and in 1514 entered as a student at the University of Bologna. He decided to take holy orders, expecting that he would become cardinal, and then pope, when he would wrest from the Venetians his duchy of Verona, which the republic had taken from his ancestors. He soon gave up this plan, but remained at the university until 1519.

The next six years he passed at the castle of Vico Nuovo, in Piedmont, as a guest of the Della Rovere, at first dividing his time between military expeditions in the summer, and study, chiefly of medicine and natural history, in the winter, until a severe attack of rheumatic gout brought his military career to a close. Henceforth his life was wholly devoted to study. In 1525 he accompanied Antonio della Rovera, bishop of Agen, to that city as his physician.

===Later account===
It was not until some time after his death that the enemies of his son first alleged that he was not of the family of La Scala, but was the son of Benedetto Bordone, an illuminator or schoolmaster of Verona; that he was educated at Padua, where he took the degree of M.D.; and that the story of his life before arriving at Agen was pure invention. It is supported by no other evidence than his own statements, some of which are inconsistent with well-ascertained facts.

===Life at Agen===
The remaining thirty-two years of his life were passed almost wholly at Agen. On his death in 1558 he had a high scientific and literary reputation, though his books gave rise to disputes. He was charged with heresy in 1538 but was acquitted, one of the judges being his friend Arnoul Le Ferron.

==Works==
In 1531 he printed his first oration against Erasmus, in defence of Cicero and the Ciceronians (&quot;Oratio pro Cicerone contra Erasmum&quot;, Paris 1531), dismissing Erasmus as a literary parasite, a mere corrector of texts. It is notable for its vigorous invective and, like his subsequent writings, its excellent Latin. It has been said of it, however, that it misses the point of his opponent&#x27;s treatise &quot;Ciceronianus&quot;. Erasmus did not reply, thinking it was the work of a personal enemy, Meander. Scaliger then wrote a second oration (published in 1536), also full of invective. The orations were followed by a large amount of Latin verse, which appeared in successive volumes in 1533, 1534, 1539, 1546 and 1547. This verse appeared in numerous editions, but was less appreciated by later critics. (One of them, Mark Pattison, agreed with the judgment of Pierre Daniel Huet, who said: &quot;par ses poésies brutes et informes Scaliger a déshonoré le Parnasse&quot;.) He also published a brief tract on comic metres (&quot;De comicis dimensionibus&quot;) and a work &quot;De causis linguae Latinae&quot; (Lyons 1540; Geneva 1580; Frankfurt 1623), in which he analyzes the style of Cicero and indicates 634 mistakes of Lorenzo Valla and his humanist predecessors, claimed to be the earliest Latin grammar using scientific principles and method. He published no other purely literary works in his lifetime.

His &quot;Poetices libri septem&quot; (&quot;Seven books on Poetics&quot;, Lyons 1561; Leyden 1581) appeared after his death. They contained many paradoxes and some elements of personal animosity (especially in his reference to Étienne Dolet), but also contain acute criticism based on the &quot;Poetics&quot; of Aristotle, &quot;imperator noster; omnium bonarum artium dictator perpetuus&quot; (&quot;our Emperor, dictator forever of all good qualities in the arts&quot;), an influential treatise in the history of literary criticism. Like many of his generation Scaliger prized Virgil above Homer. His praise of the tragedies of Seneca over those of the Greeks influenced both Shakespeare and Pierre Corneille.

Scaliger intended to be judged primarily as a philosopher and a man of science and regarded classical studies as a means of relaxation. He was noted for his powers of observation and his tenacious memory. His scientific writings are all in the form of commentaries. It was not until he was seventy that (with the exception of a brief tract on the &quot;De insomniis&quot; of Hippocrates) he felt that any of them were ready for publication. In 1556 he printed his &quot;Dialogue&quot; on the &quot;De plantis&quot; attributed to Aristotle, and in 1557 his &quot;Exotericarum exercitationum&quot; (&quot;Exoteric Exercises&quot;, or simply &quot;Exercitationes&quot;) on Gerolamo Cardano&#x27;s &quot;De Subtilitate&quot;. His other scientific works, commentaries on Theophrastus&#x27; &quot;De causis plantarum&quot; and Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;History of Animals&quot;, he left in a more or less unfinished state, and they were not printed until after his death.

His work shows no sign of the inductive reasoning attributed to the scientific method. Unlike his contemporary Konrad von Gesner, he was not led by his botanical studies to a natural system of classification. He rejected the discoveries of Copernicus. He was guided by Aristotle in metaphysics and in natural history and by Galen in medicine, but did not follow them uncritically.

He is best known for his critical &quot;Exotericarum Exercitationes&quot; on Cardan&#x27;s &quot;De Subtilitate&quot; (1557), a book approaching natural philosophy and which had a long popularity. The &quot;Exercitationes&quot; display encyclopaedic knowledge and accurate observation; but, as noted by Gabriel Naudé, they are not flawless. They had an influence upon natural historians, philosophers and scientists such as Lipsius, Francis Bacon, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Johannes Kepler. Charles Nisard wrote that Scaliger&#x27;s object seems to be to deny all that Cardan affirms and to affirm all that Cardan denies. Yet Leibniz and Sir William Hamilton recognize him as the best modern exponent of the physics and metaphysics of Aristotle.

==Family==
A few days after his arrival at Agen he fell in love with an orphan of thirteen, Andiette de Roques Lobejac; she was a distant relative of the aristocratic house of Rochepozay (also Roche-Pozay or Roche-Posay), associates of Jacques Auguste de Thou, one of Scaliger&#x27;s close friends and supporters. Her friends objected to her marriage, as he was then undistinguished. By 1528 he was a successful physician and at forty-five he married Andiette, who was then sixteen. The marriage lasted for twenty-nine years and produced fifteen children, including Joseph Justus Scaliger.

<doc id="165539" wikidata="Q379635" url="?curid=165539" title="Advanced Linux Sound Architecture">
<text>The [[Advanced Linux Sound Architecture|[[Linux API]]]] is composed out of the System Call Interface of the Linux kernel, the [[GNU C Library]] (by [[GNU]]), [[Direct Rendering Manager|libdrm]], libalsa and [[evdev|libevdev]] (by [[freedesktop.org]]).
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) is a software framework and part of the Linux kernel that provides an application programming interface (API) for sound card device drivers.

Some of the goals of the ALSA project at its inception were automatic configuration of sound-card hardware and graceful handling of multiple sound devices in a system. ALSA is released under GPL-2.0-or-later and LGPL-2.1-or-later.

On Linux, sound servers, like sndio, PulseAudio, JACK (low-latency professional-grade audio editing and mixing) and PipeWire, and higher-level APIs (e.g OpenAL, SDL audio, etc.) work on top of ALSA and its sound card device drivers. ALSA succeeded the older Linux port of the Open Sound System (OSS).

==History==
The project to develop ALSA was led by Jaroslav Kysela, and was based on the Linux device driver for the Gravis Ultrasound sound card. It started in 1998 and was developed separately from the Linux kernel until it was introduced in the 2.5 development series in 2002 (2.5.4–2.5.5).

In the 2.6 version, it replaced the previous system, Open Sound System (OSS), by default (although a backwards-compatibility layer does exist).

ALSA has a larger and more complex API than OSS, so it can be more difficult to develop an application that uses ALSA as its sound technology. While ALSA may be configured to provide an OSS emulation layer, such functionality is no longer available or is not installed by default in many Linux distributions.

==Features==
ALSA was designed with some features which were not, at the time of its conception, supported by OSS:
* Hardware-based MIDI synthesis.
* Hardware mixing of multiple channels.
* Full-duplex operation.
* Multiprocessor-friendly, thread-safe device drivers.

Besides the sound device drivers, ALSA bundles a user-space library for application developers who want to use driver features through an interface that is higher-level than the interface provided for direct interaction with the kernel drivers. Unlike the kernel API, which tries to reflect the capabilities of the hardware directly, ALSA&#x27;s user-space library presents an abstraction that remains as standardized as possible across disparate underlying hardware elements. This goal is achieved in part by using software plug-ins; for example, many modern sound cards or built-in sound chips do not have a &quot;master volume&quot; control. Instead, for these devices, the user space library provides a software volume control using the &quot;softvol&quot; plug-in, and ordinary application software need not care whether such a control is implemented by underlying hardware or software emulation of such underlying hardware.

===Applications===
Additional to the software framework internal to the Linux kernel, the ALSA project also provides the command-line tools and utilities codice_1, codice_2, codice_3 and codice_4, an ncurses-based TUI.

There also are GUIs programmed by third-party developers, such as GNOME-ALSAmixer (using GTK), Kmix, XFCE4-mixer, LXpanel, QasHctl, QasMixer, Pavucontrol, AconnectGUI, tapiir, polarbear, ALSAmixerGUI (using FLTK), ZynAddSubFX, Yoshimi, and even more.

==Concepts==
Typically, ALSA supports up to eight &quot;cards&quot;, numbered 0 through 7; each card is a physical or logical kernel device capable of input and output. Furthermore, each card may also be addressed by its &quot;id&quot;, which is an explanatory string such as &quot;&quot;Headset&quot; or &quot;ICH9&quot;&quot;.

A card has &quot;devices&quot;, numbered starting at 0; a device may be of &quot;playback&quot; type, meaning it outputs sound from the computer, or some other type such as &quot;capture&quot;, &quot;control&quot;, &quot;timer&quot;, or &quot;sequencer&quot;; device number 0 is used by default when no particular device is specified.

A device may have &quot;subdevices&quot;, numbered starting at 0; a subdevice represents some relevant sound endpoint for the device, such as a speaker pair. If the subdevice is not specified, or if subdevice number −1 is specified, then any available subdevice is used.

A card&#x27;s &quot;interface&quot; is a description of an ALSA protocol for accessing the card; possible interfaces include: &quot;hw&quot;, &quot;plughw&quot;, &quot;default&quot;, and &quot;plug:dmix&quot;. The &quot;hw&quot; interface provides direct access to the kernel device, but no software mixing or stream adaptation support. The &quot;plughw&quot; and &quot;default&quot; enable sound output where the &quot;hw&quot; interface would produce an error.

An application typically describes sound output by combining all of the aforementioned specifications together in a &quot;device string&quot;, which has one of the following forms (which are case-sensitive):
* &quot;interface:card,device,subdevice&quot;
* &quot;interface:CARD=1,DEV=3,SUBDEV=2&quot;.

An ALSA &quot;stream&quot; is a data flow representing sound; the most common stream format is PCM that must be produced in such a way as to match the characteristics or parameters of the hardware, including:
* &quot;sampling rate&quot;: often 44.1 kHz on home stereos, or 48 kHz on home theaters, yet up to 88.2 kHz, 96 kHz, or even 192 kHz for hi-fi audio production or reproduction.
* &quot;sample width&quot;: measured in some number of bits per sample (such as 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits/sample)
* &quot;sample encoding&quot;: such as endianness
* &quot;number of channels&quot;: 1 for mono, 2 for stereo, or 6 for AC-3/IEC958

==Implementations==
The ALSA System on Chip (ASoC) layer aims to provide better support for ALSA on embedded systems that use a system-on-chip (SoC) design.

Open Sound System version 4 is able to emulate ALSA.

QNX uses a sound system derived from, but not directly compatible with ALSA. The header file and library names are still &quot;asound&quot;, same as the ALSA names. ALSA API uses calls in a way not allowed in the QNX kernel.

<text>The Open Sound System (OSS) is an interface for making and capturing sound in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It is based on standard Unix devices system calls (i.e. POSIX read, write, ioctl, etc.). The term also sometimes refers to the software in a Unix kernel that provides the OSS interface; it can be thought of as a device driver (or a collection of device drivers) for sound controller hardware. The goal of OSS is to allow the writing of sound-based applications that are agnostic of the underlying sound hardware.

OSS was created by Hannu Savolainen and is distributed under four license options, three of which are free software licences, thus making OSS free software.

== API ==
The API is designed to use the traditional Unix framework of open(), read(), write(), and ioctl(), via device files. For instance, the default device for sound input and output is /dev/dsp. Examples using the shell:

 cat /dev/random &gt; /dev/dsp # plays white noise through the speaker
 cat /dev/dsp &gt; a.a # reads data from the microphone and copies it to file a.a

OSS implements the /dev/audio interface. Detailed access to individual sound devices is provided via the directory. OSS also has MIDI support in , (both legacy) and .

On Linux, OSS4 is also able to emulate ALSA, its open-source replacement.

== History ==
OSS was originally &quot;VoxWare&quot;, a Linux kernel sound driver by Hannu Savolainen. Savolainen made the code available under free software licenses, GPL for Linux and BSD for BSD distributions. Between November 1993 (and Linux 1.00) and 1997, OSS was the sole choice of sound system in FreeBSD and Linux. This was changed when Luigi Rizzo wrote a new &quot;pcm&quot; driver for FreeBSD in 1997, and when Jaroslav Kysela started Advanced Linux Sound Architecture in 1998.

In 2002, Savolainen was contracted by the company 4Front Technologies and made the upcoming OSS 4, which includes support for newer sound devices and improvements, proprietary. In response, the Linux community abandoned the OSS/free implementation included in the kernel and development effort switched to the replacement Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). FreeBSD by this time had switched to a &quot;newpcm&quot; project started in 1999 and was not affected.

In July 2007, 4Front Technologies released sources for OSS under CDDL-1.0 for OpenSolaris and GPL-2.0-only for Linux. Drivers for some soundcards remained closed-source and were not included in the release. In January 2008, 4Front Technologies released OSS for FreeBSD (and other BSD systems) under the BSD-2-Clause.

== Adoption status ==

=== Code ===
OSS4 now exists mostly as a standalone piece of software, not integrated into the kernel source code. The exception is Solaris and OpenSolaris, which use a fork of OSS4 called Boomer. It combines the OSS4 framework (audio and mixer) together with Sun&#x27;s earlier SADA (/dev/audio) API.

Although Linux distributions such as Ubuntu made OSS4 available as a software package after it was made free software, they have chosen to ignore any bugs filed against these packages.

=== API ===
The OSS API has remained influential despite the obscurity of the original library. NetBSD&#x27;s documentation describes it as &quot;the preferred API in FreeBSD and Solaris&quot;.

FreeBSD contains an independently developed implementation of the OSS API, which includes, among other things, in-kernel resampling, mixing (vchans), equalizer, surround sound, and independent volume control for each application. It also supports bit-perfect mode. It gradually evolved from the &quot;newpcm&quot; replacement written in 1999 and caught up with OSS4 API around 2005.

NetBSD supports a compatibility mode for the OSS API, by providing the codice_1 header file and the codice_2 library, which internally operate using the native Sun-like audio interface. The replacement was first seen in NetBSD 1.3 of 1998.

Linux had, as aforementioned, switched to Advanced Linux Sound Architecture since 2003 (kernel 2.6). ALSA provides an optional, in-kernel, OSS emulation mode that appears to programs as if it were OSS. ALSA also has a &quot;aoss&quot; userspace program that works by intercepting systems calls directed to the OSS device files.

== OSS/3D ==

OSS/3D is a plugin for music players, which acts as an audio postprocessing engine. Supported players include Winamp, Windows Media Player (9 or later), musicmatch, Sonique, Foobar2000, JetAudio, XMMS. It is ported to Windows and Linux platforms. Unlike the OSS, it is shareware.

4Front OSS3D was later renamed to Joesoft Hear.

== Criticism ==

OSS both as API and as software has been criticized by some developers, such as Paul Davis (of JACK Audio Connection Kit) and Lennart Poettering (of competing PulseAudio).

<text>The Linux Audio Developer&#x27;s Simple Plugin API (LADSPA) is an application programming interface (API) standard for handling audio filters and audio signal processing effects, licensed under LGPL-2.1-or-later. Originally designed through consensus on the Linux Audio Developers mailing list, it now works on a variety of platforms. It is used in many free audio software projects, and there is a wide range of LADSPA plug-ins available.

LADSPA exists primarily as a header file written in the programming language C.

There are many audio plugin standards and most major modern software synthesizers and sound editors support a variety. The best known standard is probably Steinberg&#x27;s Virtual Studio Technology. LADSPA is unusual in that it attempts to provide only the &quot;Greatest Common Divisor&quot; of other standards. This means that its scope is limited, but it is simple and plugins written using it are easy to embed in many other programs. The standard has changed little with time, so compatibility problems are rare.

DSSI extends LADSPA to cover instrument plugins.

LV2 is a successor, based on LADSPA and DSSI, but permitting easy extensibility, allowing custom user interfaces, MIDI messages, and custom extensions.

<doc id="165546" wikidata="Q327849" url="?curid=165546" title="Alpín mac Echdach">
<text>Alpín mac Echdach was a supposed king of Dál Riata, an ancient kingdom that included parts of Ireland and Scotland.

Alpín was included in a pedigree chart created in the 10th century to connect the kings of Alba (Scotland) to legendary Dál Riatan and Irish ancestors. In this pedigree, Alpín&#x27;s father is Eochaid, an Irish name, yet he becomes the father of Cináed (Kenneth MacAlpin) and Domnall mac Ailpín.

Cináed and Alpín are the names of Pictish kings in the 8th century: the brothers Ciniod and Elphin who ruled from 763 to 780. Alpín&#x27;s alleged father Eochaid IV is not mentioned in any contemporary source.

== Parentage and death ==
The Chronicle of the Scottish historian John of Fordun records the succession of &quot;Alpin the son of Achay&quot; in 831, his reign of three years, and his defeat by the Picts &quot;20 July&quot;. The 12th century &quot;Cronica Regum Scottorum&quot; lists &quot;Alpin filius Eochal venenosi iii, Kynedus filius Alpini primus rex Scottorum xvi…&quot; as kings, dated to the 9th century. Alpín&#x27;s parentage is not stated in the earlier chronicles.

Alpín&#x27;s mother was the sister and heiress of Causantín mac Fergusa, King of the Picts. Alpín married a &#x27;Scottish Princess&#x27; and fathered two sons.

Alpín is chiefly remembered for his fatal war with the Picts, who had seized upon and arrogated the kingdom. Alpín resolved to remove the king and met him with his forces near a village of Angus, where the fight was maintained with great obstinacy until the Pictish king was slain, whereby the Scots won. However, a new king of &quot;high descent and noble achievements&quot; (possibly Drest) was elected king of the Picts, turned the scale, and at Galloway defeated and took King Alpín, anno 834, and put him with many of his nobles to death. It is said that Alpín&#x27;s head was fastened to a pole, and carried about the Pictish army, and at last set up for spectacle in Abernethy, their chief town, which was afterwards severely revenged by the Scots, who called the place where he was slain Bas Alpin.

Alpín died on 20 July or in August 834 when he was either killed while fighting the Picts in Galloway or beheaded after the battle. His place of burial is not recorded. His son Kenneth MacAlpin succeeded him.

<doc id="165549" wikidata="Q1277265" url="?curid=165549" title="Earl of Derby">
<text>Earl of Derby ( ) is a title in the Peerage of England. The title was first adopted by Robert de Ferrers, 1st Earl of Derby, under a creation of 1139. It continued with the Ferrers family until the 6th Earl forfeited his property toward the end of the reign of Henry III and died in 1279. Most of the Ferrers property and (by a creation in 1337) the Derby title were then held by the family of Henry III. The title merged in the Crown upon Henry IV&#x27;s accession to the throne in 1399.

The title was created again, this time for the Stanley family, in 1485. Lord Derby&#x27;s subsidiary titles are Baron Stanley of Bickerstaffe in the County Palatine of Lancaster (created 1832), and Baron Stanley of Preston in the County Palatine of Lancaster (1886). The courtesy title of the heir apparent is Lord Stanley. The 1st to 5th Earls also held an earlier Barony of Stanley, created for the 1st Earl&#x27;s father in 1456 and currently abeyant; the 2nd to 5th Earls held the Barony of Strange created in 1299, currently held by the Viscounts St Davids; and the 7th to 9th Earls held another Barony of Strange, created in error in 1628 and currently held independently of other peerages.

Several successive generations of the Stanley Earls, along with other members of the family, have been prominent members of the Conservative Party, and at least one historian has suggested that this family rivals the Cecils (Marquesses of Salisbury) as the single most important family in the party&#x27;s history. They were at times one of the richest landowning families in England.

The Earls of Derby have given their name to a number of sporting events: the Epsom Derby (usually known simply as the Derby) in horse racing, named for the 12th Earl; the Stanley Cup, the championship trophy of the National Hockey League, presented to the Dominion of Canada in 1892 by the 16th Earl, during his tenure as Governor General of Canada; and the Lord Derby Cup, contested by French rugby league clubs, donated by the 17th Earl, a former British ambassador to Paris. The term &quot;local derby&quot; in sport, referring to a contest between rivals in the same sport with geographically proximate home grounds, may also derive from the family&#x27;s title and interest in sport.

The family seat is Knowsley Hall, near Liverpool, Merseyside.

==The Ferrers creation==
Ferrières in Normandy, the hometown of the de Ferrers family, was an important centre for iron () and takes its name from the iron ore mines used during the Gallo-Roman period. Lord of Longueville, Normandy, and a Domesday Commissioner; he built Tutbury Castle and Duffield Castle and had large holdings in Derbyshire as well as 17 other counties. 

Robert de Ferrers, 1st Earl of Derby (1062–1139) was created Earl of Derby by King Stephen in 1138 for his valiant conduct at the Battle of Northallerton. He was married to Hawise de Vitre and died in 1139.

His son Robert de Ferrers, 2nd Earl of Derby (?–bef.1160) became the next earl and was married to Margaret Peverel. He founded Darley Abbey and Merevale Abbey.

His son William de Ferrers, 3rd Earl of Derby (died 1190) was married to Sybil de Braose. He rebelled against King Henry II and was imprisoned at Caen, Normandy. He died in the Crusades at the Siege of Acre.

He was succeeded by his son William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby (died 1247) who married Agnes de Kevelioc (also known as Agnes of Chester), daughter of Hugh de Kevelioc, 3rd Earl of Chester.

He was succeeded by his son William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby (died 1254) who married Sibyl Marshall and then Margaret de Quincy with whom he had his son and heir Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby (1239–1279), who became the next Earl.

He rebelled against King Henry III and was arrested and imprisoned first in the Tower of London, then in Windsor Castle and Wallingford Castle, and in 1266 his lands and earldom were forfeited, including Tutbury Castle which still belongs to the Duchy of Lancaster. Through one line the descent of the Earls of Derby eventually gave rise to the Earls Ferrers. Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers, was the only peer of the realm to be hanged for murder. Another familial line takes in the Baron Ferrers of Chartley descent.

NOTE HOWEVER:
This lineage conflicts with Burke (1831) (pp. 192–194)

In that volume he gives the lineage as:
*Robert de Ferrers - created 1st Earl after the Battle of the Standard.
*Robert de Ferrers - 2nd Earl.
*William de Ferrers - 3rd Earl who married Margaret, d. and heiress of William Peverel, of Nottingham.
*Robert de Ferrers - 4th Earl who married Sybilla, daughter of William de Braose. It was Robert who rebelled against Henry II.
*William de Ferrers - 5th Earl who accompanied Richard I on Crusade and died at the siege of Acre.
*William de Ferrers - 6th Earl who was closely associated with William Marshall (Earl of Pembroke); and then his son -
*William de Ferrers - 7th Earl who had livery of Chartley Castle and married the d. of William Marshall with whom he had seven daughters.

== Creation of Edward III ==
The large estates which were taken from Robert in 1266 were given by Henry III to his son, Edmund Crouchback; and his son, Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, also called himself Earl Ferrers. In 1337 Edmund&#x27;s grandson, Henry of Grosmont ( – 1361), afterwards Duke of Lancaster, was created Earl of Derby, and this title was taken by Edward III&#x27;s son, John of Gaunt, who had married Henry&#x27;s daughter, Blanche. John of Gaunt&#x27;s son and successor was Henry Bolingbroke, who acceded to the throne as Henry IV in 1399. The title Earl of Derby then merged in the Crown.

== The Stanley creation ==
The Stanley family was descended from Ligulf of Aldithley, who was also the ancestor of the Audleys (see Audley-Stanley family). One of his descendants married an heiress whose marriage portion included Stoneley, Staffordshire – hence the name Stanley. Sir Thomas Stanley served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and represented Lancashire in the House of Commons. In 1456 he was summoned to the House of Lords as Lord Stanley. His eldest son Thomas Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley, married Lady Margaret Beaufort, the mother of King Henry VII, and also Eleanor Nevill. The title of Earl of Derby was conferred on him in 1485 by his stepson Henry VII after the Battle of Bosworth Field where Thomas decided to betray King Richard III. The title may derive from the family&#x27;s extensive lands in the hundred of West Derby, Lancashire, rather than the county or city of Derby.

His eldest son and heir apparent George Stanley, Lord Stanley (commonly called Lord Strange), married Joan Strange, 9th Baroness Strange and 5th Baroness Mohun, and was summoned to the House of Lords as Lord Strange in right of his wife. Lord Derby was succeeded by his grandson Thomas, the eldest son of Lord Strange. He had already succeeded his mother as tenth Baron Strange and sixth Baron Mohun. He married Anne Hastings, daughter of Lord Hungerford and Hastings. The second Earl&#x27;s son Edward became the 3rd Earl. He notably served as Lord High Steward at the coronation of Queen Mary of England in 1553 and was Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire and Lancashire.

Lord Derby was married four times. His second wife Dorothy Howard, daughter of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk, supplied his heir Henry, the fourth Earl. He served as Ambassador to France and was one of the peers at the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1586. Lord Derby married Margaret Clifford, daughter of Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland, and his wife Eleanor, younger daughter of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and his wife Mary Tudor, daughter of King Henry VII. Both Lord Derby&#x27;s sons succeeded to the earldom. The eldest son Ferdinando, the fifth Earl, was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Strange in 1589. He also built Leasowe Castle, probably as an observation platform for watching horse races on the nearby sands. Lord Derby married Alice Spencer but was without male issue. He died under mysterious circumstances and some have claimed that he was poisoned to prevent him from staking a claim to the throne of England through his maternal grandmother. On his death, the baronies of Stanley, Strange and Mohun fell into abeyance between his three daughters.

He was succeeded in the earldom by his younger brother William, the sixth Earl. He was Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire and Cheshire and purchased from his nieces their claims in the Isle of Man. William married Elizabeth de Vere daughter of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. Their son James succeeded to the earldom on his father&#x27;s death. In 1628, during his father&#x27;s lifetime, he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration as Lord Strange, as it was believed that his father held this title. When it was discovered that this was a mistake, the House of Lords decided that there were two baronies of Strange, the original 1299 creation and the new, 1628 creation. James was a staunch Royalist. In 1643 he moved to the Isle of Man and established it as a Royalist stronghold. He was beheaded in Bolton, Lancashire by the Parliament forces in 1651. His wife was Charlotte de la Trémouille, daughter of Claude de la Trémoille, Duc de Thouars, who is known as the heroine who defended Lathom House in 1644 and the Isle of Man in 1651.

Their son Charles became the 8th Earl. He served as Lord Lieutenant of both Cheshire and Lancashire. Lord Derby married Dorothea Helena Kirkhoven, daughter of Jehan Kirkhoven, Lord of Heenvliet (in South Holland) and Baron de Rupa of the Netherlands. They had two sons who both succeeded to the earldom. The 8th Earl&#x27;s eldest son William Richard George became the 9th Earl. He was also Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire and Lancashire. He married Elizabeth Butler, daughter of Thomas Butler, Earl of Ossory, and sister of James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde. He had two daughters and one son. He outlived his son and on his death in 1702, the barony of Strange fell into abeyance between his daughters. He was succeeded in the earldom by his younger brother, James, the tenth Earl. He was a politician and served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard. Like many of his predecessors, he was also Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire and Lancashire. In 1732 he succeeded his great-niece as 6th Baron Strange. Lord Derby was childless and on his death in 1736, the male line of the second Earl died out. He was succeeded in the barony of Strange, which could be passed on through female lines, by his first cousin once removed, James Murray, 2nd Duke of Atholl.

The earldom was inherited by his distant relative Sir Edward Stanley, 5th Baronet, of Bickerstaffe, a descendant of a younger brother of the second Earl, who became the 11th Earl of Derby (see below for earlier history of the baronetcy). He had previously represented Lancashire in Parliament and after he succeeded in the earldom he served as Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire. Lord Derby married Elizabeth Hesketh. His residence was Bickerstaffe Hall near Ormskirk, Lancashire. The 11th Earl&#x27;s younger brother was the Hon. and Rev. John Stanley, Rector of Bury Parish Church 1743–1778. Edward&#x27;s eldest son, James, Lord Stanley, was commonly called Lord Strange. Edward outlived James (who died in 1771) and was succeeded by James&#x27; son Edward, the 12th Earl. He held political office as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and also founded The Derby horse-race. Lord Derby married Lady Elizabeth Hamilton, daughter of James Hamilton, 6th Duke of Hamilton. His second marriage was to a Drury Lane actress, Elizabeth Farren.

The 12th Earl&#x27;s first marriage produced his heir Edward, the thirteenth Earl. He represented Preston and Lancashire in the House of Commons and in 1832, two years before he succeeded his father, he was raised to the peerage in his own right as Baron Stanley, of Bickerstaffe in the County Palatine of Lancaster. Lord Derby was also a natural historian and his zoological collections were founded Liverpool Museum. He was also a patron of the arts, especially of the poet Edward Lear who wrote &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot; for the Earl&#x27;s children. He was married to Charlotte Hornby. In 1844, he had a church built on the Knowsley Estate, St. Mary the Virgin, where several Stanleys found their final resting place.

His son, Edward, succeeded him to become the 14th Earl. He is the most famous of the Earls of Derby. Known as a great parliamentary orator, he sat as Member of Parliament for Stockbridge, a seat bought by his father, Windsor and Lancashire North. In 1844 he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Stanley. Although at first a Whig, he later became a Tory and served three times Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Lord Derby was married to Emma Wilbraham, daughter of Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 1st Baron Skelmersdale. They had a daughter and two sons, both of whom succeeded to the earldom. The eldest son Edward Henry, was a prominent politician and served under his father as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Secretary. He became Foreign Secretary again under Benjamin Disraeli. In 1880 he joined the Liberal Party and was Colonial Secretary under William Gladstone between 1882 and 1885.

His younger brother and successor, Frederick Arthur Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby, was a Conservative politician and held office as Secretary of State for War, as Colonial Secretary and as President of the Board of Trade. In 1886, seven years before succeeding his brother, he was raised to the peerage in his own right as Baron Stanley of Preston, in the County Palatine of Lancaster. He was also Governor General of Canada between 1888 and 1893. In 1892, he purchased and donated the Stanley Cup, to be awarded to the &quot;championship hockey club of the Dominion of Canada&quot; each year. Lord Derby was married to Lady Constance Villiers, daughter of George William Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon.

He was succeeded by his son Edward, the seventeenth Earl. Like many of his ancestors he was a politician and notably served as Secretary of State for War. He was also Ambassador to France, and during this time followed his father&#x27;s lead by donating the Lord Derby Cup, given each year to the winners of the French rugby league knockout competition. Lord Derby married Alice Montagu daughter of William Drogo Montagu, 7th Duke of Manchester. A pair of Memorial Gates were erected in 1958 on Knowsley Lane on the Knowsley Estate in his memory. His two sons, Edward Stanley, Lord Stanley, and the Hon. Oliver Stanley both became Conservative politicians and served together in the same cabinet in 1938. Lord Derby outlived his eldest son and was succeeded by his grandson John, the eldest son of Lord Stanley, who became the 18th Earl. He was Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire and also established Knowsley Safari Park in 1971. He married Isabel Miles-Lade but died childless. the titles are held by his nephew Edward Richard William Stanley, 19th Earl of Derby. He is the son of Hugh Henry Montagu Stanley, younger brother of the 18th Earl.

The Stanley baronetcy, of Bickerstaffe in the County Palatine of Lancaster, was created in the Baronetage of England in 1627 for Edward Stanley. He was the great-grandson of the Hon. Sir James Stanley, of Cross Hall, Lathom, younger brother of the second Earl of Derby. This branch of the family is known as the &quot;Stanleys of Bickerstaffe&quot;. Sir Edward Stanley&#x27;s great-grandson, the fourth Baronet, represented Preston in Parliament. His son, the aforementioned fifth Baronet, succeeded as eleventh Earl of Derby in 1736. For further history of the baronetcy, see above.

James Stanley, son of the first Earl, became Bishop of Ely in 1506. He sent a small army into the Battle of Flodden, commanded by his alleged son Sir John Stanley who later entered the monastery of Westminster Abbey.

Edward Stanley, a descendant of Peter Stanley, younger son of the second Baronet, sat as Member of Parliament for Somerset West and Bridgwater.

The Earl of Derby owns Knowsley Hall and Greenhalgh Castle; they were the Lords of Mann, i.e. of the Isle of Man from 1405 until 1594.

Several Earls of Derby are buried in St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Knowsley. Others are buried in the Derby Chapel at Ormskirk Parish Church.

The Barons Stanley of Alderley are members of another branch of the Stanley family. They are descended from the Hon. Sir John Stanley, third son of the first Baron Stanley. Also, Edward Stanley, 1st Baron Monteagle, was the younger son of the first Earl of Derby.

A boarding house of Wellington College was named &#x27;Stanley&#x27; in honour of the 14th Earl. During his time at Wellington, the 17th Earl was a pupil of this house.

<text>A software synthesizer or softsynth is a computer program that generates digital audio, usually for music. Computer software that can create sounds or music is not new, but advances in processing speed now allow softsynths to accomplish the same tasks that previously required the dedicated hardware of a conventional synthesizer. Softsynths may be readily interfaced with other music software such as music sequencers typically in the context of a digital audio workstation. Softsynths are usually less expensive and can be more portable than dedicated hardware.

==Types==
Softsynths can cover a range of synthesis methods, including subtractive synthesis (including analog modeling, a subtype), FM synthesis (including the similar phase distortion synthesis), physical modelling synthesis, additive synthesis (including the related resynthesis), and sample-based synthesis.

Many popular hardware synthesizers are no longer manufactured but have been emulated in software. The emulation can even extend to having graphics that model the exact placements of the original hardware controls. Some simulators can even import the original sound patches with accuracy that is nearly indistinguishable from the original synthesizer. Popular synthesizers such as the Moog Minimoog, Yamaha DX7, Korg M1, Sequential Circuits Prophet-5, Oberheim OB-X, Roland Jupiter-8, ARP 2600 and dozens of other classics have been recreated in software. Software Synth developers such as Arturia offer virtual editions of analog synths like the Minimoog, the ARP 2600, as well as the Yamaha CS-80. GForce produces a Minimoog (with sounds designed by Rick Wakeman) and a version of the ARP Odyssey.

Some softsynths are sample-based, and frequently have more capability than hardware units, since computers have fewer restrictions on memory than dedicated hardware synthesizers. Sample libraries may be many gigabytes in size. Some are specifically designed to mimic real-world instruments such as pianos. Sample libraries&#x27; formats include &quot;.wav&quot;, &quot;.sf&quot; or .sf2.

Often a composer or virtual conductor will want a &quot;draft mode&quot; for initial score editing and then use the &quot;production mode&quot; to generate high-quality sound as one gets closer to the final version. The draft mode allows for quicker turn-around, perhaps in real time, but will not have the full quality of the production mode. The draft render is roughly analogous to a wire-frame or &quot;big polygon&quot; animation when creating 3D animation or CGI. Both are based on the trade-off between quality and turn-around time for reviewing drafts and changes.

===Software instrument===
A software instrument can be a synthesized version of a real instrument (like the sounds of a violin or drums), or a unique instrument, generated by computer software. Software instruments have been made popular by the convergence of synthesizers and computers, as well as sequencing software like GarageBand, Logic Pro, and Ableton Live. Also of note is software like Csound and Nyquist, which can be used to program software instruments.

<text>Joseph Justus Scaliger (; 5 August 1540 – 21 January 1609) was a Franco-Italian Calvinist religious leader and scholar, known for expanding the notion of classical history from Greek and Ancient Roman history to include Persian, Babylonian, Jewish and Ancient Egyptian history. He spent the last sixteen years of his life in the Netherlands.

==Early life==
In 1540, Scaliger was born in Agen, France, to Italian scholar and physician Julius Caesar Scaliger and his wife, Andiette de Roques Lobejac. His only formal education was three years of study at the College of Guienne in Bordeaux, which ended in 1555 due to an outbreak of the bubonic plague. Until his death in 1558, Julius Scaliger taught his son Latin and poetry; he was made to write at least 80 lines of Latin a day.

==University and travels==
After his father&#x27;s death, Scaliger spent four years at the University of Paris, where he studied Greek under Adrianus Turnebus. After two months he found he was not in a position to profit from the lectures of the greatest Greek scholar of the time. He read Homer in twenty-one days, and afterwards read other classical Greek poets, orators, and historians, forming a grammar for himself as he went along. At the suggestion of Guillaume Postel, after learning Greek he learned Hebrew, and then Arabic, becoming proficient in both.

His most important teacher was Jean Dorat, who was able not only to impart knowledge but also to kindle enthusiasm in Scaliger. It was to Dorat that Scaliger owed his home for the next thirty years of his life, for in 1563 the professor recommended him to Louis de Chasteigner, the young lord of La Roche-Posay, as a companion in his travels. The two young men formed a close friendship which remained unbroken until Louis&#x27;s death in 1595. The travellers first went to Rome. Here they found Marc Antoine Muret, who, when at Bordeaux and Toulouse, had been a great favourite and occasional visitor of Julius Caesar Scaliger at Agen. Muret soon recognized the young Scaliger&#x27;s merits and introduced him to many contacts well worth knowing.

After visiting a large part of Italy, the travellers moved on to England and Scotland, passing through the town of La Roche-Posay on their way. During his time in the British Isles, Scaliger formed an unfavourable opinion of the English. Their inhumane disposition and inhospitable treatment of foreigners especially made a negative impression on him. He was also disappointed at finding only a few Greek manuscripts and, in his opinion, few learned men. It was not until a much later period that he became intimate with Richard Thomson and other Englishmen. Over the course of his travels, he became a Protestant.

==France, Geneva, and back to France==

On his return to France, he spent three years with the Chastaigners, accompanying them to their different &quot;châteaux&quot; in Poitou, as the calls of the civil war required. In 1570 he accepted the invitation of Jacques Cujas and proceeded to Valence to study jurisprudence under the greatest living jurist. Here he remained three years, profiting not only by the lectures but even more by the library of Cujas, which filled no fewer than seven or eight rooms and included five hundred manuscripts.

The St Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre – which occurred just before he was to accompany the bishop of Valence on an embassy to Poland – caused Scaliger to flee, alongside other Huguenots, to Geneva, where he was appointed a professor at the Academy of Geneva. While there, he lectured on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Organon&quot; and Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De Finibus&quot; to much satisfaction for the students, but not appreciating it himself. He hated lecturing and was bored with the persistence of the fanatical preachers, accordingly in 1574 he returned to France and made his home for the next twenty years with Chastaigner.

Of his life during this period we have interesting details and notices in the &quot;Lettres françaises inédites de Joseph Scaliger&quot;, edited by Tamizey de Larroque (Agen, 1881). Constantly moving through Poitou and the Limousin, as the exigencies of the civil war required, occasionally taking his turn as a guard, at least on one occasion trailing a pike on an expedition against the Leaguers, with no access to libraries, and frequently separated even from his own books, his life during this period seems most unsuited to study. He had, however, what so few contemporary scholars possessed — leisure and freedom from financial cares.

==Academic output==
It was during this period of his life that he composed and published his books of historical criticism. His editions of the &quot;Catalecta&quot; (1575), of Festus (1575), of Catullus, Tibullus and Propertius (1577), are the work of a man determined to discover the real meaning and force of his author. He was the first to lay down and apply sound rules of criticism and revision, and to change textual criticism from a series of haphazard guesses into a &quot;rational procedure subject to fixed laws&quot; (Mark Pattison).

These works, despite proving Scaliger&#x27;s skill among his contemporaries as a Latin scholar and critic, did not go beyond simple scholarship. It was reserved for his edition of Manilius (1579), and his &quot;De emendatione temporum&quot; (1583), to revolutionize perceived ideas of ancient chronology—to show that ancient history was not confined to that of the Greeks and Romans, but also comprises that of the Persians, the Babylonians and the Egyptians, hitherto neglected, and that of the Jews, hitherto treated as a thing apart; and that the historical narratives and fragments of each of these, and their several systems of chronology, must be critically compared. It was this innovation that distinguished Scaliger from contemporary scholars. Neither they nor those who immediately followed seem to have appreciated his innovation. Instead, they valued his emendatory criticism and his skill in Greek. His commentary on Manilius is a treatise on ancient astronomy, and it forms an introduction to &quot;De emendatione temporum&quot;; in this work, Scaliger investigates ancient systems of determining epochs, calendars and computations of time. Applying the work of Nicolaus Copernicus and other modern scientists, he reveals the principles behind these systems.

In the remaining twenty-four years of his life, he expanded on his work in the &quot;De emendatione&quot;. He succeeded in reconstructing the lost &quot;Chronicle&quot; of Eusebius—one of the most valuable ancient documents, especially valuable for ancient chronology. This he printed in 1606 in his &quot;Thesaurus temporum&quot;, in which he collected, restored, and arranged every chronological relic extant in Greek or Latin.

==The Netherlands==

When Justus Lipsius retired from the University of Leiden in 1590, the university and its protectors, the States-General of the Netherlands and the Prince of Orange, resolved to appoint Scaliger as his successor. He declined; he hated lecturing, and there were those among his friends who erroneously believed that with the success of Henry IV learning would flourish, and Protestantism would be no barrier to his advancement. The invitation was renewed in the most flattering manner a year later; the invitation stated Scaliger would not be required to lecture, and that the university wished only for his presence, while he would be able to dispose of his own time in all respects. This offer Scaliger accepted provisionally. Midway through 1593, he set out for the Netherlands, where he would pass the remaining sixteen years of his life, never returning to France. His reception at Leiden was all that he could have wished for. He received a handsome income; he was treated with the highest consideration. His supposed rank as a prince of Verona, a sensitive issue for the Scaligeri, was recognized. Leiden lying between The Hague and Amsterdam, Scaliger was able to enjoy, besides the learned circle of Leiden, the advantages of the best society of both these capitals. For Scaliger was no hermit buried among his books; he was fond of social intercourse and was himself a good talker.

During the first seven years of his residence at Leiden, his reputation was at its highest point. His literary judgment was unquestioned. From his throne at Leiden he ruled the learned world; a word from him could make or mar a rising reputation, and he was surrounded by young men eager to listen to and profit from his conversation. He encouraged Grotius when only a youth of sixteen to edit Martianus Capella. At the early death of the younger Douza, he wept as at that of a beloved son. Daniel Heinsius, at first his favourite pupil, became his most intimate friend.

At the same time, Scaliger had made numerous enemies. He hated ignorance, but he hated still more half-learning, and most of all dishonesty in argument or quotation. He had no toleration for the disingenuous argument and the misstatements of facts of those who wrote to support a theory or to defend an unsound cause. His pungent sarcasm soon reached the ears of the persons who were its object, and his pen was not less bitter than his tongue. He was conscious of his power, and not always sufficiently cautious or sufficiently gentle in its exercise. Nor was he always right. He trusted much to his memory, which was occasionally treacherous. His emendations, if often valuable, were sometimes absurd. In laying the foundations of a science of ancient chronology he relied sometimes on groundless or even absurd hypotheses, often based on an imperfect induction of facts. Sometimes he misunderstood the astronomical science of the ancients, sometimes that of Copernicus and Tycho Brahe. And he was no mathematician.

==Disagreements with the Jesuits==
But his enemies were not merely those whose errors he had exposed and whose hostility he had excited by the violence of his language. The results of his method of historical criticism threatened the Catholic controversialists and the authenticity of many of the documents on which they relied. The Jesuits, who aspired to be the source of all scholarship and criticism, saw the writings and authority of Scaliger as a formidable barrier to their claims. Muret in the latter part of his life professed the strictest orthodoxy, Lipsius had been reconciled to the Church of Rome, Isaac Casaubon was supposed to be wavering, but Scaliger was known to be an irreconcilable Protestant. As long as his intellectual supremacy was unquestioned, the Protestants had the advantage in learning and scholarship. His enemies therefore aimed, if not to answer his criticisms or to disprove his statements, yet to attack him as a man and destroy his reputation. This was no easy task, for his moral character was absolutely spotless.

==Veronese descent==
After several attacks purportedly by the Jesuits, in 1607 a new attempt was made. In 1594 Scaliger had published his &quot;Epistola de vetustate et splendore gentis Scaligerae et JC Scaligeri vita&quot;. In 1601 Gaspar Scioppius, then in the service of the Jesuits published his &quot;Scaliger Hypobolimaeus&quot; (&quot;The Supposititious Scaliger&quot;), a quarto volume of more than four hundred pages. The author purports to point out five hundred lies in the &quot;Epistola de vetustate&quot; of Scaliger, but the main argument of the book is to show the falsity of his pretensions to be of the family of La Scala, and the narrative of his father&#x27;s early life. &quot;No stronger proof,&quot; says Pattison, &quot;can be given of the impressions produced by this powerful philippic, dedicated to the defamation of an individual, than that it had been the source from which the biography of Scaliger, as it now stands in our biographical collections, has mainly flowed.&quot;

To Scaliger, the publication of &quot;Scaliger Hypobolimaeus&quot; was crushing. Whatever his father Julius had believed, Joseph had never doubted himself to be a prince of Verona, and in his &quot;Epistola&quot; had put forth all that he had heard from his father. He wrote a reply to Scioppius, entitled &quot;Confutatio fabulae Burdonum&quot;. In the opinion of Pattison, &quot;as a refutation of Scioppius it is most complete&quot;; but there are certainly grounds for dissenting from this judgment. Scaliger purported that Scioppius committed more blunders than he corrected, claiming that the book made untruthful allegations, but he did not succeed in adducing any proof either of his father&#x27;s descent from the La Scala family, or of any of the events narrated by Julius before he arrived at Agen. Nor does Scaliger attempt a refutation of the crucial point, namely, that William, the last prince of Verona, had no son Nicholas, who would have been the alleged grandfather of Julius.

Complete or not, the &quot;Confutatio&quot; had little success; the attack attributed to the Jesuits was successful. Scioppius was wont to boast that his book had killed Scaliger. The &quot;Confutatio&quot; was Scaliger&#x27;s last work. Five months after it appeared, on 21 January 1609, at four in the morning, he died at Leiden in the arms of his pupil and friend Heinsius. In his will Scaliger bequeathed his renowned collection of manuscripts and books (&quot;tous mes livres de langues étrangères, Hebraiques, Syriens, Arabiques, Ethiopiens&quot;) to Leiden University Library.

==Sources==
One notable biography of Joseph Scaliger is that of Jakob Bernays (Berlin, 1855). It was reviewed by Pattison in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, vol. cviii (1860), since reprinted in the &quot;Essays&quot;, i (1889), 132–195. Pattison had made many manuscript collections for the life of Joseph Scaliger on a much more extensive scale, which he left unfinished. In writing the above article, Richard Copley Christie had access to and made much use of these manuscripts, which include the life of Julius Caesar Scaliger. The fragments of the life of Joseph Scaliger have been printed in the &quot;Essays&quot;, i. 196–245. For the life of Joseph, besides the letters published by Tamizis de Larroque (Agen, 1881), the two old collections of Latin and French letters and the two &quot;Scaligerana&quot; are the most important sources of information. The complete correspondence of Scaliger is now available in eight volumes.
For the life of his father Julius Caesar Scaliger, the letters edited by his son, those subsequently published in 1620 by the President de Maussac, the &quot;Scaligerana&quot;, and his own writings are full of autobiographical matter, are the chief authorities. Jules de Bourousse de Laffore&#x27;s &quot;Etude sur Jules César de Lescale&quot; (Agen, 1860) and Adolphe Magen&#x27;s &quot;Documents sur Julius Caesar Scaliger et sa famille&quot; (Agen, 1873) add important details to the lives of both father and son. The lives by Charles Nisard – that of &quot;Julius et Les Gladiateurs de la république des lettres&quot;, and that of Joseph &quot;Le Triumvirat littéraire au seizième siècle&quot; – are equally unworthy of their author and their subjects. Julius is simply held up to ridicule, while the life of Joseph is almost wholly based on the book of Scioppius and the &quot;Scaligerana&quot;.A complete list of the works of Joseph will be found in his life by Jakob Bernays.

Grafton, &quot;Joseph Scaliger: A Study in the History of Classical Scholarship&quot;, 2 vol. (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1983, 1993).

<text>Thomas Isidore Noël Sankara (; 21 December 1949 – 15 October 1987) was a Burkinabè military officer, Marxist revolutionary and Pan-Africanist who became President of Burkina Faso from 1983, when he took over in a coup, until his assassination in 1987.

After being appointed Prime Minister in 1983, disputes with the sitting government led to Sankara&#x27;s eventual imprisonment. While he was under house arrest, a group of revolutionaries seized power on his behalf in a popularly-supported coup later that year.

At the age of 33, Sankara became the President of the Republic of Upper Volta and launched an unprecedented series of social, ecological, and economic reforms. In 1984, Sankara oversaw the renaming of the country to Burkina Faso (&#x27;land of the upright people&#x27;), and personally wrote its national anthem. His foreign policy was centred on anti-imperialism and he rejected loans and capital from organizations such as the International Monetary Fund. However, he welcomed some foreign aid in an effort to boost the domestic economy, diversify the sources of assistance, and make Burkina Faso self-sufficient.

His domestic policies included famine prevention, agrarian expansion, land reform, and suspending rural poll taxes, as well as a nationwide literacy campaign and vaccination program to reduce meningitis, yellow fever and measles. Sankara&#x27;s health programmes distributed millions of doses of vaccines to children across Burkina Faso. His government also focused on building schools, health centres, water reservoirs, and infrastructure projects. He combatted desertification of the Sahel by planting more than 10 million trees. Socially, his government enforced the prohibition of female circumcision, forced marriages and polygamy. Sankara reinforced his populist image by ordering the sale of luxury vehicles and properties owned by the government in order to reduce costs. In addition, he banned what he considered the luxury of air conditioning in government offices, and homes of politicians. He established Cuban-inspired Committees for the Defence of the Revolution to serve as a new foundation of society and promote popular mobilization. His Popular Revolutionary Tribunals prosecuted public officials charged with graft, political crimes and corruption, considering such elements of the state counter-revolutionaries. This led to criticism by Amnesty International for alleged human rights violations, such as arbitrary detentions of political opponents.

Sankara&#x27;s revolutionary programmes and reforms for African self-reliance made him an icon to many of Africa&#x27;s poverty-stricken nations, and the president remained popular with a substantial majority of his country&#x27;s citizens, as well as those outside Burkina Faso. Some of his policies alienated elements of the former ruling class, including tribal leaders — and the governments of France and its ally, the Ivory Coast.

On 15 October 1987, Sankara was assassinated by troops led by Blaise Compaoré, who assumed leadership of the country shortly thereafter. Compaoré retained power until the 2014 Burkina Faso uprising. In 2021, he was formally charged with and found guilty for the murder of Sankara by a military tribunal.

== Early life ==

Thomas Sankara was born Thomas Isidore Noël Sankara on 21 December 1949 in Yako, French Upper Volta, as the third of ten children to Joseph and Marguerite Sankara. His father, Joseph Sankara, a gendarme, was of Silmi–Mossi heritage, while his mother, Marguerite Kinda, was of direct Mossi descent. He spent his early years in Gaoua, a town in the humid southwest to which his father was transferred as an auxiliary gendarme. As the son of one of the few African functionaries then employed by the colonial state, he enjoyed a relatively privileged position. The family lived in a brick house with the families of other gendarmes at the top of a hill overlooking the rest of Gaoua.

Sankara attended primary school at Bobo-Dioulasso. He applied himself seriously to his schoolwork and excelled in mathematics and French. He went to church often and, impressed with his energy and eagerness to learn, some of the priests encouraged Thomas to go on to seminary school once he finished primary school. Despite initially agreeing, he took the exam required for entry to the sixth grade in the secular educational system and passed. Thomas&#x27;s decision to continue with his education at the nearest lycée, Ouezzin Coulibaly (named after a pre-independence nationalist), proved to be a turning point. He left his father&#x27;s household to attend the lycée in Bobo-Dioulasso, the country&#x27;s commercial centre. There Sankara made close friends, including Fidèle Too, whom he later named a minister in his government; and Soumane Touré, who was in a more advanced class.

His Roman Catholic parents wanted him to become a priest, but he chose to enter the military. The military was popular at the time, having just ousted Maurice Yaméogo, an unpopular president. Many young intellectuals viewed it as a national institution that might potentially help to discipline the inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy, counterbalance the inordinate influence of traditional chiefs, and generally help modernize the country. Acceptance into the military academy was accompanied by a scholarship; Sankara could not easily afford the costs of further education otherwise. He took the entrance exam and passed.

He entered the military academy of Kadiogo in Ouagadougou with the academy&#x27;s first intake of 1966 at the age of 17. While there he witnessed the first military coup d&#x27;état in Upper Volta led by Lieutenant-Colonel Sangoulé Lamizana (3 January 1966). The trainee officers were taught by civilian professors in the social sciences. Adama Touré, who taught history and geography, was the academic director at the time and known for having progressive ideas, although he did not publicly share them. He invited a few of his brightest and more political students, among them Sankara, to join informal discussions outside the classroom about imperialism, neocolonialism, socialism and communism, the Soviet and Chinese revolutions, the liberation movements in Africa, and similar topics. This was the first time Sankara was systematically exposed to a revolutionary perspective on Upper Volta and the world. Aside from his academic and extracurricular political activities, Sankara also pursued his passion for music and played the guitar.

In 1970, 20-year-old Sankara went for further military studies at the military academy of Antsirabe in Madagascar, from which he graduated as a junior officer in 1973. At the Antsirabe academy, the range of instruction went beyond standard military subjects, which allowed Sankara to study agriculture, including how to raise crop yields and better the lives of farmers. He took up these issues in his own administration and country. During that period, he read profusely on history and military strategy, thus acquiring the concepts and analytical tools that he would later use in his reinterpretation of Burkinabe political history.

== Military career ==
After his basic military training in secondary school in 1966, Sankara began his military career at the age of 19. A year later he was sent to Madagascar for officer training at Antsirabe, where he witnessed popular uprisings in 1971 and 1972 against the government of Philibert Tsiranana. During this period he first read the works of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin, which profoundly influenced his political views for the rest of his life.

Returning to Upper Volta in 1972, he fought in a border war between Upper Volta and Mali by 1974. He earned fame for his performance in the conflict, but years later would renounce the fighting as &#x27;useless and unjust&#x27;, a reflection of his growing political consciousness. He also became a popular figure in the capital of Ouagadougou. Sankara was a decent guitarist. He played in a band named Tout-à-Coup Jazz and rode a bicycle.

In 1976 he became commander of the Commando Training Centre in Pô. During the presidency of Colonel Saye Zerbo, a group of young officers formed a secret organization called &quot;ROC&quot;, the best-known members being Henri Zongo, Jean-Baptiste Boukary Lingani, Blaise Compaoré and Sankara.

== Government posts ==
Sankara was appointed Minister of Information in Saye Zerbo&#x27;s military government in September 1981. Sankara differentiated himself from other government officials in many ways such as biking to work everyday, instead of driving in a car. While his predecessors would censor journalists and newspapers, Sankara encouraged investigative journalism and allowed the media to print whatever it found. This led to publications of government scandals by both privately owned and state-owned newspapers. He resigned on 12 April 1982 in opposition to what he saw as the regime&#x27;s anti-labour drift, declaring &#x27;Misfortune to those who gag the people!&#x27; ().

After another coup (7 November 1982) brought to power Major-Doctor Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo, Sankara became Prime Minister in January 1983. But he was dismissed a few months later, on 17 May. During those four months, Sankara pushed Ouédraogo&#x27;s regime for more progressive reforms. Sankara was arrested after the French President&#x27;s African affairs adviser, , met with Col. Yorian Somé. Henri Zongo and Jean-Baptiste Boukary Lingani were also placed under arrest. The decision to arrest Sankara proved to be very unpopular with the younger officers in the military regime. His imprisonment created enough momentum for his friend Blaise Compaoré to lead another coup.

== Presidency ==
A coup d&#x27;état organized by Blaise Compaoré made Sankara President on 4 August 1983 at the age of 33. The coup d&#x27;état was supported by Libya, which was at the time on the verge of war with France in Chad (see history of Chad).

Sankara identified as a revolutionary and was inspired by the examples of Cuba&#x27;s Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, and Ghana&#x27;s military leader Jerry Rawlings. As President, he promoted the &#x27;Democratic and Popular Revolution&#x27; (, or RDP). The ideology of the Revolution was defined by Sankara as anti-imperialist in a speech on 2 October 1983, the (DOP), written by his close associate Valère Somé. His policy was oriented toward fighting corruption and promoting reforestation.

On 4 August 1984, the first anniversary of his accession, he renamed the country Burkina Faso, meaning &#x27;the land of upright people&#x27; in Mooré and Dyula, the two major languages of the country. He also gave it a new flag and wrote a new national anthem (&quot;Ditanyè&quot;).

=== Council of the Revolution ===
When Sankara assumed power on 4 August, he named the leadership of the country the Council of the Revolution (CNR). This was a way for Sankara to signal that he was going to try for political and social change. The CNR composed of both civilians and soldiers, all ordinary people. But the member count was secret for security reasons and known only to Sankara and others in his inner circle.

The CNR regularly met to talk about important plans and decisions for the country. They helped give advice and direction to the government&#x27;s actions. They voted on suggestions and decisions from governments officials; the decision making was collective. On some occasions, they overruled even proposals favoured personally by Sankara.

=== Healthcare and public works ===

Sankara&#x27;s first priorities after taking office were feeding, housing, and providing medical care to his people who desperately needed it. He launched a mass vaccination program aimed at eradicating polio, meningitis, and measles. From 1983 to 1985, 2 million Burkinabé were vaccinated, significantly improving public health outcomes.

Prior to Sankara&#x27;s presidency, the infant mortality rate in Burkina Faso was about 20.8%. During his time in office, it fell to 14.5%, highlighting the effectiveness of his health initiatives. His administration was also the first African government to publicly recognize the AIDS epidemic as a major threat to Africa, showcasing his forward-thinking approach to public health.

In addition to healthcare, Sankara focused on large-scale housing and infrastructure projects. He established brick factories to help build houses and reduce urban slums. This initiative provided affordable housing and created jobs, contributing to economic stability.

To combat deforestation, Sankara initiated &quot;The People&#x27;s Harvest of Forest Nurseries,&quot; supplying 7,000 village nurseries and organizing the planting of several million trees. This reforestation effort not only aimed to restore the environment but also to create sustainable agricultural practices. His administration connected all regions of the country through an extensive road and rail-building program. Over of rail was laid by Burkinabé people, facilitating manganese extraction in &#x27;The Battle of the Rails,&#x27; without any foreign aid or outside money. These initiatives demonstrated his belief that African countries could achieve prosperity without foreign assistance.

Sankara also prioritized education to combat the country&#x27;s 90% illiteracy rate. His administration implemented successful education programs, resulting in significant improvements in literacy. After his assassination, teachers&#x27; strikes and the new regime&#x27;s unwillingness to negotiate led to the creation of &#x27;Revolutionary Teachers.&#x27; In 1996, nearly 2,500 teachers were fired due to a strike, prompting the government to invite anyone with a college degree to teach through the revolutionary teachers&#x27; program. Volunteers received a 10-day training course before starting to teach.

=== Agriculture ===
In the 1980s, more than 90% of the populace were still agrarian farmers. Less than 6 percent of land that could be irrigated was receiving irrigation, while the rest relied on rain, which was highly unreliable and inadequate. Only 10% of the population had animals for plowing, whilst the rest relied on individual use of short hoes to plow. Few livestock herders had access to fodder; they had to roam the countryside in search of grazing land and watering spots. Because of this, hunger remained prevalent. In years of drought, the rural population was threatened by famines.

In Sankara&#x27;s five-year plan, some 71% of projected investments for the productive sectors were allocated to agriculture, livestock, fishing, wildlife and forests. In 3 years, 25% more land was irrigated because of volunteer projects. In Sourou Valley, a dam was built within a few months almost entirely by volunteer labour. The use of fertilizers increased by 56%. Hundreds of tractors were bought and imported for large-scale cooperative projects.

Hundreds of village cereal banks were built through collective labour organised by the CDRs to help farmers store and market their crops. In the past, farmers would have no way to store surplus grains and had to sell them to local merchants, who would sell the same crops back to the same village for twice the cost.

In August 1984, all land was nationalized. Previously, local chiefs had decided who could farm. In some areas, private land ownership had begun to arise. The total cereal production rose by 75% between 1983 and 1986. In four years, UN-analysts declared Burkinian agriculture as productive enough to be &quot;food self-sufficient&quot;.

=== Environment ===
In the 1980s, when ecological awareness was still very low, Thomas Sankara was one of the few leaders to consider environmental protection a priority. He engaged in three major battles: against bush fires, &#x27;which will be considered as crimes and will be punished as such&#x27;; against cattle roaming, &#x27;which infringes on the rights of peoples because unattended animals destroy nature&#x27;; and against the chaotic cutting of firewood, &#x27;whose profession will have to be organized and regulated&#x27;.

As part of a development program involving a large part of the population, ten million trees were planted in Burkina Faso in fifteen months during the &#x27;revolution&#x27;. To face the advancing desert and recurrent droughts, Thomas Sankara also proposed planting wooded strips of about fifty kilometers, crossing the country from east to west. He thought of extending this vegetation belt to other countries.

Beginning in October 1984, over the space of fifteen months Sankara&#x27;s government planted ten million trees in a campaign of reforestation. Sankara said &quot;In Burkina wood is our only source of energy. We have to constantly remind every individual of his duty to maintain and regenerate nature&quot;.

=== People&#x27;s Revolutionary Tribunals ===
Shortly after attaining power, Sankara constructed a system of courts known as the Popular Revolutionary Tribunal. The courts were created originally to try former government officials in a straightforward way so the average Burkinabé could participate in or oversee trials of enemies of the revolution. They placed defendants on trial for corruption, tax evasion, or counter-revolutionary activity. Sentences for former government officials were light and often suspended. The tribunals have been alleged to have been only show trials, held very openly with oversight from the public.

According to the US State Department, procedures in these trials, especially legal protections for the accused, did not conform to international standards. Defendants had to prove themselves innocent of the crimes they were charged with committing and were not allowed to be represented by counsel. The courts were initially highly admired by the Burkinabé people but were eventually labeled corrupt and oppressive. So-called &#x27;lazy workers&#x27; were tried and sentenced to work for free, or expelled from their jobs and discriminated against. Some created their own courts to settle scores and humiliate their enemies.

=== Revolutionary Defence Committees ===
The Committees for the Defence of the Revolution () were formed as mass armed organizations. The CDRs were created as a counterweight to the power of the army as well as to promote political and social revolution. The idea for the Revolutionary Defence Committees was taken from Cuban leader Fidel Castro, whose Committees for the Defence of the Revolution had been created as a form of &#x27;revolutionary vigilance&#x27;.

=== Relations with the Mossi people ===
A point of contention regarding Sankara&#x27;s rule is the way he handled the Mossi ethnic group. The Mossi are the largest ethnic group in Burkina Faso, and they adhere to a strict, traditional, hierarchical social systems. At the top of the hierarchy is the Morho Naba, the chief or king of the Mossi people. Sankara viewed this arrangement as an obstacle to national unity, and proceeded to demote the Mossi elite. The Morho Naba was not allowed to hold courts. Local village chiefs were stripped of their executive powers, which were given to the CDR.

=== Women&#x27;s rights ===
Sankara had extensively worked for women&#x27;s rights and declared &quot;There is no true social revolution without the liberation of women&quot;.

Improving women&#x27;s status in Burkinabé society was one of Sankara&#x27;s explicit goals, and his government included a large number of women, an unprecedented policy priority in West Africa. His government banned female genital mutilation, forced marriages and polygamy, while appointing women to high governmental positions and encouraging them to work outside the home and stay in school even if pregnant. Sankara promoted contraception and in 1986 all restrictions on contraception were removed. He also established a Ministry of Family Development and the Union of Burkina Women.

Sankara recognized the challenges faced by African women when he gave his famous address to mark International Women&#x27;s Day on 8 March 1987 in Ouagadougou. Sankara spoke to thousands of women, saying that the Burkinabé Revolution was &#x27;establishing new social relations&#x27;, which would be &#x27;upsetting the relations of authority between men and women and forcing each to rethink the nature of both. This task is formidable but necessary&#x27;. In addition to being the first African leader to appoint women to major cabinet positions, he recruited them actively for the military.

=== Agacher Strip War ===
Following the 1974 clashes between Burkina Faso and Mali over the disputed territory of the Agacher Strip, the Organization of African Unity had created a mediation commission to resolve the disagreement and provide for an independent, neutral demarcation of the border. Both governments had declared that they would not use armed force to end the dispute.

But by 1983 the two countries disagreed about the work of the commission. Sankara personally disliked Malian President Moussa Traoré, who had taken power by deposing Modibo Keïta&#x27;s left-leaning regime. On 17 September Sankara visited Mali and met with Traoré. With Algerian mediation, the two agreed to have the border dispute settled by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and subsequently petitioned the body to resolve the issue.

In July 1985 Burkina Faso declared the Malian secretary general of the Economic Community of West Africa, Drissa Keita, a &quot;persona non grata&quot; after he criticized Sankara&#x27;s regime. In September Sankara delivered a speech in which he called for a revolution in Mali. Malian leaders were particularly sensitive to the inflammatory rhetoric, as their country was undergoing social unrest. Around the same time, Sankara and other key figures in the CNR became convinced that Traoré was harbouring opposition to the Burkinabé regime in Bamako and plotting to provoke a border war, which would be used to support a counterrevolution.
Tensions at the border began to rise on 24 November when one Burkinabé national killed another near the border in Soum Province. Malian police crossed the boundary to arrest the murderer and also detained several members of a local Committee for the Defence of the Revolution who were preparing a tribunal. Three days later Malian police entered Kounia to &#x27;restore order&#x27;. Burkina Faso made diplomatic representations on the incidents to Mali, but was given no formal response.

At the beginning of December, Burkina Faso informed Mali and other surrounding countries that it was conducting its decennial national census from 10 to 20 December. On 14 December military personnel entered the Agacher to assist with the census. Mali accused the military authorities of pressuring Malian citizens in border villages to register with the census, a charge which Burkina Faso disputed. In an attempt to reduce tensions, ANAD (a West African treaty organization) dispatched a delegation to Bamako and Ouagadougou to mediate. President of Algeria Chadli Bendjedid contacted Sankara and Traoré to encourage a peaceful resolution. At the request of ANAD members, Burkina Faso announced the withdrawal of all military personnel from the disputed region.

Despite the declared withdrawal, a &#x27;war of the communiques&#x27; ensued as Burkinabé and Malian authorities exchanged hostile messages. Feeling threatened by Sankara, Traoré began preparing Mali for hostilities with Burkina Faso. Three &quot;groupements&quot; were formed and planned to invade Burkina Faso and converge on the city of Bobo-Dioulasso. Once there, they would rally Burkinabé opposition forces to take Ouagadougou and overthrow Sankara.

Former Sankara aide Paul Michaud wrote that Sankara had intended to provoke Mali into conflict with the aim of mobilizing popular support for his regime. According to Michaud, &quot;an official—and reliable—Malian source&quot; had reported that mobilization documents dating to 19 December were found on the bodies of fallen Burkinabé soldiers during the ensuing war.

Sankara&#x27;s efforts to provide evidence of his bona fides were systematically undermined. &#x27;It is hard to believe that the Malian authorities are unaware that the rumors circulating are false,&#x27; says U.S. Ambassador Leonardo Neher. In contrast to Michaud&#x27;s assertion, a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) cable states, &#x27;The war was born of Bamako&#x27;s hope that the conflict would trigger a coup in Burkina Faso.&#x27;

At dawn on 25 December 1985, about 150 Malian Army tanks crossed the frontier and attacked several locations. Malian troops also attempted to envelop Bobo-Dioulasso in a pincer attack. The Burkina Faso Army struggled to repel the offensive in the face of superior Malian firepower and were overwhelmed on the northern front; Malian forces quickly secured the towns of Dionouga, Selba, Kouna, and Douna in the Agacher. The Burkinabé government in Ouagadougou received word of hostilities at about 13:00 and immediately issued mobilization orders. Various security measures were also imposed across the country, including nighttime blackouts.

Burkinabé forces regrouped in the Dionouga area to counter-attack. Captain Compaoré took command of this western front. Under his leadership soldiers split into small groups and employed guerrilla tactics against Malian tanks.

Immediately after hostilities began, other African leaders attempted to institute a truce. On the morning of 30 December, Burkina Faso and Mali agreed to an ANAD-brokered ceasefire. By then Mali had occupied most of the Agacher Strip. More than 100 Burkinabé and approximately 40 Malian soldiers and civilians were killed during the war. The Burkinabé towns of Ouahigouya, Djibo, and Nassambou were left badly damaged by the fighting.

At an ANAD summit in Yamoussoukro on 17 January 1987, Traoré and Sankara met and formalized an agreement to end hostilities. The ICJ later split the Agacher; Mali received the more-densely populated western portion and Burkina Faso the eastern section centred on the Béli River. Both countries indicated their satisfaction with the judgement.

Burkina Faso declared that the war was part of an &#x27;international plot&#x27; to bring down Sankara&#x27;s government. It rejected speculation that it was fought over rumoured mineral wealth in the Agacher. The country&#x27;s relatively poor performance in the conflict damaged the domestic credibility of the CNR. Some Burkinabé soldiers were angered by Sankara&#x27;s failure to prosecute the war more aggressively and rally a counteroffensive against Mali.

The conflict also demonstrated the country&#x27;s weak international position and forced the CNR to craft a more moderate image of its policies and goals abroad. In the aftermath, the Burkinabé government made little reference to supporting revolution in other countries, and its relations with France modestly improved. At a rally held after the war, Sankara conceded that his country&#x27;s military was not adequately armed and announced the commutation of sentences for numerous political prisoners.

=== Relations with other countries ===

Thomas Sankara defined his program as anti-imperialist. In this respect, France became the main target of revolutionary rhetoric. When President François Mitterrand visited Burkina Faso in November 1986, Sankara criticized the French for having received Pieter Botha, the Prime Minister of South Africa, which still enforced apartheid; and Jonas Savimbi, the leader of UNITA, in France, referring to both men as &#x27;covered in blood from head to toe&#x27;. In response, France reduced its economic aid to Burkina Faso by 80% between 1983 and 1985.

, President Mitterrand&#x27;s advisor on African affairs, organized a media campaign in France to denigrate Thomas Sankara in collaboration with the DGSE. It provided the press with a series of documents on supposed atrocities intended to feed articles against him.

Sankara set up a program of cooperation with Cuba. After meeting with Fidel Castro, Sankara arranged to send young Burkinabés to Cuba in September 1986 to receive professional training and to participate in the country&#x27;s development upon their return. These were volunteers recruited on the basis of a competition; priority was given to orphans and young people from rural and disadvantaged areas. Some 600 teenagers were flown to Cuba to complete their schooling and receive professional training to become doctors (particularly gynecologists), engineers, or agronomists.

Denouncing the support of the United States to Israel and South Africa, he called on African countries to boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. At the United Nations General Assembly, he denounced the invasion of Grenada by the United States. The latter nation responded by implementing trade sanctions against Burkina Faso. Also at the UN, Sankara called for an end to the veto power granted to the great powers. In the name of the &#x27;right of peoples to sovereignty&#x27;, he supported the national demands of the Western Sahara, Palestine, the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, and the South African ANC.

While he had good relations with Ghanaian leader Jerry Rawlings and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, Sankara was relatively isolated in West Africa. Leaders close to France, such as Houphouët-Boigny in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and Hassan II in Morocco, were particularly hostile to him.

=== Criticism ===
The British development organization Oxfam recorded the arrest of trade union leaders in 1987. In 1984, seven individuals associated with the previous régime in Burkina Faso were accused of treason and executed after a summary trial. Non-governmental organizations and unions were harassed or placed under the authority of the Committees for the Defence of the Revolution, branches of which were established in each workplace and which functioned as &#x27;organs of political and social control&#x27;.

Three days after Sankara had assumed power in 1983 through the popular revolution, the National Union of African Teachers of Upper Volta (SNEAHV) called Sankara and his government fascist and called upon workers to be ready to fight for their freedom. As a result, the government ordered the arrest of 4 key figures of the SNEAHV, one was released shortly after. In response, the SNEAHV called upon a national teachers&#x27; strike to protest the arrests. The government saw this as something that endangered the politically weak Upper Volta which had already faced 5 coups since its independence. Therefore, the minister for National Education called upon directors of private schools &quot;not to use the services of the strikers in their establishments&quot;. The call affected 1300-1500 teachers.

Popular Revolutionary Tribunals, set up by the government throughout the country, placed defendants on trial for corruption, tax evasion or &#x27;counter-revolutionary&#x27; activity. Procedures in these trials, especially legal protections for the accused, did not conform to international standards. According to Christian Morrisson and Jean-Paul Azam of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the &#x27;climate of urgency and drastic action in which many punishments were carried out immediately against those who had the misfortune to be found guilty of unrevolutionary behaviour, bore some resemblance to what occurred in the worst days of the French Revolution, during the Reign of Terror. Although few people were killed, violence was widespread&#x27;.

== Death ==

On 15 October 1987, Sankara and twelve other officials were killed in a coup d&#x27;état organized by his former colleague Blaise Compaoré. When accounting for his overthrow, Compaoré stated that Sankara jeopardized foreign relations with former colonial power France and neighbouring Ivory Coast, and accused his former comrade of plotting to assassinate opponents.

Prince Johnson, a former Liberian warlord allied to Charles Taylor and killer of the Liberian president Samuel Doe whose last hours of life were filmed, told Liberia&#x27;s Truth and Reconciliation Commission that it was engineered by Charles Taylor. After the coup and although Sankara was known to be dead, some CDRs mounted an armed resistance to the army for several days.

According to Halouna Traoré, the sole survivor of Sankara&#x27;s assassination, Sankara was attending a meeting with the Conseil de l&#x27;Entente. His assassins singled out Sankara and executed him. The assassins then shot at those attending the meeting, killing 12 other people. Sankara&#x27;s body was riddled with bullets to the back and he was quickly buried in an unmarked grave while his widow Mariam and two children fled the nation. Compaoré immediately reversed the nationalizations, overturned nearly all of Sankara&#x27;s policies, rejoined the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to bring in &#x27;desperately needed&#x27; funds to restore the &#x27;shattered&#x27; economy and ultimately spurned most of Sankara&#x27;s legacy. Compaoré&#x27;s dictatorship remained in power for 27 years until it was overthrown by popular protests in 2014.

=== Trial ===
In 2017, the Burkina Faso government officially asked the French government to release military documents on the killing of Sankara after his widow accused France of masterminding his assassination.

In April 2021, 34 years after Sankara&#x27;s assassination, former president Compaoré and 13 others were indicted for complicity in the murder of Sankara as well as other crimes in the coup. This development came as part of President Roch Kaboré&#x27;s framework of &#x27;national reconciliation&#x27;.

In October 2021, the trial against Compaoré and 13 others began in Ouagadougou, with Compaoré being tried &quot;in absentia&quot;. Ex-presidential security chief Hyacinthe Kafondo, was also tried in absentia. A week before the trial, Compaoré&#x27;s lawyers stated that he wouldn&#x27;t be attending the trial which they characterized as having defects, and also emphasized his privilege for immunity, being the former head of state. After requests made by the defence attorneys for more time to prepare their defence, the hearing was postponed until 1 March.

On 6 April 2022, Compaoré and two others were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison in absentia. Eight others were sentenced to between 3 and 20 years in prison. Three were found innocent.

== Exhumation ==
The exhumation of what are believed to be the remains of Sankara started on African Liberation Day, 25 May 2015. Permission for an exhumation was denied during the rule of his successor, Blaise Compaoré. The exhumation would allow the family to formally identify the remains, a long-standing demand of his family and supporters.

In October 2015, one of the lawyers for Sankara&#x27;s widow Mariam reported that the autopsy revealed that Sankara&#x27;s body was &#x27;riddled&#x27; with &#x27;more than a dozen&#x27; bullets.

== Legacy ==

Accompanying his personal charisma, Sankara had an array of original initiatives that contributed to his popularity and brought some international media attention to his government.

=== Solidarity ===
* He sold off the government fleet of Mercedes cars and made the Renault 5 (the cheapest car sold in Burkina Faso at that time) the official service car of the ministers.
* He reduced the salaries of well-off public servants (including his own) and forbade the use of government chauffeurs and first class airline tickets.
* He opposed foreign aid, saying that &#x27;He who feeds you, controls you&#x27;.
* He spoke in forums like the Organization of African Unity against what he described as neocolonialist penetration of Africa through Western trade and finance.
* He called for a united front of African nations to repudiate their foreign debt. He argued that the poor and exploited did not have an obligation to repay money to the rich and exploiting.

* In Ouagadougou, Sankara converted the army&#x27;s provisioning store into a state-owned supermarket open to everyone (the first supermarket in the country).
* He forced well-off civil servants to pay one month&#x27;s salary to public projects.
* He refused to use the air conditioning in his office on the grounds that such luxury was not available to anyone but a handful of Burkinabés.
* As President, he lowered his salary to $450 a month and limited his possessions to a car, four bikes, three guitars, a refrigerator, and a broken freezer.

=== Style ===
* He required public servants to wear a traditional tunic, woven from Burkinabé cotton and sewn by Burkinabé craftsmen.
* He was known for jogging unaccompanied through Ouagadougou in his track suit and posing in his tailored military fatigues, with his mother-of-pearl pistol.
* When asked why he did not want his portrait hung in public places, as was the norm for other African leaders, Sankara replied: &quot;There are seven million Thomas Sankaras&quot;.
* An accomplished guitarist, he wrote the new national anthem himself.

=== Burkina Faso ===
A statue of Sankara was unveiled in 2019 at the location in Ouagadougou where he was assassinated; however due to complaints that it did not match his facial features, a new statue was unveiled a year later.

In 2023, the government of Burkina Faso formally proclaimed Sankara as a &quot;hero of the nation&quot;.

In October 2023, on the 36th anniversary of his assassination, the government changed a main road name in Ouagadougou to honor Sankara. The road in question was the Boulevard Charles de Gaulle, now known as Boulevard Capitaine Thomas Isidore Noël Sankara.

=== International recognition ===
Cuba awarded Sankara with the highest honour of the state, the Order of José Martí.

Twenty years after his assassination, Sankara was commemorated on 15 October 2007 in ceremonies that took place in Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal, Niger, Tanzania, Burundi, France, Canada and the United States.

==== Africa&#x27;s Che Guevara ====
Sankara is often referred to as &quot;Africa&#x27;s Che Guevara&quot;. Sankara gave a speech marking and honouring the 20th anniversary of Che Guevara&#x27;s 9 October 1967 execution, one week before his own assassination on 15 October 1987.

<text>James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, 1st Duke of Buccleuch, (9 April 1649 – 15 July 1685) was an English nobleman and military officer. Originally called James Crofts or James Fitzroy, he was born in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, the eldest illegitimate son of Charles II of England with his mistress Lucy Walter.

The Duke of Monmouth served in the Second Anglo-Dutch War and commanded English troops taking part in the Third Anglo-Dutch War before commanding the Anglo-Dutch brigade fighting in the Franco-Dutch War. He led the unsuccessful Monmouth Rebellion in 1685, an attempt to depose his uncle King James II and VII. After one of his officers declared Monmouth the legitimate king in the town of Taunton in Somerset, Monmouth attempted to capitalise on his Protestantism and his position as the son of Charles II, in opposition to James, who had become a Roman Catholic. The rebellion failed, and Monmouth was beheaded for treason on 15 July 1685.

==Biography==

===Parentage and early life===

Charles, Prince of Wales (later becoming King Charles II), moved to The Hague in 1648, during the Second English Civil War, where his sister Mary and his brother-in-law William II, Prince of Orange, were based. The French relatives of Charles&#x27; mother, Queen Henrietta Maria, had invited Charles to wait out the war in France with the Queen, but he opted for the Netherlands, as he believed there was more support to be gained for the cause of his father, King Charles I, in the Netherlands than in France. During the summer of 1648, the Prince of Wales became captivated by Lucy Walter, who was in The Hague for a short visit. The lovers were only eighteen, and she is often spoken of as his first mistress, though he may have begun having affairs as early as 1646. Their son James was born in Rotterdam in the Netherlands on 9 April 1649, and spent his early years in Schiedam.

Research by Hugh Noel Williams suggests that Charles had not arrived in The Hague until the middle of September 1648 – seven months before the child&#x27;s birth, and that he had only met Lucy in July. It was later rumoured that in the summer of 1648 Lucy had been the mistress of Colonel Robert Sidney, a younger son of the Earl of Leicester. As Charles had no legitimate surviving children, his younger brother James, Duke of York, was next in line to the throne. When the boy grew up, those loyal to the Duke of York spread rumours about the young James&#x27; resemblance to Sidney. These voices may have been encouraged by the Duke of York himself, who wished to prevent any of the fourteen royal bastards his brother acknowledged from gaining support in the succession. In 2012, a DNA test of Monmouth&#x27;s patrilineal descendant the 10th Duke of Buccleuch showed that he shared the same Y chromosome as a distant Stuart cousin; this is evidence that Charles II was indeed Monmouth&#x27;s father.

James had a younger sister or half-sister, Mary Crofts, whose father may have been Lord Taaffe. Mary later married the Irishman William Sarsfield, thus becoming the sister-in-law of the Jacobite general Patrick Sarsfield.

As an illegitimate son, James was ineligible to succeed to the English or Scottish thrones, unless he could prove rumours that his parents had married secretly. He came to maintain that his parents were married and that he possessed evidence of their marriage, but he never produced it. King Charles II testified in writing to his Privy Council that he had never been married to anyone except his queen consort, Catherine of Braganza.

In March 1658, young James was kidnapped by one of the King&#x27;s men, sent to Paris, and placed in the care of William Crofts, 1st Baron Crofts, whose surname he took. He briefly attended a school in Familly.

===Officer and commander===
On 14 February 1663, almost 14 years old, shortly after having been brought to England, James was created Duke of Monmouth, with the subsidiary titles of Earl of Doncaster and Baron Scott of Tynedale, all three in the Peerage of England, and, on 28 March 1663, he was appointed a Knight of the Garter.

On 20 April 1663, just days after his 14th birthday, the Duke of Monmouth was married to the heiress Anne Scott, 4th Countess of Buccleuch. He took his wife&#x27;s surname upon marriage. The day after his marriage, the couple were made Duke and Duchess of Buccleuch, Earl and Countess of Dalkeith, and Lord and Lady Scott of Whitchester and Eskdale in the Peerage of Scotland. The Duke of Monmouth was popular, particularly for his Protestantism. The King&#x27;s official heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, had openly converted to Roman Catholicism.

In 1665, at the age of 16, Monmouth served in the English fleet under his uncle, the Duke of York, in the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In June 1666, he returned to England to become captain of a troop of cavalry. On 16 September 1668 he was made colonel of the His Majesty&#x27;s Own Troop of Horse Guards. He acquired Moor Park in Hertfordshire in April 1670. Following the death in 1670, without a male heir, of Josceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland, the earl&#x27;s estates reverted to the Crown. King Charles II awarded the estates to Monmouth. The Countess of Northumberland successfully sued for the estates to be returned to the late Earl&#x27;s only daughter and sole heiress, Lady Elizabeth Percy (1667–1722). 

At the outbreak of the Third Anglo-Dutch War in 1672, a brigade of 6,000 English and Scottish troops was sent to serve as part of the French army (in return for money paid to King Charles), with Monmouth as its commander. He became Lord Lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire and Governor of Kingston-upon-Hull in April 1673. In the campaign of 1673 and in particular at the Siege of Maastricht that June, Monmouth gained a considerable reputation as one of Britain&#x27;s finest soldiers. He was reported to be replacing Marshal Schomberg as commander of England&#x27;s Zealand Expedition, but this did not happen.

In 1674, Monmouth became Chancellor of Cambridge University and Master of the Horse, and King Charles II directed that all military orders should be brought first to Monmouth for examination, thus giving him effective command of the forces; his responsibilities included the movement of troops and the suppression of riots. In March 1677, he also became Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire.

===Claim to the Crown===

In 1678, Monmouth was the commander of the Anglo-Dutch brigade, now fighting for the United Provinces against the French, and he distinguished himself at the Battle of Saint-Denis in August that year during the Franco-Dutch War, further increasing his reputation. The following year, after his return to Britain, he commanded the small army raised to put down the rebellion of the Scottish Covenanters and despite being heavily outnumbered, he decisively defeated the (admittedly poorly equipped) Covenanter rebels at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge on 22 June 1679.

===Rebellion===
As his popularity with the masses increased, Monmouth was obliged to go into exile in the Dutch United Provinces in September 1679. Following the discovery of the so-called Rye House Plot in 1683, which aimed to assassinate both Charles II and his brother James, Monmouth, who had been encouraged by his supporters to assert his right to the throne, was identified as a conspirator. On King Charles II&#x27;s death in February 1685, Monmouth led the Monmouth Rebellion, landing with three ships at Lyme Regis in Dorset in early June 1685, in an attempt to take the throne from his uncle, James II and VII. He published a &quot;Declaration for the defence and vindication of the protestant religion and of the laws, rights and privileges of England from the invasion made upon them, and for delivering the Kingdom from the usurpation and tyranny of us by the name of James, Duke of York&quot;: King James II and VII responded to this by issuing an order for the publishers and distributors of the paper to be arrested.

Monmouth declared himself as the rightful King at various places along the route including Axminster, Chard, Ilminster and Taunton. The two armies met at the Battle of Sedgemoor on 6 July 1685, the last clear-cut pitched battle on open ground between two military forces fought on English soil: Monmouth&#x27;s makeshift force could not compete with the regular army, and was soundly defeated.

===Capture===
Following the battle a reward of £5,000 was offered for his capture. On 8 July 1685, Monmouth was captured and arrested near Ringwood in Hampshire, by tradition &quot;in a field of peas&quot;. The events surrounding his capture are described by George Roberts in &quot;Tait&#x27;s Edinburgh Magazine&quot;.

When the Duke had left his horse at Woodyates Inn, he exchanged clothes with a shepherd, who was soon discovered by local loyalists and interrogated. Dogs were then put onto the Duke&#x27;s scent. Monmouth dropped his gold snuff box, full of gold pieces, in a pea field, where it was afterwards found.
From Woodyates Inn the Duke had gone to Shag&#x27;s Heath, in the middle of which was a cluster of small farms, called the &quot;Island&quot;. Amy Farrant gave information that the fugitives were concealed within the Island. The Duke, accompanied by Busse and Brandenburgher, remained concealed all day, with soldiers surrounding the area and threatening to set fire to the woodland. Brandenburgher deserted him at 1 am, and was later captured and interrogated, and is believed to have given away the Duke&#x27;s hiding place. The spot was at the north-eastern extremity of the Island, now known as Monmouth&#x27;s Close, in the manor of Woodlands, the property of the Earl of Shaftesbury. At about 7 am Henry Parkin, a militia soldier and servant of Samuel Rolle, discovered the brown skirt of Monmouth&#x27;s coat as he lay hidden in a ditch covered with fern and brambles under an ash tree, and called for help. The Duke was seized. Bystanders shouted out &quot;Shoot him! shoot him!&quot;, but Sir William Portman happening to be near the spot, immediately rode up, and laid hands on him as his prisoner. Monmouth was then &quot;in the last extremity of hunger and fatigue, with no sustenance but a few raw peas in his pocket. He could not stand, and his appearance was much changed. Since landing in England, the Duke had not had a good night&#x27;s rest, or eaten one meal in quiet, being perpetually agitated with the cares that attend unfortunate ambition&quot;. He had &quot;received no other sustenance than the brook and the field afforded&quot;.

The Duke was taken to Holt Lodge, in the parish of Wimborne, about away, the residence of Anthony Etterick, a magistrate who asked the Duke what he would do if released, to which he answered: &quot;that if his horse and arms were but restored to him at the same time, he needed only to ride through the army; and he defied them to take him again&quot;. The magistrate ordered him taken to London.

===Attainder and execution===
Following Monmouth&#x27;s capture, Parliament passed an Act of Attainder, 1 Ja. 2. c. 2:

The King took the unusual step of allowing his nephew an audience, despite having no intention of extending a pardon to him, thus breaking with a longstanding tradition that the King would give an audience only when he intended to show clemency. The prisoner unsuccessfully implored his mercy and even offered to convert to Catholicism, but to no avail. The King, disgusted by his abject behaviour, coldly told him to prepare to die, and later remarked that Monmouth &quot;did not behave as well as I expected&quot;. Numerous pleas for mercy were addressed to the King, but he ignored them all, even that of his sister-in-law, the Dowager Queen Catherine.

Monmouth was beheaded by Jack Ketch on 15 July 1685, on Tower Hill. Shortly beforehand, Bishops Turner of Ely and Ken of Bath and Wells visited the Duke to prepare him for eternity, but withheld the Eucharist, for the condemned man refused to acknowledge that either his rebellion or his relationship with Lady Wentworth had been sinful. It is said that before laying his head on the block, Monmouth specifically bade Ketch finish him at one blow, saying he had mauled others before. Disconcerted, Ketch did indeed inflict multiple blows with his axe, the prisoner rising up reproachfully the while – a ghastly sight that shocked the witnesses, drawing forth execrations and groans. Some say a knife was at last employed to sever the head from the twitching body. Sources vary; some claim eight blows, the official Tower of London fact sheet says it took five blows, while Charles Spencer, in his book &quot;Blenheim&quot;, puts it at seven.

Monmouth was buried in the Church of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower of London. His Dukedom was forfeited, but his subsidiary titles, Earl of Doncaster and Baron Scott of Tindale, were restored by King George II on 23 March 1743 to his grandson Francis Scott, 2nd Duke of Buccleuch (1695–1751).

===Popular legends===
According to legend, a portrait was painted of Monmouth after his execution: the tradition states that it was realised after the execution that there was no official portrait of the Duke, so his body was exhumed, the head stitched back on, and it was sat for its portrait to be painted. However, there are at least two formal portraits of Monmouth tentatively dated to before his death currently in the National Portrait Gallery in London, and another painting once identified with Monmouth that shows a sleeping or dead man that could have given rise to the story.

One of the many theories about the identity of the Man in the Iron Mask is that he was Monmouth: the theory is that someone else was executed in his place, and James II arranged for Monmouth to be taken to France and put in the custody of his cousin Louis XIV of France.

Henry Purcell set to music (Z. 481) a satirical poem by an unidentified author, ridiculing Monmouth and his parentage:

== Arms ==
James Scott&#x27;s first coat of arms was initially granted in 1663 at the same time he was created Duke of Monmouth:
Quarterly, 1st and 4th, &quot;Ermine, on a Pile gules three Lions passant guardant or;&quot; 2nd and 3rd: &quot;Or, within a double Tressure flory counterflory gules, on an Inescutcheon azure, three Fleurs-de-Lys gold.&quot;
Crest: &quot;Upon a Chapeau gules turned up ermine, a Dragon passant or gorged with a Crown having a Chain gules.&quot;
Supporters: Dexter, &quot;a Unicorn argent, armed, maned and unguled or, gorged with a Crown having a Chain gules affixed thereto:&quot; Sinister,&quot; a Hart argent, attired and unguled or, gorged with a Crown having a Chain gules affixed thereto.&quot;

This version of the arms, which consisted in a creative reorganisation of the Royal Arms, drew numerous complaints as it did not include any marker to signify his illegitimacy, and rumours that Charles might attempt to legitimise James started to spread.

Four years later, after James&#x27; marriage, and with Charles&#x27; growing realisation that he would not legitimise him, a new design was granted: &quot;the Arms of King Charles II debruised by a baton sinister Argent;&quot; An inescutcheon of Scott was added on top:&quot; Or, on a Bend azure a Mullet of six points between two Crescents of the field.&quot; To show the importance of James&#x27; marriage to Anne Scott, which he had married shortly after receiving his original arms. The Crest and Supporters from his previous arms were kept.

==Children==
His marriage to Anne Scott, 1st Duchess of Buccleuch resulted in the birth of six children:
* Charles Scott, Earl of Doncaster (24 August 1672 – 9 February 1673/1674)
* James Scott, Earl of Dalkeith (23 May 1674 – 14 March 1705). He was married on 2 January 1693/1694 to Henrietta Hyde, daughter of Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester. They were parents to Francis Scott, 2nd Duke of Buccleuch.
* Lady Anne Scott (17 February 1675 – 13 August 1685)
* Henry Scott, 1st Earl of Deloraine (1676 – 25 December 1730)
* Francis Scott (died an infant; buried 8 December 1679)
* Lady Charlotte Scott (died an infant; buried 5 September 1683)

His affair with his mistress Eleanor Needham, daughter of Sir Robert Needham of Lambeth resulted in the birth of three children:
* James Crofts (died March 1732), major-general in the Army.
* Henrietta Crofts ( – 27 February 1730). She was married around 1697 to Charles Paulet, 2nd Duke of Bolton.
* Isabel Crofts (died young)

Toward the end of his life he conducted an affair with Henrietta, Baroness Wentworth.

<text>Jan Karol Chodkiewicz (; 1561 – 24 September 1621) was a Polish–Lithuanian military commander of the Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army, who was from 1601 Field Hetman of Lithuania, and from 1605 Grand Hetman of Lithuania. He was one of the most prominent noblemen and military commanders of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth of his era. His coat of arms was Chodkiewicz, as was his family name.

He played a major role, often as the top commander of the military of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, in the Wallachian campaign of 1599–1601, the Polish–Swedish War of 1600–11, the Polish–Muscovite War of 1605–18, and the Polish–Ottoman War of 1620–1621. His most famous victory was the Battle of Kircholm in 1605, in which he dealt a major defeat to a Swedish army three times the size of his own. He died on the front lines during the battle of Khotyn, in the besieged Khotyn Fortress, a few days before the Ottomans gave up on the siege and agreed to negotiate.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Chodkiewicz was born around 1561 (exact date of his birth is unknown) as the son of Jan Hieronimowicz Chodkiewicz, Grand Marshal of Lithuania, castellan of Vilnius and Krystyna Zborowska, daughter of a Polish magnate family of Zborowski. From 1573 he was a student at the Vilnius Jesuit College and the Vilnius University, and from 1586 to 1589, together with his brother Aleksander, he continued his studies abroad at the University of Ingolstadt. He visited Padua before returning to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1590.

He started his military career soon after returning to the Commonwealth, raising a rota of 50 to 100 men. He gained military experience in the fight against the rebellious Cossacks during the Severyn Nalyvaiko&#x27;s uprising under Field Crown Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski. During that conflict he participated in the battle of Kaniów on 14 April 1596, and in the siege of the Cossack tabor near Lubny. In 1599, he was appointed the Elder (starost) of Samogitia.

Chodkiewicz subsequently assisted Chancellor and Great Crown Hetman Jan Zamoyski in his victorious Wallachian campaign, in which Chodkiewicz participated in the battle of Ploiești on 15 October 1600. For that campaign, he was given that year the high office of the Field Lithuanian Hetman, the second commander-in-chief of the Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army.

===War in the North===

A year later, in 1601, Chodkiewicz accompanied Zamoyski north, to the Duchy of Livonia (Inflanty), where he commanded Lithuanian units on the right wing of the Commonwealth army in a victorious battle of Kokenhausen in late July that year in the war against Sweden. He oversaw the fighting in the Livonia theater after Zamoyski&#x27;s return to Poland in 1602. In April 1603, he captured Dorpat (modern Tartu) and defeated the Swedish forces at the Battle of Weissenstein on 23 September 1604. His crowning achievement was the great victory near the Daugava in the Battle of Kircholm (modern Salaspils) on 27 September 1605, when, with barely 4,000 troops, mostly the Winged hussar heavy cavalry, he annihilated a Swedish army three times the size of his force. For that feat he received letters of congratulation from Pope Paul V, most of Catholic royalty, and even the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and the Shah of Persia. Soon afterward, he was rewarded with the rank of Lithuanian Grand Hetman, in addition to a number of royal land grants and leases.

Yet this great victory was virtually fruitless, owing to the domestic dissensions; the Sejm (Commonwealth parliament) failed to agree on raising the funds needed for the war effort. Chodkiewicz was one of the magnates who remained loyal to king Sigismund III Vasa, and helped him to defeat the Zebrzydowski rebellion in 1606–1607. He commanded the Crown Army&#x27;s right wing during the Battle of Guzów on 6–7 July 1607, in which the insurgents were defeated, and then quelled the unrest in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, fighting against another rebellious magnate, Janusz Radziwiłł, until Radziwiłł negotiated a settlement with the king in 1608. A fresh invasion of Livonia by the Swedes recalled him thither once more, and in 1609 he relieved Riga and recaptured Pernau. He improvised a small fleet and dealt a surprise blow to the Swedish Navy at the Battle of Salis.

===Wars in the East and South===

Meanwhile, the Dimitriad wars with Muscovy broke out. Instigated by King Sigismund III, the war was unpopular among Lithuanian magnates, and Chodkiewicz was no exception; in fact his displeasure was so public and significant that he lost the royal favor for a time. Eventually their differences subsided, and Chodkiewicz was sent against the Muscovites, operating first near Smolensk and Pskov. Soon, the Polish–Lithuanian forces started garnering victories, such as the capture of Smolensk, and some, like Grand Crown Hetman Żółkiewski, planned for a grand Polish–Lithuanian–Muscovite Commonwealth. Chodkiewicz was tasked by the king with an advance on Moscow. However, the Sejm neglected to pay for the maintenance of the armies once more, resulting in the mutiny of some units. Chodkiewicz fought several inconclusive battles against the Muscovites in autumn 1611 and then, after the Battle of Moscow (1612), retreated. Disappointed with the outcome, he became once again estranged from the king, and criticized the campaign at the Sejm of 1613. Over the next few years, in the period of 1613–15, Chodkiewicz defended the Commonwealth gains in the Smolensk area, and dealt with unrest in Lithuania. Not till the crown prince, Władysław arrived with tardy reinforcements did the war could assume a more offensive character once again. The army, nominally commanded by Władysław, but in practice under Chodkiewicz&#x27;s experienced command, took the Dorogobuzh fortress on 11 October 1617. The siege of Mozhaysk in December of subsequent year proved unsuccessful, and this marked the end of the conflict.

The Polish-Muscovite War had no sooner been ended by the Truce of Deulino than Chodkiewicz was hastily dispatched southwards to defend the southern frontier against the Turks, who, in the opening phase of the Polish–Ottoman War, defeated Polish forces at Cecora, killing Hetman Żółkiewski. An army of 160,000 Turks and 60,000 Tatars led by Sultan Osman II in person advanced on the Polish frontier. Opposed it were the Commonwealth forces, numbering about 70,000, half of them a Cossack detachment under Cossack hetman Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny. Chodkiewicz crossed the Dnieper in September 1621, and entrenched himself in the Khotyn Fortress, directly in the path of the Ottoman advance. During the Battle of Khotyn Chodkiewicz resisted the sultan&#x27;s 200-thousand army for a whole month. but the victory cost his life. A few days before the siege was raised and the Ottomans decided to open negotiations, the aged Grand Lithuanian Hetman, already suffering from illness since the campaign&#x27;s opening, died in the fortress on 24 September 1621.

Chodkiewicz&#x27;s body was transported to Kamianets-Podilskyi, where he was buried on 14 October 1621. A few years later, in the summer of 1622, his widow arranged for exhumation, and Chodkiewicz was reburied in Ostroh in June that year. In 1627 he was moved to a new chapel in Ostroh, where he reburied again. His body was evacuated from Ostroh during the Khmelnytsky Uprising in 1648, and returned there in 1654. It was reburied yet again in a new tomb in Ostroh in 1722.

==Assessment and remembrance==

In 1937, Polish historian Wanda Dobrowolska, wrote in her Polish Biographical Dictionary entry on Chodkiewicz that he was one of the chief members of the &quot;Great Hetman era&quot;, renowned for his talent as a strategist and organizer. She notes that Chodkiewicz possessed an iron will, which he was able to impose on the troops under his command, and that he was an efficient commander, although more respected and feared than beloved by his troops. Dobrowolska notes that he was an energetic and explosive antithesis of the composed Żółkiewski, another great hetman of this era, whom Chodkiewicz disliked and competed with throughout his life.

Chodkiewicz was not particularly involved in the Commonwealth&#x27;s politics, although his high office and wealth gave him significant influence; for the most part he used his political influence, and base of support in Lithuania, to gather support for his military plans, increase the armies&#x27; sizes, and personal gratifications. His life was dominated by warfare, if not on the front lines, then on the political scene against other Lithuanian magnates, particularly the Radziwiłł family and the Sejm politicians whom he held responsible for not passing enough taxes to support the armies he wanted.

Over his career he acquired significant wealth, and funded a number of churches and other prestigious buildings. He often worked with the Jesuits, including funding their College in Kražiai. He strongly believed his service should be rewarded with land grants, but he would simultaneously often use his own money to pay for military expenses. In his private life he is remembered as a very proud individual, and for stressing his identity as a member of the Lithuanian nobility. He was a family man, devoted to his family, but his only son, from his marriage in 1593 to Zofia Mielecka, died aged 16 in 1613, and she died in 1618. He remarried in 1620, wedding Anna Alojza Ostrogska in November 1620, shortly before departing on his final campaign. Also that year his daughter Anna married a Lithuanian magnate, Jan Stanisław Sapieha.

Some poems and other works praising him were written during his lifetime, and a religious work was dedicated to him by the Jesuit Piotr Skarga. More works on Chodkiewicz were written in the years after his death. He was one of Wacław Potocki&#x27;s characters in his epic novel on the Khotyn war (), and he also appeared in the works of Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and Zofia Kossak-Szczucka, usually portrayed as a patriot and military genius.

In 2021, commemorating the 400th anniversary of his death, a number of ceremonies were held in Lithuania. Firstly, a monument of Jan Karol Chodkiewicz was unveiled in a yard of the Chodkevičiai Palace in Vilnius. Also, a new Lithuanian award Jonas Karolis Chodkevičius Gold Medal for State Strengthening Activities was established, with its first laureate being Jonas Ohmanas. While commemorating the same anniversary in Kretinga, which was established by Jan Karol Chodkiewicz in 1602, a cenotaph was placed in Chodkiewicz family crypt of the Church of the Annunciation to the Blessed Virgin Mary as in his testament he demanded to be buried in Kretinga&#x27;s church crypt, alongside his first wife and his sons, however his remains fate is unknown as his second wife buried him in Ukraine, but the church with his remains was demolished in the 19th century. Also, Lithuanian Armed Forces Motorized Infantry Brigade Žemaitija was renamed to Lithuanian Grand Hetman Jonas Karolis Chodkevičius Infantry Brigade Žemaitija.

<text>Easy listening (including mood music) is a popular music genre and radio format that was most popular during the 1950s to the 1970s. It is related to middle of the road (MOR) music and encompasses instrumental recordings of standards, hit songs, non-rock vocals and instrumental covers of selected popular rock songs. It mostly concentrates on music that pre-dates the rock and roll era, characteristically on music from the 1940s and 1950s. It was differentiated from the mostly instrumental beautiful music format by its variety of styles, including a percentage of vocals, arrangements and tempos to fit various parts of the broadcast day.

Easy listening music is often confused with lounge music, but while it was popular in some of the same venues it was meant to be listened to for enjoyment rather than as background sound.

==History==

The style has been synonymous with the tag &quot;with strings&quot;. String instruments had been used in sweet bands in the 1930s and was the dominant soundtrack to movies of Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age. In the 1940s and 1950s strings had been used in jazz and popular music contexts. As examples in the jazz genre, there are recordings of Frank Sinatra. Another example of a practitioner in the popular context was Dinah Washington&#x27;s &quot;What a Difference a Day Makes&quot;. In the 1950s the use of strings quickly became a main feature of the developing easy listening genre.

Jackie Gleason, a master at this genre, whose first ten albums went gold, expressed the goal of producing &quot;musical wallpaper that should never be intrusive, but conducive&quot;.

Similarly, in 1956 John Serry Sr. sought to utilize the accordion within the context of a jazz sextet in order to create a soothing mood ideally suited for &quot;low pressure&quot; listening on his album &quot;Squeeze Play&quot;. Jerry Murad also contributed to the music, including a variety of types of harmonica.

==Reception==
The magazines &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Record World&quot; featured easy listening singles in independently audited record charts. Generally 40 positions in length, they charted airplay on stations such as WNEW-FM, New York City, WWEZ, Cincinnati, and KMPC, Los Angeles. &quot;Record World&quot; began their listings January 29, 1967, and ended these charts in the early 1970s. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Easy Listening chart morphed into the Adult Contemporary chart in 1979, and continues to this day.

During the format&#x27;s heyday in the 1960s, it was not at all uncommon for easy listening instrumental singles to reach the top of the charts on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (and stay there for several weeks).

Beautiful music, which grew up alongside easy listening music, had rigid standards for instrumentation, e.g., few or no saxophones (at the time, the saxophone was associated with less refined styles such as jazz and rock and roll, although Billy Vaughn was an exception to the rule), and restrictions on how many vocal pieces could be played in an hour. The easy listening radio format has been generally, but not completely, superseded by the soft adult contemporary format.

According to the &quot;Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World&quot;, &quot;The public prominence and profitability of easy listening [in the postwar years] led to its close association with the so-called &#x27;Establishment&#x27; that would eventually be demonized by the rock counterculture.&quot; In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), rock critic Robert Christgau said &quot;semiclassical music is a systematic dilution of highbrow preferences&quot;.

==Easy listening singers==
Easy listening/lounge singers have a lengthy history stretching back to the decades of the early twentieth century. Easy listening music featured popular vocalists such as Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Dean Martin, Patti Page, Tony Bennett, Nat King Cole, Rosemary Clooney, Doris Day, Perry Como, Engelbert Humperdinck, The Carpenters, The Mills Brothers, The Ink Spots, Julie London, and many others. The somewhat derisive term lounge lizard was coined then, and less well-known lounge singers have often been ridiculed as dinosaurs of past eras and parodied for their smarmy delivery of standards.

In the early 1990s the lounge revival was in full swing and included such groups as Combustible Edison, Love Jones, The Cocktails, Pink Martini and Nightcaps. Alternative band Stereolab demonstrated the influence of lounge with releases such as &quot;Space Age Bachelor Pad Music&quot; and the Ultra-Lounge series of lounge music albums. The lounge style was a direct contradiction to the grunge music that dominated the period.

<doc id="165564" wikidata="Q568497" url="?curid=165564" title="Pierre Daniel Huet">
<text>Pierre Daniel Huet (; ; 8 February 1630 – 26 January 1721) was a French churchman and scholar, editor of the Delphin Classics, founder of the Académie de Physique in Caen (1662–1672) and Bishop of Soissons from 1685 to 1689 and afterwards of Avranches.

==Life==

He was born in Caen in 1630, and educated at the Jesuit school there. He also received lessons from a Protestant pastor, Samuel Bochart. By the age of twenty he was recognized as one of the most promising scholars of his time. In 1651 he went to Paris, where he formed a friendship with Gabriel Naudé, conservator of the Mazarin Library. In the following year Samuel Bochart, being invited by Queen Christina of Sweden to her court at Stockholm, took his friend Huet with him. This journey, in which he saw Leiden, Amsterdam and Copenhagen, as well as Stockholm, resulted chiefly in the discovery, in the Swedish royal library, of some fragments of Origen&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on St Matthew&quot;, which gave Huet the idea of editing and translating Origen into Latin, a task he completed in 1668. He eventually quarrelled with Bochart, who accused him of having suppressed a line in Origen in the Eucharistic controversy. While working on Origen&#x27;s Greek text, Huet wrote a separate treatise on translation history, theory, and practice, the &quot;De optimo genere interpretandi&quot; (&quot;On the best kind of translating&quot;) in two books (first published 1660; 3rd and last ed. Amsterdam, 1683).

Huet was also the cofounder of the Académie de Physique in Caen, the first provincial academy of science to be granted a royal charter (1668). Huet was the initial patron of the academy, and along with Andre Graindorge, directed the work of the group, which focused on the empirical study of nature, with a special emphasis on anatomy and dissections. Huet&#x27;s presence was critical to the success of the academy, which floundered without his continued presence. He acted as head of the group from 1662 to 1667, and again in 1668, when he left Caen again for Paris. He also ended his financial support of the academy at this time, as it began to receive royal funding and direction from the royal representative in Normandy, Guy Chamillart.

In Paris he entered into close relations with Jean Chapelain. During the famous &quot;dispute of Ancients and Moderns&quot;, Huet took the side of the Ancients against Charles Perrault and Jean Desmarets. Among his friends at this period were Valentin Conrart and Paul Pellisson. His taste for mathematics led him to the study of astronomy. He next turned his attention to anatomy, and, being short-sighted, devoted his inquiries mainly to the question of vision and the formation of the eye. In the course of this study, he made more than 800 dissections. He then learned all that was then to be learned in chemistry, and wrote a Latin poem on salt.

All this time he was a frequent visitor to the salons of Mlle de Scudéry and the studios of painters; his scientific researches did not interfere with his classical studies, for during this time he was discussing with Bochart the origin of certain medals, and was learning Syriac and Arabic under the Jesuit Adrien Parvilliers.

Huet was admitted to the Académie française in 1674. He took holy orders in 1676, and two years later the king made him abbot of Aunay. In 1685 he became Bishop of Soissons, but after waiting for installation for four years he took the bishopric of Avranches instead. He exchanged the cares of his bishopric for what he thought would be the easier chair of the Abbey of Fontenay, but there he was vexed with continual lawsuits. At length he retired to the Jesuits&#x27; House in the Rue Saint-Antoine at Paris, where he died in 1721. His great library and manuscripts, after being bequeathed to the Jesuits, were bought by the king for the royal library.

==Works==

He translated the pastorals of Longus, wrote a tale called &quot;Diane de Castro&quot;, and gave with his &quot;Traitté de l&#x27;origine des romans&quot; (1670), his &quot;Treatise on the Origin of Romances&quot; the first world history of fiction. On being appointed assistant tutor to the Dauphin in 1670, he edited, with the assistance of Anne Lefêvre (afterwards Madame Dacier) and Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet, the well-known book series, the &quot;Delphin Classics&quot; (referred to in the original Latin as the &quot;Ad usum Delphini&quot; series). This series published comprehensive editions of the Latin classics in about sixty volumes, and each work was accompanied by a Latin commentary, &quot;ordo verborum&quot;, and verbal index. The original volumes have each an engraving of Arion and a dolphin, and the appropriate inscription &quot;in usum serenissimi Delphini&quot;.

In addition to Huet&#x27;s edition and translation of the ancient Greek theologian Origen, Huet published two works on the history and process of translation itself, &quot;De optimo genere interpretandi&quot; (&quot;On the best kind of translating&quot;) and &quot;De claris interpretibus&quot; (&quot;On famous translators&quot;; 3rd and last ed. 1683).

He issued one of his major works, the &quot;Demonstratio evangelica&quot;, in 1679. At Aulnay he wrote his &quot;Questiones Aletuanae&quot; (Caen, 1690), his &quot;Censura philosophiae Cartesianae&quot; (Paris, 1689), his &quot;Nouveau mémoire pour servir à l&#x27;histoire du Cartésianisme&quot; (&quot;New Memoirs to Serve The History of Cartesianism&quot;, 1692), and his discussion with Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux on the Sublime.

A. E. Housman described Huet as &quot;a critic of uncommon exactness, sobriety, and malevolence&quot;. In the &quot;Huetiana&quot; (1722) of Pierre-Joseph Thoulier d&#x27;Olivet will be found material for arriving at an idea of his prodigious labours, exact memory and wide scholarship. Another posthumous work was his &quot;Traité philosophique de la faiblesse de l&#x27;esprit humain&quot; (original spelling: &quot;Traité philosophique de la foiblesse de l’esprit humain&quot;) (Amsterdam, 1723), which he considered to be his best work. His autobiography, found in his &quot;Commentarius de rebus ad eum pertinentibus&quot; (Paris, 1718), has been translated into French and into English.

According to , Huet &quot;was after Ménage the best etymologist of his time&quot;. For example, it was he who understood that the final &quot;bec&quot; of certain toponyms of French Normandy (as Houlbec) means &quot;stream&quot; and is related to the German word of the same meaning &quot;Bach&quot;, also present at the end of many toponyms.

==Legacy==
The lycée in Hérouville-Saint-Clair, Calvados, was formerly named after Huet, though it has now ceased to be so.

<text>Jean Desmarets, Sieur de Saint-Sorlin (; 1595 – 28 October 1676) was a French writer and dramatist. He was a founding member, and the first to occupy seat 4 of the Académie française in 1634.

==Biography==
Born in Paris, Desmarets was introduced to Cardinal Richelieu, and became one of the band of writers who carried out the cardinal&#x27;s literary ideas when he was about thirty years old. His inclination, however, was to writing novels, and the success of his romance &quot;L&#x27;Ariane&quot; in 1632 led to his formal admission to a circle of writers that met at the house of Valentin Conrart. When this circle later developed into the Académie française, Desmarets became its first chancellor. He was related to Marie Dupré.

His success led to official preferment, and he was made &quot;conseiller du roi&quot;, &quot;contrôleur-général de l&#x27;extraordinaire des guerres&quot;, and secretary-general of the fleet of the Levant.

==Works==
It was at Richelieu&#x27;s request that he began to write for the theatre. In this genre he produced a comedy long regarded as a masterpiece, &quot;Les Visionnaires&quot; (1637), where, slightly disguised, real personages such as Madeleine de Sablé, la marquise de Rambouillet et Madame de Chavigny are staged; a prose-tragedy, &quot;Erigone&quot; (1638); and &quot;Scipion&quot; (1639), a tragedy in verse.

His long epic &quot;Clovis&quot; (1657) is noteworthy because Desmarets rejected the traditional pagan background, and maintained that Christian imagery should supplant it. With this standpoint he contributed several works in defence of the moderns in the famous quarrel between the Ancients and Moderns.

In his later years Desmarets devoted himself chiefly to producing a number of religious poems, of which the best known is perhaps his verse translation of the &quot;Office de la Vierge&quot; (1645). He was an outspoken opponent of the Jansenists, against whom he wrote a &quot;Réponse à l&#x27;insolente apologie de Port-Royal&quot; (1666). He died in Paris on 28 October 1676.

<doc id="165567" wikidata="Q180224" url="?curid=165567" title="Lenny Kravitz">
<text>Leonard Albert Kravitz (born May 26, 1964) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, and actor. Kravitz released his debut album &quot;Let Love Rule&quot; in 1989. This marked the beginning of a music career characterized by a blend of rock, funk, reggae, hard rock, soul, and R&amp;B.

Kravitz has had hit singles, including &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Over &#x27;til It&#x27;s Over&quot; (1991) and &quot;Again&quot; (2000), each of which reached the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 chart; other hits include &quot;Let Love Rule&quot; (1989), &quot;Always on the Run&quot; (1991), &quot;Are You Gonna Go My Way&quot; (1993), &quot;Fly Away&quot; (1998), and &quot;American Woman&quot; (1999), each of which reached the top 10 on the Alternative Airplay chart. Kravitz has won several awards, including the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, which he received four years in a row from 1999 to 2002, breaking the record for most wins in that category, and setting the record for most consecutive wins in one category by a male performer. Kravitz has sold over 40 million albums worldwide and was ranked 93 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;.

Aside from his music career, Kravitz has acted in films including &quot;Precious&quot; (2009) and the first two installments of &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; film series (2012–13). In addition, he also founded the creative studio Kravitz Design Inc. Kravitz was previously married to Lisa Bonet, with whom he has a daughter, Zoë Kravitz.

==Early life==

Kravitz was born on May 26, 1964, in New York City, the only child of NBC television news producer Sy Kravitz (1924–2005) and actress Roxie Roker (1929–1995). His mother came from a Christian family that was of African-American and Bahamian descent. His grandfather was Russian-Jewish. Through his mother, Kravitz is a second cousin of television weather presenter Al Roker, as their grandfathers were brothers. Kravitz was named after his uncle, Leonard M. Kravitz, a private first class who was killed in action in the Korean War at the age of 20, while single-handedly holding off a Chinese attack, enabling most of his platoon to escape.

During his early years, Kravitz did not grow up in a religious environment. After a spiritual experience when he was 13, he started attending church and later became a non-denominational Christian. Kravitz grew up spending weekdays on the Upper East Side of Manhattan with his parents, attending P.S. 6 for elementary school, and spending weekends at his grandmother Bessie&#x27;s house in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn.

Kravitz began banging on pots and pans in the kitchen, playing them as drums at the age of three. He decided that he wanted to be a musician at the age of five. He began playing the drums and soon added guitar. He grew up listening to the music his parents listened to: R&amp;B, jazz, classical, opera, gospel, and blues. He said, &quot;My parents were very supportive of the fact that I loved music early on, and they took me to a lot of shows.&quot; Around the age of seven, he saw the Jackson 5 perform at Madison Square Garden, and they became his favorite performers. His father, who was also a jazz promoter, was friends with Duke Ellington, Sarah Vaughan, Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Bobby Short, Miles Davis, and other jazz greats; Ellington even played &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; for him on his fifth birthday.

In 1974, at the age of 10, Kravitz relocated to Los Angeles with his parents when his mother landed her role on &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;. At his mother&#x27;s urging, he joined the California Boys Choir for three years, where he performed a classical repertoire, and sang with the Metropolitan Opera. He took part in Mahler&#x27;s Third Symphony at the Hollywood Bowl. It was in Los Angeles that Kravitz was introduced to rock music, listening to the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, the Grateful Dead, Aerosmith, Black Sabbath, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Kiss, Pink Floyd, and the Who, and he said he was &quot;attracted to the cool style, the girls, the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll lifestyle.&quot; During his junior high school years, he was also introduced to marijuana; he has stated that he was a &quot;pothead&quot; during his youth. His other musical influences at the time included Fela Kuti, Bill Withers, Marvin Gaye, Pharoah Sanders, and Miles Davis. Later influences came in the form of John Lennon and Bob Marley. Kravitz attended Beverly Hills High School, where he was classmates with Maria McKee, Nicolas Cage, and Slash. He taught himself to play piano and bass and made friends with Zoro, who would later become his long-time collaborator. His parents divorced in 1985.

==Career==
===1985–1990: Virgin Records and career debut===
With record labels still telling him his music was not &quot;black enough&quot; or &quot;white enough&quot;, Kravitz decided to record an album on his own under the name Romeo Blue. Kravitz had met the recording engineer, keyboardist, and bassist Henry Hirsch in 1985 when recording a demo at his Hoboken, New Jersey, recording studio. The two shared an interest in using real instruments and vintage recording equipment, as well as a love of R&amp;B, jazz, and rock. Kravitz would go on to collaborate with Hirsch on most of his albums. Kravitz began working on his debut album with Hirsch over the next year and a half, with Kravitz&#x27;s father paying for the studio time. Kravitz met saxophonist Karl Denson and invited him to play on the song &quot;Let Love Rule&quot;. Kravitz was so impressed with his playing that Denson played on much of the album. Beginning in the late 1980s, Denson toured with Kravitz for five years.

In October 1988, after completing most of the recording, Kravitz approached friend Stephen Elvis Smith, who had served as the music supervisor on Lisa Bonet&#x27;s &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; spin-off &quot;A Different World&quot;. Smith had also worked with Kravitz&#x27;s mother on the hit sitcom &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;. Kravitz urged Smith to manage his career and assist him in finding a record deal. In less than a month of shopping the recordings, five labels (Warner Bros, Elektra, Geffen, Capitol, and Virgin) were in a bidding war for Kravitz. Eventually, a deal was made with Virgin Records in January 1989, and signed by Virgin A&amp;R executive Nancy Jeffries. The label was &quot;excited&quot; about the music he was making, music inspired by his relationship with wife Bonet and their new daughter, Zoe. On Smith&#x27;s urging, Kravitz dropped the name Romeo Blue and reclaimed the Lenny Kravitz moniker. About his time as Romeo Blue, Kravitz said, &quot;Ultimately, it got me back to myself. And when I finally did accept myself for myself, music started flowing out of me.&quot;

Kravitz released his debut album &quot;Let Love Rule&quot; in 1989, a combination of rock and funk with a 1960s vibe. Music critics were mixed: some felt Kravitz was a gifted new artist, others felt he was overpowered by his musical influences. The album was a moderate success in the United States, but became an instant hit outside of the US, especially in Europe. Lisa Bonet directed the debut music video for the title track, &quot;Let Love Rule&quot;. Stephen Smith signed Kravitz with talent booking agency CAA, who soon were fielding offers for Kravitz, first on a club tour, and then in opening slots for Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers, Bob Dylan, and David Bowie. Having played essentially all of the instruments on the album, Kravitz had to quickly assemble a touring band to support the &quot;Let Love Rule&quot; release. In May 2009, a 20th-anniversary deluxe edition of &quot;Let Love Rule&quot; was released worldwide by Virgin. Kravitz launched a LLR(20) tour of Europe and the United States in support of the re-release.

===1991–2001: Popularity established===

In 1990, Kravitz produced the song &quot;Justify My Love&quot; for Madonna, which he co-wrote with Ingrid Chavez. The song appeared on her greatest hits album &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot;.

Kravitz separated from Lisa Bonet in 1991, amid rumors of an affair between him and Madonna. Kravitz has denied any infidelity. Kravitz and Bonet divorced in 1993. Kravitz produced the self-titled album &quot;Vanessa Paradis&quot; (1991) for French singer and actress Vanessa Paradis. He played most of the instruments and co-wrote most of the songs on the album.

In 1991, Kravitz released his second album, &quot;Mama Said&quot;. The songs on the album were about Bonet and documented his depression over their breakup. The single, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Over &#x27;til It&#x27;s Over&quot;, went to number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. A second single &quot;Always on the Run&quot;, a tribute to his mother, featured Slash on guitar. &quot;Stand by My Woman&quot; and &quot;What Goes Around Comes Around&quot; followed. Sean Lennon co-wrote and played piano on the song &quot;All I Ever Wanted&quot;.

In 1994, Kravitz recorded &quot;Main Squeeze&quot; with Teena Marie from her &quot;Passion Play&quot; CD. Kravitz also made a video to pay tribute to Teena Marie when she suddenly died on December 26, 2010. He recorded a funk-rock version of the song &quot;Deuce&quot; for the KISS cover album &quot;Kiss My Ass: Classic Kiss Regrooved&quot;. The track featured Stevie Wonder on harmonica and background vocals.

With &quot;5&quot; (1998), Kravitz won the first of his four consecutive Grammy for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance at the Grammy Awards of 1999. In 1999 he produced and sang with Cree Summer on her solo album Street Faërie.

His cover version of the Guess Who&#x27;s hit &quot;American Woman&quot; won him another Grammy at the Grammy Awards of 2000 and helped the Guess Who&#x27;s song reach a new audience. Kravitz&#x27;s version of the song originally came from the soundtrack of &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; and was added to &quot;5&quot; as a bonus track in 1999. Kravitz worked on two songs for Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Invincible&quot; album released in 2001; a snippet of &quot;Another Day&quot; was leaked, and the full version was officially released on the album &quot;Michael&quot; in 2010.

Kravitz released a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album in 2000. The single &quot;Again&quot; earned him his third consecutive Grammy for the Best Male Rock Vocal in the Grammy Awards of 2001.

===2006–2009: Live Earth, charity work, and &quot;It Is Time for a Love Revolution&quot;===

In January 2006, Kravitz contributed &quot;Breathe&quot; to absoluttracks, a project sponsored by Absolut Vodka. This song was re-mixed by ten musical producers and distributed via the internet. Kravitz appeared in the audience of Madonna&#x27;s Confessions Tour (2006) during numerous shows. He later joined Madonna live on stage to play guitar on the song, &quot;I Love New York&quot;, at the last of four Paris shows. Kravitz founded a design firm named Kravitz Design, stating if he hadn&#x27;t been a musician he would have been a designer. Kravitz Design, focused on interior and furniture design, has designed residential spaces, as well as a chandelier for the crystal company Swarovski, named &quot;Casino Royale&quot;.

On July 7, 2007, Kravitz performed at the Brazilian leg of Live Earth in Rio de Janeiro, making him one of three major international rock stars to perform two huge free concerts at the world-famous Copacabana Beach along with Macy Gray and the Rolling Stones. Kravitz had already played there on March 21, 2005, drawing 300,000 people on a concert of his own. The Live Earth concert, with eight other acts on the bill, including Pharrell and Macy Gray had an audience of 400,000 on the beach. Also in 2007, Kravitz released a version of &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; by John Lennon on the charity CD &quot;Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur&quot;. Kravitz also spent time recording his latest album, &quot;It Is Time for a Love Revolution&quot;, released February 5, 2008. On September 25, 2007, the Fats Domino tribute album &quot;Goin&#x27; Home; A Tribute To Fats Domino&quot; was released. Kravitz was on the song &quot;Whole Lotta Lovin&#x27;&quot; along with Rebirth Brass Band, Troy &quot;Trombone Shorty&quot; Andrews, Fred Wesley, Pee Wee Ellis, and Maceo Parker.

Kravitz made his feature film acting debut in &quot;Precious&quot; which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2009.

===2009–2011: U2 tour and &quot;Black and White America&quot;===

In June 2010 it was announced that Kravitz would guest star on an episode of the upcoming season of &quot;Entourage&quot;.

In 2011 Kravitz was honored with one of the highest cultural awards in France when he was made an Officer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by French cultural minister Frederic Mitterrand in Paris. Kravitz stated he was &quot;particularly touched&quot; to receive the award in France as his success in the country pre-dated his success in the United States and still enjoys great record sales in the country today. Kravitz joined other American recipients such as Martin Scorsese, George Clooney, and Bob Dylan. On February 26, 2012, he performed at the Daytona International Speedway for the Daytona 500, the opening race of the 2012 NASCAR Sprint Cup season. A sample of &quot;Are You Gonna Go My Way&quot; was used in American singer Chris Willis&#x27;s single &quot;Too Much In Love&quot;, released on August 16, 2011.

===2012–present: &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; films, Super Bowl performance, and further albums ===
Lenny Kravitz played the part of Katniss&#x27; creative stylist, Cinna, in the first two &quot;Hunger Games&quot; films, &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; released on March 23, 2012 and &quot;The Hunger Games: Catching Fire&quot; released on November 22, 2013.

In 2014 Lenny Kravitz released his tenth studio album &quot;Strut&quot; on his own Roxie Records via Kobalt Label Services. In 2015, Kravitz performed alongside Katy Perry at the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show.

As a designer, Kravitz launched a furniture collection in partnership with CB2 in 2015.

In 2015, he became a furniture designer for the first time ever launching a collection of furniture products marketed under the label CB2 x Kravitz design through retailer CB2. The collection was apparently inspired by the 70s and by the work of Italian designer Gabriella Crespi.

The &quot;Raise Vibration&quot; world tour (2018) coincided with the release of his 11th studio album.

In April 2018, Kravitz signed with BMG Rights Management for a new worldwide publishing music deal to go with his new album &quot;Raise Vibration&quot;, released in September 2018. BMG had acquired Kravitz&#x27;s music publishing rights in 2013, as part of Virgin Music Publishing.
In 2023, Kravitz wrote and performed a song for the film &quot;Rustin&quot; entitled &quot;Road to Freedom&quot;. The song was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In December 2023, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced shortlists for the 96th Oscars ceremony, and &quot;Road to Freedom&quot; was included in the Best Original Song category. Kravitz won Music Icon of the Year at the 49th People&#x27;s Choice Awards. In March 2024, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

On May 24, 2024, he released his 12th album, &quot;Blue Electric Light&quot;, which was supported by a world tour with the same name.

==Other work==
===Photography and collaboration with Leica===
Kravitz has partnered with Leica on two occasions: in 2015, a Leica M-P edition titled &quot;The Correspondent&quot;, and again in 2019 with a Monochrom edition titled &quot;Drifter&quot;.

===Kravitz Design===
Kravitz Design is a New York City–based company founded by Kravitz in 2003. Kravitz Design focuses on commercial, residential and product creative direction and design.

Among its clients are the Morgans Hotel Group, Swarovski Crystal, and The Setai Group. Swarovski selected Kravitz Design in 2005 and 2006 to participate in their Crystal Palace Collection. Kravitz Design also envisioned a luxury recording studio for The Setai Resort and Residences in Miami Beach, New York, Paris, and New Orleans. In 2010, Kravitz Design collaborated with Flavor Paper wallpaper on the Tropicalismo Collection, a line inspired by Brazil&#x27;s Tropicalia art movement of the late 1960s.

==Personal life==
In 1985, Kravitz met &quot;Cosby Show&quot; actress Lisa Bonet backstage at a New Edition concert in California. They were close friends for two years before beginning a relationship. In 1987, Kravitz moved back to New York City, where &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; was produced, to move in with Bonet. They eloped in Las Vegas on November 16, 1987, her 20th birthday. Kravitz, still known as Romeo Blue at the time, suddenly found himself in the headlines of tabloids. He and Bonet had a daughter, Zoë Isabella Kravitz, on December 1, 1988, who became an actress, singer and model. Kravitz and Bonet separated in 1991. They divorced amicably in 1993.

Kravitz dated French singer and model Vanessa Paradis from 1991 to 1996. He began dating Brazilian model Adriana Lima in 2001, and they lived together before becoming engaged in 2002. The engagement was called off in August 2003. Lima was featured in the music video for Kravitz&#x27;s 2002 single &quot;Yesterday Is Gone (My Dear Kay)&quot;. He then briefly dated and was engaged to Australian actress Nicole Kidman from 2003 to 2004.

Kravitz identifies himself as a Christian in a religious sense &quot;through choice&quot; but stated: &quot;I&#x27;m also a Jew. It&#x27;s all the same to me.&quot; During another interview, he stated: &quot;I&#x27;m half Jewish, I&#x27;m half black, I look in-between.&quot; He also notes that spirituality &quot;has been an important issue in [his] growth&quot;, citing his upbringing by parents of different faiths. Such spirituality is prominently featured in many of his songs, such as the lyrics on his album &quot;Baptism&quot;, and a tattoo on his back which is inscribed with &quot;My Heart Belongs to Jesus Christ&quot;. In 2011, he stated that his 2005 religious commitment to remain celibate until remarriage was unchanged. In a 2014 interview with &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot;, however, he reconsidered his previous stance. In 2024, Kravitz reaffirmed his desire to remain celibate once again, stating to &quot;The Guardian&quot; that it was his father&#x27;s infidelity that inspired him to make a change. &quot;After the marriage, [to ex-wife Lisa Bonet] I became more like him. I was becoming a player...I didn&#x27;t like it. I didn&#x27;t want to be that guy. So I had to tackle that and it took years...by taking responsibility. Discipline. Not letting my own desires take over.&quot; Kravitz also stated in the same interview that he had not been in a romantic relationship for 9 years at that point.

He currently owns a house in Paris, a farm compound in Brazil, and a trailer with the surrounding land in The Bahamas.

He follows veganism with a primarily raw vegan diet, and uses his land in Brazil and The Bahamas to grow his own food. PETA named Kravitz one of the Most Beautiful Vegan Celebrities of 2022.

<text>Valentin Conrart (; 1603 – 23 September 1675) was a French author, and as a founder of the Académie française, the first occupant of seat 2.

==Biography==
He was born in Paris of Calvinist parents, and was educated for business. However, after his father&#x27;s death in 1620, he began to move in literary circles, and soon acquired a reputation, though he wrote nothing for many years. He was made councillor and secretary to the king; and in 1629 his house became the resort of a group who met to talk over literary subjects, and to read and mutually criticize their works.

Cardinal Richelieu offered the society his protection, and in this way (1635) the Académie française was created. Its first meetings were held in Conrart&#x27;s house. He was unanimously elected secretary, and discharged the duties of his post for forty-three years, till his death.

==Works==
The most important of Conrart&#x27;s written works is his &quot;Mémoires sur l&#x27;histoire de son temps&quot; published by Louis Monmerqué in 1825.

<text>Jean Chapelain (4 December 1595 – 22 February 1674) was a French poet and critic during the &quot;Grand Siècle&quot;, best known for his role as an organizer and founding member of the . Chapelain acquired considerable prestige as a literary critic, but his own major work, an epic poem about Joan of Arc called &quot;La Pucelle,&quot; (1656) was lampooned by his contemporary Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux.

==Background==
Chapelain was born in Paris. His father wanted him to become a notary, but his mother, who had known Pierre de Ronsard, had decided otherwise.

==Early education==
At an early age Chapelain began to qualify himself for literature, learning, under Nicolas Bourbon, Greek and Latin, and teaching himself Italian and Spanish.

==Tutor==
Having finished his studies, Chapelain taught Spanish to a young nobleman for a short time, before being appointed tutor to the two sons of Sébastien Le Hardy, lord of la Trousse, &quot;grand-prévôt de France&quot;, Gouye de Longuemarre, &quot;&quot;Eclaircissemens sur un officier de la maison de nos rois, appelé roi des ribauds&quot;, in Constant Leber, ed. &quot;Collection des meilleurs dissertations, notices et traités particuliers relatifs à l&#x27;histoire de France&quot;, part V (1838:234) notes Nicolas Hardi, sieur de la Trousse, &quot;grand-prévôt de France&quot;; his son Sébastien inherited in 1595; &quot;a M. de la Trousse, grand provost of France&quot;. Attached for the next 17 years to this family and given the responsibility of administering their fortune, he seems to have published nothing then but to have acquired a great reputation for potential.

==Author==
His first published work was a preface for the &quot;Adone&quot; of Giambattista Marino, who printed and published that notorious poem at Paris. It was followed by a translation of Mateo Alemán&#x27;s novel, &quot;Guzmán de Alfarache&quot; and by four extremely indifferent odes, one of them addressed to Cardinal Richelieu.

In a conversation with Richelieu in about 1632, reported by the abbé d&#x27;Olivet, Chapelain maintained the importance of maintaining the unities of time, place and action, and it is explicitly stated that the doctrine was new to the cardinal and to the poets who were in his pay. Rewarded with a pension of a thousand crowns and from the first an active member of the newly constituted Academy, Chapelain drew up the plan of the grammar and dictionary, the compilation of which was to be a principal function of the young institution, and at Richelieu&#x27;s command drew up the &quot;Sentiments de l’Académie sur le Cid&quot;.

The credit of introducing the law of the dramatic unities into French literature has been claimed for many writers, and especially for the Abbé d&#x27;Aubignac, whose &quot;Pratique du théâtre&quot; appeared in 1657. Aristotle&#x27;s theory had of course been enunciated in the &quot;Art poétique&quot; of Julius Caesar Scaliger in 1561, and subsequently by other writers, but undoubtedly it was the action of Chapelain that transferred it from the region of theory to that of actual practice. In 1656 he published, in a magnificent format, the first twelve cantos of his celebrated epic on Joan of Arc, &quot;La Pucelle&quot;, on which he had been working for twenty years. Six editions of the poem were disposed of in eighteen months. This was the end of the poetic reputation of Chapelain, &quot;the legist of Parnassus.&quot; Later the slashing satire of Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux resulted in Chapelain (&quot;&quot;Le plus grand poète Français qu&#x27;ait jamais été et du plus solide jugement&quot;,&quot; as he is called in Colbert&#x27;s list) taking his place among the failures of modern art.

==Critic==
Chapelain&#x27;s reputation as a critic survived, and in 1663 he was employed by Colbert to draw up an account of contemporary men of letters, destined to guide the king in his distribution of pensions. In this pamphlet, as in his letters, he shows to far greater advantage than in his unfortunate epic. His prose is incomparably better than his verse; his criticisms are remarkable for their justice and generosity; his erudition and kindliness are well-attested; the royal attention was directed alike towards the author&#x27;s firmest friends and bitterest enemies. To him the young Jean Racine was indebted not only for advice, but also for the pension of six hundred livres which was so useful to him. The catholicity of Chapelain&#x27;s taste is shown by his &quot;De la lecture des vieux romans&quot; (printed 1870), in which he praises the , forgotten by his generation.

Chapelain refused many honours, and his disinterestedness makes it necessary to receive with caution the stories of Gilles Ménage and Tallemant des Réaux, who claimed that he became a miser, and that a considerable fortune was found hoarded in his apartments when he died.

<text>: &quot;Aleman is sometimes used to refer to German.&quot;
Mateo Alemán y del Nero (Seville, September 1547 – Mexico City, 1614) was a Spanish novelist and writer.

==Biography==
Alemán was born in Seville, Andalucía, where he graduated from the University in 1564. He later studied at Salamanca and Alcalá, and from 1571 to 1588 held a post in the treasury; in 1594 he was arrested on suspicion of , but was speedily released. According to some authors, he was descended from Jews forcibly converted to Catholicism after 1492, and one of his forebears had been burned by the Inquisition for secretly continuing to practice Judaism. In 1599, he published the first part of &quot;Guzmán de Alfarache&quot;, a celebrated picaresque novel which passed through no less than sixteen editions in five years; a spurious sequel was issued in 1602, but the authentic continuation did not appear until 1604.
In 1571, Alemán married, unhappily, Catalina de Espinosa, and was constantly in money difficulties, being imprisoned for debt at Seville at the end of 1602.

In 1608, Alemán emigrated to America, and is said to have carried on business as a printer in Mexico, where he is assumed to have remained for the rest of his life. His &quot;Ortografía castellana&quot; (1609), published in Mexico, contains ingenious and practical proposals for the reform of Spanish spelling. Nothing is recorded of Alemán after 1609, but it is sometimes asserted that he was still living in 1617.

==Works==
In addition to the works already mentioned, Alemán is the author of a life (1604) of St. Anthony of Padua, and versions of two odes of Horace bear witness to his taste and metrical accomplishment. His most famous work, however, is &quot;Guzmán de Alfarache&quot;, which was translated into French in 1600, into Italian in 1606, into German in 1615, into English in 1622 by James Mabbe, and into Latin in 1623.

<text>The xylorimba (sometimes referred to as xylo-marimba or marimba-xylophone) is a pitched percussion instrument similar to an extended-range xylophone with a range identical to some 5-octave celestas or 5-octave marimbas, though typically an octave higher than the latter. Despite its name, it is not a combination of a xylophone and a marimba; its name has been a source of confusion, as many composers have called for a &#x27;xylorimba&#x27;, including Alban Berg, Pierre Boulez and Olivier Messiaen, but for parts requiring only a four-octave xylophone. However, Pierre Boulez wrote for two five-octave xylorimbas in .

Like the xylophone and marimba, the xylorimba consists of a series of wooden bars laid out like a piano keyboard &quot;with a compass sufficiently large to embrace the low-sounding bars of the marimba and the highest-sounding bars of the xylophone.&quot; The lower notes of the xylorimba are described as sounding closer to a xylophone than a marimba, on account of its bars being both thicker and narrower, and due to the different size and shape of its resonators; the size and shape of the bars differs to emphasize different overtones.

The xylorimba experienced its greatest popularity in the 1920s and 30s, particularly within vaudeville theatre

<doc id="165576" wikidata="Q1136766" url="?curid=165576" title="Fairchild Aircraft">
<text>Fairchild was an American aircraft and aerospace manufacturing company based at various times in Farmingdale, New York; Hagerstown, Maryland; and San Antonio, Texas.

==History==

===Early aircraft===

The company was founded by Sherman Fairchild in 1924 as Fairchild Aviation Corporation, based in Farmingdale, and East Farmingdale, New York. It was established as the parent company for Fairchild&#x27;s many aviation interests. The company produced the first US aircraft to include a fully enclosed cockpit and hydraulic landing gear, the Fairchild FC-1. At some point, it was also known as the Fairchild Aircraft Manufacturing Company. The Fairchild Aircraft Ltd. of Longueuil, Quebec, Canada was an aircraft manufacturer during the period of 1920 to 1950, which served as a subsidiary of the Fairchild company of the United States. The Fairchild Engine Company was formed with the purchase of the Caminez Engine Company in 1925. In 1929, Sherman Fairchild purchased a majority stock interest in Kreider-Reisner Aircraft Company of Hagerstown, Maryland. The company moved to Hagerstown in 1931.

A series of related designs beginning with the Fairchild FC-1 and continuing to the Fairchild 71 were designed for aerial photography as a result of dissatisfaction towards available aircraft which were incapable of flying steadily enough at a sufficient altitude. In 1935, Fairchild was hired by the US government to do aerial photograph surveys of the United States to track soil erosion and its effects. 

A Fairchild FC-2 was used by Richard E. Byrd during his Antarctic Expedition.

===World War II===


During World War II, Fairchild produced PT-19/PT-23/PT-26 (Cornell) and AT-21 Gunner trainers, C-82 Packet transports and drones. The Fairchild AT-21 Gunner, a twin-engine trainer, was manufactured at a former rayon mill in Burlington, North Carolina. Also large numbers of the Fairchild 24 (C-61/Argus) were produced for the military (principally as the Argus for the Royal Air Force), and continued production after the war for the civilian market. Fairchild ranked 73rd among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.

===Postwar===

The C-82 Packet led to the C-119 Flying Boxcar, another U.S. military transport aircraft. The C-119 could carry cargo, personnel, stretcher patients and mechanized equipment with the ability to make &quot;paradrops&quot; of cargo and troops. The first C-119 made its initial flight in November 1947, and by the time production ceased in 1955, more than 1,100 C-119s had been built for use in the USAF, the Royal Canadian Air Force and others. Many were converted into waterbombers after being retired from military service.

In 1949, the Hagerstown, Maryland, Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation developed the Chase XCG-20 glider into the C-123 Provider transport which entered service in 1955. In 1954 Fairchild purchased the American Helicopter Company, incorporating it and the XH-26 Jet Jeep as a division. In 1956, the company acquired rights to the Fokker Friendship, producing 206 of the aircraft as the Fairchild F-27 and Fairchild Hiller FH-227. During the 1950s, Fairchild was a large subcontractor to Boeing for B-52 fuselage sections and wing panels. Later, the company built McDonnell-Douglas F-4 Phantom II tail sections, Grumman F-14 Tomcat tails, and Space Shuttle orbiter stabilizers. 

In 1964, the company purchased Hiller Aircraft, changing its name to Fairchild Hiller and producing the FH-1100, until 1973 when the helicopter division was sold back to Stanley Hiller. In 1965, the company acquired the Republic Aviation Company.

Following the death of its founder, Fairchild changed its name to Fairchild Industries in 1971. This was a merger of Fairchild-Hiller Corporation, division and subsidiaries: Fairchild Aircraft Marketing Company, Fairchild Aircraft Services Division, Fairchild Republic Division, Fairchild Space and Electronics Division, Fairchild Stratos Division, Burns Aero Seat Company, Inc., Fairchild Arms International, Ltd., Fairchild Aviation (Asia) Ltd., Fairchild Aviation (Holland) N.V., Fairchild-Germantown Development Company, Inc. and S.J. Industries, Inc. Before 1971, Fairchild Industries was a term used to include many of the companies of its founder Sherman Mills Fairchild.

After the name change, the company purchased Swearingen and manufactured the Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner, a successful commuter aircraft that gained orders from the U.S. military as the C-26 Metroliner. In 1971, the company began developing the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II in Germantown, Maryland, which prevailed over the rival Northrop YA-9 in the A-X competition for an eventual production run of 716 aircraft.

The company developed the T-46 jet trainer to replace the elderly Cessna T-37 Tweet trainer, but it was not accepted by the Air Force because of performance problems.

Their association with Boeing continued into the 1980s as they built wing control surfaces for 747s and 757s.

Aircraft production was ended in Hagerstown, Maryland in 1984.

After the company took over Dornier&#x27;s civil assets in 1996, the company was renamed Fairchild Dornier. The company commenced production of the Dornier 328 in 1998 under license from Deutsche Aerospace AG (DASA).

In December 1999, Fairchild Aerospace Corporation was acquired by German insurer Allianz A.G. and the United States investment group Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice Inc. for $1.2 billion.

In 2003, the assets of Fairchild were purchased by M7 Aerospace and the new company was moved to San Antonio.

On December 15, 2010, M7 was purchased by the United States subsidiary of the Israeli defense contractor Elbit Systems. M7 Aerospace does not manufacture aircraft, but focuses on aerospace parts and support services.

<doc id="165578" wikidata="Q4783126" url="?curid=165578" title="Arab–Israeli peace projects">
<text>Arab–Israeli peace projects are projects to promote peace and understanding between the Arab League and Israel in different spheres. These are part of a broader attempt at a peace process between Palestinians and Israelis. Sponsors of such projects can be found both in Israel and Palestine.

== Joint economic efforts and businesses ==

Israeli–Palestinian economic peace efforts are efforts to promote joint economic projects and efforts between Israelis and Palestinians as a pathway to reach peace between the two groups. They are based partially on official efforts and projects by the governments of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, and partially on private efforts by individual companies and business people who seek to promote various ventures which promote economic unity and collaboration between the two sides.

This involves ongoing joint efforts by regional leaders to launch joint new industrial and economic projects, which will create new local businesses and job growth, and promote ongoing cooperation. It is an official joint effort of the Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian governments to promote economic cooperation, and new business initiatives which can help both sides work together, and create a better diplomatic atmosphere and better economic conditions. It constitutes a co-existence project, as it is mainly designed to foster efforts in the private sector, once governments provide the initial investment and facilities.

In early 2010, President Shimon Peres took an active and personal role in efforts to promote local business initiatives. Peres personally led a tour of top Israeli executives through the West Bank, and told them about many new Palestinian businesses which show much growth potential. One company highlighted by Peres was the New Generation Technology incubator, a joint Jewish-Arab effort founded in 2002 which encourages new ideas and projects in technology and biotechnology.

=== Joint industrial parks ===
One major idea is the creation of industrial parks where Israelis and Palestinians can work together. In 2011, according to Naftali Bennett, there were about 50 factories in the West Bank industrial region where Jews and Palestinians were working together.

=== Local efforts and implementation ===
;Gilboa region
Joint economic cooperation between Israeli officials in Gilboa and Palestinian officials in Jenin has begun to have major results and benefits. In October 2009, a new project got underway promoting tourism and travel between the two areas. Major new business efforts and tourist attractions have been initiated in Jenin. The two regions are planning a joint industrial zone which would bridge the border. Palestinians would produce locally-made handicrafts and sell them through Gilboa to other regions of the world. Another possible project is a joint language center, where Israelis and Palestinians would teach each other Arabic and Hebrew, as well as aspects of their cultural heritage.

=== Valley of Peace initiative ===

The Valley of Peace initiative is an effort to promote economic cooperation between Israel, Jordan and Palestinians. It was initially centered around efforts and joint projects in the Arava/Arabah Valley, along which runs the southern portion of the Israel–Jordan border.

The idea for this project began in 2005, when Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority asked the World Bank to analyze the feasibility of this idea.

The Valley of Peace initiative began with a joint proposal in 2008 for a number of water-related initiatives. The study concluded in 2013, and an agreement was signed in 2013 by Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority to move ahead with the plan.

The &quot;Red-Dead&quot; project to build a canal from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea was originally conceived and created within the Valley of Peace Initiative. It was officially referred to within that plan as the &quot;Peace Carrier.&quot;

In early 2015, Israel and Jordan signed a major agreement to carry out the &quot;Red-Dead&quot; project, and to address the major regional problems of acute shortage of clean fresh water in Jordan, and the rapid contraction of the Dead Sea. A new desalination plant to be built near the Jordanian tourist resort of Aqaba would convert salt water from the Red Sea into fresh water for use in southern Israel and southern Jordan; each region would get eight billion to 13 billion gallons a year. This process would produces about as much brine as a waste product; the brine would be piped more than 100 miles to help replenish the Dead Sea, already known for its high salt content. This would reinforce the status of the Dead Sea as an important economic resource to both nations, in multiple areas including tourism, industry and business.

In December 2015, Israel and Jordan formally released the technical plans to move ahead with this project. In May 2016, Israel and Jordan presented their plan for a Red Sea-Dead Sea canal to the World Bank and other potential investors.

In July 2017, Israel and the Palestinian Authority announced a new deal to provide drinking water for millions of Palestinians. this was part of the larger deal between Israel, Jordan and Palestinians to build a 220-kilometer (137-mile) pipeline to convey water from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea. One benefit of this canal would be to replenish the dwindling Dead Sea. Also, the water in this canal will generate electricity for local towns, and will also power a desalination plant to produce drinking water.

Grant funds might also be used to hire medical staff (doctors, nurses, specialists, etc.) and/or hospital personnel (staff, administrators, etc.).

IPCEE may provide grants to the Israeli government and the Palestinian National Authority to fund the construction of new community centers such as libraries, women’s centers, youth centers and learning/language centers. These community centers will offer a variety of resources and opportunities for economically disadvantaged locals, including classes, lectures, language and literacy programs, and vocational training. Vocational trainings, for example, will include professional training workshops to teach locals the fundamentals of various trades such as carpentry, blacksmithing, plumbing, traditional and modern baking techniques, food service, computer science, textiles and sewing, ceramics, photography, newspaper production, and theater. These community centers will also provide public access to useful facilities such as conference rooms, auditoriums, media libraries and computer labs.

Grants would be made to governmental agencies as well as other public institutions in Israel and the West Bank.

=== Jews for Israeli-Palestinian Peace ===
Jews for Israeli–Palestinian Peace (Swedish: &quot;Judar för israelisk-palestinsk fred&quot;), abbreviated as JIPF, is a Stockholm-based association, founded by Swedish Jews in 1982, following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.

JIPF states that they want to work for a &quot;fair and lasting peace&quot; in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, based on national self-determination and independence for both peoples. Its political programme include demands for a creation of a Palestinian state, Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from all territories occupied in 1967, the dismantlement of Israeli settlements and that the Palestinian refugee question must be based on the principle of the right of return or economic compensation.

With a grant from the &quot;Helena Berings Minnesfond (English: Helena Berings Memorial Fund)&quot; the group co-ran a school program in partnership with the Palestinian Association of Sweden. The program facilitated dialogues between Palestinians and Jews in approximately fifty schools over three years.

=== Women Wage Peace ===
After the Gaza War in 2014, a group of Israeli women founded the Women Wage Peace movement with the goal of reaching a bilaterally acceptable political peace agreement between Israel and Palestine. While based mainly in Israel, the movement has worked to build connections with Palestinians, reaching out to women and men of many different religions and political backgrounds. The group&#x27;s activities have included a collective hunger strike outside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s formal residence and a protest march from Northern Israel to Jerusalem. As of May 2017, Women Wage Peace had over 20,000 members and supporters associated with it.

== Jewish-Muslim dialogue ==

=== The American Jewish Committee ===
While forcefully speaking out against Islamic anti-Semitism and anti-Israeli rhetoric, the American Jewish Committee (AJC) has worked since 1985 to enhance relations between Jews and Muslims. The AJC encourages and engages in dialogue on many levels with like-minded groups committed to fostering tolerance and cooperation.

Their website states that &quot;The American Jewish Committee has demonstrated a profound commitment to enhancing relations between Jews and Muslims, a vital part of its fundamental dedication to the promotion of interreligious understanding in the United States and around the world. Rejecting the inevitability of a &quot;clash of civilizations,&quot; AJC has instead insisted on the possibility of a &quot;community of civilizations&quot; by encouraging dialogue on the highest levels with like-minded groups committed to fostering tolerance and cooperation. In so doing, we have achieved a number of breakthroughs in this vital arena. For well over a decade, AJC has dedicated itself to forging significant relationships with Arab and Muslim leaders around the world. AJC has traveled extensively in the Muslim world – from Morocco to Mauritania, through the Middle East and the Gulf states, to Indonesia. We have met with scores of Muslim leaders, including top officials of Egypt, Turkey, Jordan, Tunisia, Bosnia, Kuwait, Qatar, Malaysia, and Indonesia, to discuss topics ranging from relations with Israel and the United States to the promotion of international Muslim-Jewish dialogue.&quot; Seeking to advance Jewish-Muslim relations

In 1986 the AJC publicly condemned the murder by bomb attack of Alex Odeh (in Oct. 1985), a leader of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in Santa Ana, California. The AJC had a meeting with the Federal Bureau of Investigation director William Webster about this incident; they urged action to identify and punish those responsible for anti-Arab bigotry. In 1986 the AJC submitted testimony to the United States House of Representatives, Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, on the topic of violence and discrimination towards Arab-Americans.

In 1991, on the brink of the Allied war against Iraq, the AJC issued a statement warning the public not to engage in discrimination towards American Arabs or Muslims. In part, they stated, &quot;We are ever mindful of what happened to Japanese-Americans as a result of war hysteria shortly after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941. Some 120,000 Japanese-Americans, two-thirds of whom were American citizens, were evacuated and incarcerated in internment camps... without any evidence whatsoever that they were a threat to U.S. security. This must not happen again.&quot; (AJC statement by executive director David Harris)

From 1992 to 1995 the AJC worked to lobby the United States government to intervene on behalf of Muslims in Bosnia.

In 1993 the AJC sponsored the first national conference on &quot;Muslims and Jews in North America: Past, Present and Future&quot; with the Institute for Islamic-Judaic Studies at University of Denver in October. In 1994 they sponsored the second such conference. The third conference had to be canceled, when the AJC could not found Muslim partners who were willing to publicly condemn the current wave of terrorist attacks on Israel.

In 1999 the AJC helped aid Muslims in Kosovo.

In 2001 the AJC initiated a new project designed to advance understanding between Muslims and Jews by publishing two books: &quot;Children of Abraham: An Introduction to Judaism for Muslims&quot;, by Professor Reuven Firestone, a scholar of Islam at Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles, was written to describe Judaism to Muslims; &quot;Children of Abraham: An Introduction to Islam for Jews&quot;, by professor Khalid Duran, was written to describe Islam for Jews.

=== Children of Abraham ===
Children of Abraham seeks to build an international community of Muslim and Jewish youth that celebrates their religious identities. Through an engaging project involving a photographic exploration of Jewish and Muslim communities around the world, and honest, unflinching online dialogue, participants form a network of advocates and ambassadors for ground-breaking Muslim-Jewish relations in six continents.

=== Centre for the Study of Muslim-Jewish Relations ===
In July 2007 a new Centre for the Study of Muslim-Jewish Relations was opened in Cambridge, United Kingdom. It is partly financed by a £1 million contribution from Richard Stone, a Jewish philanthropist. In the first instance its students they will study common areas between the two religions. Eventually work will extend into more controversial areas, including the Israel–Palestine question.

<text>Jean-Henri-Alphonse Barraqué (17 January 1928 – 17 August 1973) was a French composer and music writer. His relatively small is known for its serialism.

==Life==
Barraqué was born in Puteaux, Hauts-de-Seine. In 1931, he moved with his family to Paris. He studied in Paris with Jean Langlais and Olivier Messiaen and, through Messiaen, became interested in serialism. After completing his Piano Sonata in 1952, he suppressed or destroyed his earlier works. A book published by the French music critic André Hodeir, titled &quot;Since Debussy&quot;, created controversy around Barraqué by claiming this work as perhaps the finest piano sonata since Beethoven. As the work had still not been publicly performed, and only two other works by him had at this time, the extravagant claims made for Barraqué in this book were received with some scepticism. Whilst with hindsight it is clear that Hodeir had accurately perceived the exceptional features of Barraqué&#x27;s music—notably its searing Romantic intensity, which distinguishes it from the contemporaneous works of Boulez or Stockhausen.

As Paul Griffiths&#x27; biography clarified, Boulez had in fact attempted to get the Barraqué Piano Sonata performed for some years after it was finished. Barraqué&#x27;s music was published starting in 1963 by the Florentine businessman Aldo Bruzzichelli, who provided much-needed material assistance for the composer, but whose promotion could not perhaps compete with that of the better known Universal Edition in Vienna who published Boulez, Berio, and Stockhausen.

Embracing the Parisian avant-garde, Barraqué entered into a romantic relationship with the philosopher Michel Foucault. Together, they tried to produce their greatest work, used recreational drugs heavily and engaged in sado-masochistic sexual activity.

Barraqué was involved in a car accident in 1964, and his apartment was destroyed by fire in November 1968. He suffered from bad health for much of his life. Nevertheless, his death in Paris in August 1973, at the age of 45, was sudden and unexpected, and he appeared to have resumed serious work on a number of larger compositions from the &quot;Death of Virgil&quot; cycle.

==Music and reputation==
Barraqué stated that he wrote about 30 works before those that he eventually acknowledged; as far as is known they were destroyed by him. They included a &quot;Nocturne&quot; and &quot;Mouvement lent&quot; for piano, at least three piano sonatas, a sonata for unaccompanied violin, and a symphony in C-sharp minor. The presumably fourth, but un-numbered Piano Sonata, for which he gave the date 1952, was his earliest acknowledged work. Barraqué then produced his only electronic piece, the musique concrète &quot;Etude&quot; (1954), made at Pierre Schaeffer&#x27;s studio. Subsequently, he planned a large-scale cycle of pieces, &quot;La Mort de Virgile&quot;, based on Hermann Broch&#x27;s novel &quot;The Death of Virgil&quot;, a book which Barraqué&#x27;s friend and sometime lover Michel Foucault recommended to him. This cycle, along with other pieces deriving from it or acting as commentaries upon it, he envisaged as his principal lifelong creative project. Following the scheme of the novel, it was to be divided into four sub-cycles: &quot;Water (The Arrival)&quot;, &quot;Fire (The Descent)&quot;, &quot;Earth (The Expectancy)&quot; and &quot;Air (The Return)&quot;. Most of Barraqué&#x27;s creative efforts went into the works which were to take their place in &quot;Fire (The Descent)&quot;, which – to give an idea of the projected scope of the whole design – was to have consisted of thirteen works. Before his death he completed two of the projected parts: &quot;Chant aprés chant&quot; (1966), and &quot;Le Temps restitué&quot; (1957/68). Fragments of some of the other parts exist.

Barraqué also wrote &quot;... Au delà du hasard&quot; (1958–59) for three female voices and ensemble, and a Concerto for clarinet, vibraphone and ensemble in 1962–68, which are related to &quot;The Death of Virgil&quot;, but not actually part of that cycle. (&quot;... Au delà du hasard&quot; is described as a commentary on &quot;Affranchi du hasard&quot;, which was to have been the eleventh piece of &quot;Fire (The Descent)&quot; but was not actually composed.) The only other extant piece by Barraqué is &quot;Séquence&quot; (1955–56), a setting of Nietzsche for soprano and ensemble which is partly a re-working of three songs for soprano and piano from the early fifties.

Barraqué&#x27;s use of tone rows in his work is quite distinctive. Rather than using a single tone row for an entire piece, as Anton Webern did, or using a number of related rows in one work, as Alban Berg or Arnold Schoenberg sometimes did, Barraqué starts by using one row, and then subtly alters it to get a second. This second row is then used for a while before being slightly altered again to make a third. This process continues throughout the work. He called this technique &quot;proliferating series&quot;.

Harry Halbreich has written that &quot;Barraqué&#x27;s whole work is marked by terrible despair, lightened by no religious or ideological faith, and entirely dominated by the great shadow of Death&quot;. In 1998 the record company CPO issued his entire output on CD, in performances by the Austrian ensemble Klangforum Wien.

The major reference work on his music in English is a biography entitled &quot;The Sea on Fire&quot; by the British music critic Paul Griffiths (2003). In German, Heribert Henrich&#x27;s book of 1997 is its complement. His music is now published by the German firm of Bärenreiter.

==Writings==
Barraqué wrote many articles on other composers (including Alban Berg, Monteverdi, Mozart and Messiaen) and on theoretical aspects of contemporary music. His major prose work is his book on Claude Debussy (Paris: Éditions du Seuil, 1962). He also made numerous analyses of works in the standard repertoire from J. S. Bach to Honegger, some of which he used in his teaching. His few pupils included the British composer Bill Hopkins.

<text>In ancient Rome, the Vestal Virgins or Vestals (, singular ) were priestesses of Vesta, virgin goddess of Rome&#x27;s sacred hearth and its flame.

The Vestals were unlike any other public priesthood. They were chosen before puberty from several suitable candidates, freed from any legal ties and obligations to their birth family, and enrolled in Vesta&#x27;s priestly college of six priestesses. They were supervised by a senior vestal but chosen and governed by Rome&#x27;s leading male priest, the ; in the Imperial era, this meant the emperor.

Vesta&#x27;s acolytes vowed to serve her for at least thirty years, study and practise her rites in service of the Roman State, and maintain their chastity throughout. In addition to their obligations on behalf of Rome, Vestals had extraordinary rights and privileges, some of which were granted to no others, male or female.

The Vestals took turns to supervise Vesta&#x27;s sacred hearth so that at least one Vestal was stationed there at all times. Vestals who allowed the sacred fire to go out were punished with whipping. Vestals who lost their chastity were guilty of , and were sentenced to living burial, a bloodless death that must seem voluntary. Their sexual partners, if known, were publicly beaten to death. These were infrequent events; most vestals retired with a generous pension and universal respect. They were then free to marry, though few of them did. Some appear to have renewed their vows.

In 382 AD, the Christian emperor Gratian confiscated the public revenues assigned to the cult of Vesta in Rome. Soon after, the Vestals vanished from the historical record.

==History==

Priesthoods with similar functions to the Vestals of Rome had an ancient and deeply embedded religious role in various surrounding Latin communities. According to Livy, the Vestals had pre-Roman origins at Alba Longa, where Rhea Silvia, a virgin daughter of the king, forced by her usurper uncle to become a Vestal, miraculously gave birth to twin boys, Romulus and Remus. The twins were fathered by Mars; they survived their uncle&#x27;s attempts to kill them through exposure or drowning, and Romulus went on to found Rome. In the most widely accepted versions of Rome&#x27;s beginnings the city&#x27;s legendary second king, Numa Pompilius, built its first Temple of Vesta, appointed its first pair of Vestals and subsidised them as a collegiate priesthood. He then added a second pair. Rome&#x27;s sixth king, Servius Tullius, who was also said to have been miraculously fathered by the fire-god Vulcan or the household Lar on a captive Vestal, increased the number of Vestals to six; in the Imperial era, as attested by Plutarch, the college had six vestals at any given time. Claims by Ambrose and others that the college comprised seven vestals in the late 4th-century rest on &quot;very unsatisfactory evidence&quot;.

The Vestals were a powerful and influential priesthood. Towards the end of the Republican era, when Sulla included the young Julius Caesar in his proscriptions, the Vestals interceded on Caesar&#x27;s behalf and gained him pardon. Caesar&#x27;s adopted heir, Augustus, promoted the Vestals&#x27; moral reputation and presence at public functions, and restored several of their customary privileges that had fallen into abeyance. They were held in awe and attributed certain mysterious and supernatural powers and abilities. Pliny the Elder tacitly accepted these powers as fact:

The 4th-century AD urban prefect Symmachus, who sought to maintain traditional Roman religion during the rise of Christianity, wrote:

Dissolution of the Vestal College would have followed soon after the emperor Gratian confiscated its revenues in 382 AD. The last epigraphically attested Vestal is Coelia Concordia, a who in 385 AD erected a statue to the deceased pontiff Vettius Agorius Praetextatus. Zosimos claims that when Theodosius I visited Rome in 394 AD, his niece Serena insulted an aged Vestal, said to be the last of her kind. It is unclear from Zosimos&#x27;s narrative whether Vesta&#x27;s cult was still functioning, maintained by that single Vestal, or moribund. Cameron is skeptical of the entire tale, noting that Theodosius did not visit Rome in 394.

==Term of service==
The Vestals were committed to the priesthood before puberty (when 6–10 years old) and sworn to celibacy for a minimum period of 30 years. A thirty-year commitment was divided into three-decade-long periods during which Vestals were respectively students, servants, and teachers. Vestals typically retired with a state pension in their late 30s to early 40s and thereafter were free to marry. The , acting as the father of the bride, might arrange a marriage with a suitable Roman nobleman on behalf of the retired Vestal, but no literary accounts of such marriages have survived; Plutarch repeats a claim that &quot;few have welcomed the indulgence, and that those who did so were not happy, but were a prey to repentance and dejection for the rest of their lives, thereby inspiring the rest with superstitious fears, so that until old age and death they remained steadfast in their virginity&quot;. Some Vestals preferred to renew their vows. Occia was vestal for 57 years between 38 BC and 19 AD.
=== Selection ===
To obtain entry into the order, a girl had to be free of physical, moral, and mental &#x27;defects&#x27;, have two living parents, and be a daughter of a free-born resident of Rome. From at least the mid-Republican era, the chose Vestals by lot from a group of twenty high-born candidates at a gathering of their families and other Roman citizens.

Under the Papian Law of the 3rd century BC, candidates for Vestal priesthoods had to be of patrician birth. Membership was opened to plebeians as it became difficult to find patricians willing to commit their daughters to 30 years as a Vestal, and then ultimately even from the daughters of freedmen for the same reason.

The choosing ceremony was known as a (capture). Once a girl was chosen to be a Vestal, the pointed to her and led her away from her parents with the words, &quot;I take you, (beloved), to be a Vestal priestess, who will carry out sacred rites which it is the law for a Vestal priestess to perform on behalf of the Roman people, on the same terms as her who was a Vestal &#x27;on the best terms (thus, with all the entitlements of a Vestal). As soon as she entered the atrium of Vesta&#x27;s temple, she was under the goddess&#x27;s service and protection.

If a Vestal died before her contracted term ended, potential replacements would be presented in the quarters of the chief Vestal to select the most virtuous. Unlike normal inductees, these candidates did not have to be prepubescent, nor even virgins; they could be young widows or even divorcees, though that was frowned upon and thought unlucky. Tacitus recounts how Gaius Fonteius Agrippa and Domitius Pollio offered their daughters as Vestal candidates in 19 AD to fill such a vacant position. Equally matched, Pollio&#x27;s daughter was chosen only because Agrippa had been recently divorced. The (Tiberius) &quot;consoled&quot; the failed candidate with a dowry of 1 million sesterces.
The chief Vestal ( or , &quot;greatest of the Vestals&quot;) oversaw the work and morals of the Vestals and was a member of the College of Pontiffs. The chief Vestal was probably the most influential and independent of Rome&#x27;s high priestesses, committed to maintaining several different cults, maintaining personal connections to her birth family, and cultivating the society of her equals among the Roman elite. The Occia presided over the Vestals for 57 years, according to Tacitus. The and the also held unique responsibility for certain religious rites, but each held office by virtue of their standing as the spouse of a male priest.

=== Duties and festivals ===

Vestal tasks included the maintenance of their chastity, tending Vesta&#x27;s sacred fire, guarding her sacred (store-room) and its contents; collecting ritually pure water from a sacred spring; preparing substances used in public rites, presiding at the Vestalia and attending other festivals. Vesta&#x27;s temple was essentially the temple of all Rome and its citizens; it was open all day, by night it was closed but only to men. The Vestals regularly swept and cleansed Vesta&#x27;s shrine, functioning as surrogate housekeepers, in a religious sense, for all of Rome, and maintaining and controlling the connections between Rome&#x27;s public and private religion. So long as their bodies remained unpenetrated, the walls of Rome would remain intact. Their flesh belonged to Rome, and when they died, whatever the cause of their death, their bodies remained within the city&#x27;s boundary.

The Vestals acknowledged one of their number as senior authority, the , but all were ultimately under the authority of the , head of his priestly college. His influence and status grew during the Republican era, and the religious post became an important, lifetime adjunct to the political power of the annually elected consulship. When Augustus became , and thus supervisor of all religion, he donated his house to the Vestals. Their sacred fire became his household fire, and his domestic gods (Lares and Penates) became their responsibility. This arrangement between Vestals and Emperor persisted throughout the Imperial era.

The Vestals guarded various sacred objects kept in Vesta&#x27;s , including the Palladium – a statue of Pallas Athene which had supposedly been brought from Troy – and a large, presumably wooden phallus, used in fertility rites and at least one triumphal procession, perhaps slung beneath the triumphal general&#x27;s chariot.

==== Festivals ====
Vesta&#x27;s chief festival was the Vestalia, held in her temple from June 7 to June 15, and attended by matrons and bakers. Servius claims that during the Vestalia, the Lupercalia and on September 13, the three youngest Vestals reaped unripened (spelt wheat, or possibly emmer wheat). The three senior Vestals parched the grain to make it edible, and mixed it with salt, to make the used by priests and priestesses to consecrate (dedicate to the gods) the animal victims offered in public sacrifices. The Vestals&#x27; activities thus provided a shared link to various public, and possibly some private cults.

The Fordicidia was a characteristically rustic, agricultural festival, in which a pregnant cow was sacrificed to the Earth-goddess Tellus, and its unborn calf was reduced to ashes by the senior Vestal. The ashes were mixed with various substances, most notably the dried blood of the previous year&#x27;s October horse, sacrificed to Mars. The mixture was called . During the Parilia festival, April 21, it was sprinkled on bonfires to purify shepherds and their flocks, and probably to ensure human and animal fertility in the Roman community. On May 1, Vestals officiated at Bona Dea&#x27;s public-private, women-only rites at her Aventine temple. They were also present, in some capacity, at the Bona Dea&#x27;s overnight, women-only December festival, hosted by the wife of Rome&#x27;s senior magistrate; the magistrate himself was supposed to stay elsewhere for the occasion. On May 15, Vestals and pontiffs collected ritual straw figures called Argei from stations along Rome&#x27;s city boundary and cast them into the Tiber, to purify the city.

===Privileges===
Vestals were lawfully – &quot;sovereign over themselves&quot;, answerable only to the . Unlike any other Roman women, they could make a will of their own volition, and dispose of their property without the sanction of a male guardian. They could give their property to women, something forbidden even to men, under Roman law. As they embodied the Roman state, Vestals could give evidence in trials without first taking the customary oath to the State. They had custody of important wills and state documents, which were presumably locked away in the . Their person was sacrosanct; anyone who assaulted a Vestal was (in effect) assaulting an embodiment of Rome and its gods, and could be killed with impunity. As no magistrate held power over the Vestals, the lictors of magistrates who encountered a Vestal had to lower their in deference.

The Vestals had unique, exclusive rights to use a , an enclosed, two-wheeled, horse-drawn carriage; some Roman sources remark on its likeness to the chariots used by Roman generals in triumphs. Otherwise, the Vestals seem to have travelled in a one-seat, curtained litter, or possibly on foot. In every case, they were preceded by a lictor, who was empowered to enforce the Vestal&#x27;s right-of-way; anyone who passed beneath the litter, or otherwise interfered with its passage, could be lawfully killed on the spot.

Vestals could also free or pardon condemned persons &quot;en route&quot; to execution by touching them, or merely being seen by them, as long as the encounter had not been pre-arranged.

Vestals were permitted to see things forbidden to all other upper-class Roman women; from the time of Augustus on, they had reserved ring-side seating at public games, including gladiator contests, and stage-side seats at theatrical performances.

===Prosecutions and punishments===
If Vesta&#x27;s fire went out, Rome was no longer protected. Spontaneous extinction of the sacred flame for no apparent reason might be understood as a prodigy, a warning that the (&quot;peace of the gods&quot;) was disrupted by some undetected impropriety, unnatural phenomenon or religious offence. Romans had a duty to report any suspected prodigies to the Senate, who in turn consulted the , the and the to determine whether the matter must be tried or dismissed. Expiation of prodigies usually involved a special sacrifice () and the destruction of the &quot;unnatural&quot; object that had caused divine offence.

Extinction of Vesta&#x27;s sacred fire through Vestal negligence could be expiated by the scourging or beating of the offender, carried out &quot;in the dark and through a curtain to preserve their modesty&quot;. The sacred fire could then be relit, using the correct rituals and the purest materials. Loss of chastity, however, represented a broken oath. It was permanent, irreversible; no or expiation could restore it or compensate for its loss.

A Vestal who committed breached Rome&#x27;s contract with the gods; she became a contradiction, a visible religious embarrassment. By ancient tradition, she must die, but she must seem to do so willingly, and her blood could not be spilled. The city could not seem responsible for her death, and burial of the dead was anyway forbidden within the city&#x27;s ritual boundary, so she was immured alive in an underground chamber within the city&#x27;s ritual boundary () in the (&quot;Evil Field&quot;) near the Colline Gate. That Vesta did not intervene to save her former protege was taken as further divine confirmation of guilt.

 If discovered, the paramour of a guilty Vestal was publicly beaten to death by the , in the Forum Boarium or on the Comitium.

Trials for Vestal were &quot;extremely rare&quot;; most took place during military or religious crises. Some Vestals were probably used as scapegoats; their political alliances and alleged failure to observe oaths and duties were held to account for civil disturbances, wars, famines, plagues and other signs of divine displeasure. The end of the Roman monarchy and the beginnings of the Republic involved extreme social tensions between Rome and her neighbours, and competition for power and influence between Rome&#x27;s aristocrats and the commoner majority. In 483 BC, during a period of social conflict between patricians and plebeians, the Vestal Oppia, perhaps the earliest of several historic Vestals of plebeian family, was executed for merely on the basis of various portents, and allegations that she neglected her Vestal duties. In 337 BC, Minucia, another possible first plebeian Vestal, was tried, found guilty of unchastity and buried alive on the strength of her excessive and inappropriate love of dress, and the evidence of a slave.
In 123 BC the gift of an altar, shrine and couch to the Bona Dea&#x27;s Aventine temple by the Vestal Licinia &quot;without the people&#x27;s approval&quot; was refused by the Roman Senate. In 114 Licinia and two of her colleagues, Vestals Aemilia and Marcia, were accused of multiple acts of . The final accusations were justified by the death, in 114 BC, of Helvia, a virgin girl of equestrian family, killed by lightning while on horseback. The manner of her death was interpreted as a prodigy, proof of inchastity by the three accused. Aemilia, who had supposedly incited the two others to follow her example, was condemned outright and put to death. Marcia, who was accused of only one offence, and Licinia, who was accused of many, were at first acquitted by the pontifices, but were retried by Lucius Cassius Longinus Ravilla (consul 127), and condemned to death in 113. The prosecution offered two Sibylline prophecies in support of the final verdicts. Of the three Vestals executed for between the first Punic War (216) and the end of the Republic (113–111), each was followed by a nameless, bloodless form of human sacrifice seemingly reserved for times of extreme crisis, supposedly at the recommendation of the Sibylline Books; the living burial or immurement in the of a Greek man and woman, and a Gaulish man and woman, possibly to avert divine outrage at the ritual killing of the Vestal priestesses involved. According to Erdkamp, this may have also been intended to restore divine support for Rome&#x27;s success on the battlefield, evidenced by later successful auguries. The initial charges against the Vestals concerned were almost certainly trumped up, and may have been politically motivated.

Pliny the Younger believed that Cornelia, a buried alive on the orders of emperor Domitian, may have been an innocent victim. He describes how she sought to keep her dignity intact when she descended into the chamber:


Dionysius of Halicarnassus claims that long before Rome&#x27;s foundation, Vestals at ancient Alba Longa were whipped and &quot;put to death&quot; for breaking their vows of celibacy, and that their offspring were to be thrown into the river. According to Livy, Rhea Silvia, mother of Romulus and Remus, had been forced to become a Vestal Virgin, and was chained and imprisoned when she gave birth. Dionysius also writes that the Roman king Tarquinius Priscus instituted live burial as a punishment for Vestal unchastity, and inflicted it on the Vestal Pinaria; and that whipping with rods sometimes preceded the immuration, and that this was done to Urbinia in 471 BCE, in a time of pestilence and plebeian unrest.

Postumia, though innocent according to Livy, was suspected and tried for unchastity on grounds of her immodest attire and over-familiar manner. Some Vestals were acquitted. Some cleared themselves through ordeals or miraculous deeds; in a celebrated case during the mid-Republic, the Vestal Tuccia, accused of unchastity, carried water in a to prove her innocence; Livy&#x27;s epitomator (Per. 20) claims that she was condemned nevertheless but in all other sources she was acquitted. 

== House of the Vestals ==

The House of the Vestals was the residence of the vestal priestesses in Rome. Located behind the Temple of Vesta (which housed the sacred fire), the was a three-storey building at the foot of the Palatine Hill, &quot;very large and exceptionally magnificent both in decoration and material&quot;.

== Attire ==

Vestal costume had elements in common with high-status Roman bridal dress, and with the formal dress of high-status Roman matrons (married citizen-women). Vestals and matrons wore a long linen over a white woollen , a rectangular female citizen&#x27;s wrap, equivalent to the male citizen&#x27;s semi-circular toga. A Vestal&#x27;s hair was bound into a white, priestly (head-covering or fillet) with red and white ribbons, usually tied together behind the head and hanging loosely over the shoulders.

The red ribbons of the Vestal were said to represent Vesta&#x27;s fire; and the white, virginity, or sexual purity. The stola is associated with Roman citizen-matrons and Vestals, not with brides. This covering of the body by way of the gown and veils &quot;signals the prohibitions that governed [the Vestals&#x27;] sexuality&quot;. The communicates the message of &quot;hands off&quot; and asserts their virginity. The prescribed everyday hairstyle for Vestals, and for brides only on their wedding day, comprised six or seven braids; this was thought to date back to the most ancient of times. In 2013, Janet Stephens recreated the hairstyle of the vestals on a modern person.

High-status brides were veiled in the same saffron-yellow as the , priestess of Jupiter and wife to his high priest. Vestals wore a white, purple-bordered (veil) when travelling outdoors, performing public rites or offering sacrifices. Respectable matrons were also expected to wear veils in public. One who appeared in public without her veil could be thought to have repudiated her marriage, making herself &quot;available&quot;.

==Named Vestals==
From the institution of the Vestal priesthood to its abolition, an unknown number of Vestals held office. Some are named in Roman myth and history and some are of unknown date. The 1st-century BC author Varro, names the first four, probably legendary Vestals as Gegania, Veneneia, Canuleia, and Tarpeia. Varro and others also portray Tarpeia, daughter of Spurius Tarpeius in the Sabine-Roman war, as a treasonous Vestal Virgin. Most Vestals named in Roman historical accounts are presented as examples of wrongdoing, threats to the well-being of the state, and punishment. While Tarpeia&#x27;s status as a virgin is common to most accounts, her status as a vestal was likely the mythographer&#x27;s invention, to cast her lust, greed and treason in the worst possible light.

Dionysius of Halicarnasus names Orbinia, a Vestal put to death in 471. Livy names a Vestal Postumia, tried for inchastity in 420, but acquitted with a warning to take her position more seriously: Minucia was put to death for inchastity in 337: and Sextilia, put to death for adultery in 273. Some Vestals are said to have committed suicide when accused; Caparronia did so in 266: essential trial details are often lacking. Livy states that two Vestals, Floronia and Opimia, were convicted of unchastity in 216. One committed suicide, the other was buried alive - he does not say which.

Vestals could exploit their familial and social connections, as well as their unique, untouchable status and privileges, taking the role of patron and protector. Cicero describes how the Vestal Claudia, daughter of Appius Claudius Pulcher, walked beside her father in his triumphal procession, to repulse a tribune of the plebs, who wanted to veto the triumph. Cicero also records a Vestal Fonteia, present during the trial of her brother in 69. Fabia, admitted to the order in 80 and made chief Vestal around 50, was half-sister of Terentia (Cicero&#x27;s first wife), and full sister of Fabia the wife of Dolabella who later married her niece Tullia; she was probably mother of the later consul of that name. In 73 she was acquitted of with Lucius Sergius Catilina. The case was prosecuted by Cicero.

The 1st century Vestal Licinia was supposedly courted by her kinsman, the so-called &quot;triumvir&quot; Marcus Licinius Crassus – who in fact wanted her property. This relationship gave rise to rumours. Plutarch says: &quot;And yet when he was further on in years, he was accused of criminal intimacy with Licinia, one of the Vestal virgins and Licinia was formally prosecuted by a certain Plotius. Now Licinia was the owner of a pleasant villa in the suburbs which Crassus wished to get at a low price, and it was for this reason that he was forever hovering about the woman and paying his court to her until he fell under the abominable suspicion. And in a way, it was his avarice that absolved him from the charge of corrupting the Vestal, and he was acquitted by the judges. But he did not let Licinia go until he had acquired her property.&quot; Licinia became a Vestal in 85 and remained a Vestal until 61. The Vestals Arruntia, Perpennia M. f., and Popillia attended the inauguration of Lucius Cornelius Lentulus Niger as Flamen Martialis in 69. Licinia, Crassus&#x27; relative, was also present.
=== Imperial Vestals ===
* Junia Torquata (1st century), vestal under Tiberius, sister of Gaius Junius Silanus.
* Rubria (1st century), said by Suetonius to have been raped by Nero.
* Aquilia Severa (3rd century), whom Emperor Elagabalus married amid considerable scandal.
* Clodia Laeta (3rd century).
* Flavia Publicia (mid-3rd century).
* Coelia Concordia (4th century), the last head of the order.

===Outside Rome===
Inscriptions record the existence of Vestals in other locations than the centre of Rome.
* Manlia Severa, , a chief Alban Vestal at Bovillae whose brother was probably the L. Manlius Severus named as a in a funerary inscription. Mommsen thought he was of Rome, but this is not considered likely.
* Flavia (or Valeria) Vera, a , chief Vestal Virgin of the Alban (citadel).
* Caecilia Philete, a senior virgin () of Laurentum-Lavinium, as commemorated by her father, Q. Caecilius Papion. The title means at Lavinium the Vestals were only two.
* Saufeia Alexandria, .
* Cossinia L(ucii) f(iliae), a of Tibur (Tivoli).
* Primigenia, Alban vestal of Bovillae who had forsaken her vows of celibacy, mentioned by Symmachus in two of his letters.

==In Western art==
The Vestals were used as models of female virtue in allegorizing portraiture of the later West. Elizabeth I of England was portrayed holding a sieve to evoke Tuccia, the Vestal who proved her virtue by carrying water in a sieve. Tuccia herself had been a subject for artists such as Jacopo del Sellaio ( 1493) and Joannes Stradanus, and women who were arts patrons started having themselves painted as Vestals. In the libertine environment of 18th century France, portraits of women as Vestals seem intended as fantasies of virtue infused with ironic eroticism. Later, Vestals became an image of republican virtue, as in Jacques-Louis David&#x27;s &quot;The Vestal Virgin&quot;.

Excavations in Rome and Pompeii, as well as translation of Latin sources, made Vestals a popular subject for artists in the 18th century and the 19th century. The French painter Hector Leroux, who lived and worked in Italy for seventeen years, became famous for meticulously researched images of Vestals in all aspects of their daily life and worship, making some thirty paintings of Vestals between 1863 and 1899.

Procol Harum&#x27;s famous hit &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; (1967) contains the lyrics &quot;One of sixteen vestal virgins/ Who were leaving for the coast&quot;.

<text>A lock is a device used for raising and lowering boats, ships and other watercraft between stretches of water of different levels on river and canal waterways. The distinguishing feature of a lock is a fixed chamber in which the water level can be varied; whereas in a caisson lock, a boat lift, or on a canal inclined plane, it is the chamber itself (usually then called a caisson) that rises and falls.

Locks are used to make a river more easily navigable, or to allow a canal to cross land that is not level. Later canals used more and larger locks to allow a more direct route to be taken.

==Pound lock==
A &quot;pound lock&quot; is most commonly used on canals and rivers today. A pound lock has a chamber with gates at both ends that control the level of water in the pound. In contrast, an earlier design with a single gate was known as a flash lock.

Pound locks were first used in China during the Song dynasty (960–1279 CE), having been pioneered by the Song politician and naval engineer Qiao Weiyue in 984. They replaced earlier double slipways that had caused trouble and are mentioned by the Chinese polymath Shen Kuo (1031–1095) in his book &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot; (published in 1088), and fully described in the Chinese historical text &quot;Song Shi&quot; (compiled in 1345):

The distance between the two locks was rather more than 50 paces, and the whole space was covered with a great roof like a shed. The gates were &#x27;hanging gates&#x27;; when they were closed the water accumulated like a tide until the required level was reached, and then when the time came it was allowed to flow out.
The water level could differ by at each lock and in the Grand Canal the level was raised in this way by .

In medieval Europe a sort of pound lock was built in 1373 at Vreeswijk, Netherlands. This pound lock serviced many ships at once in a large basin. Yet the first true pound lock was built in 1396 at Damme near Bruges, Belgium. The Italian Bertola da Novate (c. 1410–1475) constructed 18 pound locks on the Naviglio di Bereguardo (part of the Milan canal system sponsored by Francesco Sforza) between 1452 and 1458.

In Ancient Egypt, the river-locks was probably part of the Canal of the Pharaohs: Ptolemy II is credited by some for being the first to solve the problem of keeping the Nile free of salt water when his engineers invented the lock around 274/273 BC.

==Basic construction and operation==
All pound locks have three elements:
* A watertight &quot;chamber&quot; connecting the upper and lower canals, and large enough to enclose one or more boats. The position of the chamber is fixed, but its water level can vary.
* A &quot;gate&quot; (often a pair of &quot;pointing&quot; half-gates) at each end of the chamber. A gate is opened to allow a boat to enter or leave the chamber; when closed, the gate is watertight.
* A set of &quot;lock gear&quot; to empty or fill the chamber as required. This is usually a simple valve (traditionally, a flat panel (paddle) lifted by manually winding a rack and pinion mechanism) which allows water to drain into or out of the chamber. Larger locks may use pumps.

The principle of operating a lock is simple. For instance, if a boat travelling downstream finds the lock already full of water:
* The entrance gates are opened and the boat moves in.
* The entrance gates are closed.
* A valve is opened, this lowers the boat by draining water from the chamber.
* The exit gates are opened and the boat moves out.

If the lock were empty, the boat would have had to wait 5 to 10 minutes while the lock was filled. For a boat travelling upstream, the process is reversed; the boat enters the empty lock, and then the chamber is filled by opening a valve that allows water to enter the chamber from the upper level. The whole operation will usually take between 10 and 20 minutes, depending on the size of the lock and whether the water in the lock was originally set at the boat&#x27;s level.

Boaters approaching a lock are usually pleased to meet another boat coming towards them, because this boat will have just exited the lock on their level and therefore set the lock in their favour – saving about 5 to 10 minutes. However, this is not true for staircase locks, where it is quicker for boats to go through in convoy, and it also uses less water.


==Details and terminology==
===Rise===
The &quot;rise&quot; is the change in water-level in the lock. The two deepest locks on the English canal system are Bath deep lock on the Kennet and Avon Canal and Tuel Lane Lock on the Rochdale Canal, which both have a rise of nearly . Both locks are amalgamations of two separate locks, which were combined when the canals were restored to accommodate changes in road crossings. By comparison, the Carrapatelo and Valeira locks on the Douro river in Portugal, which are long and wide, have maximum lifts of respectively. 

The two Ardnacrusha locks near Limerick on the Shannon navigation in Ireland have a rise of . The upper chamber rises and is connected to the lower chamber by a tunnel, which when descending does not become visible until the chamber is nearly empty.

===Pound===
A &quot;pound&quot; is the level stretch of water between two locks (also known as a &quot;reach&quot;).

===Cill===
The &quot;cill&quot;, also spelled &quot;sill&quot;, is a narrow horizontal ledge protruding a short way into the chamber from below the upper gates. Allowing the rear of the boat to &quot;hang&quot; on the cill is the main danger when descending a lock, and the position of the forward edge of the cill is usually marked on the lock side by a white line. The edge of the cill is usually curved, protruding less in the center than at the edges. In some locks, there is a piece of oak about thick which protects the solid part of the lock cill. On the Oxford Canal it is called a babbie; on the Grand Union Canal it is referred to as the cill bumper. Some canal operation authorities, primarily in the United States and Canada, call the ledge a &quot;miter sill&quot; (mitre sill in Canada).

===Gates ===
Gates are the watertight doors which seal off the chamber from the upper and lower pounds. Each end of the chamber is equipped with a gate, or pair of half-gates, traditionally made of oak or elm but now usually made of steel). The most common arrangement, usually called &quot;miter gates&quot;, was invented by Leonardo da Vinci sometime around the late 15th century.

===Paddle===
On the old Erie Canal, there was a danger of injury when operating the paddles: water, on reaching a certain position, would push the paddles with a force which could tear the windlass (or handle) out of one&#x27;s hands, or if one was standing in the wrong place, could knock one into the canal, leading to injuries and drownings.

=== Windlass (&quot;lock key&quot;) ===

On the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, the lockkeepers were required to remove the windlasses from all lock paddles at night, to prevent unauthorized use.

===Swell or swelling===
A &quot;swell&quot; was caused by opening suddenly the paddle valves in the lock gates, or when emptying a lock.
To help boats traveling downstream exit a lock, the locksman would sometimes open the paddles to create a swell, which would help &quot;flush&quot; the boat out of the lock. A boatsman might ask for a back swell, that is, to open and shut the paddles a few times to create some waves, to help him get off the bank where he was stuck. If boats ran aground (from being overloaded) they sometimes asked passing crews to tell the upstream lock to give them an extra heavy swell, which consisted of opening all the paddles on the lock gate, creating a surge that affected the whole pound below.

On the Erie Canal, some loaded boats needed a swell to get out of the lock. Particularly lumber boats, being top heavy, would list to one side and get stuck in the lock, and needed a swell to get them out. Some lockkeepers would give a swell to anyone to help them on the way, but some would ask for money for the swell.

The Erie Canal management did not like swelling for two reasons. First, it used too much water lowering the water on the pound above sometimes causing boats to run aground. In addition, it raised the water level on the pound below, causing some boats to strike bridges or get stuck.

===Snubbing posts===

On horse-drawn and mule-drawn canals, snubbing posts were used to slow or stop a boat in the lock. A 200-ton boat moving at a few miles an hour could destroy the lock gate. To prevent this, a rope was wound around the snubbing post as the boat entered the lock. Pulling on the rope slowed the boat, due to the friction of the rope against the post. A rope in diameter and about long was typically used on the Erie Canal to snub a boat in a lock.

One incident, which took place in June 1873 on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, involved the boat the &quot;Henry C. Flagg&quot; and its drunk captain. That boat was already leaking; the crew, having partially pumped the water out, entered Lock 74, moving in front of another boat. Because they failed to snub the boat, it crashed into and knocked out the downstream gates. The outrush of water from the lock caused the upstream gates to slam shut, breaking them also, and sending a cascade of water over the boat, sinking it. This suspended navigation on the canal for 48 hours until the lock gates could be replaced and the boat removed from the lock.

==Variations==
=== Composite locks===
To economise, especially where good stone would be prohibitively expensive or difficult to obtain, composite locks were made, i.e. they were constructed using rubble or inferior stone, dressing the inside walls of the lock with wood, so as not to abrade the boats. This was done, for instance, on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal with the locks near the Paw Paw Tunnel. and also the Chenango Canal

=== Powered operation===
On large modern canals, especially very large ones such as ship canals, the gates and paddles are too large to be hand operated, and are operated by hydraulic or electrical equipment. On the Caledonian Canal the lock gates were operated by man-powered capstans, one connected by chains to open the gate and another to draw it closed. By 1968 these had been replaced by hydraulic power acting through steel rams.

=== Fish ladders===
The construction of locks (or weirs and dams) on rivers obstructs the passage of fish. Some fish such as lampreys, trout and salmon go upstream to spawn. Measures such as a fish ladder are often taken to counteract this. Navigation locks have also potential to be operated as fishways to provide increased access for a range of biota.

==Special cases==
=== Doubled, paired or twinned locks ===

Locks can be built side by side on the same waterway. This is variously called &quot;doubling&quot;, &quot;pairing&quot;, or &quot;twinning&quot;. The Panama Canal has three sets of double locks. Doubling gives advantages in speed, avoiding hold-ups at busy times and increasing the chance of a boat finding a lock set in its favour. There can also be water savings: the locks may be of different sizes, so that a small boat does not need to empty a large lock; or each lock may be able to act as a side pond (water-saving basin) for the other. In this latter case, the word used is usually &quot;twinned&quot;: here indicating the possibility of saving water by synchronising the operation of the chambers so that some water from the emptying chamber helps to fill the other. This facility has long been withdrawn on the English canals, although the disused paddle gear can sometimes be seen, as at Hillmorton on the Oxford Canal. Elsewhere they are still in use; a pair of twinned locks was opened in 2014 on the Dortmund–Ems Canal near Münster, Germany.

The once-famous staircase at Lockport, New York, was also a doubled set of locks. Five twinned locks allowed east- and west-bound boats to climb or descend the Niagara Escarpment, a considerable engineering feat in the nineteenth century. While Lockport today has two large steel locks, half of the old twin stair acts as an emergency spillway and can still be seen, with the original lock gates having been restored in early 2016.

===Lock flights===

Loosely, a flight of locks is simply a series of locks in close-enough proximity to be identified as a single group. For many reasons, a flight of locks is preferable to the same number of locks spread more widely: crews are put ashore and picked up once, rather than multiple times; transition involves a concentrated burst of effort, rather than a continually interrupted journey; a lock keeper may be stationed to help crews through the flight quickly; and where water is in short supply, a single pump can recycle water to the top of the whole flight. The need for a flight may be determined purely by the lie of the land, but it is possible to group locks purposely into flights by using cuttings or embankments to &quot;postpone&quot; the height change. Examples: Caen Hill locks, Devizes.

&quot;Flight&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;Staircase&quot; (see below). A set of locks is only a staircase if successive lock chambers share a gate (i.e. do not have separate top and bottom gates with a pound between them). Most flights are not staircases, because each chamber is a separate lock (with its own upper and lower gates), there is a navigable pound (however short) between each pair of locks, and the locks are operated in the conventional way.

However, some flights include (or consist entirely of) staircases. On the Grand Union (Leicester) Canal, the Watford flight consists of a four-chamber staircase and three separate locks; and the Foxton flight consists entirely of two adjacent 5-chamber staircases.

===Staircase locks ===
Where a very steep gradient has to be climbed, a lock staircase is used. There are two types of staircase, &quot;real&quot; and &quot;apparent&quot;.

A &quot;real&quot; staircase can be thought of as a &quot;compressed&quot; flight, where the intermediate pounds have disappeared, and the upper gate of one lock is also the lower gate of the one above it. However, it is incorrect to use the terms &quot;staircase&quot; and &quot;flight&quot; interchangeably: because of the absence of intermediate pounds, operating a staircase is very different from operating a flight. It can be more useful to think of a staircase as a single lock with intermediate levels (the top gate is a normal top gate, and the intermediate gates are all as tall as the bottom gate). As there is no intermediate pound, a chamber can only be filled by emptying the one above, or emptied by filling the one below: thus the whole staircase has to be full of water (except for the bottom chamber) before a boat starts to ascend, or empty (except for the top chamber) before a boat starts to descend.

In an &quot;apparent&quot; staircase the chambers still have common gates, but the water does not pass directly from one chamber to the next, going instead via side ponds. This means it is not necessary to ensure that the flight is full or empty before starting.

Examples of famous &quot;real&quot; staircases in England are Bingley and Grindley Brook. Two-rise staircases are more common: Snakeholme Lock and Struncheon Hill Lock on the Driffield Navigation were converted to staircase locks after low water levels hindered navigation over the bottom cill at all but the higher tides – the new bottom chamber rises just far enough to get the boat over the original lock cill. In China, the recently completed Three Gorges Dam includes a double five-step staircase for large ships, and a ship lift for vessels of less than 3000 metric tons. Examples of &quot;apparent&quot; staircases are Foxton Locks and Watford Locks on the Leicester Branch of the Grand Union.
Operation of a staircase is more involved than a flight. Inexperienced boaters may find operating staircase locks difficult. Key concerns are either sending down more water than the lower chambers can cope with (flooding the towpath, or sending a wave along the canal) or completely emptying an intermediate chamber (although this shows that a staircase lock can be used as an emergency dry dock). To avoid these mishaps, it is usual to have the whole staircase empty before starting to descend, or full before starting to ascend, apart from the initial chamber.

One difference in using a staircase of either type (compared with a single lock, or a flight) is the optimal sequence for letting boats through. In a single lock (or a flight with room for boats to pass) boats should ideally alternate in direction. In a staircase, however, it is quicker for a boat to follow a previous one going in the same direction. Partly for this reason staircase locks such as Grindley Brook, Foxton, Watford and Bratch are supervised by lockkeepers, at least during the main cruising season, in which keepers try to alternate as many boats up, followed by down as there are chambers in the flight.

As with a flight, it is possible on a broad canal for more than one boat to be in a staircase at the same time, but managing this without waste of water requires expertise. On English canals, a staircase of more than two chambers is usually staffed: the lockkeepers at Bingley (looking after both the &quot;5-rise&quot; and the &quot;3-rise&quot;) ensure that there are no untoward events and that boats are moved through as speedily and efficiently as possible. Such expertise permits unusual feats, such as boats travelling in opposite directions can pass each other halfway up the staircase by moving sideways around each other; or at peak times, one can have all the chambers full simultaneously with boats travelling in the same direction.

===Stop locks===
When variable conditions meant that a higher water level in the new canal could not be guaranteed, then the older company would also build a stop lock (under its own control, with gates pointing towards its own canal) which could be closed when the new canal was low. This resulted in a sequential pair of locks, with gates pointing in opposite directions: one example was at Hall Green near Kidsgrove, where the southern terminus of the Macclesfield Canal joined the Hall Green Branch of the earlier Trent and Mersey Canal. The four gate stop lock near Kings Norton Junction, between the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal and the Worcester and Birmingham Canal was replaced in 1914 by a pair of guillotine lock gates which stopped the water flow regardless of which canal was higher. These gates have been permanently open since nationalisation.

===Round locks===

The best known example of a round lock is the Agde Round Lock on the Canal du Midi in France. This serves as a lock on the main line of the canal and allows access to the Hérault River.

A second French round lock can be found in the form of the now-disused Écluse des Lorraines, connecting the Canal latéral à la Loire with the River Allier.

===Drop locks===

A drop lock can consist of two conventional lock chambers leading to a sump pound, or a single long chamber incorporating the sump – although the term properly applies only to the second case. As the pounds at either end of the structure are at the same height, the lock can only be emptied either by allowing water to run to waste from the sump to a lower stream or drain, or (less wastefully) by pumping water back up to the canal. Particularly in the two-chamber type, there would be a need for a bypass culvert, to allow water to move along the interrupted pound and so supply locks further down the canal. In the case of the single-chamber type, this can be achieved by keeping the lock full and leaving the gates open while not in use.

While the concept has been suggested in a number of cases, the only example in the world of a drop lock that has actually been constructed is at Dalmuir on the Forth and Clyde Canal in Scotland. This lock, of the single-chamber type, was incorporated during the restoration of the canal, to allow the replacement of a swing bridge (on a busy A road) by a fixed bridge, and so answer criticisms that the restoration of the canal would cause frequent interruptions of the heavy road traffic. It can be emptied by pumping – but as this uses a lot of electricity the method used when water supplies are adequate is to drain the lock to a nearby burn.

===Very large locks===
In 2016 the Kieldrecht Lock in the Port of Antwerp in Belgium took over the title of the world&#x27;s largest lock from the Berendrecht Lock in the same port and still has the title for largest volume. In 2022 the IJmuiden sea lock serving the Port of Amsterdam became the world&#x27;s largest lock by surface area. The lock is long, wide and has sliding lock gates creating a usable depth of . 

The size of locks cannot be compared without considering the difference in water level that they are designed to operate under. For example, the Bollène lock on the River Rhône has a fall of at least , the Leerstetten, Eckersmühlen and Hilpoltstein locks on the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal have a fall of , each and the Oskemen Lock on the Irtysh River in Kazakhstan has a drop of .
==History and development==
===Pound lock===

The natural extension of the flash lock, or staunch, was to provide an upper gate (or pair of gates) to form an intermediate &quot;pound&quot; which was all that need be emptied when a boat passed through. This type of lock, called a pound lock was known in Imperial China and ancient Europe and was used by Greek engineers in the Canal of the Pharaohs under Ptolemy II (284 to 246 BC), when engineers solved the problem of overcoming the difference in height through canal locks.

Pound locks were first used in medieval China during the Song dynasty (960–1279 CE). The Songshi or History of the Song Dynasty, volume 307, biography 66, records how Qiao Weiyue, a high-ranking tax administrator, was frustrated at the frequent losses incurred when his grain barges were wrecked on the West River near Huai&#x27;an in Jiangsu. The soldiers at one double slipway, he discovered, had plotted with bandits to wreck heavy imperial barges so that they could steal the spilled grain. 

In 984 Qiao installed a pair of sluice-gates two hundred and fifty feet apart, the entire structure roofed over like a building. By siting two staunch gates so close to one another, Qiao had created a short stretch of canal, effectively a pound-lock, filled from the canal above by raising individual wooden baulks in the top gate and emptied into the canal below by lowering baulks in the top gate and raising ones in the lower.

===Turf-sided lock===
A turf-sided lock is an early form of canal lock design that uses earth banks to form the lock chamber, subsequently attracting grasses and other vegetation, instead of the now more familiar and widespread brick, stone, or concrete lock wall constructions. This early lock design was most often used on river navigations in the early 18th century before the advent of canals in Britain. The sides of the turf-lock are sloping so, when full, the lock is quite wide. Consequently, this type of lock needs more water to operate than vertical-sided brick- or stone-walled locks. On British canals and waterways most turf-sided locks have been subsequently rebuilt in brick or stone, and so only a few good examples survive, such as at Garston Lock, and Monkey Marsh Lock, on the Kennet and Avon Canal.

==Use of water==
===Water saving basins=== 
On English canals, these reservoirs are called &quot;side ponds&quot;. The Droitwich Canal, reopened in 2011, has a flight of three locks at Hanbury which all have operational side ponds.

==Alternatives==
===Inclined plane===
There are no working waterway inclined planes in the UK at the moment, but the remains of a famous one can be seen at Foxton in Leicestershire on the Leicester arm of the Grand Union Canal. The plane enabled wide-beam boats to bypass the flight of ten narrow locks, but failure to make improvements at the other end of the arm and high running costs led to its early demise. There are plans to restore it, and some funding has been obtained.

===Caisson lock===
Around 1800 the use of caisson locks was proposed by Robert Weldon for the Somerset Coal Canal in England. In this underwater lift, the chamber was long and deep and contained a completely enclosed wooden box big enough to take a barge. This box moved up and down in the deep pool of water. Apart from inevitable leakage, the water never left the chamber, and using the lock wasted no water. Instead, the boat entered the box and was sealed in by the door closing behind it, and the box itself was moved up or down through the water. When the box was at the bottom of the chamber, it was under almost of water – at a pressure of , in total. One of these &quot;locks&quot; was built and demonstrated to the Prince Regent (later George IV), but it had various engineering problems and the design was not put into use on the Coal Canal.

=== Hydro-pneumatic canal lift ===
Possibly inspired by Weldon&#x27;s caisson lock, William Congreve in 1813 patented a &quot;hydro-pneumatic double balance lock&quot; in which two adjacent locks containing pneumatic caissons could be raised and lowered in counterbalance by the movement of compressed air from one caisson to the other. In about 1817 the Regents Canal Company built one of these locks at the site of the present-day Camden Lock, north London. Here the motivation was, again, water supply problems. The company insisted on various modifications to Congreve&#x27;s design; the resulting installation proved to be unsatisfactory, and was soon replaced by conventional locks.

===Shaft lock===

Looking superficially similar to the caisson lock is the shaft lock. Shaft locks consist of a deep shaft with conventional upper gates. The lower gates are reached through a short tunnel. The gates only close off this approach tunnel so do not have to reach the full height of the lock. Notable examples have been built at Saint Denis (Paris, France), Horin (near Melnik, Czech Republic) and Anderten (Hannover Germany). 

The shaft lock at Minden has a fall of and has eight tanks linked in pairs to the lock chamber. As the lock is emptied water is run into each chamber in turn, for filling the water is released from the chambers thus saving the waste of a complete lockfull of water. An earlier attempt at a shaft lock had been made at Trollhättan in Sweden on the line of the present Göta canal. The fall would have been , astonishing in 1749. However the approach tunnel proved to be unusable in times of flood and the shaft lock was replaced by a 2-rise staircase in 1768.

===Diagonal lock===
This is similar to a shaft lock, but having the shaft built on an incline. Boats are moored to floating bollards which guide them along the shaft as it fills or empties. The &quot;Diagonal Lock Advisory Group&quot; has identified several sites in Britain where the new design could be installed, either on new waterways or canals under restoration. Projects under consideration include the restoration of the Lancaster Canal to Kendal and the proposed new branch of the Grand Union Canal between Bedford and Milton Keynes.

<doc id="165586" wikidata="Q598261" url="?curid=165586" title="Battle of Tricamarum">
<text>The Battle of Tricamarum took place on December 15, 533 between the armies of the Byzantine Empire, under Belisarius, and the Vandal Kingdom, commanded by King Gelimer, and his brother Tzazo. It followed the Byzantine victory at the Battle of Ad Decimum, and eliminated the power of the Vandals for good, completing the reconquest of North Africa under the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I. The main contemporary source for the battle is Procopius, &quot;De Bello Vandalico&quot;, which occupies Books III and IV of his magisterial &quot;Wars of Justinian&quot;.

==Prelude==
After the great Byzantine victory at the Battle of Ad Decimum, Belisarius and his army captured Carthage. Vandal king Gelimer set up at Bulla Regia in Numidia, about to the west of Carthage (at what is now the western border of modern Tunisia). He knew that in his current state he would not be able to face Belisarius&#x27;s forces, so he sent messengers to his brother Tzazon who was then campaigning in Sardinia. When he received the message, Tzazon set about returning to Africa to join Gelimer.

Meanwhile, Gelimer also attempted to divide the forces helping Belisarius. He offered rewards to the local Punic and Berber tribes for every Byzantine head they could bring, and sent agents to Carthage to attempt to have the Byzantine Hun mercenaries—vital to his success at Ad Decimum—betray him.

Tzazon and his army joined Gelimer early in December, at which point Gelimer felt his forces were strong enough to take the offensive. With the two brothers at the head of the army, the Vandal force paused on the way to Carthage to destroy the great aqueduct which supplied the city with most of its water.

Belisarius had fortified the city in the twelve weeks since Ad Decimum, but knew about Gelimer&#x27;s agents and could no longer trust the Huns in his forces. Instead of waiting for a possible treachery during a siege, he formed up his army and marched out with the cavalry at the front, the Byzantines in the center, and the Huns at the rear of the column.

==Battle==
The two forces met at Tricamarum, some west of Carthage, and the Byzantine cavalry immediately charged the Vandal lines, reforming and attacking two more times. The Byzantine infantry then furiously attacked the Vandal infantry, and the Byzantines gained the advantage. During the third Byzantine cavalry charge Tzazon was killed within sight of Gelimer. As had happened at Ad Decimum, Gelimer lost heart. The Vandal lines began to retreat, and soon were in rout. Gelimer fled back into Numidia with what remained of his army, having lost 800 men. Belisarius then marched on the city of Hippo Regius, which opened its gates to him.

==Aftermath==
Gelimer realized that his kingdom was lost, and attempted to flee to Spain, where some Vandals still remained, not having followed the main forces when they crossed into North Africa years earlier. However, the Byzantines heard of his plans and intercepted him. He was forced to abandon his belongings and take refuge in the mountains of Tunis with the Berbers. The next year he was found and surrounded by Roman forces led by Pharas the Herulian. At first he refused to surrender, even after promises of being allowed to rule. After a particularly nasty winter, he eventually gave up and surrendered to Belisarius. The Vandal Kingdom ended, and their provinces in Sardinia, Corsica, and the Balearic Islands came under the control of Justinian as Byzantine North Africa.

==Importance==
Paul K. Davis writes, &quot;With this victory, the Byzantines regained control of North Africa for the Eastern Roman Empire. This position became a springboard for the Byzantine invasion of Italy, and that invasion reincorporated, temporarily, the Eastern and Western Roman Empire.&quot;

<doc id="165590" wikidata="Q726761" url="?curid=165590" title="HTML editor">
<text>An HTML editor is a program used for editing HTML, the markup of a web page. Although the HTML markup in a web page can be controlled with any text editor, specialized HTML editors can offer convenience, added functionality, and organisation. For example, many HTML editors handle not only HTML, but also related technologies such as CSS, XML and JavaScript or ECMAScript. In some cases they also manage communication with remote web servers via FTP and WebDAV, and version control systems such as Subversion or Git. Many word processing, graphic design and page layout programs that are not dedicated to web design, such as Microsoft Word or Quark XPress, also have the ability to function as HTML editors.

==Types of editors==
There are two main varieties of HTML editors: text and WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editors.

===Text editors===
Text editors intended for use with HTML usually provide at least syntax highlighting. Some editors additionally feature templates, toolbars and keyboard shortcuts to quickly insert common HTML elements and structures. Wizards, tooltip prompts and autocompletion may help with common tasks.

Text editors commonly used for HTML typically include either built-in functions or integration with external tools for such tasks as version control, link-checking and validation, code cleanup and formatting, spell-checking, uploading by FTP or WebDAV, and structuring as a project. Some functions, such as link checking or validation may use online tools, requiring a network connection.

Text editors require user understanding of HTML and any other web technologies the designer wishes to use like CSS, JavaScript and server-side scripting languages.

To ease this requirement, some editors allow editing of the markup in more visually organized modes than simple color highlighting, but in modes not considered WYSIWYG. These editors typically include the option of using palette windows or dialog boxes to edit the text-based parameters of selected objects. These palettes allow editing parameters in individual fields, or inserting new tags by filling out an onscreen form, and may include additional widgets to present and select options when editing parameters (such as previewing an image or text styles) or an outline editor to expand and collapse HTML objects and properties.

===WYSIWYG HTML editors===
WYSIWYG HTML editors provide an editing interface which resembles how the page will be displayed in a web browser. Because using a WYSIWYG editor may not require any HTML knowledge, they are often easier for an inexperienced computer user to get started with.

The WYSIWYG view is achieved by embedding a layout engine. This may be custom-written or based upon one used in a web browser. The goal is that, at all times during editing, the rendered result should represent what will be seen later in a typical web browser.

WYSIWYM (what you see is what you &quot;mean&quot;) is an alternative paradigm to WYSIWYG editors. Instead of focusing on the format or presentation of the document, it preserves the intended meaning of each element. For example, page headers, sections, paragraphs, etc. are labeled as such in the editing program, and displayed appropriately in the browser.

====Difficulties in achieving WYSIWYG====
A given HTML document will have an inconsistent appearance on various platforms and computers for several reasons:

;Different browsers and applications will render the same markup differently.
:The same page may display slightly differently, by example, in Chrome, Safari, Edge, Internet Explorer and Firefox on a high-resolution screen, but it will look very different in the perfectly valid text-only Lynx browser. It needs to be rendered differently again on a PDA, an internet-enabled television and on a mobile phone. Usability in a speech or braille browser, or via a screen-reader working with a conventional browser, will place demands on entirely different aspects of the underlying HTML. All an author can do is suggest an appearance.
;Web browsers, like all computer software, have bugs
:They may not conform to current standards. It is hopeless to try to design Web pages around all of the common browsers&#x27; current bugs: each time a new version of each browser comes out, a significant proportion of the World Wide Web would need re-coding to suit the new bugs and the new fixes. It is generally considered much wiser to design to standards, staying away from &#x27;bleeding edge&#x27; features until they settle down, and then wait for the browser developers to catch up to your pages, rather than the other way round. For instance, no one can argue that CSS is still &#x27;cutting edge&#x27; as there is now widespread support available in common browsers for all the major features, even if many WYSIWYG and other editors have not yet entirely caught up.
;A single visual style can represent multiple semantic meanings
:Semantic meaning, derived from the underlying structure of the HTML document, is important for search engines and also for various accessibility tools. On paper we can tell from context and experience whether bold text represents a title, or emphasis, or something else. But it is very difficult to convey this distinction in a WYSIWYG editor. Simply making a piece of text bold in a WYSIWYG editor is not sufficient to tell the reader *why* the text is bold – what the boldness represents semantically.
;Modern web sites are rarely constructed in a way that makes WYSIWYG useful
:Modern web sites typically use a content management system or some other template processor-based means of constructing pages on the fly using content stored in a database. Individual pages are never stored in a filesystem as they may be designed and edited in a WYSIWYG editor, thus some form of abstracted template-based layout is inevitable, invalidating one of the main benefits of using a WYSIWYG editor.

==Valid HTML markup==
HTML is a structured markup language. There are certain rules on how HTML must be written if it is to conform to W3C standards for the World Wide Web. Following these rules means that web sites are accessible on all types and makes of computer, to able-bodied and people with disabilities, and also on wireless devices like mobile phones and PDAs, with their limited bandwidths and screen sizes. However, most HTML documents on the web do not meet the requirements of W3C standards. In a study conducted in 2011 on the 350 most popular web sites (selected by the Alexa index), 94 percent of websites fail the web standards markup and style sheet validation tests, or apply character encoding improperly. Even those syntactically correct documents may be inefficient due to an unnecessary use of repetition, or based upon rules that have been deprecated for some years.
Current W3C recommendations on the use of CSS with HTML were first formalised by W3C in 1996 and have been revised and refined since then.

These guidelines emphasise the separation of content (HTML or XHTML) from style (CSS). This has the benefit of delivering the style information once for a whole site, not repeated in each page, let alone in each HTML element. WYSIWYG editor designers have been struggling ever since with how best to present these concepts to their users without confusing them by exposing the underlying reality. Modern WYSIWYG editors all succeed in this to some extent, but none of them has succeeded entirely.

However a web page was created or edited, WYSIWYG or by hand, in order to be successful among the greatest possible number of readers and viewers, as well as to maintain the &#x27;worldwide&#x27; value of the Web itself, first and foremost it should consist of valid markup and code. It should not be considered ready for the World Wide Web, until its HTML and CSS syntax have been successfully validated using either the free W3C validator services (W3C HTML Validator and W3C CSS Validator) or some other trustworthy alternatives.

Accessibility of web pages by those with physical, eyesight or other disabilities is not only a good idea considering the ubiquity and importance of the web in modern society, but is also mandated by law. In the U.S., the Americans with Disabilities Act and in the UK, the Disability Discrimination Act place requirement on web sites operated by publicly funded organizations. In many other countries similar laws either already exist or soon will. Making pages accessible is more complex than just making them valid; that is a prerequisite but there are many other factors to be considered. Good web design, whether done using a WYSIWYG tool or not needs to take account of these too.

Whatever software tools are used to design, create and maintain web pages, the quality of the underlying HTML is dependent on the skill of the person who works on the page. Some knowledge of HTML, CSS and other scripting languages as well as a familiarity with the current W3C recommendations in these areas will help any designer produce better web pages, with a WYSIWYG HTML editor and without.

<text>Mustangs of Las Colinas is a bronze sculpture by Robert Glen that decorates Williams Square in Las Colinas in Irving, Texas. It portrays a group of nine wild mustangs at times life size running through a watercourse. Fountains give the effect of water splashed by the animals&#x27; hooves. The work was commissioned in 1976 and installed in 1984.

&quot;Mustangs of Las Colinas&quot; Museum is located adjacent to the sculpture, in the east building of The Towers at Williams Square. The museum has exhibits and a film about the work&#x27;s creation as well as additional sculptures by Robert Glen.

Williams Square is accessible from the DART Orange Line’s stops at Las Colinas Urban Center station and Irving Convention Center station.

==Description==
The sculpture commemorates the wild mustangs that were historically important inhabitants of much of Texas. The horses are intended to represent the drive, initiative and unfettered lifestyle that were fundamental to the state in its pioneer days.

SWA Group&#x27;s design created a shallow watercourse extending from northeast to southwest across Williams Square, a gently sloping granite-paved open space about square. The plaza setting for the sculpture won a National Honor Award from the American Society of Landscape Architects.

The buildings around the square rise (26 floors) on the north and (14 floors) on the east and west sides, with the south side open to O&#x27;Connor Boulevard. The sculpture is substantial, but the scale of the surrounding structures keeps it from dominating the space.

<text>Jean-Christophe Mitterrand (born 19 December 1946) is the son of former French president François Mitterrand. He was an advisor to his father on African affairs from 1986 to 1992, and earned the nickname &quot;Papamadit&quot; (which translates as &quot;Daddy-told-me&quot;) in Africa.

== Life and career ==
Mitterrand was born in Boulogne-Billancourt, Hauts-de-Seine. He was a press correspondent for the Agence France Presse in 1975 in Mauritania. In 1986, he became his father&#x27;s advisor on African affairs. In this capacity, he was responsible for maintaining relations with African strongmen to maintain French influence in Africa; for instance, Jean-Christophe Mitterrand became a personal friend of Togolese dictator Gnassingbé Eyadéma.

=== Angolagate ===
In the 1990s, Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, along with Russian businessman Arcadi Gaydamak, was implicated in the Angolagate arms dealing scandal. He was indicted in 1993 by the French justice in this case, suspected of having used his influence to help Pierre Falcone sell Russian weapons to José Eduardo dos Santos&#x27;s government (Angola). On 22 December 2000, he was imprisoned in the Santé prison in Paris, on orders of the magistrate Philippe Courroye, on charges of &quot;complicity of arms traffic, &quot;trafic d&#x27;influence&quot; (influence peddling) and &quot;trafic d&#x27;influence aggravé&quot; (aggravated influence peddling).&quot; He was suspected of having received important sums of money in 1993 and 1994 for his role as an intermediary in this contract, and has recognized having received US$1.8 million (13 million Francs) from the Brenco on a Swiss bank account—although he denied any participation to an arms deal.

Jean-Christophe Mitterrand was freed three weeks later, on 11 January 2001, after his mother, Danielle Mitterrand, managed to post a bail 5 million francs (€762,000). However, he was indicted again on July 4, 2001, on charges of &quot;complicity of arms traffic&quot; by the magistrates Philippe Courroye and Isabelle Prévost-Desprez, following a complaint filed in January 2001 by the Socialist Minister of Defence Alain Richard.

Jean-Christophe Mitterrand was again indicted on 17 October 2001, for corruption by investigative judge Courroye, suspected of having received US$300,000 from the Brenco in payment of councils to Falcone. On the eve of this new indictment, Jean-Christophe Mitterrand filed a complaint against Judge Courroye accusing him of having made a &quot;false&quot; document in July 2000 (because Courroye had put the date of 3 July for an ordinance drafted on 5 July)—but this manoeuver did not stop the procedure.

On 13 January 2006, the Court of Appeal of Paris confirmed the initial sentence. On 27 October 2006, the Court of Cassation rejected Mitterrand&#x27;s appeal, and confirmed his 30-month prison sentence on probation, along with a €600,000 fine for tax evasion (&quot;fraude fiscale&quot;) because of €600,000 received from Falcone but not declared to the Fisc tax administration.

<text>Cornelius Vanderbilt (May 27, 1794 – January 4, 1877), nicknamed &quot;the Commodore&quot;, was an American business magnate who built his wealth in railroads and shipping. After working with his father&#x27;s business, Vanderbilt worked his way into leadership positions in the inland water trade and invested in the rapidly growing railroad industry, effectively transforming the geography of the United States.

As one of the richest Americans in history and wealthiest figures overall, Vanderbilt was the patriarch of the wealthy and influential Vanderbilt family. He provided the initial gift to found Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. For his monopoly on shipping and the railroads, facilitated by political manipulation, Vanderbilt is often described as a &quot;robber baron&quot;, including in what may be one of first uses of the term, in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1859.

==Ancestry==
Cornelius Vanderbilt&#x27;s great-great-great-grandfather, Jan Aertson or Aertszoon (&quot;Aert&#x27;s son&quot;), was a Dutch farmer from the village of De Bilt in Utrecht, Netherlands, who emigrated to New Amsterdam (later New York) as an indentured servant in 1650. The Dutch &quot;van der&quot; (&quot;of the&quot;) was eventually added to Aertson&#x27;s village name to create &quot;van der Bilt&quot; (&quot;of the Bilt&quot;). This was eventually condensed to Vanderbilt.
Anthony Janszoon van Salee was one of Cornelius Vanderbilt&#x27;s great-great-great-great-grandfathers.

==Early years==

Cornelius Vanderbilt was born in Staten Island, New York, on May 27, 1794, to Cornelius van Derbilt and Phebe Hand. He began working on his father&#x27;s ferry in New York Harbor as a boy, quitting school at the age of 11. At the age of 16, Vanderbilt decided to start his own ferry service. According to one version of events, he borrowed () from his mother to purchase a periauger (a shallow draft, two-masted sailing vessel), which he christened the &quot;Swiftsure.&quot; However, according to the first account of his life, published in 1853, the periauger belonged to his father and the younger Vanderbilt received half the profit. He began his business by ferrying freight and passengers on a ferry between Staten Island and Manhattan. Such was his energy and eagerness in his trade that other captains nearby took to calling him &quot;The Commodore&quot; in jest—a nickname that stuck with him all his life.

While many Vanderbilt family members had joined the Episcopal Church, Cornelius Vanderbilt remained a member of the Moravian Church to his death. Along with other members of the Vanderbilt family, he helped erect a local Moravian parish church in his city.

On December 19, 1813, at age 19 Vanderbilt married his first cousin, Sophia Johnson. They moved into a boarding house on Broad Street in Manhattan.

They had 13 children together: Phebe in 1814, Ethelinda in 1817, Eliza in 1819, William in 1821, Emily in 1823, Sophia in 1825, Maria in 1827, Frances in 1828, Cornelius Jeremiah in 1830, George in 1832 (who died in 1836), Mary in 1834, Catherine in 1836, and another son named George in 1839.

In addition to running his ferry, Vanderbilt bought his brother-in-law John De Forest&#x27;s schooner &quot;Charlotte&quot; and traded in food and merchandise in partnership with his father and others. But on November 24, 1817, a ferry entrepreneur named Thomas Gibbons asked Vanderbilt to captain his steamboat between New Jersey and New York. Although Vanderbilt kept his own businesses running, he became Gibbons&#x27;s business manager.

When Vanderbilt entered his new position, Gibbons was fighting against a steamboat monopoly in New York waters, which had been granted by the New York State Legislature to the politically influential patrician Robert Livingston and Robert Fulton, who had designed the steamboat. Though both Livingston and Fulton had died by the time Vanderbilt started working for Gibbons, the monopoly was held by Livingston&#x27;s heirs. They had granted a license to Aaron Ogden to run a ferry between New York and New Jersey. Gibbons launched his steamboat venture because of a personal dispute with Ogden, whom he hoped to drive into bankruptcy. To accomplish this, he undercut prices and also brought a landmark legal case—&quot;Gibbons v. Ogden&quot;—to the United States Supreme Court to overturn the monopoly.

Working for Gibbons, Vanderbilt learned to operate a large and complicated business. He moved with his family to New Brunswick, New Jersey, a stop on Gibbons&#x27; line between New York and Philadelphia. There his wife Sophia operated a very profitable inn, using the proceeds to feed, clothe and educate their children. Vanderbilt also proved a quick study in legal matters, representing Gibbons in meetings with lawyers. He also went to Washington, D.C., to hire Daniel Webster to argue the case before the Supreme Court. Vanderbilt appealed his own case against the monopoly to the Supreme Court, which was next on the docket after &quot;Gibbons v. Ogden&quot;. The Court never heard Vanderbilt&#x27;s case, because on March 2, 1824, it ruled in Gibbons&#x27; favor, saying that states had no power to interfere with interstate commerce. The case is still considered a landmark ruling. The protection of competitive interstate commerce is considered the basis for much of the prosperity which the United States has generated.

==Steamboat entrepreneur==

After Thomas Gibbons died in 1826, Vanderbilt worked for Gibbons&#x27; son William until 1829. Though he had always run his own businesses on the side, he now worked entirely for himself. Step by step, he started lines between New York and the surrounding region. First he took over Gibbons&#x27; ferry to New Jersey, then switched to western Long Island Sound. In 1831, he took over his brother Jacob&#x27;s line to Peekskill, New York, on the lower Hudson River. That year he faced opposition by a steamboat operated by Daniel Drew, who forced Vanderbilt to buy him out. Impressed, Vanderbilt became a secret partner with Drew for the next thirty years, so that the two men would have an incentive to avoid competing with each other.

On November 8, 1833, Vanderbilt was nearly killed in the Hightstown rail accident on the Camden and Amboy Railroad in New Jersey. Also on the train was president John Quincy Adams.
In 1834, Vanderbilt competed on the Hudson River against the Hudson River Steamboat Association, a steamboat monopoly between New York City and Albany. Using the name &quot;The People&#x27;s Line&quot;, he used the populist language associated with Democratic president Andrew Jackson to get popular support for his business. At the end of the year, the monopoly paid him a large amount to stop competing, and he switched his operations to Long Island Sound.

During the 1830s, textile mills were built in large numbers in New England as the United States developed its manufacturing base. Some of the first railroads in the United States were built from Boston to Long Island Sound, to connect with steamboats that ran to New York. By the end of the decade, Vanderbilt dominated the steamboat business on the Sound, and began to take over management of the connecting railroads. In the 1840s, he launched a campaign to take over the most attractive of these lines, the New York, Providence and Boston Railroad, popularly known as the Stonington. By cutting fares on competing lines, Vanderbilt drove down the Stonington stock price, and took over the presidency of the company in 1847. It was the first of the many railroads he would head.

During these years, Vanderbilt also operated many other businesses. He bought large amounts of real estate in Manhattan and Staten Island, and took over the Staten Island Ferry in 1838. It was in the 1830s when he was first referred to as &quot;commodore&quot;, then the highest rank in the United States Navy. A common nickname for important steamboat entrepreneurs, by the end of the 1840s it was applied only to Vanderbilt.

==Oceangoing steamship lines==

When the California gold rush began in 1849, Vanderbilt switched from regional steamboat lines to ocean-going steamships. Many of the migrants to California, and almost all of the gold returning to the East Coast, went by steamship to Panama, where mule trains and canoes provided transportation across the isthmus. (The Panama Railroad was soon built to provide a faster crossing.) Vanderbilt proposed a canal across Nicaragua, which was closer to the United States and was spanned most of the way across by Lake Nicaragua and the San Juan River. In the end, he could not attract enough investment to build the canal, but he did start a steamship line to Nicaragua, and founded the Accessory Transit Company to carry passengers across Nicaragua by steamboat on the lake and river, with a carriage road between the Pacific port of San Juan del Sur and Virgin Bay on Lake Nicaragua.

In 1852, a dispute with Joseph L. White, a partner in the Accessory Transit Company, led to a business battle in which Vanderbilt forced the company to buy his ships for an inflated price. In early 1853, he took his family on a grand tour of Europe in his steamship yacht, the &quot;North Star.&quot; While he was away, White conspired with Charles Morgan, Vanderbilt&#x27;s erstwhile ally, to betray him, and deny him money he was owed by the Accessory Transit Company. When Vanderbilt returned from Europe, he retaliated by developing a rival steamship line to California, cutting prices until he forced Morgan and White to pay him off.

He then turned to transatlantic steamship lines, running in opposition to the heavily subsidized Collins Line, headed by Edward K. Collins. Vanderbilt eventually drove the Collins Line into extinction. During the 1850s, Vanderbilt also bought control of a major shipyard and the Allaire Iron Works, a leading manufacturer of marine steam engines, in Manhattan.

In November 1855, Vanderbilt began to buy control of Accessory Transit once again. That same year, the American military adventurer, William Walker, led an expedition to Nicaragua and briefly took control of the government. Edmund Randolph, a close friend of Walker, coerced the Accessory Transit&#x27;s San Francisco agent, Cornelius K. Garrison, into opposing Vanderbilt. Randolph convinced Walker to annul the charter of the Accessory Transit Company, and give the transit rights and company steamboats to him; Randolph sold these to Garrison. Garrison brought Charles Morgan in New York into the plan. Vanderbilt took control of the company just before these developments were announced. When he tried to convince the U.S. and English governments to help restore the company to its rights and property, they refused. So he negotiated with Costa Rica, which (along with the other Central American republics) had declared war on Walker. Vanderbilt sent a man to Costa Rica who led a raid that captured the steamboats on the San Juan River, cutting Walker off from his reinforcements from insurgent groups in the United States. Walker was forced to give up, and was driven out of the country by a U.S. Navy officer. But the new Nicaraguan government refused to allow Vanderbilt to restart the transit business, so he started a line by way of Panama, eventually developing a monopoly on the California steamship business.

==American Civil War==
When the Civil War began in 1861, Vanderbilt attempted to donate his largest steamship, the &quot;Vanderbilt,&quot; to the Union Navy. Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles refused it, thinking its operation and maintenance too expensive for what he expected to be a short war. Vanderbilt had little choice but to lease it to the War Department, at prices set by ship brokers. When the Confederate ironclad &quot;Virginia&quot; (popularly known in the North as the &quot;Merrimack&quot;) wrought havoc with the Union blockading squadron at Hampton Roads, Virginia, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton and President Abraham Lincoln called on Vanderbilt for help. This time he succeeded in donating the &quot;Vanderbilt&quot; to the Union Navy, equipping it with a ram and staffing it with handpicked officers. It helped bottle up the &quot;Virginia,&quot; after which Vanderbilt converted it into a cruiser to hunt for the Confederate commerce raider &quot;Alabama&quot;, captained by Raphael Semmes. For donating the &quot;Vanderbilt,&quot; he was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal. Vanderbilt also paid to outfit a major expedition to New Orleans. He suffered a grievous loss when George Washington Vanderbilt II, his youngest and favorite son, and heir apparent, a graduate of the United States Military Academy, fell ill and died without ever seeing combat.

==Railroad empire==
===New York and Harlem Railroad===
Though Vanderbilt had relinquished his presidency of the Stonington Railroad during the California gold rush, he took an interest in several railroads during the 1850s, serving on the boards of directors of the Erie Railway, the Central Railroad of New Jersey, the Hartford and New Haven, and the New York and Harlem (popularly known as the Harlem). In 1863, Vanderbilt took control of the Harlem in a famous stockmarket corner, and was elected its president. He later explained that he wanted to show that he could take this railroad, which was generally considered worthless, and make it valuable. It had a key advantage: it was the only steam railroad to enter the center of Manhattan, running down 4th Avenue (later Park Avenue) to a station on 26th Street, where it connected with a horse-drawn streetcar line. From Manhattan it ran up to Chatham Four Corners, New York, where it had a connection to the railroads running east and west.

Vanderbilt brought his eldest son, Billy, in as vice-president of the Harlem. Billy had had a nervous breakdown early in life, and his father had sent him to a farm on Staten Island. But he proved himself a good businessman, and eventually became the head of the Staten Island Railway. Though the Commodore had once scorned Billy, he was impressed by his son&#x27;s success. Eventually he promoted him to operational manager of all his railroad lines. In 1864, the Commodore sold his last ships, in order to concentrate on the railroads.

===New York Central and Hudson River Railroad===
Once in charge of the Harlem, Vanderbilt encountered conflicts with connecting lines. In each case, the strife ended in a battle that Vanderbilt won. He bought control of the Hudson River Railroad in 1864, the New York Central Railroad in 1867, and the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway in 1869. He later bought the Canada Southern as well. In 1870, he consolidated two of his key lines into the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, one of the first giant corporations in United States history.

===Grand Central Depot===

In 1869, Vanderbilt directed the Harlem to begin construction of the Grand Central Depot on 42nd Street in Manhattan. It was finished in 1871, and served as his lines&#x27; terminus in New York. He sank the tracks on 4th Avenue in a cut that later became a tunnel, and 4th Avenue became Park Avenue. The depot was replaced by Grand Central Terminal in 1913.

===Rivalry with Jay Gould and James Fisk===
In 1868, Vanderbilt fell into a dispute with Daniel Drew, who had become treasurer of the Erie Railway. To get revenge, he tried to corner Erie stock, which led to the so-called Erie War. This brought him into direct conflict with Jay Gould and financier James Fisk Jr., who had just joined Drew on the Erie board. They defeated the corner by issuing &quot;watered stock&quot; in defiance of state law, which restricted the number of shares a company could issue. But Gould bribed the legislature to legalize the new stock. Vanderbilt used the leverage of a lawsuit to recover his losses, but he and Gould became public enemies.

Gould never got the better of Vanderbilt in any other important business matter, but he often embarrassed Vanderbilt, who uncharacteristically lashed out at Gould in public. By contrast, Vanderbilt befriended his other foes after their fights ended, including Drew and Cornelius Garrison.

==Later years and philanthropy==

Following his wife Sophia&#x27;s death in 1868, Vanderbilt went to Canada. On August 21, 1869, in London, Ontario, he married a cousin from Mobile, Alabama, with the name — unusual for a woman — of Frank Armstrong Crawford.
Vanderbilt&#x27;s second wife convinced him to give ($ in dollars ), the largest charitable gift in American history to that date, to Bishop Holland Nimmons McTyeire, the husband of her cousin, Amelia Townsend, to found Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, named in his honor. He also paid $50,000 for a church for his second wife&#x27;s congregation, the Church of the Strangers. In addition, he donated to churches around New York, including a gift to the Moravian Church on Staten Island of for a cemetery (the Moravian Cemetery). He chose to be buried there.

==Death==
Cornelius Vanderbilt died on January 4, 1877, at his residence, No. 10 Washington Place, after being confined to his rooms for about eight months. The immediate cause of his death was exhaustion, brought on by long suffering from a complication of chronic disorders. At the time of his death, aged 82, Vanderbilt had an estimated worth of $105 million ($ in dollars).

In his will, he left 95% of his $105 million estate to his son William (Billy) and four grandsons through him. This left his only other living son, Cornelius Jeremiah Vanderbilt, and 9 daughters (Phebe Jane, Ethelinda, Eliza, Emily Almira, Sophia Johnson, Maria Louisa, Frances Lavinia, Mary Alicia, and Catherine Juliette), to receive comparatively little inheritance; far less than even their young nephews. Corneel, Ethelinda and Mary took the matter of their father&#x27;s will to court, claiming he was not in his right mind in his old age when he drew up the will; that he had been behaving strangely and was under William&#x27;s influence as well as that of a corrupt spiritualist in his employ, who&#x27;d allegedly been approached and paid off by William to do his bidding, according to eyewitness testimony. Allegedly, William paid the spiritualist (a Mr. Stoddard) to suggest the &quot;spirits&quot;—during a point in the session when said spiritualist would fall into a &quot;trance&quot; in the Commodore&#x27;s presence—claimed William would be the most trustworthy to inherit the estate and business and that his other children actually hated him and were just waiting for him to die. A &quot;spirit&quot;, during this session, came in the form of William&#x27;s deceased mother, Sophia. Not wanting to risk further public humiliation of the family name in court, William finally settled with his siblings. He gave Corneel an extra $200,000 in cash and a trust fund of $400,000. He gave Mary and Ethelinda the same settlement. Still, all told, this was comparatively very little from the—by far—largest estate in the world at that time.

William&#x27;s eldest son, Cornelius Vanderbilt II, received $5 million in the will, while his three younger sons—William Kissam Vanderbilt, Frederick William Vanderbilt, and George Washington Vanderbilt II—received $2 million apiece. Vanderbilt willed amounts ranging from $250,000 to $500,000 to each of his daughters. His wife received $500,000, their New York City home, and 2,000 shares of common stock in the New York Central Railroad. To his younger surviving son, Cornelius Jeremiah Vanderbilt, whom he regarded as a wastrel, he left the income from a $200,000 trust fund. (Although his daughters and Cornelius received bequests much smaller than those of their brother William, these made them very wealthy by the standards of 1877 and were not subject to inheritance tax.)

==Legacy==

Vanderbilt&#x27;s biographer T. J. Stiles says, &quot;He vastly improved and expanded the nation&#x27;s transportation infrastructure, contributing to a transformation of the very geography of the United States. He embraced new technologies and new forms of business organization, and used them to compete...He helped to create the corporate economy that would define the United States into the 21st century.&quot;

The Commodore had lived in relative modesty considering his nearly unlimited means, splurging only on race horses. His descendants were the ones who built the Vanderbilt houses that characterize the United States&#x27; Gilded Age.

According to &quot;The Wealthy 100&quot; by Michael Klepper and Robert Gunther, Vanderbilt would be worth $143 billion in 2007 United States dollars if his total wealth as a share of the nation&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) in 1877 (the year of his death) were taken and applied in that same proportion in 2007. This would make him the second-wealthiest person in United States history, after Standard Oil co-founder John Davison Rockefeller (1839–1937). Another calculation, from 1998, puts him in third place, after Andrew Carnegie. In real terms, however, Vanderbilt&#x27;s peak wealth of $105 million in 1877 is only worth US$ (in dollars).

In 1999, Cornelius Vanderbilt was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame, recognizing his significant contributions to the railroad industry. He was inducted in the &quot;Railway Workers &amp; Builders: North America&quot; category.

Statues of Cornelius Vanderbilt can be found at various locations, including Vanderbilt University and Grand Central Terminal. At Vanderbilt University, a statue of Cornelius Vanderbilt, designed by Giuseppe Moretti in 1897, stands near Kirkland Hall in commemoration of his gift to help found the university. Additionally, a statue of Cornelius Vanderbilt is located on the south side of Grand Central Terminal, facing the Park Avenue road viaduct to the south. The bronze statue was sculpted by Ernst Plassmann and was originally sited at the Hudson River Railroad depot at St. John&#x27;s Park before being moved to Grand Central Terminal in 1929.

==Descendants==

Cornelius Vanderbilt was buried in the family vault in the Moravian Cemetery at New Dorp on Staten Island. He was later reburied in a tomb in the same cemetery constructed by his son Billy. Three of his daughters and son, Cornelius Jeremiah Vanderbilt, contested the will on the grounds that their father was of unsound mind and under the influence of his son Billy and spiritualists whom he consulted on a regular basis. The court battle lasted more than a year and was ultimately won outright by Billy, who increased the bequests to his siblings and paid their legal fees.

One of Vanderbilt&#x27;s great-great-granddaughters, Gloria Vanderbilt, was a renowned fashion designer, and her youngest son, Anderson Cooper, is a television news anchor. Through Billy&#x27;s daughter Emily Thorn Vanderbilt, another descendant is actor Timothy Olyphant.

Cornelius Jeremiah Vanderbilt was childless when he committed suicide, in 1882, and George Washington Vanderbilt died during the Civil War, before having any children. All of the Vanderbilt multimillionaires descend through the oldest son Billy and his wife.

Cornelius&#x27; youngest grandson through William, George Washington Vanderbilt II, built the 250-room Biltmore Estate in the mountains of Asheville, North Carolina, as his main residence with part of his inheritance from his grandfather. It still retains the title of the largest privately owned home in the United States, though it is open to the public. The mansion contains of total floor space and originally sat on of land. It now sits on due to George&#x27;s final wishes that be sold to the government at —a significantly cut rate and what George had originally paid—in order to form the core of the Pisgah National Forest. George&#x27;s widow Edith Stuyvesant Vanderbilt Gerry also had to sell off additional land to pay for the estate&#x27;s upkeep.

<text>Walter Maynard Ferguson CM (May 4, 1928 – August 23, 2006) was a Canadian jazz trumpeter and bandleader. He came to prominence in Stan Kenton&#x27;s orchestra before forming his own big band in 1957. He was noted for his bands, which often served as stepping stones for up-and-coming talent, his versatility on several instruments, and his ability to play in a high register.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Ferguson was born in Verdun (now part of Montreal), Quebec, Canada. Encouraged by his parents, he started playing piano and violin at the age of four. At nine years old, he heard a cornet for the first time in his local church and asked his parents to buy one for him. When he was thirteen, he soloed with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Orchestra. He was heard frequently on the CBC, notably featured on a &quot;Serenade for Trumpet in Jazz&quot; written for him by Morris Davis. He won a scholarship to the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal where he studied from 1943 to 1948 with Bernard Baker.

Ferguson dropped out of the High School of Montreal when he was fifteen to pursue a music career, performing in dance bands led by Stan Wood, Roland David, and Johnny Holmes. Although trumpet was his primary instrument, he also performed on other brass and reed instruments. He took over the dance band formed by his saxophonist brother Percy, playing dates in the Montreal area and serving as an opening act for touring bands from Canada and the U.S. During this period, he came to the attention of American bandleaders and began receiving offers to go to the U.S.

In 1948, Ferguson moved to the United States, intending to join Stan Kenton&#x27;s band, but it no longer existed, so Ferguson played with the bands of Boyd Raeburn, Jimmy Dorsey, and Charlie Barnet. The Barnet band included Doc Severinsen, Ray Wetzel, Johnny Howell, and Rolf Ericson. Ferguson was featured on Barnet&#x27;s recording of &quot;All The Things You Are&quot; by Jerome Kern. The recording enraged Kern&#x27;s widow and was withdrawn from sale.

===Kenton and Hollywood===
In January 1950, Kenton formed the Innovations Orchestra, a 40-piece jazz orchestra with strings. After the folding of the Barnet band, Ferguson was available for the first rehearsal on January 1. One of the Orchestra&#x27;s recordings was named &quot;Maynard Ferguson,&quot; one of a series of pieces named after featured soloists. When Kenton returned to a more practical 19-piece jazz band, Ferguson continued with him at third chair with numerous solo features. Notable recordings from this period that feature Ferguson include &quot;Invention for Guitar and Trumpet&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s New?&quot;, and &quot;The Hot Canary&quot;.

In 1953, Ferguson left Kenton and spent the next three years as principal trumpet for Paramount Pictures. He appeared on 46 soundtracks, including &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;. He also played on several other non-Paramount film soundtracks, usually those with jazz scores. Ferguson can clearly be discerned on several soundtracks from the time, including the Martin and Lewis films &quot;Living It Up&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Never Too Young.&quot; He still recorded jazz, but his Paramount contract prevented him from playing in jazz clubs. This was sometimes circumvented by appearing under aliases such as &quot;Tiger Brown&quot; or &quot;Foxy Corby&quot;. Although he enjoyed the steady income, he was unhappy with the lack of live performance opportunities and left Paramount in 1956.

===The Birdland Dream Band===
Ferguson played with the Pérez Prado Orchestra on the LP &quot;Havana 3 A.M.&quot;, recorded in February and March 1956. In 1956, he joined the Birdland Dream Band, a 14-piece big band formed by Morris Levy as an &quot;all-star&quot; line-up, to play at Levy&#x27;s Birdland jazz club in New York City. Although the name &quot;Birdland Dream Band&quot; was short-lived and is represented by only two albums over the course of a year, this band became the core of Ferguson&#x27;s performing band for the next nine years.

The band included Mike Abene, Jaki Byard, Bill Chase, Ronnie Cuber, Frankie Dunlop, Don Ellis, Joe Farrell, Dusko Goykovich, Tony Inzalaco, Rufus Jones, Willie Maiden, Ron McClure, Rob McConnell, Don Menza, Lanny Morgan, Wayne Shorter, and Joe Zawinul. Those who were both arrangers and performers included Herb Geller, Slide Hampton, Bill Holman, and Don Sebesky.

In 1959, Ferguson was a guest with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of Leonard Bernstein, performing &quot;Symphony No. 2 in C &quot;Titans&quot;&quot; by William Russo.

In 1961, Ferguson composed the theme music for the 1961–1962 ABC adventure drama television series &quot;Straightaway&quot;. His 1961 album &quot;&quot;Straightaway&quot; Jazz Themes&quot; contained the music he composed for the series.

As big bands declined in popularity and economic viability in the 1960s, Ferguson&#x27;s band performed less frequently. He began to feel musically stifled and sensed a resistance to change among his American jazz audiences. According to an interview in &quot;DownBeat&quot;, he was quoted as saying that if the band did not play &quot;Maria&quot; or &quot;Ole,&quot; the fans went home disappointed. He began performing with a sextet before shutting down his big band in 1966.

===Millbrook, India, and psychedelics===
After leaving his long-time recording contract and the end of his main club gig, Ferguson moved his family to the Hitchcock Estate in Millbrook, New York in November 1963 to live with Timothy Leary, Ram Dass, and their community from Harvard University. He and his wife Flo used LSD, psilocybin and other psychedelic drugs. They lived at Millbrook for about three years, playing clubs and recording several albums. Ferguson was mentioned in &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot;, which detailed the psychedelic scene.

In 1967, as the Millbrook experiment was ending, Ferguson moved his family to India and taught at the Krishnamurti-based Rishi Valley School near Madras. He was associated with the Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning&#x27;s Boys Brass Band, which he founded and helped teach for several years. While in India, he was influenced by Sathya Sai Baba, whom he considered as his spiritual guru.

===England and jazz rock===
As a Canadian in England, Ferguson avoided the union&#x27;s ban on American musicians. In 1969, he moved to Oakley Green, a hamlet on the outskirts of Windsor, near London. He had two houses while he was in the UK, the final one a three-story house by the River Thames. That same year, Ferguson signed with CBS Records.

He started a sixteen- to eighteen-piece big band with British musicians playing jazz rock. The band got attention for its version of &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; by Jim Webb. Ferguson&#x27;s band made its North American debut in 1971.

In 1970 he led the band on &quot;The Simon Dee Show&quot; from London Weekend Television.

===Return to the U.S.===

Ferguson moved to New York City in 1973, then relocated to Ojai, California less than two years later. He replaced the British band members with American musicians while reducing membership to twelve: four trumpets, two trombones, three saxophones, and a three-piece rhythm section. Albums from this period include &quot;M.F. Horn 4&amp;5: Live At Jimmy&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Chameleon&quot;, recorded in 1973 and 1974 in New York. Ferguson took advantage of the burgeoning jazz education movement by hiring musicians from colleges with jazz programs, such as Berklee College of Music, North Texas State University and the University of Miami. He performed for young audiences and gave master classes in colleges and high schools. This strategy helped him develop an audience that sustained him for the rest of his career.

In 1975, Ferguson began working with Bob James on a series of commercially successful albums with large groups of session musicians, including strings, vocalists, and guest soloists. The first of these albums was &quot;Primal Scream&quot;, featuring Chick Corea, Mark Colby, Steve Gadd, and Bobby Militello. The second, &quot;Conquistador&quot; (1976) yielded a No. 22 pop single, &quot;Gonna Fly Now&quot; from the movie &quot;Rocky&quot;, earning him a gold album. He maintained a hectic touring schedule. The commercial success included adding a guitarist and an additional percussionist to his band&#x27;s line-up. In mid-1976, Ferguson performed a solo trumpet piece for the closing ceremonies of the Summer Olympics in Montreal, symbolically &quot;blowing out the flame&quot;.

Ferguson became frustrated with Columbia over the inability to use his working band on albums, and to play jazz songs on them. His contract with Columbia ended after the release of the album &quot;Hollywood&quot; (1982), produced by bassist Stanley Clarke. During that time, he recorded an instrumental version of the Michael Jackson song &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop &#x27;Til You Get Enough&quot;; the song would later be used by Rede Globo as the theme song of &quot;Vídeo Show&quot;, which ran on the network between 1983 and 2019.

Ferguson recorded three big band albums with smaller labels before forming High Voltage, a fusion septet, in 1986. This smaller ensemble, which featured multi-reed player Denis DiBlasio, gave Ferguson the freedom explore in a less structured format. High Voltage recorded two albums, produced by Jim Exon, his manager and son in law.

===Big Bop Nouveau===
To mark his 60th birthday in 1988, Maynard Ferguson returned to a large band format and to more mainstream jazz. That then led to the formation of Big Bop Nouveau, a nine-piece band featuring two trumpets, one trombone, three reeds and a three-piece rhythm section which became his standard touring group for the remainder of his career. Later, due to the increasing responsibilities being placed on the trumpet players, the baritone sax position was replaced by a third trumpet player. The band&#x27;s repertoire included original jazz compositions and modern arrangements of jazz standards, with occasional pieces from his 1970s book and even modified charts from the Birdland Dream Band era; this format proved to be successful with audiences and critics. The band recorded extensively, including albums backing vocalists Diane Schuur and Michael Feinstein.

Big Bop Nouveau toured the world extensively; in 2005 it embarked on a tour of eight months playing an average of two hundred shows a year. The group was tour managed by Memphis legend Ed Sargent, and mixed by audio mogul Mike Freeland. Although in later years Ferguson&#x27;s playing occasionally lost some of the range and phenomenal accuracy of his youth, he always remained an exciting performer, touring an average of nine months a year with Big Bop Nouveau for the remainder of his life. Ferguson died on August 23, 2006.

==Personal life==
In 1973, Ferguson settled in Ojai, California, where he lived to the end of his life. His first marriage was to singer Kay Brown. His marriage to Flo Ferguson (in 1956) lasted until her death on February 27, 2005. Ferguson had four daughters: Kim, Corby, Lisa, and Wilder and a son, Bentley, who predeceased his parents. Kim Ferguson managed Ferguson&#x27;s career for 15 years in the 1970s and 80s with husband and producer, Jim Exon. Wilder Ferguson is married to jazz pianist, film composer and former Big Bop Nouveau member Christian Jacob. Lisa Ferguson is a writer and film maker living in Los Angeles. At the time of his death, Ferguson had two granddaughters, Erica and Sandra.

Ferguson died as a result of kidney and liver failure, on August 23, 2006, at the Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura, California.

==Versatility==

Although his principal instrument was the trumpet, Ferguson frequently doubled on other brass instruments, most notably the relatively uncommon valve trombone. Several recording sessions with bandleader Russell Garcia included a four-trombone ensemble in which Ferguson played only valve trombone. Publicity shots and album covers from the 1950s showed Ferguson with his &#x27;quartet&#x27; of trumpet, valve trombone, baritone horn, and French horn. Recordings of the latter two are rare; the French horn vanished in later years, but the baritone horn appeared on the 1974 album &quot;Chameleon&quot;. He switched to the combination valve/slide Superbone and flugelhorn on all but his last recorded album.

Ferguson designed the Firebird and the Superbone. Trumpeter Rajesh Mehta bought this trumpet while living in Amsterdam and played the Firebird from 1998 until 2011 when he had American trumpet maker George Schlub create the Orka-M Naga Phoenix trumpet for him. The Superbone was another hybrid instrument, a trombone with additional valves played with the left hand. Ferguson incorporated Indian instruments and influences in his music.

Ferguson was not the first trumpeter to play in the extreme upper register (which had been employed by performers such as Cat Anderson), but he could play high notes with full, rich tone, power, and musicality. In interviews he said that his command of the upper registers was based mostly on breath control, something he discovered in his youth in Montreal. He attributed the longevity of his technique to the spiritual and yoga studies he pursued in India.

Ferguson brought charisma to a musical genre that is often seen as cold and cerebral. His obituary in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated:
Ferguson lit up thousands of young horn players, most of them boys, with pride and excitement. In a (high school) world often divided between jocks and band nerds, Ferguson crossed over, because he approached his music almost as an athletic event. On stage, he strained, sweated, heaved and roared. He nailed the upper registers like Shaq nailing a dunk or Lawrence Taylor nailing a running back – and the audience reaction was exactly the same: the guttural shout, the leap to their feet, the fists in the air. We cheered Maynard as a gladiator, a combat soldier, a prize fighter, a circus strongman – choose your masculine archetype.
==Awards and honors==
Ferguson was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada in 2003.

In 1950, 1951, and 1952, Ferguson won the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Readers&#x27; Poll for best trumpeter. In 1992, he was inducted into the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Jazz Hall of Fame.

Maynard Ferguson plays a special solo trumpet piece as part of the closing ceremonies for the Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada, the XXI Olympiad, 1976.

In 2000, Ferguson was initiated as a brother of Kappa Kappa Psi at the Gamma Xi Chapter (University of Maryland at College Park). In 2006, he was presented with Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity&#x27;s Charles E. Lutton Man of Music Award at its national convention in Cleveland, Ohio. He had been initiated as an honorary member of the Fraternity&#x27;s Xi Chi Chapter at Tennessee Tech University in 1976.

The &quot;Maynard Ferguson Institute of Jazz Studies&quot; at Rowan University was created in 2000, the same year Rowan bestowed Ferguson with his only Honorary Doctorate degree. The institute, under direction of Ferguson&#x27;s friend Denis Diblasio, supports the Rowan Jazz Program in training young jazz musicians.

In 2000, he was given an Honorary Doctorate Degree by Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey, and created the Maynard Ferguson Institute of Jazz Studies under the direction of Denis DiBlasio in their College of Performing Arts. The Sherman Jazz Museum in Sherman, Texas opened in 2010 and houses the extensive memorabilia of Ferguson&#x27;s estate.

Maynard Ferguson band alumni regrouped for a memorial concert soon after his death, led by trumpeters Wayne Bergeron, Patrick Hession, and Eric Miyashiro.

<text>Japanese literature throughout most of its history has been influenced by cultural contact with neighboring Asian literatures, most notably China and its literature. Early texts were often written in pure Classical Chinese or , a Chinese-Japanese creole language. Indian literature also had an influence through the spread of Buddhism in Japan.

During the Heian period, Japan&#x27;s original culture () developed and literature also established its own style, with the significant usage and development of to write Japanese literature.

Following the end of the policy and especially during the increasing westernization of the Meiji era, Western literature has also had an influence on the development of modern Japanese writers, while Japanese literature has in turn become more recognized internationally, leading to two Japanese Nobel laureates in literature, namely Yasunari Kawabata and Kenzaburō Ōe.

==History==
===Nara-period literature (before 794)===
Before the introduction of kanji from China to Japan, Japan had no writing system; it is believed that Chinese characters came to Japan at the very beginning of the 5th century, brought by immigrants from Korea and China. Early Japanese texts first followed the Chinese model, before gradually transitioning to a hybrid of Chinese characters used in Japanese syntactical formats, resulting in sentences written with Chinese characters but read phonetically in Japanese.

Chinese characters were also further adapted, creating what is known as , the earliest form of , or Japanese syllabic writing. The earliest literary works in Japan were created in the Nara period. These include the (712), a historical record that also chronicles ancient Japanese mythology and folk songs; the (720), a chronicle written in Chinese that is significantly more detailed than the ; and the (759), a poetry anthology. One of the stories they describe is the tale of Urashima Tarō.

===Heian literature (794–1185)===
The Heian period has been referred to as the golden era of art and literature in Japan. During this era, literature became centered on a cultural elite of nobility and monks. The imperial court particularly patronized the poets, most of whom were courtiers or ladies-in-waiting. Reflecting the aristocratic atmosphere, the poetry was elegant and sophisticated and expressed emotions in a rhetorical style. Editing the resulting anthologies of poetry soon became a national pastime. The poem, now one of two standard orderings for the Japanese syllabary, was also developed during the early Heian period.

, written in the early 11th century by female courtier Murasaki Shikibu, is considered the pre-eminent novel of Heian fiction. Other important writings of this period include the (905), a -poetry anthology, and . &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; was written by Sei Shōnagon, Murasaki Shikibu&#x27;s contemporary and rival, as an essay about the life, loves, and pastimes of nobles in the Emperor&#x27;s court. Another notable piece of fictional Japanese literature was , a collection of over a thousand stories in 31 volumes. The volumes cover various tales from India, China and Japan.

The 10th-century Japanese narrative, , can be considered an early example of proto-science fiction. The protagonist of the story, Kaguya-hime, is a princess from the Moon who is sent to Earth for safety during a celestial war, and is found and raised by a bamboo cutter. She is later taken back to her extraterrestrial family in an illustrated depiction of a disc-shaped flying object similar to a flying saucer.

===Kamakura-Muromachi period literature (1185–1603)===

During the Kamakura period (1185–1333), Japan experienced many civil wars which led to the development of a warrior class, and subsequent war tales, histories, and related stories. Work from this period is notable for its more somber tone compared to the works of previous eras, with themes of life and death, simple lifestyles, and redemption through killing. A representative work is , an epic account of the struggle between the Minamoto and Taira clans for control of Japan at the end of the 12th century. Other important tales of the period include Kamo no Chōmei&#x27;s (1212) and Yoshida Kenkō&#x27;s (1331).

Despite a decline in the importance of the imperial court, aristocratic literature remained the center of Japanese culture at the beginning of the Kamakura period. Many literary works were marked by a nostalgia for the Heian period. The Kamakura period also saw a renewed vitality of poetry, with a number of anthologies compiled, such as the compiled in the early 1200s. However, there were fewer notable works by female authors during this period, reflecting the lowered status of women.

As the importance of the imperial court continued to decline, a major feature of Muromachi literature (1333–1603) was the spread of cultural activity through all levels of society. Classical court literature, which had been the focal point of Japanese literature up until this point, gradually disappeared. New genres such as , or linked verse, and Noh theater developed among the common people, and such as the were created by Buddhist priests for preaching. The development of roads, along with a growing public interest in travel and pilgrimages, brought rise to the greater popularity of travel literature from the early 13th to 14th centuries. Notable examples of travel diaries include (1432) and (1480).

===Edo-period literature (1603–1868)===

Literature during this time was written during the largely peaceful Tokugawa shogunate (commonly referred to as the Edo period). Due in large part to the rise of the working and middle classes in the new capital of Edo (modern Tokyo), forms of popular drama developed which would later evolve into kabuki. The and kabuki dramatist Chikamatsu Monzaemon (1653–1725) became popular at the end of the 17th century, and he is also known as Japan&#x27;s Shakespeare.

Many different genres of literature made their debut during the Edo period, helped by a rising literacy rate among the growing population of townspeople, as well as the development of lending libraries. Ihara Saikaku (1642–1693) might be said to have given birth to the modern consciousness of the novel in Japan, mixing vernacular dialogue into his humorous and cautionary tales of the pleasure quarters, the so-called (&quot;floating world&quot;) genre. Ihara&#x27;s &quot;Life of an Amorous Man&quot; is considered the first work in this genre. Although Ihara&#x27;s works were not regarded as high literature at the time because it had been aimed towards and popularized by the (merchant classes), they became popular and were key to the development and spread of .

Matsuo Bashō (1644–1694) is recognized as the greatest master of haiku (then called ). His poems were influenced by his firsthand experience of the world around him, often encapsulating the feeling of a scene in a few simple elements. He made his life&#x27;s work the transformation of into a literary genre. For Bashō, involved a combination of comic playfulness and spiritual depth, ascetic practice, and involvement in human society. In particular, Bashō wrote , a major work in the form of a travel diary, considered &quot;one of the major texts of classical Japanese literature.&quot;

Fukuda Chiyo-ni (1703–1775) is widely regarded as one of the greatest haiku poets. Before her time, haiku by women were often dismissed and ignored. Her dedication toward her career not only paved a way for her career but it also opened a path for other women to follow. Her early poems were influenced by Matsuo Bashō, although she did later develop her own unique style as an independent figure in her own right. While still a teenager, she had already become very popular all over Japan for her poetry. Her poems, although mostly dealing with nature, work for unity of nature with humanity. Her own life was that of the poets who made their lives and the world they lived in one with themselves, living a simple and humble life. She was able to make connections by being observant and carefully studying the unique things around her ordinary world and writing them down.

 was an intellectual movement situated in Edo and centered on the study of Dutch (and by subsequently western) science and technology, history, philosophy, art, and language, based primarily on the Dutch books imported via Nagasaki. The polymath Hiraga Gennai (1728–1780) was a scholar of and a writer of popular fiction. Sugita Genpaku (1733–1817) was a Japanese scholar known for his translation of Kaitai Shinsho (New Book of Anatomy) from the Dutch-language anatomy book . As a full-blown translation from a Western language, it was the first of its kind in Japan. Although there was a minor Western influence trickling into the country from the Dutch settlement at Nagasaki, it was the importation of Chinese vernacular fiction that proved the greatest outside influence on the development of Early Modern Japanese fiction.

Jippensha Ikku (1765–1831) is known as Japan&#x27;s Mark Twain and wrote , which is a mix of travelogue and comedy. Tsuga Teisho, Takebe Ayatari, and Okajima Kanzan were instrumental in developing the , which were historical romances almost entirely in prose, influenced by Chinese vernacular novels such as and .

Two masterpieces were written by Ueda Akinari (1734–1809): and . Kyokutei Bakin (1767–1848) wrote the extremely popular fantasy/historical romance over a period of twenty-eight years to complete (1814–1842), in addition to other . Santō Kyōden wrote mostly set in the red-light districts until the Kansei edicts banned such works, and he turned to comedic . Genres included horror, crime stories, morality stories, comedy, and pornography — often accompanied by colorful woodcut prints.

Hokusai (1760–1849), perhaps Japan&#x27;s most famous woodblock print artist, also illustrated fiction as well as his famous 36 Views of Mount Fuji.

Nevertheless, in the Tokugawa period, as in earlier periods, scholarly work continued to be published in Chinese, which was the language of the learned much as Latin was in Europe.

===Meiji, Taishō, and early Shōwa-period literature (1868–1945)===

The Meiji period marked the re-opening of Japan to the West, ending over two centuries of national seclusion, and marking the beginning of a period of rapid industrialization. The introduction of European literature brought free verse into the poetic repertoire. It became widely used for longer works embodying new intellectual themes. Young Japanese prose writers and dramatists faced a suddenly-broadened horizon of new ideas and artistic schools, with novelists amongst some of the first to assimilate these concepts successfully into their writing.

Natsume Sōseki&#x27;s (1867–1916) humorous novel (&quot;I Am a Cat&quot;, 1905) employed a cat as the narrator, and he also wrote the famous novels (1906) and (1914). Natsume, Mori Ōgai, and Shiga Naoya, who was called &quot;god of the novel&quot; as the most prominent &quot;I novel&quot; writer, were instrumental in adopting and adapting Western literary conventions and techniques. Ryūnosuke Akutagawa is known especially for his historical short stories. Ozaki Kōyō, Kyōka Izumi, and Ichiyo Higuchi represent a strain of writers whose style hearkens back to early-Modern Japanese literature.

In the early Meiji period (1868–1880s), Fukuzawa Yukichi authored Enlightenment literature, while pre-modern popular books depicted the quickly changing country. Realism was brought in by Tsubouchi Shōyō and Futabatei Shimei in the mid-Meiji period (late 1880s–early 1890s) while the Classicism of Ozaki Kōyō, Yamada Bimyo and Kōda Rohan gained popularity. Ichiyō Higuchi, a rare female writer in this era, wrote short stories on powerless women of this age in a simple style in between literary and colloquial. Kyōka Izumi, a favored disciple of Ozaki, pursued a flowing and elegant style and wrote early novels such as &quot;The Operating Room&quot; (1895) in literary style and later ones including &quot;The Holy Man of Mount&quot; (1900) in colloquial language.

Romanticism was brought in by Mori Ōgai with his anthology of translated poems (1889) and carried to its height by Tōson Shimazaki, alongside magazines such as and in the early 1900s. Mori also wrote some modern novels including &quot;The Dancing Girl&quot; (1890), &quot;The Wild Geese&quot; (1911), then later wrote historical novels. Natsume Sōseki, who is often compared with Mori Ōgai, wrote &quot;I Am a Cat&quot; (1905) with humor and satire, then depicted fresh and pure youth in (1906) and (1908). He eventually pursued transcendence of human emotions and egoism in his later works including (1914) and his last and unfinished novel &quot;Light and darkness&quot; (1916).

Shimazaki shifted from Romanticism to Naturalism which was established with his &quot;The Broken Commandment&quot; (1906) and Katai Tayama&#x27;s &quot;Futon&quot; (1907). Naturalism hatched &quot;I Novel&quot; () that describes the authors themselves and depicts their own mental states. Neo-romanticism came out of anti-naturalism and was led by Kafū Nagai, Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki, Kōtarō Takamura, Hakushū Kitahara and others in the early 1910s. Saneatsu Mushanokōji, Naoya Shiga and others founded a magazine in 1910. They shared a common characteristic, Humanism. Shiga&#x27;s style was autobiographical and depicted states of his mind and sometimes classified as &quot;I Novel&quot; in this sense. Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, who was highly praised by Soseki, wrote short stories including (1915) with an intellectual and analytic attitude and represented Neo-realism in the mid-1910s.

During the 1920s and early 1930s the proletarian literary movement, comprising such writers as Takiji Kobayashi, Denji Kuroshima, Yuriko Miyamoto and Ineko Sata produced a politically radical literature depicting the harsh lives of workers, peasants, women, and other downtrodden members of society, and their struggles for change.

Pre-war Japan saw the debut of several authors best known for the beauty of their language and their tales of love and sensuality, notably Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki and Japan&#x27;s first winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, Yasunari Kawabata, a master of psychological fiction. Ashihei Hino wrote lyrical bestsellers glorifying the war, while Tatsuzō Ishikawa attempted to publish a disturbingly realistic account of the advance on Nanjing. Writers who opposed the war include Denji Kuroshima, Mitsuharu Kaneko, Hideo Oguma and Jun Ishikawa.

===Postwar literature (1945–onwards)===
World War II, and Japan&#x27;s defeat, deeply influenced Japanese literature. Many authors wrote stories of disaffection, loss of purpose, and the coping with defeat. Haruo Umezaki&#x27;s short story shows a disillusioned and skeptical Navy officer stationed in a base located on the Sakurajima volcanic island, close to Kagoshima, on the southern tip of Kyushu. Osamu Dazai&#x27;s novel &quot;The Setting Sun&quot; tells of a soldier returning from Manchukuo. Shōhei Ōoka won the Yomiuri Prize for his novel &quot;Fires on the Plain&quot; about a Japanese deserter going mad in the Philippine jungle. Yukio Mishima, well known for both his nihilistic writing and his controversial suicide by , began writing in the post-war period. Nobuo Kojima&#x27;s short story &quot;The American School&quot; portrays a group of Japanese teachers of English who, in the immediate aftermath of the war, deal with the American occupation in varying ways.

Prominent writers of the 1970s and 1980s were identified with intellectual and moral issues in their attempts to raise social and political consciousness. One of them, Kenzaburō Ōe, who published one of his best-known works, &quot;A Personal Matter&quot; in 1964, became Japan&#x27;s second winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature.

Mitsuharu Inoue had long been concerned with the atomic bomb and continued in the 1980s to write on problems of the nuclear age, while Shūsaku Endō depicted the religious dilemma of the , Roman Catholics in feudal Japan, as a springboard to address spiritual problems. Yasushi Inoue also turned to the past in masterful historical novels of Inner Asia and ancient Japan, in order to portray present human fate.

Avant-garde writers, such as Kōbō Abe, who wrote novels such as &quot;The Woman in the Dunes&quot; (1960), wanted to express the Japanese experience in modern terms without using either international styles or traditional conventions, developed new inner visions. Yoshikichi Furui related the lives of alienated urban dwellers coping with the minutiae of daily life, while the psychodramas within such daily life crises have been explored by a rising number of important women novelists. The 1988 Naoki Prize went to for &quot;Ripening Summer&quot;, a story capturing the complex psychology of modern women. Other award-winning stories at the end of the decade dealt with current issues of the elderly in hospitals, the recent past (Pure-Hearted Shopping District in Kōenji, Tokyo), and the life of a Meiji period ukiyo-e artist.

Haruki Murakami is one of the most popular and controversial of today&#x27;s Japanese authors. His genre-defying, humorous and surreal works have sparked fierce debates in Japan over whether they are true &quot;literature&quot; or simple pop-fiction: Kenzaburō Ōe has been one of his harshest critics. Some of Murakami&#x27;s best-known works include &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle&quot; (1994–1995).

Banana Yoshimoto, a best-selling contemporary author whose &quot;manga-esque&quot; style of writing sparked much controversy when she debuted in the late 1980s, has come to be recognized as a unique and talented author over the intervening years. Her writing style stresses dialogue over description, resembling the script of a manga, and her works focus on love, friendship, and loss. Her breakout work was 1988&#x27;s &quot;Kitchen&quot;.

Although modern Japanese writers covered a wide variety of subjects, one particularly Japanese approach stressed their subjects&#x27; inner lives, widening the earlier novel&#x27;s preoccupation with the narrator&#x27;s consciousness. In Japanese fiction, plot development and action have often been of secondary interest to emotional issues. In keeping with the general trend toward reaffirming national characteristics, many old themes re-emerged, and some authors turned consciously to the past. Strikingly, Buddhist attitudes about the importance of knowing oneself and the poignant impermanence of things formed an undercurrent to sharp social criticism of this material age. There was a growing emphasis on women&#x27;s roles, the Japanese persona in the modern world, and the malaise of common people lost in the complexities of urban culture.

Popular fiction, non-fiction, and children&#x27;s literature all flourished in urban Japan in the 1980s. Many popular works fell between &quot;pure literature&quot; and pulp novels, including all sorts of historical serials, information-packed docudramas, science fiction, mysteries, detective fiction, business stories, war journals, and animal stories. Non-fiction covered everything from crime to politics. Although factual journalism predominated, many of these works were interpretive, reflecting a high degree of individualism. Children&#x27;s works re-emerged in the 1950s, and the newer entrants into this field, many of the younger women, brought new vitality to it in the 1980s.

Manga — Japanese comics — have penetrated almost every sector of the popular market. They include virtually every field of human interest, such as multivolume high-school histories of Japan and, additionally for the adult market, a manga introduction to economics, and pornography (hentai). Manga represented between 20 and 30 percent of annual publications at the end of the 1980s, in sales of some ¥400 billion per year. Light novels, a Japanese type of young adult novel, often feature plots and illustrations similar to those seen in manga. Many manga are fan-made ().

Literature utilizing new media began to appear at the end of the 20th century. Visual novels, a type of interactive fiction, were produced for personal computers beginning in the 1980s. Cell phone novels appeared in the early 21st century. Written by and for cell phone users, the novels — typically romances read by young women — have become very popular both online and in print. Some, such as &quot;Love Sky&quot;, have sold millions of print copies, and at the end of 2007 cell phone novels comprised four of the top five fiction best sellers.

== Female authors ==
Female writers in Japan enjoyed a brief period of success during the Heian period, but were undermined following the decline in power of the Imperial Court in the 14th century. Later, in the Meiji era, earlier works written by women such as Murasaki Shikibu and Sei Shonagon were championed amongst the earliest examples of the Japanese literary language, even at a time when the authors themselves experienced challenges due to their gender. One Meiji-period writer, Shimizu Shikin, sought to encourage positive comparisons between her contemporaries and their female forebears in the hopes that female authors would be viewed with respect by society, despite assuming a public role outside the traditional confines of a woman&#x27;s role in her home (see Good Wife, Wise Mother). Other notable authors of the Meiji period included Hiratsuka Raicho, Higuchi Ichiyo, Tamura Toshiko, Nogami Yaeko and Yosano Akiko.

<text>The Battle of San Jacinto (), fought on April 21, 1836, in present-day La Porte and Deer Park, Texas, was the final and decisive battle of the Texas Revolution. Led by General Samuel Houston, the Texan Army engaged and defeated General Antonio López de Santa Anna&#x27;s Mexican army in a fight that lasted just 18 minutes. A detailed, first-hand account of the battle was written by General Houston from the headquarters of the Texan Army in San Jacinto on April 25, 1836. Numerous secondary analyses and interpretations have followed.

General Santa Anna, the president of Mexico, and General Martín Perfecto de Cos both escaped during the battle. Santa Anna was captured the next day on April 22 and Cos on April 24. After being held for about three weeks as a prisoner of war, Santa Anna signed the peace treaty that dictated that the Mexican army leave the region, paving the way for the Republic of Texas to become an independent country. These treaties did not necessarily recognize Texas as a sovereign nation but stipulated that Santa Anna was to lobby for such recognition in Mexico City. Sam Houston became a national celebrity, and the Texans&#x27; rallying cries from events of the war, &quot;Remember the Alamo&quot; and &quot;Remember Goliad&quot;, became etched into Texan history and legend.

==Background: December 1832 – March 1836==
===Mexican constitution overturned===
General Antonio López de Santa Anna was a proponent of governmental federalism when he helped oust Mexican President Anastasio Bustamante in December 1832. Upon his election as president in April 1833, Santa Anna switched his political ideology and began implementing centralist policies that increased the authoritarian powers of his office. His abrogation of the Constitution of 1824, correlating with his abolishing local-level authority over Mexico&#x27;s state of &quot;Coahuila y Tejas&quot; (Coahuila and Texas), became a flashpoint in the growing tensions between the central government and its Tejano and Anglo citizens in Texas. While in Mexico City awaiting a meeting with Santa Anna, Texian &quot;empresario&quot; Stephen F. Austin wrote to the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; (city council) of Béxar (now San Antonio) urging a break-away state. In response, the Mexican government kept him imprisoned for most of 1834.

Colonel Juan Almonte was appointed director of colonization in Texas, ostensibly to ease relations with the colonists and mitigate their anxieties about Austin&#x27;s imprisonment. He delivered promises of self-governance and conveyed regrets that the Mexican Congress deemed it constitutionally impossible for Texas to be a separate state. Behind the rhetoric, his covert mission was to identify the local power brokers, obstruct any plans for rebellion, and supply the Mexican government with data that would be of use in a military conflict. For nine months in 1834, under the guise of serving as a government liaison, Almonte traveled through Texas and compiled an all-encompassing intelligence report on the population and its environs, including an assessment of their resources and defense capabilities.

===Cos is appointed military governor of Texas===
In consolidating his power base, Santa Anna installed General Martín Perfecto de Cos as the governing military authority over Texas in 1835. Cos established headquarters in San Antonio on October 9, triggering what became known as the Siege of Béxar. After two months of trying to repel the Texian forces, Cos raised a white flag on December 9 and signed surrender terms two days later. The surrender of Cos effectively removed the occupying Mexican army from Texas. Many believed the war was over, and volunteers began returning home.

In compliance with orders from Santa Anna, Mexico&#x27;s Minister of War José María Tornel issued his December 30 &quot;Circular No. 5&quot;, often referred to as the Tornel Decree, aimed at dealing with United States intervention in the uprising in Texas. It declared that foreigners who entered Mexico for the purpose of joining the rebellion were to be treated as &quot;pirates&quot;, to be put to death if captured. In adding &quot;since they are not subjects of any nation at war with the republic nor do they militate under any recognized flag,&quot; Tornel avoided declaring war on the United States.

===Santa Anna takes the Alamo===
The Mexican Army of Operations numbered 6,019 soldiers and was spread out over on its march to Béxar. General Joaquín Ramírez y Sesma was put in command of the Vanguard of the Advance that crossed into Texas. Santa Anna and his aide-de-camp Almonte forded the Rio Grande at Guerrero, Coahuila on February 16, 1836, with General José de Urrea and 500 more troops following the next day at Matamoros. Béxar was captured on February 23, and when the assault commenced, attempts at negotiation for surrender were initiated from inside the fortress. William B. Travis, the garrison commander, sent Albert Martin to request a meeting with Almonte, who replied that he did not have the authority to speak for Santa Anna. Colonel James Bowie dispatched Green B. Jameson with a letter, translated into Spanish by Juan Seguín, requesting a meeting with Santa Anna, who immediately refused. Santa Anna did, however, extend an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress. Alamo non-combatant survivor Enrique Esparza said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer.

Cos, in violation of his surrender terms, forded into Texas at Guerrero on February 26 to join with the main army at Béxar. Urrea proceeded to secure the Gulf Coast and was victorious in two skirmishes with Texian detachments serving under Colonel James Fannin at Goliad. On February 27 a foraging detachment under Frank W. Johnson at San Patricio was attacked by Urrea. Sixteen were killed and twenty-one taken prisoner, but Johnson and four others escaped. Urrea sent a company in search of James Grant and Plácido Benavides who were leading a company of Anglos and Tejanos towards an invasion of Matamoros. The Mexicans ambushed a group of Texians, killing Grant and most of the company. Benavides and 4 others escaped, and 6 were taken prisoner.

The Convention of 1836 met at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 1. The following day, Sam Houston&#x27;s 42nd birthday, the 59 delegates signed the Texas Declaration of Independence and chose an ad interim government. When news of the declaration reached Goliad, Benavides informed Fannin that in spite of his opposition to Santa Anna, he was still loyal to Mexico and did not wish to help Texas break away. Fannin discharged him from his duties and sent him home. On March 4, Houston&#x27;s military authority was expanded to include &quot;the land forces of the Texian army both Regular, Volunteer, and Militia.&quot;

At 5 a.m. on March 6, the Mexican troops launched their final assault on the Alamo. After a vicious 90-minute battle, with immense losses to the Mexican forces, the guns fell silent; the Alamo had fallen. Survivors Susanna Dickinson, her daughter Angelina, Travis&#x27; slave Joe, and Almonte&#x27;s cook Ben were spared by Santa Anna and sent to Gonzales, where Texian volunteers had been assembling.

===Texian retreat: the Runaway Scrape===
The same day that Mexican troops departed Béxar, Houston arrived in Gonzales and informed the 374 volunteers (some without weapons) gathered there that Texas was now an independent republic. Just after on March 13, Susanna Dickinson and Joe brought news that the Alamo garrison had been defeated and the Mexican army was marching towards Texian settlements. A hastily convened council of war voted to evacuate the area and retreat. The evacuation commenced at midnight and happened so quickly that many Texian scouts were unaware the army had moved on. Everything that could not be carried was burned, and the army&#x27;s only two cannon were thrown into the Guadalupe River. When Ramírez y Sesma reached Gonzales the morning of March 14, he found the buildings still smoldering.

Most citizens fled on foot, many carrying their small children. A cavalry company led by Seguín and Salvador Flores were assigned as rear guard to evacuate the more isolated ranches and protect the civilians from attacks by Mexican troops or Indians. The further the army retreated, the more civilians joined the flight. For both armies and the civilians, the pace was slow; torrential rains had flooded the rivers and turned the roads into mud pits.

As news of the Alamo&#x27;s fall spread, volunteer ranks swelled, reaching about 1,400 men by March 19. Houston learned of Fannin&#x27;s surrender on March 20 and realized his army was the last hope for an independent Texas. Concerned that his ill-trained and ill-disciplined force would be good for only one battle, and aware that his men could easily be outflanked by Urrea&#x27;s forces, Houston continued to avoid engagement, to the immense displeasure of his troops. By March 28, the Texian army had retreated across the Navidad and Colorado Rivers. Many troops deserted; those who remained grumbled that their commander was a coward.

On March 31, Houston paused his men at Groce&#x27;s Landing on the Brazos River. Two companies that refused to retreat further were assigned to guard the crossing. For the next two weeks, the Texians rested, recovered from illness, and, for the first time, began practicing military drills. While there, two cannon, known as the Twin Sisters, arrived from Cincinnati, Ohio. Interim Secretary of War Thomas Rusk joined the camp, with orders from President David G. Burnet to replace Houston if he refused to fight. Houston quickly persuaded Rusk that his plans were sound. Secretary of State Samuel P. Carson advised Houston to continue retreating all the way to the Sabine River, where more volunteers would likely flock from the United States and allow the army to counterattack. Unhappy with everyone involved, Burnet wrote to Houston: &quot;The enemy are laughing you to scorn. You must fight them. You must retreat no further. The country expects you to fight. The salvation of the country depends on your doing so.&quot; Complaints within the camp became so strong that Houston posted notices that anyone attempting to usurp his position would be court-martialed and shot.

Santa Anna and a smaller force had remained in Béxar. After receiving word that acting President Miguel Barragán had died, Santa Anna seriously considered returning to Mexico City to solidify his position. Fear that Urrea&#x27;s victories would position him as a political rival convinced Santa Anna to remain in Texas to personally oversee the final phase of the campaign. He left on March 29 to join Ramírez y Sesma, leaving only a small force to hold Béxar. At dawn on April 7, their combined force marched into San Felipe and captured a Texian soldier, who informed Santa Anna that the Texians planned to retreat further if the Mexican army crossed the Brazos River. Unable to cross the Brazos because of the small company of Texians barricaded at the river crossing, on April 14 a frustrated Santa Anna led a force of about 700 troops to capture the interim Texas government. Government officials fled mere hours before Mexican troops arrived in Harrisburgh (now Harrisburg, Houston) and Santa Anna sent Almonte with 50 cavalry to intercept them in New Washington. Almonte arrived just as Burnet shoved off in a rowboat, bound for Galveston Island. Although the boat was still within range of their weapons, Almonte ordered his men to hold their fire so as not to endanger Burnet&#x27;s family.

At this point, Santa Anna believed the rebellion was in its final death throes. The Texian government had been forced off the mainland, with no way to communicate with its army, which had shown no interest in fighting. He determined to block the Texian army&#x27;s retreat and put a decisive end to the war. Almonte&#x27;s scouts incorrectly reported that Houston&#x27;s army was going to Lynchburg Crossing on Buffalo Bayou, in preparation for joining the government in Galveston, so Santa Anna ordered Harrisburgh burned and pressed on towards Lynchburg.

The Texian army had resumed their march eastward. On April 16, they came to a crossroads; one road led north towards Nacogdoches, the other went to Harrisburgh. Without orders from Houston and with no discussion amongst themselves, the troops in the lead took the road to Harrisburgh. They arrived on April 18, not long after the Mexican army&#x27;s departure. That same day, Deaf Smith and Henry Karnes captured a Mexican courier carrying intelligence on the locations and future plans of all of the Mexican troops in Texas. Realizing that Santa Anna had only a small force and was not far away, Houston gave a rousing speech to his men, exhorting them to &quot;Remember the Alamo&quot; and &quot;Remember Goliad&quot;. His army then raced towards Lynchburg. Out of concern that his men might not differentiate between Mexican soldiers and the &quot;Tejanos&quot; in Seguín&#x27;s company, Houston originally ordered Seguín and his men to remain in Harrisburgh to guard those who were too ill to travel quickly. After loud protests from Seguín and Antonio Menchaca, the order was rescinded, provided the &quot;Tejanos&quot; wear playing cards in their hats to identify them as Texian soldiers.

==Battle==

The area along Buffalo Bayou had many thick oak groves, separated by marshes. This type of terrain was familiar to the Texians and quite alien to the Mexican soldiers. Houston&#x27;s army, comprising around 800 men, reached Lynch&#x27;s Ferry mid-morning on April 20; Santa Anna&#x27;s 700-man force arrived a few hours later. The Texians made camp in a wooded area along the bank of Buffalo Bayou; while the location provided good cover and helped hide their full strength, it also left the Texians no room for retreat. Over the protests of several of his officers, Santa Anna chose to make camp in a vulnerable location, a plain near the San Jacinto River, bordered by woods on one side, marsh and lake on another. The two camps were approximately apart, separated by a grassy area with a slight rise in the middle. Colonel Pedro Delgado later wrote that &quot;the camping ground of His Excellency&#x27;s selection was in all respects, against military rules. Any youngster would have done better.&quot;

Over the next several hours, two brief skirmishes occurred. Using the Twin Sisters, Texians won the first, forcing a small group of dragoons and the Mexican artillery to withdraw. Mexican dragoons then forced the Texian cavalry to withdraw. In the melee, Rusk, on foot to reload his rifle, was almost captured by Mexican soldiers but was rescued by newly arrived Texian volunteer Mirabeau B. Lamar. Over Houston&#x27;s objections, many infantrymen rushed onto the field. As the Texian cavalry fell back, Lamar remained behind to rescue another Texian who had been thrown from his horse; Mexican officers &quot;reportedly applauded&quot; his bravery. Houston was irate that the infantry had disobeyed his orders and given Santa Anna a better estimate of their strength; the men were equally upset that Houston had not allowed a full battle.

Throughout the night, Mexican troops worked to fortify their camp, creating breastworks out of everything they could find, including saddles and brush. At on April 21, Cos arrived with 540 reinforcements, bringing the Mexican force to approximately 1,200–1,500 men which outnumbered the Texian aggregate forces of approximately 800 men (official count entering battle was reported at 783). General Cos&#x27; men were mostly raw recruits rather than experienced soldiers, and they had marched steadily for more than 24 hours with no rest and no food. As the morning wore on with no Texian attack, Mexican officers lowered their guard. By afternoon, Santa Anna had permitted Cos&#x27; men to sleep; his tired troops also took advantage of the time to rest, eat, and bathe.

Not long after Cos arrived with reinforcements, General Houston ordered Smith to destroy Vince&#x27;s Bridge (located about 8 miles from the Texian encampment) to block the only road out of the Brazos and, thereby, prevent any possibility of escape by Santa Anna. Houston describes how he arrayed the Texian forces in preparation of battle: &quot;Colonel Edward Burleson was assigned the center. The second regiment, under the command of Colonel Sydney Sherman (sic), formed the left-wing of the army. The artillery, under the special command of Col. Geo. W. Hackley, inspector general, was placed on the right of the first regiment, and four companies under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Henry Millard, sustained the artillery on the right, and our cavalry, sixty-one in number and commanded by Colonel Mirabeau B. Lamar...placed on our extreme right, composed our line.&quot; 
The Texian cavalry was first dispatched to the Mexican forces&#x27; far left, and the artillery advanced through the tall grass to within 200 yards of the Mexican breastworks. The Texian Twin Sisters fired at 4:30, beginning the battle. After a single volley, Texians broke ranks and swarmed over the Mexican breastworks, yelling &quot;Remember the Alamo! Remember La Bahia (Goliad)!&quot;, to engage in hand-to-hand combat. Mexican soldiers were taken by surprise. Santa Anna, Castrillón, and Almonte yelled often conflicting orders, attempting to organize their men into some form of defense. The Texian infantry forces advanced without halt until they had possession of the woodland and the Mexican breastwork; the right-wing of Burleson&#x27;s and the left-wing of Millard&#x27;s forces took possession of the breastwork. Within 18 minutes, Mexican soldiers abandoned their campsite and fled for their lives. The killing lasted for hours.

Many Mexican soldiers retreated through the marsh to Peggy Lake. Texian riflemen stationed themselves on the banks and shot at anything that moved. Many Texian officers, including Houston and Rusk, attempted to stop the slaughter, but they were unable to gain control of the men, incensed and vengeful for the massacres at the Alamo and Goliad, while frightened Mexican infantry yelled &quot;Me no Alamo!&quot; and begged for mercy to no avail. In what historian Davis calls &quot;one of the most one-sided victories in history&quot;, 650 Mexican soldiers were killed, 208 wounded, and 300 captured. Eleven Texians were killed and mortally wounded, with 30 others, including Houston, wounded.

Although Santa Anna&#x27;s troops had been thoroughly vanquished, they did not represent the bulk of the Mexican army in Texas. An additional 4,000 troops remained under the commands of Urrea and General Vicente Filisola. Texians had won the battle because of mistakes made by Santa Anna, and Houston was well aware that his troops would have little hope of repeating their victory against Urrea or Filisola. As darkness fell, a large group of prisoners was led into camp. Houston initially mistook the group for Mexican reinforcements and reportedly shouted out that all was lost.

===Mexican retreat===

Santa Anna had escaped towards Vince&#x27;s Bridge. Finding the bridge destroyed, he hid in the marsh and was captured the following day, wearing the uniform jacket of a private. This subterfuge was uncovered when other Mexican prisoners cried out in recognition of their commander. He was brought before Houston, who had been shot in the ankle and badly wounded. Texian soldiers gathered around, calling for the Mexican general&#x27;s immediate execution. Bargaining for his life, Santa Anna suggested that he order the remaining Mexican troops to stay away. In a letter to Filisola, who was now the senior Mexican official in Texas, Santa Anna wrote that &quot;yesterday evening [we] had an unfortunate encounter&quot; and ordered his troops to retreat to Béxar and await further instructions.

Urrea urged Filisola to continue the campaign. He was confident that he could challenge the Texian troops. According to Hardin, &quot;Santa Anna had presented Mexico with one military disaster; Filisola did not wish to risk another.&quot; Spring rains had ruined the ammunition and rendered the roads nearly impassable, with troops sinking to their knees in mud. The Mexican troops were soon out of food and began to fall ill from dysentery and other diseases. Their supply lines had broken down, leaving no hope of further reinforcements. Filisola later wrote &quot;Had the enemy met us under these cruel circumstances, on the only road that was left, no alternative remained but to die or surrender at discretion&quot;.

For several weeks after San Jacinto, Santa Anna continued to negotiate with Houston, Rusk, and then Burnet. Santa Anna suggested two treaties, a public version of promises made between the two countries, and a private version that included Santa Anna&#x27;s agreements. The Treaties of Velasco required that all Mexican troops withdraw south of the Rio Grande and that all private property be respected and restored. Prisoners of war would be released unharmed, and Santa Anna would be given immediate passage to Veracruz. He secretly promised to persuade the Mexican Congress to acknowledge the Republic of Texas and to recognize the Rio Grande as the border between the two countries.

When Urrea began marching south in mid-May, many families from San Patricio who had supported the Mexican army went with him. When Texian troops arrived in early June, they found only 20 families remaining. The area around San Patricio and Refugio suffered a &quot;noticeable depopulation&quot; in the Republic of Texas years. Although the treaty had specified that Urrea and Filisola would return any slaves their armies had sheltered, Urrea refused to comply. Many former slaves followed the army to Mexico, where they could be free. By late May, the Mexican troops had crossed the Nueces. Filisola fully expected that the defeat was temporary and that a second campaign would be launched to retake Texas.

When Mexican authorities received word of Santa Anna&#x27;s defeat at San Jacinto, flags across the country were lowered to half staff and draped in mourning. Denouncing any agreements signed by a prisoner, Mexican authorities refused to recognize the Republic of Texas. Filisola was derided for leading the retreat and was replaced by Urrea. Within months, Urrea gathered 6,000 troops in Matamoros, poised to reconquer Texas. His army was redirected to address continued federalist rebellions in other regions.

All the Mexican soldiers&#x27; bodies lay where they were killed for years or decades after the battle. Houston and Santa Anna both refused to order their soldiers to bury the dead so they lay on the property of Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; McCormick who owned the land where the battle took place. Houston refused to bury the bodies because the Mexicans cremated all of the executed fallen Texan soldiers at Goliad and the Alamo and Santa Anna for some unknown reason refused to order his soldiers, now prisoners of war, to bury their fallen comrades. McCormick asked Houston in-person to bury the now rotting Mexican corpses, but Houston simply responded that she should be honored that her property is now the site of the battle that won Texan independence. Her family buried a few of the corpses but hundreds of them were never located by them. Many years later the corpses, now skulls and skeletons, were buried in a large trench on the battlefield site but nobody knows to the present day where the mass burial site is located.

Most in Texas assumed the Mexican army would return quickly. Such a large number of American volunteers flocked to the Texian army in the months after the victory at San Jacinto that the Texian government was unable to maintain an accurate list of enlistments. Out of caution, Béxar remained under martial law throughout 1836. Rusk ordered that all &quot;Tejanos&quot; in the area between the Guadalupe and Nueces rivers migrate either to east Texas or to Mexico. Some residents who refused to comply were forcibly removed. New American settlers moved in and used threats and legal maneuvering to take over the land once owned by &quot;Tejanos&quot;. Over the next several years, hundreds of &quot;Tejano&quot; families resettled in Mexico.

For years, Mexican authorities used the reconquering of Texas as an excuse for implementing new taxes and making the army the budgetary priority of the impoverished nation. Only sporadic skirmishes resulted. Larger expeditions were postponed as military funding was consistently diverted to other rebellions, out of fear that those regions would ally with Texas and further fragment the country. The northern Mexican states, the focus of the Matamoros Expedition, briefly launched an independent Republic of the Rio Grande in 1839. The same year, the Mexican Congress considered a law to declare it treasonous to speak positively of Texas. In June 1843, leaders of the two nations declared an armistice.

===Republic of Texas===

On June 1, 1836, Santa Anna boarded a ship to travel back to Mexico. For the next two days, crowds of soldiers, many of whom had arrived that week from the United States, gathered to demand his execution. Lamar, recently promoted to secretary of war, gave a speech insisting that &quot;Mobs must not intimidate the government. We want no French Revolution in Texas!&quot;, but on June 4 soldiers seized Santa Anna and put him under military arrest. Burnet called for elections to ratify the constitution and elect a Congress, the sixth set of leaders for Texas in a twelve-month period. Voters overwhelmingly chose Houston the first president, ratified the constitution drawn up by the Convention of 1836, and approved a resolution to request annexation to the United States. Houston issued an executive order sending Santa Anna to Washington, D.C., and from there he was soon sent home.

During his absence, Santa Anna had been deposed. Upon his arrival, the Mexican press wasted no time in attacking him for his cruelty towards those executed at Goliad. In May 1837, Santa Anna requested an inquiry into the event. The judge determined the inquiry was only for fact-finding and took no action; press attacks in both Mexico and the United States continued. Santa Anna was disgraced until the following year when he became a hero of the Pastry War.

==Legacy==
The San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. The site includes the San Jacinto Monument, which was erected by the Public Works Administration. Authorized April 21, 1936, and dedicated April 21, 1939, the monument cost $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The site hosts a San Jacinto Day festival and battle re-enactment each year in April.

Both the Texas Navy and the United States Navy have commissioned ships named after the Battle of San Jacinto: the and three ships named . There has been one civilian passenger ship named SS &quot;San Jacinto&quot;.

* Texas Navy schooner &quot;San Jacinto&quot; was commissioned in 1839 and decommissioned in 1840 after she was wrecked at Cayos Arcas.
* The first was a screw frigate launched by the United States Navy in 1850. She was in service with the Africa Squadron in 1860 when she captured the slave ship &quot;Storm King&quot;. The frigate was in service for most of the American Civil War until she wrecked in the Bahamas in 1865.
* was a United States civilian passenger ship built in 1903 by the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding and Engine Works for the New York and Texas Steamship Company. The U.S. Navy considered acquiring the civilian passenger-cargo ship for use during World War I as USS &quot;San Jacinto&quot; (ID-1531) but never acquired or commissioned her. On April 21, 1942, the ship was sunk by a German U-boat.
* The second was a United States Navy World War II light aircraft carrier commissioned in December 1943 and decommissioned in 1947.
*The third is a decommissioned guided missile cruiser commissioned by the U.S. Navy in 1988 and decommissioned in 2023.

When the veteran battleship was decommissioned in 1948 and made into a museum ship, it was decided to give her a permanent anchorage near the San Jacinto Monument. Her arrival from Baltimore, where she was decommissioned, was timed for April 21, 1948—the 112th anniversary of the Battle of San Jacinto.
