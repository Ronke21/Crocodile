<text>The Book of Kells (; ; Dublin, Trinity College Library, MS A. I. [58], sometimes known as the Book of Columba) is an illustrated manuscript and Celtic Gospel book in Latin, containing the four Gospels of the New Testament together with various prefatory texts and tables. It was created in a Columban monastery in either Ireland or Scotland, and may have had contributions from various Columban institutions from each of these areas. It is believed to have been created  800 AD. The text of the Gospels is largely drawn from the Vulgate, although it also includes several passages drawn from the earlier versions of the Bible known as the &quot;Vetus Latina&quot;. It is regarded as a masterwork of Western calligraphy and the pinnacle of Insular illumination. The manuscript takes its name from the Abbey of Kells, County Meath, which was its home for centuries.

The illustrations and ornamentation of the Book of Kells surpass those of other Insular Gospel books in extravagance and complexity. The decoration combines traditional Christian iconography with the ornate swirling motifs typical of Insular art. Figures of humans, animals and mythical beasts, together with Celtic knots and interlacing patterns in vibrant colours, enliven the manuscript&#x27;s pages. Many of these minor decorative elements are imbued with Christian symbolism and so further emphasise the themes of the major illustrations.

The manuscript today comprises 340 leaves or folios; the recto and verso of each leaf total 680 pages. Since 1953, it has been bound in four volumes, 330 mm by 250 mm (13 inches by 9.8 inches). The leaves are high-quality calf vellum; the unprecedentedly elaborate ornamentation that covers them includes ten full-page illustrations and text pages that are vibrant with decorated initials and interlinear miniatures, marking the furthest extension of the anti-classical and energetic qualities of Insular art. The Insular majuscule script of the text appears to be the work of at least three different scribes. The lettering is in iron gall ink, and the colours used were derived from a wide range of substances, some of which were imported from distant lands.

The manuscript is on display to visitors in Trinity College Library, Dublin, and shows two pages at any one time, rotated every 12 weeks. A digitised version of the entire manuscript may also be seen online.

==History==
===Origin===
The Book of Kells is one of the finest and most famous, and also one of the latest, of a group of manuscripts in what is known as the Insular style, produced from the late 6th through the early 9th centuries in monasteries in Britain and Ireland and in continental monasteries with Hiberno-Scottish or Anglo-Saxon foundations. These manuscripts include the Cathach of St. Columba, the Ambrosiana Orosius, fragmentary Gospel in the Durham Dean and Chapter Library (all from the early 7th century), and the Book of Durrow (from the second half of the 7th century). From the early 8th century come the Durham Gospels, the Echternach Gospels, the Lindisfarne Gospels (see illustration at right), and the Lichfield Gospels. Among others, the St. Gall Gospel Book belongs to the late 8th century and the Book of Armagh (dated to 807–809) to the early 9th century.

Scholars place these manuscripts together based on similarities in artistic style, script, and textual traditions. The fully developed style of the ornamentation of the Book of Kells places it late in this series, either from the late 8th or early 9th century. The Book of Kells follows many of the iconographic and stylistic traditions found in these earlier manuscripts. For example, the form of the decorated letters found in the incipit pages for the Gospels is surprisingly consistent in Insular Gospels. Compare, for example, the incipit pages of the Gospel of Matthew in the Lindisfarne Gospels and in the Book of Kells, both of which feature intricate decorative knotwork patterns inside the outlines formed by the enlarged initial letters of the text. (For a more complete list of related manuscripts, see: List of Hiberno-Saxon illustrated manuscripts).

The Abbey of Kells in Kells, County Meath, had been founded, or refounded, from Iona Abbey, construction taking from 807 until the consecration of the church in 814. The manuscript&#x27;s date and place of production have been subjects of considerable debate. Traditionally, the book was thought to have been created in the time of Columba, possibly even as the work of his own hands. This tradition has long been discredited on paleographic and stylistic grounds: most evidence points to a composition date  800, long after St. Columba&#x27;s death in 597. The proposed dating in the 9th century coincides with Viking raids on Lindisfarne and Iona, which began c. 793-794 and eventually dispersed the monks and their holy relics into Ireland and Scotland. There is another tradition, with some traction among Irish scholars, that suggests the manuscript was created for the 200th anniversary of the saint&#x27;s death. Alternatively, as is thought possible for the Northumbrian Lindisfarne Gospels and also the St Cuthbert Gospel, both with Saint Cuthbert, it may have been produced to mark the &quot;translation&quot; or moving of Columba&#x27;s remains into a shrine reliquary, which probably had taken place by the 750s.

There are at least four competing theories about the manuscript&#x27;s place of origin and time of completion. First, the book, or perhaps just the text, may have been created at Iona and then completed in Kells. Second, the book may have been produced entirely at Iona. Third, the manuscript may have been produced entirely in the scriptorium at Kells. Finally, it may have been the product of Dunkeld or another monastery in Pictish Scotland, though there is no actual evidence for this theory, especially considering the absence of any surviving manuscript from Pictland. Although the question of the exact location of the book&#x27;s production will probably never be answered conclusively, the first theory, that it was begun at Iona and continued at Kells, is widely accepted. Regardless of which theory is true, it is certain that the Book of Kells was produced by Columban monks closely associated with the community at Iona.

The historical circumstances which informed the Book of Kells&#x27; production were the preservation of the Latin language after the fall of the Roman Empire and the establishment of monastic life which entailed the production of texts. Cassiodorus in particular advocated both practices, having founded the monastery Vivarium in the sixth century and having written &quot;Institutiones&quot;, a work which describes and recommends several texts—both religious and secular—for study by monks. Vivarium included a scriptorium for the reproduction of books in both genres. Later, the Carolingian period introduced the innovation of copying texts onto vellum, a material much more durable than the papyrus to which many ancient writings had been committed. Gradually, these traditions spread throughout the European continent and finally to the British Isles.

===Medieval period===
Kells Abbey was pillaged by Vikings many times at the beginning of the 9th century, and how the book survived is not known. The earliest historical reference to the book, and indeed to the book&#x27;s presence at Kells, can be found in a 1007 entry in the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;. This entry records that &quot;the great Gospel of Columkille [Columba], the chief relic of the Western World, was wickedly stolen during the night from the western sacristy of the great stone church at Cenannas on account of its wrought shrine&quot;. The manuscript was recovered a few months later—minus its golden and bejewelled cover—&quot;under a sod&quot;. It is generally assumed that the &quot;great Gospel of Columkille&quot; is the Book of Kells. If this is correct, then the book was in Kells by 1007 and had been there long enough for thieves to learn of its presence. The force of ripping the manuscript free from its cover may account for the folios missing from the beginning and end of the Book of Kells. The description in the Annals of the book as &quot;of Columkille&quot;—that is, having belonged to, and perhaps being made by Columba—suggests that the book was believed at that time to have been made on Iona.

Regardless, the book was certainly at Kells in the 12th century, when land charters pertaining to the Abbey of Kells were copied onto some of its blank pages. The practice of copying charters into important books was widespread in the medieval period, and such inscriptions in the Book of Kells provide concrete evidence about its location at the time.

The Abbey of Kells was dissolved because of the ecclesiastical reforms of the 12th century. The abbey church was converted to a parish church in which the Book of Kells remained.

====Book of Kildare====
The 12th-century writer Gerald of Wales, in his &quot;Topographia Hibernica&quot;, described seeing a great Gospel Book in Kildare which many have since assumed was the Book of Kells. The description certainly matches Kells:

Since Gerald claims to have seen this book in Kildare, he may have seen another, now lost, book equal in quality to the Book of Kells, or he may have misstated his location.

===Modern period===
The Book of Kells remained in Kells until 1654. In that year, Cromwell&#x27;s cavalry was quartered in the church at Kells, and the governor of the town sent the book to Dublin for safekeeping. Henry Jones, then Bishop of Clogher and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Dublin, presented the manuscript to Trinity College in Dublin in 1661, and it has remained there ever since, except for brief loans to other libraries and museums. It has been on display to the public in the Old Library at Trinity since the 19th century.

The manuscript&#x27;s rise to worldwide fame began in the 19th century. The association with St. Columba, who died the same year Augustine brought Christianity and literacy to Canterbury from Rome, was used to demonstrate Ireland&#x27;s cultural primacy, seemingly providing &quot;irrefutable precedence in the debate on the relative authority of the Irish and Roman churches&quot;. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were invited to sign the book in 1849. The book&#x27;s artistry was influential on the Celtic Revival; several Victorian picture books of medieval illuminations featured designs from the book which were in turn extensively copied and adapted, patterns appearing in metalwork, embroidery, furniture and pottery among other crafts.

Over the centuries, the book has been rebound several times. During a 19th-century rebinding, the pages were badly cropped, with small parts of some illustrations being lost. The book was also rebound in 1895, but that rebinding broke down quickly. By the late 1920s, several folios had detached completely and were kept separate from the main volume. In 1953, bookbinder Roger Powell rebound the manuscript in four volumes and stretched several pages that had developed bulges. One volume is always on display at Trinity, opened at either a major decorated page or a text page with smaller decorations.

In 2000, the volume containing the Gospel of Mark was sent to Canberra, Australia, for an exhibition of illuminated manuscripts. This was only the fourth time the Book of Kells had been sent abroad for exhibition. The volume suffered what has been called &quot;minor pigment damage&quot; while en route to Canberra. It is thought that the vibrations from the aeroplane&#x27;s engines during the long flight may have caused the damage.

==Description==

The Book of Kells contains the four Gospels of the Christian scriptures written in black, red, purple, and yellow ink in an insular majuscule script, preceded by prefaces, summaries, and concordances of Gospel passages. Today, it consists of 340 vellum leaves, or folios, totalling 680 pages. Almost all folios are numbered at recto, bottom left. One folio number, 36, was mistakenly double-counted. As a result, the pagination of the entire book is reckoned thus: folio 1r — 36v, 36*r — 36*v (the double-counted folio), and 37r — 339v. The majority of the folios are part of larger sheets, called bifolia, which are folded in half to form two folios. The bifolia are nested inside of each other and sewn together to form gatherings called quires. On occasion, a folio is not part of a bifolium but is instead a single sheet inserted within a quire. The extant folios are gathered into 38 quires. There are between four and twelve folios (two to six bifolia) per quire; the folios are commonly, but not invariably, bound in groups of ten. Some folios are single sheets, as is frequently the case with the important decorated pages. The folios had lines drawn for the text, sometimes on both sides, after the bifolia were folded. Prick marks and guidelines can still be seen on some pages. The vellum is of high quality, although the folios have an uneven thickness, with some being close to leather while others are so thin as to be almost translucent. As many as twelve individuals may have collaborated on the book&#x27;s production, of whom four scribes and three painters have been distinguished.

The book&#x27;s current dimensions are 330 by 250 mm. Originally, the folios were of no standard size, but they were cropped to the current size during a 19th-century rebinding. The text area is approximately 250 by 170 mm. Each text page has 16 to 18 lines of text. The manuscript is in remarkably good condition considering its age, though many pages have suffered some damage to the delicate artwork due to rubbing. The book must have been the product of a major scriptorium over several years, yet was apparently never finished, the projected decoration of some pages appearing only in outline. It is believed that the original manuscript consisted of about 370 folios, based on gaps in the text and the absence of key illustrations. The bulk of the missing material (or, about 30 folios) was perhaps lost when the book was stolen in the early 11th century. In 1621 the prominent Anglican clergyman James Ussher counted just 344 folios; presently another four or five are missing from the body of the text, after folios 177, 239, and 330. The missing bifolium 335-36 was found and restored in 1741.

===Contents===
The extant book contains preliminary matter, the complete text of the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, and the Gospel of John through John 17:13. The remaining preliminary matter consists of two fragmentary lists of Hebrew names contained in the Gospels, &quot;Breves causae&quot; (Gospel summaries), &quot;Argumenta&quot; (short biographies of the Evangelists), and Eusebian canon tables. It is probable that, like the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Books of Durrow and Armagh, part of the lost preliminary material included the letter of Jerome to Pope Damasus I beginning &quot;Novum opus&quot;, in which Jerome explains the purpose of his translation. It is also possible, though less likely, that the lost material included the letter of Eusebius to Carpianus, in which he explains the use of the canon tables. Of all the insular Gospels, only the Lindisfarne manuscript contains this letter.

There are two fragments of the lists of Hebrew names; one on the recto of the first surviving folio and one on folio 26, which is currently inserted at the end of the prefatory matter for John. The first list fragment contains the end of the list for the Gospel of Matthew. The missing names from Matthew would require an additional two folios. The second list fragment, on folio 26, contains about a fourth of the list for Luke. The list for Luke would require an additional three folios. The structure of the quire in which folio 26 occurs is such that it is unlikely that there are three folios missing between folios 26 and 27, so that it is almost certain that folio 26 is not now in its original location. There is no trace of the lists for Mark and John.

The first list fragment is followed by the canon tables of Eusebius of Caesarea. These tables, which predate the text of the Vulgate, were developed to cross-reference the Gospels. Eusebius divided the Gospel into chapters and then created tables that allowed readers to find where a given episode in the life of Christ was located in each of the Gospels. The canon tables were traditionally included in the prefatory material in most medieval copies of the Vulgate text of the Gospels. The tables in the Book of Kells are however unusable, first because the scribe condensed the tables in such a way as to make them confused. Second and more importantly, the corresponding chapter numbers were never inserted into the margins of the text, making it impossible to find the sections to which the canon tables refer. The reason for the omission remains unclear: the scribe may have planned to add the references upon the manuscript&#x27;s completion, or he may have deliberately left them out so as not to spoil the appearance of pages.

The &quot;Breves causae&quot; and &quot;Argumenta&quot; belong to a pre-Vulgate tradition of manuscripts. The &quot;Breves causae&quot; are summaries of the Old Latin translations of the Gospels and are divided into numbered chapters. These chapter numbers, like the numbers for the canon tables, are not used on the text pages of the Gospels. It is unlikely that these numbers would have been used, even if the manuscript had been completed, because the chapter numbers corresponded to old Latin translations and would have been difficult to harmonise with the Vulgate text. The &quot;Argumenta&quot; are collections of legends about the Evangelists. The &quot;Breves causae&quot; and &quot;Argumenta&quot; are arranged in a strange order: first, come the &quot;Breves causae&quot; and &quot;Argumenta&quot; for Matthew, followed by the &quot;Breves&quot; and &quot;Argumenta&quot; for Mark, then, quite oddly, come the &quot;Argumenta&quot; of both Luke and John, followed by their &quot;Breves causae&quot;. This anomalous order mirrors that found in the Book of Durrow, although in the latter instance, the misplaced sections appear at the very end of the manuscript rather than as part of a continuous preliminary. In other insular manuscripts, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels, the Book of Armagh, and the Echternach Gospels, each Gospel is treated as a separate work and has its preliminaries immediately preceding it. The slavish repetition in Kells of the order of the &quot;Breves causae&quot; and &quot;Argumenta&quot; found in Durrow led scholar T. K. Abbott to conclude that the scribes of Kells had either the Book of Durrow or a common model in hand.

===Text and script===
The Book of Kells contains the text of the four Gospels based on the Vulgate. It does not, however, contain a pure copy of the Vulgate. There are numerous differences from the Vulgate, where Old Latin translations are used in lieu of Jerome&#x27;s text. Although such variants are common in all the insular Gospels, there does not seem to be a consistent pattern of variation amongst the various insular texts. Evidence suggests that when the scribes were writing the text they often depended on memory rather than on their exemplar.

The manuscript is written primarily in insular majuscule with some occurrences of minuscule letters (usually &quot;e&quot; or &quot;s&quot;). The text is usually written in one long line across the page. Françoise Henry identified at least three scribes in the manuscript, whom she named Hand A, Hand B, and Hand C. Hand A is found on folios 1 through 19v, folios 276 through 289, and folios 307 through the end of the manuscript. Hand A, for the most part, writes eighteen or nineteen lines per page in the brown gall ink common throughout the West. Hand B is found on folios 19r through 26 and folios 124 through 128. Hand B has a somewhat greater tendency to use minuscule and uses red, purple and black ink and a variable number of lines per page. Hand C is found throughout the majority of the text. Hand C also has a greater tendency to use minuscule than Hand A. Hand C uses the same brownish gall ink used by hand A and wrote, almost always, seventeen lines per page. Additionally a fourth scribe named Hand D has been hypothesized, to whom folio 104r was attributed.

====Errors and deviations====
There are several differences between the text and the accepted Gospels. In the genealogy of Jesus, which starts at Luke 3:23, Kells names an extra ancestor. At Matthew 10:34, a common English translation reads &quot;I came not to send peace, but a sword&quot;. However, the manuscript reads &quot;gaudium&quot; (&quot;joy&quot;) where it should read &quot;gladium&quot; (&quot;sword&quot;), thus translating as &quot;I came not (only) to send peace, but joy.&quot; The lavishly decorated opening page of the Gospel according to John had been deciphered by George Bain as: &quot;In principio erat verbum verum&quot; (In the beginning was the True Word). Therefore, the incipit is a free translation into Latin of the Greek original λογος rather than a mere copy of the Roman version.

====Annotations====
Over the centuries multiple annotations have been written in the book, recording page information and historical events. During the 19th century, former Trinity Librarian J.H. Todd numbered the book&#x27;s folios at recto, bottom left. On several of the blank pages among the preliminaries (folios 5v-7r and 27r) are found land charters pertaining to the Abbey of Kells; recording charters in important books was a common custom in the medieval period. James Ussher transcribed the charters in his collected works, and they were later translated into English. A blank page at the end of Luke (folio 289v) contains a poem complaining of taxation upon church land, dated to the 14th or 15th century. In the early 17th century one Richardus Whit recorded several recent events on the same page in &quot;clumsy&quot; Latin, including a famine in 1586, the accession of James I, and plague in Ireland during 1604. The signature of Thomas Ridgeway, 17th century Treasurer of Ireland, is extant on folio 31v, and the 1853 monogram of John O. Westwood, author of an early modern account of the book, is found on 339r.

Three notes concerning the book&#x27;s pagination are found together on a single page (folio 334v): in 1568 one Geralde Plunket noted his annotations of the Gospel&#x27;s chapter numbers throughout the book. A second note from 1588 gave a folio count, and a third note by James Ussher reported 344 folios in the book as of 1621. The bifolium 335-336 was lost and subsequently restored in 1741, recorded in two notes on folio 337r. Plunket&#x27;s accretions were varied and significant. He inscribed transcriptions in the margins of the major illuminated folios 8r, 29r, 203r and 292r. On folio 32v, he added the annotation &quot;Jesus Christus&quot; in the spandrels of the composition&#x27;s architecture, identifying the portrait&#x27;s subject as Christ; in the 19th century, this annotation was covered by white paint, altering the composition. Plunket also wrote his name on multiple pages, and added small animal embellishments.

===Decoration===
The text is accompanied by many full-page miniature illustrations, while smaller painted decorations appear throughout the text in unprecedented quantities. The decoration of the book is famous for combining intricate detail with bold and energetic compositions. The characteristics of the insular manuscript initial, as described by Carl Nordenfalk, here reach their most extreme realisation: &quot;the initials ... are conceived as elastic forms expanding and contracting with a pulsating rhythm. The kinetic energy of their contours escapes into freely drawn appendices, a spiral line which in turn generates new curvilinear motifs...&quot;. The illustrations feature a broad range of colours, with purple, lilac, red, pink, green, and yellow being the colours most often used. Earlier manuscripts tend toward more narrow palettes: the Book of Durrow, for example, uses only four colours. As is usual with insular work, there was no use of gold or silver leaf in the manuscript. The pigments for the illustrations included red and yellow ochre, green copper pigment (sometimes called &quot;verdigris&quot;), indigo, and possibly lapis lazuli. These would have been imported from the Mediterranean region and, in the case of the lapis lazuli (also known as ultramarine), from northeast Afghanistan. Though the presence of lapis lazuli has long been considered evidence of the great cost required to create the manuscript, recent examination of the pigments has shown that lapis lazuli was not used.

The lavish illumination programme is far greater than any other surviving Insular Gospel book. Thirty-three of the surviving pages contain decorative elements which dominate the entire page. These include ten full-page miniature illustrations: a portrait of the Virgin and Child, three pages of evangelist symbols informed by the tetramorphs described in Ezekiel and Revelation, two evangelist portraits, a portrait of Christ enthroned, a carpet page, and scenes of the Arrest of Jesus and Temptation of Christ. Twelve fully decorated text pages embellish the book&#x27;s verses, of which the most extreme examples are the four incipits beginning each Gospel, together with the Chi Rho monogram, a page receiving comparable treatment which heralds a &quot;second beginning&quot; of Matthew, the narrative of Christ&#x27;s life following his genealogy. Another six fully decorated text pages emphasize various points in the Passion story, while a seventh corresponds to the Temptation. The first eleven pages of the extant manuscript begin with a decorated list of Hebrew names, followed by ten pages of Eusebian canon tables framed by architectural elements. Additionally, fourteen pages feature large decorative elements which do not extend throughout the entire page.

It is highly probable that there were other pages of miniature and decorated text that are now lost. Henry identified at least three distinct artists. The &quot;Goldsmith&quot; was responsible for the Chi Rho page, using colour to convey metallic hues. The &quot;Illustrator&quot; was given to idiosyncratic portraits, having produced the Temptation and the Arrest of Christ. The &quot;Portrait Painter&quot; executed the portraits of Christ and the Evangelists. Almost every page contains a decorative element incorporating colour; throughout the text pages, these are commonly stylized capitals. Only two pages—folios 29v and 301v—are devoid of pigment colouration or overt pictorial elements, but even they contain trace decorations in ink.
The extant folios of the manuscript start with the fragment of the glossary of Hebrew names. This fragment occupies the left-hand column of folio 1r. A miniature of the four evangelist symbols, now much abraded, occupies the right-hand column. The miniature is oriented so that the volume must be turned ninety degrees to view it properly. The four evangelist symbols are a visual theme that runs throughout the book. They are almost always shown together to emphasise the doctrine of the four Gospels&#x27; unity of message.

The unity of the Gospels is further emphasised by the decoration of the Eusebian canon tables. The canon tables illustrate the unity of the Gospels by organising corresponding passages from the Gospels. The Eusebian canon tables normally require twelve pages. In the Book of Kells, the makers of the manuscript planned for twelve pages (folios 1v through 7r) but for unknown reasons, condensed them into ten, leaving folios 6v and 7r blank. This condensation rendered the canon tables unusable. The decoration of the first eight pages of the canon tables is heavily influenced by early Gospel Books from the Mediterranean, where it was traditional to enclose the tables within an arcade (as seen in the London Canon Tables). The Kells manuscript presents this motif in an Insular spirit, where the arcades are not seen as architectural elements but rather become stylised geometric patterns with Insular ornamentation. The four evangelist symbols occupy the spaces under and above the arches. The last two canon tables are presented within a grid. This presentation is limited to Insular manuscripts and was first seen in the Book of Durrow.
The preliminary matter is introduced by an iconic image of the Virgin and Child (folio 7v), the first representation of the Virgin Mary in a Western manuscript. Mary is shown in an odd mixture of frontal and three-quarter pose. This miniature also bears a stylistic similarity to the carved image on the lid of St. Cuthbert&#x27;s coffin of 698. The iconography of the miniature seems to derive from Byzantine, Armenian or Coptic art.

The miniature of the Virgin and Child faces the first page of the text, which begins the &quot;Breves causae&quot; of Matthew with the phrase &quot;Nativitas Christi in Bethlem&quot; (the birth of Christ in Bethlehem). The beginning page (folio 8r) of the text of the &quot;Breves causae&quot; is decorated and contained within an elaborate frame. The two-page spread of the miniature and the text makes a vivid introductory statement for the prefatory material. The opening lines of six of the other seven pieces of preliminary matter are enlarged and decorated (see above for the &quot;Breves causae&quot; of Luke), but no other section of the preliminaries is given the same full-page treatment as the beginning of the &quot;Breves causae&quot; of Matthew.
The book was designed so that each of the Gospels would have an elaborate introductory decorative programme. Each Gospel was originally prefaced by a full-page miniature containing the four evangelist symbols, followed by a blank page. Then came a portrait of the evangelist which faced the opening text of the Gospel, itself given an elaborate decorative treatment. The Gospel of Matthew retains both its Evangelist portrait (folio 28v) and its page of Evangelist symbols (folio 27v, see above). The Gospel of Mark is missing the Evangelist portrait but retains its Evangelist symbols page (folio 129v). The Gospel of Luke is missing both the portrait and the Evangelist symbols page. The Gospel of John, like the Gospel of Matthew, retains both its portrait (folio 291v, see at right) and its Evangelist symbols page (folio 290v). It can be assumed that the portraits for Mark and Luke and the symbols page for Luke at one time existed but have been lost.
The ornamentation of the opening few words of each Gospel is lavish; their decoration is so elaborate that the text itself is almost illegible. The opening page (folio 29r) of Matthew may stand as an example. (See illustration at left.) The page consists of only two words: &quot;Liber generationis&quot; (&quot;The book of the generation&quot;). The &quot;lib&quot; of &quot;Liber&quot; is turned into a giant monogram which dominates the entire page. The &quot;er&quot; of &quot;Liber&quot; is presented as an interlaced ornament within the &quot;b&quot; of the &quot;lib&quot; monogram. &quot;Generationis&quot; is broken into three lines and contained within an elaborate frame in the right lower quadrant of the page. The entire assemblage is contained within an elaborate border, further decorated with elaborate spirals and knot work, many of which are zoomorphic.

The opening words of the gospel of Mark, &quot;Initium evangelii Iesu Christi&quot; (&quot;The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ&quot;), Luke, &quot;Quoniam&quot; (&quot;Forasmuch&quot;), and John, &quot;In principio erat verbum verum&quot; (&quot;In the beginning was the True Word&quot;), are all given similar treatments. Although the decoration of these pages was most extensive in the Book of Kells, they are all decorated in the other Insular Gospel books.

The Gospel of Matthew begins with a genealogy of Jesus, followed by his portrait. Folio 32v (top of article) has a miniature of Christ enthroned, flanked by peacocks. Peacocks function as symbols of Christ throughout the book. According to earlier accounts given by Isidore of Seville and Augustine in &quot;The City of God&quot;, the peacocks&#x27; flesh does not putrefy; the animals therefore became associated with Christ via the Resurrection. Facing the portrait of Christ on folio 33r is the only carpet page in the Book of Kells, which is rather anomalous; the Lindisfarne Gospels have five extant carpet pages and the Book of Durrow has six. The blank verso of folio 33 faces the single most lavish miniature of the early medieval period, the Book of Kells Chi Rho monogram, which serves as incipit for the narrative of the life of Christ.

At Matthew 1:18 (folio 34r), the actual narrative of Christ&#x27;s life starts. This &quot;second beginning&quot; to Matthew was given emphasis in many early Gospel Books, so much so that the two sections were often treated as separate works. The second beginning starts with the word &quot;Christ&quot;. The Greek letters chi and rho were normally used in medieval manuscripts to abbreviate the word &quot;Christ&quot;. In Insular Gospel books, the initial Chi Rho monogram was enlarged and decorated. In the Book of Kells, this second beginning was given a decorative programme equal to those prefacing the Gospels, its Chi Rho monogram having grown to consume the entire page. The letter chi dominates the page with one arm swooping across the majority of the page. The letter rho is snuggled underneath the arms of the chi. Both letters are divided into compartments which are lavishly decorated with knotwork and other patterns. The background is likewise awash in a mass of swirling and knotted decoration. Within this mass of decoration are hidden animals and insects. Three angels arise from one of the cross arms of the chi. This miniature is the largest and most lavish extant Chi Rho monogram in any Insular Gospel book, the culmination of a tradition that started with the Book of Durrow.
The Book of Kells contains two other full-page illustrations, which depict episodes from the Passion story. The text of Matthew is illustrated with a full-page illumination of the Arrest of Christ (folio 114r). Jesus is shown beneath a stylised arcade while being held by two much smaller figures. In the text of Luke, there is a full-sized miniature of the Temptation of Christ (folio 202v). Christ is shown from the waist up on top of the Temple. To his right is a crowd of people, perhaps representing his disciples. To his left and below him is a black figure of Satan. Above him hover two angels.

Throughout the body of the Gospels, six fully decorated text pages receive treatment comparable to that of the page which began the &quot;Breves causae&quot; of Matthew. Of these, five correspond to episodes in the Passion story, and one refers to the Temptation. The verso of the folio containing the Arrest of Christ (114v) has a full page of decorated text which reads &quot;Tunc dicit illis Iesus omnes vos scan(dalum)&quot; (Matthew 26:31), where Jesus addresses his disciples immediately before his arrest. A few pages later (folio 124r) is found a very similar decoration of the phrase &quot;Tunc crucifixerant Xpi cum eo duos latrones&quot; (Matthew 27:38), Christ&#x27;s crucifixion together with two thieves. In the Gospel of Mark, another decorated page (folio 183r) gives a description of the Crucifixion (Mark 15:25), while the final (and decorated) page of Mark (folio 187v) describes Christ&#x27;s Resurrection and Ascension (Mark 16:19–20). In the Gospel of Luke, folio 203r faces the illustration of the Temptation, itself an illumination of the text (Luke 4:1) beginning the Temptation narrative. Finally, folio 285r is a fully decorated page corresponding to another moment of the Passion, (Luke 23:56-Luke 24:1) between the Crucifixion and the Resurrection. Since the missing folios of John contain another Passion narrative, it is likely that John contained full pages of decorated text that have been lost.

Apart from the thirty-three fully illuminated pages, fourteen receive substantial decoration not extending over the entire page. Among the Preliminaries and apart from the fully decorated page beginning the &quot;Breves causae&quot; of Matthew, six pages begin six of the eight sections of &quot;Breves causae&quot; and &quot;Argumenta&quot; with embellished names. The exception is folio 24v which introduces the final section of the &quot;Breves causae&quot; of John without a comparable device. Five pages (folios 200r-202v) give an organized decoration of Luke&#x27;s genealogy of Christ, just before the Temptation narrative. Another three pages contain large illuminated elements not extending throughout the entire page. Folio 40v contains text of the Beatitudes in Matthew (Matthew 5:3–10) where the letters &quot;B&quot; beginning each line are linked into an ornate chain along the left margin of the page. Folio 127v has an embellished line beginning the final chapter of Matthew, which gives an account of the Resurrection. A similar treatment is given to a line in folio 188v (Luke 1:5), which begins an account of the Nativity.

==Purpose==
The book had a sacramental rather than educational purpose. Such a large, lavish Gospel would have been left on the high altar of the church and removed only for the reading of the Gospel during Mass, with the reader probably reciting from memory more than reading the text. It is significant that the &quot;Chronicles of Ulster&quot; state the book was stolen from the sacristy, where the vessels and other accoutrements of the Mass were stored, rather than from the monastic library. Its design seems to take this purpose in mind; that is, the book was produced with appearance taking precedence over practicality. There are numerous uncorrected mistakes in the text. Lines were often completed in a blank space in the line above. The chapter headings that were necessary to make the canon tables usable were not inserted into the margins of the page. In general, nothing was done to disrupt the look of the page: aesthetics were given priority over utility.

==Reproductions==
Some of the first faithful reproductions made of pages and elements of the Book of Kells were by the artist Helen Campbell D&#x27;Olier in the 19th century. She used vellum and reproduced the pigments used in the original manuscript. Photographs of her drawings were included in Sullivan&#x27;s study of the Book of Kells, first printed in 1913.

In 1951, the Swiss publisher Urs Graf Verlag Bern produced the first facsimile of the Book of Kells. The majority of the pages were reproduced in black-and-white photographs, but the edition also featured forty-eight colour reproductions, including all the full-page decorations. Under licence from the Board of Trinity College Dublin, Thames and Hudson produced a partial facsimile edition in 1974, which included a scholarly treatment of the work by Françoise Henry. This edition included all the full-page illustrations in the manuscript and a representative selection of the ornamentation of the text pages, together with some enlarged details of the illustrations. The reproductions were all in full colour, with photography by John Kennedy, Green Studio, Dublin.

In 1979, Swiss publisher Faksimile-Verlag Luzern requested permission to produce a full-colour facsimile of the book. Permission was initially denied because Trinity College officials felt that the risk of damage to the book was too high. By 1986, Faksimile-Verlag had developed a process that used gentle suction to straighten a page so that it could be photographed without touching it and so won permission to publish a new facsimile. After each page was photographed, a single-page facsimile was prepared so the colours could be carefully compared to the original and adjustments made where necessary. The completed work was published in 1990 in a two-volume set containing the full facsimile and scholarly commentary. One copy is held by the Anglican Church in Kells, on the site of the original monastery.

The ill-fated Celtworld heritage centre, which opened in Tramore, County Waterford in 1992, included a replica of the Book of Kells. It cost approximately £18,000 to produce. In 1994, Bernard Meehan, Keeper of Manuscripts at Trinity College Dublin, produced an introductory booklet on the Book of Kells, with 110 colour images of the manuscript. His 2012 book contained more than 80 pages from the manuscript reproduced full-size and in full colour.

A digital copy of the manuscript was produced by Trinity College in 2006 and made available for purchase through Trinity College on DVD-ROM. It included the ability to leaf through each page, view two pages at a time, or look at a single page in a magnified setting. There were also commentary tracks about the specific pages as well as the history of the book. Users were given the option to search by specific illuminated categories including animals, capitols and angels. It retailed for approximately €30 but has since been discontinued. The Faksimile-Verlag images are now online at Trinity College&#x27;s Digital Collections portal.

== Significance ==
The Ireland in which the Book of Kells was crafted and manufactured, writes Christopher de Hamel, &quot;was clearly no primitive backwater but a civilization which could now read Latin, although never occupied by the Romans, and which was somehow familiar with texts and artistic designs which have unambiguous parallels in the Coptic and Greek churches, such as carpet pages and Canon tables. Although the Book of Kells itself is as uniquely Irish as anything imaginable, it is a Mediterranean text and the pigments used in making it include orpiment, a yellow made from arsenic sulphide, exported from Italy, where it is found in volcanoes. There are clearly lines of trade and communication unknown to us.&quot;

==In popular culture==
The 2009 animated film &quot;The Secret of Kells&quot; tells a fictional story of the creation of the Book of Kells by an elderly monk Aidan and his young apprentice Brendan, who struggle to work on the manuscript in the face of destructive Viking raids. It was directed by Tomm Moore and nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2009.

<text>Assemblywomen ( &quot;Ekklesiazousai&quot;; also translated as, Congresswomen, Women in Parliament, Women in Power, and A Parliament of Women) is a comedy written by the Greek playwright Aristophanes in 391 BC. The play invents a scenario where the women of Athens assume control of the government and institute reforms that ban private wealth and enforce sexual equity for the old and unattractive. In addition to Aristophanes&#x27; political and social satire, &quot;Assemblywomen&quot; derives its comedy through sexual and scatological humor. The play aimed to criticize the Athenian government&#x27;s expropriation of land and wealth at the time.

==Plot==
The play begins with Praxagora emerging from a house on an Athenian street before daybreak. She is wearing a false beard and men&#x27;s clothing, and she carries a walking stick and a lit lantern. The chorus of Athenian women enter one by one, all dressed in similar costume. In order to be more convincingly masculine, some women have developed tans and stopped shaving their armpits. One woman brings a basket full of yarn in order to get some work done as the assembly fills up, to which Praxagora chastises her for this decision as it will ruin their cover.

The women are wary of the plan and Praxagora attempts to rally them as they practice speaking as men before the assembly. Praxagora is frustrated by the women&#x27;s inability to pretend to be men, as they swear to Demeter and Persephone rather than Apollo, address the assembled women as ladies, and complain about the discomfort of their disguises and their thirst. Praxagora decides that she alone is capable of speaking to the assembly and practises a speech decrying the corrupt leaders of the city as selfish and unpatriotic through their acts of war and personal enrichment through public funds. She proposes that the men turn control of the government over to the women because &quot;after all, we employ them as stewards and treasurers in our own households.&quot; She further explains that women are superior to men because they are harder workers, devoted to tradition and do not bother with useless innovations. As mothers, they will better protect the soldiers and feed them extra rations, as shrewd negotiators, they will secure more funds for the city. Praxagora impresses the women with her rhetorical skills, and explains that it was learned from listening to orators while living with her husband on the Pnyx, where the Athenian assembly was held. They discuss how they plan to handle opposition and practice how to raise their hands to vote before leaving to attend the assembly by dawn in order to receive pay and a complimentary meal. The chorus of women reiterate their intentions before exiting the stage.

Praxagora&#x27;s husband Blepyrus emerges from their house wearing Praxagora&#x27;s nightgown and slippers. He is old and desperately had to relieve himself but could not find his clothing in the dark. As he squats in the street lamenting his constipation, his neighbor arrives and both men realize that their wives and clothing are missing from their homes. Chremes, returning from the assembly, comes upon Blepyrus and his neighbor and explains that he was not paid because of the unprecedented turn-out of pale faced shoe-makers (referring to the women in disguise). He relayed the events of the assembly and Praxagora&#x27;s speech. Believing she was a &quot;good-looking young man,&quot; Chremes explains how he argued women were better at keeping secrets, returning borrowed items without cheating, that they don’t sue or inform on people or try to overthrow the democracy, all points that Blepyrus agreed upon. Now free of attending the assembly, the men are pleased to finally sleep in, but are not excited about having to provide sex to receive their breakfast.

The chorus enters, still in disguise and on their way home from the assembly, trying not to draw attention to themselves. Blepyrus accuses Praxagora of sneaking off with a lover when he finds her returning his cloak. She explains that she was only helping a friend in labor and had to wear his cloak for warmth. She feigns surprise when he explains to her the decision from the morning&#x27;s assembly, but immediately begins listing the reasons the decision was wise. Praxagora then goes on to explain the details of the new government to Blepyrus. She proposes banning all ownership of private wealth and establishing equal pay for all and a unified standard of living. She further explains that people will no longer have a need for personal wealth as all basic needs will be met by the common fund. She further adds that men and women will be free to sleep with anyone they want, so long as they first sleep with the uglier members of the opposite sex. Parental responsibilities will be shared by the community as children will no longer know their fathers. Slaves will work the fields and new clothes will be made when they are needed. Praxagora elaborates that there will be no more lawsuits, since there can be no debt in a society without private wealth. Punishments for assault will come out of the offender&#x27;s bread ration and theft will be obsolete as all men will be given their fair share. Walls within homes will be knocked down and all will live in a common living space, courthouses and porticos will be turned into communal dining halls. Prostitutes will be put out of business, but slaves will be banned from sleeping with free men.

In the next scene, Blepyrus&#x27; neighbor is laying his household objects out in front of his house to be contributed to the common fund as the Selfish Man enters. The Selfish Man calls the neighbor a fool for following the new laws. He plans on waiting to see if everyone else gives up their property before he does it himself, citing failed decrees from the assembly in the past. The town Herald enters and announces a lavish feast for all to attend. The Selfish Man acts entitled to the feast, but the neighbor points out his reluctance to donate possessions to the common fund disqualifies him from communal events. After the neighbor leaves to donate his possessions, the selfish man explains that he intends to keep his belongings and enjoy the free dinner at the same time.

In a different scene, a young girl waits for her boyfriend Epigenes to arrive as an old woman is out looking for a date. They exchange vulgar insults and go inside their homes as Epigenes enters the scene, lamenting the new laws governing sex. He and the girl both speak of their desire for one another, but are interrupted by the old woman. Citing the new law, the old woman attempts to force Epigenes to sleep with her first. As the young girl and the old woman fight over the boy, two more old women enter and drag him away against his will.

In the final scene, a drunken maid enters praising Thasian wine and the new laws. She is looking to bring Blepyrus to dinner at Praxagora&#x27;s request. She finds Blepyrus passing by, already on his way to dinner with two girls in his arms. They all go to dinner together while the chorus sings of the lavish feast they are about to have.

==Historical background==
In the early 4th century BC, Athens was reeling from the Peloponnesian War and remained in the midst of continuing battles with Sparta. Athens and its allies, Thebes, Corinth and Argos experienced over two years struggling to rid themselves of the Spartans with many successes and failures along the way. While Athens was in a position to regain naval authority in the Aegean Sea thanks to alliances forged with Persia and King Evagoras of Cyprus, the people of Athens were impoverished. For this reason, the poor favored war as it ensured future employment while the wealthy favored peace, as war required disbursements. Continuation of the Corinthian War inevitably led to increased confiscations and forced contributions from wealthy Athenians. This atmosphere resulted in a material and moral anxiety that was illustrated in the Athens represented by Aristophanes.

== Analysis ==
Even though the idea of a female-led government was a fantasy at the time, it was not unfamiliar to the people of Athens. The comic tradition of women in politics was in fact common, as seen through Aristophanes&#x27; plays &quot;Lysistrata&quot; and &quot;Thesmophoriazusae&quot;. The idea of women surpassing their Athenian social order is also seen in Sophocles’ tragedy &quot;Antigone&quot;.

According to Erich Segal, reading the play as a genuine exploration of female power is incorrect. It follows Aristophanes’ conflict structure of the republic in trouble, a solution suggested and that solution ultimately failing. Aristophanes’ plays mostly derive their narratives on absurd political and social innovations derived from the evolution of the state towards empowering effeminate men while displacing traditionally strong and masculine leadership. The ascent of women in political power in &quot;Assemblywomen&quot; is yet another commentary on what Aristophanes saw as the shameful effeminacy of the men currently in power in Athens. The fact that women in this instance could enter the assembly and successfully pass as men was a commentary on politicians being indistinguishable from women in costume.

&quot;Assemblywomen&quot; does not fall neatly within the confines of Old or New Comedy and is generally considered Middle Comedy. While the play follows the plot structure of earlier works by Aristophanes, the formal structure shows new developments, specifically in the function of the chorus. Though prominent in the first and last scenes of the play, the chorus’ lack of involvement throughout the central scenes is more similar to the style of Greek Tragedies. The play lacks a parabasis and has an undeveloped agon, the choral songs between episodes are not included in the script, and the lacuna is often indicated by the note &quot;choru&quot; (&quot;place for a chorus&quot;), which is more characteristic of Menander and New Comedy.

&quot;Assemblywomen&quot; is one of the earliest examples of cross-dressing in fiction.

==Longest word==
The play contains the longest word in Greek, transliterated as:

or, in the Greek alphabet:

. (1169–74)

Jeffrey Henderson translated the word as a stew of &quot;limpets and saltfish and sharksteak and dogfish and mullets and oddfish with savory pickle sauce and thrushes with blackbirds and various pigeons and roosters and pan-roasted wagtails and larks and nice chunks of hare marinated in mulled wine and all of it drizzled with honey and silphium and vinegar, oil and spices galore.&quot; The Greek word contains 171 letters, which far surpasses that of Shakespeare&#x27;s 27-letter long word, &quot;honorificabilitudinitatibus&quot; in his Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost V.I.

<text>Mercedita International Airport (AIM) () is an international airport located three nautical miles (6 km) east of the central business district of Ponce, Puerto Rico. The airport covers 270 &quot;&quot; (approx. 262.2 acres) of land and has one runway. It was inaugurated as an international airport on 1 November 1990. It was built with combined funds from the Municipality of Ponce and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

Mercedita International is Puerto Rico&#x27;s largest airport in terms of military personnel volume, the second largest in terms of military freight, and the third largest in terms of scheduled commercial passenger traffic. The airport is certified under part 139 of the Federal Aviation Regulations.

As per Federal Aviation Administration records, there were 215,165 enplanements in fiscal year 2015–2016. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport. Mercedita was the only one of Puerto Rico&#x27;s three international airports to see an increase in passenger flow in 2012. The municipality of Ponce has been attempting to gain ownership of the airport from the government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico as it believes local management of the airport will help the municipal and regional economy.

==History==
===Early history===
Built in 1939, Mercedita was originally a modest aerodrome used for the airborne irrigation of sugarcane fields belonging to Destilería Serrallés. The airport took the name of the sugarcane plantation that it was part of, Hacienda Mercedita. The founder of the plantation, Juan Serrallés, had named his plantation in honor of his wife Mercedes. To commemorate this, a portrait of Mrs. Mercedes Serrallés was unveiled in the airport on 30 December 1992 by then-governor of Puerto Rico Rafael Hernandez Colon.

The takeoff/landing strip was then only long by wide. During World War II it was turned into a military airport, and in 1947 the U.S. Navy ceded the airport to the Puerto Rico Ports Authority. The airport officially started operations in April 1948.

In 1949, however, it was determined that the runway of what was then the Ponce Airport at the nearby Losey Field (today, Fort Allen, Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico) no longer met the newer and more stringent minimum airport safety requirements, and airport operations were suspended. As a result, studies were initiated for the construction of a new airport at Mercedita Airfield. A wall plaque inside the airport states the airport was built with funds from both the Government of Puerto Rico and the Government of the Autonomous Municipality of Ponce and that it was inaugurated in November 1955. It was officially inaugurated on 6 November 1955, via a day-long program of ceremonies and activities transmitted live via radio, and filmed for subsequent TV broadcasting. During the ceremonies, the project&#x27;s engineer, Raul Gayá Benejám, made delivery of the new facilities to Salvador V. Caro, executive director of the Puerto Rico Ports Authority.

The first scheduled commercial flights at Mercedita occurred in 1965 when domestic flights started. International flights started in 1971. Meanwhile, Aerolineas de Ponce began services from Mercedita in 1966; the airline had a hub at the airport but soon had most of its flight operating from San Juan instead and changed its name to Prinair.

On 12 August 1981, an Air Florida plane with 125 Haitian refugees aboard landed at Mercedita en route to the Fort Allen facility in Juana Diaz, part of the 1981 Haitian refugees exodus.

===New airport===
The airport has been enlarged on various occasions. One of the architects credited with the airport&#x27;s construction is Raúl Gayá Benejam. In 1962, Trade Winds started daily direct service to St. Thomas, U.S.V.I. One major construction project, in particular, took place in 1963 when the runway was extended from to 3,900 feet. In 1967, a master plan was adopted for the systematic development of the airport. In 1971 the runway was again extended, to to allow for the use by Boeing 727 aircraft. In 1987 the runway was once again extended, this time to . The passenger terminal was also remodeled, a was built for use by general aviation as was a new building for the Air Rescue Unit of the Puerto Rico Police.

===1990s expansion work===
In the fall of 1992, the runway was extended to make it possible for American Airlines to run flights to Miami, Florida. The cost of the expansion was $3 million. The expansion provided additional length, as well as additional width. Also in the fall of 1992, the Puerto Rico Ports Authority spent another $6 million in improvements to the terminal building. These included an additional space in the baggage claim, immigration, customs, passenger waiting areas, vending areas, and Department of Agriculture installations.

The airport was formerly called Mercedita Airport, but on 1 November 1990 it was inaugurated as &quot;Mercedita International Airport&quot; after addition of customs and border control facilities.

===2000s-2010===

After Ponce&#x27;s mayor Rafael Cordero signed a contract to build a major seaport in the area, Mercedita&#x27;s directors decided to expand the airport&#x27;s runway to to accommodate anticipated growth in airline traffic.

On 17 June 2005, JetBlue began daily, non-stop service between John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and Mercedita Airport. On 17 November 2005, Continental Airlines also commenced non-stop service between Newark Liberty International Airport and Ponce. This service ended on 17 January 2008. On 3 June 2006, Delta Connection began servicing the airport, with twice-weekly, regional jet service to Atlanta, Georgia. The service ended on 20 January 2007. JetBlue has also added daily, non-stop service between Ponce and Orlando International Airport.

During 2007, more passengers passed through the airport than the population of the entire city of Ponce itself. &quot;Ponce&#x27;s Mercedita airport served 251,000 passengers in 2007, an increase of 28% over the previous year.&quot;

Passenger movement at the airport in FY 2008 was 278,911, a 1,228% increase over fiscal year 2003 and the highest of all the regional airports for that 5-year period. In February 2009, Ponce mayor María Meléndez sought transfer of the airport from the Puerto Rico central government to the Ponce Municipal government amidst discontent with the bureaucracy at the central government that could be avoided if the airport was locally managed.

In early 2010, members of the Ponce Chamber of Commerce strongly criticized the Puerto Rico Ports Authority and its director Alvaro Pilar Villagran after failure to execute on a legally binding agreement of November 2008, whereby the Ports Authority agreed to an investment of $8 million to build an airport drainage system needed as part of any additional expansion work.

In 2010, the Puerto Rico Ports Authority announced an investment of $7 million to extend Mercedita&#x27;s runway to . Construction began in February 2011. In 2012 the Authority installed two boarding bridges among other terminal improvements.

==Facilities and aircraft==
Mercedita Airport covers an area of at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 12/30 with an asphalt surface measuring . Runway length includes displaced thresholds on Runways 12 and 30 respectively.

Most of the airport is located in Ponce&#x27;s Vayas barrio, but the western end of the runway (west of Calle la Esperanza) extends into the Sabanetas barrio.

* Essential Air Service documents (Docket OST-1999-6592) from the U.S. Department of Transportation:
** Order 2005-3-2 (7 March 2005): selecting Hyannis Air Service, Inc., d/b/a Cape Air to provide essential air service (EAS) at Mayaguez and Ponce, Puerto Rico, for the two-year period through 30 April 2007; establishing an annual subsidy rate of $688,551, beginning when the carrier inaugurates service at Mayaguez; and establishing an annual subsidy rate of $622,056 for service at Ponce, retroactive to 1 January 2005.
** Order 2007-4-18 (20 April 2007): selecting Hyannis Air Service, Inc., d/b/a Cape Air to provide essential air service (EAS) at Mayaguez and Ponce, Puerto Rico, for the two-year period through 30 April 2007; establishing an annual subsidy rate of $688,551, beginning when the carrier inaugurates service at Mayaguez; and establishing an annual subsidy rate of $622,056 for service at Ponce, retroactive to 1 January 2005.
** Order 2009-3-1 (3 March 2009): re-selecting Hyannis Air Service, Inc., d/b/a Cape Air, to continue to provide subsidized essential air service (EAS) at Mayaguez and Ponce, Puerto Rico, for the two-year period beginning 1 May 2009, at the annual subsidy rates of $980,980 for Mayaguez and $740,416 for Ponce.
** Order 2010-12-31 (23 December 2010): requesting proposals, by 21 January, from carriers interested in providing essential air service (EAS) at Mayaguez, for a new two-year period beginning 1 May 2011, with or without subsidy. For several years, Mayaguez and Ponce have been handled under the same contract because the communities are on the same island, receiving service provided by the same carrier. However, with respect to this order, we are soliciting proposals for service to Mayaguez only. In addition to the service provided by Cape Air, Ponce receives subsidy-free jet service on a daily basis – one round trip to Orlando and one round trip to New York – provided by JetBlue, with 150-seat Airbus A-320 aircraft. That level of service far exceeds Ponce&#x27;s EAS requirements; therefore, consistent with program practice, we will not seek proposals for replacement service at this time, but, rather, we will rely JetBlue&#x27;s subsidy-free service to continue connecting the community to the national air transportation system. We note that Ponce&#x27;s receiving subsidy free service does not change its status as an EAS community.
** Order 2011-4-24 (28 April 2011): granting the motions to file a petition for review of staff action of Order 2010-12-31, 23 December 2010, and upon review, denying their petition.

<doc id="157481" wikidata="Q107914" url="?curid=157481" title="Diamonds Are Forever (film)">
<text>Diamonds Are Forever is a 1971 spy film and the seventh film in the &quot;James Bond&quot; series produced by Eon Productions. It is the sixth and final Eon film to star Sean Connery, who returned to the role as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond, having declined to reprise the role in &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (1969).

The film is based on Ian Fleming&#x27;s 1956 novel of the same name and is the second of four &quot;James Bond&quot; films directed by Guy Hamilton. The story has Bond impersonating a diamond smuggler to infiltrate a smuggling ring and uncovering a plot by his old enemy Ernst Stavro Blofeld to use the diamonds to build a space-based laser weapon. Bond sets out to stop the smuggling but discovers he must defeat Blofeld before he destroys Washington D.C. in his plan to blackmail the world with nuclear supremacy.

After George Lazenby left the series, producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli tested other actors, but studio United Artists wanted Connery back, paying a then-record $1.25 million salary for him to return. The producers were inspired by &quot;Goldfinger&quot;; as with that film, Guy Hamilton was hired to direct, and Shirley Bassey performed the title song. Locations included Las Vegas, California, and Amsterdam. &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; was a commercial success and received positive reviews, though some of the humor has become controversial in retrospect. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound.

==Plot==

To avenge the murder of his wife, James Bond – agent 007 – hunts Ernst Stavro Blofeld. At a facility where Blofeld lookalikes are being created through plastic surgery, Bond kills a test subject and later the &quot;real&quot; Blofeld.

While assassins Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd kill people involved in a diamond-smuggling operation, M suspects that South African diamonds are being stockpiled to depress prices by dumping and assigns Bond to uncover the smuggling ring. Impersonating smuggler Peter Franks, Bond travels to Amsterdam to meet contact Tiffany Case. Bond kills the real Franks, then switches IDs to fake his death and assume Franks&#x27; identity. Tiffany and Bond go to Los Angeles, smuggling the diamonds inside Franks&#x27; corpse.

At the airport, Bond meets his CIA contact Felix Leiter and travels to Las Vegas. At a funeral home operating in the smuggling ring, Franks&#x27; body is cremated, and the diamonds are passed on to smuggler Shady Tree. The funeral home operator double-crosses Bond, and Wint and Kidd try to cremate him alive. However, Tree stops the process after discovering the diamonds in Franks&#x27; body were fake, planted by Bond and the CIA. Bond tells Leiter to ship the real diamonds. At the Whyte House, a casino and hotel owned by billionaire Willard Whyte, Tree works as a stand-up comedian. Tree is killed by Wint and Kidd, who do not know the diamonds were fake.

At the craps table, Bond meets Plenty O&#x27;Toole, and later brings her to his room. Slumber&#x27;s henchmen ambush them, throwing O&#x27;Toole out the window and into the pool below. Bond instructs Tiffany to retrieve the diamonds at the Circus Circus casino. Tiffany reneges on her deal and flees, passing off the diamonds to the next smuggler. However, seeing that O&#x27;Toole was killed after being mistaken for her, Tiffany changes her mind. She drives Bond to the airport, where they see the diamonds given to Whyte&#x27;s casino manager, Bert Saxby. Saxby later rendezvous with a scientist who takes the diamonds. The scientist goes to a remote research laboratory owned by Whyte, where a satellite is being built by a laser refraction specialist. Bond sneaks into the laboratory. However, after being caught, Bond escapes by stealing a moon buggy, fights his way out of the facility and reunites with Tiffany. Later in the evening, Bond and Tiffany evade the police in Vegas.

Bond climbs to the Whyte House&#x27;s top floor to confront Whyte. He is instead met by two identical Blofelds, who use an electronic simulator to sound like Whyte when communicating with the outside world. Bond kills one of the Blofelds, who turns out to be a look-alike. He is then knocked out by gas, picked up by Wint and Kidd, taken out to Las Vegas Valley, placed in a pipeline and left to die. Bond escapes, then calls Blofeld, using another voice simulator to pose as Saxby. He locates Whyte&#x27;s desert home, defeats bodyguards Bambi and Thumper, and rescues Whyte. Meanwhile, Blofeld abducts Tiffany. With Whyte&#x27;s help, Bond raids the lab and uncovers Blofeld&#x27;s plot to use the diamonds to create a laser satellite, which has already been sent into orbit. With the satellite, Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons installations in China, the Soviet Union and the United States, then proposes an international auction for global nuclear supremacy.

Whyte identifies an oil rig off the coast of Baja California as Blofeld&#x27;s base of operations. After Bond&#x27;s attempt to change the cassette containing the satellite control codes fails, a helicopter attack on the rig is launched by Leiter and the CIA. Blofeld tries to escape in a midget submarine. Bond gains control of its launch crane and uses the submarine as a wrecking ball, destroying the satellite control and the base. Bond and Tiffany then head for Britain on an ocean liner, where Wint and Kidd pose as room-service workers and attempt to kill them with a bomb hidden in a cake. When the killers are exposed, they attack. Bond kills Kidd and throws Wint overboard with the bomb, which explodes as Wint lands in the water. As Blofeld&#x27;s satellite is still in orbit, Tiffany asks Bond if they can get the diamonds back to Earth.

In uncredited roles, Lola Larson (a stage name used by gymnast Mary Hiller) and Trina Parks appeared as Bambi and Thumper, Whyte&#x27;s bodyguards; Shane Rimmer as Tom, the director of Whyte&#x27;s astronautics facility; Ed Bishop as Klaus Hergersheimer, a scientist involved with building the satellite; Henry Rowland as Doctor Tynan, and Cassandra Peterson as a dancer. Peterson says in her autobiography that she was in the film but believes she did not make the final edit. It has been rumoured that Peterson and later star Valerie Perrine played Shady Tree&#x27;s &quot;Acorns&quot;, the showgirls who support him during his standup routine. They were actually played by performers Jennifer Castle and Pat Gill.

==Production==
The producers originally intended to have &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; re-create commercially successful aspects of &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, including hiring the director, Guy Hamilton. Peter R. Hunt, who had directed &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; and worked in all previous Bond films as editor, was invited before Hamilton, but due to involvement with another project could only work on the film if the production date was postponed, which the producers declined to do. As a condition for Hamilton directing after his difficulties with trade unions during the filming of &quot;Battle of Britain&quot;, &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; was the first Bond production to be primarily based in the United States rather than the United Kingdom.

===Writing===
While &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; was in post-production, Richard Maibaum wrote several drafts about Bond avenging the death of his wife Tracy. The characters Irma Bunt and Marc-Ange Draco were set to return and Bond mourning his deceased wife Tracy while Louis Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;We Have All the Time in the World&quot; played in the background. Harry Saltzman had suggested Thailand and India as potential filming locations. When George Lazenby departed from the role prior to the film&#x27;s release, a complete rewrite was requested, in addition to Maibaum&#x27;s script failing to impress Albert R. Broccoli and Saltzman. Following this, Maibaum wrote an original script with Auric Goldfinger&#x27;s twin seeking revenge for the death of his brother. In this version, Goldfinger&#x27;s brother was a Swedish shipping magnate armed with a laser cannon held within the hull of a supertanker. The idea was borrowed from an early draft of &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; in which Ernst Stavro Blofeld was to be Goldfinger&#x27;s twin brother, with Gert Fröbe set to return. The film would have ended with a boat chase of Chinese junks and Roman galleys on Lake Mead. The plot was later changed after Broccoli had a dream, where his close friend Howard Hughes was replaced by an imposter. Hence, the character of Willard Whyte was created, and Tom Mankiewicz was chosen to rework the script.

Mankiewicz says he was hired because Broccoli wanted an American writer to work on the script, since so much of it was set in Las Vegas &quot;and the Brits write really lousy American gangsters&quot; – but it had to be someone who also understood the British idiom, since it had British characters. David Picker, then-president of United Artists, had seen the stage musical &quot;Georgy&quot; written by Mankiewicz, and recommended him; he was hired on a two-week trial and kept on for the rest of the movie, as well as several subsequent Bond films. The idea of Goldfinger&#x27;s brother was scrapped, and Blofeld was written back into the script. Mankiewicz later estimated the novel provided around 45 minutes of the film&#x27;s final running time. The adaptation eliminated the main villains from the source Ian Fleming novel, mobsters called Jack and Seraffimo Spang, but used the henchmen Shady Tree, Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd.

===Casting===
George Lazenby was originally offered a contract for seven Bond films but declined and left after just one, &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, on the advice of his agent Ronan O&#x27;Rahilly. Producers contemplated replacing him with John Gavin, though actors Clint Eastwood, Adam West, Burt Reynolds, Robert Wagner, Brett Halsey, Malcolm Roberts, and Ranulph Fiennes had also been considered; Eastwood, Reynolds, and West had stated that Bond should not be played by an American actor, with West stating he was doing &quot;something else&quot; at the time. Michael Gambon rejected an offer, telling Broccoli that he was &quot;in terrible shape&quot;. Producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman wanted to cast Roger Moore, but he was busy filming &quot;The Persuaders!&quot;.

Picker was unhappy with this decision and made it clear that Connery was to be enticed back to the role and that money was no object. When approached about resuming the role of Bond, Connery demanded the fee of $1.25 million. To entice the actor to play Bond once more, United Artists offered two back-to-back films of his choice. After both sides agreed to the deal, Connery used the fee to establish the Scottish International Education Trust, where Scottish artists could apply for funding without having to leave their country to pursue their careers. Since John Gavin was no longer in the running for the role, his contract was paid in full by United Artists. The first film made under Connery&#x27;s deal was &quot;The Offence&quot;, directed by his friend Sidney Lumet.

Charles Gray was cast as villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld, after playing a Bond ally named Dikko Henderson in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967). Jazz musician Putter Smith was invited by Saltzman to play Mr. Kidd, after a Thelonious Monk Band show. Musician Paul Williams was originally cast as Mr. Wint. When he could not agree with the producers on compensation, Bruce Glover replaced him. Glover said he was surprised at being chosen, because at first producers said he was too normal and that they wanted a deformed, Peter Lorre-like actor. Bruce Cabot, who played the part of Bert Saxby, died the following year; &quot;Diamonds&quot; turned out to be his final film role. Jimmy Dean was cast as Willard Whyte after Saltzman saw a presentation of him. Dean was very worried about playing a Howard Hughes pastiche, because he was an employee of Hughes at the Desert Inn.

Jill St. John had originally been offered the part of Plenty O&#x27;Toole but landed the female lead after Sidney Korshak, who assisted the producers in filming in Las Vegas locations, recommended his client St. John, who became the first American Bond girl. Linda Thorson met with Cubby Broccoli, hoping to be considered for the part of Case, but he never considered her for the role, although he did briefly list her as a possibility for the part of Plenty O&#x27;Toole. Some time later, Broccoli told Thorson she was never cast in a Bond film because she did not have long hair. Lana Wood was cast as Plenty O&#x27;Toole, following a suggestion of screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz. Wood modeled her performance after Leigh Taylor-Young and Minnie Mouse. Denise Perrier, Miss World 1953, played &quot;Marie&quot;, the woman in the bikini who is forced by Bond to disclose the location of Blofeld.

A cameo appearance by Sammy Davis Jr. playing on the roulette table was filmed, but his scene was eventually deleted.

Initially, the character of Miss Moneypenny did not feature in the movie, partly because Lois Maxwell had held out for a pay increase, but it was decided during production to add the scene where, disguised as a customs officer, Moneypenny gives Bond his travel documents at the port of Dover. The additional scene was a last-minute rewrite, as the producers felt it important to incorporate Maxwell after her issue was resolved. Maxwell and Connery filmed their lines separately for the short scene.

===Filming===
Filming began on 5 April 1971, with the South African scenes actually shot in the desert near Las Vegas. The scene was originally written to include Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd killing Dr. Tynan by forcing a scorpion down his mouth, but it was rewritten in order to be approved by British censors. The film was shot primarily in the United States, with locations including the Los Angeles International Airport, Universal City Studios and eight hotels of Las Vegas. Besides Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, other places in England were Dover and Southampton. The climactic oil rig sequence was shot off the shore of Oceanside, California. Other filming locations included Cap D&#x27;Antibes in France for the opening scenes, Amsterdam and Frankfurt Airport.

Filming in Las Vegas took place mostly in hotels owned by Howard Hughes, for he was a friend of Cubby Broccoli&#x27;s. Getting the streets empty to shoot was achieved through the collaboration of Hughes, the Las Vegas police, and the shopkeepers&#x27; association. The Las Vegas Hilton doubled for the Whyte House, and since the owner of the Circus Circus was a Bond fan, he allowed the Circus to be used on film and even made a cameo. The cinematographers said filming in Las Vegas at night had an advantage: no additional illumination was required due to the high number of neon lights. Sean Connery made the most of his time on location in Las Vegas. &quot;I didn&#x27;t get any sleep at all. We shot every night, I caught all the shows and played golf all day. On the weekend I collapsed – boy, did I collapse. Like a skull with legs.&quot; He also played the slot machines, and once delayed a scene because he was collecting his winnings. While shooting in Las Vegas, Connery dated his co-stars Lana Wood and Jill St. John.

The home of Kirk Douglas was used for the scene in Tiffany&#x27;s house, while the Elrod House in Palm Springs, designed by John Lautner, became Willard Whyte&#x27;s house. The exterior shots of the Slumber Mortuary were of the Palm Mortuary in Henderson, Nevada. The interiors were a set constructed at Pinewood Studios, where Ken Adam imitated the real building&#x27;s lozenge-shaped stained glass window in its chapel. The Garden of Remembrance scene was shot at Palm Downtown Cemetery, Las Vegas. During location filming, Ken Adam visited several funeral homes in the Las Vegas area, and the inspiration behind the gaudy design of the Slumber Mortuary, for example the use of tasteless Art Nouveau furniture and Tiffany lamps, came from these experiences. Production wrapped with the crematorium sequence, on 13 August 1971.
Since the car chase in Las Vegas would have many car crashes, the filmmakers had a product placement arrangement with Ford to use their vehicles. Ford&#x27;s only demand was that Sean Connery had to drive the 1971 Mustang Mach 1 which serves as Tiffany Case&#x27;s car. A Mustang was used in &quot;Goldfinger&quot; and &quot;Thunderball&quot;, while a Mercury Cougar was used in &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, and &quot;Bond girls&quot; drove each one. The moon buggy was inspired by the NASA lunar rover, but with additions such as flailing arms since the producers did not find the design &quot;outrageous&quot; enough. Built by custom car fabricator Dean Jeffries on a rear-engined Corvair chassis, it was capable of road speeds. The fibreglass tires had to be replaced during the chase sequence because the heat and irregular desert soil ruined them.

Hamilton had the idea of making a fight scene inside a lift, which was choreographed and performed by Sean Connery and stuntman Joe Robinson. During a car chase scene, where the police are chasing Bond in a small parking lot, the Mustang was to jump a small ramp over several cars. The stunt driver they had hired could not perform this and wrecked two or three cars in the process. The stunt team had only one automobile left so they called Bill Hickman, who drove for hours to the location, jumped into the Mustang, and did the stunt in one take. A continuity mistake during the same car chase made it into the film&#x27;s final cut: when Bond drives the Mustang on two wheels through a narrow alley, the car enters the alley on its right side tires and exits driving on its left side.

While filming the scene of finding Plenty O&#x27;Toole drowned in Tiffany&#x27;s swimming pool, Lana Wood actually had her feet loosely tied to a cement block on the bottom. Film crew members held a rope across the pool for her, with which she could lift her face out of the water to breathe between takes. The floor of the pool was sloped and the block would move deeper with each take. Eventually, Wood was submerged but was noticed by onlookers and rescued. Wood, a certified diver, took some water but remained calm during the ordeal, although she later said there had been some &quot;very uncomfortable moments and quite some struggling until they pulled me out.&quot;

===Music===
The original soundtrack was once again composed by John Barry, his sixth time composing for a Bond film. &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;, the title song, was the second James Bond theme to be performed by Shirley Bassey, after &quot;Goldfinger&quot; in 1964.

With Connery back in the lead role, the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; was played by an electric guitar in the somewhat unusual, blued gun barrel sequence accompanied with prismatic ripples of light, in the pre-credits sequence, and in a full orchestral version during a hovercraft sequence in Amsterdam.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Diamonds are Forever&quot; was released on 14 December 1971 in Munich, West Germany and on 16 December in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, before opening in 44 other cities in the United States, Canada and Europe on 17 December and 11 more cities in Japan, New Zealand and Europe on 18 December 1971. It grossed $2,242,557 in its opening six days worldwide, including $1,569,249 in its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, where it finished number one at the box office for the week. The film had its UK premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square on 30 December 1971. In its first 17 days in the United States and Canada to 2 January 1972 it grossed $16,238,915 and had grossed $8,330,000 overseas to the same date, for a worldwide total of $24,568,915, which United Artists claimed was a record in such a short period. After 31 days, it had grossed a record $36,647,251.

&quot;Diamonds are Forever&quot; was number one in the United States for seven consecutive weeks and went on to gross $116 million worldwide, of which $43 million was from the United States and Canada.

===Contemporary reviews===
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; noted, in a positive review, the irrelevance of the plot and &quot;moments of silliness&quot;, such as Bond driving a moon buggy with revolving antennae and flapping robot arms. He praised the Las Vegas car chase scene, particularly the segment when Bond drives the Ford Mustang on two wheels. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; enthusiastically praised the film as: Jay Cocks, reviewing for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, felt &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; was &quot;in some ways the best of the lot. It is by all odds the broadestwhich is to say wackiest, not sexiest.&quot; He praised Connery as &quot;a fine, forceful actor with an undeniable presence [who] turns his well-publicized contempt for the Bond character into some wry moments of self-parody. He is capable of doing better things, but whether he likes it or not, he is the perfect, the only James Bond.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote the film is &quot;not merely bad Bond, it is a bad movie. A disjointed script competes with, of all things, a lack of action for responsibility for this failure. The women are unappealing even to Bond, judging from his lack of ardor and the villains are hardly threatening.&quot;

Peter Schjeldahl of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; as &quot;a pretty good movienot great art, but fantastic packaging. The best (or, anyway, the best worst) of the classic formulaenotably, gimmickry and exoticism a go gohave been retained, some up‐dating elements have been added and other elements have been fudged.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that James Bond &quot;still packs a lethal wallop in all his cavortings, still manages to surround himself with scantily-clad sexpots. Yet &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; doesn&#x27;t carry the same quality or flair as its many predecessors. Apparently Messrs. Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, who have made a fortune producing these Ian Fleming-inspired mellers, have reached that point where a sustained story means little in prepping an 007 picture. That is what this latest in the series lacks, and for this reason there can be no suspense. But action there is, plenty of it in the familiar Bond manner.&quot;

The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound for Gordon McCallum, John W. Mitchell and Al Overton.

===Retrospective reviews===
Twenty-five years after the film&#x27;s release, James Berardinelli criticised the concept of a laser-shooting satellite, and the performances of Jill St. John, Norman Burton and Jimmy Dean. Christopher Null called St. John &quot;one of the least effective Bond girls – beautiful, but shrill and helpless&quot;.

According to Danny Peary, &quot;Diamonds are Forever&quot; is &quot;one of the most forgettable movies of the entire Bond series&quot; and that &quot;until Blofeld&#x27;s reappearance we must watch what is no better than a mundane diamond-smuggling melodrama, without the spectacle we associate with James Bond: the Las Vegas setting isn&#x27;t exotic enough, there&#x27;s little humour, assassins Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint are similar to characters you&#x27;d find on &quot;The Avengers&quot;, but not nearly as amusing – and the trouble Bond gets into, even Maxwell Smart could escape.&quot; IGN chose it as the third worst James Bond film, behind only &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; and &quot;Die Another Day&quot;.

&quot;Total Film&quot; listed Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, and Bambi and Thumper, as the first and second worst villains in the Bond series (respectively).
 The film was more positively received by Xan Brooks of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, who said it was &quot;oddly brilliant, the best of the bunch: the perfect bleary Bond film for an imperfect bleary western world.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 64% based on 53 reviews with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website&#x27;s consensus states, &quot;&quot;Diamonds are Forever&quot; is a largely derivative affair, but it&#x27;s still pretty entertaining nonetheless, thanks to great stunts, witty dialogue, and the presence of Sean Connery.&quot;

<doc id="157486" wikidata="Q372055" url="?curid=157486" title="Tommy (The Who album)">
<text>Tommy is the fourth studio album by the English rock band the Who, released on 19 May 1969. Written primarily by guitarist Pete Townshend, &quot;Tommy&quot; is a double album and an early rock opera that tells the story of the fictional Tommy Walker and his path to becoming a spiritual leader and messianic figure.

Townshend came up with the concept of &quot;Tommy&quot; after being introduced to the work of Indian spiritual teacher Meher Baba, and he attempted to translate Baba&#x27;s ideas into music. Recording of the album began in September 1968, but took six months to complete as material needed to be arranged and re-recorded in the studio. The Who promoted the album&#x27;s release with an extensive tour, including a live version of &quot;Tommy&quot;, which lasted throughout 1969 and 1970. Key gigs from the tour included appearances at Woodstock, the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival, the University of Leeds, the Metropolitan Opera House, and the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival. The live performances of &quot;Tommy&quot; drew critical praise and revitalised the band&#x27;s career. 

Upon its release, &quot;Tommy&quot; was acclaimed by critics, who hailed it as the Who&#x27;s breakthrough. Several writers view it as an important and influential album in the history of rock music. In 1998, &quot;Tommy&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

Subsequently, the rock opera was developed into other media, including a ballet in Montreal in 1970, a Seattle Opera production in 1971, an orchestral version by Lou Reizner in 1972, a film directed by Ken Russell and featuring Jack Nicholson and Oliver Reed in 1975, and a Broadway musical in 1992. 

&quot;Tommy&quot; has been reissued several times on CD, including a remix by Jon Astley in 1996, a deluxe Super Audio CD in 2003, and a super deluxe box set in 2013, including previously unreleased demos and live material.

==Synopsis==

&quot;Tommy&quot; tells the story of a fictional character named Tommy Walker. The following synopsis of &quot;Tommy&quot; was published following the original album&#x27;s release.

British Army Captain Walker goes missing during an expedition and is believed dead (&quot;Overture&quot;). His wife, Mrs. Walker, gives birth to their son, Tommy (&quot;It&#x27;s a Boy&quot;). Years later, Captain Walker returns home and discovers that his wife has found a new lover. The Captain kills the lover in front of Tommy. Tommy&#x27;s parents coerce Tommy into believing he did not see or hear anything. Tommy begins to disassociate and becomes deaf, dumb and blind to the outside world (&quot;1921&quot;). Tommy now relies on his sense of touch and imagination, developing an inner psyche (&quot;Amazing Journey/Sparks&quot;).

A doctor claims his wife can cure Tommy (&quot;The Hawker&quot;). Tommy&#x27;s parents are increasingly frustrated that he will never find religion in the midst of his isolation (&quot;Christmas&quot;). Tommy&#x27;s parents neglect him, leaving him to be tortured by his sadistic &quot;Cousin Kevin&quot; and sexually abused by his uncle Ernie (&quot;Fiddle About&quot;). The Hawker&#x27;s drug-addicted wife, &quot;The Acid Queen&quot;, gives Tommy a dose of LSD, causing a psychedelic experience that is expressed musically (&quot;Underture&quot;).

As Tommy grows older, he discovers that he can feel vibrations sufficiently well to become an expert pinball player (&quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;). His parents take him to a respected doctor (&quot;There&#x27;s a Doctor&quot;), who determines that the boy&#x27;s disabilities are psychosomatic rather than physical. Tommy is told by the Doctor to &quot;Go to the Mirror!&quot;, and his parents notice he can stare at his reflection. After seeing Tommy spend extended periods staring at a mirror in the house, his mother smashes it out of frustration (&quot;Smash the Mirror&quot;). This removes Tommy&#x27;s mental block, and he recovers his senses, realising he can become a powerful leader (&quot;Sensation&quot;). He starts a religious movement (&quot;I&#x27;m Free&quot;), which generates fervour among its adherents (&quot;Sally Simpson&quot;) and expands into a holiday camp (&quot;Welcome&quot; / &quot;Tommy&#x27;s Holiday Camp&quot;). However, Tommy&#x27;s followers ultimately reject his teachings and leave the camp (&quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot;). Tommy retreats inward again (&quot;See Me, Feel Me&quot;) with his &quot;continuing statement of wonder at that which encompasses him&quot;.

==Background==
Townshend had been looking at ways of progressing beyond the standard three-minute pop single format since 1966. Co-manager Kit Lambert shared Townshend&#x27;s views and encouraged him to develop musical ideas, conceiving the term &quot;rock opera&quot;. The first use of the term was applied to a suite called &quot;Quads&quot;, set in a future where parents could choose the sex of their children. A couple want four girls but instead receive three girls and a boy, raising him as a girl anyway. The opera was abandoned after writing a single song, the hit single, &quot;I&#x27;m a Boy&quot;. When the Who&#x27;s second album, &quot;A Quick One&quot;, ran short of material during recording, Lambert suggested that Townshend should write a &quot;mini-opera&quot; to fill the gap. Townshend initially objected, but eventually agreed to do so, coming up with &quot;A Quick One, While He&#x27;s Away&quot;, which joined short pieces of music together into a continuous narrative. During 1967, Townshend learned how to play the piano and began writing songs on it, taking his work more seriously. That year&#x27;s &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; included a mini-opera in the last track, &quot;Rael&quot;, which like &quot;A Quick One...&quot; was a suite of musical segments joined together.

By 1968, Townshend was unsure about how the Who should progress musically. The group were no longer teenagers, but he wanted their music to remain relevant. His friend, &quot;International Times&quot; art director Mike McInnerney, told him about the Indian spiritual mentor Meher Baba, and Townshend became fascinated with Baba&#x27;s values of compassion, love and introspection. The Who&#x27;s commercial success was on the wane after the single &quot;Dogs&quot; failed to make the top 20, and there was a genuine risk of the band breaking up. The group still performed well live and spent most of the spring and summer touring the US and Canada, but their stage act relied on Townshend smashing his guitar or Keith Moon demolishing his drums, which kept the group in debt. Townshend and Kit Lambert realised they needed a larger vehicle for their music than hit singles and a new stage show, and Townshend hoped to incorporate his love of Meher Baba into this concept. He decided that the Who should record a series of songs that stood well in isolation but formed a cohesive whole on the album. He also wanted the material performed in concert, to counter the trend of bands like the Beatles and the Beach Boys producing studio output that was not designed for live performance.

In August 1968, in an interview to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Townshend talked about a new rock opera and described the entire plot in great detail, which ran to 11 pages. The Who biographer Dave Marsh subsequently said the interview described the narrative better than the finished album. Townshend later regretted publishing so much detail, as he felt it forced him to write the album according to that blueprint. The rest of the Who, however, were enthusiastic about the idea, and let him have artistic control over the project.

==Recording==
The Who started recording the album at IBC Studios on 19 September 1968. There was no firm title at this point, which was variously referred to as &quot;Deaf, Dumb and Blind Boy&quot;, &quot;Amazing Journey&quot;, &quot;Journey into Space&quot;, &quot;The Brain Opera&quot; and &quot;Omnibus&quot;. Townshend eventually settled on &quot;Tommy&quot; because it was a common British name and a nickname for soldiers in the First World War. Kit Lambert took charge of the production, with Damon Lyon-Shaw as engineer. Sessions were block-booked from 2pm – 10pm, but recording often spilled over into the early morning. 

The album was recorded using an eight-track system, which allowed various instruments to be overdubbed. Townshend used several guitars in the studio but made particular use of the Gibson J-200 acoustic and the Gibson SG. As well as their usual instruments, Townshend played piano and organ and bassist John Entwistle doubled on french horn. Keith Moon used a new double bass drum kit owned by roadie Tony Haslam, after Premier had refused to loan him any more equipment due to the items repeatedly being abused. Though Townshend wrote the majority of the material, the arrangements came from the entire band. Singer Roger Daltrey later said that Townshend often came in with a half-finished demo recording, adding &quot;we probably did as much talking as we did recording, sorting out arrangements and things.&quot; Townshend asked Entwistle to write two songs (&quot;Cousin Kevin&quot; and &quot;Fiddle About&quot;) that covered the darker themes of bullying and abuse. &quot;Tommy&#x27;s Holiday Camp&quot; was Keith Moon&#x27;s suggestion of what kind of religious movement Tommy could lead. Moon got the songwriting credit for suggesting the idea, though the music was composed and played by Townshend. A significant amount of material had a lighter style than earlier recordings, with greater prominence put on the vocals. Moon later said, &quot;It was, at the time, very un-Wholike. A lot of the songs were soft. We never played like that.&quot;

Some of the material had already been written for other projects. &quot;Sensation&quot; was written about a girl Townshend had met on the Who&#x27;s tour of Australia in early 1968, &quot;Welcome&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Free&quot; were about peace found through Meher Baba and &quot;Sally Simpson&quot; was based on a gig with the Doors which was marred by violence. Other songs had been previously recorded by the Who and were recycled; &quot;It&#x27;s A Boy&quot; was derived from &quot;Glow Girl&quot;, an out-take from &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot;, while &quot;Sparks&quot; and &quot;Underture&quot; re-used and expanded one of the instrumental themes in &quot;Rael&quot;. &quot;Amazing Journey&quot; was, according to Townshend, &quot;the absolute beginning&quot; of the opera and summarised the entire plot. &quot;The Hawker&quot; was a cover of Sonny Boy Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Eyesight to the Blind&quot;. A cover of Mercy Dee Walton&#x27;s &quot;One Room Country Shack&quot; was also recorded but was scrapped from the final track listing as Townshend could not figure out a way to incorporate it in the plot.

Recording at IBC was slow, due to a lack of a full plot and a full selection of songs. The group hoped that the album would be ready by Christmas 1968, but sessions dragged on. &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Chris Welch visited IBC studios in November and while he was impressed with the working environment and the material, the project still did not have a title and there was no coherent plotline. The Who&#x27;s US record company, Decca Records, got so impatient waiting for new product that they released the compilation album &quot;Magic Bus: The Who on Tour&quot; which received a scathing review from Greil Marcus in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; over its poor selection of material and misleading name (as the album contained studio recordings and was not live).

The Who took a break from recording at the end of 1968 to tour, including a well received appearance at &quot;The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus&quot; on 10 December. They resumed sessions at IBC in January 1969, block booking Monday to Thursday, but had to do gigs every weekend to stop going further into debt. A major tour was booked for the end of April, and the group&#x27;s management insisted that the album would have to be finished by then, as it had been well over a year since &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot;. Kit Lambert wrote a script, &quot;Tommy (1914–1984)&quot;, which he professionally printed and gave copies to the band, helping them focus on the storyline and also deciding to make the album a double. The group were still coming up with new material; Lambert insisted that the piece should have a proper overture, while Townshend wrote &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; so that Nik Cohn, a pinball fan, would give the album a favourable review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Lambert wanted an orchestra to appear on the album, but Townshend was strongly against the idea, and time and budget constraints meant it could not happen anyway.

By March 1969, some songs had been recorded several times, yet Townshend still thought there were missing pieces. Entwistle had become fed up with recording, later saying &quot;we had to keep going back and rejuvenating the numbers ... it just started to drive us mad.&quot; The final recording session took place on 7 March, the same day that &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; was released as a single. The group started tour rehearsals and promotional activities for the single and Lambert went on holiday in Cairo. The mixing was left to Damon Lyon-Shaw and assistant engineer Ted Sharp, who did not think IBC was well suited for the task. The album overshot its April deadline, as stereo mastering continued into the end of the month.

==Release and reception==
After delays surrounding the cover artwork, &quot;Tommy&quot; was released on 19 May 1969 in the US by Decca and 23 May in the UK by Track Records. The original double album was configured with sides 1 and 4 on one disc, and sides 2 and 3 on the other, to accommodate record changers.

The album was commercially successful, reaching No. 2 in the UK album charts. It peaked at No. 7 in the US in 1969, but in 1970 it re-entered the charts, at which time it went on to peak at No. 4. It sold 200,000 copies in the first two weeks in the US alone and was awarded a gold record for sales of 500,000 on 18 August. &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Free&quot; and &quot;See Me, Feel Me&quot; were released as singles and received airplay on the radio. &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; reached the top 20 in the US and the top five in the UK. &quot;See Me, Feel Me&quot; reached the top 20 in the US and &quot;I&#x27;m Free&quot; reached the top 40. An EP of selections from the album was planned to be released in the UK in November 1970 but was withdrawn.

When it was released, critics were split between those who thought the album was a masterpiece, the beginnings of a new genre, and those that felt it was exploitative. The album had a hostile reception with the BBC and certain US radio stations, with Tony Blackburn describing &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; as &quot;distasteful&quot;. Nevertheless, BBC Radio 1 received an advance copy of the album at the start of May and gave the material its first airplay on Pete Drummond&#x27;s show on 3 May. Townshend promoted the album&#x27;s release with interviews in which he attempted to explain the plotline. Unfortunately, because it fundamentally dealt with the abstract concept of Meher Baba&#x27;s spiritual precepts, the interviews often gave confusing and contradictory details.

For &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Chris Welch went to the album&#x27;s press launch show at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s and although the volume left his ears ringing for 20 hours, he concluded &quot;we wanted more.&quot; &quot;Disc and Music Echo&quot; ran a front-page headline saying &quot;Who&#x27;s Tommy: A Masterpiece&quot;. Critics and fans were confused by the storyline, but Kit Lambert pointed out this made &quot;Tommy&quot; no less confusing than the operas of Richard Wagner or Giacomo Puccini a century earlier. In a 1969 column for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, music critic Robert Christgau said that, apart from the Mothers of Invention&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot;, &quot;Tommy&quot; is the first successful &quot;extended work&quot; in rock music, but Townshend&#x27;s parodic side is more &quot;profound and equivocal&quot; than Frank Zappa. He praised Townshend for deliberately constructing the album so that each song can be enjoyed individually and felt that he is determined to &quot;give his audience what it wants without burying his own peculiarity&quot;. Albert Goldman, writing in &quot;Life&quot; magazine, said that the Who play through &quot;all the kinky complications&quot; of the narrative in a hard rock style that is the antithesis of most contemporary &quot;serious&quot; rock. Goldman asserted that, based on innovation, performance, and &quot;sheer power&quot;, &quot;Tommy&quot; surpasses anything else in studio-recorded rock. Robert Christgau named &quot;Tommy&quot; the best album of 1969 in his year-end list for &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot; magazine.

== Legacy and reappraisal ==

According to music journalist Richie Unterberger, &quot;Tommy&quot; was hailed by contemporary critics as the Who&#x27;s breakthrough. Robert Christgau wrote in 1983, &quot;&quot;Tommy&quot;″s operatic pretensions were so transparent that for years it seemed safe to guess that Townshend&#x27;s musical ideas would never catch up with his lyrics.&quot; In his review for AllMusic, Unterberger said that, despite its slight flaws, the album has &quot;many excellent songs&quot; permeated with &quot;a suitably powerful grace&quot;, while Townshend&#x27;s ability to devise a lengthy narrative introduced &quot;new possibilities to rock music.&quot; &quot;Uncut&quot; wrote that the album &quot;doesn&#x27;t quite realise its ambitions, though it achieves a lot on the way&quot;, and felt it was not as well developed as their later album, &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;. Mark Kemp, writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), felt that &quot;in retrospect, &quot;Tommy&quot; isn&#x27;t quite the masterpiece it was originally hyped to be&quot;, suggesting &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; was better, though because of Townshend, it produced several &quot;bona fide classic songs&quot;. &quot;Rock opera may seem like a laughable concept these days, but when the Who brought it to the world via &quot;Tommy&quot; in 1969, it was an unmatched thrill&quot;, writes Mac Randall of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2004 in a more positive appraisal. &quot;Almost thirty-five years later, this classic-rock touchstone still has the power to enthrall.&quot;

In 1998, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for &quot;historical, artistic and significant value&quot;. In 2000 it was voted number 52 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Tommy&quot; number 96 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, it maintained the rating in a 2012 revised list, and was re-ranked at number 190 on the 2020 list. The album is one of several by the Who to appear in &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

According to music critic Martha Bayles, &quot;Tommy&quot; did not mix rock with classical music, as its &quot;rock opera&quot; title may have suggested, but instead was &quot;dominated by the Who&#x27;s mature style: ponderous, rhythmically monotonous hard rock&quot;. Bayles argued that it was more acceptable to audiences than the art rock &quot;concoctions&quot; of the time because of the cultural climate during the late 1960s: &quot;&quot;Tommy&quot; was considered more authentic, precisely because it consists of hard rock, rather than doctored-up Mussorgsky ... and avoids the typical pseudoromantic themes of art rock (fairy-tale bliss and apocalyptic angst) in favor of the more up-to-date subject of popular culture itself.&quot; &quot;High Fidelity&quot; magazine also characterised the Who&#x27;s album as a &quot;reasonably hard-rock version&quot; of the opera.

Dave Marsh thought the problem with the album&#x27;s narrative is that there isn&#x27;t enough transitional material provided by the lyrics. There are no stage directions, no cast, and narration is restricted to key phrases (such as &quot;Tommy can you hear me?&quot;) Key problems included an unclear explanation of what Tommy didn&#x27;t hear or see in &quot;1921&quot;, how or why he plays pinball, why &quot;Smash the Mirror&quot; leads into &quot;I overwhelm as I approach you&quot; (the opening line in &quot;Sensation&quot;), why Tommy tells his followers in &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot; they cannot drink or smoke but can play pinball, and what the &quot;you&quot; is in &quot;Listening to you, I get the music&quot;.

In 2013, Townshend and Daltrey participated in a documentary about the making of the album &quot;Tommy&quot;. The documentary is titled &quot;Sensation: The Story of the Who&#x27;s Tommy&quot; and features in-depth interviews with them.

==Editions and cover art==

&quot;Tommy&quot; was originally released as a two-LP set with artwork designed by Mike McInnerney, which included a booklet including lyrics and images to illustrate parts of the story. Townshend asked McInnerney to do the cover artwork for Tommy in September 1968. Townshend had originally considered Alan Aldridge for the cover. The cover is presented as part of a triptych-style fold-out cover, and the booklet contained abstract artwork that outlined the story. Although the album included lyrics to all the songs, indicating individual characters, it did not outline the plot, which led to a concert programme being prepared for shows, that carried a detailed synopsis.

Townshend thought Mike McInnerney, a fellow follower of Meher Baba, would be a suitable choice to do the cover. As recording was near completion, McInnerney received a number of cassettes with completed songs and a brief outline for the story, which he immediately recognised as being based on Baba&#x27;s teachings. He wanted to try and convey the world of a deaf, dumb and blind boy and decided to &quot;depict a kind of breaking out of a certain restricted plane into freedom.&quot; The finished cover contained a blue and white web of clouds, a fist punching into the black void to the left of it.

The inner triptych, meanwhile, showed a hand reaching out to light and a light shining in a dark void. Townshend was too busy finishing the recording to properly approve the artwork, but Kit Lambert strongly approved of it and said it would work. The final step was for record company approval from Polydor, making one concession that pictures of the band should appear on the cover. These were added to the globe on the front. These pictures were later removed on the 1996 CD remastered reissue.

&quot;Tommy&quot; was first released on CD in 1984 as a two disc set. Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab subsequently released a special single-disc edition of the album in 1990, featuring an alternate take of &quot;Eyesight to the Blind&quot; and a low volume extensive break on the glass in &quot;Smash the Mirror&quot;. It was also remastered by Erick Labson for single disc release in 1993. Polydor and MCA released a newly remastered version on single disc in 1996, which had been remixed by Jon Astley. Astley was able to access the original 8 track tapes and bring out instruments that had been buried, such as the guitar in &quot;Christmas&quot;, the French horn in &quot;Sparks&quot;, the cymbals in &quot;The Acid Queen&quot; and the organ in &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot;. This release came with Mike McInnerney&#x27;s complete artwork and a written introduction by Richard Barnes. For this edition, the cover was revised to remove the Who&#x27;s faces, which were originally placed at the request of the record label.

In 2003 &quot;Tommy&quot; was made available as a deluxe two-disc hybrid Super Audio CD with a 5.1 multi-channel mix. The remastering was done under the supervision of Townshend and also includes related material not on the original album, including &quot;Dogs-Part 2&quot; (the B-Side to &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;), &quot;Cousin Kevin Model Child&quot; and &quot;Young Man Blues&quot;, plus demos for the album and other unreleased songs that were dropped from the final running order. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; considered the disc sonically &quot;murkier&quot; than the 1996 CD and was critical of the absence of the original libretto. In 2013, a super deluxe version of &quot;Tommy&quot; was released as a 3-CD / Blu-ray box set. As well as the original album, the package includes additional demos and a live performance mostly taken from the Who&#x27;s show at the Capital Theatre, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada on 15 October 1969. The live disc was significant, as it debunked a long-standing myth that the tapes for the tour were burned in preference for the Leeds University show in February 1970 that made up &quot;Live at Leeds&quot;.

==Live performances==

The Who had planned to perform &quot;Tommy&quot; live since starting the project. The group spent April 1969 rehearsing a live version of the show at the Hanwell Community Centre in Ealing including a final run down of the entire stage piece on 23 April. The running order was changed, and four songs (&quot;Cousin Kevin&quot;, &quot;Underture&quot;, &quot;Sensation&quot; and &quot;Welcome&quot;) were dropped entirely. Townshend later said the group &quot;did the whole thing from start to finish and &quot;that&quot; was when we first realized we had something cohesive and playable.&quot; Roger Daltrey&#x27;s singing had improved substantially since the group&#x27;s early tours, and they realised their new live act could completely change their career.

After a few warm up gigs towards the end of April, the group gave a preview concert to the press at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club, London on 1 May. Realising the opera&#x27;s narrative was difficult to understand, Townshend explained a synopsis of the story, before the Who played &quot;Tommy&quot; all the way through at full stage volume. The next day, the group flew out to New York to start the US tour, with the first gig on 9 May at the Grande Ballroom, Detroit. At the end of May, the group played four nights at the Kinetic Playground, Chicago, and they noticed the audience would all stand up at the same time and stay standing. This indicated that live performances of &quot;Tommy&quot; had a significant positive response.

The group continued to play large halls in the US, organised by tour promoter Frank Barsalona, and generally avoided festivals, but made an important exception with the Woodstock festival on 16 August. After spending all night arguing with Barsalona, the band agreed to perform at Woodstock for $12,500. The festival ran late and the Who did not take to the stage until the early morning of 17 August. During &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;, Abbie Hoffman took to the stage to protest about the imprisonment of John Sinclair before being kicked offstage by Townshend, while during &quot;See Me, Feel Me&quot;, the sun rose, almost as if on cue. Two weeks later, the group played the second Isle of Wight Festival, using one of the largest live PAs available. Though media attention was on Bob Dylan playing his first major live concert since 1966, the Who stole the show. Townshend later said, &quot;We know that the stage act we had, with &quot;Tommy&quot; in it, would work under any circumstances, because it had worked many times on tour.&quot;
&quot;Tommy&quot; remained in the Who&#x27;s live set through the rest of the year and into 1970. In October 1969, the Who played six shows at the Fillmore East, where Leonard Bernstein praised them for their new music. The group&#x27;s show on 14 December at the London Coliseum was filmed for a possible future &quot;Tommy&quot; feature. Lambert was keen for &quot;Tommy&quot; to be taken seriously and wanted the Who to perform at opera houses. In June 1970, the group performed two shows at the Metropolitan Opera House, which was the first time Townshend announced the show as being the &quot;last &quot;Tommy&quot; ever&quot;. The group made a second trip to the Isle of Wight, appearing at the 1970 festival on 29 August, before an audience of 600,000. The last live performance for 1970 was at The Roundhouse, London on 20 December. Townshend said &quot;This is the very last time we&#x27;ll play &quot;Tommy&quot; on stage&quot;, to which Keith Moon promptly cried, &quot;Thank Christ for that!&quot;

Public reaction to the Who&#x27;s concerts that included &quot;Tommy&quot; was overwhelmingly positive. The touring helped keep the album in the public eye and cleared the band&#x27;s debts. Several live recordings of &quot;Tommy&quot; from the Who&#x27;s 1969–70 tours have been released. A complete performance is available on the 2002 &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; of the live album &quot;Live at Leeds&quot;, recorded on 14 February 1970. The second Isle of Wight performance is available on &quot;Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970&quot;, released in 1996. The Coliseum Theatre gig is available on the 2007 video release &quot;At Kilburn 1977 + Live at the Coliseum&quot;. Portions of the Woodstock performance of &quot;Tommy&quot; were released on the documentaries &quot;Woodstock&quot; and &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot;.
The Who continued to play a smaller selection of &quot;Tommy&quot; live in subsequent tours throughout the 1970s. They revived &quot;Tommy&quot; as a whole for its twentieth anniversary during their 1989 reunion tour, reinstating the previously overlooked &quot;Cousin Kevin&quot; and &quot;Sensation&quot; but still omitting &quot;Underture&quot; and &quot;Welcome&quot;. Recordings from this tour can be found on the &quot;Join Together&quot; live album and the &quot;Tommy and Quadrophenia Live&quot; DVD. The Los Angeles version of this show featured Phil Collins as Uncle Ernie, Patti LaBelle as the Acid Queen, Steve Winwood as the Hawker, Elton John as the Pinball Wizard, and Billy Idol as Cousin Kevin.

==Other incarnations==

===1970 Les Grands Ballets Canadiens ===
In 1970 Fernand Nault, choreographer of the Montreal ballet group Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, created the first dance-based adaptation of &quot;Tommy&quot;. The ballet was premiered in Montreal in October 1970 and obtained a real success. The performance toured New York in April 1971, which included a light show and accompanying films by the Quebec Film Bureau.

===1971 Seattle Opera production===
In 1971, the Seattle Opera under director Richard Pearlman produced the first ever fully staged professional production of &quot;Tommy&quot; at Seattle&#x27;s Moore Theatre. The production included Bette Midler playing the role of the Acid Queen and Mrs. Walker, and music by the Syracuse, New York band Comstock, Ltd.

===London Symphony Orchestra version===

On 9 December 1972, entrepreneur Lou Reizner presented a concert version of &quot;Tommy&quot; at the Rainbow Theatre, London. There were two performances that took place on the same evening. The concerts featured the Who, plus a guest cast, backed by the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by David Measham. The concerts were held to promote the release of Reizner&#x27;s new studio recording of this symphonic version of &quot;Tommy&quot;, released in October 1972.

The album and concerts featured an all-star cast, including Graham Bell (as the Lover), Maggie Bell (as the Mother), Sandy Denny (as the Nurse), Steve Winwood (as the Father), Rod Stewart (as the Local Lad), Richie Havens (as the Hawker), Merry Clayton (as the Acid Queen), and Ringo Starr (as Uncle Ernie). Townshend played some guitar, but otherwise the music was predominantly orchestral. Richard Harris played the role of the Doctor on the record, but he was replaced by Peter Sellers for the stage production. The stage show had a second run on 13 and 14 December 1973 with Daltrey, Graham Bell, Havens, and Clayton returning, and a new cast including David Essex (as the Narrator), Elkie Brooks (as the Mother), Roger Chapman (as the Father), Marsha Hunt (as the Nurse), Bill Oddie (as Cousin Kevin), Vivian Stanshall (as Uncle Ernie), Roy Wood (as the Local Lad), and Jon Pertwee (as the Doctor).

The orchestral version was also performed twice in Australia on 31 March 1973 at Melbourne&#x27;s Myer Music Bowl and on 1 April at Sydney&#x27;s Randwick Racecourse. Keith Moon appeared as Uncle Ernie (in Melbourne only), Graham Bell as the Narrator, with local stars Daryl Braithwaite (as Tommy), Billy Thorpe (as the Local Lad), Doug Parkinson (as the Hawker), Wendy Saddington (as the Nurse), Jim Keays (as the Lover), Broderick Smith (as the Father), Colleen Hewett (as the Mother), Linda George (as the Acid Queen), Ross Wilson (as Cousin Kevin), Bobby Bright (as the Doctor), and Ian Meldrum (as Uncle Ernie in Sydney), and a full orchestra. The Melbourne concert was videotaped, then televised by Channel 7 on 13 April 1973.

===1975 film===

In 1975 &quot;Tommy&quot; was adapted as a film, produced by expatriate Australian entrepreneur Robert Stigwood and directed by British auteur Ken Russell. The movie version starred Roger Daltrey as Tommy and featured the other members of the Who, plus a supporting cast that included Ann-Margret as Tommy&#x27;s mother and Oliver Reed as the Lover, with appearances by Elton John, Tina Turner, Eric Clapton, Arthur Brown, and Jack Nicholson. Russell insisted on having a known cast, though Townshend wanted people who could sing the material, and he was particularly disappointed at not being allowed to cast Stevie Wonder as the Pinball Wizard. In several cinemas, the film supported a multi-track soundtrack billed as quintaphonic sound, which placed speaker banks in the four quadrants of the house and directly behind the centre of the screen.

Townshend also oversaw the production of a soundtrack album, on which the unrecorded orchestral arrangements Kit Lambert had envisaged for the original &quot;Tommy&quot; LP were realised by the extensive use of synthesizer. He started work on the soundtrack album immediately after the Who&#x27;s 1973 US tour in December and worked on it almost continuously for the next four months. As well as the Who, the film&#x27;s music track and the original soundtrack LP also employed several session musicians including Caleb Quaye, Ronnie Wood, Nicky Hopkins, Chris Stainton, and longtime Who associate John &quot;Rabbit&quot; Bundrick. Due to Keith Moon&#x27;s commitments with the filming of &quot;Stardust&quot;, Kenney Jones (who would take over as the Who&#x27;s drummer after Moon&#x27;s death in 1978) played drums on much of the soundtrack album.

&quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; was a major hit when released as a single. This sequence in the film depicts Elton John being backed by the Who (dressed in pound-note suits); the band portrayed the Pinball Wizard&#x27;s band for filming, but on the music track and soundtrack album, the music was performed entirely by him and his regular touring band. Most of the extras were students at Portsmouth Polytechnic and were paid with tickets to a Who concert after filming wrapped.

The film and its soundtrack album featured six new songs, all written by Townshend, and an alteration to the running order compared to the original album. The CD reissue of the film soundtrack also included an additional Overture.

===Stage musical===

In 1991, Townshend broke his wrist in a cycling accident and could not play guitar. Looking for alternative work while recuperating, he responded to a request from the PACE Theatrical Group for the rights to a stage musical adaptation of &quot;Tommy&quot;. The group introduced him to La Jolla Playhouse director Des McAnuff, and the pair began to develop the musical together. It opened at La Jolla in summer 1992 and was an immediate commercial success. Townshend wrote a new song, &quot;I Believe My Own Eyes&quot;, to explain the relationship between Tommy&#x27;s parents, but otherwise tried to be faithful to the music on the original album.

The musical had a mixed response from critics, while Roger Daltrey and John Entwistle thought the show was too passive. Anthony DeCurtis, writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, said the orchestra drummer had &quot;the thankless task of having to reproduce Keith Moon&#x27;s parts&quot;. Townshend and Des McAnuff rewrote parts of the musical when it moved from La Jolla to Broadway, to show a darker side for the title character. McAnuff won a Tony Award in 1993 for Best Director, while Wayne Cilento won the award for Best Choreography. The Broadway run lasted from 1993 to 1995. McAnuff revisited &quot;Tommy&quot; during the 2013 season of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, and with Townshend&#x27;s input, staged a 2023 revival at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago, Illinois, which transferred to Broadway in 2024.

===Roger Daltrey live orchestral version===

In 2018, Daltrey toured the US performing the full version of &quot;Tommy&quot;, with members of the Who band and an orchestra conducted by Keith Levenson. To mark the 50th anniversary of the release of the original album, a recording of the live concert was released on 14 June 2019. This live album was performed in Bethel, New York, at the site of the original Woodstock festival, and a new orchestral backing recorded by Levenson in Hungary, with the Budapest Scoring Orchestra.

<text>Keith Richards (born 18 December 1943) is an English musician, songwriter, singer and record producer who is an original member, guitarist, secondary vocalist, and co-principal songwriter of the Rolling Stones. His songwriting partnership with the band&#x27;s lead vocalist Mick Jagger is one of the most successful in history. His career spans over six decades, and his guitar playing style has been a trademark of the Rolling Stones throughout the band&#x27;s career. Richards gained press notoriety for his romantic involvements and illicit drug use, and he was often portrayed as a countercultural figure. First professionally known as Keith Richard, by the early 1970s he had fully asserted his family name.

Richards was born in and grew up in Dartford, Kent. He studied at the Dartford Technical School and Sidcup Art College. After graduating, Richards befriended Jagger, Bill Wyman, Charlie Watts, Ian Stewart and Brian Jones and joined the Rolling Stones. As a member of the Rolling Stones, Richards also sings lead on some Stones songs. Richards typically sings lead on at least one song a concert, including &quot;Happy&quot;, &quot;Before They Make Me Run&quot;, and &quot;Connection&quot;. Outside of his career with the Rolling Stones, Richards has also played with his own side-project, The X-Pensive Winos. He also appeared in two &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; films as Captain Teague, father of Jack Sparrow, whose look and characterisation was inspired by Richards himself.

In 1989, Richards was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 2004 into the UK Music Hall of Fame with the Rolling Stones. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked him fourth on its list of 100 best guitarists in 2011. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; ranking was 15th. The magazine lists fourteen songs that Richards wrote with Jagger on its &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; list.

==Early life==
Richards was born on 18 December 1943 at Livingston Hospital, in Dartford, Kent, England. He is the only child of Doris Maud Lydia (née Dupree) and Herbert William Richards. His father was a factory worker who was wounded in the Second World War during the Normandy invasion. Richards&#x27;s paternal grandparents, Ernie and Eliza Richards, were socialists and civic leaders, whom he credited as &quot;more or less creat[ing] the Walthamstow Labour Party&quot;, and both were mayors of the Municipal Borough of Walthamstow in Essex, with Eliza becoming mayor in 1941. His great-grandfather&#x27;s family originated from Wales.

His maternal grandfather, Augustus Theodore &quot;Gus&quot; Dupree, who toured Britain with a jazz big band, Gus Dupree and His Boys, fostered Richards&#x27;s interest in the guitar. Richards has said that it was Dupree who gave him his first guitar. His grandfather &quot;teased&quot; the young Richards with a guitar that was on a shelf that Richards couldn&#x27;t reach at the time. Finally, Dupree told Richards that if Richards could reach the guitar, he could have it. Richards then devised all manner of ways of reaching the guitar, including putting books and cushions on a chair, until finally getting hold of the instrument, after which his grandfather taught him the rudiments of Richards&#x27;s first tune, &quot;Malagueña&quot;. He worked on the number &quot;like mad&quot;, and then his grandfather let him keep the guitar, which he called &quot;the prize of the century&quot;. Richards played at home, listening to recordings by Billie Holiday, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and others. His father, on the other hand, disparaged his son&#x27;s musical enthusiasm. One of Richards&#x27;s first guitar heroes was Elvis&#x27;s guitarist Scotty Moore.

Richards attended Wentworth Primary School with Mick Jagger and was his neighbour until 1954 when the Richards and Jagger families both moved. From 1955 to 1959, Richards attended Dartford Technical High School for Boys. He never sat the eleven-plus due to illness. Recruited by Dartford Tech&#x27;s choirmaster, R. W. &quot;Jake&quot; Clare, he sang in a trio of boy sopranos at, among other occasions, Westminster Abbey for Queen Elizabeth II. In 1959, Richards was expelled from Dartford Tech for truancy and transferred to Sidcup Art College, where he met Dick Taylor. At Sidcup, he was diverted from his studies proper and devoted more time to playing guitar with other students in the boys&#x27; room. At this point, Richards had learned most of Chuck Berry&#x27;s solos.

Richards met Jagger again by chance on a train platform when Jagger was heading for classes at the London School of Economics. The mail-order rhythm and blues albums from Chess Records by Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters that Jagger was carrying revealed a mutual interest and led to a renewal of their friendship. Along with mutual friend Dick Taylor, Jagger was singing in an amateur band, Little Boy Blue and the Blue Boys, which Richards soon joined. The Blue Boys folded when Brian Jones, after sharing thoughts on their joint interest in the blues music, invited Mick and Keith to the Bricklayers Arms pub, where they then met Ian Stewart.

By mid-1962, Richards had left Sidcup Art College to devote himself to music, and moved into a London flat with Jagger and Jones. His parents divorced at about the same time, resulting in his staying close to his mother and remaining estranged from his father until 1982.

After the Rolling Stones signed to Decca Records in 1963, the band&#x27;s manager, Andrew Loog Oldham, dropped the &quot;s&quot; from Richards&#x27;s surname, believing that Keith Richard, in his words, &quot;looked more pop&quot;, and that it would echo the name of the British rock and roll singer Cliff Richard. During the late 1970s, Richards re-established the &quot;s&quot; in his surname.

==Musicianship==
Richards plays both lead and rhythm guitar parts, often in the same song; the Stones are generally known for their guitar interplay of rhythm and lead (&quot;weaving&quot;) between him and the other guitarist in the band – Brian Jones (1962–1969), Mick Taylor (1969–1975), or Ronnie Wood (1975–present). In the recording studio Richards sometimes plays all of the guitar parts, notably on the songs &quot;Paint It Black&quot;, &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot;, &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;, and &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;. He is also a vocalist, singing backing vocals on many Rolling Stones songs as well as occasional lead vocals, such as on the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1972 single &quot;Happy&quot;, as well as with his side project, the X-Pensive Winos.

===Bandleader===
Since the mid-1960s, Richards and Mick Jagger have been the primary songwriters for the Stones, as well as the band&#x27;s primary producers since the mid-1970s (credited as the Glimmer Twins), often in collaboration with an outside producer. Former keyboardist Ian Stewart once said that Richards was the Rolling Stones&#x27; bandleader; Richards has said that his job is merely &quot;oiling the machinery&quot;. Unlike many bands where the drummer sets the pace and acts as a timesetter for a song, Richards fills that role for the Rolling Stones. Both former bassist Bill Wyman and current guitarist Ronnie Wood have said that the Stones did not follow the band&#x27;s long-time drummer, Charlie Watts, but rather followed Richards, as there was &quot;no way of &#x27;not&#x27; following&quot; him.

===Guitarist===

Chris Spedding calls Richards&#x27;s guitar playing &quot;direct, incisive and unpretentious&quot;. Richards says he focuses on chords and rhythms, avoiding flamboyant and competitive virtuosity and trying not to be the &quot;fastest gun in the west&quot;. Richards prefers teaming with at least one other guitarist and has almost never toured without one. Chuck Berry has been an inspiration for Richards, and, with Jagger, he introduced Berry&#x27;s songs to the Rolling Stones&#x27; early repertoire. In the late 1960s Brian Jones&#x27;s declining contributions led Richards to record all guitar parts on many tracks, including slide guitar. Jones&#x27;s replacement, Mick Taylor, played guitar with the Rolling Stones from 1969 to 1974. Taylor&#x27;s virtuosity on lead guitar led to a pronounced separation between lead and rhythm guitar roles, most notably onstage. In 1975 Taylor was replaced by Wood, whose arrival marked a return to a guitar interplay Richards called &quot;the ancient art of weaving&quot;, which he and Jones had gleaned from Chicago blues.

A break in touring during 1967–1968 allowed Richards to experiment with open tunings. He mainly used open tunings for fingered chording, developing a distinctive style of syncopated and ringing I–IV chording heard on &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; and &quot;Start Me Up&quot;. Richards&#x27;s favouredbut not exclusively usedopen tuning is a five-string open G tuning: GDGBD. Richards often removes the lowest string from his guitar, playing with only five strings and letting the band&#x27;s bass player pick up those notes, as the lower string just &quot;gets in the way&quot; of Richards&#x27;s playing. Several of his Telecasters are tuned this way. This tuning is prominent on Rolling Stones recordings, including &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot;, &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;, and &quot;Start Me Up&quot;. Richards has stated that banjo tuning was the inspiration for this tuning.

Richards regards acoustic guitar as the basis for his playing, believing that the limitations of electric guitar would cause him to &quot;lose that touch&quot; if he stopped playing an acoustic. Richards plays acoustic guitar on many Rolling Stones tracks, including &quot;Play with Fire&quot;, &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;, and &quot;Angie&quot;. All guitars on the studio versions of &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; and &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; feature acoustic guitars overloaded to a cassette recorder, then re-amped through a loudspeaker in the studio.

===Vocals===
Richards sang in a school choirmost notably for Queen Elizabeth IIuntil adolescence&#x27;s effect on his voice forced him out of it. He has sung backing vocals on every Rolling Stones album. Since &quot;Between the Buttons&quot; (1967), he has sung lead or co-lead on at least one track (see list below) of every Rolling Stones studio album except &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;, &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot;, and &quot;Blue &amp; Lonesome&quot;.

He has sung lead on more than ten Rolling Stones songs, including &quot;Happy&quot;, &quot;You Got the Silver&quot;, and &quot;Connection&quot;. During the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1972 tour, the Richards-sung &quot;Happy&quot; entered into their concert repertoire, and since then he has sung lead vocals on one or two songs each concert in order to give Jagger time to change his outfit. Keith usually starts with Max Miller routines such as &quot;It&#x27;s nice to be hereit&#x27;s nice to be anywhere&quot;, in order to give the audience a moment to catch its proverbial breath. During the 2006 and 2007 Rolling Stones&#x27; tours, Richards sang &quot;You Got the Silver&quot; (1969) without playing any instrument.

==Songwriting==

Richards and Jagger began writing songs together in 1963, prompted by manager Andrew Loog Oldham, who believed the band could not depend on outside songwriters. The earliest Jagger/Richards collaborations were recorded by other artists, including Gene Pitney, whose rendition of &quot;That Girl Belongs to Yesterday&quot; was their first top-ten single in the UK. They scored another top-ten hit in 1964 with the debut single written for Marianne Faithfull, &quot;As Tears Go By&quot;.

The first top-ten hit for the Rolling Stones with a Jagger and Richards original was &quot;The Last Time&quot; in early 1965; &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot; (also 1965) was their first international number-one recording. Richards has stated that the &quot;Satisfaction&quot; riff came to him in his sleep; he woke up just long enough to record it on a cassette player by his bed. Since &quot;Aftermath&quot; (1966) most Rolling Stones albums have consisted mainly of Jagger and Richards originals. Their songs reflect the influence of blues, R&amp;B, rock and roll, pop, soul, gospel, and country, as well as forays into psychedelia and Dylanesque social commentary. Their work in the 1970s and beyond has incorporated elements of funk, disco, reggae, and punk. Richards has also written and recorded slow torchy ballads, such as &quot;You Got the Silver&quot; (1969), &quot;Coming Down Again&quot; (1973), &quot;All About You&quot; (1980) and &quot;Slipping Away&quot; (1989). His songwriting partnership with Mick Jagger is one of the most successful in history.

In his solo career, Richards has often shared co-writing credits with drummer and co-producer Steve Jordan. Richards has stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve always thought songs written by two people are better than those written by one. You get another angle on it.&quot;

Richards has frequently expressed that he feels less like a creator than a conduit when writing songs: &quot;I don&#x27;t have that God aspect about it. I prefer to think of myself as an antenna. There&#x27;s only one song, and Adam and Eve wrote it; the rest is a variation on a theme.&quot; Richards was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1993.

==Record production==
Richards has been active as a music producer since the 1960s. He was credited as producer and musical director on the 1966 album &quot;Today&#x27;s Pop Symphony&quot;, one of manager Andrew Loog Oldham&#x27;s side projects, although there are doubts about how much Richards was actually involved with it. On the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1967 album &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;, the entire band was credited as producer, but since 1974, Richards and Mick Jagger have frequently co-produced both Rolling Stones records and those by other artists under the name &quot;the Glimmer Twins&quot;, often in collaboration with other producers.

In early 1973, Jagger and Richards developed an interest in the band Kracker, resulting in a deal whereby the band&#x27;s second album was licensed for distribution outside the United States by Rolling Stones Records, making Kracker the first band on that label.

Since the 1980s Richards has chalked up numerous production and co-production credits on projects with other artists including Aretha Franklin, Johnnie Johnson, and Ronnie Spector, as well as on his own albums with the X-Pensive Winos (see below). In the 1990s Richards co-produced and added guitar and vocals to a recording of nyabinghi Rastafarian chanting and drumming entitled &quot;Wingless Angels&quot;, released on Richards&#x27;s own record label, Mindless Records, in 1997.

===Solo recordings===
Richards has released few solo recordings. His first solo single, released in 1978, was a cover of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Run Rudolph Run&quot;, backed with his version of Jimmy Cliff&#x27;s &quot;The Harder They Come&quot;. In 1987, after Jagger pursued a solo recording and touring career, Richards formed the &quot;X-Pensive Winos&quot; with co-songwriter and co-producer Steve Jordan, whom Richards assembled for his Chuck Berry documentary &quot;Hail! Hail! Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;.

Additional members of the X-Pensive Winos included guitarist Waddy Wachtel, saxophonist Bobby Keys, keyboardist Ivan Neville, and Charley Drayton on bass. The first Winos&#x27; record, &quot;Talk Is Cheap&quot;, also featured Bernie Worrell, Bootsy Collins, and Maceo Parker. Since its release, &quot;Talk Is Cheap&quot; has gone gold and has sold consistently. Its release was followed by the first of the two US tours Richards has done as a solo artist. &quot;Live at the Hollywood Palladium, 15 December 1988&quot; documents the first of these tours. In 1992 the Winos&#x27; second studio record, &quot;Main Offender&quot;, was released, also followed by a tour. Although the Winos featured on both albums, the albums were credited to Richards as a solo artist.

A third Richards album, &quot;Crosseyed Heart&quot;, was released in September 2015.

===Recordings with other artists===
During the 1960s, most of Richards&#x27;s recordings with artists other than the Rolling Stones were sessions for Andrew Loog Oldham&#x27;s Immediate Records label. Notable exceptions were when Richards, along with Mick Jagger and numerous other guests, sang on the Beatles&#x27; 1967 TV broadcast of &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;, and when he played bass with John Lennon, Eric Clapton, Mitch Mitchell, Ivry Gitlis, and Yoko Ono as the Dirty Mac for &quot;The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus&quot; TV special filmed in 1968.

In the 1970s, Richards worked outside the Rolling Stones with Ronnie Wood on several occasions, contributing guitar, piano, and vocals to Wood&#x27;s first two solo albums and joining him on stage for two July 1974 concerts to promote &quot;I&#x27;ve Got My Own Album to Do&quot;. In December 1974 Richards also made a guest appearance at a Faces concert. During 1976 and 1977, Richards both co-produced and played on John Phillips&#x27;s solo recording &quot;Pay Pack &amp; Follow&quot; (released in 2001). In 1979 he toured the US with the New Barbarians, the band that Wood put together to promote his album &quot;Gimme Some Neck&quot;; he and Wood also contributed guitar and backing vocals to &quot;Truly&quot; on Ian McLagan&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;Troublemaker&quot; (re-released in 2005 as &quot;Here Comes Trouble&quot;).

Since the 1980s, Richards has made more frequent guest appearances. In 1981 he played on reggae singer Max Romeo&#x27;s album &quot;Holding Out My Love to You&quot;. He has worked with Tom Waits on three occasions: adding guitar and backing vocals to Waits&#x27;s album &quot;Rain Dogs&quot; (1985); co-writing, playing on, and sharing the lead vocal on &quot;That Feel&quot; on &quot;Bone Machine&quot; (1992); and adding guitar and vocals to &quot;Bad As Me&quot; (2011). In 1986 Richards produced and played on Aretha Franklin&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; and served as musical producer and band leader (or, as he phrased it, &quot;S&amp;M director&quot;) for the Chuck Berry film &quot;Hail! Hail! Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;.

In the 1990s and 2000s, Richards continued to contribute to a wide range of musical projects as a guest artist. A few of the notable sessions he has done include guitar and vocals on Johnnie Johnson&#x27;s 1991 release &quot;Johnnie B. Bad&quot;, which he also co-produced; and lead vocals and guitar on &quot;Oh Lord, Don&#x27;t Let Them Drop That Atomic Bomb on Me&quot; on the 1992 Charles Mingus tribute album &quot;Weird Nightmare&quot;. He duetted with country legend George Jones on &quot;Say It&#x27;s Not You&quot; on the &quot;Bradley Barn Sessions&quot; (1994); a second duet from the same sessions, &quot;Burn Your Playhouse Down&quot;, appeared on Jones&#x27;s 2008 release &quot;Burn Your Playhouse Down – The Unreleased Duets&quot;. He partnered with Levon Helm on &quot;Deuce and a Quarter&quot; for Scotty Moore&#x27;s album &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; (1997). His guitar and lead vocals are featured on the Hank Williams tribute album &quot;Timeless&quot; (2001) and on veteran blues guitarist Hubert Sumlin&#x27;s album &quot;About Them Shoes&quot; (2005). Richards also added guitar and vocals to Toots &amp; the Maytals&#x27; recording of &quot;Careless Ethiopians&quot; for their 2004 album &quot;True Love&quot;, which won the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album. Additionally, in December 2007 Richards released a download-only Christmas single via iTunes of &quot;Run Rudolph Run&quot;; and the B-side was a 2003 recorded version of the famous reggae song &quot;Pressure Drop&quot; featuring Toots Hibbert singing with Richards backed by original Maytals band members Jackie Jackson and Paul Douglas.

===Rare and unreleased recordings===
In 2005, the Rolling Stones released &quot;Rarities 1971–2003&quot;, which includes some rare and limited-issue recordings, but Richards has described the band&#x27;s released output as the &quot;tip of the iceberg&quot;. Many of the band&#x27;s unreleased songs and studio jam sessions are widely bootlegged, as are numerous Richards solo recordings, including his 1977 Toronto studio sessions, some 1981 studio sessions, and tapes made during his 1983 wedding trip to Mexico.

==Public image and personal life==

===Relationships and family===
Richards began dating model and actress Anita Pallenberg in 1967, on a trip to Morocco. She had previously been involved with his band mate Brian Jones, who was originally supposed to go to Morocco but ultimately did not after falling ill, and news of their relationship affected Jones deeply. Together, they had three children: Marlon Leon Sundeep Richards (b. 10 August 1969), Dandelion Angela Richards (b. 17 April 1972), and Tara Jo Jo Gunne Richards (26 March 1976 - 6 June 1976). Marlon was named after American actor Marlon Brando and Tara was named after British heir Tara Browne and the Chuck Berry song &quot;Jo Jo Gunne&quot;. Tara died from SIDS while Richards was on tour, something he said haunted him. He defended his decision to perform hours after learning of Tara&#x27;s death, explaining that in 2015 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; that performing was the only way he could cope. He and Pallenberg broke up in 1979 and remained cordial. 

Richard met model Patti Hansen in 1979 and they married on 18 December 1983, Richard&#x27;s 40th birthday. Together, they have two children, Theodora Dupree Richards (b. 18 March 1985) and Alexandra Nicole Richards (b. 28 July 1986), both born in New York City. Theodora was named after Richards&#x27; grandfather, Theodore Augustus Dupree.

Richards has seven grandchildren.

In September 2014, Richards published a children&#x27;s book with Theodora, &quot;Gus and Me: The Story of My Granddad and My First Guitar&quot;, based on Richards&#x27;s grandfather.

====Friendship with Mick Jagger====

Richards&#x27;s relationship with bandmate Mick Jagger is frequently described as &quot;love/hate&quot; by the media. Richards himself said in a 1998 interview: &quot;I think of our differences as a family squabble. If I shout and scream at him, it&#x27;s because no one else has the guts to do it or else they&#x27;re paid not to do it. At the same time I&#x27;d hope Mick realises that I&#x27;m a friend who is just trying to bring him into line and do what needs to be done.&quot; Richards, along with Johnny Depp, tried unsuccessfully to persuade Jagger to appear in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot;, alongside Depp and Richards.

Richards&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Life&quot;, was published on 26 October 2010. Eleven days prior to its release, the Associated Press published an article stating that in the book Richards refers to Jagger as &quot;unbearable&quot; and notes that their relationship has been strained &quot;for decades&quot;. His opinion softening by 2015, Richards still said Jagger could come off as a &quot;snob&quot; but added, &quot;I still love him dearly ... your friends don&#x27;t have to be perfect.&quot;

===Drug use and arrests===
Music journalist Nick Kent attached to Richards Lord Byron&#x27;s epithet of &quot;mad, bad, and dangerous to know.&quot; Jagger thought that Richards&#x27;s image had &quot;contributed to him becoming a junkie&quot;. In 1994, Richards said his image was &quot;like a long shadow ... Even though that was nearly twenty years ago, you cannot convince some people that I&#x27;m not a mad drug addict.&quot;

Richards&#x27;s notoriety for illicit drug use stems in part from several drug busts during the late 1960s and 1970s and his candour about using heroin and other substances. Richards has been tried on drug-related charges five times: in 1967, twice in 1973, in 1977, and in 1978. The first trialthe only one culminating in a prison sentence – resulted from a February 1967 police raid on Redlands, Richards&#x27;s Sussex estate, where he and some friends, including Jagger, were spending the weekend. The subsequent arrest of Richards and Jagger put them on trial before the British courts, whilst also trying them in the court of public opinion. On 29 June 1967, Jagger was sentenced to three months&#x27; imprisonment for possession of four amphetamine tablets. Richards was found guilty of allowing cannabis to be smoked on his property and sentenced to one year in prison. Both Jagger and Richards were imprisoned at that point: Jagger was taken to Brixton Prison in south London, and Richards to Wormwood Scrubs Prison in west London. Both were released on bail the next day pending appeal. On 1 July, &quot;The Times&quot; ran an editorial entitled &quot;Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?&quot;, portraying Jagger&#x27;s sentence as persecution, and public sentiment against the convictions increased. A month later the appeals court overturned Richards&#x27;s conviction for lack of evidence, and gave Jagger a conditional discharge.

On 27 February 1977, while Richards was staying in a Toronto hotel, then known as the Harbour Castle Hilton on Queen&#x27;s Quay East, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police found heroin in his room and charged him with &quot;possession of heroin for the purpose of trafficking&quot;an offence that at that time could result in prison sentences of seven years to life under the Narcotic Control Act. His passport was confiscated, and Richards and his family remained in Toronto until 1 April, when Richards was allowed to enter the United States on a medical visa for treatment of heroin addiction. The charge against him was later reduced to &quot;simple possession of heroin&quot;.

For the next two years, Richards lived under threat of criminal sanction. Throughout this period he remained active with the Rolling Stones, recording their biggest-selling studio album, &quot;Some Girls&quot;, and touring North America. Richards was tried in October 1978, pleading guilty to possession of heroin. He was given a suspended sentence and put on probation for one year, with orders to continue treatment for heroin addiction and to perform a benefit concert on behalf of the Canadian National Institute for the Blind after a blind fan testified on his behalf. Although the prosecution had filed an appeal of the sentence, Richards performed two CNIB benefit concerts at Oshawa Civic Auditorium on 22 April 1979; both shows featured the Rolling Stones and the New Barbarians. In September 1979, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the original sentence.

In 2016, he stated that he still occasionally drinks alcohol and consumes hashish and cannabis. In 2022, he revealed that he quit smoking in 2020.

===Other details===
Richards owns Redlands, a Sussex estate he purchased in 1966, as well as homes in Weston, Connecticut, and in the private resort island of Parrot Cay, Turks &amp; Caicos. His primary home is in Weston. In June 2013, Richards said that he would retire with his family to Parrot Cay or Jamaica if he knew his death was coming. However, in November 2016, he said, &quot;I&#x27;d like to croak magnificently, onstage.&quot; Richards is an avid reader with a strong interest in history, and owns an extensive library. An April 2010 article revealed that Richards yearns to be a librarian.

Richards is fond of shepherd&#x27;s pie, a British traditional dish. Stuart Cable recollected that while drummer for the Stereophonics, he was confronted by Richards because he had served himself a piece of the shepherd&#x27;s pie meant for Richards. The dish was also mentioned by Richards in his autobiography, advising readers to add more onions after cooking the meat filling to enhance the pie&#x27;s flavour.

==21st century==
On 27 April 2006, while in Fiji, Richards slipped off the branch of a dead tree (erroneously reported by the international press as a coconut tree) and suffered a head injury. He subsequently underwent cranial surgery at a New Zealand hospital. The incident delayed the Rolling Stones&#x27; 2006 European tour for six weeks and forced the band to reschedule several shows. The revised tour schedule included a brief statement from Richards apologising for &quot;falling off my perch&quot;. The band made up most of the postponed dates in 2006, and toured Europe in 2007 to make up the remainder. In a video message in late 2013 as part of the On Fire tour, Richards gave his thanks to the surgeons in New Zealand who treated him, remarking, &quot;I left half my brain there.&quot;

In August 2006, Richards was granted a pardon by Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee for a 1975 reckless driving citation.

Actor Johnny Depp has stated that his character in the movie franchise &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; is loosely based on Richards and the Warner Bros. cartoon character Pepe Le Pew, with both serving as the inspiration for the manner of the character. This combination of influences originally raised concerns with Disney corporate executives, who questioned if the character was supposed to be drunk and gay, with Michael Eisner fearing that he was &quot;ruining the movie&quot;. In the third installment of the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; series, &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot;, Richards played Captain Edward Teague, later reprising the role in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot;, the fourth film in the series (2011).

In 2012, Richards joined the 11th annual Independent Music Awards judging panel to assist independent musicians&#x27; careers.

In a 2015 interview with the New York &quot;Daily News&quot;, Richards expressed his dislike for rap and hip hop, deeming them for &quot;tone deaf&quot; people and consisting of &quot;a drum beat and somebody yelling over it&quot;. In the same interview he called Metallica and Black Sabbath &quot;great jokes&quot; and bemoaned the lack of syncopation in most rock and roll, claiming it &quot;sounds like a dull thud to me&quot;. He also said he stopped being a Beatles fan in 1967 when they visited the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, but this did not prevent him from playing bass in John Lennon&#x27;s pickup band The Dirty Mac for a performance of the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Yer Blues&quot; in the Stones&#x27; &quot;Rock and Roll Circus&quot; in December 1968.

For the weekend of 23 September 2016, Richards, together with director Julien Temple, curated and hosted a three-night programme on BBC Four titled &quot;Lost Weekend&quot;. Richards&#x27;s choices consisted of his favourite 1960s comedy shows, cartoons and thrillers, interspersed with interviews, rare musical performances and night imagery. This &#x27;televisual journey&#x27; was the first of its kind on British TV. Temple also directed a documentary, &quot;The Origin of the Species&quot;, about Richards&#x27;s childhood in post-war England and his musical roots.

===Tributes for other artists===
From the start of his career, Richards has made appearances to pay tribute to those artists with whom he has formed friendships and those who have inspired and encouraged him. After the earliest success of the band, who played cover songs of American blues artists, while he and Jagger were just beginning their own songwriting, the Rolling Stones visited the States to pay back, in his words, &quot;that&#x27;s where that fame bit comes in handy&quot;. Since that time, he has performed on many occasions to show appreciation toward them. Among these, he has appeared with Norah Jones in a tribute concert for Gram Parsons in 2006, playing guitar and singing a duet, &quot;Love Hurts&quot;. On 12 March 2007 Richards attended the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame ceremony to induct the Ronettes; he also played guitar during the ceremony&#x27;s all-star jam session. On 26 February 2012 Richards paid tribute to fellow musicians Chuck Berry and Leonard Cohen, who were the recipients of the first annual PEN Awards for songwriting excellence at the JFK Presidential Library in Boston, Massachusetts.

Richards is interviewed on screen and appears in performance footage in the 2005 documentary film &quot;Make It Funky!&quot;, which presents a history of New Orleans music and its influence on rhythm and blues, rock and roll, funk and jazz. In the film, Richards said that New Orleans musicians &quot;put the roll into rock&quot;. He also performed the Fats Domino song &quot;I&#x27;m Ready&quot; with the house band.

In an April 2007 interview for &quot;NME&quot; magazine, music journalist Mark Beaumont asked Richards what the strangest thing he ever snorted was, and quoted him as replying: &quot;My father. I snorted my father. He was cremated and I couldn&#x27;t resist grinding him up with a little bit of blow. My dad wouldn&#x27;t have cared ... It went down pretty well, and I&#x27;m still alive.&quot; In the media uproar that followed, Richards&#x27;s manager said that the anecdote had been meant as a joke; Beaumont told &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine that the interview had been conducted by international telephone and that he had misquoted Richards at one point (reporting that Richards had said he listens to Motörhead, when what he had said was Mozart), but that he believed the ash-snorting anecdote was true. Musician Jay Farrar from the band Son Volt wrote a song titled &#x27;Cocaine And Ashes&#x27;, which was inspired by Richards&#x27;s drug habits. The incident was also referenced in the 2017 song &quot;Mr Charisma&quot; by The Waterboys, featuring the lyrics: &quot;Hey Mr Charisma, what will your next trick be? Slagging Sgt Pepper, snorting your old man&#x27;s bones, or falling out of a tree?&quot;

Doris Richards, his mother, died of cancer at the age of 91 in England on 21 April 2007. An official statement released by a family representative stated that Richards kept a vigil by her bedside during her last days.

Richards made a cameo appearance as Captain Teague, the father of Captain Jack Sparrow (played by Johnny Depp), in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;, released in May 2007, and won the Best Celebrity Cameo award at the 2007 Spike Horror Awards for the role.
Depp has stated that he based many of Sparrow&#x27;s mannerisms on Richards. Richards reprised his role in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot;, released in May 2011.
In March 2008, the fashion house Louis Vuitton unveiled an advertising campaign featuring a photo of Richards with his ebony Gibson ES-355, taken by photographer Annie Leibovitz. Richards donated the fee for his involvement to the Climate Project, an organisation for raising environmental awareness.

On 28 October 2008, Richards appeared at the Musicians&#x27; Hall of Fame induction ceremony in Nashville, Tennessee, joining the newly inducted the Crickets on stage for performances of &quot;Peggy Sue&quot;, &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, and &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot;.

In August 2009, Richards was ranked at No. 4 in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 10 best electric guitar players of all time. In September 2009 Richards told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine that in addition to anticipating a new Rolling Stones album, he had done some recording with Jack White: &quot;I enjoy working with Jack&quot;, he said. &quot;We&#x27;ve done a couple of tracks.&quot; On 17 October 2009 Richards received the Rock Immortal Award at Spike TV&#x27;s Scream 2009 awards ceremony at the Greek Theatre, Los Angeles; the award was presented by Johnny Depp. &quot;I liked the living legend, that was all right&quot;, Richards said, referring to an award he received in 1989, &quot;but immortal is even better.&quot;

In 2009, a book of Richards&#x27;s quotations was published, titled &quot;What Would Keith Richards Do?: Daily Affirmations from a Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Survivor&quot;.

In August 2007, Richards signed a publishing deal for his autobiography, &quot;Life&quot;, which was released on 26 October 2010.

Richards appeared in the 2011 documentary &quot;Toots and the Maytals: Reggae Got Soul&quot;, which was featured on the BBC and described as &quot;the untold story of one of the most influential artists ever to come out of Jamaica&quot;.
== Honours ==
In 2010, David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine referred to Richards as the creator of &quot;rock&#x27;s greatest single body of riffs&quot; on guitar, and the magazine ranked him fourth on its list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also lists fourteen songs he co-wrote with Jagger on its &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; list.

In 2023, Tom Waits honored his friend with a poem, &quot;Burnt Toast To Keith&quot;. That same year, Richards was honoured in Dartford with a statue.

==Musical equipment==
===Guitars===
Richards has a collection of approximately 3,000 guitars. Even though he has used many different guitar models, Richards joked in a 1986 &quot;Guitar World&quot; interview that, no matter what model he plays, &quot;[G]ive me five minutes and I&#x27;ll make &#x27;em all sound the same.&quot; Richards has often thanked Leo Fender, and other guitar manufacturers for making the instruments, as he did during the induction ceremony of the Rolling Stones into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
===Amplifiers===
Richards&#x27;s amplifier preferences have changed repeatedly. However, he is a long-time proponent of using low-powered amps in the studio. He achieves clarity plus distortion by using two amps: a larger one (such as a Fender Twin) which runs clean, along with a Fender Champ, which is overdriven. To record &quot;Crosseyed Heart&quot;, Richards used a stock tweed Fender Champ with 8&quot; speaker coupled with a modified Fender Harvard.

Some of his notable amplifiers are:
*Mesa/Boogie Mark 1 A804Used between 1977 and 1993, this 100-watt 1x12&quot; combo is finished in hardwood with a wicker grille. It can be heard on the Rolling Stones albums &quot;Love You Live&quot;, &quot;Some Girls&quot;, &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot;, and &quot;Tattoo You&quot;, as well as on Richards&#x27;s two solo albums, &quot;Talk is Cheap&quot; and &quot;Main Offender&quot;. This amplifier was handcrafted by Randall Smith and delivered to Richards in March 1977.
*Fender TwinSince the 1990s, Richards has tended to use a variety of Fender &quot;tweed&quot; Twins on stage. Containing a pair of 12&quot; speakers, the Fender Twin was, by 1958, an 80-watt all-tube guitar amplifier. Richards has utilised a pair of Fender Twins &quot;to achieve his signature clean/dirty rhythm and lead sound.&quot;
*Fender Dual ShowmanFirst acquired in 1964. Richards made frequent use of his blackface Dual Showman amp through mid-1966. Used to record &quot;The Rolling Stones, Now!&quot;, &quot;Out of Our Heads&quot;, &quot;December&#x27;s Children&quot;, and &quot;Aftermath&quot; before switching over to various prototype amplifiers from Vox in 1967 and the fairly new Hiwatt in 1968.
*Ampeg SVTWith 350 watts, the Ampeg SVT amp&#x27;s midrange control, midrange shift switch, input pads, treble control with bright switch shaped the guitar sound of 1970s live Stones. Used live by the Stones for guitar, bass, and organ (Leslie) from 1969 to 1978. For a brief period in 1972 and 1973, Ampeg V4 and VT40 amps shared duties in the studio with Fender Twin and Deluxe Reverb amps.

===Effects===
In 1965, Richards used a Gibson Maestro fuzzbox to achieve the distinctive tone of his riff on &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot;; the success of the resulting single boosted the sales of the device to the extent that all available stock had sold out by the end of 1965. In the 1970s and early 1980s Richards frequently used guitar effects such as a wah-wah pedal, a phaser, and a Leslie speaker, but he has mainly relied on combining &quot;the right amp with the right guitar&quot; to achieve the sound he wants.

<doc id="157495" wikidata="Q315251" url="?curid=157495" title="Nicola Abbagnano">
<text>Nicola Abbagnano (; 15 July 1901 – 9 September 1990) was an Italian existential philosopher.

== Life ==
Nicola Abbagnano was born in Salerno on 15 July 1901. He was the first-born son of a middle-class professional family. His father was a practicing lawyer in the area. He studied in Naples, and in November 1922 obtained a degree in philosophy, his thesis that became the subject of his first book &quot;Le sorgenti irrazionali del pensiero&quot; (1923). His mentor was Antonio Aliotta. In the following years, he taught philosophy and history at the Liceo Umberto I°, in Naples, and from 1917 to 1936 he was the professor of philosophy and pedagogy in the Istituto di Magistero Suor Orsola Benincasa. At the same time, he actively contributed as secretary of editorial staff to the review of &quot;Logos,&quot; edited by his mentor Aliotta. From 1936 to 1976 he was a full professor of History of Philosophy, and then in 1939 he was appointed to a full-time professorship at the Faculty of Letters and philosophy at the University of Turin.

Immediately after World War II, he helped found the Centro di studi metodologici in Turin. With his student, Franco Ferrarotti, Abbagnano founded in 1950 the &quot;Quaderni di sociologia,&quot; and in 1952 he was joint editor with Norberto Bobbio of the &quot;Rivista di filosofia&quot;. Then from 1952 to 1960 he inspired a group of scholars for a &quot;New Enlightenment,&quot; and organized a series of conventions attended by the philosophers who were engaged in the construction of a &quot;lay&quot; philosophy and who were interested in the main trends of the foreign philosophical thought. In 1964, he began his contributions to the Turin newspaper &quot;La Stampa&quot;. In 1972, he moved to Milan and discontinued his contributions to &quot;La Stampa&quot;, but began writing for Indro Montanelli&#x27;s &quot;Giornale&quot;. In Milan, he held the office of Town Councillor, elected from the lists of the Liberal Party, and was also the Councillor of Culture. He died on 9 September 1990, and was buried in the cemetery of Santa Margherita Ligure, the Riviera town where he had spent his vacations for many years.

== Works ==
During the Neapolitan period, Abbagnano&#x27;s theoretical work is represented by &quot;Le sorgenti irrazionali del pensiero&quot; (1923), as well as &quot;Il problema dell&#x27;arte&quot; (1925), &quot;La fisica nuova&quot; (1934) e &quot;Il principio della metafisica&quot; (1936). These works are all influenced by the teaching of Aliotta, who encouraged Abbagnano&#x27;s interest in the methodological problems of science. Equally influential was the anti-idealist controversy that is particularly evident in his volume on art. After moving to Turin, Abbagnano turned to the study of existentialism, which by this time was also the interest of the general Italian philosophical culture. He formulated an original version of existentialism in his widely recognized book, &quot;La struttura dell&#x27;esistenza&quot; (1939), which was followed by his &quot;Introduzione all&#x27;esistenzialismo&quot; (1942) and a set of essays collected in &quot;Filosofia religione scienza&quot; (1947) and by &quot;Esistenzialismo positivo&quot; (1948). In 1943, he played a very important part in the debate on existentialism that appeared in &quot;Primato&quot;, the review of the fascist opposition led by Giuseppe Bottai.

In the first years after the war, Abbagnano&#x27;s interest turned to American pragmatism. Above all is the version offered by John Dewey to the philosophy of science and to neopositivism. In existentialism, having freed himself from the negative implications he found in Heidegger, in Jaspers, in Sartre, in Dewey&#x27;s pragmatism and in neopositivism, Abagnano saw the signs of a new philosophical trend, that he called a &quot;New Enlightenment&quot; in an article written in 1948. The development of this idea in the fifties was precisely characterized both by his interest in science, in particular, sociology, and by an attempt to define the program of a philosophy, that he first called a &quot;New Enlightenment&quot; and later a &quot;methodological empirism&quot;. During this period essays were collected in &quot;Possibilità e libertà&quot; (1956) and in &quot;Problemi di sociologia&quot; (1959) but, one of his most important works is the &quot;Dizionario di filosofia&quot; (1961), a true &quot;summa&quot; meant to clarify the principal concepts of philosophy.

Besides the volumes and the essays on theoretical character Nicola Abbagnano, since his youth he has published many historical monographs, including &quot;Il nuovo idealismo inglese e americano&quot; (1927), &quot;La filosofia di E. Meyerson e la logica dell&#x27;identità&quot; (1929), &quot;Guglielmo d&#x27;Ockham&quot; (1933), &quot;La nozione del tempo secondo Aristotele&quot; (1933), &quot;Bernardino Telesio&quot; (1941). His major historiographic work is found in the &quot;Storia della filosofia&quot; published by UTET (1946–1950), which was preceded by the &quot;Compendio di storia della filosofia&quot; (1945–1947), which was closer to a textbook. A few years later, the latter was followed by a collection entitled &quot;Storia delle scienze&quot;, which he coordinated for UTET (1962). Abbagnano defined his philosophy as &quot;positive existentialism&quot;. His &quot;philosophy of possible&quot; condemned other existentialists for either denying human possibility or exaggerating it. In his later work, he tended to adopt a more naturalistic and scientific approach to philosophy. Some of his writings were translated into English in &quot;Critical Existentialism&quot; (ed. by Nino Langiulli, 1969).

His work in the last decades, starting from 1965 on, mainly consists of articles appearing in &quot;La Stampa&quot; and in &quot;Giornale&quot; that were later assembled in different collections, &quot;Per o contro l&#x27;uomo&quot; (1968), &quot;Fra il tutto e il nulla&quot; (1973), &quot;Questa pazza filosofia&quot; (1979), &quot;L&#x27;uomo progetto Duemila&quot; (1980), &quot;La saggezza della vita&quot; (1985), &quot;La saggezza della filosofia&quot; (1987). His last book, written a few months before his death, is the autobiographical text &quot;Ricordi di un filosofo&quot; (1990).

<text>Tourism plays a significant part in the economic life of England. In 2018, the United Kingdom as a whole was the world&#x27;s 10th most visited country for tourists, and 17 of the United Kingdom&#x27;s 25 UNESCO World Heritage Sites fall within England.

VisitEngland is the official tourist board for England. VisitEngland&#x27;s stated mission is to build England&#x27;s tourism product, raise Britain&#x27;s profile worldwide, increase the volume and value of tourism exports and develop England and Britain&#x27;s visitor economy. In 2020, the &quot;Lonely Planet&quot; travel guide rated England as the second best country to visit that year, after Bhutan.

Lockdowns necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced the number of visitors in 2020, and into 2021. , a 10-day quarantine period applies to people entering England from a number of &quot;red list&quot; countries.

==Cities==
The 15 English cities visited most by overseas tourists in 2019 were:
==Rankings==

Unlike other countries, most state-run museums and places of cultural interest in England are free of charge to visit. Museums are an important aspect of English culture, and most cities and towns have a few museums and art galleries. Some of the most visited places are:


==World Heritage Sites ==
17 of the 25 United Kingdom&#x27;s UNESCO World Heritage Sites fall within England. Some of the best known of these include Stonehenge, the Tower of London, the Jurassic Coast, Westminster, the Roman Baths in Bath, Saltaire, Ironbridge Gorge and Studley Royal Park.

The northernmost point of the Roman Empire, Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, is the largest Roman artefact in the world, running a total of 73 miles in northern England.

==National Parks==
Some notable National Parks in England include:
*Lake District National Park — mountains, lakes and woodlands; the land of Wordsworth. 
*New Forest National Park — one of the few remnants of the great oak and hornbeam woodland that once covered southern England.
*North York Moors National Park — heather-clad hills, woodlands, sea cliffs and secluded beaches
*Peak District National Park — rugged moors and hills which form the northern spine of England.
*South Downs National Park — the gentle rolling chalk downs of southern England.

England possesses a wide range of natural environments, and continues to benefit from a significant ecotourism industry. Attractions include:

*Eden Project in Cornwall.
*The Lake District, a national park and mountainous region in Cumbria, including Windermere, the largest lake in England.
*The Peak District, a national park and upland area lying mostly in Derbyshire.
*Dartmoor and Exmoor, national parks and upland areas in Devon/Somerset.
*The New Forest, a rural forest and national park lying mostly in Hampshire.
*The Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site in Dorset and Devon.
*The Broads, a national park and lowland area lying mostly in Norfolk.
*The Yorkshire Dales, a national park and upland area in North Yorkshire and Cumbria.
*The National Forest, covering parts of Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire.
*The South Downs, a national park stretching from Hampshire to East Sussex and comprising chalk uplands and sea cliffs.
*Center Parcs, a European network of rural holiday parks.

===Preservation trusts===

A number of umbrella organisations are devoted to the preservation and public access of both natural and cultural heritage, including English Heritage and the National Trust. Membership with them, even on a temporary basis, gives priority free access to their properties thereafter.

English Heritage has a wide-ranging remit and manages more than 400 significant buildings and Monuments in England. They also maintain a register of thousands of listed buildings, those which are considered of most importance to the historic and cultural heritage of the country.

== Travelling within England==
The United Kingdom&#x27;s bus services offers numerous, frequent and reliable transport around most of the larger towns and cities. Rural areas are less well served and hiring a car is often the best option to explore the countryside and villages.

The next most common methods of transports are taxis and trains. Great Britain&#x27;s extensive rail network is used to travel between cities significantly more than aeroplanes, with a 2015 survey finding that only 1% of international visitors flew domestically after arrival.

== Politics ==
The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Arts, Heritage and Tourism is the minister with responsibility over tourism in the UK.

== Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic ==

The travel restrictions and lockdowns necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to a 76% reduction in &quot;inbound tourism&quot; to the UK that year.(Most reports that provide statistics on tourism cover the entire UK as an entity, although some do provide specifics for England.) The forecast for 2021 indicated an estimate that visits would be up &quot;21% on 2020 but only 29% of the 2019 level&quot;. Some increase was expected but slowly at first and the report concluded that tourism was not expected to come &quot;even close to normal levels&quot;.

The same VisitBritain report also discussed the effects of the pandemic on domestic within the UK in 2020, citing a significant reduction in spending, for an estimated decline of 62% over the previous year. As of January 2021, the forecast for 2021 suggested that spending would increase by 79% over the previous year and that &quot;the value of spending will be back to 84% of 2019 levels&quot; by the end of 2021.

A report published in March 2021 by the Fraser of Allander Institute indicated that &quot;tourism and hospitality suffered notable losses from the pandemic&quot; and provided detailed specifics for both domestic and international visits. The government announced a £56m &quot;welcome back fund&quot; that month to help councils and businesses in coastal towns prepare to welcome tourists back safely in summer, &quot;as soon as the roadmap allows&quot;.

On 5 April 2021, the BBC reported that the restrictions on domestic travel were expected to be loosened during that month, at least for travel within England, Scotland and Wales. (No announcement had been made as of early April by Northern Ireland.) The news item predicted that &quot;hotels and B&amp;Bs [were] set to open for holidaymakers in England on 17 May at the earliest&quot;. An article in The Guardian stated that &quot;all shops in England will be allowed to reopen from next Monday [12 April], while pubs and restaurants will be allowed to serve customers outdoors. The VisitBritain website provided more specifics on 5 April as to &quot;COVID-19 restrictions&quot; that were expected to be loosened on 12 April but indicated that there was no confirmation as to whether the rules on international travel, either inbound or outbound, would actually be loosened in mid-May.

On 6 April 2021, CNN published an update as to the tourism situation in the UK for visits from other nations. Any visitors from &quot;red list&quot; countries were still not allowed to enter unless they were UK residents. &quot;There&#x27;s still not much to do in the UK right now ... although this lockdown is now being eased some restrictions will likely be in place until the summer&quot;, the report predicted, with June being the most likely time for tourism from other countries to begin a rebound.

On 5 April 2021, the VisitBritain website discussed a plan to relax some restrictions on visits to the UK from other nations by mid-May. The feasibility of the plan became less certain as of 8 April 2021 when sources in the European Union stated on that a &quot;third wave of the pandemic [was sweeping] the continent&quot;; the B117 variant was of particular concern. Two days earlier, PM Boris Johnson had made it clear that &quot;We don&#x27;t want to see the virus being reimported into this country from abroad&quot;.

Some restrictions on hospitality and domestic tourism were loosened in England on 12 April 2021; pubs and restaurants were allowed to open their outdoor facilities; non-essential stores opened; families were allowed to travel within England &quot;in self-contained accommodation&quot; and travel between Wales and England was fully permitted.

<text>Filipino martial arts (FMA) () refer to ancient and newer modified fighting methods devised in the Philippines. It incorporates elements from both Western and Eastern Martial Arts; the most popular forms of which are known as Arnis, Eskrima, and Kali. The intrinsic need for self-preservation was the genesis of these systems. Throughout the ages, invaders and evolving local conflict imposed new dynamics for combat in the islands now making up the Philippines. The Filipino people developed battle skills as a direct result of an appreciation of their ever-changing circumstances. They learned, often, out of necessity on how to prioritize, allocate and use common resources in combative situations. Filipinos have been heavily influenced by a phenomenon of cultural and linguistic mixture. Some of the specific mechanisms responsible for cultural and martial change extended from phenomena such as war, political and social systems, technology, and trade and practicality.

Filipino martial arts have seen an increase in prominence due to the influence of several Hollywood movies and the teachings of modern masters such as Venancio &quot;Anciong&quot; Bacon, Dan Inosanto, Roland Dantes, Edgar Sulite, Cacoy Canete, Danny Guba, Mike Inay, Remy Presas, Wilson Pangan Sr. (Grand Master), Ernesto Presas Sr., Doug Marcaida, Ernesto Presas Jr., Carlito A. Lanada, Sr., and Carlos Deleon.

There have been numerous scholarly calls on the inclusion of the many martial arts of the Philippines into the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. As of 2019, a total of nine elements scattered in eight countries, such as Thailand, Georgia, and Korea, have successfully inscribed their martial arts in the UNESCO list.

==History==

Historically there was no term for &quot;martial arts&quot; in any Philippine language, the Filipino term &quot;sining panlaban&quot; is thus a loan translation of the English term. Because of the lack of historical accounts and archaeological records that made references and descriptions on the natives&#x27; ways of fighting and training in a combat system, it is somewhat difficult for historians and anthropologists to pinpoint the exact year or era when native Filipinos started to codify or drill their personnel in an established fighting system. Filipino martial artists often cite the Battle of Mactan as a historical testament to the existence of Filipino martial arts, but the narrative of the chronicler, Antonio Pigafetta, only described the events of the battle and the culture of the natives superficially. Spanish reports from the late-16th century to the 19th century did not name a method of fighting amongst the natives despite carrying weapons with them all the time nor did they describe any kind of reference of a martial art that was practiced by the natives who were serving in Spanish garrisons all over the islands, though that does not mean that natives could not fight, as human aggression is the primary source of violence which are most likely motivated by constant warfare especially the Sambal, Pampangos, and the Visayans. The earliest description on the natives&#x27; fighting methods is in a report by Francisco de Sande in Manila, about natives in Zambales carrying &quot;several daggers around their belts&quot; and men carrying battle-axes in their squadron and some well-placed arquebusiers, but none about describing any kind of formalized drills and training for combat which would define a martial art as archeological discovery and historical accounts on the description of centuries-old weapons does not mean that there was a systemized method of fighting. Another interesting report from 1629 implied that the natives were recently taught how to wield a sword presumably in the Spanish way and in 1764 report by Baltasar Vela who spoke of &quot;drilled Indians&quot; attacking the English in Manila.

In the late 19th century to the early 20th century, the US administration formally introduced boxing in the islands and in the following years in early to mid-20th century, Japanese businessmen introduced and taught Japanese martial arts in the islands, especially Judo, and during World War II it became common for Filipino martial artists to incorporate Japanese martial arts in their respective styles.

A popular folk narrative or those researched by individual martial arts enthusiasts traces the development of a fighting system in the 12th century, when Indonesian martial arts (or most likely those from Borneo or at least transmitted there) reached the islands. At this time, the islands also had culture influences from Cambodia and Thailand. Native martial arts that were possibly forerunners to the modern Arnis de Mano started to exist by the 14th century. Arnis is characterized as sabre play that uses a pair of rattan canes or short wooden canes. Ancient Filipinos were considered skilled in dagger and the broad-sword before the Spanish colonization of the Philippines.

Silat is another martial art culturally practiced in Southern Philippines, that was imported there from either Brunei or Malaysia, considering its close proximity with Borneo, and from there to Malaysia. Silat was popular among the royal families of the South and Muslim area of the country. There are also fighting systems such as Sikaran and Kuntaw. Kuntaw is considered on the verge of being extinct. Sikaran is an old style that is popular in the areas around Manila. The competition of Sikaran involved two teams or individuals in the area of a rice paddy in the time of dry season .

Today there are said to be almost as many Filipino fighting styles as there are islands in the Philippines. In 1972, the Philippine government included Filipino martial arts into the national sports arena. The Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports also incorporated them into the physical education curriculum for high school and college students. In recent history, Richardson C. Gialogo and Aniano Lota, Jr. helped the Department of Education (DepEd), former Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports, in the promotion of Arnis in the public schools. The Task Force on School Sports (TFSS) headed by Mr. Feliciano Toledo asked Richard Gialogo and Jon Lota to conduct national, regional and provincial seminar-workshops all over the Philippines under the auspices of the Philippine government. This resulted to the inclusion of Arnis in the &quot;Palarong Pambansa&quot; (National Games) in 2006. The efforts of the two and Senator Miguel Zubiri resulted in Arnis being declared as the National Martial Art and Sport of the Philippines by virtue of Republic Act 9850 which was signed into law in 2009. Knowledge of the Filipino fighting skills is mandatory in the Philippine military and police.

Filipino martial arts are considered the most advanced practical modern blade system in the world and are now a core component of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Modern Army Combatives program and used by the Russian Spetsnaz (special forces). The Government of India used Filipino martial arts to train their Para (Indian Special Forces) of Indian Army, National Security Guard, MARCOS of Indian Navy and Commandos of Central Armed Police Forces.
==Weapons==

Filipino martial artists are noted for their ability to fight with weapons or empty hands interchangeably and their ability to turn ordinary household items into lethal weapons. Weapons-training takes precedence because they give an edge in real fights, gears students to psychologically face armed opponents, and any object that can be picked up can be used as a weapon using FMA techniques. Empty hand training techniques are translated from the use of the Daga (dagger) or Baston (stick).

Another thing to note is that the Philippines is a &quot;blade culture&quot;. The Southern Philippines with the Moros were never really conquered by the Spaniards or the Americans; nor the Northern mountains of Luzon with their feared headhunter tribes so they kept their weapons and their fighting skills. For the more &quot;Christianized&quot; provinces and the towns where citizens had been &quot;disarmed&quot;, bolos (a cutting tool similar to the machete) and other knife variants are still commonly used for general work (farming in the provinces, chopping wood, coconuts, controlling &quot;talahib&quot; (sword grass), which could grow higher than roofs if not cut, etc.) and the occasional bloody fight. Production of these weapons still survives and there are a few who still make some. In the province of Aklan, Talibongs are still being made in the remote areas. Until the 80s, balisong knives were still commonly used in the streets of Manila as general purpose pocket knives much like Swiss army knives or box cutters until new laws on allowable kinds of knives made it illegal to carry them in public without a permit or proof that it was a vital to one&#x27;s livelihood (e.g. Martial arts instructor, vendor). They&#x27;re still openly sold in their birthplace of Batangas, in the streets of Quiapo, souvenir shops and martial arts stores, wielded by practitioners and street gangs. Thus, even when fighting systems were outlawed by the Spaniards, Filipinos still maintained their centuries-old relationships with blades and blade fighting techniques that survive from ancient times and are still much alive as they have been adapted and evolved to stay relevant and practical in colonial and modern times.
Traditional weaponry varies in design, size, weight, materials, and the way these weapons are used. But because of similar techniques Filipinos can use any object and turned into a weapon by a Filipino martial artist as a force multiplier.

===Unarmed===
As mentioned before, Spanish chroniclers did not record nor described any kind of unarmed fighting in the islands, yet one can fight naturally even without practicing any kind of fighting system with or without weapons.

==== Traditional ====
These are the combat practices that have likely existed since antiquity and not born during colonization, but doubts should be raised about &quot;sikaran&quot; because of insufficient dedicated research on the subject.

*Sikaran: Kicking techniques, also a kick-based separate art practiced in Rizal province. Though marketed as &quot;traditional&quot; or whose origins are traceable back to the pre-Spanish period, there are hardly any reports from the Spanish describing this method of fighting (apart from giving direct translations for the word &quot;kick&quot;). If it did exist back in the pre-Hispanic period, then it is only fitting that it could be a descendant of a pre-historic foot-fighting born out of human aggression.
*Dumog: Filipino style of grappling or just folk wrestling. Traditionally practiced in Antique in Panay, and a recreational activity in their festivals. The Tagalogs refer to this as &quot;buno&quot; and those among the Igorot people of Northern Luzon as &quot;bultong&quot;. These terms in general refer to any kind of confrontation that heavily involves grappling with the intent of subduing an opponent. As humans are natural wrestlers, it is likely then that regional forms of this mode of combat already existed in the islands since antiquity.

==== Modern ====
These are the combat systems that were most likely developed or codified in the 20th century (at least the earliest record of it). In the case of &quot;mano-mano,&quot; in the late-19th or early 20th century during the introduction of modern boxing (see history of the boxing in the Philippines) and &quot;yaw-yan&quot; which was created by Prof. Napoleon Fernandez in 1972. 
* Mano Mano: (From Spanish &quot;mano&quot;, meaning hand lit. hand to hand) Incorporates punches, kicks, elbows, knees, headbutts, finger-strikes, locks, blocks, grappling and disarming techniques. In some systems, it is called &quot;suntukan&quot; (also known as &quot;pangamot&quot; in the Visayas and &quot;panantukan&quot; in the USA), which is a general term to refer to any kind of brawl. 
*Yaw-Yan or Sayaw ng Kamatayan: (Dance of Death) Yaw-Yan closely resembles Muay Thai, but differs in the hip-torquing motion as well as the downward-cutting nature of its kicks, and the emphasis on delivering attacks from long range (while Muay Thai focuses more on clinching). The forearm strikes, elbows, punches, dominating palms, and hand movements are empty-hand translations of the bladed weapons. There are 12 &quot;bolo punches&quot; which were patterned from Arnis.

===Impact===
These are the weapons that do not penetrate the flesh but can deliver a fatal damage to an unprotected opponent usually bruises but depending on the body part in contact, can cut through the skin. 
*Baston / Olisi: Short sticks, traditionally crafted from rattan or kamagong
*Bangkaw / Tongat: Staff, rod or pole
*Dulo-Dulo: Palmstick
*Tameng: Shield
*Improvised weapons: pens, keychains, keys (push knife grip), umbrellas, rolled-up newspapers/magazines, walking sticks, etc.



===Edged===
These are the weapons that are designed to penetrate and damage the opponent through wounds and at times, fatally injuring the opponent. 
*Daga/Cuchillo: &quot;Spanish&quot; for &quot;dagger&quot; and &quot;knife&quot; respectively. Traditional varieties include the gunong, punyal (from Spanish &quot;puñal&quot;) and barung or barong
*Balisong: Butterfly knife
*Karambit: Small blade shaped like a tiger claw
*: &quot;Spanish&quot; for &quot;sword&quot;. Includes kampilan, ginunting, pinuti and talibong
*Itak: Bolo used by Tagalog people
*Kalis: Larger, thicker Filipino kris
*Golok: Machete or broadsword used by tribes people
*Sibat: Spear
*Sundang: Single-edged thick short sword
*Lagaraw: Single-edged flexible long sword with a bent tip
*Ginunting: Single-edged flat ground short sword with a double edged sheep&#x27;s hoof tip. Typically used in matched pairs with Pinunting
*Pinunting: Single edged v-ground short sword with backswept tip. Typically used in matched pairs with Ginunting

===Flexible===
Though rare, Filipino Martial Arts also uses flexible weapons. The most popular of which is the bullwhip, the most popular club that uses this is Momoy Cañete&#x27;s San Miguel Eskrima. 
*Latigo: Spanish (sp. látigo) for whip
*Buntot Pagi: Stingray tail
*Lubid: Rope
*Sarong
*Cadena / Tanikala: Spanish and Tagalog (Tanikalâ) respectively for chain
*Tabak-Toyok: Two sticks attached together by rope or chain, similar to nunchaku, but with shorter sticks and a longer chain
*Improvised: Belt, bandana, handkerchief, shirt, towel

===Projectile ===
*Pana at Palaso: Bow and arrow
*Sibat: Spear
*Sumpit: Blowpipe
*Bagakay: Darts

*Kana (as in &quot;Indian Pana Kakana-kana&quot;/&quot;kakanain kita&quot;): Darts propelled by slingshots used by street gangsters
*Lantaka: kerosene-propelled bamboo cannon
*Luthang: gas-powered mini bamboo cannon

==Training==
===Signs and symbols===

The triangle is one of the strongest geometrical structures and stands for strength. Many training halls incorporate the triangle into their logo. It represents numerous underlying philosophical, theoretical and metaphysical principles in the Filipino martial arts. Applications of the triangle are found in defensive and offensive tactical strategies, including footwork, stances, blocking and disarms.

The triangle also represents a trinity of deities. Majority of ethno-linguistic groups in the country are known to have a trinity of ancient gods and goddesses, embodying the number three as sacred.

During training, non-verbal gesture communication and recognition is used in teaching and identification. This sign language, utilizing hand, body and weapons signals; is used to convey ideas, desires, information, or commands.

===Basic tactical ranges===
The three combat ranges in the Filipino martial arts are &quot;corto&quot; (Spanish for close-range), &quot;medio&quot; (Spanish for medium-range) and &quot;largo&quot; (Spanish for long-range).

*Hakbang: general term for footwork
*Corto Mano: close range, short movements, minimal extension of arms, legs and weapons, cutting distance
*Serrada: &quot;split step&quot;, short range footwork, quick, split action, front and back, low stance. Serrada footwork is the base of a triangular framework methodology
*Largo Mano: long range, extended movements, full extension of arms, legs and weapons, creating distance
*Fraile: short range footwork, hopping action, balanced position, short hop, pushing off from the lead foot
*Retirada: short range footwork, shuffling action, pushing backward by pushing off the lead foot, giving six to eight inches of range per action.
*Banda y banda: side to side action

<text>Kyūdō () is the Japanese martial art of archery. Kyūdō is based on &quot;kyūjutsu&quot; (&quot;art of archery&quot;), which originated with the samurai class of feudal Japan. In 1919, the name of kyūjutsu was officially changed to kyūdō, and following the example of other martial arts that have been systematizing for educational purposes, kyūdō also reorganized and integrated various forms of shooting that had been used up until then. Many practitioners may refer to themselves as &quot;yumihiki&quot; (弓引き), or &#x27;ones who draw the bow&#x27;. Kyūdō is practised by over a hundred thousand people worldwide. The bow they use is called a . It has an asymmetrical shape and length of more than , and its use is characterized by the archer gripping the lower third of the bow stave to shoot.

==History==

The beginning of archery in Japan is pre-historical. The first images picturing the distinct Japanese asymmetrical longbow are found on Dōtaku from the Yayoi period (c. 500 BC – 300 AD).

===Emergence===
The changing of society and the samurai class taking power at the end of the Heian period (794－1185) created a requirement for education in archery. This led to the birth of the first kyūjutsu &quot;ryū-ha&quot; (流派, style), the &quot;Henmi-ryū&quot; (逸見流), founded by Henmi Kiyomitsu (:ja:源清光) in the 12th century. The &quot;Takeda-ryū&quot; (:ja:武田流) and the mounted archery school &quot;Ogasawara-ryū&quot; (:ja:小笠原流) were later founded by his descendants. The need for archers grew dramatically during the Genpei War (1180–1185) and as a result the founder of the &quot;Ogasawara-ryū,&quot; Ogasawara Nagakiyo, 

During the Kamakura period (1185–1333), when Minamoto no Yoritomo established the Kamakura shogunate, archery became more and more popular, especially the three types of mounted archery: &quot;yabusame&quot;, &quot;inuoumono&quot;, and &quot;kasagake&quot;.

===Sengoku period===
From the 15th to the 16th century, Japan was ravaged by civil war. In the latter part of the 15th century Heki Danjō Masatsugu revolutionized archery with his new and accurate approach called &quot;hi&quot;, &quot;kan&quot;, &quot;chū&quot; (fly, pierce, center), and his footman&#x27;s archery spread rapidly. Many new schools were formed, some of which remain today, such as &quot;Heki-ryū Chikurin-ha&quot; (ja:日置流竹林派), &quot;Heki-ryū Sekka-ha&quot; (日置流雪荷派) and &quot;Heki-ryū Insai-ha&quot; (日置流印西派).

===16th century===
The yumi (Japanese bow) as a weapon of war began its gradual decline after the Portuguese arrived in Japan in 1543 bringing firearms with them in the form of the matchlock. The Japanese soon started to manufacture their own version of the matchlock called &quot;tanegashima&quot; and eventually it and the yari (spear) became the weapons of choice. However, because took a long time to load, were inconvenient in rainy weather when damp gunpowder would not fire, and were not exactly subtle in terms of noise, the did not go out of fashion and continued to be used as an important military force on the battlefield.
The tanegashima however did not require the same amount of training as a yumi, allowing Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s army consisting mainly of farmers armed with tanegashima to annihilate a traditional samurai archer cavalry in a single battle in 1575.

===Edo period===

During the Edo period (1603–1868) Japan was turned inward as a hierarchical caste society in which the samurai were at the top. There was an extended era of peace during which the samurai moved to administrative duty, although the traditional fighting skills were still esteemed. During this period archery became a &quot;voluntary&quot; skill, practised partly in the court in ceremonial form, partly as different kinds of competition. During this period, an archery contest called &quot;Tōshiya&quot; was popularly held at the Buddhist temple Sanjusangen-do. Many samurai competed to hit an arrow at a target 133 meters away, nearly the width of the Buddhist temple. Today, this &quot;Tōshiya&quot; contest is held as an annual event on Coming of Age Day, January 15, with women archers participating, but with the distance to the target shortened to 60 meters.

In the early Edo period, Morikawa Kōzan founded the &quot;Yamato-ryū&quot; (:ja:大和流), which was based on &quot;Ogasawara-ryū&quot; etiquette and &quot;Heki-ryū&quot; shooting methods, and also incorporated Shinto ideas.

===Revival===

During the changes to Japan brought by opening up to the outside world at the beginning of the Meiji era (1868–1912), the samurai lost their status. Therefore, &quot;kyūjutsu&quot; was considered obsolete and began to decline. Kyūjutsu practitioners established dojos to survive and began to spread among the common people. Kyūjutsu was first adopted as a subject in school education in 1895, encouraged by its beginning to spread among the common people. In 1896, a group of kyūjutsu masters gathered to save traditional archery. Honda Toshizane, the kyūjutsu teacher for the Imperial University of Tokyo, merged the war and ceremonial shooting styles, creating a hybrid called &quot;Honda-ryū&quot; (:ja:本多流生弓会). From 1919, the name of &quot;kyūjutsu&quot; was gradually replaced within clubs and events with the term &quot;kyūdō&quot;, with &quot;kyūjutsu&quot; disappearing completely by 1933. A mixed-style form was created by blending Ogasawara-ryū, Honda-ryū, and Heki-ryū, which was called &quot;kyūdō yosoku&quot;. A ranking system for kyūdō was established in 1923. Kyūdō also reorganized and integrated various other forms of shooting. Due to the abolishing of the original Dai Nippon Butoku Kai after WWII (re-established in 1953), several martial arts disciplines created their own organizations. Guidelines published in the 1953 book define how, in a competition or graduation, archers from different schools can shoot together in unified form.

==Purpose==
Kyūdō is practiced in many different schools, some of which descend from military shooting and others that descend from ceremonial or contemplative practice. Therefore, the emphasis is different. Some emphasize aesthetics and others efficiency. Contemplative schools teach the form as a meditation in action. In certain schools, to shoot correctly will result inevitably in hitting the desired target. For this a phrase &quot;seisha hicchū&quot; (正射必中), &quot;true shooting, certain hitting&quot;, is used.

According to the All Nippon Kyudo Federation, the supreme goal of kyūdō is the state of &quot;shin-zen-bi&quot; (真善美), roughly &quot;truth-goodness-beauty&quot;, which can be approximated as: when archers shoot correctly (i.e. truthfully) with virtuous spirit and attitude toward all persons and all things which relate to kyūdō (i.e. with goodness), beautiful shooting is realized naturally.

Kyūdō practice, as in all &quot;budō&quot;, includes the idea of moral and spiritual development. Today many archers practice kyūdō as a sport, with marksmanship being paramount. However, the goal most devotees of kyūdō seek is &quot;seisha seichū&quot; (正射正中), &quot;correct shooting is correct hitting&quot;. In kyūdō the unique action of expansion (&quot;nobiai&quot;; 伸合い) that results in a natural release is sought. When the technique of the shooting is correct the result is that the arrow hits the target. To give oneself completely to the shooting is the spiritual goal, achieved by perfection of both the spirit and shooting technique leading to &quot;munen musō&quot; (無念無想), &quot;no thoughts, no illusions&quot;. This however is not Zen, although Japanese bow can be used in Zen-practice or kyūdō practiced by a Zen master. In this respect, many kyūdō practitioners believe that competition, examination, and any opportunity that places the archer in this uncompromising situation is important, while other practitioners will avoid competitions or examinations of any kind.

Kyūdō itself is not a religion, but instead has influences from both Shinto and Zen. Post Meiji when bows were no longer used for war, kyūdō in Japan was practiced for physical education, without any connection to zen or religion. However, since the Second World War, kyūdō has often been associated with Zen Buddhism, largely due to the efforts of a single book, &quot;Zen in the Art of Archery&quot; (1948) by the German author Eugen Herrigel. Herrigel spoke only a little Japanese, generally using a translator to speak with his teacher. His view on kyūdō is due his exposure to a contemplative form of kyūdō. Even so, Herrigel&#x27;s book, when translated into Japanese in 1956, had a huge impact on the perception of kyūdō also in Japan.

Zenko (a Heki-ryū Bishu Chikurin-ha school of kyūdō) is affiliated closely with Shambhala Buddhism and was founded in the United States in the 1980s by Kanjuro Shibata XX. It has groups practicing in the United States and a group in Canada.

==Dōjō==
Kyūdō dōjō (training halls, aka &quot;kyūdōjō&quot;) vary in style and design from school to school, and from country to country. In Japan, most dōjō have roughly the same layout; an entrance, a large dōjō area, typically with a wooden floor and a high ceiling, a position for practice targets (called &quot;makiwara&quot;; 巻藁), and a large open wall with sliding doors, which, when opened, overlooks an open grassy area and a separate building, the &quot;matoba&quot; (的場), which houses a sand hillock and the targets, placed 28 metres from the dōjō floor.

==Practice==
Kyūdō is practiced in different schools and styles, and even between dōjō of the same style, the form of practice can vary. To harmonize practice and ceremonial shooting (&quot;sharei&quot;; 的礼) in 1953 the All Nippon Kyudo Federation (ANKF) formed an establishing committee from the main schools to take the best elements of each school and form the general style that is used today throughout Japan and in most kyūdō federations in the west. This standard form was documented in a manual, &quot;Kyudo Manual, Principles of Shooting&quot;, published in 1953. The ANKF is the governing body for kyūdō in Japan, and oversees the majority of kyūdō clubs and events in kyūdō.

In kyūdō there are three kinds of practice (&quot;keiko&quot;; 稽古): &quot;mitori geiko&quot; (見取り稽古) – receiving with the eyes the style and technique of an advanced archer, &quot;kufū geiko&quot; (工夫稽古) – learning and keeping in mind the details of the technique and spiritual effort to realize it and &quot;kazu geiko&quot; (数稽古) – repetition through which the technique is personified in one&#x27;s own shooting.

Kyūdō is different to other martial arts, in that it is largely static. It can be enjoyed competitively, or as a simple recreation. It can also be enjoyed by those seeking to gain the beauty of form.

Beginners start with a rubber practice bow and by practising the movements of &quot;hassetsu&quot; (八節). The second step for a beginner is to do &quot;karabiki&quot; (空引) training with a bow without an arrow to learn handling of the bow and performing &quot;hassetsu&quot; until full draw. Handling and maintenance of the equipment is also part of the training. After given permission by the teacher beginners start practicing with the glove and arrow. Next steps may vary from teacher to teacher, but include practising first &quot;yugamae&quot; (弓構え), then the draw and last release and shooting at &quot;makiwara&quot;. A beginner starting to shoot at the mato (的) may be asked to shoot from half or three-quarters of the usual distance.

Advanced beginners and advanced shooters practice shooting at &quot;makiwara&quot;, &quot;mato&quot; and some with &quot;omato&quot;.
&quot;Makiwara&quot; is a specially designed straw target (not to be confused with &quot;makiwara&quot; used in karate). The &quot;makiwara&quot; is shot at from a very close range (about seven feet, or the length of the archer&#x27;s strung &quot;yumi&quot; when held horizontally from the centerline of the archer&#x27;s body). Because the target is so close and the shot most certainly will hit, the archer can concentrate on refining technique rather than on the arrow&#x27;s arc.

&quot;Mato&quot; is the normal target for most kyūdō practitioners. &quot;Mato&quot; sizes and shooting distances vary, but most common is &quot;hoshi mato&quot; (星的) thirty-six centimeters (or 12 &quot;sun&quot;, a traditional Japanese measurement equivalent to approximately 30.3 cm) in diameter shot at from a distance of twenty-eight metres. For competitions and examinations, &quot;kasumi mato&quot; (霞的) is used. For ceremonies it is most common to use &quot;hoshi mato&quot; which is the same as &quot;kasumi mato&quot; but with different markings.

&quot;Omato&quot; is the &quot;mato&quot; used for long distance &quot;enteki&quot; (遠的) shooting at 60 m distance. The diameter of &quot;omato&quot; is 158 cm. There are separate competitions also for enteki shooting.

There are three levels of skill:
# &quot;Tōteki&quot;, the arrow hits the target.
# &quot;Kanteki&quot;, the arrow pierces the target.
# &quot;Zaiteki&quot; (在的), the arrow exists in the target.

==Equipment==
The is exceptionally tall (standing over two metres), surpassing the height of the archer. &quot;Yumi&quot; shafts are traditionally made of bamboo, wood and leather using techniques which have not changed for centuries, although some archers (particularly, those new to the art) may use synthetic (i.e. laminated wood coated with glassfibre or carbon fiber) &quot;yumi&quot;. Even advanced practitioners may own non-bamboo bows and arrows because of the vulnerability of bamboo equipment to extreme climates. The suitable height for the bow depends on the archer&#x27;s draw (&quot;yazuka&quot;; 矢束) which is about half the archer&#x27;s height.

 shafts () are traditionally made of bamboo, with either eagle or hawk feathers (). Most &quot;ya&quot; shafts today are still made of bamboo (although some archers will use shafts made of aluminium or carbon fibres), and &quot;ya&quot; feathers are now obtained from non-endangered birds such as turkeys or swans. The length of an arrow is the archer&#x27;s &quot;yatsuka&quot; plus . Every &quot;ya&quot; has a spinning direction being made from feathers from alternate sides of the bird, the &quot;haya&quot; spins clockwise upon release while the &quot;otoya&quot; spins counter-clockwise. Kyūdō archers usually shoot two &quot;ya&quot; per round, with the &quot;haya&quot; being shot first (&quot;haya&quot; (甲矢) means &quot;first arrow&quot;; &quot;otoya&quot; (乙矢) means &quot;second arrow&quot;). It is often said that the alternate spinning direction of the arrows would prevent two consecutive identically shot arrows from flying identically and thus colliding. The arrowhead is called a . Ya are normally kept in a cylindrical quiver, called a , with ceremonial and traditional archers using the .
The kyūdō archer wears a glove on the right hand, called a . There are many varieties of &quot;yugake&quot;; they are typically made of deerskin. Practitioners can choose between a hard glove (with a hardened thumb) or a soft glove (without a hardened thumb); each has its advantages.

With a hard glove, the thumb area is not very flexible and has a pre-made groove used to pull the string (). With a soft glove, the thumb area is very flexible and is without a pre-made groove, allowing the practitioners to create their own, based on their own shooting habits.

Typically a &quot;yugake&quot; will be of the three- or four-finger variety. The three fingered version is called a &quot;mitsugake&quot; (三つ弽), and the four-fingered version is called a &quot;yotsugake&quot; (四つ弽). Typically the primary reason an archer may choose a stronger glove like the &quot;yotsugake&quot; is to assist in pulling heavier bows ( and above). The three-fingered glove is generally used with bows with a pull below of draw weight, while the four fingered &quot;yotsugake&quot; are used with bows with a pull above . This is only a generalization and many schools differ on which glove to use for their bows and glove use often varies from archer to archer and school to school.
The practical reasoning for the extra finger on the glove stems from having more surface area available to the archer for the heavier draws. During the draw, the thumb of the archer is typically placed on the last gloved finger of the drawing hand, with the first (or, in the case of a &quot;yotsugake&quot;, the first and index fingers) being placed gently on either the thumb or the arrow shaft itself. Sometimes a type of resin powder, called &quot;giriko&quot; (ぎり粉), is applied to the thumb and holding finger to assist in the grip during the pull. The extra finger allows for a stronger hold on the thumb, as it is then placed on the &quot;third&quot; finger of the hand instead of the second. Some schools, such as Heki-ryū Insai-ha only use the three-fingered glove, even with bows above 40 kilograms.

The one-finger glove, called an &quot;ippongake&quot; (一本粉), is generally used for beginners and covers only the thumb. Some versions have a full wrist covering and others simply cover the thumb with a small strap and snap around the wrist. Because it has no glove over the fingers, it is typically uncomfortable for the archer to use &quot;giriko&quot; powder. &quot;Ippongake&quot; are generally not used by advanced archers, and are not allowed in ANKF competitions.

The five-finger glove, called a &quot;morogake&quot; (諸粉), is used almost exclusively by Ogasawara-ryū practitioners, and is not typically used in competition or by any other school.

A practitioner&#x27;s nock and grip of the arrow can be dictated by the glove and bow being used. It is not uncommon for practitioners who have upgraded or downgraded bow weight to continue to use the same glove and not change.

With the exception of the &quot;ippongake&quot;, the &quot;yugake&quot; is worn with an underglove called a &quot;shitagake&quot; (下粉) made of cotton or synthetic cloth, mainly to protect the &quot;yugake&quot; from sweat which would degrade the deerskin of the glove over time. The &quot;shitagake&quot; comes in two varieties, three-fingered and four-fingered, depending on whether it is used under the &quot;mitsugake&quot; or the &quot;yotsugake&quot;.
Because of the unique shooting technique of kyūdō, protection on the left (bow) arm is not generally required. The bow string, when properly released, will travel around the bow hand, coming to rest on the outside of the arm. However, on rare occasions a bow hand glove, called an &quot;oshidegake&quot; (押手弽), is used, which serves to protect the left thumb from injury from the arrow and fletching. A forearm protector can also be worn, primarily by beginners, to protect the left arm from being hit by the string.

Powder made of burnt rice husks called &quot;fudeko&quot; (筆粉) is applied to the hand that holds the bow to absorb sweat, allowing the bow to turn in the hand.

Female archers also wear a chest protector called a , which is generally a piece of leather or plastic which is designed to protect the breasts from being struck by the bowstring during shooting.

Because repeated usage tends to weaken the bowstring, it is not uncommon for a bowstring to break during shooting. Hence, many archers carry spare strings in what is called a &quot;tsurumaki&quot; (弦巻; &quot;bow string roll&quot;). Traditional &quot;tsurumaki&quot; are flat yoyo-shaped carriers made of woven bamboo, typically with a leather strap. Recently, however, plastic &quot;tsurumaki&quot; are also coming into use.

Many archers also have small containers of &quot;fudeko&quot; and &quot;giriko&quot; attached to the end of the &quot;tsurumaki&quot; strap; these containers are called &quot;fudeko-ire&quot; (筆粉入れ) and &quot;giriko-ire&quot; (ぎり粉入れ) and are traditionally made of horn or antler (though many modern archers have &quot;fudeko-ire&quot; and &quot;giriko-ire&quot; made of plastic).

==Technique==
All kyūdō archers hold the bow in their left hand and draw the string with their right, so that all archers face the higher position (&quot;kamiza&quot;; 上座) while shooting.

Kyūdō archers draw the bow so that the drawing hand is held behind the ear. If done improperly, upon release the string may strike the archer&#x27;s ear or side of the face.

Resulting from the technique to release the shot, the bow will (for a practised archer) spin in the hand so that the string stops in front of the archer&#x27;s outer forearm. This action of &quot;yugaeri&quot; (弓返り) is a combination of technique and the natural working of the bow. It is unique to kyūdō.

Kyūdō technique is meticulously prescribed. Different styles have their own variations from the steps, the most notable difference being between the vertical bow rising &quot;shomen&quot; (正面) and aslant bow rising &quot;shamen&quot; (斜面). The &quot;hassetsu&quot; (or &quot;eight stages of shooting&quot;) of the &quot;shomen&quot; style is described in the &quot;Kyudo Kyohon&quot; (&quot;Kyudo Manual&quot;):

# &quot;Ashibumi&quot; (足踏み), placing the footing. The archer steps onto the line from where arrows are shot (known as the &quot;shai&quot;; 射位) and turns to face the &quot;kamiza&quot;, so that the left side of the archer&#x27;s body faces the target. The archer then sights from the target to the feet and with the feet set apart so that the distance between them is equal to the archer&#x27;s &quot;yazuka&quot;, about half his body height, and equal to the length of an arrow. A line drawn between the archer&#x27;s toes should pass through the target after the completion of the &quot;ashibumi&quot;. During competition, an archer may have a second set of arrows sitting on the ground at the feet. To be correct in &quot;ashibumi&quot;, these arrows must not extend in front of or behind the archer&#x27;s footing stance. The archer&#x27;s feet are then placed outward at a 60 degree angle from each other, forming a &quot;V&quot;, this ensures equal balance to both feet.
# &quot;Dōzukuri&quot; (胴造り), forming the body. The archer verifies balance and that the pelvis and the line between the shoulders are parallel to the line set up during &quot;ashibumi&quot;. During &quot;dōzukuri&quot;, the kyūdō practitioner will straighten the back and posture, forming a straight line from shoulders to feet. Practically this is to prevent the bowstring from striking the archer&#x27;s face when shooting.
# &quot;Yugamae&quot; (弓構え), readying the bow. &quot;Yugamae&quot; consists of three phases:
## &quot;Torikake&quot; (取り掛け), gripping of the bowstring with the right hand.
## &quot;Tenouchi&quot; (手の内), the left hand is positioned for shooting on the bow&#x27;s grip.
## &quot;Monomi&quot; (物見), the archer turns the head to gaze at the target.
# &quot;Uchiokoshi&quot; (打起し), raising the bow. The archer raises the bow above the head to prepare for the draw.
# &quot;Hikiwake&quot; (引分け), drawing apart. The archer starts bringing down the bow while spreading his arms, simultaneously pushing the bow with the left hand and drawing the string with the right.
## &quot;Daisan&quot; (大三), &quot;Big Three.&quot; This forms the midway point in Hikiwake.
# &quot;Kai&quot; (会), the full draw. The archer continues the movement started in the previous phase, until full draw is achieved with the arrow placed slightly below the cheekbone or level with the mouth. The arrow points along the line set up during &quot;ashibumi&quot;.
## &quot;Tsumeai&quot; (詰合い), constructing the vertical and horizontal lines of the body.
## &quot;Nobiai&quot; (伸合い), uniting the expansions of the body.
# &quot;Hanare&quot; (離れ), the release. The technique results in the bowstring being released from the right hand and the right arm extending behind the archer.
#&quot;Zanshin&quot; (残心), &quot;the remaining body or mind&quot; or &quot;the continuation of the shot&quot;. The archer remains in the position reached after &quot;hanare&quot; while returning from the state of concentration associated with the shot.
## &quot;Yudaoshi&quot; (弓倒し), lowering of the bow.

Throughout the process, the kyūdō practitioner maintains ritual breathing between each action, which creates ma-ai between intervals.

While other schools&#x27; shooting also conforms to the &quot;hassetsu&quot; outlined above, the naming of some steps and some details of the execution of the shot may differ.

==Rankings==
Kyūdō ranking system was established by the DNBK in 1923, using a system which is now common to modern &quot;budō&quot; (martial art) practices. Most kyūdō federations periodically hold examinations, which, if the archer passes, permits them to register for a grade, which can be &quot;kyū&quot; or &quot;dan&quot; level. Traditional schools, however, often rank students as a recognition of their achievement and as permission to instruct at various levels using the older &quot;menkyo&quot; (license) system of &quot;koryū budō&quot;.

One&#x27;s first shinsa is generally &quot;mushitei&quot; (unspecified), the performance in which will determine one&#x27;s first rank. Generally the 3rd, 2nd, and 1-&quot;kyū&quot; ranks are more common among students, while adults will sometimes skip the &quot;kyū&quot; ranks entirely and move straight on 1-&quot;dan&quot;, though this depends significantly on the policy of the regional federation. &quot;Dan&quot; test frequency also varies depending on location, occurring anywhere as often as 4 times a year to as rarely as only once or twice a year. Such tests are generally held by the prefecture kyūdō federation and the archer may have to travel quite a distance to the prefectural capital or a large city to test. Often testing includes many archers and may take as much as 6 to 8 hours to test all of the different levels, though the COVID-19 pandemic did result in temporary changes in how testing was run. One of these changes was the introduction of video shinsa that could be submitted to reduce the need to travel as well the risk of infection - an approach that was later extended to overseas practitioners testing up to 2-dan.

While kyūdō&#x27;s system of &quot;kyū&quot; and &quot;dan&quot; levels are similar to those of other budō practices, colored belts or similar external symbols of one&#x27;s level are not worn by kyūdō practitioners.

==Competition==
While kyūdō is primarily viewed as an avenue toward self-improvement, there are often kyūdō competitions or tournaments whereby archers practise in a competitive style. These tournaments often involve kyūdō practitioners from all ranks and grades, including high school, college and adult participants. Competition is usually held with a great deal more ceremony than the standard dōjō practice. In addition to the &quot;hassetsu&quot;, the archer must also perform an elaborate entering procedure whereby the archer will join up to four other archers to enter the dōjō, bow to the adjudicators, step up to the back line known as the &quot;honza&quot; (本坐) and then kneel in a form of sitting known as &quot;kiza&quot; (跪坐). The archers then bow to the &quot;mato&quot; in unison, stand, and take three steps forward to the &quot;shai&quot; (shooting line) and kneel again. The archers then move in lock-step fashion through the &quot;hassetsu&quot;, each archer standing and shooting one after another at the respective targets, kneeling between each shot, until they have exhausted their supply of arrows (generally four).

In Japanese kyūdō competitions, an archer shoots four arrows in two sets, placing one pair of arrows at his feet and holding the second pair at the ready. One then shoots the &quot;haya&quot; while clasping the &quot;otoya&quot; tightly with the last one or two fingers of the gloved hand. The archer then waits until the other archers shoot, then sets the &quot;otoya&quot; and shoots. Once all the archers have shot, the archer will then pick up the second pair of arrows at the feet and repeat the process, starting with the second flight&#x27;s &quot;haya&quot;. During normal competition, this process is done with the archers standing, however, the complete shooting procedure includes having the archer kneel in &quot;kiza&quot; while waiting between each shot.

For each hit on the &quot;mato&quot;, the archer is awarded a &quot;maru&quot; (&quot;circle&quot;; 円) mark. For each miss, the archer is awarded a &quot;batsu&quot; (&quot;X&quot;; 罰) mark. The goal is to strike the target with all four arrows.

==School clubs==
Many Japanese high schools and colleges have kyūdō clubs (&quot;bukatsu&quot;; 部活) in which students gather after regular classes to practise kyūdō. Recently these have begun appearing in junior high schools as well, but it is generally left until high school. In some towns or cities where junior high schools don&#x27;t have a kyūdō club, a student may wish to enroll in kyūdō lessons outside of school, and to have enough time for practice, opt for a less time-demanding (and usually non-sports related) club at their school.

==Kyūdō in the west==
Unlike more common forms of Japanese martial arts (e.g. jūdō, karate), kyūdō is one of the Japanese martial arts that has not seen large amounts of mainstream interest in the West. While kyūdō appeared as early as 1898 in Italy, it has appeared in other western countries only in recent times. Many countries have no kyūdōjō, or only very small groups.
Kyūdō is often brought back by westerners returning from Japan, who have studied it there. In some cases, it is supported by Japanese people temporarily living outside Japan. Often practitioners of other martial arts develop an interest in kyūdō.

Kyūdō arrived in America in the early 1900s as members of the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai, first in Hawaii with the Hawaii Kyūdō Kai, and then on the mainland of the U.S. Washington State saw the first group on the mainland, then in San Francisco and San Jose. Next was Los Angeles with a group called the Rafu Kyūdō Kai or Los Angeles Kyūdō Kai (&quot;Rafu&quot; (羅府) was the term the local Japanese used for &quot;Los Angeles&quot;). After Los Angeles, the next group to form was in New York.

When many of the Japanese were interned in camps during World War II, all of the groups (except the Hawaii Kyūdō Kai) disbanded; the Hawaii Kyūdō Kai simply quietly practiced almost in secret.

So, other than the Hawaii Kyūdō Kai, there were no kyūdō groups in America after the war until around 1968, when a small group formed in the basement of a Buddhist church in Los Angeles. The next revival in America was with Koen and Kiomaru Mishima, who practiced with a small group in the basement of a Buddhist church in Los Angeles; they were later joined by Rev. Hirokazu Kosaka. By 1976 (at the request of an original member of the Los Angeles Kyūdō Kai, who belonged to the group in the 1920s), they had renamed their fledgling group &#x27;The Los Angeles Kai&#x27;.

Daihonzan Chozen-ji, a Rinzai Zen temple founded in Honolulu in 1972, began kyūdō training in 1979–80, with master Suhara Osho visiting from Japan.

In the 1980s, Kanjuro Shibata XX was invited by Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche to the Karmê Chöling Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Vermont, where he demonstrated kyūdō for the first time in the United States. This visit and demonstration led to an interest in kyūdō in the Connecticut River Valley, and an active community that has continued until the present.

The official American Kyudo Renmei was founded in 1998, and is the official body recognised by Japan in association with the IKYF for Kyudo in the United States. It is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization dedicated to promoting Japanese archery, kyūdō, in the Americas, and has clubs in nine states, and some connected groups.

There is a growing interest in kyūdō outside Japan, with a number of well-established kyūdōjō practising regularly. The international governing organisation for kyūdō is the International Kyudo Federation (IKYF), based in Japan and founded in 2006. It was formed by the ANKF, gathering practitioners together to form an international body, with the goal to promote the sport internationally, running international seminars and gradings. Initially, it had 17 member countries, and as of 2024 maintains standards for official member national bodies or affiliates in 48 countries.

Many countries in Europe have long established clubs and organisations maintaining Kyudo in those nations, with the European Kyudo Federation as an umbrella organisation overseeing Kyudo in all of Europe.

Several other kyūdō organizations also exist to facilitate the practice of kyūdō, including the Honda-ryū Seikyūkai, Takeda-ryū　Yabusame Hozonkai, Kyūbajutsu-Reiho Ogasawara-Kyōjō, Heki-ryū (various ryū-ha), Zen (various ryū-ha), sports yabusame, the (new) Dai Nippon Butoku Kai (hankyū only), the (new) Dai Nippon Kyudo Kai, the Japan Budo International Federation (Serbia), and other independent/non-affiliated kyudo aficionado groups. Many of these organizations are registered in Japan as general incorporated associations (ippan shadan hōjin) or general incorporated foundations (ippan zaidan hōjin), and some also have their own menkyo (rank) systems.

<text>Asse () is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Flemish Brabant. It comprises the towns of Asse proper, Bekkerzeel, Kobbegem, Mollem, Relegem and Zellik. Asse is also situated in the Pajottenland. As of 2020, Asse had a total population of 32,958. The total area is 49.64 km2 which gives a population density of circa 660 inhabitants per km2.

==History==

Asse (formerly spelt &quot;Assche&quot;) was probably inhabited by the Celtic tribe of the Nervii. The name itself probably comes from a pre-Celtic word meaning &quot;water&quot; (cf Esch-, Es- and Axe- prefixes elsewhere in Europe). It was probably inhabited from an early date; stone tools have been found in various locations. The fertility of the soil and the relief which rises above the wetter plains of present-day Flanders would also suggest that his would have been an early area of settlement.

From the middle of the first century, a Roman military road connected it to the capital of the Roman province of Nervii in Bavay (Bagacum Nerviorum). It continued northwards as far as the naval port at present-day Rumst, with various side roads to the East and West. It is possible that there was a Roman military camp to the south west of the present town centre in what is now known as &quot;borgstad&quot;, though its role has not been clearly proven.

What is sure is that Asse grew to be a substantial settlement or vicus at an, at least locally, important road junction. Though no Roman buildings are extant there have been frequent archaeological finds including in 2007 a pottery and in 2008 a section of a (perhaps intra-urban) Roman road. It is possible that there was local cult of Epona as a large number of clay horse figurines, presumably votive offerings, have been found.

It is presumed that the Germanic language, which evolved into present-day Dutch, was introduced during the Frankish invasions in the late fourth and fifth centuries. Place-name study would at least suggest that but there are no extant written sources.

During the Carolingian period Asse was part of the region (gouw) of Brabant. During the period of the Viking invasions it would seem that there was a relatively important fortified site (see the Vita Berlindis) in Asse. From 1085 or 1086 Asse was part of the Duchy of Brabant under the Dukes of Leuven. The local vassal of the Duke was known as the &quot;Heer van Asse&quot; (i.e. the Lord of Asse) who was the Duke&#x27;s hereditary standard bearer.

Asse was situated on the cross roads of both north–south as well as east–west trade routes, having a fertile, easily cultivated and well-drained soil. It therefore grew to be a regionally important centre and a relatively important military-strategic one. Asse has often been the subject of military campaigns and has been recorded as having been burnt down several times.

=== Ancien Régime ===
The St Martins church gained some local fame as a centre of pilgrimage connected to the miraculous blossoming of a tree in which a Host had been hidden and the equally miraculous appearance of a cross – the Miracles of the Holy Cross. During this period much of the power was inherited by the descendants of John II of Cottereau, Lord of Assche, he placed some important coloured windows in the church and was buried there. His descendants today still are family of the current Marquess of Assche.

In continuation of its role as seat of an important judicial court under the Ancien Régime, Asse was made capital of a canton during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Period.

Lacking any mineral resources, and being far from any navigable watercourses and being in close proximity to other larger centres such as Aalst, Dendermonde and Brussels, Asse never developed into an important commercial, political or industrial centre but remained a locally important market town. There was some brewing and marketing of the local hop production.

It is now a commuting town for Brussels with a number of light industrial and commercial activities.

==Notable people==
* (Knight) Léonard de Selliers de Moranville (1803-1856) was a lawyer and school inspector in Asse.

<text>Dilbeek () is a municipality in the province of Flemish Brabant, in the Flemish region of Belgium. The municipality comprises the villages of Dilbeek proper, Groot-Bijgaarden, Itterbeek (with Sint-Anna-Pede), Schepdaal (with Sint-Gertrudis-Pede), Sint-Martens-Bodegem, and Sint-Ulriks-Kapelle. Dilbeek is located just outside the Brussels-Capital Region (and is part of the city&#x27;s urban sprawl, contiguous with Berchem-Sainte-Agathe, Moortebeek (Anderlecht) and Molenbeek-Saint-Jean) in the Pajottenland, hence the local name &quot;Poort van het Pajottenland&quot; (Gate to the Pajottenland).

Even though Dilbeek is located in the Dutch language area of Belgium, there is a French-speaking minority represented by 3 members on the 35-seat local council. It is a mostly residential community with some preserved rural areas and some industrial zones. The Brussels Ring road (R0, part of E19) bisects the municipality, with a major junction with the A10 motorway (part of E40) located within its boundaries.

==History==

===Medieval origins===
The life of Saint Alena, the 7th-century martyr daughter of a lord of Dilbeek, was set in Dilbeek and Forest (Vorst). The historical facts of her life, however, are disputed. In Carolingian times, Dilbeek and its neighbouring villages were part of the pagus &quot;Bracbatensis&quot;. This territory, ruled by the Lords of Aa in Anderlecht, was integrated into the Landgraviate of Brabant by the counts of Leuven around 1085. The first mention of the name &quot;Dedelbeccha&quot; dates from 1075, while the name &quot;Bigardis&quot;, later transformed into &quot;Groot-Bijgaarden&quot; (in French &quot;Grand Bigard&quot;), dates from 1110. &quot;Bigardis&quot; was originally a dependency of the Abbey of Saint Bavo in Ghent, but by 1125, nuns under the leadership of Saint Wivina had founded a religious community there. Around 1183, the landgraviate became the Duchy of Brabant, within which Dilbeek remained as an independent parish until the French Revolution.

===16th century until now===
The area&#x27;s parishes belonged to the see of Cambrai until 1559 when they were placed under the administration of the Archbishop of Mechelen. Also in the 16th century, Dilbeek, Itterbeek and Sint-Martens-Bodegem were placed under the local rule of the Lords of Gaasbeek. The following decades were marked by the wars that opposed Catholics and Protestants, which resulted in the ruin of the Abbey of Groot-Bijgaarden. The final dismantlement and sale of the buildings occurred during the French regime in the 1790s.

==Events==
* Each of the six communes that make up the current municipality organizes several annual fairs and kermesses.
* Every spring, a tulip festival takes place in Dilbeek.
* Each summer the &quot;Vijverfestival&quot; (Pond Festival), where Flemish bands perform on a floating stage, takes place at the pond behind the town hall in Dilbeek proper.

==Sights==
* The imposing castle of Groot-Bijgaarden was built in 1640 around a 14th-century keep. Nearby is the Sint-Wivina domain, where ruins of the original abbey still stand.
* Dilbeek&#x27;s local authority offices, also known as the de Viron Castle, was built in 1863 in Tudor-style on the ruins of a 14th-century fortification. One of the medieval towers, the &quot;Sint-Alenatoren&quot;, can still be seen in the park surrounding the current building. On his visit to this fort, Charles V was reportedly served rabbit instead of his favourite hare, which resulted in the nickname &quot;konijnenfretters&quot; (rabbit eaters) for the inhabitants of Dilbeek. Several other buildings of interest (farm, ice cellar, stagecoach building) can also be found in the park
* The rural communes contain numerous old farms, including &quot;Het Neerhof&quot;, a 13th-century building that belonged to the abbey of Forest.
* The tower of the &quot;Sint-Ambrosiuskerk&quot; (church of Saint-Ambrose) dates from the same century.
* The main church of Sint-Anna-Pede (Itterbeek) was the model used by Peter Brueghel the Elder in his 1568 painting &quot;The Parable of the Blind&quot; currently in Naples. The village now houses a Brueghel museum as well as a restored watermill dating from 1776.
* Dilbeek also houses an interesting tram museum, tracing the history of this local mode of transportation since its beginning in 1887.
* The village of Sint-Gertrudis-Pede (Schepdaal) is the location of Payottenland&#x27;s only working watermill, a centuries-old building thoroughly renovated in the eighties and nineties.
* Brewery Angerik, a microbrewery that brews ales, lambic beers and a lager.

==Famous inhabitants==
* Saint Alena, Christian saint (died c. 640)
* Saint Wivina, monastic foundress, 12th century.
* Romain Maes, cyclist who won the 1935 Tour de France (1913–1983)

<doc id="157511" wikidata="Q308923" url="?curid=157511" title="Munich air disaster">
<text>The Munich air disaster occurred on 6 February 1958, when British European Airways Flight 609 crashed on its third attempt to take off at Munich-Riem Airport in Munich, West Germany. The aircraft was carrying the Manchester United football team, nicknamed the &quot;Busby Babes&quot;, along with supporters and journalists. There were 44 people on board, 20 of whom died at the scene. The injured, some unconscious, were taken to Munich&#x27;s Rechts der Isar Hospital, where three more died, resulting in 23 fatalities, with 21 survivors.

The Manchester United team were returning from a European Cup match in Belgrade, Yugoslavia (now Serbia), having eliminated Red Star Belgrade to advance to the semi-finals of the competition. The flight stopped to refuel in Munich, because a non-stop flight from Belgrade to Manchester was beyond the range of the &quot;Elizabethan&quot;-class Airspeed Ambassador. After refuelling, pilots James Thain and Kenneth Rayment twice abandoned take-off because of boost surging in the left engine. Fearing they would fall too far behind schedule, Thain rejected an overnight stay in Munich in favour of a third take-off attempt. By that time, snow was falling, causing a layer of slush to form at the end of the runway. After hitting the slush, the aircraft ploughed through a fence beyond the end of the runway, and the left wing was torn off when it struck a house. The tail section broke off and hit a barn with a parked fuel truck in it, which caught fire and exploded. Fearing the aircraft might explode, Thain began evacuating passengers, while goalkeeper Harry Gregg helped pull survivors from the wreckage.

An investigation by West German airport authorities originally blamed Thain, saying he did not de-ice the aircraft&#x27;s wings, despite eyewitness statements indicating that de-icing was unnecessary. The last inquiry by the U.K. Board of Trade, released in 1969, found that the crash was caused by snow slush on the runway that slowed the plane too much to allow takeoff, and that Captain Thain was not to blame. 

United were aiming to become the third club to win three successive Football League titles. They were six points behind league leaders Wolverhampton Wanderers, with 14 games still to play. They held the FA Charity Shield and had just advanced into their second successive European Cup semi-finals. The team had not been beaten for 11 matches. The crash not only derailed the team&#x27;s title ambitions that year but also destroyed the nucleus of what promised to be one of the greatest generations of players in English football history. It took ten years for the club to recover after the tragedy. Busby rebuilt the team and won the European Cup in 1968 with a new generation of &quot;Babes&quot;.
==Background==
In April 1955, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) established the European Cup, a football competition for the champion clubs of UEFA-affiliated nations, the predecessor to the present-day UEFA Champions League, to begin in the 1955–56 season. The English league winners, Chelsea, were denied entry by the Football League&#x27;s secretary, Alan Hardaker, who believed not participating was best for English football. The following season, the English league was won by Manchester United, managed by Matt Busby. The Football League again denied their champions entry, but Busby and his chairman, Harold Hardman, with the help of the Football Association&#x27;s (FA) chairman Stanley Rous, defied the league and United became the first English team to play in Europe.

The team – known as the &quot;Busby Babes&quot; for their youth – reached the semi-finals, beaten there by the eventual winners, Real Madrid. Winning the First Division title again that season meant qualification for the 1957–58 tournament, and their semi-final run in 1956–57, meant they were one of the favourites to win. Domestic league matches were on Saturdays and European matches midweek, so, although air travel was risky, it was the only choice if United were to fulfil their league fixtures, which they would have to do if they were to avoid proving Hardaker right.

After overcoming Shamrock Rovers and Dukla Prague in the preliminary and first round respectively, United were drawn with Red Star Belgrade of Yugoslavia, now Serbia, for the quarter-finals. After beating them 2–1 at Old Trafford on 14 January 1958, the club was to travel to Yugoslavia for the return leg on 5 February. On the way back from Prague in the previous round, fog over England prevented the team from flying back to Manchester, so they flew to Amsterdam. They took the ferry from the Hook of Holland to Harwich, and then the train to Manchester. The trip took its toll on the players and they drew 3–3 with Birmingham City at St Andrew&#x27;s three days later.

Eager not to miss Football League fixtures, and not to have a difficult trip again, the club chartered a British European Airways (BEA) plane from Manchester to Belgrade, for the away leg against Red Star. The match was drawn 3–3 but it was enough to send United to the semi-finals. The takeoff from Belgrade was delayed for an hour after outside right Johnny Berry lost his passport. The plane landed in Munich, West Germany, for refuelling at 13:15 GMT.

===Aircraft and crew===
The aircraft was a six-year-old Airspeed Ambassador 2, built in 1952 and delivered to BEA the same year.

The pilot, Captain James Thain, was a former flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force (RAF). Originally a sergeant, later a warrant officer, he was given an emergency commission in the RAF as an acting pilot officer on probation in April 1944. He was promoted to pilot officer on probation in September 1944. He was promoted to flight lieutenant in May 1948, and received a permanent commission in the same rank in 1952. He retired from the RAF to join BEA.

The co-pilot, Captain Kenneth Rayment, was also a former RAF flight lieutenant and a Second World War flying ace. After joining the RAF in 1940, he was promoted to sergeant in September 1941. He was commissioned as a war substantive pilot officer a year later, and promoted to war substantive flying officer in May 1943. He shot down five German fighters, one Italian plane and a V-1 flying bomb. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in July 1943, and promoted to flight lieutenant in September 1943. After leaving the RAF in 1945, he joined British Overseas Airways Corporation in Cairo, before joining BEA in 1947. He had had experience with Vikings, Dakotas and the Ambassador &quot;Elizabethan&quot; class.

==Accident==

Thain had flown the &quot;Elizabethan&quot;-class Airspeed Ambassador, registration G-ALZU, to Belgrade but handed the controls to Rayment for the return. At 14:19 GMT, the control tower at Munich was told the plane was ready to take off and gave clearance for take-off, expiring at 14:31. Rayment abandoned the take-off after Thain noticed the port boost pressure gauge fluctuating as the plane reached full power, and the engine sounded odd while accelerating. A second attempt was made three minutes later, but called off 40 seconds into the attempt because the engines were running on an overrich mixture, causing them to overaccelerate, a common problem for the &quot;Elizabethan&quot;.

After the second failure, passengers retreated to the airport lounge. By then, it had started to snow heavily, and it looked unlikely that the plane would be making the return journey that day. Half-back Duncan Edwards sent a telegram to his landlady in Manchester, reading: &quot;All flights cancelled, flying tomorrow. Duncan.&quot;

Thain told the station engineer, Bill Black, about the problem with the boost surging in the port engine. Black suggested that since opening the throttle more slowly had not worked, the only option was to hold the plane overnight for retuning. Thain was anxious to stay on schedule and suggested that opening the throttle even more slowly would suffice. This would mean that the plane would not achieve take-off velocity until further down the runway, but with the runway almost long, he believed this would not be a problem. The passengers were called back to the plane 15 minutes after leaving it.

A few of the players were not confident fliers, particularly Billy Whelan, who said, &quot;This may be death, but I&#x27;m ready&quot;. Others, including Edwards, Tommy Taylor, Mark Jones, Eddie Colman and journalist Frank Swift, moved to the back of the plane, believing it safer. Once everyone was on board, Thain and Rayment got the plane moving again at 14:56. At 14:59, they reached the runway holding point, where they received clearance to line up ready for take-off. On the runway, they made final cockpit checks. At 15:02, they were told their take-off clearance would expire at 15:04. The pilots agreed to attempt take-off, but that they would watch the instruments for surging in the engines. At 15:03, they told the control tower of their decision.
Rayment moved the throttle forward slowly and released the brakes. The plane began to accelerate, and radio officer Bill Rodgers radioed the control tower with the message &quot;Zulu Uniform rolling&quot;. The plane threw up slush as it gathered speed, and Thain called out the plane&#x27;s velocity in 10-knot increments. At , the port engine began to surge again, and he pulled back marginally on the port throttle, before pushing it forward again.

Once the plane reached , he announced &quot;V1&quot;, at which it was no longer safe to abort take-off, and Rayment listened for the call of &quot;V2&quot; (), the minimum required to get off the ground. Thain expected the speed to rise, but it fluctuated around before suddenly dropping to , and then . Rayment shouted, &quot;Christ, we won&#x27;t make it!&quot;, as Thain looked up to see what lay ahead.

The plane skidded off the end of the runway, crashed into the fence surrounding the airport, and across a road. Its port wing was torn off as it caught a house, home to a family of six. The father and eldest daughter were away, and the mother and the other three children escaped as the house caught fire. Part of the plane&#x27;s tail was torn off, before the left side of the cockpit hit a tree. The right side of the fuselage hit a wooden hut, inside of which was a truck filled with tyres and fuel, which exploded. 

On seeing flames around the cockpit, Thain feared that the aircraft would explode, and told his crew to evacuate the area. The stewardesses, Rosemary Cheverton and Margaret Bellis, were the first to leave through a blown-out emergency window in the galley, followed by radio officer Rodgers. Rayment was trapped in his seat by the crumpled fuselage and told Thain to go without him. Thain clambered out of the galley window. On reaching the ground, he saw flames growing under the starboard wing, which held of fuel. He shouted to his crew to get away and climbed back into the aircraft to retrieve two handheld fire extinguishers, stopping to tell Rayment he would be back when the fires had been dealt with.

Meanwhile, in the cabin, goalkeeper Harry Gregg was regaining consciousness, thinking that he was dead. He felt blood on his face and &quot;didn&#x27;t dare put [his] hand up. [He] thought the top of [his] head had been taken off, like a hard boiled egg.&quot; Just above him, light shone into the cabin, so Gregg kicked the hole wide enough for him to escape. He managed to save some passengers, among them teammates Bobby Charlton and Dennis Viollet, who were strapped into their seats away from the wreckage.

==Investigation==
The crash was originally blamed on pilot error, but it was later found to have been caused by slush towards the end of the runway, slowing the aircraft and preventing safe flying speed. During take-off, the aircraft had reached , but, on entering the slush, dropped to , too slow to leave the ground, and with not enough runway to abort the take-off. Aircraft with tail-wheel undercarriages had not been greatly affected by slush, due to the geometry of these undercarriages in relation to the aircraft&#x27;s centre of gravity, but newer types, such as the Ambassador, with nose wheel landing-gear and the main wheels behind the centre of gravity, were found to be vulnerable.

Despite this conclusion, German airport authorities took legal action against Thain, as the one pilot who had survived the crash. They claimed he had taken off without clearing the wings of ice, which caused the crash, despite several witnesses stating that no ice had been seen. De-icing the aircraft was the captain&#x27;s responsibility, while the state of the airport&#x27;s runways was the responsibility of the airport authorities, among whom there was widespread ignorance of the danger of slush on runways for aircraft such as the Ambassador.

The basis of the German authorities&#x27; case relied on the icy condition of the wings hours after the crash and a photograph of the aircraft (published in several newspapers) taken shortly before take-off, that appeared to show snow on the upper wing surfaces. When the original negative was examined, no snow or ice could be seen, the &quot;snow&quot; in the original having been due to the sun reflecting off the wings, which was clarified when examining the negative rather than the published pictures which had been produced from a copy negative.

The witnesses were not called to the German inquiry, and proceedings against Thain dragged on until 1969, when he was finally cleared of any responsibility for the crash. As the official cause, British authorities recorded a build-up of melting snow on the runway, which prevented the plane from reaching the required take-off speed. Thain, having been dismissed by BEA on February 1961 and never re-engaged, retired and returned to run his poultry farm in Berkshire. He died of a heart attack at age 53, in August 1975.

==Aftermath==
Twenty people, including seven of Manchester United&#x27;s players, died at the scene of the crash. The 21st victim was Frank Swift, a journalist and former goalkeeper who played with Busby at Manchester City; he died on his way to hospital. Duncan Edwards died from his injuries on 21 February at the Rechts der Isar Hospital in Munich. The final death toll reached 23 several days later, when co-pilot Rayment died as a result of serious head injuries. Johnny Berry and Jackie Blanchflower were both injured so severely that they never played again.

Busby was seriously injured and had to stay in hospital for more than two months after the crash, and was given the Last Rites twice. After being discharged from hospital, he went to Switzerland to recuperate in Interlaken. At times, he felt like giving up football entirely, until he was told by his wife, Jean, &quot;You know Matt, the lads would have wanted you to carry on.&quot; That statement lifted Busby from his depression, and he returned by land and sea to Manchester, before watching his team play in the 1958 FA Cup final.

Meanwhile, there was speculation that the club would fold, but a threadbare United team completed the 1957–58 season, with Busby&#x27;s assistant Jimmy Murphy standing in as manager; he had not travelled to Belgrade as he was in Cardiff managing the Wales national team at the time. A team largely made up of reserve and youth team players beat Sheffield Wednesday 3–0 in the first match after the disaster. The programme for that match showed simply a blank space where each United player&#x27;s name should have been. With seven players dead (Edwards died just over 24 hours later), and with only Gregg and Foulkes fit to play out of the surviving players, United were desperate to find replacements with experience, so Murphy signed Ernie Taylor from Blackpool and Stan Crowther from Aston Villa.

Three players, Derek Lewin, Bob Hardisty and Warren Bradley, were transferred to United on short-term contracts by non-League club Bishop Auckland. Bradley was the only one of the three players to play for the first team, and the only one to sign a permanent contract. The remaining places in the team were filled by reserve players including Shay Brennan and Mark Pearson. United&#x27;s fierce rivals Liverpool offered them five loan players to help put a side together.

There were changes in the backroom staff at United too, following the deaths of secretary Walter Crickmer and coaches Tom Curry and Bert Whalley. Goalkeeper Les Olive, still registered as a player at the time of the disaster, retired from playing and took over from Crickmer as club secretary. Another former United goalkeeper, Jack Crompton, took over coaching duties after United chairman Harold Hardman had negotiated with Crompton&#x27;s then-employers Luton Town for his release.

United only won one more league game in the 1957–58 season after the crash, causing their title challenge to collapse and they fell to ninth place. They managed to reach the FA Cup final, but lost 2–0 to Bolton Wanderers, and beat Milan at Old Trafford in the European Cup semi-finals, only to lose 4–0 at the San Siro. Real Madrid, who went on to win the trophy for the third year running, suggested that Manchester United be awarded the trophy for that year – a suggestion supported by Red Star Belgrade – but this failed to materialise. After the tragedy, UEFA floated the idea of Manchester City taking United&#x27;s place in the European Cup, had United not been able to fulfil their fixtures, but this was rejected by all parties involved, City in particular.

Busby resumed managerial duties the following season. Real Madrid offered to loan Alfredo Di Stefano until the end of the season for half his wages, but the transfer was blocked by the FA, as it would prevent a British player to take that spot in the team. Madrid instead raised funds and organized charity friendly matches with United. Eventually, Busby built a second generation of Busby Babes, including George Best and Denis Law, that ten years later won the European Cup by beating two-time winners Benfica. Charlton and Foulkes were the only two crash survivors who lined up in that team.

A fund for dependents of victims of the crash was established in March 1958, and chaired by the Chairman of the FA, Arthur Drewry. The fund raised £52,000 (equivalent to £ as of ) by the time of its disbursement in October 1958.

Manchester United announced on 8 January 1963 that legal action against BEA relating to the crash had been settled out of court. Club secretary Les Olive said the amount involved was not being disclosed. A BEA statement said: &quot;A settlement has been made and an application will be made to the court on Friday, January 11, to stay proceedings.&quot;

==Memorials==
===Old Trafford===

The first memorials at Old Trafford to the lost players and staff were unveiled on 25 February 1960. The first, a plaque in the shape of the stadium with the image of a green pitch, inscribed with the names of the victims in black and gold glass, was placed above the entrance to the directors&#x27; box. Above the plaque was a teak carving of a player and a supporter, heads bowed either side of a wreath and a football inscribed with the date &quot;1958&quot;. The plaque was designed by Manchester architect J. Vipond and constructed by Messrs Jaconello (Manchester) Ltd. at a cost of £2,100, and unveiled by Matt Busby.

Also unveiled that day was a memorial to the members of the press who died at Munich, which consisted of a bronze plaque that named the eight lost journalists. It was unveiled by crash survivor Frank Taylor on behalf of the Football Writers&#x27; Association. The original plaque was stolen in the 1980s and replaced by a replica now behind the counter in the press entrance. The final memorial was the Munich clock, a simple two-faced clock paid for by the Ground Committee and attached to the southeast corner of the stadium, with the date &quot;6 Feb 1958&quot; at the top of both faces and &quot;Munich&quot; at the bottom. The clock has remained in the same position since it was first installed. The clock was unveiled on 25 February 1960 by Dan Marsden, the chairman of the Ground Committee.

When the stadium was renovated in the mid-1970s, the plaque had to be moved from the directors&#x27; entrance to allow the necessary changes. The plaque could not be removed without damaging it, so the old memorial was walled up within the Main Stand and a new memorial was made, simpler than the original, now consisting simply of a slate pitch with the names inscribed upon it, and installed in 1976.

A third version of the memorial, more like the original than the second in that it included the stands around the slate pitch and the figures above it, was installed in 1996, coinciding with the erection of the statue of Matt Busby, who had unveiled the original memorial. This third version was constructed by stonemasons Mather and Ellis from Trafford Park, and the second was put into storage. It is currently awaiting new display panels before being placed into the club museum&#x27;s Munich display. The third plaque and the statue of Busby were originally on the north side of the East Stand, but the statue was moved to the front of the East Stand and the plaque to the south side of the stand after the stand&#x27;s expansion in 2000.

===Munich===

There are also two memorials in Germany. First, in the Munich suburb of Trudering, on the corner of Karotschstraße and Emplstraße, there is a small wooden memorial depicting the Crucifixion, decorated by a stone trough filled with flowers. The trough bears a plaque with the inscription: &quot;Im Gedenken an die Opfer der Flugzeugkatastrophe am 6.2.1958 unter denen sich auch ein Teil der Fußballmannschaft von Manchester United befand, sowie allen Verkehrstoten der Gemeinde Trudering&quot; (&quot;In memory of the victims of the air disaster of 6 February 1958 including members of the football team of Manchester United as well as all the traffic victims from the municipality of Trudering&quot;).
On 22 September 2004, a dark blue granite plaque set in a sandstone border was unveiled in the vicinity of the old Munich Airport on the corner of Rappenweg and Emplstraße, just metres from the wooden memorial. With a design in the shape of a football pitch, it reads, in both English and German, &quot;In memory of all those who lost their lives here in the Munich air disaster on 6 February 1958&quot;. 

Underneath is a plaque expressing United&#x27;s gratitude to the municipality of Munich and its people. The new memorial was funded by Manchester United themselves and the unveiling was attended by club officials, including chief executive David Gill, manager Sir Alex Ferguson and director Sir Bobby Charlton, a survivor of the disaster himself. On 24 April 2008, the Munich city council decided to name the site where the memorial stone is placed &quot;Manchesterplatz&quot; (&quot;Manchester Square&quot;).

On the 57th anniversary of the crash, 6 February 2015, Charlton and Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge opened a new museum exhibit commemorating the disaster at the German club&#x27;s stadium, the Allianz Arena.

===Belgrade===
There is a small display of artefacts at the Majestic Hotel, where the team stayed after the match. These include a menu card signed by 14 of the players, including the eight who were killed, a photograph taken at the meal and a match ticket. The menu card was acquired by the then-British ambassador to Yugoslavia and was auctioned by his son in 2006. Also at the hotel is the piano played by Manchester United&#x27;s Mark Jones the night before the accident.

===40th anniversary===
In late 1997, John Doherty (a former United player who had left the club shortly before the disaster) approached club chairman Martin Edwards on behalf of the Manchester United Former Players&#x27; Association to request a testimonial for those victims of the Munich disaster – both the survivors and the dependants of the ones who were lost. Edwards was hesitant, but a benefit match was eventually sanctioned for a date as close to the 40th anniversary of the disaster as possible. Red Star Belgrade and Bayern Munich were touted as possible opponents for the match, and fans purchased tickets without the opponents even having been decided.

In the midst of the preparations, former United player Eric Cantona, who had retired from football to pursue a career in film in 1997, expressed an interest in returning to the club for a farewell match. Edwards took the opportunity to combine the two events into one. Due to Cantona&#x27;s acting career, his schedule meant that he would not be available in February 1998 and the match was moved to 18 August, with the opposition to be a European XI chosen by Cantona; the side selected by Cantona featured the likes of French internationals Laurent Blanc, Pascal Vahirua and Jean-Pierre Papin; England&#x27;s Paul Gascoigne; former United players Bryan Robson and Mark Hughes; and Cantona&#x27;s brother Joël. Cantona himself played the first half of the match for the European XI, before switching sides at half-time. United ultimately won the match 8–4, with goals from Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Jordi Cruyff, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt, Alex Notman (2) and Cantona; while Papin, Blanc, Martin Dahlin and United player Mark Wilson were the scorers for the European XI.

Edwards was criticised for turning the match into a publicity stunt, while Elizabeth Wood, the divorced wife of survivor Ray Wood, compared the treatment of the Munich victims to that of &quot;dancing bears at the circus&quot;. Nevertheless, the match earned £47,000 for each of the victims&#x27; families, while Cantona recouped over £90,000 in expenses directly from the testimonial fund, rather than from the club. The club also received criticism from some quarters for its poor treatment of the survivors: Berry and Blanchflower were forced to leave the flats they rented from the club to make way for new players. Berry was also notified by post that his employment with the club had been terminated. Another survivor, Ray Wood, complained about the lack of recognition from the club: &quot;We feel that we helped to build Manchester United... They received massive international support following the disaster but they didn&#x27;t treat people properly then, did nothing for us all those years, and they&#x27;re still making money out of it directly now.&quot;

On 7 February 1998, United played Bolton Wanderers at Old Trafford in the Premier League a day after the 40th anniversary of the disaster. The match kicked off at 3:15 p.m. to allow a minute&#x27;s silence to be observed at 3:04 p.m. Representatives from both teams laid floral tributes to those who died, with crash survivor and United director Bobby Charlton joined by Bolton president Nat Lofthouse in leading out the two teams.

===50th anniversary===

A memorial service was held at Old Trafford on 6 February 2008 to mark the 50th anniversary of the disaster. At the conclusion of the service, the surviving members of the 1958 team were the guests of honour at a ceremony to rename the tunnel under the stadium&#x27;s South Stand as the &quot;Munich Tunnel&quot;, which features an exhibition about the Busby Babes. A memorial billboard was unveiled outside Old Trafford, but it was criticized by some fans for including the logo of club&#x27;s then-sponsor, American insurance firm AIG. The poster was later vandalised with paint bombs.

On the same day, the England national football team took on Switzerland at Wembley Stadium. Before the game, pictures of the players who lost their lives at Munich were displayed on big screens, and the England players wore black armbands. There was also a tribute to the Busby Babes in the match programme. Originally, there was no plan to observe a minute&#x27;s silence on the day, because the FA feared that the silence would not be respected by fans of United&#x27;s rivals. They eventually agreed that a moment of silence should be held and, in the event, it was generally well-observed; however, a small number of supporters made whistles and cat-calls and the referee cut the silence short after less than 30 seconds. One-minute silences were also observed at the Northern Ireland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland games.
At the derby match between United and City at Old Trafford on 10 February 2008, both teams were led onto the pitch by a lone piper playing &quot;The Red Flag&quot;, and the managers – Sir Alex Ferguson and Sven-Göran Eriksson – each laid a wreath in the centre circle. This was followed by a minute&#x27;s silence, which, despite previous concerns, was respected by all the fans. Kevin Parker, secretary of City&#x27;s supporters club, had suggested a minute of applause instead of a minute&#x27;s silence, so as to drown out anyone who would disrupt the silence, but this was rejected by the United management as inappropriate. 

United played in strips reminiscent of those worn by the 1958 team, numbered 1 to 11, with no advertising on the front or players&#x27; names on the back, while City removed sponsors&#x27; logos from their kit and the image of a small black ribbon was heat pressed onto the right shoulder. Both teams wore black armbands in tribute to the victims of the Munich disaster. Manchester City won 2–1 thanks to first-half goals from Darius Vassell and debutant Benjani. Fans in attendance were given commemorative scarves – in red and white for the United fans, and sky blue and white for the City fans – which were held up during the silence.

==Tributes==
===Music===
Several musical tributes to the Munich air disaster have been recorded, the earliest being the song &quot;The Flowers of Manchester&quot;. Written by an anonymous author, later revealed to be Eric Winter, the editor of the magazine &quot;Sing&quot;, the song was recorded and released by Liverpool folk band The Spinners on their 1962 debut album &quot;Quayside Songs Old and New&quot;. Manchester-born singer Morrissey also released a song called &quot;Munich Air Disaster, 1958&quot; as a B-side to &quot;Irish Blood, English Heart&quot; in 2004. It later appeared on his live album, &quot;Live at Earls Court&quot;, in 2005 and his 2009 B-sides compilation, &quot;Swords&quot;.

Most recently, the English band The Futureheads named their album &quot;News and Tributes&quot; in honour of the disaster. The title track pays tribute to those who lost their lives, and includes the verse:

===Film===
Barry Navidi, producer of the 2004 film &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, was reported to be working on a script for a Hollywood film about the Munich air crash. The &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; reported on 22 April 2005 that the survivors had not been consulted and were concerned about how accurate the film would be.

Foulkes said that, if done right, the film could become a &quot;tribute to the Busby Babes which could be seen for generations to come&quot;; however, he expressed concerns about the accuracy of the film, given the filmmakers&#x27; lack of first-hand sources about what actually happened in Munich. Fellow survivor Harry Gregg was more concerned about the portrayal of the players, particularly those who died, and whether their families&#x27; feelings would be respected. John Doherty, a player who had left United only a few months before the crash, was less restrained, saying that &quot;the only reason anyone would want to make a film like this is to make money&quot; and that &quot;while there may be a slight hint of truth in the film, it will be mainly untruths... Unless you were there, how could you know what conversations took place?&quot;.

===Television===
On 10 January 2006, the BBC showed a drama/documentary retelling the story in the series &quot;Surviving Disaster&quot;. The programme was met with criticism from former United winger Albert Scanlon, who claimed that it was full of inaccuracies, despite the production having consulted him about the content of the documentary. Errors in the programme included the depiction of Jimmy Murphy giving a pre-match team talk in Belgrade, despite him being in Cardiff at the time, and the plane being shown as only half full when nearly every seat was occupied.

On 6 February 2008, the 50th anniversary of the crash, several television channels showed programmes about it:
* UKTV History aired the BBC co-produced drama documentary &quot;Surviving Disaster&quot; to mark the 50th anniversary of the tragedy.
* MUTV aired a segmented documentary called &quot;Munich Remembered&quot;, aired throughout the day with memories of players, staff and supporters.
* The BBC showed as part of its &quot;One Life&quot; series a documentary following United goalkeeper Harry Gregg retracing his route from England to Belgrade to Munich. He met and talked with some of the first rescuers who had arrived on the scene. He also met Vera Lukić, the pregnant mother whom he had rescued and Zoran, the son she bore two months later.

Since the anniversary, two television programmes have been made about the disaster:
* A 2011 made-for-television film &quot;United&quot;, written by Chris Chibnall and directed by James Strong for the BBC, tells the story of the crash and the subsequent rebuilding of Manchester United as a footballing force. The story was seen largely through the eyes of coach Jimmy Murphy, who became &quot;de facto&quot; manager of the team while Busby recovered from the crash. The role of Murphy was played by David Tennant. The film gained generally good reviews, especially for its evocation of the period and for Tennant&#x27;s acting, and was nominated at the Prix Europa 2011 Awards as &quot;Best European TV Production&quot;. It was, however, condemned by Sandy Busby, the son of Matt Busby, who said he thought the film was &quot;very poorly done&quot;, and strongly criticised the film&#x27;s portrayal of his father.
* The Canadian TV series &quot;Mayday / Air Crash Investigation&quot; covered the crash in episode 77 (season 11, #5), first broadcast in December 2011. The episode covers the background of the flight, then investigates what caused the fatal crash.

===Literature===
The story of the disaster was fictionalised in &quot;Munichs&quot; (2024), by David Peace. The novel covers the disaster and its aftermath, ending with Manchester United’s defeat in the 1958 FA Cup Final. The title alludes to the use of the word “Munichs” as a term of abuse towards Manchester United supporters, which the author believes should be “reclaimed and worn as a badge of pride”. 

===Other===
The University of Salford honoured Munich victim Eddie Colman by naming one of its halls of residence after him. Colman was born in Salford in 1936. There is a network of small roads in Newton Heath named after the players who lost their lives in Munich, including Roger Byrne Close, David Pegg Walk, Geoff Bent Walk, Eddie Colman Close, Billy Whelan Walk, Tommy Taylor Close and Mark Jones Walk. Among those roads is an old people&#x27;s home named after Duncan Edwards. 

Edwards was honoured with street names in his home town of Dudley. There is a small close off Stourbridge Road named Duncan Edwards Close. In 2008, the Dudley Southern Bypass was renamed Duncan Edwards Way. The road bridge over the Luas tram line at Fassaugh Road, Cabra, Dublin 7 is named after Billy Whelan.

<text>Grimbergen () is a municipality in the province of Flemish Brabant, in the Flemish region of Belgium, north of the capital Brussels. The municipality comprises the towns of Beigem, Grimbergen, Humbeek, and Strombeek-Bever. In 2017, Grimbergen had a total population of 37,030. The total area is , which gives a population density of , this is not much for a Region.

Grimbergen is in the Dutch language area of Belgium. The French-speaking minority is represented by four members on the 30-seat local council. Grimbergen is mostly known for its Norbertine abbey and the beer once brewed there. Grimbergen&#x27;s proximity to Brussels makes it a residential town for commuting.

==History==

===Roman Empire and Middle Ages===
In Roman times, several important roads passed near the territory of present Grimbergen. A fort was built in the 8th century at the strategic point where the road crossed the river Zenne. The local lord soon acquired a large piece of territory in this area, extending to the rivers Scheldt, Rupel, and Dender.
In the 12th century, the name of the hamlet was &quot;Grentberghis, &quot; which came from the Old Dutch &quot;Grientbergen,&quot; meaning mounds of coarse sand. A community of Augustinian monks had already tried to settle here a century earlier during the reign of Godfrey III, Duke of Lower Lorraine, but it was only in the early 12th century that their religious community prospered. Under the leadership of Norbert of Xanten, the Norbertine monks built the Grimbergen Abbey here in 1128, founding a beer brewery. A few years later, the animosity between the powerful Grimbergen family and their then infant overlord Godfrey III of Leuven precipitated the Wars of Grimbergen. The unrest caused the destruction of the local castle by the Duke of Brabant, the move of the ruling Grimbergen lord to nearby Ninove, and the parceling of his territory. The city&#x27;s coat of arms dates from that period.

At the beginning of the 14th century, half of the territory became part of the estate of the House of Nassau. Like everywhere else in Flanders, the Wars of Religion of the end of the 16th century caused widespread destruction. In 1752, Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange, who had received the land from her consort William IV, Prince of Orange-Nassau, ceded the barony to the Prince of Berghes, who owned the other half, thereby reuniting the original land of Grimbergen as a single, but short-lived, princedom.

===After the French Revolution===
The feudal regime and the power of the lords came to an abrupt end under the French Regime in 1794. The clerical powers of the abbey were abrogated a couple of years later, until a few years after the Belgian Revolution of 1830.

Up until then, the town&#x27;s character was mostly rural and agricultural. In the middle of the 19th century, the new road linking Vilvoorde to Aalst and the Brussels-Willebroek canal started attracting industrial concerns. The vicinal tramway arrived in 1887, and a local airfield was built after World War I.

==Sights==
Grimbergen is home to the following sights:
*The majestic church of the Grimbergen Abbey, dedicated to Saint Servatius, patron saint of the city, was rebuilt several times since its foundation in 1128. The current construction dates from 1660 and ranks among the most harmonious Baroque buildings in Belgium. The tower houses a 49-bell carillon. The houses lining the central square in front of the church have also been rebuilt in the original style of the 18th century. In 1999, the church of Grimbergen was given the title of basilica.
*The Grimbergen beer museum is located next door and gives its visitors an opportunity to taste the famous local brew.
*The oldest astronomical public observatory in the country is located in the former farm dependencies of the abbey.
*Grimbergen is particularly rich in castles, counting four of them on its territory, including the beautiful 17th century Renaissance-style &quot;Guldendal&quot;, and the ruins of the lords of Grimbergen&#x27;s old keep now named the &quot;Prinsenkasteel&quot;. It also counts several farms dating from the 17th century as well as two medieval water mills.
*&quot;Volkssterrenwacht Mira&quot;. It is the oldest planetarium in Belgium founded in 1967. The original planetarium was located in the Abbey of Grimbergen, however in 2000 an extension was added.

== Demographics ==
==Events and sports==
*The main annual event is the &quot;Sint-Servaasommegang&quot;, loosely translated as procession of Saint Servatius. It dates from 1280 and takes place on the Saint&#x27;s birthday, May 13, or on the first following Sunday.
*A well-attended kermesse takes place on the first Sunday of September.
*A nativity scene is organized in the abbey church around Christmas.
*The main football club used to be K.F.C. Strombeek, but is now named F.C. Molenbeek Brussels Strombeek and located in neighboring Sint-Jans-Molenbeek.
*Since 2015 Grimbergen has its own field hockey club named Merode Hockey Grimbergen. After only three years they got enough funding together to build a state of the art hockey field. Starting from January 2019 the club will be playing their own field at the Populierendallaan 111.

<text>Kapelle-op-den-Bos () is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Flemish Brabant. The municipality comprises the towns of Kapelle-op-den-Bos proper, Nieuwenrode and Ramsdonk. On January 1, 2006, Kapelle-op-den-Bos had a total population of 8,904. The total area is 15.25 km2 which gives a population density of 584 inhabitants per km2.

Located at the intersection of the Willebroek to Brussels shipping canal and the Mechelen-Ghent railway line, the town is home to the Etex Group NV group of companies, which manufacture piping, roofing, gyprock and cement products. Numerous other industrial companies call Kapelle-op-den-Bos home, and the General Secondary College Sint-Theresia College (STK) has a wide catchment extending beyond municipal boundaries.

The town was a target for heavy bombing during the First World War due to its proximity to transport routes. Among the many buildings destroyed was the parish church dedicated to Saint Nicholas, which was later rebuilt with a modern flavour; the nave retained its original arched windows, but the steeple now appears as a crown.

Kapelle-op-den-Bos is heavily polluted with asbestos. Many inhabitants of the village died due to this mortal pollution. Health problems caused by the asbestos pollution still remain a major problem for the whole area.

They can request official documents from the local administration in French. Today, a majority of the inhabitants are French-speaking.

== Urbanisation ==
The forest of Stokkel belonged to the d&#x27;Huart family until the 1920s. When grandfather d&#x27;Huart died in 1927, his family decided to found &quot;la Société Immobilière de Stockel&quot; and built a lane through the forest. This lane is the current Albert d&#x27;Huartlaan that used to be covered with gravel until 1960. 

The homes surrounding the &quot;Hurlevent&quot; were built and afterwards those of the society of Utrecht. The real construction started in 1930 and accelerated after the second world war. Approximately 2800 people lived in Kraainem in 1940, 3254 in 1945 and 5190 in 1954, which was the year in which urbanisation really experienced its surge.

In 1949 the social housing of Eigen Haard were built followed by the Josephine Charlotte neighbourhood in 1954. Over 11,000 persons lived in the Kraainem region in 1967. In 1993, of a total population of 12,780 residents, 2,623 were immigrants. Despite being located in Flanders, Kraainem became increasingly francophone during the 20th century, reducing the Dutch-speakers to a minority. Communal politics is centred upon the language issue. Given the commune&#x27;s proximity and good transport links to the airport, to NATO and to the European Quarter, an increasing number of non-Belgians have settled in the municipality and this trend looks set to continue as the few remaining greenfield sites are developed.

The commune has two state schools, one Dutch and one francophone, and in 1968 the new St-Dominicus chapel was inaugurated.

The southern end of the Albert d&#x27;Huartlaan boulevard feeds onto the Quatre Bras road intersection, where the Brussels Ring (R0) and Avenue de Tervueren (N3) meet (alongside a stop on the Brussels tram route 44). Other parts of the municipality are served by Brussels tram route 39, while three stations on Brussels Metro line 1 (including the one named Kraainem) are situated just over the boundary into the Brussels city-region.

== Tourism ==
Its rich industrial and cultural legacy, in addition to its favorable location next to Brussels and the Zaventem Airport, have enabled Kraainem to develop its position as a touristic destination in recent years. The 8th century St. Pancras Church, the 20th century Bouvier-Washer Cité and its Salesian monastery are popular attractions for tourists. A lack of local lodging infrastructure has slowed touristic development until the early 2000s, when guest houses and AirBnB resolved this shortcoming.

<text>Liedekerke () is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Flemish Brabant. On January 1, 2006, Liedekerke had a total population of 11,920. It is also situated in the Pajottenland.The total area is 10.08 km2 which results in a population density of 1,183 inhabitants per km2. Liedekerke means &quot;church on the little hill.&quot;


==History==
From the Carolingian era until the 11th century, Liedekerke was a part of the Shire of Brabant. Around 1056–1059, Baldwin V, Count of Flanders acquired the northwestern part of the village as a fief from the German emperor. This county ranged from the Scheldt and Dender rivers and also encompassed several other villages along the Dender, among which was Liedekerke. The name &quot;&quot;Liekercke&quot;, which means &quot;church on the little hill&quot;&quot;, was first drawn up as part of the county in 1092.

The fortress of the dukes of Brabant was near the Dender, on the land of Denderleeuw, with which it formed a Dominium. Through marriage of the Jacques, Marquess of Veere and Marie of Hanaert, Baronnes of Liedekercke the house of Hénin-Liétard became resident Lords of the former castle.

Between 1796 and 1815, during the French occupation, Liedekerke became part of the department of the Dyle and in 1815 it became part of South Brabant. The old castle was destroyed.

==Notable inhabitants==

* Maximilien II de Hénin, 5th Count of Bossu, died inside Liedekerke Castle.
* Karl Heeremans (1937-2010), painter 
* Rita Deneve (1944-), singer 
* Jonas Heymans (1993-), footballer

<text>Low Force is an 18-foot (5.5m) high set of falls on the River Tees, England, UK. Further upstream is the High Force waterfall. Low Force is also the site of the Wynch Bridge, completed in 1830. It is suggested by signs at each end that only one person at a time should cross the bridge as it may be unstable. 

==Geography==
Low Force is within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and European Geopark. Low Force lies on the historic county boundary between the North Riding of Yorkshire on the south bank, and County Durham on the north bank; since the local government reforms of 1974, however, the south bank of the Tees in Teesdale has also been included within County Durham for administrative purposes.

==In popular culture==
Sections of the film &quot;1917&quot; were shot near the site in June 2019. The production staff had to install signs warning walkers in the area not to be alarmed at the prosthetic bodies strewn around the site.

In 2020 production crews arrived on the banks of the Tees to film scenes for the popular Netflix series &#x27;The Witcher&#x27; with Low Force featuring in episode seven of season two.

<doc id="157527" wikidata="Q375643" url="?curid=157527" title="List of cities in New Zealand">
<text>The word &quot;city&quot; took on two meanings in New Zealand after the local government reforms of 1989. Before the reforms, a borough that had a population of 20,000 or more could be proclaimed a city. The boundaries of councils tended to follow the edge of the built-up area, so there was little difference between the urban area and the local government area. In 1989, the structure of local government in New Zealand was significantly reorganised. Almost all the new district councils and city councils were much larger in land area, and they covered both urban land and the surrounding rural land. Many locations that once had a &quot;city council&quot; are now governed by a &quot;district council&quot;. Since 2002, an urban area must have at least 50,000 residents to be proclaimed a city.

The word &quot;city&quot; is used in a general sense to identify the urban areas of New Zealand, independent of local body boundaries. This informal usage is jealously guarded. The district government of the town of Gisborne, for example, adamantly described itself as the first &quot;city&quot; in the world to see the new millennium. Gisborne is governed by a &quot;district council&quot;, though its status as a city is not generally disputed in New Zealand. Similarly, there is no &quot;city council&quot; in Auckland, though its status as a city is not generally disputed due to its considerable size.

Listed below are the large urban areas referred to colloquially as &quot;cities&quot;.

== Urban areas by population ==
===Urban areas based on 2018 standard===
Statistics New Zealand creates standards for statistical geographic areas that are the basis for determining population figures. Statistics New Zealand announced in 2017 that the Statistical Standard for Geographic Areas 2018 (SSGA18) would replace the New Zealand Standard Areas Classification 1992 (NZSAC92). The change impacted Wellington most, by splitting it into four urban areas, being the Wellington city and Lower Hutt city &quot;major urban areas&quot; and Porirua and Upper Hutt &quot;large urban areas&quot;. As defined by SSGA18, Wellington approximately halved in size, and Lower Hutt entered the city rankings in sixth place between Tauranga and Dunedin. 

The table below contains all &quot;major urban areas&quot; (100,000 or more residents) and all &quot;large urban areas&quot; (30,000 to 99,999 residents). The urban area that will next move from the &quot;medium urban area&quot; category to the &quot;large urban area&quot; category is Paraparaumu ().

===Functional urban areas (metropolitan areas)===
Functional urban areas (FUAs) are geographic areas which represent the functional extent of major, large and medium urban areas, based on commuting patterns. Functional urban areas correspond to New Zealand&#x27;s metropolitan areas.

FUA populations are as at the 2018 Census.
== City councils ==

=== Populations of present-day city (and Auckland) councils ===
The populations given are the latest Statistics New Zealand estimated resident populations.
Many cities were reorganised into districts by the Local Government Commission in 1989 under the Local Government Act 1974, for example Timaru. Other urban areas that are no longer cities, such as Rotorua and Whangārei, have higher populations than some present cities. The most recently proclaimed city is Tauranga, which became a city, for the second time, from 1 March 2004. Christchurch (1862 and 1868) and Invercargill (1930 and 1991) have also been declared cities more than once.

Under Section 27 of the Local Government Act 2002, a district may become a city by either a &quot;reorganisation scheme&quot; with the Local Government Commission, or under Section 27(1) it may apply for a change in status under Schedule 3, Clause 7. The new city must have &quot;a population of not less than 50,000 persons&quot;, be &quot;predominantly urban&quot; and &quot;a distinct entity and a major centre of activity within the region&quot; (or regions) that it is encompassed by. Existing cities are grandfathered under Schedule 2, Part 2 of the Act. The only new city council so far under this section is the Tauranga City Council, from 1 March 2004.

Previously, under Section 37L of the Local Government Act 1974, new cities could only be formed from a &quot;reorganisation scheme&quot;. The same criteria were used. The last city to be constituted under this section was Invercargill, which was re-reorganised into a city in 1991.

In 1991, the Lower Hutt City Council became the Hutt City Council by a special Act of Parliament which did not change the name of the city of Lower Hutt; the city&#x27;s coat of arms still refers to the &quot;City of Lower Hutt&quot;.

== History of cities ==
Prior to 1876, there was no official definition of a city or uniform system of local authorities in New Zealand. There is thus some argument over which settlement was the first city in New Zealand.

===Letters patent===

Traditionally in the United Kingdom (the former colonial power of New Zealand), city status is a special status granted by the monarch, usually by the issuing of letters patent. Between the 16th century and 1888, city status was associated with the presence of a diocesan cathedral. In 1841 the Diocese of New Zealand was established, based in Auckland, however no letters patent were ever issued. The Diocese of New Zealand was split in 1856 with the southern part becoming the Diocese of Christchurch. Christchurch was subsequently issued letters patent by Queen Victoria and became the &quot;City of Christchurch&quot;. Despite the formation of other dioceses in New Zealand, the only other city to be subsequently issued letters patent was Nelson in 1858.

===Electorates===

Under the Provincial Councils Act 1851, the Governor had the right to establish electorates for provincial legislative councils. On 21 May 1852, Governor George Grey proclaimed electorates for New Ulster. Although the proclamation explicitly defined Auckland as a &quot;town&quot; for the purpose of property franchise, it later defined the electorate &quot;City of Auckland&quot;. This ambiguous proclamation was the first official use of the term &quot;city&quot; in New Zealand legislation. The electorates of New Munster were also declared a short time later on 1 June. Likewise, Wellington was described as a town for property franchise, but more ambiguously established an electorate referred in different parts of the proclamation as either &quot;City of Wellington&quot; or &quot;Town of Wellington&quot;. The provinces of New Ulster and New Munster were disestablished only a month later by the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, however, the electorates of both &quot;City of Auckland&quot; and &quot;City of Wellington&quot; were carried forward to the first nationwide election of 1853.

===City councils===

The first municipal council to bear the title of &quot;city council&quot; was the Auckland City Council formed in 1854 by act of the Auckland Provincial Council. Following the election of an anti-taxation superintendent in March 1855, William Brown, the Auckland City Council was dissolved and formally disestablished 1856. A new Auckland City Council would be established in 1871, which was later was merged into Auckland Council in 2010.

The Christchurch City Council was formed by an act of the Canterbury Provincial Council which received Royal assent on 31 January 1863. The council has been active since and is therefore the longest continuously operating city council in New Zealand.

A legal oddity also provides Dunedin with a minor claim to being New Zealand&#x27;s oldest city. Legal disputes over the powers that the Otago Provincial Council delegated to the newly formed Dunedin City Council in 1865, resulted in the central government stepping in and confirming its powers. Consequently, Dunedin City Council was the first council recognised in central government law. Furthermore, the central government passed legislation in 1868 to better regulate municipal councils across the country. Dunedin was already under the provisions and was therefore unaffected. The new act brought all other &quot;city councils&quot; in New Zealand under the central government regulations as &quot;borough councils&quot;. The name change, however, was only due to an oversight in the language of the act and an amendment was made in November 1868 allowing some councils to revert to using the title of &quot;city council&quot;. As the act, and therefore the brief name change, did not apply to Dunedin, Dunedin City Council can claim to have the longest continuous use of the title &quot;city council&quot;.

===Summary of claims as New Zealand&#x27;s first city===

=== Cities, 1877 to 1989 ===
The schedule of cities in New Zealand was brought under central government control in 1867, but continued to be sporadically applied. From 1886 the definition of a city was changed to any borough with a population of 20,000 or more. This value was increased to 50,000 in 1989.

Up to October 1989, the Local Government Commission undertook reorganisations of local government. As a result, some cities were reorganised into other larger cities or changed to districts, and some of these areas are still considered cities by many New Zealanders. This is a list as at .

<doc id="157529" wikidata="Q160796" url="?curid=157529" title="Delirium">
<text>Delirium (formerly acute confusional state, an ambiguous term that is now discouraged) is a specific state of acute confusion attributable to the direct physiological consequence of a medical condition, effects of a psychoactive substance, or multiple causes, which usually develops over the course of hours to days. As a syndrome, delirium presents with disturbances in attention, awareness, and higher-order cognition. People with delirium may experience other neuropsychiatric disturbances including changes in psychomotor activity (e.g., hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed level of activity), disrupted sleep-wake cycle, emotional disturbances, disturbances of consciousness, or, altered state of consciousness, as well as perceptual disturbances (e.g., hallucinations and delusions), although these features are not required for diagnosis.
Diagnostically, delirium encompasses both the syndrome of acute confusion and its underlying organic process known as an acute encephalopathy. The cause of delirium may be either a disease process &quot;inside&quot; the brain or a process &quot;outside&quot; the brain that nonetheless affects the brain. Delirium may be the result of an underlying medical condition (e.g., infection or hypoxia), side effect of a medication such as diphenhydramine, promethazine, and dicyclomine, substance intoxication (e.g., opioids or hallucinogenic deliriants), substance withdrawal (e.g., alcohol or sedatives), or from multiple factors affecting one&#x27;s overall health (e.g., malnutrition, pain, etc.). In contrast, the emotional and behavioral features due to primary psychiatric disorders (e.g., as in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) do not meet the diagnostic criteria for &#x27;delirium&#x27;.
Delirium may be difficult to diagnose without first establishing a person&#x27;s usual mental function or &#x27;cognitive baseline&#x27;. Delirium may be confused with multiple psychiatric disorders or chronic organic brain syndromes because of many overlapping signs and symptoms in common with dementia, depression, psychosis, etc. Delirium may occur in persons with existing mental illness, baseline intellectual disability, or dementia, entirely unrelated to any of these conditions. Delirium is often confused with schizophrenia, psychosis, organic brain syndromes, and more, because of similar signs and symptoms of these disorders.
Treatment of delirium requires identifying and managing the underlying causes, managing delirium symptoms, and reducing the risk of complications. In some cases, temporary or symptomatic treatments are used to comfort the person or to facilitate other care (e.g., preventing people from pulling out a breathing tube). Antipsychotics are not supported for the treatment or prevention of delirium among those who are in hospital; however, they may be used in cases where a person has distressing experiences such as hallucinations or if the person poses a danger to themselves or others. When delirium is caused by alcohol or sedative-hypnotic withdrawal, benzodiazepines are typically used as a treatment. There is evidence that the risk of delirium in hospitalized people can be reduced by non-pharmacological care bundles (see ). According to the text of DSM-5-TR, although delirium affects only 1–2% of the overall population, 18–35% of adults presenting to the hospital will have delirium, and delirium will occur in 29–65% of people who are hospitalized. Delirium occurs in 11–51% of older adults after surgery, in 81% of those in the ICU, and in 20–22% of individuals in nursing homes or post-acute care settings. Among those requiring critical care, delirium is a risk factor for death within the next year.

Because of the confusion caused by similar signs and symptoms of delirium with other neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and psychosis, treating delirium can be difficult, and might even cause death of the patient due to being treated with the wrong medications.

==Definition==
In common usage, delirium can refer to drowsiness, agitation, disorientation, or hallucinations. In medical terminology, however, the core features of delirium include an acute disturbance in attention, awareness, and global cognition.

Although slight differences exist between the definitions of delirium in the DSM-5-TR and ICD-10, the core features are broadly the same. In 2022, the American Psychiatric Association released the fifth edition text revision of the DSM (DSM-5-TR) with the following criteria for diagnosis:
* A. Disturbance in attention and awareness. This is a required symptom and involves easy distraction, inability to maintain attentional focus, and varying levels of alertness.
* B. Onset is acute (from hours to days), representing a change from baseline mentation and often with fluctuations throughout the day
* C. At least one additional cognitive disturbance (in memory, orientation, language, visuospatial ability, or perception)
* D. The disturbances (criteria A and C) are not better explained by another neurocognitive disorder
* E. There is evidence that the disturbances above are a &quot;direct physiological consequence&quot; of another medical condition, substance intoxication or withdrawal, toxin, or various combinations of causes

==Signs and symptoms==
Delirium exists across a range of arousal levels, either as a state between normal wakefulness/alertness and coma (hypoactive) or as a state of heightened psychophysiological arousal (hyperactive). It can also alternate between the two (mixed level of activity). While requiring an acute disturbance in attention, awareness, and cognition, the syndrome of delirium encompasses a broad range of additional neuropsychiatric disturbances.

* Inattention: A disturbance in attention is required for delirium diagnosis. This may present as an impaired ability to direct, focus, sustain, or shift attention.
* Memory impairment: The memory impairment that occurs in delirium is often due to an inability to encode new information, largely as a result of having impaired attention. Older memories already in storage are retained without need of concentration, so previously formed long-term memories (i.e., those formed before the onset of delirium) are usually preserved in all but the most severe cases of delirium, though recall of such information may be impaired due to global impairment in cognition.
* Disorientation: A person may be disoriented to self, place, or time. Additionally, a person may be &#x27;disoriented to situation&#x27; and not recognize their environment or appreciate what is going on around them.
* Disorganized thinking: Disorganized thinking is usually noticed with speech that makes limited sense with apparent irrelevancies, and can involve poverty of speech, loose associations, perseveration, tangentiality, and other signs of a formal thought disorder.
* Language disturbances: Anomic aphasia, paraphasia, impaired comprehension, agraphia, and word-finding difficulties all involve impairment of linguistic information processing.
* Sleep/wake disturbances: Sleep disturbances in delirium reflect disruption in both sleep/wake and circadian rhythm regulation, typically characterized by fragmented sleep or even sleep-wake cycle reversal (i.e., active at night, sleeping during the day), including as an early sign preceding the onset of delirium.
* Psychotic and other erroneous beliefs: Symptoms of psychosis include suspiciousness, overvalued ideation and frank delusions. Delusions are typically poorly formed and less stereotyped than in schizophrenia or Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. They usually relate to persecutory themes of impending danger or threat in the immediate environment (e.g., being poisoned by nurses).
* Perceptual disturbances: These can include illusions, which involve the misperception of real stimuli in the environment, or hallucinations, which involve the perception of stimuli that do not exist.
* Mood lability: Distortions to perceived or communicated emotional states as well as fluctuating emotional states can manifest in delirium (e.g., rapid changes between terror, sadness, joking, fear, anger, and frustration).
* Motor activity changes: Delirium has been commonly classified into psychomotor subtypes of hypoactive, hyperactive, and mixed level of activity, though studies are inconsistent as to their prevalence. Hypoactive cases are prone to non-detection or misdiagnosis as depression. A range of studies suggests that motor subtypes differ regarding underlying pathophysiology, treatment needs, functional prognosis, and risk of mortality, though inconsistent subtype definitions and poorer detection of hypoactive subtypes may influence the interpretation of these findings. The notion of unifying hypoactive and hyperactive states under the construct of delirium is commonly attributed to Lipowski.
** Hyperactive symptoms include hyper-vigilance, restlessness, fast or loud speech, irritability, combativeness, impatience, swearing, singing, laughing, uncooperativeness, euphoria, anger, wandering, easy startling, fast motor responses, distractibility, tangentiality, nightmares, and persistent thoughts (hyperactive sub-typing is defined with at least three of the above).
** Hypoactive symptoms include decreased alertness, sparse or slow speech, lethargy, slowed movements, staring, and apathy.
** Mixed level of activity describes instances of delirium where activity level is either normal or fluctuating between hyperactive and hypoactive.

==Causes==
Delirium arises through the interaction of a number of predisposing and precipitating factors.

Individuals with multiple and/or significant predisposing factors are at high risk for an episode of delirium with a single and/or mild precipitating factor. Conversely, delirium may only result in low risk individuals if they experience a serious or multiple precipitating factors. These factors can change over time, thus an individual&#x27;s risk of delirium is modifiable (see ).

===Predisposing factors===
Important predisposing factors include the following:
* 65 or more years of age
* Cognitive impairment/dementia
* Physical morbidity (e.g., biventricular failure, cancer, cerebrovascular disease)
* Psychiatric morbidity (e.g., depression)
* Sensory impairment (i.e., vision and hearing)
* Functional dependence (e.g., requiring assistance for self-care or mobility)
* Dehydration/malnutrition
* Substance use disorder, including alcohol use disorder

===Precipitating factors===

Any serious, acute biological factor that affects neurotransmitter, neuroendocrine, or neuroinflammatory pathways can precipitate an episode of delirium in a vulnerable brain. Certain elements of the clinical environment have also been associated with the risk of developing delirium. Some of the most common precipitating factors are listed below:
* Prolonged sleep restriction or deprivation
* Environmental, psychophysiological stress (as found in acute care settings)
** Inadequately controlled pain
** Immobilization, use of physical restraints
** Urinary retention, use of bladder catheter
** Emotional stress
** Severe constipation/fecal impaction
* Medications
** Sedatives (benzodiazepines, opioids), anticholinergics, dopaminergics, corticosteroids, polypharmacy
** General anesthetic
** Substance intoxication or withdrawal
* Primary neurologic conditions
** Severe drop in blood pressure, relative to the person&#x27;s normal blood pressure (orthostatic hypotension) resulting in inadequate blood flow to the brain (cerebral hypoperfusion)
** Stroke/transient ischemic attack(TIA)
** Intracranial bleeding
** Meningitis, encephalitis
* Concurrent illness
** Infections – especially respiratory (e.g. pneumonia, COVID-19) and urinary tract infections
** Iatrogenic complications
** Hypoxia, hypercapnea, anemia
** Poor nutritional status, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, hypoglycemia
** Shock, heart attacks, heart failure
** Metabolic derangements (e.g. SIADH, Addison&#x27;s disease, hyperthyroidism)
** Chronic/terminal illness (e.g. cancer)
** Post-traumatic event (e.g. fall, fracture)
** Mercury poisoning (e.g. erethism)
* Major surgery (e.g. cardiac, orthopedic, vascular surgery)

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiology of delirium is still not well understood, despite extensive research.

===Animal models===
The lack of animal models that are relevant to delirium has left many key questions in delirium pathophysiology unanswered. Earliest rodent models of delirium used atropine (a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor blocker) to induce cognitive and electroencephalography (EEG) changes similar to delirium, and other anticholinergic drugs, such as biperiden and hyoscine, have produced similar effects. Along with clinical studies using various drugs with anticholinergic activity, these models have contributed to a &quot;cholinergic deficiency hypothesis&quot; of delirium.

Profound systemic inflammation occurring during sepsis is also known to cause delirium (often termed sepsis-associated encephalopathy). Animal models used to study the interactions between prior degenerative disease and overlying systemic inflammation have shown that even mild systemic inflammation causes acute and transient deficits in working memory among diseased animals. Prior dementia or age-associated cognitive impairment is the primary predisposing factor for clinical delirium and &quot;prior pathology&quot; as defined by these new animal models may consist of synaptic loss, abnormal network connectivity, and &quot;primed microglia&quot; brain macrophages stimulated by prior neurodegenerative disease and aging to amplify subsequent inflammatory responses in the central nervous system (CNS).

===Cerebrospinal fluid===
Studies of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in delirium are difficult to perform. Apart from the general difficulty of recruiting participants who are often unable to give consent, the inherently invasive nature of CSF sampling makes such research particularly challenging. However, a few studies have managed to sample CSF from persons undergoing spinal anesthesia for elective or emergency surgery.

A 2018 systematic review showed that, broadly, delirium may be associated with neurotransmitter imbalance (namely serotonin and dopamine signaling), reversible fall in somatostatin, and increased cortisol. The leading &quot;neuroinflammatory hypothesis&quot; (where neurodegenerative disease and aging leads the brain to respond to peripheral inflammation with an exaggerated CNS inflammatory response) has been described, but current evidence is still conflicting and fails to concretely support this hypothesis.

===Neuroimaging===
Neuroimaging provides an important avenue to explore the mechanisms that are responsible for delirium. Despite progress in the development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the large variety in imaging-based findings has limited our understanding of the changes in the brain that may be linked to delirium. Some challenges associated with imaging people diagnosed with delirium include participant recruitment and inadequate consideration of important confounding factors such as history of dementia and/or depression, which are known to be associated with overlapping changes in the brain also observed on MRI.

Evidence for changes in structural and functional markers include: changes in white-matter integrity (white matter lesions), decreases in brain volume (likely as a result of tissue atrophy), abnormal functional connectivity of brain regions responsible for normal processing of executive function, sensory processing, attention, emotional regulation, memory, and orientation, differences in autoregulation of the vascular vessels in the brain, reduction in cerebral blood flow and possible changes in brain metabolism (including cerebral tissue oxygenation and glucose hypometabolism). Altogether, these changes in MRI-based measurements invite further investigation of the mechanisms that may underlie delirium, as a potential avenue to improve clinical management of people with this condition.

===Neurophysiology===
Electroencephalography (EEG) allows for continuous capture of global brain function and brain connectivity, and is useful in understanding real-time physiologic changes during delirium. Since the 1950s, delirium has been known to be associated with slowing of resting-state EEG rhythms, with abnormally decreased background alpha power and increased theta and delta frequency activity.

From such evidence, a 2018 systematic review proposed a conceptual model that delirium results when insults/stressors trigger a breakdown of brain network dynamics in individuals with low brain resilience (i.e. people who already have underlying problems of low neural connectivity and/or low neuroplasticity like those with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease).

===Neuropathology===
Only a handful of studies exist where there has been an attempt to correlate delirium with pathological findings at autopsy. One research study has been reported on 7 people who died during ICU admission. Each case was admitted with a range of primary pathologies, but all had acute respiratory distress syndrome and/or septic shock contributing to the delirium, 6 showed evidence of low brain perfusion and diffuse vascular injury, and 5 showed hippocampal involvement. A case-control study showed that 9 delirium cases showed higher expression of HLA-DR and CD68 (markers of microglial activation), IL-6 (cytokines pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory activities) and GFAP (marker of astrocyte activity) than age-matched controls; this supports a neuroinflammatory cause to delirium, but the conclusions are limited by methodological issues.

A 2017 retrospective study correlating autopsy data with mini–mental state examination (MMSE) scores from 987 brain donors found that delirium combined with a pathological process of dementia accelerated MMSE score decline more than either individual process.

==Diagnosis==
The DSM-5-TR criteria are often the standard for diagnosing delirium clinically. However, early recognition of delirium&#x27;s features using screening instruments, along with taking a careful history, can help in making a diagnosis of delirium. A diagnosis of delirium generally requires knowledge of a person&#x27;s &quot;baseline&quot; level of cognitive function. This is especially important for treating people who have neurocognitive or neurodevelopmental disorders, whose baseline mental status may be mistaken as delirium.

=== General settings ===
Guidelines recommend that delirium should be diagnosed consistently when present. Much evidence reveals that in most centers delirium is greatly under-diagnosed. A systematic review of large scale routine data studies reporting data on delirium detection tools showed important variations in tool completion rates and tool positive score rates. Some tools, even if completed at high rates, showed delirium positive score rates that there much lower than the expected delirium occurrence level, suggesting low sensitivity in practice.

There is evidence that delirium detection and coding rates can show improvements in response to guidelines and education; for example, whole country data in England and Scotland (sample size 7.7M people per year) show that there were large increases (3-4 fold) in delirium coding between 2012 and 2020. Delirium detection in general acute care settings can be assisted by the use of validated delirium screening tools. Many such tools have been published, and they differ in a variety of characteristics (e.g., duration, complexity, and need for training). It is also important to ensure that a given tool has been validated for the setting where it is being used.

Examples of tools in use in clinical practice include:
* Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), including variants such as the 3-Minute Diagnostic Interview for the CAM (3D-CAM) and brief CAM (bCAM)
* Delirium Observation Screening Scale (DOS)
* Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC)
* Recognizing Acute Delirium As part of your Routine (RADAR)
* 4AT (4 A&#x27;s Test)
* Delirium Diagnostic Tool-Provisional (DDT-Pro), also for subsyndromal delirium

===Intensive care unit===
People who are in the ICU are at greater risk of delirium, and ICU delirium may lead to prolonged ventilation, longer stays in the hospital, increased stress on family and caregivers, and an increased chance of death. In the ICU, international guidelines recommend that every person admitted gets checked for delirium every day (usually twice or more a day) using a validated clinical tool. Key elements of detecting delirium in the ICU are whether a person can pay attention during a listening task and follow simple commands. The two most widely used are the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) and the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). Translations of these tools exist in over 20 languages and are used ICUs globally with instructional videos and implementation tips available. For children in need of intensive care there are validated clinical tools adjusted according to age. The recommended tools are preschool and pediatric Confusion Assessment Methods for the ICU (ps/pCAM-ICU) or the Cornell Assessment for Pediatric Delirium (CAPD) as the most valid and reliable delirium monitoring tools in critically ill children or adolescents.

More emphasis is placed on regular screening over the choice of tool used. This, coupled with proper documentation and informed awareness by the healthcare team, can affect clinical outcomes. Without using one of these tools, 75% of ICU delirium can be missed by the healthcare team, leaving the person without any likely interventions to help reduce the duration of delirium.

===Differential diagnosis===
There are conditions that might have similar clinical presentations to those seen in delirium. These include dementia, depression, psychosis, catatonia, and other conditions that affect cognitive function.
* Dementia: This group of disorders is acquired (non-congenital) with usually irreversible cognitive and psychosocial functional decline. Dementia usually results from an identifiable degenerative brain disease (e.g., Alzheimer disease or Huntington&#x27;s disease), requires chronic impairment (versus acute onset in delirium), and is typically not associated with changes in level of consciousness. Dementia is different from delirium in that dementia lasts long-term while delirium lasts short-term.
* Depression: Similar symptoms exist between depression and delirium (especially the hypoactive subtype). Gathering a history from other caregivers can clarify baseline mentation.
* Psychosis: In general, people with &quot;primary&quot; psychosis have intact cognitive function; however, primary psychosis can mimic delirium when it presents with disorganized thoughts and mood dysregulation. This is particularly true in the condition known as delirious mania.
* Other mental illnesses: Some mental illnesses, such as a manic episode of bipolar disorder, depersonalization disorder, or other dissociative conditions, can present with features similar to that of delirium. Such condition, however, would not qualify for a diagnosis of delirium per DSM-5-TR criterion D (i.e., fluctuating cognitive symptoms occurring as part of a &quot;primary&quot; &quot;mental&quot; disorder are results of the said mental disorder itself), while &quot;physical&quot; disorders (e.g., infections, hypoxia, etc.) can precipitate delirium as a mental side-effect/symptom.

==Prevention==
Treating delirium that is already established is challenging and for this reason, preventing delirium before it begins is ideal. Prevention approaches include screening to identify people who are at risk, and medication-based and non-medication based (non-pharmacological) treatments.

An estimated 30–40% of all cases of delirium could be prevented in cognitively at-risk populations, and high rates of delirium reflect negatively on the quality of care. Episodes of delirium can be prevented by identifying hospitalized people at risk of the condition. This includes individuals over age 65, with a cognitive impairment, undergoing major surgery, or with severe illness. Routine delirium screening is recommended in such populations. It is thought that a personalized approach to prevention that includes different approaches together can decrease rates of delirium by 27% among the elderly.

In 1999, Sharon K. Inouye at Yale University, founded the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) which has since become recognized as a proven model for preventing delirium. HELP prevents delirium among the elderly through active participation and engagement with these individuals. There are two working parts to this program, medical professionals such as a trained nurse, and volunteers, who are overseen by the nurse. The volunteer program equips each trainee with the adequate basic geriatric knowledge and interpersonal skills to interact with patients. Volunteers perform the range of motion exercises, cognitive stimulation, and general conversation with elderly patients who are staying in the hospital. Alternative effective delirium prevention programs have been developed, some of which do not require volunteers.

Prevention efforts often fall on caregivers. Caregivers often have a lot expected of them and this is where socioeconomic status plays a role in prevention. If prevention requires constant mental stimulation and daily exercise, this takes time out of the caregiver&#x27;s day. Based on socioeconomic classes, this may be valuable time that would be used working to support the family. This leads to a disproportionate number of individuals who experience delirium being from marginalized identities. Programs such as the Hospital Elder Life Program can attempt to combat these societal issues by providing additional support and education about delirium that may not otherwise be accessible.

=== Non-pharmacological ===
Delirium may be prevented and treated by using non-pharmacologic approaches focused on risk factors, such as constipation, dehydration, low oxygen levels, immobility, visual or hearing impairment, sleep disturbance, functional decline, and by removing or minimizing problematic medications. Ensuring a therapeutic environment (e.g., individualized care, clear communication, adequate reorientation and lighting during daytime, promoting uninterrupted sleep hygiene with minimal noise and light at night, minimizing room relocation, having familiar objects like family pictures, providing earplugs, and providing adequate nutrition, pain control, and assistance toward early mobilization) may also aid in preventing delirium. Research into pharmacologic prevention and treatment is weak and insufficient to make proper recommendations.

=== Pharmacological ===
Melatonin and other pharmacological agents have been studied for delirium prevention, but evidence is conflicting. Avoidance or cautious use of benzodiazepines has been recommended for reducing the risk of delirium in critically ill individuals. It is unclear if the medication donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, reduces delirium following surgery. There is also no clear evidence to suggest that citicoline, methylprednisolone, or antipsychotic medications prevent delirium. A review of intravenous versus inhalational maintenance of anaesthesia for postoperative cognitive outcomes in elderly people undergoing non-cardiac surgery showed little or no difference in postoperative delirium according to the type of anaesthetic maintenance agents in five studies (321 participants). The authors of this review were uncertain whether maintenance of anaesthesia with propofol-based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) or with inhalational agents can affect the incidence rate of postoperative delirium.

Interventions for preventing delirium in long-term care or hospital

The current evidence suggests that software-based interventions to identify medications that could contribute to delirium risk and recommend a pharmacist&#x27;s medication review probably reduces incidence of delirium in older adults in long-term care. The benefits of hydration reminders and education on risk factors and care homes&#x27; solutions for reducing delirium is still uncertain.

For inpatients in a hospital setting, numerous approaches have been suggested to prevent episodes of delirium including targeting risk factors such as sleep deprivation, mobility problems, dehydration, and impairments to a person&#x27;s sensory system. Often a &#x27;multicomponent&#x27; approach by an interdisciplinary team of health care professionals is suggested for people in the hospital at risk of delirium, and there is some evidence that this may decrease to incidence of delirium by up to 43% and may reduce the length of time that the person is hospitalized.

==Treatment==
Most often, delirium is reversible; however, people with delirium require treatment for the underlying cause(s) and often to prevent injury and other poor outcomes directly related to delirium.

Treatment of delirium requires attention to multiple domains including the following:
* Identify and treat the underlying medical disorder or cause(s)
* Addressing any other possible predisposing and precipitating factors that might be disrupting brain function
* Optimize physiology and conditions for brain recovery (e.g., oxygenation, hydration, nutrition, electrolytes, metabolites, medication review)
* Detect and manage distress and behavioral disturbances (e.g., pain control)
* Maintaining mobility
* Provide rehabilitation through cognitive engagement and mobilization
* Communicate effectively with the person experiencing delirium and their carers or caregivers
* Provide adequate follow-up including consideration of possible dementia and post-traumatic stress.

===Multidomain interventions===

These interventions are the first steps in managing acute delirium, and there are many overlaps with delirium preventative strategies. In addition to treating immediate life-threatening causes of delirium (e.g., low O, low blood pressure, low glucose, dehydration), interventions include optimizing the hospital environment by reducing ambient noise, providing proper lighting, offering pain relief, promoting healthy sleep-wake cycles, and minimizing room changes. Although multicomponent care and comprehensive geriatric care are more specialized for a person experiencing delirium, several studies have been unable to find evidence showing they reduce the duration of delirium.

Family, friends, and other caregivers can offer frequent reassurance, tactile and verbal orientation, cognitive stimulation (e.g. regular visits, familiar objects, clocks, calendars, etc.), and means to stay engaged (e.g. making hearing aids and eyeglasses readily available). Sometimes verbal and non-verbal deescalation techniques may be required to offer reassurances and calm the person experiencing delirium. Restraints should rarely be used as an intervention for delirium. The use of restraints has been recognized as a risk factor for injury and aggravating symptoms, especially in older hospitalized people with delirium. The only cases where restraints should sparingly be used during delirium is in the protection of life-sustaining interventions, such as endotracheal tubes.

Another approached called the &quot;T-A-DA (&quot;tolerate, anticipate, don&#x27;t agitate&quot;) method&quot; can be an effective management technique for older people with delirium, where abnormal behaviors (including hallucinations and delusions) are tolerated and unchallenged, as long as caregiver safety and the safety of the person experiencing delirium is not threatened. Implementation of this model may require a designated area in the hospital. All unnecessary attachments are removed to anticipate for greater mobility, and agitation is prevented by avoiding excessive reorientation/questioning.

===Medications===

The use of medications for delirium is generally restricted to managing its distressing or dangerous neuropsychiatric disturbances. Short-term use (one week or less) of low-dose haloperidol is among the more common pharmacological approaches to delirium. Evidence for effectiveness of atypical antipsychotics (e.g. risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, and quetiapine) is emerging, with the benefit for fewer side effects Use antipsychotic drugs with caution or not at all for people with conditions such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease or dementia with Lewy bodies. Evidence for the effectiveness of medications (including antipsychotics and benzodiazepines) in treating delirium is weak.

Benzodiazepines can cause or worsen delirium, and there is no reliable evidence of efficacy for treating non-anxiety-related delirium. Similarly, people with dementia with Lewy bodies may have significant side effects with antipsychotics, and should either be treated with a none or small doses of benzodiazepines.

The antidepressant trazodone is occasionally used in the treatment of delirium, but it carries a risk of over-sedation, and its use has not been well studied.

For adults with delirium that are in the ICU, medications are used commonly to improve the symptoms. Dexmedetomidine may shorten the length of the delirium in adults who are critically ill, and rivastigmine is not suggested. For adults with delirium who are near the end of their life (on palliative care) high quality evidence to support or refute the use of most medications to treat delirium is not available. Low quality evidence indicates that the antipsychotic medications risperidone or haloperidol may make the delirium slightly worse in people who are terminally ill, when compared to a placebo treatment. There is also moderate to low quality evidence to suggest that haloperidol and risperidone may be associated with a slight increase in side effects, specifically extrapyramidal symptoms, if the person near the end of their life has delirium that is mild to moderate in severity.

==Prognosis==
There is substantial evidence that delirium results in long-term poor outcomes in older persons admitted to hospital. This systematic review only included studies that looked for an independent effect of delirium (i.e., after accounting for other associations with poor outcomes, for example co-morbidity or illness severity).

In older persons admitted to hospital, individuals experiencing delirium are twice as likely to die than those who do not (meta-analysis of 12 studies). In the only prospective study conducted in the general population, older persons reporting delirium also showed higher mortality (60% increase). A large (N=82,770) two-centre study in unselected older emergency population found that delirium detected as part of normal care using the 4AT tool was strongly linked to 30-day mortality, hospital length of stay, and days at home in the year following the 4AT test date.

Institutionalization was also twice as likely after an admission with delirium (meta-analysis of seven studies). In a community-based population examining individuals after an episode of severe infection (though not specifically delirium), these persons acquired more functional limitations (i.e., required more assistance with their care needs) than those not experiencing infection. After an episode of delirium in the general population, functional dependence increased threefold.

The association between delirium and dementia is complex. The systematic review estimated a 13-fold increase in dementia after delirium (meta-analysis of two studies). However, it is difficult to be certain that this is accurate because the population admitted to hospital includes persons with undiagnosed dementia (i.e., the dementia was present before the delirium, rather than caused by it). In prospective studies, people hospitalised from any cause appear to be at greater risk of dementia and faster trajectories of cognitive decline, but these studies did not specifically look at delirium. In the only population-based prospective study of delirium, older persons had an eight-fold increase in dementia and faster cognitive decline. The same association is also evident in persons already diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s dementia.

Recent long-term studies showed that many people still meet criteria for delirium for a prolonged period after hospital discharge, with up to 21% of people showing persistent delirium at 6 months post-discharge.

===Dementia in ICU survivors===

Between 50% and 70% of people admitted to the ICU have permanent problems with brain dysfunction similar to those experienced by people with Alzheimer&#x27;s or those with a traumatic brain injury, leaving many ICU survivors permanently disabled. This is a distressing personal and public health problem and continues to receive increasing attention in ongoing investigations.

The implications of such an &quot;acquired dementia-like illness&quot; can profoundly debilitate a person&#x27;s livelihood level, often dismantling his/her life in practical ways like impairing one&#x27;s ability to find a car in a parking lot, complete shopping lists, or perform job-related tasks done previously for years. The societal implications can be enormous when considering work-force issues related to the inability of wage-earners to work due to their own ICU stay or that of someone else they must care for.

== Epidemiology ==
The highest rates of delirium (often 50–75% of people) occur among those who are critically ill in the intensive care unit (ICU). This was historically referred to as &quot;ICU psychosis&quot; or &quot;ICU syndrome&quot;; however, these terms are now widely disfavored in relation to the operationalized term ICU delirium. Since the advent of validated and easy-to-implement delirium instruments for people admitted to the ICU such as the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) and the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC), it has been recognized that most ICU delirium is hypoactive, and can easily be missed unless evaluated regularly. The causes of delirium depend on the underlying illnesses, new problems like sepsis and low oxygen levels, and the sedative and pain medicines that are nearly universally given to all people in the ICU p. Outside the ICU, on hospital wards and in nursing homes, the problem of delirium is also a very important medical problem, especially for older patients.

The most recent area of the hospital in which delirium is just beginning to be monitored routinely in many centers is the Emergency Department, where the prevalence of delirium among older adults is about 10%. A systematic review of delirium in general medical inpatients showed that estimates of delirium prevalence on admission ranged 10–31%. About 5–10% of older adults who are admitted to hospital develop a new episode of delirium while in hospital. Rates of delirium vary widely across general hospital wards. Estimates of the prevalence of delirium in nursing homes are between 10% and 45%.

==Society and culture==
Delirium is one of the oldest forms of mental disorder known in medical history. The Roman author Aulus Cornelius Celsus used the term to describe mental disturbance from head trauma or fever in his work &quot;De Medicina&quot;. Sims (1995, p. 31) points out a &quot;superb detailed and lengthy description&quot; of delirium in &quot;The Stroller&#x27;s Tale&quot; from Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;. Historically, delirium has also been noted for its cognitive sequelae. For instance, the English medical writer Philip Barrow noted in 1583 that if delirium (or &quot;frensy&quot;) resolves, it may be followed by a loss of memory and reasoning power.

===Costs===
In the US, the cost of a hospital admission for people with delirium is estimated at between $16k and $64k, suggesting the national burden of delirium may range from $38 bn to $150 bn per year (2008 estimate). In the UK, the cost is estimated as £13k per admission.

<text>Maiden Castle is an Iron Age hillfort southwest of Dorchester, in the English county of Dorset. Hill forts were fortified hill-top settlements constructed across Britain during the Iron Age.

The earliest archaeological evidence of human activity on the site consists of a Neolithic causewayed enclosure and bank barrow. In about 1800 BC, during the Bronze Age, the site was used for growing crops before being abandoned. Maiden Castle itself was built in about 600 BC; the early phase was a simple and unremarkable site, similar to many other hill forts in Britain and covering . 

Around 450 BC it was greatly expanded and the enclosed area nearly tripled in size to , making it the largest hill fort in Britain and, by some definitions, the largest in Europe. At the same time, Maiden Castle&#x27;s defences were made more complex with the addition of further ramparts and ditches. Around 100 BC, habitation at the hill fort went into decline and became concentrated at the eastern end of the site. It was occupied until at least the Roman period, by which time it was in the territory of the Durotriges, a Celtic tribe.

After the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD, Maiden Castle appears to have been abandoned, although the Romans may have had a military presence on the site. In the late 4th century AD, a temple and ancillary buildings were constructed. In the 6th century AD the hill top was entirely abandoned and was used only for agriculture during the medieval period.
Maiden Castle has provided inspiration for composer John Ireland and authors Thomas Hardy and John Cowper Powys. The study of hill forts was popularised in the 19th century by archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers. In the 1930s, archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler and Tessa Verney Wheeler undertook the first archaeological excavations at Maiden Castle, raising its profile among the public. Further excavations were carried out under Niall Sharples, which added to an understanding of the site and repaired damage caused in part by the large number of visitors. Today the site is protected as a Scheduled Monument and is maintained by English Heritage.

==Before the fort==

Before the hill fort was built, a Neolithic causewayed enclosure was constructed on the site. Dating from around 4000 BC, it was an oval area enclosed by two ditches, It is called a causewayed enclosure because the way the ditches were dug meant that there would originally have been gaps. These gaps, and the bank being only high, indicate the site would not have been defensive. Instead the ditches may have been symbolic, separating the interior of the enclosure and its activities from the outside. Archaeologist Niall Sharples, who was involved in excavating the hill fort in the 1980s, has identified the hilltop views of the surrounding landscape as a likely factor for the enclosure&#x27;s position. Situated on the side of the hill, it would have been visible from several miles away, and when first cut the ditches would have exposed the underlying white chalk and stood out against the green hillside. The interior of the enclosure has been disturbed by later habitation and farming. The site does not appear to have been inhabited, although a grave containing the remains of two children, aged 6–7, has been discovered. The enclosure is the earliest evidence of human activity on the site.

The purpose of Neolithic causewayed enclosures is unclear, and they probably had a variety of functions. In addition to the burials, which indicate the site at Maiden Castle was important for rituals related to death, pottery from the coast and areas to the east and west was found here, indicating that the site was a meeting place that attracted people over long distances. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the enclosure was abandoned around 3,400 BC. Arrowheads discovered in the ditches may indicate that activity at the enclosure met a violent end.

Within a period of about 50 years, a bank barrow was built over the enclosure. It was a long mound of earth with a ditch on either side; the parallel ditches were apart. Many barrows lie over graves and are monuments to the deceased, but as the barrow at Maiden Castle did not cover any burials, scholars have suggested that it was a boundary marker. This would explain the limited human activity on the hilltop for the 500 years after the bank barrow&#x27;s construction. 

Around 1,800 BC, during the early Bronze Age, the hill was cleared and used to grow crops, but the soil was quickly exhausted and the site abandoned. This period of abandonment lasted until the Iron Age, when the hill fort was built. The bank barrow survived into the Iron Age as a low mound, and throughout this period construction over it was avoided.

==First hill fort==

Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the first millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been defensive sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and resulting pressure on agriculture.

Since the 1960s, the dominant view has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze. As a result, trading patterns shifted, and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people.

Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated that 
[the forts] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [of an increasing population] burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn&#x27;t see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction.

There are around 31 hill forts in Dorset; archaeologist Sharples, who undertook excavations at Maiden Castle, proposed that hill forts were used to control agricultural land to support a large community. Those in Dorset were situated near expanses of fertile land. Monumental defences such as the ditch at Maiden Castle indicate that the land was disputed and communities fought each other for control. This is supported by Cunliffe, who argues that the elaborate earthworks such as those around the entrances to Maiden Castle and Danebury were used to defend the weakest part of the hill fort. They increased the time the attackers took to reach the gateway, which would have left them vulnerable to defenders armed with slings. Hoards of carefully selected sling stones have been found at both sites.

Constructed on a territorial boundary in about 600 BC, the first hill fort at Maiden Castle was a area surrounded by a single ditch. The hill it sits on is part of a ridge on the north side of the South Winterborne valley, which feeds the River Frome. At the eastern end of the ridge and rising above sea level, the site of the first hill fort was not the highest point along the ridge. The highest point is the neighbouring Hog Hill, which is only higher. The hill projects about above the surrounding countryside, which is about above sea level. The defences were high and consisted of the V-shaped ditch and a rampart. The rampart would probably have been timber-faced around just the entrances. Elaborate timber facing would have been used to impress visitors. The site could be accessed by an entrance in the northwest and a double entrance in the east. The double entrance is unique in hill forts in the British Isles. The reason for a double entrance is unclear; however, archaeologist Niall Sharples has suggested that it was a form of segregation. It is likely that several farming communities lived in the hill fort and wanted different entrances.

The defences of the first hill fort were rebuilt on at least one occasion; the ditch was deepened by . The spoil from re-digging the ditch was deposited on the back of the rampart. At the same time, the defences around the eastern entrances were made more complex. A bank and ditch were built outside the two entrances, and a bank was erected between them. The bank had a wall faced with limestone, which was brought from more than away. Sharples believes this would have created an impressive entrance and was a demonstration of the settlement&#x27;s high status. The Early Iron Age archaeology has been largely destroyed due to later activity on the site. However, nearby Poundbury and Chalbury date to the same period, so through comparison it is possible to infer the Early Iron Age activity at Maiden Castle. From parallels at these sites, Sharples deduces that it was probably densely occupied, with separate areas for habitation and storage. Not much is known about the material culture and economy of the Early Iron Age, and the paucity of finds from this period at Maiden Castle makes it difficult to draw conclusions about activity on the site.

==Developed hill fort==

In the Early Iron Age, Maiden Castle was generally unexceptional; it was one of over 100 hill forts of similar size built around the same time in the area that is now Berkshire, Dorset, Hampshire, and Wiltshire. In the Middle Iron Age, Maiden Castle was expanded and in the process it became the largest hill fort in Britain and one of the largest in Europe. According to archaeologist Niall Sharples it is, by some definitions, the largest in western Europe. In about 450 BC, Maiden Castle was expanded from . The area was initially enclosed by a single bank and ditch, with the bank standing high although the ditch was shallow. The hill fort&#x27;s expansion was not unique; it was one of a series of &quot;developed hill forts&quot; in southern England. 

As some hill forts were expanded, many of the smaller hill forts that had proliferated in the Early Iron Age fell out of use, as was the case in Dorset. The developed hill forts in Dorset were spaced widely apart. This, and the abandonment of the smaller hill forts in the area when the developed hill forts were built, indicates that these developed hill forts were important. The developed hill forts of Berkshire, Dorset, Hampshire, and Wiltshire were equally spaced apart, with roughly equal access to resources such as water.

The emergence of developed hill forts has been attributed to Iron Age society becoming more complex. The emergence of one dominant hill fort in an area indicates that the inhabitants of a particular hill fort became more important than their contemporaries, possibly through warfare. However, a general dearth of evidence for destruction and an increase of artefacts associated with crafts and industry suggest that the reason for change was economic. Hill forts may have become important as centres of trade. This is supported by the possibility that the multiple rings of ditches often employed at developed hill forts (the technical term for which is &quot;multivallate&quot;) were likely to be not just defensive; so many ditches and ramparts, such as those at Maiden Castle, were excessive for defence alone so were likely used as statements of power and authority. Developed hill forts were generally densely occupied; this is best demonstrated at Danebury, where 57% of the site has been excavated. While developed hill forts were of a higher status than their smaller predecessors, they were not all equal. Cunliffe states that the Maiden Castle&#x27;s monumental defences probably indicate that it was of higher status than other developed hill forts.
Maiden Castle expanded westwards, and the ditch was extended to enclose the neighbouring Hog Hill. The peaks of the two hills encompassed by the new, larger hill fort were separated by a dry valley. A shaft dug into the valley was possibly used as a water source. Almost immediately after the single ditch enclosure was expanded to , work began on making the defences more elaborate. The existing rampart was heightened to , and more ramparts and ditches were added. On the south of the fort, four ramparts and three ditches were added, but because of the steepness of the northern slope of the hill, the fourth rampart did not extend all the way round, and only three ramparts were built on the northern side. At the same time, the eastern entrance was again made more complex through the addition of further earthworks, lengthening the approach to the site.

The four-post structures common in hill forts throughout England are also found in Maiden Castle. Their purpose on this site is uncertain however, since at square they have been considered by archaeologists to be too small for dwellings; as a result, it has been concluded that these structures were probably granaries. The presence of granaries suggests that the fort was used to control the area&#x27;s food supply. Little evidence has been discovered for houses in Maiden Castle during the site&#x27;s reconstruction in the 5th century BC; this is probably because the site has not been fully excavated and a quarry used to provide material for the rampart may have obliterated the evidence. It appears that houses were not built near the ramparts until after the defences were complete. Maiden Castle was occupied throughout the Iron Age and its inhabitants lived in roundhouses. The later houses appear to be organised in rows, and to be roughly similar in size, a reorganisation which indicates the increasing power of the elites over Iron Age society.

Bronze objects such as pins, jewellery, and rivets have been found on the site, dating from the Middle Iron Age. As there was no local source of tin and copper ore, this demonstrates long distance trade, probably with the southwest. Although bronze was not produced at Maiden Castle, there is evidence of it being reworked. Good quality iron ore could be found in the surrounding area, but the hill fort does not appear to have been a centre for iron production in this period; this is not unusual as very few hill forts in Berkshire, Dorset, Hampshire, and Wiltshire exhibit traces of iron production. Early in the Iron Age, most of the pottery found at Maiden Castle was produced locally – within about  – however later on sources further afield became more important, and by the Late Iron Age 95% of the pottery came from the area around Poole Harbour, more than away. This long-range trade has been taken as evidence for increasing relationships with groups of people over large areas and the emergence of tribal identities. Although Sharples states that developed hill forts such as Maiden Castle are not towns and cannot be considered truly urban because they are so closely related to agriculture and storage, Cunliffe and fellow-archaeologists Mark Corney and Andrew Payne describe developed hill forts as &quot;town-like settlements&quot;, a form of proto-urbanism.

==Decline==
Across Britain, many hill forts fell out of use in the 100 years around the turn of the millennium. It has been suggested that this, and the contemporary change in material culture of the Britons (such as the introduction of coinage and cemeteries and an increase in craft industries), was caused by increased interaction with the Roman Empire. The developing industries may have resulted in a shift away from the hill fort elites, whose power was based on agriculture. Such change is not as obvious in Dorset as it is in the rest of Britain, but there is a trend for abandonment of hill forts in the area and a proliferation of small undefended farmsteads, indicating a migration of the population.

Around 100 BC, Maiden Castle&#x27;s organised street pattern was replaced by more random habitation. At the same time, the western half of the site was abandoned and occupation was concentrated in the east of the fort. Also during the Late Iron Age, some of the earthworks around the eastern gateway were filled in and settlement expanded beyond the entrance, and into the areas between the banks. Excavations by archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler in this area revealed several houses, storage pits, an area used for iron working, and a cemetery. On the industrial site, more than of iron slag was discovered in an area of , and it is believed the site produced around of iron. The amount of ore required could not have been supplied by local sources, so most likely originated from areas of specialist iron production such as the Weald, south west England, and Wales. Maiden Castle is one of the most important iron production sites from the Late Iron Age in southern Britain.

There is little evidence for burial in the Iron Age until late on in the period, and it is believed that the prevalent method of disposing of a body was by excarnation. Wheeler&#x27;s excavations on the cemetery in the eastern gateway revealed 52 burials, but only part of the cemetery was investigated, so the total number of burials is likely to be at least double this figure. One area of the cemetery featured burials of 14 people who had died in violent circumstances, including one body with a Roman catapult bolt in its back. Wheeler used the &quot;war cemetery&quot;, as he described it, as evidence of a Roman attack on Maiden Castle.

==Roman activity and abandonment==

In AD 43, the Roman conquest of Britain began. Vespasian&#x27;s subsequent campaign to conquer the tribes of the Atrebates, Dumnonii, and Durotriges in the southwest of Britain took place in AD 43–47. Based on the discovery of a group of bodies in the Late Iron Age formal cemetery that had met a violent death, archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler created a vivid story of the fall of Maiden Castle to Roman forces. He believed a legion wreaked destruction on the site, butchering men, women, and children, before setting fire to the site and slighting its defences. However, there is little archaeological evidence to support this version of events, or even that the hill fort was attacked by the Romans, Wheeler&#x27;s interpretation of a siege and subsequent massacre being unlikely. Although there is a layer of charcoal, it is associated with the iron works, and the main evidence for slighting of defences comes from the collapse of an entranceway to the fort. Although 14 bodies in the cemetery exhibited signs of a violent death, there is no evidence that they died at Maiden Castle.

The eastern part of the hill fort remained in use for at least the first few decades of the Roman occupation, although the duration and nature of habitation is uncertain. Many 1st-century Roman artefacts have been discovered near the east entrance and in the centre of the hill fort. It has been suggested that Maiden Castle was occupied as a Roman military outpost or fort and the settlement discontinued, as there is no known fort in the area and it was not uncommon for hill forts in the southwest to have been occupied by Roman forces. This was a characteristic of Vespasian&#x27;s campaign in the region; there was military occupation at Cadbury Castle in Somerset, Hembury in Devon, and Hod Hill in Dorset. A full geophysical survey of the hillfort conducted in 2015 by Dave Stewart has, however, produced no evidence for a Roman fort here.

Maiden Castle had been abandoned by the end of the 1st century, a time when &quot;Durnovaria&quot; (Dorchester) rose to prominence as the &quot;civitas&quot;, or regional capital, of the Durotriges, a Celtic tribe whose territory was in southwest England. However, in July 2015 archaeologists from Bournemouth University discovered the remains of the Iron Age settlement of Duropolis and believe that the abandonment of the fort may be connected with the new site. According to the ancient geographer Ptolemy, writing in the 2nd century AD, &quot;Dunium&quot; was the main settlement of the Durotriges. Although &quot;Dunium&quot; has long been thought to refer to Maiden Castle, Hod Hill and Hengistbury have been identified as two other possible sites for &quot;Dunium&quot;. &quot;Dunium&quot; may have derived from British &quot;duno-&quot; which meant &quot;a fort&quot;. 

Sometime after 367, a Romano-Celtic temple was built at Maiden Castle in the eastern half of the hill fort. The date was deduced from a hoard of coins discovered beneath a mosaic floor in the temple. A central room, measuring square, was surrounded by a passageway, similar to many Romano-Celtic temples found in the south of England. Nearby were two other buildings: a rectangular building with two rooms that may have been a house for a priest, and a circular building that may have been a shrine. At the same time as the temple was built, the fort&#x27;s eastern gateway was refurbished; there was possibly another shrine inside the gateway.

==Later history==

The 4th-century temple gradually fell into disuse and Maiden Castle was used predominantly as pasture. There is evidence for activity on the site in the form of a few post-Roman or Anglo Saxon burials, some possibly Christian, but the hill fort was not reused as a settlement. In the 16th and 17th centuries, a barn was built over the &quot;war cemetery&quot;. The only other significant activity on the hill top after the Romans was a short period of cultivation in the 17th century, as demonstrated by traces of ridge and furrow caused by ploughing.

The modern name for the hill fort is first recorded in 1607 as &quot;Mayden Castell&quot;; it is not unique to the site and occurs in several other places in Britain and is widely taken to mean a &quot;fortification that looks impregnable&quot; or one that has never been taken in battle. Alternatively, the name may derive from the Brittonic &quot;mai-dun&quot;, meaning a &quot;great hill&quot;. A more recent explanation has been advanced by Richard Coates suggesting that the name is only of medieval origin, and was applied simultaneously to the considerable number of identically named locations around the country.

Over the following centuries, the site was abandoned completely and became open pasture, although it was of interest to antiquarians. Thomas Hardy, who built his house within sight of it, described the castle in a short story, &quot;Ancient Earthworks and What Two Enthusiastic Scientists Found Therein&quot; (1885) about a local antiquarian who spent much time investigating the site. In 1921, composer John Ireland wrote &quot;Mai-Dun&quot;, a symphonic rhapsody, about the hill fort in Dorset. John Cowper Powys wrote a novel titled &quot;Maiden Castle&quot; in 1936, which was set in Dorset.

The first widespread investigation of hill forts was carried out in the second half of the 19th century under the direction of Augustus Pitt-Rivers, but it was not until the 1930s that Maiden Castle was methodically investigated, the first large-scale excavation of the interior of a hill fort. Between 1934 and 1937, Mortimer Wheeler and Tessa Verney Wheeler excavated both the interior and the defences, work that was funded almost entirely by donations from the public. Wheeler&#x27;s use of the media to disseminate information about the site resulted in Maiden Castle becoming well known. It was one of about 80 hill forts to have been excavated by 1940, in a period known as &quot;hill fort mania&quot; during the 1920s and 1930s.

Between 1985 and 1986 further excavations under Niall Sharples were prompted by the hill fort&#x27;s deteriorating condition, partly caused by the large number of visitors to the site. Under the auspices of English Heritage, repair work and archaeological investigations were undertaken concurrently. Techniques such as radiocarbon dating were available to Sharples that were unavailable to Wheeler, allowing the site to be dated. The structure was made a Scheduled Monument in 1981, giving Maiden Castle protection against unauthorised change; it is now maintained by English Heritage. With parking facilities and information boards for visitors, Maiden Castle is open to the public all year round. Today, the site is in the civil parish of Winterborne Monkton at .
==Cultural references==

English poet and novelist Thomas Hardy (18401928) wrote in his novel The Mayor of Casterbridge (1886), about the affair between Donald Farfrae and the novel&#x27;s heroine, Elizabeth-Jane, at the hillfort whilst, in the 1967 movie version of Hardy&#x27;s 1874 novel Far From the Madding Crowd, the ramparts memorably formed the place where the dashing Sergeant Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Troy (played by Terence Stamp) displayed his swordsmanship to Bathsheba Everdene (played by Julie Christie). Hardy&#x27;s short story from 1893 &#x27;A Tryst at an Ancient Earthwork&#x27; is centred upon an illicit night time excavation within the Roman temple of Maiden Castle.

In 1921, the English composer John Ireland (18791962) wrote the tone poem &quot;Mai-Dun, A Symphonic Rhapsody&quot; about the place, adopting Hardy&#x27;s name for it. In 1931, Ireland arranged his piece for piano four hands.

<doc id="157537" wikidata="Q1123963" url="?curid=157537" title="Quadrophenia">
<text>Quadrophenia is the sixth studio album by the English rock band the Who, released as a double album on 26 October 1973 by Track Records. It is the group&#x27;s third rock opera, the previous two being the &quot;mini-opera&quot; song &quot;A Quick One, While He&#x27;s Away&quot; (1966) and the album &quot;Tommy&quot; (1969). Set in London and Brighton in 1965, the story follows a young mod named Jimmy and his search for self-worth and importance. &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; is the only Who album entirely written by Pete Townshend.

The group started work on the album in 1972 in an attempt to follow up &quot;Tommy&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; (1971), both of which had achieved substantial critical and commercial success. Recording was delayed while bassist John Entwistle and singer Roger Daltrey recorded solo albums and drummer Keith Moon worked on films. Because a new studio was not finished in time, the group had to use Ronnie Lane&#x27;s Mobile Studio. The album makes significant use of Townshend&#x27;s multi-track synthesizers and sound effects, as well as Entwistle&#x27;s layered horn parts. Relationships between the group and manager Kit Lambert broke down irretrievably during recording, and he had left the band&#x27;s service by the time the album was released.

&quot;Quadrophenia&quot; was released to a positive reception in both the UK and the US, but the resulting tour was marred with problems with backing tapes replacing the additional instruments on the album, and the stage piece was retired in early 1974. It was revived in 1996 with a larger ensemble, and a further tour took place in 2012. The album made a positive impact on the mod revival movement of the late 1970s, and the resulting 1979 film adaptation was successful. The album has been reissued on compact disc several times, and seen several remixes that corrected some perceived flaws in the original release.

== Plot ==

The original release of &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; came with a set of recording notes for reviewers and journalists that explained the basic story and plot.

The narrative centres on a young working-class mod named Jimmy. He likes drugs, beach fights and romance, and becomes a fan of the Who after a concert in Brighton, but is disillusioned by his parents&#x27; attitude towards him, dead-end jobs and an unsuccessful trip to see a psychiatrist. He clashes with his parents over his use of amphetamines, and has difficulty finding regular work and doubts his own self-worth, quitting a job as a dustman after only two days. Though he is happy to be &quot;one&quot; of the mods, he struggles to keep up with his peers, and his girlfriend leaves him for his best friend.

After destroying his scooter and contemplating suicide, he decides to take a train to Brighton, where he had enjoyed earlier experiences with fellow mods. However, he discovers the &quot;Ace Face&quot; who led the gang now has a menial job as a bellboy in a hotel. He feels everything in his life has rejected him, steals a boat, and uses it to sail out to a rock overlooking the sea. On the rock and stuck in the rain, he contemplates his life. The ending is left ambiguous as to what happens to Jimmy.

== Background ==
1972 was the least active year for the Who since they had formed. The group had achieved great commercial and critical success with the albums &quot;Tommy&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;, but were struggling to come up with a suitable follow-up. The group recorded new material with &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; collaborator Glyn Johns in May 1972, including &quot;Is It in My Head&quot; and &quot;Love Reign O&#x27;er Me&quot; which were eventually released on &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, and a mini-opera called &quot;Long Live Rock – Rock Is Dead&quot;, but the material was considered too derivative of &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; and sessions were abandoned. In an interview for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, guitarist and bandleader Pete Townshend said &quot;I&#x27;ve got to get a new act together… People don&#x27;t really want to sit and listen to all our past&quot;. He had become frustrated that the group had been unable to produce a film of &quot;Tommy&quot; (a film version of &quot;Tommy&quot; would be released in 1975) or &quot;Lifehouse&quot; (the abortive project that resulted in &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;), and decided to follow Frank Zappa&#x27;s idea of producing a musical soundtrack that could produce a narrative in the same way as a film. Unlike &quot;Tommy&quot;, the new work had to be grounded in reality and tell a story of youth and adolescence that the audience could relate to.

Townshend became inspired by &quot;Long Live Rock – Rock Is Dead&quot;&#x27;s theme and in autumn 1972 began writing material, while the group put out unreleased recordings including &quot;Join Together&quot; and &quot;Relay&quot; to keep themselves in the public eye. In the meantime, bassist John Entwistle released his second solo album, &quot;Whistle Rymes&quot;, singer Roger Daltrey worked on solo material, and Keith Moon featured as a drummer in the film &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot;. Townshend had met up with &quot;Irish&quot; Jack Lyons, one of the original Who fans, which gave him the idea of writing a piece that would look back on the group&#x27;s history and its audience. He created the character of Jimmy from an amalgamation of six early fans of the group, including Lyons, and gave the character a four-way split personality, which led to the album&#x27;s title (a play on schizophrenia). Unlike other Who albums, Townshend insisted on composing the entire work, though he deliberately made the initial demos sparse and incomplete so that the other group members could contribute to the finished arrangement.

Work was interrupted for most of 1972 in order to work on Lou Reizner&#x27;s orchestral version of &quot;Tommy&quot;. Daltrey finished his first solo album, which included the hit single &quot;Giving It All Away&quot;, fueling rumours of a split in the press. Things were not helped by Daltrey discovering that managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp had large sums of money unaccounted for, and suggested they should be fired, which Townshend resisted.

== Recording ==

In order to do justice to the recording of &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, the group decided to build their own studio, Ramport Studios in Battersea. Work started on building Ramport in November 1972, but five months later it still lacked an adequate mixing desk that could handle recording &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;. Instead, Townshend&#x27;s friend Ronnie Lane, bassist for Faces, loaned his mobile studio for the sessions. Lambert ostensibly began producing the album in May, but missed recording sessions and generally lacked discipline. By mid-1973, Daltrey demanded that Lambert leave the Who&#x27;s services. The band recruited engineer Ron Nevison, who had worked with Townshend&#x27;s associate John Alcock, to assist with engineering.

To illustrate the four-way split personality of Jimmy, Townshend wrote four themes, reflecting the four members of the Who. These were &quot;Bell Boy&quot; (Moon), &quot;Is It Me?&quot; (Entwistle), &quot;Helpless Dancer&quot; (Daltrey) and &quot;Love Reign O&#x27;er Me&quot; (Townshend). Two lengthy instrumentals on the album, the title track and &quot;The Rock&quot;, contain the four themes, separately and together. The instrumentals were not demoed but built up in the studio. Who author John Atkins described the instrumental tracks as &quot;the most ambitious and intricate music the group ever undertook.&quot;

Most tracks involved each of the group recording their parts separately; unlike earlier albums, Townshend had left space in his demos for other band members to contribute, though most of the synthesizers on the finished album came from his ARP 2500 synthesizer and were recorded at home. The only song arranged by the band in the studio was &quot;5:15&quot;. According to Nevison, the ARP 2500 was impossible to record in the studio, and changing sounds was cumbersome due to a lack of patches, which required Townshend to work on these parts at home, working late into the night. To obtain a good string section sound on the album, Townshend bought a cello and over two weeks learned how to play it well enough to be recorded.
Entwistle recorded his bass part to &quot;The Real Me&quot; in one take on a Gibson Thunderbird and spent several weeks during the summer arranging and recording numerous multi-tracked horn parts. Having been forced to play more straightforwardly by Johns on &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;, Moon returned to his established drumming style on &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;. He contributed lead vocals to &quot;Bell Boy&quot;, where he deliberately showcased an exaggerated narrative style. For the finale of &quot;Love, Reign O&#x27;er Me&quot;, Townshend and Nevison set up a large group of percussion instruments, which Moon played before kicking over a set of tubular bells, which can be heard on the final mix.

During the album production, Townshend made many field recordings with a portable reel-to-reel recorder. These included waves washing on a Cornish beach and the doppler whistle of a diesel train recorded near Townshend&#x27;s house at Goring-on-Thames. The ending of &quot;The Dirty Jobs&quot; includes a musical excerpt from &quot;The Thunderer&quot;, a march by John Philip Sousa, which Nevison recorded while watching a brass band play in Regent&#x27;s Park. Assembling the field recordings in the studio was problematic; at one point, during &quot;I Am the Sea&quot;, nine tape machines were running sound effects. According to Nevison, Townshend produced the album single-handedly, adding that &quot;everything started when Pete got there, and everything finished when Pete left&quot;. Townshend began mixing the album in August at his home studio in Goring along with Nevison.

== Release ==
The album was preceded by the single &quot;5:15&quot; in the UK, which benefited from a live appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 4 October 1973 and was released the next day. It reached No. 20 in the charts. In the US, &quot;Love Reign O&#x27;er Me&quot; was chosen as the lead single. 

&quot;Quadrophenia&quot; was originally released in North America on 26 October and in the UK on 29 October, but fans found it difficult to find a copy due to a shortage of vinyl caused by the OPEC oil embargo. In the UK, &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; reached No. 2, being held off the top spot by David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Pin Ups&quot;. The album reached No. 2 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, the highest position of any Who album in that country, being kept from No. 1 by Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;.

The album was originally released as a two-LP set with a gatefold jacket and a booklet containing lyrics, a text version of the story, and photographs taken by Ethan Russell illustrating it. MCA Records re-released the album as a two-CD set in 1985 with the lyrics and text storyline on a thin fold-up sheet but none of the photographs. The album was reissued as a remastered CD in 1996, featuring a reproduction of the original album artwork. The original mix had been criticised in particular for Daltrey&#x27;s vocals being buried, so the 1996 CD was completely remixed by Jon Astley and Andy Macpherson.

In 2011, Townshend and longtime Who engineer Bob Pridden remixed the album, resulting in a deluxe five-disc box set. Unlike earlier reissues, this set contains two discs of demos, including some songs that were dropped from the final running order of the album, and a selection of songs in 5.1 surround sound. The box set came with a 100-page book including an essay by Townshend about the album sessions, with photos. At the same time, the standard two-CD version was re-released with a selection of the demos as bonus content; some Disc Two tracks were moved to Disc One to accommodate space for these demos. In 2014, the album was released on Blu-ray Audio featuring a brand-new remix of the entire album by Townshend and Pridden in 5.1 surround sound as well the 2011 Deluxe Edition stereo remix and the original 1973 stereo LP mix.

== Reception ==

Critical reaction to &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; was positive. &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Chris Welch wrote &quot;rarely have a group succeeded in distilling their essence and embracing a motif as convincingly&quot;, while Charles Shaar Murray described the album in &quot;New Musical Express&quot; as the &quot;most rewarding musical experience of the year&quot;. Reaction in the US was generally positive, though Dave Marsh, writing in &quot;Creem&quot; gave a more critical response. Lenny Kaye, wrote in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that &quot;the Who as a whole have never sounded better&quot; but added, &quot;on its own terms, &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; falls short of the mark&quot;. In a year-end top albums list for &quot;Newsday&quot;, Robert Christgau ranked it seventh, and found it exemplary of how 1973&#x27;s best records &quot;fail to reward casual attention. They demand concentration, just like museum and textbook art.&quot;

Retrospective reviews were also positive. Writing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Christgau regarded &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; as more of an opera than &quot;Tommy&quot;, possessing a brilliantly written albeit confusing plot, jarring but melodic music, and compassionate lyrics about &quot;Everykid as heroic fuckup, smart enough to have a good idea of what&#x27;s being done to him and so sensitive he gets pushed right out to the edge anyway&quot;. Chris Jones, writing for BBC Music, said &quot;everything great about the Who is contained herein.&quot; In 2013, &quot;Billboard&quot;, reviewing the album for its 40th anniversary, said: &quot;Filled with performances packed with life and depth and personality, &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; is 90 minutes of the Who at its very best.&quot; The album has sold 1 million copies and has been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 2000 &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; at No. 56 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. The album has been ranked at No. 267 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It is also ranked at No. 86 on VH1&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest albums of all time.

Townshend now considers &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; to be the last great album that the Who recorded. In 2011, he said the group &quot;never recorded anything that was so ambitious or audacious again&quot;, and implied that it was the last album to feature good playing by Keith Moon.

== Live performances ==

=== 1973–1974 tour ===
The band toured in support of &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; but immediately encountered difficulties playing the material live. To achieve the rich overdubbed sound of the album on stage, Townshend wanted Chris Stainton (who had played piano on some tracks) to join as a touring member. Daltrey objected to this and believed the Who&#x27;s performances should only have the four core members. To obtain the required instrumentation without additional musicians, the group elected to employ taped backing tracks for live performance, as they had already done for &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; and &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot;. Initial performances were plagued by malfunctioning equipment. Once the tapes started, the band had to play to them, which constrained their styles. Moon, in particular, found playing &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; difficult as he was forced to stick to a click track instead of watching the rest of the band. The group only allowed two days of rehearsals with the tapes before touring, one of which was abandoned after Daltrey punched Townshend following an argument.

The tour started on 28 October 1973. The original plan had been to play most of the album, but after the first gig at Stoke-on-Trent, the band dropped &quot;The Dirty Jobs&quot;, &quot;Is It in My Head&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Had Enough&quot; from the set. Both Daltrey and Townshend felt they had to describe the plot in detail to the audience, which took up valuable time on stage. A few shows later in Newcastle upon Tyne, the backing tapes to &quot;5:15&quot; came in late. Townshend stopped the show, grabbed Pridden, who was controlling the mixing desk, and dragged him onstage, shouting obscenities at him. Townshend subsequently picked up some of the tapes and threw them over the stage, kicked his amplifier over, and walked off. The band returned 20 minutes later, playing older material. Townshend and Moon appeared on local television the following day and attempted to brush things off. The Who played two other shows in Newcastle without incident.

The US tour started on 20 November at the Cow Palace in San Francisco. The group were nervous about playing &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; after the British tour, especially Moon. Before the show, he was offered some tranquillisers from a fan. Just after the show started, the fan collapsed and was hospitalised. Moon&#x27;s playing, meanwhile, became incredibly erratic, particularly during &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; where he did not seem to be able to keep time with the backing tapes. Towards the end of the show, during &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot;, he passed out over his drumkit. After a 20-minute wait, Moon reappeared onstage, but after a few bars of &quot;Magic Bus&quot;, collapsed again, and was immediately taken to hospital. Scot Halpin, an audience member, convinced promoter Bill Graham to let him play drums, and the group closed the show with him. Moon had a day to recover, and by the next show at the Los Angeles Forum, was playing at his usual strength. The group began to get used to the backing tapes, and the remainder of gigs for the US tour were successful.

The tour continued in February 1974, with a short series of gigs in France. The final show at the Palais de Sports in Lyon on the 24th was the last time &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; was played as a stage piece with Moon, who died in 1978. Townshend later said that Daltrey &quot;ended up hating &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; – probably because it had bitten back&quot;. However, a small selection of songs remained in the set list; live performances of &quot;Drowned&quot; and &quot;Bell Boy&quot; filmed at Charlton Athletic football ground on 18 May were later released on the &quot;30 Years of Maximum R&amp;B&quot; box set.

=== 1996–1997 tour ===
In June 1996, Daltrey, Townshend and Entwistle revived &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; as a live concert. They performed at Hyde Park, London as part of the Prince&#x27;s Trust &quot;Masters of Music&quot; benefit concert, playing most of the album for the first time since 1974. The concert was not billed as the Who, but credited to the three members individually. The performance also included Gary Glitter as the Godfather, Phil Daniels as the Narrator and Jimmy, Trevor MacDonald as the newsreader, Adrian Edmondson as the Bell Boy and Stephen Fry as the hotel manager. The musical lineup included Townshend&#x27;s brother Simon, Zak Starkey on drums (his first appearance with the Who), guitarists David Gilmour (who played the bus driver) and Geoff Whitehorn, keyboardists John &quot;Rabbit&quot; Bundrick and Jon Carin, percussionist Jody Linscott, Billy Nicholls leading a two-man/two-woman backing vocal section, and five brass players. During rehearsals, Daltrey was struck in the face by Glitter&#x27;s microphone stand, and performed the concert wearing an eyepatch.

A subsequent tour of the US and UK followed, employing most of the same players but with Billy Idol replacing Edmondson, Simon Townshend replacing Gilmour and P. J. Proby replacing Glitter during the second half of the tour. 85,000 fans saw the ensemble perform &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; at Madison Square Garden over six nights in July 1996. A recording from the tour was subsequently released in 2005 as part of &quot;Tommy and Quadrophenia Live&quot;.

=== 2010s tours ===
The Who performed Quadrophenia at the Royal Albert Hall on 30 March 2010 as part of the Teenage Cancer Trust series of ten gigs. This one-off performance of the rock opera featured guest appearances from Pearl Jam&#x27;s Eddie Vedder and Kasabian&#x27;s Tom Meighan.

In November 2012, the Who started a U.S. tour of &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, dubbed &quot;Quadrophenia and More&quot;. The group played the entire album without any guest singers or announcements with the then regular Who line-up (including Starkey and bassist Pino Palladino, who replaced Entwistle following his death in 2002) along with five additional musicians. The tour included additional video performances, including Moon singing &quot;Bell Boy&quot; from 1974 and Entwistle&#x27;s bass solo in &quot;5:15&quot; from 2000. After Starkey injured his wrist, session drummer Scott Devours replaced him for part of the tour with minimal rehearsal. The tour progressed, with Devours drumming, to the UK in 2013, ending in a performance at Wembley Arena in July.

In September 2017, Townshend embarked on a short tour with Billy Idol, Alfie Boe, and an orchestra entitled &quot;Classic Quadrophenia&quot;.

== Adaptations ==

=== Film ===

&quot;Quadrophenia&quot; was revived for a film version in 1979, directed by Franc Roddam. The film attempted to portray an accurate visual interpretation of Townshend&#x27;s vision of Jimmy and his surroundings, and included Phil Daniels as Jimmy and Sting as the Ace Face. Unlike the &quot;Tommy&quot; film, the music was largely relegated to the background, and was not performed by the cast as in a rock opera. The film soundtrack included three additional songs written by Townshend, which were Kenney Jones&#x27; first recordings as an official member of the Who. The film was a commercial and critical success, as it conveniently coincided with the mod revival movement of the late 1970s.

=== Other productions ===
There have been several amateur productions of a &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; musical. In 2007, the Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama performed a musical based on the original album at the Sherman Theatre, Cardiff, featuring a cast of 12 backed by an 11-piece band.

In October 1995, the rock group Phish, with an additional four-man horn section, performed &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; in its entirety as their second Halloween &quot;musical costume&quot; at the Rosemont Horizon in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, Illinois. The recording was later released as a part of Live Phish Volume 14. The band also covered the tracks &quot;Drowned&quot; and &quot;Sea and Sand&quot; on their live album &quot;&quot;.

In June 2015, Townshend produced an orchestral version of the album entitled &quot;Classic Quadrophenia&quot;. The album was orchestrated by his partner Rachel Fuller and conducted by Robert Ziegler, with instrumentation provided by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Tenor Alfie Boe sang the lead role, supported by the London Oriana Choir, Billy Idol, Phil Daniels, and Townshend.

<text>Dykes to Watch Out For (sometimes DTWOF) was a weekly comic strip by Alison Bechdel. The strip, which ran from 1983 to 2008, was one of the earliest ongoing representations of lesbians in popular culture and has been called &quot;as important to new generations of lesbians as landmark novels like Rita Mae Brown&#x27;s &quot;Rubyfruit Jungle&quot; (1973) and Lisa Alther&#x27;s &quot;Kinflicks&quot; (1976) were to an earlier one&quot;. It introduced the Bechdel test, a set of criteria for determining gender bias in works of entertainment, that has since found broad application.

==Overview==

&quot;DTWOF&quot; chronicled the lives, loves, and politics of a fairly diverse group of characters (most of them lesbians) living in a medium-sized city in the United States, featuring both humorous soap opera storylines and biting topical commentary. The strip was carried in &quot;Funny Times&quot; and syndicated to a number of gay and lesbian newspapers, and also posted on the web. The first illustrated book edition was published by Firebrand Books in 1986.

According to Bechdel, her strip was &quot;half op-ed column and half endless, serialized Victorian novel&quot;. Characters reacted to contemporary events, including going to the Michigan Womyn&#x27;s Festival, Gay Pride parades and protest marches, and having heated discussions about day-to-day events, political issues and the way lesbian culture was changing. The strip was one of the most successful and longest-running queer comic strips.

On May 10, 2008, Bechdel announced that she was putting the strip on indefinite hiatus in order to complete her graphic novel memoir &quot;Love Life&quot;, which was eventually published in 2012 as &quot;Are You My Mother?&quot;.

On November 23, 2016, Bechdel broke the strip&#x27;s hiatus with an episode called “Pièce de Résistance”. The same characters are shown addressing the eight-year gap and responding to the election of Donald Trump. “Pièce de Résistance” was published in &quot;Seven Days&quot; and on Bechdel&#x27;s website. The amount of traffic caused the website to crash. Bechdel also drew the cover for the November 23–30, 2016 issue of &quot;Seven Days&quot;, featuring the &quot;Dykes to Watch Out For&quot; characters having Thanksgiving dinner. In the strip, the characters reflect on Trump’s presidency and write postcards to the White House for the Ides of the Trump campaign. The &quot;Seven Days&quot; post states that Bechdel “now draws single strips when inspiration strikes.”. In 2023, forty years after the strip&#x27;s debut, &quot;DTWOF&quot; was adapted as a streaming podcast series on Audible by playwright Madeleine George and featured the voices of Carrie Brownstein, Roberta Colindrez, Roxane Gay, Jenn Colella and Jane Lynch, with Bechdel&#x27;s approval.

== Characters ==
The strip ran for 25 years; the characters aged in real time, and their (unnamed) city changed in ways realistic of many US cities. Many of the characters were connected to the city&#x27;s feminist bookstore, which faced insuperable commercial pressures when Bounders Books and Muzak (a parody of Borders Books and Music) moved in. Eventually Madwimmin Books closed, and some of its laid-off employees went to work at Bounders. Other characters are connected via working or studying at the university, shared housing, or romantic relationships.

The central characters included:
* Mo Testa (given name Monica), the central character, a politically committed lesbian feminist with a tendency to . She worked at Madwimmin Bookstore, and then briefly at Bounders Books and Muzak while earning a library science degree, finally getting a job as a reference librarian.
* Lois MacGiver, a sex-positive activist, drag king, also a book clerk at both stores. Lois is housemate to Ginger and Sparrow, and dates single mother Jasmine, mother of transgender teenager Janis (originally introduced as Jonas).
* Ginger Jordan, a struggling academic and English professor at Buffalo Lake State University, whose star student Cynthia was interning at the CIA despite coming out to her parents. Longtime housemate of Lois and Sparrow, Ginger eventually bought a house with Samia, a Syrian Muslim chemist in a lavender marriage to a man.
* Sparrow Pidgeon (birth name Prudence), former women&#x27;s shelter director and New Ager-turned-atheist, who identified herself as a bisexual lesbian (And later just bisexual) and became involved with a straight Jewish male activist, Stuart Goodman (jokingly thought of by the others as being &quot;more stereotypically lesbian than many lesbians&quot;). Sparrow and Stuart have a child, Jiao Raizel (or J.R.), and Stuart becomes a stay-at-home dad; Lois and Stuart homeschooled Janis and J.R.
* Clarice Clifford, a workaholic environmental lawyer and college girlfriend of Mo&#x27;s.
* Toni Ortiz, a CPA and business manager, who had a child with Clarice; she was a stay-at-home-mom for several years while raising their son Rafael Clifford-Ortiz (or Raffi). Toni and Clarice had a commitment ceremony in the backyard, a civil union in Vermont, and a (not legally recognized by the state) marriage at City Hall. They later explored the phenomenon of divorcing without court involvement. Clarice then moved in with Sparrow, Stuart and Lois, taking the room vacated by Ginger.
* Harriet, a state human rights investigator, Mo&#x27;s ex-lover, and single mother to daughter Isabel.
* Dr. Sydney Krukowski, an academically involved, materialistic, yuppie Women&#x27;s Studies professor with a compulsive spending habit, Mo&#x27;s lover and a breast cancer survivor.
* Jezanna Ramsay (birth name Alberta), owner-manager of Madwimmin Books. After its demise, she taught English as a second language.
* Thea, a Jewish lesbian with multiple sclerosis who was Sydney&#x27;s lover in college. Thea worked at Madwimmin Books, and afterwards taught art to kids.

Long-term housemates Sparrow and Ginger purchased the house they had shared first with Lois and later with Stuart. When Ginger wanted to move on, the group was able to buy her share by Sparrow taking the Executive Director position at the state NARAL office.

Only some of the characters&#x27; surnames were known, since such names appeared only when it was appropriate to the dialogue (when Ginger and Sydney, as college instructors, were addressed as &quot;Professor Jordan&quot; and &quot;Dr. Krukowski&quot;, for instance) and were not established from the beginning.

=== Strip collections ===

The strip had a number of strip collections, including:
* &quot;Dykes to Watch Out For&quot; (1986) (non-serialized comics from 1983-1986)
* &quot;More Dykes to Watch Out For&quot; (1988) (strips #1-23, plus &quot;Down to the Skin: A Mildly Erotic Epilogue&quot; and a number of non-serialized comics from 1986-1987)
* &quot;New, Improved! Dykes to Watch Out For&quot; (1990) (strips #24-77)
* &quot;Dykes to Watch Out For: The Sequel&quot; (1992) (strips #78-126, plus &quot;Serial Monogamy&quot;)
* &quot;Spawn of Dykes to Watch Out For&quot; (1993) (strips #127-170, plus &quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot;)
* &quot;Unnatural Dykes to Watch Out For&quot; (1995) (strips #171-221, plus &quot;Sentimental Education&quot;)
* &quot;Hot, Throbbing Dykes to Watch Out For&quot; (1997) (strips #222-263, plus &quot;Sense &amp; Sensibility&quot;)
* &quot;Split-Level Dykes to Watch Out For&quot; (1998) (strips #264-297, plus &quot;Demographic Rift&quot;)
* &quot;Post-Dykes to Watch Out For&quot; (2000) (strips #298-337)
* &quot;Dykes and Sundry Other Carbon-Based Life-Forms to Watch Out For&quot; (2003) (strips #338-397, plus &quot;Replicants&quot;)
* &quot;Invasion of the Dykes to Watch Out For&quot; (2005) (strips #398-457)
* &quot;The Essential Dykes to Watch Out For&quot; (2008) (strips #458-527, plus most of the preceding strips and &quot;Cartoonist&#x27;s Introduction&quot;)

The first of these collections contained miscellaneous, individual strips; the serialized story centered around Mo began halfway through the second collection, &quot;More Dykes to Watch Out For&quot;.

Beginning with the third book Bechdel began including graphic &quot;novellas&quot; at the end of each book. Some were flashbacks, such as the tale of how everyone met in &quot;Unnatural Dykes to Watch Out For&quot;, or &quot;Serial Monogamy&quot;, Bechdel&#x27;s humorous &quot;documentary&quot; on lesbian relationships, but most have advanced the plot in new and interesting ways, such as Raffi&#x27;s birth at the end of &quot;Spawn of Dykes to Watch Out For&quot;.

While not a compilation, &quot;The Indelible Alison Bechdel: Confessions, Comix, and Miscellaneous Dykes to Watch Out For&quot; (1998) included many of the strips Bechdel published in calendars, a timeline of the strip to date, and a fanciful &quot;tour&quot; of the &quot;factory&quot; where &quot;Dykes to Watch Out For&quot; is produced.

&quot;The Essential Dykes to Watch Out For&quot;, published in 2008, compiled most but not all of the strips that had ever been published under the title, along with a 12-page introduction in which Bechdel reflected on her time drawing the strip. The book won the Ferro-Grumley Award for LGBT fiction in 2009.

== Literary references ==

As with Bechdel&#x27;s popular autobiographical novel, &quot;Fun Home&quot;, &quot;DTWOF&quot; included many literary allusions. For example, the name chosen for Sydney Krukowski references Stanley Kowalski, a character from &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. Sydney also drinks Loch Lomond, a brand of Scotch whisky famously invented by Hergé in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;.

<text>Jugurtha or Jugurthen (c. 160 – 104 BC) was a king of Numidia. When the Numidian king Micipsa, who had adopted Jugurtha, died in 118 BC, Jugurtha and his two adoptive brothers, Hiempsal and Adherbal, succeeded him. Jugurtha arranged to have Hiempsal killed and, after a civil war, defeated and killed Adherbal in 112 BC.

The death of Adherbal, which was against the wishes of Rome, along with the growing popular anger in Rome at Jugurtha&#x27;s success in bribing Roman senators and thus avoiding retribution for his crimes, led to the Jugurthine War between Rome and Numidia. After a number of battles in Numidia between Roman and Numidian forces, Jugurtha was captured in 105 BC and paraded through Rome as part of Gaius Marius&#x27; Roman triumph. He was thrown into the Tullianum prison, where he was executed by strangulation in 104 BC. 

==Etymology==
The Numidian name Jugurtha matches the ancient naming traditions of Berber peoples and is likely analyzable as the Libyco-Berber word &quot;yugurtən&quot; “he exceeded them” connected to the stem &quot;agər/ugər&quot; “to exceed” in modern Berber languages.

==Background==
Numidia was a region of North Africa roughly within the boundaries of what is now eastern Algeria, parts of western Tunisia and Western Libya. Indigenous inhabitants of Numidia remained semi-nomadic, often identified as Berbers, until Masinissa, chief of the Massyli tribe based near Cirta, who supported Rome during the Second Punic War (206 BC) against the nearby Punics of Carthage, used the support of Rome to establish a kingdom. To do so Masinissa defeated the rival chief Syphax with the help of famed Roman general Scipio Africanus in 203 BC. Numidian horsemanship and cavalry tactics, as asserted by Polybius, contributed greatly to the development of cavalry tactics in the Roman army which helped them to victory in the Second Punic War. His alliance with Rome began to fray in the mid-second century BC among Roman fears of Masinissa&#x27;s ambitions and of Carthage&#x27;s resurgence on the part of Cato the Elder.

Masinissa died before any actual breach in the treaty in early 148 BC, but the suspicion of Numidia lasted in Rome to affect Jugurtha. Masinissa was succeeded by his son Micipsa. Jugurtha, Micipsa&#x27;s adopted son (Mastanabal&#x27;s illegitimate son and thusly Masinissa&#x27;s illegitimate grandson), was so popular among the Numidians that Micipsa sent him away to Hispania to assist a campaign of Scipio Aemilianus in a poetic parallel to Masinissa&#x27;s alliance with Scipio Africanus as an attempt to mitigate his influence.

Unfortunately for Micipsa, this only served Jugurtha, who used his time in Spain to make several influential Roman contacts. Under Scipio Aemilianus at the siege of Numantia (134–133 BC), serving alongside Gaius Marius, Jugurtha learned of Romans&#x27; weakness for bribes and that powerful friends in Rome can go a long way. He famously described Rome as &quot;urbem venalem et mature perituram, si emptorem invenerit&quot; (&quot;a city for sale and doomed to quick destruction, if it should find a buyer,&quot; Sallust, &quot;Jug.&quot; 35.10).

==Rise to power==
When Micipsa died in 118 BC, he was succeeded jointly by Jugurtha and his two sons (Jugurtha&#x27;s adoptive-brothers) Hiempsal and Adherbal. Hiempsal and Jugurtha quarrelled immediately after the death of Micipsa. Jugurtha had Hiempsal killed, which led to open war with Adherbal. After Jugurtha defeated him in open battle, Adherbal fled to Rome for help. The Roman officials settled the fight by dividing Numidia into two parts, probably in 116, but this settlement was tainted by accusations that the Roman officials accepted bribes to favor Jugurtha. Among the officials found guilty was Lucius Opimius (who, as consul in 121 BC, had presided over events which led to the death of Gaius Gracchus). Jugurtha was assigned the western half; later Roman propaganda claimed that this half was also richer, but in truth it was both less populated and less developed.

==War with Rome==


By 112 BC Jugurtha resumed his war with Adherbal, penning the latter up in his capital of Cirta. Adherbal was encouraged to hold out by a corps of Roman residents, in expectation of military aid arriving from Rome. However, Roman troops were engaged in the Cimbrian War and the Senate merely sent two successive embassies to remonstrate with Jugurtha who delayed until he had captured Cirta. His troops then massacred many residents including the Romans. This brought Jugurtha into direct conflict with Rome, which sent troops under the Consul Lucius Calpurnius Bestia. Although the Romans made significant inroads into Numidia, their heavy infantry was unable to inflict any significant casualties on Jugurtha&#x27;s army which included large numbers of light cavalry.

Immediately following the sack of Cirta, Bestia accepted an offer of negotiations from Jugurtha, a highly favourable peace treaty which raised suspicions of bribery once more. The local Roman commander was summoned to Rome to face corruption charges brought by his political rival and tribune-elect Gaius Memmius, who also induced the tribal assembly to vote safe conduct to Jugurtha to come to Rome to give evidence against the officials suspected of succumbing to bribery. However once Jugurtha had reached Rome, another tribune used his veto to prevent evidence being given. Jugurtha also severely damaged his reputation and weakened his position by using his time in Rome to set gangs onto a cousin, named Massiva, a potential rival for the Numidian throne. The public opinion of Roman citizens and elites, among the most powerful political forces in Republican Rome, turned against him and Jugurtha was once again at war with the Republic.

War again broke out between Numidia and the Roman Republic, and several legions were dispatched to North Africa under the command of the consul, Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus. The war dragged out into a long and seemingly endless campaign, as the Romans tried to inflict a decisive defeat on Jugurtha. A series of incompetent generals of Rome began this renewed war; in 110 BC Jugurtha forced capitulation of an entire army being led by Aulus Postumius Albinus and drove the Romans out of Numidia entirely. Metellus won several battles against Jugurtha in 109 BC but failed to spur Jugurtha to surrender. Frustrated at the stagnation and likely facing political pressure from Rome, Metellus&#x27;s lieutenant, Gaius Marius, returned to Rome to seek election as consul in 107 BC. After winning the election, Marius returned to Numidia to take control of the war which Jugurtha was prolonging through successful guerrilla warfare. 

Jugurtha was allied with his western neighbor Mauretania by marriage, Bocchus I of Mauretania both his ally and father-in-law, an age-old diplomatic move. At the outset of the major war (112–105 BC), Bocchus stood out of the way of the issue, eventually joining Jugurtha in the fighting against Marius in 107 BC. This was short-lived support, though, as in 105 BC Marius sent his quaestor, Sulla, to Mauretania in order to weaken Jugurtha. Bocchus agreed to betray Jugurtha and hand him over to Sulla in exchange for extension of his lands into western Numidia to the Mulucha River. This brought the war to a close; Jugurtha was brought to Rome in chains and was paraded through the streets as Gaius Marius&#x27; Roman triumph after which his royal robes were removed and his earrings were ripped off. He lost an ear lobe in the process. He was then thrown into the Tullianum, where he was either starved to death or (more likely) executed by strangulation in 104 BC. He was survived by his son, Oxyntas.

==Literary references==

Jugurtha features in one of Arthur Rimbaud&#x27;s earliest surviving poems. Rimbaud was a French poet living in the mid- to late nineteenth century, his father a captain in the French army. The poem is a Latin ode to the Numidian king, contextualized to Rimbaud&#x27;s modern context by having the ghost of Jugurtha, à la Hamlet, appear to a baby Abdelkader al-Jazairi (who is unnamed in the poem) a hero of the Algerian struggle for independence against France. The poem opens:

<doc id="157547" wikidata="Q729387" url="?curid=157547" title="Who's Next">
<text>Who&#x27;s Next is the fifth studio album by the English rock band the Who, released on 2 August 1971, by Track Records in the United Kingdom and Decca Records in the United States. It developed from the aborted &quot;Lifehouse&quot; project, a multi-media rock opera conceived by the group&#x27;s guitarist Pete Townshend as a follow-up to the band&#x27;s 1969 album &quot;Tommy&quot;. The project was cancelled owing to its complexity and to conflicts with Kit Lambert, the band&#x27;s manager, but the group salvaged some of the songs, without the connecting story elements, to release as their next album. Eight of the nine songs on &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; were from &quot;Lifehouse&quot;, with the lone exception being the John Entwistle-penned &quot;My Wife&quot;. Ultimately, the remaining &quot;Lifehouse&quot; tracks would all be released on other albums throughout the next decade.

The Who recorded &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; with assistance from recording engineer Glyn Johns. After producing the song &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot; in the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, they relocated to Olympic Studios to record and mix most of the album&#x27;s remaining songs. They made prominent use of synthesizer on the album, particularly on &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot; and &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;, which were both released as singles. The cover photo was shot by Ethan Russell; it made reference to the monolith in the 1968 film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, as it featured the band standing by a concrete piling protruding from a slag heap in South Yorkshire, apparently having urinated against it.

The album was an immediate critical and commercial success and has since been viewed by many critics as the Who&#x27;s best album, as well as one of the greatest albums of all time. It has been reissued on CD several times, often with additional songs originally intended for &quot;Lifehouse&quot; included as bonus tracks. &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; was ranked number 77 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 2020 edition of its &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list.

==Background==

By 1970, the Who had obtained significant critical and commercial success, but they had started to become detached from their original audience. The mod movement had vanished, and the original followers from Shepherd&#x27;s Bush had grown up and acquired jobs and families. The group had started to drift apart from manager Kit Lambert, owing to his preoccupation with his label, Track Records. They had been touring since the release of &quot;Tommy&quot; the previous May, with a set that contained most of that album, but realised that millions had now seen their live performances, and Pete Townshend in particular recognised that they needed to do something new. A single, &quot;The Seeker&quot;, and a live album, &quot;Live at Leeds&quot;, were released in 1970, and an EP of new material (&quot;Water&quot;, &quot;Naked Eye&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Even Know Myself&quot;, &quot;Postcard&quot;, and &quot;Now I&#x27;m a Farmer&quot;) was recorded, but not released, as the band felt it would not be a satisfactory follow-up to &quot;Tommy&quot;.

Instead, the group tackled a project called &quot;Lifehouse&quot;. This evolved from a series of columns Townshend wrote for &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in August 1970, in which he discussed the importance of rock music, and in particular what the audience could do. Of all the group, he was the most keen to use music as a communication device, and wanted to branch out into other media, including film, to get away from the traditional album/tour cycle. Townshend has variously described &quot;Lifehouse&quot; as a futuristic rock opera, a live-recorded concept album and as the music for a scripted film project. The basic plot was outlined in an interview Townshend gave to &quot;Disc and Music Echo&quot; on 24 October 1970. &quot;Lifehouse&quot; is set in the near future in a society in which music is banned and most of the population live indoors in government-controlled &quot;experience suits&quot;. A rebel, Bobby, broadcasts rock music into the suits, allowing people to remove them and become more enlightened. Some elements accurately describe future technology; for example, The Grid resembles the internet and &quot;grid sleep&quot; resembles virtual reality.
The group held a press conference on 13 January 1971, explaining that they would be giving a series of concerts at the Young Vic theatre, where they would develop the fictional elements of the proposed film along with the audience. After Keith Moon had completed his work on the film &quot;200 Motels&quot;, the group performed their first Young Vic concert on 15 February. The show included a new quadrophonic public address system which cost £30,000; the audience was mainly invited from various organisations, such as youth clubs, with only a few tickets on sale to the general public.

After the initial concerts, at Lambert&#x27;s suggestion the group flew to New York to make studio recordings at Record Plant Studios. They were joined by guests Al Kooper on Hammond organ, Ken Ascher on piano, and Leslie West on guitar. Townshend used a 1957 Gretsch guitar, given to him by Joe Walsh, during the session; it went on to become his main guitar for studio recording. Lambert&#x27;s participation in the recording was minimal, and he proved to be unable to mix the final recordings. He had started taking hard drugs, while Townshend was drinking brandy regularly. After returning to Britain, engineer Glyn Johns made safety copies of the Record Plant material, but decided it would be better to re-record the album from scratch at Olympic Sound Studios in Barnes.

The group gave two more concerts at the Young Vic on 25 and 26 April, which were recorded on the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio by Andy Johns, but Townshend grew disillusioned with &quot;Lifehouse&quot; and further shows were cancelled. Audiences at the Young Vic gigs were not interested in interacting with the group to create new material, but simply wanted the Who to play &quot;My Generation&quot; and smash a guitar. The project proved to be intractable on several levels, and caused stress within the band, as well as a major falling-out between Townshend and Lambert. Years later, in the liner notes to the remastered CD, Townshend wrote that the failure of the project led him to the verge of a nervous breakdown. At the time, Roger Daltrey said the Who &quot;were never nearer to breaking up&quot;.

Although the &quot;Lifehouse&quot; concept was abandoned, scraps of the project remained in the final album, including the use of synthesizers and computers. An early concept for &quot;Lifehouse&quot; featured the feeding of personal data from audience members into the controller of an early analogue synthesizer to create a &quot;universal chord&quot; that would have ended the proposed film. Abandoning &quot;Lifehouse&quot; gave the group extra freedom, owing to the absence of an overriding musical theme or storyline (which had been present in &quot;Tommy&quot;). This allowed the band to concentrate on maximising the impact of individual tracks and providing a unifying sound for them.

Townshend continued to develop the concepts of the &quot;Lifehouse&quot; project, revisiting them in later albums, including a 6-CD set, &quot;The Lifehouse Chronicles&quot;, in 1999. In 2007, he launched a (now defunct) website called The Lifehouse Method to accept personal input from applicants that would be turned into musical portraits.

==Recording and production==

The first session for what became &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; was at Mick Jagger&#x27;s house, Stargroves, at the start of April 1971, using the Rolling Stones Mobile. The backing track of &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot; was recorded there before the band decided to relocate recording to Olympic at Johns&#x27; suggestion; the first session there was on 9 April, attempting a basic take of &quot;Bargain&quot;. The bulk of the sessions occurred during May, when the group recorded &quot;Time Is Passing&quot;, &quot;Pure and Easy&quot;, &quot;Love Ain&#x27;t for Keeping&quot; (which had been reworked from a rock track into an acoustic arrangement), &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;, &quot;The Song Is Over&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s See Action&quot; and &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;. Nicky Hopkins guested on piano, while Dave Arbus was invited by Moon to play violin on &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;. John Entwistle&#x27;s &quot;My Wife&quot; was added to the album very late in the sessions, having been originally intended for a solo album.

In contrast to the Record Plant and Young Vic sessions, recording with Johns went well, as he was primarily concerned with creating a good sound, whereas Lambert had always been more preoccupied with the group&#x27;s image; Townshend recalled: &quot;we were just getting astounded at the sounds Glyn was producing&quot;. Townshend used early synthesizers and modified keyboard sounds in several modes, including as a drone effect on several songs, notably &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; and &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot;, but also &quot;Bargain&quot;, &quot;Going Mobile&quot;, and &quot;The Song Is Over&quot;. The synthesizer was used as an integral part of the sound, as opposed to providing gloss, as was the case on other artists&#x27; albums up to that point. Moon&#x27;s drumming has a distinctly different style from earlier albums, being more formal and less reliant on long drum fills—partly owing to the synthesizer backing, but also due to the no-nonsense production techniques of Johns, who insisted on a good recording performance that used flamboyance only when truly necessary. Johns was instrumental in convincing the Who that they should simply put a single-disc studio album out, believing the songs to be excellent. The group gave him free rein to assemble an album of whatever songs he wanted, in any order. Despite Johns&#x27; key contributions, he only received an &quot;associate producer&quot; credit on the finished album, though he maintained he acted mainly in an engineering capacity and based most of the arrangements on Townshend&#x27;s original demos.
The album opened with &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;, featuring piano and synthesizer-processed Lowrey organ by Townshend. The song&#x27;s title pays homage to Townshend&#x27;s guru, Meher Baba, and minimalist composer Terry Riley, and it is informally known as &quot;Teenage Wasteland&quot;, in reference to a line in the lyrics. The organ track came from a longer demo by Townshend, portions of which were later included on a Baba tribute album &quot;I Am&quot;, that was edited down for the final recording. Townshend later said this part had &quot;two or three thousand edits to it&quot;. The opening lyrics to the next track, &quot;Bargain&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;d gladly lose me to find you&quot;) came from a phrase used by Baba. Entwistle wrote &quot;My Wife&quot; after having an argument with his wife, exaggerating the conflict in the lyrics. The track features several overdubbed brass instruments recorded in a single half-hour session. &quot;Pure and Easy&quot;, a key track from &quot;Lifehouse&quot;, did not make the final track selection, but the opening line was included as a coda to &quot;The Song is Over&quot;.

&quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; featured three-part harmony by Daltrey, Townshend, and Entwistle and was written for the main antagonist in &quot;Lifehouse&quot;, Jumbo. Moon, uncharacteristically, did not appear on the first half of the track, which was later described by Who biographer Dave Marsh as &quot;the longest time Keith Moon was still in his entire life.&quot; The closing track, &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot;, was critical of revolutions. Townshend explained: &quot;a revolution is only a revolution in the long run and a lot of people are going to get hurt&quot;. The song features the Lowrey organ fed through an ARP synthesizer, which came from Townshend&#x27;s original demo and was re-used for the finished track.

==Cover art==
The front cover of the album is a photograph, taken on 4 July 1971 on the way from Sheffield to Leicester, of the band apparently having just collectively urinated on a large concrete piling protruding from a slag heap. The idea to shoot the picture came from Entwistle and Moon discussing Stanley Kubrick and the film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. According to photographer Ethan Russell, only Townshend actually urinated against the piling, so rainwater was tipped from an empty film canister to achieve the desired effect. The sky in the background was added later by John Kosh, who was the art director, to give the image what Russell called &quot;this other worldly quality.&quot; The rear cover shows the band backstage at De Montfort Hall, Leicester, amid a cluttered mess of furniture. In 2003, the television channel VH1 named the cover of &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; one of the greatest album covers of all time.

Other suggestions for the cover included the group urinating against a Marshall Stack and an overweight nude woman with the Who&#x27;s faces in place of her genitalia. An alternative cover featuring Moon dressed in black lingerie and a brown wig and holding a whip was later used as part of the inside art of the 1995 and 2003 CD releases of the album. Some of the photographs taken during these sessions were also used as part of Decca&#x27;s United States promotion of the album.

==Release and promotion==

The lead single from the album, &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot; (edited down to three and a half minutes), was released ahead of the album on 25 June 1971 in the UK and in July in the US; it reached #9 and #15 in the charts of the respective countries. The album was released on 2 August in the US and on 27 August in the UK. It became the only album by the Who to top the UK charts.

The Who started touring the US just before the album was released. They used the &quot;Lifehouse&quot; PA, though soundman Bob Pridden found the technical requirements of the equipment to be over-complicated. The set list was revamped, and, while it included a smaller selection of numbers from &quot;Tommy&quot;, several songs from the new album, such as &quot;My Wife&quot;, &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;, and &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot;, became live favourites. The latter two songs involved the band playing to a backing track containing the synthesizer parts. The tour moved to the UK in September, including a show at The Oval in Kennington in front of 35,000 fans and the opening gig at the Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, before going back to the US, ending in Seattle on 15 December. The group then took eight months off touring, the longest break of their career at that point.

Several songs recorded at the &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; sessions, but not included on the album, were later released as singles or on compilations. &quot;Let&#x27;s See Action&quot; was released as a single in 1971, while &quot;Pure and Easy&quot; and &quot;Too Much of Anything&quot; were released on &quot;Odds &amp; Sods&quot;, and &quot;Time is Passing&quot; was added to the 1998 CD version of that album. The longest version of the cover &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t You Do It&quot; from the sessions that is currently available is on the 2003 deluxe edition of &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;.

The album has been re-issued and remastered several times using tapes from different sessions. The master tapes for the Olympic sessions are believed to be lost, as Virgin Records threw out a substantial number of old recordings when they purchased the studio in the 1980s. Video game publisher Harmonix wanted to release &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; as downloadable, playable content for the music video game series &quot;Rock Band&quot;, but were unable to do so due to their inability to find the original multitrack recordings. Instead, a compilation of Who songs dubbed &quot;The Best of The Who&quot;, which includes three of the album&#x27;s songs (&quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;, &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;, and &quot;Going Mobile&quot;) was released as downloadable content. The 16-track tapes for &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot; and the 8-track tapes for the other material, except for &quot;Bargain&quot; and &quot;Getting in Tune&quot;, have since been discovered.

==Critical reception and legacy==

Reviewing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in 1971, music critic Robert Christgau called &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; &quot;the best hard rock album in years&quot; and said that, while their previous recordings were marred by a thin sound, the group now &quot;achieves the same resonant immediacy in the studio that it does live&quot;. Billy Walker from &quot;Sounds&quot; highlighted the songs &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;, &quot;My Wife&quot;, and &quot;The Song Is Over&quot;, and wrote: &quot;After the unique brilliance of &quot;Tommy&quot; something special had to be thought out and the fact that they settled for a straight-forward album rather than an extension of their rock opera, says much for their courage and inventiveness.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s John Mendelsohn felt that, despite some amount of seriousness and artificiality, the album&#x27;s brand of rock and roll is &quot;intelligently-conceived, superbly-performed, brilliantly-produced, and sometimes even exciting&quot;. At the end of 1971, the record was voted the best album of the year in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;.

Retrospectively, &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; has often been viewed as the Who&#x27;s best album. In a review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said its music was more genuine than &quot;Tommy&quot; or the aborted &quot;Lifehouse&quot; project because &quot;those were art – [&quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;], even with its pretensions, is rock &amp; roll.&quot; BBC Music&#x27;s Chris Roberts cited it as the band&#x27;s best record and &quot;one of those carved-in-stone landmarks that the rock canon doesn&#x27;t allow you to bad-mouth.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot; claimed its sophisticated music and hook-laden songs featured innovative use of rock synthesizers that did not weaken the Who&#x27;s characteristic &quot;power-quartet attack&quot;. In &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; (1998), Colin Larkin said the album raised the standards for both hard rock and the Who, whose &quot;sense of dynamics&quot; was highlighted by the contrast between their powerful playing and a counterpoint produced at times by acoustic guitars and synthesizer obbligatos. Christgau, on the other hand, was less enthusiastic about the record during the 1980s, when the Who became what he felt was &quot;the worst kind of art-rock band&quot;, writing that &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; revealed itself to be less tasteful in retrospect because of Daltrey&#x27;s histrionic singing and &quot;all that synth noodling&quot;.

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it 28th on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time; it maintained this rank on the 2012 edition of the list, and was ranked 77th on the 2020 edition. It appeared at number 15 on Pitchfork Media&#x27;s 2004 list of the 100 best records from the 1970s, and was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; (2005). The &quot;Classic Albums&quot; BBC documentary series aired an episode on &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;, initially on radio in 1989, and then on television in 1998, which was released in 2006 on DVD as &quot;Classic Albums: The Who – Who&#x27;s Next&quot;. That year, it was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the 100 best albums of all time. In 2007, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for &quot;lasting qualitative or historical significance&quot;. It was voted number 48 in the 3rd Edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

<text>Allan Sherman (born Allan Copelon or Allan Gerald Copelon; November 30, 1924 – November 20, 1973) was an American musician, satirist and television producer who became known as a song parodist in the early 1960s. His first album, &quot;My Son, the Folk Singer&quot; (1962), became the fastest-selling record album up to that time. His biggest hit was &quot;Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh&quot;, a comic song in which a boy describes his summer camp experiences to the tune of Ponchielli&#x27;s &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot;.

==Early life==
Sherman was born on November 30, 1924, in Chicago, Illinois, to Percy Copelon and Rose Sherman. Percy was an auto mechanic and race car driver from Birmingham, Alabama who suffered from obesity (he weighed over 350 pounds) and died while attempting a 100-day diet. Sherman&#x27;s family was Jewish. His parents divorced when he was seven, and he adopted his mother&#x27;s maiden name. Because his parents frequently moved to new residences, he attended 21 public schools in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, and Miami. For his High School years, he attended Fairfax High School in Los Angeles where he graduated in 1941. He later attended the University of Illinois, where he earned mostly &quot;C&quot; grades and contributed a humor column to &quot;The Daily Illini&quot;, the college newspaper. He was expelled for breaking into the Sigma Delta Tau sorority house with his girlfriend and future wife, Dolores &quot;Dee&quot; Chackes.

==Television writer and producer==
Sherman devised a game show with comedy writer Howard Merrill he intended to call &quot;I Know a Secret&quot;. Television producer Mark Goodson adapted Sherman&#x27;s idea into &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, which ran on CBS from 1952 to 1967. Rather than pay him for the concept, Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions made Sherman the show&#x27;s producer; Merrill was paid a royalty and withdrew from the project. &quot;You couldn&#x27;t help but be fond of Allan, as long as you didn&#x27;t have to work with him,&quot; recalled Goodson-Todman executive Gil Fates. &quot;Notice I said &quot;with&quot; him. He was always kind and understanding to those who worked &quot;for&quot; him.&quot; Sherman clashed with anyone who disagreed with his ideas or tried to restrain his creativity. As producer of &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, which was broadcast live, he showed a fondness for large-scale stunts that teetered on the brink of disaster. He once released 100 rabbits onstage as an Easter surprise for the Madison Square Boys Club, whose members were seated in the studio. The boys were invited to come up onstage to collect their prize. Although the resultant melee made a good story, it did not necessarily make for good television. Fates saw that host Garry Moore, &quot;who was out on stage trying to protect the bunnies as best he could, realized that the spot was beyond salvage. Most of the kids gave back the rabbits.&quot; 

In his autobiography &quot;A Gift of Laughter&quot;, Sherman writes that he was fired from &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; in 1958, the night when guest star Tony Curtis demonstrated childhood street games. First, Curtis had never heard of the games that Sherman wanted to stage, resulting in awkward reenactments. Then, according to Sherman, Henry Morgan was left short of scripted material by seven minutes, and Morgan filled the time by berating Sherman on air. However, the episode in question does not run short. Morgan ends it abruptly and says that they have run out of time. &quot;The spot was not only a fiasco but also a catastrophe,&quot; recalled Fates. &quot;That show was Goodson&#x27;s last straw and Allan&#x27;s last &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;. Within hours, the reaction from the network and the sponsors was in, and Allan was out.&quot; Sherman was replaced by associate producer Chester Feldman.

Sherman also produced a short-lived 1954 game show &quot;What&#x27;s Going On?&quot;, which was technologically ambitious, with studio guests interacting with multiple live cameras in remote locations. In 1961, he produced a daytime game show for Al Singer Productions called &quot;Your Surprise Package&quot;, which aired on CBS with host George Fenneman.

==Song parodies==
In 1951, Sherman recorded a 78-rpm single with veteran singer Sylvia Froos that contains &quot;A Satchel and a Seck&quot;, parodying &quot;A Bushel and a Peck&quot; from &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, coupled with &quot;Jake&#x27;s Song&quot;, parodying &quot;Sam&#x27;s Song&quot;, a contemporary hit for Bing Crosby and his son Gary. The single sold poorly and when Sherman wrote his autobiography, he did not mention it. Later, he found that the song parodies he performed to amuse his friends and family were taking on a life of their own. Sherman lived in the Brentwood section of West Los Angeles next door to Harpo Marx, who invited him to perform his song parodies at parties attended by Marx&#x27;s show-biz friends. After one party, George Burns phoned an executive at Warner Bros. Records and persuaded him to sign Sherman to a contract. The result was an LP of these parodies, &quot;My Son, the Folk Singer&quot;, released in 1962. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. The album was very successful and was quickly followed by &quot;My Son, the Celebrity&quot;.

Capitalizing on his success, in 1962 Jubilee Records re-released Sherman&#x27;s 1951 single on the album &quot;More Folk Songs by Allan Sherman and His Friends&quot;, which compiled material by various Borscht Belt comedians such as Sylvia Froos, Fyvush Finkel and Lee Tully.

Sherman&#x27;s first two LPs were mainly reworkings of old folk songs to infuse them with Jewish humor. His first minor hit was &quot;Sarah Jackman&quot; (pronounced &quot;Jockman&quot;), a takeoff of &quot;Frère Jacques&quot; in which he and a woman (Christine Nelson) exchange family gossip. The popularity of &quot;Sarah Jackman&quot; (as well as the album &quot;My Son, the Folk Singer&quot;) was enhanced after President John F. Kennedy was overheard singing the song in the lobby of the Carlyle hotel. By his peak with &quot;My Son, the Nut&quot; in 1963, however, Sherman had broadened both his subject matter and his choice of parody material and begun to appeal to a larger audience.

Sherman wrote his parody lyrics in collaboration with Lou Busch. A few of the Sherman/Busch songs are completely original creations, featuring original music as well as lyrics, rather than new lyrics applied to an existing melody.

However, Sherman had trouble in getting permission to record for profit from some well-known composers and lyricists, who did not tolerate parodies or satires of their melodies and lyrics, including Irving Berlin, Richard Rodgers, Ira Gershwin, Meredith Willson, Alan Jay Lerner, and Frederick Loewe, as well as the estates of Lorenz Hart, Oscar Hammerstein, Kurt Weill, George Gershwin and Bertolt Brecht, which prevented him from releasing parodies or satires of their songs. In the late 1950s, Sherman was inspired by a recording of a nightclub musical show called &quot;My Fairfax Lady&quot;, a parody of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; set in the Jewish section of Los Angeles that was performed at Billy Gray&#x27;s Band Box. Sherman then wrote his own song parodies of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, which appeared as a bootleg recording in 1964, and were officially released in 2005 on &quot;My Son, the Box&quot;. Alan Jay Lerner did not approve of having the parody being performed; however, he reluctantly settled to allow the performances of &quot;Fairfax Lady&quot;, on the strict conditions that the show could be allowed to be performed only inside the Fairfax Theater, without any touring company, and that the musical could not be videotaped or recorded for any album.

Although Sherman believed that all the songs parodied on &quot;My Son, the Folk Singer&quot; were in the public domain, two of them, &quot;Matilda&quot; and &quot;Water Boy&quot;–parodied as &quot;My Zelda&quot; and &quot;Seltzer Boy&quot;, respectively–were actually under copyright, and Sherman was sued for copyright infringement.

In 1963&#x27;s &quot;My Son, the Nut&quot;, Sherman&#x27;s pointed parodies of classical and popular tunes dealt with automation in the workplace (&quot;Automation&quot;, to the tune of &quot;Fascination&quot;), space travel (&quot;Eight Foot Two, Solid Blue&quot;, to &quot;Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue&quot;), summer camp (&quot;Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh&quot;, to the tune of &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot; by Ponchielli), the exodus from the city to the suburbs (&quot;Here&#x27;s to the Crabgrass&quot;, to the tune of &quot;English Country Garden&quot;), and his own bulky physique (&quot;Hail to Thee, Fat Person&quot;, which claims his obesity was a public service similar to the Marshall Plan). Seven cartoon bears were printed on back of every album.

==A Top 40 hit==
One track from &quot;My Son, the Nut&quot;, a spoof of summer camp titled &quot;Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh&quot;, became a surprise novelty hit, reaching No. 2 on the national &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for three weeks in late summer 1963. The lyrics were sung to the tune of one segment of Ponchielli&#x27;s &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot;. That December, Sherman&#x27;s &quot;The Twelve Gifts of Christmas&quot; single appeared on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s separate Christmas chart. Sherman had one other Top 40 hit, a 1965 take-off on the Petula Clark hit &quot;Downtown&quot; called &quot;Crazy Downtown&quot;, which spent one week at #40. Two other Sherman singles charted in the lower regions of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 100: an updated &quot;Hello Mudduh, Hello Fadduh&quot; (#59 in 1964), and &quot;The Drinking Man&#x27;s Diet&quot; (#98 in 1965). Sherman&#x27;s &quot;The End of a Symphony&quot;, spotlighting Arthur Fiedler&#x27;s Boston Pops Orchestra, reached #113 on the &quot;Bubbling Under&quot; chart in 1964, but did not make the Hot 100.

The songs on Sherman&#x27;s next album &quot;My Name Is Allan&quot; (1965) were thematically connected: except for a couple of original novelty songs with music by Sherman and Busch, all the songs on the album are parodies of songs that had won, or were nominated for, the Academy Award for Best Song. They included &quot;That Old Black Magic&quot;, &quot;Secret Love&quot;, &quot;The Continental&quot;, &quot;Chim Chim Cher-ee&quot; and &quot;Call Me Irresponsible&quot;. The cover of the album bore a childhood photograph of Sherman. That, and the album&#x27;s title, were references to Barbra Streisand&#x27;s album &quot;My Name Is Barbra&quot;, released earlier that year, which featured a cover photograph of the singer as a young girl.

During his brief heyday, Sherman&#x27;s parodies were so popular that he had at least one contemporary imitator: &quot;My Son the Copycat&quot; was an album of song parodies performed by Stanley Ralph Ross, co-written by Ross and Bob Arbogast. Lest there be any doubt of whom Ross is copying, his album&#x27;s cover bears a crossed-out photo of Sherman. One of the songs on this album is a fat man&#x27;s lament, &quot;I&#x27;m Called Little Butterball&quot;, parodying &quot;I&#x27;m Called Little Buttercup&quot; from Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s operetta &quot;HMS Pinafore&quot;. Sherman would later parody this same song as &quot;Little Butterball&quot; – with the same subject matter – on his album &quot;Allan in Wonderland&quot;. The song may have had more poignancy for Sherman, as he, unlike Stanley Ross, was genuinely overweight. Sherman also parodied Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Titwillow&quot; from &quot;The Mikado&quot;, in the song &quot;The Bronx Bird-Watcher&quot; (on &quot;My Son, the Celebrity&quot;), as well as several other Gilbert and Sullivan songs.

==Later work==
In 1965, Sherman published an autobiography, &quot;A Gift of Laughter&quot;, and, for a short period at least, he was culturally ubiquitous. He sang on and guest-hosted &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, was involved in the production of Bill Cosby&#x27;s first three albums, appeared in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, and sang &quot;The Dropouts&#x27; March&quot; on the March 6, 1964, edition of the NBC satirical program &quot;That Was The Week That Was&quot;.

Also in 1964, Sherman narrated his own version of Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; in a live concert at Tanglewood with the Boston Pops under Arthur Fiedler. The concert, which was released by RCA Victor Red Seal as the album &quot;Peter and the Commissar&quot;, also included &quot;Variations on &#x27;How Dry I Am&#x27;&quot;, with Sherman as conductor, and &quot;The End of a Symphony&quot;. In &quot;Variations&quot;, Fiedler was the guest soloist, providing solo hiccups. In 2004, Collector&#x27;s Choice reissued the complete RCA Victor album on CD.

Sherman&#x27;s later albums grew more pointedly satirical and less light-hearted, skewering protesting students (&quot;The Rebel&quot;), consumer debt (&quot;A Waste of Money&quot;, based on &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot;), and the generation gap (&quot;Crazy Downtown&quot; and &quot;Pop Hates the Beatles&quot;). It was for this reason that Ken Barnes, when attempting to analyze American music acts that were harmed by the British Invasion, surmised in 2021 that Sherman had been doomed to lose momentum anyway and could not blame the Invasion for his career decline (even as &quot;Crazy Downtown&quot; was a top-40 hit for him).

Sherman was often tapped to produce specialty song parodies for corporations. An album of six paper-cup and vending machine related songs, titled &quot;Music to Dispense With&quot;, was created for the Container Division of the Scott Paper Company for distribution to its vendors and customers. It consisted of the tracks &quot;Makin&#x27; Coffee&quot; (a parody of &quot;Makin&#x27; Whoopee&quot;), &quot;Vending Machines&quot;, &quot;There Are Cups&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s How the Change Is Made&quot;, &quot;The Wonderful Tree in the Forest&quot; and &quot;Scott Cups&quot;.

Sherman also created a group of eight &quot;public education&quot; radio spots for Encron carpet fibers, singing their praises to the tunes of old public-domain songs. Entitled &quot;Allan Sherman Pours It On for Carpets Made with Encron Polyester&quot;, it featured an introduction by Sherman and comprised the tracks &quot;Encron Is a Brand New Fiber&quot; (to the tune of the Michael Renzi-Jack Norworth-Nora Bayes hit &quot;Shine On, Harvest Moon&quot;), &quot;Put Them All Together, They Spell Encron&quot; (to the tune of Theodore Morse and E. Johnson Howard&#x27;s &quot;M-O-T-H-E-R&quot;), &quot;There&#x27;s a Fiber Called Encron&quot; (to the tune of William H. Hill&#x27;s &quot;There is a Tavern in the Town&quot;), &quot;Encron Alive, Alive-O&quot; (to the tune of &quot;Molly Malone&quot;), &quot;Encron&#x27;s the Name&quot;, &quot;Why They Call It Encron&quot; (to the tune of &quot;Let Me Call You Sweetheart&quot;), &quot;Encron, Encron&quot; (to the tune of &quot;Daisy Bell&quot;) and &quot;Encron Is a Great New Fiber&quot; (to the tune of &quot;Take Me to the Fair&quot;).

==Decline==

Sherman&#x27;s career success was short-lived: after peaking in 1963, his popularity declined rather quickly. After the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the public taste for Sherman&#x27;s type of comedy lessened. Beginning in 1964, Sherman was among many American acts whose sales were affected badly by the British Invasion (which Sherman skewered in the song &quot;Pop Hates the Beatles&quot;, a spoof of &quot;Pop! Goes the Weasel&quot;).

By 1965, Sherman had released two albums that did not make the Top 50 and in 1966, Warner Bros. Records dropped him from the roster. His last album for WB, &quot;Togetherness&quot;, was released in 1967 to poor reviews and poor sales. All of his previous releases had been recorded in front of a live studio audience – or in the case of &quot;Live, Hoping You Are the Same&quot;, recorded during a Las Vegas performance – but &quot;Togetherness&quot; was purely a studio recording, and the lack of an audience and their response affected the result, as did the nondescript backup singers and studio orchestra.

On November 13, 1965, Sherman made a rare primetime television acting appearance in &quot;The Sheriff of Fetterman&#x27;s Crossing,&quot; an episode of Rod Serling&#x27;s short-lived Western series &quot;The Loner&quot; (1965–1966). Sherman played Walton Peterson Tetley, a local schnook who went off to war and rose to regiment cook before returning home a hero, thanks to tall tales and yarn-spinning. The town hails its conquering hero and Tetley is appointed sheriff. Series star Lloyd Bridges as William Colton, a wandering Union veteran, comes to town and signs on to be Tetley&#x27;s deputy, discovering quickly his boss&#x27; utter incompetence in the office. Tetley receives a threatening note from a gunslinger challenging this purported hero to a gunfight when he arrives on the noon stage, at which point the story becomes a parody of iconic Western movie &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952). Colton sets to teaching the shivering-in-his-boots sheriff courage and gunmanship. Sherman&#x27;s semi-serious and sympathetic performance was strong and his presence an affable one.

In 1966, Sherman visited Australia. He did a television series in Melbourne, Victoria, for a live audience. During the performance, he sang a parody of &quot;Molly Malone.&quot; It included a play on the word &quot;but&quot; (butt) which did not elicit a laugh. What Sherman did not know is that Australians use the word &quot;bum&quot; where Americans would say &quot;butt&quot; (although usage of the word &quot;butt&quot; has since become widespread in Australia). Otherwise, Sherman was well received by the audience. Afterward, he met with some of his fans and signed at least one autograph.

In 1969, Sherman wrote the book and lyrics – with music by Albert Hague – for &quot;The Fig Leaves Are Falling&quot;, a flop Broadway musical that ran only four performances, despite direction by George Abbott and a cast that included Barry Nelson, Dorothy Loudon, and David Cassidy. Still creative, in 1973, Sherman published the controversial &quot;The Rape of the A*P*E*&quot;, which detailed his point of view on American Puritanism and the sexual revolution.

In 1971, Sherman was the voice of Dr. Seuss&#x27;s &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; for the animated television special. He reprised the role for &quot;Dr. Seuss on the Loose&quot;, his last project before his death.

==Health problems and death==
In his final years, Sherman&#x27;s alcoholism and weight gain caused severe deterioration of his health; he later developed diabetes and struggled with lung disease. In 1966, his wife Dee filed for divorce and received full custody of their son and daughter.

Sherman lived on unemployment benefits for a time and moved into the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital for a short time to lose weight. He died while entertaining his friends during the night of November 20, 1973, at his home in Los Angeles, California, ten days shy of his 49th birthday. According to sheriff&#x27;s officers, Sherman, who had been undergoing treatment for emphysema, asthma, and obesity, died of respiratory failure. He is entombed in Culver City, California&#x27;s Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Sherman was the inspiration for a new generation of developing parodists such as &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, who pays homage to Sherman on the cover of his first LP.

Sherman&#x27;s hit song &quot;Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh&quot; has been translated into other languages. In one notable example, the Dutch–Swedish poet Cornelis Vreeswijk translated the song loosely into Swedish as &quot;Brev från kolonien&quot; (Letter from Summer Camp), which reached fourth on the Swedish popular music chart Svensktoppen in the summer of 1965 and is still popular in Sweden today.

A &quot;Best of Allan Sherman&quot; CD was released in 1990, and a boxed set of most of his songs was released in 2005 under the title &quot;My Son, the Box&quot;. In 1992 a musical revue of his songs titled &quot;Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah&quot; ran for over a year off-off-Broadway; other productions ran Off-Broadway for four months in 2001 and toured in 2003. A children&#x27;s book based on the song &quot;Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh&quot;, with illustrations by Syd Hoff, was published in 2004.

On March 14, 2006, National Public Radio profiled Sherman on &quot;All Things Considered&quot;.

In 2010, eight of Allan Sherman&#x27;s Warner Records albums were individually released on CD:
*&quot;My Son, the Folk Singer&quot;
*&quot;My Son, the Celebrity&quot;
*&quot;My Son, the Nut&quot;
*&quot;Allan in Wonderland&quot;
*&quot;For Swingin&#x27; Livers Only!&quot;
*&quot;My Name Is Allan&quot;
*&quot;Allan Sherman: Live! (Hoping You Are the Same)&quot;
*&quot;Togetherness&quot;.

Sherman&#x27;s son Robert (not to be confused with others of that name in the showbusiness industry) became a game show producer, producing for Mark Goodson during the 1970s and 1980s, including &quot;Password Plus&quot;, &quot;Blockbusters&quot;, &quot;Body Language&quot; and &quot;Super Password&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* Sherman&#x27;s song &quot;Ratt Fink&quot; was covered by punk rock band The Misfits on their 1979 single &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;. It was also covered by Ex-Misfits guitarist Bobby Steele by his band The Undead. Sherman wrote the song as a parody of &quot;Rag Mop,&quot; originally performed by Johnnie Lee Wills and popularized by The Ames Brothers in 1950.
* In the &quot;Three Gays of the Condo&quot; episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Homer asks &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic which of two parody songs Homer sent him he preferred, and Yankovic replies that they were pretty much the same. Homer then mutters angrily, &quot;Yeah, like you and Allan Sherman.&quot; Other references to Sherman came in the episode &quot;Marge Be Not Proud&quot;, when Bart hides an answering machine tape in a copy of his (fictitious) &quot;Camp Granada&quot; album – &quot;where no one would ever listen to it&quot;; in another episode, where Homer flips through his meager collection of LPs which includes a copy of &quot;My Son, the Folk Singer&quot;; and in &quot;A Midsummer&#x27;s Nice Dream&quot;, where Homer shows Bart and Lisa his copy of another fictional Sherman album, &quot;Helter Shmelter: Sorry for the Mess&quot;.
* The political parody group Capitol Steps used &quot;Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh&quot; in &quot;Fools on the Hill (Songs of 1992)&quot;.
* Dutch comedian Rijk de Gooyer sang two Dutch versions of &quot;Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh&quot; named &quot;Brief uit La Courtine&quot; (Letter from La Courtine) and &quot;Brief naar La Courtine&quot; (Letter to La Courtine). In the first one, he describes his adventures as a soldier in the Dutch base at La Courtine; the second is his father&#x27;s reply.

<text>Karl Schwarzschild (; 9 October 1873 – 11 May 1916) was a German physicist and astronomer.

Schwarzschild provided the first exact solution to the Einstein field equations of general relativity, for the limited case of a single spherical non-rotating mass, which he accomplished in 1915, the same year that Einstein first introduced general relativity. The Schwarzschild solution, which makes use of Schwarzschild coordinates and the Schwarzschild metric, leads to a derivation of the Schwarzschild radius, which is the size of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole.

Schwarzschild accomplished this while serving in the German army during World War I. He died the following year, possibly from the autoimmune disease pemphigus, which he developed while at the Russian front.

Asteroid 837 Schwarzschilda is named in his honour, as is the large crater &quot;Schwarzschild&quot;, on the far side of the Moon.

==Life==
Karl Schwarzschild was born on 9 October 1873 in Frankfurt on Main, the eldest of six boys and one girl, to Jewish parents. His father was active in the business community of the city, and the family had ancestors in Frankfurt from the sixteenth century onwards. The family owned two fabric stores in Frankfurt. His brother Alfred became a painter. The young Schwarzschild attended a Jewish primary school until 11 years of age and then the Lessing-Gymnasium (secondary school). He received an all-encompassing education, including subjects like Latin, Ancient Greek, music and art, but developed a special interest in astronomy early on. In fact he was something of a child prodigy, having two papers on binary orbits (celestial mechanics) published before the age of sixteen.

After graduation in 1890, he attended the University of Strasbourg to study astronomy. After two years he transferred to the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich where he obtained his doctorate in 1896 for a work on Henri Poincaré&#x27;s theories.

From 1897, he worked as assistant at the Kuffner Observatory in Vienna. His work here concentrated on the photometry of star clusters and laid the foundations for a formula linking the intensity of the starlight, exposure time, and the resulting contrast on a photographic plate. An integral part of that theory is the Schwarzschild exponent (astrophotography). In 1899, he returned to Munich to complete his Habilitation.

From 1901 until 1909, he was a professor at the prestigious Göttingen Observatory within the University of Göttingen, where he had the opportunity to work with some significant figures, including David Hilbert and Hermann Minkowski. Schwarzschild became the director of the observatory. He married Else Rosenbach, a great-granddaughter of Friedrich Wöhler and daughter of a professor of surgery at Göttingen, in 1909. Later that year they moved to Potsdam, where he took up the post of director of the Astrophysical Observatory. This was then the most prestigious post available for an astronomer in Germany.

From 1912, Schwarzschild was a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences.

At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Schwarzschild volunteered for service in the German army despite being over 40 years old. He served on both the western and eastern fronts, specifically helping with ballistic calculations and rising to the rank of second lieutenant in the artillery.

While serving on the front in Russia in 1915, he began to suffer from pemphigus, a rare and painful autoimmune skin-disease. Nevertheless, he managed to write three outstanding papers, two on the theory of relativity and one on quantum theory. His papers on relativity produced the first exact solutions to the Einstein field equations, and a minor modification of these results gives the well-known solution that now bears his name — the Schwarzschild metric.

In March 1916, Schwarzschild left military service because of his illness and returned to Göttingen. Two months later, on May 11, 1916, his struggle with pemphigus may have led to his death at the age of 42.

He rests in his family grave at the Stadtfriedhof Göttingen.

With his wife Else he had three children:

* Agathe Thornton (1910–2006) emigrated to Great Britain in 1933. In 1946, she moved to New Zealand, where she became a classics professor at the University of Otago in Dunedin.
* Martin Schwarzschild (1912–1997) became a professor of astronomy at Princeton University.
* Alfred Schwarzschild (1914–1944) remained in Nazi Germany and was murdered during the Holocaust.

==Work==
Thousands of dissertations, articles, and books have since been devoted to the study of Schwarzschild&#x27;s solutions to the Einstein field equations. However, although his best known work lies in the area of general relativity, his research interests were extremely broad, including work in celestial mechanics, observational stellar photometry, quantum mechanics, instrumental astronomy, stellar structure, stellar statistics, Halley&#x27;s Comet, and spectroscopy.

Some of his particular achievements include measurements of variable stars, using photography, and the improvement of optical systems, through the perturbative investigation of geometrical aberrations.

===Physics of photography===
While at Vienna in 1897, Schwarzschild developed a formula, now known as the Schwarzschild law, to calculate the optical density of photographic material. It involved an exponent now known as the Schwarzschild exponent, which is the formula_1 in the formula:

formula_2

(where formula_3 is optical density of exposed photographic emulsion, a function of formula_4, the intensity of the source being observed, and formula_5, the exposure time, with formula_1 a constant). This formula was important for enabling more accurate photographic measurements of the intensities of faint astronomical sources.

===Electrodynamics===

According to Wolfgang Pauli, Schwarzschild is the first to introduce the correct Lagrangian formalism of the electromagnetic field as

formula_7

where formula_8 are the electric and applied magnetic fields, formula_9 is the vector potential and formula_10 is the electric potential.

He also introduced a field free variational formulation of electrodynamics (also known as &quot;action at distance&quot; or &quot;direct interparticle action&quot;) based only on the world line of particles as 

formula_11

where formula_12 are the world lines of the particle, formula_13 the (vectorial) arc element along the world line. Two points on two world lines contribute to the Lagrangian (are coupled) only if they are a zero Minkowskian distance (connected by a light ray), hence the term formula_14. The idea was further developed by Hugo Tetrode
and Adriaan Fokker in the 1920s and John Archibald Wheeler and Richard Feynman in the 1940s and constitutes an alternative but equivalent formulation of electrodynamics.

===Relativity===
Einstein himself was pleasantly surprised to learn that the field equations admitted exact solutions, because of their &quot;prima facie&quot; complexity, and because he himself had produced only an approximate solution. Einstein&#x27;s approximate solution was given in his famous 1915 article on the advance of the perihelion of Mercury. There, Einstein used rectangular coordinates to approximate the gravitational field around a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, non-charged mass. Schwarzschild, in contrast, chose a more elegant &quot;polar-like&quot; coordinate system and was able to produce an exact solution which he first set down in a letter to Einstein of 22 December 1915, written while he was serving in the war stationed on the Russian front. He concluded the letter by writing: &quot;As you see, the war is kindly disposed toward me, allowing me, despite fierce gunfire at a decidedly terrestrial distance, to take this walk into this your land of ideas.&quot; In 1916, Einstein wrote to Schwarzschild on this result:


Schwarzschild&#x27;s second paper, which gives what is now known as the &quot;Inner Schwarzschild solution&quot; (in German: &quot;innere Schwarzschild-Lösung&quot;), is valid within a sphere of homogeneous and isotropic distributed molecules within a shell of radius r=R. It is applicable to solids; incompressible fluids; the sun and stars viewed as a quasi-isotropic heated gas; and any homogeneous and isotropic distributed gas.

Schwarzschild&#x27;s first (spherically symmetric) solution &quot;does not&quot; contain a coordinate singularity on a surface that is now named after him. In his coordinates, this singularity lies on the sphere of points at a particular radius, called the Schwarzschild radius:

:formula_15

where &quot;G&quot; is the gravitational constant, &quot;M&quot; is the mass of the central body, and &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light in vacuum. In cases where the radius of the central body is less than the Schwarzschild radius, formula_16 represents the radius within which all massive bodies, and even photons, must inevitably fall into the central body (ignoring quantum tunnelling effects near the boundary). When the mass density of this central body exceeds a particular limit, it triggers a gravitational collapse which, if it occurs with spherical symmetry, produces what is known as a Schwarzschild black hole. This occurs, for example, when the mass of a neutron star exceeds the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (about three solar masses).

<text>In the U.S. federal judicial system, the United States is divided into 94 judicial districts. Each state has at least one judicial district, as do the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 

Each judicial district contains a United States district court with a bankruptcy court under its authority. There is also a United States Attorney in each district, who acts as the federal government&#x27;s lawyer in the district, both prosecuting federal criminal cases and defending the government (and its employees) in civil suits against them; the U.S. Attorney is not employed by the judicial branch but by the Department of Justice, part of the executive branch. There is also a Federal Public Defender who represents people charged with federal crimes who cannot afford to hire their own lawyers; some FPDs cover more than one judicial district. Each district also has a United States Marshal who serves the court system.

Three territories of the United States — the Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands — have district courts that hear federal cases, including bankruptcy cases. The breakdown of what is in each judicial district is codified in . Federal judicial districts have also been established in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Courts in other insular areas are territorial courts under Article I of the Constitution, not United States district courts, although they have similar jurisdiction. Only two districts have jurisdiction over areas outside the state in which the court sits:

* The District of Wyoming includes all of Yellowstone National Park, including areas in Montana and Idaho.
* The District of Hawaii includes Midway Island, Palmyra Island, and a number of other uninhabited Pacific island possessions of the United States.

==Census 1790–1840==
From 1790 to 1840 judicial district offices were responsible for census activities, which were in turn conducted by the United States Marshal Service. After the passage of the Census Act of 1840 a central federal census was formed to take charge of census activities.

==List of districts==
Below is a list of the federal judicial districts and the place(s) where each court &quot;sits&quot; (holds trials) in each district.

<doc id="157562" wikidata="Q582642" url="?curid=157562" title="Marble Madness">
<text>Marble Madness is an arcade video game designed by Mark Cerny and published by Atari Games in 1984. It is a platform game in which the player must guide a marble through six courses, populated with obstacles and enemies, within a time limit. The player controls the marble by using a trackball. &quot;Marble Madness&quot; is known for using innovative game technologies: it was Atari&#x27;s first to use the Atari System 1 hardware, the first to be programmed in the C programming language, and one of the first to use true stereo sound (previous games used either monaural sound or simulated stereo).

In designing the game, Cerny drew inspiration from miniature golf, racing games, and artwork by M. C. Escher. He aimed to create a game that offered a distinct experience with a unique control system. Cerny applied a minimalist approach in designing the appearance of the game&#x27;s courses and enemies. Throughout development, he was frequently impeded by limitations in technology and had to forgo several design ideas.

Upon its release in arcades, &quot;Marble Madness&quot; was commercially successful and profitable. Critics praised the game&#x27;s difficulty, unique visual design, and stereo soundtrack. The game was ported to numerous platforms and inspired the development of other games. A sequel was developed and planned for release in 1991, but it was canceled when location testing showed the game could not succeed in competition with other titles.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Marble Madness&quot; is an isometric platform game in which the player manipulates an onscreen marble from a third-person perspective. In the arcade version, a player controls the marble&#x27;s movements with a trackball; most home versions use game controllers with directional pads. The player&#x27;s goal is to complete six maze-like isometric race courses before a set amount of time expires. With the exception of the first race, any time left on the clock at the end of a race is carried over to the next one, and the player is granted a set amount of additional time as well. The game allows two players to compete against each other, awarding bonus points and extra time to the winner of each race; both players have separate clocks.

Courses are populated with various objects and enemies, designed to obstruct the player, as well as track surfaces that make control of the marble more difficult. As the game progresses, the courses become increasingly difficult and introduce more enemies and obstacles. Each course has a distinct visual theme. For example, the first race (titled &quot;Practice&quot;) is a simple course that is much shorter than the others, while the fifth race (named &quot;Silly&quot;) features polka-dot patterns and is oriented in a direction opposite that of the other courses.

==Development==
&quot;Marble Madness&quot; was developed by Atari Games, with Mark Cerny as the lead designer and Bob Flanagan as the software engineer. Both Cerny and Flanagan handled programming the game. It uses the Atari System 1 hardware, which was an interchangeable system of circuit boards, control panels, and artwork. The game features pixel graphics on a 19-inch Electrohome G07 model CRT monitor and uses a Motorola 68010 central processing unit (CPU) with a MOS Technology 6502 subsystem to control the audio and coin operations. &quot;Marble Madness&quot; was the very first arcade game to use an FM sound chip produced by Yamaha, similar to a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer, which created the music in real time so that it was in synchronization with the game&#x27;s on-screen action. The game&#x27;s music was composed by Brad Fuller and Hal Canon who spent a few months becoming familiar with the sound chip&#x27;s capabilities.

Cerny and Flanagan first collaborated on a video game based on Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;. The project was canceled and the two began working on an idea of Cerny&#x27;s that eventually became &quot;Marble Madness&quot;. Development lasted . Following the video game crash of 1983, game development within Atari focused on providing a distinctive experience through the use of a unique control system and by emphasizing a simultaneous two-player mode. Cerny designed &quot;Marble Madness&quot; in accordance with these company goals. He was first inspired by miniature golf and captivated by the idea that a playfield&#x27;s contours influenced a ball&#x27;s path. Cerny began testing various ideas using Atari&#x27;s digital art system. After deciding to use an isometric grid, Cerny began developing the game&#x27;s concept. His initial idea involved hitting a ball in a way similar to miniature golf, but Atari was unenthusiastic. Cerny next thought of racing games and planned for races on long tracks against an opponent. Technology limitations at the time were unable to handle the in-game physics necessary for the idea, and Cerny switched the game&#x27;s objective to a race against time.

The development toolkit for the Motorola CPU included a compiler for the C programming language, which the two programmers were familiar with. After Atari had conducted performance evaluations, it approved usage of the language. Cerny and Flanagan&#x27;s decision to program &quot;Marble Madness&quot; in the C language had positive and negative consequences. Atari games had previously been programmed in assembly language. The C language was easier to program, but was less efficient, so the game operates at the slower speed of instead of the normal frequency of arcade games at the time. Cerny decided to use a trackball system (marketed by Atari as Trak-Ball) to give the game a unique control system, and he chose a motorized trackball for faster spinning and braking when the in-game ball traveled downhill and uphill, respectively. As it was building the prototypes, Atari&#x27;s design department informed Cerny that the motorized trackball&#x27;s design had an inherent flaw—one of the four supports had poor contact with the ball—and the use of a regular trackball was more feasible. Additionally, Cerny had anticipated the use of powerful custom chips that would allow RAM-based sprites to be animated by the CPU, but the available hardware was a less advanced system using ROM-based static sprites.

These technical limitations forced Cerny to simplify the overall designs. Inspired by M. C. Escher, he designed abstract landscapes for the courses. In retrospect, Cerny partly attributed the designs to his limited artistic skills. He was a fan of the 3D graphics used in &quot;Battlezone&quot; and &quot;I, Robot&quot;, but felt that the visuals lacked definition and wanted to create a game with &quot;solid and clean&quot; 3D graphics. Unlike most other arcade games of the time, the course images were not drawn on the pixel level. Instead, Cerny defined the elevation of every point in the course and stored this information in a heightmap array. The course graphics were then created by a ray tracing program that traced the path of light rays, using the heightmap to determine the appearance of the course on screen. This format also allowed Cerny to create shadows and use spatial anti-aliasing, a technique that provided the graphics with a smoother appearance. Cerny&#x27;s course generator allowed him more time to experiment with the level designs. When deciding what elements to include in a course, practicality was a big factor; elements that would not work or would not appear as intended were omitted, such as an elastic barricade or a teeter-totter scale. Other ideas dropped from the designs were breakable glass supports, black hole traps, and bumps and obstacles built into the course that chased the marble.

Cerny&#x27;s personal interests changed throughout the project, leading to the inclusion of new ideas absent from the original design documents. The game&#x27;s enemy characters were designed by Cerny and Sam Comstock, who also animated them. Enemies had to be small in size due to technical limitations. Cerny and Comstock purposely omitted faces to give them unique designs and create a minimalistic appearance similar to the courses. Atari&#x27;s management, however, suggested that the marble should have a smiley face to create an identified character, similar to Pac-Man. As a compromise, the cabinet&#x27;s artwork depicts traces of a smiley face on the marbles. Flanagan programmed a three-dimensional physics model to dictate the marble&#x27;s motions and an interpreted script for enemy behavior. As &quot;Marble Madness&quot; neared completion, the feedback from Atari&#x27;s in-house focus testing was positive. In retrospect, Cerny wished he had included more courses to give the game greater longevity, but extra courses would have required more time and increased hardware costs. Atari was experiencing severe financial troubles at the time and could not extend the game&#x27;s development period as it would have left their production factory idle.

==Release==

The game was originally released in arcades in December 1984. Beginning in 1986, &quot;Marble Madness&quot; was released for multiple platforms with different companies handling the conversions; several home versions were published by Electronic Arts, Tiger Electronics released handheld and tabletop LCD versions of the game, and was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System by Rare to the Sega Mega Drive in Japan by Tengen, and to the Sega Genesis by Electronic Arts. The Commodore 64 and Apple IIe versions have a secret level not present in other versions.

Beginning with the 1998 title &quot;Arcade&#x27;s Greatest Hits: The Atari Collection 2&quot;, &quot;Marble Madness&quot; has been included in several arcade game compilations. In 2003, it was included in the multi-platform &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures&quot;, a compilation of games developed by Williams Electronics, Midway Games and Atari. &quot;Marble Madness&quot; was also included in the 2012 &quot;Midway Arcade Origins&quot; collections. THQ Wireless released a Java port in 2004. Electronic Arts released a mobile phone port in 2010 that includes additional levels with different themes and new items that augment the gameplay. An iOS port was in development, but was never released.

==Reception==
&quot;Marble Madness&quot; was commercially successful following its December 1984 release and was positively received by critics. Around were sold, and it soon became the highest-earning game in arcades. However, the game consistently fell from this ranking during its seventh week in arcades where Atari tracked the game&#x27;s success. Cerny attributed the six-week arcade life to &quot;Marble Madness&quot;″s short gameplay length. He believed that players lost interest after mastering it and moved on to other games. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Marble Madness&quot; on their May 1, 1985 issue as being the second most-successful upright/cockpit arcade unit of the month.

Many reviewers felt that the high level of skill required to play the game was part of its appeal. In 2008, Levi Buchanan of &quot;IGN&quot; listed &quot;Marble Madness&quot; as one of several titles in his &quot;dream arcade&quot;, citing the game&#x27;s difficulty and the fond memories he had playing it. Author John Sellers wrote that difficulty was a major reason that players were attracted. Other engaging factors included the graphics, visual design and the soundtrack. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;″s Craig Grannell, in referring to the game as one of the most distinctive arcade games ever made, praised its visuals as &quot;pure and timeless&quot;. In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; rated the game ninety-ninth on its &quot;Top 100 Video Games&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked the arcade version of &quot;Marble Madness&quot; as 15 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;. In 1997 &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; listed it as the 10th best arcade game of all time. In 2003, &quot;Marble Madness&quot; was inducted into &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s list of the greatest games of all time. In 2008, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; listed it as the number seventy-nine arcade game in technical, creative and cultural impact. &quot;Marble Madness&quot; was one of the first games to use true stereo sound and have a recognizable musical score. British composer Paul Weir commented that the music had character and helped give the game a unique identity. A common complaint about the arcade cabinet was that the track ball controls frequently broke from repeated use.

===Home versions===
The different ports were met with mixed reception. John Harris of &quot;Gamasutra&quot; thought the arcade&#x27;s popularity fueled the sales of the home versions, while Thomas Hanley of ScrewAttack commented that most versions were not as enjoyable without a track ball. Grannell echoed similar statements about the controls and added that many had poor visuals and collision detection. He listed the Amiga, Game Boy and Sega Genesis ports as the better conversions, and the ZX Spectrum, IBM PC compatibles and Game Boy Advance versions among the worst. &quot;MegaTech&quot; reviewers rated the Sega Genesis release favorably. &quot;Next Generation&quot; staff also liked the Sega Genesis version, but noted that the experience is better when playing with the original trackball controls.

&quot;Compute!&quot; writers called the Amiga version&#x27;s graphics and gameplay &quot;arcade-quality&quot;. Reviewing for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, Roy Wagner stated that the Amiga version was superior to the arcade original. Bruce Webster of &quot;BYTE&quot; wrote that the graphics of the Amiga version of &quot;Marble Madness&quot; in December 1986 &quot;are really amazing&quot;. While criticizing the lack of a pause function or a top scores list, he said that it &quot;is definitely worth having if you own an Amiga&quot;. Bil Herd recalled that the Amiga version was so popular at Commodore International that employees stole the required memory expansion from colleagues&#x27; computers to run the game. Benn Dunnington of &quot;Info&quot; gave the Amiga version four-plus stars out of five, describing it as &quot;a totally faithful adaptation&quot;, and hoped that a sequel was in development. The magazine staff rated the Commodore 64 version a three-plus stars out of five, describing it as &quot;just a shadow of the arcade original and the excellent Amiga version&quot; and inferior to &quot;Spindizzy&quot;. The magazine liked the graphics but criticized &quot;marbles that handle like intoxicated turtles&quot;. &quot;Dragon&quot;″s three reviewers—Hartley, Patricia and Kirk Lesser—praised the Apple II port, calling it a &quot;must have&quot; title for arcade fans. It received a &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; Megagame award.

==Legacy==
&quot;Marble Madness&quot; inspired other games that involve navigating a ball through progressively more difficult courses. Melbourne House&#x27;s &quot;Gyroscope&quot; and Electric Dreams Software&#x27;s &quot;Spindizzy&quot; were the first such games; both met with a good reception. In 1990, Rare released &quot;Snake Rattle &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, which incorporated elements similar to &quot;Marble Madness&quot;. The &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; series uses similar gameplay based on rolling a ball, but adds other features such as minigames and monkey characters.

===Unreleased sequel===
An arcade sequel titled &quot;Marble Man: Marble Madness II&quot; was planned for release in 1991, though Cerny was not involved in its development. Development was led by Bob Flanagan who designed the game based on what he felt made &quot;Marble Madness&quot; a success in the home console market. Because the market&#x27;s demographic was a younger audience, Flanagan wanted to make the sequel more accessible and introduced a superhero-type main character. &quot;Marble Man&quot; expanded on the gameplay of the original game with new abilities for the marble such as invisibility and flight, added pinball minigames between sets of levels, and allowed up to three players to traverse isometric courses. Flanagan intended to address the short length of the first game and, with the help of Mike Hally, developed seventeen courses.

Atari created prototypes for location testing, but the game did not fare well against more popular titles at the time such as &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;. Atari assumed the trackballs accounted for the poor reception and commissioned a second model with joystick controls. Because the new models were met with the same poor reception, production was halted and the focus shifted to &quot;Guardians of the &#x27;Hood&quot;, a beat &#x27;em up game. Arcade system boards for the sequel were rumored to have been destroyed to clear inventory for tax purposes in 1996, but Cerny has called the destruction an urban legend, indicating that at most 12 prototypes&#x27; boards were produced. These prototypes have since become collector items. In 2022, a prototype of the joystick-controlled version of &quot;Marble Madness II&quot; was leaked online.

<text>Linkebeek (, ) is a Belgian municipality in the Halle-Vilvoorde district (&quot;arrondissement&quot;) of the province of Flemish Brabant. The municipality only comprises the town of Linkebeek proper. On 1 January 2006, Linkebeek had a total population of 4,759. The total area is , which gives a population density of . It directly borders the Brussels-Capital Region and is part of the city&#x27;s urban sprawl, contiguous with Moensburg (Uccle) – it was a component of the short-lived Arrondissement of Brussels-Periphery.

== Language and politics ==
The official language is Dutch with French facilities. In 1954, these special linguistic rights or &quot;facilities&quot; were given to Francophones, who then constituted nearly 40% of the population according to the 1947 census. Nowadays, Francophones make up the majority of the population.
Francophones can request official documents from the local administration in French, but the official language remains Dutch. There are also primary and nursery schools teaching in French.

Since the 2012 municipal elections, the municipal council consists of 13 French-speaking councillors, led by Damien Thiéry (MR), and two Dutch-speaking councillors (elected under &quot;ProLink&quot;).

Damien Thiéry (MR) was the acting mayor from 2007 to 2015. He was never appointed mayor by the Flemish government for having violated language law, as confirmed by multiple Council of State rulings. The French-speaking majority refused to propose anyone else as mayor. In October 2015 the Flemish minister Liesbeth Homans (N-VA) appointed Eric De Bruycker (ProLink) as mayor. This caused controversy, and the French-speaking majority in the municipal council demanded his resignation. When De Bruycker refused, the 13 French-speaking councillors resigned to provoke a snap election. An election was then scheduled for 13 December to elect 13 councillors; the mayor and the other Flemish councillor both remain in office. A few days later, mayor De Bruycker submitted his resignation. If accepted by Flemish minister Liesbeth Homans, he will remain as acting mayor. Prolink, the Flemish party of De Bruycker, decided not to participate in the election and called on voters to vote blank.

The 13 December 2015 snap election resulted in the status quo: the French-speaking list won all 13 seats. However, about 15% did not vote (despite its being compulsory) and about 13% voted blank.

<text>Merchtem () is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Flemish Brabant. The municipality comprises the villages of Brussegem and Hamme, the hamlets of Ossel and Peizegem, and Merchtem proper. On July 9, 2009, Merchtem had a total population of 15,298. The total area is 36.72 km2 which gives a population density of 416 inhabitants per km2.

== Folklore ==

Merchtem is known for &#x27;de steltenlopers&#x27;, people walking on stilts (up to several meters above ground). Langevelde, a part of the municipality, was frequently flooded after heavy rain. In order to reach the centre, people were using sticks to walk.
After an internal struggle, the group split up in two parts, &#x27;stichting Langevelde&#x27; and &#x27;stichting Jan Vaderhasselt&#x27;.

==Language controversy==
On August 28, 2006 mayor Eddie de Block introduced a ban on speaking French in the town&#x27;s schools. Mayor de Block said that the measure did not violate human rights and that it would help integration. A previous ban on signs in languages different from Dutch in the town&#x27;s markets had been overturned by Flemish Interior Minister Marino Keulen.

<text>Sint-Genesius-Rode (; ) is a municipality in the province of Flemish Brabant, in the Flemish region of Belgium. The municipality only comprises the town of Sint-Genesius-Rode proper, and lies between Brussels and Waterloo in Wallonia. On January 1, 2008, Sint-Genesius-Rode had a total population of 18,021. The total area is , which gives a population density of . It borders the Brussels-Capital Region and is essentially a suburb of the city, contiguous with the Prince d&#x27;Orange neighbourhood (Uccle), and was a component of the short-lived Arrondissement of Brussels-Periphery. While the Brussels-Capital Region does not have a direct border with Wallonia, the shortest distance between the two is at Sint-Genesius-Rode municipality, with around separating Prince d&#x27;Orange and Waterloo along the N5 road.

== Politics ==
The official language of the city is Dutch, historically the majority language of the population. However, Sint-Genesius-Rode is in linguistic flux, as it is one of the most evenly divided between the two languages. There is no linguistic census in Belgium, but based on the support Francophone parties receive, the French-speaking population of Sint-Genesius-Rode is estimated to be about 64%.

As in several other municipalities on the periphery of Brussels, in the 1960s linguistic facilities were given to local French-speaking residents. These mostly stemmed from Francophone workers employed in the neighbouring Brussels migrating to the area. These &#x27;facilities&#x27; allow them the right to obtain and submit official documents from the local administration in French, as well as to conduct business with the authorities in the language of their choice. The regionalization of Belgium has maintained that compromise, though politicians representing French-speakers have interpreted these facilities as a permanent right for Francophones in the Brussels periphery. The Flemish viewpoint is that these facilities existed temporarily in order to assist those French-speakers who already had come to live there to help them integrate in the Flemish region and eventually learn the Dutch language.

Today, this particular municipality remains a controversial topic of local and national politics. On May 31, 2010, its city council voted a motion asking that it be reassigned from the Flemish Region to the Brussels Capital Region, in view of the majority of francophones residing there. A considerable number of Belgian French-speakers would like this to happen, thus creating a geographical link between Wallonia and Brussels. Francophone politicians propose this in exchange of the Flemish demand for the splitting of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde. The reassignment of the area is strongly opposed by most Flemish people, their politicians and their institutions, who argue that the borders of Belgium&#x27;s regions should not be changed simply because many people move from one region to another. They see the incorporation of the territory into the Brussels Capital Region as a threat to the language and cultural rights of Flemish residents, and that a precedent would be set that would invite further Francophone migration to other municipalities with facilities. They also view this tendency as the extension of an already prevalent Francophone influence on the capital region.

The current system of facilities was settled by Flemish politicians in 1963. A large majority of French speakers did not agree with this evolution. The previous system, also proposed by the Flemish politicians but accepted by the French speakers, relied on decennial census programs to adapt the limits of the linguistic regions. In 1930, the French speaking politicians strongly refused a Flemish proposal to make the whole Belgian territory fully bilingual, calling it unthinkable that French speaking officials would thus be supposed to learn Dutch.

Municipal elections have moved away from ideological contests to linguistic competitions. In 2018 the francophone list IC-GB won 69.3% of votes, defeating the Flemish-speaking unity list Engagement 1640 which won 30.7% of votes. No other parties participated.

<text>Sint-Pieters-Leeuw (; , ) is a municipality in the province of Flemish Brabant, in the Flemish region of Belgium.

The municipality comprises the towns of Oudenaken, Ruisbroek, Sint-Laureins-Berchem, Sint-Pieters-Leeuw proper and Vlezenbeek. Sint-Pieters-Leeuw is located just outside the Brussels-Capital Region, in the Payottenland. The municipality is a blend of parks, castles, meadows and gardens with the Coloma park as its green heart.

On 1 January 2018, Sint-Pieters-Leeuw had a total population of 34,025. The total area is , which gives a population density of . It is a mostly a residential community with largely preserved rural areas and some industrial zones. The official language of Sint-Pieters-Leeuw is Dutch.

==History==

The municipality is one of the largest municipalities in Flemish Brabant. The rural settlement grew into a major residential and professional community. Sint-Pieters-Leeuw has a lengthy history behind it.

The oldest document dates back to the 9th century and is a deed of donation by &#x27;dame Angela&#x27;, a noblewoman from Brabant, in which reference is made to a &#x27;domain&#x27; of seven miles in length and one mile in width with a parent church and 9 subsidiary churches&#x27;, donated to the chapter of Saint Peter in Deutz, Cologne.

From 1236 onwards the domain belonged to the Land of Gaasbeek. In 1284 Henry I, Duke of Brabant and lord of Gaasbeek, granted a copy of the local penal code to the populace, which led the municipality to long remain the principal seat of a &#x27;meierij&#x27; (Dutch for a district over which a mayor has jurisdiction) and a college of Aldermen.

In 1687 the fiefdom of Gaasbeek was publicly sold in various parts. By marriage or inheritance both the water castle of Coloma, currently the Municipal Cultural Centre, and the rights of the fiefdom as well as all manner of provisions (among others mills) became the possession of important nobles and courtiers such as Jan Karel Roose, member of the Great Council of Mechelen and Vital-Alex de Coloma, chamberlain of empress Maria-Theresia.

Since 1 January 1977 the former municipalities of Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Oudenaken, Ruisbroek, Sint-Laureins-Berchem and Vlezenbeek have been joined to form a new administrative residential community.

==Economy==

Neuhaus, an international exporter of fine Belgian chocolate, is based in Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, as well as Lindemans Brewery, a brewery that produces lambics, a distinctly Belgian type of beer.

Other companies with a headquarters or main plant in Sint-Pieters-Leeuw include Belle-Vue Brewery, Mercedes-Benz Truck Center, Vanden Borre, Printer Systems (Avery Dennison), a Material Plant and Reinforcement Steel Plant of Besix and DATS 24 (a subsidiary of Colruyt).

<text>Vilvoorde (; ; ; historically known as &quot;Filford&quot; in English) is a Belgian city and municipality in the Halle-Vilvoorde district (&quot;arrondissement&quot;) of the province of Flemish Brabant. The municipality comprises the city of Vilvoorde proper with its two outlying quarters of Koningslo and Houtem and the small town of Peutie.

The official language of Vilvoorde is Dutch, as in the rest of Flanders. There is a French-speaking minority of about 33.7%, concentrated especially in the Koningslo and Beauval quarters, bordering the Neder-Over-Heembeek neighbourhood of Brussels. The French-speaking minority is represented by 3 members on the 33-seat local council.

From 2000 until August 1, 2007, the mayor of Vilvoorde was former Belgian prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. The mayor since 2013 is Hans Bonte, also a member of the Federal House of Representatives.

==History==

===Origins===
The Nervii, and later the Romans, probably already settled in this strategic place near the river Zenne. The name &quot;Filfurdo&quot; was first mentioned in a 779 document whereby Pippin of Herstal ceded this territory to the Abbey of Chèvremont, near Liège. This name presumably derived from the word equivalents &quot;villa at the ford&quot; or river crossing.

===Middle Ages===
In the 12th century, a small town started to grow, which quickly became a target for the ambitions of the dukes of Brabant and lords of Grimbergen. Henry I, Duke of Brabant granted the city its charter of rights as soon as 1192, mainly to ensure the support of the inhabitants against powerful neighbouring Flanders. The rights to build defensive walls and to export its products gave Vilvoorde a great economic boost, driven mostly by the cloth industry. In the 14th century, thanks to its position on the Zenne, Vilvoorde became an important military centre and could compete against Leuven and Brussels for the title of most important city in Brabant.

===15th–18th centuries===
From the 15th to the 18th century, however, Vilvoorde suffered a prolonged decline, mainly because of the competition from Brussels, a general malaise in the textile industry, and the result of epidemics and wars, both political and religious.

The translator of the Bible into English, William Tyndale, was executed here in October 1536. In 1597 Anna Utenhoven, an Anabaptist accused of heresy, was buried alive in Vilvoorde – the last of the Protestants suffering martyrdom for their faith in the history of the Habsburg Netherlands. Anthony van Stralen, Lord of Merksem and Jan van Casembroot were also both executed in Vilvoorde.

===19th century and beyond===
The advent of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century was a godsend to Vilvoorde, which could quickly capitalize on its proximity to Brussels and its good transportation infrastructure: the deepening of the canals around 1830 and the advent of the railways in 1835. Soon, the medieval buildings gave way to newer and better constructions. The 1489 city hall was replaced by the neoclassical building we see today.

In the 1920s, the canal was broadened and deepened again, lined with new industrial zones, and an inland port was built to receive the freightliners. Following its liberation by the British in 1944, Vilvoorde was administered by a joint British and Belgian municipality, with temporary British and Belgian Mayors, Lt Col (then Major) JME Howarth Esq and (Later Prof.) Robert Senelle, before transferring back to a civilian administration. 

Vilvoorde became (and still is) one of the largest industrial areas around Brussels, with a population that grew to five times what it was 150 years earlier. The recent economic crises have hit the city hard, especially when Renault closed its doors in 1997. The service industry is now taking the lead in 21st-century Vilvoorde.

*Vilvoorde also has its fair share of parks, such as the &quot;Hanssenspark&quot; with English gardens and the &quot;Domein Drie Fonteinen&quot; (the &quot;Domain of the Three Fountains&quot;), which boasts both English and French gardens.

Although outside the Brussels-Capital Region, Wemmel is sometimes considered part of the suburbs of Brussels – it directly borders the city municipality of Jette and the neighbourhood of Laeken, and was a component of the short-lived Arrondissement of Brussels-Periphery. The Brussels orbital motorway, known as the &quot;ring&quot;, cuts through the southern part of the town.

==History==
The centre of Wemmel initially developed around the Sint-Servaaskerk (), because the ground there was best suited for building. Around the year 370, Frankish invaders drove out the ruling Romans, who had settled the area around the 2nd century AD. Wemmel eventually became part of the Duchy of Brabant.

One of the first lords of Wemmel of which there is a historical record was marshal Goswinus van Wembelne, who lived at the beginning of the 12th century. His descendants would be the lords of Wemmel until the end of the 12th century, when Isabella van Wembelne married Aernout II of Kraainem, and Wemmel became part of the already considerable possessions of Kraainem. Many notable men would come from this noble family, including Aernout III, who would die fighting on the French king&#x27;s side at the Battle of the Golden Spurs. His son Leo was a skillful diplomat, who would sign the 1366 treaty that resolved a dispute between the County of Flanders and the Duchy of Brabant over the Lordship of Mechelen.

In 1838 all family belongings in Wemmel were sold to count Willem Bernard de Limburg-Stirum, who had become the mayor. Two of his daughters inhabited the castle until 1926. Their heirs then donated the castle to the municipality, since then it has served as the town hall. The castle was entirely renovated in 1992–1993.

== Marquess of Wemmel ==
Leo&#x27;s granddaughter married Gyselbrecht Taye, the lord of Elewijt, and Wemmel once again came under a different lord, this time belonging to the well known Coudenbergh family from Brussels. This family would govern the heerlijkheid as it was raised in status first to a barony and later to a margravate, only losing power in 1792 as France invaded the Low Countries as part of the French Revolutionary Wars.

Through the marriage between Marie Josepha Taye 6th Marquess of Assche, 3rd Marquess of Wemmel and count Jan-Antoon Van der Noot, the House of vander Noot inherited all the power and castles. Members of his family would play an important role in the Brabantian Revolution.

In 1838, all the ruling family&#x27;s possessions in Wemmel were sold to William Bernard of Limburg-Stirum, who then became mayor. Two of his daughters would continue to live in Wemmel Castle at the centre of the town until 1926. Their heirs donated the chateau to the municipality, and it has served as the municipality&#x27;s town hall ever since.

==Language situation==
The official language is Dutch, as everywhere in Flanders. In 1954, however, special linguistic &quot;facilities&quot; were given to local French-speakers (according to an official census, they were more than 30% in 1947). They can request official documents from the local administration in French. Since Wemmel is part of the bilingual judicial and electoral district of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde, French can be used before the courts. Some primary and maternity schools also teach in French.

<doc id="157582" wikidata="Q912091" url="?curid=157582" title="Wezembeek-Oppem">
<text>Wezembeek-Oppem () is a municipality in the province of Flemish Brabant, in the Flemish region of Belgium, east of the centre of Brussels. The municipality only comprises the town of Wezembeek-Oppem proper. On January 1, 2016, Wezembeek-Oppem had a total population of 14,095. The total area is , which gives a population density of . It is essentially a suburb of Brussels and was a component of the short-lived Arrondissement of Brussels-Periphery, although it does not directly adjoin any part of the Brussels-Capital Region. The Brussels Ring (R0) orbital motorway bisects the municipality.

Wezembeek-Oppem is home to a large community of international expatriates, in part because of the presence of the Internationale Deutsche Schule Brüssel (iDSB) in Wezembeek-Oppem itself, and the British School of Brussels in nearby Tervuren.

==Languages==

Wezembeek-Oppem is one of the six municipalities with language facilities in the Flemish Region surrounding the Brussels-Capital Region. Wezembeek-Oppem is the only one of these that does not border Brussels directly since a narrow strip of land belonging to the neughbouring municipality of Kraainem lies in between the closest city boundary at Stockel (Woluwe-Saint-Pierre).

When the last official language census was taken in 1947, just under 30% of the population in Wezembeek-Oppem had French as their mother tongue. In 1963, when the official language border was finalised in Belgium, the municipality was designed as officially Dutch-speaking, however with facilities for French-speakers. In 1993, when Belgium was turned into a federation, the municipality was included in the newly established Flemish Region.

The official language is Dutch (as everywhere in Flanders), but the facility status means citizens have the right to request official documents from the local administration in French, may get primary school education in French as well as certain other public services.
== Orphanage in World War II==
During the Nazi German occupation in the Second World War, Wezembeek was the home of an orphanage set up by the (AJB), a &quot;Judenrat&quot;-like authority forcibly organised by the German occupational force and collaborating with the Nazis. The orphanage was for Jewish children whose parents had been murdered in Nazi extermination camps. From August 1944, the AJB, under hard pressure of the &quot;Comité de Défense des Juifs&quot;, decided to hide the children until the end of the occupation. The children were dispersed to Catholic schools, orphanages and other locations. During the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 and January 1945, the children survived bombardment by American and British forces while in the basements of homes, schools and orphanages which were occupied by Nazi troops resisting the Allied forces. Children who were at the orphanage and survived include Regina Feld Glinzman (born 1935 as Rosa Feld in Antwerp) and Estelle Alter (born 1936 as Stella Feld in Antwerp).

== Education ==

The International German School of Brussels is located in the municipality. The Heilig Hart College is a school situated in Wezembeek-Oppem.

<text>Zaventem () is a municipality in the province of Flemish Brabant, in the Flemish region of Belgium. It is located in the Dijleland area, one of the three large recreational areas which together form the &quot;Groene Gordel&quot; (&quot;Green Belt&quot;) around the Brussels-Capital Region. The municipality comprises the subdivisions or deelgemeenten of Nossegem, Sint-Stevens-Woluwe, Sterrebeek and Zaventem proper. The municipality is a suburb of Brussels, and Sint-Stevens-Woluwe directly borders the city, specifically the Woluwe-Saint-Lambert municipality.

On 1 January 2006, Zaventem had a total population of 28,651. The total area is , which gives a population density of . The official language of Zaventem is Dutch, as in the rest of Flanders. Zaventem is the home of Brussels Airport, together with neighbouring town of Diegem.

== Etymology ==
The old spelling of the municipality&#x27;s name is Saventhem, but the oldest notation of Zaventem is &quot;Saventa&quot;, which dates from records in 1117. There are several hypotheses on the meaning of the name. One of them refers to the seven pools or small ponds that existed in the area during medieval times. Another one refers to small ponds in a sandy environment (sabulous clay). Others interpret the name Zaventem as a reconfiguration of &quot;zeven tommen&quot; (meaning &quot;seven (Gallo-Roman) tumuli&quot; or &quot;burial mounds&quot;) or &quot;zaaivelden&quot; (meaning &quot;field for sowing&quot;).

== History ==
The earliest history of Zaventem goes back to the neolithic and the Roman era. From burial remains it has become clear that the area also was inhabited during the times of the Frankish Empire and the Merovingian dynasty. Zaventem was part of the County of Ukkel and the County of Leuven successively before it was added to the Duchy of Brabant. Around the tenth century, Zaventem was owned by the Abbey of Nivelles. The village center arose at the crossing of two important roads between Vilvoorde and Tervuren, and between Brussels and Erps, with the church at the center of this growing village. The parish was established before the ninth century but the church, which was named after the patron saint Saint Martin, came to be owned by the Abbey of Nivelles at the end of the ninth century. In 1147 the right of ownership was transferred to the Diocese of Cambrai. The parish remained dependent on this diocese until 1559 after which the Archdiocese of Mechelen took it over.

=== Lords of Saventhem ===

From 1112 to 1122, the vassal of Lambertus de Craynhem, the Lord of Saventhem, was called Ricardus de Saventen. It has been thought that &quot;de Saventen&quot; was a local noble family that coexisted with the noble family of the &quot;de Craynhem&quot; overlords. At that time, Forest Abbey and the Abbey of Kortenberg were important landowners. The feudal heerlijkheid of Zaventem then came to be owned by the knight Hendrik van der Meeren only after it was owned by another noble family. In 1381, he was officially recognised as the Lord of Saventhem and his family continued to own it until 1605. They possessed a castle close to the parish church but this was broken down during the second half of the 1920s.
In 1605, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Brabant, Ferdinand van Boisschot (1560–1649) became the Lord of Zaventem, and when he was made a baron in 1621, Zaventem became a barony which subsequently expanded with the villages Nossegem, Sterrebeek and Sint-Stevens-Woluwe. The de Boisschot family remained the proprietor until the French Revolution.

Originally, there was a large forest northwest of Zaventem called &quot;Saventerlo&quot; where the Dukes of Brabant used to go hunting. The area was largely deforested in the 17th century. Nevertheless, Zaventem remained predominantly agricultural during the most part of the nineteenth century but its industrial activities go at least back to the 13th century. During this time, various water mills were installed on the Woluwe River that were later converted to paper mills. Initially, the river had many bends along its path in Zaventem which made the supply of energy from the water power rather difficult. In 1208, Godfrey, Duke of Brabant gave orders to alter and elevate the pathway of the Woluwe River so that the watermills would be supplied with a sufficient amount of water. This greatly benefited the paper industry later on in the 18th and 19th century.
From the 18th century however, Zaventem gradually changes from an agricultural community to an industrial community. Especially the construction of the road between Leuven and Brussels from 1705 to 1710, contributed to this evolution. From 1850, the development of steam engines even intensified the process of industrialisation, having a negative effect on agricultural activities. Gradually, the large leasehold estates of farmland were replaced in the 19th century by houses of labourers. In 1866, the railway track between Brussels and Leuven, as a sign of the industrial era, was inaugurated splitting Zaventem into two parts. In addition to the paper industry, industrial activity also started to revolve around the tanning of leather in the late 19th century. At the start of the 20th century, the car manufacturer Excelsior, that would become world-renowned later on, produced some of its cars in a factory in Zaventem. All these industrial initiatives prompted the building of various small castles and grand villas in the municipality for the executive directors of the companies such as the Feldheim Villa of the wealthy eponymous family that was involved in the tanning industry. After World War II, however, many of the factories were forced to close, unable to keep up with foreign competition.

With the building of Brussels Airport at the occasion of Brussels World&#x27;s Fair in 1958, the features of Zaventem&#x27;s landscape have been altered drastically. The location used to be the place of the large Saventerlo Forest. Nevertheless, the airport gave a tremendous boost to local employment that benefited Zaventem greatly. Added to that the strong growth of semi-industrial companies during the 1960s and 1970s Zaventem became an important economic hub.

==2016 Brussels bombings==
During the 2016 Brussels bombings, two explosions took place in Brussels Airport, Zaventem, 22 March 2016 at 07:58 local time. One near the American Airlines and Brussels Airlines check-in desks and one next to a Starbucks coffee shop. A third bomb was found in the airport and was detonated by a controlled explosion. The airport was to remain closed until 24 March but was extended till 28 March. Flights bound to Brussels Airport were either canceled or diverted to nearby airports such as Brussels South Charleroi Airport, Ostend–Bruges International Airport, and Schiphol. At 09:11 CET an explosion took place at Maelbeek/Maalbeek metro station. ISIL claimed responsibility for the attacks as an act of revenge against Belgium for participation in the ongoing Military intervention against ISIL.

== Places of interest ==

=== Church of Saint Martin and Anthony van Dyck&#x27;s masterpiece ===

The , named after Saint Martin of Tours, was built in 1567 and has been a protected monument since 1938. Originally, the church was a typical basilical church in Romanesque architecture with three naves, an eastern tower and an apse. In the 16th century, the church was converted into a Gothic building and further enlarged in the 19th century. It contains a 1618 painting of &quot;Saint Martin Dividing his Cloak&quot;, which was installed in 1621.

=== De Veste Museum of Local History ===
The museum exhibits objects that are mainly loaned from a society for local history. They are primarily old objects that were used in the past, such as weighing instruments, threshing and transport material, archival pieces regarding local societies, municipal governments and economic activities. In addition, there are artefacts that were used for farming purposes and folkloric instruments of craftsmen and other professions. Furthermore, there are also artefacts relating to the monarchy, the church life, the world wars and historiographical accounts and flags of Zaventem. Outside large agricultural instruments are exhibited like ploughs, and harvesting machines to grub up chicory. The building of the museum was erected in 1957 as a storage place in the architectural style of a 17th-century house to refer to the houses that used to be in the area during that century. In 1977, the building was fully restored and converted into the local history museum.

=== Mariadal Castle ===
The Mariadal Castle in the municipal park was built at the end of the 19th century by the archeologist Baron Emile de Munck. It contains two building layers and seven bays, one of which being occupied by the round tower. The roof has several dormers. The building has been used for different purposes such as a public secondary school, horeca businesses, and the offices of the Public Centre for Social Welfare. In 1988 the complex was renovated and reopened as a cultural community center. The location of the castle used to be the place where the 17th century homestead &quot;Hof van Ophem&quot; stood (and still partially exists). On the terrain used to be a homestead that functioned as a fief of the Duke of Brabant. It depended on the old &quot;ter Meeren&quot; Castle of the eponymous Lords of Zaventem. Because of various hereditary separations, the homestead went its own way and was sold to noblemen from Brussels in the 16th century. The domain was reunited in the 17th century.

=== House of the Seven Knights ===
The House of the Seven Knights (&quot;Huis der Zeven Ridders&quot;) is a building from the 17th century and was the property of the du Bois or vanden Bossche family. It therefore was called the vanden Bossche House (Huize vanden Bossche) and unrightfully the House of the Seven Knights. In 1312, the ruling vander Meerens family from Sterrebeek acquired a fief homestead called &quot;The Seven Fiefs of Wezembeek&quot; that were sold to Ferdinand van Boisschot in the 17th century. In several charters there is a mentioning of the &quot;Seven Hereditary Lords of Zaventem&quot; and the &quot;Sevenantship of Wesembeeck&quot; (Seventnantschap van Wesembeeck) who decided on important decisions so they possibly controlled the homestead at some point. It is wrong, however, that the vanden Bossche House is called the House of the Seven Knights considering that the former is a mansion from the 17th century. Because of their multitude of properties the vanden Bossche family was highly regarded amongst the people, which may explain the confusion.

=== Stockmans Mill ===

The &quot;Stockmans Mill&quot; (Stockmansmolen) is the only watermill that is left in Zaventem. Its history goes back to the 13th century when during the time of Henry III, Duke of Brabant the mill was mentioned in an official document of 1249. Around 1450, this mill company belonged to the van der Beke family, which is why it was called the &quot;ter Beke Mill&quot;, at that time adjacent to the &quot;ter Beke Court&quot;. The court and the mill were separated in the 16th and 17th century due to a series of inheritances and sales. From 1675 until the beginning of the 19th century, the mill remained the property of the highly esteemed vanden Bossche family. In 1807 the mill was sold to Karel de Velder. When during the Belgian Revolution of 1830, Dutch troops were stationed in the fields along the Woluwe River between Zaventem and Sint-Stevens-Woluwe, miller Karel de Velder stopped the water from flowing through in order to flood the fields and the Dutch would retreat. The mill subsequently became the property of the Stockmans family after Karel de Velder&#x27;s granddaughter married Jan Philippe Stockmans, hence the name &quot;Stockmans Mill&quot;. The watermill was used to grind the grains, and later it was also used as a paper mill. Watermills contributed greatly to the early industrialisation of the area. It remained functioning until the mid-20th century but its condition decreased gravely. A private owner bought it and renovated it in the end of the 1980s to convert it into a restaurant and tavern. Stockmansmolen is now a popular burger restaurant.

== Infrastructure ==

The airport is located in the province of Flemish Brabant on the municipal territory of Zaventem, Machelen and Steenokkerzeel, and it is run by the &quot;Brussels Airport Company&quot;, previously known by the abbreviation BIAC. The Belgian capital Brussels is at a distance of and it is easily accessible both by car and by public transport, including train, bus and taxi. You can take the train and hop off directly at the airport or park your car in a nearby parking facility. The airport is easily accesibel by train from various cities. Not only from Belgian cities, but also from international cities like Paris or Amsterdam.

=== History ===

The home of the national airport originates in the municipality of Evere. During the First World War, the German occupier started building an &#x27;airfield&#x27; there because of the proximity of Brussels, the connection to the road to Haacht and the flat terrain. After the war, however, the airfield came into the hands of the Belgian air force.

At the end of the 1930s, the Belgian Ministry of Defence purchased land in Melsbroek to build a new airfield. Shortly after, the Second World War broke loose during which the Germans set up an airport in Melsbroek during the occupation.

Only starting the 1950s, Zaventem was chosen by the Belgian government as the location for a national airport. Even Melsbroek was too small, especially taking the number of visitors of Brussels World&#x27;s Fair of 1958 into account. The Melsbroek premises were now made available to the air force.

The buildings of the Zaventem airport were designed in 1956-1958 by Maxime Brunfaut, Georges Bontinck and Jos Moutschen. It was initially estimated that it should have a maximum capacity of 6 million passengers per year. The 1950s were characterised by an uncurbed belief in technological progress. This was translated into the architecture by using such materials as aluminium, concrete, steel, and glass. The transit hall was intended as a striking feature with a space of a 100m long, 55m wide and 18m high, covered with a curved roof structure out of aluminium. Over the years, expansions and adjustments were made, leading to the loss of much of the original design. In 1994, Pier B was put into use so that 21 million passengers could be handled annually. Pier A was opened in 2002 to ensure a better flow and increased passenger comfort, processing another 25 million passengers annually.

==Education==
Schools in Zaventem include Gemeentelijke (community) as well as catholic primary and secondary schools, and Gemeentelijke Academie voor Muziek, Woord en Dans. Brussels American School (A United States Department of Defense Education Activity school for dependents of United States Department of Defense personnel assigned to NATO) is in Sterrebeek.

<text>Gavin McGregor Rossdale (born 30 October 1965) is an English musician, best known as the lead singer and rhythm guitarist of the rock band Bush. He helped form Bush in 1992; on the band&#x27;s separation in 2002, he became the lead singer and guitarist for Institute and later began a solo career. He resumed his role in Bush when the band reunited in 2010. In 2013, he received the British Academy&#x27;s Ivor Novello Award for International Achievement.
==Early life==
Rossdale was born in Marylebone, London, England, the son of Barbara Stephan (&quot;née&quot; Bowie) and Douglas Rossdale, a doctor. His mother was born in Scotland, whereas his father was of Russian Jewish descent, the family&#x27;s surname originally being Rosenthal. Rossdale was unable to speak until the age of four, and his parents divorced when he was 11 years old. At around this time, Rossdale became interested in the then-current 1970s British punk rock phenomenon through his elder sister, Lorraine; Rossdale said in 1999: &quot;everything I learned was from trying to hang out with [Lorraine&#x27;s] friends. I was 12 when [punk] happened. At the top of our road was this record shop and I was always going in and getting one single at a time. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve got X-Ray Spex and the Buzzcocks, practically the first edition of everything.&quot; The Sex Pistols were also an influence on Rossdale at the time, with Rossdale telling &quot;American Songwriter&quot; in 2021 that they &quot;changed his life&quot; and that he &quot;fell in love&quot; with them &quot;when I was 11 or 12 years old&quot;, having seen them &quot;swearing at Bill Grundy on the TV.&quot;

Beginning in 1979, Rossdale was educated at the independent Westminster School. Rossdale disliked his time at the school, as he was the target of bullying.

==Music career==
===Before Bush===
During the 1980s, Rossdale formed a pop band called Midnight with Sacha Puttnam. Despite touring as far afield as Ireland and enjoying support slots for artists including Big Country and Cyndi Lauper, his band saw little success after releasing two singles.

Rossdale later became a member of the group The Little Dukes. According to Alex Tate, the Little Dukes&#x27; music was contrary to Rossdale&#x27;s musical preferences at the time. After travelling to Los Angeles and New York City with the hope of being signed to a record label, and crossing paths with a future Bush manager, the band broke up in autumn 1991.

===Bush===

In 1992, Rossdale established the grunge band Bush, initially known as Future Primitive, as its vocalist and rhythm guitarist after first befriending lead guitarist Nigel Pulsford in November 1991. Their debut album, &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot; (1994), was a huge commercial success.

Bush&#x27;s follow-up albums include &quot;Razorblade Suitcase&quot;, &quot;Deconstructed&quot;, &quot;The Science of Things&quot;, and &quot;Golden State&quot;. Each had commercial success, making Bush one of the best-selling rock groups of the 1990s. Although the band reached superstar status in the US, they failed to have much impact in the UK. The main exception to this was the UK chart success of the album &quot;Razorblade Suitcase&quot; (number 4) and its single &quot;Swallowed&quot; (number 7). A change in record labels and management did not bode well for the band, who disbanded in 2002.

On 21 June 2010, it was announced that Bush would return and planned to release a new album. &quot;The Sea of Memories&quot; was released on 13 September 2011. Bush have since released four more albums: &quot;Man on the Run&quot; in 2014, &quot;Black and White Rainbows&quot; in 2017, &quot;The Kingdom&quot; in 2020, and &quot;The Art of Survival&quot; in 2022.

===Other projects===
Rossdale performed a song entitled &quot;Adrenaline&quot; for the soundtrack of the film &quot;XXX&quot;, which features it during the end credits. This song was also the official theme song for WWE&#x27;s &quot;Unforgiven&quot; pay-per-view event in September 2002 and also was The Undertaker&#x27;s Desire/Tribute theme of that same year. He also guest appeared for Blue Man Group&#x27;s &quot;The Current&quot; and is featured in its video. This song was used in the ending credits of &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot;.

In 2004, after Bush had been on hiatus for two years, Rossdale formed Institute. Their album, &quot;Distort Yourself&quot;, released on 13 September 2005 achieved moderate success and the single &quot;Bullet Proof Skin&quot; was used in the motion picture &quot;Stealth&quot;. In an interview published in November 2008, Rossdale noted that the Institute record was, &quot;for all intents and purposes, a solo record. It was just a bad marketing decision to call it something else&quot;. Institute broke up in 2006, after one album.
Rossdale&#x27;s single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the World&quot;, was the introduction theme to Fox&#x27;s programme, &quot;Drive&quot;. In 2007, he covered John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Mind Games&quot; for the album &quot;Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur&quot;. Rossdale&#x27;s first solo record, entitled &quot;Wanderlust&quot;, was released 3 June 2008. Gwen Stefani, Rossdale&#x27;s then-wife, sang background vocals on the track &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop The World&quot;, with other vocalists on the album including Shirley Manson, Katy Perry and Dave Stewart. Bush and Institute guitarist Chris Traynor also played on the album. He also made a guest appearance on the DT8 Project album &quot;Perfect World&quot;, taking lead vocals and co-writing the track &quot;Falling&quot;.

On 1 April 2008 the first single from &quot;WANDERlust&quot;, &quot;Love Remains The Same&quot;, was released through digital retailers. It entered the Billboard Hot 100 at Number 76, rising to 27 in October 2008, giving Rossdale his first Top 40 hit since the days when he fronted the post-grunge band Bush. Rossdale mounted a full-scale solo tour in Spring 2009. Of the album&#x27;s title, Rossdale said, &quot;I just liked it because it&#x27;s kind of sexy enough, it&#x27;s powerful, it&#x27;s one word. Wanderlust sums up that desire for music and for singing and performing and this life.&quot;

Rossdale also provides the vocals for the Apocalyptica song &quot;End of Me&quot;, which is the lead single from their 2010 album &quot;7th Symphony&quot;.

Rossdale was a judge for the 10th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists&#x27; careers. In 2013, Rossdale was awarded in the Ivor Novello Awards, for International Achievement in Songwriting, which was presented to him by Chris Martin. On 27 October 2017, Rossdale sang with Linkin Park at their special memorial concert in memory of vocalist Chester Bennington. He performed the song &quot;Leave Out All the Rest&quot;.

==Acting career==
Rossdale appeared in the film &quot;Constantine&quot; (2005) playing the half-demon Balthazar. He has also appeared in the films &quot;Zoolander&quot; (2001), &quot;Mayor of the Sunset Strip&quot; (2004), &quot;Little Black Book&quot; (2004), &quot;the Game of Their Lives&quot; (2005), &quot;How to Rob a Bank&quot; (2007), and &quot;The Bling Ring&quot; (2013). Additionally, he appeared in the crime drama television series &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; in the episode &quot;The Performer&quot; (2009), portraying a rock star named Paul Davies who takes a vampire-like alter-ego named Dante whose music is involved in a string of exsanguination murders. Rossdale has also appeared in the eighth episode of season 5 of &quot;Burn Notice&quot;, and appeared as villain Johnny Moreau in the 100th episode of &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; in November 2014. In 2021, he starred alongside Bella Thorne in the thriller film &quot;Habit&quot;.

==Personal life==

In the late 1980s, Rossdale dated Suze DeMarchi, lead singer for the Australian band Baby Animals. Bush&#x27;s song &quot;Comedown&quot; from 1994&#x27;s &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot; is about their relationship.

In 1995, Rossdale met Gwen Stefani, lead singer of the rock band No Doubt, when Bush and No Doubt were on tour together. During a break in his relationship with Stefani, Rossdale dated Hole frontwoman and Kurt Cobain&#x27;s widow Courtney Love for eight months in 1995 and 1996. Love commented, &quot;Everyone gave me so much shit, because Gavin sounded a lot like Kurt.&quot; Rossdale then married Stefani in 2002. The two have three sons together: born in May 2006, August 2008, and February 2014. On 3 August 2015, Stefani filed for divorce from Rossdale due to adultery on his part. The divorce was finalized in April 2016. From 2017 until 2018 Rossdale was in a relationship with German model Sophia Thomalla.

In his 1995 autobiography &quot;Take It Like a Man&quot;, Boy George wrote that Rossdale had a relationship with Peter Robinson, also known as Marilyn, in the 1980s. In a 1996 interview for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Rossdale responded, &quot;That&#x27;s George&#x27;s take – he doesn&#x27;t know me. There&#x27;s a queue of people going to their lawyers about stuff in his book..I hope he manages to sell some books by putting my name in there.&quot; Elsewhere, both Rossdale and Robinson initially denied the story; however, in 2003, Robinson dedicated the Marilyn single &quot;Hold on Tight&quot; to Rossdale, citing &quot;the years of [their] passionate relationship&quot; and featuring a photo of him and Rossdale on the cover. Later, both men spoke more candidly about their past relationship. In 2009, Robinson confirmed that he and Rossdale had been &quot;together [for] five years&quot; in the 1980s. In 2010 Rossdale acknowledged having a liaison with Robinson, describing it as experimentation and &quot;part of growing up&quot;. Robinson later called Rossdale &quot;the love of my life&quot;.

In 2004, a paternity test revealed that Rossdale was the father of Pearl Lowe&#x27;s daughter, Daisy Lowe (born 1989). Rossdale and Pearl had a brief relationship, and Rossdale had been Daisy&#x27;s godfather. Rossdale subsequently cut off all contact with Pearl and Daisy. In 2009, however, several websites published photos of Daisy walking with Rossdale&#x27;s son in London. Both Daisy and Rossdale said in 2010 that their relationship is good and based on respect.
