<text>Mewtwo (; Japanese: , Hepburn: ) is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak&#x27;s &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise. It was first introduced in the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, and later appeared in subsequent sequels and spin-off titles, such as &quot;Pokkén Tournament&quot; and Detective Pikachu. In the video games, the player can fight and capture Mewtwo in order to subsequently pit it against other Pokémon. The player can first learn of Mewtwo late in &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; by reading research documents left in a ruined laboratory on Cinnabar Island where Mewtwo has escaped. Mewtwo is regarded as one of the series&#x27; strongest Pokémon, often referred to as &quot;the world&#x27;s strongest Pokémon&quot; in various media, and was the strongest in the original games in terms of base statistic distribution. It is known as the &quot;Genetic Pokémon&quot; and is a Legendary Pokémon, a special group of Pokémon that are very rare and usually very powerful. &lt;onlyinclude&gt; Mewtwo has also appeared in various animated adaptations of the franchise.

Masachika Ichimura was the first to voice the original Mewtwo character in Japanese, and the creature&#x27;s younger self is voiced by Fujiko Takimoto in the &quot;Sound Picture Box: Mewtwo&#x27;s Origin&quot; CD drama and Showtaro Morikubo in the anime adaptation.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt; In English, Jay Goede voiced Mewtwo in &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie&quot; (being credited under the pseudonym &quot;Philip Bartlett&quot;) and the &quot;Pokémon Live!&quot; musical, while Dan Green provided the voice for &quot;The First Movie&quot;″s direct sequel, &quot;Pokémon: Mewtwo Returns&quot;. Green reprised the role in the 2019 remake of the first Pokémon movie, &quot;Pokémon: Mewtwo Strikes Back Evolution&quot;.

Actress Reiko Takashima voiced a second, unrelated Mewtwo in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime special &quot;Mewtwo: Prologue to Awakening&quot; and its direct sequel, &quot;Pokémon the Movie: Genesect and the Legend Awakened&quot;; this second Mewtwo is voiced by actress Miriam Pultro in the English dub. Mewtwo has featured in other game franchises, such as &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, in which Ichimura reprised in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; and Keiji Fujiwara in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;. A third Mewtwo also appears in the 2019 live-action animated film &quot;Detective Pikachu&quot;, voiced simultaneously by Rina Hoshino and Kotaro Watanabe.

==Conception and design==
Mewtwo is a species of fictional creatures called Pokémon created for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise. Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Japanese franchise began in 1996 with the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; for the Game Boy, which were later released in North America as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; in 1998. In these games and their sequels, the player assumes the role of a Trainer whose goal is to capture and use the creatures&#x27; special abilities to combat other Pokémon. Each Pokémon have one or two elemental types, which define its advantages and disadvantages when battling other Pokémon. A major goal in each game is to complete the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading with other Trainers to obtain individuals from all Pokémon species.

Introduced in &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, Mewtwo was conceived and designed by design lead Ken Sugimori, and was one of the earliest designs created, preceding that of series mascot Pikachu. Standing tall, it appears as a bipedal feline. Mewtwo has a light gray physique with a pronounced tail and abdomen, large thighs, purple irises, bulbous fingertips, pronounced collarbone, crest-like pinnae, and a tube-like mass of flesh that connects from behind its head to the center of its upper back. Sugimori intended for the details in its shape as well as the look in its eyes to give off &quot;an unsettling aura&quot;. According to Pokémon Company president Tsunekazu Ishihara, Mewtwo was expected to be popular with North American audiences, citing their preference for strong, powerful characters.

Created as a genetically modified clone of another Pokémon, the ancient Mew, Mewtwo directly precedes Mew in the game&#x27;s numerical Pokémon index due to programmer Shigeki Morimoto&#x27;s last minute creation and inclusion of Mew into the game prior to release. Until the first &quot;Pokémon&quot; movie was released in the United States, Mewtwo was rarely referred to as a &quot;clone&quot; in Japanese sources. Kubo Masakazu, executive producer of &quot;Mewtwo Strikes Back&quot;, explained that they &quot;intentionally avoid using the term &#x27;kuron&#x27; [clone]… because the word has a frightening feel&quot;.

In the original games, Mewtwo is intended to be &quot;the strongest Pokémon ever.&quot; Due to genetic engineering being applied to a sample of Mew&#x27;s DNA in order to fully create Mewtwo&#x27;s genome, Mewtwo is an extremely powerful psychic, with its abilities surpassing Mew&#x27;s due to intentional alterations to the genetic source material. As such, it can use telekinesis for flight, to shield itself and to powerfully throw opponents aside. In addition, it is among the very few Pokémon capable of human speech, doing so via telepathy. Otherwise, it conserves its energy until needed, such as against powerful opponents. In addition to its psychic abilities, Mewtwo can also regenerate, which allows it to quickly recover from near-fatal injuries. For the sixth and seventh generations of the Pokemon video game series, Mewtwo has two Mega Evolved forms, Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Mewtwo Y. These can be activated if the player gives Mewtwo either the Mewtwonite X or the Mewtwonite Y.

==Appearances==

===In video games===

In &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, the player learns of Mewtwo&#x27;s existence by reading research notes left in the ruined Pokémon Mansion on Cinnabar Island. The notes say that a scientist discovered a new Pokémon in a Guyana jungle, that they named it Mew, and that it later gave birth to a creature they called Mewtwo; the game&#x27;s Pokédex entry states that Mewtwo was &quot;created by a scientist after years of horrific gene splicing and DNA engineering experiments&quot;. Mewtwo proved too mighty to control, destroying the laboratory and escaping. The player is later given an opportunity to capture Mewtwo in the Cerulean Cave, which is accessible only after defeating the game&#x27;s final bosses, the Elite Four and Blue; in the remakes &quot;Pokémon FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; this prerequisite was expanded, requiring the player to explore more thoroughly and record information on sixty Pokémon species before access to the cave would be granted. Mewtwo can be caught in &quot;Pokémon HeartGold&quot; and &quot;SoulSilver&quot; in the same location as before after defeating all of the gym leaders in Kanto. The character was also the focus of a promotion and downloadable content giveaway for &quot;Pokémon Black&quot; and &quot;White&quot;, debuting with its signature move &quot;Psystrike&quot; that can also be learned by leveling up. Mewtwo also reappears in &quot;Pokémon X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; after completing the main story, and is one of the handful of Pokémon capable of using the new Mega Evolution mechanic, as it can transform into either Mega Mewtwo X or Mega Mewtwo Y. Mewtwo reappears in Pokémon: Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu! and Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!, another remake of &quot;Red and Blue&quot;, again in Cerulean Cave and is capable of Mega Evolution. Mewtwo is also obtainable alongside other past Legendary Pokémon in Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, Pokémon Sword and Shield: The Crown Tundra, and Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl.

In addition to being transferable to almost every mainline &quot;Pokémon&quot; game, Mewtwo has also made appearances in multiple spin-offs. In &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Pinball&quot;, Mewtwo appears as a final boss after all competitions have been completed. In &quot;Pokémon Puzzle League&quot;, Mewtwo, voiced by Philip Bartlett, serves not only as the final opponent, but also as the main antagonist responsible for the game&#x27;s events. Mewtwo appears in the &quot;Pokémon Mystery Dungeon&quot; series, featuring Mewtwo as an unlockable player character that must be defeated before it may be used in &quot;Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team.&quot; Mewtwo has been a playable character in multiple entries of the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. Mewtwo was originally meant to appear in the original &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot;, but was cut due to time constraints. Mewtwo made its debut in the series in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; voiced by Masachika Ichimura who reprises his role in &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie&quot;. After simply appearing as a trophy &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;, Mewtwo returned to the series as a DLC character in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot; on April 28, 2015, though it was made available to Club Nintendo members who registered both versions on April 15, 2015. In &quot;3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot;, its Final Smash involves it Mega Evolving into Mega Mewtwo Y and using Psystrike, its signature move in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; games. Mewtwo also returned as a playable character in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; for the Nintendo Switch, where it is once again an unlockable character. In both &quot;3DS/Wii U&quot; and &quot;Ultimate&quot;, Keiji Fujiwara voices Mewtwo in all languages. A new form of Mewtwo, Shadow Mewtwo, appears as a boss character in &quot;Pokkén Tournament&quot; and has a special attack that involves it Mega Evolving into Mega Mewtwo X. Shadow Mewtwo can also be unlocked as a playable character. In addition, its normal form appears as a playable character. In augmented reality mobile game &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;, Mewtwo is able to be battled and caught in event Raids available on select dates and times, including a different variation of Mewtwo wearing its armor from &quot;Pokémon: Mewtwo Strikes Back - Evolution&quot; that was made available for a limited time in Tier 5 Raids in July 2019. In the &quot;Detective Pikachu&quot; game and its sequel &quot;Detective Pikachu Returns&quot;, Mewtwo is a major character of the plot with it being a key to the mystery behind the disappearance of the main character&#x27;s father, Harry Goodman. Mewtwo also appears as a usable Pokémon in Pokémon Masters as the partner of Giovanni, who first became playable in the first Legendary Event, &quot;Lurking Shadow&quot;. During the first part of the Villain Arc story with Team Rocket, &quot;Looming Shadow of Kanto&quot;, the player could obtain Giovanni Legendary Spirit to raise the rarity of Giovanni to 6-Star EX if the player also used all 20 Power-Ups for Giovanni, which gives it a power boost and makes his Sync Move target all opponents instead of one, and then in the second part of the arc, &quot;Spreading Shadow&quot;, the player could obtain Mewtwo Crystals to allow Giovanni&#x27;s Mewtwo to evolve into Mega Mewtwo Y, which makes it even stronger and replaces the move Confusion with Psystrike until the end of the battle. In July 2023, Mewtwo was added as a playable character to &quot;Pokémon Unite&quot;.

===In anime and related media===
Mewtwo appears in the episode 63 of the animated series (episode 61 in the English dub) titled &quot;The Battle of the Badge&quot; wherein Giovanni sends in Mewtwo during his gym battle at Viridian Gym with Gary Oak. Mewtwo easily defeats all of Gary&#x27;s Pokémon and is afterwards taken by Giovanni on a secret mission. In the following episode, &quot;It&#x27;s Mr. Mime Time!&quot;, Mewtwo appears briefly while Giovanni is on a video call with Team Rocket. In both episodes, Mewtwo is covered in various pieces of advanced armor and machinery which obscure its features.

Mewtwo is featured in the film &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie&quot; as the main antagonist. Unlike in the games, it is shown to be the creation of the criminal organization Team Rocket, and is referred to as a clone instead of a genetically modified mammal. After Mewtwo destroys the laboratory where it was born, Team Rocket&#x27;s leader, Giovanni, convinces Mewtwo he can help it control its powers, instead using Mewtwo as a weapon. After escaping Giovanni, Mewtwo questions the reason for its existence and declares revenge on its creators. To this end, it lures several Pokémon trainers, among them protagonist Ash Ketchum, to its island in order to clone their Pokémon. Once it does so, Mewtwo forces the originals to battle their clones in an effort to determine which set is superior, while Mewtwo faces its own genetic relative, Mew. Ash sacrifices himself to stop the fighting, though he is later revived from tears shed by both the originals and clones because of his sacrifice.

Mewtwo, upon acknowledging the selflessness of Ash&#x27;s sacrifice, comes to the conclusion that one&#x27;s actions determine who they are and not the circumstances of their birth. Soon after having this epiphany, Mewtwo and the clones are joined by Mew as they leave to find a sanctuary, with Mewtwo erasing all memory of the events from those gathered. In localizing the film for English-language audiences, Mewtwo&#x27;s personality became more arrogant and megalomaniacal; localization director Norman Grossfield ruled the changes necessary, as he believed American audiences needed a &quot;clearly evil&quot; instead of ambiguous villain. In the film, Mewtwo is voiced by Jay Goede (credited as Philip Bartlett) in English, and by Ichimura in Japanese. In this film, Mewtwo displayed unique abilities and powers unseen in other Pokémon, such as blocking all Pokémon moves in his arena when the clones face off against the originals.

In September 1999, Nintendo published &quot;Sound Picture Box Mewtwo&quot;, which included &quot;The Birth of Mewtwo: Pokémon Radio Drama&quot;, a CD drama that expands upon Mewtwo&#x27;s origins. Created by scientist Dr. Fuji, Mewtwo is one of several cloning attempts, which also includes Amber, a clone of Fuji&#x27;s deceased daughter. The young Mewtwo befriends Amber, communicating telepathically; however, the cloning process proves unstable, and she dies. To save the traumatized Mewtwo, Fuji erases its memories and puts it under sedation until its body finishes developing, leading to the events of the film. The CD drama was later adapted into a short anime, and was included with Japanese home releases and broadcasts of &quot;Mewtwo Strikes Back&quot; and later in North America in December 2001 as part of &quot;Mewtwo Returns&quot;. Mewtwo as a child is voiced in Japanese by Fujiko Takimoto for the CD drama and Showtaro Morikubo for the anime, while in the English localization the voice actor is uncredited.

In December 2000, the film was followed by a direct sequel, &quot;Pokémon: Mewtwo Returns&quot;, which was broadcast on Japanese television in December 2000 and released worldwide on home video and DVD in 2001. Voiced by Dan Green in English with Ichimura reprising the role in Japanese, Mewtwo and the clones have since found peace on Mount Quena in Johto, a region which directly neighbors Mewtwo&#x27;s home region of Kanto. However, Giovanni, whose memories were left intact after the first film, locates and pursues Mewtwo. Assisted by Ash and his companions, Mewtwo comes to terms with its existence and defeats Giovanni, removing any memory of itself from him and his soldiers&#x27; minds while leaving the others unaffected. As everyone departs, Mewtwo sets out on its own while the clones remain safely behind on Mount Quena.

Mewtwo also appears in the musical &quot;Pokémon Live!&quot;, a live action adaptation of the anime set after &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie – Mewtwo Strikes Back&quot;, and is portrayed by Marton Fulop. In it, Mewtwo faces a robotic replica of itself, MechaMew2, created by Giovanni and able to learn any attacks used against it. However, after learning compassion from Mewtwo, the machine rebels and self-destructs. The 2006 television special &quot;Pokémon: The Mastermind of Mirage Pokémon&quot; features a hologram version of Mewtwo, created and controlled by the story&#x27;s antagonist Dr. Yung. With help from a hologram Mew, Ash and his companions destroy the Mewtwo hologram and defeat Yung.

Another Mewtwo appears in the anime special &quot;Mewtwo: Prologue to Awakening&quot; and its direct sequel &quot;Pokémon the Movie: Genesect and the Legend Awakened&quot;, voiced by the actress Reiko Takashima. Compared to the original Mewtwo, this one is also conflicted about its existence, yet is more empathic to the point of not being belligerent toward humans, as shown when it protects Ash, Iris, Cilan, and Eric from the rampaging Genesect army. Unlike the original Mewtwo, this one is able to Mega Evolve into Mega Mewtwo Y; due to Mega Evolution not being fully introduced at the time, it is referred to in the film as Mewtwo&#x27;s .

A Mewtwo, which was created by Mr. Fuji, appears in the anime miniseries &quot;Pokémon Origins&quot;, which is generally based on the plot of the video games &quot;Pokémon FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot;. As such, Red goes to Cerulean Cave, and uses the Mega Evolution mechanic introduced in &quot;Pokémon X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; to Mega Evolve his Charizard for the fight with Mewtwo, whom Red captures.

Mewtwo made its live-action animated debut in the 2019 movie &quot;Detective Pikachu&quot;. Mewtwo also appears in the film &quot;Pokémon: Mewtwo Strikes Back—Evolution&quot;, a remake of &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie – Mewtwo Strikes Back&quot;, that premiered on July 12, 2019.

Mewtwo from the first film appears in &quot;Pokémon Journeys&quot; episode &quot;Getting More Than You Battled For!&quot;. Mewtwo protects several Pokémon that had been abused by humans on Cero Island since its departure from Mount Quena. Ash recognizes Mewtwo while Goh meets it for the first time after they were saved from the waterfall. After defeating Ash and Goh in a battle, Mewtwo decides to leave Cero Island with the rescued Pokémon and teleports them back to the Cerise Laboratory, allowing them to retain their memories of the encounter.

===In printed adaptations===
Mewtwo has appeared as a central character in several books related to the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise, including novelizations of &quot;Mewtwo Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Mewtwo Returns&quot;, both of which closely follow the events of the films. In December 1999, Viz Media published the children&#x27;s picture book &quot;I&#x27;m Not Pikachu!: Pokémon Tales Movie Special&quot;, which featured children taking on traits of the characters from the film, including Mewtwo. In May 2001, Viz released a second children&#x27;s book, &quot;Mewtwo&#x27;s Watching You!&quot;, which featured a shy Mewtwo interestedly watching other Pokémon play.

In the manga series &quot;Pokémon Adventures&quot;, Team Rocket created Mewtwo, but some of its DNA is placed inside the Gym leader Blaine. Because of the DNA that they share, the two are unable to be separated for very long without becoming ill. Later, another Pokémon, Entei, is able to break the bond between the two by removing the DNA in Blaine&#x27;s arm, at which point Mewtwo leaves. It eventually helps the main character of the series, Red, fight against Team Rocket leader Giovanni and his Deoxys.

In 1998, Toshihiro Ono was asked to write a story detailing Mewtwo&#x27;s origin to coincide with the release of &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie – Mewtwo Strikes Back&quot;. The 52-page comic, presented in the form of a flashback, was replaced midway by &quot;The Birth of Mewtwo&quot; animated short, resulting in little connection between Ono&#x27;s work and the film. Regardless, it saw print as a side story for &quot;Pokémon: The Electric Tale of Pikachu&quot; in the July 1998 issue of &quot;CoroCoro Comic&quot;. In it, Mewtwo&#x27;s creator, Dr. Fuji takes on the role of a coach for the fully developed Pokémon, while his employers, Team Rocket, test its abilities. Learning of a plan to mass-produce it as a weapon, Fuji approaches Mewtwo and tells it to destroy the lab and Fuji himself. Mewtwo refuses, stating it can not harm the doctor, who it regards as its father. Once captured by Team Rocket, Fuji tells Mewtwo that he is honored by the statement and is then killed. Angered by his death, Mewtwo destroys the lab and escapes. In the present, Mewtwo cries in its sleep as it dreams of the events.

==Promotion and reception==
Mewtwo&#x27;s image is utilized for merchandise related to the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise, which includes toys, children&#x27;s toothbrushes, and a playing piece for a &quot;Pokémon&quot;-themed version of &quot;Monopoly&quot;. Several action figures have been made, such as a posable figure by Hasbro in 2006 that included accessories to recreate its &quot;Hyper Beam&quot; and &quot;Light Screen&quot; attacks, and a six-inch-tall &quot;talking&quot; figurine by Jakks Pacific as part of a series to commemorate the anime&#x27;s &quot;Battle Frontier&quot; story arc. Items marketed for adults featuring Mewtwo have also been sold and distributed by Nintendo, such as T-shirts. The island nation of Niue released a one-dollar coin featuring the character as part of a commemorative promotion for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise, with Mewtwo on one side and the nation&#x27;s coat of arms on the other. Mewtwo also appears on the port side of All Nippon Airways&#x27;s Pocket Monsters Boeing 747 jumbo jet, alongside Mew.

In the games, Mewtwo is consistently noted as being one of the strongest opponents, and has been described in &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; as being &quot;the best Pokémon in the game&quot;, as well as &quot;one of the rarest — and hardest to catch&quot;. Because of the character&#x27;s multiple strengths and few weaknesses, it changes how players approach playing against each other, causing players to either develop strategies solely to defeat an opposing Mewtwo, or to prohibit its use when battling other players. Kevin Slackie of &quot;Paste&quot; described Mewtwo as one of the series&#x27; best Pokemon, noting its presence as the penultimate boss in the original games and also several subsequent appearances, and how despite not having the same exposure as Pikachu it managed to remain relevant for over twenty years, &quot;which itself is a testament to its amazing staying power as one of the most powerful Pokémon.&quot; Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; compared Mewtwo to &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series character Akuma, and praised it for having a backstory, personality and motivation unlike many pokémon in the franchise, stating &quot; Genetic engineering in a world of wacky creatures is just asking for trouble and Mewtwo is the payoff.&quot; Dale Bishir of &quot;IGN&quot; described him as an icon, and the &quot;go-to &#x27;villain&#x27; Pokemon&quot;, noting its frequent presence in media for the series, including its starring role in two of the feature films.

In reception to extended media for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise, Mewtwo was well received, and was described by &quot;Anime Classics Zettai!: 100 Must-See Japanese Animation Masterpieces&quot; as the best villain of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; film series, and one of &quot;Mewtwo Strikes Back&quot;″s strongest elements. His portrayal has also been likened to Frankenstein&#x27;s monster as a being born from artificial means and discontent with the fact. Theology Secretary for the Church of England Anne Richards described Mewtwo as representing a &quot;parable about the pointlessness of force&quot;, and praised the character for displaying the Christian value of redemption. Other reactions have been mixed. While it has been cited as a &quot;complex and compelling villain&quot; by some critics, its goal of world domination was received as a trait shared by &quot;…every &quot;anime&quot; villain…&quot;, and likened to a James Bond villain by &quot;Daily Record&quot;. However, &quot;Animerica&quot; praised Mewtwo as a character with &quot;philosophical depth&quot; as well as for serving as &quot;an adversary of almost infinite power and genuine malice&quot; that the anime series had been lacking. Ken Hollings of &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; described Mewtwo as &quot;brooding, articulate and vengeful where the other Pokémon remain bright blobs of wordless energy&quot;, and &quot;Like a troubled elder brother, Mewtwo represents an older order of experience.&quot; 

Mewtwo&#x27;s character and design have also been analyzed in academic study. The book &quot;Pikachu&#x27;s Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon&quot; noted Mewtwo as popular with older male children who tend to be drawn to &quot;tough or scary&quot; characters; Mew in contrast was described as a polar opposite, a character popular with young girls who tend to be drawn to &quot;cute&quot; characters. Others books, such as &quot;Media and the Make-believe Worlds of Children&quot;, have noted a similar comparison, citing Mewtwo as &quot;more aggressive-looking&quot; compared to Mew and emphasizing the importance of the contrast for children. The book &quot;Gaming Cultures and Place in Asia-Pacific&quot; compares Sugimori&#x27;s design of Mewtwo to that of Japanese tokusatsu films, namely monster films like the 1954 &quot;Godzilla&quot; in creating &quot;monstrous yet familiar silhouettes from the past renewed agency in the form of eyes and expressions which cut through the viewer&quot;.
==Notes==
:1. The Japanese texts of the Pokémon Mansion Journals as well as various Pokédex entries state that an individual scientist created Mewtwo, as opposed to a team of researchers like in the anime.

<text>Minas Tirith is the capital of Gondor in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. It is a seven-walled fortress city built on the spur of a mountain, rising some 700 feet to a high terrace, housing the Citadel, at the seventh level. Atop this is the 300-foot high Tower of Ecthelion, which contains the throne room.

Scholars, following various leads in Tolkien&#x27;s fantasy and letters, have attempted to identify Minas Tirith with several different historical or mythical cities, including Troy, Rome, Ravenna, and Constantinople.

In Peter Jackson&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Minas Tirith was given something of the look of a city of the Byzantine empire, while its seven-tiered shape was suggested by the tidal island and abbey of Mont Saint-Michel in France. Tolkien illustrators including Alan Lee, John Howe, Jef Murray, and Ted Nasmith have all produced realistic paintings of the city.

== Description ==

Minas Tirith (Sindarin: &quot;Tower of Guard&quot;) was the capital of Gondor at the end of the Third Age of Middle-earth. It lay at the eastern end of the White Mountains, built around a shoulder of Mount Mindolluin. The city is sometimes called &quot;the White Tower&quot;, a synecdoche for the city&#x27;s most prominent building in its Citadel, the seat of the city&#x27;s administration. The head of government is the Lord of the City, a role fulfilled by the Stewards of Gondor. Other officials included the Warden of the Houses of Healing and the Warden of the Keys. The Warden of the Keys was in charge of the city&#x27;s security, especially its gates, and the safe-keeping of its treasury, notably the Crown of Gondor; he had command of the city when it was besieged by the forces of Mordor.

Minas Tirith had seven walls: each wall held a gate, and for strength of defence each gate faced a different direction from the next, facing alternately somewhat north or south. Each level was about higher than the one below it, and each surrounded by a high stone wall coloured in white, with the exception of the wall of the First Circle (the lowest level), which was black, built of the same material used for Orthanc. This outer wall was also the tallest, longest and strongest of the city&#x27;s seven walls; it was vulnerable only to earthquakes capable of rending the ground where it stood. The Great Gate of Minas Tirith, constructed of iron and steel and guarded by stone towers and bastions, was the main gate in the first or outer wall of the city. In front of the Great Gate was a large paved area called the Gateway. The main roads to Minas Tirith met here: the North-way that became the Great West Road to Rohan; the South Road to the southern provinces of Gondor; and the road to Osgiliath, which lay to the north-east of Minas Tirith. Except for the high saddle of rock which joined the west of the hill to Mindolluin, the city was surrounded by the Pelennor, an area of farmlands.

The city&#x27;s main street zigzagged up the eastern hill-face and through each of the gates and the central spur of rock. It led to the Citadel through the Seventh Gate on its eastern part. The White Tower, at the city&#x27;s highest level with a commanding view of the lower vales of Anduin, stood in the Citadel, 700 feet higher than the surrounding plains, protected by the seventh and innermost wall atop the spur. Originally constructed by a king of yore, it is also known as the Tower of Ecthelion, the Steward of Gondor who had it re-built. The seat of the rulers of Gondor, the Kings and the Stewards, the tower stood tall, so that its pinnacle was some above the plain. The main doors of the tower faced east, onto the Court of the Fountain. Inside was the Tower Hall, the great throne room where the Kings (or Stewards) held court. The Seeing-stone of Minas Tirith, used by Denethor in &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, rested in a secret chamber at the top of the Tower. There was a buttery of the Guards of the Citadel in the basement of the tower. Behind the tower, reached from the sixth level, was a saddle leading to the Hallows or necropolis of the Kings and Stewards, with its street of tombs, Rath Dínen.

== Identifications with historical or mythical cities ==

Tolkien was influenced by many authors when constructing Middle-earth, including several classical sources. Scholars, following various leads in Tolkien&#x27;s fantasy and letters, have identified Minas Tirith with several different historical or mythical cities, including Troy, Rome, Ravenna, and Constantinople.

=== Troy ===

In a letter, Tolkien stated that Minas Tirith, some &quot;600 miles south [of the village of Hobbiton in the Shire], is at about the latitude of Florence. The Mouths of Anduin and the ancient city of Pelargir [in the south of Gondor] are at about the latitude of ancient Troy.&quot; Michael Livingston comments in &quot;Mythlore&quot; that Minas Tirith resembled Troy in having &quot;impregnable walls&quot;, and in being subjected to a siege that seemed to threaten civilisation. 

Further, in Livingston&#x27;s opinion, the Steward Denethor&#x27;s two sons, Boromir and Faramir, play the roles of Hector in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, &quot;the heroic example of martial, mortal man&quot;, and of Paris, the younger brother &quot;little loved by [his father]&quot;, in &quot;asterisk&quot; form, as they might have been. Livingston notes that Paris, like Faramir, is seriously wounded by a &quot;deadly dart&quot;; he is dragged back into Troy, just as Faramir is carried to Minas Tirith&#x27;s Houses of Healing. Both men suffer burning fevers. Paris can&#x27;t be saved; Faramir can. Paris&#x27;s body is burned on a pyre; his abandoned wife Oenone burns herself to death with him. Denethor has himself burned alive on a pyre, and he tries to have Faramir burned with him, but is foiled in this.

=== Ravenna ===

Tolkien&#x27;s map-notes for the illustrator Pauline Baynes indicate that Minas Tirith had the latitude of Ravenna, an Italian city on the Adriatic Sea, though it lay &quot;900 miles east of Hobbiton more near Belgrade&quot;.
The Tolkien scholar Judy Ann Ford writes that there is an architectural connection with Ravenna in Pippin&#x27;s description of the great hall of Denethor, which in her view suggests a Germanic myth of a restored Roman Empire.

=== Ancient Rome ===

Sandra Ballif Straubhaar states in &quot;The J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot; that &quot;the most striking similarities&quot; are with ancient Rome. She identifies several parallels: Aeneas, from Troy, and Elendil, from Númenor, both survive the destruction of their home countries; the brothers Romulus and Remus found Rome, while the brothers Isildur and Anárion found the Númenórean kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor in Middle-earth; and both Gondor and Rome experienced centuries of &quot;decadence and decline&quot;.

Judy Ann Ford adds in &quot;Tolkien Studies&quot; that Minas Tirith was entirely built of stone, and &quot;the only culture within [the Anglo-Saxons&#x27;] historical memory that had made places like Minas Tirith was the Roman Empire.&quot; Tolkien intended to create a mythology for England, so that while the Third Age is ostensibly many thousands of years ago, much of the setting is medieval. She comments that Tolkien&#x27;s account echoes the decline and fall of Rome, but &quot;with a happy ending&quot;, as it &quot;somehow withstood the onslaught of armies from the east, and ... was restored to glory.&quot; She finds multiple likenesses between Minas Tirith and Rome.

=== Constantinople === 

In a 1951 letter, Tolkien wrote of &quot;the Byzantine City of Minas Tirith&quot;, thus associating Gondor&#x27;s capital with Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire. The classical scholar Miryam Librán-Moreno writes that Tolkien drew heavily on the history of the Byzantine Empire, and its struggle with the Goths and Langobards. The Byzantine Empire and Gondor were both, in Librán-Moreno&#x27;s view, only echoes of older states (the Roman Empire and the unified kingdom of Elendil), yet each proved to be stronger than their sister-kingdoms (the Western Roman Empire and Arnor, respectively). Both realms were threatened by powerful eastern and southern enemies: the Byzantines by the Sassanid Persians and the Muslim armies of the Arabs and the Turks, as well as the Langobards and Goths; Gondor by the Easterlings, the Haradrim, and the hordes of Sauron. Both realms, as commentators including Librán-Moreno and Jefferson P. Swycaffer have observed, were in decline at the time of a final, all-out siege from the East; however, Minas Tirith survived the siege whereas Constantinople did not. Swycaffer adds that Constantinople was famed for the strength of its defences, with its concentric walls. 

== Analysis ==

=== The White Tree ===


Tolkien stated that within the Court of the Fountain at the heart of Minas Tirith stood the White Tree, the symbol of Gondor. It was dry and dead throughout the centuries that Gondor was ruled by the Stewards; Aragorn brought a young living sapling of the White Tree into the city on his return as King, symbolising the rebirth of the monarchy. 

Tolkien&#x27;s biographer John Garth writes that the White Tree has been likened to the Dry Tree of the 14th century &quot;Travels of Sir John Mandeville&quot;. The tale runs that the Dry Tree has been dry since the crucifixion of Christ, but that it will flower afresh when &quot;a prince of the west side of the world should sing a mass beneath it&quot;.

=== Contrast with Gondolin ===

Lisa Anne Mende, in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, contrasts the happy eucatastrophes which rescue Minas Tirith in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; – the last-minute arrivals of the Riders of Rohan, and then of Aragorn in the enemy&#x27;s ships – with the unmitigated disasters of the Fall of Gondolin and the other Elvish cities of Beleriand in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. She notes Tolkien&#x27;s Christianity, which influenced Middle-earth, and describes the &quot;first victory of Evil&quot; in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; as &quot;resolved into the harmony of the victory of Good&quot; in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. In &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, the Dark Lord Melkor greatly influences the story, and the development of Middle-earth, whereas in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Melkor&#x27;s acolyte, the Dark Lord Sauron is almost successful but fails in his plans.

== Adaptations ==

=== Film ===


In Peter Jackson&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Minas Tirith was according to the concept designer Alan Lee given an ancient appearance reminiscent of Byzantium or ancient Rome. However, the appearance and structure of the city was based upon the inhabited tidal island and abbey of Mont Saint-Michel, France. In the films, the towers of the city, designed by Lee, are equipped with trebuchets. The film critic Roger Ebert called the films&#x27; interpretation of Minas Tirith a &quot;spectacular achievement&quot;, and compared it to the Emerald City from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. He praised the filmmakers&#x27; ability to blend digital and real sets.

The setting of Minas Tirith has appeared in video game adaptations of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, such as the 2003 video game &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; where it is directly modelled on Jackson&#x27;s film adaptation.

=== Art ===

Christopher Tuthill, in &quot;A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien&quot;, evaluates the paintings of Minas Tirith made by the major Tolkien illustrators Alan Lee, John Howe (both of whom worked as concept designers for Peter Jackson&#x27;s film trilogy), Jef Murray, and Ted Nasmith. Tuthill writes that it has become &quot;hard to imagine&quot; Middle-earth &quot;without the many sub-creators who have worked within it&quot;, noting that the &quot;dreaded effects&quot; of what Tolkien called &quot;silliness and morbidity&quot; of much fantasy art in his time &quot;are nowhere in evidence&quot; in these artists&#x27; work. In Tuthill&#x27;s view, the most &quot;fully rendered and realistic-looking&quot; painting is Nasmith&#x27;s &quot;Gandalf Rides to Minas Tirith&quot;, with a &quot;wholly convincing city&quot; in the background, majestic as the Wizard gallops towards it in the dawn light. He notes that Nasmith uses his architectural rendering skill to provide a detailed view of the whole city. He quotes Nasmith as writing that he studied what Tolkien said, such as likening Gondor to the culture of ancient Egypt. Tuthill compares Howe&#x27;s and Murray&#x27;s versions of the same scene; Howe shows only a corner of the city, but vividly captures the movement of the horse and the rider&#x27;s flying robes, with a strong interplay of light and dark, the white horse against the dusky rocks. Murray similarly uses strong contrast, with the white city against dark clouds overhead, but using &quot;flat bold lines and a deep blue hue&quot;, while Howe&#x27;s city more closely resembles a traditional castle of fairytales with pennants on every pinnacle, in Fauvist style. Lee chooses instead to look within Minas Tirith, showing &quot;the same glimmering spires and white stone&quot;, a guard standing in the foreground in place of Gandalf and his horse; his painting gives a feeling of &quot;how massive the city is&quot;, with close attention to the late Romanesque or early Gothic architectural detail and perspective.

<text>The Hernici were an Italic tribe of ancient Italy, whose territory was in Latium between the Fucine Lake and the Sacco River (&quot;Trerus&quot;), bounded by the Volsci on the south, and by the Aequi and the Marsi on the north.

== History ==
For many years of the early Roman Republic, the Hernici were allied with Rome and fought alongside it against its neighbours.

In 495 BC Livy records that they entered into a treaty with the Volsci against ancient Rome.

They long maintained their independence, and in 486 BC they were still strong enough to conclude an equal treaty with the Latins.

In 475 BC they fought alongside the Latins against the Aequi and Volsci, and in the same year fought alongside Rome against the Veientes and Sabines. In 468 BC they fought alongside Rome against the Volsci.

In 464 BC they warned Rome of the betrayal of Ecetra, and fought alongside Rome against the Aequi who were allied with the Ecetrans.

They broke away from Rome in 362 and in 306, when their chief town Anagnia was taken and reduced to a &quot;praefectura&quot;, but Ferentinum, Aletrium and Verulae were rewarded for their fidelity by being allowed to remain free &quot;municipia&quot;, a position which at that date they preferred to the &quot;civitas&quot;.

The name of the Hernici, like that of the Volsci, is missing from the list of Italian peoples whom Polybius describes as able to furnish troops in 225 BC. By that date, therefore, their territory cannot have been distinguished from Latium generally, and it seems probable that they had then received the full Roman citizenship. The oldest Latin inscriptions of the district (from Ferentinum) are earlier than the Social War, and present no local characteristic.

==Language==

A couple of inscriptions show that the Hernican language was a member of the group of Osco-Umbrian (Sabellian) languages. Their name, with its &quot;co&quot; termination, classes them along with the &quot;co&quot;-tribes, like the Volsci, who would seem to have been earlier inhabitants of the west coast of Italy, rather than with the tribes whose names were formed with the &quot;no&quot;-suffix.

<text>The Aequi were an Italic tribe on a stretch of the Apennine Mountains to the east of Latium in central Italy who appear in the early history of ancient Rome. After a long struggle for independence from Rome, they were defeated and substantial Roman colonies were placed on their soil. Only two inscriptions believed to be in the Aequian language remain. No more can be deduced than that the language was Italic. Otherwise, the inscriptions from the region are those of the Latin-speaking colonists in Latin. The colonial exonym documented in these inscriptions is Aequi and also Aequicoli (&quot;colonists of Aequium&quot;). The manuscript variants of the classical authors present Equic-, Aequic-, Aequac-. If the form without the -coli is taken as an original, it may well also be the endonym, but to date further evidence is lacking.

==Historical geography==
The historians made many entries concerning the wars between the Aequi and Rome; the geographers scarcely mention them. Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy both make the same brief statement: the towns of the Aequiculi were Cliternia or Cliternum and Carsoli or Carsioli Pliny places them in Augustus&#x27; &quot;Regio IV&quot;; Ptolemy adds that they were to the east of the Sabini. By the time of the early Roman Empire, all vestige of the Italic Aequi was gone. The two cities mentioned had been Roman colonies. The forms mentioned in inscriptions from there are Carsioli and Cliternia.

They occupied the upper reaches of the valleys of the Aniene, Tolenus and Himella, the last two being mountain streams running northward to join the Nera river.

==History==
According to Strabo, the Aequi were in existence when the city of Rome was founded. They are first mentioned by Livy as an ancient nation from which the Romans borrowed the rites of declaring war. Livy also mentions that the last king of Rome, Tarquinius Superbus, made peace with the Aequi.

They fought several wars against the Romans, among which was the Battle of Mount Algidus (458 BC). Their chief center is said to have been taken by the Romans about 484 BC. and again about 90 years later.

Records of fighting between Romans and Aequi become much sparser in the second half of the 5th century BC. Likely the Aequi had gradually become a more settled people and their raiding petered out as a result.

In 390 BC, a Gaulish war band defeated the Roman army at the Battle of Allia and then sacked Rome. The ancient writers report that, in 389 BC, the Etruscans, Volsci, and Aequi all raised armies in the hope of exploiting this blow to Roman power. According to Livy and Plutarch, the Aequi gathered their army at Bolae. However, the Roman dictator, Marcus Furius Camillus, had just inflicted a severe defeat on the Volsci. He surprised the Aequian army and captured both their camp and the town. According to Diodorus Siculus, the Aequi were actually besieging Bolae when they were attacked by Camillus. According to Livy, a Roman army ravaged Aequian territory again in 388, this time meeting no resistance. Oakley (1997) considers these notices of Roman victories against the Aequi in 389 and 388 to be historical, confirmed by the disappearance of the Aequi from the sources until 304. Owing to the dispute in the sources, however, the precise nature of the fighting around Bolae cannot be determined. Bolae was a Latin town, but it was also the scene of much fighting between Romans and Aequi, and it changed hands several times. Either an (unreported) Aequian capture followed by Roman recapture, or a failed Aequan siege, are therefore possible.

The Aequi were not finally subdued until the end of the second Samnite war, when they seem to have received a limited form of franchise.

All we know of their subsequent political condition is that after the Social War the folk of Cliternia and Nersae appear united in a &quot;res publica Aequiculorum&quot;, which was a municipium of the ordinary type located in what is now the municipality of Pescorocchiano. The Latin colonies of Alba Fucens (304 BC) and Carsioli (298 BC) must have spread the use of Latin all over the district; through it lay the chief (and for some time the only) route (Via Valeria) to Lucera and the south.

At the end of the Republican period, the Aequi appear under the name Aequiculi or Aequicoli, organized as a municipium, the territory of which seems to have comprised the upper part of the valley of the Salto, still known as Cicolano (from Latin &quot;Ager Aequicolanus&quot;). It is probable, however, that they continued to live in their villages as before. Of these, Nersae (modern Civitella di Nesce) was the most considerable. Remains include large polygonal terrace walls.

<text>Mount Athos (; ) is a mountain on the Athos peninsula in northeastern Greece directly on the Aegean Sea. It is an important center of Eastern Orthodox monasticism. The mountain and most of the Athos peninsula are governed as an autonomous region in Greece by the monastic community of Mount Athos, which is ecclesiastically under the direct jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. The remainder of the peninsula forms part of the Aristotelis municipality. Women are prohibited from entering the area governed by the monastic community by Greek law and by religious tradition.

Mount Athos has been inhabited since ancient times and is known for its long Christian presence and historical monastic traditions, which date back to at least 800 AD during the Byzantine era. Because of its long history of religious importance, the well-preserved agrarian architecture within the monasteries, and the preservation of the flora and fauna around the mountain, the monastic community of Mount Athos was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1988.

== Names ==
In the classical era, Mount Athos was called &quot;Athos&quot; and the peninsula or (). In modern Greek, the mountain is &quot;Oros Athos&quot; () and the peninsula &quot;Hersonisos tou Atho&quot; (), while the designation &quot;Agio Oros&quot; () translating to &#x27;Holy Mountain&#x27; is used to denote the monastic community.

Some languages of Orthodox tradition use names that translate to &#x27;Holy Mountain&#x27;, including Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian (, &quot;Sveta Gora&quot;), and Georgian (, ). However, not all languages spoken in the Eastern Orthodox world use this name: in the East Slavic languages (Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian) it is simply called (, meaning &quot;Athos&quot;), while in Romanian it is called &quot;Mount Athos&quot; ( or ).

== Geography ==
The peninsula, the easternmost &quot;leg&quot; of the larger Chalkidiki peninsula in central Macedonia, protrudes into the Aegean Sea at a width of between and covers an area of . The actual Mount Athos has steep, densely forested slopes reaching up to . The Athos peninsula, unlike Sithonia and Kassandra, is a geological continuation of the Rhodope Mountains of northern Greece and Bulgaria.

The surrounding seas, especially at the end of the peninsula, can be dangerous. In ancient Greek history, two fleet disasters in the area are recorded: Herodotus claimed that in 492 BC, Darius, the king of Persia, lost 300 ships under general Mardonius. In 411 BC the Spartans lost a fleet of 50 ships under the admiral Epicleas.

Mount Athos has an extensive network of footpaths, many of which date back to the Byzantine period. Many are typically not accessible to motor vehicle traffic.

==Flora==
Much of Mount Athos is covered with mixed broadleaf deciduous and evergreen forests. Black pine (&quot;Pinus nigra&quot;) forests are found at higher elevations. Sclerophyllous scrub vegetation is also found throughout Mount Athos. Typical forest trees are sweet chestnut (&quot;Castanea sativa&quot;), holm oak (&quot;Quercus ilex&quot;), kermes oak (&quot;Quercus coccifera&quot;), Hungarian oak (&quot;Quercus frainetto&quot;), oriental plane (&quot;Platanus orientalis&quot;), black pine (&quot;Pinus nigra&quot;), and cedar (&quot;Calocedrus decurrens&quot;). Other common plant species include the strawberry tree (&quot;Arbutus unedo&quot; and &quot;Arbutus andrachne&quot;), cypress (&quot;Cupressus sempervirens&quot;), laurel (&quot;Laurus nobilis&quot;), lentisk (&quot;Pistacia lentiscus&quot;), phillyrea (&quot;Phillyrea latifolia&quot;), wild olive (&quot;Olea europea&quot;), and heather (&quot;Erica&quot; spp.). Deciduous trees that are primarily found alongside streams include white willow, laurel, Oriental plane, and alder trees.

Aleppo pine (&quot;Pinus halepensis&quot;) is more commonly found in the northern part of the peninsula. Broadleaf maquis is found further south. Deciduous broadleaf forest dominated by sweet chestnut lies above the broadleaf maquis zone. There are also mixed forests consisting of deciduous oak trees, as well as limes, aspen, hop hornbeam, and maple. Black pine and stinking juniper can be found at higher elevations. Some herbaceous plants with tubers and bulbs include crocus, anemone, cyclamen, and fritillary species.

At least 35 plant species are endemic to Mount Athos, most of which are found in the area of the main summit in the south. &quot;Isatis tinctoria&quot; ssp. &quot;athoa&quot;, a woad subspecies, and &quot;Viola athois&quot; are named after Mount Athos.

Mount Athos is also home to 350 species of mushrooms.

==Fauna==
Mammals include the grey wolf (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;), wild boar (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;), red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), jackal (&quot;Canis aureus&quot;), European badger (&quot;Meles meles&quot;), beech marten (&quot;Martes foina&quot;), stoat (&quot;Mustela erminea&quot;), weasel (&quot;Mustela nivalis vulgaris&quot;), European hedgehog (&quot;Erinaceus concolor&quot;), shrews (&quot;Crocidura&quot; spp.), and Mediterranean monk seal (&quot;Monachus monachus&quot;). Other mammal species include roe deer, hares, and red squirrels.

Birds include the black stork (&quot;Ciconia nigra&quot;), short-toed snake-eagle (&quot;Circaetus gallicus&quot;), golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;), lesser kestrel (&quot;Falco naumanni&quot;), capercaillie (&quot;Tetrao urogallus&quot;), eagle owl (&quot;Bubo bubo&quot;), yelkouan shearwater (&quot;Puffinus yelkouan&quot;), and Audouin&#x27;s gull (&quot;Larus audouinii&quot;). Other bird species include swifts, swallows, martins, nightingales, and hoopoes.

== History ==
=== Antiquity ===
In Greek mythology, Athos is the name of one of the Gigantes that challenged the Greek gods during the Gigantomachia. Athos threw a massive rock at Poseidon which fell in the Aegean Sea and became Mount Athos. According to another version of the story, Poseidon used the mountain to bury the defeated giant.

Homer mentions the mountain Athos in the Iliad. Herodotus writes that during the Persian invasion of Thrace in 492 BC, the fleet of the Persian commander Mardonius was wrecked with losses of 300 ships and 20,000 men, by a strong North wind while attempting to round the coast near Mount Athos. Herodotus also states that Pelasgians from the island of Lemnos populated the peninsula, then called &quot;Akte,&quot; and names five cities thereon, Sane, Kleonai (Cleonae), Thyssos (Thyssus), Olophyxos (Olophyxus), and Akrothoon (Acrothoum). Strabo also mentions the cities of Dion (Dium) and Akrothoon. Eretria also established colonies on Akte. At least one other city was established in the Classical period: Akanthos (Acanthus). Some of these cities minted their own coins.

The peninsula was on the invasion route of Xerxes I, who spent three years excavating the Xerxes Canal across the isthmus to allow the passage of his invasion fleet in 483 BC. After the death of Alexander the Great, the architect Dinocrates (Deinokrates) proposed carving the entire mountain into a statue of Alexander.

Pliny the Elder stated in 77 AD that the inhabitants of Mount Athos could &quot;live to their four hundredth year&quot; due to the fact that they eat the skin of vipers.

The lack of historical accounts shrouds the history of the peninsula during the later ages. Archaeologists have not been able to determine the exact location of the cities reported by Strabo. It is believed that they must have been deserted when Athos&#x27;s new inhabitants, the monks, started arriving sometime before the ninth century AD.

=== Early Christianity ===
According to the Athonite tradition, the Blessed Virgin Mary was sailing accompanied by St John the Evangelist from Joppa to Cyprus to visit Lazarus. When the ship was blown off course to then-pagan Athos, it was forced to anchor near the port of Klement, close to the present monastery of Iviron. The Virgin walked ashore and, overwhelmed by the mountain&#x27;s wonderful and wild natural beauty, she blessed it and asked her Son for it to be her garden. A voice was heard saying, (Translation: &quot;Let this place be your inheritance and your garden, a paradise and a haven of salvation for those seeking to be saved&quot;). From that moment the mountain was consecrated as the garden of the Mother of God and was out of bounds to all other women.

Historical documents on ancient Mount Athos history are very few. Monks have certainly been there since the fourth century, and possibly since the third. During Constantine I&#x27;s reign (324–337) both Christians and followers of traditional Greek religion were living there. During the reign of Julian (361–363), the churches of Mount Athos were destroyed, and Christians hid in the woods and inaccessible places.

Later, during Theodosius I&#x27;s reign (379–395), the temples of the traditional Greek religion were destroyed. The lexicographer Hesychius of Alexandria states that in the fifth century, there was still a temple and a statue of &quot;Zeus Athonite&quot;. After the Islamic conquest of Egypt in the seventh century, many Orthodox monks from the Egyptian desert tried to find another calm place; some of them came to the Athos peninsula. An ancient document states that monks &quot;built huts of wood with roofs of straw ... and by collecting fruit from the wild trees were providing themselves improvised meals.&quot;

=== Byzantine era and onwards ===

<text>The Marsi were an Italic people of ancient Italy, whose chief centre was Marruvium, on the eastern shore of Lake Fucinus (which was drained in the time of Claudius). The area in which they lived is now called Marsica. They originally spoke a language now termed Marsian which is attested by several inscriptions.

==History==

The Marsi were first mentioned as members of a confederacy with the Vestini, Paeligni and Marrucini. They joined the Samnites in 308 BC, and, on their submission, became allies of Rome in 304 BC. After a short-lived revolt two years later, for which they were punished by the loss of territory, they were readmitted to the Roman alliance and remained faithful down to the Social War, their contingent being always regarded as the flower of the Italian forces.

The Latin colony of Alba Fucens near the northwest corner of the lake was founded in the adjoining Aequian territory in 303 BC so that, from the beginning of the 3rd century, the Marsians were in touch with a Latin-speaking community, to say nothing of the Latin colony of Carsioli farther west. The earliest pure Latin inscriptions of the district seem to be C.I.L. IX 3827 and 3848 from the neighbourhood of Supinum; its character generally is of the Gracchan period, though it might be somewhat earlier.

In the Social War (91–87 BC) which, owing to the prominence of the Marsian rebels, is often known as the Marsic War, they fought bravely against odds under their leader Q. Pompaedius Silo and, though they were frequently defeated, the result of the war was the enfranchisement of the allies. All the coins of Pompaedius Silo have the Latin legend &quot;Italia&quot;, while the other leaders in all but one case used Oscan.

==Religion==

The sanctuary of Lucus Angitiae, the chief temple and grove of the goddess Angitia stood at the southwest corner of Lake Fucinus, near the inlet to the tunnel of Claudius and the village of Luco dei Marsi. Angitia was widely worshipped in the central highlands as a goddess of healing, especially skilled to cure serpent bites by charms and the herbs of the Marsian woods, which was carried out by local inhabitants until modern times. Their country was considered by Rome to be the home of witchcraft.

<doc id="158366" wikidata="Q152880" url="?curid=158366" title="Iannis Xenakis">
<text>Giannis Klearchou Xenakis (also spelled for professional purposes as Yannis or Iannis Xenakis; , ; 29 May 1922 – 4 February 2001) was a Romanian-born Greek-French avant-garde composer, music theorist, architect, performance director and engineer.

After 1947, he fled Greece, becoming a naturalised citizen of France eighteen years later. Xenakis pioneered the use of mathematical models in music such as applications of set theory, stochastic processes and game theory and was also an important influence on the development of electronic and computer music. He integrated music with architecture, designing music for pre-existing spaces, and designing spaces to be integrated with specific music compositions and performances.

Among his most important works are &quot;Metastaseis&quot; (1953–54) for orchestra, which introduced independent parts for every musician of the orchestra; percussion works such as &quot;Psappha&quot; (1975) and &quot;Pléïades&quot; (1979); compositions that introduced spatialization by dispersing musicians among the audience, such as &quot;Terretektorh&quot; (1966); electronic works created using Xenakis&#x27;s UPIC system; and the massive multimedia performances Xenakis called &quot;polytopes&quot;, that were a summa of his interests and skills.

Among the numerous theoretical writings he authored, the book &quot;Formalized Music: Thought and Mathematics in Composition&quot; (French edition 1963, English translation 1971) is regarded as one of his most important publications. As an architect, Xenakis is primarily known for his early work under Le Corbusier: the priory of Sainte-Marie de La Tourette, on which the two collaborated, and the Philips Pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World&#x27;s Fair (Expo 58), which Xenakis designed by himself.

== Life ==

=== 1922–47: early years ===
Giannis Klearchou Xenakis was born in Brăila, Romania—which at the time had a large Greek community, as the eldest son of Greek parents; Klearchos Xenakis, a businessman from Euboea who was managing director of an English export-import agency and one of the richest men in the city, and Fotini Pavlou from Lemnos, a pianist who also spoke German and French. His two younger brothers were Jason, who became a philosophy professor in the United States and Greece, and , an architect, urban planner and artist.

His parents were both interested in music, and it was Pavlou who encouraged the young child to learn more about it: the young Giannis was given a flute by his mother, and the family visited the Bayreuth Festival several times, due to his father&#x27;s interest in opera. Her early death in 1927, when Xenakis was five years old, was a traumatic experience that, in his own words, &quot;deeply scarred&quot; the future composer. She had previously been infected from measles and died after giving birth to a stillborn daughter.

He was subsequently educated by a series of English, French, and German governesses, and then, in 1932, sent to Greece to study at the Anargyrio-Korgialenio boarding school on the Aegean island of Spetses. He excelled in both academics and athletics and sang in the school&#x27;s boys&#x27; choir, where the repertoire included works by Palestrina, and Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;, which Xenakis memorized in its entirety.

It was also at the Spetses school that Xenakis studied notation and solfège, being introduced to the music of Ludwig van Beethoven and Johannes Brahms and became enamoured of Greek traditional and church music. At the same time, he discovered the writer Homer and had a habit of visiting museums.

In 1938, after graduating from the school, Xenakis moved to Athens to prepare for entrance exams at its National Technical University, also studying Ancient Greek. He was encouraged by his friends and family to do so due to his interests in physics and mathematics. Although he intended to study architecture and engineering, he also took lessons in harmony and counterpoint with Aristotelis Koundouroff. In 1940, he successfully passed the exams, but his studies were cut short by the Greco-Italian War, which began with the Italian invasion on 28 October 1940. Although Greece eventually won the war, it was not long before the German army joined the Italians in the Battle of Greece, in April 1941.

This led to the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II, which lasted until late 1944, when the Allies began their drive across Europe, forcing the Axis forces to withdraw. Xenakis joined the National Liberation Front early during the war, participating in mass protests and demonstrations, and later becoming part of armed resistance — this last step was a painful experience Xenakis refused to discuss until much later in life.

After the Axis forces left, Churchill ordered that British forces step in to help restore the Greek monarchy; they were opposed by the Democratic Army of Greece, and the country plunged into a civil war. In December 1944, during the period of Churchill&#x27;s martial law, Xenakis (who was by then a member of the communist students&#x27; company of the left-wing &quot;Lord Byron&quot; faction of ELAS) became involved in street fighting against British tanks. He was wounded and facially disfigured when shrapnel from a tank blast hit his cheek and left eye, which was blinded; the fact that Xenakis survived the injury has been described as a miracle.

The Technical University operated intermittently during these years. Despite this, and Xenakis&#x27;s other activities, he was able to graduate in 1947, with a degree in civil engineering.

Xenakis was then conscripted into the national armed forces. Around 1947 the Greek government began arresting former resistance members that were left-wing oriented and sending them to prison. Xenakis, fearing for his life, went into hiding. With the help of his father and others, he fled Greece through Italy by using a fake passport. On 11 November 1947 he arrived in Paris. In a late interview, Xenakis admitted to feeling tremendous guilt at leaving his country, and that guilt was one of the sources of his later devotion to music:
For years I was tormented by guilt at having left the country for which I&#x27;d fought. I left my friends—some were in prison, others were dead, some managed to escape. I felt I was in debt to them and that I had to repay that debt. And I felt I had a mission. I had to do something important to regain the right to live. It wasn&#x27;t just a question of music—it was something much more significant.
In the meantime, in Greece he was sentenced in absentia to death by the right-wing administration. The sentence was commuted to ten years&#x27; imprisonment in 1951, and only lifted some 23 years later, after the fall of the Greek junta in 1974. He later returned the same year.

=== 1947–59: architecture and music ===
Although he was an illegal immigrant in Paris, Xenakis was able to get a job at Le Corbusier&#x27;s architectural studio. He worked as an engineering assistant at first, but quickly rose to performing more important tasks, and eventually to collaborating with Le Corbusier on major projects. These included a kindergarten on the roof of an apartment block in Nantes (Rezé), the Unité d&#x27;Habitation of Nantes-Rezé, parts of government buildings in Chandigarh, India, the &quot;undulatory glass surfaces&quot; of Sainte Marie de La Tourette, a Dominican priory in a valley near Lyon, and the Philips Pavilion at Expo 58—the latter project was completed by Xenakis alone from a basic sketch by Le Corbusier. The experience Xenakis gained played a major role in his music: important early compositions such as &quot;Metastaseis&quot; (1953–54) were based directly on architectural concepts. At the same time, he dropped the &quot;G&quot; from his professional name to get the name he is most commonly known by, &quot;Iannis&quot;.

At the same time, while working for Le Corbusier, Xenakis was studying harmony and counterpoint, and composing. He worked long and hard, frequently far into the night, and sought guidance from a number of teachers, most of whom, however, ultimately rejected him. Such was the case with Nadia Boulanger, who was the first person Xenakis approached about lessons. He then tried studying with Arthur Honegger, whose reaction to Xenakis&#x27;s music was unenthusiastic. As Xenakis recounted in a 1987 interview, Honegger dismissed a piece which included parallel fifths and octaves as &quot;not music&quot;. Xenakis, who was by that time well acquainted with music of Debussy, Béla Bartók, and Stravinsky, all of whom used such devices and much more experimental ones, was furious and left to study with Darius Milhaud, but these lessons also proved fruitless. Annette Dieudonné, a close friend of Boulanger&#x27;s, then recommended that Xenakis try studying with Olivier Messiaen. Xenakis approached Messiaen for advice on whether he once again start studying harmony and counterpoint. Messiaen later recalled:
I understood straight away that he was not someone like the others. [...] He is of superior intelligence. [...] I did something horrible which I should do with no other student, for I think one should study harmony and counterpoint. But this was a man so much out of the ordinary that I said... No, you are almost thirty, you have the good fortune of being Greek, of being an architect and having studied special mathematics. Take advantage of these things. Do them in your music.

Francisco Estévez has described this work as &quot;mathematical formulas translated . . . into beautiful, exciting, and above all, convincing music.&quot;

Xenakis regularly attended Messiaen&#x27;s classes from 1951 until 1953. Messiaen and his students studied music from a wide range of genres and styles, with particular attention to rhythm. Xenakis&#x27;s compositions from 1949 until 1952 were mostly inspired by Greek folk melodies, as well as Bartók, Ravel, and others; after studying with Messiaen, he discovered serialism and gained a deep understanding of contemporary music (Messiaen&#x27;s other pupils at the time included Karlheinz Stockhausen and Jean Barraqué, among others). Messiaen&#x27;s modal serialism was an influence on Xenakis&#x27;s first large-scale work, &quot;Anastenaria&quot; (1953–54): a triptych for choir and orchestra based on an ancient Dionysian ritual. The third part of the triptych, &quot;Metastaseis&quot;, is generally regarded as the composer&#x27;s first mature piece; it was detached from the triptych to mark the beginning of the &quot;official&quot; Xenakis oeuvre. He was considered to be part of the Darmstadt School, but later broke with the group of composers, who he believed focused too heavily on serialism and controlling all aspects of composition. In an article titled “The Crisis of Serial Music” he specifically accused Boulez and Stockhausen of steering music into a dead end.

On 3 December 1953, Xenakis married the journalist and writer Françoise Gargouïl, whom he met in 1950. Their daughter Mâkhi, who later became a painter and sculptor, was born in 1956 in Paris. In late 1954, with Messiaen&#x27;s support, Xenakis was accepted into the Groupe de Recherches de Musique Concrète; an organization established by Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Henry, dedicated to studying and producing electronic music of the musique concrète variety. Shortly after that Xenakis met conductor Hermann Scherchen, who was immediately impressed by the score of &quot;Metastaseis&quot; and offered his support. Although Scherchen did not premiere that particular work, he did give performances of later pieces by Xenakis, and the relationship between the conductor and the composer was of vital importance for the latter.

By the late 1950s Xenakis slowly started gaining recognition in artistic circles. In 1957, he received his first composition award, from the European Cultural Foundation, and in 1958 the first official commission came through, from Service de Recherche of Radio France. In the same year, he produced a musique concrète piece, &quot;Concret PH&quot;, for the Philips Pavilion. In 1960, Xenakis was well known enough to receive a commission from UNESCO for a soundtrack for a documentary film by Enrico Fulchignoni.

=== Later life ===
After leaving Le Corbusier&#x27;s studio in 1959, Xenakis supported himself by composition and teaching, and quickly became recognized as one of the most important European composers of his time. In 1965, he became a French citizen. He became especially known for his musical research in the field of computer-assisted composition, for which he founded the Equipe de Mathématique et Automatique Musicales (EMAMu) in 1966 (known as CEMAMu: Centre d’Etudes de Mathématique et Automatique Musicales, since 1972). He taught at Indiana University from 1967 until 1972 (and established a studio similar to EMAMu there), and worked as visiting professor at the Sorbonne from 1973 until 1989.

Xenakis frequently lectured (for instance, from 1975 to 1978 he was Professor of Music at Gresham College, London, giving free public lectures), and teaching composition. His works were performed at numerous festivals worldwide, including the Shiraz Arts Festival in Iran. His notable students include Pascal Dusapin, Henning Lohner, Miguel Ángel Coria, Susan Frykberg, Norma Tyer, Robert Carl, and Julio Estrada. In 1983, he was elected as a member of the Académie Française.

In addition to composing and teaching, Xenakis also wrote a number of articles and essays on music. Of these, &quot;Formalized Music&quot; (1963) became particularly known and was later expanded into a full book. A collection of texts on applications of stochastic processes, game theory and computer programming in music, it was later revised, expanded and translated into English as &quot;Formalized Music: Thought and Mathematics in Composition&quot; (1971) during Xenakis&#x27;s tenure at Indiana University.

Xenakis was an atheist. Polish musicologist Zbigniew Skowron, describing &quot;Aïs&quot;, wrote &quot;In accordance with his atheist views, Xenakis emphasizes the finality of death as the ultimate event of human life, and this is probably why wild shrieks and moans punctuate his score&quot;. Xenakis himself wrote, &quot;Man is one, indivisible, and total. He thinks with his belly and feels with his mind. I would like to propose what, to my mind, covers the term &quot;music&quot;: ... 7. It is a mystical (but atheistic) asceticism ...&quot;.

Xenakis completed his last work, &quot;O-mega&quot; for percussion soloist and chamber orchestra, in 1997. His health had been getting progressively worse over the years, and by 1997 he was no longer able to work. In 1999, Xenakis was awarded the Polar Music Prize &quot;for a long succession of forceful works, charged with sensitivity, commitment and passion, through which he has come to rank among the most central composers of our century in the realm of art music, exercising within its various fields an influence which cannot be readily overstated&quot;.

After several years of serious illness, on 1 February 2001 the composer lapsed into a coma. He died in his Paris home four days later, on 4 February, aged 78; and was shortly after cremated, with his ashes being given to his family.

Specific examples of mathematics, statistics, and physics applied to music composition are the use of the statistical mechanics of gases in &quot;Pithoprakta&quot;, statistical distribution of points on a plane in &quot;Diamorphoses&quot;, minimal constraints in &quot;Achorripsis&quot;, the normal distribution in &quot;ST/10&quot; and &quot;Atrées&quot;, Markov chains in &quot;Analogique&quot;, game theory in &quot;Duel&quot;, &quot;Stratégie&quot;, and &quot;Linaia-agon&quot;, group theory in &quot;Nomos Alpha&quot; (for Siegfried Palm), set theory in &quot;Herma&quot; and &quot;Eonta&quot;, and Brownian motion in &quot;N&#x27;Shima&quot;. &quot;Persephassa&quot;, commissioned by the Shiraz Arts Festival, was performed by Les Percussions de Strasbourg, receiving its world premiere in Persepolis in 1969. Subsequently, he was once again commissioned by the Shiraz Arts Festival and composed &quot;Persepolis&quot; for the occasion, a &quot;polytope&quot; composed specific to the historic site.

Although electroacoustic compositions represent only a small fraction of Xenakis&#x27;s output, they are highly relevant to musical thinking in the late 20th century. Important works in this medium include &quot;Concret PH&quot; (1958), &quot;Analogique B&quot; (1958–59), &quot;Bohor&quot; (1962), &quot;La légende d&#x27;Eer&quot; (1977), &quot;Mycenae-Alpha&quot; (1978), &quot;Voyage absolu des Unari vers Andromède&quot; (1989), &quot;Gendy301&quot; (1991), and &quot;S709&quot; (1994).

By 1979, he had devised a computer system called UPIC, which could translate graphical images into musical results. &quot;Xenakis had originally trained as an architect, so some of his drawings, which he called &#x27;arborescences&#x27;, resembled both organic forms and architectural structures.&quot; These drawings&#x27; various curves and lines that could be interpreted by UPIC as real time instructions for the sound synthesis process. The drawing is, thus, rendered into a composition. &quot;Mycenae-Alpha&quot; was the first of these pieces he created using UPIC as it was being perfected.

Xenakis also developed a stochastic synthesizer algorithm (used in GENDY), called &quot;dynamic stochastic synthesis&quot;, where a polygonal waveform&#x27;s sectional borders&#x27; amplitudes and distance between borders may be generated using a form of random walk to create both aleatoric timbres and musical forms. Further material may be generated by then refeeding the original waveform back into the function or wave forms may be superimposed. Elastic barriers or mirrors are used to keep the randomly generated values within a given finite interval, so as to not exceed limits such as the audible pitch range, avoid complete chaos (white noise), and to create a balance between stability and instability (unity and variety).

Despite Xenakis&#x27;s reputation as a &quot;mathematical&quot; composer, his works are known for their power and physicality. Alex Ross wrote that Xenakis &quot;produced some of the rawest, wildest music in history—sounds that explode around the ears. Rarefied methods were employed to release primordial energies.&quot; Ben Watson expressed admiration for the &quot;terrifying emotional impact of [Xenakis&#x27;] sonic objectivity&quot;, describing his music as possessing &quot;truly majestic otherness. It is an alien shard, glimmering in the heart of the West.&quot;

Tom Service praised Xenakis&#x27; music for its &quot;shattering visceral power&quot; and &quot;sheer, scintillating physicality&quot;, noting its &quot;deep, primal rootedness in richer and older phenomena even than musical history: the physics and patterning of the natural world, of the stars, of gas molecules, and the proliferating possibilities of mathematical principles.&quot; Service described Xenakis as a composer &quot;whose craggily, joyously elemental music turned collections of pitches and rhythms and instruments into a force of nature, releasing a power that previous composers had only suggested metaphorically but which he would realise with arguably greater clarity, ferocity, intensity than any musician, before or since,&quot; and suggested that his music is &quot;expressive: not in a conventionally emotional way, perhaps, but it has an ecstatic, cathartic power. Xenakis&#x27;s music – and its preternaturally brilliant performers – allows its listeners to witness seismic events close at hand, to be at the middle of a musical happening of cosmic intensity.&quot; Service concluded: &quot;it took Xenakis for music to become nature. On holiday in Corsica, Xenakis would pilot his canoe into the teeth of the biggest storm he and his paddle could manage. When you&#x27;re listening to his music, you also go out there into the eye of a musical storm that will invigorate, inspire, and awe. See you out there...&quot;

He was introduced in the first novel of the series, 1965&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot;, and became a breakout character. He was revived in 1969&#x27;s &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;. He is the only character to feature in all six of Herbert&#x27;s original &quot;Dune&quot; novels.

Idaho was portrayed by Richard Jordan in David Lynch&#x27;s 1984 film version of &quot;Dune&quot;, and by James Watson in the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries. Edward Atterton assumed the role in the 2003 miniseries &quot;Children of Dune&quot;. The character is played by Jason Momoa in the 2021 Denis Villeneuve film &quot;Dune&quot;.

==Description==
In &quot;Dune&quot; (1965), Duncan is described as a handsome man with &quot;curling black hair&quot; to whom women are easily attracted. Paul Atreides notes Duncan&#x27;s &quot;dark round face&quot; and &quot;feline movements, the swiftness of reflex that made him such a difficult weapons teacher to emulate.&quot; And in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; (1969) he is described as having &quot;high cheekbones&quot; and &quot;definite epicanthic folds.&quot; Lady Jessica calls him &quot;the admirable fighting man whose abilities at guarding and surveillance are so esteemed.&quot; Duncan is fiercely loyal to House Atreides, a skilled pilot, and as a Swordmaster of the Ginaz is a gifted hand-to-hand fighter. In the fight that ends with his death in &quot;Dune&quot;, Duncan kills an unheard-of 19 Sardaukar, the Padishah Emperor&#x27;s fearsome supersoldiers. The Sardaukar sell his body to the Tleilaxu; subsequent gholas of Duncan possess the rebellious streak of the original.

In 1976&#x27;s &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, Lady Jessica tells Duncan that he was drawn to her daughter Alia because &quot;you wanted a girl you saw as a younger version of me.&quot; In &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot; (1981), the latest Duncan ghola discovers that one of his predecessors had fathered a child with a woman named Irti who closely resembles Jessica.

===&quot;Dune&quot;===
At the time of Frank Herbert&#x27;s original novel &quot;Dune&quot; (1965), Idaho is a Swordmaster of the Ginaz in the service of House Atreides and one of Duke Leto&#x27;s right-hand men (with Gurney Halleck and Thufir Hawat). When the Atreides take over the planet Arrakis at the order of the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, Idaho becomes Leto&#x27;s ambassador to the Fremen, the desert people of Dune that Leto hopes will ally with him in the coming war against the Emperor and the Harkonnens. Idaho goes to live with the Fremen, serving both Leto and Fremen leader Stilgar. When the Emperor&#x27;s dreaded Sardaukar attack Arrakis in the guise of Harkonnen troops, Idaho initially survives the assault and saves Leto&#x27;s son Paul Atreides and concubine Lady Jessica. When they are cornered at a Botanical Testing Station, Paul and Jessica flee while Idaho holds off the enemy, but he is ultimately killed. It is noted in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; (1969) that a &quot;grievous head wound&quot; had caused Idaho&#x27;s death, and made clear in &quot;Children of Dune&quot; (1976) that Idaho had killed an unheard-of tally of nineteen Sardaukar before dying.

===&quot;Dune Messiah&quot; and &quot;Children of Dune&quot;===

Idaho returns in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; (1969) as a ghola named Hayt, made by the Tleilaxu and given to Paul Atreides, now Emperor. The purpose of the gift is &#x27;psychic poison&#x27;: the ghola is trained to tempt the Kwisatz Haderach Paul into becoming that which he despises. Trained as a Mentat and a Zensunni philosopher, Hayt has no memory of his former life, but constantly feels vague hints and reminders of his previous incarnation that make him hope he can recover those memories.

The seemingly harmless dwarf Bijaz recognizes that Hayt is failing to destroy the Emperor psychologically. As the ghola is of Tleilaxu design, Bijaz employs a specific humming intonation that renders Hayt open to implanted commands. Bijaz programs Hayt to kill Paul when he says the words &quot;She is gone,&quot; in the depths of grief over the death of his concubine Chani. But this is only part of the true plan; the emotional distress of the attempt allows Hayt to recover the buried memories of Duncan Idaho, up to and including his death at the hands of the Imperial Sardaukar. This is the culmination of the Tleilaxu plot, as masterminded by the Face Dancer Scytale—to demonstrate to Paul that the Tleilaxu can create for him an exact duplicate of Chani—but only if he abdicates his throne and relinquishes his CHOAM holdings. Paul resists the temptation, killing Scytale himself and having Hayt/Duncan kill Bijaz.

Also in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, hints are dropped of a growing attraction between Idaho and Paul&#x27;s sister, Alia. In one scene, Duncan even kisses Alia, which infuriates her; he replies that he took no more than what was offered. When a blinded Paul abdicates and wanders into the desert to die (as is the tradition for blind Fremen), Alia asks Idaho for his continued support and affection to help her get through the times ahead.

In 1976&#x27;s &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, Idaho is now Alia&#x27;s husband and Mentat. She has assumed power as Holy Regent in the name of Paul&#x27;s children, Leto II and Ghanima. Alia becomes possessed by the memory-ego of her ancestor, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, who sets out to destroy the Atreides empire. Recognizing this, Idaho remains loyal to the Atreides, and flees to the desert to protect the children. In order to get Stilgar to join the Fremen opposition to Alia&#x27;s rule, Duncan kills Javid, Alia&#x27;s secret lover, on the neutral ground of Sietch Tabr. He also insults Stilgar three times, by saying to him the three deadliest insults a Fremen could ever hear: &quot;You wear a collar!&quot;, &quot;You are a servant! You&#x27;ve sold Fremen for their water!&quot; and &quot;You have no immortality! None of your descendents carry your blood!&quot; Duncan then allows himself to be struck down by an enraged Stilgar, who realizes afterward that Alia would be forced by political necessity to execute him and his only hope of survival is to join the Fremen rebels—which is what Duncan had planned from the beginning. Duncan&#x27;s last gasping words were, &quot;Two deaths for the Atreides. The second for no better reason than the first.&quot;

===&quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot;===
&quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot; (1981) reintroduces Idaho as a serial ghola: Leto II has ruled as a sandworm-human hybrid for 3,500 years, and has continually had an Idaho ghola to serve him. Beyond his personal affection for Idaho, to Leto, Idaho represents loyalty, humanity, and the spirit of the unknown, something which the God Emperor, having perfect prescience, knows nothing of. It is also implied that Duncan is needed for Leto&#x27;s plan for humanity&#x27;s ultimate survival — called the Golden Path — to come to fruition. However, the Idaho gholas, with their memories restored, struggle to deal with what the Atreides have become. Where before, the hallmark of Atreides rule was justice, Leto&#x27;s reign has been one of godhood and oppression. Idaho&#x27;s old-fashioned conscience rebels, leading the Idaho ghola to attempt to kill Leto (who as a sandworm is invulnerable to all but water and extreme violence). Leto notes that only nineteen of &quot;his&quot; Duncans have survived long enough to die what is considered a &quot;natural death.&quot; In just about all of these rebellions, the Idaho ghola is killed by the God Emperor. After a certain time, the God Emperor orders another one from the Tleilaxu, or the Tleilaxu themselves just send another one as a token for their security.

The novel chronicles the perceptions and actions of a new Duncan that has just been ordered from the Tleilaxu. Like the others before him, Duncan is appalled at what Atreides rule has become, but Leto appoints him as the head of his otherwise all-female military, the Fish Speakers. Leto also reveals that he has repeatedly used his Duncan gholas in his breeding program to genetically improve the Atreides line. The current Duncan is intended to mate with Siona Atreides, the end product of Leto&#x27;s breeding program: she is invisible to prescient sight. Duncan is extremely reluctant and protests, saying that he is not Leto&#x27;s stud. He does catch the eye of Hwi Noree, the Ixian Ambassador sent to Arrakis with the explicit purpose of wooing the Emperor. Leto forbids Duncan from having any relations with her, but he disobeys and sleeps with Hwi.

Duncan eventually joins Siona&#x27;s rebels and works with her to assassinate Leto. His plan is successful, but Hwi is killed in the process. Leto reveals that he knew of their plan, and that his death is simply another step to ensuring the Golden Path. Siona, having seen the Golden Path during her trial in the desert, realizes she was bred as a key figure for humanity&#x27;s survival. At the end of the novel, she schemes on how to carefully seduce Duncan and mate with him, as Leto had originally intended. None of their descendants will be able to be tracked by prescience, forever free of any one person&#x27;s vision and ensuring that humanity could never be completely found and destroyed.

Fifteen hundred years later in &quot;&quot; (1985), the Bene Gesserit Bellonda assesses the many Duncans who came before:
In the original and early gholas, his character had been dominated by impulsiveness. Quick to hate, quick to give loyalty. Later Idaho-gholas tempered this with cynicism but the underlying impulsiveness remained. The Tyrant had called it to action many times. Bellonda recognized a pattern. He can be goaded by pride. His long service to the Tyrant fascinated her. Not only had he been a Mentat several times but there was evidence he had been a Truthsayer in more than one incarnation.

Although a third party work not connected to the main Dune series, but endorsed by Herbert in his lifetime, &quot;The Dune Encyclopedia&quot; provides some background on the characteristics, personalities, and often gruesome deaths of 17 additional Duncans from the time before the Duncan that is the focus of &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot;, further noting that there were &quot;well over seventy Duncans&quot;.

===&quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; and &quot;Chapterhouse: Dune&quot;===
The Bene Gesserit become the consumers of Idaho gholas in &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; (1984) and &quot;Chapterhouse: Dune&quot; (1985). However, the gholas are repeatedly assassinated after several years, and the Sisterhood suspect the Tleilaxu. Not knowing exactly what purpose Idaho will serve, the Bene Gesserit believe that the Tleilaxu are using the gholas to control the timing of his release upon the universe, implying some Tleilaxu purpose in addition to their own. The current ghola survives such an attempt and Miles Teg is able to restore the memories of Duncan Idaho to the ghola, but Duncan can feel that the Tleilaxu planted something else in his mind. When Murbella, an Honored Matre, tries to sexually bond Idaho, he entraps and enslaves her, revealing the Tleilaxu purpose: To conquer the Honored Matres by using a better version of their own sexual techniques. When Murbella tries to bond Duncan, the Tleilaxu&#x27;s plan comes to fruition, and he becomes aware of the memories of all the other Idaho gholas, though he is also imprinted to her. It is later determined that the Tleilaxu had mixed the cells from almost all of the Idaho gholas to make this one. Idaho and Murbella are confined to a no-ship on Chapterhouse. There, Idaho trains young men to go out into the universe and enslave Honored Matres. Duncan also inherits an awkward prescient vision, wherein he sees an old man and woman staring back at him. Duncan retrieves the Miles Teg ghola, and Sheeana Burg who escape in the no-ship, evading the trap set for him by the strange couple.

===&quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot;===
Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson continued from the original series with &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; (2006) and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; (2007), originally planned to be &quot;Dune 7&quot; by Frank Herbert. Duncan continues his travels on the no-ship, now named the &quot;Ithaca&quot; by its passengers. He is accompanied by Miles Teg, Sheeana and a group of her Bene Gesserit sisters, the last Tleilaxu Master Scytale, and many others.

Duncan and the other refugees from Chapterhouse are still on the run from the Unknown Enemy that hunts them. They don&#x27;t learn until near the end that the Enemy is the revived empire of thinking machines, and the old couple are actually the computer-entity Omnius and the robot Erasmus. In the final confrontation with Omnius, Paul Atreides (brought back as a ghola and with his power of prescience just restored), and then Norma Cenva (the Oracle of Time to the Navigators), both reveal that Duncan is the Ultimate Kwisatz Haderach; not Paul (who is an &quot;imperfect&quot; Kwisatz Haderach) nor any other Atreides, nor their descendants. Overwhelmed by the unexpected revelations, Duncan decides to unite humanity and the thinking machines—after Cenva permanently removes Omnius from existence—rather than bring about the absolute destruction of intelligent technology for the second time in history.

Assuming the responsibility of mediator between the two sides, and with Erasmus&#x27; willing participation (the robot being left as the leader and controlling-force of the thinking machines), Duncan does something similar to Bene Gesserit Sharing with the robot; possibly along with what seems to be a physical-bonding (similar to what Leto II did with the sandtrout) into something of a human-machine hybrid. Erasmus then voluntarily &quot;dies&quot;, while remaining an Other Memory speaking to Duncan. In addition to being the Final Kwisatz Haderach of the humans, Duncan becomes the new evermind of the thinking machines, guiding their joint future.

===&quot;Prelude to Dune&quot;===
According to the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; prequel trilogy (1999–2001) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, Duncan Idaho is born on the planet Giedi Prime, under the Harkonnen Regime. His hatred for the Harkonnens is established when, at eight years of age, his parents are murdered in front of him by Glossu Rabban. Rabban subsequently chooses young Idaho to be the prey for one of his hunts, but Idaho&#x27;s resourcefulness and the aid of a woman who wants to punish the Harkonnens enables him to escape Giedi Prime for the planet Caladan. Upon arriving at the Atreides palace, he becomes a stableboy at Duke Paulus Atreides&#x27; request. After Paulus&#x27; death, Idaho expresses his desire to become a Ginaz Swordmaster. In the trilogy&#x27;s second installment &quot;&quot;, Duncan undergoes the immense rigors needed to be a Swordmaster; he is promoted to the title, alongside a Grumman friend named Hiih Resser, and helps defeat a mob of insurgent students. At the time of &quot;&quot;, Duncan is an instrumental part of the liberation of the planet Ix from the Sardaukar and Tleilaxu, and even manages to defeat Count Hasimir Fenring in single combat.

==In adaptations==
In the 1984 film &quot;Dune&quot;, Duncan is played by Richard Jordan. Everett McGill, who portrays Stilgar in the film, said “I recall Richard Jordan as Duncan Idaho agreed to a smaller presence in &quot;Dune&quot; for the promise of the breakout character in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; and beyond.&quot; Though &quot;Dune II&quot;, a planned sequel film adapting &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, was never made, the unfinished script depicts Duncan being revived by Scytale.

James Watson portrays the character in the 2000 miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot;. In the 2003 miniseries sequel &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot;, the ghola of Duncan (known in the novels as &quot;Hayt&quot;) is played by Edward Atterton. Emmet Asher-Perrin of &quot;Tor.com&quot; writes that Atterton &quot;plays the mentat ghola reincarnation of Idaho with all the upright stoicism and vulnerability that the character is owed.&quot;

In the animated television show &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy,&quot; the 2003–04 season episode &quot;Mandy, the Merciless&quot; parodies &quot;God Emperor of Dune,&quot; with the character Billy as the repeatedly killed Duncan Idaho.

The character is played by Jason Momoa in the 2021 film &quot;Dune&quot;. He is expected to reprise the role in the film adaptation of &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;.

<text>John Edensor Littlewood (9 June 1885 – 6 September 1977) was a British mathematician. He worked on topics relating to analysis, number theory, and differential equations and had lengthy collaborations with G. H. Hardy, Srinivasa Ramanujan and Mary Cartwright.

==Biography ==
Littlewood was born on the 9th of June 1885 in Rochester, Kent, the eldest son of Edward Thornton Littlewood and Sylvia Maud (née Ackland). In 1892, his father accepted the headmastership of a school in Wynberg, Cape Town, in South Africa, taking his family there. Littlewood returned to Britain in 1900 to attend St Paul&#x27;s School in London, studying under Francis Sowerby Macaulay, an influential algebraic geometer.

In 1903, Littlewood entered the University of Cambridge, studying in Trinity College. He spent his first two years preparing for the Tripos examinations which qualify undergraduates for a bachelor&#x27;s degree where he emerged in 1905 as Senior Wrangler bracketed with James Mercer (Mercer had already graduated from the University of Manchester before attending Cambridge). In 1906, after completing the second part of the Tripos, he started his research under Ernest Barnes. One of the problems that Barnes suggested to Littlewood was to prove the Riemann hypothesis, an assignment at which he did not succeed. He was elected a Fellow of Trinity College in 1908. From October 1907 to June 1910, he worked as a Richardson Lecturer in the School of Mathematics at the University of Manchester before returning to Cambridge in October 1910, where he remained for the rest of his career. He was appointed Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics in 1928, retiring in 1950. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1916, awarded the Royal Medal in 1929, the Sylvester Medal in 1943, and the Copley Medal in 1958. He was president of the London Mathematical Society from 1941 to 1943 and was awarded the De Morgan Medal in 1938 and the Senior Berwick Prize in 1960.

Littlewood died on 6 September 1977.

==Work==
Most of Littlewood&#x27;s work was in the field of mathematical analysis. He began research under the supervision of Ernest William Barnes, who suggested that he attempt to prove the Riemann hypothesis: Littlewood showed that if the Riemann hypothesis is true, then the prime number theorem follows and obtained the error term. This work won him his Trinity fellowship. However, the link between the Riemann hypothesis and the prime number theorem had been known before in Continental Europe, and Littlewood wrote later in his book, &quot;A Mathematician&#x27;s Miscellany&quot; that his rediscovery of the result did not shed a positive light on the isolated nature of British mathematics at the time.

===Theory of the distribution of prime numbers===
In 1914, Littlewood published his first result in the field of analytic number theory concerning the error term of the prime-counting function. If denotes the number of primes up , then the prime number theorem implies that ,
where formula_1 is known as the Eulerian logarithmic integral.
Numerical evidence seemed to suggest that for all . Littlewood, however proved that the difference changes sign infinitely often.

===Collaboration with G. H. Hardy===
Littlewood collaborated for many years with G. H. Hardy. Together they devised the first Hardy–Littlewood conjecture, a strong form of the twin prime conjecture, and the second Hardy–Littlewood conjecture.

====Ramanujan====
He also, with Hardy, identified the work of the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan as that of a genius and supported him in travelling from India to work at Cambridge. A self-taught mathematician, Ramanujan later became a Fellow of the Royal Society, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and widely recognised as on a par with other geniuses such as Euler and Jacobi.

===Collaboration with Mary Cartwright===

In the late 1930s, as the prospect of war loomed, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research sought the interest of pure mathematicians in the properties of non linear differential equations that were needed by radio engineers and scientists. The problems appealed to Littlewood and Mary Cartwright, and they worked on them independently during the next 20 years.

The problems that Littlewood and Cartwright worked on concerned differential equations arising out of early research on radar: their work foreshadowed the modern theory of dynamical systems. Littlewood&#x27;s 4/3 inequality on bilinear forms was a forerunner of the later Grothendieck tensor norm theory.

==Military service WWI – ballistics work==
During the Great War, Littlewood served in the Royal Garrison Artillery as a second lieutenant. He made highly significant contributions in the field of ballistics.

==Later life==

He continued to write papers into his eighties, particularly in analytical areas of what would become the theory of dynamical systems.

Littlewood is also remembered for his book of reminiscences, &quot;A Mathematician&#x27;s Miscellany&quot; (new edition published in 1986).

Among his PhD students were Sarvadaman Chowla, Harold Davenport, and Donald C. Spencer. Spencer reported that in 1941 when he (Spencer) was about to get on the boat that would take him home to the United States, Littlewood reminded him: &quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;n&quot; alpha, &quot;n&quot; beta!&quot; (referring to Littlewood&#x27;s conjecture).

Littlewood&#x27;s collaborative work, carried out by correspondence, covered fields in Diophantine approximation and Waring&#x27;s problem, in particular. In his other work, he collaborated with Raymond Paley on Littlewood–Paley theory in Fourier theory, and with Cyril Offord in combinatorial work on random sums, in developments that opened up fields that are still intensively studied.

In a 1947 lecture, the Danish mathematician Harald Bohr said, &quot;To illustrate to what extent Hardy and Littlewood in the course of the years came to be considered as the leaders of recent English mathematical research, I may report what an excellent colleague once jokingly said: &#x27;Nowadays, there are only three really great English mathematicians: Hardy, Littlewood, and Hardy–Littlewood.&#x27;&quot; 

The German mathematician Edmund Landau supposed that Littlewood was a pseudonym that Hardy used for his lesser work and &quot;so doubted the existence of Littlewood that he made a special trip to Great Britain to see the man with his own eyes&quot;. He visited Cambridge where he saw much of Hardy but nothing of Littlewood and so considered his conjecture to be proven. A similar story was told about Norbert Wiener, who vehemently denied it in his autobiography. 

He coined Littlewood&#x27;s law, which states that individuals can expect &quot;miracles&quot; to happen to them at the rate of about one per month.

==Cultural references==
John Littlewood is depicted in two films covering the life of Ramanujan – &quot;Ramanujan&quot; in 2014 portrayed by Michael Lieber and &quot;The Man Who Knew Infinity&quot; in 2015 portrayed by Toby Jones.

<text>Kings Island is a amusement park northeast of Cincinnati in Mason, Ohio, United States. Owned and operated by Six Flags, the park was built by Taft Broadcasting and opened in 1972. It was part of a larger effort to move and expand Coney Island, a popular resort destination along the banks of the Ohio River that was prone to frequent flooding. After more than $300 million in capital investments over the years, the park has grown to feature over a hundred attractions including fifteen roller coasters and a water park.

Early in its history, Kings Island appeared in popular sitcoms and received widespread recognition for its record-breaking attractions and events. One of the park&#x27;s most well-known attractions, The Racer, is often credited with reviving worldwide interest in roller coasters during the 1970s. A variety of attractions over the years introduced notable milestones, and The Beast and Banshee are two that have set enduring world records. The largest single investment in park history is Orion, a $30-million giga coaster that opened in 2020. The park has also experienced a number of setbacks generating negative publicity, including the early demise of The Bat and Son of Beast roller coasters, both of which were problematic rides.

Kings Island is divided into nine themed sections and operates seasonally from early spring through Labor Day in the fall, followed by two additional holiday-themed events known as Halloween Haunt and Winterfest. Kings Island had an estimated 3.18 million guests in 2021, ranking third in attendance among seasonal amusement parks in North America behind sister parks Canada&#x27;s Wonderland and Cedar Point. In addition, Kings Island has won Golden Ticket Awards in the annual publication from &quot;Amusement Today&quot;, including &quot;Best Kids&#x27; Area&quot; in the world for eighteen consecutive years (2001–2018) and &quot;Best New Ride&quot; in 2017 for Mystic Timbers. In the same publication, The Beast consistently ranks as one of the top ten wooden coasters in the world.
==History==
Kings Island was conceived as early as 1964 when Coney Island, a popular amusement park east of downtown Cincinnati on the banks of the Ohio River, suffered from a major flood that submerged the area in over of water. Although occasional flooding was common at the successful park, the flood in 1964 was the fourth highest on record and caused considerable damage. Faced with already-limited space for expansion and parking, the event triggered discussions within the organization about relocating the park.

Leading the way was Gary Wachs, son of Coney Island president Ralph Wachs, who with friends and family owned a majority of stock. He decided it was time to relocate the park to stay competitive. After years of research and traveling abroad, he presented ideas for a new theme park to the company&#x27;s board of directors. Some board members opposed relocating, including significant stockholder Charles Sawyer. It wasn&#x27;t taken seriously until 1968 when actor Fess Parker announced plans to build a theme park in Northern Kentucky – well within Coney Island&#x27;s primary market that extended as far south as Louisville. The announcement highlighted the need for change and gave Wachs&#x27; proposal credibility within the organization.

Gary and Ralph met with Dudley S. Taft, president of Taft Broadcasting Company, to discuss a possible merger. Taft Broadcasting was interested in promoting its recently acquired Hanna-Barbera division, and in July 1969, the company purchased Coney Island for $6.5 million and in Warren County, Ohio, for $3.2 million. Kings Island still owned of that purchase . The site is located between I-71 and the Little Miami River in what was then a part of Deerfield Township. Following the purchase, Fess Parker&#x27;s efforts to secure financing fell apart along with his plans to build a competing theme park.

===Taft Broadcasting and KECO (1970–1992)===
Construction began on June 15, 1970. Later that year, a public contest was held to name the new park. &quot;Kings Island&quot; emerged the most popular, as the name was a nod to both the local Kings Mills area as well as the park&#x27;s predecessor Coney Island. Most of the rides at Coney Island were relocated, and much of what remained was demolished. The popular Sunlite Pool attraction continued to operate, however, and the park was partially restored years later.

Less than two years after breaking ground, Kings Island opened its gates to the public on April 29, 1972. It was the first of several preview events. The grand opening was held the following month on May 27, 1972.
One of the first signature attractions featured at the park was The Racer, a wooden roller coaster consisting of two trains that race side by side on identical tracks. Designed by legendary designer John C. Allen, who was convinced to come out of retirement, The Racer was the first of its kind in 35 years and played an integral part of the roller coaster renaissance of the 1970s. Decades later, it was distinguished as a Roller Coaster Landmark by American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE) in recognition for its historical significance. Other roller coasters present on opening day in 1972 were the Bavarian Beetle, a small steel coaster brought over from Coney Island, and a new junior wooden coaster in the Happy Land of Hanna-Barbera originally named Scooby Doo. The most expensive ride to open with the park was Enchanted Voyage, a $2-million dark ride attraction that featured over a hundred animatronic Hanna-Barbera characters.

Kings Island was nationally promoted in two well-known sitcoms: &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; in 1972 and &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; in 1973. Each filmed an episode on location at the park, which were later broadcast on ABC. The Brady Bunch was produced by Paramount Television, a large Taft Broadcasting shareholder. The park also held several world-record-breaking events. In 1974, 69-year-old Karl Wallenda set a world record for the longest tightrope skywalk at a distance of , which was performed off the ground. The following year, Evel Knievel successfully jumped fourteen Greyhound buses on his Harley Davidson at Kings Island, clearing a distance of . The jump set a world record that held until 1999. It was the longest successful jump of his career as well as his last major stunt, and the nationally televised event was broadcast live on ABC, landing 52 percent of the TV audience during that hour with an estimated 55 million viewers. Park executives favored the national exposure and additional revenue being generated by record-breaking, newsworthy events that kept the park at the forefront of the industry. To keep momentum going, Kings Island spent years researching and designing a mammoth roller coaster, The Beast, which opened in 1979 as the tallest, fastest, and longest wooden roller coaster in the world. It was designed and manufactured internally by the park.

On the heels of early success came turbulent times beginning in the 1980s. Kings Island partnered with Arrow Development, an amusement ride company well known for its work at Disneyland and Disney World, to develop a unique roller coaster concept. The Bat opened to the public in 1981 as the first modern-day, suspended roller coaster featuring an overhead track with train cars that swung freely from side to side, designed to simulate the feeling of flight. Although it was well received, it was plagued with design flaws and constant maintenance that resulted in frequent closures over its short, three-year history. To appease frustrated guests, the south track of The Racer began running its trains backward in 1982, which became so popular that the change remained until 2008. The park also pushed forward with its next major addition, King Cobra, which opened in 1984 as the first of its kind to be designed from inception as a stand-up roller coaster.

Kings Island also went through a series of ownership changes over the next decade. Taft sold its theme park division in 1984 for $167.5 million to Kings Entertainment Company (KECO), a company formed by senior executives and general managers of Taft Attractions Group. Three parks – Kings Island, Kings Dominion and Carowinds – were involved in the sale. Taft invested in KECO to retain one-third interest. Three years later in 1987, Kings Island was sold individually to American Financial Corporation, led by Carl Lindner. The deal included a contract with KECO to continue managing park operations. KECO, which retained ownership of the other two parks, also added Great America to its portfolio after purchasing it in 1989 from the city of Santa Clara, California.

===Paramount&#x27;s Kings Island (1992–2006)===
In 1992 Paramount Communications Inc. (formerly Gulf+Western) purchased KECO along with Kings Island from American Financial in a deal worth $400 million. Paramount formed a new division known as Paramount Parks. KECO owned 20% of Canada&#x27;s Wonderland, and Paramount bought out the remaining 80% stake in 1993, raising the total number of parks to five. Later that year, Paramount Parks began incorporating themes from its movies into each park. Viacom entered the picture after acquiring Paramount in 1994, paving the way for the inclusion of Nickelodeon themes. Nickelodeon Splat City, an interactive splash pad area, was added in 1995, which later evolved into Nickelodeon Central (2001) and eventually Nickelodeon Universe (2006).
In 1997, a year after leaving Deerfield Township, the city of Mason annexed most of Kings Island. A temporary measure allowed for some land to remain in Deerfield in an attempt to appease park officials and reduce the impact on the township. The rest would be annexed in 1999. In 2005, Viacom split into two companies, Viacom and CBS Corporation, with CBS inheriting Paramount Parks. CBS made the decision to sell its theme park division in January 2006. CBS CEO Leslie Moonves stated that despite the health and profitability of Paramount Parks, the business was &quot;one that just doesn&#x27;t fit our core strategy&quot;.

In 2000 Paramount revealed that they would build a giant record-breaking, 218-foot, looping roller coaster by the name Son of Beast. Son of Beast was built by RCCA (Roller Coaster Corporation of America) who was under qualified to build such a large roller coaster. Halfway through the Son of Beast project, RCCA was fired and Paramount finished the coaster themselves. This led to many problems with the structure and many incidents which eventually led to the coaster being closed in the Cedar Fair era in 2009. The plot of land was replaced with the Son of Beast ghost themed coaster, Banshee.

===Cedar Fair era (2006–2024)===
After receiving interest from several potential suitors, CBS announced the sale of Paramount Parks to Cedar Fair on June 30, 2006, for $1.24 billion. The acquisition of Kings Island gave Cedar Fair, who had recently acquired Geauga Lake from Six Flags in 2004, ownership of all three major amusement parks in Ohio. Part of the agreement allowed Kings Island to continue using Nickelodeon themes and characters for four years and other Paramount-related branding for ten years, with the option to extend the license on both.

Cedar Fair opted for a buyout option within an agreement clause to remove Paramount branding after one season. Beginning in 2008, &quot;Face/Off&quot; became Invertigo, &quot;The Italian Job Stunt Track&quot; became Backlot Stunt Coaster, &quot;Tomb Raider: The Ride&quot; became The Crypt and &quot;Top Gun&quot; became Flight Deck. Nickelodeon&#x27;s presence remained until the 2010 season, when Cedar Fair began incorporating its Peanuts theme throughout the park, primarily in the children&#x27;s area. Nickelodeon Universe was renamed Planet Snoopy to complete the transition.

In late 2009 the Mason City Council added a measure on its 2010 ballot that would mandate a 3-percent ticket tax and a 5-percent parking tax at both Kings Island and The Beach Waterpark. Council member Tony Bradburn argued that it was necessary for the city to help pay for infrastructure improvements, as well as cover police and fire expenses. The proposed tax hike was the center of debate for several months, as Kings Island actively encouraged the public to write, email, and call Mason City Council representatives to express opposition. On February 8, 2010, Mason City Council voted 5–1 against the measure.

A new themed area called Adventure Port was added in 2023, replacing part of Oktoberfest and adding two new family rides – Sol Spin and Cargo Loco. Through the 2024 season, Kings Island expanded Planet Snoopy with the addition of a new themed section called Camp Snoopy.

===Six Flags era (2024–present)===

On July 1, 2024, a merger of equals between Cedar Fair and Six Flags was completed. This merger created Six Flags Entertainment Corporation which encompasses all legacy Six flags and legacy Cedar Fair parks, including Kings Island.

==Areas and attractions==
Kings Island has invested more than $300 million in improvements since its grand opening in 1972, including the addition of new rides and attractions. The park originally opened with sixty attractions which grew to more than a hundred by 2017. The number of themed areas has also expanded from the original five – Coney Island (now Coney Mall), Happy Land of Hanna-Barbera (now Planet Snoopy), International Street, Oktoberfest, and Rivertown – to nine by 2024, including the latest additions of Area 72, Adventure Port and Camp Snoopy. A water park was added in 1989, and the number of employees required for park operations has grown from 1,300 to approximately 4,000.

===Action Zone===
Action Zone opened in 1974 as Lion Country Safari, a section of the park featuring a monorail ride that took guests on a safari-style tour through an animal preservation. This was part of a network of other safari-style zoos also called Lion Country Safari. It was later renamed Wild Animal Safari in 1977. In 1983, the area became known as Wild Animal Habitat and included Adventure Village, a new area within the rebranded section. Over the years, it featured rides such as Screamin&#x27; Demon (1977–1987), the first steel looping roller coaster to run both forward and backward in the United States, and King Cobra (1984–2001), a stand-up looping roller coaster that was the first of its kind in the world.

Early in its tenure after purchasing Kings Island, Paramount unveiled Top Gun, a suspended roller coaster from Arrow Dynamics, in 1993. Located next to the habitat attraction, it was titled after a film of the same name and was the first ride to be added to the park with a Paramount theme. The following year, the entire area was renamed Adventure Village coinciding with the removal of the animal habitat and monorail ride. In 1999, a two-year expansion initiative began with the area&#x27;s renaming to Action Zone and the addition of two new attractions – Drop Zone: Stunt Tower and Face/Off. When it debuted, Action Zone resembled a movie stunt set featuring a water tower as the centerpiece. The water tower was originally part of a skit with stunts and special effects that imitated a live movie set with a director and stunt performers.

Son of Beast opened in 2000, the second year of the area&#x27;s two-year expansion. It was the tallest and fastest wooden roller coaster in the world and the first of its kind to feature a vertical loop. As a result of a number of structural issues and two accidents, the ride closed permanently in 2009 and was eventually demolished in 2012. Other notable rides include Delirium, which opened in 2003 as the largest Giant Frisbee ride in the world, and Banshee, the world&#x27;s longest inverted roller coaster which opened in 2014 at the former location of Son of Beast.

===Adventure Port===
In 2023, Kings Island opened a newly themed area called Adventure Port, which introduced family rides Sol Spin and Cargo Loco. The area was previously a part of Oktoberfest and includes a mine train roller coaster called Adventure Express, which opened in 1991. Adventure Express received theming enhancements during the transition.
===Area 72===
Area 72, formerly known as X-Base, is an area themed as a secret aerospace research facility that features two roller coasters. The area first opened as a small subsection of Coney Mall when Flight of Fear was introduced in 1996. It expanded in 2007 following the addition of Firehawk and was labeled X-Base, a name only designated by a small sign in Coney Mall.

Firehawk closed in 2018 and was removed prior to the 2019 season. The park began leaking clues that implied a new ride would take its place, and in August 2019, the park unveiled plans to build Orion, the park&#x27;s first giga coaster, with park guests and press in attendance. The area, which received an updated theme and was added to the official park map for the first time, was renamed Area 72 for the 2020 season.

===Camp Snoopy===

The portion of the area that borders Rivertown was revamped in 1995 with the addition of a kids&#x27; play area, stage and water attraction, and the new sub-section was named &quot;Nickelodeon Splat City&quot;. In 2001, the log ride Kings Mills Log Flume was updated with a children&#x27;s theme and renamed The Wild Thornberrys River Adventure. The Rugrats Runaway Reptar family inverted roller coaster was introduced the same year. This expansion into an area that was originally part of Rivertown became known as &quot;Nickelodeon Central&quot;. Hanna-Barbera Land was gradually converted over the next several years and eventually renamed &quot;Nickelodeon Universe&quot; in 2006.

Following Cedar Fair&#x27;s purchase of the park from Paramount in 2006, Nickelodeon-themed elements were eventually removed and replaced with &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip themes in 2010 – the children&#x27;s brand marketed at other Cedar Fair parks.

For the 2024 season, Kings Island expanded Planet Snoopy, adding a new themed section called &quot;Camp Snoopy&quot;. It features a new family Boomerang roller coaster from Vekoma called Snoopy&#x27;s Soap Box Racers, as well as additional play areas and activities for families. Some attractions were also re-themed.


===Coney Mall===
When Kings Island first opened in 1972, a section of the park was dedicated to its predecessor, Coney Island. The area was constructed to resemble the former park&#x27;s carnival-style layout and featured many of its flat rides which were relocated, including Monster, Scrambler, and Dodgem. One of the new flagship attractions during the park&#x27;s inaugural year, The Racer, is located in this section. In addition to rides, some of Coney Island&#x27;s famous Ginkgo trees were transplanted, lining the middle of the walkway. Originally called Coney Island, the area was renamed Old Coney in 1980 and Coney Mall in 1986. The area also features game booths, arcades, and concession stands in the style of state fairs and traveling carnivals from the early twentieth century.

Zodiac, described as a &quot;spinning, climbing double ferris wheel&quot;, debuted in 1975 as one of only two of its kind in the United States. Brokered by Intamin and manufactured by Waagner-Biro, the three-minute ride featured twelve gondolas on each of the two wheels, which were mounted to a long, hydraulic arm. It was removed following the 1986 season and relocated to Wonderland Sydney, where it reopened in 1989. In the 1980s, flat rides Skylab (1986–1997) and Zephyr were added, along with a looping roller coaster named Vortex (1987–2019), which was the first in the world to feature six inversions.

Following Paramount&#x27;s acquisition of the park in 1992, Coney Mall was further expanded in 1994 with the addition of Days of Thunder, a NASCAR-themed motion simulator ride based on the 1990 film of the same name. The ride was housed within Action Theater located near The Racer&#x27;s turnaround, and it was later updated with different shows based on &quot;James Bond&quot;, &quot;SpongeBob&quot;, and other themes before its closure in 2013. A , three-minute swing ride called WindSeeker was added in 2011, which features two-person swing carriages that rotate around a central tower at a maximum speed of . For the 2019 season, an antique car ride called Kings Mill Antique Autos, designed to resemble the retired Les Taxis (1972–2004), returned to Coney Mall as a new attraction.

===International Street===
At the heart of the amusement park, visitors are greeted by International Street, which lies just beyond the main entrance. As one of the park&#x27;s original staples when it opened in 1972, International Street was designed by Bruce Bushman, a former Walt Disney Imagineering layout design artist. The area&#x27;s architecture and cultural themes represent Italy, Spain, Germany, and Switzerland. To save on the cost of construction, the second story of each building was designed on a three-quarters scale, borrowing from a practice used by Disney throughout its theme parks.

&quot;Enchanted Voyage&quot;, an Old Mill dark ride that ferried guests in unaccompanied boats along water-filled guideways, was also a primary attraction that opened with the park. Shaped like a large TV set, the building housed separately-themed areas that made heavy use of animatronic Hanna-Barbera characters. The ride was overhauled for the 1984 season when it became &quot;Smurf&#x27;s Enchanted Voyage&quot;. In 1992, the building was transformed once more into Phantom Theater, replacing the ride&#x27;s waterways with an Omnimover-style system of transport. It was themed as a behind-the-scenes tour of a haunted theater. The theme and ride vehicles would see additional changes over the years – &quot;Scooby Doo and the Haunted Castle&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Boo Blasters on Boo Hill&quot; in 2010 – but the same underlying transportation system was retained each time.

The area&#x27;s main attractions include the Royal Fountain, a capable of shooting of water into the air each minute, and the signature Eiffel Tower, a one-third scale replica of the original which offers a view of the entire park to its guests. Grand Carousel, a classic carousel built in 1926 and originally located at Coney Island, is another International Street attraction. Also located here is Kings Island Theater along with a variety of restaurants and souvenir shops.

===Oktoberfest===
Oktoberfest, relating to the eponymous German festival, opened with the park in 1972. The area resembles a German town with timber-framed, German-style architecture. The Festhaus building is its central attraction, featuring live shows with several indoor eateries. Rides within Oktoberfest include a swinging pirate ship ride called Viking Fury, which opened in 1982.

=== Planet Snoopy===
The area initially opened with the park in 1972 as &quot;The Happy Land of Hanna-Barbera&quot; and was later shortened to &quot;Hanna-Barbera Land&quot;. One of the area&#x27;s flagship attractions was a junior wooden roller coaster named &quot;Scooby Doo&quot;, which like The Racer was designed by John C. Allen but intended for younger riders.

Following Cedar Fair&#x27;s purchase of the park from Paramount in 2006, Nickelodeon-themed elements were eventually removed and replaced with &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip themes in 2010 – the children&#x27;s brand marketed at other Cedar Fair(now Six Flags) parks. Nickelodeon Universe became known as Planet Snoopy. The area features many rides intended for smaller children, as well as three family-oriented roller coasters and a skater coaster. &quot;Amusement Today&quot; awarded Kings Island with the Golden Ticket Award for &quot;Best Kids&#x27; Area in the World&quot; for eighteen consecutive years (2001–2018). Kings Island&#x27;s Planet Snoopy was also the largest in the Cedar Fair(now Six Flags) chain until 2013, when Kings Dominion doubled the size of its Planet Snoopy section.


===Rivertown===
Rivertown is an area within the park that features a western theme depicting a town with ranch-style buildings, old wooden signs, and one of the park&#x27;s most iconic attractions, the Kings Island &amp; Miami Valley Railroad. Originally intended to be named &quot;Frontier Land&quot;, the area was eventually named Rivertown when it debuted with the park in 1972. The area included attractions such as Kings Mill Log Flume and Shawnee Landing, a canoe ride in a part of Rivertown known as Kenton&#x27;s Cove.

Throughout the 1970s, Rivertown saw the addition of several attractions including Kenton&#x27;s Cove Keelboat Canal in 1973, which was an elevated log flume ride that operated through the 2000 season, and The Beast roller coaster in 1979. Designed internally by Kings Island, The Beast opened as the tallest, fastest, and longest roller coaster in the world, and in addition to retaining its record length, it remains one of the most popular wooden roller coasters in the annual Golden Ticket Awards from &quot;Amusement Today&quot;. Other rides added over the years include a river rafting ride called White Water Canyon, which opened in 1985, and a heavily themed, indoor flat ride called Tomb Raider: The Ride (later renamed The Crypt), which opened in place of Kenton&#x27;s Cove Keelboat Canal in 2002. The Crypt closed permanently in 2011.

In 2009, the park&#x27;s first roller coaster from Bolliger &amp; Mabillard, called Diamondback, opened in Rivertown. The hypercoaster reaches a top speed of and features a splashdown water effect finale. In August 2016, Kings Island revealed plans to build Mystic Timbers, a wooden roller coaster that opened in 2017. The new ride added of track bringing the park&#x27;s wooden coaster total to , making it the most of any amusement park in the world.

===Soak City===

Included with park admission, Soak City is a water park featuring two wave pools, several children&#x27;s areas and a variety of water slides. It originally opened in 1989 as &quot;WaterWorks&quot; and has since been expanded several times. It was renamed in 2004 to &quot;Crocodile Dundee&#x27;s Boomerang Bay&quot;, based on the titular character from the film &quot;&quot;Crocodile&quot; Dundee&quot;, played by Paul Hogan who was also hired to promote the revamped water park. Following Cedar Fair&#x27;s acquisition of Kings Island, it was later renamed &quot;Boomerang Bay&quot;, and all references to the film character were removed. On September 2, 2011, Kings Island announced a $10-million expansion of the water park for the 2012 season, as well as a plan to rename it &quot;Soak City&quot;. Tropical Plunge, a seven-story water slide complex, was added for the 2016 season. Kings Island announces an expansion for the 2025 season with the addition of RiverRacers, a dual-racing water coaster.

==Seasonal events==
===Halloween Haunt===

Halloween Haunt is a Halloween-themed event at Kings Island that operates on weekends from September through October. It features haunted houses, mazes, live shows, and most of the park&#x27;s regular season attractions. Special lighting and fog effects are used throughout the park, and actors in costume engage with guests. The event originally debuted as FearFest in 2000, and the name was later changed to Halloween Haunt in 2007.

===Winterfest===
Winterfest is an annual Christmas-themed holiday festival that operates from mid-November through late December, featuring ice skating on the Royal Fountain as well as the special lighting throughout the park. Some rides and attractions are in operation, and International Street is transformed into a winter village filled with Christmas carolers, homemade crafts, and holiday-themed refreshments and snacks. The event debuted in 1982 and returned annually through 1992, followed by a brief return in 2005. Under Cedar Fair&#x27;s ownership, the park listened to guest feedback and brought Winterfest back in 2017. They planned several years in advance to increase the scale of the event, which showcases over 5 million color-changing lights and dozens of live performances each night.

==Fast Lane==

Fast Lane, introduced at Kings Island in July 2011, is a secondary queue system that offers shorter wait times on the park&#x27;s most popular rides. In addition to the standard admission charge, visitors can bypass the standard wait line by purchasing a wrist band that grants access to the Fast Lane queue. A limited number of wrist bands are sold each day. Kings Island offers Fright Lane passes that operate the same way as Fast Lane, but they are for Halloween Haunt attractions only.

<text>Dame Rachel Whiteread (born 20 April 1963) is an English artist who primarily produces sculptures, which typically take the form of casts. She was the first woman to win the annual Turner Prize in 1993.

Whiteread was one of the Young British Artists who exhibited at the Royal Academy&#x27;s &quot;Sensation&quot; exhibition in 1997. Among her most renowned works are &quot;House&quot;, a large concrete cast of the inside of an entire Victorian house; the Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial in Vienna, resembling the shelves of a library with the pages turned outwards; and &quot;Untitled Monument&quot;, her resin sculpture for the empty fourth plinth in London&#x27;s Trafalgar Square.

She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2006 and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to art.

==Early life and education==
Whiteread was born in 1963 in Ilford, Essex. Her mother, Patricia Whiteread (&quot;née&quot; Lancaster), who was also an artist, died in 2003 at the age of 72. Her father, Thomas Whiteread, was a geography teacher, polytechnic administrator and lifelong supporter of the Labour Party, who died when Whiteread was studying at art school in 1988. She is the third of three sisters – the older two being identical twins.

She took a workshop on casting with the sculptor Richard Wilson and began to realize the possibilities in casting objects. She was briefly at the Cyprus College of Art. From 1985 to 1987 she studied sculpture at Slade School of Art, University College, London, where she was taught by Phyllida Barlow, graduating with an MA in 1987. Whiteread worked as an invigilator at the Serpentine Gallery.

For a time she worked in Highgate Cemetery fixing lids back onto time-damaged coffins. She began to exhibit in 1987, with her first solo exhibition coming in 1988. She lives and works in a former synagogue in east London with long-term partner and fellow sculptor Marcus Taylor. They have two sons.

==Work==
Many of Whiteread&#x27;s works are casts of ordinary domestic objects and, in numerous cases, their so-called negative space. For example, she is known for making solid casts of the open space in and around pieces of furniture such as tables and chairs, architectural details and even entire rooms and buildings. She says the casts carry &quot;the residue of years and years of use.&quot; Whiteread mainly focuses on the line and the form for her pieces.

While still at the Slade, Whiteread cast domestic objects and created her first sculpture, &quot;Closet&quot;. She made a plaster cast of the interior of a wooden wardrobe and covered it with black felt. It was based on comforting childhood memories of hiding in a dark closet. After she graduated she rented space for a studio using the Enterprise Allowance Scheme. She created &quot;Shallow Breath&quot; (1988), the cast of the underside of a bed, made not long after her father died. Both sculptures were exhibited in her first solo show in 1988 along with casts of other domestic pieces. The work all sold and allowed her to apply for grants to find funding for larger sculptures.

===&quot;Ghost&quot;===
After her first solo exhibition, Whiteread decided to cast the space that her domestic objects could have inhabited. She applied for grants, describing the project as &quot;mummifying the air in a room.&quot; She completed &quot;Ghost&quot; in 1990. It was cast from a room in a house on Archway Road in north London, much like the house she grew up in. The road was being widened, and the house was torn down. She used plaster to cast the parlor walls and ceiling in sections and assembled them on a metal frame.

&quot;Ghost&quot; was first shown at the nonprofit Chisenhale Gallery. It was purchased by Charles Saatchi and included with other works by Whiteread in his first &quot;Young British Art&quot; show in 1992. In May 2004 a fire in a Momart storage warehouse destroyed many works from the Saatchi collection, including, it is believed, some by Whiteread. However, &quot;Ghost&quot; had recently been moved from the warehouse to the new Gagosian Gallery in London. The work was acquired by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in the autumn of 2004. According to the National Gallery, &quot;She has worked on every scale, defining the space between positives and negatives, public and private, and manufactured and handmade objects, always with concision, intelligence, beauty, and power.&quot;

===&quot;House&quot; and the Turner Prize===
In October 1993 Whiteread completed &quot;House&quot;, the cast of a Victorian terrace house. She had begun considering casting an entire house in 1991. She and James Lingwood of Artangel looked at houses to be torn down in North and East London in 1992, but without success in securing one. During this period in 1992 and 1993, Whiteread had an artist residency in Berlin with a scholarship from the DAAD Artist&#x27;s Programme. While in Berlin, she created &quot;Untitled (Room)&quot;, the cast of a generic, anonymous room that she built herself. She finished the interior of a room-sized box with wallpaper, windows, and door before casting. The sculpture is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

&quot;House&quot;, perhaps her best-known work, was a concrete cast of the inside of an entire Victorian terraced house completed in autumn 1993, exhibited at the location of the original house – 193 Grove Road – in East London (all the houses in the street had earlier been knocked down by the council). It drew mixed responses, winning her both the Turner Prize for the best young British artist in 1993 and the K Foundation art award for the worst British artist. She was the first woman to win a Turner Prize. Tower Hamlets London Borough Council demolished &quot;House&quot; on 11 January 1994, a decision which caused some controversy itself.

===&quot;Untitled (One Hundred Spaces)&quot; (1997)===
For the &quot;Sensation&quot; exhibition in 1997, Whiteread exhibited &quot;Untitled (One Hundred Spaces)&quot;, a series of resin casts of the space underneath chairs. This work can be seen as a descendant of Bruce Nauman&#x27;s concrete cast of the area under his chair of 1965.

The critical response included:

&quot;like a field of large glace sweets, it is her most spectacular, and benign installation to date [...] Monuments to domesticity, they are like solidified jellies, opalescent ice-cubes, or bars of soap – lavender, rose, spearmint, lilac. They look like a regulated graveyard or a series of futuristic standing stones with a passing resemblance to television sets.&quot;

: — Andrew Lambirth, &quot;The Spectator&quot;, 12 October 1996.

===&quot;Water Tower&quot;===
In 1998, Whiteread made &quot;Water Tower&quot; as part of a grant for New York City&#x27;s Public Art Fund. The piece, which is 12&#x27; 2&quot; and 9&#x27; in diameter, was a translucent resin cast of a water tower installed on a rooftop in New York City&#x27;s SoHo district. It has been called &quot;an extremely beautiful object, which changes colour with the sky, and also a very appropriate one, celebrating one of the most idiosyncratic and charming features of the New York skyline.&quot; The piece is now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). Just as &quot;Ghost&quot; led on to the larger and better known &quot;House&quot;, so &quot;Water Tower&quot; led to the more public Trafalgar Square plinth work three years later.

===&quot;Holocaust Monument&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Nameless Library&quot; (2000)===
During the Holocaust, 65,000 Austrian Jews were executed, and in memory, &quot;Monument to the Victims of Fascism&quot; was a monument erected to commemorate these lost lives, however, this piece was seen as unsatisfying, so Simon Wiesenthal proposed the idea for a new memorial to the mayor of Vienna. With the condition that this memorial could not be figurative and needed to represent all 65,000 lives and the camps they were executed at, Rachel Whiteread was chosen out of ten artists to create this monument. Her monument &quot;Nameless Library&quot; was erected in Judenplatz Square in Vienna and appears to be an inside-out library. This structure was built from positively cast cement books which are placed with their spines facing inward. The inability to read these books alludes to the lost lives of the 65,000 Austrian Jews whose stories are unable to be told leaving the viewer with a sense of loss and absence. These books have also been seen as referring to the Nazi book burnings. The sculpture also does not include corners or bookshelves which further symbolizes the lack of structure and support.

&quot;Nameless Library&quot; also is constructed on the excavation grounds of Vienna&#x27;s oldest synagogues which caused a lot of criticism towards the piece as many citizens felt that the grounds sufficed for the memorial itself. Some critics even accused her of stereotyping the Jewish people as &quot;the people of the book&quot; considering that Jewish memorials were traditionally written. This monument also questions the architectural concepts of interior and exterior as the building surrounding the square form walls, and the streets leading into it like doorways. In addition, the inverted rose ceiling works as a drainage point to the interior of the sculpture.

===&quot;Untitled Monument&quot; (2001)===

With &quot;Untitled Monument&quot; (2001), (also variously known as &quot;Plinth&quot; or &quot;Inverted Plinth&quot;), Whiteread became the third artist to provide a sculpture for the empty Fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square. Her sculpture was an 11-ton resin cast of the plinth itself, made by Mike Smith Studio, London, which stood upside down, creating a sort of mirror-image of the plinth. It was said to be the most massive object ever made out of resin, taking eight attempts to produce due to the resin cracking.

The work was produced in two halves, and surface blisters of the cast were repaired by picking them off and filling the small craters with a syringe of resin. Unusually for a public work, she raised funds for the piece herself by selling maquettes (small preparatory models); this was no small gesture with the mold alone costing over £100,000 and the total cost estimated at £225,000

The critical response included:

&quot;This dazzling anti-monument monument looks like a glass coffin, but its watery transparency relates to the large fountain that dominates the Trafalgar plaza. Following the aquatic theme, Whiteread&#x27;s Monument evokes the scene of the 1805 naval battle for which the square is named.&quot;

: — David Ebony, &quot;Artnet&quot;
&quot;It&#x27;s a simple trick, but an effective one, and the associations it conjures – heaviness and lightness, earth and heaven, death and life – are thought-provoking and manifold [...] Whiteread&#x27;s Monument, as light and gleaming as the plinth is dark and squat, is the only one of the four commissioned pieces to allude directly to the plinth&#x27;s defining emptiness. She sees it not as a space to be filled, but as an absence to be acknowledged, and she does it well.&quot;

: — Ned Denny, &quot;New Statesman&quot;, 9 July 2001.

===&quot;Embankment&quot; (2005–2006)===
In spring 2004, she was offered the annual Unilever series commission to produce a piece for Tate Modern&#x27;s vast Turbine Hall, delaying acceptance for five to six months until she was confident she could conceive of a work to fill the space. Throughout the latter half of September 2005 and mid-way through October her work &quot;Embankment&quot; was installed and was made public on 10 October.

It consists of some 14,000 translucent, white polyethylene boxes (themselves casts of the inside of cardboard boxes) stacked in various ways; some in very tall mountain-like peaks and others in lower (though still over human height), rectangular, more leveled arrangements. They are fixed in position with an adhesive. She cited the end scenes of both &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; and &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; as visual precursors; she also spoke of the death of her mother and a period of upheaval which involved packing and moving comparable boxes.

It is also thought that her recent trip to the Arctic is an inspiration, although critics counter that white is merely the colour the polyethylene comes in, and it would have added significantly to the expense to dye them. The boxes were manufactured from casts of ten plain cardboard boxes by a company that produces grit bins and traffic bollards.

The critical response included:

&quot;With this work Whiteread has deepened her game, and made a work as rich and subtle as it is spectacular. Whatever else it is, Embankment is generous and brave, a statement of intent.&quot;
: — Adrian Searle, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, 11 October 2005.
&quot;Everything feels surprisingly domestic in scale, the intimidating vistas of the Turbine Hall shrunk down to irregular paths and byways. From atop the walkway, it looks like a storage depot that is steadily losing the plot; from inside, as you thread your way between the mounds of blocks, it feels more like an icy maze.&quot;

: — Andrew Dickson, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, 10 October 2005.
&quot;This is another example of meritless gigantism that could be anywhere, and is the least successful of the gallery&#x27;s six attempts to exploit its most unsympathetic space,&quot;

: — Brian Sewell, &quot;London Evening Standard&quot;, October 2005.
&quot;[looks] like a random pile of giant sugar cubes [...] Luckily, the £400,000 sponsored work is recyclable.&quot;

: — Stephen Moyes, &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, 11 October 2005.

===&quot;Charity Box&quot; (2007)===

Whiteread created this small, plaster sculpture for a charity auction by the Prior Weston PTA, in support of the Prior Weston primary school in Islington, London.

The piece measures, a comparatively tiny, 16 cm x 11.5 cm x 11.5 cm.

===&quot;Angel of the South&quot; (2008)===
She was one of the five artists shortlisted for the Angel of the South project in January 2008.

===&quot;The Gran Boathouse&quot; (2010)===
&quot;The Gran Boathouse&quot; is located on the waters edge in Gran Norway. From a distance, it looks like any other boathouse, but closer inspection reveals that this is a work of art in concrete. The work is a cast of the interior of an old boathouse. Whiteread turns the boathouse inside out thereby capturing a moment in time. In this way, she encourages us to reflect on what we see around us. &quot;I have mummified the air inside the boathouse,&quot; says Rachel Whiteread. &quot;I wanted to make a shy sculpture, a sculpture that would stand there peaceful and noble.&quot; The boathouse and its interior had all the qualities that she was looking for. It represented the history of the place. The sculpture is preserving what would otherwise have been lost.

=== Rachel Whiteread Drawings (2010) ===
The Hammer Museum exhibited Whiteread&#x27;s first museum retrospective of works on paper in 2010. The exhibition traveled to the Nasher Sculpture Center and the Tate Britain.

===Work since 2012===
Cast from generic wooden sheds, &quot;Detached 1&quot;, &quot;Detached 2&quot;, and &quot;Detached 3&quot; (2012) render the empty interior of a garden shed in concrete and steel. &quot;Circa 1665 (I)&quot; (2012), &quot;LOOK, LOOK, LOOK&quot; (2012) and &quot;Loom&quot; (2012) belong to a series cast from doors and windows in shades of rose, eau-de-nil, or steely resin. Propped against or affixed to walls, the sculptures glow with absorbed and reflected light.

Other works like &quot;Untitled (Amber)&quot; (2012) and &quot;Untitled (Green)&quot; (2012) are diminutive cardboard constructions mounted on graphite-marked notepaper, painted with silver leaf and complete with celluloid &quot;windows&quot; that refer to the resin sculptures.

===&quot;Cabin&quot; (2016)===
&quot;Cabin&quot; is a concrete reverse cast of a wooden shed. It has been located on Discovery Hill on Governors Island in New York Harbour since 2016. Whiteread uses this idea in order to produce a negative space that had existed but no longer does. Since &quot;Cabin&quot; is away from the noisy city, it creates a peaceful scene and a quiet sense. &quot;Cabin&quot; is said to be her first public commission in the United States that is installed permanently on the island.
With this work, Whiteread wanted to &quot;blur the notion of space even further by allowing the booming nature of the park to and hide the installation.&quot; Therefore, even though the city that is so advanced with technology and is polluted by gasoline, &quot;nature is still present.&quot;

&quot;What an extraordinary site, and what an honor to be asked to put something there,&quot; Whiteread states. &#x27;I tried to imagine what one could sit there with some kind of dignity, to create a place of remembrance.&quot; She would like &quot;to make a piece that was evocative without wanting to make a memorial to the World Trade Center.&quot;

==Other commissions==
In 2023, Whiteread created a 31 feet tall Christmas tree covered by 102 circular neon white hoops for Carlos Place outside The Connaught hotel in London&#x27;s Mayfair district which commissioned the piece.

<doc id="158383" wikidata="Q192626" url="?curid=158383" title="Hawaiian Islands">
<text>The Hawaiian Islands () are an archipelago of eight major volcanic islands, several atolls, and numerous smaller islets in the North Pacific Ocean, extending some from the island of Hawaii in the south to northernmost Kure Atoll. Formerly called the Sandwich Islands by Europeans, the present name for the archipelago is derived from the name of its largest island, Hawaii.

The archipelago sits on the Pacific plate. The islands are exposed peaks of a great undersea mountain range known as the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain, formed by volcanic activity over the Hawaiian hotspot. The islands are about from the nearest continent and are part of the Polynesia subregion of Oceania.

The U.S. state of Hawaii occupies the archipelago almost in its entirety (including the mostly uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands), with the sole exception of Midway Atoll (a United States Minor Outlying Island). Hawaii is the only U.S. state that is situated entirely on an archipelago, and the only state not geographically connected with North America. The Northwestern islands (sometimes called the Leeward Islands) and surrounding seas are protected as a national monument and World Heritage Site.

==Islands and reefs==
The Hawaiian Islands have a total land area of . Except for Midway, which is an unincorporated territory of the United States, these islands and islets are administered as Hawaii—the 50th state of the United States.

===Major islands===

The eight major islands of Hawaii (Windward Islands) are listed above. All except Kaho&#x27;olawe are inhabited.

===Minor islands, islets===

The state of Hawaii counts 137 &quot;islands&quot; in the Hawaiian chain. This number includes all minor islands (small islands), islets (even smaller islands) offshore of the major islands (listed above), and individual islets in each atoll. These are just a few:
* Kaʻula
* Kāohikaipu
* Lehua
* Mānana
* Mōkōlea Rock
* Mokolii
* Moku Manu
* Mokuauia
* Moku o Loʻe
* Moku Ola
* Mokuʻumeʻume
* Molokini
* Nā Mokulua

===Partial islands, atolls, reefs===

Partial islands, atolls, reefs—those west of Niʻihau are uninhabited except Midway Atoll—form the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Leeward Islands):
* Nihoa (Mokumana)
* Necker (Mokumanamana)
* French Frigate Shoals (Kānemilohaʻi)
* Gardner Pinnacles (Pūhāhonu)
* Maro Reef (Nalukākala)
* Laysan (Kauō)
* Lisianski Island (Papaʻāpoho)
* Pearl and Hermes Atoll (Holoikauaua)
* Midway Atoll (Pihemanu)
* Kure Atoll (Mokupāpapa)

==Geology==

This chain of islands, or archipelago, developed as the Pacific plate slowly moved northwestward over a hotspot in the Earth&#x27;s mantle at a rate of approximately per million years. Thus, the southeast island is volcanically active, whereas the islands on the northwest end of the archipelago are older and typically smaller, due to longer exposure to erosion. The age of the archipelago has been estimated using potassium-argon dating methods. From this study and others, it is estimated that the northwesternmost island, Kure Atoll, is the oldest at approximately 28 million years (Ma); while the southeasternmost island, Hawaiʻi, is approximately 0.4 Ma (400,000 years). The only active volcanism in the last 200 years has been on the southeastern island, Hawaiʻi, and on the submerged but growing volcano to the extreme southeast, Kamaʻehuakanaloa (formerly Loʻihi). The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory of the USGS documents recent volcanic activity and provides images and interpretations of the volcanism. Kīlauea had been erupting nearly continuously since 1983 when it stopped August 2018.

Almost all of the magma of the hotspot has the composition of basalt, and so the Hawaiian volcanoes are composed almost entirely of this igneous rock. There is very little coarser-grained gabbro and diabase. Nephelinite is exposed on the islands but is extremely rare. The majority of eruptions in Hawaiʻi are Hawaiian-type eruptions because basaltic magma is relatively fluid compared with magmas typically involved in more explosive eruptions, such as the andesitic magmas that produce some of the spectacular and dangerous eruptions around the margins of the Pacific basin.

Hawaiʻi island (the Big Island) is the biggest and youngest island in the chain, built from five volcanoes. Mauna Loa, taking up over half of the Big Island, is the largest shield volcano on the Earth. The measurement from sea level to summit is more than , from sea level to sea floor about .

===Earthquakes===
The Hawaiian Islands have many earthquakes, generally triggered by and related to volcanic activity. Seismic activity, as a result, is currently highest in the southern part of the chain. Both historical and modern earthquake databases have correlated higher magnitude earthquakes with flanks of active volcanoes, such as Mauna Loa and Kilauea. The combination of erosional forces, which cause slumping and landslides, with the pressure exerted by rising magma put a great amount of stress on the volcanic flanks. The stress is released when the slope fails, or slips, causing an earthquake. This type of seismicity is unique because the forces driving the system are not always consistent over time, since rates of volcanic activity fluctuate. Seismic hazard near active, seaward volcanic flanks is high, partially because of the especially unpredictable nature of the forces that trigger earthquakes, and partially because these events occur at relatively shallow depths. Flank earthquakes typically occur at depths ranging from 5 to 20 km, increasing the hazard to local infrastructure and communities. Earthquakes and landslides on the island chain have also been known to cause tsunamis.

Most of the early earthquake monitoring took place in Hilo, by missionaries Titus Coan and Sarah J. Lyman and her family. Between 1833 and 1896, approximately 4 or 5 earthquakes were reported per year. Today, earthquakes are monitored by the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory run by the USGS.

Hawaii accounted for 7.3% of the United States&#x27; reported earthquakes with a magnitude 3.5 or greater from 1974 to 2003, with a total 1533 earthquakes. Hawaii ranked as the state with the third most earthquakes over this time period, after Alaska and California.

On October 15, 2006, there was an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.7 off the northwest coast of the island of Hawaii, near the Kona area. The initial earthquake was followed approximately five minutes later by a magnitude 5.7 aftershock. Minor to moderate damage was reported on most of the Big Island. Several major roadways became impassable from rock slides, and effects were felt as far away as Honolulu, Oahu, nearly from the epicenter. Power outages lasted for several hours to days. Several water mains ruptured. No deaths or life-threatening injuries were reported.

On May 4, 2018, there was a 6.9 earthquake in the zone of volcanic activity from Kīlauea.

Earthquakes are monitored by the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory run by the USGS.

===Tsunamis===

The Hawaiian Islands are subject to tsunamis, great waves that strike the shore. Tsunamis are most often caused by earthquakes somewhere in the Pacific. The waves produced by the earthquakes travel at speeds of and can affect coastal regions thousands of miles (kilometers) away.

Tsunamis may also originate from the Hawaiian Islands. Explosive volcanic activity can cause tsunamis. The island of Molokaʻi had a catastrophic collapse or debris avalanche over a million years ago; this underwater landslide likely caused tsunamis. The Hilina Slump on the island of Hawaiʻi is another potential place for a large landslide and resulting tsunami.

The city of Hilo on the Big Island has been most affected by tsunamis, where the in-rushing water is accentuated by the shape of Hilo Bay. Coastal cities have tsunami warning sirens.

A tsunami resulting from an earthquake in Chile hit the islands on February 27, 2010. It was relatively minor, but local emergency management officials utilized the latest technology and ordered evacuations in preparation for a possible major event. The Governor declared it a &quot;good drill&quot; for the next major event.

A tsunami resulting from an earthquake in Japan hit the islands on March 11, 2011. It was relatively minor, but local officials ordered evacuations in preparation for a possible major event. The tsunami caused about $30.1 million in damages.

=== Volcanoes ===
Only the two Hawaiian islands furthest to the southeast have active volcanoes: Haleakalā on Maui, and Mauna Loa, Mauna Kea, Kilauea, and Hualalai, all on the Big Island. The volcanoes on the remaining islands are extinct as they are no longer over the Hawaii hotspot. The Kamaʻehuakanaloa Seamount is an active submarine volcano that is expected to become the newest Hawaiian island when it rises above the ocean&#x27;s surface in 10,000–100,000 years. 
Hazards from these volcanoes include lava flows that can destroy and bury the surrounding surface, volcanic gas emissions, earthquakes and tsunamis listed above, submarine eruptions affecting the ocean, and the possibility of an explosive eruption.
==History==
Hawaii was first discovered and settled by explorers from Tahiti or the Marquesas Islands. The date of the first settlements is a continuing debate. Kirch&#x27;s textbooks on Hawaiian archeology date the first Polynesian settlements to about 300 C.E., although his more recent estimates are as late as 600. More recent surveys of carbon-dating evidence put the arrival of the first settlers at around 940–1130 C.E.

==Ecology==
The islands are home to a multitude of endemic species. Since human settlement, first by Polynesians, non native trees, plants, and animals were introduced. These included species such as rats and pigs, that have preyed on native birds and invertebrates that initially evolved in the absence of such predators. The growing population of humans, especially through European and American colonisation and development, has also led to deforestation, forest degradation, treeless grasslands, and environmental degradation. As a result, many species which depended on forest habitats and food became extinct—with many current species facing extinction. As humans cleared land for farming with the importation of industrialized farming practices through European and American encroachment, monocultural crop production replaced multi-species systems.

The arrival of the Europeans had a more significant impact, with the promotion of large-scale single-species export agriculture and livestock grazing. This led to increased clearing of forests, and the development of towns, adding many more species to the list of extinct animals of the Hawaiian Islands. , many of the remaining endemic species are considered endangered.

==National Monument==
On June 15, 2006, President George W. Bush issued a public proclamation creating Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument under the Antiquities Act of 1906. The Monument encompasses the northwestern Hawaiian Islands and surrounding waters, forming the largest marine wildlife reserve in the world. In August 2010, UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Committee added Papahānaumokuākea to its list of World Heritage Sites. On August 26, 2016, former President Barack Obama greatly expanded Papahānaumokuākea, quadrupling it from its original size.

==Climate==
The Hawaiian Islands are tropical but experience many different climates, depending on altitude and surroundings. The islands receive most rainfall from the trade winds on their north and east flanks (the windward side) as a result of orographic precipitation. Coastal areas in general and especially the south and west flanks, or leeward sides, tend to be drier.

In general, the lowlands of Hawaiian Islands receive most of their precipitation during the winter months (October to April). Drier conditions generally prevail from May to September. The tropical storms, and occasional hurricanes, tend to occur from July through November.

During the summer months the average temperature is about 84 °F (29 °C), in the winter months it is approximately 79 °F (26 °C). As the temperature is relatively constant over the year the probability of dangerous thunderstorms is approximately low.

<text>The Young British Artists, or YBAs—also referred to as Brit artists and Britart—is a loose group of visual artists who first began to exhibit together in London in 1988. Many of the YBA artists graduated from the BA Fine Art course at Goldsmiths, in the late 1980s, whereas some from the group had trained at Royal College of Art.

The scene began around a series of artist-led exhibitions held in warehouses and factories, beginning in 1988 with the Damien Hirst-led &quot;Freeze&quot; and, in 1990, &quot;East Country Yard Show&quot; and &quot;Modern Medicine&quot;.

They are noted for &quot;shock tactics&quot;, use of throwaway materials, wild living, and an attitude &quot;both oppositional and entrepreneurial&quot;. They achieved considerable media coverage and dominated British art during the 1990s; internationally reviewed shows in the mid-1990s included &quot;Brilliant!&quot; and &quot;Sensation&quot;.

Many of the artists were initially supported and their works collected by Charles Saatchi. One notable exception is Angus Fairhurst. Leading artists of the group include Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin. Key works include Hirst&#x27;s &quot;The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living&quot;, a shark preserved in formaldehyde in a vitrine, and Emin&#x27;s &quot;My Bed&quot;, a dishevelled double bed surrounded by detritus.

==Origin==

There is some disagreement as to the first use of the term &quot;young British artists.&quot; &quot;Tate&quot; claims that it was Michael Corris in a footnote in &quot;Artforum&quot;, May 1992, Others claim that it was Saatchi who had already entitled his exhibition &quot;Young British Artists I&quot; in March 1992. The acronym &quot;YBA&quot; (or &quot;yBa&quot;) was not coined until 1994. It has become a historic term, as most of the YBAs were born in the mid-1960s.

===YBA artists===

The core of the YBA group graduated from the Goldsmiths BA Fine Art degree course in the classes of 1987–90. Liam Gillick, Fiona Rae, Steve Park and Sarah Lucas, were graduates in the class of 1987. Ian Davenport, Michael Landy, Gary Hume, Anya Gallaccio, Lala Meredith-Vula, Henry Bond, Angela Bulloch, were graduates in the class of 1988; Damien Hirst, Angus Fairhurst, Mat Collishaw, Simon Patterson, and Abigail Lane, were graduates from the class of 1989; whilst Gillian Wearing, and Sam Taylor-Wood, were graduates from the class of 1990, and Jason Martin was graduated with the class of 1993. During the years 1987–1990, the teaching staff on the Goldsmiths BA Fine Art included Jon Thompson, Richard Wentworth, Michael Craig-Martin, Ian Jeffrey, Helen Chadwick, Mark Wallinger, Judith Cowan and Glen Baxter.

Gavin Turk and Mark Francis are also part of the YBA group of artists. Turk and Francis studied at Chelsea School of Art from 1986 to 1989, and at the Royal College of Art from 1989 to 1991. Turk and Francis exhibited work in the Saatchi &quot;Sensation&quot; exhibition at the Royal Academy.

===Freeze===
A group of sixteen Goldsmiths students took part in a group exhibition of art, called &quot;Freeze&quot;, of which Damien Hirst became the main organiser; he was still in the second year of a BA in Fine Art.

Commercial galleries had shown a lack of interest in the project, and it was held in a cheap non-art space, a London Docklands admin block (usually referred to as a warehouse). The event resonated with the &#x27;Acid house&#x27; warehouse rave scene prevalent at the time, but did not achieve any major press exposure. One of its effects was to set an example of artist-as-curator—in the mid-1990s artist-run exhibition spaces and galleries became a feature of the London arts scene.

===Other shows===

There was a less prominent predecessor organized by artist Angus Fairhurst, featuring himself, Damien Hirst, Abigail Lane, and Mat Collishaw in a small show called &quot;Progress by Degree&quot; at the Bloomsbury Gallery of the University of London (Institute of Education) shortly before Freeze.

In liaison with Hirst, Carl Freedman (who had been friends with him in Leeds before Hirst moved to London and was helping to make Hirst&#x27;s vitrines) and Billee Sellman then curated two influential &quot;warehouse&quot; shows in 1990, &quot;Modern Medicine&quot; and &quot;Gambler&quot;, in a Bermondsey former factory they designated Building One. To stage &quot;Modern Medicine&quot; they raised £1,000 sponsorships from artworld figures including Charles Saatchi. Freedman has spoken openly about the self-fulfilling prophecy these sponsors helped to create, and also commented that not many people attended these early shows, including &quot;Freeze&quot;.

In 1990, Henry Bond and Sarah Lucas organised the &quot;East Country Yard Show&quot; in a disused warehouse in London Docklands which was installed over four floors and 16,000m2 of exhibition space. Writing in The Independent, art critic Andrew Graham-Dixon said:&quot;Goldsmiths graduates are unembarrassed about promoting themselves and their work: some of the most striking exhibitions in London over the past few months—&quot;The East Country Yard Show&quot;, or &quot;Gambler&quot;, both staged in docklands—have been independently organized and funded by Goldsmiths graduates as showcases for their work. This has given them a reputation for pushiness, yet it should also be said that in terms of ambition, attention to display and sheer bravado there has been little to match such shows in the country&#x27;s established contemporary art institutions. They were far superior, for instance, to any of the contemporary art shows that have been staged by the Liverpool Tate in its own multi-million-pound dockland site.&quot;

Established alternative spaces such as City Racing at the Oval in London and Milch gave many artists their first exposure. There was much embryonic activity in the Hoxton/Shoreditch area of East London focused on Joshua Compston&#x27;s gallery. In 1991, the Serpentine Gallery presented a survey of this group of artists with the exhibition &quot;Broken English&quot;. In 1992, Charles Saatchi staged a series of exhibitions of &quot;Young British Art&quot;, the first show included works by Sarah Lucas, Rachel Whiteread and Damien Hirst.

A second wave of Young British Artists appeared in 1992–1993 through exhibitions such as &quot;New Contemporaries&quot;, &quot;New British Summertime&quot; and &quot;Minky Manky&quot; (curated by Carl Freedman). This included Douglas Gordon, Christine Borland, Fiona Banner, Tracey Emin, Tacita Dean, Georgina Starr and Jane and Louise Wilson. One exhibition which included several of the YBA artists was the 1995 quin-annual British Art Show.

==Revitalization of British art scene==

The Young British Artists revitalised (and in some cases spawned) a whole new generation of contemporary commercial galleries such as Karsten Schubert, Sadie Coles, Victoria Miro, Maureen Paley&#x27;s Interim Art, and Jay Jopling&#x27;s White Cube. The spread of interest improved the market for contemporary British art magazines through increased advertising and circulation. &quot;Frieze&quot; launched in 1991 embraced the YBAs from the start while established publications such as &quot;Art Monthly&quot;, &quot;Art Review&quot;, &quot;Modern Painters&quot; and &quot;Contemporary Art&quot; were all re-launched with more focus on emerging British artists.

===Charles Saatchi&#x27;s involvement===

One of the visitors to &quot;Freeze&quot; was Charles Saatchi, a major contemporary art collector and co-founder of Saatchi and Saatchi, the London advertising agency. Saatchi then visited &quot;Gambler&quot; in a green Rolls-Royce and, according to Freedman, stood open-mouthed with astonishment in front of (and then bought) Hirst&#x27;s first major &quot;animal&quot; installation, &quot;A Thousand Years&quot;, consisting of a large glass case containing maggots and flies feeding off a rotting cow&#x27;s head. (The installation was later a notable feature of the &quot;Sensation&quot; exhibition.)

Saatchi became not only Hirst&#x27;s main collector, but also the main sponsor for other YBAs–a fact openly acknowledged by Gavin Turk. The contemporary art market in London had dramatically collapsed in mid-1990 due to a major economic recession, and many commercial contemporary galleries had gone out of business. Saatchi had until this time collected mostly American and German contemporary art, some by young artists, but most by already established ones.

His collection was publicly exhibited in a series of shows in a large converted paint factory building in St John&#x27;s Wood, north London. Saatchi&#x27;s Gallery inspired young artists to produce large concept artworks that would not fit in the usually small galleries in London at that time. Previous Saatchi Gallery shows had included such major figures as Warhol, Guston, Alex Katz, Serra, Kiefer, Polke, Richter and many more. In the early-1990s, Saatchi altered his focus to emerging British art.

Saatchi put on a series of shows called &quot;Young British Artists&quot; starting in 1992, when a noted exhibit was Damien Hirst&#x27;s &quot;shark&quot; (&quot;The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living&quot;), which became the iconic work of British art in the 1990s, and the symbol of Britart worldwide. In addition to (and as a direct result of) Saatchi&#x27;s patronage, the Young British Artists benefited from intense media coverage. This was augmented by controversy surrounding the annual Turner Prize, (one of Britain&#x27;s few major awards for contemporary artists), which had several of the artists as nominees or winners. Channel 4 had become a sponsor of the competition, leading to television profiles of the artists in prime-time slots.

==Becoming the establishment==

The consolidation of the artists&#x27; status began in 1995 with a large-scale group exhibition &quot;Brilliant!&quot; held at the Walker Art Center a respected art museum in Minneapolis, USA. The term &quot;yBa&quot; was already used in 1994 and later used by Simon Ford in a feature &quot;Myth Making&quot; in March 1996 in &quot;Art Monthly&quot; magazine.

Art dealer Jay Jopling began to represent YBAs Jake &amp; Dinos Chapman, Tracey Emin, Marcus Harvey, Damien Hirst, Gary Hume, Marc Quinn, Gavin Turk and Sam Taylor-Wood, whom he married in 1998. Before Jopling, Karsten Schubert was the most important dealer of artists that were later called YBAs. Shortly after Freeze he exhibited Ian Davenport, Gary Hume, and Michael Landy in November 1988, who all exhibited in Freeze, in his gallery.

In 1997, the Royal Academy staged an exhibition of the private art collection of Charles Saatchi titled &quot;Sensation&quot;, which included many works by YBA artists.

The exhibition was actually a showing of Charles Saatchi&#x27;s private collection of their work, and he owned the major pieces. The liaison was effected by the Academy&#x27;s Norman Rosenthal, even though there was strong opposition from some of the Academicians, three of whom resigned. Controversy engendered in the media about the show, particularly over Marcus Harvey&#x27;s work &quot;Myra&quot;, served to reinforce the YBAs&#x27; importance. When the show toured to New York there was further controversy caused by the inclusion of Chris Ofili&#x27;s work &quot;The Holy Virgin Mary&quot; (1996).

==The YBAs since 1992==

In 1997, Gillian Wearing won the annual Turner Prize. In 1998, Chris Ofili won the annual Turner Prize.

In 1999, Tracey Emin was nominated for the Turner Prize. Her main exhibit, &quot;My Bed&quot;, consisting literally of her dishevelled, stained bed, surrounded by detritus including condoms, slippers and soiled underwear, created an immediate and lasting media impact and further heightened her prominence. The emergence at the same time of an anti-YBA group, The Stuckists, co-founded by her ex boyfriend, Billy Childish, gave another angle to media coverage.

In 2003, YBAs Jake and Dinos Chapman and Anya Gallaccio were nominated for the annual Turner Prize.

On 24 May 2004, a fire in a storage warehouse destroyed some works from the Saatchi collection, including the Chapman Brothers&#x27; &quot;Hell&quot; and Tracey Emin&#x27;s &quot;tent&quot;, &quot;Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995&quot;.

In 2008, YBA Angus Fairhurst died by suicide.

In the 2011 Birthday Honours List, Sam Taylor-Wood and Gillian Wearing were appointed to the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II.

===Elected Royal Academicians===

Several of the YBAs have been elected as lifetime members of the Royal Academy of Arts in London (founded by George III in 1768); hence they are &quot;Royal Academicians,&quot; and may use the letters &quot;RA&quot; after their name to indicate this.

==Reaction==

===Positive===
Richard Cork (at one time art critic of &quot;The Times&quot;) has been a staunch advocate of the artists, as has art writer Louisa Buck, and former &quot;Time Out&quot; art editor, Sarah Kent. Sir Nicholas Serota has validated the artists by the nomination of several of them for the Turner Prize and their inclusion in the Tate collection.

Maureen Paley said, &quot;The thing that came out of the YBA generation was boldness, a belief that you can get away with anything.&quot;

Speaking in 2009, Iwona Blazwick, the director of the Whitechapel Art Gallery, said, &quot;The YBA moment is definitely now dead, but anyone who thinks they were a cut-off point is wrong. They began something which has continued to grow ever since. It&#x27;s not over.&quot;

===Negative===
In 1998, John Windsor in &quot;The Independent&quot; said that the work of the YBAs seemed tame compared with that of the &quot;shock art&quot; of the 1970s, including &quot;kinky outrages&quot; at the Nicholas Treadwell Gallery, amongst which were a &quot;hanging, anatomically detailed leather straitjacket, complete with genitals&quot;, titled &quot;Pink Crucifixion&quot;, by Mandy Havers.

In 1999 the Stuckists art group was founded with an overt anti-YBA agenda. In 2002 Britart was heavily criticised by the leading conductor Sir Simon Rattle, who was, in return, accused of having a poor understanding of conceptual and visual art.

Playwright Tom Stoppard made a public denunciation, and Brian Sewell (art critic of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;) was consistently hostile, as was David Lee, the editor of &quot;Jackdaw&quot;.
Rolf Harris, the television presenter and artist, singled out Tracey Emin&#x27;s &quot;My Bed&quot; as the kind of installation that put people off art. &quot;I don&#x27;t see how getting out of bed and leaving the bed unmade and putting it on show and saying that&#x27;s worth, I don&#x27;t know £31,000 ... I don&#x27;t believe it, I think it&#x27;s a con.&quot;

For James Heartfield, &quot;The 1990s art boom encouraged sloppiness. The Young British Artists preferred the inspired gesture to patient work. They added public outrage to their palettes, only to find that it faded very quickly.&quot;

Members of the group are parodied in a regular cartoon strip by Birch, titled &quot;Young British Artists&quot;, in the British satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;.

=== Feminism within the YBAs ===
Female artists were distinctly a minority amongst the male dominated environment of the Young British Artists. Individuals such as Sarah Lucas, Jenny Saville and Rachel Whiteread have varied levels of neglect within their media portrayals, as well as incomparable in notoriety to male YBA peers such as Hirst.

The University of Sussex&#x27;s Art Society Journal describes how feminists in the 1980s influenced the female members of the Young British Artists&#x27; artwork through the strategy of subverting feminine stereotypes. Other discourse around female YBA work include a discussion of Rachel Whiteread&#x27;s sculpture practice. Whiteread has been said to disrupt the &#x27;clear&#x27; concept of women making &#x27;female work&#x27;. Her work &quot;Nine Tables&quot; attempts to exist within a third space, where the forms can&#x27;t be physically gendered, but still viewed as a feminine objects. Daniel Ogilivie has expressed how Judith Butler&#x27;s concept of which &quot;…the mere act of &#x27;doing&#x27;, of casting the object, that expresses the gender and it is not any anthropomorphic association in the artwork itself,&quot; creates the feminine within Whiteread&#x27;s work.

With the prevalence of feminist ideology in society and the contemporary art, critics have argued that female artists like Jenny Saville in the 1990s investigated the contrived idea of &#x27;feminity&#x27; made by the Patriarchal Structure. While attending art school in Cincinnati, Saville&#x27;s feminist passion was conceived through a realisation of gender within art history. In her own words, she discovered that, &quot;I&#x27;d always wondered why there had been no women artists in history. I found there had been – but not reported. I realized I&#x27;d been affected by male ideas, going through a male-dominated art college&quot;. Now consciously aware of institutional patriarchy, Saville began to paint female nudes that were not idealised. Rather than continue the recognised historical male view of female bodies, Saville created depictions of natural women with genuine flaws. Pubic hair trailing up stomachs and around thighs, discoloured skin and areas of excess flesh. Deconstructing the feminine body, Saville has stated that, &quot;I&#x27;m not trying to teach, just make people discuss, look at how women have been made by man. What is beauty? Beauty is usually the male image of the female body. My women are beautiful in their individuality.&quot;

<text>The Karnak Temple Complex, commonly known as Karnak (), comprises a vast mix of temples, pylons, chapels, and other buildings near Luxor, Egypt. Construction at the complex began during the reign of Senusret I (reigned 1971–1926 BC) in the Middle Kingdom () and continued into the Ptolemaic Kingdom (305–30 BC), although most of the extant buildings date from the New Kingdom. The area around Karnak was the ancient Egyptian &quot;Ipet-isut&quot; (&quot;The Most Selected of Places&quot;) and the main place of worship of the 18th Dynastic Theban Triad, with the god Amun as its head. It is part of the monumental city of Thebes, and in 1979 it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List along with the rest of the city. Karnak gets its name from the nearby, and partly surrounded, modern village of El-Karnak, north of Luxor.

==Name==
The original name of the temple was &quot;Ipet-isut&quot;, meaning &quot;The Most Select of Places&quot;. The complex&#x27;s modern name &quot;Karnak&quot; comes from the nearby village of el-Karnak, which means &quot;fortified village&quot;.

==Overview==
The complex is a vast open site and includes the Karnak Open Air Museum. It is believed to be the second most visited historical site in Egypt; only the Giza pyramid complex near Cairo receives more visits. It consists of four main parts, of which only the largest is currently open to the public. The term Karnak often is understood as being the Precinct of Amun-Re only, because this is the only part most visitors see. The three other parts, the Precinct of Mut, the Precinct of Montu, and the dismantled Temple of Amenhotep IV, are closed to the public. There also are a few smaller temples and sanctuaries connecting the Precinct of Mut, the Precinct of Amun-Re, and the Luxor Temple. The Precinct of Mut is very ancient, being dedicated to an Earth and creation deity, but not yet restored. The original temple was destroyed and partially restored by Hatshepsut, although another pharaoh built around it in order to change the focus or orientation of the sacred area. Many portions of it may have been carried away for use in other buildings.

The key difference between Karnak and most of the other temples and sites in Egypt is the length of time over which it was developed and used. Construction of temples started in the Middle Kingdom and continued into Ptolemaic times. Approximately thirty pharaohs contributed to the buildings, enabling it to reach a size, complexity, and diversity not seen elsewhere. Few of the individual features of Karnak are unique, but the size and number of features are vast. The deities represented range from some of the earliest worshipped to those worshipped much later in the history of the Ancient Egyptian culture. Although destroyed, it also contained an early temple built by Amenhotep IV (Akhenaten), the pharaoh who later would celebrate a nearly monotheistic religion he established that prompted him to move his court and religious center away from Thebes. It also contains evidence of adaptations, where the buildings of the ancient Egyptians were used by later cultures for their own religious purposes, such as Coptic churches.

===Hypostyle Hall===
The Great Hypostyle Hall in the Precinct of Amun-Re has an area of with 134 massive columns arranged in 16 rows. One hundred and twenty-two of these columns are tall, and the other 12 are tall with a diameter of over . The architraves, on top of these columns, are estimated to weigh 70 tons.

These architraves may have been lifted to these heights using levers. This would be a time-consuming process and also would require great balance to get to such heights. A common alternative theory regarding how they were moved is that large ramps were constructed of sand, mud, brick or stone and that the stones were then towed up the ramps. If stone had been used for the ramps, they would have been able to use much less material. The top of the ramps presumably would have employed either wooden tracks or cobblestones for towing the megaliths.

There is an unfinished pillar in an out-of-the-way location that indicates how it would have been finished. Final carving was executed after the drums were put in place so that it was not damaged while being placed. Several experiments moving megaliths with ancient technology were made at other locations – some of which are amongst the largest monoliths in the world.

The sun god&#x27;s shrine was built so that it has light focused upon it during the winter solstice.

In 2009, UCLA launched a website dedicated to virtual reality digital reconstructions of the Karnak complex and other resources.

==History==
The history of the Karnak complex is largely the history of Thebes and its changing role in the culture. Religious centers varied by region, and when a new capital of the unified culture was established, the religious centers in that area gained prominence. The city of Thebes does not appear to have been of great significance before the Eleventh Dynasty and previous temple building there would have been relatively small, with shrines being dedicated to the early deities of Thebes, the Earth goddess Mut and Montu. Early building was destroyed by invaders. The earliest known artifact found in the area of the temple is a small, eight-sided column from the Eleventh Dynasty, which mentions Amun-Re. Amun (sometimes called Amen) was long the local tutelary deity of Thebes. He was identified with the ram and the goose. The Egyptian meaning of Amun is &quot;hidden&quot; or the &quot;hidden god&quot;.
Major construction work in the Precinct of Amun-Re took place during the Eighteenth Dynasty, when Thebes became the capital of the unified Ancient Egypt. Almost every pharaoh of that dynasty added something to the temple site. Thutmose I erected an enclosure wall connecting the Fourth and Fifth pylons, which comprise the earliest part of the temple still standing &quot;in situ&quot;. Hatshepsut had monuments constructed and also restored the original Precinct of Mut, that had been ravaged by the foreign rulers during the Hyksos occupation. She had twin obelisks, at the time the tallest in the world, erected at the entrance to the temple. One still stands, as the second-tallest ancient obelisk still standing on Earth; the other has toppled and is broken.

Another of her projects at the site, Karnak&#x27;s Red Chapel or Chapelle Rouge, was intended as a barque shrine and originally may have stood between her two obelisks. She later ordered the construction of two more obelisks to celebrate her sixteenth year as pharaoh; one of the obelisks broke during construction, and thus, a third was constructed to replace it. The broken obelisk was left at its quarrying site in Aswan, where it still remains. Known as the unfinished obelisk, it provides evidence of how obelisks were quarried.
Construction of the Great Hypostyle Hall also may have begun during the Eighteenth Dynasty (although most new building was undertaken under Seti I and Ramesses II in the Nineteenth). Merneptah, also of the Nineteenth Dynasty, commemorated his victories over the Sea Peoples on the walls of the Cachette Court, the start of the processional route (also known as the Avenue of Sphinxes) to the Luxor Temple. The last major change to the Precinct of Amun-Re&#x27;s layout was the addition of the First Pylon and the massive enclosure walls that surround the precinct, both constructed by Nectanebo I of the Thirtieth Dynasty.

Ancient Greek and Roman writers wrote about a range of monuments in Upper Egypt and Nubia, including Karnak, Luxor temple, the Colossi of Memnon, Esna, Edfu, Kom Ombo, Philae, and others.

In 323 AD, Roman emperor Constantine the Great recognized the Christian religion, and in 356 Constantius II ordered the closing of pagan temples throughout the Roman empire, into which Egypt had been annexed in 30 BC. Karnak was by this time mostly abandoned, and Christian churches were founded among the ruins, the most famous example of this is the reuse of the Festival Hall of Thutmose III&#x27;s central hall, where painted decorations of saints and Coptic inscriptions can still be seen.

===European knowledge of Karnak===
Thebes&#x27; exact placement was unknown in medieval Europe, though both Herodotus and Strabo give the exact location of Thebes and how long up the Nile one must travel to reach it. Maps of Egypt, based on the 2nd century Claudius Ptolemaeus&#x27; mammoth work &quot;Geographia&quot;, had been circulating in Europe since the late 14th century, all of them showing Thebes&#x27; (Diospolis) location. Despite this, several European authors of the 15th and 16th centuries who visited only Lower Egypt and published their travel accounts, such as Joos van Ghistele and André Thévet, put Thebes in or close to Memphis.
The first European description of the Karnak temple complex was by unknown Venetian in 1589 and is housed in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze, although his account gives no name for the complex.

Karnak (&quot;Carnac&quot;) as a village name, and name of the complex, is first attested in 1668, when two capuchin missionary brothers, Protais and Charles François d&#x27;Orléans, travelled though the area. Protais&#x27; writing about their travel was published by Melchisédech Thévenot (&quot;Relations de divers voyages curieux&quot;, 1670s–1696 editions) and Johann Michael Vansleb (&quot;The Present State of Egypt&quot;, 1678).

The first drawing of Karnak is found in Paul Lucas&#x27; travel account of 1704, (&quot;Voyage du Sieur Paul Lucas au Levant&quot;). It is rather inaccurate, and can be quite confusing to modern eyes. Lucas travelled in Egypt during 1699–1703. The drawing shows a mixture of the Precinct of Amun-Re and the Precinct of Montu, based on a complex confined by the three huge Ptolemaic gateways of Ptolemy III Euergetes / Ptolemy IV Philopator, and the massive long, high and thick, First Pylon of the Precinct of Amun-Re.

Karnak was visited and described in succession by Claude Sicard and his travel companion Pierre Laurent Pincia (1718 and 1720–21), Granger (1731), Frederick Louis Norden (1737–38), Richard Pococke (1738), James Bruce (1769), Charles-Nicolas-Sigisbert Sonnini de Manoncourt (1777), William George Browne (1792–93), and finally by a number of scientists of the Napoleon expedition, including Vivant Denon, during 1798–1799. Claude-Étienne Savary describes the complex in rather great detail in his work of 1785; especially in light of the fact that it is a fictional account of a pretend journey to Upper Egypt, composed out of information from other travellers. Savary did visit Lower Egypt in 1777–78, and published a work about that too.

==Main parts==

===Precinct of Amun-Re===
This is the largest of the precincts of the temple complex, and is dedicated to Amun-Re, the chief deity of the Theban Triad. There are several colossal statues, including the figure of Pinedjem I which is tall. The sandstone for this temple, including all of the columns, was transported from Gebel Silsila south on the Nile river. It also has one of the largest obelisks, weighing 328 tons and standing tall.

===Precinct of Mut===
Located to the south of the newer Amun-Re complex, this precinct was dedicated to the mother goddess, Mut, who became identified as the wife of Amun-Re in the Eighteenth Dynasty Theban Triad. It has several smaller temples associated with it and has its own sacred lake, constructed in a crescent shape. This temple has been ravaged, many portions having been used in other structures. Following excavation and restoration works by the Johns Hopkins University team, led by Betsy Bryan (see below) the Precinct of Mut has been opened to the public. Six hundred black granite statues were found in the courtyard to her temple. It may be the oldest portion of the site.

In 2006, Bryan presented her findings of a festival that included apparent intentional overindulgence in alcohol. Participation in the festival included the priestesses and the population. Historical records of tens of thousands attending the festival exist. These findings were made in the temple of Mut because when Thebes rose to greater prominence, Mut absorbed the warrior goddesses, Sekhmet and Bast, as some of her aspects. First, Mut became Mut-Wadjet-Bast, then Mut-Sekhmet-Bast (Wadjet having merged into Bast), then Mut also assimilated Menhit, another lioness goddess, and her adopted son&#x27;s wife, becoming Mut-Sekhmet-Bast-Menhit, and finally becoming Mut-Nekhbet.

Temple excavations at Luxor discovered a &quot;porch of drunkenness&quot; built onto the temple by the pharaoh Hatshepsut, during the height of her twenty-year reign. In a later myth developed around the annual drunken Sekhmet festival, Ra, by then the sun god of Upper Egypt, created her from a fiery eye gained from his mother, to destroy mortals who conspired against him (Lower Egypt). In the myth, Sekhmet&#x27;s blood-lust was not quelled at the end of the battle and led to her destroying almost all of humanity, so Ra had tricked her by turning the Nile as red as blood (the Nile turns red every year when filled with silt during inundation) so that Sekhmet would drink it. The trick, however, was that the red liquid was not blood, but beer mixed with pomegranate juice so that it resembled blood, making her so drunk that she gave up slaughter and became an aspect of the gentle Hathor. The complex interweaving of deities occurred over the thousands of years of the culture.
===Precinct of Montu===

This portion of the site is dedicated to the son of Mut and Amun-Re, Montu, a war-god. It is located to the north of the Amun-Re complex and is much smaller in size. It is not open to the public.

===Temple of Amenhotep IV (deliberately dismantled)===

The temple that Akhenaten (Amenhotep IV) constructed on the site was located east of the main complex, outside the walls of the Amun-Re precinct. It was destroyed immediately after the death of its builder, who had attempted to overcome the powerful priesthood who had gained control over Egypt before his reign. It was so thoroughly demolished that its full extent and layout is unknown. The priesthood of that temple regained their powerful position as soon as Akhenaten died, and were instrumental in destroying many records of his existence.

<doc id="158390" wikidata="Q1382713" url="?curid=158390" title="Newmarket, Suffolk">
<text>Newmarket is a market town and civil parish in the West Suffolk district of Suffolk, England, 14 miles west of Bury St Edmunds and 14 miles northeast of Cambridge. In 2021, it had a population of 16,772. It is a global centre for thoroughbred horse racing, racehorse training, breeding, and horse health. Two Classic races and three British Champions Series races are held at Newmarket every year. The town has had close royal connections since the time of James I, who built a palace there, and was also a base for Charles I, Charles II, and most monarchs since. Elizabeth II visited the town often to see her horses in training.

Newmarket has over fifty horse training stables, two large racetracks, the Rowley Mile and the July Course, and one of the most extensive and prestigious horse training grounds in the world. The town is home to over 3,500 racehorses, and it is estimated that one in every three local jobs is related to horse racing. Palace House, the National Heritage Centre for Horseracing and Sporting Art, the National Horseracing Museum, Tattersalls racehorse auctioneers, and two of the world&#x27;s foremost equine hospitals for horse health, are in the town, which is surrounded by over sixty horse breeding studs. On account of its leading position in the multibillion-pound horse racing and breeding industry, it is also a major export centre.

==History==

Newmarket&#x27;s name was first recorded in Latin as &quot;Novo Mercato&quot; in 1219 (according to The National Archives, Feet of Fines CP25/1/23/9). The &quot;Novum Forum&quot; c.1200 recorded in many placename dictionaries such as that by Mills, is an error; this was actually the surname &quot;de novo foro&quot; of a man from Yorkshire who had no connection to Newmarket. In 1223, Richard de Argentein was granted licence to hold an annual fair in Newmarket (from The National Archives, Henry III Fine Roll C60/18).

James I first visited Newmarket in February 1605, describing it as a &quot;poor little village&quot;. From 1606 to 1610, he built the Newmarket Palace, an estate covering of land from the High Street to All Saints&#x27; churchyard, and thus established the town as a royal resort. This also made Newmarket a horseracing town. The first palace building suffered from subsidence and sank on one side when King James was in residence in March 1613. Simon Basil, and later, Inigo Jones, were commissioned to build new lodgings for the King and the Prince of Wales. Jones&#x27;s design had three storeys and was Italianate in style.

In 1642, Charles I met a parliamentary deputation in Newmarket that demanded his surrender of the armed forces. &quot;By God not for an hour&quot;, Charles replied, &quot;You have asked such of me that was never asked of a King!&quot; This effectively started the English Civil War. Newmarket remained Royalist throughout the war. In early June 1647, Charles was captured at Holdenby House in Northamptonshire and brought to Newmarket as a prisoner. He was placed under house arrest in the palace while the whole of Cromwell&#x27;s New Model Army kept guard over the town. A survey in 1649 showed that the palace was in disrepair. The following year, the palace was sold to John Okey (one of the regicides), who demolished most of the buildings.

Between 1666 and 1685, Charles II often visited Newmarket. In 1668, he commissioned William Samwell to build a new palace on the High Street (on the site of the present United Reformed Church). However, in 1670, John Evelyn said that the palace was &quot;meane enough, and hardly capable for a hunting house, let alone a royal palace!&quot; In October 1677 and October 1695, William of Orange visited Newmarket.

 In 1791 the Prince of Wales&#x27; horse Escape, ridden by Samuel Chifney, lost a race and then won one the next day, raising suspicions he&#x27;d lost the first race on purpose to raise the betting odds. Jockey Club stewards Charles Bunbury, Ralph Dutton and Thomas Panton told the prince that if he continued to employ Chifney, &quot;no gentleman would start against him&quot;. The prince instead announced he would no longer race at all. He sold his stable and, despite pleas from the Jockey Club, never returned to Newmarket.

At the start of the 19th century, the palace was largely demolished, but a section survives and is now named Palace House. During the 1800s, Newmarket south of the High Street spread into the parishes of Woodditton and Cheveley in Cambridgeshire. In 1894, the county border was moved to accommodate this, and has been further altered since.

On 15 December 1977, an F111-F jet fighter crashed at Exning near Newmarket, owing to hydraulic failure.

Aired on 12 February 2012, the British television series &quot;Time Team&quot; excavated on the site of Charles II&#x27;s palace at Newmarket and found foundations of racehorse stables.

==Geography and governance==

The area of Suffolk containing Newmarket is nearly an exclave, with only a narrow strip of territory linking it to the rest of the county. There are three tiers of local government covering Newmarket, at parish (town), district, and county level: Newmarket Town Council, West Suffolk District Council, and Suffolk County Council.

The town lies in the Parliamentary constituency of West Suffolk, which since 2024 has been represented by MP Nick Timothy.

===Administrative history===
Historically the town was split between parishes and counties, with one parish – St Mary – in Suffolk, and the other – All Saints – in Cambridgeshire. The boundary between the two parishes followed the High Street through the middle of the town, with St Mary&#x27;s parish and Suffolk to the north, and All Saints&#x27; parish and Cambridgeshire to the south. In 1851 a local board of health was established to govern the town, with its territory covering the two Newmarket parishes and parts of the neighbouring parishes of Exning (Suffolk) and Woodditton (Cambridgeshire).

The Local Government Act 1888 established county councils, and directed that urban sanitary districts such as Newmarket Local Board should not straddle county boundaries. As such, the whole local board district was brought within West Suffolk on 1 April 1889. The Local Government Act 1894 established elected parish and district councils, with Newmarket Local Board becoming Newmarket Urban District Council on 31 December 1894. Newmarket Urban District Council held its first meeting on 31 December 1894 at Newmarket Town Hall at 29 High Street, a converted theatre which had previously been used by the old local board for meetings. The first chairman of the urban district council was Joseph Rogers, who had been the last chairman of the local board. On 1 October 1895 the urban district was enlarged by absorbing the rest of Exning parish and additional areas from Woodditton parish (the latter being added to the civil parish of Newmarket All Saints). Thereafter Newmarket Urban District covered three civil parishes: Newmarket St Mary, Newmarket All Saints, and Exning. These were urban parishes and so did not have parish councils of their own, but were directly administered by Newmarket Urban District Council.

The urban district council was based at the Town Hall at 29 High Street until 1922, when it moved to Godolphin House at 2 The Avenue, and sold the Town Hall to be converted into commercial premises. By 1937 the council had moved its main offices to Stratford House at 29 Old Station Road, but continued to use Godolphin House for some departments. Around 1948 the council acquired Severals House at 3 Bury Road, which then served as its offices and meeting place until the council&#x27;s abolition in 1974. Newmarket Urban District Council was granted a coat of arms on 15 November 1951.

The Local Government Commission for England suggested in the 1960s that the border around Newmarket could be altered in West Suffolk&#x27;s favour. Conversely, the 1972 Local Government Bill, as originally proposed, would have transferred the town (and Haverhill) to Cambridgeshire. Newmarket Urban District Council supported the move to Cambridgeshire, but ultimately the government decided to withdraw this proposal and keep the existing boundary, despite lobbying from the Urban District Council.

Newmarket Urban District was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, merging with neighbouring Mildenhall Rural District to become Forest Heath District on 1 April 1974. No successor parish was created for the former urban district, and so it became an unparished area, remaining unparished until 1999 when the area was split between two parishes called Newmarket and Exning, with the parish council for Newmarket adopting the name Newmarket Town Council. Forest Heath District Council had its main offices at Mildenhall. Forest Heath merged with neighbouring St Edmundsbury in 2019 to become West Suffolk, administered from Bury St Edmunds.

==Connections to horse racing and training==

Racing at Newmarket has been dated as far back as 1174, making it the earliest known racing venue of post-classical times. King James I (reigned 1603–1625) greatly increased the popularity of horse racing there, and King Charles I followed this by inaugurating the first cup race in 1634. The Jockey Club&#x27;s clubhouse is in Newmarket, though its administration is based in London.

===Stables and training industry===

Around 3,000 race horses are stabled in and around Newmarket. By comparison, the human population is of the order of 15,000 and it is estimated that one in three jobs are connected to horseracing in one way or another. Newmarket has 3 main sections of Heath, all of which are used to train the racehorses on. The grassland of Newmarket&#x27;s training grounds has been developed over hundreds of years of careful maintenance, and is generally regarded as some of the finest in the world. &quot;Racecourse side&quot; is located next to the Rowley Mile Racecourse and is a predominately flat area. &quot;Warren Hill&quot; overlooks the town and consists of three all-weather canters and a multitude of grass canters. &quot;Bury Side&quot; is the name given to the area located near the Bury Road and the railway line. These areas and the surrounding heath is chalk downland and has special birds and animals only suited to this terrain. It is also a very historical area with the remains of 6th century living. This hill is part of the chalk formation the Newmarket Ridge. The town has of turf gallops and over of artificial track.

Most of the Newmarket-based racing stables are situated in the centre of the town, where they can easily access the gallops. The town has special horse routes so the horses can reach the gallops safely from the many training establishments occupied by top trainers. Many of the world&#x27;s most successful trainers are based in Newmarket, Sir Michael Stoute who is based at Freemason Lodge, John Gosden, based at Clarehaven Stables, Saeed bin Suroor, based at Stanley House Stables and Charlie Appleby based at Moulton Paddocks. Millions of pounds of prize money are won by these trainers alone around the world each year. Many of the horses they train are worth over £1 million, with some of the finest being worth between £5 million and £50 million or higher. Outside the town the land-use is dominated by thoroughbred breeding, studs occupying large areas in every direction. Around seventy licensed trainers and more than sixty stud farms operate in and around Newmarket.

Newmarket has three major public horse exercise grounds: Warren Hill (including the Long Hill exercise grounds), Racecourse Side (situated between and alongside Newmarket Racecourses&#x27;s Rowley Mile and July Courses), and the Limekilns (include the Al Bahatri all-weather grounds). Godolphin also operate two large private horse exercise grounds near their Godolphin Stables and Moulton Paddocks stables.

===Horse racing===

The town has two race courses situated on Newmarket Heath, The Rowley Mile and The July Course. The Rowley Mile is the home of Newmarket&#x27;s two Classic races, the 2,000 Guineas and the 1,000 Guineas, two of the world&#x27;s most prestigious races, run in the first weekend of May every year. The value of the winners of these races are often immediately increases by millions of pounds. It is also the home of Future Champions Day, run the weekend before Champions Day at Ascot, which includes the very important Dewhurst Stakes. The July Course is the home of the July Cup, the Falmouth Stakes and a number of other very important races. The two courses are separated by the Devil&#x27;s Dyke. This large earthwork starts in neighbouring Woodditton (sometimes spelt as Wood Ditton) and ends in Reach, a distance of over .

===Horse breeding===

Newmarket is the UK centre for the multibillion-pound racehorse breeding industry, and a key global centre of the business. Thoroughbred breeding lines are a core part of success in global horse racing, and key stallions are controlled by major global breeding operations, which operate studs around the town. Darley Stud, owners of New Approach, Cape Cross, Dubawi, Sepoy and Raven&#x27;s Pass own large areas of land to the south of the town. Shadwell Stud, another major global operation, have a number of studs nearby and own Nayef, Sakhee, Haafhd and Eswarah. Juddmonte Farms, owner of Frankel, Observatory, Dansili, Champs Elysees and Three Valleys, also have a large stud nearby. Cheveley Park Stud, owners of Pivotal, Mayson and Medicean are based next to the town, as are Lanwades Stud, owners of Aussie Rules, Hernando and Sir Percy. Newsells Park Stud, owners of Equiano and The Royal Studs, owners of Motivator also operate there. In 1967 Queen Elizabeth II opened The National Stud, a breeding centre for thoroughbred horses. Other parts of the town are also surrounded by some of the world&#x27;s largest and most successful horse breeding studs.

===Horse health and welfare===

The town is home to two of the most advanced equine hospitals in the world, the Newmarket Equine Hospital and Rossdales.

===Museums of horse racing===

Newmarket is home to Britain&#x27;s National Heritage Centre for Horseracing and Sporting Art at Palace House, the National Horseracing Museum, the Sporting Art Trust and a base of Retraining of Racehorses.

==Food and drink==

===Newmarket sausages===
The town is home to the PGI Protected Newmarket sausage. Produced since the 1880s, three local butchers in the town are entitled to produce these unique flavoured sausages.

The sausages are given as a prize for the Newmarket Town Plate, held each year at Newmarket racecourse.

==Culture and community==
Newmarket&#x27;s key role in sport for many centuries has made it a centre for many of Britain&#x27;s finest sporting painters. The development of painting on sporting themes in the early eighteenth century was centred on the Newmarket Racecourse and the three founders of the sporting school, John Wootton, James Seymour and Peter Tillemans, painted many scenes of the racecourse and its environs. Newmarket is also the setting for some of Sir Alfred Munnings&#x27;s most famous paintings.

The Save Historic Newmarket group, an organisation dedicated to maintaining the town&#x27;s unique heritage as the world headquarters of racing, has become increasingly vocal in recent years. The group, composed of local residents, supports sustainable development in the town and aims to make Newmarket a more attractive destination for visitors.

Newmarket railway station is on the Ipswich-Ely line, formerly belonging to the Great Eastern Railway (later part of the London &amp; North Eastern Railway). Newmarket&#x27;s first railway was a line built by the Newmarket and Chesterford Railway and opened in 1848 (known as the &quot;Newmarket Railway&quot;). It branched off the West Anglia Main Line at and ran about north-eastwards. There was an attractive terminus in Newmarket, with intermediate stations at , and .

Three years later the first or so of this line, the stretch from Great Chesterford to Six Mile Bottom, was superseded by a more viable section linking Six Mile Bottom directly with Cambridge, and so the Great Chesterford – Six Mile Bottom section closed in 1851, one of the earliest closures in British railway history (the former Bourne Bridge station is believed to have been partly incorporated into a public house just across the road from a station opened later on another line – Pampisford, on the now-closed Cambridge – Haverhill – Sudbury route). With the development of other rail lines the Newmarket terminus was replaced by the present through station in 1902; it was used as a goods station until 1967 and demolished in 1980.

A short distance to the north east is the 1,100-yard Warren Hill tunnel. North of the tunnel, a separate station, , was built for raceday use.

Regular bus services run to the neighbouring towns of Bury St Edmunds, Cambridge, Ely and Mildenhall. Various National Express coach services serve the town: London (Victoria Coach Station) to Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft; Norwich to Stansted, Heathrow and Gatwick Airports; and the cross country Clacton-on-Sea to Liverpool service which travels via Cambridge, Peterborough, Leicester, Nottingham, Sheffield and Manchester. In late 2006, Newmarket introduced a Park and Ride service running from Studlands industrial estate to the town centre, which was replaced by an hourly bus route, the number 11 (formerly number 10), whilst at the same time parking charges were introduced to the town. 

==Education==
Newmarket has a number of primary schools which feed into the 11–18 Newmarket Academy, the town&#x27;s only secondary school. The town is also home to an Air Training Corps Squadron (2417 Newmarket Squadron) and an Army Cadet Detachment.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia.Television signals are received from the Sandy Heath TV transmitter. 

The town is served by both BBC Radio Suffolk and BBC Radio Cambridgeshire including other radio stations Heart East, Star Radio, and Greatest Hits Radio Cambridgeshire. 

The local newspaper is the &quot;Newmarket Journal&quot;. 

==Sport and leisure==
Newmarket has two racecourses, The Rowley Mile and The July Course, and is home to 3,000 thoroughbred racehorses and over 70 racehorse trainers. The local football team is Newmarket Town. In 2005–06 the club reached the quarter finals of the FA Vase. Newmarket Hockey Club play field hockey, and Newmarket Cycling and Triathlon club is an amateur cycling club in the town.

A greyhound racing track was opened around the Cricket Field Road ground, the venue used by Newmarket Town FC. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. The track was active shortly after World War II and is known to have also been active during 1967. The date of closure is not known. An earlier instance of racing took place in 1933 at a venue described as the Duchess Drive Stadium.

<doc id="158392" wikidata="Q355350" url="?curid=158392" title="Servius the Grammarian">
<text>Servius, distinguished as Servius the Grammarian ( or ), was a late fourth-century and early fifth-century grammarian. He earned a contemporary reputation as the most learned man of his generation in Italy; he authored a set of commentaries on the works of Virgil. These works, (&quot;Exposition on Three Works of Virgil&quot;), (&quot;Commentaries on Virgil&quot;), (&quot;Commentaries on the Works of Vergil&quot;), or (&quot;Commentaries on the Poems of Virgil&quot;), constituted the first incunable to be printed at Florence, by Bernardo Cennini, in 1471.

In the &quot;Saturnalia&quot; of Macrobius, Servius appears as one of the interlocutors; allusions in that work and a letter from Symmachus to Servius indicate that he was not a convert to Christianity.

==Name==
The name Servius also appears as Seruius owing to the unity of the Latin letters V and U from antiquity until as late as the 18th century. Many medieval manuscripts of Servius&#x27;s commentaries give him the praenomen Marius or Maurus and the cognomen Honoratus. The authenticity of these namesshared by Christian saintsis now doubted.

== Commentary on Virgil==
The commentary on Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, , , , or survives in two distinct manuscript traditions. 

The first is a comparatively short commentary, attributed to Servius in the superscription in the manuscripts and by other internal evidence. The second class derive from the 10th and 11th centuries, embed the same text in a much expanded commentary. The copious additions are in contrasting style to the original; none of these manuscripts bears Servius&#x27; name, and the commentary is known traditionally as &quot;Servius auctus&quot; or &quot;Servius Danielis&quot;, from Pierre Daniel who first published it in 1600. 

&quot;The added matter is undoubtedly ancient, dating from a time but little removed from that of Servius, and is founded to a large extent on historical and antiquarian literature which is now lost. The writer is anonymous and probably a Christian&quot;, although one proposed author, Aelius Donatus, was a Christian. 

A third class of manuscripts, written for the most part in Italy, includes the core text with interpolated scholia, which demonstrate the continued usefulness of the &quot;Virgilii Opera Expositio&quot;.

==Other works==
Besides the Virgilian commentary, other works of Servius are extant: a collection of notes on the grammar (&quot;Ars grammatica&quot;) of Aelius Donatus; a treatise on metrical endings in verse (&quot;De finalibus&quot;); and a tract on the different poetic meters (&quot;De centum metris&quot;).

The edition of Georg Thilo and Hermann Hagen (1878–1902), remains the only edition of the whole of Servius&#x27; work. Currently in development is the Harvard Servius (&quot;Servianorum in Vergilii Carmina Commentariorum: Editionis Harvardianae&quot;); of the projected five volumes, two have so far appeared: ii (Aeneid 1–2), 1946, and iii (Aeneid 3–5), 1965.

<doc id="158395" wikidata="Q71606" url="?curid=158395" title="Georg Fabricius">
<text>Georg Fabricius (; 23 April 1516– 17 July 1571) was a Protestant German poet, historian and archaeologist who wrote in Latin during the German Renaissance.

== Life ==
Fabricius was born as Georg Goldschmidt in Chemnitz in Saxony on 23 April 1516. He was educated at the University of Leipzig. In 1546 he was appointed rector of Saint Afra in Meissen.

Travelling in Italy with one of his pupils, he made an exhaustive study of the antiquities of Rome. In 1549 Fabricius edited the first short selection of Roman inscriptions focusing specifically on legal texts. This was a key moment in the history of classical epigraphy: for the first time in print a humanist explicitly demonstrated the value of such archaeological remains for the discipline of law, and implicitly accorded texts inscribed in stone as authoritative a status as those recorded in manuscripts. He published fuller results in his &quot;Roma&quot;, in which the correspondence between every discoverable relic of the old city and the references to them in ancient literature was traced in detail. In his sacred poems he affected to avoid every word with the slightest savour of paganism; and he blamed the poets for their allusions to pagan divinities.

He encouraged music at his school, although he was not himself a musician. Some of his writings were set to music by composers such as Martin Agricola, Johann Walter, Mattheus Le Maistre, Antonio Scandello, and Wolfgang Figulus.

Fabricius died at Meissen on 17 July 1571.

<text>Beryllium copper (BeCu), also known as copper beryllium (CuBe), beryllium bronze, and spring copper, is a copper alloy with 0.5–3% beryllium. Copper beryllium alloys are often used because of their high strength and good conductivity of both heat and electricity. It is used for its ductility, weldability in metalworking, and machining properties. It has many specialized applications in tools for hazardous environments, musical instruments, precision measurement devices, bullets, and some uses in the field of aerospace. Beryllium copper and other beryllium alloys are harmful carcinogens that present a toxic inhalation hazard during manufacturing.

== Properties ==
Beryllium copper is a ductile, weldable, and machinable alloy. Like pure copper, it is resistant to non-oxidizing acids (such as hydrochloric acid and carbonic acid) and plastic decomposition products, to abrasive wear, and to galling. It can be heat-treated for increased strength, durability, and electrical conductivity. 

Beryllium copper attains the greatest strength (up to ) of any copper-based alloy. It has thermal conductivity of 62 Btu/h-ft-°F (107 W/m-K), which is 3–5 times higher than tool steel. It has a solid melting point of 1590 °F (866 °C) and a liquid melting point of 1800 °F (982 °C). It has a high capacity for being hot-formed. C17200 beryllium copper alloy has strength and hardness similar to that of steel; Rockwell hardness properties in its peaked age condition are in the range of 200 ksi and RC45.

C17200 has effective corrosion-resistant properties when exposed to harsh conditions such as seawater, and down-hole environments. It will withstand sulphide or chloride stress corrosion cracking and will resist the effects of carbon dioxide and hydrogen embrittlement. 

Copper alloys in general have always been considered non-sparking. C17200 has the strength to withstand use in hand and mechanical tools. These non-sparking features are best applied in explosive environments such as in the oil &amp; gas and gunpowder industries.

== Toxicity ==
Inhalation of dust, mist, or fumes containing beryllium can cause chronic beryllium disease, which restricts the exchange of oxygen between the lungs and the bloodstream. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) lists beryllium as a Group 1 human carcinogen. The National Toxicology Program (NTP) also lists beryllium as a carcinogen. Copper beryllium alloy containing less than 2.5% beryllium (in copper) is not designated as a carcinogen.

== Uses ==
Beryllium copper is a non-ferrous alloy used in springs, spring wire, load cells, and other parts that must retain their shape under repeated stress and strain. It has high electrical conductivity and is used in low-current contacts for batteries and electrical connectors.

Beryllium copper is non-sparking yet physically tough and nonmagnetic, fulfilling the requirements of ATEX directive for Zones 0, 1, and 2. Beryllium copper screwdrivers, pliers, wrenches, cold chisels, knives, and hammers are available for environments with explosive hazards, such as oil rigs, coal mines, and grain elevators. An alternative metal sometimes used for non-sparking tools is aluminium bronze. Compared to steel tools, beryllium copper tools are more expensive and not as strong, but the properties of beryllium copper in hazardous environments may outweigh the disadvantages. Some of BeCu&#x27;s varied uses include:

*Certain percussion instruments, especially tambourines and triangles, because of beryllium copper&#x27;s consistent tone and resonance.
*Ultra-low temperature cryogenic equipment, such as dilution refrigerators, because of its mechanical strength and relatively high thermal conductivity in this temperature range.
*Molds for manufacturing plastic containers (including most plastic milk jugs), with the blow molding process.
*Armour piercing bullets, though such an application is unusual, as bullets made from steel alloys are much less expensive and have similar properties.
*Measurement-while-drilling (MWD) tools in the directional drilling industry. A non-magnetic alloy is required, as magnetometers are used for field-strength data received from the tool.
*Servicing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines, where high-strength magnetic fields make the use of ferrous tools dangerous, and where magnetic materials in the field can disturb the image.
*Gaskets used to create an RF-tight (resistant to radio frequency leakage) seal, the electronic seal on doors used with EMC testing, and anechoic chambers.
*In the 1980s, beryllium copper was used in the manufacture of golf clubs, particularly wedges and putters. Though some golfers prefer the feel of beryllium copper club heads, regulatory concerns and high costs have made beryllium copper clubs difficult to find in current production.
*Kiefer Plating (defunct) of Elkhart, Indiana built beryllium-copper trumpet bells for the Schilke Music Co. of Chicago. These lightweight bells produce a sound preferred by some musicians.
*Beryllium copper wire is produced in many forms: round, square, flat, and shaped, in coils, on spools, and in straight lengths.
*Beryllium copper valve seats and guides are used in high-performance four-stroke engines with coated titanium valves. BeCu dissipates heat from the valve as much as seven times faster than powdered steel or iron seats and guides. The softer BeCu reduces valve wear and increases valve life.

== Age-hardened alloy ==
Beryllium copper (C17200 &amp; C17300) is an age-hardening alloy that attains the highest strength of any copper base alloy. It may be age hardened after forming into springs, intricate forms, or complex shapes. It is valued for its elasticity, corrosion resistance, stability, conductivity, and low creep.

Tempered beryllium copper is C17200 and C17300, which have been age-hardened and cold-drawn. No further heat treatment is necessary beyond possible light stress relief. It is sufficiently ductile to wind on its diameter and can be formed into springs and most shapes. The tempered wire is most useful where the properties of beryllium copper are desired, but the age-hardening of finished parts is not practical.

C17510 and C17500 beryllium copper alloys are age-hardenable and provide good electrical conductivity, physical properties, and wear-resistance. They are used in springs and wire where electrical conduction or retention of properties at elevated temperatures is important.

== Specialized variants ==
&quot;High-strength beryllium copper&quot; alloys contain as much as 2.7% beryllium (cast), or 1.6-2% beryllium with about 0.3% cobalt (wrought). The strength is achieved by age hardening. The thermal conductivity of these alloys lies between that of steel and aluminum. The cast alloys are frequently formed with injection molds. The wrought alloys are designated by UNS as C17200 to C17400, the cast alloys are C82000 to C82800. The hardening process requires rapid cooling of the annealed metal, resulting in a solid-state solution of beryllium in copper, which is then kept at 200-460 °C for at least an hour, producing a precipitation of metastable beryllide crystals in the copper matrix. Over-aging beyond the equilibrium phase depletes the beryllide crystals and reduces their strength. The beryllides in cast alloys are similar to those in wrought alloys.

&quot;High conductivity beryllium copper&quot; alloys contain as much as 0.7% beryllium with some nickel and cobalt. The thermal conductivity of these alloys is greater than that of aluminum and slightly less than that of pure copper; they are often used as electrical contacts.

<text>Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition that arises when the body&#x27;s response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

This initial stage of sepsis is followed by suppression of the immune system. Common signs and symptoms include fever, increased heart rate, increased breathing rate, and confusion. There may also be symptoms related to a specific infection, such as a cough with pneumonia, or painful urination with a kidney infection. The very young, old, and people with a weakened immune system may not have any symptoms that are specific to their infection, and their body temperature may be low or normal instead of constituting a fever. Severe sepsis causes poor organ function or blood flow. The presence of low blood pressure, high blood lactate, or low urine output may suggest poor blood flow. Septic shock is low blood pressure due to sepsis that does not improve after fluid replacement.

Sepsis is caused by many organisms including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Common locations for the primary infection include the lungs, brain, urinary tract, skin, and abdominal organs. Risk factors include being very young or old, a weakened immune system from conditions such as cancer or diabetes, major trauma, and burns. Previously, a sepsis diagnosis required the presence of at least two systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria in the setting of presumed infection. In 2016, a shortened sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA score), known as the quick SOFA score (qSOFA), replaced the SIRS system of diagnosis. qSOFA criteria for sepsis include at least two of the following three: increased breathing rate, change in the level of consciousness, and low blood pressure. Sepsis guidelines recommend obtaining blood cultures before starting antibiotics; however, the diagnosis does not require the blood to be infected. Medical imaging is helpful when looking for the possible location of the infection. Other potential causes of similar signs and symptoms include anaphylaxis, adrenal insufficiency, low blood volume, heart failure, and pulmonary embolism.

Sepsis requires immediate treatment with intravenous fluids and antimicrobial medications. Ongoing care and stabilization often continues in an intensive care unit. If an adequate trial of fluid replacement is not enough to maintain blood pressure, then the use of medications that raise blood pressure becomes necessary. Mechanical ventilation and dialysis may be needed to support the function of the lungs and kidneys, respectively. A central venous catheter and an arterial catheter may be placed for access to the bloodstream and to guide treatment. Other helpful measurements include cardiac output and superior vena cava oxygen saturation. People with sepsis need preventive measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and pressure ulcers unless other conditions prevent such interventions. Some people might benefit from tight control of blood sugar levels with insulin. The use of corticosteroids is controversial, with some reviews finding benefit, and others not.

Disease severity partly determines the outcome. The risk of death from sepsis is as high as 30%, while for severe sepsis it is as high as 50%, and the risk of death from septic shock is 80%. Sepsis affected about 49 million people in 2017, with 11 million deaths (1 in 5 deaths worldwide). In the developed world, approximately 0.2 to 3 people per 1000 are affected by sepsis yearly, resulting in about a million cases per year in the United States. Rates of disease have been increasing. Some data indicate that sepsis is more common among men than women, however, other data show a greater prevalence of the disease among women. Descriptions of sepsis date back to the time of Hippocrates.
== Signs and symptoms ==
In addition to symptoms related to the actual cause, people with sepsis may have a fever, low body temperature, rapid breathing, a fast heart rate, confusion, and edema. Early signs include a rapid heart rate, decreased urination, and high blood sugar. Signs of established sepsis include confusion, metabolic acidosis (which may be accompanied by a faster breathing rate that leads to respiratory alkalosis), low blood pressure due to decreased systemic vascular resistance, higher cardiac output, and disorders in blood-clotting that may lead to organ failure. Fever is the most common presenting symptom in sepsis, but fever may be absent in some people such as the elderly or those who are immunocompromised.

The drop in blood pressure seen in sepsis can cause lightheadedness and is part of the criteria for septic shock.

Oxidative stress is observed in septic shock, with circulating levels of copper and vitamin C being decreased.

Diastolic blood pressure falls during the early stages of sepsis, causing a widening/increasing of pulse pressure, which is the difference between the systolic and diastolic blood pressures. If sepsis becomes severe and hemodynamic compromise advances, the systolic pressure also decreases, causing a narrowing/decreasing of pulse pressure. A pulse pressure of over 70 mmHg in patients with sepsis is correlated with an increased chance of survival. A widened pulse pressure is also correlated with an increased chance that someone with sepsis will benefit from and respond to IV fluids.

== Cause ==

Infections leading to sepsis are usually bacterial but may be fungal, parasitic, or viral. Gram-positive bacteria were the primary cause of sepsis before the introduction of antibiotics in the 1950s. After the introduction of antibiotics, gram-negative bacteria became the predominant cause of sepsis from the 1960s to the 1980s. After the 1980s, gram-positive bacteria, most commonly staphylococci, are thought to cause more than 50% of cases of sepsis. Other commonly implicated bacteria include &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;, &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, and &quot;Klebsiella&quot; species. Fungal sepsis accounts for approximately 5% of severe sepsis and septic shock cases; the most common cause of fungal sepsis is an infection by &quot;Candida&quot; species of yeast, a frequent hospital-acquired infection. The most common causes for parasitic sepsis are &quot;Plasmodium&quot; (which leads to malaria), &quot;Schistosoma&quot; and &quot;Echinococcus&quot;.

The most common sites of infection resulting in severe sepsis are the lungs, the abdomen, and the urinary tract. Typically, 50% of all sepsis cases start as an infection in the lungs. In one-third to one-half of cases, the source of infection is unclear.

== Pathophysiology ==

Sepsis is caused by a combination of factors related to the particular invading pathogen(s) and the status of the immune system of the host. The early phase of sepsis characterized by excessive inflammation (sometimes resulting in a cytokine storm) may be followed by a prolonged period of decreased functioning of the immune system. Either of these phases may prove fatal. On the other hand, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) occurs in people without the presence of infection, for example, in those with burns, polytrauma, or the initial state in pancreatitis and chemical pneumonitis. However, sepsis also causes similar response to SIRS.

=== Microbial factors ===
Bacterial virulence factors, such as glycocalyx and various adhesins, allow colonization, immune evasion, and establishment of disease in the host. Sepsis caused by gram-negative bacteria is thought to be largely due to a response by the host to the lipid A component of lipopolysaccharide, also called endotoxin. Sepsis caused by gram-positive bacteria may result from an immunological response to cell wall lipoteichoic acid. Bacterial exotoxins that act as superantigens also may cause sepsis. Superantigens simultaneously bind major histocompatibility complex and T-cell receptors in the absence of antigen presentation. This forced receptor interaction induces the production of pro-inflammatory chemical signals (cytokines) by T-cells.

There are a number of microbial factors that may cause the typical septic inflammatory cascade. An invading pathogen is recognized by its pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Examples of PAMPs include lipopolysaccharides and flagellin in gram-negative bacteria, muramyl dipeptide in the peptidoglycan of the gram-positive bacterial cell wall, and CpG bacterial DNA. These PAMPs are recognized by the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system, which may be membrane-bound or cytosolic. There are four families of PRRs: the toll-like receptors, the C-type lectin receptors, the NOD-like receptors, and the RIG-I-like receptors. Invariably, the association of a PAMP and a PRR will cause a series of intracellular signalling cascades. Consequentially, transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappa B and activator protein-1, will up-regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

=== Host factors ===
Upon detection of microbial antigens, the host systemic immune system is activated. Immune cells not only recognise pathogen-associated molecular patterns but also damage-associated molecular patterns from damaged tissues. An uncontrolled immune response is then activated because leukocytes are not recruited to the specific site of infection, but instead, they are recruited all over the body. Then, an immunosuppression state ensues when the proinflammatory T helper cell 1 (TH1) is shifted to TH2, mediated by interleukin 10, which is known as &quot;compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome&quot;. The apoptosis (cell death) of lymphocytes further worsens the immunosuppression. Neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, CD4+ T cells, and B cells all undergo apoptosis, whereas regulatory T cells are more apoptosis-resistant. Subsequently, multiple organ failure ensues because tissues are unable to use oxygen efficiently due to inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase, possibly as part of a &quot;cell hibernation&quot; mechanism, in order to conserve oxygen.

Inflammatory responses cause multiple organ dysfunction syndrome through various mechanisms as described below. Increased permeability of the lung vessels causes leaking of fluids into alveoli, which results in pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Impaired utilization of oxygen in the liver impairs bile salt transport, causing jaundice (yellowish discoloration of the skin). In kidneys, inadequate oxygenation results in tubular epithelial cell injury (of the cells lining the kidney tubules), and thus causes acute kidney injury (AKI). Meanwhile, in the heart, impaired calcium transport, and low production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), can cause myocardial depression, reducing cardiac contractility and causing heart failure. In the gastrointestinal tract, increased permeability of the mucosa alters the microflora, causing mucosal bleeding and paralytic ileus. In the central nervous system, direct damage of the brain cells and disturbances of neurotransmissions causes altered mental status. Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1, and interleukin 6 may activate procoagulation factors in the cells lining blood vessels, leading to endothelial damage. The damaged endothelial surface inhibits anticoagulant properties as well as increases antifibrinolysis, which may lead to intravascular clotting, the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels, and multiple organ failure.

The low blood pressure seen in those with sepsis is the result of various processes, including excessive production of chemicals that dilate blood vessels such as nitric oxide, a deficiency of chemicals that constrict blood vessels such as vasopressin, and activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels. In those with severe sepsis and septic shock, this sequence of events leads to a type of circulatory shock known as distributive shock.

== Diagnosis ==
Early diagnosis is necessary to properly manage sepsis, as the initiation of rapid therapy is key to reducing deaths from severe sepsis. Some hospitals use alerts generated from electronic health records to bring attention to potential cases as early as possible.

Within the first three hours of suspected sepsis, diagnostic studies should include white blood cell counts, measuring serum lactate, and obtaining appropriate cultures before starting antibiotics, so long as this does not delay their use by more than 45 minutes. To identify the causative organism(s), at least two sets of blood cultures using bottles with media for aerobic and anaerobic organisms are necessary. At least one should be drawn through the skin and one through each vascular access device (such as an IV catheter) that has been in place for more than 48 hours. Bacteria are present in the blood in only about 30% of cases. Another possible method of detection is by polymerase chain reaction. If other sources of infection are suspected, cultures of these sources, such as urine, cerebrospinal fluid, wounds, or respiratory secretions, also should be obtained, as long as this does not delay the use of antibiotics.

Within six hours, if blood pressure remains low despite initial fluid resuscitation of 30 mL/kg, or if initial lactate is ≥ four mmol/L (36 mg/dL), central venous pressure and central venous oxygen saturation should be measured. Lactate should be re-measured if the initial lactate was elevated. Evidence for point of care lactate measurement over usual methods of measurement, however, is poor.

Within twelve hours, it is essential to diagnose or exclude any source of infection that would require emergent source control, such as a necrotizing soft tissue infection, an infection causing inflammation of the abdominal cavity lining, an infection of the bile duct, or an intestinal infarction. A pierced internal organ (free air on an abdominal X-ray or CT scan), an abnormal chest X-ray consistent with pneumonia (with focal opacification), or petechiae, purpura, or purpura fulminans may indicate the presence of an infection.

=== Definitions ===
Previously, SIRS criteria had been used to define sepsis. If the SIRS criteria are negative, it is very unlikely the person has sepsis; if it is positive, there is just a moderate probability that the person has sepsis. According to SIRS, there were different levels of sepsis: sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock. The definition of SIRS is shown below:
* SIRS is the presence of two or more of the following: abnormal body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, or blood gas, and white blood cell count.
* &quot;Sepsis&quot; is defined as SIRS in response to an infectious process.
* &quot;Severe sepsis&quot; is defined as sepsis with sepsis-induced organ dysfunction or tissue hypoperfusion (manifesting as hypotension, elevated lactate, or decreased urine output). Severe sepsis is an infectious disease state associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)
* &quot;Septic shock&quot; is severe sepsis plus persistently low blood pressure, despite the administration of intravenous fluids.

In 2016 a new consensus was reached to replace screening by systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA score) and the abbreviated version (qSOFA). The three criteria for the qSOFA score include a respiratory rate greater than or equal to 22 breaths per minute, systolic blood pressure 100 mmHg or less, and altered mental status. Sepsis is suspected when 2 of the qSOFA criteria are met. The SOFA score was intended to be used in the intensive care unit (ICU) where it is administered upon admission to the ICU and then repeated every 48 hours, whereas the qSOFA could be used outside the ICU. Some advantages of the qSOFA score are that it can be administered quickly and does not require labs. However, the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) raised concerns that qSOFA and SOFA criteria may lead to delayed diagnosis of serious infection, leading to delayed treatment. Although SIRS criteria can be too sensitive and not specific enough in identifying sepsis, SOFA also has its limitations and is not intended to replace the SIRS definition. qSOFA has also been found to be poorly sensitive though decently specific for the risk of death with SIRS possibly better for screening. NOTE - Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 Guidelines recommend &quot;against using qSOFA compared with SIRS, NEWS, or MEWS as a single screening tool for sepsis or septic shock&quot;.

=== End-organ dysfunction ===

Examples of end-organ dysfunction include the following:
* Lungs: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt; 300), different ratio in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome
* Brain: encephalopathy symptoms including agitation, confusion, and coma; causes may include ischemia, bleeding, formation of blood clots in small blood vessels, microabscesses, multifocal necrotizing leukoencephalopathy
* Liver: disruption of protein synthetic function manifests acutely as progressive disruption of blood clotting due to an inability to synthesize clotting factors and disruption of metabolic functions leads to impaired bilirubin metabolism, resulting in elevated unconjugated serum bilirubin levels
* Kidney: low urine output or no urine output, electrolyte abnormalities, or volume overload
* Heart: systolic and diastolic heart failure, likely due to chemical signals that depress myocyte function, cellular damage, manifest as a troponin leak (although not necessarily ischemic in nature)

More specific definitions of end-organ dysfunction exist for SIRS in pediatrics.
* Cardiovascular dysfunction (after fluid resuscitation with at least 40 mL/kg of crystalloid)
** hypotension with blood pressure &lt; 5th percentile for age or systolic blood pressure &lt; 2 standard deviations below normal for age, or
** vasopressor requirement, or
** Two of the following criteria:
*** unexplained metabolic acidosis with base deficit &gt; 5 mEq/L
*** lactic acidosis: serum lactate 2 times the upper limit of normal
*** oliguria (urine output )
*** prolonged capillary refill &gt; 5 seconds
*** core to peripheral temperature difference 
* Respiratory dysfunction (in the absence of a cyanotic heart defect or a known chronic respiratory disease)
** the ratio of the arterial partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of oxygen in the gases inspired (PaO2/FiO2) &lt; 300 (the definition of acute lung injury), or
** arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) &gt; 65 torr (20 mmHg) over baseline PaCO2 (evidence of hypercapnic respiratory failure), or
** supplemental oxygen requirement of greater than FiO2 0.5 to maintain oxygen saturation ≥ 92%
* Neurologic dysfunction
** Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) ≤ 11, or
** altered mental status with a drop in GCS of 3 or more points in a person with developmental delay/intellectual disability
* Hematologic dysfunction
** platelet count or 50% drop from the maximum in chronically thrombocytopenic, or
** international normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 2
** Disseminated intravascular coagulation
* Kidney dysfunction
** serum creatinine ≥ 2 times the upper limit of normal for age or 2-fold increase in baseline creatinine in people with chronic kidney disease
* Liver dysfunction (only applicable to infants &gt; 1 month)
** total serum bilirubin ≥ 4 mg/dL, or
** alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 2 times the upper limit of normal

Consensus definitions, however, continue to evolve, with the latest expanding the list of signs and symptoms of sepsis to reflect clinical bedside experience.

=== Biomarkers ===
Biomarkers can help with diagnosis because they can point to the presence or severity of sepsis, although their exact role in the management of sepsis remains undefined. A 2013 review concluded moderate-quality evidence exists to support the use of the procalcitonin level as a method to distinguish sepsis from non-infectious causes of SIRS. The same review found the sensitivity of the test to be 77% and the specificity to be 79%. The authors suggested that procalcitonin may serve as a helpful diagnostic marker for sepsis, but cautioned that its level alone does not definitively make the diagnosis. More current literature recommends utilizing the PCT to direct antibiotic therapy for improved antibiotic stewardship and better patient outcomes.

A 2012 systematic review found that soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (SuPAR) is a nonspecific marker of inflammation and does not accurately diagnose sepsis. This same review concluded, however, that SuPAR has prognostic value, as higher SuPAR levels are associated with an increased rate of death in those with sepsis. Serial measurement of lactate levels (approximately every 4 to 6 hours) may guide treatment and is associated with lower mortality in sepsis.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
The differential diagnosis for sepsis is broad and has to examine (to exclude) the non-infectious conditions that may cause the systemic signs of SIRS: alcohol withdrawal, acute pancreatitis, burns, pulmonary embolism, thyrotoxicosis, anaphylaxis, adrenal insufficiency, and neurogenic shock. Hyperinflammatory syndromes such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) may have similar symptoms and are on the differential diagnosis.

=== Neonatal sepsis ===
In common clinical usage, neonatal sepsis refers to a bacterial blood stream infection in the first month of life, such as meningitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, or gastroenteritis, but neonatal sepsis also may be due to infection with fungi, viruses, or parasites. Criteria with regard to hemodynamic compromise or respiratory failure are not useful because they present too late for intervention.

== Management ==

Early recognition and focused management may improve the outcomes of sepsis. Current professional recommendations include several actions (&quot;bundles&quot;) to be followed as soon as possible after diagnosis. Within the first three hours, someone with sepsis should have received antibiotics, and intravenous fluids if there is evidence of either low blood pressure or other evidence for inadequate blood supply to organs (as evidenced by a raised level of lactate); blood cultures also should be obtained within this period. After six hours the blood pressure should be adequate, close monitoring of blood pressure and blood supply to organs should be in place, and the lactate should be measured again if initially it was raised. A related bundle, the &quot;Sepsis Six&quot;, is in widespread use in the United Kingdom; this requires the administration of antibiotics within an hour of recognition, blood cultures, lactate, and hemoglobin determination, urine output monitoring, high-flow oxygen, and intravenous fluids.

Apart from the timely administration of fluids and antibiotics, the management of sepsis also involves surgical drainage of infected fluid collections and appropriate support for organ dysfunction. This may include hemodialysis in kidney failure, mechanical ventilation in lung dysfunction, transfusion of blood products, and drug and fluid therapy for circulatory failure. Ensuring adequate nutrition—preferably by enteral feeding, but if necessary, by parenteral nutrition—is important during prolonged illness. Medication to prevent deep vein thrombosis and gastric ulcers also may be used.

=== Antibiotics ===

Two sets of blood cultures (aerobic and anaerobic) are recommended without delaying the initiation of antibiotics. Cultures from other sites such as respiratory secretions, urine, wounds, cerebrospinal fluid, and catheter insertion sites (in situ for more than 48 hours) are recommended if infections from these sites are suspected. In severe sepsis and septic shock, broad-spectrum antibiotics (usually two, a β-lactam antibiotic with broad coverage, or broad-spectrum carbapenem combined with fluoroquinolones, macrolides, or aminoglycosides) are recommended. The choice of antibiotics is important in determining the survival of the person. Some recommend they be given within one hour of making the diagnosis, stating that for every hour of delay in the administration of antibiotics, there is an associated 6% rise in mortality. Others did not find a benefit with early administration.

Several factors determine the most appropriate choice for the initial antibiotic regimen. These factors include local patterns of bacterial sensitivity to antibiotics, whether the infection is thought to be a hospital or community-acquired infection, and which organ systems are thought to be infected. Antibiotic regimens should be reassessed daily and narrowed if appropriate. Treatment duration is typically 7–10 days with the type of antibiotic used directed by the results of cultures. If the culture result is negative, antibiotics should be de-escalated according to the person&#x27;s clinical response or stopped altogether if an infection is not present to decrease the chances that the person is infected with multiple drug resistance organisms. In case of people having a high risk of being infected with multiple drug resistant organisms such as &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, &quot;Acinetobacter baumannii&quot;, the addition of an antibiotic specific to the gram-negative organism is recommended. For methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA), vancomycin or teicoplanin is recommended. For &quot;Legionella&quot; infection, addition of macrolide or fluoroquinolone is chosen. If fungal infection is suspected, an echinocandin, such as caspofungin or micafungin, is chosen for people with severe sepsis, followed by triazole (fluconazole and itraconazole) for less ill people. Prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended in people who has SIRS without any infectious origin such as acute pancreatitis and burns unless sepsis is suspected.

Once-daily dosing of aminoglycoside is sufficient to achieve peak plasma concentration for a clinical response without kidney toxicity. Meanwhile, for antibiotics with low volume distribution (vancomycin, teicoplanin, colistin), a loading dose is required to achieve an adequate therapeutic level to fight infections. Frequent infusions of beta-lactam antibiotics without exceeding the total daily dose would help to keep the antibiotics level above minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), thus providing a better clinical response. Giving beta-lactam antibiotics continuously may be better than giving them intermittently. Access to therapeutic drug monitoring is important to ensure adequate drug therapeutic level while at the same time preventing the drug from reaching a toxic level.

=== Intravenous fluids ===
The Surviving Sepsis Campaign has recommended 30 mL/kg of fluid to be given in adults in the first three hours followed by fluid titration according to blood pressure, urine output, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation with a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg. In children an initial amount of 20 mL/kg is reasonable in shock. In cases of severe sepsis and septic shock where a central venous catheter is used to measure blood pressures dynamically, fluids should be administered until the central venous pressure reaches 8–12 mmHg. Once these goals are met, the central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2), i.e., the oxygen saturation of venous blood as it returns to the heart as measured at the vena cava, is optimized. If the ScvO2 is less than 70%, blood may be given to reach a hemoglobin of 10 g/dL and then inotropes are added until the ScvO2 is optimized. In those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sufficient tissue blood fluid, more fluids should be given carefully.

Crystalloid solution is recommended as the fluid of choice for resuscitation. Albumin can be used if a large amount of crystalloid is required for resuscitation. Crystalloid solutions shows little difference with hydroxyethyl starch in terms of risk of death. Starches also carry an increased risk of acute kidney injury, and need for blood transfusion. Various colloid solutions (such as modified gelatin) carry no advantage over crystalloid. Albumin also appears to be of no benefit over crystalloids.

=== Blood products ===
The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommended packed red blood cells transfusion for hemoglobin levels below 70 g/L if there is no myocardial ischemia, hypoxemia, or acute bleeding. In a 2014 trial, blood transfusions to keep target hemoglobin above 70 or 90 g/L did not make any difference to survival rates; meanwhile, those with a lower threshold of transfusion received fewer transfusions in total. Erythropoietin is not recommended in the treatment of anemia with septic shock because it may precipitate blood clotting events. Fresh frozen plasma transfusion usually does not correct the underlying clotting abnormalities before a planned surgical procedure. However, platelet transfusion is suggested for platelet counts below (10 × 109/L) without any risk of bleeding, or (20 × 109/L) with a high risk of bleeding, or (50 × 109/L) with active bleeding, before planned surgery or an invasive procedure. IV immunoglobulin is not recommended because its beneficial effects are uncertain. Monoclonal and polyclonal preparations of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) do not lower the rate of death in newborns and adults with sepsis. Evidence for the use of IgM-enriched polyclonal preparations of IVIG is inconsistent. On the other hand, the use of antithrombin to treat disseminated intravascular coagulation is also not useful. Meanwhile, the blood purification technique (such as hemoperfusion, plasma filtration, and coupled plasma filtration adsorption) to remove inflammatory mediators and bacterial toxins from the blood also does not demonstrate any survival benefit for septic shock.

=== Vasopressors ===
If the person has been sufficiently fluid resuscitated but the mean arterial pressure is not greater than 65 mmHg, vasopressors are recommended. Norepinephrine (noradrenaline) is recommended as the initial choice. Delaying initiation of vasopressor therapy during septic shock is associated with increased mortality.

Norepinephrine is often used as a first-line treatment for hypotensive septic shock because evidence shows that there is a relative deficiency of vasopressin when shock continues for 24 to 48 hours. Norepinephrine raises blood pressure through a vasoconstriction effect, with little effect on stroke volume and heart rate. In some people, the required dose of vasopressor needed to increase the mean arterial pressure can become exceedingly high and it becomes toxic. To reduce the required dose of vasopressor, epinephrine may be added. Epinephrine is not often used as a first-line treatment for hypotensive shock because it reduces blood flow to the abdominal organs and increases lactate levels. Vasopressin can be used in septic shock because studies have shown that there is a relative deficiency of vasopressin when shock continues for 24 to 48 hours. However, vasopressin reduces blood flow to the heart, fingers/toes, and abdominal organs, resulting in a lack of oxygen supply to these tissues. Dopamine is typically not recommended. Although dopamine is useful for increasing the stroke volume of the heart, it causes more abnormal heart rhythms than norepinephrine and also has an immunosuppressive effect. Dopamine is not proven to have protective properties on the kidneys. Dobutamine can also be used in hypotensive septic shock to increase cardiac output and correct blood flow to the tissues. Dobutamine is not used as often as epinephrine due to its associated side effects, which include reducing blood flow to the gut. Additionally, dobutamine increases the cardiac output by abnormally increasing the heart rate.

=== Steroids ===
The use of steroids in sepsis is controversial. Studies do not give a clear picture as to whether and when glucocorticoids should be used. The 2016 Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends low dose hydrocortisone only if both intravenous fluids and vasopressors are not able to adequately treat septic shock. The 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends IV corticosteroids for adults with septic shock who have an ongoing requirement for vasopressor therapy. A 2019 Cochrane review found low-quality evidence of benefit, as did two 2019 reviews.

During critical illness, a state of adrenal insufficiency and tissue resistance to corticosteroids may occur. This has been termed critical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency. Treatment with corticosteroids might be most beneficial in those with septic shock and early severe ARDS, whereas its role in others such as those with pancreatitis or severe pneumonia is unclear. However, the exact way of determining corticosteroid insufficiency remains problematic. It should be suspected in those poorly responding to resuscitation with fluids and vasopressors. Neither ACTH stimulation testing nor random cortisol levels are recommended to confirm the diagnosis. The method of stopping glucocorticoid drugs is variable, and it is unclear whether they should be slowly decreased or simply abruptly stopped. However, the 2016 Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommended to taper steroids when vasopressors are no longer needed.

=== Anesthesia ===
A target tidal volume of 6 mL/kg of predicted body weight (PBW) and a plateau pressure less than 30 cm H2O is recommended for those who require ventilation due to sepsis-induced severe ARDS. High positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) is recommended for moderate to severe ARDS in sepsis as it opens more lung units for oxygen exchange. Predicted body weight is calculated based on sex and height, and tools for this are available. Recruitment maneuvers may be necessary for severe ARDS by briefly raising the transpulmonary pressure. It is recommended that the head of the bed be raised if possible to improve ventilation. However, β2 adrenergic receptor agonists are not recommended to treat ARDS because it may reduce survival rates and precipitate abnormal heart rhythms. A spontaneous breathing trial using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), T piece, or inspiratory pressure augmentation can help reduce the duration of ventilation. Minimizing intermittent or continuous sedation helps reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation.

General anesthesia is recommended for people with sepsis who require surgical procedures to remove the infective source. Usually, inhalational and intravenous anesthetics are used. Requirements for anesthetics may be reduced in sepsis. Inhalational anesthetics can reduce the level of proinflammatory cytokines, altering leukocyte adhesion and proliferation, inducing apoptosis (cell death) of the lymphocytes, possibly with a toxic effect on mitochondrial function. Although etomidate has a minimal effect on the cardiovascular system, it is often not recommended as a medication to help with intubation in this situation due to concerns it may lead to poor adrenal function and an increased risk of death. The small amount of evidence there is, however, has not found a change in the risk of death with etomidate.

Paralytic agents are not suggested for use in sepsis cases in the absence of ARDS, as a growing body of evidence points to reduced durations of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital stays. However, paralytic use in ARDS cases remains controversial. When appropriately used, paralytics may aid successful mechanical ventilation, however, evidence has also suggested that mechanical ventilation in severe sepsis does not improve oxygen consumption and delivery.

=== Source control ===
Source control refers to physical interventions to control a focus of infection and reduce conditions favorable to microorganism growth or host defense impairment, such as drainage of pus from an abscess. It is one of the oldest procedures for the control of infections, giving rise to the Latin phrase &quot;Ubi pus, ibi evacua&quot;, and remains important despite the emergence of more modern treatments.

=== Early goal directed therapy ===
Early goal directed therapy (EGDT) is an approach to the management of severe sepsis during the initial 6 hours after diagnosis. It is a step-wise approach, with the physiologic goal of optimizing cardiac preload, afterload, and contractility. It includes giving early antibiotics. EGDT also involves monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and specific interventions to achieve key resuscitation targets which include maintaining a central venous pressure between 8–12 mmHg, a mean arterial pressure of between 65 and 90 mmHg, a central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) greater than 70% and a urine output of greater than 0.5 mL/kg/hour. The goal is to optimize oxygen delivery to tissues and achieve a balance between systemic oxygen delivery and demand. An appropriate decrease in serum lactate may be equivalent to ScvO2 and easier to obtain.

In the original trial, early goal-directed therapy was found to reduce mortality from 46.5% to 30.5% in those with sepsis, and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign has been recommending its use. However, three more recent large randomized control trials (ProCESS, ARISE, and ProMISe), did not demonstrate a 90-day mortality benefit of early goal-directed therapy when compared to standard therapy in severe sepsis. It is likely that some parts of EGDT are more important than others. Following these trials the use of EGDT is still considered reasonable.

=== Newborns ===
Neonatal sepsis can be difficult to diagnose as newborns may be asymptomatic. If a newborn shows signs and symptoms suggestive of sepsis, antibiotics are immediately started and are either changed to target a specific organism identified by diagnostic testing or discontinued after an infectious cause for the symptoms has been ruled out. Despite early intervention, death occurs in 13% of children who develop septic shock, with the risk partly based on other health problems. For those without multiple organ system failures or who require only one inotropic agent, mortality is low.

=== Other ===
Treating fever in sepsis, including people in septic shock, has not been associated with any improvement in mortality over a period of 28 days. Treatment of fever still occurs for other reasons.

A 2012 Cochrane review concluded that N-acetylcysteine does not reduce mortality in those with SIRS or sepsis and may even be harmful.

Recombinant activated protein C (drotrecogin alpha) was originally introduced for severe sepsis (as identified by a high APACHE II score), where it was thought to confer a survival benefit. However, subsequent studies showed that it increased adverse events—bleeding risk in particular—and did not decrease mortality. It was removed from sale in 2011. Another medication known as eritoran also has not shown benefit.

In those with high blood sugar levels, insulin to bring it down to 7.8–10 mmol/L (140–180 mg/dL) is recommended with lower levels potentially worsening outcomes. Glucose levels taken from capillary blood should be interpreted with care because such measurements may not be accurate. If a person has an arterial catheter, arterial blood is recommended for blood glucose testing.

Intermittent or continuous renal replacement therapy may be used if indicated. However, sodium bicarbonate is not recommended for a person with lactic acidosis secondary to hypoperfusion. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), unfractionated heparin (UFH), and mechanical prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression devices are recommended for any person with sepsis at moderate to high risk of venous thromboembolism. Stress ulcer prevention with proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) and H2 antagonist are useful in a person with risk factors of developing upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) such as on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours, coagulation disorders, liver disease, and renal replacement therapy. Achieving partial or full enteral feeding (delivery of nutrients through a feeding tube) is chosen as the best approach to provide nutrition for a person who is contraindicated for oral intake or unable to tolerate orally in the first seven days of sepsis when compared to intravenous nutrition. However, omega-3 fatty acids are not recommended as immune supplements for a person with sepsis or septic shock. The usage of prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide, domperidone, and erythromycin are recommended for those who are septic and unable to tolerate enteral feeding. However, these agents may precipitate prolongation of the QT interval and consequently provoke a ventricular arrhythmia such as torsades de pointes. The usage of prokinetic agents should be reassessed daily and stopped if no longer indicated.

People in sepsis may have micronutrient deficiencies, including low levels of vitamin C. Reviews mention that an intake of 3.0 g/day, which requires intravenous administration, may be needed to maintain normal plasma concentrations in people with sepsis or severe burn injury.

== Prognosis ==
Sepsis will prove fatal in approximately 24.4% of people, and septic shock will prove fatal in 34.7% of people within 30 days (32.2% and 38.5% after 90 days).
Lactate is a useful method of determining prognosis, with those who have a level greater than 4 mmol/L having a mortality of 40% and those with a level of less than 2 mmol/L having a mortality of less than 15%.

There are a number of prognostic stratification systems, such as APACHE II and Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis. APACHE II factors in the person&#x27;s age, underlying condition, and various physiologic variables to yield estimates of the risk of dying of severe sepsis. Of the individual covariates, the severity of the underlying disease most strongly influences the risk of death. Septic shock is also a strong predictor of short- and long-term mortality. Case-fatality rates are similar for culture-positive and culture-negative severe sepsis. The Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis (MEDS) score is simpler and useful in the emergency department environment.

Some people may experience severe long-term cognitive decline following an episode of severe sepsis, but the absence of baseline neuropsychological data in most people with sepsis makes the incidence of this difficult to quantify or study.

== Epidemiology ==
Sepsis causes millions of deaths globally each year and is the most common cause of death in people who have been hospitalized. The number of new cases worldwide of sepsis is estimated to be 18 million cases per year. In the United States sepsis affects approximately 3 in 1,000 people, and severe sepsis contributes to more than 200,000 deaths per year.

Sepsis occurs in 1–2% of all hospitalizations and accounts for as much as 25% of ICU bed utilization. Due to it rarely being reported as a primary diagnosis (often being a complication of cancer or other illness), the incidence, mortality, and morbidity rates of sepsis are likely underestimated. A study of U.S. states found approximately 651 hospital stays per 100,000 population with a sepsis diagnosis in 2010. It is the second-leading cause of death in non-coronary intensive care unit (ICU) and the tenth-most-common cause of death overall (the first being heart disease). Children under 12 months of age and elderly people have the highest incidence of severe sepsis. Among people from the U.S. who had multiple sepsis hospital admissions in 2010, those who were discharged to a skilled nursing facility or long-term care following the initial hospitalization were more likely to be readmitted than those discharged to another form of care. A study of 18 U.S. states found that amongst people with Medicare in 2011, sepsis was the second most common principal reason for readmission within 30 days.

Several medical conditions increase a person&#x27;s susceptibility to infection and developing sepsis. Common sepsis risk factors include age (especially the very young and old); conditions that weaken the immune system such as cancer, diabetes, or the absence of a spleen; and major trauma and burns.

From 1979 to 2000, data from the United States National Hospital Discharge Survey showed that the incidence of sepsis increased fourfold, to 240 cases per 100,000 population, with a higher incidence in men when compared to women. However, the global prevalence of sepsis has been estimated to be higher in women. During the same time frame, the in-hospital case fatality rate was reduced from 28% to 18%. However, according to the nationwide inpatient sample from the United States, the incidence of severe sepsis increased from 200 per 10,000 population in 2003 to 300 cases in 2007 for a population aged more than 18 years. The incidence rate is particularly high among infants, with an incidence of 500 cases per 100,000 population. Mortality related to sepsis increases with age, from less than 10% in the age group of 3 to 5 years to 60% by sixth decade of life. The increase in the average age of the population, alongside the presence of more people with chronic diseases or on immunosuppressive medications, and also the increase in the number of invasive procedures being performed, has led to an increased rate of sepsis.

== History ==
The term &quot;σήψις&quot; (sepsis) was introduced by Hippocrates in the fourth century BC, and it meant the process of decay or decomposition of organic matter. In the eleventh century, Avicenna used the term &quot;blood rot&quot; for diseases linked to severe purulent process. Though severe systemic toxicity had already been observed, it was only in the 19th century that the specific term – sepsis – was used for this condition.

The terms &quot;septicemia&quot;, also spelled &quot;septicaemia&quot;, and &quot;blood poisoning&quot; referred to the microorganisms or their toxins in the blood. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) version 9, which was in use in the US until 2013, used the term septicemia with numerous modifiers for different diagnoses, such as &quot;Streptococcal septicemia&quot;. All those diagnoses have been converted to sepsis, again with modifiers, in ICD-10, such as &quot;Sepsis due to streptococcus&quot;.

The current terms are dependent on the microorganism that is present: bacteremia if bacteria are present in the blood at abnormal levels and are the causative issue, viremia for viruses, and fungemia for a fungus.

By the end of the 19th century, it was widely believed that microbes produced substances that could injure the mammalian host and that soluble toxins released during infection caused the fever and shock that were commonplace during severe infections. Pfeiffer coined the term endotoxin at the beginning of the 20th century to denote the pyrogenic principle associated with &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;. It was soon realized that endotoxins were expressed by most and perhaps all gram-negative bacteria. The lipopolysaccharide character of enteric endotoxins was elucidated in 1944 by Shear. The molecular character of this material was determined by Luderitz et al. in 1973.

It was discovered in 1965 that a strain of C3H/HeJ mouse was immune to the endotoxin-induced shock. The genetic locus for this effect was dubbed &quot;Lps&quot;. These mice were also found to be hyper-susceptible to infection by gram-negative bacteria. These observations were finally linked in 1998 by the discovery of the toll-like receptor gene 4 (TLR 4). Genetic mapping work, performed over five years, showed that TLR4 was the sole candidate locus within the Lps critical region; this strongly implied that a mutation within TLR4 must account for the lipopolysaccharide resistance phenotype. The defect in the TLR4 gene that led to the endotoxin-resistant phenotype was discovered to be due to a mutation in the cytoplasm.

Controversy occurred in the scientific community over the use of mouse models in research into sepsis in 2013 when scientists published a review of the mouse immune system compared to the human immune system and showed that on a systems level, the two worked very differently; the authors noted that as of the date of their article over 150 clinical trials of sepsis had been conducted in humans, almost all of them supported by promising data in mice and that all of them had failed. The authors called for abandoning the use of mouse models in sepsis research; others rejected that but called for more caution in interpreting the results of mouse studies, and more careful design of preclinical studies. One approach is to rely more on studying biopsies and clinical data from people who have had sepsis, to try to identify biomarkers and drug targets for intervention.

== Society and culture ==

=== Economics ===
Sepsis was the most expensive condition treated in United States&#x27; hospital stays in 2013, at an aggregate cost of $23.6 billion for nearly 1.3 million hospitalizations. Costs for sepsis hospital stays more than quadrupled since 1997 with an 11.5 percent annual increase. By payer, it was the most costly condition billed to Medicare and the uninsured, the second-most costly billed to Medicaid, and the fourth-most costly billed to private insurance.

=== Education ===
A large international collaboration entitled the &quot;Surviving Sepsis Campaign&quot; was established in 2002 to educate people about sepsis and to improve outcomes with sepsis. The Campaign has published an evidence-based review of management strategies for severe sepsis, with the aim to publish a complete set of guidelines in subsequent years. The guidelines were updated in 2016 and again in 2021.

=== Awareness ===
Sepsis Alliance is a charitable organization based in the United States that was created to raise sepsis awareness among both the general public and healthcare professionals. In 2011, September was declared Sepsis Awareness Month. One year later, the Global Sepsis Alliance declared September 13 World Sepsis Day.

==Research==

Some authors suggest that initiating sepsis by the normally mutualistic (or neutral) members of the microbiome may not always be an accidental side effect of the deteriorating host immune system. Rather it is often an adaptive microbial response to a sudden decline of host survival chances. Under this scenario, the microbe species provoking sepsis benefit from monopolizing the future cadaver, utilizing its biomass as decomposers, and then transmitting through soil or water to establish mutualistic relations with new individuals. The bacteria &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Proteus&quot; spp., &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;Klebsiella&quot; spp., &quot;Clostridium&quot; spp., &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; spp., &quot;Bacteroides&quot; spp. and the fungi &quot;Candida&quot; spp. are all capable of such a high level of phenotypic plasticity. Not all cases of sepsis arise through such adaptive microbial strategy switches.

Paul E. Marik&#x27;s &quot;Marik protocol&quot;, also known as the &quot;HAT&quot; protocol, proposed a combination of hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine as a treatment for preventing sepsis for people in intensive care. Marik&#x27;s initial research, published in 2017, showed dramatic evidence of benefit, leading to the protocol becoming popular among intensive care physicians, especially after the protocol received attention on social media and National Public Radio, leading to criticism of science by press conference from the wider medical community. Subsequent independent research failed to replicate Marik&#x27;s positive results, indicating the possibility that they had been compromised by bias. A systematic review of trials in 2021 found that the claimed benefits of the protocol could not be confirmed.

Overall, the evidence for any role of vitamin C in the treatment of sepsis remains unclear .

<text>Johann Albert Fabricius (11 November 1668 – 30 April 1736) was a German classical scholar and bibliographer.

==Biography==
Fabricius was born at Leipzig, son of Werner Fabricius, director of music in the church of St. Paul at Leipzig, who was the author of several works, the most important being &quot;Deliciae Harmonicae&quot; (1656). The son received his early education from his father, who on his deathbed recommended him to the care of the theologian Valentin Alberti.

He studied under J. G. Herrichen, and afterwards at Quedlinburg under Samuel Schmid. It was in Schmid’s library, as he afterwards said, that he found the two books, Kaspar von Barth&#x27;s compendium &quot;Adversariorum libri LX&quot; (1624) and Daniel Georg Morhof&#x27;s &quot;Polyhistor&quot; (1688), which suggested to him the idea of his &quot;Bibliothecæ&quot;, the kind of works on which his great reputation was ultimately founded.

On returning to Leipzig in 1686, he published anonymously two years later his first work, &quot;Scriptorum recentiorum decas&quot;, an attack on ten writers of the day. His &quot;Decas Decadum, sive plagiariorum et pseudonymorum centuria&quot; (1689) is the only one of his works to which he signs the name Faber. Fabricius then applied himself to the study of medicine, which, however, he relinquished for that of theology; and having gone to Hamburg in 1693, he proposed to travel abroad, when the unexpected tidings that the expense of his education had absorbed his whole patrimony, and even left him in debt to his trustee, forced him to abandon this project. In 1693 he published a doctoral dissertation &quot;De Platonismo Philonis Judaei&quot; which contributed to Philo of Alexandria&#x27;s losing his position as an &quot;honorary Church Father&quot;.

He therefore remained at Hamburg in the capacity of librarian to Johann Friedrich Mayer (1650–1712). In 1696 he accompanied his patron to Sweden; and on his return to Hamburg, not long afterwards, he became a candidate for the chair of logic and philosophy. The suffrages being equally divided between Fabricius and Sebastian Edzardus, one of his opponents, the appointment was decided by lot in favour of Edzardus; but in 1699 Fabricius succeeded Vincent Placcius in the chair of rhetoric and ethics, a post which he held until his death, refusing invitations to Greifswald, Kiel, Giessen, and Wittenberg. He died in Hamburg.

The details of the life of Fabricius are to be found in &quot;De Vita et Scriptis J. A. Fabricii Commentarius&quot;, by his son-in-law, H. S. Reimarus, the editor of Dio Cassius, published at Hamburg in 1737.

Commenting on Psalm 123.2 of Origen&#x27;s scholium, Fabricius writes; &quot;ad locum 1 Joh v. 7 alludi ab origene non est dubitandum&quot;.

==Works==
Fabricius is credited with 128 books. He was a celebrated bibliographer and collector of manuscripts, and many of his volumes are compilations, editions, or anthologies.

===Bibliotheca Latina===
One of the most famed and laborious of his works is the &quot;Bibliotheca Latina&quot;. The divisions of the compilation are:
*writers to the age of Tiberius
*to those of the Antonines and
*to the decay of the language;
*fragments from old authors; and 
*chapters on early Christian literature. 
A supplementary volume is &quot;Bibliotheca Latina mediae et infimae Aetatis&quot;.

===Bibliotheca Graeca===
Fabricius&#x27; most important work is the &quot;Bibliotheca Graeca&quot; (1705–1728, revised and continued by G. C. Harless, 1790–1812), a work which has been denominated &quot;maximus antiquae eruditionis thesaurus&quot; (the greatest repository of ancient learning). Its divisions are marked off by Homer, Plato, Jesus, Constantine, and the capture of Constantinople in 1453, while a sixth section is devoted to canon law, jurisprudence and medicine.

===Other works===
*&quot;Specimen elencticum historiae logicae&quot;, a catalogue of the treatises on logic known by him (1699)
*&quot;Bibliotheca Antiquaria&quot;, an account of the writers whose works illustrated Jewish, Greek, Roman, and Christian antiquities (1713)
*&quot;Centifolium Lutheranum&quot;, a Lutheran bibliography (1728)
*&quot;Bibliotheca Ecclesiastica&quot; (1718)
* Preface to Vincent Placcius&#x27;s &quot;Theatrum anonymorum et pseudonymorum&quot; (1708)
*&quot;Memoriae Hamburgenses&quot; (1710-1730), 7 volumes

Fabricius was also influential in articulating current scholarly notions of the &quot;Old Testament Pseudepigrapha&quot; and &quot;New Testament Apocrypha&quot;, through his compilations of collections of texts and excerpts:
*&quot;Codex apocryphus Novi Testamenti&quot; (1703)
*&quot;Codex pseudepigraphus Veteris Testamenti&quot; (1713)
*&quot;Codicis pseudepigraphi Veteris Testamenti Volumen alterum accedit Josephi veteris Christiani auctoria Hypomnesticon&quot; (1723)
These volumes were widely cited and consulted as recently as the 20th century.

<doc id="158402" wikidata="Q1313081" url="?curid=158402" title="Iron deficiency">
<text>Iron deficiency, or sideropenia, is the state in which a body lacks enough iron to supply its needs. Iron is present in all cells in the human body and has several vital functions, such as carrying oxygen to the tissues from the lungs as a key component of the hemoglobin protein, acting as a transport medium for electrons within the cells in the form of cytochromes, and facilitating oxygen enzyme reactions in various tissues. Too little iron can interfere with these vital functions and lead to morbidity and death.

Total body iron averages approximately 3.8 g in men and 2.3 g in women. In blood plasma, iron is carried tightly bound to the protein transferrin. Several mechanisms control iron metabolism and safeguard against iron deficiency. The main regulatory mechanism is situated in the gastrointestinal tract. Most iron absorption occurs in the duodenum, the first section of the small intestine. Several dietary factors may affect iron absorption. Iron deficiency develops when iron loss is not sufficiently compensated by the intake of iron from the diet. When this state is uncorrected, it leads to iron-deficiency anemia, a common type of anemia. Before anemia occurs, the medical condition of iron deficiency without anemia is called latent iron deficiency (LID).

Anemia is a condition characterized by inadequate red blood cells (erythrocytes) or hemoglobin. When the body lacks sufficient amounts of iron, the production of the protein hemoglobin is reduced. Hemoglobin binds to oxygen, enabling red blood cells to supply oxygenated blood throughout the body. Women of childbearing age, children, and people with poor diet are most susceptible to the disease. A primary cause of iron deficiency in non-pregnant women is menstrual bleeding, which accounts for their comparatively higher risk than men. Most cases of iron deficiency anemia are mild, alongside physical symptoms such as dizziness and shortness of breath, women with iron deficiency may also experience anxiety, depression, and restless leg syndrome. If not treated can cause problems like an irregular heartbeat, pregnancy complications, and delayed growth in infants and children that could affect their cognitive development and their behavior.

==Signs and symptoms==

 Symptoms of iron deficiency can occur even before the condition has progressed to iron deficiency anemia.

Symptoms of iron deficiency are not unique to iron deficiency (i.e. not pathognomonic). Iron is needed for many enzymes to function normally, so a wide range of symptoms may eventually emerge, either as the secondary result of the anemia or as other primary results of iron deficiency. Common symptoms of iron deficiency include:
* fatigue
* dizziness/lightheadedness
* pallor
* headache
* shortness of breath
Less common symptoms of iron deficiency include:
* hair loss
* twitches
* irritability
* weakness
* pica
* brittle or grooved nails
* hair thinning
* Plummer–Vinson syndrome: painful atrophy of the mucous membrane covering the tongue, the pharynx and the esophagus
* impaired immune function
* pagophagia
* desiderosmia
* restless legs syndrome 
* in chronic cases, increase in blood pressure

Continued iron deficiency may progress to anemia and progressive fatigue. Iron deficiency can also cause an elevated platelet count (thrombocytosis). Low iron levels in the blood may make some people ineligible to donate blood.

===Signs and symptoms in children===
Iron deficiency in children can progress slowly and the signs and symptoms may not be obvious. The most common symptom in children is appearing tired and pale.
* pale skin
* fatigue
* slowed growth and development
* poor appetite
* decrease in the size of testes
* behavioral problems
* abnormal rapid breathing
* frequent infection

=== Iron requirements in young children to teenagers ===
==Causes==
Iron deficiency can be caused by many factors and health conditions and in many cases it can be treated with iron supplements. In women, blood loss from heavy periods is a common cause of iron deficiency. Pregnant women are at risk of iron deficiency. Internal bleeding such as from an ulcer in the stomach or intestines is another common cause. Blood loss from donating blood can contribute to iron deficiency. There are also other factors that put people at risk including:
* blood loss (hemoglobin contains iron)
** donation
** excessive menstrual bleeding
** non-menstrual bleeding
** bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract (anus) (ulcers, hemorrhoids, ulcerative colitis, stomach or colon cancer, etc.)
** rarely, laryngological bleeding or from the respiratory tract
** cancer
* Diet: inadequate iron intake 
* substances (in diet or drugs) interfering with iron absorption
** Fluoroquinolone antibiotics
* malabsorption syndromes
* inflammation where it is adaptive to limit bacterial growth in infection, but is also present in many other chronic diseases such as Inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis
* parasitic infection
Though genetic defects causing iron deficiency have been studied in rodents, there are no known genetic disorders of human iron metabolism that directly cause iron deficiency.

===Athletics===
Possible reasons that athletics may contribute to lower iron levels include mechanical hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells from physical impact), loss of iron through sweat and urine, gastrointestinal blood loss, and haematuria (presence of blood in urine). Although small amounts of iron are excreted in sweat and urine, these losses can generally be seen as insignificant even with increased sweat and urine production, especially considering that athletes&#x27; bodies appear to become conditioned to retain iron better. Mechanical hemolysis is most likely to occur in high-impact sports, especially among long-distance runners who experience &quot;foot-strike hemolysis&quot; from the repeated impact of their feet with the ground. Exercise-induced gastrointestinal bleeding is most likely to occur in endurance athletes. Haematuria in athletes is most likely to occur in those that undergo repetitive impacts on the body, particularly affecting the feet (such as running on a hard road, or Kendo) and hands (e.g. Conga or Candombe drumming). Additionally, athletes in sports that emphasize weight loss (e.g. ballet, gymnastics, marathon running, and cycling) as well as sports that emphasize high-carbohydrate, low-fat diets, may be at an increased risk for iron deficiency.

===Inadequate dietary intake===
A U.S. federal food consumption survey determined that for women and men over 19, average iron consumption from foods and beverages was 13.1 and 18.0 mg/day, respectively. For women, 16% in the age range 14–50 years consumed less than the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR), and for men ages 19 and up, fewer than 3%. Consumption data were updated in a 2014 U.S. government survey and reported that for men and women ages 20 and older the average iron intakes were, respectively, 16.6 and 12.6 mg/day. People in the U.S. usually obtain adequate amounts of iron from their diets. However, subgroups like infants, young children, teenaged girls, pregnant women, and premenopausal women are at risk of obtaining less than the EAR. Socio-economic and racial differences further affect the rates of iron deficiency.

==Bioavailability==
Iron is needed for bacterial growth making its bioavailability an important factor in controlling infection. Blood plasma as a result carries iron tightly bound to transferrin, which is taken up by cells by endocytosing transferrin, thus preventing its access to bacteria. Between 15 and 20 percent of the protein content in human milk consists of lactoferrin that binds iron. As a comparison, in cow&#x27;s milk, this is only 2 percent. As a result, breast-fed babies have fewer infections. Lactoferrin is also concentrated in tears, saliva, and wounds to bind iron to limit bacterial growth. Egg white contains 12% conalbumin to withhold it from bacteria that get through the eggshell (for this reason, before antibiotics, egg white was used to treat infections).

To reduce bacterial growth, plasma concentrations of iron are lowered in a variety of systemic inflammatory states due to increased production of hepcidin which is mainly released by the liver in response to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6. This functional iron deficiency will resolve once the source of inflammation is rectified; however, if not resolved, it can progress to anemia of chronic inflammation. The underlying inflammation can be caused by fever, inflammatory bowel disease, infections, chronic heart failure (CHF), carcinomas, or following surgery.

Reflecting this link between iron bioavailability and bacterial growth, taking oral iron supplements over 200 mg/day causes a relative overabundance of iron that can alter the types of bacteria present within the gut. There have been concerns regarding parenteral iron being administered whilst bacteremia is present, although this has not been borne out in clinical practice. A moderate iron deficiency, in contrast, can protect against acute infection, especially against organisms that reside within hepatocytes and macrophages, such as malaria and tuberculosis. This is mainly beneficial in regions with a high prevalence of these diseases and where standard treatment is unavailable.

==Diagnosis==
* A complete blood count can reveal microcytic anemia, although this is not always presenteven when iron deficiency progresses to iron-deficiency anemia.
* Low serum ferritin (&quot;see below&quot;)
* Low serum iron
* High TIBC (total iron binding capacity), although this can be elevated in cases of anemia of chronic inflammation.
* It is possible that the fecal occult blood test might be positive if iron deficiency is the result of gastrointestinal bleeding; although the sensitivity of the test may mean that in some cases it will be negative even with enteral blood loss.

As always, laboratory values must be interpreted with the lab&#x27;s reference values in mind and considering all aspects of the individual clinical situation.

Serum ferritin can be elevated in inflammatory conditions; so a normal serum ferritin may not always exclude iron deficiency, and the utility is improved by taking a concurrent C-reactive protein (CRP). The serum ferritin level viewed as &quot;high&quot; depends on the condition. For example, in inflammatory bowel disease the threshold is 100, whereas in chronic heart failure (CHF) the levels are 200.

==Treatment==
Before commencing treatment, there should be a definitive diagnosis of the underlying cause of iron deficiency. This is particularly the case in older patients, who are most susceptible to colorectal cancer and the gastrointestinal bleeding it often causes. In adults, 60% of patients with iron-deficiency anemia may have underlying gastrointestinal disorders leading to chronic blood loss.
It is likely that the cause of the iron deficiency will need treatment as well.

Upon diagnosis, the condition can be treated with iron supplements. The choice of the supplement will depend upon both the severity of the condition, the required speed of improvement (e.g. if awaiting elective surgery), and the likelihood of treatment being effective (e.g. if the patient has underlying IBD, is undergoing dialysis, or is having ESA therapy).

Examples of oral iron that are often used are ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, or amino acid chelate tablets. Recent research suggests the replacement dose of iron, at least in the elderly with iron deficiency, may be as little as 15 mg per day of elemental iron.

Low-certainty evidence suggests that IBD-related anemia treatment with Intravenous (IV) iron infusion may be more effective than oral iron therapy, with fewer people needing to stop treatment early due to adverse effects. The type of iron preparation may be an important determinant of clinical benefit. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests response to treatment may be higher when IV ferric carboxymaltose, rather than IV iron sucrose preparation is used, despite very-low certainty evidence of increased adverse effects, including bleeding, in those receiving ferric carboxymaltose treatment.

Ferric maltol, marketed as &quot;Accrufer&quot; and &quot;Ferracru,&quot; is available in oral and IV preparations. When used as a treatment for IBD-related anemia, very low certainty evidence suggests a marked benefit with oral ferric maltol compared with placebo. However, it was unclear whether the IV preparation was more effective than oral ferric maltol.

A Cochrane review of controlled trials comparing intravenous (IV) iron therapy with oral iron supplements in people with chronic kidney disease, found low-certainty evidence that people receiving IV-iron treatment were 1.71 times as likely to reach their target hemoglobin levels. Overall, hemoglobin was 0.71g/dl higher than those treated with oral iron supplements. Iron stores in the liver, estimated by serum ferritin, were also 224.84 μg/L higher in those receiving IV-iron. However there was also low-certainty evidence that allergic reactions were more likely following IV-iron therapy. It was unclear whether the type of iron therapy administration affects the risk of death from any cause, including cardiovascular, nor whether it may alter the number of people who may require a blood transfusion or dialysis.

===Food sources===
Mild iron deficiency can be prevented or corrected by eating iron-rich foods and cooking in an iron skillet. Because iron is a requirement for most plants and animals, a wide range of foods provide iron. Good sources of dietary iron have heme iron, as this is most easily absorbed and is not inhibited by medication or other dietary components. Two examples are red meat and poultry. Non-heme sources contain iron, though the iron is less bioavailable. Examples are lentils, beans, leafy vegetables, pistachios, tofu, fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals.

Iron from different foods is absorbed and processed differently by the body; for instance, iron in meat (heme iron source) is more easily absorbed than iron in grains and vegetables (&quot;non-heme&quot; iron sources). Minerals and chemicals in one type of food may also inhibit absorption of iron from another type of food eaten at the same time. For example, oxalates and phytic acid form insoluble complexes which bind iron in the gut before it can be absorbed.

Because iron from plant sources is less easily absorbed than the heme-bound iron of animal sources, vegetarians and vegans should have a somewhat higher total daily iron intake than those who eat meat, fish, or poultry. Legumes and dark-green leafy vegetables like broccoli, kale and Asian greens are especially good sources of iron for vegetarians and vegans. However, spinach and Swiss chard contain oxalates that bind iron, making them almost entirely unavailable for absorption. Iron from non-heme sources is more readily absorbed if consumed with foods that contain either heme-bound iron or vitamin C. This is due to a hypothesized &quot;meat factor&quot; which enhances iron absorption. The benefits of eating seasonings or condiments that have been fortified with iron for people with iron deficiencies are not clear. There is some evidence that iron-fortified condiments or seasonings may help reduce an iron deficiency, however, whether this improves a person&#x27;s health and prevents the person from developing anemia is not clear.

Following are two tables showing the richest foods in heme and non-heme iron. The &quot;% RDA&quot; column is based on the USDA Recommended Dietary Allowance of 18 mg for women aged between 19 and 50, and 8 mg for men aged 19 and older as well as women aged 51 and older.

====Food recommendations for children====
Children at 6 months should start having solid food that contains enough iron, which could be found in both heme and non-heme iron.

Heme iron:
* Red meat (for example, beef, pork, lamb, goat, or venison)
* Fatty fish
* Poultry (for example, chicken or turkey)
* Eggs

Non-heme iron:
* Iron-fortified infant cereals
* Tofu
* Beans and lentils
* Dark green leafy vegetables

Iron deficiency can have serious health consequences that diet may not be able to quickly correct; hence, an iron supplement is often necessary if the iron deficiency has become symptomatic.

===Blood transfusion===
Blood transfusion is sometimes used to treat iron deficiency with hemodynamic instability. Sometimes transfusions are considered for people who have chronic iron deficiency or who will soon go to surgery, but even if such people have low hemoglobin, they should be given oral treatment or intravenous iron.

;Intravenous iron therapy for non-anemic, iron-deficient adults
Current evidence is limited to base any recommendations that intravenous iron therapy is beneficial for treating non-anemic, iron-deficient adults. Further research in this area is needed as current body of evidence is very low quality.

==Cancer research==

The presence of &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; in the stomach can cause inflammation and can lower the threshold for the development of gastric cancer. In the setting of iron deficiency, &quot;H. pylori&quot; causes more severe inflammation and the development of premalignant lesions. This inflammatory effect appears to be mediated, in part, through altered bile acid production including an increase in deoxycholic acid, a secondary bile acid implicated in colon cancer and other gastrointestinal cancers.

<text>Edna María Nazario Figueroa (born April 11, 1955) is a Puerto Rican pop singer who has achieved stardom both at home and abroad. She has been in the music business from a young age and has released twenty-three studio albums, five live albums and two extended plays (EPs) throughout her career.

==Biography==

===Childhood sensation===
Nazario was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, to Domingo Nazario and Gudelia Figueroa. She has two older brothers (Tito and Alberto) and a younger brother (Frank, a.k.a. Pancho). Ednita showed inclinations to music even when small. A family anecdote tells that when she was 2 and shopping with her mother, she wandered away, and her mother found her singing on top of boxes to an enthusiastic crowd of laughing, clapping shoppers.

When she was six, she attended a baseball game in Ponce with her brothers. While she was playing with her brother&#x27;s glove, the batter hit the ball toward her. She held the glove up for protection, and the ball landed squarely in it. The crowd went wild, including Alfred D. Herger, one of Puerto Rico&#x27;s top record producers, who was seated near the family. When he asked her if she wanted to be a baseball player, she replied &quot;No, I&#x27;m going to be a singer.&quot; He asked her to sing something for him, and she responded with an impressive rendition of a local salsa hit that left both the producer and the applauding crowd astonished. Two months later, Herger visited the Nazario household with a recording contract. After initial reluctance, the family signed the contract.

At 6, Ednita recorded her first song: &quot;Mi Amor Lolipop,&quot; a Spanish version of &quot;My Boy Lollipop&quot;. In 1966, at age 11, Nazario made her radio debut.

===Teen success===
After some presentations, Nazario started alongside singer and photographer &quot;José Manuel&quot;, and Frankie Sabath, in a band which Tony Morales created, called &quot;The Kids From Ponce&quot;. The group played at several hotels and television networks, and achieved local success, appearing on various TV shows. However, the group disbanded and they became soloists. Nazario, then 17, was offered her own prime-time TV variety show: &quot;El Show de Ednita&quot;, broadcast by Telemundo Puerto Rico, and produced by Paquito Cordero. During this time she also won the &quot;Miss Puerto Rico Teenage pageant&quot;.

At age 18 in 1973, Nazario released her first album called &quot;Al Fin...Ednita&quot;. The album spawned a number 1 Hit: &quot;Te Quiero y No Me Importa&quot; (I Love You And I Don&#x27;t Care), and also brought her award as &quot;New Artist of the Year&quot;. With her TV show, Nazario became Puerto Rico&#x27;s hottest idol. The show was also syndicated to other Latin-American countries. Among the international stars that she hosted were: Liza Minnelli, Bob Eberly, Charles Aznavour, Morey Amsterdam and Oscar-winning Puerto Rican actor José Ferrer. Ferrer was so charmed by Nazario&#x27;s presence that he designed a nightclub act for both of them.

Ferrer was surprised at the reception of Nazario&#x27;s show. They were booked at several hotels in the Caribbean, Lake Tahoe, Las Vegas and New York. They appeared at the Hyatt Hotel in Canada, and she was invited by Monaco&#x27;s Royal Family to perform at the famous casino of Monte Carlo three times.

===Rising star===
In the late 1970s Nazario participated in the eight edition of the &quot;OTI Festival&quot; as a singer with the song &quot;Cadenas de Fuego&quot; (Fire chains) getting a more than respectable fifth place with 21 points, and in 1980 as a songwriter with the song: &quot;Contigo, Mujer&quot; (With you, Woman), co-written by her husband at the time, Laureano Brizuela, an Argentine singer and songwriter. The latter song, performed by Rafael José, won top prize of the festival scoring 36 points. She also gained notoriety for her performance in a duet with Brizuela, of the theme song of the successful Puerto Rican telenovela, &quot;Coralito:Mi Pequeño Amor&quot; (Coralito:My Little Love), which Brizuela had written. During the late 1970&#x27;s, Nazario participated in a musical collaboration with boy band Menudo, in which she and the group sang a cover of ABBA&#x27;s song &quot;Chiquitita&quot;, with Nazario playing the titular &quot;Chiquitita&quot; in a music video she and the band recorded.

During this time Nazario signed subsequent record deals, first with local label &quot;Borinquen&quot;, then &quot;Ariola&quot;, and finally &quot;Padosa&quot;. During this time, she matured her style to one that was more pop/rock oriented. She also cemented her place as a touring force in Latin-America.

===In the 1990s===
In 1989 Nazario released &quot;Fuerza De Gravedad&quot; (Force of Gravity). Perhaps helped by her recent marriage and motherhood, the album showed more focused lyrics and a more mature singer. The album included a duet with Air Supply singer Russell Hitchcock. Her following album &quot;Lo Que Son Las Cosas&quot; (What A Way For Things To Be) in 1991 included a Spanish version of a song made famous by Italian singer Eros Ramazzotti. The album also contained other compositions from her Argentinian ex-husband Luis Angel.

After her breakup from her husband, Nazario refocused her career and released &quot;Metamorfosis&quot; in 1992, following it with presentations in some of the most prestigious halls of the island. In 1993 she sold out a concert at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum which was released as an album the following year. After another album, she starred an impressive run of 13 shows at the Luis A. Ferré Performing Arts Center of San Juan, following Yolandita Monge&#x27;s record of 12 consecutive shows.

In 1994 she released one of her most acclaimed albums to date: &quot;Pasiones&quot; (Passions).

In 1996 she released &quot;Espíritu Libre&quot; (Free Spirit), which went triple platinum soon after being released. On the heels of it, she sold out the Hiram Bithorn Stadium on a show that was broadcast via Internet.

In 1998 she was cast for the lead role in Paul Simon&#x27;s Broadway musical, &quot;The Capeman&quot;, sharing the stage with Rubén Blades and Marc Anthony. She won the Theatre World Award for her performance as &quot;Esmeralda Agrón&quot;. She was nominated for a 1998 Drama Desk Award as Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical.

===1999–2012===

In 1999 Nazario resurged in music, with &quot;Corazón&quot; (Sweetheart). The album, produced and directed by Dräco Rosa, went platinum in just a week. The album also got her several awards and two Billboard nominations. In 2001, after signing a new record deal with Sony Music, she released &quot;Sin Límite&quot; (Limitless), which featured fellow singer and songwriter Tommy Torres as producer.

In 2002 she fulfilled one of her dreams by transforming the Luis A. Ferré Performing Arts Center into a recording studio and inviting 300 friends to share with her two nights of an acoustic concert. The concert was released in two separate albums: &quot;Acústico I &amp; II&quot; (Unplugged Vol 1 &amp; 2). The presentation included a duo with Beto Cuevas, lead singer of the Latin-American band La Ley.

Next year, with Tommy Torres again producing, Nazario released &quot;Por Tí&quot; (Because of You). The album featured collaborations with Ricky Martin and Luis Fonsi. The supporting concert broke all attendance records in Puerto Rico. She followed with &quot;Apasionada&quot; (Passionate), also produced by Torres. This included collaborations with composer Claudia Brandt, Sin Bandera&#x27;s &quot;Noel Schajris&quot;, and Luis Fonsi.

In December 2007 Nazario released her album &quot;Real&quot; produced by producer Armando Avila (La 5ª Estación) and Graeme Pleeth (Sonique). The album was recorded in London, Nashville, Mexico City and Miami, and debuted at number 1 in Billboard&#x27;s Top Latin Albums and Top Latin Pop Albums, selling over 18,000 copies the first week. On July 2, 2008, Nazario filmed a music video for &quot;No&quot; along Natalia Jiménez of &quot;La 5ª Estación&quot;. Nazario was one of several artists selected to perform in &quot;KQ Live Concert&quot; on September 27, 2008. Organized by KQ 105 FM, the event included several artists from Puerto Rico and other Latin American countries.

Nazario&#x27;s new album &quot;Soy&quot; (I Am) was released on October 27, 2009. Nazario has worked with Tommy Torres, Sebastian Krys and Claudia Brant. On September 2 Nazario posted a 30-second clip of the first single titled &quot;Sin Querer&quot; (Without wanting to), which received positive reviews.

&quot;Sin Querer&quot; (Without wanting to) was released on radio stations and via Nazario&#x27;s MySpace page on September 24, 2009. It was released on October 6 on iTunes. Three more singles were released from this album. &quot;Confesados&quot; (Confessed) was the second single and was released January 11, 2010. &quot;La Fuerza De Un Te Quiero&quot; (The Strength of an I Love You), the third single, was released April 5, 2010. The last single of the album, &quot;Se Que Voy A Reir&quot; (I Know I Will Laugh) was released July 19, of that same year.

On January 16, 2012, Ednita released her lead single &quot;Para El Peor Amante&quot; (For The Worst Lover), for her 22nd album was released. Her 22nd album, titled Desnuda (Naked) was released March 27 of that year. From this album, the songs &quot;Voy&quot; (Going), La Pasion Tiene Memoria&quot; (The Passion Has A Memory), and &quot;Alergica Al Amor&quot; (Alergic To Love) were released as singles following the album&#x27;s released. Ednita did a set of concerts in Coliseo Jose Miguel Agrelot where her daughter, Caro Lina, made her first musical appearance. Caro Lina debuted her single &quot;Dangerous&quot; through online digital market months later.

===2013–2017: &quot;El Corazón Decide&quot; and &quot;Una Vida&quot;===
On October 22 of 2013, Ednita released her 23rd album, titled &quot;El Corazón Decide&quot; (The Heart Decides). The album was recorded in Miami and London; and contains songs from international artists like Pedro Capó, Leonel García and Kany Garcia, who composed the first single from the album &quot;La Más Fuerte&quot; (The Stronger One). The album follows the same musical and lyrical formula of her last previous recordings. Nazario released 4 more singles from El Corazon Decide. &quot;A Mi No&quot; (Not Me) was released January 10 of 2014. That same year she released the third and fourth single of the album. She released &quot;Llorar Por Ti&quot; (Cry For You) and &quot;Asi Es La Vida Sin Ti&quot; (That&#x27;s Life Without You) on April 24 and September 24 respectably. &quot;Empezar a Vivir&quot; (Starting to Live) was the fifth and last single of the album and was released on January 14, 2015.

<text>Iron(II) sulfate (British English: iron(II) sulphate) or ferrous sulfate denotes a range of salts with the formula FeSO4·&quot;x&quot;H2O. These compounds exist most commonly as the heptahydrate (&quot;x&quot; = 7) but several values for x are known. The hydrated form is used medically to treat or prevent iron deficiency, and also for industrial applications. Known since ancient times as copperas and as green vitriol (vitriol is an archaic name for hydrated sulfate minerals), the blue-green heptahydrate (hydrate with 7 molecules of water) is the most common form of this material. All the iron(II) sulfates dissolve in water to give the same aquo complex [Fe(H2O)6]2+, which has octahedral molecular geometry and is paramagnetic. The name copperas dates from times when the copper(II) sulfate was known as blue copperas, and perhaps in analogy, iron(II) and zinc sulfate were known respectively as green and white copperas.

It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 107th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6million prescriptions.

==Uses==
Industrially, ferrous sulfate is mainly used as a precursor to other iron compounds. It is a reducing agent, and as such is useful for the reduction of chromate in cement to less toxic Cr(III) compounds. Historically ferrous sulfate was used in the textile industry for centuries as a dye fixative. It is used historically to blacken leather and as a constituent of iron gall ink. The preparation of sulfuric acid (&#x27;oil of vitriol&#x27;) by the distillation of green vitriol (iron(II) sulfate) has been known for at least 700 years.

===Medical use===
===Plant growth===
Iron(II) sulfate is sold as ferrous sulfate, a soil amendment for lowering the pH of a high alkaline soil so that plants can access the soil&#x27;s nutrients.

In horticulture it is used for treating iron chlorosis. Although not as rapid-acting as ferric EDTA, its effects are longer-lasting. It can be mixed with compost and dug into the soil to create a store which can last for years. Ferrous sulfate can be used as a lawn conditioner. It can also be used to eliminate silvery thread moss in golf course putting greens.

===Pigment and craft===
Ferrous sulfate can be used to stain concrete and some limestones and sandstones a yellowish rust color.

Woodworkers use ferrous sulfate solutions to color maple wood a silvery hue.

Green vitriol is also a useful reagent in the identification of mushrooms.

===Historical uses===
Ferrous sulfate was used in the manufacture of inks, most notably iron gall ink, which was used from the Middle Ages until the end of the 18th century. Chemical tests made on the Lachish letters () showed the possible presence of iron. It is thought that oak galls and copperas may have been used in making the ink on those letters. It also finds use in wool dyeing as a mordant. Harewood, a material used in marquetry and parquetry since the 17th century, is also made using ferrous sulfate.

Two different methods for the direct application of indigo dye were developed in England in the 18th century and remained in use well into the 19th century. One of these, known as &quot;china blue&quot;, involved iron(II) sulfate. After printing an insoluble form of indigo onto the fabric, the indigo was reduced to &quot;leuco&quot;-indigo in a sequence of baths of ferrous sulfate (with reoxidation to indigo in air between immersions). The china blue process could make sharp designs, but it could not produce the dark hues of other methods.

In the second half of the 1850s ferrous sulfate was used as a photographic developer for collodion process images.

==Hydrates==
Iron(II) sulfate can be found in various states of hydration, and several of these forms exist in nature or were created synthetically.
* FeSO4·H2O (mineral: szomolnokite, relatively rare, monoclinic)
* FeSO4·H2O (synthetic compound stable at pressures exceeding 6.2 GPa, triclinic)
* FeSO4·4H2O (mineral: rozenite, white, relatively common, may be dehydration product of melanterite, monoclinic)
* FeSO4·5H2O (mineral: siderotil, relatively rare, triclinic)
* FeSO4·6H2O (mineral: ferrohexahydrite, very rare, monoclinic)
* FeSO4·7H2O (mineral: melanterite, blue-green, relatively common, monoclinic)
The tetrahydrate is stabilized when the temperature of aqueous solutions reaches . At these solutions form both the tetrahydrate and monohydrate.

Mineral forms are found in oxidation zones of iron-bearing ore beds, e.g. pyrite, marcasite, chalcopyrite, etc. They are also found in related environments, like coal fire sites. Many rapidly dehydrate and sometimes oxidize. Numerous other, more complex (either basic, hydrated, and/or containing additional cations) Fe(II)-bearing sulfates exist in such environments, with copiapite being a common example.

==Production and reactions==
In the finishing of steel prior to plating or coating, the steel sheet or rod is passed through pickling baths of sulfuric acid. This treatment produces large quantities of iron(II) sulfate as a by-product.

Another source of large amounts results from the production of titanium dioxide from ilmenite via the sulfate process.

Ferrous sulfate is also prepared commercially by oxidation of pyrite:
It can be produced by displacement of metals less reactive than Iron from solutions of their sulfate:

===Reactions===

Upon dissolving in water, ferrous sulfates form the metal aquo complex [Fe(H2O)6]2+, which is an almost colorless, paramagnetic ion.

On heating, iron(II) sulfate first loses its water of crystallization and the original green crystals are converted into a white anhydrous solid. When further heated, the anhydrous material decomposes into sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide, leaving a reddish-brown iron(III) oxide. Thermolysis of iron(II) sulfate begins at about .

Like other iron(II) salts, iron(II) sulfate is a reducing agent. For example, it reduces nitric acid to nitrogen monoxide and chlorine to chloride:
:
Its mild reducing power is of value in organic synthesis. It is used as the iron catalyst component of Fenton&#x27;s reagent.

Ferrous sulfate can be detected by the cerimetric method, which is the official method of the Indian Pharmacopoeia. This method includes the use of ferroin solution showing a red to light green colour change during titration.

<doc id="158407" wikidata="Q1097003" url="?curid=158407" title="Grand Prince of Kiev">
<text>The Grand Prince of Kiev (sometimes grand duke) was the title of the monarch of Kievan Rus&#x27;, residing in Kiev (modern Kyiv) from the 10th to 13th centuries. In the 13th century, Kiev became an appanage principality first of the grand prince of Vladimir and the Mongol Golden Horde governors, and later was taken over by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

Rus&#x27; chronicles such as the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; are inconsistent in applying the title &quot;grand prince&quot; to various princes in Kievan Rus&#x27;. Although most sources consistently attribute it to the prince of Kiev, there is no agreement which princes were also &quot;grand prince&quot;, and scholars have thus come up with different lists of grand princes of Kiev.

== Background ==
=== Origins ===

According to a founding myth in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv and their sister Lybid co-founded the city of Kiev (Kyiv), and the oldest brother Kyi was &quot;chief of his kin&quot; (). Some western historians (i.e., Kevin Alan Brook) suppose that Kiev was founded by Khazars or Magyars. Kiev is a Turkic place name (&quot;Küi&quot; = riverbank + &quot;ev&quot; = settlement). At least during the 8th and 9th centuries Kiev functioned as an outpost of the Khazar empire (a hill-fortress, called &quot;Sambat&quot;, &quot;high place&quot; in Old Turkic). According to Omeljan Pritsak, Constantine Zuckerman and other scholars, Khazars lost Kiev at the beginning of the 10th century.

At some point, Rurik, a Varangian prince, allegedly founded the &quot;Rurik dynasty&quot; (named after him in the 16th century) in 862 through the &quot;calling of the Varangians&quot;, but he is considered to be a legendary, mythical and perhaps even entirely fictional character by modern scholars. The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; never calls Rurik a prince of Kiev; the passage wherein Oleg &quot;sat in Kiev&quot; () makes no mention of Rurik, suggesting the author was &#x27;more interested in the first Rus&#x27; ruler to reside in Kiev than with any founder of a dynasty&#x27;.

Kiev was captured by Askold and Dir, whose existence is also debatable, and are called &quot;boyars&quot; who &quot;did not belong to [Rurik&#x27;s] family&quot; by the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;. According to some Russian historians (i.e., Gleb S. Lebedev), Dir was a &quot;chacanus&quot; of Rhos (Rus khagan). Thomas Noonan asserts that one of the Rus &quot;sea-kings&quot;, the &quot;High king&quot;, adopted the title khagan in the early 9th century. Peter Benjamin Golden maintained that the Rus became a part of the Khazar federation, and that their ruler was officially accepted as a vassal khagan of the Khazar Khagan of Itil.

Before the mid-15th century, no historical source claims that Rurik founded a dynasty; the Hypatian Codex of 1425 began its list of &quot;knyazi&quot; of Kiev with &quot;Dir and Askold&quot;, then &quot;Oleg&quot;, then &quot;Igor&quot;, up to 1240, and does not mention Rurik anywhere. Similarly, the &quot;Khlebnikov Codex&quot; starts with a regnal list stating: &#x27;In Kiev, the first to begin reigning together were Dinar and Askold, after them came Olga, after Olga Igor, after Igor Sviatoslav, (...)&#x27;. There is no mention of a &quot;Rurik&quot;; instead, the list starts with &quot;Dinar and Askold&quot;. Unlike &quot;Hypatian&quot;″s second place for Oleg the Wise, however, &quot;Khlebnikov&quot; appears to assert Olga of Kiev succeeded them, and preceded her own husband Igor of Kiev.

=== First princes ===
Askold and Dir are narrated to have been killed in 882 by Oleg, the first &quot;prince&quot; (&quot;knyaz&quot;) of Kiev according to the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, but not yet a &quot;grand prince&quot; (&quot;velikiy knyaz&quot;). His relation to Rurik is debatable, and has been rejected by several modern scholars. Although later Muscovite chroniclers would call Oleg a &quot;grand prince&quot; and Kiev a &quot;grand principality&quot; (), the earliest sources do not. Whereas the reconstructed original Greek text of the Rusʹ–Byzantine Treaty (907) calls Oleg a μεγας ἄρχων or &quot;great archon&quot; (&quot;ruler&quot;), the Old East Slavic translations found in the Laurentian Codex and Hypatian Codex do not. On the other hand, only when the Byzantine emperors Leo VI the Wise, Alexander and Constantine VII are called &quot;the Great&quot;, Oleg is also called &quot;the Great&quot;. Dimnik (2004) argued it should thus be read as &quot;the Rus&#x27; prince Oleg the Great&quot; instead of &quot;Oleg the grand prince of Rus&#x27;&quot;. Similarly, the only occasions Igor of Kiev is ever called &quot;velikiy knyaz&quot; in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; (six times) are all found in the Rusʹ–Byzantine Treaty (945), where the Greek emperors are also called &quot;k velikiy tsesarem Grech&#x27;-skim&quot; (&quot;to the great Greek caesars&quot;). The same happens when, after Sviatoslav&#x27;s invasion of Bulgaria, the 971 peace treaty is recorded; it is the only place in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; where Sviatoslav I is named a &quot;velikiy knyaz&quot;. Most significantly, the &quot;Nachal&#x27;nyy svod&quot; (found only in the &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot;) never mentions any of these peace treaties, and never calls Oleg, Igor or Sviatoslav a &quot;velikiy knyaz&quot;. According to Dimnik (2004), this means that Greek scribes added the word &quot;great&quot; to the princely title, whereas the Rus&#x27; themselves did not, except when translating these three treaties from Greek into Slavic.

Yaropolk I of Kiev and Volodimer I of Kiev are both steadily referred to as just a &quot;knyaz&quot; by the &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot; and the Laurentian and Hypatian Codices. There is one exception: the Hypatian Codex writes &quot;Volodimir knyaz velikii&quot; (&quot;Volodimir the grand prince&quot;) when reporting the latter&#x27;s death; because the Hypatian Codex is the latest source of the three (compiled 1425), this is probably a later interpolation. A &quot;Paterik&quot; of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra of the early 13th century also calls Volodimer a &quot;velikiy knyaz&quot;, but that was written two centuries after his death, and may not necessarily describe how he was known while alive. The oldest surviving source available is Hilarion of Kiev&#x27;s &quot;Sermon on Law and Grace&quot; ( 1040s), which calls Volodimer a &quot;kagan&quot; (a Khazar title) rather than a &quot;knyaz&quot;. Some scholars have suggested that this indicates Kievan Rus&#x27; had won its independence from the Khazars in the early 10th century, and had inherited the title of &quot;kagan&quot; from them, before exchanging it for &quot;knyaz&quot; later. The Church Statute of Prince Volodimir starts with &quot;Behold, I, Prince Vasilii, called Volodimir,&quot; (), but later in the text he interchangeably calls himself &quot;knyaz&quot; and &quot;velikiy knyaz&quot;, and the earliest copy of this document is from the 14th century, so it is difficult to say what the lost original text said. Since chroniclers also regularly referred to Volodimer as &quot;velikiy&quot; without mentioning his title – the reason why he has become known to history as Volodimer &quot;the Great&quot; – suggests that this adjective was not part of his title, but a sobriquet or nickname, that was also applied to other monarchs or clerics around him.

=== &quot;Velikiy knyaz&quot; Yaroslav and descendants ===
Sviatopolk I of Kiev was never called &quot;velikiy knyaz&quot; (&quot;grand prince&quot;) in any source. Moreover, he has been stigmatised by chroniclers with the nickname &quot;the Accursed&quot; or &quot;the Damned&quot; (&quot;okayannyy&quot;) because of how he violently rose to power in the war of succession following Volodimir&#x27;s death in 1015. On the other hand, Yaroslav the Wise is the first widely attested &quot;velikiy knyaz&quot; (&quot;grand prince&quot;) in virtually all sources of the second half of the 11th century, and surviving copies of the Church Statute of Prince Yaroslav also strongly suggest he applied the title to himself while he was alive. Dimnik (2004) concluded that by the end of Yaroslav&#x27;s reign in the third quarter of the 11th century, he was regularly calling himself and being called the &quot;velikiy knyaz&quot; of Kiev, and the competing titles of &quot;kagan&quot; and &quot;tsar&quot; had decisively lost in favour of &quot;velikiy knyaz&quot; as the preferred appellation of the Kievan monarch. The &quot;velikiy knyaz&quot; was designated by genealogical seniority and given the right to reign from Kiev – the grand principality superior to all other principalities in the realm – over all other princes descended from Yaroslav. The reason why the system of succession did not always work as Yaroslav intended was because some princes simply usurped power through a coup d&#x27;état at the court in Kiev. The 1097 Council of Liubech upgraded the dynastic capitals of the inner circle of senior princes to grand principalities as well, but still acknowledged the superiority of Kiev. 

It was not until the Sack of Kiev (1169) by Andrey Bogolyubsky of Vladimir-Suzdal that the grand princes of Vladimir launched a fierce competition with the grand princes of Kiev over who had primacy over the entire realm. Since then, the phrase &quot;&quot;velikiy knyaz&quot; of Kiev&quot; was merely titular, and chroniclers applied the symbolic title of &quot;velikiy knyaz&quot; to Kiev or Vladimir on the Klyazma according to whomever they favoured. In practice, the military supremacy of any particular prince – especially from Vsevolod the Big Nest onwards – would determine whether the other princes would or would not acknowledge him as &quot;grand prince&quot;. After the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27; and Sack of Kiev in the late 1230s and 1240s, the khans of the Golden Horde &quot;in effect, terminated the office of the &quot;velikiy knyaz″&quot; of Kiev and conferred political supremacy on their puppet in Vladimir.&quot;

=== Overview of princely branches of Kiev (1019–1169) ===
== Princes of Kiev after the Mongol conquest of Kiev ==
Due to the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27; 1240, Michael of Chernigov left Kiev to seek military assistance from King Béla IV of Hungary. During that time, Prince Rostislav of Smolensk occupied Kiev, but was captured the same year by Daniel of Galicia who placed his voivode Dmytro to govern Kiev on his behalf while he resided in Halych. Being unsuccessful in Hungary, Michael visited Konrad I of Masovia. Receiving no results in Poland, he eventually asked Daniel of Galicia for asylum due to the Mongol invasion. Since the 14th century, the principality of Kiev started to fall under the influence of Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1299, the Metropolitan of Kiev Maximus moved his metropolitan see from Kiev to Vladimir-on-Klyazma. In 1321, after the battle on the Irpin River, Gediminas installed Mindgaugas, one of his subjects from the house of Olshanski, a descendant of the family of Vseslav of Polotsk that was exiled to the Byzantine Empire. In 1331, Kiev was once again taken by a member of the Siverski house (Olgovichi branch), the prince of Putivl. After Grand Duke Algirdas defeated the Golden Horde at the Battle of Blue Waters in 1362, he incorporated Kiev and its surrounding areas into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

<text>Oleg (, ; ; died 912), also known as Oleg the Wise, was a Varangian prince of the Rus&#x27; who became prince of Kiev, and laid the foundations of the Kievan Rus&#x27; state.

According to the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, he succeeded his &quot;kinsman&quot; Rurik as ruler of Novgorod, and subdued many of the East Slavic tribes to his rule, extending his control from Novgorod to the south along the Dnieper river. Oleg also launched a successful attack on Constantinople. He died in 912 and was succeeded by Rurik&#x27;s son, Igor.

This traditional dating has been challenged by some historians, who point out that it is inconsistent with such other sources as the Schechter Letter, which mentions the activities of a certain khagan HLGW ( usually transcribed &quot;Helgu&quot;. Compare Swedish first name Helge.) of Rus&#x27; as late as the 940s, during the reign of Byzantine Emperor Romanus I. The nature of Oleg&#x27;s relationship with the Rurikid ruling family of the Rus&#x27;, and specifically with his successor Igor of Kiev, is a matter of much controversy among historians.

== Oleg in chronicles ==

According to the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, Oleg was a &quot;relative&quot; or &quot;kinsman&quot; of Rurik, and was entrusted by Rurik to take care of both his realm and his young son Igor. However, his relation to Rurik is debatable, and has been rejected by several modern scholars. Oleg is narrated to have succeeded Rurik as the ruler of Novgorod in 879. In 881–882, he took control of Smolensk, and then seized power in Kiev by tricking and slaying Askold and Dir, and setting himself up as prince in Kiev, which is commonly taken as the founding of Kievan Rus&#x27;. Although Oleg was the first &quot;prince&quot; (&quot;knyaz&quot;) of Kiev according to the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, he was not yet a &quot;grand prince&quot; (&quot;velikiy knyaz&quot;). Whereas later Muscovite chroniclers would call Oleg a &quot;grand prince&quot; and Kiev a &quot;grand principality&quot; (), the earliest sources do not.

In 883, Oleg made the Drevlians pay tribute to Kiev. In 907, the Drevlians took part in the Kievan military campaign against the Byzantine Empire: the Rus&#x27;-Byzantine War (907) against Constantinople in 907.

According to the chronicle, Oleg, assaulting the city, ordered to wait for favorable wind with sails spread at some other point. When wind arose, it drove the wheeled boats towards the city through the land. The citizens were forced to start a peace negotiation. Having fixed his shield to the gate of the imperial capital, Oleg won a favourable trade treaty, which eventually was of great benefit to both nations. Although Byzantine sources did not record these hostilities, the text of the treaty survives in the &quot;Chronicle&quot;.

The brief account of Oleg&#x27;s life in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; contrasts with the version given in the &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot;, which states that Oleg was not related to Rurik, and was rather a Scandinavian client-prince who served as Igor&#x27;s army commander. The &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot; does not give the date of the commencement of Oleg&#x27;s reign, but dates his death to 922 rather than 912.

Scholars have contrasted this dating scheme with the &quot;epic&quot; reigns of roughly thirty-three years for both Oleg and Igor in the Primary Chronicle. The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; and other Kievan sources place Oleg&#x27;s grave in Kiev, while Novgorodian sources identify a funerary barrow in Ladoga as Oleg&#x27;s final resting place.

=== Death according to legend ===

In the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, Oleg is known as the Prophet, an epithet alluding to the sacred meaning of his Norse name (&quot;priest&quot;). According to the legend, romanticised by Alexander Pushkin in his ballad &quot;The Song of the Wise Oleg,&quot; it was prophesied by the pagan priests (&quot;volkhvs&quot;) that Oleg would take death from his stallion.

To defy the prophecies, Oleg sent the horse away. Many years later he asked where his horse was, and was told it had died. He asked to see the remains and was taken to the place where the bones lay. When he touched the horse&#x27;s skull with his boot a snake slithered from the skull and bit him. Oleg died, thus fulfilling the prophecy.

Oleg&#x27;s death has been interpreted as a distorted variant of the threefold death theme in Indo-European myth and legend, with prophecy, the snake and the horse representing the three functions: the prophecy is associated with sovereignty, the horse with warriors, and the serpent with reproduction.

A variant of this story occurs in Scandinavian legend, in the 13th-century saga of Örvar-Oddr. Another variant is found in the tale of Sir Robert de Shurland on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, England.

== Oleg of the Schechter Letter ==
According to the Primary Chronicle, Oleg died in 912 and his successor, Igor of Kiev, ruled from then until his assassination in 945. The Schechter Letter, a document written by a Jewish Khazar, a contemporary of Romanus I Lecapenus, describes the activities of a Rus&#x27; warlord named HLGW (), usually transcribed as &quot;Helgu&quot;. For years many scholars disregarded or discounted the Schechter Letter account, which referred to Helgu (often interpreted as Oleg) as late as the 940s. 

Recently, however, scholars such as David Christian and Constantine Zuckerman have suggested that the Schechter Letter&#x27;s account is corroborated by various other Rus&#x27; chronicles, and suggests a struggle within the early Rus&#x27; polity between factions loyal to Oleg and to the Rurikid Igor, a struggle that Oleg ultimately lost. Zuckerman posited that the early chronology of the Rus&#x27; had to be re-determined in light of these sources. Among Zuckerman&#x27;s beliefs and those of others who have analyzed these sources are that the Khazars did not lose Kiev until the early 10th century (rather than 882, the traditional date), that Igor was not Rurik&#x27;s son but rather a more distant descendant, and that Oleg did not immediately follow Rurik, but rather that there is a lost generation between the legendary Varangian lord and his documented successors.

Of particular interest is the fact that the Schechter Letter account of Oleg&#x27;s death (namely, that he fled to and raided FRS, tentatively identified with Persia, and was slain there) bears remarkable parallels to the account of Arab historians such as Ibn Miskawayh, who described a similar Rus&#x27; attack on the Muslim state of Arran in the year 944/5.

== Attempts to reconcile the accounts ==
In contrast to Zuckerman&#x27;s version, the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; and the later &quot;Kiev Chronicle&quot; place Oleg&#x27;s grave in Kiev, where it could be seen at the time of the compilation of these documents. Furthermore, scholars have pointed out that if Oleg succeeded Rurik in 879 (as the East Slavic chronicles assert), he could hardly have been active almost 70 years later, unless he had a life-span otherwise unheard of in medieval annals. To solve these difficulties, Parkomenko (1924) proposed that the pagan monarch-priests of Rus&#x27; used the hereditary title of &quot;helgu&quot;, standing for &quot;holy&quot; in the Norse language, and that Igor and others held this title.

It has also been suggested that Helgu-Oleg who waged war in the 940s was distinct from both of Rurik&#x27;s successors. He could have been one of the &quot;fair and great princes&quot; recorded in the Russo-Byzantine treaties of 911 and 944 or one of the &quot;archons of Rus&quot; mentioned in &quot;De administrando imperio&quot;. But the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; does not specify the relations between minor Rurikid princes active during the period, although the names Rurik, Oleg and Igor were recorded among the late-10th-century and 11th-century Rurikids.

Georgy Vernadsky even identified the Oleg of the Schechter Letter with Igor&#x27;s otherwise anonymous eldest son, whose widow Predslava is mentioned in the Russo-Byzantine treaty of 944. Alternatively, V. Ya. Petrukhin speculated that Helgu-Oleg of the 940s was one of the vernacular princes of Chernigov, whose ruling dynasty maintained especially close contacts with Khazaria, as the findings at the Black Grave, a large royal kurgan excavated near Chernigov, seem to testify.

==In popular culture==

<text>Igor (; ; – 945) was Prince of Kiev from 912 to 945. Traditionally, he is considered to be the son of Rurik, who established himself at Novgorod and died in 879 while Igor was an infant. According to the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, Rurik was succeeded by Oleg, who ruled as regent and was described by the chronicler as being &quot;of his kin&quot;.

==Life==
Information about Igor comes mostly from the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, which states that Igor was the son of Rurik:

6378–6387 (870–879). On his deathbed, Rurik bequeathed his realm to Oleg, who belonged to his kin, and entrusted to Oleg&#x27;s hands his son Igor&#x27;, for he was very young.

6388–6390 (880–882). Oleg set forth, taking with him many warriors from among the Varangians, the Chuds, the Slavs, the Merians and all the Krivichians. He thus arrived with his Krivichians before Smolensk, captured the city, and set up a garrison there. Thence he went on and captured Lyubech, where he also set up a garrison. He then came to the hills of Kiev, and saw how Askold and Dir reigned there. He hid his warriors in the boats, left some others behind, and went forward himself bearing the child Igor&#x27;. He thus came to the foot of the Hungarian hill, and after concealing his troops, he sent messengers to Askold and Dir, representing himself as a stranger on his way to Greece on an errand for Oleg and for Igor&#x27;, the prince&#x27;s son, and requesting that they should come forth to greet them as members of their race. Askold and Dir straightway came forth. Then all the soldiery jumped out of the boats, and Oleg said to Askold and Dir, &quot;You are not princes nor even of princely stock, but I am of princely birth.&quot; Igor&#x27; was then brought forward, and Oleg announced that he was the son of Rurik. They killed Askold and Dir, and after carrying them to the hill, they buried them there, on the hill now known as Hungarian, where the castle of Ol&#x27;ma now stands.
Little is known about him between the years 912 and 941 due to a gap in the chronicle record.

Igor twice besieged Constantinople, in 941 and 944, and although Greek fire destroyed part of his fleet, he concluded a favourable treaty with the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII (945), the text of which the chronicle has preserved. In 913 and 944, the Rus&#x27; plundered the Arabs in the Caspian Sea during the Caspian expeditions of the Rus&#x27;, but it remains unclear whether Igor had anything to do with these campaigns.

Igor was killed while collecting tribute from the Drevlians in 945. The Byzantine historian and chronicler Leo the Deacon (born ) describes how Igor met his death: &quot;They had bent down two birch trees to the prince&#x27;s feet and tied them to his legs; then they let the trees straighten again, thus tearing the prince&#x27;s body apart.&quot; Igor&#x27;s widow Olga avenged his death by punishing the Drevlians. The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; blames his death on his own excessive greed, indicating that he tried to collect tribute for a second time in a month. As a result, Olga changed the system of tribute gathering (&quot;poliudie&quot;) in what may be regarded as the first legal reform recorded in Eastern Europe.
==Historiography==
Drastically revising the chronology of the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, Constantin Zuckerman argues that Igor actually reigned for three years, between summer 941 and his death in early 945. Zuckerman argues that the 33-year reign attributed to Igor in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; is the result of its author&#x27;s faulty interpretation of Byzantine sources. Indeed, none of Igor&#x27;s activities recorded in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; is dated before 941.

Referring to the Ioachim Chronicle, Vasily Tatishchev argues that the Swedish princess Efanda, whose existence has been questioned by many historians, was Igor&#x27;s mother. According to Tatishchev, the name &quot;Ingor&quot; comes from the Finnish (Izhora) name &quot;Inger&quot;. Tatishchev also gives Igor&#x27;s birth dates from various manuscripts: 875 in the Schismatic manuscript, 861 in the Nizhny Novgorod manuscript, 865 in the Orenburg manuscript.

<doc id="158414" wikidata="Q1135825" url="?curid=158414" title="Epicanthic fold">
<text>An epicanthic fold or epicanthus is a skin fold of the upper eyelid that covers the inner corner (medial canthus) of the eye. However, variation occurs in the nature of this feature and the presence of &quot;partial epicanthic folds&quot; or &quot;slight epicanthic folds&quot; is noted in the relevant literature. Various factors influence whether epicanthic folds form, including ancestry, age, and certain medical conditions.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Epicanthus&quot; means &#x27;above the canthus&#x27;, with epi-canthus being the Latinized form of the Ancient Greek : &#x27;corner of the eye&#x27;.

== Classification ==
Variation in the shape of the epicanthic fold has led to four types being recognised:

* Epicanthus supraciliaris runs from the brow, curving downwards towards the lachrymal sac.
* Epicanthus palpebralis begins above the upper tarsus and extends to the inferior orbital rim.
* Epicanthus tarsalis originates at the upper eyelid crease and merges into the skin near the medial canthus. This is the type most often found in East Asians.
* Epicanthus inversus runs from the lower eyelid skin over the medial canthus and extends to the upper lid.

== Ethnogeographic distribution ==

=== High-frequency populations ===
The highest frequency of occurrence of epicanthic folds is found in specific populations or ethnicities: East Asians, Southeast Asians, Central Asians, North Asians, Polynesians, Micronesians, Indigenous peoples of the Americas, and some African people (especially among Khoisan and Nilotic people). Among South Asians, they occur at very high frequencies among the Nepalis, Bhutanese, Northeast Indians, Kirati people and certain Adivasi tribes of Eastern and Southern India. It is also commonly found in Northern India, especially in Kashmir. The Hazara people in Afghanistan and Pakistan commonly have this trait. Some people in Eastern/Northern Pakistan have this trait. 

In some of these populations, the trait is almost universal. This is especially true in East Asians and Southeast Asians, where a majority, up to 90% in some estimations, of adults have this feature.

=== Lower-frequency populations ===
Epicanthic folds also occur, at a considerably lower frequency, in other populations: Europeans (e.g., Scandinavians, English, Irish, Hungarians, Russians, Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Finns, Estonians and Samis), Jews, South Asians (Bengalis, Sinhalese, among other groups in eastern and southern South Asia), Nilotes, Cushites, and Amazigh people.

=== Perception and attribution ===

The degree of development of the fold between individuals varies greatly, and attribution of its presence or absence is often subjective, being to a degree relative to the occurrence of the trait within the community of the specific observer. Also, its frequency varies but can be found in peoples all over the world. Its use, therefore, as a phenotypic marker to define biological populations is debatable.

== Possible evolutionary function ==
The epicanthic fold is often associated with greater levels of fat deposition around the eyeball. The adipose tissue is thought to provide greater insulation for the eye and sinuses from the effects of cold, especially from freezing winds, and to represent an adaptation to cold climates. It has also been postulated that the fold itself may provide a level of protection from snow blindness. Though its appearance in peoples of Southeast Asia can be linked to possible descent from cold-adapted ancestors, this does not explain its occurrence in various African peoples. The epicanthic fold found in many African people has been tentatively linked to protection for the eye from the high levels of ultraviolet light found in desert and semi-desert areas.

The exact evolutionary function and origin of epicanthic folds remains unknown. Scientific explanations include either random variation and selection (presumably sexual selection), or possible adaption to desert environment and/or high levels of ultraviolet light found in high-altitude environments, such as the Himalayas.

Dr. Frank Poirier, a physical anthropologist at Ohio State University, said that the epicanthic fold among Asian people is often explained as part of an adaptation to severe cold or tropical environments, however he suggests that neither of these explanations are sufficient to explain its presence in East and Southeast Asia, and notes that the fold can also be observed in Irish and African people. He attributes the epicanthic fold to pleiotropic genes that control more than one characteristic or function. He also did not offer an explanation for the origin of epicanthic folds.

== Other factors ==
=== Age ===
Many fetuses lose their epicanthic folds after three to six months of gestation. Epicanthic folds may be visible in the development stages of young children of any ethnicity, especially before the nose bridge fully develops.

=== Medical conditions ===
Epicanthic fold prevalence can sometimes be found as a sign of congenital abnormality, such as in Zellweger syndrome and Noonan syndrome. Medical conditions that cause the nasal bridge not to develop and project are also associated with epicanthic fold. About 60% of individuals with Down syndrome (also known as trisomy 21) have prominent epicanthic folds.

Other examples are fetal alcohol syndrome, phenylketonuria, and Turner syndrome.

<doc id="158416" wikidata="Q311291" url="?curid=158416" title="Yaropolk I of Kiev">
<text>Yaropolk I Sviatoslavich (also translitered as &quot;Iaropolk Svyatoslavich&quot;; ; 952 – 11 June 978) was Prince of Kiev from 972 to 978. He was the oldest son of Sviatoslav I. His mother was Malusha, who was a steward in the household of his grandmother, Olga of Kiev.

==Life==
Yaropolk was given Kiev by his father Sviatoslav I, who left on a military campaign against the Danube Bulgars. Soon after Sviatoslav&#x27;s death, however, civil war began between Yaropolk and his brothers. According to one chronicle, Yaropolk&#x27;s brother Oleg killed Lyut, the son of Yaropolk&#x27;s chief adviser and military commander Sveneld. Alternatively, Sveneld is identical to Sviatoslav, as Sveinald/Sveneld is the Norse rendition of the Slavic name. In an act of revenge and at Sveneld&#x27;s insistence, Yaropolk went to war against his brother and killed him. Yaropolk then sent his men to Novgorod, from which his other brother Vladimir had fled upon receiving news of Oleg&#x27;s death. Yaropolk became the sole ruler of Rus&#x27;.

In 980, Vladimir returned with the Varangian mercenaries and attacked Yaropolk. On his way to Kiev, Vladimir seized Polotsk because Rogneda, daughter of the Polotsk prince Rogvolod, had chosen Yaropolk over him. Vladimir forced Rogneda to marry him. Then, Vladimir seized Kiev with assistance from a boyar, Blud, who had become Yaropolk&#x27;s chief adviser upon the death of Sveneld. Blud betrayed Yaropolk by advising him to flee from Kiev to the town of Rodnya at the mouth of the Ros&#x27; River. Vladimir besieged Rodnya and starved Yaropolk into negotiations. Yaropolk trusted Blud&#x27;s and his brother&#x27;s promises of peace and left for Vladimir&#x27;s headquarters, where he was killed in an ambush by two Varangians.

==Purported baptism==
As for contemporary foreign sources, Lambert of Hersfeld records that, on the Easter of 973, the Holy Roman Emperor was visited by envoys from Rus&#x27; (&quot;legati gentium Ruscorum&quot;). In later centuries it was said that Yaropolk also exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The &quot;Chronicon&quot; of Adémar de Chabannes and the life of St. Romuald (by Pietro Damiani) document how St. Bruno of Querfurt was sent to Rus&#x27; (Latin: &quot;Russia&quot;) and succeeded in converting a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land) to Christianity. As both texts are rife with anachronisms, Vladimir Parkhomenko reasons that Bruno&#x27;s deeds were conflated with those of his predecessors, Adalbert of Prague and several anonymous missionaries active in Eastern Europe during Otto II&#x27;s reign.

Following this line of thought, Alexander Nazarenko suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered by his pagan half-brother (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before he could be formally received in the Christian faith. Any information on Yaropolk&#x27;s baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir&#x27;s image of the Russian Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations. It is known that Vladimir&#x27;s son Yaroslav had Yaropolk&#x27;s bones exhumed, christened and interred in the Church of the Tithes.

==Marriage and issue==
It is known that Yaropolk was married to a Greek nun. She gave birth to one son of disputed paternity:
* Sviatopolk I of Kiev ( 980 – 1019)

<text>Sviatopolk I Vladimirovich (also called &quot;Sviatopolk the Accursed&quot; or the &quot;Accursed Prince&quot;; ; – 1019) was Prince of Turov from 988 to 1015 and Grand Prince of Kiev from 1015 to 1019. He earned his sobriquet after allegedly murdering his brothers during his bid to take the throne. His actual responsibility is disputed by historians.

The Svyatopolk-Mirsky family of Rurikid origin attribute their descent from Sviatopolk. Tsar Peter the Great  recognized their descent during his reign.

==Early life==

Sviatopolk&#x27;s mother was a Greek nun captured by Sviatoslav I in Bulgaria and married to his lawful heir Yaropolk I, who became the prince in 972. In 980, Yaropolk&#x27;s brother Vladimir had him murdered, and the new sovereign married his predecessor&#x27;s wife, who gave birth to a child. Thus, Sviatopolk may have been the eldest of Vladimir&#x27;s sons, although his parentage has been questioned.

When Sviatopolk was eight years old, Vladimir put him in charge of Turov and later arranged his marriage with the daughter of Bolesław I the Brave of Poland. The young princess came to Turov together with Reinbern, the Bishop of Kolberg (now Kołobrzeg). Dissatisfied with Vladimir and encouraged by his own wife and Reinbern, Sviatopolk began preparations for war against Vladimir, probably counting on support from his father-in-law. Vladimir soon discovered Sviatopolk&#x27;s intentions, however, and threw him, his wife and Reinbern in prison, where Reinbern died.

==Biography according to domestic sources==

Not long before Vladimir&#x27;s death, Sviatopolk was freed from prison. In 1015, Sviatopolk&#x27;s retinue concealed Vladimir&#x27;s death from him to prevent him from claiming the Kievan throne. When Sviatopolk learned of Vladimir&#x27;s demise, he seized power in Kiev almost immediately.

The citizens of Kiev did not show much sympathy for Sviatopolk and, therefore, he decided to distribute presents in order to win them over. Then, he decided to rid himself of three of Vladimir&#x27;s sons, Boris, Gleb, and Sviatoslav, whose claims for the Kievan throne threatened his power. Boris presented the most danger to him because he had been in charge of Vladimir&#x27;s druzhina (personal guards) and army, and enjoyed the support of the citizens.

He sent the boyars of Vyshgorod to execute Boris. Boris and his manservant were stabbed to death when sleeping in a tent. The prince was discovered still breathing when his body was being transported in a bag to Kiev, but the Varangians put him out of his misery with the thrust of a lance.

Sviatopolk&#x27;s cold-blooded reprisal earned him the nickname of the Accursed. The news of this triple murder reached another son of Vladimir, Yaroslav, Prince of Novgorod, who decided to go to war against Sviatopolk with the support from the citizens of Novgorod and the Varangians. The battle took place in 1016 not far from Lubech, near the Dnieper river. Sviatopolk was defeated and fled to Poland.

In 1018, he returned to Rus&#x27;, defeated Yaroslav with help from his father-in-law and seized Kiev. Bolesław of Poland and his army remained in Rus&#x27; for several months, but later returned to Poland, seizing some Cherven towns on the way.

Meanwhile, the posadnik Konstantin Dobrynich and other citizens of Novgorod persuaded Yaroslav to go to war against Kiev once again. Sviatopolk was defeated and fled to the steppes. Soon he returned with the Pecheneg army and attacked Yaroslav on the Alta River, but was once again defeated and fled to Poland, dying on his way there in July 1019. Sviatopolk may have been murdered by a descendant of Valuk Conqueror (Wallux dux Winedorum) who in 1018 helped him and his father-in-law Bolesław I in expedition against Yaroslav.

==Biography according to foreign sources==

During the last century, the traditional account of Sviatopolk&#x27;s career has been somewhat modified. It has been argued that it was Boris who succeeded Vladimir in Kiev, while Sviatopolk was still in prison. One Norse saga called &quot;Eymund&#x27;s saga&quot; (a part of &quot;Yngvars saga víðförla&quot;), with remarkable details, puts on Yaroslav the blame of his brother Burizlaf&#x27;s murder. This Burizlaf, however, may be Sviatopolk (whose troops were commanded by the Polish duke Bolesław; the latter name is also rendered as Burizlaf in some sagas) as well as Boris.

Therefore, it has been suggested that Sviatopolk ascended the throne after Boris&#x27;s assassination and tried to fend off Yaroslav&#x27;s attacks as well as to punish his agents guilty of Boris&#x27;s murder. The chronicle of Thietmar of Merseburg, who died in 1018, could have been regarded as the only contemporary and unbiased account of events, save that Thietmar&#x27;s data may have been supplied by Sviatopolk himself during his brief exile at the Polish court. Unfortunately it can be interpreted ambiguously as far as the question of Sviatopolk&#x27;s guilt is concerned. One place in his chronicle can be interpreted as Sviatopolk escaping from Kiev to Poland &quot;immediately&quot; after his father&#x27;s death.

But Thietmar states that Bolesław supported his son-in-law against Yaroslav in 1017, which is the date, according to the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, of Sviatopolk&#x27;s first defeat by Yaroslav. Preparing a campaign against Kiev, Bolesław abruptly stopped a successful war against the German Emperor Henry II. So, it is unlikely that Sviatopolk had been present at his court since 1015, which is often supposed by the historians who consider Sviatopolk guilty of Boris and Gleb&#x27;s murders.

==Archeological record==
The I-S2077 subclade of Y-DNA haplogroup I-Z63 was sampled on an elite warrior buried in Bodzia Cemetery in a rich burial from ca. 1010-1020 AD. All artefacts there indicate a strong relation to the Kievan Rus&#x27; ruling elite, so this man who probably succumbed to combat wounds, was closely related to Sviatopolk. The cemetery in Bodzia is exceptional in terms of Scandinavian and Kievan Rus&#x27; links. The Bodzia man (sample VK157, or burial E864/I) was not a simple warrior from the princely retinue, but he belonged to the princely family himself.

His burial is the richest one in the whole cemetery, and strontium analysis of his tooth enamel shows he was not local. It is assumed that he came to Poland with Sviatopolk, and met a violent death in combat. This corresponds to the events of 1018 AD when Sviatopolk disappeared after having retreated from Kiev to Poland. It cannot be excluded that the Bodzia man was Sviatopolk.

<doc id="158425" wikidata="Q1030927" url="?curid=158425" title="Camper Van Beethoven">
<text>Camper Van Beethoven is an American rock band formed in Redlands, California, in 1983, later based in Santa Cruz and San Francisco. Their style mixes elements of pop, ska, punk, folk, alternative, country, and world music, among other genres. The band initially polarized audiences within the hardcore punk scene of California&#x27;s Inland Empire and then found wider acceptance and, eventually, an international audience. Their strong iconoclasm and emphasis on do-it-yourself values proved influential to the burgeoning indie rock movement.

The band&#x27;s first three independent records were released within an 18-month period. Their debut single was &quot;Take the Skinheads Bowling&quot;, a song later featured in Michael Moore&#x27;s 2002 film &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;. The group signed to Virgin Records in 1987, released two albums and enjoyed chart success with their 1989 cover of Status Quo&#x27;s &quot;Pictures of Matchstick Men&quot;, a number one hit on &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Modern Rock Tracks. They disbanded the following year due to internal tensions.
Lead singer David Lowery formed Cracker, David Immerglück joined Counting Crows, and several other members played in Monks of Doom. Beginning in 1999, the former members reunited and made several new records.

==History==
===Formative and early years (1983–1985)===
Camper Van Beethoven was preceded by several related garage bands based in Redlands, including Sitting Duck and the Estonian Gauchos (featuring future Cracker guitarist Johnny Hickman). These bands included future Camper Van Beethoven members bassist and vocalist David Lowery, guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Chris Molla, and often drummer Bill McDonald as well. The Estonian Gauchos and a late incarnation of Sitting Duck also included another future Camper Van Beethoven member, bassist Victor Krummenacher, whose joining allowed Lowery to switch to rhythm guitar. Sitting Ducks played a mixture of punk and acid rock, along with what Lowery described as &quot;fake Russian-sounding music&quot;. At the same time, Lowery, Molla and Krummenacher were studying in Santa Cruz at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and were musically active there as well. The former two played in the Santa Cruz-based Box O&#x27; Laffs, which also included future Camper Van Beethoven members Richie West, Anthony Guess, and Chris Pedersen at various times.

While on summer break in 1983, Lowery and Molla returned to Redlands and formed a new band, Camper Van Beethoven and the Border Patrol. The group featured Lowery, Molla, Krummenacher and McDonald, along with several other musicians at various points, including guitarist David McDaniel, harmonica player Mike Zorn and violinist Daniel Blume. Although this initial incarnation of the band only existed for three months, during this time they wrote much of the material which would feature on their debut album, including &quot;Take the Skinheads Bowling&quot;. The band&#x27;s name was coined by McDaniel: according to Lowery &quot;McDaniel was into this stuff that would sound like it made sense, but really it didn’t... He’d watch a lot of TV, accept all this mass-media stuff and spit it out all chopped up. I got the whole absurdism influence from him&quot;.

When Lowery, Molla and Krummenacher returned to college in Santa Cruz, Lowery and Molla resumed playing with Box O&#x27; Laffs. After meeting violinist, keyboardist and guitarist Jonathan Segel, they decided to re-form Camper Van Beethoven and the Border Patrol in Santa Cruz, with drummer Richie West replacing McDonald.

===First three albums (1985–1987)===
In 1985, the band reduced its name to Camper Van Beethoven, replaced West with Anthony Guess, and recorded their debut album, &quot;Telephone Free Landslide Victory&quot;. The record featured their first successful single, &quot;Take the Skinheads Bowling&quot;, the lesser hit &quot;The Day That Lassie Went to the Moon&quot;, and an experimental country-influenced cover version of Black Flag&#x27;s &quot;Wasted&quot;. The album featured songs with humorous lyrics, often simultaneously celebrating and mocking 1980s counterculture, and instrumental tracks featuring ska-beats and Eastern European, Mexican or Spaghetti-Western influenced guitar or violin lines.

Shortly after this record was released, lead guitarist Greg Lisher joined the group. The band recorded a set of songs with an expanded version of the lineup that recorded the debut, with Lisher playing lead on some songs. Guess departed shortly thereafter, leaving Lowery and Molla briefly to take turns swapping drumming duties. This incarnation recorded a second set of songs, with Molla handling the drums. At the end of the sessions, in 1986, long-term drummer Chris Pedersen was added.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;II &amp; III&quot;, was culled from both recording sessions. Segel played mandolin and sitar in addition to violin, and Molla played pedal steel guitar on some tracks. The album featured a noticeably expanded sound, with influences of country music and Americana mixed in with faux Indian or Arabic music and psychedelia.

Released later that year, their self-titled third album featured guest membership from experimental banjo and guitar player Eugene Chadbourne on their cover of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; and several other tracks. On the album, the elements of psychedelia on the previous album came to the fore. The album also featured some satirical political commentary on songs like &quot;Good Guys and Bad Guys&quot; and &quot;Joe Stalin&#x27;s Cadillac,&quot; the former which enjoyed some underground college radio play. Krummenacher, Lisher, Pedersen and Molla also formed the side project Monks of Doom, although Molla was quickly replaced by guitarist David Immerglück.

Molla left Camper Van Beethoven after touring for the third album, reducing the band to a five-piece with Lowery, Krummenacher, Segel, Lisher, and Pedersen — the longest-standing lineup in their initial career. Released in November 1987, the EP &quot;Vampire Can Mating Oven&quot; preceded a major label bidding war. The EP featured a more streamlined and accessible sound, with Lisher&#x27;s lead guitar taking a major role for the first time.

===Virgin Records years (1987–1990)===
In 1987 the band signed to Virgin Records. They released their fourth album &quot;Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart&quot;. The album featured a more streamlined, song-oriented approach, cutting back on the psychedelia and reducing the number of instrumentals, but keeping much of their eclectic approach. This was followed by extensive touring and preparations for recording their next album.

Due to internal tensions, Segel left the band during rehearsals for their fifth album. Written mostly as a four-piece, the resultant LP, &quot;Key Lime Pie&quot;, featured the violin playing of Don Lax before the replacement violinist Morgan Fichter (of the Bay Area band Harm Farm) was found. Fichter played violin on Opening Theme, Pictures of Matchstick Men and Flowers. The album featured a noticeably darker lyrical outlook as compared to the band&#x27;s previous records. Musically, it featured less of the world-music influences of the previous albums, replaced with more elements of Americana, along with a lusher, a more orchestrated version of psychedelia than their previous records had featured. They scored a minor hit with a cover of the Status Quo song &quot;Pictures of Matchstick Men&quot;, their highest-charting single.

David Immerglück (of the Ophelias and the Monks of Doom) joined in 1990 for touring behind the record, playing some of the departed Molla and Segel&#x27;s instrumental parts on steel guitar, guitar and mandolin. They broke up in April 1990 after a show in Örebro, Sweden.

===Inactive period (1990–1999)===
&quot;Camper Vantiquities&quot;, a compilation album packaging the &quot;Vampire Can Mating Oven&quot; EP with outtakes, demos, and rarities, was released in 1993.

After disbanding, Lowery and Hickman formed Cracker with bassist Davey Faragher. Krummenacher, Lisher, Immerglück and Pedersen intensified their activities in Monks of Doom, which remained active until 1993. These members also collaborated with Chadbourne under the name Camper Van Chadbourne. Immerglück later collaborated with Counting Crows, officially joining the group in 1999. Krummenacher began a solo career, recording several solo albums with guests such as Dave Alvin. Pedersen moved to Australia in 1998.

Segel played with Dieselhed and Sparklehorse, and fronted his own bands Hieronymus Firebrain and Jack &amp; Jill, later playing under his own name. He later became involved in experimental and electronic music, including collaborations with Fred Frith and Joelle Leandre, and Chaos Butterfly, an electro-acoustic duo with Dina Emerson. Segel and Krummenacher also ran their own record label, Magnetic Motorworks.

===Reunion; &quot;Tusk&quot; (1999–2004)===
In 1999, Lowery, Segel, and Krummenacher regrouped in the studio to assemble the experimental rarity set &quot;Camper Van Beethoven Is Dead. Long Live Camper Van Beethoven&quot;, which also contained newly recorded material. Segel and Krummenacher, along with Greg Lisher, also joined Cracker for a tour, playing a set of Camper songs for a section of the set, backed by drummer Frank Funaro and other Cracker members.

In 2002, the group played its first proper live shows in twelve years. With Lowery, Segel, Krummenacher and Lisher forming the core of the reunited lineup, two New York dates also featured Immerglück and two members of Cracker, drummer Frank Funaro and keyboardist Kenny Margolis. Three California dates omitted these latter three musicians and saw Pedersen return to the kit.

Also in 2002, they released the double-CD &quot;Tusk&quot;, a re-recording of the entire Fleetwood Mac album of the same name. Although initially announced as a rediscovery of a series of 1987 demos, the album was recorded in 2001 by Lowery, Segel, Krummenacher and Lisher as an experiment to see if the members could now work together. Extensive touring, mostly with Margolis and Funaro, followed.

The group next released &quot;Cigarettes &amp; Carrot Juice: The Santa Cruz Years&quot;, a five-disc box set compiling their first three (pre-Virgin) albums, &quot;Camper Vantiquities&quot;, and a live recording from 1990 they called &quot;Greatest Hits Played Faster.&quot; The latter recording featured live versions of several unreleased songs. Shortly thereafter, the band released &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot; versions of the first three records and &quot;Camper Vantiquities&quot;, which included remastering, re-sequencing and additional demo and B-side tracks.

===&quot;New Roman Times&quot;; live and compilation releases (2004–2012)===
In 2004, the band released &quot;New Roman Times&quot;, their first studio album of original material in 15 years. A concept album, the record detailed the rise and fall of an idealistic Texan whose disenchantment following a stint with the American military redirected him towards organized terrorism. It featured the band&#x27;s familiar eclectic sound, but also added a heavier, prog-metal sound on a few tracks. The lineup on the album included Lowery, Krummenacher, Segel, Lisher, Pedersen and Immergluck. The album also featured contributions by other Camper Van Beethoven associates, including Molla and Hickman. Following the album&#x27;s release, Pedersen and Immergluck did not participate in the touring lineup, and Funaro started to handle all of the drumming in live shows.

A limited-edition live concert disc was also released, &quot;In the Mouth of the Crocodile – Live in Seattle&quot;. Segments of a 2004 performance were released the following year as &quot;Discotheque CVB: Live in Chicago&quot;.

The band continued to frequently tour with Cracker (whom Krummenacher joined for a time), and in 2005 the two groups started an annual three-night &quot;Campout&quot; at Pappy and Harriet&#x27;s Pioneertown Palace in Pioneertown, California. The Campout has seen appearances by Built to Spill, Neko Case, Magnolia Electric Company, and John Doe, as well as sets from the individual members of the band.

A compilation of greatest hits, &quot;Popular Songs of Great Enduring Strength and Beauty&quot;, was released by Cooking Vinyl Records in June 2008. As band relations with Virgin Records were poor, they were not granted access to any material from the two Virgin LPs for this compilation. Thus, the band re-recorded five songs from these albums to include on the collection. These were the first and only Camper Van Beethoven studio tracks to include Funaro.

In 2011, the band began playing a series of shows that featured the &quot;Key Lime Pie&quot; record in its entirety, often joined by Immergluck. In the same year, they also revealed plans for a new album.

===&quot;La Costa Perdida&quot; and &quot;El Camino Real&quot; (2013–present)===
&quot;La Costa Perdida&quot;, the followup to &quot;New Roman Times&quot;, was released on January 22, 2013, preceded by the single &quot;Northern California Girls&quot;. The music was inspired in part by &quot;Holland&quot;-era Beach Boys. Most of the drumming on the album was by studio drummer and former Cracker member Michael Urbano, although Chris Pederson played on some tracks as well. Much of the album featured a gentler, more folky sound than their previous albums.

Lowery revealed in interviews that there were seven songs recorded during the sessions for &quot;La Costa Perdida&quot; that were not released, which would be included on a follow-up album to be finished in 2013. In August 2013, the band revealed on its Facebook page that it was tracking songs for the album, with Urbano on drums again. The band stated that the album would be a Southern California-themed sequel to the Northern California theme of &quot;La Costa Perdida&quot;. On March 2, 2014, the band announced a title for the new album, &quot;El Camino Real&quot;, which was released on June 3, 2014, in the United States and on June 23, 2014, in the UK. In contrast to the previous album, it featured some of the band&#x27;s most abrasive and intense music, mixing elements of prog-rock and punk with the band&#x27;s trademark eclecticism.

For subsequent tour dates, the band initially alternated Pedersen and Urbano on drums, due to health problems that have prevented Frank Funaro from playing. Since 2015, Chris Pedersen has been flying in from Australia to participate in the band&#x27;s infrequent tours, resulting in a reunion of their best-known late 80s lineup. David Immerglück also continues to join the band&#x27;s lineup for occasional shows.

In 2015 the band contributed two tracks to the original motion picture soundtrack for the film &quot;Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!&quot;, &quot;Long Way to Go (Sharknado)&quot; and &quot;Infinite Ocean&quot;.

<text>Robert Jemison Van de Graaff (December 20, 1901 – January 16, 1967) was an American physicist, noted for his design and construction of high-voltage Van de Graaff generators. He spent most of his career in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

==Biography==
Robert Jemison Van de Graaff was born in the Jemison-Van de Graaff Mansion in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to Adrian Sebastian &quot;Bass&quot; Van de Graaff and Minnie Cherokee Jemison. Robert&#x27;s great grandfather was Robert Jemison Jr. His father Adrian was a circuit judge. His father was of Dutch descent.

His three older brothers Adrian, Jr., Hargrove, and William were all All-Southern college football players for the Alabama Crimson Tide. William was known as &quot;Bully&quot; and was Alabama&#x27;s first All-American. In Tuscaloosa, Robert received his B.S. in mathematics (1922) and M.S. in mechanical engineering (1923) from The University of Alabama where he was a founding member of The Castle Club (later became Mu chapter of Theta Tau).

After a year working for the Alabama Power Company, Van de Graaff attended the Marie Curie lectures at the Sorbonne in 1925. During 1926, he earned a second B.S. at Oxford University by a Rhodes Scholarship, completing his D.Phil. under John Sealy Townsend at Oxford University in 1928.

Van de Graaff was the inventor of the Van de Graaff generator, a device which produces high voltages. During 1929, he developed his first such generator, producing 80,000 volts. By 1933, he had constructed a larger generator generating 7 million volts.

Van de Graaff spent 1929-1931 at Princeton, became a National Research Fellow, and from 1931 to 1934 a research associate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He became an associate professor in 1934 (staying there until 1960). He was awarded the Elliott Cresson Medal in 1936.

During World War II, Van de Graaff was director of the High Voltage Radiographic Project. After World War II, he co-initiated the High Voltage Engineering Corporation (HVEC) with John G. Trump. During the 1950s he invented the insulating-core transformer, producing high-voltage direct current. He also developed tandem generator technology.

The American Physical Society awarded him the T. Bonner prize (1965) for the development of electrostatic accelerators.

Van de Graaff died on January 16, 1967, in Boston, Massachusetts. His wife died in 1972.

In the year that he died, the progressive rock band Van der Graaf Generator was formed, named after him, notwithstanding the spelling errors. The Van de Graaff crater on the far side of the Moon is named after him.

==Van de Graaff generator==
Van de Graaff generators use a motorized insulating belt (usually made of rubber) to conduct electrical charges from a high voltage source on one end of the belt to the inside of a metal sphere on the other end. Since electrical charge resides on the outside of the sphere, it accumulates to produce an electrical potential much greater than that of the primary high voltage source. Practical limitations restrict the potential produced by large Van de Graaff generators to about 7 MV. Van de Graaff generators are used primarily as DC power supplies for linear atomic particle accelerators used for nuclear physics experiments. Tandem Van de Graaff generators are essentially two generators in series and can produce about 15 MV.

The Van de Graaff generator is a simple mechanical device. Small Van de Graaff generators are built by hobbyists and scientific apparatus companies and are used to demonstrate the effects of high DC potentials. Even small hobby machines produce impressive sparks several centimeters long. The largest air-insulated Van de Graaff generator in the world, built by Van de Graaff himself, is operational and is on display in the Boston Museum of Science. Demonstrations during daytimes are a popular attraction. More modern Van de Graaff generators are insulated by pressurized dielectric gas, usually freon or sulfur hexafluoride. During recent years, Van de Graaff generators have been slowly replaced by solid-state DC power supplies without moving parts. The energies produced by Van de Graaff atomic particle accelerators are limited to about 30 MeV, even with tandem generators accelerating doubly charged (for example alpha) particles. More modern particle accelerators using different technology produce much greater energies, thus Van de Graaff particle accelerators have become largely obsolete. They are still used to some extent for graduate student research at colleges and universities and as ion sources for high energy bursts.

<text>The Acteal massacre was a massacre of 45 people attending a prayer meeting of Catholic indigenous townspeople, including a number of children and pregnant women, who were members of the pacifist group Las Abejas (&quot;The Bees&quot;), in the small village of Acteal in the municipality of Chenalhó, in the Mexican state of Chiapas. Right-wing paramilitary group Máscara Roja murdered the victims on December 22, 1997, while the Government of Mexico first admitted responsibility for the massacre in September 2020.
==History==
The Las Abejas activists professed their support for the goals of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional - EZLN), including their rejection of applying violent means. Many suspect this affiliation as the reason for the attack, and government involvement or complicity. Soldiers at a nearby military outpost did not intervene during the attack, which lasted for hours. The following morning, soldiers were found washing the church walls to hide the blood stains. Some of the pregnant women who were part of the prayer group were intentionally stabbed and shot in the belly to kill their unborn children.

The EZLN and many Chiapas residents accused the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) of complicity, and following the change of government in 2000, survivors alleged that the investigation was being stalled, with authorities refusing to question or arrest suspects in the attacks.

Las Abejas, composed of people from 48 indigenous communities in the highlands of Chiapas, engaged in activism, issuing communiqués that denounced violence through actions centered around fasting and prayer. In November 2006, 100 men and 100 women members of the Abejas organized a peace and justice caravan to Oaxaca, to show their support for the Popular Assembly of the Oaxacan People (APPO) and denounce the repression and violence perpetrated by the state and federal governments. They also delivered at least three tons of food, water, and medicine to the APPO.

On August 27, 2007, Martín Rangel Cervantes, writing in national daily &quot;El Universal&quot;, stated that a federal judge assigned to the Acteal case sentenced, on July 22, 18 persons for their responsibility in this massacre. Each one got 40 years in prison.

, the Supreme Court decided to reopen the case due to the consistency of the reports made by different organisations pointing to the lack of accessibility of data of the case.

In 2014 the US Supreme Court turned down a case filed by the survivors of Acteal massacre against Connecticut resident and former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo on grounds of &quot;sovereign Immunity&quot; as a former head of state. On October 20, 2015, a group of Las Abejas group had a public hearing before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.

In July 2020, the government announced it was taking twenty actions to repair the damage related to the massacre, including recognition of the deaths caused by the paramilitary forces related to the government and the Institutional Revolutionary Party. An &quot;Acuerdo de Solución Amistosa&quot; (&quot;Friendly Settlement Agreement&quot;) is scheduled to be signed by 30 collateral victims of the massacre on September 3, 2020, that will include money for infrastructure projects in the region. The National Human Rights Commission said the 30 signers have agreed to lead peaceful, productive lives, and that the government has agreed to respect the rights of individuals who choose not to sign. Survivors of the massacre had requested the creation of Truth Commission in December 2018, a few days after the inauguration of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

On September 2, 2020, the Secretariat for Home Affairs admitted to having responsibility for the massacre. Alejandro Encinas Rodríguez, Undersecretary for Human Rights, officially admitted that the Mexican government had responsibility for the massacre, and he offered a public apology to the victims. This announcement and the signing of the Friendly Settlement Agreement ended the lawsuit filed in the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights by the victims. However, Fernando Luna Pérez, a victim speaking for &quot;Las Abejas&quot;, requested that the investigation continue and that former President Zedillo be tried.

<doc id="158429" wikidata="Q3887442" url="?curid=158429" title="Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart">
<text>Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart is a 1988 album by Camper Van Beethoven, released on Virgin Records. It was the band&#x27;s first major-label album, and was produced by Dennis Herring, the first time the band had used an outside producer.

The lineup on the album included David Lowery on lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Jonathan Segel on violin, mandolin, keyboards, guitar and backing vocals, Victor Krummenacher on bass and backing vocals, Greg Lisher on lead guitar, and Chris Pedersen on drums. It was the first Camper Van Beethoven album not to feature founding guitarist/drummer/multi-instrumentalist Chris Molla.

The album featured the band&#x27;s trademark eclectic mix of musics, including folk, ska, Eastern European music, Americana, psychedelic rock, and Middle-Eastern music. Despite this, it has a considerably slicker and more mainstream sound than the band&#x27;s previous, more garage-rock oriented albums, largely due to Herring&#x27;s production. The reunited Camper Van Beethoven features a number of tracks from the album in its setlists, including most of the first side, as well as &quot;Waka&quot;, &quot;Tania&quot;, and &quot;Life Is Grand&quot; from the second side.

Lowery described the inclusion of the folk song &quot;O Death&quot; as a tribute to the American 1960s psychedelic band Kaleidoscope, who included their version of the song on their album &quot;Side Trips&quot;.

==Track listing==


On the reissue, tracks 15–17 are from the &quot;Life Is Grand&quot; single, track 18 is from the &quot;Eye of Fatima&quot;/&quot;Turquoise Jewelry&quot; promo single, and track 25 is from the 1987 compilation &quot;At Dianne&#x27;s Place&quot;. Tracks 20–24 were recorded October 14, 1988, at UMass Amherst, Amherst, MA; they and track 19 were previously unreleased.

<text>Key Lime Pie is a 1989 album by Camper Van Beethoven (CVB). It was the band&#x27;s final album before breaking up in 1990, although the band has reunited and released new material in recent years. It was produced by Dennis Herring, who had also produced the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Key Lime Pie&quot; was the only Camper Van Beethoven album not to feature founding violinist/multi-instrumentalist/vocalist Jonathan Segel, who left the band before the album was recorded. The band&#x27;s core lineup on the album consisted of vocalist/rhythm guitarist/frontman David Lowery, bassist Victor Krummenacher, lead guitarist Greg Lisher and drummer Chris Pedersen. Most of the violin parts were played by Don Lax, who was hired only for recording sessions and was not a band member. Near the end of the recording of the album, violinist Morgan Fichter was hired as the replacement for Segel. Fichter played only on the tracks &quot;Opening Theme&quot;, &quot;Pictures of Matchstick Men&quot; and &quot;Flowers,&quot; although she sings harmony vocals on a few other tracks and appears on the record&#x27;s cover. On the tour for the album, the band was also joined by steel guitarist/mandolinist/guitarist David Immerglück, a member of CVB&#x27;s side project Monks of Doom.

Lowery has been quoted in interviews as saying that, although the entire band (save for Fichter) played on the basic tracks, Greg Lisher was the only other member to have contributed significantly to the album&#x27;s recording, with most of the overdubbing and studio polishing having been done by Lowery, Lisher and producer Dennis Herring. Lisher&#x27;s distinctive psychedelic lead guitar playing is arguably the album&#x27;s most distinctive instrumental feature, although the band&#x27;s use of violin also has a great influence on the sound of the record.

The album featured a darker lyrical outlook as compared to the band&#x27;s previous record, although there is still a great deal of the band&#x27;s trademark humor. It was also the most political record that CVB had released, with tracks like &quot;When I Win the Lottery,&quot; &quot;Sweethearts&quot; and &quot;Jack Ruby&quot; providing some humorous political and social commentary. Lowery said in an interview that &quot;All Her Favorite Fruit&quot; was based on the romance between Jessica Swanlake and Roger Mexico from the Thomas Pynchon novel &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;.

It also featured less of the band&#x27;s world music influence, although there are still elements of CVB favorites like ska and Eastern European music in songs like &quot;Opening Theme&quot; and &quot;Borderline.&quot; In place of the world-music influence, there are even more elements of Americana evident in many of the songs. Psychedelia, another staple of the band&#x27;s eclectic sound, is also very much in evidence, although songs like &quot;The Light from a Cake&quot; and &quot;Flowers&quot; feature a more-orchestrated, less-dissonant version of psychedelic music than did the band&#x27;s earlier albums.

The album was CVB&#x27;s most commercially successful record, with the Status Quo cover &quot;Pictures of Matchstick Men&quot; becoming an alternative rock hit and peaking at number one on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart.

<doc id="158434" wikidata="Q17059320" url="?curid=158434" title="Telephone Free Landslide Victory">
<text>Telephone Free Landslide Victory is an album by musical group Camper Van Beethoven, released on Independent Project Records and released in June 1985. It featured the band&#x27;s best known song, &quot;Take the Skinheads Bowling&quot;. The album has sold over 60,000 copies.

==About==
The band&#x27;s lineup at the time of recording was David Lowery (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Jonathan Segel (violin, keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), Chris Molla (guitar, backing vocals), Victor Krummenacher (bass, backing vocals), and Anthony Guess (drums). The album is the only Camper Van Beethoven record not to feature guitarist Greg Lisher. Lisher is actually listed in the album credits as a band member, but he did not join the band until after the album was recorded.

The reunited Camper Van Beethoven frequently features several of the album&#x27;s songs in their set lists, including &quot;Take the Skinheads Bowling&quot;, the countrified Black Flag cover &quot;Wasted&quot;, the hardcore send-up &quot;Club Med Sucks&quot;, &quot;The Day That Lassie Went to the Moon&quot;, &quot;Ambiguity Song&quot;, and several of the instrumentals.

The band originally intended the album to be titled &quot;Telephone Tree Landslide Victory&quot;, but a friend who was producing advance copies of the LP on cassette mistakenly replaced &quot;Tree&quot; with &quot;Free&quot;.

==Reception==

Michael Stipe named &quot;Telephone Free Landslide Victory&quot; one of his ten favorite albums of 1985 in a list he wrote for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

<text>Webster&#x27;s Dictionary is any of the US English language dictionaries edited in the early 19th century by Noah Webster (1758–1843), a US lexicographer, as well as numerous related or unrelated dictionaries that have adopted the Webster&#x27;s name in his honor. &quot;Webster&#x27;s&quot; has since become a genericized trademark in the United States for US English dictionaries, and is widely used in dictionary titles.

Merriam-Webster is the corporate heir to Noah Webster&#x27;s original works, which are in the public domain.

== Noah Webster&#x27;s &quot;American Dictionary of the English Language&quot; ==

Noah Webster (1758–1843), the author of the readers and spelling books which dominated the American market at the time, spent decades of research in compiling his dictionaries. His first dictionary, &quot;A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, appeared in 1806. In it, he popularized features which would become a hallmark of American English spelling (&quot;center&quot; rather than &quot;centre&quot;, &quot;honor&quot; rather than &quot;honour&quot;, &quot;program&quot; rather than &quot;programme&quot;, etc.) and included technical terms from the arts and sciences rather than confining his dictionary to literary words. Webster was a proponent of English spelling reform for reasons both philological and nationalistic. In &quot;A Companion to the American Revolution&quot; (2008), John Algeo notes: &quot;it is often assumed that characteristically American spellings were invented by Noah Webster. He was very influential in popularizing certain spellings in America, but he did not originate them. Rather [...] he chose already existing options such as &quot;center, color&quot; and &quot;check&quot; on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology&quot;. In William Shakespeare&#x27;s First Folios, for example, spellings such as &quot;center&quot; and &quot;color&quot; are the most common. He spent the next two decades working to expand his dictionary.

=== First edition 1828 ===
In 1828, when Noah Webster was 70, his &quot;American Dictionary of the English Language&quot; was published by S. Converse in two quarto volumes containing 70,000 entries, as against the 58,000 of any previous dictionary. There were 2,500 copies printed, at $20 (adjusted for 2023 inflation: $647.73) for the two volumes. At first the set sold poorly. When he lowered the price to $15 (adjusted for 2023 inflation: $485.80), its sales improved, and by 1836 that edition was exhausted. &quot;Not all copies were bound at the same time; the book also appeared in publisher&#x27;s boards; other original bindings of a later date are not unknown.&quot;

=== Second edition 1841 ===

==== 1841 printing ====
In 1841, 82-year-old Noah Webster published a second edition of his lexicographical masterpiece with the help of his son, William G. Webster. Its title page does not claim the status of second edition, merely noting that this new edition was the &quot;first edition in octavo&quot; in contrast to the quarto format of the first edition of 1828. Again in two volumes, the title page proclaimed that the &quot;Dictionary&quot; contained &quot;the whole vocabulary of the quarto, with corrections, improvements and several thousand additional words: to which is prefixed an introductory dissertation on the origin, history and connection of the languages of western Asia and Europe, with an explanation of the principles on which languages are formed. B. L. Hamlen of New Haven, Connecticut, prepared the 1841 printing of the second edition.

==== 1844 printing ====
When Webster died, in 1843, his heirs sold unbound sheets of his 1841 revision &quot;American Dictionary of the English Language&quot; to the firm of J. S. &amp; C. Adams of Amherst, Massachusetts. This firm bound and published a small number of copies in 1844 – the same edition that Emily Dickinson used as a tool for her poetic composition. However, a $15 (adjusted for inflation: $512.78) price tag on the book made it too expensive to sell easily, so the Amherst firm decided to sell out. Merriam acquired rights from Adams, as well as signing a contract with Webster&#x27;s heirs for sole rights.

==== 1845 printing ====
The third printing of the second edition was by George and Charles Merriam of Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1845. This was the first &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; with a Merriam imprint.

=== Influence ===
Lepore (2008) demonstrates Webster&#x27;s innovative ideas about language and politics and shows why Webster&#x27;s endeavors were at first so poorly received. Culturally conservative Federalists denounced the work as radicaltoo inclusive in its lexicon and even bordering on vulgar. Meanwhile, Webster&#x27;s old foes, the Jeffersonian Republicans, attacked the man, labeling him mad for such an undertaking.

Scholars have long seen Webster&#x27;s 1844 dictionary to be an important resource for reading poet Emily Dickinson&#x27;s life and work; she once commented that the &quot;Lexicon&quot; was her &quot;only companion&quot; for years. One biographer said, &quot;The dictionary was no mere reference book to her; she read it as a priest his breviary – over and over, page by page, with utter absorption.&quot;;

Austin (2005) explores the intersection of lexicographical and poetic practices in American literature, and attempts to map out a &quot;lexical poetics&quot; using Webster&#x27;s dictionaries. He shows the ways in which American poetry has inherited Webster and drawn upon his lexicography to reinvent it. Austin explicates key definitions from both the &quot;Compendious&quot; (1806), and &quot;American&quot; (1828) dictionaries and brings into its discourse a range of concerns including the politics of American English, the question of national identity and culture in the early moments of American independence, and the poetics of citation and of definition.

Webster&#x27;s dictionaries were a redefinition of Americanism within the context of an emergent and unstable American socio-political and cultural identity. Webster&#x27;s identification of his project as a &quot;federal language&quot; shows his competing impulses towards regularity and innovation in historical terms. Perhaps the contradictions of Webster&#x27;s project represented a part of a larger dialectical play between liberty and order within Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary political debates.

== Other dictionaries with Webster&#x27;s name ==

Noah Webster&#x27;s assistant, and later chief competitor, Joseph Emerson Worcester, and Webster&#x27;s son-in-law Chauncey A. Goodrich, published an abridgment of Noah Webster&#x27;s 1828 &quot;American Dictionary of the English Language&quot; in 1829, with the same number of words and Webster&#x27;s full definitions, but with truncated literary references and expanded etymology. Although it was more successful financially than the original 1828 edition and was reprinted many times, Noah Webster was critical of it. Worcester and Goodrich&#x27;s abridgment of Noah Webster&#x27;s dictionary was published in 1841 by White and Sheffield, printed by E. Sanderson in Elizabethtown, N.J. and again in 1844 by publishers Harper and Brothers of New York City, in 1844, with added words as an appendix.

=== &quot;New and Revised Edition&quot; 1847 ===
Upon Webster&#x27;s death in 1843, the unsold books and all rights to the copyright and name &quot;Webster&quot; were purchased by brothers George and Charles Merriam, who then hired Webster&#x27;s son-in-law Chauncey A. Goodrich, a professor at Yale College, to oversee revisions. Goodrich&#x27;s &quot;New and Revised Edition&quot; appeared on September 24, 1847, and a &quot;Revised and Enlarged&quot; edition in 1859, which added a section of illustrations indexed to the text. His revisions remained close to Webster&#x27;s work, but removed what later editors referred to as his &quot;excrescences&quot;.

=== British influence ===
In 1850, Blackie and Son in Glasgow published the first general dictionary of English that made heavy use of pictorial illustrations integrated with the text, &quot;The Imperial Dictionary, English, Technological, and Scientific, Adapted to the Present State of Literature, Science, and Art; On the Basis of Webster&#x27;s English Dictionary&quot;. Editor John Ogilve used Webster&#x27;s 1841 edition as a base, adding many new, specialized, and British words, increasing the vocabulary from &quot;Webster&quot;″s 70,000 to more than 100,000.

=== Unabridged edition 1864 ===

In response to Joseph Worcester&#x27;s groundbreaking dictionary of 1860, &quot;A Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, the G. &amp; C. Merriam Company created a significantly revised edition, &quot;A Dictionary of the English Language&quot;. It was edited by Yale University professor Noah Porter and published in 1864, containing 114,000 entries. It was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Webster–Mahn&quot; edition, because it featured revisions by C. A. F. Mahn, who replaced unsupportable etymologies which were based on Webster&#x27;s attempt to conform to Biblical interpretations of the history of language. It was the first edition to largely overhaul Noah Webster&#x27;s work, and the first to be known as the &quot;Unabridged&quot;. 

Later printings included additional material: a &quot;Supplement Of Additional Words And Definitions&quot; containing more than 4,600 new words and definitions in 1879, &quot;A Pronouncing Biographical Dictionary&quot; containing more than 9,700 names of noteworthy persons in 1879, and a &quot;Pronouncing Gazetteer&quot; in 1884. The 1883 printing of the book contained 1,928 pages and was 8½ in (22 cm) wide by 11½ in (29 cm) tall by 4¼ in (11 cm) thick. The 1888 printing (revision?) is similarly sized, with the last printed page number &quot;1935&quot; which has on its back further content (hence, 1936th page), and closes with &quot;Whole number of pages 2012&quot;. This dictionary carries the 1864 Preface by Noah Porter with postscripts of 1879 and 1884.

James A.H. Murray, the editor of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (1879–1928) says Webster&#x27;s unabridged edition of 1864 &quot;acquired an international fame. It was held to be superior to every other dictionary and taken as the leading authority on the meaning of words, not only in America and England, but also throughout the Far East.&quot;

=== &quot;Webster&#x27;s International Dictionary&quot; (1890 and 1900) ===

Porter also edited the succeeding edition, &quot;Webster&#x27;s International Dictionary of the English Language&quot; (1890), which was an expansion of the &quot;American Dictionary&quot;. It contained about 175,000 entries. In 1900, &quot;Webster&#x27;s International&quot; was republished with a supplement that added 25,000 entries to it.

In 1898, the &quot;Collegiate Dictionary&quot; also was introduced (see below).

=== &quot;Webster&#x27;s New International Dictionary&quot; 1909 ===

The Merriam Company issued a complete revision in 1909, &quot;Webster&#x27;s New International Dictionary&quot;, edited by William Torrey Harris and F. Sturges Allen. Vastly expanded, it covered more than 400,000 entries, and double the number of illustrations. A new format feature, the &quot;divided page&quot;, was designed to save space by including a section of &quot;words below the line&quot; at the bottom of each page: six columns of very fine print, devoted to such items as rarely used, obsolete, and foreign words, abbreviations, and variant spellings. Notable improvement was made in the treatment and number of &quot;discriminated synonyms&quot;, comparisons of subtle shades of meaning. Also added was a twenty-page chart comparing the Webster&#x27;s pronunciations with those offered by six other major dictionaries. This edition was reprinted in 1913. Being in the public domain and having been scanned and OCRd, this edition has had substantial influence on Wiktionary.

=== &quot;Webster&#x27;s New International Dictionary&quot; (second edition, 1934) ===
In 1934, the &quot;New International Dictionary&quot; was revised and expanded for a second edition, which is popularly known as &quot;Webster&#x27;s Second&quot; or &quot;W2&quot;, although it was not published under that title. It was edited by William Allan Neilson and Thomas A. Knott. It contained 3,350 pages and sold for $39.50 (adjusted for inflation: $755.77). Some versions added a 400-page supplement called &quot;A Reference History of the World&quot;, which provided chronologies &quot;from earliest times to the present&quot;. The editors claimed more than 600,000 entries, more than any other dictionary at that time, but that number included many proper names and newly added lists of undefined &quot;combination words&quot;. Multiple definitions of words are listed in chronological order, with the oldest, and often obsolete, usages listed first. For example, the first definition of &quot;starve&quot; includes dying of exposure to the elements as well as from lack of food.

The numerous picture plates added to the book&#x27;s appeal and usefulness, particularly when pertaining to things found in nature. Conversely, the plate showing the coins of the world&#x27;s important nations quickly proved to be ephemeral. Numerous gold coins from various important countries were included, including American eagles, at a time when it had recently become illegal for Americans to own them, and when most other countries had withdrawn gold from active circulation as well.

Early printings of this dictionary contained the erroneous ghost word &quot;dord&quot;.

Because of its style and word coverage, &quot;Webster&#x27;s Second&quot; is still a popular dictionary. For example, in the case of &quot;Miller Brewing Co. v. G. Heileman Brewing Co., Inc&quot;., 561 F.2d 75 (7th Cir. 1977) – a trademark dispute in which the terms &quot;lite&quot; and &quot;light&quot; were held to be generic for light beer and therefore available for use by anyone – the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, after considering a definition from &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third New International Dictionary&quot;, wrote that &quot;[T]he comparable definition in the previous, and for many the classic, edition of the same dictionary is as follows:...&quot;

== &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third New International Dictionary&quot; (1961) ==

After about a decade of preparation, G. &amp; C. Merriam issued the entirely new &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged&quot; (commonly known as &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third&quot;, or &quot;W3&quot;) in September 1961.

The dictionary was met with considerable criticism for its descriptive (rather than prescriptive) approach. The dictionary&#x27;s treatment of &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot; was subject to particular scorn, since it seemed to overrule the near-unanimous denunciation of that word by English teachers.

=== Revisions and updates ===
Since the 1961 publication of the &quot;Third&quot;, Merriam-Webster has reprinted the main text of the dictionary with only minor corrections. To add new words, they created an &quot;Addenda Section&quot; in 1966, included in the front matter, which was expanded in 1971, 1976, 1981, 1986, 1993, and 2002. However, the rate of additions was much slower than it had been throughout the previous hundred years. Following the purchase of Merriam-Webster by Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. in 1964, a three-volume version was issued for many years as a supplement to the encyclopedia. At the end of volume three, this edition included the &quot;Britannica World Language Dictionary&quot;, 474 pages of translations between English and French, German, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, and Yiddish. A CD-ROM version of the complete text, with thousands of additional new words and definitions from the &quot;addenda&quot;, was published by Merriam-Webster in 2000, and is often packaged with the print edition. The third edition was published in 2000 on Merriam-Webster&#x27;s website as a subscription service.

Planning for a Fourth edition of the &quot;Unabridged&quot; began with a 1988 memo from Merriam-Webster president William Llewellyn but was repeatedly deferred in favor of updates to the more lucrative &quot;Collegiate&quot;. Work on a full revision finally began in 2009. In January 2013, the &quot;Third New International&quot; website service was rebranded as the &quot;Unabridged&quot; with the first &quot;Release&quot; of 4,800 new and revised entries added to the site. There were two further &quot;Releases&quot; in 2014. The revised website is not branded as the &quot;Fourth edition&quot; and it is unlikely that a print version will ever be produced, because demand is declining and its increased size would make it unwieldy and expensive.

== Merriam-Webster&#x27;s &quot;Collegiate Dictionary&quot; ==


Merriam-Webster introduced its &quot;Collegiate Dictionary&quot; in 1898 and the series is now in its eleventh edition. Following the publication of &quot;Webster&#x27;s International&quot; in 1890, two &quot;Collegiate&quot; editions were issued as abridgments of each of their &quot;Unabridged&quot; editions.

With the ninth edition (&quot;Webster&#x27;s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary&quot; (WNNCD), published in 1983), the &quot;Collegiate&quot; adopted changes which distinguish it as a separate entity rather than merely an abridgment of the &quot;Third New International.&quot; Some proper names were returned to the word list, including names of Knights of the Round Table. The most notable change was the inclusion of the date of the first known citation of each word, to document its entry into the English language. The eleventh edition (published in 2003) includes more than 225,000 definitions, and more than 165,000 entries. A CD-ROM of the text is sometimes included.

This dictionary is preferred as a source &quot;for general matters of spelling&quot; by &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot;, which is followed by many book publishers and magazines in the United States. The &quot;Chicago Manual&quot; states that it &quot;normally opts for&quot; the first spelling listed.

In addition to its &quot;Collegiate&quot; editions G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. also produced abridged editions for students (&quot;Primary School, Elementary School, Secondary School, High School, Common School, Academic&quot;) as well as for general public (&quot;Condensed, Practical, Handy&quot;). The first edition of the abridged &quot;Primary School&quot; dictionary was prepared by Noah Webster in 1833 and later revised by William G. Webster and William A. Wheeler.

== The name Webster used by others ==
Since the late 19th century, dictionaries bearing the name &quot;Webster&#x27;s&quot; have been published by companies other than Merriam-Webster. Some of these were unauthorized reprints of Noah Webster&#x27;s work; some were revisions of his work. One such revision was &quot;Webster&#x27;s Imperial Dictionary&quot;, based on John Ogilvie&#x27;s &quot;The Imperial Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, itself an expansion of Noah Webster&#x27;s &quot;American Dictionary&quot;.

Following legal action by Merriam, successive US courts ruled by 1908 that &quot;Webster&#x27;s&quot; entered the public domain when the &quot;Unabridged&quot; did, in 1889. In 1917, a US court ruled that &quot;Webster&#x27;s&quot; entered the public domain in 1834 when Noah Webster&#x27;s 1806 dictionary&#x27;s copyright lapsed. Thus, &quot;Webster&#x27;s&quot; became a genericized trademark and others were free to use the name on their own works.

Since then, use of the name &quot;Webster&quot; has been rampant. Merriam-Webster goes to great pains to remind dictionary buyers that it alone is the heir to Noah Webster. Although Merriam-Webster revisers find solid ground in Noah Webster&#x27;s concept of the English language as an ever-changing tapestry, the issue is more complicated than that. Throughout the 20th century, some non-Merriam editions, such as &quot;Webster&#x27;s New Universal&quot;, were closer to Webster&#x27;s work than contemporary Merriam-Webster editions. Further revisions by Merriam-Webster came to have little in common with their original source, while the &quot;Universal&quot;, for example, was minimally revised and remained largely out of date.

So many dictionaries of varied size and quality have been called &quot;Webster&#x27;s&quot; that the name no longer has any specific brand meaning. Despite this, many people still recognize and trust the name. Thus, &quot;Webster&#x27;s&quot; continues as a powerful and lucrative marketing tool. In recent years, even established dictionaries with no direct link to Noah Webster whatsoever have adopted his name, adding to the confusion. Random House dictionaries are now called &quot;Random House Webster&#x27;s&quot;, and Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Encarta World English Dictionary&quot; is now &quot;Encarta Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;. The dictionary now called &quot;Webster&#x27;s New Universal&quot; no longer even uses the text of the original &quot;Webster&#x27;s New Universal&quot; dictionary, but rather is a newly commissioned version of the &quot;Random House Dictionary&quot;.

The &quot;Webster&#x27;s Online Dictionary: The Rosetta Edition&quot; is not linked to Merriam-Webster Online. It is a multilingual online dictionary created in 1999 by Philip M. Parker. This site compiles different online dictionaries and encyclopedia including the &quot;Webster&#x27;s Revised Unabridged Dictionary&quot; (1913), Wiktionary and Wikipedia.

== Competition ==
Noah Webster&#x27;s main competitor was Joseph Emerson Worcester, whose 1830 &quot;Comprehensive Pronouncing and Explanatory Dictionary of the English Language&quot; brought accusations of plagiarism from Webster. The rivalry was carried on by Merriam after Webster&#x27;s death, in what is often referred to as the &quot;Dictionary Wars&quot;. After Worcester&#x27;s death in 1865, revision of his &quot;Dictionary of the English Language&quot; was soon discontinued, and it eventually went out of print.

The American edition of Charles Annandale&#x27;s four volume revision of &quot;The Imperial Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, published in 1883 by the Century Company, was more comprehensive than the &quot;Unabridged&quot;. The &quot;Century Dictionary&quot;, an expansion of the &quot;Imperial&quot; first published from 1889 to 1891, covered a larger vocabulary until the publication of &quot;Webster&#x27;s Second&quot; in 1934, after the &quot;Century&quot; had ceased publication.

In 1894 came &quot;Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Dictionary&quot;, an attractive one volume counterpart to &quot;Webster&#x27;s International&quot;. The expanded &quot;New Standard&quot; of 1913 was a worthy challenge to the &quot;New International&quot;, and remained a major competitor for many years. However, Funk &amp; Wagnalls never revised the work, reprinting it virtually unchanged for more than 50 years, while Merriam published two major revisions.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (&quot;OED&quot;), which published its complete first edition in 1933, challenged &quot;Merriam&quot; in scholarship, though not in the marketplace due to its much larger size. The &quot;New International&quot; editions continued to offer words and features not covered by the &quot;OED&quot;, and vice versa. In the 1970s, the &quot;OED&quot; began publishing &quot;Supplements&quot; to its dictionary and in 1989 integrated the new words in the supplements with the older definitions and etymologies in its &quot;Second Edition&quot;.

Between the 1930s and the 1950s, several college dictionaries, notably the &quot;American College Dictionary&quot; and (non-Merriam) &quot;Webster&#x27;s New World Dictionary&quot;, entered the market alongside the &quot;Collegiate&quot;. Among larger dictionaries during this period was (non-Merriam) &quot;Webster&#x27;s Universal Dictionary&quot; (also published as &quot;Webster&#x27;s Twentieth Century Dictionary&quot;) which traced its roots to Noah Webster and called itself &quot;unabridged&quot;, but had less than half the vocabulary and paled in scholarship against the &quot;Merriam&quot; editions.

After the commercial success of &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third New International&quot; in the 1960s, Random House responded by adapting its college dictionary by adding more illustrations and large numbers of proper names, increasing its print size and page thickness, and giving it a heavy cover. In 1966, it was published as a new &quot;unabridged&quot; dictionary. It was expanded in 1987, but it still covered no more than half the actual vocabulary of &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third&quot;.

The American Heritage Publishing Co., highly critical of &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third&quot;, failed in an attempt to buy out Merriam-Webster and determined to create its own dictionary, &quot;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language&quot;. In 1969, it issued a college-sized dictionary. Now in its fifth edition, it is only slightly greater in vocabulary than the &quot;Collegiate&quot;, but it appears much larger and has the appeal of many pictures and other features, such as a usage panel of language professionals which is polled for the acceptability of certain word usage, and a discussion for some entries of subtle differences among words with similar meaning. Other medium-sized dictionaries have since entered the market, including the &quot;New Oxford American&quot; and the &quot;Encarta Webster&#x27;s&quot;, while Merriam-Webster has not attempted to compete by issuing a similar edition.

<text>A buzzword is a word or phrase, new or already existing, that becomes popular for a period of time. Buzzwords often derive from technical terms yet often have much of the original technical meaning removed through fashionable use, being simply used to impress others. Some buzzwords retain their true technical meaning when used in the correct contexts, for example artificial intelligence.
Buzzwords often originate in jargon, acronyms, or neologisms. Examples of overworked business buzzwords include &quot;synergy&quot;, &quot;vertical&quot;, &quot;dynamic&quot;, &quot;cyber&quot; and &quot;strategy&quot;. 

It has been stated that businesses could not operate without buzzwords, as they are the shorthands or internal shortcuts that make perfect sense to people informed of the context. However, a useful buzzword can become co-opted into general popular speech and lose its usefulness. According to management professor Robert Kreitner, &quot;Buzzwords are the literary equivalent of Gresham&#x27;s law. They will drive out good ideas.&quot;
Buzzwords, or buzz-phrases such as &quot;all on the same page&quot;, can also be seen in business as a way to make people feel like there is a mutual understanding. As most workplaces use a specialized jargon, which could be argued is another form of buzzwords, it allows quicker communication. Indeed, many new hires feel more like &quot;part of the team&quot; the quicker they learn the buzzwords of their new workplace. Buzzwords permeate people&#x27;s working lives so much that many do not realize that they are using them. The vice president of CSC Index, Rich DeVane, notes that buzzwords describe not only a trend, but also what can be considered a &quot;ticket of entry&quot; with regards to being considered as a successful organization – &quot;What people find tiresome is each consulting firm&#x27;s attempt to put a different spin on it. That&#x27;s what gives bad information.&quot;

Buzzwords also feature prominently in politics, where they can result in a process which &quot;privileges rhetoric over reality, producing policies that are &#x27;operationalized&#x27; first and only &#x27;conceptualized&#x27; at a later date&quot;. The resulting political speech is known for &quot;eschewing reasoned debate (as characterized by the use of evidence and structured argument), instead employing language exclusively for the purposes of control and manipulation&quot;.

==Definition==
The &quot;Concise Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines a buzzword (hyphenating the term as &quot;buzz-word&quot;) as a slogan, or as a fashionable piece of jargon: a chic, fashionable, voguish, trendy word a la mode.

It has been asserted that buzzwords do not simply appear, they are created by a group of people working within a business as a means to generate hype. Buzzwords are most closely associated with management and have become the vocabulary that is known as &quot;management speak&quot;: Using a pompous or magisterial term, of or relating to a particular subject employed to impress those outside of the field of expertise.

It could also be called buzz phrase or loaded word.

What this means is that when a manager uses a said buzzword, most other people do not hear the meaning, and instead just see it as a buzzword. However it has been said that buzzwords are almost a &quot;necessary evil&quot; of management, as a way to inspire their team, but also stroke their own egos. With that being said, a buzzword is not necessarily a bad thing, as many disciplines thrive with the introduction of new terms which can be called buzzwords. These can also cross over into pop culture and indeed even into everyday life. With media channels now operating through many media, such as television, radio, print and increasingly digital (especially with the rise of social media), a &quot;buzzword&quot; can catch on and rapidly be adapted through the world.

==Origin==

The origin of buzzwords can be seen in as coming from business students studying at Harvard University as a way to help them gain better results from their studies. Such language terms were collated and then became what is known today as &quot;buzzwords&quot;. During the early years of buzzwords, buzzwords were used by students as a means to enable them to quickly recall items of importance. As an example, &quot;If his analysis does not highlight the most important problems he has &#x27;poor focus&#x27;, and if he fails to emphasize important recommendations he will be accused of &#x27;tinkering&#x27;. If the sequence for the &#x27;implementation&#x27; of the recommendations is not good it is a matter of &#x27;poor timing&#x27;. To succeed, the student must &#x27;get on top of the problem&#x27;. He must &#x27;hit the problem&#x27; and not &#x27;shadow box&#x27; it. If he cannot do these things he might just as well &#x27;turn in his suit&#x27;&quot;.

Students have used many different buzzwords to describe the situation that they are in, and how this might affect a moment in their everyday life. From studying these business students, noticed that business students could speak with apparent authority. It also seemed as if using the right buzzword was more important than what the student came up with as an answer. Buzzwords have a strong influence on business culture and are commonly used in business speak.

==In popular culture==
Jon Keegan of the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; has published a Business Buzzwords Generator, which allows readers to use a randomizer to assemble &quot;meaningless business phrases using overused business buzzwords&quot; – for example, &quot;This product will incentivize big data and demonstrate innovative performance in the playing field.&quot;

&quot;Forbes&quot; hosts an annual &quot;Jargon Madness&quot; game, in which 32 of &quot;corporate America&#x27;s most insufferable expressions&quot; are played off against each other in a bracketed, basketball-style tournament to determine the buzzword of the year.

LinkedIn publishes an annual list of buzzwords to avoid in creating résumés (British English: CVs) – &quot;trite, empty words that may sound good to your ear but say almost nothing&quot;. The 2014 list: &quot;motivated&quot;, &quot;passionate&quot;, &quot;creative&quot;, &quot;driven&quot;, &quot;extensive experience&quot;, &quot;responsible&quot;, &quot;strategic&quot;, &quot;track record&quot;, &quot;organizational&quot;, and &quot;expert&quot;.

When people are approaching a meeting where they expect the presenters to use many buzzwords, they may prepare a game of buzzword bingo, where players score points each time a particular buzzword is used.

Patch Products has published a board game called &quot;Buzzword&quot;.

The &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic album &quot;Mandatory Fun&quot; contains the song &quot;Mission Statement&quot;, which is a long list of essentially meaningless buzzwords.

<text>Rachel Hannah Weisz (; born 7 March 1970) is an English actress. Known for her roles in independent films and blockbusters, she has received several awards, including an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Laurence Olivier Award.

Weisz began acting in stage and television productions in the early 1990s, and made her film debut in &quot;Death Machine&quot; (1994). She won a Critics&#x27; Circle Theatre Award for her role in the 1994 revival of Noël Coward&#x27;s play &quot;Design for Living&quot;, and went on to appear in the 1999 Donmar Warehouse production of Tennessee Williams&#x27; drama &quot;Suddenly Last Summer&quot;. Her film breakthrough came with her starring role as Evelyn Carnahan in the Hollywood action films &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; (2001). Weisz went on to star in several films of the 2000s, including &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; (2001), &quot;About a Boy&quot; (2002), &quot;Runaway Jury&quot; (2003), &quot;Constantine&quot; (2005), &quot;The Fountain&quot; (2006), &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; (2009) and &quot;The Whistleblower&quot; (2010).

For her performance as an activist in the 2005 thriller &quot;The Constant Gardener&quot;, she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, and for playing Blanche DuBois in a 2009 revival of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, she won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress. In the 2010s, Weisz continued to star in big-budget films such as the action film &quot;The Bourne Legacy&quot; (2012) and the fantasy film &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot; (2013) and achieved critical acclaim for her performances in the independent films &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot; (2011), &quot;Denial&quot; (2016), and &quot;The Favourite&quot; (2018). For her portrayal of Sarah Churchill in &quot;The Favourite&quot;, she won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and received a second Academy Award nomination. Weisz portrayed Melina Vostokoff in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Black Widow&quot; (2021) and starred as twin obstetricians in the thriller miniseries &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; (2023).

==Early life and family==
Weisz was born on 7 March 1970 in Westminster, London, and grew up in Hampstead Garden Suburb. Her father, George Weisz, was a Hungarian Jewish mechanical engineer. Her mother, Edith Ruth ( Teich), was a teacher-turned-psychotherapist originally from Vienna, Austria. Her maternal grandfather&#x27;s ancestry was Austrian Jewish; her maternal grandmother was Catholic and of Italian ancestry. The scholar and social activist James Parkes helped her mother&#x27;s family to leave Austria for England. Weisz&#x27;s mother was raised in the Catholic church and formally converted to Judaism upon marrying Weisz&#x27;s father. Weisz&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Alexander Teich, a Jewish activist who had been a secretary of the World Union of Jewish Students.

Her parents immigrated to the United Kingdom as children around 1938, prior to the outbreak of World War II, in order to escape the Nazis. Her younger sister Minnie Weisz is a visual artist. Weisz&#x27;s parents valued the arts; they encouraged their children to form opinions of their own by engaging their participation in family debates. Weisz left North London Collegiate School and attended Benenden School for one year, completing A-levels at St Paul&#x27;s Girls School.

Known for being an &quot;English rose&quot;, Weisz began modelling at the age of 14. In 1984, she gained public attention when she turned down an offer to star in &quot;King David&quot; with Richard Gere.

Weisz went to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where she read English, matriculating in 1988. She graduated with upper second-class honours. During her university years she was a contemporary of Sacha Baron Cohen, Alexander Armstrong, Emily Maitlis, Sue Perkins, Mel Giedroyc, Richard Osman and Ben Miller (whom she briefly dated), and appeared in various student dramatic productions, co-founding a student drama group called Cambridge Talking Tongues. The group won a &quot;Guardian&quot; Student Drama Award at the 1991 Edinburgh Festival Fringe for an improvised piece written by Weisz herself called &quot;Slight Possession&quot;, directed by David Farr.

==Career==
===1990s===
In 1992, Weisz appeared in the television film &quot;Advocates II&quot;, followed by roles in the &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; episode &quot;Twilight of the Gods&quot;, and the BBC&#x27;s steamy period drama &quot;Scarlet and Black&quot;, alongside Ewan McGregor. &quot;Dirty Something&quot;, a BBC Screen Two, hour-long television film made in 1992, was Weisz&#x27;s first film.

Weisz&#x27;s breakthrough role on the stage was that of Gilda in Sean Mathias&#x27;s 1994 revival of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Design for Living&quot; at the Gielgud Theatre, for which she received the London Critics&#x27; Circle Award for the most promising newcomer. Her portrayal was described as &quot;wonderful&quot; by a contemporary review.

Weisz started her film career with a minor role in the 1994 film &quot;Death Machine&quot;; her first major role came in the 1996 film &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;. The film received mostly negative reviews–it holds a 16% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and was a minor financial success. She next appeared as Miranda Fox in &quot;Stealing Beauty&quot;, directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, where she was first labelled an &quot;English rose&quot;.

Weisz found roles in the 1997 American drama &quot;Swept from the Sea&quot;, the 1998 British television comedy-drama &quot;My Summer with Des&quot;, Michael Winterbottom&#x27;s crime film &quot;I Want You&quot;, and David Leland&#x27;s &quot;The Land Girls&quot;, based on Angela Huth&#x27;s book of the same name.

In 1999, Weisz played Greta in the historical film &quot;Sunshine&quot;. The same year, her international breakthrough came with the 1999 adventure film &quot;The Mummy&quot;, in which she played the female lead opposite Brendan Fraser. Her character, Evelyn Carnahan, is an English Egyptologist, who undertakes an expedition to the fictional ancient Egyptian city of Hamunaptra to discover an ancient book. &quot;Variety&quot; criticised the direction of the film, writing: &quot;(the actors) have been directed to broad, undisciplined performances [...] Buffoonery hardly seems like Weisz&#x27;s natural domain, as the actress strains for comic effects that she can&#x27;t achieve&quot;. She followed this up with the sequel &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; in 2001, which grossed an estimated $433 million worldwide, (equivalent to $ million in dollars) higher than the original&#x27;s $260 million (equal to $ million in dollars).

Also in 1999, she played the role of Catherine in the Donmar Warehouse production of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;Suddenly Last Summer&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s on Stage&quot; called her &quot;captivating&quot;, stating that she brought &quot;a degree of credibility to a difficult part&quot;. The same year, Weisz appeared in Neil LaBute&#x27;s &quot;The Shape of Things&quot; at the Almeida Theatre, then temporarily located in London&#x27;s King&#x27;s Cross, for which she received a Theatre World Award. CurtainUp called her &quot;a sophisticated, independent artist&quot; with &quot;great stage presence&quot;.

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, she portrayed Petula in the film &quot;Beautiful Creatures&quot;, followed by 2001&#x27;s &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot;, and the 2002 comedy-drama &quot;About a Boy&quot;, with Hugh Grant, based on Nick Hornby&#x27;s 1998 novel. In 2003, she played Marlee in the adaptation of John Grisham&#x27;s legal thriller novel &quot;The Runaway Jury&quot;; and starred in the film adaptation of the romantic comedy-drama play &quot;The Shape of Things&quot;.

In 2004, Weisz appeared in the comedy &quot;Envy&quot;. The film failed at the box office. &quot;Variety&quot; opined that Weisz and co-star Amy Poehler &quot;get fewer choice moments than they deserve.&quot; Her next role was alongside Keanu Reeves in &quot;Constantine&quot;, based on the comic book &quot;Hellblazer&quot;. &quot;Film Threat&quot; called her portrayal &quot;effective at projecting scepticism and, eventually, dawning horror&quot;.

Her next appearance, in 2005, was in Fernando Meirelles&#x27;s &quot;The Constant Gardener&quot;, a film adaptation of a John le Carré thriller set in the slums of Kibera and Loiyangalani, Kenya. Weisz played an activist, Tessa Quayle, married to a British embassy official. The film was critically acclaimed, earning Weisz the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress, and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role. UK newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that the film &quot;established her in the front rank of British actors&quot;, while the BBC wrote: &quot;Weisz is exceptional: film star charisma coupled with raw emotion in a performance to fall in love with&quot;. In 2006, she received the BAFTA Britannia Award for British Artist of the Year.

In 2006, Weisz starred in American filmmaker Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;The Fountain&quot;. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; found her portrayal of Queen Isabel &quot;less convincing&quot; than other roles. That same year, she provided the voice for Saphira the dragon in the fantasy film &quot;Eragon&quot;; and rejected an offer to star in &quot;The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor&quot; due to script issues. The part eventually went to Maria Bello. Her subsequent films include the 2007 Wong Kar-wai drama &quot;My Blueberry Nights&quot;, and Rian Johnson&#x27;s 2008 caper film &quot;The Brothers Bloom&quot;. In 2009, she played the lead role of Hypatia of Alexandria in the historical drama film &quot;Agora&quot;, a Spanish production directed by Alejandro Amenábar. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called her portrayal &quot;adept&quot;, noting that she imparted &quot;a sympathetic presence&quot;. That same year, she appeared as Blanche DuBois, in Rob Ashford&#x27;s revival of the play &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. Her performance in the play was praised by critics, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; noted that she &quot;rises to the challenge magnificently&quot;.

===2010s===
Weisz starred in the film &quot;The Whistleblower&quot;, which debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2010. The film was based on the true story of human trafficking by employees of contractor DynCorp. During its première, the intense depiction of the treatment meted out to victims by the kidnappers made a woman in the audience faint. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote &quot;Weisz&#x27;s performance holds the viewer every step of the way.&quot; That same year, she guest-starred in the animated series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, in the 22nd season episode &quot;How Munched is That Birdie in the Window?&quot;. Weisz&#x27;s 2011 roles included an adaptation of Terence Rattigan&#x27;s play &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot;, Fernando Meirelles&#x27; drama &quot;360&quot;, the BBC espionage thriller &quot;Page Eight&quot;, and the thriller film &quot;Dream House&quot;.

She filmed scenes for &quot;To the Wonder&quot;, a 2012 romantic drama film written and directed by Terrence Malick; her scenes were cut. She has starred in the 2012 action thriller film &quot;The Bourne Legacy&quot; based on the series of books by Robert Ludlum.

In 2013, Weisz starred on Broadway alongside her husband, Daniel Craig, in a revival of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Betrayal&quot;. It opened 27 October 2013, and closed 5 January 2014. Box office receipts of $17.5 million made it the second highest grossing Broadway play of 2013. That year, Weisz played Evanora in the fantasy film &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot;.

In 2015, she appeared in drama film &quot;Youth&quot; and in science fiction film &quot;The Lobster&quot;. The film won Cannes Jury Prize. In 2016, she appeared in the drama film &quot;The Light Between Oceans&quot;, and portrayed Holocaust historian Deborah Lipstadt in &quot;Denial&quot;, a film based on Lipstadt&#x27;s book, and directed by Mick Jackson.

In 2017 Weisz starred in &quot;My Cousin Rachel&quot;, a drama based on Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s novel, and in 2018 co-starred in a British biographical film about sailor Donald Crowhurst, &quot;The Mercy&quot;, directed by James Marsh.

Weisz&#x27;s production company, LC6 Productions, released its first feature film, &quot;Disobedience&quot;, in 2017, starring Weisz and Rachel McAdams. Weisz grew up three London Underground stops away from the Orthodox Jewish neighborhood where the film is set. Raised within Judaism, Weisz never fully connected to her ancestral religion. She claims she was &quot;really disobedient&quot; herself and has never felt she fits in anywhere.

In 2018, Weisz played Sarah Churchill in &quot;The Favourite&quot;, winning the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and receiving her second nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. In April 2019, she entered talks to join Scarlett Johansson in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Black Widow&quot;. In July of that year, Weisz was announced to play Melina Vostokoff in the film, which was released on 9 July 2021.

=== 2020s ===
Weisz starred in and executive produced the thriller miniseries &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, a remake of the 1988 film of the same name for Amazon Prime Video.
==Personal life==
In 2001, Weisz began dating the American filmmaker and producer, Darren Aronofsky. They met backstage at London&#x27;s Almeida Theatre, where she was starring in &quot;The Shape of Things&quot;. Weisz moved to New York City with Aronofsky the following year; in 2005, they were engaged. Their son was born in May 2006 in New York City. The couple resided in the East Village in Manhattan. &quot;Mohel&quot; Philip Sherman performed their son&#x27;s brit milah (bris). In November 2010, Weisz and Aronofsky announced that they had been apart for months, but remained close friends and were committed to bringing up their son together in New York.

Weisz and the English actor, Daniel Craig, were friends for many years and worked together on the 2011 film &quot;Dream House&quot;. They began dating in December 2010 and married on 22 June 2011 in a private New York ceremony, with four guests in attendance, including Weisz&#x27;s son and Craig&#x27;s daughter. On 1 September 2018, it was reported that they had their first child together, a daughter.

Weisz has been featured on the covers of magazines such as &quot;Vogue&quot;. She served as a muse to the fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez, and was named L&#x27;Oréal&#x27;s global ambassador in 2010. Weisz learned karate for her role in &quot;The Brothers Bloom&quot;.

<text>Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay, (; 25 October 1800 – 28 December 1859) was a British historian, poet, and Whig politician, who served as the Secretary at War between 1839 and 1841, and as the Paymaster General between 1846 and 1848. He also played a substantial role in determining India&#x27;s education policy.

Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;The History of England&quot;, which expressed his belief in the superiority of the Western European culture and of the inevitability of its sociopolitical progress, is a seminal example of Whig history commended for its prose style.

==Early life==
Macaulay was born at Rothley Temple in Leicestershire on 25 October 1800, the son of Zachary Macaulay, a Scottish Highlander, who became a colonial governor and abolitionist, and Selina Mills of Bristol, a former pupil of Hannah More. They named their first child after his uncle Thomas Babington, a Leicestershire landowner and politician, who had married Zachary&#x27;s sister Jean. The young Macaulay was noted as a child prodigy; as a toddler, gazing out of the window from his cot at the chimneys of a local factory, he is reputed to have asked his father whether the smoke came from the fires of hell.

He was educated at a private school in Hertfordshire, and, subsequently, at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he won several prizes, including the Chancellor&#x27;s Gold Medal in June 1821, and where he in 1825 published a prominent essay on Milton in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;. Macaulay did not study classical literature while at Cambridge, though he subsequently did when he was in India. In his letters he describes his reading of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; whilst he was in Malvern in 1851, and says he was moved to tears by Virgil&#x27;s poetry. He taught himself German, Dutch and Spanish, and was fluent in French. He studied law and in 1826 he was called to the bar, before he took more interest in a political career. Macaulay in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; in 1827, and in a series of anonymous letters to &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot;, censured the analysis of indentured labour by the British Colonial Office expert Colonel Thomas Moody, Kt. Macaulay&#x27;s evangelical Whig father Zachary Macaulay, who desired a &#x27;free black peasantry&#x27; rather than equality for Africans, also censured, in the &quot;Anti-Slavery Reporter&quot;, Moody&#x27;s contentions.

Macaulay, who did not marry nor have children, was rumoured to have fallen in love with Maria Kinnaird, who was the wealthy ward of Richard &#x27;Conversation&#x27; Sharp. Macaulay&#x27;s strongest emotional relationships were with his youngest sisters: Margaret, who died while he was in India, and Hannah, to whose daughter Margaret, whom he called &#x27;Baba&#x27;, he was also attached.

==India (1834–1838)==

Macaulay in 1830 accepted the invitation of the Marquess of Lansdowne that he become Member of Parliament for the pocket borough of Calne. Macaulay&#x27;s maiden speech in Parliament advocated abolition of the civil disabilities of the Jews in the UK. He extensively wrote that,
 Macaulay&#x27;s subsequent speeches in favour of parliamentary reform were commended. He became MP for Leeds subsequent to the 1833 enactment of the Reform Act 1832, by which Calne&#x27;s representation was reduced from two MPs to one, and by which Leeds, which had not been represented before, had two MPs. Macaulay remained grateful to his former patron, Lansdowne, who remained his friend.

Macaulay was Secretary to the Board of Control under Lord Grey from 1832 until he in 1833 required, as a consequence of the penury of his father, a more remunerative office, than that of the unremunerated office of an MP, from which he resigned after the passing of the Government of India Act 1833 to accept an appointment as first Law Member of the Governor-General&#x27;s Council. In 1834 Macaulay went to India, where he served on the Supreme Council between 1834 and 1838. 
His of February 1835 was primarily responsible for the introduction of Western institutional education to India.

Macaulay recommended the introduction of the English language as the official language of secondary education instruction in all schools where there had been none before, and the training of English-speaking Indians as teachers.
In his minute, he urged Lord William Bentinck, the then-Governor-General to reform secondary education on utilitarian lines to deliver &quot;useful learning&quot;, a phrase that to him was synonymous with Western culture. There was no tradition of secondary education in vernacular languages; the institutions supported by the East India Company taught either in Sanskrit or Persian. Hence, he argued, &quot;We have to educate a people who cannot at present be educated by means of their mother-tongue. We must teach them some foreign language.&quot; Macaulay argued that Sanskrit and Persian were no more accessible than English to the speakers of the Indian vernacular languages and existing Sanskrit and Persian texts were of little use for &quot;useful learning&quot;. In one of the less scathing passages of the Minute he :
I have no knowledge of either Sanskrit or Arabic. But I have done what I could to form a correct estimate of their value. I have read translations of the most celebrated Arabic and Sanskrit works. I have conversed both here and at home with men distinguished by their proficiency in the Eastern tongues. I am quite ready to take the Oriental learning at the valuation of the Orientalists
themselves. I have never found one among them who could deny that a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia.

He further :
It will hardly be disputed, I suppose, that the department of literature in which the Eastern writers stand highest is poetry. And I certainly never met with any orientalist who ventured to maintain that the Arabic and Sanskrit poetry could be compared to that of the great European nations. But when we pass from works of imagination to works in which facts are recorded and general principles investigated, the superiority of the Europeans becomes absolutely immeasurable. It is, I believe, no exaggeration to say that all the historical information which has been collected from all the books written in the Sanskrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the most paltry abridgments used at preparatory schools in England. In every branch of physical or moral philosophy, the relative position of the two nations is nearly the same.

Hence, from the sixth year of schooling onwards, instruction should be in European learning, with English as the medium of instruction. This would create a class of anglicised Indians who would serve as cultural intermediaries between the British and the Indians; the creation of such a class was necessary before any reform of vernacular education. He : I feel with them that it is impossible for us, with our limited means, to attempt to educate the body of the people. We must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern; a class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect. To that class we may leave it to refine the vernacular dialects of the country, to enrich those dialects with terms of science borrowed from the Western nomenclature, and to render them by degrees fit vehicles for conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population.

Macaulay&#x27;s largely coincided with Bentinck&#x27;s views and Bentinck&#x27;s English Education Act 1835 closely matched Macaulay&#x27;s recommendations (in 1836, a school named La Martinière, founded by Major General Claude Martin, had one of its houses named after him), but subsequent Governors-General took a more conciliatory approach to existing Indian education.

His final years in India were devoted to the creation of a Penal Code, as the leading member of the Law Commission. In the aftermath of the Indian Mutiny of 1857, Macaulay&#x27;s criminal law proposal was enacted. The Indian Penal Code in 1860 was followed by the Criminal Procedure Code in 1872 and the Civil Procedure Code in 1908. The Indian Penal Code inspired counterparts in most other British colonies, and to date many of these laws are still in effect in places as far apart as Pakistan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nigeria and Zimbabwe, as well as in India itself. This includes Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which remains the basis for laws which criminalize homosexuality in several Commonwealth nations.

In Indian culture, the term &quot;Macaulay&#x27;s Children&quot; is sometimes used to refer to people born of Indian ancestry who adopt Western culture as a lifestyle, or display attitudes influenced by colonialism (&quot;Macaulayism&quot;) – expressions used disparagingly, and with the implication of disloyalty to one&#x27;s country and one&#x27;s heritage. In independent India, Macaulay&#x27;s idea of the civilising mission has been used by Dalitists, in particular by neo-liberalist Chandra Bhan Prasad, as a &quot;creative appropriation for self-empowerment&quot;, based on the view that the Dalit community was empowered by Macaulay&#x27;s deprecation of Hindu culture and support for Western-style education in India.

Domenico Losurdo states that &quot;Macaulay acknowledged that the English colonists in India behaved like Spartans confronting &quot;helots&quot;: we are dealing with &#x27;a race of sovereign&#x27; or a &#x27;sovereign caste&#x27;, wielding absolute power over its &#x27;serfs&#x27;.&quot; Losurdo noted that this did not prompt any doubts from Macaulay over the right of Britain to administer its colonies in an autocratic fashion; for example, while Macaulay described the administration of governor-general of India Warren Hastings as being so despotic that &quot;all the injustice of former oppressors, Asiatic and European, appeared as a blessing&quot;, he (Hastings) deserved &quot;high admiration&quot; and a rank among &quot;the most remarkable men in our history&quot; for &quot;having saved England and civilisation&quot;.

===Return to British public life (1838–1857)===

Returning to Britain in 1838, he became MP again in Edinburgh in the following year. He was made Secretary at War in 1839 by Lord Melbourne and was sworn of the Privy Council the same year. In 1841 Macaulay addressed the issue of copyright law. Macaulay&#x27;s position, slightly modified, became the basis of copyright law in the English-speaking world for many decades. Macaulay argued that copyright is a monopoly and as such has generally negative effects on society. After the fall of Melbourne&#x27;s government in 1841 Macaulay devoted more time to literary work, and returned to office as Paymaster General in 1846 in Lord John Russell&#x27;s administration.

In the election of 1847 he lost his seat in Edinburgh. He attributed the loss to the anger of religious zealots over his speech in favour of expanding the annual government grant to Maynooth College in Ireland, which trained young men for the Catholic priesthood; some observers also attributed his loss to his neglect of local issues. In 1849 he was elected Rector of the University of Glasgow, a position with no administrative duties, often awarded by the students to men of political or literary fame. He also received the freedom of the city.

In 1852, the voters of Edinburgh offered to re-elect him to Parliament. He accepted on the express condition that he need not campaign and would not pledge himself to a position on any political issue. Remarkably, he was elected on those terms. He seldom attended the House due to ill health. His weakness after suffering a heart attack caused him to postpone for several months making his speech of thanks to the Edinburgh voters. He resigned his seat in January 1856. In 1857 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Macaulay, of Rothley in the County of Leicester, but seldom attended the House of Lords.

===Later life (1857–1859)===
Macaulay sat on the committee to decide on the historical subjects to be painted in the new Palace of Westminster. The need to collect reliable portraits of notable figures from history for this project led to the foundation of the National Portrait Gallery, which was formally established on 2 December 1856. Macaulay was amongst its founding trustees and is honoured with one of only three busts above the main entrance.

During his later years his health made work increasingly difficult for him. He died of a heart attack on 28 December 1859, aged 59, leaving his major work, &quot;The History of England from the Accession of James the Second&quot; incomplete. On 9 January 1860 he was buried in Westminster Abbey, in Poets&#x27; Corner, near a statue of Addison. As he had no children, his peerage became extinct on his death.

Macaulay&#x27;s nephew, Sir George Trevelyan, Bt, wrote the &quot;Life and Letters&quot; of his uncle. His great-nephew was the Cambridge historian G. M. Trevelyan.

==Literary works==
As a young man he composed the ballads &quot;Ivry&quot; and &quot;The Armada&quot;, which he later included as part of &quot;Lays of Ancient Rome&quot;, a series of very popular poems about heroic episodes in Roman history which he began composing in India and continued in Rome, finally publishing in 1842. The most famous of them, &quot;&quot;, concerns the heroism of Horatius Cocles. It contains the oft-quoted lines:

His essays, originally published in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, were collected as &quot;Critical and Historical Essays&quot; in 1843.

==Historian==
During the 1840s, Macaulay undertook his most famous work, &quot;The History of England from the Accession of James the Second&quot;, publishing the first two volumes in 1848. At first, he had planned to bring his history down to the reign of George III. After publication of his first two volumes, his hope was to complete his work with the death of Queen Anne in 1714.

The third and fourth volumes, bringing the history to the Peace of Ryswick, were published in 1855. At his death in 1859 he was working on the fifth volume. This, bringing the &quot;History&quot; down to the death of William III, was prepared for publication by his sister, Lady Trevelyan, after his death.

==Political writing==
Macaulay&#x27;s political writings are famous for their ringing prose and for their confident, sometimes dogmatic, emphasis on a progressive model of British history, according to which the country threw off superstition, autocracy and confusion to create a balanced constitution and a forward-looking culture combined with freedom of belief and expression. This model of human progress has been called the Whig interpretation of history. This philosophy appears most clearly in the essays Macaulay wrote for the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; and other publications, which were collected in book form and a steady best-seller throughout the 19th century. But it is also reflected in &quot;History&quot;; the most stirring passages in the work are those that describe the &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot; of 1688.

Macaulay&#x27;s approach has been criticised by later historians for its one-sidedness and its complacency. Karl Marx referred to him as a &#x27;systematic falsifier of history&#x27;. Later historians have also highlighted his views on non-European cultures and philosophies as explicitly racist, citing, for example, his remark that &#x27;a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia&#x27;. His tendency to see history as a drama led him to treat figures whose views he opposed as if they were villains, while characters he approved of were presented as heroes. Macaulay goes to considerable length, for example, to absolve his main hero William III of any responsibility for the Glencoe massacre. Winston Churchill devoted a of the Duke of Marlborough to rebutting Macaulay&#x27;s slights on his ancestor, expressing hope &quot;to fasten the label &#x27;Liar&#x27; to his genteel coat-tails&quot;.

==Legacy as a historian==
The Liberal historian Lord Acton read Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;History of England&quot; four times and later described himself as &quot;a raw English schoolboy, primed to the brim with Whig politics&quot; but &quot;not Whiggism only, but Macaulay in particular that I was so full of.&quot; However, after coming under German influence Acton would later find fault in Macaulay. In 1880 Acton classed Macaulay (with Burke and Gladstone) as one &quot;of the three greatest Liberals&quot;. In 1883, he advised Mary Gladstone:

In 1885, Acton asserted that: 

In 1888, Acton wrote that Macaulay &quot;had done more than any writer in the literature of the world for the propagation of the Liberal faith, and he was not only the greatest, but the most representative, Englishman then living&quot;.

W. S. Gilbert described Macaulay&#x27;s wit, &quot;who wrote of Queen Anne&quot; as part of Colonel Calverley&#x27;s Act I patter song in the libretto of the 1881 operetta &quot;Patience&quot;. (This line may well have been a joke about the Colonel&#x27;s pseudo-intellectual bragging, as most educated Victorians knew that Macaulay did &quot;not&quot; write of Queen Anne; the &quot;History&quot; encompasses only as far as the death of William III in 1702, who was succeeded by Anne.)

Herbert Butterfield&#x27;s &quot;The Whig Interpretation of History&quot; (1931) attacked Whig history. The Dutch historian Pieter Geyl, writing in 1955, considered Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot; as &quot;exclusively and intolerantly English&quot;.

On 7 February 1954, Lord Moran, doctor to the Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill, recorded in his diary: 

George Richard Potter, Professor and Head of the Department of History at the University of Sheffield from 1931 to 1965, stated &quot;In an age of long letters ... Macaulay&#x27;s hold their own with the best&quot;. However Potter also stated: 

With regards to Macaulay&#x27;s determination to inspect physically the places mentioned in his &quot;History&quot;, Potter said: 

Potter noted that Macaulay has had many critics, some of whom put forward some salient points about the deficiency of Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; but added: &quot;The severity and the minuteness of the criticism to which the &quot;History of England&quot; has been subjected is a measure of its permanent value. It is worth every ounce of powder and shot that is fired against it.&quot; Potter concluded that &quot;in the long roll of English historical writing from Clarendon to Trevelyan only Gibbon has surpassed him in security of reputation and certainty of immortality&quot;.

Piers Brendon wrote that Macaulay is &quot;the only British rival to Gibbon.&quot; In 1972, J. R. Western wrote that: &quot;Despite its age and blemishes, Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;History of England&quot; has still to be superseded by a full-scale modern history of the period.&quot; In 1974 J. P. Kenyon stated that: &quot;As is often the case, Macaulay had it exactly right.&quot;

W. A. Speck wrote in 1980, that a reason Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;History of England&quot; &quot;still commands respect is that it was based upon a prodigious amount of research&quot;. Speck stated: 

According to Speck: 

On the other hand, Speck also wrote that Macaulay &quot;took pains to present the virtues even of a rogue, and he painted the virtuous warts and all&quot;, and that &quot;he was never guilty of suppressing or distorting evidence to make it support a proposition which he knew to be untrue&quot;. Speck concluded: 

In 1981, J. W. Burrow argued that Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;History of England&quot;: 

In 1982, Gertrude Himmelfarb wrote: Himmelfarb also laments that &quot;the history of the &quot;History&quot; is a sad testimonial to the cultural regression of our times&quot;.

In the novel &quot;Marathon Man&quot; and its film adaptation, the protagonist was named &#x27;Thomas Babington&#x27; after Macaulay.

In 2008, Walter Olson argued for the pre-eminence of Macaulay as a British classical liberal.

<text>Eureka (often abbreviated as E!, or Σ!) is an intergovernmental organisation for research and development funding and coordination. Eureka is an open platform for international cooperation in innovation. Organisations and companies applying through Eureka programmes can access funding and support from national and regional ministries or agencies for their international R&amp;D projects.

, Eureka has 43 full members, including the European Union (represented by the European Commission) and four associated members (Argentina, Chile, South Africa, and Singapore). All 27 EU Member States are also members of Eureka.

Eureka is not an EU research programme, but rather an intergovernmental organisation of national ministries or agencies, of which the EU is a member. Cooperation and synergy are sought between Eureka and the research activities of the EU proper, such as with European Union&#x27;s Horizon 2020 and the European Research Area.

==History==

Founded in 1985 by prominent European political figures, Eureka has grown to one of the longest running European organisations dedicated to the financing of joint European R&amp;D projects.

===Foundation===

Eureka was established with the &quot;Paris Declaration&quot; of 17 July 1985, and its principles are based on the later Hannover Declaration, subscribed by Ministers on 5 November 1985. The two main founders were former head of states François Mitterrand (France) and Helmut Kohl (Germany). Other important personalities involved were Hubert Curien, French ex-Minister of research and former chairman of the European Space Agency and Jacques Attali, adviser to François Mitterrand.
Briefly, it is about assuring the technological independence of Europe in the key domains of the future; encouraging, wherever possible, co-operation between European businesses and researchers; mobilising the necessary financial resources; accompanying the efforts of our enterprises by creating the necessary environment and supporting the unification of our internal markets.

There are numerous obstacles. Once the initial idea of Eureka was formulated, we were able to foresee the difficulties to be faced. But we know that each time we come together — for example to address high-energy physics, research into nuclear fusion, the development of an integrated space programme or the construction of crucial scientific equipment — our successes encourage us in the idea that we can work together in R&amp;D areas close to industrial markets, despite the problems arising from the normal and legitimate competition between firms. 

==Structure==

===Chairs===

Before 1989, Eureka chairmanship changed hands every six months. Since then, the chairmanship rotates every 1 July, for a period of one year.

==Membership==

==Significant projects==

Eureka projects are numbered, preceded by &#x27;E! &#x27;.

* E! 45 helped to fund the Prometheus project for safer road vehicles, such as through autonomous driving with 745 million euros.
* E! 95 was a 730 million euros HDTV project, which created the HD-MAC standard for high definition television.
* E! 147 was a 93 million euros digital audio broadcasting project whose technologies went into Musicam, and which was used as the basis for MPEG-1 Layer II (MP2) and used in DAB (Digital Audio Broadcast), and ASPEC (Adaptive Spectral Perceptual Entropy Coding), which was used in a modified form in MP3 audio.
* E! 127 paid 3.8bn euros into the JESSI project (Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative) whose goal was to regain ground lost to Asia and the US in microchips.
* E! 2551 cost 6.1 million euros for the integration of existing CAD/CAM programs under a common user interface, part of which was paid to Vero Software.
* E! 3674 is Information Technology for European Advancement (ITEA2), an industry-driven cooperative R &amp; D programme for maintaining European leadership in software-intensive systems, with the project due to end in January 2014 having received 3.0bn euros. ITEA2 Projects notably include WellCom, OSAMI-E Open Source AMbient Intelligence) and Easy Interactions.
* E! 4986 AlienVault developed a security software called OSSIM (Open Source Security Information Management) that is now not only a reference in the field but also an essential component in modern cyber-wars. E! 4986 received 1.2 million euros.
* E! 3728 OMIM (MIMO) invented a new method of medical waste disposal. MIMO is safe for the environment and treats infectious waste by applying a combination of heat and pressure. This is an alternative to incineration methods that use fossil fuels. The project was an initiative between Spain, Portugal and Morocco. E! 3728 received 0.37 million euros.

== Programmes ==
The Eureka annual report describes the following programmes:

;Eurostars

&quot;Eurostars&quot; is Eureka&#x27;s flagship SME funding programme that supports R&amp;D-performing SMEs (alongside other types of organisations) leading international project consortia. It is co-funded by 36 participating Eureka national funding bodies and the European Union Horizon 2020 framework programme.

;Clusters

&quot;Clusters&quot; are long-term, strategically significant industrial initiatives. They usually have a large number of participants, and aim to develop inclusive technologies of importance for European competitiveness mainly in ICT, energy and more recently in the biotechnology and automation sectors. Eureka &quot;Clusters&quot; are known to have had a particular impact on the ability of the European microelectronics sector to compete with other continents.
Eureka &quot;Clusters&quot; are:
*CELTIC NEXT: Telecommunications
*EURIPIDES: Electronic packaging and smart systems
*ITEA 3: Software-intensive systems
*PENTA: Micro and nanoelectronics enabled systems and applications
*EUROGIA2020: Low-carbon energy technologies
*METALLURGY EUROPE: New metals 
*SMART: Advance manufacturing programme

;Network projects

&quot;Network projects&quot; is a flexible funding programme for all organisations collaborating on international R&amp;D projects. It is open for applications all year, but there are also country-specific calls for projects launched frequently. These are sometimes thematic and can be for bilateral or multilateral collaborations.

;Globalstars

&quot;Globalstars&quot; follows the same programme model as Network projects. Calls for projects are launched between Eureka countries and one non-Eureka country. In recent years, national funding ministries/ agencies from e.g. Brazil, India, Japan and Singapore have collaborated with Eureka using this programme.

;InvestHorizon

&quot;InvestHorizon&quot; is the only Eureka programme that doesn&#x27;t offer funding, but rather trainings, workshops and international events. It is a European Union-funded joint investment readiness programme in collaboration with Eureka that supports deep tech SMEs seeking Series A investment.

;Umbrellas

&quot;Umbrellas&quot; no longer exist as Eureka programmes. Umbrellas were thematic networks within the Eureka framework focusing on a specific technology area or business sector. The main goal of an &quot;umbrella&quot; was to facilitate the generation of Eureka projects in its own target area.

Past Eureka Umbrellas:
*Eureka Tourism (ended 30.06.2012)
*Eureka build 2 (2010–2013)
*EuroAgri Foodchain (2009–2013)
*Pro-Factory (2007–2011)
*E! SURF (2010–2015)
*Eniwep (ended 1.2.2010)
*Eulasnet II (ended 31.5.2010)
*Logchain + (ended 21.2.2011)
