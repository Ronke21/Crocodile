<text>Paul Victor Jules Signac ( , ; 11 November 1863 – 15 August 1935) was a French Neo-Impressionist painter who, with Georges Seurat, helped develop the artistic technique Pointillism.

== Biography ==

Paul-Victor-Jules Signac was born in Paris on 11 November 1863. His parents wanted him to study architecture but, as he said, his preference was to draw the Seine. He was particularly affected by an 1880 exhibition of Claude Monet&#x27;s work. Signac began boating.


In 1884 he met Claude Monet and Georges Seurat. He was struck by the systematic working methods of Seurat and by his theory of colors and he became Seurat&#x27;s faithful supporter, friend, and heir with his description of Neo-Impressionism and Divisionism method. Under Seurat&#x27;s influence he abandoned the short brushstrokes of Impressionism to experiment with scientifically-juxtaposed small dots of pure color, intended to combine and blend not on the canvas, but in the viewer&#x27;s eye, the defining feature of Pointillism.

The Mediterranean coast is a major theme across Signac&#x27;s paintings. He left the capital each summer, to stay in the south of France in the village of Collioure or at St. Tropez, where he bought a house and invited his friends. He envisioned the south of France as the perfect location for a future anarchist utopia.

Signac, Albert Dubois-Pillet, Odilon Redon, and Seurat were among the founders of the Société des Artistes Indépendants. The association began in Paris 29 July 1884 with the organization of massive exhibitions, embracing as their motto, &quot;Neither jury nor awards&quot; (&quot;Sans jury ni récompense&quot;). &quot;The purpose of Société des Artistes Indépendants—based on the principle of abolishing admission jury—is to allow the artists to present their works to public judgement with complete freedom&quot;. For the following three decades their annual exhibitions flourished and set the trends in art of the early twentieth century. Signac was a guiding force in the Société and was its President from 1908 until his death. 

In 1886 Signac met Vincent van Gogh in Paris. During 1887 the two artists regularly went to Asnières-sur-Seine together, where they painted such subjects as river landscapes and cafés. Initially, Van Gogh chiefly admired Signac&#x27;s loose painting technique. Signac would also meet Toulouse Lautrec who was a friend of Van Gogh.

In March 1889, Signac visited Van Gogh at Arles. In 1890, during the banquet of the XX exhibition in Brussels, Lautrec challenged to a duel the artist Henri de Groux who criticized Van Gogh&#x27;s works. Signac declared he would continue to fight for Van Gogh’s honor if Lautrec was killed. De Groux apologized for the slight and left the group and the duel never took place.

The next year he made a short trip to Italy, seeing Genoa, Florence, and Naples.

In 1888, Signac discovered anarchist ideas by reading Élisée Reclus, Kropotkin, and Jean Grave, who all developed the ideas of anarchist communism. With his friends Angrand Cross, Maximilien Luce, and Camille Pissarro he contributed to Jean Grave&#x27;s paper, &quot;Les Temps Nouveaux&quot; (New Times).

In 1892, he sailed the Garonne River southeast in France to the Mediterranean Sea, spending time in Saint-Tropez.

Signac experimented with various media. As well as oil paintings and watercolors he made etchings, lithographs, and many pen-and-ink sketches composed of small, laborious dots.

The Neo-Impressionists influenced the next generation: Signac inspired Henri Matisse and André Derain in particular, thus playing a decisive role in the evolution of Fauvism. Signac himself did not admire the style when it first appeared.

Having prospered well, his financial support of the arts was considerable. As donations, he sent regular cheques and made a gift of his works for five lotteries between 1895 and 1912. Signac&#x27;s 1893 painting, &quot;In the Time of Harmony&quot; originally was entitled, &quot;In the Time of Anarchy&quot;, but political repression targeting the anarchists in France at this time forced him to change the title before the work could be accepted by a gallery.

At the 1905 Salon des Indépendants, Henri Matisse exhibited the proto-Fauve painting &quot;Luxe, Calme et Volupté&quot;. The brightly colored composition was painted in 1904 after a summer spent working in St. Tropez on the French Riviera alongside the neo-Impressionist painters Henri-Edmond Cross and Paul Signac. The painting is Matisse&#x27;s most important work in which he used the Divisionist technique advocated by Signac, which Matisse had adopted in 1898 after reading Signac&#x27;s essay, &quot;d&#x27;Eugène Delacroix au Néo-Impressionnisme&quot;. Signac purchased the work after the 1905 Salon des Indépendants. In 1908 Signac was elected president of the Twenty-fourth Salon des Indépendants.

As president of the Société des Artistes Indépendants, from 1908 until his death, Signac encouraged younger artists by exhibiting the controversial works of the Fauves and the Cubists. He was the first patron to buy a painting by Matisse.

Signac served as a juror with Florence Meyer Blumenthal in awarding the &quot;Prix Blumenthal&quot;, a grant given between 1919 and 1954 to painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians.

== Personal life ==
On 7 November 1892, Signac married Berthe Roblès at the town hall of the 18th arrondissement of Paris. The witnesses at the wedding were Alexandre Lemonier, Maximilien Luce, Camille Pissarro, and Georges Lecomte.

In November 1897, the Signacs moved to a new apartment in the &quot;Castel Béranger&quot;, which was built by Hector Guimard. A little later, in December of the same year, they acquired a house in Saint-Tropez named, &quot;La Hune&quot;, where the painter had a vast studio constructed that he inaugurated on 16 August 1898.

In September 1913, Signac rented a house at Antibes, where he took up residence with Jeanne Selmersheim-Desgrange. She gave birth to their daughter, Ginette, on 2 October 1913. Meanwhile, Signac left &quot;La Hune&quot; and the &quot;Castel Beranger&quot; apartment to Berthe and they remained friends for the rest of his life. On 6 April 1927, Signac formally adopted Ginette. His granddaughter, Françoise Cachin, was an art historian.

Paul Signac died from sepsis in Paris on 15 August 1935 at the age of 71. His body was cremated and was interred three days later, on 18 August, at the Père Lachaise Cemetery.

== Author ==
Signac wrote several important works on the theory of art, among them, &quot;From Eugène Delacroix to Neo-Impressionism&quot;, first published in serial form in 1898. It is an important history of color and explanation of neo-impressionist technique. It also discusses Johan Barthold Jongkind (1819–1891). Signac also authored several introductions to the catalogues of art exhibitions and many other writings yet to be published.

Politically, he was an anarchist, as were many of his friends, including Félix Fénéon and Camille Pissarro.

<text>Sfumato ( , ; , i.e. &#x27;blurred&#x27;) is a painting technique for softening the transition between colours, mimicking an area beyond what the human eye is focusing on, or the out-of-focus plane. It is one of the canonical painting modes of the Renaissance. Leonardo da Vinci was the most prominent practitioner of sfumato, based on his research in optics and human vision, and his experimentation with the camera obscura. He introduced it and implemented it in many of his works, including the &quot;Virgin of the Rocks&quot; and in his famous painting of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;. He described sfumato as &quot;without lines or borders, in the manner of smoke&quot;.

According to the theory of the art historian Marcia B. Hall, which has gained considerable acceptance, &quot;sfumato&quot; is one of four modes of painting colours available to Italian High Renaissance painters, along with cangiante, chiaroscuro, and unione.

== Technique ==
The technique is a fine shading meant to produce a soft transition between colours and tones, in order to achieve a more believable image. It is most often used by making subtle gradations that do not include lines or borders, from areas of light to areas of dark. The technique was used not only to give an elusive and illusionistic rendering of the human face, but also to create rich atmospheric effects. Leonardo da Vinci described the technique as blending colours, without the use of lines or borders &quot;in the manner of smoke&quot;.
==Practitioners==
Besides Leonardo and his followers, the Leonardeschi, who often used it heavily, other prominent practitioners of sfumato included Correggio, Raphael, and Giorgione. Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Madonna of the Meadow&quot; is a famous example, particularly around Mary&#x27;s face. The Leonardeschi include Bernardino Luini and Funisi. Giorgione&#x27;s The Three Philosophers is said to use sfumato.

<text>Benjamin D&#x27;Israeli (1730–1816) was an Italian-born English merchant and financier, the grandfather of the British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield.

D&#x27;Israeli was born in Cento, near Ferrara, then in the Papal States, now part of the Italian Republic, on 22 September 1730; and died at Stoke Newington, Middlesex, on 28 November 1816. He moved to England in 1748 and settled there as a merchant, although he did not take out papers of denization till 1801.

Although a conforming Jew, and though contributing liberally towards the support of a synagogue, D&#x27;Israeli appears never to have cordially or intimately mixed with the community; only on one occasion did he serve in a minor office—that of inspector of charity schools in the year 1782.

D&#x27;Israeli married twice. Firstly, on 2 April 1756, he married Rebecca Mendez Furtado, a woman of Portuguese origin. They had a daughter called Rachel. Within a few months of Rebecca&#x27;s death on 1 February 1765 he married secondly Sarah Siprut de Gabay Villareal, on 28 May 1765. Their only child Isaac D&#x27;Israeli was born the next year, on 11 May 1766.

== Life ==
D&#x27;Israeli was born in Cento (in present-day Italy), near Ferrara, then part of the Papal States, on 22 September 1730, the son of Isaac Israeli. His family were of Sephardic Jewish (Italian-Jewish) descent.

He was the eldest of three children. The other two were daughters, Rachel, born in 1741, and Venturina, born in 1745.
Although his grandson later wrote of the family&#x27;s roots in the Republic of Venice, it seems the family&#x27;s only connection with that city was through these sisters, for the only records of the family in the archives of the Venetian Ghetto are of Venturina&#x27;s death there in 1821 and of the death of Rachel in the register for 1837.
Lord Beaconsfield, in the Memoir of his father, speaks of an elder brother of Benjamin, who was a banker in Venice and a friend of Sir Horace Mann, but according to Wolf (1902) this must be a mistake, for apart from the absence of any record of this brother, and of any mention of him in the minute and copious correspondence of Mann, the fact that Rachel and Venturina Israeli kept a girls&#x27; school in the Ghetto makes it very unlikely that they had a banker brother.

Of Isaac Israeli is noteworthy that he bore a name honoured in Jewry and that he married into a family of great antiquity and of considerable renown in Ferrara. He or his ancestors probably came from the Levant, where the Arabic name-form &quot;Israeli&quot; would find an environment more favourable to its survival than in Western Europe, where the Israelis of Toledo had long before assimilated themselves to the native Israels. It is not unlikely (according to Wolf), in view of the rarity of his patronymic, that he was of the family of the famous philosopher and court physician Ishac ibn Sulaiman El Israeli of Kairouan, who flourished in the tenth century, but this can only be conjectured. His wife, Rica or Eurichetta Rossi, was, however, unquestionably of the ancient family of Min-Haadumin, which traced its origin to one of the Jews led into captivity after the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus and Vespasian, and, at a later date, translated its Hebrew name into its literal Italian equivalent, &quot;Dei Rossi&quot;. The Min-Haadumin were numerous in Ferrara, where Isaac Israeli spent his life, and it was in the capital of the former duchy that the most illustrious of the clan, Azaria dei Rossi, practised as a physician and wrote his remarkable Cyclopædia of Bible Criticism, &quot;Meor Enayim&quot;, in the latter half of the sixteenth century.

After a short apprenticeship in Modena, Isaac Israeli&#x27;s son Benjamin emigrated to England in his eighteenth year. A strong impulse had been given to Anglo-Italian trade through the establishment, in 1740, of a branch of the great Venetian and Levantine banking house of Treves in London, and consequently Italians, chiefly Italian Jews, were flocking into the country. From letters preserved by one of Benjamin Israeli&#x27;s great-grandchildren, it is clear that the attraction which brought him to these shores had much less to do with the stability of the dynasty in Great Britain, by which Lord Beaconsfield has characteristically accounted for his migration, than with a humdrum, but entirely creditable, desire to find the best market for his knowledge of the straw bonnet trade. Moses Chaim Montefiore, the grandfather of Sir Moses Montefiore, also came to the country at much the same time for precisely the same reason. In both cases the prescience of the emigrants was justified, for a few years later, owing to the patronage of Maria and Elizabeth the &quot;beautiful Misses Gunning&quot;, Italian straw bonnets associated with Livorno (&quot;Leghorn&quot;) became the height of fashion.

At first D&#x27;Israeli was employed at a moderate salary in the counting-house of Messrs. Joseph and Pellegrin Treves in Fenchurch Street. Here he made the acquaintance of Mr. Aaron Lara, a friend of the principals, and a prosperous City broker, who thought sufficiently well of him to introduce him to his family. In 1756 he married Aaron Lara&#x27;s sister-in-law, Rebecca Mendes Furtado. She was the second daughter and fourth child of Gaspar Mendes Furtado (Portugal, Fundão, near 1695) and Clara Henriques de Lara, and was three years older than her husband.

On his marriage with Rebecca Mendes Furtado, D&#x27;Israeli left the Messrs. Treves and established himself in New Broad Street as an Italian merchant, importing straw hats, marble, alum, currants, and similar merchandise. He soon found this occupation pall upon what his grandson calls his &quot;ardent temperament&quot;, and in 1759 he obtained for himself an address at Sam&#x27;s Coffee House, and devoted a large portion of his time to the more exciting operations of &#x27;Change Alley. With capital, credit, and experience alike limited, it was not difficult to tell whither this was likely to lead. Within a few months he found himself in serious difficulties and beset with litigation. He resumed business, however, but with indifferent success, and, after struggling on for five more years, he suffered a further affliction in the loss of his wife.

His fortunes were repaired by his second marriage, which took place in May 1765. The bride was Sarah Shiprut de Gabay Villareal, younger daughter of a prosperous city merchant, Isaac Syprut, whose mother had been a Villareal, and whose wife, Esther, was sister-in-law to Simon Calimani, then Chief Rabbi of Venice.

The relationship must also have proved very useful to him in the City. At any rate, he soon became a man of substance. For ten years he prudently devoted himself to his import business, which he carried on at No. 5 Great St. Helens. In 1769 the business was also one of the sixteen leading coral merchants in London, an activity also closely connected with Treves bank, and Livorno. There also he established his private abode, until in 1783 he leased a large house in Baker Street, Enfield. The Stock Market, however, never ceased to attract him, and in 1776 he rented an office in Hamlin&#x27;s Alley, Cornhill, and recommenced business there as an unlicensed broker. Three years later he took to himself two partners, and the firm became known as Messrs. D&#x27;Israeli, Stoke &amp; Parkins. At the same time he continued his business at Great St. Helens, which was afterwards transferred to Little Winchester Street, and, in 1792, to Old Broad Street. His success is attested by the fact that the more respectable of the brokers, who had already organised the beginnings of the present Stock Exchange at New Jonathan&#x27;s Coffee House, admitted him to their body, and afterwards elected him a member of their Committee for General Purposes. When, in 1801, it was resolved to build new premises at Capel Court (where the Stock Exchange remained until 1972), Mr. D&#x27;Israeli was appointed a member of the committee entrusted with the plan of conversion. He remained a member of the Stock Exchange until 1803, when he retired from business; but to the day of his death he retained an address at Tom&#x27;s Coffee House, and was often seen in Cornhill, dabbling in stocks and shares.

One of the most notable enterprises with which he was associated was an attempt to substitute English straw-plaiting for the finer Italian straws then used for the best hats and bonnets. He patented a process by which &quot;a wood which is the growth of this kingdom&quot; was to be so treated as to yield a plait in every way equal to the Leghorn straws. The enterprise does not seem to have proved successful.

D&#x27;Israeli died in November 1816 at his house at 7 Church Row (which became Church Street), Stoke Newington, and was attended on his deathbed by a noted physician, Dr. John Aikin, who happened to be his neighbour. He left a fortune valued at £35,000 (equivalent to £ million in ).

<doc id="165450" wikidata="Q149072" url="?curid=165450" title="Phytophthora infestans">
<text>Phytophthora infestans is an oomycete or water mold, a fungus-like microorganism that causes the serious potato and tomato disease known as late blight or potato blight. Early blight, caused by &quot;Alternaria solani&quot;, is also often called &quot;potato blight&quot;. Late blight was a major culprit in the 1840s European, the 1845–1852 Irish, and the 1846 Highland potato famines. The organism can also infect some other members of the Solanaceae. The pathogen is favored by moist, cool environments: sporulation is optimal at in water-saturated or nearly saturated environments, and zoospore production is favored at temperatures below . Lesion growth rates are typically optimal at a slightly warmer temperature range of .

==Etymology==
The genus name &quot;Phytophthora&quot; comes from the Greek (), meaning &quot;plant&quot; – plus the Greek (), meaning &quot;decay, ruin, perish&quot;. The species name &quot;infestans&quot; is the present participle of the Latin verb , meaning &quot;attacking, destroying&quot;, from which the word &quot;to infest&quot; is derived. The name &quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot; was coined in 1876 by the German mycologist Heinrich Anton de Bary (1831–1888).

==Life cycle, signs and symptoms==

The asexual life cycle of &quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot; is characterized by alternating phases of hyphal growth, sporulation, sporangia germination (either through zoospore release or direct germination, i.e. germ tube emergence from the sporangium), and the re-establishment of hyphal growth. There is also a sexual cycle, which occurs when isolates of opposite mating type (A1 and A2, see below) meet. Hormonal communication triggers the formation of the sexual spores, called oospores. The different types of spores play major roles in the dissemination and survival of &quot;P. infestans.&quot; Sporangia are spread by wind or water and enable the movement of &quot;P. infestans&quot; between different host plants. The zoospores released from sporangia are biflagellated and chemotactic, allowing further movement of &quot;P. infestans&quot; on water films found on leaves or soils. Both sporangia and zoospores are short-lived, in contrast to oospores which can persist in a viable form for many years.

People can observe &quot;P. infestans&quot; produce dark green, then brown then black spots on the surface of potato leaves and stems, often near the tips or edges, where water or dew collects. The sporangia and sporangiophores appear white on the lower surface of the foliage. As for tuber blight, the white mycelium often shows on the tubers&#x27; surface.

Under ideal conditions, &quot;P. infestans&quot; completes its life cycle on potato or tomato foliage in about five days. Sporangia develop on the leaves, spreading through the crop when temperatures are above and humidity is over 75–80% for 2 days or more. Rain can wash spores into the soil where they infect young tubers, and the spores can also travel long distances on the wind. The early stages of blight are easily missed. Symptoms include the appearance of dark blotches on leaf tips and plant stems. White mold will appear under the leaves in humid conditions and the whole plant may quickly collapse. Infected tubers develop grey or dark patches that are reddish brown beneath the skin, and quickly decay to a foul-smelling mush caused by the infestation of secondary soft bacterial rots. Seemingly healthy tubers may rot later when in store.

&quot;P. infestans&quot; survives poorly in nature apart from on its plant hosts. Under most conditions, the hyphae and asexual sporangia can survive for only brief periods in plant debris or soil, and are generally killed off during frosts or very warm weather. The exceptions involve oospores, and hyphae present within tubers. The persistence of viable pathogen within tubers, such as those that are left in the ground after the previous year&#x27;s harvest or left in cull piles is a major problem in disease management. In particular, volunteer plants sprouting from infected tubers are thought to be a major source of inoculum (or propagules) at the start of a growing season. This can have devastating effects by destroying entire crops.

===Mating types===
The mating types are broadly divided into A1 and A2. Until the 1980s populations could only be distinguished by virulence assays and mating types, but since then more detailed analysis has shown that mating type and genotype are substantially decoupled. These types each produce a mating hormone of their own. Pathogen populations are grouped into clonal lineages of these mating types and includes:

====A1====
A1 produces a mating hormone, a diterpene α1. Clonal lineages of A1 include:
* CN-1, -2, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8 – mtDNA haplotype Ia, China in 1996–97

====Self-fertile====
A self-fertile type was present in China between 2009 and 2013.

==Physiology==
 is the in &quot;P. infestans&quot;. Hosts respond with autophagy upon detection of this elicitor, Liu et al. 2005 finding this to be the only alternative to mass hypersensitivity leading to mass programmed cell death.

==Genetics==
&quot;P. infestans&quot; is diploid, with about 8–10 chromosomes, and in 2009 scientists completed the sequencing of its genome. The genome was found to be considerably larger (240 Mbp) than that of most other &quot;Phytophthora&quot; species whose genomes have been sequenced; &quot;P. sojae&quot; has a 95 Mbp genome and &quot;P. ramorum&quot; had a 65 Mbp genome. About 18,000 genes were detected within the &quot;P. infestans&quot; genome. It also contained a diverse variety of transposons and many gene families encoding for effector proteins that are involved in causing pathogenicity. These proteins are split into two main groups depending on whether they are produced by the water mold in the symplast (inside plant cells) or in the apoplast (between plant cells). Proteins produced in the symplast included RXLR proteins, which contain an arginine-X-leucine-arginine (where X can be any amino acid) sequence at the amino terminus of the protein. Some RXLR proteins are avirulence proteins, meaning that they can be detected by the plant and lead to a hypersensitive response which restricts the growth of the pathogen. &quot;P. infestans&quot; was found to encode around 60% more of these proteins than most other &quot;Phytophthora&quot; species. Those found in the apoplast include hydrolytic enzymes such as proteases, lipases and glycosylases that act to degrade plant tissue, enzyme inhibitors to protect against host defence enzymes and necrotizing toxins. Overall the genome was found to have an extremely high repeat content (around 74%) and to have an unusual gene distribution in that some areas contain many genes whereas others contain very few.

The pathogen shows high allelic diversity in many isolates collected in Europe. This may be due to widespread trisomy or polyploidy in those populations.

== Research ==
Study of &quot;P. infestans&quot; presents sampling difficulties in the United States. It occurs only sporadically and usually has significant founder effects due to each epidemic starting from introduction of a single genotype.

==Origin and diversity==

The highlands of central Mexico were considered to be the center of origin of &quot;P. infestans&quot;, although others have proposed its origin to be in the Andes, which is also the origin of potatoes. A study published in 2014 evaluated these two alternate hypotheses and found conclusive support for central Mexico being the center of origin. However, their study did not include either an extensive global sampling of &quot;P. infestans&quot; or historic genomes. Support for a Mexican orgin specifically the Toluca Valley came from multiple observations including the fact that populations are genetically most diverse in Mexico, late blight is observed in native tuber-bearing &quot;Solanum&quot; species, populations of the pathogen are in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, the two mating (see § Mating types above) types occur in a 1:1 ratio, and detailed phylogeographic and evolutionary studies. For instance, while sexual recombination is regarded as evidence for a Mexican origin, &quot;P. infestans&quot; is mostly asexual and does not widely engage in sexual reproduction, despite the migration of the A2 mating type into Europe. Furthermore, the sister lineages of &quot;P. infestans&quot;, namely &quot;P. mirabilis&quot; and &quot;P. ipomoeae&quot; are endemic to central Mexico. 

Others have proposed an Andean origin for &quot;Phytophthora infestans.&quot; In 2002, Ristaino assessed the evidence for both the Mexican and South American origin hypotheses [24]. She pointed to the absence of potato exports during the 1840s, which posed a challenge to the notion of a Mexican origin for the blight&#x27;s migration to the US and Europe [24]. Furthermore, historical accounts of a similar disease in the Andean region and the presence of the cosmopolitan US-1 lineage in South America since at least the 1980s (yet absent in Mexico) were invoked by Ristaino, potentially supporting the idea of a South American origin [24]. In 2016, the Ristaino lab with collaborators Mike Martin and Tom Gilbert, at the University of Copenhagen, conducted the largest whole genome sequencing project to date with historic and modern day lineages of &quot;P infestans&quot; (25). Analysis of these  more extensive genomic dataset that included both &quot;P. infestans&quot; and &quot;P. andina&quot; isolates documented an  Andean origin of the species [25]. Lineages of Andean origin were found to be more closely related to historical &quot;P. infestans&quot; lineages from the famine era, implying an Andean origin with later subsequent migration and diversification occurring in Mexican lineages [25]. Significant admixture between the historic &quot;P infestans&quot; and &quot;P andina&quot; was also documented [25]. Several close relatives of P infestans have been found inthe Andes in South America, including &quot;P. andina&quot;,P urerae and P betacei. 

Coomber et al., examined the evolutionary history of &quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot; and its close relatives in the 1c clade using whole genome sequence data from 69 isolates of &quot;Phytophthora&quot; species in the 1c clade and conducted a range of genomic analyses including nucleotide diversity evaluation, maximum likelihood trees, network assessment, time to most recent common ancestor and migration analysis [26}. They consistently identified distinct and later divergence of the two Mexican &quot;Phytophthora&quot; species, &quot;P. mirabilis&quot; and &quot;P. ipomoeae&quot;, from &quot;P. infestans&quot; and other 1c clade species. &quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot; exhibited more recent divergence from other 1c clade species of &quot;Phytophthora&quot; from South America, &quot;P. andina&quot; and &quot;P. betacei&quot;. Speciation in the 1c clade and evolution of &quot;P. infestans&quot; occurred in the Andes. &quot;P. andina – P. betacei – P. infestans&quot; formed a species complex with indistinct species boundaries, hybridizations between the species, and short times to common ancestry. Furthermore, the distinction between modern Mexican and South American &quot;P. infestans&quot; proved less discrete, suggesting gene flow between populations over time. Admixture analysis indicated a complex relationship among these populations, hinting at potential gene flow across these regions. Historic &quot;P. infestans,&quot; collected from 1845-1889 from herbarium collections, were the first to diverge from all other &quot;P. infestans&quot; populations. Modern South American populations diverged next followed by Mexican populations which showed later ancestry. Both populations were derived from  historic &quot;P. infestans&quot;. Based on the time of divergence of &quot;P. infestans&quot; from its closest relatives, &quot;P. andina&quot; and &quot;P. betacei&quot; in the Andean region, the data support the Andes as the center of origin of &quot;P. infestans&quot;, with modern globalization contributing to admixture between &quot;P. infestans&quot; populations today from Mexico, the Andes and Europe [26]. 

Migrations from Mexico to North America or Europe have occurred several times throughout history, probably linked to the movement of tubers. Until the 1970s, the A2 mating type was restricted to Mexico, but now in many regions of the world both A1 and A2 isolates can be found in the same region. The co-occurrence of the two mating types is significant due to the possibility of sexual recombination and formation of oospores, which can survive the winter. Only in Mexico and Scandinavia, however, is oospore formation thought to play a role in overwintering. In other parts of Europe, increasing genetic diversity has been observed as a consequence of sexual reproduction. This is notable since different forms of &quot;P. infestans&quot; vary in their aggressiveness on potato or tomato, in sporulation rate, and sensitivity to fungicides. Variation in such traits also occurs in North America, however importation of new genotypes from Mexico appears to be the predominant cause of genetic diversity, as opposed to sexual recombination within potato or tomato fields. In 1976 – due to a summer drought in Europe – there was a potato production shortfall and so eating potatoes were imported to fill the shortfall. It is thought that this was the vehicle for mating type A2 to reach the rest of the world. In any case, there had been little diversity, consisting of the US-1 strain, and of that only one type of: mating type, mtDNA, restriction fragment length polymorphism, and di-locus isozyme. Then in 1980 suddenly greater diversity and A2 appeared in Europe. In 1981 it was found in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, 1985 in Sweden, the early 1990s in Norway and Finland, 1996 in Denmark, and 1999 in Iceland. In the UK new A1 lineages only replaced the old lineage by end of the &#x27;80s, and A2 spread even more slowly, with Britain having low levels and Ireland (north and Republic) having none-to-trace detections through the &#x27;90s. Many of the strains that appeared outside of Mexico since the 1980s have been more aggressive, leading to increased crop losses. In Europe since 2013 the populations have been tracked by the EuroBlight network (see links below). Some of the differences between strains may be related to variation in the RXLR effectors that are present.

==Disease management==

&quot;P. infestans&quot; is still a difficult disease to control. There are many chemical options in agriculture for the control of damage to the foliage as well as the fruit (for tomatoes) and the tuber (for potatoes). A few of the most common foliar-applied fungicides are Ridomil, a Gavel/SuperTin tank mix, and Previcur Flex. All of the aforementioned fungicides need to be tank mixed with a broad-spectrum fungicide, such as mancozeb or chlorothalonil, not just for resistance management but also because the potato plants will be attacked by other pathogens at the same time.

If adequate field scouting occurs and late blight is found soon after disease development, localized patches of potato plants can be killed with a desiccant (e.g. paraquat) through the use of a backpack sprayer. This management technique can be thought of as a field-scale hypersensitive response similar to what occurs in some plant-viral interactions whereby cells surrounding the initial point of infection are killed in order to prevent proliferation of the pathogen.

If infected tubers make it into a storage bin, there is a very high risk to the storage life of the entire bin. Once in storage, there is not much that can be done besides emptying the parts of the bin that contain tubers infected with &quot;Phytophthora infestans.&quot; To increase the probability of successfully storing potatoes from a field where late blight was known to occur during the growing season, some products can be applied just prior to entering storage (e.g., Phostrol).

Around the world the disease causes around $6 billion of damage to crops each year.

===Resistant plants===

Breeding for resistance, particularly in potato plants, has had limited success in part due to difficulties in crossing cultivated potato with its wild relatives, which are the source of potential resistance genes. In addition, most resistance genes work only against a subset of &quot;P. infestans&quot; isolates, since effective plant disease resistance results only when the pathogen expresses a RXLR effector gene that matches the corresponding plant resistance (R) gene; effector-R gene interactions trigger a range of plant defenses, such as the production of compounds toxic to the pathogen.

Potato and tomato varieties vary in their susceptibility to blight. Most early varieties are very vulnerable; they should be planted early so that the crop matures before blight starts (usually in July in the Northern Hemisphere). Many old crop varieties, such as King Edward potato, are also very susceptible but are grown because they are wanted commercially. Maincrop varieties which are very slow to develop blight include Cara, Stirling, Teena, Torridon, Remarka, and Romano. Some so-called resistant varieties can resist some strains of blight and not others, so their performance may vary depending on which are around. These crops have had polygenic resistance bred into them, and are known as &quot;field resistant&quot;. New varieties, such as Sarpo Mira and Sarpo Axona, show great resistance to blight even in areas of heavy infestation. Defender is an American cultivar whose parentage includes Ranger Russet and Polish potatoes resistant to late blight. It is a long white-skinned cultivar with both foliar and tuber resistance to late blight. Defender was released in 2004.

Genetic engineering may also provide options for generating resistance cultivars. A resistance gene effective against most known strains of blight has been identified from a wild relative of the potato, &quot;Solanum bulbocastanum&quot;, and introduced by genetic engineering into cultivated varieties of potato. This is an example of cisgenic genetic engineering.

Melatonin in the plant/&quot;P. infestans&quot; co-environment reduces the stress tolerance of the parasite.

===Reducing inoculum===
Blight can be controlled by limiting the source of . Only good-quality seed potatoes and tomatoes obtained from certified suppliers should be planted. Often discarded potatoes from the previous season and self-sown tubers can act as sources of inoculum.

Compost, soil or potting medium can be heat-treated to kill oomycetes such as &quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot;. The recommended sterilisation temperature for oomycetes is for 30 minutes.

===Environmental conditions===
There are several environmental conditions that are conducive to &quot;P. infestans&quot;. An example of such took place in the United States during the 2009 growing season. As colder than average for the season and with greater than average rainfall, there was a major infestation of tomato plants, specifically in the eastern states. By using weather forecasting systems, such as BLITECAST, if the following conditions occur as the canopy of the crop closes, then the use of fungicides is recommended to prevent an epidemic.
* A is a period of 48 consecutive hours, in at least 46 of which the hourly readings of temperature and relative humidity at a given place have not been less than and 75%, respectively.
* A is at least two consecutive days where min temperature is or above and on each day at least 11 hours when the relative humidity is greater than 90%.
The Beaumont and Smith periods have traditionally been used by growers in the United Kingdom, with different criteria developed by growers in other regions. The Smith period has been the preferred system used in the UK since its introduction in the 1970s.

Based on these conditions and other factors, several tools have been developed to help growers manage the disease and plan fungicide applications. Often these are deployed as part of decision support systems accessible through web sites or smart phones.

Several studies have attempted to develop systems for real-time detection via flow cytometry or microscopy of airborne sporangia collected in air samplers. Whilst these methods show potential to allow detection of sporangia in advance of occurrence of detectable disease symptoms on plants, and would thus be useful in enhancing existing decision support systems, none have been commercially deployed to date.

===Use of fungicides===

Fungicides for the control of potato blight are normally used only in a preventative manner, optionally in with disease forecasting. In susceptible varieties, sometimes fungicide applications may be needed weekly. An early spray is most effective. The choice of fungicide can depend on the nature of local strains of &quot;P. infestans&quot;. Metalaxyl is a fungicide that was marketed for use against &quot;P. infestans&quot;, but suffered serious resistance issues when used on its own. In some regions of the world during the 1980s and 1990s, most strains of &quot;P. infestans&quot; became resistant to metalaxyl, but in subsequent years many populations shifted back to sensitivity. To reduce the occurrence of resistance, it is strongly advised to use single-target fungicides such as metalaxyl along with carbamate compounds. A combination of other compounds are recommended for managing metalaxyl-resistant strains. These include mandipropamid, chlorothalonil, fluazinam, triphenyltin, mancozeb, and others. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency has approved oxathiapiprolin for use against late blight. In African smallholder production fungicide application can be necessary up to once every three days.

====In organic production====

In the past, copper(II) sulfate solution (called &#x27;bluestone&#x27;) was used to combat potato blight. Copper pesticides remain in use on organic crops, both in the form of copper hydroxide and copper sulfate. Given the dangers of copper toxicity, other organic control options that have been shown to be effective include horticultural oils, phosphorous acids, and rhamnolipid biosurfactants, while sprays containing &quot;beneficial&quot; microbes such as &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; or compounds that encourage the plant to produce defensive chemicals (such as knotweed extract) have not performed as well.
During the crop year 2008, many of the certified organic potatoes produced in the United Kingdom and certified by the Soil Association as organic were sprayed with a copper pesticide to control potato blight. According to the Soil Association, the total copper that can be applied to organic land is /year.

===Control of tuber blight===
Ridging is often used to reduce tuber contamination by blight. This normally involves piling soil or mulch around the stems of the potato blight, meaning the pathogen has farther to travel to get to the tuber. Another approach is to destroy the canopy around five weeks before harvest, using a contact herbicide or sulfuric acid to burn off the foliage. Eliminating infected foliage reduces the likelihood of tuber infection.

==Historical impact==
The first recorded instances of the disease were in the United States, in Philadelphia and New York City in early 1843. Winds then spread the spores, and in 1845 it was found from Illinois to Nova Scotia, and from Virginia to Ontario. It crossed the Atlantic Ocean with a shipment of seed potatoes for Belgian farmers in 1845. The disease being first identified in Europe around Kortrijk, Belgium, in June 1845, and resulted in the Flemish potato harvest failing that summer, yields declining 75–80%, leading to an estimated forty thousand deaths in the locale. All of the potato-growing countries in Europe would be affected within a year.

The effect of &quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot; in Ireland in 1845–52 was one of the factors which caused more than one million to starve to death and forced another two million to emigrate. Most commonly referenced is the Great Irish Famine, during the late 1840s. Implicated in Ireland&#x27;s fate was the island&#x27;s disproportionate dependency on a single variety of potato, the Irish Lumper. The lack of genetic variability created a susceptible host population for the organism after the blight strains originating in Chiloé Archipelago replaced earlier potatoes of Peruvian origin in Europe.

During the First World War, all of the copper in Germany was used for shell casings and electric wire and therefore none was available for making copper sulfate to spray potatoes. A major late blight outbreak on potato in Germany therefore went untreated, and the resulting scarcity of potatoes contributed to the deaths from the blockade.

Since 1941, Eastern Africa has been suffering potato production losses because of strains of &quot;P. infestans&quot; from Europe.

France, Canada, the United States, and the Soviet Union researched &quot;P. infestans&quot; as a biological weapon in the 1940s and 1950s. Potato blight was one of more than 17 agents that the United States researched as potential biological weapons before the nation suspended its biological weapons program. Dr. Mannon Gallegley, deceased faculty from WVA worked in the late blight bioweapons program in the 1940s. It is unclear whether the pathogen was ever deployed. Whether a weapon based on the pathogen would be effective is questionable, due to the difficulties in delivering viable pathogen to an enemy&#x27;s fields, and the role of uncontrollable environmental factors in spreading the disease.

Late blight (A2 type) has not yet been detected in Australia and strict biosecurity measures are in place. The disease has been seen in China, India and south-east Asian countries.

A large outbreak of &quot;P. infestans&quot; occurred on tomato plants in the Northeast United States in 2009.

In light of the periodic epidemics of &quot;P. infestans&quot; ever since its first emergence, it may be regarded as a periodically emerging pathogen – or a periodically &quot;re-emerging pathogen&quot;.

<doc id="165451" wikidata="Q171990" url="?curid=165451" title="Laissez-faire">
<text>Laissez-faire ( , from , ) is a type of economic system in which transactions between private groups of people are free from any form of economic interventionism (such as subsidies or regulations). As a system of thought, &quot;laissez-faire&quot; rests on the following axioms: &quot;the individual is the basic unit in society, i.e., the standard of measurement in social calculus; the individual has a natural right to freedom; and the physical order of nature is a harmonious and self-regulating system.&quot; The original phrase was laissez faire, laissez passer, with the second part meaning &quot;let (things) pass&quot;. It is generally attributed to Vincent de Gournay.

Another basic principle of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; holds that markets should naturally be competitive, a rule that the early advocates of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; always emphasized.

The Physiocrats were early advocates of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; and advocated for a &quot;impôt unique&quot;, a tax on land rent to replace the &quot;monstrous and crippling network of taxation that had grown up in 17th century France&quot;. Their view was that only land should be taxed because land is not produced but a naturally existing resource, meaning a tax on it would not be taking from the labour of the taxed, unlike most other taxes.

Proponents of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; argue for a near complete separation of government from the economic sector. The phrase &quot;laissez-faire&quot; is part of a larger French phrase and literally translates to &quot;let [it/them] do&quot;, but in this context the phrase usually means to &quot;let it be&quot; and in expression &quot;laid back&quot;. Although never practiced with full consistency, &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism emerged in the mid-18th century and was further popularized by Adam Smith&#x27;s book &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;.

== Etymology and usage ==
The term &quot;laissez-faire&quot; likely originated in a meeting that took place around 1681 between powerful French Controller-General of Finances Jean-Baptiste Colbert and a group of French businessmen headed by M. Le Gendre. When the eager mercantilist minister asked how the French state could be of service to the merchants and help promote their commerce, Le Gendre replied simply: &quot;Laissez-nous faire&quot; (&quot;Leave it to us&quot; or &quot;Let us do [it]&quot;, the French verb not requiring an object).

The anecdote on the Colbert–Le Gendre meeting appeared in a 1751 article in the &quot;Journal économique&quot;, written by French minister and champion of free trade René de Voyer, Marquis d&#x27;Argenson—also the first known appearance of the term in print. Argenson himself had used the phrase earlier (1736) in his own diaries in a famous outburst:
Vincent de Gournay, a French Physiocrat and intendant of commerce in the 1750s, popularized the term &quot;laissez-faire&quot; as he allegedly adopted it from François Quesnay&#x27;s writings on China. Quesnay coined the phrases &quot;laissez-faire&quot; and &quot;laissez-passer&quot;, &quot;laissez-faire&quot; being a translation of the Chinese term &quot;wu wei&quot; (無為). Gournay ardently supported the removal of restrictions on trade and the deregulation of industry in France. Delighted with the Colbert–Le Gendre anecdote, he forged it into a larger maxim all his own: &quot;Laissez faire et laissez passer&quot; (&quot;Let do and let pass&quot;). His motto has also been identified as the longer &quot;Laissez faire et laissez passer, le monde va de lui même !&quot; (&quot;Let do and let pass, the world goes on by itself!&quot;). Although Gournay left no written tracts on his economic policy ideas, he had immense personal influence on his contemporaries, notably his fellow Physiocrats, who credit both the &quot;laissez-faire&quot; slogan and the doctrine to Gournay.

Before d&#x27;Argenson or Gournay, P. S. de Boisguilbert had enunciated the phrase &quot;On laisse faire la nature&quot; (&quot;Let nature run its course&quot;). D&#x27;Argenson himself during his life was better known for the similar, but less-celebrated motto &quot;Pas trop gouverner&quot; (&quot;Govern not too much&quot;).

The Physiocrats proclaimed &quot;laissez-faire&quot; in 18th-century France, placing it at the very core of their economic principles and famous economists, beginning with Adam Smith, developed the idea. It is with the Physiocrats and the classical political economy that the term &quot;laissez-faire&quot; is ordinarily associated. The book &quot;Laissez Faire and the General-Welfare State&quot; states: &quot;The physiocrats, reacting against the excessive mercantilist regulations of the France of their day, expressed a belief in a &#x27;natural order&#x27; or liberty under which individuals in following their selfish interests contributed to the general good. Since, in their view, this natural order functioned successfully without the aid of government, they advised the state to restrict itself to upholding the rights of private property and individual liberty, to removing all artificial barriers to trade, and to abolishing all useless laws.&quot;

The French phrase &quot;laissez-faire&quot; gained currency in English-speaking countries with the spread of Physiocratic literature in the late 18th century. George Whatley&#x27;s 1774 &quot;Principles of Trade&quot; (co-authored with Benjamin Franklin) re-told the Colbert-LeGendre anecdote; this may mark the first appearance of the phrase in an English-language publication.

Herbert Spencer was opposed to a slightly different application of &quot;laissez faire&quot;—to &quot;that miserable &quot;laissez-faire&quot;&quot; that leads to men&#x27;s ruin, saying: &quot;Along with that miserable &quot;laissez-faire&quot; which calmly looks on while men ruin themselves in trying to enforce by law their equitable claims, there goes activity in supplying them, at other men&#x27;s cost, with gratis novel-reading!&quot;

As a product of the Enlightenment, &quot;laissez-faire&quot; was &quot;conceived as the way to unleash human potential through the restoration of a natural system, a system unhindered by the restrictions of government&quot;. In a similar vein, Adam Smith viewed the economy as a natural system and the market as an organic part of that system. Smith saw &quot;laissez-faire&quot; as a moral program and the market its instrument to ensure men the rights of natural law. By extension, free markets become a reflection of the natural system of liberty. For Smith, &quot;laissez-faire&quot; was &quot;a program for the abolition of laws constraining the market, a program for the restoration of order and for the activation of potential growth&quot;.

However, Smith and notable classical economists such as Thomas Malthus and David Ricardo did not use the phrase. Jeremy Bentham used the term, but it was probably James Mill&#x27;s reference to the &quot;laissez-faire&quot; maxim (together with the &quot;Pas trop gouverner&quot; motto) in an 1824 entry for the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; that really brought the term into wider English usage. With the advent of the Anti-Corn Law League (founded 1838), the term received much of its English meaning.

Smith first used the metaphor of an invisible hand in his book &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot; (1759) to describe the unintentional effects of economic self-organization from economic self-interest. Although not the metaphor itself, the idea lying behind the invisible hand belongs to Bernard de Mandeville and his &quot;Fable of the Bees&quot; (1705). In political economy, that idea and the doctrine of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; have long been closely related. Some have characterized the invisible-hand metaphor as one for &quot;laissez-faire&quot;, although Smith never actually used the term himself. In &quot;Third Millennium Capitalism&quot; (2000), Wyatt M. Rogers Jr. notes a trend whereby recently &quot;conservative politicians and economists have chosen the term &#x27;free-market capitalism&#x27; in lieu of &quot;laissez-faire&quot;&quot;.

American individualist anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker saw themselves as economic &quot;laissez-faire&quot; socialists and political individualists while arguing that their &quot;anarchistic socialism&quot; or &quot;individual anarchism&quot; was &quot;consistent Manchesterism&quot;.

In Europe, the &quot;laissez-faire&quot; movement was first widely promoted by the Physiocrats, a movement that included Vincent de Gournay (1712–1759), a successful merchant turned political figure. Gournay is postulated to have adapted the Taoist concept &quot;wu wei&quot;, from the writings on China by François Quesnay (1694–1774). Gournay held that government should allow the laws of nature to govern economic activity, with the state only intervening to protect life, liberty and property. François Quesnay and Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de l&#x27;Aulne took up Gournay&#x27;s ideas. Quesnay had the ear of the King of France, Louis XV and in 1754 persuaded him to give &quot;laissez-faire&quot; a try. On September 17, the King abolished all tolls and restraints on the sale and transport of grain. For more than a decade, the experiment appeared successful, but 1768 saw a poor harvest, and the cost of bread rose so high that there was widespread starvation while merchants exported grain to obtain the best profit. In 1770, the Comptroller-General of Finances Joseph Marie Terray revoked the edict allowing free trade in grain.

The doctrine of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; became an integral part of 19th-century European liberalism. Just as liberals supported freedom of thought in the intellectual sphere, so were they equally prepared to champion the principles of free trade and free competition in the sphere of economics, seeing the state as merely a passive policeman, protecting private property and administering justice, but not interfering with the affairs of its citizens. Businessmen, British industrialists in particular, were quick to associate these principles with their own economic interests. Many of the ideas of the physiocrats spread throughout Europe and were adopted to a greater or lesser extent in Sweden, Tuscany, Spain and in the newly created United States. Adam Smith, author of &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; (1776), met Quesnay and acknowledged his influence.

In Britain, the newspaper &quot;The Economist&quot; (founded in 1843) became an influential voice for &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism. &quot;Laissez-faire&quot; advocates opposed food aid for famines occurring within the British Empire. In 1847, referring to the famine then underway in Ireland, founder of &quot;The Economist&quot; James Wilson wrote: &quot;It is no man&#x27;s business to provide for another&quot;. More specifically, in An Essay on the Principle of Population, Malthus argued that there was nothing that could be done to avoid famines because he felt he had mathematically proven that population growth tends to exceed growth in food production. However, &quot;The Economist&quot; campaigned against the Corn Laws that protected landlords in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland against competition from less expensive foreign imports of cereal products. The Great Famine in Ireland in 1845 led to the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. The tariffs on grain which kept the price of bread artificially high were repealed. However, repeal of the Corn Laws came too late to stop the Irish famine, partly because it was done in stages over three years.

A group that became known as the Manchester Liberals, to which Richard Cobden (1804–1865) and John Bright (1811–1889) belonged, were staunch defenders of free trade. After the death of Cobden, the Cobden Club (founded in 1866) continued their work. The breakdown of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; as practised by the British Empire was partly led by British companies eager for state support of their positions abroad, in particular British oil companies.
In Italy, philosopher Benedetto Croce created the term &quot;liberism&quot; (derived from the Italian term &quot;liberismo&quot;), a term for the economic doctrine of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism; it is synonymous with economic liberalism. He claimed that &quot;Liberalism can prove only a temporary right of private propriety of land and industries.&quot; It was popularized in English by Italian political scientist Giovanni Sartori. Sartori specifically imported the term from Italian to distinguish between social liberalism, which is generally considered a political ideology often advocating extensive government intervention in the economy, and those economic liberal theories that propose to virtually eliminate such intervention. In informal usage, liberism overlaps with other concepts such as free trade, neoliberalism, right-libertarianism, the American concept of libertarianism, and the &quot;laissez-faire&quot; doctrine of the French liberal Doctrinaires. The intention of Croce and of Sartori to attack the right to private property and to free enterprise separating them from the general philosophy of liberalism, that is primarily a theory of natural rights, was always criticised openly by the quoted philosophers and by some of the main representatives of liberalism, such as Luigi Einaudi, Friedrich Hayek, and Milton Friedman. The Austrian School economist Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk argues that the differences between the economical concept of liberism and the economical consequences of liberalism can be summarized by saying that &quot;A market is a law system. Without it, the only possible economy is the street robbery.&quot; 

=== United States ===
Frank Bourgin&#x27;s study of the Constitutional Convention and subsequent decades argues that direct government involvement in the economy was intended by the Founding Fathers. The reason for this was the economic and financial chaos the nation suffered under the Articles of Confederation. The goal was to ensure that dearly-won political independence was not lost by being economically and financially dependent on the powers and princes of Europe. The creation of a strong central government able to promote science, invention, industry and commerce was seen as an essential means of promoting the general welfare and making the economy of the United States strong enough for them to determine their own destiny. Others view Bourgin&#x27;s study, written in the 1940s and not published until 1989, as an over-interpretation of the evidence, intended originally to defend the New Deal and later to counter Ronald Reagan&#x27;s economic policies.

Historian Kathleen G. Donohue argues that in the 19th century liberalism in the United States had distinctive characteristics and that &quot;at the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of &quot;laissez-faire&quot;. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, &quot;laissez-faire&quot; did not mean &quot;no government intervention&quot; at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers&quot;. Notable examples of government intervention in the period prior to the American Civil War include the establishment of the Patent Office in 1802; the establishment of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures in 1830; the creation of the Survey of the Coast (later renamed the United States Coast Survey and then the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey) in 1807 and other measures to improve river and harbor navigation; the various Army expeditions to the west, beginning with Lewis and Clark&#x27;s Corps of Discovery in 1804 and continuing into the 1870s, almost always under the direction of an officer from the Army Corps of Topographical Engineers and which provided crucial information for the overland pioneers that followed; the assignment of Army Engineer officers to assist or direct the surveying and construction of the early railroads and canals; and the establishment of the First Bank of the United States and Second Bank of the United States as well as various protectionist measures (e.g. the tariff of 1828). Several of these proposals met with serious opposition and required a great deal of horse-trading to be enacted into law. For instance, the First National Bank would not have reached the desk of President George Washington in the absence of an agreement that was reached between Alexander Hamilton and several Southern members of Congress to locate the capitol in the District of Columbia. In contrast to Hamilton and the Federalists was Thomas Jefferson and James Madison&#x27;s opposing political party, the Democratic-Republicans.

Most of the early opponents of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism in the United States subscribed to the American School. This school of thought was inspired by the ideas of Hamilton, who proposed the creation of a government-sponsored bank and increased tariffs to favor Northern industrial interests. Following Hamilton&#x27;s death, the more abiding protectionist influence in the antebellum period came from Henry Clay and his American System. In the early 19th century, &quot;it is quite clear that the &quot;laissez-faire&quot; label is an inappropriate one&quot; to apply to the relationship between the United States government and industry. In the mid-19th century, the United States followed the Whig tradition of economic nationalism, which included increased state regulation and macroeconomic development of infrastructure. Public works such as the provision and regulation transportation such as railroads took effect. The Pacific Railway Acts provided the development of the First transcontinental railroad. To help pay for its war effort in the Civil War, the United States government imposed its first personal income tax on 5 August 1861 as part of the Revenue Act of 1861 (3% of all incomes over US$800; rescinded in 1872).

Following the Civil War, the movement towards a mixed economy accelerated. Protectionism increased with the McKinley Tariff of 1890 and the Dingley Tariff of 1897. Government regulation of the economy expanded with the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 and the Sherman Anti-trust Act. The Progressive Era saw the enactment of more controls on the economy as evidenced by the Woodrow Wilson administration&#x27;s New Freedom program. Following World War I and the Great Depression, the United States turned to a mixed economy which combined free enterprise with a progressive income tax and in which from time to time the government stepped in to support and protect American industry from competition from overseas. For example, in the 1980s the government sought to protect the automobile industry by &quot;voluntary&quot; export restrictions from Japan.

In 1986, Pietro S. Nivola wrote: &quot;By and large, the comparative strength of the dollar against major foreign currencies has reflected high U.S. interest rates driven by huge federal budget deficits. Hence, the source of much of the current deterioration of trade is not the general state of the economy, but rather the government&#x27;s mix of fiscal and monetary policies – that is, the problematic juxtaposition of bold tax reductions, relatively tight monetary targets, generous military outlays, and only modest cuts in major entitlement programs. Put simply, the roots of the trade problem and of the resurgent protectionism it has fomented are fundamentally political as well as economic&quot;.

A more recent advocate of total &quot;laissez-faire&quot; has been Objectivist Ayn Rand, who described it as &quot;the abolition of any and all forms of government intervention in production and trade, the separation of State and Economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of Church and State&quot;. Rand&#x27;s political philosophy emphasized individual rights (including property rights) and she considered &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights. She opposed statism, which she understood to include theocracy, absolute monarchy, Nazism, fascism, communism, socialism and dictatorship. Rand believed that natural rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government. Although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian, she preferred the term &quot;radical for capitalism&quot;. She worked with conservatives on political projects, but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics. She denounced libertarianism, which she associated with anarchism. She rejected anarchism as a naïve theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice.

== Models ==
=== Capitalism ===
A closely related name for &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism is that of raw, pure, or unrestrained capitalism, which refers to capitalism free of any regulations, with low or minimal government and operating almost entirely on the profit motive. It shares a similar economic conception with anarcho-capitalism.

Advocates of laissez-faire capitalism argue that it relies on a constitutionally limited government that unconditionally bans the initiation of force and coercion, including fraud. Therefore, free market economists such as Milton Friedman and Thomas Sowell argue that, under such a system, relationships between companies and workers are purely voluntary and mistreated workers will seek better treatment elsewhere. Thus, most companies will compete for workers on the basis of pay, benefits, and work-life balance just as they compete with one another in the marketplace on the basis of the relative cost and quality of their goods.

So-called &quot;raw&quot; or &quot;hyper-capitalism&quot; is a major motif of cyberpunk in dystopian works such as &quot;Syndicate&quot;.

=== Socialism ===
Although &quot;laissez-faire&quot; has been commonly associated with capitalism, there is a similar &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economic theory and system associated with socialism called left-wing &quot;laissez-faire&quot;, or free-market anarchism, also known as free-market anti-capitalism and free-market socialism to distinguish it from &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism. One first example of this is mutualism as developed by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in the 18th century, from which emerged individualist anarchism. Benjamin Tucker is one eminent American individualist anarchist who adopted a &quot;laissez-faire&quot; system he termed anarchistic socialism in contraposition to state socialism. This tradition has been recently associated with contemporary scholars such as Kevin Carson, Roderick T. Long, Charles W. Johnson, Brad Spangler, Sheldon Richman, Chris Matthew Sciabarra and Gary Chartier, who stress the value of radically free markets, termed freed markets to distinguish them from the common conception which these left-libertarians believe to be riddled with capitalist and statist privileges. Referred to as left-wing market anarchists or market-oriented left-libertarians, proponents of this approach strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support anti-capitalist, anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical and pro-labor positions in economics; anti-imperialism in foreign policy; and thoroughly radical views regarding such cultural issues as gender, sexuality and race. Critics of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; as commonly understood argues that a truly &quot;laissez-faire&quot; system would be anti-capitalist and socialist.

Kevin Carson describes his politics as on &quot;the outer fringes of both free market libertarianism and socialism&quot; and has also been highly critical of intellectual property. Carson has identified the work of Benjamin Tucker, Thomas Hodgskin, Ralph Borsodi, Paul Goodman, Lewis Mumford, Elinor Ostrom, Peter Kropotkin and Ivan Illich as sources of inspiration for his approach to politics and economics. In addition to individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker&#x27;s big four monopolies (land, money, tariffs and patents), he argues that the state has also transferred wealth to the wealthy by subsidizing organizational centralization in the form of transportation and communication subsidies. Carson believes that Tucker overlooked this issue due to Tucker&#x27;s focus on individual market transactions whereas he also focuses on organizational issues. As such, the primary focus of his most recent work has been decentralized manufacturing and the informal and household economies. The theoretical sections of Carson&#x27;s &quot;Studies in Mutualist Political Economy&quot; are also presented as an attempt to integrate marginalist critiques into the labor theory of value.

In response to claims that he uses the term capitalism incorrectly, Carson says he is deliberately choosing to resurrect what he claims to be an old definition of the term to &quot;make a point&quot;. He claims that &quot;the term &#x27;capitalism,&#x27; as it was originally used, did not refer to a free market, but to a type of statist class system in which capitalists controlled the state and the state intervened in the market on their behalf&quot;. Carson holds that &quot;capitalism, arising as a new class society directly from the old class society of the Middle Ages, was founded on an act of robbery as massive as the earlier feudal conquest of the land. It has been sustained to the present by continual state intervention to protect its system of privilege without which its survival is unimaginable&quot;. Carson argues that in a truly &quot;laissez-faire&quot; system the ability to extract a profit from labor and capital would be negligible. Carson coined the pejorative term vulgar libertarianism, a phrase that describes the use of a free market rhetoric in defense of corporate capitalism and economic inequality. According to Carson, the term is derived from the phrase vulgar political economy which Karl Marx described as an economic order that &quot;deliberately becomes increasingly apologetic and makes strenuous attempts to talk out of existence the ideas which contain the contradictions [existing in economic life]&quot;.

Gary Chartier offers an understanding of property rights as contingent yet tightly constrained social strategies, reflective of the importance of multiple, overlapping rationales for separate ownership and of natural law principles of practical reasonableness, defending robust yet non-absolute protections for these rights in a manner similar to that employed by David Hume. This account is distinguished both from Lockean and neo-Lockean views which deduce property rights from the idea of self-ownership and from consequentialist accounts that might license widespread ad hoc interference with the possessions of groups and individuals. Chartier uses this account to ground a clear statement of the natural law basis for the view that solidaristic wealth redistribution by individual persons is often morally required, but as a response by individuals and grass-roots networks to particular circumstances rather than as a state-driven attempt to achieve a particular distributive pattern. He advances detailed arguments for workplace democracy rooted in such natural law principles as subsidiarity, defending it as morally desirable and as a likely outcome of the elimination of injustice rather than as something to be mandated by the state.

Chartier has discussed natural law approaches to land reform and to the occupation of factories by workers. He objects on natural law grounds to intellectual property protections, drawing on his theory of property rights more generally and develops a general natural law account of boycotts. He has argued that proponents of genuinely freed markets should explicitly reject capitalism and identify with the global anti-capitalist movement while emphasizing that the abuses the anti-capitalist movement highlights result from state-tolerated violence and state-secured privilege rather than from voluntary cooperation and exchange. According to Chartier, &quot;it makes sense for [freed-market advocates] to name what they oppose &#x27;capitalism.&#x27; Doing so calls attention to the freedom movement&#x27;s radical roots, emphasizes the value of understanding society as an alternative to the state, underscores the fact that proponents of freedom object to non-aggressive as well as aggressive restraints on liberty, ensures that advocates of freedom aren&#x27;t confused with people who use market rhetoric to prop up an unjust status quo, and expresses solidarity between defenders of freed markets and workers — as well as ordinary people around the world who use &quot;capitalism&quot; as a short-hand label for the world-system that constrains their freedom and stunts their lives&quot;.

== Criticism ==
Over the years, a number of economists have offered critiques of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economics. Adam Smith acknowledges some moral ambiguities towards the system of capitalism. Smith had misgivings concerning some aspects of each of the major character-types produced by modern capitalist society, namely the landlords, the workers and the capitalists. Smith claimed that &quot;[t]he landlords&#x27; role in the economic process is passive. Their ability to reap a revenue solely from ownership of land tends to make them indolent and inept, and so they tend to be unable to even look after their own economic interests&quot; and that &quot;[t]he increase in population should increase the demand for food, which should increase rents, which should be economically beneficial to the landlords&quot;. According to Smith, the landlords should be in favour of policies which contribute to the growth in the wealth of nations, but they often are not in favour of these pro-growth policies because of their own indolence-induced ignorance and intellectual flabbiness. Smith stated clearly that he believed that without morality and laws, society would fail. From that perspective, it seems dubious that Smith supported a pure Laissez-Faire style of capitalism, and the ideas he supports in &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; is heavily dependent on the moral philosophy from his previous work, &quot;Theory of Moral Sentiment&quot;.

Many philosophers have written on the systems society has created to manage their civilizations. Thomas Hobbes used the concept of a &quot;state of nature&quot;, which is a time before any government or laws, as a starting point to consider the question. In this time, life would be &quot;war of all against all&quot;. Further, &quot;In such condition, there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain ... continual fear and danger of violent death, and the life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.&quot;

Regardless of preferred political preference, all societies require shared moral values as a prerequisite on which to build laws to protect individuals from each other. Adam Smith wrote Wealth of Nations during the Enlightenment, a period of time when the prevailing attitude was, &quot;All things can be Known.&quot; In effect, European thinkers, inspired by the likes of Isaac Newton and others, set about to &quot;find the laws&quot; of all things, that there existed a &quot;natural law&quot; underlying all aspects of life. They believed that these could be discovered and that everything in the universe could be rationally demystified and catalogued, including human interactions.

Critics and market abolitionists such as David McNally argue in the Marxist tradition that the logic of the market inherently produces inequitable outcomes and leads to unequal exchanges, arguing that Smith&#x27;s moral intent and moral philosophy espousing equal exchange was undermined by the practice of the free market he championed. According to McNally, the development of the market economy involved coercion, exploitation and violence that Smith&#x27;s moral philosophy could not countenance.

The British economist John Maynard Keynes condemned &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economic policy on several occasions. In &quot;The End of Laissez-faire&quot; (1926), one of the most famous of his critiques, Keynes argues that the doctrines of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; are dependent to some extent on improper deductive reasoning and says the question of whether a market solution or state intervention is better must be determined on a case-by-case basis.

The Austrian School economist Friedrich Hayek stated that a freely competitive, &quot;laissez-faire&quot; banking industry tends to be endogenously destabilizing and pro-cyclical, arguing that the need for central banking control was inescapable.

Karl Polanyi&#x27;s &quot;Great Transformation&quot; criticizes self-regulating markets as aberrational, unnatural phenomena which tend towards social disruption.

In modern economics laissez-faire typically has a bad connotation, which hints towards a perceived need for restraint due to social needs and securities that can not be adequately responded to by companies with just a motive for making profit.

Robert Kuttner states that &quot;for over a century, popular struggles in democracies have used the nation-state to temper raw capitalism. The power of voters has offset the power of capital. But as national barriers have come down in the name of freer commerce, so has the capacity of governments to manage capitalism in a broad public interest. So the real issue is not &#x27;trade&#x27; but democratic governance&quot;.

The main issues of raw capitalism are said to lie in its disregard for quality, durability, sustainability, respect for the environment and human beings as well as a lack of morality. From this more critical angle, companies might naturally aim to maximise profits at the expense of workers&#x27; and broader social interests.

<text>Inigo Jones (15 July 1573 – 21 June 1652) was an English architect who was the first significant architect in England in the early modern era and the first to employ Vitruvian rules of proportion and symmetry in his buildings.
As the most notable architect in England, Jones was the first person to introduce the classical architecture of Rome and the Italian Renaissance to Britain. He left his mark on London by his design of single buildings, such as the Queen&#x27;s House which is the first building in England designed in a pure classical style, and the Banqueting House, Whitehall, as well as the layout for Covent Garden square which became a model for future developments in the West End. He made major contributions to stage design by his work as a theatrical designer for several dozen masques, most by royal command and many in collaboration with Ben Jonson.

==Early life and career==

Beyond that he was born in Smithfield, London, as the son of clothworker Inigo Jones Snr., and baptised at the church of St Bartholomew-the-Less, little is known about Jones&#x27;s early years. Later Welsh sources claim that the family was from Wales, and even that Inigo was originally named Ynir or Ynyr Jones. But no records from his own time indicate any family ties to Wales.

He did not approach the architectural profession in the traditional way, namely either by rising up from a craft or through early exposure to the Office of Works, although there is evidence that Christopher Wren obtained information that recorded Jones as an apprentice joiner in St Paul&#x27;s Churchyard. At some point before 1603, a rich patron (possibly the Earl of Pembroke or the Earl of Rutland) sent him to Italy to study drawing after being impressed by the quality of his sketches. From Italy he travelled to Denmark where he worked for Christian IV on the design of the palaces of Rosenborg and Frederiksborg.

Jones first became famous as a designer of costumes and stage settings, especially after he brought &quot;masques&quot; to the stage. Under the patronage of Queen Anne of Denmark (the consort of King James I), he is credited with introducing movable scenery and the proscenium arch to English theatre. Between 1605 and 1640, he was responsible for staging over 500 performances, collaborating with Ben Jonson for many years, despite a relationship fraught with competition and jealousy: the two had arguments about whether stage design or literature was more important in theatre. (Jonson ridiculed Jones in a series of his works, written over two decades.) Over 450 drawings for the scenery and costumes survive, demonstrating Jones&#x27;s virtuosity as a draughtsman and his development between 1605 and 1609 from initially showing &quot;no knowledge of Renaissance draughtsmanship&quot; to exhibiting an &quot;accomplished Italianate manner&quot; and understanding of Italian set design, particularly that of Alfonso and Giulio Parigi. This development suggests a second visit to Italy, , influenced by the ambassador Henry Wotton. Jones learned to speak Italian fluently and there is evidence that he owned an Italian copy of Andrea Palladio&#x27;s with marginalia that refer to Wotton. His architectural work was particularly influenced by Palladio. To a lesser extent, he also held to the architectural principles of the ancient Roman writer Vitruvius.

Jones&#x27;s first recorded architectural design is for a monument to Frances, Lady Cotton, commissioned by Rowland Cotton, , at Norton-in-Hales, Shropshire, showing early signs of his classical intentions. In July 1606, Jones made scenery for a masque at Theobalds for the Earl of Salisbury. In the following years, Jones made drawings for the Earl of Salisbury&#x27;s New Exchange in the Strand, where work commenced in June 1608, and the central tower of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, displaying a similar practical architectural inexperience and immature handling of themes from sources including Palladio, Serlio and Sangallo. In 1609, having perhaps accompanied Salisbury&#x27;s son and heir, Viscount Cranborne, around France, he appears as an architectural consultant at Hatfield House, making small modifications to the design as the project progressed, and in 1610, Jones was appointed Surveyor to Prince Henry. He devised the masques the &quot;Barriers&quot; and the &quot;Masque of Oberon&quot; for the Prince and was possibly involved in some alterations to St James&#x27;s Palace.

On 27 April 1613, Jones was appointed the position of Surveyor of the King&#x27;s Works and shortly after, embarked on a tour of Italy with the Earl of Arundel, destined to become one of the most important patrons in the history of English art. On this trip, Jones was exposed to the architecture of Rome, Padua, Florence, Vicenza, Genoa and Venice among others. His surviving sketchbook shows his preoccupation with such artists as Parmigianino and Andrea Schiavone. He is also known to have met Vincenzo Scamozzi at this time. His annotated copy of Palladio&#x27;s &quot;Quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot; also demonstrates his close interest in classical architecture: Jones gave priority to Roman antiquity rather than observing the contemporary fashion in Italy. He was probably the first native-born to study these Roman remains first hand and this was key to the new architecture Jones introduced in England and Wales.

== Masques ==
Jones worked as a producer and architect for Masques from 1605 to 1640, but his most known work in this field came from his collaboration with poet and playwright Ben Jonson. Having worked together for fifteen years, the two debated and had disagreements about their line of work and about what was most integral in a masque. While Jonson argued that the most important aspect of a masque was the written word that the audience heard, Jones argued that the visual spectacle was the most important aspect, and that what the audience saw was more important. Jones also felt that the architect had just as much creative freedom and rights as the writer or poet of the masque. In defence of this Jones stated that masques were &quot;nothing but pictures with light and motion,&quot; making little to note of the words spoken.

Jones&#x27;s work on masques with Jonson is credited to be one of the first instances of scenery introduced in theatre. In his masques, curtains were used and placed in between the stage and the audience, and they were to be opened to introduce a scene. Jones was also known for using the stage and theatre space in its entirety, putting his actors throughout different parts of the theatre, such as placing them below the stage or elevating them onto a higher platform. Jones&#x27;s settings on the stage also incorporated different uses of light, experimenting with coloured glasses, screens and oiled paper to create a softer source of light on the stage.

Jones is also known for introducing to English audiences moving scenery through what is called &#x27;machina versatilis&#x27;, helping to create motion among a stable scene without any noticeable Stagehands and of creating a representation of the ethereal.

These elements of stage design and of theatre production would later have influence beyond the English court, as those working in the public stage would take up these ideas and apply them to the early modern stage and for its larger audience.

==Architecture==

In September 1615, Jones was appointed Surveyor-General of the King&#x27;s Works, marking the beginning of Jones&#x27;s career in earnest. Fortunately, both James I and Charles I spent lavishly on their buildings, contrasting hugely with the economical court of Elizabeth I. As the King&#x27;s Surveyor, Jones built some of his key buildings in London. In 1616, work began on the Queen&#x27;s House, Greenwich, for James I&#x27;s wife, Anne. With the foundations laid and the first storey built, work stopped suddenly when Anne died in 1619. Jones provided a design for the queen&#x27;s funeral hearse or catafalque, but it was not implemented. Work at Greenwich resumed in 1629, this time for Charles I&#x27;s Queen, Henrietta Maria. It was finished in 1635 as the first strictly classical building in England, employing ideas found in the architecture of Palladio and ancient Rome. This is Jones&#x27;s earliest-surviving work.
Between 1619 and 1622, the Banqueting House in the Palace of Whitehall was built, a design derived from buildings by Scamozzi and Palladio, to which a ceiling painted by Peter Paul Rubens was added several years later. The Whitehall palace was one of several projects where Jones worked with his personal assistant and nephew by marriage John Webb.

The Queen&#x27;s Chapel, St. James&#x27;s Palace, was built between 1623 and 1627, initially for Charles I&#x27;s proposed bride, the Roman Catholic Infanta Maria Anna of Spain, and then for Charles I&#x27;s wife, Henrietta Maria of France. Parts of the design originate in the Pantheon of ancient Rome and Jones evidently intended the church to evoke the Roman temple. These buildings show the realization of a mature architect with a confident grasp of classical principles and an intellectual understanding of how to implement them.
The other project in which Jones was involved is the design of Covent Garden Square. He was commissioned by the Earl of Bedford to build a residential square, which he did along the lines of the Italian piazza of Livorno. It is the first regularly planned square in London. The Earl felt obliged to provide a church and he warned Jones that he wanted to economise. He told him to simply erect a &quot;barn&quot; and Jones&#x27;s oft-quoted response was that his lordship would have &quot;the finest barn in Europe&quot;. In the design of St Paul&#x27;s, Jones faithfully adhered to Vitruvius&#x27;s design for a Tuscan temple and it was the first wholly and authentically classical church built in England. The inside of St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden was gutted by fire in 1795, but externally it remains much as Jones designed it and dominates the west side of the piazza.

Jones also designed the square of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, and a house in the square, the Lindsey House built in 1640, is often attributed to Jones. Its design of a rusticated ground floor with giant pilasters above supporting the entablature and balustrade served as a model for other town houses in London such as John Nash&#x27;s Regent&#x27;s Park terraces, as well as in other English and Welsh towns such as Bath&#x27;s Royal Crescent.

Another large project Jones undertook was the repair and remodelling of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Between the years of 1634 and 1642, Jones wrestled with the dilapidated Gothicism of Old St Paul&#x27;s, casing it in classical masonry and totally redesigning the west front. Jones incorporated the giant scrolls from Vignola and della Porta&#x27;s Church of the Gesù with a giant Corinthian portico, the largest of its type north of the Alps, but the church would be destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. Also around this time, circa 1638, Jones devised drawings completely redesigning the Palace of Whitehall, but the execution of these designs was frustrated by Charles I&#x27;s financial and political difficulties.

More than 1000 buildings have been attributed to Jones but only a very small number of those are certain to be his work. According to architecture historian John Summerson, the modern concept of an architect&#x27;s artistic responsibility for a building did not exist at that time, and Jones&#x27;s role in many instances may be that of a civil servant in getting things done rather than as an architect. Jones&#x27;s contribution to a building may also simply be verbal instructions to a mason or bricklayer and providing an Italian engraving or two as a guide, or the correction of drafts. In the 1630s, Jones was in high demand and, as Surveyor to the King, his services were only available to a very limited circle of people, so often projects were commissioned to other members of the Works. Stoke Bruerne Park in Northamptonshire was built by Sir Francis Crane, &quot;receiving the assistance of Inigo Jones&quot;, between 1629 and 1635. Jones is also thought to have been involved in another country house, this time in Wiltshire. Wilton House was renovated from about 1630 onwards, at times worked on by Jones, then passed on to Isaac de Caus when Jones was too busy with royal clients. He then returned in 1646 with his student, John Webb, to try and complete the project. Contemporary equivalent architects included Sir Balthazar Gerbier and Nicholas Stone.

One of Jones&#x27;s designs is the &quot;double cube&quot; room at Wilton, and it was also the foundation stone of his status as the father of British architecture. Jones, as the pioneer in his era, had strong influence during their time. His revolutionary ideas even effect beyond the Court circle, and today, many scholars believe that he also started the golden age of British architecture.

==Political and civic life==
On 16 February 1621, in a by-election caused by the ejection of an existing member Sir John Leedes, Jones was elected M.P. in the Parliament of England for New Shoreham in West Sussex, a borough constituency controlled by the Earl of Arundel, and sat till the dissolution of that parliament in February 1622. He was named to a committee to improve lighting and increase seating in the House of Commons&#x27; chamber, resulting in a new gallery being erected in St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel during the summer recess and was also responsible for a new ceiling put in the House of Lords chamber in 1623. He also served as a Justice of the Peace (J.P.) for the county of Middlesex and borough of Westminster from 1630 until at least 1640. He was made a freeman of the borough of Southampton in 1623 and in 1633 was offered, but declined, a knighthood by Charles I.

==Later life==
Jones&#x27;s full-time career effectively ended with the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 and the seizure of the King&#x27;s houses in 1643. Jones was captured at the third siege of Basing House in October 1645. Unfortunately, as one of the last great strongholds to the Cavaliers, the great mansion inside was destroyed by Cromwell&#x27;s army and even the walls were broken into many pieces. His property was later returned to him (c. 1646) but Jones ended his days, unmarried, living in Somerset House. He was, however, closely involved in the design of Coleshill House, in Berkshire, for the Pratt family, which he visited with the young apprentice architect Roger Pratt, to fix a new site for the proposed mansion. He died on 21 June 1652 and was buried with his parents at St Benet&#x27;s, Paul&#x27;s Wharf, the Welsh church of the City of London. John Denham and then Christopher Wren followed him as King&#x27;s Surveyor of Works. A monument dedicated to him in the church, portraying St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and other buildings, was destroyed in the Great Fire in 1666.

Jones was an influence on a number of 18th-century architects, notably Lord Burlington and William Kent. There is an Inigo Jones Road in Charlton, southeast London (SE7), near Charlton House, some of whose features were allegedly designed by him.

A bridge in Llanrwst, North Wales, built in 1636 and named &quot;Pont Fawr&quot; is also known locally as &quot;Pont Inigo Jones&quot; (Inigo Jones&#x27;s Bridge). He is also said to be responsible for the Masonic &quot;Inigo Jones Manuscript&quot;, from around 1607, a document of the Old Charges of Freemasonry.

<text>The term &quot;big cat&quot; is typically used to refer to any of the five living members of the genus &quot;Panthera&quot;, namely the tiger, lion, jaguar, leopard, and snow leopard.

All cats descend from the &quot;Felidae&quot; family, sharing similar musculature, cardiovascular systems, skeletal frames, and behaviour. Both the cheetah and cougar differ physically from fellow big cats, and to a greater extent, other small cats. As obligate carnivores, big cats are considered apex predators, topping their food chain without natural predators of their own. Native ranges include the Americas, Africa, and Asia; the ranges of the leopard and tiger also extend into Europe, specifically in Russia.

==Species==
*Family &quot;Felidae&quot;
** Subfamily &quot;Pantherinae&quot;
*** Genus &quot;Panthera&quot;
**** Tiger (&quot;Panthera tigris&quot;)
**** Lion (&quot;Panthera leo&quot;)
**** Jaguar (&quot;Panthera onca&quot;)
**** Leopard (&quot;Panthera pardus&quot;)
**** Snow leopard (&quot;Panthera uncia&quot;)
** Subfamily &quot;Felinae&quot;
*** Genus &quot;Acinonyx&quot;
**** Cheetah (&quot;Acinonyx jubatus&quot;)
*** Genus &quot;Puma&quot;
**** Cougar (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;)

==Evolution==
It is estimated that the ancestors of most big cats split away from the Felinae about 6.37 million years ago. The Felinae, on the other hand, comprises mostly small to medium-sized cats, including domestic cats, but also some larger cats such as the cougar and cheetah.

A 2010 study published in &quot;Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution&quot; has given insight into the exact evolutionary relationships of the big cats. The study reveals that the snow leopard and the tiger are sister species, while the lion, leopard, and jaguar are more closely related to each other. The tiger and snow leopard diverged from the ancestral big cats approximately 3.9 Ma. The tiger then evolved into a unique species towards the end of the Pliocene epoch, approximately 3.2 Ma. The ancestor of the lion, leopard, and jaguar split from other big cats from 4.3–3.8 Ma. Between 3.6 and 2.5 Ma, the jaguar diverged from the ancestor of lions and leopards. Lions and leopards split from one another approximately 2 Ma. The earliest big cat fossil, &quot;Panthera blytheae&quot;, dating to 4.1−5.95 MA, was discovered in southwest Tibet.

==Description and abilities==
===Roaring===
The ability to roar comes from an elongated and specially adapted larynx and hyoid apparatus. The larynx is attached to the hyoid bone that is hanging from a sequence of bones. This sequence of bones the hyoid hangs from are tympanohyal, stylohyal, epihyal, and ceratohyal; these are located in the mandible and skull. In the larynx, there are vocal folds that produce the structure needed to stretch the ligament to a length that creates the roar effect. This tissue is made of thick collagen and elastic fiber that becomes denser as it approaches the epithelial mucosal lining. When this large pad folds it creates a low natural frequency, causing the cartilage walls of the larynx to vibrate. When it begins to vibrate the sound moves from a high to low air resistance which makes the roaring.

The lion&#x27;s larynx is the longest, giving it the most robust roar. The roar in good conditions can be heard 8 or even 10 km () away. All five extant members of the genus &quot;Panthera&quot; contain this elongated hyoid but owing to differences in the larynx the snow leopard cannot roar. Unlike the roaring cats in their family, the snow leopard is distinguished by the lack of a large pad of fibro-elastic tissue that allows for a large vocal fold.

===Weight range===
The range of weights exhibited by the species is large. At the bottom, adult snow leopards usually weigh , with an exceptional specimen reaching .

Male and female lions typically weigh and respectively, and male and female tigers and respectively. Exceptionally heavy male lions and tigers have been recorded to exceed in the wilderness, and weigh around in captivity.

The liger, a hybrid of a lion and tiger, can grow to be much larger than its parent species. In particular, a liger called &#x27;Nook&#x27; is reported to have weighed over .

==Interaction with humans==
===Conservation===

An animal sanctuary provides a refuge for animals to live out their natural lives in a protected environment. Usually, these animal sanctuaries are the organizations which provide a home to big cats whose private owners are no longer able or willing to care for their big cats. However, the use of the word &quot;sanctuary&quot; in an organization&#x27;s name is by itself no guarantee that it is a true animal sanctuary in the sense of a refuge. To be accepted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) as a bona fide animal sanctuary and to be eligible for an exemption from the prohibition of interstate movement of big cats under the Captive Wildlife Safety Act (CWSA), organizations must meet the following criteria:
*Must be a non-profit entity that is tax-exempt under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code
*Cannot engage in commercial trade in big cat species, including their offspring, parts, and products made from them
*Cannot breed big cats
*Cannot allow direct contact between big cats and the public at their facilities
*Must keep records of transactions involving covered cats
*Must allow the service to inspect their facilities, records, and animals at reasonable hours
Internationally, a variety of regulations are placed on big cat possession. In Austria, big cats may only be owned in a qualified zoo which is overseen by a zoologist or veterinarian. Requirements must also be met for enclosures, feeding, and training practices. Both Russia and South Africa regulate private ownership of big cats native to each country. Some countries, including Denmark, Thailand and India, prohibit all private ownership of big cats.

===Threats===
The members of the &quot;Panthera&quot; genus are classified as some level of threatened by the IUCN Red List: the lion, leopard and snow leopard are categorized as Vulnerable; the tiger is listed as Endangered; and the jaguar is listed as Near Threatened. Cheetahs are also classified as Vulnerable, and the cougar is of Least Concern. All species currently have populations that are decreasing. The principal threats to big cats vary by geographic location but primarily consist of habitat destruction and poaching. In Africa, many big cats are hunted by pastoralists or government &quot;problem animal control&quot; officers. Certain protected areas exist that shelter large and exceptionally visible populations of African leopards, lions and cheetahs, such as Botswana&#x27;s Chobe, Kenya&#x27;s Masai Mara, and Tanzania&#x27;s Serengeti; outside these conservation areas, hunting poses the dominant threat to large carnivores.

In the United States, 19 states have banned ownership of big cats and other dangerous exotic animals as pets, and the Captive Wildlife Safety Act bans the interstate sale and transportation of these animals. The initial Captive Wildlife Safety Act (CWSA) was signed into law on December 19, 2003. To address problems associated with the increasing trade in certain big cat species, the CWSA regulations were strengthened by a law passed on September 17, 2007. The big cat species addressed in these regulations are the lion, tiger, leopard, snow leopard, clouded leopard, cheetah, jaguar, cougar, and any hybrid of these species (liger, tigon, etc.). Private ownership is not prohibited, but the law makes it illegal to transport, sell, or purchase such animals in interstate or foreign commerce. Although these regulations seem to provide a strong legal framework for controlling the commerce involving big cats, international organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) have encouraged the U.S. to further strengthen these laws. The WWF is concerned that weaknesses in the existing U.S. regulations could be unintentionally helping to fuel the black market for tiger parts.

<doc id="165457" wikidata="Q177847" url="?curid=165457" title="Lucian">
<text>Lucian of Samosata (Λουκιανὸς ὁ Σαμοσατεύς, 125 – after 180) was a Hellenized Syrian satirist, rhetorician and pamphleteer who is best known for his characteristic tongue-in-cheek style, with which he frequently ridiculed superstition, religious practices, and belief in the paranormal. Although his native language was probably Syriac, all of his extant works are written entirely in ancient Greek (mostly in the Attic Greek dialect popular during the Second Sophistic period).

Everything that is known about Lucian&#x27;s life comes from his own writings, which are often difficult to interpret because of his extensive use of sarcasm. According to his oration &quot;The Dream&quot;, he was the son of a lower middle class family from the city of Samosata along the banks of the Euphrates in the remote Roman province of Syria. As a young man, he was apprenticed to his uncle to become a sculptor, but, after a failed attempt at sculpting, he ran away to pursue an education in Ionia. He may have become a travelling lecturer and visited universities throughout the Roman Empire. After acquiring fame and wealth through his teaching, Lucian finally settled down in Athens for a decade, during which he wrote most of his extant works. In his fifties, he may have been appointed as a highly paid government official in Egypt, after which point he disappears from the historical record.

Lucian&#x27;s works were wildly popular in antiquity, and more than eighty writings attributed to him have survived to the present day, a considerably higher quantity than for most other classical writers. His most famous work is &quot;A True Story&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek satire against authors who tell incredible tales, which is regarded by some as the earliest known work of science fiction. Lucian invented the genre of comic dialogue, a parody of the traditional Socratic dialogue. His dialogue &quot;Lover of Lies&quot; makes fun of people who believe in the supernatural and contains the oldest known version of &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;. Lucian wrote numerous satires making fun of traditional stories about the gods including &quot;The Dialogues of the Gods&quot;, &quot;Icaromenippus&quot;, &quot;Zeus Rants&quot;, &quot;Zeus Catechized&quot;, and &quot;The Parliament of the Gods&quot;. His &quot;Dialogues of the Dead&quot; focuses on the Cynic philosophers Diogenes and Menippus. &quot;Philosophies for Sale&quot; and &quot;The Carousal, or The Lapiths&quot; make fun of various philosophical schools, and &quot;The Fisherman or the Dead Come to Life&quot; is a defense of this mockery.

Lucian often ridiculed public figures, such as the Cynic philosopher Peregrinus Proteus in his letter &quot;The Passing of Peregrinus&quot; and the fraudulent oracle Alexander of Abonoteichus in his treatise &quot;Alexander the False Prophet&quot;. Lucian&#x27;s treatise &quot;On the Syrian Goddess&quot; satirizes cultural distinctions between Greeks and Syrians and is the main source of information about the cult of Atargatis.

Lucian had an enormous, wide-ranging impact on Western literature. Works inspired by his writings include Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot;, the works of François Rabelais, William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; and Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;.

==Life==
===Biographical sources===
Lucian is not mentioned in any contemporary texts or inscriptions written by others and he is not included in Philostratus&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Sophists&quot;. As a result of this, everything that is known about Lucian comes exclusively from his own writings. A variety of characters with names very similar to Lucian, including &quot;Lukinos&quot;, &quot;Lukianos&quot;, &quot;Lucius&quot;, and &quot;The Syrian&quot; appear throughout Lucian&#x27;s writings. These have been frequently interpreted by scholars and biographers as &quot;masks&quot;, &quot;alter-egos&quot;, or &quot;mouthpieces&quot; of the author. Daniel S. Richter criticizes the frequent tendency to interpret such &quot;Lucian-like figures&quot; as self-inserts by the author and argues that they are, in fact, merely fictional characters Lucian uses to &quot;think with&quot; when satirizing conventional distinctions between Greeks and Syrians. He suggests that they are primarily a literary trope used by Lucian to deflect accusations that he as the Syrian author &quot;has somehow outraged the purity of Greek idiom or genre&quot; through his invention of the comic dialogue. British classicist Donald Russell states, &quot;A good deal of what Lucian says about himself is no more to be trusted than the voyage to the moon that he recounts so persuasively in the first person in &quot;True Stories&quot;&quot; and warns that &quot;it is foolish to treat [the information he gives about himself in his writings] as autobiography.&quot;

===Background and upbringing===

Lucian was born in the town of Samosata on the banks of the Euphrates on the far eastern outskirts of the Roman Empire. Samosata had been the capital of the kingdom of Commagene until 72 AD when it was annexed by Vespasian and became part of the Roman province of Syria. The population of the town was mostly Syrian and Lucian&#x27;s native tongue was probably Syriac, a form of Middle Aramaic.

During the time when Lucian lived, traditional Greco-Roman religion was in decline and its role in society had become largely ceremonial. As a substitute for traditional religion, many people in the Hellenistic world joined mystery cults, such as the Mysteries of Isis, Mithraism, the cult of Cybele, and the Eleusinian Mysteries. Superstition had always been common throughout ancient society, but it was especially prevalent during the second century. Most educated people of Lucian&#x27;s time adhered to one of the various Hellenistic philosophies, of which the major ones were Stoicism, Platonism, Peripateticism, Pyrrhonism, and Epicureanism. Every major town had its own &#x27;university&#x27; and these &#x27;universities&#x27; often employed professional travelling lecturers, who were frequently paid high sums of money to lecture about various philosophical teachings. The most prestigious center of learning was the city of Athens in Greece, which had a long intellectual history.

According to Lucian&#x27;s oration &quot;The Dream&quot;, which classical scholar Lionel Casson states he probably delivered as an address upon returning to Samosata at the age of thirty-five or forty after establishing his reputation as a great orator, Lucian&#x27;s parents were lower middle class and his uncles owned a local statue-making shop. Lucian&#x27;s parents could not afford to give him a higher education, so, after he completed his elementary schooling, Lucian&#x27;s uncle took him on as an apprentice and began teaching him how to sculpt. Lucian, however, soon proved to be poor at sculpting and ruined the statue he had been working on. His uncle beat him, causing him to run off. Lucian fell asleep and experienced a dream in which he was being fought over by the personifications of Statuary and Culture. He decided to listen to Culture and thus sought out an education.

Although &quot;The Dream&quot; has long been treated by scholars as a truthful autobiography of Lucian, its historical accuracy is questionable at best. Classicist Simon Swain calls it &quot;a fine but rather apocryphal version of Lucian&#x27;s education&quot; and Karin Schlapbach calls it &quot;ironical&quot;. Richter argues that it is not autobiographical at all, but rather a (), or playful literary work, and a &quot;complicated meditation on a young man&#x27;s acquisition of &quot; [i.e. education]. Russell dismisses &quot;The Dream&quot; as entirely fictional, noting, &quot;We recall that Socrates too started as sculptor, and Ovid&#x27;s vision of Elegy and Tragedy (&quot;Amores&quot; 3.1) is all too similar to Lucian&#x27;s.&quot;

===Education and career===

In Lucian&#x27;s &quot;Double Indictment&quot;, the personification of Rhetoric delivers a speech in which she describes the unnamed defendant, who is described as a &quot;Syrian&quot; author of transgressive dialogues, at the time she found him, as a young man wandering in Ionia in Anatolia &quot;with no idea what he ought to do with himself&quot;. She describes &quot;the Syrian&quot; at this stage in his career as &quot;still speaking in a barbarous manner and all but wearing a caftan [] in the Assyrian fashion&quot;. Rhetoric states that she &quot;took him in hand and ... gave him &quot;.

Scholars have long interpreted the &quot;Syrian&quot; in this work as Lucian himself and taken this speech to mean that Lucian ran away to Ionia, where he pursued his education. Richter, however, argues that the &quot;Syrian&quot; is not Lucian himself, but rather a literary device Lucian uses to subvert literary and ethnic norms.

Ionia was the center of rhetorical learning at the time. The most prestigious universities of rhetoric were in Ephesus and Smyrna, but it is unlikely that Lucian could have afforded to pay the tuition at either of these schools. It is not known how Lucian obtained his education, but somehow he managed to acquire an extensive knowledge of rhetoric as well as classical literature and philosophy.

Lucian mentions in his dialogue &quot;The Fisherman&quot; that he had initially attempted to apply his knowledge of rhetoric and become a lawyer, but that he had become disillusioned by the deceitfulness of the trade and resolved to become a philosopher instead. Lucian travelled across the Empire, lecturing throughout Greece, Italy, and Gaul. In Gaul, Lucian may have held a position as a highly paid government professor.

In around 160, Lucian returned to Ionia as a wealthy celebrity. He visited Samosata and stayed in the east for several years. He is recorded as having been in Antioch in either 162 or 163. In around 165, he bought a house in Athens and invited his parents to come live with him in the city. Lucian must have married at some point during his travels because in one of his writings, he mentions having a son at this point.

Lucian lived in Athens for around a decade, during which time he gave up lecturing and instead devoted his attention to writing. It was during this decade that Lucian composed nearly all his most famous works. Lucian wrote exclusively in Greek, mainly in the Attic Greek popular during the Second Sophistic, but &quot;On the Syrian Goddess&quot;, which is attributed to Lucian, is written in a highly successful imitation of Herodotus&#x27; Ionic Greek, leading some scholars to believe that Lucian may not be the real author.

For unknown reasons, Lucian stopped writing around 175 and began travelling and lecturing again. During the reign of Emperor Commodus (180–192), the aging Lucian may have been appointed to a lucrative government position in Egypt. After this point, he disappears from the historical record entirely, and nothing is known about his death.

==Views==
Lucian&#x27;s philosophical views are difficult to categorize due to his persistent use of irony and sarcasm. In &quot;The Fisherman&quot;, Lucian describes himself as a champion of philosophy and throughout his other writings he characterizes philosophy as a morally constructive discipline, but he is critical of pseudo-philosophers, whom he portrays as greedy, bad-tempered, sexually immoral hypocrites. Lucian was not known to be a member of any of the major philosophical schools. In his &quot;Philosophies for Sale&quot;, he makes fun of members of every school. Lucian was critical of Stoicism and Platonism, because he regarded them as encouraging superstition. His &quot;Nigrinus&quot; superficially appears to be a &quot;eulogy of Platonism&quot;, but may, in fact, be satirical, or merely an excuse to ridicule Roman society.

Nonetheless, at other times, Lucian writes approvingly of individual philosophies. According to Turner, although Lucian makes fun of Skeptic philosophers, he displays a temperamental inclination towards that philosophy. Edwyn Bevan identifies Lucian as a Skeptic, and in his &quot;Hermotimus&quot;, Lucian rejects all philosophical systems as contradictory and concludes that life is too short to determine which of them comes nearest to the truth, so the best solution is to rely on common sense, which was what the Pyrrhonian Skeptics advocated. The maxim that &quot;Eyes are better witnesses than ears&quot; is echoed repeatedly throughout several of Lucian&#x27;s dialogues.

Lucian was skeptical of oracles, though he was by no means the only person of his time to voice such skepticism. Lucian rejected belief in the paranormal, regarding it as superstition. In his dialogue &quot;The Lover of Lies&quot;, he probably voices some of his own opinions through his character Tychiades, perhaps including the declaration by Tychiades that he does not believe in &quot;daemones&quot;, phantoms, or ghosts because he has never seen such things. Tychiades, however, still professes belief in the gods&#x27; existence:

According to Everett Ferguson, Lucian was strongly influenced by the Cynics. &quot;The Dream or the Cock&quot;, &quot;Timon the Misanthrope&quot;, &quot;Charon or Inspectors&quot;, and &quot;The Downward Journey or the Tyrant&quot; all display Cynic themes. Lucian was particularly indebted to Menippus, a Cynic philosopher and satirist of the third century BC. Lucian wrote an admiring biography of the philosopher Demonax, who was a philosophical eclectic, but whose ideology most closely resembled Cynicism. Demonax&#x27;s main divergence from the Cynics was that he did not disapprove of ordinary life. Paul Turner observes that Lucian&#x27;s &quot;Cynicus&quot; reads as a straightforward defense of Cynicism, but also remarks that Lucian savagely ridicules the Cynic philosopher Peregrinus in his &quot;Passing of Peregrinus&quot;.

Lucian also greatly admired Epicurus, whom he describes in &quot;Alexander the False Prophet&quot; as &quot;truly holy and prophetic&quot;. Later, in the same dialogue, he praises a book written by Epicurus:
What blessings that book creates for its readers and what peace, tranquillity, and freedom it engenders in them, liberating them as it does from terrors and apparitions and portents, from vain hopes and extravagant cravings, developing in them intelligence and truth, and truly purifying their understanding, not with torches and squills [i. e. sea onions] and that sort of foolery, but with straight thinking, truthfulness and frankness.

Lucian had a generally negative opinion of Herodotus and his historiography, which he viewed as faulty.

==Works==
Over eighty works attributed to Lucian have survived. These works belong to a diverse variety of styles and genres, and include comic dialogues, rhetorical essays, and prose fiction. Lucian&#x27;s writings were targeted towards a highly educated, upper-class Greek audience and make almost constant allusions to Greek cultural history, leading the classical scholar R. Bracht Branham to label Lucian&#x27;s highly sophisticated style &quot;the comedy of tradition&quot;. By the time Lucian&#x27;s writings were rediscovered during the Renaissance, most of the works of literature referenced in them had been lost or forgotten, making it difficult for readers of later periods to understand his works.

===&quot;A True Story&quot;===

Lucian was one of the earliest novelists in Western civilization. In &quot;A True Story&quot; (), a fictional narrative work written in prose, he parodies some of the fantastic tales told by Homer in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; and also the not-so-fantastic tales from the historian Thucydides. He anticipated modern science fiction themes including voyages to the moon and Venus, extraterrestrial life, interplanetary warfare, and artificial life, nearly two millennia before Jules Verne and H. G. Wells. The novel is often regarded as the earliest known work of science fiction.

The novel begins with an explanation that the story is not at all &quot;true&quot; and that everything in it is, in fact, a complete and utter lie. The narrative begins with Lucian and his fellow travelers journeying out past the Pillars of Heracles. Blown off course by a storm, they come to an island with a river of wine filled with fish and bears, a marker indicating that Heracles and Dionysus have traveled to this point, and trees that look like women. Shortly after leaving the island, they are caught up by a whirlwind and taken to the Moon, where they find themselves embroiled in a full-scale war between the king of the Moon and the king of the Sun over colonization of the Morning Star. Both armies include bizarre hybrid lifeforms. The armies of the Sun win the war by clouding over the Moon and blocking out the Sun&#x27;s light. Both parties then come to a peace agreement. Lucian then describes life on the Moon and how it is different from life on Earth.

After returning to Earth, the adventurers are swallowed by a 200-mile-long whale, in whose belly they discover a variety of fish people, whom they wage war against and triumph over. They kill the whale by starting a bonfire and escape by propping its mouth open. Next, they encounter a sea of milk, an island of cheese, and the Island of the Blessed. There, Lucian meets the heroes of the Trojan War, other mythical men and animals, as well as Homer and Pythagoras. They find sinners being punished, the worst of them being the ones who had written books with lies and fantasies, including Herodotus and Ctesias. After leaving the Island of the Blessed, they deliver a letter to Calypso given to them by Odysseus explaining that he wishes he had stayed with her so he could have lived eternally. They then discover a chasm in the Ocean, but eventually sail around it, discover a far-off continent and decide to explore it. The book ends abruptly with Lucian stating that their future adventures will be described in the upcoming sequels, a promise which a disappointed &quot;scholiast&quot; described as &quot;the biggest lie of all&quot;.

===Satirical dialogues===
In his &quot;Double Indictment&quot;, Lucian declares that his proudest literary achievement is the invention of the &quot;satirical dialogue&quot;, which was modeled on the earlier Platonic dialogue, but was comedic in tone rather than philosophical. The &quot;prolaliai&quot; to his &quot;Dialogues of the Courtesans&quot; suggests that Lucian acted out his dialogues himself as part of a comedic routine. Lucian&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues of the Dead&quot; () is a satirical work centering around the Cynic philosophers Diogenes and his pupil Menippus, who lived modestly while they were alive and are now living comfortably in the abysmal conditions of the Underworld, while those who had lived lives of luxury are in torment when faced by the same conditions. The dialogue draws on earlier literary precursors, including the &quot;nekyia&quot; in Book XI of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, but also adds new elements not found in them. Homer&#x27;s &quot;nekyia&quot; describes transgressors against the gods being punished for their sins, but Lucian embellished this idea by having cruel and greedy persons also be punished.

In his dialogue &quot;The Lover of Lies&quot; (), Lucian satirizes belief in the supernatural and paranormal through a framing story in which the main narrator, a skeptic named Tychiades, goes to visit an elderly friend named Eukrates. At Eukrates&#x27;s house, he encounters a large group of guests who have recently gathered together due to Eukrates suddenly falling ill. The other guests offer Eukrates a variety of folk remedies to help him recover. When Tychiades objects that such remedies do not work, the others all laugh at him and try to persuade him to believe in the supernatural by telling him stories, which grow increasingly ridiculous as the conversation progresses. One of the last stories they tell is &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, which the German playwright Goethe later adapted into a famous ballad.

Lucian frequently made fun of philosophers and no school was spared from his mockery. In the dialogue &quot;Philosophies for Sale&quot;, Lucian creates an imaginary slave market in which Zeus puts famous philosophers up for sale, including Pythagoras, Diogenes, Heraclitus, Socrates, Chrysippus, and Pyrrho, each of whom attempts to persuade the customers to buy his philosophy. In &quot;The Banquet, or Lapiths&quot;, Lucian points out the hypocrisies of representatives from all the major philosophical schools. In &quot;The Fisherman, or the Dead Come to Life&quot;, Lucian defends his other dialogues by comparing the venerable philosophers of ancient times with their unworthy contemporary followers. Lucian was often particularly critical of people who pretended to be philosophers when they really were not and his dialogue &quot;The Runaways&quot; portrays an imposter Cynic as the antithesis of true philosophy. His &quot;Symposium&quot; is a parody of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot; in which, instead of discussing the nature of love, the philosophers get drunk, tell smutty tales, argue relentlessly over whose school is the best, and eventually break out into a full-scale brawl. In &quot;&quot;, the Cynic philosopher Menippus fashions a set of wings for himself in imitation of the mythical Icarus and flies to Heaven, where he receives a guided tour from Zeus himself. The dialogue ends with Zeus announcing his decision to destroy all philosophers, since all they do is bicker, though he agrees to grant them a temporary reprieve until spring. &quot;Nektyomanteia&quot; is a dialogue written in parallel to &quot;Icaromenippus&quot; in which, rather than flying to Heaven, Menippus descends to the underworld to consult the prophet Tiresias.

Lucian wrote numerous dialogues making fun of traditional Greek stories about the gods. His &quot;Dialogues of the Gods&quot; () consists of numerous short vignettes parodying a variety of the scenes from Greek mythology. The dialogues portray the gods as comically weak and prone to all the foibles of human emotion. Zeus in particular is shown to be a &quot;feckless ruler&quot; and a serial adulterer. Lucian also wrote several other works in a similar vein, including &quot;Zeus Catechized&quot;, &quot;Zeus Rants&quot;, and &quot;The Parliament of the Gods&quot;. Throughout all his dialogues, Lucian displays a particular fascination with Hermes, the messenger of the gods, who frequently appears as a major character in the role of an intermediary who travels between worlds. &quot;The Dialogues of the Courtesans&quot; is a collection of short dialogues involving various courtesans. This collection is unique as one of the only surviving works of Greek literature to mention female homosexuality. It is also unusual for mixing Lucian&#x27;s characters from other dialogues with stock characters from New Comedy; over half of the men mentioned in &quot;Dialogues of the Courtesans&quot; are also mentioned in Lucian&#x27;s other dialogues, but almost all of the courtesans themselves are characters borrowed from the plays of Menander and other comedic playwrights.

===Treatises and letters===

Lucian&#x27;s treatise &quot;Alexander the False Prophet&quot; describes the rise of Alexander of Abonoteichus, a charlatan who claimed to be the prophet of the serpent-god Glycon. Though the account is satirical in tone, it seems to be a largely accurate report of the Glycon cult and many of Lucian&#x27;s statements about the cult have been confirmed through archaeological evidence, including coins, statues, and inscriptions. Lucian describes his own meeting with Alexander in which he posed as a friendly philosopher, but, when Alexander invited him to kiss his hand, Lucian bit it instead. Lucian reports that, aside from himself, the only others who dared challenge Alexander&#x27;s reputation as a true prophet were the Epicureans (whom he lauds as heroes) and the Christians.

Lucian&#x27;s treatise &quot;On the Syrian Goddess&quot; is a detailed description of the cult of the Syrian goddess Atargatis at Hierapolis (now Manbij). It is written in a faux-Ionic Greek and imitates the ethnographic methodology of the Greek historian Herodotus, which Lucian elsewhere derides as faulty. For generations, many scholars doubted the authenticity of &quot;On the Syrian Goddess&quot; because it seemed too genuinely reverent to have really been written by Lucian. More recently, scholars have come to recognize the book as satirical and have restored its Lucianic authorship.

In the treatise, Lucian satirizes the arbitrary cultural distinctions between &quot;Greeks&quot; and &quot;Assyrians&quot; by emphasizing the manner in which Syrians have adopted Greek customs and thereby effectively become &quot;Greeks&quot; themselves. The anonymous narrator of the treatise initially seems to be a Greek Sophist, but, as the treatise progresses, he reveals himself to actually be a native Syrian. Scholars dispute whether the treatise is an accurate description of Syrian cultural practices because very little is known about Hierapolis other than what is recorded in &quot;On the Syrian Goddess&quot; itself. Coins minted in the late fourth century BC, municipal decrees from Seleucid rulers, and a late Hellenistic relief carving have confirmed Lucian&#x27;s statement that the city&#x27;s original name was &quot;Manbog&quot; and that the city was closely associated with the cults of Atargatis and Hadad. A Jewish rabbi later listed the temple at Hierapolis as one of the five most important pagan temples in the Near East.

&quot;Macrobii&quot; (&quot;Long-Livers&quot;) is an essay about famous philosophers who lived for many years. It describes how long each of them lived, and gives an account of each of their deaths. In his treatises &quot;Teacher of Rhetoric&quot; and &quot;On Salaried Posts&quot;, Lucian criticizes the teachings of master rhetoricians. His treatise &quot;On Dancing&quot; is a major source of information about Greco-Roman dance. In it, he describes dance as an act of &quot;mimesis&quot; (&quot;imitation&quot;) and rationalizes the myth of Proteus as being nothing more than an account of a highly skilled Egyptian dancer. He also wrote about visual arts in &quot;Portraits&quot; and &quot;On Behalf of Portraits&quot;. Lucian&#x27;s biography of the philosopher Demonax eulogizes him as a great philosopher and portrays him as a hero of &quot;parrhesia&quot; (&quot;boldness of speech&quot;). In his treatise, &quot;How to Write History&quot;, Lucian criticizes the historical methodology used by writers such as Herodotus and Ctesias, who wrote vivid and self-indulgent descriptions of events they had never actually seen. Instead, Lucian argues that the historian never embellish his stories and should place his commitment to accuracy above his desire to entertain his audience. He also argues the historian should remain absolutely impartial and tell the events as they really happened, even if they are likely to cause disapproval. Lucian names Thucydides as a specific example of a historian who models these virtues.

In his satirical letter &quot;Passing of Peregrinus&quot; (), Lucian describes the death of the controversial Cynic philosopher Peregrinus Proteus, who had publicly immolated himself on a pyre at the Olympic Games of AD 165. The letter is historically significant because it preserves one of the earliest pagan evaluations of Christianity. In the letter, one of Lucian&#x27;s characters delivers a speech ridiculing Christians for their perceived credulity and ignorance, but he also affords them some level of respect on account of their morality.

In the letter &quot;Against the Ignorant Book Collector&quot;, Lucian ridicules the common practice whereby Near Easterners collect massive libraries of Greek texts for the sake of appearing &quot;cultured&quot;, but without actually reading any of them.

===Pseudo-Lucian===
Some of the writings attributed to Lucian, such as the &quot;Amores&quot; and the &quot;Ass&quot;, are usually not considered genuine works of Lucian and are normally cited under the name of &quot;Pseudo-Lucian&quot;. The &quot;Ass&quot; () is probably a summarized version of a story by Lucian, and contains largely the same basic plot elements as &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; (or &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;) of Apuleius, but with fewer inset tales and a different ending. &quot;Amores&quot; is usually dated to the third or fourth centuries based on stylistic grounds.

==Legacy==
===Byzantine===
Lucian is mentioned only sporadically between his death and the ninth century, even among pagan authors. The first author to mention him is Lactantius. He is made a character in the sixth-century letters of Aristaenetus. In the same century, portions of his &quot;On Slander&quot; were translated into Syriac as part of a monastic compendium. He was reassessed positively in the ninth century by the first generation of Byzantine humanists, such as Leo the Mathematician, Basil of Adada and Photios. In his &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, Photios notes that Lucian &quot;ridicules pagan things in almost all his texts&quot;, is never serious and never reveals his own opinion.

In the tenth century, Lucian was known in some circles as an anti-Christian writer, as seen in the works of Arethas of Caesarea and the &quot;Suda&quot; encyclopedia. The author of the &quot;Suda&quot; concludes that Lucian&#x27;s soul is burning in Hell for his negative remarks about Christians in the &quot;Passing of Peregrinus&quot;. In general, however, the Byzantine reception of Lucian was positive. He was perhaps the only ancient author openly hostile to Christianity to be received positively by the Byzantines. He was regarded as not merely a pagan, but an atheist. Even so, &quot;Lucian the atheist gave way to Lucian the master of style.&quot; From the eleventh century, he was a part of the school curriculum.

There was a &quot;Lucianic revival&quot; in the twelfth century. The preeminent Lucianic author of this period, who imitated Lucian&#x27;s style in his own works, was Theodore Prodromos. In the Norman–Arab–Byzantine culture of twelfth-century Sicily, Lucian influenced the Greek authors Philagathus of Cerami and Eugenius of Palermo.

===Renaissance and Reformation===

In the West, Lucian&#x27;s writings were mostly forgotten during the Middle Ages. When they were rediscovered in the West around 1400, they immediately became popular with the Renaissance humanists. By 1400, there were just as many Latin translations of the works of Lucian as there were for the writings of Plato and Plutarch. By ridiculing plutocracy as absurd, Lucian helped facilitate one of Renaissance humanism&#x27;s most basic themes. His &quot;Dialogues of the Dead&quot; were especially popular and were widely used for moral instruction. As a result of this popularity, Lucian&#x27;s writings had a profound influence on writers from the Renaissance and the Early Modern period.

Many early modern European writers adopted Lucian&#x27;s lighthearted tone, his technique of relating a fantastic voyage through a familiar dialogue, and his trick of constructing proper names with deliberately humorous etymological meanings. During the Protestant Reformation, Lucian provided literary precedent for writers making fun of Catholic clergy. Desiderius Erasmus&#x27;s &quot;Encomium Moriae&quot; (1509) displays Lucianic influences. Perhaps the most notable example of Lucian&#x27;s impact in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was on the French writer François Rabelais, particularly in his set of five novels, &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;, which was first published in 1532. Rabelais also is thought to be responsible for a primary introduction of Lucian to the French Renaissance and beyond through his translations of Lucian&#x27;s works.

Lucian&#x27;s &quot;True Story&quot; inspired both Sir Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot; (1516) and Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1726). Sandro Botticelli&#x27;s paintings &quot;The Calumny of Apelles&quot; and &quot;Pallas and the Centaur&quot; are both based on descriptions of paintings found in Lucian&#x27;s works. Lucian&#x27;s prose narrative &quot;Timon the Misanthrope&quot; was the inspiration for William Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; and the scene from &quot;Hamlet&quot; with the gravediggers echoes several scenes from &quot;Dialogues of the Dead&quot;. Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s famous verse &quot;Was this the face that launched a thousand ships/And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?&quot; is a paraphrase of Lucian: 

Francis Bacon called Lucian a &quot;contemplative atheist&quot;.

===Early modern period===
Henry Fielding, the author of &quot;The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling&quot; (1749), owned a complete set of Lucian&#x27;s writings in nine volumes. He deliberately imitated Lucian in his &quot;Journey from This World and into the Next&quot; and, in &quot;The Life and Death of Jonathan Wild, the Great&quot; (1743), he describes Lucian as &quot;almost ... like the true father of humour&quot; and lists him alongside Miguel de Cervantes and Jonathan Swift as a true master of satire. In &quot;The Convent Garden Journal&quot;, Fielding directly states in regard to Lucian that he had modeled his style &quot;upon that very author&quot;. Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux, François Fénelon, Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle, and Voltaire all wrote adaptations of Lucian&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues of the Dead&quot;. According to Turner, Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot; (1759) displays the characteristically Lucianic theme of &quot;refuting philosophical theory by reality&quot;. Voltaire also wrote &quot;The Conversation between Lucian, Erasmus and Rabelais in the Elysian Fields&quot;, a dialogue in which he treats Lucian as &quot;one of his masters in the strategy of intellectual revolution&quot;.

Denis Diderot drew inspiration from the writings of Lucian in his &quot;Socrates Gone Mad; or, the Dialogues of Diogenes of Sinope&quot; (1770) and his &quot;Conversations in Elysium&quot; (1780). Lucian appears as one of two speakers in Diderot&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Peregrinus Proteus&quot; (1791), which was based on &quot;The Passing of Peregrinus&quot;. Lucian&#x27;s &quot;True Story&quot; inspired Cyrano de Bergerac, whose writings later served as inspiration for Jules Verne. The German satirist Christoph Martin Wieland was the first person to translate the complete works of Lucian into German and he spent his entire career adapting the ideas behind Lucian&#x27;s writings for a contemporary German audience. David Hume admired Lucian as a &quot;very moral writer&quot; and quoted him with reverence when discussing ethics or religion. Hume read Lucian&#x27;s &quot;Kataplous&quot; or &quot;Downward Journey&quot; when he was on his deathbed. Herman Melville references Lucian in Chapter 5 of &quot;The Confidence-Man&quot;, Book 26 of , and Chapter 13 of &quot;Israel Potter&quot;.

===Modern period===
Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s epithet &quot;Phallus-Worship&quot;, which he used to describe the contemporary literature of French writers such as Honoré de Balzac and George Sand, was inspired by his reading of Lucian. &quot;Kataplous, or Downward Journey&quot; also served as the source for Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s concept of the &quot;Übermensch&quot; or &quot;Overman&quot;. Nietzsche declaration of a &quot;new and super-human way of laughing – at the expense of everything serious!&quot; echoes the exact wording of Tiresias&#x27;s final advice to the eponymous hero of Lucian&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Menippus&quot;: &quot;Laugh a great deal and take nothing seriously.&quot; Professional philosophical writers since then have generally ignored Lucian, but Turner comments that &quot;perhaps his spirit is still alive in those who, like Bertrand Russell, are prepared to flavor philosophy with wit.&quot;

Many 19th century and early 20th century classicists viewed Lucian&#x27;s works negatively. The German classicist Eduard Norden admitted that he had, as a foolish youth, wasted time reading the works of Lucian, but, as an adult, had come to realize that Lucian was nothing more than an &quot;Oriental without depth or character ... who has no soul and degrades the most soulful language&quot;. Rudolf Helm, one of the leading scholars on Lucian in the early twentieth century, labelled Lucian as a &quot;thoughtless Syrian&quot; who &quot;possesses none of the soul of a tragedian&quot; and compared him to the poet Heinrich Heine, who was known as the &quot;mockingbird in the German poetry forest&quot;. In his 1906 publication &quot;Lukian und Menipp&quot; (&quot;Lucian and Menippus&quot;), Helm argued that Lucian&#x27;s claims of generic originality, especially his claim of having invented the comic dialogue, were actually lies intended to cover up his almost complete dependence on Menippus, whom he argued was the true inventor of the genre.

Lucian&#x27;s Syrian identity received renewed attention in the early twenty-first century as Lucian became seen as what Richter calls &quot;a sort of Second Sophistic answer to early twenty-first-century questions about cultural and ethnic hybridity&quot;. Richter states that Postcolonial critics have come to embrace Lucian as &quot;an early imperial paradigm of the &#x27;ethno-cultural hybrid.

<text>A handshake is a globally widespread, brief greeting or parting tradition in which two people grasp one of each other&#x27;s hands, and in most cases, it is accompanied by a brief up-and-down movement of the grasped hands. Customs surrounding handshakes are specific to cultures. Different cultures may be more or less likely to shake hands, or there may be different customs about how or when to shake hands.
==History==

The handshake may have originated in prehistory as a demonstration of peaceful intent, since it shows that the hand holds no weapon. Another possibility is that it originated as a symbolic gesture of mutual commitment to an oath or promise: two hands clasping each other represents the sealing of a bond. One of the earliest known depictions of a handshake is an ancient Assyrian relief of the 9th century BC depicting the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III clasping the hand of the Babylonian king Marduk-zakir-shumi I to seal an alliance.
Archaeological ruins and ancient texts show that handshaking was practiced in ancient Greece (where it was called dexiosis) as early as the 5th century BC. For example, a depiction of two soldiers joining hands can be found on part of a 5th-century BC funerary stele that is on display in Berlin&#x27;s Pergamon Museum (stele SK1708) and on other funerary steles, such as one from the 4th century BC that depicts Thraseas and his wife Euandria shaking hands.

Depictions of handshakes also appear in Archaic Greek, Etruscan and Roman funerary and non-funerary art. Muslim scholars have written that the custom of handshaking was introduced to them by the people of Yemen.

==Modern customs==


There are various customs surrounding handshakes, both generally and specific to certain cultures:

The handshake is commonly done upon meeting, greeting, parting, offering congratulations, expressing gratitude, or as a public sign of completing a business or diplomatic agreement. In sports, it is also done as a sign of good sportsmanship. Its purpose is to convey trust, respect, balance, and equality. If it is done to form an agreement, the agreement is not official until the hands are parted.

Unless health issues or local customs dictate otherwise, a handshake is made usually with bare hands. It depends on the situation.

===By geographic location===
* In Anglophone countries, handshaking is common in business situations. In casual non-business situations, men are more likely to shake hands than women.
* In the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, a traditional handshake is firm, executed with the right hand, with good posture and eye contact. A handshake where both parties are standing up is deemed as good etiquette. 
* Austrians shake hands when meeting, often including with children.
* In the Netherlands and Belgium, handshakes are done more often, especially on meeting.
* In Denmark, the final step in acquiring Danish citizenship is a ceremony at which a handshake with a local official is specifically required (gloves may not be worn).
* In Norway, where a firm handshake is preferred, people most often shake hands when agreeing on deals, in private and business relations.
* In Russia, a handshake is performed between men and rarely performed by women.
* In Switzerland, it may be expected to shake the women&#x27;s hands first.
* In Israel, handshakes are standard among Jews (other than ultra-religious Jews, between genders), but not among Arabs.
* In some countries such as Turkey or the Arabic-speaking Middle East, handshakes are not as firm as in the West. Consequently, a grip that is too firm is rude. 
* Moroccans will give a soft handshake to someone of the same gender, along with one kiss on each cheek (lips don&#x27;t touch the cheek unless they are family). The handshake may be followed by lightly touching one&#x27;s heart with one&#x27;s right hand.
*In Armenia, handshakes are the most common greetings between men, optionally followed by a kiss on the cheek if the two parties have a close relationship.  Traditionally, a woman needs to wait for the man to present his hand for the handshake. Women usually greet each other with hugs and a kiss on the cheek.
* In China, age is considered important in handshake etiquette, and older people should be greeted with a handshake before others. A weak handshake is also preferred, but people shaking hands often hold on to each other&#x27;s hands for an extended period after the initial handshake.
* In Japan, there is not a tradition of shaking hands and it is preferred to formally bow to each other (with hands open by their sides). Japanese people may greet foreigners with a handshake; foreigners are advised to let Japanese people initiate any handshakes, and a weak handshake is preferred. A curious exception are so-called handshake events.
* In Korea, a senior person will initiate a handshake, which is preferred to be weak. It is a sign of respect to grasp the right arm with the left hand when shaking hands. It is considered disrespectful to put the free hand in one&#x27;s pocket while shaking hands. Bowing is the preferred and conventional way of greeting a person in Korea.
*In Thailand, handshaking is only done if the traditional &quot;wai&quot; is not offered. When a person offers a &quot;wai&quot;, placing their palms together at chest level and bowing, this is then returned, with men saying “Sawadee-krap” and women saying “Sawadee-kah” (both mean “Hello&quot;).
* In India and several nearby countries, the respectful Namaste gesture, sometimes combined with a slight bow, is traditionally used in place of handshakes. Handshakes are preferred in business and other formal settings.
*In some areas of Africa, handshakes are continually held to show that the conversation is between the two talking. If they are not shaking hands, others are permitted to enter the conversation.
* Masai men in Africa greet one another by a subtle touch of palms of their hands for a very brief moment of time.
* In Liberia, the snap handshake is customary in which the two shakers snap their fingers against each other at the conclusion of the handshake.
* In Ethiopia, it is considered rude to use the left hand during a handshake. While greeting the elderly or a person in authority, it is also customary to accompany the handshake with a bow and the left hand supporting the right.
* In Indonesia, it is considered rude to use one&#x27;s left hand as it is a hand designated for unclean duties. A medium to soft handshake grip is sufficient, since gripping too hard could be considered rude or an act of aggression.

===Other===
* Related to a handshake but more casual, some people prefer a fist bump. Typically the fist bump is done with a clenched hand. Only the knuckles of the hand are typically touched to the knuckles of the other person&#x27;s hand. Unlike the formality of a handshake, the fist bump is typically not used to seal a business deal or in formal business settings.
* The hand hug is a type of handshake popular with politicians, as it can present them as being warm, friendly, trustworthy and honest. This type of handshake involves covering the clenched hands with the remaining free hand, creating a sort of &quot;cocoon&quot;.
*In the sport of fencing, after the Olga Kharlan handshaking incident in 2023, the International Fencing Federation changed its rules so that the previously required handshakes between fencers at the end of a bout would become optional, with a distance greeting permitted instead.

== Germ spreading ==

Handshakes are known to spread a number of microbial pathogens. Certain diseases such as scabies are known to spread most frequently through direct skin-to-skin contact. A medical study has found that fist bumps and high fives spread fewer germs than handshakes. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the dean of medicine at the University of Calgary, Tom Feasby, suggested that fist bumps may be a &quot;nice replacement of the handshake&quot; in an effort to prevent transmission of the virus.

Following a 2010 study that showed that only about 40% of doctors and other health care providers complied with hand hygiene rules in hospitals, Mark Sklansky, a doctor at UCLA hospital, decided to test &quot;a handshake-free zone&quot; as a method for limiting the spread of germs and reducing the transmission of disease. UCLA did not ban the handshakes outright, but rather suggested other options such as fist bumping, smiling, bowing, waving, and non-contact &quot;Namaste&quot; gestures. Other sources suggest raised brows, , two claps, hand over heart, wave, or the sign.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, several countries and organisations adopted policies encouraging people to use alternative modes of greeting instead of a handshake. Suggested alternatives included the elbow bump, the fist bump, foot tapping or non-contact actions for social distancing purposes, such as fist-and-palm or namaste gesture. Footshaking was also suggested.

==Chemosignaling==
It has been discovered as a part of research at Israel&#x27;s Weizmann Institute that human handshakes serve as a means of transferring social chemical signals between the shakers. It appears that there is a tendency to bring the shaken hands to the vicinity of the nose and smell them. They may serve an evolutionary need to learn about the person whose hand was shaken, replacing a more overt sniffing behavior, as is common among animals and in certain human cultures (such as Tuvalu, Greenland or rural Mongolia, where a quick sniff is part of the traditional greeting ritual).

==World records==
In 1963, Lance Dowson shook 12,500 individuals&#x27; hands in hours, in Wrexham, N. Wales.
Atlantic City, New Jersey Mayor Joseph Lazarow was recognized by the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; for a July 1977 publicity stunt, in which the mayor shook more than 11,000 hands in a single day, breaking the record previously held by President Theodore Roosevelt, who had set the record with 8,510 handshakes at a White House reception on January 1, 1907.

On 27 May 2008, Kevin Whittaker and Cory Jens broke the Guinness World Record for the World&#x27;s Longest Handshake (single hand) in San Francisco, California, by shaking hands for 9 hours and 30 minutes, besting the previous record of 9 hours and 19 minutes set in 2006. This record stood briefly until 16 August 2008 when Kirk Williamson and Richard McCulley were recognized by Guinness World Records for the longest time two people shook hands uninterruptedly for 10 hours at Aloha Stadium in Aiea, Hawaii. On 21 September 2009, Jack Tsonis and Lindsay Morrison then broke that record by shaking hands for 12 hours, 34 minutes and 56 seconds. Their record was broken less than a month later in Claremont, California, when John-Clark Levin and George Posner shook hands for 15 hours, 15 minutes, and 15 seconds. The next month, on 21 November, Matthew Rosen and Joe Ackerman surpassed this feat, with a new world record time of 15 hours, 30 minutes and 45 seconds.

At 8 p.m. EST on Friday 14 January 2011 a new attempt at the longest hand-shake commenced in New York City&#x27;s Times Square and the existing record was broken by semi-professional world record-breaker Alastair Galpin.

On 29 January 2020, a new world record for the longest handshaking relay was set by approximately 1,817 people in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, at Umm Al Emarat Park in an event organized by the Abu Dhabi Police to celebrate the 1 year anniversary of the signing of the Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together in the city.

<text>Holding hands is a form of physical intimacy involving two or more people. It may or may not be romantic. Couples often hold hands while walking together outdoors. 

==Cultural aspects==

In Western culture, spouses and romantic couples often hold hands as a sign of affection or to express psychological closeness. Non-romantic friends may also hold hands, although acceptance of this varies by culture and gender role. Parents or guardians may hold the hands of small children to exercise guidance or authority. In terms of romance, handholding is often used in the early stages of dating or courtship to express romantic interest in a partner. Handholding is also common in advanced stages of a romantic relationship where it may be used to signify or seek solace and reassurance.

Same-sex couples may avoid holding hands in public due to homophobia. In 2012, an average of 74% of gay men and 51% of lesbian women responded to an EU Fundamental Rights Agency survey saying they avoid holding hands in public for fear of harassment or assault. These responses varied from 45% to 89% depending on country, with an average of 66%.

In Arab countries, North Africa, some parts of Asia and traditionally in some Mediterranean and Southern European cultures (especially in Sicily), males also hold hands for friendship and as a sign of respect; a custom which is especially noticed by societies unused to it, for instance when, in 2005, Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia held hands with the United States President George W.

<text>Márta Sebestyén (; born 19 August 1957) is a Hungarian folk vocalist, composer and actress.

==Early life==
Sebestyén was born in Budapest, Hungary. Her mother is a composer, and was a music student of Zoltán Kodály. Her father was an economist and author. When Sebestyén was seven years old, her father, returning from a trip to the U.S. as a visiting professor (under a grant from the Ford Foundation), brought home a large collection of ethnic music recordings from the Smithsonian Institution. Sebestyén was educated at Miklós Radnóti Grammar School, Budapest.

==Career==
Sebestyén is a founding member of Hungarian folk group Muzsikás. She is known for adaptations of Somogy and Erdély folk songs, some of which appear in Deep Forest&#x27;s &quot;Boheme&quot; album, which received the Grammy Award for Best World Music Album in 1995. She has also adapted Hindi, Yiddish, Serbian, Bulgarian, Slovak folk songs into traditional Hungarian style. She sang in and contributed material to the album &quot;Kaddish&quot; by Towering Inferno (Richard Wolfson and Andy Saunders, 1993). She also sang &quot;Rivers&quot; on the multiple artist album &quot;Big Blue Ball&quot; released in 2008.

Sebestyén&#x27;s song &quot;Szerelem, szerelem&quot;, performed with Muzsikás, featured in the movie &quot;The English Patient&quot; (1996). Three more songs she recorded with Muzsikás appeared in the Japanese anime film &quot;Only Yesterday&quot; (1991) by Studio Ghibli: &quot;Teremtés&quot; (&quot;Creation&quot;), &quot;Hajnali nóta&quot; (&quot;Morning Song&quot;), and &quot;Fuvom az énekem&quot; (&quot;I Sing My Song&quot;). Costa-Gavras&#x27; 1989 film &quot;Music Box&quot; featured the opening half of Sebestyén&#x27;s song &quot;Mária altatója&quot;.

On 1 June 2010, Sebestyén was awarded the UNESCO Artist for Peace title.

==Influence==
Ivor Cutler was a fan of Sebestyén, citing her influence on several occasions, most notably in an article for &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper in January 2004. Cutler selected two of her songs for a CD (&quot;Cute, eh?&quot;) released in 1999 containing his favourite musical tracks.

<doc id="165469" wikidata="Q117068" url="?curid=165469" title="Yerba mate">
<text>Yerba mate or yerba-maté (), &quot;Ilex paraguariensis&quot;, is a plant species of the holly genus native to South America. It was named by the French botanist Augustin Saint-Hilaire. The leaves of the plant can be steeped in hot water to make a beverage known as maté. Brewed cold, it is used to make &quot;tereré&quot;. Both the plant and the beverage contain caffeine.

The indigenous Guaraní and some Tupi communities (whose territory covered present-day Paraguay) first cultivated and consumed yerba mate prior to European colonization of the Americas. Its consumption was exclusive to the natives of only two regions of the territory that today is Paraguay, more specifically the departments of Amambay and Alto Paraná. After the Jesuits discovered its commercialization potential, yerba mate became widespread throughout the province and even elsewhere in the Spanish Crown.

Mate is traditionally consumed in central and southern regions of South America, primarily in Paraguay, as well as in Argentina, Uruguay, Southern Brazil, the Gran Chaco of Bolivia, and Southern Chile. It has also become popular in the Druze and Alawite community in the Levant, especially in Syria and Lebanon, where it is imported from Paraguay and Argentina, thanks to 19th-century Syrian immigrants to Argentina. Yerba mate can now be found worldwide in various energy drinks as well as being sold as a bottled or canned iced tea.

==Name and pronunciation==
The name given to the plant in the Guaraní language (of the indigenous people who first used mate) is , which has the same meaning as &#x27;herb&#x27;. , in Portuguese, a term describing several herb species, is derived from the Tupí expression &quot;,&quot; meaning something like &#x27;what keeps us alive&#x27;, but is rarely used nowadays. &quot;Mate&quot; is from the Quechua , a word that means &#x27;container for a drink&#x27; and &#x27;infusion of an herb&#x27;, as well as &#x27;gourd&#x27;. The word &quot;mate&quot; is used in modern Portuguese and Spanish.

The pronunciation of in Spanish is . The stress on the word &quot;mAte&quot; falls on the first syllable. The word is Spanish for &#x27;herb&#x27;; is the variant spelling of used throughout Latin America. &quot;Yerba&quot; may be understood as &#x27;herb&#x27;, but also as &#x27;grass&#x27; or &#x27;weed&#x27;. It may also be used in reference to marijuana (&quot;Cannabis sativa&quot;). In Argentina, refers exclusively to the plant. , therefore, originally translated as literally the &#x27;gourd herb&#x27;; i.e., the herb one drinks from a gourd.

The Portuguese name for the plant is pronounced variously as , in the areas of traditional consumption. The drinks are usually called (hot; traditionally served in a gourd), (cold; traditionally served in a bull horn), or (hot or cold; lit. &#x27;mate tea&#x27;, served in cups or glasses). While is made with roasted leaves, the other drinks are made with raw or lightly toasted green leaves, and are very popular in the south and center-west of the country. Most people, colloquially, call both the plant and the beverage by the word .

In English, both the spellings &quot;mate&quot; and &quot;maté&quot; are used to refer to the plant or the beverage. The latter spelling is unfaithful to both Spanish and Portuguese, where the accent would incorrectly move the stress from the first syllable to the second. The acute accent over the final &#x27;-e&#x27; in the English spelling was likely added by analogy with words of French origin like café, not to mark stress but to indicate that the &#x27;-e&#x27; is not silent as in &quot;mate&quot; (partner or friend); indeed French also uses the spelling with the accent. Spanish meanwhile has an unrelated word &quot;maté&quot;, meaning &#x27;I killed&#x27;, a conjugated form of the verb &quot;matar&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Ilex paraguariensis&quot; begins as a shrub and then matures to a tree, growing up to tall. The leaves are evergreen, long and wide, with serrated margins. The leaves are often called (Spanish) or (Portuguese), both of which mean &quot;herb&quot;. They contain caffeine (known in some parts of the world as mateine) and related xanthine alkaloids, and are harvested commercially.

The flowers are small and greenish-white with four petals. The fruit is a red drupe in diameter.

==History==
Mate was first consumed by the indigenous Guaraní people and also spread in the Tupí people that lived in the departments of Amambay and Alto Paraná the territory of Paraguay. Its consumption became widespread during European colonization, particularly in the Spanish colony of Paraguay in the late 16th century, among both Spanish settlers and indigenous Guaraní, who had, to some extent before the Spanish arrival, consumed it. This widespread consumption turned it into Paraguay&#x27;s main commodity above other wares, such as tobacco, and the labour of indigenous peoples was used to harvest wild stands.

In the mid-17th century, Jesuits managed to domesticate the plant and establish plantations in their Indian reductions in Misiones, Argentina, sparking severe competition with the Paraguayan harvesters of wild stands. It is here when the plant began its incursion into other non-Paraguayan territories. After their expulsion in the 1770s, their plantations fell into decay, as did their domestication secrets. The industry continued to be of prime importance for the Paraguayan economy after independence, but development in benefit of the Paraguayan state halted after the War of the Triple Alliance (1864–1870) that devastated the country both economically and demographically. Some regions with mate plantations in Paraguay became Argentine territory.

Brazil then became the largest producer of mate. In Brazilian and Argentine projects in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the plant was domesticated once again, opening the way for plantation systems. When Brazilian entrepreneurs turned their attention to coffee in the 1930s, Argentina, which had long been the prime consumer, took over as the largest producer, resurrecting the economy in Misiones Province, where the Jesuits had once had most of their plantations. For years, the status of largest producer shifted between Brazil and Argentina. Today, Brazil is the largest producer, with 53%, followed by Argentina, 37%, and Paraguay, 10%.

In the city of Campo Largo, state of Paraná, Brazil, there is a Mate Historic Park (), funded by the state government to educate people on the sustainable harvesting methods needed to maintain the integrity and vitality of the oldest wild forests of mate in the world. As of June 2014, however, the park is closed to public visitation.

==Cultivation==

The yerba mate plant is grown and processed in its native regions of South America, specifically in Paraguay, some parts of northern Argentina (Misiones), Uruguay, and southern Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paraná, and Mato Grosso do Sul). Cultivators are known as (Spanish) or (Brazilian Portuguese).

Seeds used to germinate new plants are harvested after they have turned dark purple, typically from January to April. After harvest, they are submerged in water in order to eliminate floating non-viable seeds and detritus like twigs, leaves, etc. New plants are started between March and May. For plants established in pots, transplanting takes place April through September. Plants with bare roots are transplanted only during the months of June and July.

Many of the natural enemies of yerba mate are difficult to control in plantation settings. Insect pests include &quot;Gyropsylla spegazziniana&quot;, a true bug that lays eggs in the branches; &quot;Hedyphates betulinus&quot;, a type of beetle that weakens the tree and makes it more susceptible to mold and mildew; &quot;Perigonia lusca&quot;, a moth whose larvae eat the leaves; and several species of mites. &quot;P. lusca&quot; may be controlled with a nuclear polyhedrosis virus used as a biopesticide. This was first applied in 1992.

When &quot;I. paraguariensis&quot; is harvested, the branches are often dried by a wood fire, imparting a smoky flavor. The strength of the flavor, caffeine levels, and other nutrients can vary depending on whether it is a male or female plant. Female plants tend to be milder in flavor and lower in caffeine. They are also relatively scarce in the areas where yerba mate is planted and cultivated.

According to Food and Agriculture Organization in 2012, Brazil is the biggest producer of mate in the world with 513,256 metric tonnes (MT) (58%), followed by Argentina with 290,000 MT (32%) and Paraguay with 85,490 MT (10%).

==Use as a beverage==

The infusion, called in Spanish-speaking countries and in Brazil, is prepared by filling a container, traditionally a small, hollowed-out gourd (described below), up to three-quarters full with dry leaves (and twigs) of &quot;I. paraguariensis&quot;, and filling it up with water at a temperature of , hot but not boiling. Sugar may or may not be added. The infusion may also be prepared with cold water, in which case it is known as .

Drinking mate is a common social practice in Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina, Southern Brazil, and Southern Chile among people of all ages, and is often a communal ritual following customary rules. Friends and family members share from the same container, traditionally a hollow gourd (also called a , , or simply in Spanish, a or in Portuguese, or a in Italian), and drink through the same wooden or metal straw (a in Spanish or in Portuguese). The gourd is given by the brewer to each person, often in a circle, in turns. The recipient drinks the few mouthfuls in the container, and then returns the mate to the brewer, who refills it and passes it to the next person in clockwise order. The recipient is not supposed to give thanks until they are done drinking the beverage, and if they do, they will not be served any more &quot;mates&quot;. Although traditionally made from a hollowed calabash gourd, these days mate &quot;gourds&quot; are produced from a variety of materials including wood, glass, bull horns, ceramic, and silicone.

In the same way as people meet for tea or coffee, friends often gather and drink mate () in Paraguay, Argentina, Southern Brazil, Uruguay, and Southern Chile. In warm weather the hot water is sometimes replaced by lemonade. Paraguayans typically drink yerba mate with cold water during hot days and hot water in the morning and during cooler temperatures.

Yerba mate is most popular in Paraguay and Uruguay, where people are seen walking the streets carrying the and often a (thermal vacuum flask) in their arms. In Argentina, of yerba mate is consumed annually per capita; in Uruguay, the largest consumer, consumption is . The amount of herb used to prepare the infusion is much greater than that used for tea and other beverages, which accounts for the large weights.

The flavor of brewed mate resembles an infusion of vegetables, herbs, and grass and is reminiscent of some varieties of green tea. Some consider the flavor to be very agreeable, but it is generally bitter if steeped in hot water. Sweetened and flavored mate is also sold, in which the mate leaves are blended with other herbs (such as peppermint) or citrus rind.

In Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina, a version of mate known as (or just &quot;mate&quot; or &quot;cocido&quot;) in Paraguay and in Brazil is sold in teabags and in a loose-leaf form. It is often served sweetened in specialized shops or on the street, either hot or iced, pure or with fruit juice (especially lime, known in Brazil as ) or milk. In Paraguay, Argentina, and Southern Brazil, this is commonly consumed for breakfast or in a café for afternoon tea, often with a selection of sweet pastries (&quot;facturas&quot;).

An iced, sweetened version of &quot;mate cocido&quot; is sold as an uncarbonated soft drink, with or without fruit flavoring. In Brazil, this cold version of is especially popular in the south and southeast regions, and can easily be found in retail stores in the same cooler as other soft drinks. , which is toasted, has less of a bitter flavor and more of a spicy fragrance. becomes creamy when shaken and is more popular in the coastal cities of Brazil, as opposed to the far southern states, where it is more commonly consumed in the traditional way (green, with a silver straw from a shared gourd), and called ( in Spanish, particularly Argentine Spanish).

In Paraguay, Southern Brazil (Mato Grosso do Sul, west of São Paulo and Paraná), and the Argentine littoral, a mate infusion, called in Spanish and Portuguese or sometimes in Gaúcho, Caipira and Sulista Portuguese, is also consumed as a cold or iced beverage, usually sucked out of a horn cup called a with a . The Guarani used to drink it in this format, but without the ice as they did not have the technology for it, reason why, it is accredited to be the first and original way of consumption. can be prepared with cold water (the most common way in Paraguay and Brazil) or fruit juice (the most common way in Argentina). The version with water is more bitter; fruit juice acts as a sweetener (in Brazil, this is usually avoided with the addition of table sugar). Medicinal or culinary herbs, known as (weeds), may be crushed with a pestle and mortar and added to the water for taste or medicinal reasons.

Paraguayans have a tradition of mixing mate with crushed leaves, stems, and flowers of the plant known as (the flower of August, plants of the genus &quot;Senecio&quot;, particularly &quot;Senecio grisebachii&quot;), which contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Modifying mate in this fashion is potentially toxic, as these alkaloids can cause veno-occlusive disease, a rare condition of the liver which results in liver failure due to progressive occlusion of the small venous channels.

Mate has also become popular outside of South America. In the tiny hamlet of Groot Marico, North West Province, South Africa, mate was introduced to the local tourism office by the returning descendants of the Boers, who in 1902 had emigrated to Patagonia in Argentina after losing the Anglo Boer War. It is also commonly consumed in Lebanon, Syria, and some other parts of the Middle East, mainly by Druze and Alawite people. Most of its popularity outside South America is a result of historical emigration to South America and subsequent return. It is consumed worldwide by expatriates from the Southern Cone.

Materva is a sweet, carbonated soft drink based on yerba mate. Developed in Cuba in 1920, and produced since the 1960s in Miami, Florida, it is a staple of the Cuban culture in Miami.

===Chemical composition and properties===
Yerba mate contains a variety of polyphenols, such as the flavonoids, quercetin and rutin.

Yerba mate contains three xanthines: caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline, with caffeine content varying between 0.7% and 1.7% of dry weight (compared with 0.4–9.3% for tea leaves, 2.5–7.6% in guarana, and up to 3.2% for ground coffee). Theobromine content varies from 0.3% to 0.9%; theophylline is typically present only in small quantities or sometimes completely absent. In some circles, mateine is a referential term for caffeine when found present in yerba mate (similar to theine from tea or guaranine from guarana). Yerba mate also contains minerals, such as potassium, magnesium, and manganese.

===Weight loss===
There has been no good evidence for yerba mate having an effect on body weight in humans although a later study suggested there can be positive effects.

===Cancer===

Hot maté consumption is associated with oesophageal cancer. Very hot beverages (above 65°C) are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as &quot;probably carcinogenic to humans&quot; (group 2A), which also includes hot maté, as it is typically consumed at a temperature of 70°C. This classification indicates that the link between very hot beverage consumption and cancer is likely, but the proportion of oesophageal cancer cases due to drinking very hot beverages is not yet known.&lt;ref name=&quot;IARC News-15/06/2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
There is no such association for cold maté and, in general, preparations under 65°C are not considered carcinogenic and are evaluated as &quot;not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans&quot; (group 3).
Since the traditional preparation of yerba maté leaves involves smoking them they contain a high number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), such as benzo(a)pyrene, which are carcinogenic. It has been suggested that this may explain other cancers associated with maté consumption, such as lung and bladder cancer However, the occurrence of PAHs in maté leaves and infusion is based on small studies with non-representative sampling. In any case, the use of maté with potentially lower PAHs content, such as unsmoked maté, has been suggested as a preventive approach.

<text>Kalimantan () is the Indonesian portion of the island of Borneo. It constitutes 73% of the island&#x27;s area, and consists of the provinces of Central Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, North Kalimantan, South Kalimantan, and West Kalimantan. The non-Indonesian parts of Borneo are Brunei and East Malaysia. Colloquially in Indonesia, the whole island of Borneo is also called &quot;Kalimantan&quot;.

In 2019, President of Indonesia Joko Widodo proposed that Indonesia&#x27;s capital be moved to Kalimantan. The People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly approved the Law on State Capital in January 2022. The future capital, Nusantara, is a planned city that will be carved out of East Kalimantan. A government official said construction is expected to be fully complete by 2045, but the unfinished capital officially celebrated Indonesian Independence Day for the first time and it was scheduled to be inaugurated as the capital city on 17 August 2024, but the move did not take place due to delays of construction.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Kalimantan&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit word , which means &quot;burning weather island&quot; or &quot;very hot island&quot;, referring to its hot and humid tropical climate. It consists of the two words (&quot;time, season, period&quot;) and (&quot;boiling, churning, burning&quot;) because of Indianized culture The native people of the Indonesian Borneo referred to their island as &quot;Pulu K&#x27;lemantan&quot; or &quot;Kalimantan&quot; when the sixteenth century Portuguese explorer Jorge de Menezes made contact with them. Due to Europeans encountering the Bruneian Sultanate in the north part of the island during the Age of Exploration, the entire island has come to be called Borneo in English, with Kalimantan being known as Indonesian Borneo, but this name is not used in Indonesia itself.

In the early twentieth century, the British colonist Charles Hose described Kalimantan as being home to a &quot;Klemantan people&quot;, but this term is no longer in use as Kalimantan has always had many ethnic groups.

==Area==
The Indonesian territory makes up 73% of the island by area, and 72.1% of its 2020 population of 23,053,723 (the population was 13,772,543 at the 2010 Census of Indonesia, and 16,625,796 at the 2020 Census). The non-Indonesian parts of Borneo are of Brunei (460,345 in 2020) and East Malaysia (5,967,582 in 2020), the latter comprising the states of Sabah (3,418,785) and Sarawak (2,453,677), and the federal territory of Labuan (95,120). 

Kalimantan&#x27;s total area is .

The widespread deforestation and other environmental destruction in Kalimantan and other parts of Indonesia has often been described by academics as an ecocide.

==Administrative divisions==

Kalimantan is now divided into five provinces. It was administered as one province between 1945 and 1956, but in 1956 it was split into three provinces – East Kalimantan, South Kalimantan and West Kalimantan; then in 1957, the province of Central Kalimantan was created when it was split away from the existing South Kalimantan. There remained four provinces until 25 October 2012, when North Kalimantan was split off from East Kalimantan. These are listed below with their areas in km2 and their populations at the 2010 and 2020 Censuses, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023.

<doc id="165471" wikidata="Q770764" url="?curid=165471" title="United Nations Human Rights Committee">
<text>The United Nations Human Rights Committee is a treaty body composed of 18 experts, established by a 1966 human rights treaty, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The Committee meets for three four-week sessions per year to consider the periodic reports submitted by the 173 States parties to the ICCPR on their compliance with the treaty, and any individual petitions concerning the 116 States parties to the ICCPR&#x27;s First Optional Protocol. The Committee is one of ten UN human rights treaty bodies, each responsible for overseeing the implementation of a particular treaty.

The UN Human Rights Committee should not be confused with the more high-profile UN Human Rights Council (HRC), or the predecessor of the HRC, the UN Commission on Human Rights. Whereas the Human Rights Council (since June 2006) and the Commission on Human Rights (before that date) are &quot;UN political bodies:&quot; composed of states, established by a UN General Assembly resolution and the UN Charter, and discussing the entire range of human rights concerns; the Human Rights Committee is a &quot;UN expert body:&quot; composed of persons, established by the ICCPR, and discussing matters pertaining only to that treaty. The Human Rights Committee is often referred to as CCPR (Committee on Civil and Political Rights) in order to avoid that confusion.

==Members==
The ICCPR states the basic rules for the membership of the Human Rights Committee. Article 28 of the ICCPR states that the Committee is composed of 18 members from states parties to the ICCPR, &quot;who shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights&quot;, with consideration &quot;to the usefulness of the participation of some persons having legal experience.&quot; Also according to Article 28, the members serve in their individual capacity, rather than as representatives of their countries. As stated in Articles 29 and 30 of the ICCPR, they are elected by a meeting of the states parties to the ICCPR held at UN Headquarters. Based on Article 32, they serve four-year terms, with one-half of their number elected every second year.

The current membership is as follows:

===Recent elections===
On June 17, 2022, the States parties to the ICCPR met in New York and elected nine members of the Committee, to replace those whose terms would expire at the end of 2022. There were seventeen candidates for the nine positions, including one whose nomination was late. Those elected were Yvonne Donders (The Netherlands), Hélène Tigroudja* (France), Bacre Waly Ndiaye (Senegal), Tijana Šurlan (Serbia), Koji Teraya (Japan), Farid Ahmadov (Azerbaijan), Laurence R. Helfer (United States), Rodrigo A. Carazo (Costa Rica), and Hernán Quezada Cabrera* (Chile). Asterisks denote sitting members who were re-elected. 

On September 17, 2020 (postponed from June 15, 2020), the States parties to the ICCPR met and elected nine members of the Committee, to replace those whose terms would expire at the end of 2020. There were fourteen candidates for the nine positions, not counting two who were withdrawn shortly before the election but counting one whose nomination was late (and who was elected). Those elected were Carlos Gómez Martínez (Spain), Changrok Soh (Republic of Korea), Imeru Tamerat Yigezu (Ethiopia), Mahjoub El Haiba (Morocco), José Manuel Santos Pais* (Portugal), Tania María Abdo Rocholl* (Paraguay), Wafaa Ashraf Moharram Bassim (Egypt), Kobauyah Tchamdja Kpatcha (Togo), and Marcia V.J. Kran* (Canada). Asterisks denote sitting members who were re-elected. David H. Moorre (United States) won an additional, contested &quot;by-election&quot; held on the same date, to elect a member to complete the term ending December 31, 2020, of Ilze Brands Kehris (Latvia), who had resigned effective December 31, 2019, upon her appointment as UN Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights. 

On August 28, 2018, Andreas B. Zimmermann (Germany) won an uncontested by-election to complete the term ending December 31, 2020, of Anja Seibert-Fohr (Germany), who had resigned effective March 1, 2018.

On June 14, 2018, the States parties to the ICCPR met and elected nine members of the Committee, to replace those whose terms would expire at the end of 2018. There were sixteen candidates for the nine positions, not counting two who were withdrawn shortly before the election and one whose nomination was late. Those elected were Yadh Ben Achour* (Tunisia), Christopher Bulkan (Guyana), Photini Pazartzis* (Greece), Hélène Tigroudja (France), Hernán Quezada Cabrera (Chile), Gentian Zyberi (Albania), Vasilka Sancin (Slovenia), Shuichi Furuya (Japan), and Duncan Muhumuza Laki* (Uganda). Asterisks denote sitting members who were re-elected. Pierre-Richard Prosper of the United States was not elected, in reportedly &quot;a first-ever defeat of a US candidate for the UN Human Rights Committee.&quot;

==Meetings and activities==
The Committee meets three times a year for four-week sessions (spring session at UN headquarters in New York, summer and fall sessions at the UN Office in Geneva). The categories of its work, outlined below, include state reporting, individual complaints, general comments, and inter-state communications.

==State reporting under the ICCPR==
All states parties to the ICCPR have an obligation &quot;to submit reports on the measures they have adopted which give effect to the rights recognized [in the ICCPR] and on the progress made in the enjoyment of those rights.&quot; The Human Rights Committee is responsible for &quot;study[ing]&quot; and responding to those reports submitted by states. States parties must submit an initial report within one year of the ICCPR&#x27;s entry into force, and subsequent periodic reports as requested by the Committee. This reporting system is mandated by Article 40 of the ICCPR.
The frequency of the periodic reports was formerly about every five years, but starting in 2020 is every eight years. The UN has published guidance for states on reporting to the Committee and other human rights treaty bodies. The principal purpose of the report is to promote state compliance with the treaty principles and it should be an &quot;honest appraisal of their conformity to the treaty obligations&quot;.

===Procedure, and recent procedural changes===
Following the submission of a state&#x27;s report, representatives of the state appear before the Committee in Geneva or New York to discuss the report, in an in-person constructive dialogue which is generally webcast live on UN Web TV. Following this dialogue, the Committee drafts and adopts its concluding observations, a document including positive aspects, subjects of concern, and suggestions and recommendations. Subsequently, under its follow-up procedure, the Committee assesses whether certain recommendations have been fulfilled within one year.

In July 2010, the Committee proposed a new optional reporting procedure called the &quot;List of Issues Prior to Reporting&quot; (LOIPR) or &quot;Simplified Reporting Procedure&quot;. Under this system, instead of the state submitting a full report on its implementation of each article of the ICCPR, the Committee sends the state a list of issues to address, and the state&#x27;s report must only answer the questions raised in that list of issues. The Committee subsequently adopted the simplified reporting procedure on a pilot basis, although it remains an optional alternative to the &quot;regular&quot; procedure, i.e., submission of a full report. At its 124th session in 2018, the Committee decided to adopt the simplified reporting procedure on a permanent basis, and to encourage all states to switch to simplified reporting. It also decided to strive to limit the number of questions in each list of issues to 25. In 2019, the Committee decided to make the simplified reporting procedure the default, changing a state&#x27;s selection of it from an opt-in to an opt-out model.

In July 2019 the Committee decided to move, beginning in 2020, to an eight-year &quot;Predictable Review Cycle&quot; (PRC), under which it would schedule one review for each state party (including those states that failed to report). This cycle involves a five-year review process, and a three-year interval before the next review process begins. All states parties were divided into 8 groups of 21-22 states each, with the reporting process to start for each group on a different year.

===NGO participation===
NGOs and other civil society organizations play a crucial role in the reporting process. Any NGO, regardless of accreditation, may submit its own reports (sometimes called &quot;shadow reports&quot;) to the Committee, comment on state reports, and attend all Committee sessions as observers. Furthermore, the Committee often holds a closed meeting with interested NGOs as part of its review of a state&#x27;s report.

===Limitations of the reporting system===
One set of weaknesses is inherent to a system of self-reporting. Though in theory, reports should be an honest appraisal, constructive criticism of perceived failures to adhere to Covenant principles is unlikely. The Centre for Civil and Political Rights, an NGO, states that &quot;State reports often . . . fail to describe the implementation of the Covenant in practice&quot; and &quot;frequently lack an honest evaluation of the difficulties the State faces in implementing the rights guaranteed under the Covenant.&quot;

Late reporting and non-reporting by states is another problem. The Committee&#x27;s annual report through March 2019 stated that fifteen states&#x27; &quot;initial reports are overdue, of which 7 are overdue by between 5 and 10 years and 8 are overdue by 10 years or more.&quot; The report&#x27;s Annex IV listed them; Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s initial report was 30 years overdue. That Annex also listed thirteen states whose periodic reports were ten years or more overdue, with Afghanistan&#x27;s overdue by 22 years, and Nigeria&#x27;s overdue by 19; ten states whose periodic reports were five to ten years overdue; and 28 states whose periodic reports were overdue by less than five years. CSW, a UK-based NGO, asserts that &quot;there remains a relatively low level of engagement and implementation of recommendations&quot; on the part of States, and that the level of States compliance with treaty body recommendations is only 19%.

Other widely noted problems include the backlog of the Committee and the heavy burden on states, particularly small states.

==Individual complaints to the Committee==
States that are party to the First Optional Protocol to the ICCPR (currently 116 countries) have agreed to allow persons within their jurisdiction to submit complaints (&quot;individual communications&quot;) to the Committee claiming that their rights under the ICCPR have been violated. The ICCPR is one of eight UN human rights treaties with individual complaints procedures available; two other treaties state such procedures that are not yet in force.

===Procedure===
Before considering the merits (substance) of an individual communication, the Committee must be satisfied that it is admissible. The Committee may review many factors in determining admissibility and may conclude that, for an individual communication to be admissible, it must:

*be submitted by an individual victim whose rights have been personally violated, or be submitted with sufficient authorization of such an individual, or otherwise justify the reasons for being submitted on behalf of another. The Communication cannot be anonymous;
*relate to a right actually protected under the ICCPR;
*relate to events that occurred after entry into force of the First Optional Protocol for the state in question (with some exceptions, developed by the Committee);
*be sufficiently substantiated;
*show that domestic remedies have been exhausted; 
*not be under consideration by another international investigation or settlement procedure;
*not be precluded by a reservation to the ICCPR by the state in question; and
*not be frivolous, vexatious, or otherwise an abuse of process.

Individual communications that contain the necessary prima facie elements are referred to the Committee’s Special Rapporteur on New Communications and Interim Measures, who decides whether the case should be registered. At that point, the case is transmitted to the State party, which is requested to submit its observations within six months, under Article 4 of the First Optional Protocol. Once the State replies to the complaint, the complainant is offered an opportunity to comment, within a set time frame. If the Committee concludes that a violation of the ICCPR has taken place, in its follow-up procedure the Committee invites the State to provide information within 180 days on its steps to implement the Committee&#x27;s recommendations. The State’s response is transmitted to the complainant for comments. If the State party fails to take appropriate action, the Committee keeps the case under consideration. Thus, the Committee maintains a dialogue with the State party and the case remains open until satisfactory measures are taken.

The Committee considers individual communications in closed session, but its decisions (&quot;Views&quot;) and any follow-up are public. Given the large number of complaints, several years may elapse between submission of a complaint and the Committee’s decision on it.

Information on the process and how to use it, including examples and guidelines for submitting complaints, is available from some NGOs and the United Nations.

===Decisions===
All Committee decisions on individual complaints are available in online compilations published by UN, NGO, and academic sources.

The Committee has received thousands of complaints since its inception. A few of its decisions that are notable are listed below, in reverse chronological order. Among more recent decisions that attracted press and academic attention, in two October 2018 decisions the Committee concluded that France&#x27;s ban on the niqab, the full-face Islamic veil, violated human rights guaranteed under the ICCPR, in particular the rights to manifest one&#x27;s religion or beliefs and to protection against discrimination.

==General Comments==
To date the Committee has issued 36 &quot;General Comments&quot;, each of which provides detailed guidance on particular parts of the ICCPR.

The Committee has circulated a draft of its next, forthcoming General Comment, General Comment 37 on ICCPR Article 21, the right of peaceful assembly, seeking public comments on the draft by an extended deadline of February 21, 2020. The draft has been criticized for its reliance on decisions of regional, as opposed to global, human rights bodies.

The Committee&#x27;s most recent General Comment (of October 30, 2018) was General Comment 36 on ICCPR Article 6, on the right to life (replacing General Comments 6 and 14, of 1982 and 1984, respectively). Of its seventy paragraphs, twenty address capital punishment, in a section headed &quot;The death penalty.&quot; One commentator has stated that its description of how the right to life applies during situations of armed conflict and its statement of the relationship between international human rights law and international humanitarian law are noteworthy.

In December 2014 the Committee issued General Comment 35 on ICCPR Article 9, &quot;liberty and security of person&quot;.

In July 2011, the UN Human Rights Committee adopted a 52-paragraph statement, General Comment 34 on ICCPR Article 19, concerning freedoms of opinion and expression. Paragraph 48 states: 
:Prohibitions of displays of lack of respect for a religion or other belief system, including blasphemy laws, are incompatible with the Covenant, except in the specific circumstances envisaged in article 20, paragraph 2, of the Covenant. Such prohibitions must also comply with the strict requirements of article 19, paragraph 3, as well as such articles as 2, 5, 17, 18 and 26. Thus, for instance, it would be impermissible for any such laws to discriminate in favor of or against one or certain religions or belief systems, or their adherents over another, or religious believers over non-believers. Nor would it be permissible for such prohibitions to be used to prevent or punish criticism of religious leaders or commentary on religious doctrine and tenets of faith.

==Inter-State Communications==
The Covenant provides for inter-State complaints &quot;that enables one State Party to charge another with a violation to the treaty.&quot; &quot;[N]o interstate complaint mechanism has yet been submitted&quot; (up to 2009). This is still a matter of jurisdiction and it is optional to the committee of whether or not they will accept such complaint or not.

<doc id="165472" wikidata="Q415109" url="?curid=165472" title="Acadian French">
<text>Acadian French () is a variety of French spoken by Acadians, mostly in the region of Acadia, Canada. Acadian French has seven regional accents, including Chiac and Brayon.

==Phonology==
Since there was relatively little linguistic contact with France from the late 18th century to the 20th century, Acadian French retained features that died out during the French standardization efforts of the 19th century such as these:

* The phoneme, Acadian French has retained an alveolar trill or an alveolar flap, but modern speakers pronounce it as in Parisian French: (red) can be pronounced , or .
* In nonstandard Acadian French, the third-person plural ending of verbs ‹›, such as (they eat), is still pronounced, unlike standard French (France and Quebec) ( (France)/ or (Quebec)/ ), the ‹e› can be pronounced or not, but ‹-nt› is always silent.

According to Wiesmath (2006), some characteristics of Acadian are:
*The verbal ending -ont in the third person plural
*Palatalization of and to and , respectively
*A feature called where is pronounced 
These features typically occur in the speech of older people.

Many aspects of Acadian French (vocabulary and &quot;trill r&quot;, etc.) are still common in rural areas in the South West of France. Speakers of Metropolitan French and even of other Canadian varieties of French sometimes have difficulty understanding Acadian French. Within North America, its closest relative is Louisiana French spoken in Southern Louisiana since both were born out of the same population that were affected during the Expulsion of the Acadians.

See also Chiac, a variety with strong English influence, and St. Marys Bay French, a distinct variety of Acadian French spoken around Clare, Tusket, Nova Scotia and also Moncton, New Brunswick.

===Palatalization===
&quot;not to be confused with affrication typical of Quebec French.&quot;
* and are commonly replaced by before a front vowel. For example, and are usually pronounced and . is pronounced .
* and often become (sometimes ) before a front vowel. For example, and become and in informal Acadian French. becomes . (This pronunciation led to the word Cajun, from Acadien.)

===Metathesis===
Metathesis is quite common. For example, (&#x27;Wednesday&#x27;) is , and (&#x27;poverty&#x27;) is . (the pronoun &#x27;I&#x27;) is frequently pronounced and is frequently pronounced .

In words, &quot;re&quot; is often pronounced &quot;er&quot;. For instance :
* for &quot;, for &quot;, for &quot;, for &quot;, for &quot;&quot;.

===Vowels===
* Acadian French has maintained phonemic distinctions between and , and , and , and .
* In informal speech, the vowel is realized as : (&#x27;step&#x27;) → and (arm) → , etc. 
* The short is realized as and it is the same as Parisian French.
* is open to or closed to , it depends on the region: (&#x27;party&#x27;) → or and (&#x27;case&#x27;) → or , etc. 
* The ⟨oi⟩ spelling has different pronunciations. Old speakers pronounce (&#x27;king&#x27;) , because the traditional Parisian pronunciation was like . But in modern standard Acadian French, it is pronounced . Even where there is no circumflex, there are some words which are phonemically pronounced and the phoneme is pronounced as in formal speech but in informal speech: (&#x27;three&#x27;) or and (&#x27;nut&#x27;) or . The ⟨oî⟩ spelling is phonemically , but old speakers pronounce it , while modern speakers pronounce it as in Quebec French: (&#x27;box&#x27;) or and (&#x27;grow&#x27;) or , etc.

===Elision of final consonants===
* Consonant clusters finishing a word are reduced, often losing altogether the last or two last consonants in informal speech: (&#x27;table&#x27;) → and (&#x27;book&#x27;/&#x27;pound&#x27;) → , etc.

==Vocabulary and grammar==

Yves Cormier&#x27;s (ComiersAcad) includes the majority of Acadian regionalisms. From a syntactic point of view, a major feature is the use of for the first-person singular and plural; the same phenomenon takes place with for the third persons. Acadian still differentiates the form from the form.

The following words and expressions are most commonly restricted to Acadian French south of the Miramichi River, but some are also used north of the Miramichi River and in Quebec French (also known as Québécois) or Joual for the Montreal version of Quebec French. The Miramichi line is an isogloss separating South Acadian (archaic or &quot;true&quot; Acadian) from the Canadian French dialects to the north, North Acadian, Brayon (Madawaskan) and Quebec French (Laurentian French). South Acadian typically has morphosyntactic features such as [je [V [-on] … ]] (as in &quot;we speak&quot;) that distinguishes it from dialects to the north or elsewhere in the Americas such as Cajun French, Saint-Barthélemy French or Métis French that have [nouzot [on- [V …]]] (as in ). Geddes (1908), the oldest authority on any variety of French spoken in Northern Acadia, records of the morphosyntactic characteristics of &quot;true&quot; Acadian spoken in the South and adjacent islands to the West.

Some examples of &quot;true&quot; Acadian French are:

<text>The Battle of Legnica (), also known as the Battle of Liegnitz () or Battle of Wahlstatt (), was fought between the Mongol Empire and combined European forces at the village of Legnickie Pole (&quot;Wahlstatt&quot;), approximately southeast of the city of Legnica in the Duchy of Silesia on 9 April 1241.

A combined force of Poles and Moravians under the command of Duke Henry II the Pious of Silesia, supported by feudal nobility and a few knights from military orders sent by Pope Gregory IX, attempted to halt the Mongol invasion of Poland. The battle took place two days before the Mongol victory over the Hungarians at the much larger Battle of Mohi.

==Historical disputations==
As with many historical battles, the exact details of force composition, tactics, and the actual course of the battle are lacking and sometimes contradictory.

The general historical view is that it was a crushing defeat for the Polish and Moravian forces where they suffered heavy casualties.

One of the Mongol leaders, Kadan, was frequently confused with Ögedei&#x27;s grandson Kaidu by medieval chroniclers, and thus Kaidu has often been mistakenly listed as leading the Mongol forces at Legnica.

==Background==

The Mongols considered the Cumans to have submitted to their authority, but the Cumans fled westward and sought asylum within the Kingdom of Hungary. After King Béla IV of Hungary rejected Batu Khan&#x27;s ultimatum to surrender the Cumans, Subutai began planning the Mongol invasion of Europe. Batu and Subutai were to lead two armies to attack Hungary itself, while a third under Baidar, Orda Khan and Kadan would attack Poland as a diversion to occupy northern European forces which might come to Hungary&#x27;s aid.

Orda&#x27;s forces devastated northern Poland and the southwestern border of Lithuania. Baidar and Kadan ravaged the southern part of Poland: first they sacked Sandomierz in order to draw the Northern European armies away from Hungary; then on 3 March they defeated a Polish army in the battle of Tursko; then on 18 March they defeated another Polish army at Chmielnik; on 24 March they seized and burned Kraków, and a few days later they tried unsuccessfully to capture the Silesian capital of Wrocław. While deciding whether or not to besiege Wrocław, Baidar and Kadan received reports that King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia was two days away with an army over twice the size of Henry&#x27;s. The Mongols turned from Wrocław to intercept Henry&#x27;s forces before the European armies could meet. The Mongols caught up with Henry near Legnica at Legnickie Pole (Polish for &quot;Field of Legnica&quot;), also known as Wahlstatt.

==Composition==
===Mongols===
The Mongol diversionary force, a detachment (no less than one and no more than two &quot;tumens&quot;) from the army of Subutai, demonstrated the advantages of the tactical mobility and speed of mounted archery. The Mongol tactics were essentially a long series of feigned attacks and faked withdrawals from widely dispersed groups, which were designed to inflict a constant slow drain by ranged fire, disrupt the enemy formation and draw larger numbers away from the main body into ambush and flank attacks. These were standard Mongol tactics used in virtually all of their major battles; they were made possible by continual training and superb battlefield communication, which used a system of flags. The Mongol commander found the highest ground at the battle site, seized it and used it to communicate to his noyans and lesser commanders their orders for troop movement. The Mongol system was a stark contrast to the European systems, in which knights advanced with basically no communication with supporting forces.

The numbers involved are difficult to judge. European accounts vary as to Mongol numbers—some suggest more than 100,000 at Legnica alone. These are gross overestimates, given that this number is far larger than the entire Mongol force in all of Europe at the time, as well as not taking into account the weaknesses of 13th-century Mongol logistical support in Western Eurasia. Current estimates suggest the Mongol force numbered, at most, 25,000 cavalry. The &quot;Historia Tatarorum&quot; by the Franciscan C. de Bridia Monachi suggests a Mongol force of 10,000 troops, which would have been reduced to around 8,000 after casualties suffered earlier in the campaign, at the Battle of Chmielnik, Battle of Tursko, and the Battle of Tarczek. A contemporary European account, the Ystoria Mongalorum, supports these numbers, placing the Mongol force that invaded Poland at 10,000 horsemen.

===Polish states and allies===
According to James Chambers, Henry&#x27;s force numbered at most 25,000 troops, most likely less, and had a large number of untrained and poorly equipped men, sometimes with no weapons other than the tools of their trade. Lesser trained forces included an army from Opole under Duke Mieszko II the Fat; Moravians led by Boleslav, son of the Margrave of Moravia Děpolt III; conscripts from Greater Poland; and volunteer Bavarian miners from not long before established town of Goldberg (Złotoryja). Henry&#x27;s better trained troops were his own gathered in his Silesian realm, mercenaries, and very small contingents of French Knights Templar and other foreign volunteers.

Historian Marek Cetwiński estimates the allied force to have been 2,000 strong, while Gerard Labuda estimates 7,000–8,000 soldiers in the Christian army.

A contingent of Teutonic Knights of indeterminate number is traditionally believed to have joined the allied army. However, recent analysis of the 15th-century &quot;Annals of Jan Długosz&quot; by Labuda suggests that the German crusaders may have been added to the text after chronicler Długosz had completed the work. A legend that the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, Poppo von Osterna, was killed during the battle is false, as he died at Legnica years later while visiting his wife&#x27;s nunnery. The Hospitallers have also been said to have participated in this battle, but this too seems to be a fabrication added in later accounts; neither Jan Długosz&#x27;s accounts nor the letter sent to the King of France from the Templar Master of France, Ponce d&#x27;Aubon, mention them. Peter Jackson further points out that the only military order that fought at Legnica was the Templars. The Templar contribution was very small, estimated around 68–88 well-trained, well-armed soldiers; their letter to the king of France gives their losses as three brother knights, two sergeants and 500 &#x27;men&#x27;—according to their use of the term, probably peasants working their estates and thus neither better armed or trained than the rest of the army&#x27;s infantry.

==The battle==

Henry divided his forces into four sections: the Bavarian miners led by Boleslav of Moravia; the conscripts from Greater Poland along with some Cracovians led by Sulisław, the brother of the killed palatine of Kraków; the army of Opole under Mieszko; and, under Henry&#x27;s personal command, the Silesians, Moravians, and Templars.

According to Chambers&#x27; description of the battle, the Silesian cavalry initiated combat with the vanguard (mangudai) of the Mongol army. After the Silesians were repelled, the cavalry of Greater Poland, led by Sulisław, and the cavalry of Opole then attacked the Mongols. The Mongol vanguard retreated, inducing the allied cavalry to pursue, thereby separating them from the Polish infantry. Although the mangudai fled, Mongol light cavalry flanked the Polish forces. A smokescreen was used to hide the Mongol movements and confuse the Europeans. While the Mongol light cavalry attacked from the flanks and the heavy cavalry attacked from the front, Mongol archers peppered the Polish forces with arrows.

Erik Hildinger indicates that the levies of Boleslav led the attack, instead of the Silesians. He adds that after the Polish cavalry began their pursuit during the Mongols&#x27; feigned retreat, a rider shouted &quot;Run! Run!&quot; (in Polish) to the Polish forces, confusing Mieszko, who ordered his Opole contingent to retreat from the battle. This withdrawal led Henry to order his own reserves and cavalry into the fight.

The Mongols had much success in the battle by feigning their retreat. After the Polish knights detached from the main body of allied forces in pursuit of the fleeing Mongols, the invaders were able to separate the knights from the infantry and defeat them one by one.

The &quot;Annals of Jan Długosz&quot; also describes the battle, although it was written in the 15th century, not when it actually occurred. The army of Henry II was almost destroyed—Henry and Boleslav of Moravia were killed and estimates of casualties range from 2,000 to 40,000, essentially the entire army. Ponce d&#x27;Aubon reported to King Louis IX of France that the military order lost 500 people, both in Legnica and subsequent raids on three Templar villages and two &quot;towers&quot; among them nine brothers, three knights, and two sergeants. This number likely included civilians of the villages. Mongol casualties are unknown; a perfect execution of their standard tactics would have minimized losses, but the Mongols endured sufficient casualties to dissuade them from attacking the Bohemian army.

The Mongols cut the right ear off each fallen European in order to count the dead; supposedly they filled nine sackfuls, though this has as much validity as European accounts of the numbers of Mongols. Henry was struck down and beheaded while attempting to flee the battlefield with three bodyguards, and the Mongols paraded his head on a spear before the town of Legnica.

==Conclusion==
Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, who had been a day&#x27;s march away, fell back to gather reinforcements from Thuringia and Saxony upon learning of the defeat. He was overtaken by the Mongol vanguard at Kłodzko. However, his force was far larger and more powerful than the host at Legnica, and the Mongol detachment was routed by the Bohemian cavalry. As Baidar and Kadan&#x27;s orders had been to serve as a diversion, they stayed to keep the Bohemian forces tied up, avoiding confrontation with the larger army while splitting up into bands and sacking minor towns and villages. Eventually, they turned away from Bohemia and Poland and headed southward to join Batu and Subutai, who had defeated the Hungarians at the Battle of Mohi.

Larger invasions of Poland, devoted primarily to looting, would be launched later. Led by Burundai, the Mongols successfully raided Poland in 1259–1260. They raided again under the leadership of Tulabuga and Nogai Khan, accompanied by vassal troops from Ruthenia, but were unsuccessful in 1287. Although the Mongols repeatedly expressed a desire to conquer central Europe in ultimatums up to the 1270s, Poland and Hungary stayed outside of the Golden Horde&#x27;s sphere of influence. The Russian lands to their east remained under the rule of the Golden Horde for the next two centuries.
The Battle of Legnica is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw, with the inscription &quot;LEGNICA 9 IV 1241&quot;.

<text>Mount Allison University (also Mount A or MtA) is a Canadian primarily undergraduate liberal arts university located in Sackville, New Brunswick, founded in 1839. 

Mount Allison was the first university in the British Empire to award a baccalaureate to a woman (Grace Annie Lockhart, B.Sc., 1875). It was also the first university in Canada to grant a bachelor of arts to a woman (Harriet Starr Stewart in 1882). Graduates of Mount Allison have been awarded a total of 57 Rhodes Scholarships, the highest per capita of any university in the Commonwealth of Nations.

== History ==
Mount Allison traces its roots to 1839 when a Sackville merchant proposed the creation of a school of elementary and higher learning. The university is a secular (but United Church-affiliated) primarily undergraduate liberal arts university, with classes beginning in Sackville, New Brunswick, on January 19, 1843. Mount Allison was named after Charles Frederick Allison, in honour of his gift of land and money. Its origins were steeped in the Methodist faith and it was designed to prepare men for the ministry and to supply education for lay members. The university was chartered on April 14, 1849.

In June 1839, Charles Allison was encouraged by Wesleyan Methodist minister Rev. John Bass Strong that a school of elementary and higher learning be built. Allison offered to purchase a site in Sackville to erect a suitable building for an academy and to contribute operating funds of £100 a year for 10 years. This offer was accepted and the Wesleyan Academy for boys subsequently opened in 1843.

In 1854, a women&#x27;s institution (later known as the &quot;Ladies College&quot;) was opened to complement the boys&#x27; academy. In 1858 an act of the New Brunswick Legislature authorized the trustees to establish a degree-conferring institution at Sackville, under the name of the Mount Allison Wesleyan College.

In July 1862, the degree-granting Mount Allison College was organized. The first two students, Howard Sprague and Josiah Wood, graduated in May 1863. 

For nearly a century, Mount Allison functioned as three distinct, mutually enriching parts: the college proper, the Boys&#x27; Academy, and the Ladies College. The corporate name was changed to University of Mount Allison College in 1886.

The university&#x27;s affiliation was transferred to the United Church of Canada following church union in 1925. Original components of the university included: the Mount Allison Wesleyan Academy for Boys (1840–1958), the Ladies&#x27; College (1854–1958), and Mount Allison College. Mount Allison College was established in 1862 with degree-granting powers on behalf of the other two.

The governance followed the University of Toronto Act of 1906, establishing a bicameral system with a senate managing academic policy and a board of governors overseeing financial policy and holding authority in other areas. The president, appointed by the board, served as the link between the two bodies and provided institutional leadership..

By 1920, Mount Allison University had three faculties: Arts, Theology, and Engineering. It awarded the degrees of Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Science (BSc), Bachelor of Divinity (BD), and Master of Arts. It had 246 male students and 73 female students, as well as 28 academic staff, all male.

In 1941, Mount Allison was the first university in Canada to offer a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degree in visual arts, however the teaching of art at Mount Allison can be traced back to the opening of the Women&#x27;s Academy in 1854.

The closure of the School for Girls in 1946 and the Boy&#x27;s Academy in 1953 provided space for Mount Allison University&#x27;s expansion. In 1958, construction and building acquisitions eased overcrowding. The university reaffirmed its focus on high-quality undergraduate liberal arts education and existing professional programs, opting not to pursue new professional or post-graduate courses.

The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. Mount Allison University was established by the Mount Allison University Act, 1993.

Mount Allison University&#x27;s arms and badge were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on November 15, 2007. 

Notable professors at Mount Allison include George Stanley, who designed the Canadian flag, known as the &quot;Maple Leaf&quot;. Inspired by the Royal Military College of Canada&#x27;s flag, Stanley&#x27;s design was chosen and officially adopted on February 15, 1965, now celebrated as National Flag of Canada Day. American chemist James B. Sumner, who won the 1946 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, taught and performed research at Mount Allison as a teaching fellow from 1910 to 1911.

== Academics ==
The mission statement of Mount Allison University promotes &quot;the creation and dissemination of knowledge in a community of higher learning, centred on the undergraduate student and delivered in an intimate and harmonious environment&quot;. Mount Allison currently offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in arts, science, commerce, fine arts, and music, as well as master&#x27;s degrees in biology and chemistry and biochemistry, and certificates in bilingualism. A Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Science, Arts or Commerce with a major in Aviation has been developed in conjunction with the Moncton Flight College.

The university&#x27;s enrollment was 2,288 full-time students plus 91 part-time students in Fall 2021.

== Architecture ==

Mount Allison’s campus is distinguished by its architecture, characterized by the distinctive red and olive sandstone that clads most of the buildings. The more prominent red sandstone was largely quarried in Sackville at the Pickard quarry, which was owned by the university from 1930 until it was sold to the Town of Sackville in 2022.

In most cases, the present campus is much newer than the age of the institution, which was founded in the mid-19th century. At that time, the original Mount Allison buildings were wooden clapboarded structures all painted white. Succumbing to fires or demolition, these earlier buildings have been replaced with brick or stone structures, although a unique and significant instance of early Mount Allison wooden architecture survives at the centre of campus: the President&#x27;s Cottage of 1857.

Noted architectural historian, John Leroux, who is working with visual artist Thaddeus Holownia on a book about the university&#x27;s architecture, calls the campus &quot;one of the finest in Canada&quot; and says some of the most beautiful buildings built in New Brunswick in the last 100 years are located at Mount Allison.

In particular, Leroux names the Mount Allison chapel as one of the most significant buildings in the province, saying, &quot;It is exquisite. It is nearly a perfect building.&quot; The chapel is a masterwork of the Ontario-based architecture firm of Brown, Brisley and Brown, who designed numerous new buildings and transformed the site configuration of Mount Allison in the mid- to late-1960s and early 1970s into the landscape it is today. Paramount of their scheme was the creation of the central courtyard with the chapel as a focus at one end, and the Library&#x27;s gateway colonnade overlooking the town and Convocation Hall at the other. Among the other Brown, Brisley and Brown buildings completed at Mount Allison between 1964 and 1980 are: the Gairdner Fine Arts Building, the Marjorie Young Bell Conservatory of Music, the Barclay Chemistry Building, Edwards House, Thornton House, the Ralph Pickard Bell Library, and the Harold Crabtree Building.

 Other significant buildings are the Owens Art Gallery, the oldest university art gallery in Canada, which opened in 1895, and Hammond House, the only registered National Historic Site in the Town of Sackville. Both were designed by noted Toronto architect Edmund Burke. The Queen Anne Revival-style Hammond House was originally built for Canadian artist and head of the Fine Arts department John Hammond in 1896. It now serves as the President&#x27;s residence.

Several campus buildings were designed by architect Andrew R. Cobb, including the Memorial Library (1926–27; demol. 2011), Flemington Building (1930–31), and Centennial Hall (1883–84, but redesigned by Cobb in 1933 after the original was gutted by fire).

The Memorial Library (renamed University Centre in 1970) was constructed in the Tudor-inspired Gothic Revival style. The library also included a set of plaques, now located on the ground floor atrium of the Wallace McCain Student Centre, which are listed in the Canadian Forces&#x27; National Inventory of Canadian Military Memorials – No. 13002-004. The plaques list the names of Allisonians who died at war. Every year since 1927, the names of each of the fallen are read aloud during the university&#x27;s annual Remembrance Day service.

The Wallace McCain Student Centre, originally constructed as a men&#x27;s residence (Trueman House) in 1945 and designed by Halifax architect C.A. Fowler, was gutted and repurposed in 2008, keeping the exterior form and stone walls intact.

The newest building on campus is the Purdy Crawford Centre for the Arts, which opened in 2014. Housing the Pierre Lassonde School of Fine Arts and the department of drama, the building features art studios, a large atrium, and the 100-seat Motyer-Fancy Theatre. Designed by the internationally honoured Canadian architecture firm Zeidler Partnership, it was featured in Canadian Architect magazine in March 2015.

== Social life ==

Social life at Mount Allison tends to focus on extracurricular activities: there are 140 clubs and societies and over 30 varsity, club, and intramural sports teams.

Mount Allison&#x27;s campus paper, &quot;The Argosy&quot;, is an independent publication produced weekly. The publication dates from 1872, making it one of the oldest student publications in the country. The campus and community radio station, CHMA 106.9 FM, is owned and operated by the members of Attic Broadcasting Company Ltd., a non-profit organization with its offices on the university campus.

== Student government ==

The Mount Allison Students&#x27; Union (MASU) represents all full- and part-time students at Mount Allison. It operates as a membership-based non-profit corporation and was incorporated in 1980 under the New Brunswick Companies Act.

== Administration ==

Mount Allison University 107726820RR0001 was registered as a charitable organization in Canada on January 1, 1967.

== Athletics ==
The school&#x27;s team name in Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) is the Mount Allison Mounties. The football team has appeared in the Vanier Cup national college football championship game twice (1984 &amp; 1991). The Mount Allison football team also made playoff appearances in 2007, 2008, 2010, 2013, and 2014. The team won the 2013 AUS championship, but lost to the Laval Rouge et Or in the Uteck Bowl (the national college football semi final) and in 2014, losing to McMaster in the Mitchell Bowl.

Mount Allison is also home to a CIS-level women&#x27;s hockey team, as well as swim, badminton, and soccer teams. Basketball and volleyball teams compete against colleges and other smaller universities.

Mount Allison is the winner of the first ever ACAA men&#x27;s rugby championship in 2007 and remained undefeated through 2010, resulting in four consecutive championships. In both 2008 and 2009, the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Mounties remained undefeated throughout the regular season and became ACAA champions.

<text>Nacht und Nebel (German: ), meaning Night and Fog, also known as the Night and Fog Decree, was a directive issued by Adolf Hitler on 7 December, 1941 targeting political activists and resistance &quot;helpers&quot; in the territories occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II, who were to be imprisoned, executed, or made to disappear, while the family and the population remained uncertain as to the fate or whereabouts of the alleged offender against the Nazi occupation power. Victims who disappeared in these clandestine actions were often never heard from again.

==Name==
The alliterative hendiadys &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; (German for &quot;Night and Fog&quot;) is documented in German since the beginning of the 17th century. It was used by Wagner in &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; (1869) and has since been adopted into everyday German (e.g., it appears in Thomas Mann&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;). It is not clear whether the term &quot;Nacht-und-Nebel-Erlass&quot; (&quot;Night and Fog directive&quot;) had been in wide circulation or used publicly before 1945. The designation &quot;NN&quot; was sometimes used, however, to refer to prisoners and deportees (&quot;NN-Gefangener&quot;, &quot;NN-Häftling&quot;, &quot;NN-Sache&quot;) at the time.

==Background==

Even before the Holocaust gained momentum , the Nazis had begun rounding up political prisoners - both within Germany and in occupied Europe. Most of the early prisoners were of two sorts: they were either political prisoners of personal conviction or of the belief, whom the Nazis deemed in need of &quot;re-education&quot; to Nazi ideals, or resistance leaders in occupied western Europe.

Up until the issuing of the &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; decree in December 1941, prisoners from Western Europe were handled by German soldiers in approximately the same way as by other countries: according to international agreements and procedures such as the Geneva Conventions. However, the AB-Aktion () in German-occupied Poland (carried out from 1940 onwards) presaged and paralleled the activities of , operating with similar methods.

Hitler and his upper-level staff made a critical decision not to conform to what they considered unnecessary rules, and in the process, abandoned &quot;all chivalry towards the opponent&quot; and removed &quot;every traditional restraint on warfare&quot;. During the Nuremberg trial of the High Command of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; (OKW) in 1945-1946, the head of the legal department in the OKW, Ministerial Director and General Dr. Rudolf Lehmann, testified that Hitler had literally demanded that opponents of the regime, who could not be immediately given a short trial should be brought across the border to Germany in the &quot;Night and Fog&quot; and remain isolated there.

On 7 December 1941, &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler issued the following instructions to the Gestapo: 

At the Armed Forces High Command, Wilhelm Keitel had also received a so-called &quot;Führer&#x27;s decree&quot; from Hitler on 7 December, 1941, and while this order was not documented in writing, Keitel immediately passed it on to the appropriate authorities in the form of &quot;guidelines&quot; and likewise issued a secret decree containing more detailed instructions for its implementation. Essentially, the decree was about how to more effectively combat the increasing resistance actions in the territories occupied by Germany in Western Europe after the June 1941 beginning of the Axis war against the Soviet Union. The &quot;Night and Fog&quot; decree originally concerned only nationals of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Norway. However, eventually some of those imprisoned under the came from Poland, Hungary, Greece, Yugoslavia, Slovakia, and Italy.

On 12 December, Keitel issued a directive explaining Hitler&#x27;s orders:

Three months later Keitel further expanded on this principle in a February 1942 letter stating that any prisoners not executed within eight days were to be handed over to the Gestapo and: 

Reinhard Heydrich&#x27;s &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (Security Service; SD) was given the responsibility to oversee and carry out the &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; decree. The SD was mainly an information-gathering agency, while the Gestapo operated as the main executive agency of the political police system. The decree aimed to intimidate local populations into submission, by denying friends and families of seized persons any knowledge of their whereabouts or their fate. The prisoners were secretly transported to Germany and vanished without a trace. In 1945, abandoned SD records were found to include merely names and the initials &quot;NN&quot; (&quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot;); even the sites of graves were unrecorded. The Nazis even coined a new term for those who &quot;vanished&quot; in accordance with this decree; they were &quot;vernebelt&quot;—&quot;transformed into mist&quot;. To this day, it is not known how many people disappeared as a result of this decree. The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg held that the disappearances committed as part of the &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; program were war crimes which violated both the Hague Conventions and customary international law. 

Himmler immediately communicated Keitel&#x27;s directive to various SS stations, and within six months, Richard Glücks sent the decree to the commanders of concentration camps. The &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; prisoners were mostly from France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway. They were usually arrested in the middle of the night and quickly taken to prisons hundreds of kilometres away for questioning, eventually arriving at concentration camps such as Natzweiler, Esterwegen, or Gross-Rosen, if they survived. 

Natzweiler concentration camp, in particular, became an isolation camp for political prisoners from northern and western Europe under the decree&#x27;s mandate. When the concentration camps in the east and west of German-occupied Europe were dissolved in the face of the advancing Allied armies and their inmates evacuated - often on cruel death-marches - centrally located camps such as Dachau and Mauthausen at the end of World War II filled with thousands of NN prisoners, whose special status was largely lost in the chaos of the last months before the liberation. 

Up to 30 April 1944, at least 6,639 persons had been arrested under &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; orders. Some 340 of them may have been executed. The 1956 film &quot;Night and Fog&quot;, directed by Alain Resnais, uses the term to illustrate one aspect of the concentration-camp system as it morphed into a system of labour- and death-camps.

==Text of the decrees==
==Rationale==
The reasons for &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; were many. The policy, enforced in Nazi-occupied countries, meant that whenever someone was arrested, the family would learn nothing about the person&#x27;s fate. The people arrested, sometimes only suspected resisters, were secretly sent to Germany and perhaps to a concentration camp. Whether they lived or died, the Germans would give out no information to the families involved. This was done to keep the population in occupied countries quiet by promoting an atmosphere of mystery, fear and terror.

The program made it far more difficult for other governments or humanitarian organisations to accuse the German government of specific misconduct because it obscured whether or not internment or death had even occurred, let alone the cause of the person&#x27;s disappearance. It thereby kept the Nazis from being held accountable. It allowed across-the-board, silent defiance of international treaties and conventions – one cannot apply the requirements for humane treatment in war if one cannot locate a victim or discern that victim&#x27;s fate. Additionally, the policy lessened German subjects&#x27; moral qualms about the Nazi regime, as well as their desire to speak out against it, by keeping the general public ignorant of the regime&#x27;s malfeasance and by creating extreme pressure for service members to remain silent.

==Treatment of prisoners==

The &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; prisoners&#x27; hair was shaved, and the women were given a convict costume of a thin cotton dress, wooden sandals, and a triangular black headcloth. According to historian Wolfgang Sofsky: 

Prisoners of the &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; transports were marked by broad red bands; on their backs and both trouser legs was a cross, with the letters &quot;NN&quot; to its right. From these emblems, it was possible to recognize immediately what class a prisoner belonged to and how he or she was pigeonholed and evaluated by the SS.

The prisoners were often moved apparently at random from prison to prison such as Fresnes Prison in Paris, Waldheim near Dresden, Leipzig, Potsdam, Lübeck, and Stettin. The deportees were sometimes herded 80 at a time with standing room only into slow-moving, dirty cattle wagons with little or no food or water on journeys lasting up to five days to their next unknown destination.

At the camps, the prisoners were forced to stand for hours in freezing and wet conditions at 5:00 a.m. every morning, standing strictly to attention, before being sent to work a twelve-hour day with only a twenty-minute break for a scant meal. They were confined in cold and starving conditions; many had dysentery or other illnesses, and the weakest were often beaten to death, shot, guillotined, or hanged, while the others were subjected to torture by the Germans.

When the inmates were totally exhausted or if they were too ill or too weak to work, they were then transferred to the Revier (&quot;Krankenrevier&quot;, sick barrack) or other places for extermination. If a camp did not have a gas chamber of its own, the so-called &quot;Muselmänner&quot;, or prisoners who were too sick to work, were often murdered or transferred to other concentration camps for extermination.

When the Allies liberated Paris and Brussels, the SS transported many of its remaining &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; prisoners to concentration camps deeper in Nazi-controlled territory, such as Ravensbrück concentration camp for women, Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp, Buchenwald concentration camp, Schloss Hartheim, or Flossenbürg concentration camp.

==Results==

Early in the war, the program caused the mass execution of political prisoners, especially Soviet POWs, who in early 1942, outnumbered the Jews in number of deaths even at Auschwitz. As the transports grew and Hitler&#x27;s troops moved across Europe, that ratio changed dramatically. The &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; decree was carried out surreptitiously, but it set the background for orders that would follow and established a &quot;new dimension of fear&quot;. As the war continued, so did the openness of such decrees and orders.

Despite the best attempts of Joseph Goebbels and the Propaganda Ministry (with its formidable domestic information control) to hide the program, people&#x27;s diaries and periodicals of the time show that it became progressively known to the German public. Soldiers brought back information, families on rare occasion heard from or about loved ones and Allied news sources and the BBC were able to get past censorship sporadically. Although captured archives from the SD contain numerous orders stamped with &quot;NN&quot; (&quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot;), it has never been determined exactly how many people disappeared as a result of the decree.

Doubts among the Allies about the atrocities being committed by the Nazis were pushed aside when the French entered the Natzweiler-Struthof camp (one of the &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; facilities) on 23 November, 1944, and discovered a chamber where victims were hung by their wrists from hooks to accommodate the process of pumping poisonous Zyklon-B gas into the room. Keitel later testified at the Nuremberg Trials that of all the illegal orders he had carried out, the &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; decree was &quot;the worst of all&quot;.

Former United States Supreme Court Justice and chief prosecutor at the international Nuremberg trial, Robert H. Jackson listed the &quot;terrifying&quot; &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; decree with the other crimes committed by the Nazis in his closing address. In part because of his role in carrying out this decree, Keitel was sentenced to death by hanging, despite his insistence on being shot instead due to his military service and rank. At 1:20 a.m. on 16 October 1946 Keitel defiantly shouted out, &quot;Alles für Deutschland! Deutschland über alles!&quot; just before the trapdoor opened beneath his feet.

<text>Henriette Roosenburg (26 May 1916 – 20 June 1972) was a Dutch journalist and political prisoner. Her memoir &quot;The Walls Came Tumbling Down&quot; described her attempts to return to the Netherlands from Germany after being released from prison at the end of World War II. Born in the Netherlands to an upper-class family, she was a graduate student at the University of Leiden at the start of World War II and became a courier in the Dutch resistance, where she served under the code name Zip. During this time she also wrote for the Dutch newspaper &quot;Het Parool&quot;. In 1944 she was caught and sentenced to death, and became a &quot;Night and Fog prisoner&quot; in a German prison at Waldheim.

== Start of resistance work ==

Born in The Hague to an upper-class family, Jet, as she was called by family and friends, was a graduate student at the University of Leiden at the start of World War II. During 1941, she became involved in the Dutch resistance. She started out by helping Jewish people flee or go into hiding. During 1942 and 1943, she collected information for the editors-in-chief of the influential Dutch resistance newspaper Het Parool (The Watchword).
In 1943, she was recruited as a helper on an escape line running via Belgium, France and the Pyrenees to Spain, from where escapees could travel to London. It was set up at the instruction of the Dutch government in exile in London, with the aim to have people brought over to England to inform the government on the occupied homeland and the Dutch resistance. Dutch Secret agent Piet Gerbrands, trained in England, was dropped in the Netherlands in March 1943 to organize the line. He used the assistance of the resistance group Fiat Libertas, which already ran both an escape line for Allied air men shot down over the Netherlands and an intelligence line to Brussels. The escape line for the government was to be a separate line and was given the name St John, a codename of Gerbrands&#x27;. Jet, who spoke French fluently and could pass for a Belgian citizen, worked under the alias Gaby. She took her charges to Brussels, from where the Belgian guide (&#x27;passeur&#x27;) Henri-Jean Nys assisted them to Toulouse. Secret agent Gerbrands was the first to return to London. However, the line St John only functioned briefly. The nazi counterintelligence agencies were able to disrupt the line by arresting various Dutch and Belgian helpers between the end of September and November 1943. Practically all of the members of resistance group Fiat Libertas were also arrested.

===Military espionage===

Jet, however, escaped arrest various times. When the government escape line was abandoned, she helped several allied airmen escape to Brussels. Her ability to rapidly cross the Dutch-Belgian border gained her the nickname Zip: she seemed to &#x27;zip&#x27; to and fro. The Dutch Bureau of Intelligence in London, working for the Dutch government and responsible for sending secret agents such as Gerbrands, by now knew of Jets feats and capacities. The Bureau had for some time been eager to establish a line for military intelligence. The Allied High Command was preparing an invasion on the West coast of continental Europe and needed information about the military situation in various countries. Jet was traced in Brussels by a guide who asked her to travel to Bern, Switzerland, where a group of Dutch citizens worked to collect information and send it to the Dutch government. Jet set off for Switzerland at the end of December 1943. In Bern, she received instructions to organize a new resistance group in the Netherlands to collect military information and to set up a line via Paris, France, to Switzerland. But when she returned in January 1944, the nazi&#x27;s were closing in on her. She had barely organised the intelligence line when she was caught on 1 March 1944, in Brussels, where she had traveled with intelligence for Switzerland. She was betrayed by a Belgian infiltrator who was later executed by the Belgian resistance.

===Trial and death sentence===

Jet was transferred to The Hague and interrogated severely and exhaustingly, but she managed to protect the new intelligence line and her coworkers. In July 1944, she and 19 other members of the former resistance group Fiat Libertas were moved to Utrecht, the Netherlands, for their trial. Here, Jet again met up with Nel Lind, whom she had known previously as the organizer of the escape line for Allied pilots. She also met Joke Folmer for the first time. Joke (pronounced &quot;Yo-kuh&quot;) had proven to be a competent and successful guide, who until her arrest in April 1944 had helped 320 people escape to Belgium. Half of them were Allied air men and many of them managed to return to England. Both women would become her companions until the end of the war and during their subsequent journey home. They figure prominently in &quot;The Walls came tumbling down&quot;.

The group were court-martialled by the German army on the charge of &#x27;Feindbegünstigung&#x27;, aiding and abetting the enemy, because their espionage activities and assistance to Allied pilots had undermined the interests of the German army, and had favoured enemy forces. Joke, Nel and Jet were sentenced to death; Jet even thrice, with the advice to absolutely carry out the sentence, since she was considered very dangerous.

===Escape from execution===

While their sentences were being considered for pardon, the Allied forces reached the Dutch border town of Breda at the beginning of September 1944. Many Nazis and Nazi sympathisers fled to Germany overnight; the military director of the prison in Utrecht was among them. He took the women who had been sentenced to death with him. The women were loaded into cattle wagons at the train station in Utrecht, but the procedural documents were left with the person who decided on pardons. It made them &#x27;Häftlinge ohne Papiere&#x27;, undocumented prisoners, which saved their lives. After several transfers they ended up in the German prison at Waldheim. By then they were &quot;Night and Fog prisoners&quot;, destined to disappear without a trace. They were oblivious to the fact that, in the growing chaos, confirmation of their death sentences was slowly catching up with them. They were liberated just in time. The American army was advancing from the West, but on 6 May 1945 the Soviet Army reached Waldheim and released the prisoners. Months after the end of the war, a large envelope surfaced in the Netherlands bearing the stamps of all their prisons, with dates just days after they had left.

===Waldheim prison===

At Waldheim, Henriette and the other prisoners were severely undernourished, and spent most of their free time embroidering bits of cloth with terse iconography about their experience. For instance, one section of Roosenburg&#x27;s embroidery shows a crude drawing of a gun to indicate that the prisoners had heard what they thought was Allied gunfire, as well as the names &quot;Nel&quot; and &quot;Joke&quot; in Morse code to indicate that she was in solitary confinement, that Nell and Joke were in the two adjacent cells, and that they communicated by tapping Morse code on the walls.

After their release, Henriette and four other Dutch NN prisoners (Dries, Nel, Joke, and Fafa, a Dutch NN prisoner with severe arthritis) had a chance to return to the Netherlands a few days later when the U.S. Army arrived with trucks to carry people through the Russian lines. However, Fafa&#x27;s arthritis was so severe that she could not walk; and the surrounding roads were largely unpaved and rough. The other four did not believe that Fafa would survive the trip even if there were room for her cot—and there was not room for her cot; the truck was densely packed and offered standing room only. The group had heard that the Russians intended to send displaced persons back home via Odessa, a port in Ukraine on the Black Sea; considering that too far of a side trip, Dries, Nel, Joke, and Henriette stayed behind to take Fafa to a local civilian hospital instead, and then set out on their own for the Netherlands.

The Russians had established sentries along major routes, including bridges, and were disallowing all unauthorized travel for fear German soldiers would escape along with former German POWs. Henriette and her friends, through bartering and guile, came to travel along Elbe River in a small boat from Waldheim to Coswig, where they were accosted by Russian soldiers and taken to a displaced persons camp populated by Belgians, Dutch, and Italians. On 6 June 1945 Roosenburg and a group of Dutch people were exchanged for a group of Russian POWs; they made their way to a Red Cross camp where they found that only the French and Belgians would be flying home; the rest would have to wait several weeks until a truck came. Roosenburg convinced a Dutch captain to give her group documentation stating that they were political prisoners and should have priority in transportation home; the paperwork she suggested did not mention their nationality, and so left them free to impersonate French or Belgian political prisoners. The next day Roosenburg and 15 other Dutch set out for Halle airfield, where they convinced an American soldier to allow them flight on the next plane to Belgium. Once in Belgium, the group set about calling friends and friends&#x27; friends to tell them they were alive and on their way home, and on 12 June they arrived at a monastery in the southern Netherlands where she and her friends were housed with between 1500 and 2000 others. The Netherlands had just been recently liberated and was suffering famine; as a result, trains to the north of the Netherlands only ran every three or four weeks. But Roosenburg happened to meet her cousin, Dirk Roosenburg, who had become a first lieutenant in the Dutch Army; he arranged for Henriette and her friends to be driven north the next day, where they reunited with their families.

After the war, Henriette became a correspondent for Time Inc., serving in Paris and The Hague, and then New York City for a decade. At the beginning of her stay in New York, she wrote the book &quot;The Walls Came Tumbling Down&quot; about her experience traveling from Waldheim to the Netherlands, and was later awarded the Bronze Lion of the Netherlands. She died in 1972 at the age of 56.

<text>The Jie (; Middle Chinese: ) were members of a tribe of northern China in the fourth century. During the period of the Sixteen Kingdoms, they were regarded by the Han people as one of the Five Barbarians. Under Shi Le and his family, they established the Later Zhao dynasty which dominated northern China for most of its existence from 319 to 351. The Jie ceased to play a role in Chinese history after Ran Min&#x27;s culling order and the wars that followed the collapse of Later Zhao, although some historians believe that certain prominent figures from later periods such as Hou Jing and Erzhu Rong may have been descendants of the Jie.

==Name and origins==
There are widely differing accounts of the exact ethnic origins of the Jie, with two theories uncertainly suggesting that the Jie language was either Turkic or Yeniseian. According to Sinologist Mark Edward Lewis, the Jie were of Indo-European origin (probably Iranian).

According to the &quot;Book of Wei&quot; (6th century AD), the name Jie was derived from the Jiéshì area (羯室, modern Yushe County in Shanxi province), where the Jie resided.

According to the &quot;Book of Jin&quot;, the ancestors of Shi Le were a part of the multi-ethnic Southern Xiongnu tribe known as &quot;Qiāngqú&quot; (羌渠), although by the 4th-century, Shi Le and his people were classed separate from the Xiongnu as a &quot;miscellaneous &quot;hu&quot;&quot; (雜胡; záhú) group. Edwin Pulleyblank believes the &quot;Qiangqu&quot; represent the Kangju state of Sogdia. Although Pulleyblank suggested that they might have been Tocharian in origin, most scholars believe that Kangju was constituted by an Eastern Iranian people. Some have linked the names Shi (石) and Jie (羯) to a Sogdian statelet known as 石國 &quot;Shíguó&quot; (literally, &quot;Stone Country&quot;, at Chach &quot;Zhěshí&quot; 赭時, now Tashkent, also meaning &quot;Stone City&quot; in Common Turkic). Also, An Lushan, a Tang rebel general, had a Sogdian stepfather and was called a &quot;Jiehu&quot;.

The name of the parent house of Turko-Mongol Barlas and Borjigin clans (house of Genghis Khan and Timur) was Kiyat, almost identical to the Middle Chinese pronunciation of the name Jie, &quot;/ki̯at/&quot;.

Others claim that the Jie were an ancient Yeniseian-speaking tribe related to the Ket people, who today live between the Ob and Yenisey rivers—the character 羯 (&quot;jié&quot;) is pronounced &quot;/kiɛt̚/&quot; in Hokkien, &quot;/kʰiːt̚/&quot; or &quot;/kiːt̚/&quot; in Cantonese, &quot;/ciat̚/&quot; in Hakka and &quot;ketsu&quot; in Japanese, implying that the ancient pronunciation might have been fairly close to &quot;Ket (kʰet)&quot;. The root may be transliterated as &quot;Jié&quot;- or &quot;Tsze2&quot;- and an older form, &lt; &quot;kiat&quot;, may also be reconstructed. This ethnonym might be cognate with the ethnonyms of Yeniseian-speaking peoples, such as the Ket and the Kott (who spoke the extinct Kott language, but their ethnonym is believed to have Buryat origins). Pulleyblank (1962) connected the ethnonym to Proto-Yeniseian *qeˀt/s &quot;stone&quot;. Vovin et al. (2016) also pointed to *keˀt &quot;person, human being&quot; as another possible source. Alexander Vovin also suggests that the Xiongnu spoke a Yeniseian language, further connecting them with the Jie people.

Among the Yeniseian languages, Jie is hypothesized to be Pumpokolic. Vovin, Vajda, and de la Vaissière have suggested that Jie shares the same idiosyncrasies with the Pumpokol language, and the two are therefore closely related. This argument is strengthened by the fact that in northern Mongolia, Yeniseian-derived hydronyms have been demonstrated to be exclusively Pumpokolic, while influence from other Yeniseian languages is only found further north. This therefore lends credence to the theory that the Jie are a Pumpokolic-speaking tribe, and confirms that the Pumpokolic-speaking Yeniseians existed in the core territory of the Xiongnu state.

Other sources link the Jie to the Lesser Yuezhi (&quot;Xiao Yuezhi&quot; 小月氏), who remained in China as vassals of the Xiongnu and then the Han dynasty.

According to Chen Yong, while Shi Le and his biological family were ethnically Jie, the other recorded &quot;Jie&quot; in history were from a wide array of miscellaneous &quot;hu&quot; tribes in Bing province and Hebei, who only adopted the label during the rise of Shi Le and Later Zhao. Chen asserts that Shi Le, due to the small population of the actual Jie in contrast to the numerous other &quot;hu&quot; that made up his power base, undertook ethnic policies to unite the assortment of people under a common &quot;Jie&quot; or &quot;guoren&quot; (國人; countryman) identity, which would explain the sudden spike of the Jie population around this time. He also adds that a considerable number of these &quot;hu&quot; were from the Western Regions, citing the claim of their high noses and full beards, and that there were instances of the Han Chinese becoming part of the Jie.

==History==

=== Sixteen Kingdoms ===

Most of what is known about the Jie people comes from the Later Zhao dynasty, one of the Sixteen Kingdoms that existed in the first half of the 4th-century. The earliest recorded Jie was Shi Le, a minor chieftain from Wuxiang County in Bing province (roughly modern-day Shanxi) under the Western Jin dynasty. However, his name was not originally &quot;Shi Le&quot;, as it does not appear that the Jie had family names; Instead, his original name was either Bei (㔨) or Fule (匐勒). He became chieftain by succeeding his father Zhouhezhu (周曷朱) and grandfather Yeyiyu (耶奕于) before him. When a famine struck Bing in 303, he and many other Jie and &quot;hu&quot; people became displaced. The Jin provincial inspector, looking to fund his military for an ongoing civil war, had them captured and sold into slavery. The Jie and &quot;hu&quot; were scattered around the Hebei and Shandong regions, with Shi Le himself becoming a slave.

After attaining his freedom, Shi Le became a bandit and later a rebel leader with his Han Chinese friend, Ji Sang, who gave Shi Le his name. When their rebellion was defeated in 307, Shi Le joined the Xiongnu-led Han-Zhao dynasty, where he quickly rose through the ranks and became a key commander in their war against the Western Jin. He was also effectively a powerful warlord who controlled the eastern parts of the empire and made the city of Xiangguo (襄國, in modern Xingtai, Hebei) his capital. In 319, Shi Le broke away and established the Later Zhao. He conquered his former state in 329, and while some areas remained independent, the Later Zhao became the hegemonic power of northern China, reaching a stalemate with the Eastern Jin and Cheng-Han dynasties in the south.

During his reign, Shi Le issued a ban on the word &quot;hu&quot;, replacing it with the word &quot;guoren&quot; (國人; countryman) when referring to the Jie and other miscellaneous &quot;hu&quot; tribes. Shi Le&#x27;s family also had an unusual practice of heavily adopting people into their clan. His brother, Shi Hu, for example was a distant cousin who was adopted by his father during their tribal years. Shi Le continued this practice during his rise to power, adopting the likes of Shi Hui (石会), previously Zhang Beidu (張㔨督) of a different &quot;hu&quot; tribe, as well as Shi Kan and Shi Cong, who were Han Chinese. The adopted members were turned into powerful princes and military generals. However, after Shi Le died, Shi Hu violently seized power from his biological son, Shi Hong and ascended the throne in 334. 

Shi Hu shifted the capital to Ye and ruled over northern China for roughly 15 years. Records describe him as a brutal tyrant who oppressed the common people through his excessive building projects, concubine collection and military campaigns. By the end of his reign, he was troubled by a succession crisis, and after his death in 349, his family members engaged in an internecine struggle over the throne. During the course of the conflict, Shi Hu&#x27;s adopted Han Chinese grandson, Shi Min, was promised the role of Crown Prince, but soon took control of the emperor and capital by force after his promise was reneged upon.

After surviving multiple assassination attempts, Shi Min suspected that he could not trust the Jie and tribespeople in Ye. In 349, he ordered the killing of every Jie and &quot;hu&quot; people, identifying them by their high noses and full beards. Shi Min personally led his soldiers to massacre the tribes in Ye while his generals purged their armies of tribesmen. According to some sources, more than 200,000 of them were slain, but a large portion of them were also Han Chinese who were mistaken due to their facial features. Regardless, the culling order appears to have had an adverse effect on the Jie population. Later that year, Shi Min massacred the Shi clan in Ye, changed his name to Ran Min and proclaimed himself Emperor of (Ran) Wei.

In 351, the final ruler of Later Zhao, Shi Zhi and his family were massacred in Xiangguo, bringing the dynasty to an end. The last member of the Shi clan fled to the Eastern Jin in Jiankang, but was executed upon his arrival. The remaining Jie people eventually became subjects of the Xianbei-led Former Yan, who defeated Ran Min and conquered the Hebei and Shandong regions.

=== Later history ===
Hereafter, the Jie people seemingly faded into obscurity. Despite this, there were several figures in later history who may have been of Jie ethnicity. Gai Wu, a rebel during the Northern Wei dynasty, is described in the Book of Qi as a Jiehu (羯胡), although the Book of Wei states that he was a Lushuihu instead. Both Erzhu Rong and Hou Jing, two famous warlords of the Northern Dynasties, were identified as Qihu (契胡) and Jiehu respectively, and modern scholars have suggested that they could have been be related to the Jie. The Tang dynasty rebel, An Lushan was also called a Jiehu, and according to the unearthed epitaph of Shi Chonggui, the Shi clan of Shatuo origin that ruled the Later Jin (936–947) claimed that they were descendants of Shi Le.

== Religion ==
Both Shi Le and Shi Hu endorsed Buddhism by granting the Kuchean monk, Fotu Cheng a privileged position within their government. Buddhism was at first restricted to government officials, but as the religion became increasingly popular among commoners as well, Shi Hu promoted religious freedom, stating that his people have the right to worship the Buddha, who was a &quot;foreigner&quot; like him. Under Later Zhao, Fotu Cheng&#x27;s teachings spread, and many Buddhist temples were built in northern China.

The Jie practiced cremation, which was notably a custom in the city-state of Chach in the Western Regions. Scholars have speculate that the Jie believed in Sogdian Zoroastrianism, stating that there was a temple or altar in Ye called &quot;Hutian&quot; (胡天), which was the Chinese name for the Zoroastrian god, Ahura Mazda. Due to the veneration of fire in Zoroastrianism, another example they cite is the giant lamp that was built in Shi Hu&#x27;s palace for his crowning ceremony as Heavenly King.

<text>The world line (or worldline) of an object is the path that an object traces in 4-dimensional spacetime. It is an important concept of modern physics, and particularly theoretical physics.

The concept of a &quot;world line&quot; is distinguished from concepts such as an &quot;orbit&quot; or a &quot;trajectory&quot; (e.g., a planet&#x27;s &quot;orbit in space&quot; or the &quot;trajectory&quot; of a car on a road) by inclusion of the dimension &quot;time&quot;, and typically encompasses a large area of spacetime wherein paths which are straight perceptually are rendered as curves in spacetime to show their (relatively) more absolute position states—to reveal the nature of special relativity or gravitational interactions.

The idea of world lines was originated by physicists and was pioneered by Hermann Minkowski. The term is now used most often in the context of relativity theories (i.e., special relativity and general relativity).

==Usage in physics==
A world line of an object (generally approximated as a point in space, e.g., a particle or observer) is the sequence of spacetime events corresponding to the history of the object. A world line is a special type of curve in spacetime. Below an equivalent definition will be explained: A world line is either a time-like or a null curve in spacetime. Each point of a world line is an event that can be labeled with the time and the spatial position of the object at that time.

For example, the &quot;orbit&quot; of the Earth in space is approximately a circle, a three-dimensional (closed) curve in space: the Earth returns every year to the same point in space relative to the sun. However, it arrives there at a different (later) time. The &quot;world line&quot; of the Earth is therefore helical in spacetime (a curve in a four-dimensional space) and does not return to the same point.

Spacetime is the collection of events, together with a continuous and smooth coordinate system identifying the events. Each event can be labeled by four numbers: a time coordinate and three space coordinates; thus spacetime is a four-dimensional space. The mathematical term for spacetime is a four-dimensional manifold (a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point). The concept may be applied as well to a higher-dimensional space. For easy visualizations of four dimensions, two space coordinates are often suppressed. An event is then represented by a point in a Minkowski diagram, which is a plane usually plotted with the time coordinate, say formula_1, vertically, and the space coordinate, say formula_2, horizontally. As expressed by F.R. Harvey
:A curve M in [spacetime] is called a &quot;worldline of a particle&quot; if its tangent is future timelike at each point. The arclength parameter is called proper time and usually denoted τ. The length of M is called the &quot;proper time&quot; of the particle. If the worldline M is a line segment, then the particle is said to be in free fall.

A world line traces out the path of a single point in spacetime. A world sheet is the analogous two-dimensional surface traced out by a one-dimensional line (like a string) traveling through spacetime. The world sheet of an open string (with loose ends) is a strip; that of a closed string (a loop) resembles a tube.

Once the object is not approximated as a mere point but has extended volume, it traces not a &quot;world line&quot; but rather a world tube.

==World lines as a method of describing events==
A one-dimensional &quot;line&quot; or &quot;curve&quot; can be represented by the coordinates as a function of one parameter. Each value of the parameter corresponds to a point in spacetime and varying the parameter traces out a line. So in mathematical terms a curve is defined by four coordinate functions formula_3 (where formula_4 usually denotes the time coordinate) depending on one parameter formula_5. A coordinate grid in spacetime is the set of curves one obtains if three out of four coordinate functions are set to a constant.

Sometimes, the term world line is used informally for &quot;any&quot; curve in spacetime. This terminology causes confusions. More properly, a world line is a curve in spacetime that traces out the &quot;(time) history&quot; of a particle, observer or small object. One usually uses the proper time of an object or an observer as the curve parameter formula_5 along the world line.

===Trivial examples of spacetime curves===

A curve that consists of a horizontal line segment (a line at constant coordinate time), may represent a rod in spacetime and would not be a world line in the proper sense. The parameter simply traces the length of the rod.

A line at constant space coordinate (a vertical line using the convention adopted above) may represent a particle at rest (or a stationary observer). A tilted line represents a particle with a constant coordinate speed (constant change in space coordinate with increasing time coordinate). The more the line is tilted from the vertical, the larger the speed.

Two world lines that start out separately and then intersect, signify a &quot;collision&quot; or &quot;encounter&quot;. Two world lines starting at the same event in spacetime, each following its own path afterwards, may represent e.g. the decay of a particle into two others or the emission of one particle by another.

World lines of a particle and an observer may be interconnected with the world line of a photon (the path of light) and form a diagram depicting the emission of a photon by a particle that is subsequently observed by the observer (or absorbed by another particle).

===Tangent vector to a world line: four-velocity===
The four coordinate functions formula_7
defining a world line, are real number functions of a real variable formula_5 and can simply be differentiated by the usual calculus. Without the existence of a metric (this is important to realize) one can imagine the difference between a point formula_9 on the curve at the parameter value formula_10 and a point on the curve a little (parameter formula_11) farther away. In the limit formula_12, this difference divided by formula_13 defines a vector, the tangent vector of the world line at the point formula_9. It is a four-dimensional vector, defined in the point formula_9. It is associated with the normal 3-dimensional velocity of the object (but it is not the same) and therefore termed four-velocity formula_16, or in components:
formula_17

such that the derivatives are taken at the point formula_9, so at formula_19.

All curves through point p have a tangent vector, not only world lines. The sum of two vectors is again a tangent vector to some other curve and the same holds for multiplying by a scalar. Therefore, all tangent vectors for a point p span a linear space, termed the tangent space at point p. For example, taking a 2-dimensional space, like the (curved) surface of the Earth, its tangent space at a specific point would be the flat approximation of the curved space.

==World lines in special relativity==

So far a world line (and the concept of tangent vectors) has been described without a means of quantifying the interval between events. The basic mathematics is as follows: The theory of special relativity puts some constraints on possible world lines. In special relativity the description of spacetime is limited to &quot;special&quot; coordinate systems that do not accelerate (and so do not rotate either), termed inertial coordinate systems. In such coordinate systems, the speed of light is a constant. The structure of spacetime is determined by a bilinear form η, which gives a real number for each pair of events. The bilinear form is sometimes termed a &quot;spacetime metric&quot;, but since distinct events sometimes result in a zero value, unlike metrics in metric spaces of mathematics, the bilinear form is &quot;not&quot; a mathematical metric on spacetime.

World lines of freely falling particles/objects are called geodesics. In special relativity these are straight lines in Minkowski space.

Often the time units are chosen such that the speed of light is represented by lines at a fixed angle, usually at 45 degrees, forming a cone with the vertical (time) axis. In general, useful curves in spacetime can be of three types (the other types would be partly one, partly another type):

* light-like curves, having at each point the speed of light. They form a cone in spacetime, dividing it into two parts. The cone is three-dimensional in spacetime, appears as a line in drawings with two dimensions suppressed, and as a cone in drawings with one spatial dimension suppressed.


* time-like curves, with a speed less than the speed of light. These curves must fall within a cone defined by light-like curves. In our definition above: world lines are time-like curves in spacetime.
* space-like curves falling outside the light cone. Such curves may describe, for example, the length of a physical object. The circumference of a cylinder and the length of a rod are space-like curves.

At a given event on a world line, spacetime (Minkowski space) is divided into three parts.

* The future of the given event is formed by all events that can be reached through time-like curves lying within the future light cone.
* The past of the given event is formed by all events that can influence the event (that is, that can be connected by world lines within the past light cone to the given event).
** The lightcone at the given event is formed by all events that can be connected through light rays with the event. When we observe the sky at night, we basically see only the past light cone within the entire spacetime.
* Elsewhere is the region between the two light cones. Points in an observer&#x27;s elsewhere are inaccessible to them; only points in the past can send signals to the observer. In ordinary laboratory experience, using common units and methods of measurement, it may seem that we look at the present, but in fact there is always a delay time for light to propagate. For example, we see the Sun as it was about 8 minutes ago, not as it is &quot;right now&quot;. Unlike the present in Galilean/Newtonian theory, the elsewhere is thick; it is not a 3-dimensional volume but is instead a 4-dimensional spacetime region.
** Included in &quot;elsewhere&quot; is the simultaneous hyperplane, which is defined for a given observer by a space that is hyperbolic-orthogonal to their world line. It is really three-dimensional, though it would be a 2-plane in the diagram because we had to throw away one dimension to make an intelligible picture. Although the light cones are the same for all observers at a given spacetime event, different observers, with differing velocities but coincident at the event (point) in the spacetime, have world lines that cross each other at an angle determined by their relative velocities, and thus they have different simultaneous hyperplanes.
** The present often means the single spacetime event being considered.

===Simultaneous hyperplane===
Since a world line formula_20 determines a velocity 4-vector formula_21 that is time-like, the Minkowski form formula_22 determines a linear function formula_23 by formula_24 Let &quot;N&quot; be the null space of this linear functional. Then &quot;N&quot; is called the simultaneous hyperplane with respect to &quot;v&quot;. The relativity of simultaneity is a statement that &quot;N&quot; depends on &quot;v&quot;. Indeed, &quot;N&quot; is the orthogonal complement of &quot;v&quot; with respect to η. 
When two world lines &quot;u&quot; and &quot;w&quot; are related by formula_25 then they share the same simultaneous hyperplane. This hyperplane exists mathematically, but physical relations in relativity involve the movement of information by light. For instance, the traditional electro-static force described by Coulomb&#x27;s law may be pictured in a simultaneous hyperplane, but relativistic relations of charge and force involve retarded potentials.

==World lines in general relativity==
The use of world lines in general relativity is basically the same as in special relativity, with the difference that spacetime can be curved. A metric exists and its dynamics are determined by the Einstein field equations and are dependent on the mass-energy distribution in spacetime. Again the metric defines lightlike (null), spacelike, and timelike curves. Also, in general relativity, world lines include timelike curves and null curves in spacetime, where timelike curves fall within the lightcone. However, a lightcone is not necessarily inclined at 45 degrees to the time axis. However, this is an artifact of the chosen coordinate system, and reflects the coordinate freedom (diffeomorphism invariance) of general relativity. Any timelike curve admits a comoving observer whose &quot;time axis&quot; corresponds to that curve, and, since no observer is privileged, we can always find a local coordinate system in which lightcones are inclined at 45 degrees to the time axis. See also for example Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates.

World lines of free-falling particles or objects (such as planets around the Sun or an astronaut in space) are called geodesics.

==World lines in quantum field theory==
Quantum field theory, the framework in which all of modern particle physics is described, is usually described as a theory of quantized fields. However, although not widely appreciated, it has been known since Feynman that many quantum field theories may equivalently be described in terms of world lines. This preceded much of his work on the formulation which later became more standard. The world line formulation of quantum field theory has proved particularly fruitful for various calculations in gauge theories and in describing nonlinear effects of electromagnetic fields.

==World lines in literature==
In 1884 C. H. Hinton wrote an essay &quot;What is the fourth dimension ?&quot;, which he published as a scientific romance. He wrote
:Why, then, should not the four-dimensional beings be ourselves, and our successive states the passing of them through the three-dimensional space to which our consciousness is confined.

A popular description of human world lines was given by J. C. Fields at the University of Toronto in the early days of relativity. As described by Toronto lawyer Norman Robertson:
:I remember [Fields] lecturing at one of the Saturday evening lectures at the Royal Canadian Institute. It was advertised to be a &quot;Mathematical Fantasy&quot;—and it was! The substance of the exercise was as follows: He postulated that, commencing with his birth, every human being had some kind of spiritual aura with a long filament or thread attached, that traveled behind him throughout his life. He then proceeded in imagination to describe the complicated entanglement every individual became involved in his relationship to other individuals, comparing the simple entanglements of youth to those complicated knots that develop in later life.

Kurt Vonnegut, in his novel &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, describes the worldlines of stars and people: 
:“Billy Pilgrim says that the Universe does not look like a lot of bright little dots to the creatures from Tralfamadore. The creatures can see where each star has been and where it is going, so that the heavens are filled with rarefied, luminous spaghetti. And Tralfamadorians don&#x27;t see human beings as two-legged creatures, either. They see them as great millepedes – &quot;with babies&#x27; legs at one end and old people&#x27;s legs at the other,&quot; says Billy Pilgrim.”

Almost all science-fiction stories which use this concept actively, such as to enable time travel, oversimplify this concept to a one-dimensional timeline to fit a linear structure, which does not fit models of reality. Such time machines are often portrayed as being instantaneous, with its contents departing one time and arriving in another—but at the same literal geographic point in space. This is often carried out without note of a reference frame, or with the implicit assumption that the reference frame is local; as such, this would require either accurate teleportation, as a rotating planet, being under acceleration, is not an inertial frame, or for the time machine to remain in the same place, its contents &#x27;frozen&#x27;.

Author Oliver Franklin published a science fiction work in 2008 entitled &quot;World Lines&quot; in which he related a simplified explanation of the hypothesis for laymen.

In the short story &quot;Life-Line&quot;, author Robert A. Heinlein describes the world line of a person:

:He stepped up to one of the reporters. &quot;Suppose we take you as an example. Your name is Rogers, is it not? Very well, Rogers, you are a space-time event having duration four ways. You are not quite six feet tall, you are about twenty inches wide and perhaps ten inches thick. In time, there stretches behind you more of this space-time event, reaching to perhaps nineteen-sixteen, of which we see a cross-section here at right angles to the time axis, and as thick as the present. At the far end is a baby, smelling of sour milk and drooling its breakfast on its bib. At the other end lies, perhaps, an old man someplace in the nineteen-eighties.

:&quot;Imagine this space-time event that we call Rogers as a long pink worm, continuous through the years, one end in his mother&#x27;s womb, and the other at the grave...&quot;

Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot; uses the term, as does James Blish&#x27;s &quot;The Quincunx of Time&quot; (expanded from &quot;Beep&quot;).

A visual novel named Steins;Gate, produced by 5pb., tells a story based on the shifting of world lines. Steins;Gate is a part of the &quot;Science Adventure&quot; series. World lines and other physical concepts like the Dirac Sea are also used throughout the series.

Neal Stephenson&#x27;s novel Anathem involves a long discussion of worldlines over dinner in the midst of a philosophical debate between Platonic realism and nominalism.

Absolute Choice depicts different world lines as a sub-plot and setting device.

A space armada trying to complete a (nearly) closed time-like path as a strategic maneuver forms the backdrop and a main plot device of &quot;Singularity Sky&quot; by Charles Stross.

<doc id="165492" wikidata="Q233950" url="?curid=165492" title="Daniel Kahneman">
<text>Daniel Kahneman (; ; March 5, 1934 – March 27, 2024) was an Israeli-American psychologist best known for his work on the psychology of judgment and decision-making as well as behavioral economics, for which he was awarded the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences together with Vernon L. Smith. Kahneman&#x27;s published empirical findings challenge the assumption of human rationality prevailing in modern economic theory. Kahneman became known as the &quot;grandfather of behavioral economics.&quot;

With Amos Tversky and others, Kahneman established a cognitive basis for common human errors that arise from heuristics and biases, and developed prospect theory. In 2011, Kahneman was named by &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine in its list of top global thinkers. In the same year, his book &quot;Thinking, Fast and Slow&quot;, which summarizes much of his research, was published and became a best seller. In 2015, &quot;The Economist&quot; listed him as the seventh most influential economist in the world.

Kahneman was professor emeritus of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University&#x27;s Princeton School of Public and International Affairs. Kahneman was a founding partner of TGG Group, a business and philanthropy consulting company. He was married to cognitive psychologist and Royal Society Fellow Anne Treisman, who died in 2018.

== Early life ==
Daniel Kahneman was born in Tel Aviv, Mandatory Palestine, on March 5, 1934. His parents were Lithuanian Jews who had emigrated to France in the early 1920s. He spent his childhood years in Paris. Kahneman and his family were in Paris when it was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1940. His father, Efrayim, was picked up in the first major round-up of French Jews, but he was released after six weeks due to the intervention of his employer, La Cagoule backer Eugène Schueller. The family was on the run for the remainder of the war but survived except for Efrayim who died 
of diabetes in 1944. Kahneman and his family then moved to British Mandatory Palestine in 1948, just before the creation of the state of Israel.

Kahneman wrote of his experience in Nazi-occupied France, explaining in part why he entered the field of psychology:
== Education and early career ==
In 1954, Kahneman received his Bachelor of Science degree, with a major in psychology and a minor in mathematics, from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Israeli intellectual Yeshayahu Leibowitz, whom Kahneman describes as influential in his intellectual development, was Kahneman&#x27;s chemistry teacher at Beit-Hakerem High School, and Kahneman&#x27;s physiology professor at university. Kahneman was average in mathematics, but he thrived in psychology. Kahneman was led to psychology when he discovered in his teens that he was more interested in why people believe in God than in whether God exists, and more interested in indignation than in ethics.

In 1954, he began his military service as a second lieutenant, serving for a year in infantry. He then served in the psychology department of the Israeli Defense Forces. He developed a structured interview for combat recruits, which remained in use in the IDF for several decades. Kahneman describes his military service as a &quot;very important period&quot; in his life.

In 1958, he went to the United States to study for his PhD in Psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. His 1961 dissertation, advised by Susan Ervin, examined relations between adjectives in the semantic differential and allowed him to &quot;engage in two of [his] favorite pursuits: the analysis of complex correlational structures and FORTRAN programming&quot;.

== Academic career ==

=== Cognitive psychology ===
Kahneman received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology and mathematics from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1954 and a degree in psychology from the University of California, Berkeley，in 1961, and went on to become a lecturer in psychology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem later in 1961 and was promoted to senior lecturer in 1966. His early work focused on visual perception and attention. From 1965 to 1966, he was a visiting scientist at the University of Michigan, a fellow at the Center for Cognitive Studies and a lecturer in cognitive psychology at Harvard University in 1966 to 1967, and during the summers of 1968 and 1969 he was a visiting scientist at the Applied Psychology Research Unit in Cambridge. His work on attention led to a book, &quot;Attention and Effort&quot;, in which he presented a theory of effort based on studies of pupillary changes during mental tasks. Kahneman also developed rules of counterfactual thinking, and published &quot;Norm Theory&quot; with Dale Miller.

=== Judgment and decision-making ===
Kahneman&#x27;s lengthy collaboration with Amos Tversky began in 1969, after Tversky gave a guest lecture at one of Kahneman&#x27;s seminars at Hebrew University. Their first jointly written paper, &quot;Belief in the Law of Small Numbers,&quot; was published in 1971. They published seven journal articles in the years 1971 to 1979. They flipped a coin to determine whose name would appear first on their initial paper and alternated thereafter. Their article &quot;Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases&quot; introduced the notion of anchoring. Kahneman and Tversky spent an entire year at an office in the Van Leer Institute in Jerusalem, writing this paper. They spent more than three years revising an early version of prospect theory that was completed in early 1975. The final version was published in 1979 in &quot;Econometrica&quot;, the leading economic journal at the time. That paper became the most cited in economics. Its success was due to its synthesis of ideas and results discussed at the time about economic behavior under risk in a simple model, whose predictions were systematically supported by psychological experiments.

The pair also teamed with Paul Slovic to edit a compilation entitled &quot;Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases&quot; (1982) that was a summary of their work and of other recent advances that had influenced their thinking. Kahneman was ultimately awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 2002 &quot;for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty&quot;. In the introduction of &quot;Thinking, Fast and Slow&quot;, Kahneman acknowledges and shares that &quot;our collaboration on judgment and decision making was the reason for the Nobel Prize that I received in 2002, which Amos Tversky would have shared had he not died, aged fifty-nine, in 1996&quot;. Kahneman left Hebrew University in 1978 to take a position at the University of British Columbia. In 2021, Kahneman co-authored a book with Olivier Sibony and Cass Sunstein, titled &quot;.&quot;

The Harvard psychologist and author Steven Pinker said of Kahneman that: &quot;His central message could not be more important, namely, that human reason left to its own devices is apt to engage in a number of fallacies and systematic errors, so if we want to make better decisions in our personal lives and as a society, we ought to be aware of these biases and seek workarounds. That&#x27;s a powerful and important discovery.&quot;

=== Behavioral economics ===
Kahneman and Tversky both spent the academic year 1977 to 1978 at Stanford University, Kahneman as a fellow at the school&#x27;s Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences interdisciplinary research lab and Tversky with a visiting appointment at the university&#x27;s psychology department. Richard Thaler was a visiting professor at the Stanford branch of the National Bureau of Economic Research during that same year. According to Kahneman: &quot;We soon became friends, and have ever since had a considerable influence on each other&#x27;s thinking.&quot; Building in part on prospect theory and Kahneman and Tversky&#x27;s body of work, Thaler published &quot;Toward a Positive Theory of Consumer Choice&quot; in 1980, a paper which Kahneman called &quot;the founding text of behavioral economics&quot;. Richard Thaler obtained a grant from the Russell Sage Foundation to spend the academic year 1984 to 1985 with Kahneman at the University of British Columbia. Together with Kahneman&#x27;s friend Jack Knetsch they worked on two papers on fairness and on the endowment effect.

From 1979 to 1986, Kahneman published multiple articles and chapters. Kahneman published one chapter during the years 1987 to 1989. A few papers on decision making appeared after that hiatus, notably cumulative prospect theory, and an explanation of risk-taking by unrealistic &quot;bold forecasts&quot;, but the focus of Kahneman&#x27;s research from that time was the study of subjective experience.

=== Variants of utility ===
Economists distinguish experienced utility—in the sense of Jeremy Bentham and utilitarianism—from decision utility, which is the utility explained by and derived from choices. The experienced utility of an episode is formalized as the temporal integration of momentary utility.

Kahneman further distinguished the expected utility from both remembered and predicted utility. Predicted utility (better known as affective forecasting) is the predicted experienced utility for a future experience. Remembered utility is the evaluation of a past experience. The essential finding of many experiments is that memories of experienced utility are systematically inaccurate. Furthermore, the remembered evaluation of past episodes (remembered utility) is the best predictor of subsequent decision utility.

One of the cognitive biases of remembered utility is called the peak–end rule. It affects how people remember the pleasantness or unpleasantness of experiences. It states that a person&#x27;s overall impression of past events is determined, for the most part, not by the total pleasure and suffering it contained, but by how it felt at its peak and at its end. For example, the memory of a painful colonoscopy is improved if the examination is extended by three minutes in which the scope is still inside but not moved anymore, resulting in a moderately uncomfortable sensation. This extended colonoscopy, despite involving more pain overall, is remembered less negatively due to the reduced pain at the end. This even increases the likelihood for the patient to return for subsequent procedures.

==== Happiness and life satisfaction ====
The analysis of the experienced utility of short episodes readily extends to the broader notion of happiness. This connection led Kahneman, together with Ed Diener and Norbert Schwarz to organize a workshop, which yielded a book that covered a range of topics in hedonic psychology, which they defined as &quot;the study of what makes experiences and life pleasant or unpleasant. It is concerned with feelings of pleasure and pain, of interest and boredom, of joy and sorrow, and of satisfaction and dissatisfaction. It is also concerned with the whole range of circumstances, from the biological to the societal, that occasion suffering and enjoyment.

Most studies of well-being use retrospective questions such as &quot;How happy are you these days?&quot;. A smaller number of studies use experience sampling, in which people are probed at random times during the day, and asked to rate their experience of the present moment. Much later (source TED talk) Kahneman described this distinction in terms of two selves: the experiencing self, which is aware of pleasure and pain as they are happening, and the remembering self, which shows the aggregate pleasure and pain over an extended period of time.

Kahneman initially believed that the happiness of the experiencing self is the true measure of well-being. Around 2000, he assembled a team consisting of Alan Krueger, David Schkade, Norbert Schwarz and Arthur Stone. The mission of the team was to create a measure of experienced happiness that economists could take seriously. As a more practical substitute to the experience sampling techniques of the time, the team developed The Day-Reconstruction Method, in which participants described the day as a sequence of episodes, and rated the experience on several affective dimensions. Kahneman also participated in the formulation of the well-being module of the Gallup World Poll. The effort to measure experienced happiness was only partly successful. Measures of affect are routinely included in well-being questionnaires, but the idea that experienced happiness is the better concept did not hold. Kahneman defined happiness in terms of &quot;what I experience here and now&quot;, but says that in reality humans pursue life satisfaction, which &quot;is connected to a large degree to social yardsticks—achieving goals, meeting expectations&quot;.

==== Focusing illusion ====
With David Schkade, Kahneman developed the notion of the focusing illusion to explain in part the mistakes people make when estimating the effects of different scenarios on their future happiness (also known as affective forecasting, which has been studied extensively by Daniel Gilbert). The &quot;illusion&quot; occurs when people consider the impact of one specific factor on their overall happiness, they tend to greatly exaggerate the importance of that factor, while overlooking the numerous other factors that would in most cases have a greater impact. In what has been considered his most famous dictum, Kahneman described the illusion in &quot;Thinking, Fast and Slow&quot;, writing: “Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.”

A good example is provided by Kahneman and Schkade&#x27;s 1998 paper, &quot;Does living in California make people happy? A focusing illusion in judgments of life satisfaction&quot;. In that paper, students in the Midwest and in California reported similar levels of life satisfaction, but the Midwesterners thought their Californian peers would be happier. The only distinguishing information the Midwestern students had when making these judgments was the fact that their hypothetical peers lived in California. Thus, they &quot;focused&quot; on this distinction, thereby overestimating the effect of the weather in California on its residents&#x27; satisfaction with life.

=== Teaching ===
Kahneman taught at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem from 1970–1978. He then became a professor at the University of British Columbia, leaving in 1986. Next, he taught at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1986 to 1994. Thereafter, Kahneman was a senior scholar and faculty member emeritus at Princeton University&#x27;s Department of Psychology and Princeton School of Public and International Affairs. He was also a fellow at Hebrew University and a Gallup Senior Scientist.

== Partnership with Amos Tversky ==
Kahneman and Amos Tversky&#x27;s collaboration helped launch the field of behavioral economics.

Kahneman and Tversky first crossed paths in the Psychology department at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1968. In the period between 1971 and 1979 they published work on judgment and decision-making that led to Kahneman winning the Nobel Prize. During this period they were described as “inseparable” and as “soul mates”.

After leaving Israel in 1978 and accepting positions at different universities, the intensity and exclusivity of their earlier period of joint collaboration was reduced. According to Kahneman the collaboration &quot;tapered off&quot; in the early 1980s, although they tried to revive it, but the period when Kahneman published almost exclusively with Tversky ended in 1983, when he published two papers with Anne Treisman, his wife since 1978. Factors contributing to this estrangement included Tversky receiving most of the external credit for the output of the partnership, and a reduction in the generosity with which Tversky and Kahneman interacted with each other, leading Kahneman to say, “I eventually divorced him”. However, they would continue to publish together until the end of Tversky&#x27;s life, and worked together on the introduction to an edited collection of papers related to their work during the last six month&#x27;s of Tversky&#x27;s life.

== Personal life ==
Kahneman&#x27;s first wife was Irah Kahneman, an Israeli social researcher, with whom he had two children. They were later divorced. Kahneman&#x27;s daughter, Lenore Shoham, who works in technology, collaborated with her father on his Nobel lecture. His son, Michael Kahneman, has schizophrenia; Kahneman was quoted as saying that Michael &quot;would have been a very brilliant economist.&quot;

His second wife was the cognitive psychologist Anne Treisman, from 1978 until her death in 2018. They lived part-time in Berkeley, California. From 2020, he lived in New York City with Barbara Tversky, the widow of his long-time collaborator Amos Tversky.

Kahneman&#x27;s paternal uncle was Rabbi Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman, the head of the Ponevezh Yeshiva.

In 2015, Kahneman said he had always been &quot;far on the left of the spectrum in Israeli politics&quot;. He described himself as a very hard worker, &quot;a worrier&quot; and &quot;not a jolly person&quot;, who is &quot;quite capable of great enjoyment, and I&#x27;ve had a great life&quot;. Richard Thaler called his close friend an &quot;avid pessimist.&quot; Thaler, a self-described optimist stated that he failed to convince Kahneman to spend less time worrying as Kahneman &quot;claimed this was rational because he would not be disappointed as much with the outcomes of life.&quot;

Kahneman died on March 27, 2024, three weeks after his 90th birthday. Former colleague and Princeton faculty member, Eldar Shafir said that Kahneman &quot;was a giant in the field&quot; and that &quot;many areas in the social sciences simply have not been the same since he arrived on the scene. He will be greatly missed.&quot; Behavioural economist Richard Thaler said Kahneman&#x27;s work was &quot;one of the most important accomplishments of 20th century science,&quot; and added, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to think of any psychologist whose work has influenced so many different fields.&quot; Kahneman and Tversky were “the founders of our field”, said Ulrike Malmendier, a behavioral economist and member of the German official council of economic experts.

<text>Amos Nathan Tversky (; March 16, 1937 – June 2, 1996) was an Israeli cognitive and mathematical psychologist and a key figure in the discovery of systematic human cognitive bias and handling of risk.

Much of his early work concerned the foundations of measurement. He was co-author of a three-volume treatise, &quot;Foundations of Measurement&quot;. His early work with Daniel Kahneman focused on the psychology of prediction and probability judgment; later they worked together to develop prospect theory, which aims to explain irrational human economic choices and is considered one of the seminal works of behavioral economics.

Six years after Tversky&#x27;s death, Kahneman received the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for work he did in collaboration with Amos Tversky. While Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously, Kahneman has commented that he feels &quot;it is a joint prize. We were twinned for more than a decade.&quot;

Tversky also collaborated with many leading researchers including Thomas Gilovich, Itamar Simonson, Paul Slovic and Richard Thaler. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Tversky as the 93rd most cited psychologist of the 20th century, tied with Edwin Boring, John Dewey, and Wilhelm Wundt.

==Early life and education==
Tversky was born in Haifa, British Palestine (now Israel), as son of the Polish-born veterinarian Yosef Tversky and Lithuanian Jewish Jenia Tversky (née Ginzburg), a social worker who later became a member of the Knesset representing the Mapai (Workers&#x27; Party). Tversky had one sister, Ruth, thirteen years his senior.

Tversky&#x27;s mother has said he was self-taught in many areas, including mathematics. In high school, Tversky took classes from literary critic Baruch Kurzweil, and befriended classmate Dahlia Ravikovich, who would become an award-winning poet.

Tversky received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel in 1961, and his doctorate in psychology from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in 1965. He had already developed a clear vision of researching judgement.

==Military service and career==
During this time he was also a member and leader in Nahal, an Israel Defense Forces program that combined compulsory military service with the establishment of agricultural settlements.

Tversky served with distinction in the Israel Defense Forces as a paratrooper, rising to the rank of captain and being decorated for bravery. He parachuted in combat zones during the Suez Crisis in 1956, commanded an infantry unit during the Six-Day War in 1967, and served in a psychology field-unit during the Yom Kippur War in 1973.

==Academic career==

===Academic roles===
After his doctorate, Tversky taught at Hebrew University. He then joined the faculty in the Department of Psychology of Stanford University in 1978, where he spent the rest of his career.

===Academic work===

====Work with Daniel Kahneman====
Amos Tversky&#x27;s most influential work was done with his longtime collaborator, Daniel Kahneman, in a partnership that began in the late 1960s. Their work explored the biases and failures in rationality continually exhibited in human decision-making. Starting with their first paper together, &quot;Belief in the Law of Small Numbers&quot;, Kahneman and Tversky laid out eleven &quot;cognitive illusions&quot; that affect human judgment, frequently using small-scale empirical experiments that demonstrate how subjects make irrational decisions under uncertain conditions. (They introduced the notion of cognitive bias in 1972.) This work was highly influential in the field of economics, which had largely presumed rationality of all actors.

According to Kahneman the collaboration &#x27;tapered off&#x27; in the early 1980s, although they tried to revive it. Factors included Tversky receiving most of the external credit for the output of the partnership, and a reduction in the generosity with which Tversky and Kahneman interacted with each other.

====Comparative ignorance====
Tversky and Fox (1995) addressed ambiguity aversion, the idea that people do not like ambiguous gambles or choices with ambiguity, with the comparative ignorance framework. Their idea was that people are only ambiguity averse when their attention is specifically brought to the ambiguity by comparing an ambiguous option to an unambiguous option. For instance, people are willing to bet more on choosing a correct colored ball from an urn containing equal proportions of black and red balls than an urn with unknown proportions of balls when evaluating both of these urns at the same time. However, when evaluating them separately, people are willing to bet approximately the same amount on either urn. Thus, when it is possible to compare the ambiguous gamble to an unambiguous gamble people are averse — but not when one is ignorant of this comparison.

====Notable contributions====

* foundations of measurement
* anchoring and adjustment
* availability heuristic
* base rate fallacy
* conjunction fallacy
* framing
* behavioral finance
* clustering illusion
* loss aversion
* prospect theory
* cumulative prospect theory
* representativeness heuristic
* Tversky index
* support theory
* contrast model
* feature matching account of similarity

===Approach to research===
Kahneman said that Tversky &quot;had simply perfect taste in choosing problems, and he never wasted much time on anything that was not destined to matter. He also had an unfailing compass that always kept him going forward.

Tversky&#x27;s 1974 Science article with Kahneman on cognitive illusions triggered a &quot;cascade of related research,&quot; Science News wrote in a 1994 article tracing the recent history of research on reasoning. Decision theorists in economics, business, philosophy and medicine as well as psychologists cited their work.

===Recognition===
In 1980, he became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 1984 he was a recipient of the MacArthur Fellowship, and in 1985 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. Tversky, as a co-recipient with Daniel Kahneman, earned the 2003 University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for Psychology.

After Tversky&#x27;s death, Kahneman was awarded the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for the work he did in collaboration with Tversky. Nobel prizes are not awarded posthumously.

==Personality and characteristics==
Kahneman has said &quot;Amos was the freest person I have known, and he was able to be free because he was also one of the most disciplined.&quot;

Persi Diaconis, a professor of mathematics at Stanford, has said &quot;You were happy being in his presence. There was a light shining out of him.&quot;

Gerhard Casper, President of Stanford University, said Tversky &quot;maintained the highest standards of professional ethics&quot;, and &quot;His dedication to Stanford and its institutions of faculty governance was exemplary.&quot;

Whilst being very collaborative, Tversky also had a lifelong habit of working alone at night while others slept.

In intellectual debate Tversky &quot;wanted to crush the opposition&quot;.

Tversky believed that humans live under uncertainty, in a probabilistic universe.

==Personal life==
In 1963, Tversky married American psychologist Barbara Gans, who later became a professor in the human-development department at Teachers College, Columbia University. They had three children together.

He died of a metastatic melanoma in 1996.

He was a Jewish atheist.

==In popular culture==

===Tversky intelligence test===
As recounted by Malcolm Gladwell in 2013&#x27;s &quot;David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants&quot;, Tversky&#x27;s peers thought so highly of him that they devised a tongue-in-cheek one-part test for measuring intelligence. As related to Gladwell by psychologist Adam Alter, the Tversky intelligence test was &quot;The faster you realized Tversky was smarter than you, the smarter you were.&quot;

===&quot;The Undoing Project&quot;===
Michael Lewis&#x27;s book &quot;The Undoing Project: A Friendship That Changed Our Minds&quot;, released in 2016, is about Tversky&#x27;s personal and professional relationship with Daniel Kahneman.

<doc id="165497" wikidata="Q16550783" url="?curid=165497" title="Duchy of Anhalt">
<text>The Duchy of Anhalt () was a historical German duchy. The duchy was located between the Harz Mountains in the west and the River Elbe and beyond to the Fläming Heath in the east. The territory was once ruled by the House of Ascania, and is now part of the federal state of Saxony-Anhalt.

==History==

Anhalt&#x27;s origins lie in the Principality of Anhalt, a state of the Holy Roman Empire.

===Dukes of Anhalt===
During the 9th century, most of Anhalt was part of the Duchy of Saxony. In the 12th century, it came under the rule of Albert the Bear, margrave of Brandenburg. Albert was descended from Albert, count of Ballenstedt, whose son Esico (died 1059 or 1060) appears to have been the first to bear the title of count of Anhalt. Esico&#x27;s grandson, Otto the Rich, count of Ballenstedt, was the father of Albert the Bear, who united Anhalt with the Margraviate of Brandenburg (March of Brandenburg). When Albert died in 1170, his son Bernard, who received the title of duke of Saxony in 1180, became count of Anhalt. Bernard died in 1212, and Anhalt, separated from Saxony, passed to his son Henry I, who in 1218 took the title of prince and was the real founder of the house of Anhalt.

===Princes of Anhalt===

Over the next six hundred years multiple divisions of the Anhalt principality took place as younger sons were granted appanages and founded lines of their own. These divisions included:
*Anhalt-Bernburg 1252–1468, 1603–1863
*Anhalt-Dessau 1396–1561, 1603–1863
*Anhalt-Köthen 1396–1562, 1603–1853
*Anhalt-Plötzkau 1544–1553, 1603–1665
*Anhalt-Zerbst 1252–1396, 1544–1796

===19th century duchies===
In 1806, Napoleon elevated the remaining states of Anhalt-Bernburg, Anhalt-Dessau and Anhalt-Köthen to duchies (Anhalt-Plötzkau and Anhalt-Zerbst had ceased to exist in the meantime). These duchies were united in 1863 to form a united Anhalt again due to the extinction of the Köthen and Bernburg lines. The new duchy consisted of two large portions – Eastern and Western Anhalt, separated by the interposition of a part of the Prussian Province of Saxony – and of five enclaves surrounded by Prussian territory: Alsleben, Muhlingen, Dornburg, Gödnitz and Tilkerode-Abberode. The eastern and larger portion of the duchy was enclosed by the Prussian government district of Potsdam (in the Prussian Province of Brandenburg), Province of Magdeburg and Merseburg (belonging to the Prussian Province of Saxony). The western or smaller portion (the so-called Upper Duchy or Ballenstedt) was also enclosed by the two latter districts and by the Duchy of Brunswick.

The capital of Anhalt (at the times when it was a united state) was Dessau.

In 1918, Anhalt became a state within the Weimar Republic (see Free State of Anhalt). After World War II it was united with the Prussian parts of Saxony in order to form the new state of Saxony-Anhalt. Having been dissolved in 1952, the state was reestablished prior to the German reunification and is now part of the Bundesland Saxony-Anhalt in Germany.

====Constitution====
The duchy, by virtue of a fundamental law, proclaimed on September 17, 1859 and subsequently modified by various decrees, was a constitutional monarchy. The duke, who was addressed as &quot;Highness,&quot; wielded the executive power while sharing the legislation with the estates. The diet (Landtag) was composed of thirty-six members, of whom two were appointed by the duke, eight were representatives of landowners paying the highest taxes, two of the highest assessed members of the commercial and manufacturing classes, fourteen of the other electors of the towns and ten of the rural districts. The representatives were chosen for six years by indirect vote and must have completed their twenty-fifth year. The duke governed through a minister of state, who was the praeses of all the departments—finance, home affairs, education, public worship and statistics.

==Geography==
In the west, the land is undulating and in the extreme southwest, where it forms part of the Harz range, mountainous, the Ramberg peak being the tallest at 1900 ft (579 m). From the Harz, the country gently slopes down to the Saale; between this river and the Elbe is fertile country. East of the Elbe, the land is mostly a flat sandy plain, with extensive pine forests, interspersed with bog-land and rich pastures. The Elbe is the chief river, intersecting the eastern portion of the former duchy, from east to west, and at Rosslau is met by the Mulde. The navigable Saale takes a northerly direction through the western portion of the eastern part of the territory and receives, on the right, the Fuhne and, on the left, the Wipper and the Bode.

The climate is generally mild, less so in the higher regions to the south-west. The area of the former duchy is . The population was 203,354 in 1871 and 328,007 in 1905.

The country was divided into the districts of Dessau, Köthen, Zerbst, Bernburg and Ballenstedt with Bernburg being the most, and Ballenstedt the least. Four towns, namely Dessau, Bernburg, Köthen and Zerbst, had populations exceeding 20,000. The inhabitants of the former duchy, who were primarily upper Saxons, belonged, with the exception of about 12,000 Roman Catholics and 1700 Jews, to the Evangelical Church. The supreme ecclesiastical authority was the consistory in Dessau; while a synod of 39 members, elected for six years, assembled at periods to deliberate on internal matters touching the organization of Church of Anhalt. The Roman Catholics were under the Bishop of Paderborn.

<text>Avril Ramona Lavigne ( ; ; born September 27, 1984) is a Canadian singer and songwriter. She is a key musician in the development of pop-punk music, as she paved the way for female-driven, punk-influenced pop music in the early 2000s. Her accolades include eight Grammy Award nominations.

At age 16, Lavigne signed a two-album recording contract with Arista Records. Her debut album, &quot;Let Go&quot; (2002), is the best-selling album of the 21st century by a Canadian artist. It yielded the successful singles &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;, which emphasized a skate punk persona and earned her the title &quot;Pop-Punk Queen&quot; and &quot;Pop Punk Princess&quot; from music publications. Her second album, &quot;Under My Skin&quot; (2004), became Lavigne&#x27;s first to reach the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in the United States, going on to sell 10 million copies worldwide.

Lavigne&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Best Damn Thing&quot; (2007), reached number one in seven countries worldwide and saw the international success of its lead single &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, which became her first single to reach the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States. Her next two albums, &quot;Goodbye Lullaby&quot; (2011) and &quot;Avril Lavigne&quot; (2013), saw continued commercial success and were both certified gold in Canada, the United States, and other territories. After releasing her sixth album, &quot;Head Above Water&quot; (2019), she returned to her pop punk roots with her seventh album, &quot;Love Sux&quot; (2022).

==Early life==
Avril Ramona Lavigne was born on September 27, 1984, in Belleville, Ontario. She was named Avril (the French word for April) by her father. He and Lavigne&#x27;s mother recognized their child&#x27;s vocal abilities when she was two years old and sang &quot;Jesus Loves Me&quot; on the way home from church. Lavigne has an older brother named Matthew and a younger sister named Michelle, both of whom teased her when she sang. &quot;My brother used to knock on the wall because I used to sing myself to sleep and he thought it was really annoying.&quot; She is the sister-in-law of Japanese band One OK Rock bassist Ryota Kohama. Lavigne&#x27;s paternal grandfather Maurice Yves Lavigne was born in Saint-Jérôme, Quebec. A member of the Royal Canadian Air Force, he married Lucie Dzierzbicki, a French native of Morhange in 1953. Their son, Jean-Claude Lavigne, was born in 1954 at RCAF Station Grostenquin near Grostenquin, Lorraine. When Jean-Claude was a child, the family moved to Ontario, and in 1975, he married Judith-Rosanne &quot;Judy&quot; Loshaw.

When Lavigne was 5, the family moved to Napanee (now incorporated as Greater Napanee), a town with a population of approximately 5,000 at the time.

To support her musical interests, her father bought her a microphone, a drum kit, a keyboard, and several guitars, and converted their basement into a studio. Her father often played bass at the church the family attended, the Third Day Worship Centre in Kingston. When Lavigne was 14 years old, her parents took her to karaoke sessions.

Lavigne performed at country fairs, singing songs by Garth Brooks, the Chicks, and Shania Twain, and began writing her own songs. Her first song was called &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Thinking About You&quot;, about a teenage infatuation, which she described as &quot;cheesy cute&quot;.

Lavigne also played hockey during high school and won Most valuable player (MVP) twice as a right winger in a boys league.

==Career==
===1999–2001: Career beginnings===
In 1999, Lavigne won a radio contest to perform with Canadian singer Shania Twain at the Corel Centre in Ottawa, before an audience of 20,000 people. Twain and Lavigne sang Twain&#x27;s song, &quot;What Made You Say That&quot;, and Lavigne told Twain that she aspired to be &quot;a famous singer&quot;. During a performance with the Lennox Community Theatre, Lavigne was spotted by local folksinger Stephen Medd. He invited her to contribute vocals on his song, &quot;Touch the Sky&quot;, for his 1999 album, &quot;Quinte Spirit&quot;. She later sang on &quot;Temple of Life&quot; and &quot;Two Rivers&quot; for his follow-up album, &quot;My Window to You&quot;, in 2000.

In December 1999, Lavigne was discovered by her first professional manager, Cliff Fabri, while singing country covers at a Chapters bookstore in Kingston. Fabri sent out VHS tapes of Lavigne&#x27;s home performances to several industry prospects, and Lavigne was visited by several executives. Mark Jowett, co-founder of a Canadian management firm, Nettwerk, received a copy of Lavigne&#x27;s karaoke performances recorded in her parents&#x27; basement. Jowett arranged for Lavigne to work with producer Peter Zizzo during the summer of 2000 in New York, where she wrote the song &quot;Why&quot;. Lavigne was noticed by Arista Records during a trip to New York.

In November 2000, Ken Krongard, an A&amp;R representative, invited Antonio &quot;L.A.&quot; Reid, then head of Arista Records, to Zizzo&#x27;s Manhattan studio to hear Lavigne sing. Her 15-minute audition &quot;so impressed&quot; Reid that he immediately signed her to Arista with a deal worth $1.25 million for two albums and an extra $900,000 for a publishing advance. By this time, Lavigne had found that she fit in naturally with her hometown high school&#x27;s skater clique, an image that carried through to her first album, but although she enjoyed skateboarding, school left her feeling insecure. Having signed a record deal, and with support from her parents, she left school to focus on her music career. Lavigne&#x27;s band, which were mostly the members of Closet Monster, was chosen by Nettwerk, as they wanted young performers who were up and coming from the Canadian punk rock scene who would fit with Lavigne&#x27;s personality.

===2002–2003: &quot;Let Go&quot;===

Reid gave A&amp;R Joshua Sarubin the responsibility of overseeing Lavigne&#x27;s development and the recording of her debut album. They spent several months in New York working with different co-writers, trying to forge an individual sound for her. Sarubin told HitQuarters that they initially struggled; although early collaborations with songwriter-producers including Sabelle Breer, Curt Frasca and Peter Zizzo resulted in some good songs, they did not match her or her voice. It was only when Lavigne went to Los Angeles in May 2001 and created two songs with the Matrix production team—including &quot;Complicated&quot;, later released as her debut single—that the record company felt she had made a major breakthrough. Lavigne worked further with the Matrix and also with singer-songwriter Clif Magness. Recording of Lavigne&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Let Go&quot;, finished in January 2002.

Lavigne released &quot;Let Go&quot; in June 2002 in the US, where it reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. It peaked at number one in Australia, Canada, and the UK—this made Lavigne, at 17 years old, the youngest female soloist to have a number-one album on the UK Albums Chart at that time. By the end of 2002, the album was certified four-times Platinum by the RIAA, making her the bestselling female artist of 2002 and &quot;Let Go&quot; the top-selling debut of the year. By May 2003, &quot;Let Go&quot; had accumulated over 1 million sales in Canada, receiving a diamond certification from the Canadian Recording Industry Association. By 2009, the album had sold over 16 million units worldwide. By March 2018, the RIAA certified the album seven-times Platinum, denoting shipments of over seven million units in the US.

Lavigne&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Complicated&quot;, peaked at number one in Australia and number two in the US. &quot;Complicated&quot; was one of the bestselling Canadian singles of 2002, and one of the decade&#x27;s biggest hits in the US, where subsequent singles &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; reached the top ten. With these three singles, Lavigne became the second artist in history to have three top-ten songs from a debut album on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Mainstream Top 40 chart. Lavigne was named Best New Artist (for &quot;Complicated&quot;) at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, won four Juno Awards in 2003 out of six nominations, received a World Music Award for &quot;World&#x27;s Bestselling Canadian Singer&quot;, and was nominated for eight Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and Song of the Year for &quot;Complicated&quot;.

In 2002, Lavigne made a cameo appearance in the music video for &quot;Hundred Million&quot; by the pop punk band Treble Charger. In March 2003, Lavigne posed for the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, and in May she performed &quot;Fuel&quot; during MTV&#x27;s Icon tribute to Metallica. During her first headlining tour, the Try to Shut Me Up Tour, Lavigne covered Green Day&#x27;s &quot;Basket Case&quot;.

===2004–2005: &quot;Under My Skin&quot;===

Lavigne&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, was released in May 2004 and debuted at number one in Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK, and the US. The album was certified five-times Platinum in Canada and has sold 10 million copies, including 3.2 million in the US. Lavigne wrote most of the album&#x27;s tracks with Canadian singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk, and Kreviazuk&#x27;s husband, Our Lady Peace front man Raine Maida, co-produced the album with Butch Walker and Don Gilmore. Lavigne said that &quot;Under My Skin&quot; proved her credentials as a songwriter, saying that &quot;each song comes from a personal experience of mine, and there are so much emotions in those songs&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;, the lead single off the album, reached the top five in the UK and Canada and the top ten in Australia. &quot;My Happy Ending&quot;, the album&#x27;s second single, was a top five hit in the UK and Australia. In the US, it was a top ten entry on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and became a number-one pop radio hit. The third single, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Home&quot;, did not manage to make the top 40 in the US and performed moderately elsewhere.

During early 2004 Lavigne went on the &#x27;Live and By Surprise&#x27; acoustic mall tour in the US and Canada to promote &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, accompanied by her guitarist Evan Taubenfeld. In September 2004, Lavigne embarked on her first world tour, the year-long Bonez Tour. Lavigne won two World Music Awards in 2004, for &#x27;World&#x27;s Best Pop/Rock Artist&#x27; and &#x27;World&#x27;s Bestselling Canadian Artist&#x27; and won three Juno Awards from five nominations in 2005, including &#x27;Artist of the Year&#x27;. She also won in the category of &#x27;Favorite Female Singer&#x27; at the eighteenth annual Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards.

Lavigne co-wrote the song &quot;Breakaway&quot;, which was recorded by Kelly Clarkson for the soundtrack to the 2004 film &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot;. &quot;Breakaway&quot; was released as a single in mid 2004 and subsequently included as the title track on Clarkson&#x27;s second album, &quot;Breakaway&quot;. Lavigne performed the Goo Goo Dolls song &quot;Iris&quot; with the band&#x27;s lead singer John Rzeznik at Fashion Rocks in September 2004, and she posed for the cover of &quot;Maxim&quot; in October 2004. She recorded the theme song for &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot; (released in November 2004) with producer Butch Walker.

===2006–2011: &quot;The Best Damn Thing&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Lullaby&quot; ===
In February 2006, Lavigne represented Canada at the closing ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics. Fox Entertainment Group approached Lavigne to write a song for the soundtrack to the 2006 fantasy-adventure film &quot;Eragon&quot;; her contribution, &quot;Keep Holding On&quot;, was released as a single to promote the film and its soundtrack.
Lavigne&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Best Damn Thing&quot;, was released in April 2007 and debuted at number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and subsequently achieved Platinum status in Canada. The album sold more than 2 million copies in the US. Its lead single, &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, became Lavigne&#x27;s first number-one single on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and one of the decade&#x27;s biggest singles. The single also peaked at number one in Australia, Canada, and Japan, and reached number two in the UK and France. As well as English, &quot;Girlfriend&quot; was recorded in Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, German, Japanese, and Mandarin. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ranked &quot;Girlfriend&quot; as the most-downloaded track worldwide in 2007, selling 7.3 million copies, including the versions recorded in eight different languages. &quot;When You&#x27;re Gone&quot;, the album&#x27;s second single, reached the top five in Australia and the United Kingdom, the top ten in Canada, and the top forty in the US. &quot;Hot&quot; was the third single and charted only at number 95 in the US, although it reached the top 10 in Canada and the top 20 in Australia.

Lavigne won two World Music Awards in 2007, for &#x27;World&#x27;s Bestselling Canadian Artist&#x27; and &#x27;World&#x27;s Best Pop/Rock Female Artist&#x27;. She won her first two MTV Europe Music Awards, received a Teen Choice Award for &#x27;Best Summer Single&#x27;, and was nominated for five Juno Awards. In December 2007, Lavigne was ranked number eight in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &#x27;Top 20 Earners Under 25&#x27;, with annual earnings of $12 million. In March 2008, Lavigne undertook a world tour, The Best Damn World Tour, and appeared on the cover of &quot;Maxim&quot; for the second time. In mid-August, Malaysia&#x27;s Islamic opposition party, the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, attempted to ban Lavigne&#x27;s tour show in Kuala Lumpur, judging her stage moves &quot;too sexy&quot;. It was thought that her concert on August 29 would promote wrong values ahead of Malaysia&#x27;s Independence Day on August 31. On August 21, 2008, MTV reported that the concert had been approved by the Malaysian government.

In January 2010, Lavigne worked with Disney to create clothing designs inspired by Tim Burton&#x27;s feature film &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. She recorded a song for its soundtrack, &quot;Alice&quot;, which was played over the end credits and included on the soundtrack album &quot;Almost Alice&quot;. In February, Lavigne performed at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony. Lavigne&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; was sampled by Rihanna on the track &quot;Cheers (Drink to That)&quot;, which is featured on Rihanna&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Loud&quot; (2010). &quot;Cheers (Drink to That)&quot; was released as a single the following year, and Lavigne appeared in its music video. In December 2010, American singer Miranda Cosgrove released &quot;Dancing Crazy&quot;, a song written by Lavigne, Max Martin and Shellback. It was also produced by Martin.

Lavigne began recording for her fourth album, &quot;Goodbye Lullaby&quot;, in her home studio in November 2008. Its opening track, &quot;Black Star&quot;, was written to help promote her first fragrance of the same name. Lavigne described the album as being about her life experiences rather than focusing on relationships, and its style as less pop rock than her previous material, reflecting her age. The release date for &quot;Goodbye Lullaby&quot; was delayed several times, which Lavigne said was because of her label. &quot;Goodbye Lullaby&quot; was released in March 2011, and its lead single, &quot;What the Hell&quot;, premiered in December 2010, ahead of the album&#x27;s release. &quot;Goodbye Lullaby&quot; received Juno Award nominations for Album of the Year and Pop Album of the Year. By March 2018, &quot;Goodbye Lullaby&quot; sold more than 500,000 copies in the US, and it was certified Gold by the RIAA.

===2012–2017: Self-titled album===

Three months after the release of &quot;Goodbye Lullaby&quot;, Lavigne announced that work on her fifth album had already begun, describing it as the musical opposite of &quot;Goodbye Lullaby&quot; and &quot;pop and more fun again&quot;. In late 2011, she confirmed that she had moved to Epic Records, headed by L. A. Reid. Lavigne contributed two cover songs to the 2012 Japanese animated film &quot;One Piece Film: Z&quot;: &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; (originally by Nickelback) and &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; (originally by Joan Jett).

The lead single from Lavigne&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Here&#x27;s to Never Growing Up&quot; (produced by Martin Johnson of the band Boys Like Girls), was released in April 2013 and reached top 20 positions on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, Australia and the UK. The second single, &quot;Rock n Roll&quot;, was released in August 2013 and the third, &quot;Let Me Go&quot; (featuring Lavigne&#x27;s then-husband Chad Kroeger of Nickelback), was released in October 2013. The album, titled &quot;Avril Lavigne&quot;, was released in November 2013; in Canada, it was certified gold and received a Juno Award nomination for Pop Album of the Year. The fourth single from &quot;Avril Lavigne&quot;, &quot;Hello Kitty&quot;, was released in April 2014. The music video sparked controversies over racism claims which Lavigne denied.

During mid-2014, Lavigne opened for boy band the Backstreet Boys&#x27; In a World Like This Tour and played at the Summer Sonic Festival in Tokyo. She released a music video for &quot;Give You What You Like&quot;, the fifth single from her self-titled album on February 10, 2015. The song is featured in Lifetime&#x27;s made-for-TV movie, &quot;Babysitter&#x27;s Black Book&quot;. By March 2018, the album sold more than 500,000 copies in the US, and it was certified Gold by the RIAA.

In an April 2015 interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, Lavigne announced a new single titled &quot;Fly&quot;, which was released on April 26 in association with the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games.

Lavigne was featured in the song &quot;Listen&quot; from Japanese rock band One Ok Rock&#x27;s eighth album, &quot;Ambitions&quot;, released on January 11, 2017. She was also featured in the song &quot;Wings Clipped&quot; by Grey with Anthony Green for the duo&#x27;s debut extended play &quot;Chameleon&quot;, released on September 29, 2017.

===2019–2020: &quot;Head Above Water&quot;===
Lavigne&#x27;s sixth album &quot;Head Above Water&quot; was released on February 15, 2019, through BMG. The album reached the top ten in Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, and peaked at number thirteen on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was preceded by three singles: &quot;Head Above Water&quot;, &quot;Tell Me It&#x27;s Over&quot; and &quot;Dumb Blonde&quot;, with the lead single drawing inspiration from Lavigne&#x27;s battle with Lyme disease. The fourth single, &quot;I Fell in Love with the Devil&quot;, was released on June 28, 2019. In support of the album, Lavigne embarked on the Head Above Water Tour, which started on September 14, 2019. European concerts were postponed to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On April 24, 2020, Lavigne re-recorded the track &quot;Warrior&quot; from her sixth album and released it as a single, titled &quot;We Are Warriors&quot;. The proceeds from the single support Project HOPE&#x27;s relief efforts in the COVID-19 pandemic.

===2021–present: &quot;Love Sux&quot;===
On January 8, 2021, &quot;Flames&quot;, a collaboration between Mod Sun and Lavigne, was released. In the subsequent month, Lavigne confirmed recording for her next album had been completed.

On July 16, 2021, Willow Smith released her fourth album, titled &quot;Lately I Feel Everything&quot;, with one of the tracks, &quot;Grow&quot;, featuring Avril Lavigne and Travis Barker. A music video for the song was released in October of the same year.

After announcing on November 3, 2021, that she had signed with Barker&#x27;s label DTA Records, Lavigne announced her new single titled &quot;Bite Me&quot;, which was released on November 10. On January 13, 2022, Lavigne announced her seventh album &quot;Love Sux&quot;. Much of the album was written and produced by Lavigne&#x27;s then boyfriend, pop punk artist Mod Sun. The second single off the record, &quot;Love It When You Hate Me&quot;, was released on January 14, and featured American singer Blackbear. The album was subsequently released on February 25. &quot;Love Sux&quot; debuted at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Canadian Albums chart.

On June 13, 2022, a new edition of &quot;Let Go&quot; was released for the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary. The record contains six previously unreleased bonus tracks, including Kelly Clarkson&#x27;s &quot;Breakaway&quot;, which was originally written by Lavigne.

On September 13, 2022, Lavigne attended, presented and performed at the 15th Annual Academy of Country Music (ACM) Honors at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee. She performed a cover of Shania Twain&#x27;s &quot;No One Needs to Know&quot; and presented Twain with an ACM Poets Award. The cover received a positive reception.

On October 24, 2022, Lavigne announced the release of a single titled &quot;I&#x27;m a Mess&quot; featuring English singer Yungblud on November 3, 2022, as the lead single of the deluxe edition of &quot;Love Sux&quot;, which was released on November 25. While promoting &quot;I&#x27;m a Mess&quot;, Lavigne confirmed she was working on her eighth album with John Feldmann, Barker, Yungblud and Alex Gaskarth of band All Time Low. &quot;Fake as Hell&quot;, a collaboration between Lavigne and All Time Low, was eventually released as a single on September 15, 2023. On June 9, 2023, Lavigne did a live collaborative performance with country music artist Miranda Lambert during the 2023 CMA Fest at Nissan Stadium in Nashville, Tennessee. They performed a mashup of Lambert&#x27;s &quot;Kerosene&quot; and Lavigne&#x27;s &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;.

On May 10, 2024, Lavigne announced plans to release a greatest hits album on June 21, 2024. On May 16, 2024, Lavigne and country music artist Nate Smith released a collaborative single titled &quot;Bulletproof&quot; that was originally released as a solo single for Smith.

==Artistry and image==
===Musical style and songwriting===
During the 2000s decade, most critics and publications identified Lavigne&#x27;s first three albums as a mix of pop-punk, alternative rock and pop rock influenced by a post-grunge sound. &quot;Let Go&quot; was classified as a pop rock and alternative rock album with a slight grunge influence. Meanwhile, the singer was compared to other female artists with the same sound, mainly Alanis Morissette. The album &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, was noticeably darker musically, with heavier production that showcased ballads and rocker songs which incorporated a more post-grunge sound that verged on nu metal, while keeping pop punk power chord influences. The album was seen as anticipating the &quot;emotional intensity and theatrical aesthetics&quot; of emo-pop music before it came into the mainstream. Critics compared the album with similar works by contemporary acts at the time like Linkin Park and Evanescence, due to its nu metal influence. In contrast, &quot;The Best Damn Thing&quot; abandoned the alternative and post-grunge style in favour of pop punk tunes. The songs were described as sounding like Toni Basil cheerleading for Blink-182, with Lavigne praised for her ability to combine bubblegum pop melodies with punk rock riffs. Teen pop&#x27;s impact on Lavigne&#x27;s music of this decade was noted, since most of her lyrics were from an adolescent perspective. This made some critics describe her music as &quot;alternateen&quot; or &quot;teen punk&quot;.

Later on in the 2010s, her sound went softer and poppier, characterized more by acoustic pop-rock songs and less loud grungy guitar-driven songs that were the signature of her earlier works. With the 2020s pop-punk mainstream resurgence, Lavigne went back to her pop-punk roots, embracing emo-pop angst, and skate punk influences from NOFX, blink-182, Green Day and the Offspring.

Lavigne possesses a soprano vocal range. On a review for Lavigne&#x27;s song &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;, Pat Blashill of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described her voice as &quot;equal parts baby girl and husky siren&quot;. Themes in her music include messages of self-empowerment from a female or an adolescent perspective. Lavigne believes her &quot;songs are about being yourself no matter what and going after your dreams even if your dreams are crazy and even if people tell you they&#x27;re never going to come true.&quot; On her debut album, &quot;Let Go&quot;, Lavigne preferred the less mainstream songs, such as &quot;Losing Grip&quot;, instead of her more radio-friendly singles, such as &quot;Complicated&quot;, saying that &quot;the songs I did with the Matrix ... were good for my first record, but I don&#x27;t want to be that pop anymore.&quot; Lavigne&#x27;s second album, &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, had deeper personal themes underlying each song, with Lavigne remarking that &quot;I&#x27;ve gone through so much, so that&#x27;s what I talk about ... Like boys, like dating or relationships.&quot; In contrast, her third album, &quot;The Best Damn Thing&quot;, was not personal to her. &quot;Some of the songs I wrote didn&#x27;t even mean that much to me. It&#x27;s not like some personal thing I&#x27;m going through.&quot; Her objective in writing the album was simply to &quot;make it fun&quot;. &quot;Goodbye Lullaby&quot;, Lavigne&#x27;s fourth album, was much more personal than her earlier records, with Lavigne describing the album as &quot;more stripped down, deeper. All the songs are very emotional.&quot; Ian McKellen defined her as &quot;a punk chanteuse, a post-grunge valkyrie, with the wounded soul of a poet and the explosive pugnacity of a Canadian&quot; on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; in 2007.

While Lavigne said she was not angry, her interviews were still passionate about the media&#x27;s lack of respect for her songwriting. She said, &quot;I am a writer, and I won&#x27;t accept people trying to take that away from me&quot;, adding that she had been writing &quot;full-structured songs&quot; since she was 14. Despite this, Lavigne&#x27;s songwriting has been questioned throughout her career. The songwriting trio the Matrix, with whom Lavigne wrote songs for her debut album, said that they were the main songwriters of Lavigne&#x27;s singles &quot;Complicated&quot;, &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot;. Lavigne said that she was the primary songwriter for every song on the album, stating that &quot;[N]one of those songs aren&#x27;t from me&quot;.

In 2007, Chantal Kreviazuk, who wrote with Lavigne on her second album, accused Lavigne of plagiarism and criticized her songwriting, saying that &quot;Avril doesn&#x27;t really sit and write songs by herself or anything.&quot; Lavigne also disclaimed this, and considered taking legal action against Kreviazuk for &quot;clear defamation&quot; against her character. Kreviazuk later apologized, saying that &quot;Avril is an accomplished songwriter and it has been my privilege to work with her.&quot; Shortly after that, Tommy Dunbar, founder of the band the Rubinoos, sued Lavigne, her publishing company, and Lukasz &quot;Dr. Luke&quot; Gottwald for allegedly stealing parts of &quot;I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend&quot; for her song &quot;Girlfriend&quot;. Gottwald defended Lavigne, stating, &quot;me and Avril wrote the song together... It has the same chord progressions as ten different Blink-182 songs, the standard changes you&#x27;d find in a Sum 41 song. It&#x27;s the Sex Pistols, not the Rubinoos.&quot; In January 2008, a confidential settlement was reached between the parties.

===Influences===
Lavigne&#x27;s earlier influences came from country music acts such as Garth Brooks, the Chicks, and Shania Twain, and alternative singer-songwriters such as Alanis Morissette, Lisa Loeb, Natalie Imbruglia, and Janis Joplin. By the time she left school to focus on her music career, Lavigne was musically more influenced by skate punk, pop punk, and punk rock acts such as Blink-182, the Offspring, Sum 41, NOFX, Pennywise, Dashboard Confessional, Green Day, the Ramones, the Distillers, and Hole. She also enjoyed metal bands such as Marilyn Manson, System of a Down, Incubus, and the Used, as well as alternative bands such as Nirvana, No Doubt, the Goo Goo Dolls, Radiohead, the Cranberries, Coldplay, Oasis, Third Eye Blind, and Matchbox Twenty.

Because of these influences, musical genres, and Lavigne&#x27;s personal style, the media often defined her as punk, something she said she was not. Lavigne&#x27;s close friend and first guitarist, Evan Taubenfeld, said: &quot;It&#x27;s a very touchy subject to a lot of people, but the point is that Avril isn&#x27;t punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk music and the media ended up doing the rest.&quot; Lavigne commented on the matter: &quot;I have been labelled like I&#x27;m this angry girl, [a] rebel ... punk, and I am &quot;so&quot; not any of them.&quot; However, she has also said that her music has punk influences: &quot;I like to listen a lot to punk rock music, you can notice a certain influence of punk in my music. I like an aggressive music, but pretty enough heavy pop-rock, which is what I really do.&quot;

=== Image ===
When Lavigne first gained publicity, she was known for her tomboyish style, in particular her necktie-and-tank-top combinations. She preferred baggy clothes, skater shoes or Converses, wristbands, and sometimes shoelaces wrapped around her fingers. During photo shoots, instead of wearing &quot;glittery get-ups&quot;, she preferred wearing &quot;old, crumpled T&#x27;s&quot;. In response to her fashion and musical influences, the media called her the &quot;pop punk princess&quot; and the female answer to Blink-182. Press and fans regarded her as the &quot;anti-Britney&quot;, in part because of her less commercial and &quot;real&quot; image, but also because she was noticeably headstrong. &quot;I&#x27;m not made up and I&#x27;m not being told what to say and how to act, so they have to call me the anti-Britney, which I&#x27;m not.&quot; By November 2002, however, Lavigne stopped wearing ties, claiming she felt she was &quot;wearing a costume&quot;. Lavigne made a conscious effort to keep her music, and not her image, at the forefront of her career.

Lavigne eventually took on a more gothic style as she began her second album, &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, trading her skating outfits for black tutus and developing an image marked by angst. During &quot;The Best Damn Thing&quot; years, Lavigne changed directions. She dyed her hair blonde with a pink streak, wore feminine outfits, including &quot;tight jeans and heels&quot;, and modelled for magazines such as &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. Lavigne defended her new style: &quot;I don&#x27;t really regret anything. You know, the ties and the wife-beaters and all ... It had its time and place. And now I&#x27;m all grown up, and I&#x27;ve moved on&quot;.

Lavigne has been the subject of a conspiracy theory that posits that she committed suicide in 2003 and was replaced by a body double who had previously been recruited to distract paparazzi. This originated as a joke on a Brazilian blog, but it has since been embraced by some conspiracy theorists in earnest. In an interview with Australia&#x27;s KIIS 106.5 in November 2018, Lavigne responded to the rumour, stating: &quot;Yeah, some people think that I&#x27;m not the real me, which is so weird! Like, why would they even think that?&quot;

==Legacy==

Lavigne has been called the greatest female representative of pop-punk music and one of the female singers who best represent 2000s rock music. 

She has been compared to alternative female singer-songwriters of the 1990s such as Alanis Morissette, Liz Phair, and Courtney Love, Lavigne also was seen as a fashion icon for her skatepunk and rocker style. In the Mail &amp; Guardian, Kimberley Schoeman called Lavigne a &quot;queer icon&quot; and a &quot;sweet spot for those realising, &quot;I like boys and girls&quot;&quot;. &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;, &quot;He Wasn&#x27;t&quot;, and &quot;Girlfriend&quot; are frequently listed among the best pop-punk songs of all time by critics.

She helped pave the way for female-driven punk-influenced pop artists such as Paramore, Skye Sweetnam, Fefe Dobson, Lillix, Kelly Osbourne, Krystal Meyers, Tonight Alive, Courage My Love, and Hey Monday. She has influenced a wide array of musical artists, including acts such as Tramp Stamps, Bebe Rexha, Billie Eilish, Courage My Love, 5 Seconds of Summer, Yungblud, Maggie Lindemann, Tonight Alive, Willow Smith, Amanda Palmer, Misono, Rina Sawayama, Hey Monday, Grey, Ed Sheeran, Kailee Morgue, Charli XCX, MercyMe, Palberta, Yeule, Olivia Rodrigo, and Kirstin Maldonado. Amy Studt was hailed as &quot;the U.K.&#x27;s answer&quot; to Avril Lavigne. Lavigne influenced indie rock singer-songwriters such as Pale Waves, Graace, Phoebe Bridgers, Soccer Mommy, Ethel Cain, Snail Mail, and Liz Phair.

&quot;Nylon&quot; magazine said she influenced musicians in the mid-to-late 2010s rise of emo hip hop and emo rap, including Lil Uzi Vert, Princess Nokia, Lloyd Banks, Vic Mensa, Nipsey Hussle, Noname, and Rico Nasty. American rapper Fat Tony said she influenced hip hop and rap music because &quot;she delivered a great visual catchy package [punk music, pop music and skater culture] that describes all of them.&quot; Rico Nasty named one of her alter egos, Trap Lavigne, saying &quot;She is a perfect representation of being hard and soft [...] she hated the term punk, but she was so punk rock&quot;.

A persistent internet meme about a Lavigne-written song called &quot;Dolphins&quot; has been showing up on various lyric sites since 2007, but she did not write or record this song. The lyrics appear on dozens of lyric sites and various bands have recorded cover versions of the song that was never recorded by Lavigne.

Lavigne was featured in the 2003 game &quot;The Sims: Superstar&quot; as a non-playable celebrity.

In mid-2007, Lavigne was featured in a two-volume graphic novel, &quot;Avril Lavigne&#x27;s Make 5 Wishes&quot;. She collaborated with artist Camilla d&#x27;Errico and writer Joshua Dysart on the manga, which was about a shy girl named Hana who, upon meeting her hero, Lavigne, learned to overcome her fears. Lavigne said, &quot;I know that many of my fans read manga, and I&#x27;m really excited to be involved in creating stories that I know they will enjoy.&quot; The first volume was released in April 2007, and the second followed in July 2007. The publication &quot;Young Adult Library Services&quot; nominated the series for &quot;Great Graphic Novels for Teens&quot;.

==Accolades==

In 2003, Lavigne won an International Achievement Award for the song &quot;Complicated&quot; at the SOCAN Awards in Toronto. Lavigne received eight Grammy Awards nominations in two years, including Best New Artist. She has also received three American Music Awards nominations, one Brit Award nomination, and one MTV Video Music Award. Lavigne had sold more than 30 million singles and 40 million copies of her albums worldwide, including over 12.4 million album copies in the US according to &quot;Billboard&quot;. In 2009, &quot;Billboard&quot; named Lavigne the number 10 pop artist in the &quot;Best of the 2000s&quot; chart. She was listed as the 28th overall best act of the decade based on album and single chart performance in the US.

Lavigne achieved a Guinness World Record as being the youngest female solo artist to top the UK album chart, on January 11, 2003, at the age of 18 years and 106 days. The album &quot;Let Go&quot; reached number one in its 18th chart week. She held the record until 2004, as the UK charts reported that Joss Stone&#x27;s &quot;Mind Body &amp; Soul&quot; took it the following year. She also was the first to reach 100 million views on a YouTube video, with her 2007 single &quot;Girlfriend&quot;. Lavigne was the first western artist to do a full tour in China, with The Best Damn Tour in 2008, and is considered the biggest western artist in Asia, especially in Japan, where her first three albums have sold more than 1 million copies (being the only female Western Artist since the 2000s to achieve this). Lavigne is the only artist to have performed at three different multi-sport events: two closing ceremonies of the Winter Olympic Games (Torino 2006 and Vancouver 2010) and the opening ceremony of the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games. In June 2024, she was conferred with the Order of Canada.

==Other activities==
===Acting career===
Lavigne became interested in appearing on television and in feature films. The decision, she said, was her own. Although her years of experience in making music videos was to her advantage, Lavigne admitted her experience in singing removed any fear of performing on camera. She specifically mentioned that the video &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Home&quot; involved the most &quot;acting&quot;. Her first television appearance was in a 2002 episode of &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot;, performing &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; with her band in a nightclub. She later made a cameo appearance in the 2004 film &quot;Going the Distance&quot;. The main characters bump into her backstage at the MuchMusic Video Awards after her performance of &quot;Losing Grip&quot;.

She moved into feature film acting cautiously, deliberately choosing small roles to begin with. In November 2005, after going through an audition to land the role, Lavigne travelled to New Mexico to film a single scene in the 2007 film, &quot;The Flock&quot;. She played Beatrice Bell, the girlfriend of a crime suspect, appearing alongside Claire Danes and Richard Gere. Gere gave Lavigne acting tips between takes. On her role in &quot;The Flock&quot;, Lavigne said, &quot;I did that just to see how it was and to not jump into [mainstream acting] too fast.&quot; &quot;The Flock&quot; was not released in American theatres, and because it was not released in foreign markets until late 2007, it is not considered Lavigne&#x27;s debut. The film made $7 million in the foreign box office.
Lavigne&#x27;s feature film debut was voicing an animated character in the 2006 film &quot;Over the Hedge&quot;, based on the comic strip of the same name. She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia opossum. Lavigne found the recording process to be &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;natural&quot;, but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. &quot;I&#x27;d use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so [director] Tim and [screenwriter] Karey had to tell me to hold still... It&#x27;s hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still.&quot; Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. &quot;[The director] thought I&#x27;d give my character... a bit of attitude&quot;. The film opened on May 19, 2006, making $38 million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336 million worldwide.

In December 2005, Lavigne signed to appear in &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot;, based on the book &quot;Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal&quot;. The fictionalized adaptation, directed by Richard Linklater, traces fast-food hamburgers contaminated with cow feces back to the slaughterhouses. Lavigne played Alice, a high school student intent on freeing the cows. The film opened on November 17, 2006, and remained in theatres for 11 weeks, grossing $2 million worldwide.

Both &quot;Over the Hedge&quot; and &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot; opened at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, which Lavigne attended. When asked if she would pursue her film career, she stated that she wanted to take her time and wait for the &quot;right parts and the right movies.&quot; Lavigne was deliberate in the roles she had chosen, saying &quot;I wanted to start off small and to learn. I wouldn&#x27;t just want to throw myself into a big part.&quot; In August 2006, &quot;Canadian Business&quot; magazine ranked her as the seventh top Canadian actor in Hollywood in their second annual Celebrity Power List ranking. The results were determined by comparing salary, Internet hits, TV mentions, and press hits. In September 2011, Lavigne appeared on the Hub Network&#x27;s televised singing competition &quot;Majors &amp; Minors&quot; as a guest mentor alongside other singers, including Adam Lambert and Leona Lewis.

===Products and endorsements===

In July 2008, Lavigne launched the clothing line &quot;Abbey Dawn&quot;, featuring a back-to-school collection. It is produced by Kohl&#x27;s, which is the brand&#x27;s exclusive US retailer. Named after Lavigne&#x27;s childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by Lavigne herself. Kohl&#x27;s describes Abbey Dawn as a &quot;juniors lifestyle brand&quot;, which incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and &quot;hot pinks and blacks&quot;. Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various concerts before its official launch, pointed out that she was not merely licensing her name to the collection. &quot;I actually am the designer. What&#x27;s really important to me is that everything fits well and is well-made, so I try everything on and approve it all.&quot; The designs were also featured on the Internet game &quot;Stardoll&quot;, where figures can be dressed up as Lavigne.

On September 14, 2009, Lavigne took the then latest collection of her clothing line to be a part of New York Fashion Week, returning in 2011. In December 2010, the clothing line was made available to over 50 countries through the line&#x27;s official website.

Lavigne released her first fragrance, Black Star, created by Procter &amp; Gamble Prestige Products. The fragrance was announced on Lavigne&#x27;s official website on March 7, 2009. Black Star, which features notes of pink hibiscus, black plum and dark chocolate, was released in summer 2009 in Europe, and later in the US and Canada. When asked what the name meant, Lavigne replied, &quot;I wanted [the bottle] to be a star, and my colours are pink and black, and Black Star resembles being different, and standing out in the crowd, and reaching for the stars; the whole message is just about following your dreams, and it&#x27;s okay to be unique and be who you are.&quot; Black Star won the 2010 Best &quot;Women&#x27;s Scent Mass&quot; by Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW). Black Star was followed by a second fragrance in July 2010, &quot;Forbidden Rose&quot;, which took two years to develop. It features notes of red apple, winepeach, black pepper, lotusflower, heliotrope, shellflower, praline agreement, sandalwood, and vanilla. Its message is an extension of Black Star&#x27;s &quot;follow your dreams&quot;, though the tagline for the new perfume is &quot;Dare to Discover&quot;. The commercial takes place in a gothic garden setting, where Lavigne, upon entering the garden, finds a single, purple rose. Lavigne launched a third fragrance, Wild Rose, in August 2011 and filmed the commercial for it in late 2010. The tagline for the fragrance is &quot;Dare to discover more&quot;. It features notes of mandarin, pink grapefruit, plum, orange blossom, frangipani, blue orchid, musk, sandalwood and crème brûlée.

In January 2010, Lavigne began working with Disney to incorporate &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;-inspired designs into her Abbey Dawn line of clothing. Her designs were exhibited at the Fashion Institute of Design &amp; Merchandising in California beginning in May through September, alongside Colleen Atwood&#x27;s costumes from the 2010 film.

===Philanthropy===

Lavigne has been involved with many charities, including Make Some Noise, Amnesty International, Erase MS, AmericanCPR.org, Special Olympics, Camp Will-a-Way, Music Clearing Minefields, US Campaign for Burma, Make-A-Wish Foundation and War Child. She has also appeared in ALDO ads with YouthAIDS to raise money to educate people worldwide about HIV/AIDS. Lavigne took part in the Unite Against AIDS concert presented by ALDO in support of UNICEF on November 28, 2007, at the Bell Centre in Montréal, Québec, Canada. In November 2010, Lavigne attended the Clinton Global Initiative.

Lavigne worked with Reverb, a non-profit environmental organization, for her 2005 east coast tour. She covered &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot; for War Child&#x27;s &quot;Peace Songs&quot; compilation, and she recorded a cover of the John Lennon song &quot;Imagine&quot; as her contribution to the compilation album &quot;Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur&quot;. Released on June 12, 2007, the album was produced to benefit Amnesty International&#x27;s campaign to alleviate the crisis in Darfur.

On December 5, 2009, Lavigne returned to the stage in Mexico City during the biggest charity event in Latin America, &quot;Teleton&quot;. She performed acoustic versions of her hits &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;Girlfriend&quot; with Evan Taubenfeld and band member, Jim McGorman. In 2010, Lavigne was one of several artists who contributed their voices to a cover of K&#x27;naan&#x27;s &quot;Wavin&#x27; Flag&quot; as a benefit single to help raise money for several charity organizations related to the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

On September 14, 2010, Lavigne introduced her charity, &quot;The Avril Lavigne Foundation&quot;, which aims to help young people with serious illnesses and disabilities and works with leading charitable organizations. The foundation partners with the Easter Seals, Make-A-Wish foundation and Erase MS. Her work with the Make-A-Wish foundation was the inspiration behind her own charity, with Lavigne stating, &quot;I just really wanted to do more.&quot; Lavigne said on the foundation&#x27;s website, &quot;I have always looked for ways to give back because I think it&#x27;s a responsibility we all share.&quot; Philanthropist Trevor Neilson&#x27;s 12-person firm, Global Philanthropy Group, advises Lavigne with her foundation as well as several other celebrities, including musician John Legend.

In September 2014, she launched a personal fundraising campaign for the Special Olympics as part of her birthday celebration. Proceeds from her &quot;Team Rockstar&quot; event helped sponsor athletes from around the world competing in the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games in Los Angeles. The athletes were the stars of the music video for &quot;Fly&quot;, which was shot in Canada.

In September 2020, Lavigne announced a special livestream concert to raise awareness and funds in the fight against Lyme disease called the #FightLyme concert. The concert took place on October 25, with proceeds from all tickets and merchandise going to the Global Lyme Alliance, a chronic Lyme disease advocacy group, and her charity, the Avril Lavigne Foundation.

===Politics===
After winning her fourth Juno Award in April 2003, in reference to the Iraq War, Lavigne said, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe war is a way to solve problems. I think it&#x27;s wrong ... I don&#x27;t have that much respect for [U.S. President George] Bush.&quot; She also said that she was &quot;really proud&quot; of then Prime Minister of Canada Jean Chrétien for keeping Canada out of the war.

==Personal life==
===Tattoos===

As well as having some unique designs, most of Lavigne&#x27;s tattoos match those of her friends. Lavigne had a star tattooed on the inside of her left wrist that was created at the same time as friend and musical associate Ben Moody&#x27;s identical tattoo. In late 2004, she had a small pink heart around the letter &quot;D&quot; applied to her right wrist, which represented her then-boyfriend, Deryck Whibley. Lavigne and then-husband Whibley got matching tattoos in March 2010, in celebration of his 30th birthday. In April 2010, Lavigne added another tattoo on her wrist, that of a lightning bolt and the number 30.

Her love of tattoos, however, gained media attention in May 2010, after Lavigne and Brody Jenner each got matching tattoos of the word &quot;fuck&quot; on their ribs. Lavigne appeared in the June/July cover story for &quot;Inked&quot; magazine, where she discussed and showed off her tattoos, including an &quot;Abbey Dawn&quot; on her left forearm and an &quot;XXV&quot; and star on her right. Although she confirmed the &quot;fuck&quot; tattoo verbally in the article, she had it applied after the magazine&#x27;s photo shoot. She added that she eventually wanted to get a &quot;big-ass heart with a flag through it with a name ... I&#x27;m going to wait a few years and make sure I still want it then. I have to wait for that special someone to come back into my life.&quot; In July 2010, Lavigne had her then-boyfriend&#x27;s name, &quot;Brody&quot;, tattooed beneath her right breast. In 2018, Lavigne got a traditional heart shaped tattoo with then boyfriend JaKeb Allen Munn.

===French citizenship===
Lavigne&#x27;s father was born in France, and through , she applied for a French passport, which she received in February 2011. In January 2012, Lavigne sold her house in Bel-Air (on the market since May 2011), and moved to Paris to study the French language. She rented an apartment and attended a Berlitz school.

===Relationships===
Lavigne and Sum 41 lead vocalist/rhythm guitarist Deryck Whibley began dating when Lavigne was 19 years old, after being friends since she was 17. In June 2005, Whibley proposed to her. The couple married on July 15, 2006, in Montecito, California. On October 9, 2009, Lavigne filed for divorce, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot; as the reason. Lavigne stated, &quot;I am grateful for our time together, and I am grateful and blessed for our remaining friendship.&quot; The divorce was finalized on November 16, 2010.

Lavigne started dating &quot;The Hills&quot; star Brody Jenner in February 2010. After almost two years of dating, the couple split in January 2012.

Lavigne began dating fellow Canadian musician Chad Kroeger, frontman of the band Nickelback, in July 2012. The relationship blossomed after they began working together in March 2012 to write and record music for Lavigne&#x27;s fifth album. Lavigne and Kroeger became engaged in August 2012, after one month of dating. The couple married at the Château de la Napoule, a reconstructed medieval castle on the Mediterranean in the South of France, on July 1, 2013, after a year of being together. On September 2, 2015, Lavigne announced her separation from Kroeger via her official Instagram account, and they later divorced.

Lavigne began dating billionaire heir Phillip Sarofim in 2018. She broke up with him in 2019. It was reported by &quot;People&quot; magazine that she began dating musician Pete Jonas in 2020. She later began dating Mod Sun around March 2021. In April 2022, Lavigne used her social media accounts to announce their engagement, which ended in February 2023.

===Health===
In April 2015, Lavigne revealed to &quot;People&quot; magazine that she had been diagnosed with Lyme disease after her 30th birthday in 2014. In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot; that same month, Lavigne said that she was in the recovery process and that she wanted to increase awareness of the disease.

Lavigne has been referred to as a vegan or a vegetarian, though she has not discussed her diet publicly.

<text>The Bashkirs ( , ) or Bashkurts (, ; , ) are a Turkic ethnic group indigenous to Russia. They are concentrated in Bashkortostan, a republic of the Russian Federation and in the broader historical region of Badzhgard, which spans both sides of the Ural Mountains, where Eastern Europe meets North Asia. Smaller communities of Bashkirs also live in the Republic of Tatarstan, the krai of Perm, the oblasts of Chelyabinsk, Orenburg, Tyumen, Sverdlovsk and Kurgan and other regions in Russia; sizeable minorities exist in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.

Most Bashkirs speak the Bashkir language, which is similar to Tatar and Kazakh languages. The Bashkir language belongs to the Kipchak branch of Turkic languages; they share historical and cultural affinities with the broader Turkic peoples. Bashkirs are mainly Sunni Muslims of the Hanafi madhhab, or school of jurisprudence, and follow the Jadid doctrine. Previously nomadic and fiercely independent, the Bashkirs gradually came under Russian rule beginning in the 16th century; they have since played a major role through the history of Russia, culminating in their autonomous status within the Russian Empire, Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia.

==Ethnonym==
The etymology and indeed meaning of the endonym &quot;Bashqurt&quot; has been for a long time under discussion.

The name Bashqurt has been known since the 10th century, most researchers etymologize the name as &quot;main/leader/head&quot; (bash) + &quot;wolf&quot; (qurt being an archaic name for the animal), thus &quot;wolf-leader&quot; (from the totemic hero ancestor).

This prevailing folk etymology relates to a legend regarding the migration of the first seven Bashkir tribes from the Syr Darya valley to the Volga-Ural region. The legend relates that the Bashkirs were given a green and fertile land by the fertility goddess of Tengrism Umay (known locally also as &quot;Umay-əsə&quot;), protected by the legendary Ural mountains (in alignment with the famous Bashkir epic poem &quot;Ural-Batyr&quot;). A wolf was sent to guide these tribes to their promised land, hence &quot;bash-qurt, &quot;leading wolf&quot;&quot;. The ethnographers V. N. Tatishchev, P. I. Richkov, and Johann Gottlieb Georgi provided similar etymologies in the 18th century.

Although this is the prevailing theory for an etymology of the term &quot;bashqurt&quot;, other theories have been formulated:
* In 1847, the historian V. S. Yumatov speculated the original meaning to have been &quot;beekeeper or beemaster&quot;.
* Douglas Morton Dunlop proposed &quot;bashqurt&quot; being derived from the forms &quot;beshgur&quot;, &quot;bashgur&quot;, which means &quot;five oghurs&quot;. Since modern &quot;sh&quot; corresponds to &quot;l&quot; in Bulgar language. Therefore, Dunlop proposes the ethnonyms Bashqurt and Bulgar are equivalent. Zeki Velidi Togan also suggested this.
* Historian and ethnologist A. E. Alektorov has suggested that &quot;Bashqurt&quot; meant &quot;distinct nation&quot;.
* Anthropologist R. M. Yusupov considered &quot;Bashqurt&quot; may originally have been an Iranian compound word meaning &quot;wolf-children&quot; or &quot;s of heroes&quot;, on the basis of the words &quot;bacha&quot; &quot;descendant, child&quot; and &quot;gurd&quot; &quot;hero&quot; or &quot;gurg&quot; &quot;wolf&quot;.
* Historian and archaeologist Mikhail Artamonov suggested that the word is a corruption of the name of the Bušxk (or &quot;Bwsxk&quot;), a tribe of Scythia that lived in the area now known as Bashkortostan.
* Ethnologist N. V. Bikbulatov suggested that the term originated from the name of a legendary Khazar warlord named Bashgird, who ruled an area along the Yayıq river.
* Ethnologist R. G. Kuzeev derived the ethnonym from the morphemes &quot;bash&quot; &quot;leader, head&quot; and &quot;qurt&quot; &quot;tribe&quot;.
* Historian and linguist András Róna-Tas argued the ethnonym &quot;Bashkir&quot; to be a Bulgar Turkic reflex of the Hungarian endonym &quot;Magyar&quot; (or the Old Hungarian &quot;Majer&quot;).

==History==
===Origins===
The Bashkir group was formed by Turkic tribes of South Siberian and Central Asian origin, who, before migrating to the Southern Urals, wandered for a considerable time in the Aral-Syr Darya steppes (modern day central-southern Kazakhstan), coming into contact with the Pecheneg-Oghuz and Kimak-Kipchak tribes. Therefore, it is possible to note that the Bashkir people originates from the same tribes which compose the modern Kazakhs, Kyrgyzes and Nogais, but there has been a considerable cultural and a small ethnic exchange with Oghuz tribes.

The migration to the valley of the Southern Urals took place between the end of the 9th century and the beginning of the 10th century, in parallel to the Kipchak migration to the north.

===Middle Ages===

The first report about Bashkirs may have been in the Chinese chronicle Book of Sui (636 AD). Around 40 Turkic Tiele tribes were named in the section &quot;A Narration about the Tiele people&quot;; Bashkirs might have been included within that narration, if the tribal name 比干 (Mandarin &quot;Bǐgān&quot; ← Middle Chinese ZS: *&quot;piɪX-kɑn&quot;) (in &quot;Book of Wei&quot;) were a scribal error for 比千 (&quot;Bĭqiān&quot; ← *&quot;piɪXt͡sʰen&quot;) (in &quot;History of the Northern Dynasties&quot;), the latter reading being favored by Chinese scholar Rui Chuanming.

In the 7th century, Bashkirs were also mentioned in the Armenian Ashkharatsuyts.

However, these mentions may refer to the precursors of the Kipchak Bashkir tribes who travelled in the Aral-Syr Darya region before the migration. The Book of Sui may have mentioned &quot;Bashkirs&quot; when the Turkic peoples were still travelling through southern Siberia.

In the 9th century, during the migration of the Bashkirs to the Volga-Ural region, the first Arabic and Persian-written reports about Bashkirs are attested. These include reports by Sallam al-Tardjuman who around 850 travelled to the Bashkir territories and outlined their borders.

In the 10th century, the Persian historian and polymath Abu Zayd al-Balkhi described Bashkirs as a people divided into two groups: one inhabiting the Southern Urals, the other living on the Wallachian Plain–Danubian Plain near the boundaries of Byzantium. Ibn Rustah, a contemporary of Abu Zayd al-Balkhi, observed that Bashkirs were an independent people occupying territories on both sides of the Ural Mountains ridge between Volga, Kama, and Tobol Rivers and upstream of the Yaik river.

Ahmad ibn Fadlan, ambassador of the Baghdad Caliph Al-Muqtadir to the governor of Volga Bulgaria, wrote the first ethnographic description of the Bashkir in 922. The Bashkirs, according to Ibn Fadlan, were a warlike and powerful people, which he and his companions (a total of five thousand people, including military protection) &quot;bewared... with the greatest threat&quot;. They were described as engaged in cattle breeding. According to ibn Fadlan, the Bashkirs worshipped twelve gods: winter, summer, rain, wind, trees, people, horses, water, night, day, death, heaven and earth, and the most prominent, the sky god. Apparently, Islam had already begun to spread among the Bashkirs, as one of the ambassadors was a Muslim Bashkir. According to the testimony of Ibn Fadlan, the Bashkirs were Turks, living on the southern slopes of the Urals, and occupying a vast territory up to the river Volga. They were bordered by Oghuz Turks on the south, Pechenegs to the south-east and Bulgars on the west.

The earliest source to give a geographical description of Bashkir territory, Mahmud al-Kashgari&#x27;s &quot;Divanu Lugat&#x27;it Turk&quot; (1072–1074), includes a map with a charted region called &quot;Fiyafi Bashqyrt&quot; (the Bashkir steppes). Despite a lack of much geographic detail, the sketch map does indicate that the Bashkirs inhabited a territory bordering on the Caspian Sea and the Volga valley in the west, the Ural Mountains in the north-west, and the Irtysh valley in the east, thus giving a rough outline of the area.

Said Al-Andalusi and Muhammad al-Idrisi mention the Bashkir in the 12th century. The 13th-century authors Ibn Sa&#x27;id al-Maghribi, Yaqut al-Hamawi and Qazvini and the 14th-century authors Al-Dimashqi and Abu&#x27;l-Fida also wrote about Bashkirs.

The first European sources to mention the Bashkirs were the works of Joannes de Plano Carpini and William of Rubruquis of the 13th century.

By 1226, Genghis Khan had incorporated the lands of Bashkortostan into his empire. During the 13th and 14th centuries, all of Bashkortostan was a component of the Golden Horde. The brother of Batu-Khan, Sheibani, received the Bashkir lands east of the Ural Mountains.

After the disintegration of the Mongol Empire, the Bashkirs were divided among the Nogai Horde, the Khanate of Kazan and the Khanate of Sibir, founded in the 15th century.

===Early modern period===

In the middle of the 16th century, Bashkirs were gradually conquered by the Tsardom of Russia. Primary documents pertaining to the Bashkirs during this period have been lost, although some are mentioned in the &quot;shezhere&quot; (family trees) of the Bashkir.

During the Russian Imperial period, Russians and Tatars began to migrate to Bashkortostan which led to eventual demographic changes in the region. The recruitment of Bashkirs into the Russian army and having to pay steep taxes pressured many Bashkirs to adopt a more settled lifestyle and to slowly abandon their ancient nomadic pastoralist past.

In the late 16th and early 19th centuries, Bashkirs occupied the territory from the river Sylva in the north, to the river heads of Tobol in the east, the mid-stream of the river Yaik (Ural) in the south; in the Middle and Southern Urals, the Cis-Urals including Volga territory and Trans-Uralsto, and the eastern bank of the river Volga on the south-west.

===Bashkir rebellions of the 17th–18th centuries===
The Bashkirs participated in the 1662–64, 1681–84 and 1704–11 Rebellions. In 1676, the Bashkirs rebelled under a leader named Seyid Sadir or &#x27;Seit Sadurov&#x27;, and the Russian army had great difficulties in ending the rebellion. The Bashkirs rose again in 1707, under Aldar and Kûsyom, due to perceived ill-treatment by Imperial Russian officials.

At the founding of Orenburg in 1735, the fourth insurrection occurred in 1735 and lasted six years. Ivan Kirillov formed a plan to build the fort to be called Orenburg at Orsk at the confluence of the Or River and the Ural River, south-east of the Urals where the Bashkir, Kalmyk and Kazakh lands met. Work on Fort Orenburg commenced at Orsk in 1735. However, by 1743 the site of Orenburg was moved a further 250 km west to its current location. The next planned construction was to be a fort on the Aral Sea. The consequence of the Aral Sea fort would involve crossing Bashkir and the Kazakh Lesser Horde lands, some of whom had recently offered a nominal submission to the Russian Crown.

The southern side of Bashkiria was partitioned by the Orenburg Line of forts. The forts ran from Samara on the Volga east as far as the Samara River headwaters. It then crossed to the middle of the Ural River and following the river course east and then north on the eastern side of the Urals. It then went east along the Uy River to Ust-Uisk on the Tobol River where it connected to the ill-defined &#x27;Siberian Line&#x27; along the forest-steppe boundary.

In 1774, the Bashkirs, under the leadership of Salavat Yulayev, supported Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion. In 1786, the Bashkirs achieved tax-free status; and in 1798 Russia formed an irregular Bashkir army from among them.

===Napoleonic Wars===
During the Napoleonic Wars, many Bashkirs served as mercenaries in the Russian army to defend from the French invaders during Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia. Subsequently, the Bashkir battalions were the most notable fighters during the Napoleonic wars on the north German and Dutch plateau. The Dutch and the Germans called the Bashkirs &quot;Northern Amurs&quot;, probably because the population was not aware of who the Bashkirs actually were or where they came from, therefore the usage of &quot;Amurs&quot; in the name may be an approximation; these battalions were considered as the liberators from the French, however modern Russian military sources do not credit the Bashkirs with these accomplishments. These regiments also served in Battle of Paris and the subsequent occupation of France by the coalition forces.

===Establishment of First Republic of Bashkortostan===
After the Russian Revolution, the All-Bashkir Qoroltays (convention) concluded that it was necessary to form an independent Bashkir republic within Russia. As a result, on 15 November 1917, the Bashkir Regional (central) Shuro (Council), ruled by Äxmätzäki Wälidi Tıwğan proclaimed the establishment of the first independent Bashkir Republic in areas of predominantly Bashkir population: Orenburg, Perm, Samara, Ufa provinces and the autonomous entity Bashkurdistan on November 15, 1917. This effectively made Bashkortostan the first ever democratic Turkic republic in history.

===Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic===
In March 1919, the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was formed based on agreements of the Russian Government.

===World War II===


During World War II, Bashkir soldiers served in the Red Army to defend the Soviet Union and fought against the Germans during the German invasion of the Soviet Union.

===Second declaration of independence===
On October 11, 1990, Declaration of State Sovereignty by the Supreme Council of the Republic was proclaimed. On March 31, 1992 Bashkortostan signed a federal agreement on the delimitation of powers and areas of jurisdiction and the nature of contractual relations between the authorities of the Russian Federation and the authorities of the sovereign republics in its composition including the Republic of Bashkortostan.

==Genetics==

===Haplogroups===

====Maternal haplogroups====
====Paternal haplogroups====
Genetic studies on Y-DNA haplogroups have revealed that the three dominant paternal haplogroups for Bashkir males are the haplogroup R1b, haplogroup R1a, and the haplogroup N1c. Haplogroups C-M217, O, and D1, were found at lower frequencies among Bashkir males, and together make up roughly 11,5%. Near Eastern-associated haplogroups J2 and G2 make up roughly 8,5%.

In some specific regions and clans of ethnic Bashkir, the North Asian and Eastern Siberian haplogroup (N3) range from moderate to high frequencies (29 to 90%).

Archaeogenetic analyses show a similarity between historical Hungarians, whose homeland is around the Ural Mountains, and Bashkirs; analysis of haplogroup N3a4-Z1936 which is still found in very rare frequencies in modern Hungarians, and showed that Hungarian &quot;sub-clade [N-B539/Y13850] splits from its sister-branch N3a4-B535, frequent today among Northeast European Uralic speakers, 4000–5000 ya, which is in the time-frame of the proposed divergence of Ugric languages&quot;, while on N-B539/Y13850+ sub-clade level confirmed shared paternal lineages with modern Ugric (Mansis and Khantys via N-B540/L1034) and Turkic speakers (Bashkirs and Volga Tatars via N-B540/L1034 and N-B545/Y24365); these suggest that the Bashkirs are mixture of Turkic, Ugric and Indo-European contributions.

A genetic study published in &quot;Scientific Reports&quot; in November 2019 examined the remains of 29 Hungarian conquerors of the Carpathian Basin. The majority of them (60%) carried Y-DNA of West Eurasian origin, but at least 40% of East Eurasian (N1a-M2004, N1a-Z1936, Q1a and R1a-Z2124). They carried a higher amount of West Eurasian paternal ancestry than West Eurasian maternal ancestry. Among modern populations, their paternal ancestry was the most similar to modern Bashkirs. Haplogroup I2a1a2b was observed among several conquerors of particularly high rank. This haplogroup is of European origin and is today particularly common among South Slavs. A wide variety of phenotypes were observed, with several individuals having blond hair and blue eyes, but also East Asian traits. The study also analyzed three Hunnic samples from the Carpathian Basin in the 5th century, and these displayed genetic similarities to the conquerors. The Hungarian conquerors appeared to be a recently assembled heterogenous group incorporating both European, Asian and Eurasian elements. A group of Bashkirs from the Burzyansky and Abzelilovsky districts of the Republic of Bashkortostan in the Volga-Ural region who belong to the R1a subclade R1a-SUR51 are the closest kin to the Hungarian Árpád dynasty, from which they got separated 2000 years ago.

===Autosomal DNA===
According to Suslova, et al. (2012) the Bashkir population shared immune genes with both West and Eastern Eurasian populations.

A genetic study by Yunusbayev et al. 2015 found that the Bashkirs display a significant amount of East Asian-derived ancestry (c. 40%), of which roughly the half can be associated with Siberian ancestry maximized in modern-day Nganasans, and the other half with Ancient Northeast Asians. The remainder of the Bashkirs ancestry was linked to West Eurasian, primarily European sources. The results point to admixture between local Indo-European-speakers, Uralic-speakers and Turkic-speakers. The admixture event dates to the 13th century, according to an analysis of the identical-by-descent segments. According to the authors, the admixture thus occurred after the presumed migrations of the ancestral Kipchaks from the Irtysh and Ob regions in the 11th century.

A full genome study by Triska et al. 2017 found that the Bashkir genepool is best described as a multi-layered amalgamation of Turkic, Uralic, and Indo-European contributions. They further argue that &quot;this disparity between cultural and genetic affinities of Tatar and Bashkir can be attributed to a phenomenon of cultural dominance: the population ancestral to Bashkir adopted the Turkic language during Turkic expansion from the east (language replacement event)&quot;.

A genetic analysis on genetic data of Hun, Avar and Magyar conqueror samples by Maroti et al. 2022, revealed high genetic affinity between Magyar conquerors and modern day Bashkirs. They can be modeled as ~50% Mansi-like, ~35% Sarmatian-like, and ~15% Hun/Xiongnu-like. The admixture event is suggested to have taken place in the Southern Ural region at 643–431 BC.

==Language==
Bashkir language is a Turkic language of the Kipchak group. It has three main dialects: Southern, Eastern and North-Western located in the territory of historical Bashkortostan.

The Russian census of 2010 recorded 1,152,404 Bashkir speakers in the Russian Federation. The Bashkir language is native to 1,133,339 Bashkirs (71.7% of the total number of Bashkirs, reporting mother tongue). The Tatar language was reported as the native tongue of 230,846 Bashkirs (14.6%), and Russian as the native tongue of 216,066 Bashkirs (13.7%). Most Bashkirs are bilingual in Bashkir and Russian.

The first appearance of a &quot;Bashkir&quot; language is dated back to the 9th century AD, in the form of stone inscription using a Runic alphabet, most likely, this alphabet derives from the Yenisei variant of the old Turkic runic script. This archaic version of a Bashkir language would be more or less a dialect of the proto-Kipchak language, however, since then, the Bashkir language has been through a series of vowel and consonant shifts, which are a result of a common literary history shared with the Idel Tatar language since the formation of the Cuman-Kipchak confederation, when the Oghuric Volga Bulgars started to receive Kipchak Turkic influence and became the Idel Tatars, most likely between the 10th and 11th centuries.

The Nogai and Karachay-Balkar languages are most likely the closest-sounding extant languages to the extinct Proto-Kipchak Bashkir language.

From an arc of time of roughly 900 years, the Bashkir language and Idel Tatar language, previously being completely different languages, &quot;melded&quot; into a series of dialects of a common &quot;Volga Kipchak&quot; or &quot;Volga Turki&quot; language. The Idel Tatars and Bashkirs are and always were two peoples of completely different origins, cultures and identities, but because of a shared common literary history in an arc of 900 years, the two languages ended up in a common language, spoken in different dialects with features depending on the people which spoke them.

For example, the dialects spoken by Bashkirs, tend to have an accent which mostly resembles other Kipchak languages, like Kyrgyz, Kazakh, Nogai, Karakalpak, and many other languages of the Kipchak sub-group, while the dialects spoken by Idel Tatars, have accents more resembling the original Oghuric Volga-Bulgar language spoken before the Cuman invasion.

At the start of the 20th century, particularly during the Russian Revolution, Bashkortostan and Tatarstan emerged as separate republics, leading to the recognition of Bashkir and Tatar as distinct literary languages. Each was based on the most prominent dialects of the Volga Kipchak language spoken by the Bashkir and Kazan Tatar peoples.

The Cyrillic alphabet is the official script used to write Bashkir.

==Demographics==
The ethnic Bashkir population is estimated at 2 million people (2009 SIL Ethnologue). The 2021 Russian census recorded 1,571,879 ethnic Bashkirs in Russia, of which 1,268,806 live in Bashkortostan (31.5% of the total population of the republic).

==Culture==


The Bashkirs traditionally practiced agriculture, cattle-rearing and bee-keeping. The half-nomadic Bashkirs travelled through either the mountains or the steppes, herding cattle. Wild-hive beekeeping is another attested tradition, which is practiced in the same Burzyansky District near the Kapova Cave.

Traditional Bashkir dish bishbarmaq is prepared from boiled meat and halma (a type of noodle), sprinkled with herbs and flavored with onions and some  (young dry cheese). Dairy is another notable feature of the Bashkir cuisine: dishes are often served with dairy products, and few celebrations occur without the serving of or  (sour cream).

===Epic poems and mythology===
The Bashkirs have a rich folklore referencing the genesis and early history of the people. Through the works of their oral folk art, the views of ancient Bashkirs on nature, their wisdom, psychology, and moral ideals are preserved. The genre composition of the Bashkir oral tradition is diverse: epic and fairy tales, legends and traditions, riddles, songs (ritual, epic or lyrical), etc.

The Bashkir poems, like the epic creations of other peoples, find origin in the ancient Turkic mythology, in fact the Bashkir epic tale culture can be considered a more developed and expanded version of old Turkic epic culture. Majority of the poems of Bashkir mythology have been written down and published as books at the beginning of the 20th century, these poems compose a great part of the literature of the Bashkir people and are important examples of further-developed Turkic culture.

Some of these poems became important on a continental level, for example the epic poem the &quot;Ural Batyr&quot;, which tells the tale of the legendary hero Ural, is the origin of the name of the Ural mountains. Other poems constitute a great part of the Bashkir national identity, other tales apart from the Ural Batyr include &quot;Aqbuzat&quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, and &quot;.

===The Ural-Batyr and its impact===
The poem &quot;Ural Batyr&quot; is an epic which includes deities of the Tengrist pantheon. It takes basis on the pre-Islamic Bashkir conception of the world. In the &quot;Ural Batyr&quot; the world is three-tiered. It includes a heavenly, earthly and underworld (underwater) trinity: in the sky, the heavenly king Samrau resides, his wives are the Sun and the Moon, he has two daughters, Umay and Aikhylu, who are incarnated either in the form of birds or beautiful girls. In the &quot;Ural Batyr&quot;, Umay is incarnated into a swan and later assumes the aspect of a beautiful girl as the story proceeds.

People live on the earth, the best of whom pledge honor and respect to the existence of nature. The third world is the underground world, where the &quot;Devas&quot; (also singular &quot;Deva&quot; or &quot;Div&quot;) live, incarnated as a snake, the incarnation of the dark forces, who live underground. Through the actions and divisions of the world related in the Ural Batyr, the Bashkirs express a manichaean view of good and evil. The legendary hero Ural, possessing titanic power, overcoming incredible difficulties, destroys the &quot;deva&quot;, and obtains &quot;living water&quot; (the idea of water in nature, in the pre-Islamic Bashkir pantheon of the Turkic mythology, is considered a spirit of life).

Ural thus obtains the &quot;living water&quot; in order to defeat death in the name of the eternal existence of man and nature. Ural does not drink the &quot;living water&quot; to live eternally. Instead, he decides to sparkle it around himself, to die and donate eternity to the world, the withered earth turning green. Ural dies and from his body emerge the Ural Mountains; the name of the Ural mountain range comes from this poem.

===Music===
The Bashkirs have a style of overtone singing called &#x27; (sometimes spelled &#x27;; Bashkort ), which has nearly died out. In addition, Bashkorts also sing &quot;&quot; while playing the kurai, a national instrument. This technique of vocalizing into a flute can also be found in folk music as far west as the Balkans and Hungary.

===Mentality===
The Bashkirs give rise to the following essential characteristics of the Bashkir mentality: philosophical, poetic thinking, hospitality and courage, serenity, simplicity, modesty, tolerance, pride, a keen sense of justice and competitiveness. The fundamental value of the Bashkir mentality is humanism, it is this idea that runs through the entire axis of the culture of the people.

==Religion==

In the pre-Islamic period the Bashkirs practised animism and shamanism, and incorporated the cosmogony of Tengrism.

Bashkirs began converting to Islam in the 10th century. Arab traveler Ibn Fadlan in 921 met some of the Bashkirs, who were already Muslims. The final assertion of Islam among the Bashkirs occurred in the 1320s and 1330s during the Golden Horde period. The Mausoleum of Hussein-Bek, burial place of the first Imam of historical Bashkortostan, is preserved in contemporary Bashkortostan. The mausoleum is a 14th-century building. Catherine the Great established the Orenburg Mohammedan Spiritual Assembly in 1788 in Ufa, which was the first Muslim administrative center in Russia.

Religious revival among the Bashkirs began in the early 1990s. According to Talgat Tadzhuddin there were more than 1,000 mosques in Bashkortostan in 2010.

The Bashkirs are predominantly Sunni Muslims of the Hanafi madhhab.

<text>In Islam, the ulama (; ; singular ; feminine singular alimah; plural aalimath), also spelled ulema, are scholars of Islamic doctrine and law. They are considered the guardians, transmitters, and interpreters of religious knowledge in Islam.

&quot;Ulama&quot; may refer broadly to the educated class of such religious scholars, including theologians, canon lawyers (muftis), judges (qadis), professors, and high state religious officials. Alternatively, &quot;ulama&quot; may refer specifically to those holding governmental positions in an Islamic state.

By longstanding tradition, ulama are educated in religious institutions (&quot;madrasas&quot;). The Quran and sunnah (authentic hadith) are the scriptural sources of traditional Islamic law.

==Traditional way of education==
Students of Islamic doctrine do not seek out a specific educational institution, but rather seek to join renowned teachers. By tradition, a scholar who has completed their studies is approved by their teacher. At the teacher&#x27;s individual discretion, the student is given the permission for teaching and for the issuing of legal opinions &quot;(fatwa)&quot;. The official approval is known as the &quot;ijazat at-tadris wa &#x27;l-ifta&quot; (). Through time, this practice has established a chain of teachers and pupils who have become teachers in their own time.

==Places of learning==
The traditional place of higher education is the madrasa. The institution likely originated in Khurasan during the 10th century AD, and spread to other parts of the Islamic world from the late 11th century onwards. The most famous early madrasas are the Sunni Niẓāmiyya, founded by the Seljuk vizir Nizam al-Mulk (1018–1092) in Iran and Iraq in the 11th century. The Mustansiriya, established by the Abbasid caliph Al-Mustansir in Baghdad in 1234 AD, was the first to be founded by a caliph, and also the first known to host teachers of all four major madhhab known at that time. From the time of the Persian Ilkhanate (1260–1335 AD) and the Timurid dynasty (1370–1507 AD) onwards, madrasas have often become part of an architectural complex which also includes a mosque, a Sufi ṭarīqa, and other buildings of socio-cultural function, like baths or a hospital.

Madrasas are considered sacred places of learning. They may provide boarding and salaries to a limited number of teachers, and boarding for a number of students out of the revenue from religious endowments &quot;(waqf)&quot;, allocated to a specific institution by the donor. In later times, the deeds of endowment were issued in elaborate Islamic calligraphy, as is the case for Ottoman endowment books &quot;(vakıf-name)&quot;. The donor could also specify the subjects to be taught, the qualification of the teachers, or which madhhab the teaching should follow. Moreover, the donor is free to specify in detail the curriculum, as was shown by Ahmed and Filipovic (2004) for the Ottoman imperial madrasas founded by Suleiman the Magnificent.

As Berkey (1992) has described in detail for the education in medieval Cairo, unlike medieval Western universities, in general madrasas have no distinct curriculum, and do not issue diplomas. The educational activities of the madrasas focuses on the law, but also includes what Zaman (2010) called &quot;Sharia sciences&quot; &quot;(al-ʿulūm al-naqliyya)&quot; as well as the rational sciences like philosophy, astronomy, mathematics or medicine. The inclusion of these sciences sometimes reflects the personal interests of their donors, but also indicates that scholars often study various different sciences.

==Branches of learning==
===Sufism===

Early on in Islamic history, a line of thought developed around the idea of mysticism, striving for the perfection &quot;(Ihsan)&quot; of worship. During the first Islamic century, Hasan al-Basri (642–728 AD) was one of the first Muslim scholars to describe, according to Albert Hourani (1991) &quot;the sense of the distance and nearness of God ... in the language of love&quot;. During the 7th century, the ritual of Dhikr evolved as a &quot;way of freeing the soul from the distractions of the world&quot;. Important early scholars who further elaborated on mysticism were Harith al-Muhasibi (781–857 AD) and Junayd al-Baghdadi (835–910 AD).

===Philosophy and ethics===

The early Muslim conquests brought about Arab Muslim rule over large parts of the Hellenistic world. During the time of the Umayyad Caliphate, at latest, the scholars of the emerging Islamic society had become familiar with the classical philosophical and scientific traditions of the world they had conquered. The collection of classical works and their translation into the Arabian language initiated a period which is known today as the Islamic Golden Age. According to Hourani (1991), the works of the classical scholars of antiquity were met with considerable intellectual curiosity by Islamic scholars. Hourani quotes al-Kindi (c. 801–873 AD), &quot;the father of Islamic philosophy&quot;, as follows:
We should not be ashamed to acknowledge truth from whatever source it comes to us, even if it is brought to us by former generations and foreign peoples. For him who seeks the truth there is nothing of higher value than truth itself.
The works of Aristotle, in particular his &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, had a profound influence on the Islamic scholars of the Golden Age like Al-Farabi (870–950 AD), Abu al-Hassan al-Amiri (d. 992 AD) and Ibn Sina (ca. 980–1037 AD). In general, the Islamic philosophers saw no contradiction between philosophy and the religion of Islam. However, according to Hourani, al-Farabi also wrote that philosophy in its pure form was reserved for an intellectual elite, and that ordinary people should rely for guidance on the &quot;sharia&quot;. The distinction between a scholarly elite and the less educated masses &quot;was to become a commonplace of Islamic thought&quot;. As exemplified by the works of al-Razi ( 865–925 AD), during later times, philosophy &quot;was carried on as a private activity, largely by medical men, pursued with discretion, and often met with suspicion&quot;.

The founder of Islamic philosophical ethics is Ibn Miskawayh (932–1030 AD) He combined Aristotelian and Islamic ethics, explicitly mentioning the Nicomachean Ethics and its interpretation by Porphyry of Gaza as the foundation of his philosophical thoughts.

In the 12th century, the early Islamic Neoplatonism which had developed out of Hellenistic philosophy was effectively criticised by al-Ghazali, one of the most influential scholars of Islam. In his works &quot;Tahāfut al-Falāsifa&quot; (The Incoherence of the Philosophers), &quot;Mizan al-&#x27;amal&quot; (Criterion of Action) and &quot;Kimiya-yi sa&#x27;ādat&quot; (The Alchemy of Happiness), he refuted the Philosophy of Ibn Sīnā, and demonstrated that the Aristotelian ethics is incompatible with Islamic ethics: The latter is based on the belief in God and in life after death, which together provide the foundation of action in the pursuit of &quot;sa&#x27;āda&quot; (Happiness).

===Law===

According to Shia Islam, the authority to interpret the messages of the Quran and the Hadith lies with the Imamah, a line of infallible interpreters of the truth. The Sunni majority, however, reject this concept and maintain that God&#x27;s will has been completely revealed in the Quran and &quot;sunnah&quot; of the Prophet. The capacity of its interpretation lies with the ulama.

By the eleventh century, the major schools of Sunni and Shia law &quot;(madhhab)&quot; had emerged. Whilst, historically, the schools were at times engaged in mutual conflicts, the differences became less controversial over time, and merely represent regional predominances today. The four most important Sunni schools are:
* Shafi&#x27;i (Egypt, Mashriq, Hijaz, Yemen)
* Maliki (Maghreb and West Africa)
* Hanafi (Central and South Asia, the Balkans, Turkey)
* Hanbali (most common in the Gulf counties)

Shia madhhab include the Ja&#x27;fari and Zaidi schools. Minor madhhab also mentioned in the Amman message are the Ibadi and the Zahiri schools.

All Sunni &quot;madhhabs&quot; recognize four sources of &quot;sharia&quot; (divine law): the Quran, &quot;sunnah&quot; (authentic hadith), &quot;qiyas&quot; (analogical reasoning), and &quot;ijma&quot; (juridical consensus). However, the &quot;madhhabs&quot; differ from each other in their conception of the Principles of Islamic jurisprudence, or &quot;uṣūl al-fiqh&quot;, as briefly summarised by Hourani (1991). The Hanbalis accepted only the consensus of the Companions of the Prophet &quot;(aṣ-ṣaḥābah)&quot;, which gave more leeway to independent reasoning &quot;(ijtihad)&quot; within the boundaries of the rules of &quot;qiyās&quot;. The Hanafis hold that strict analogy may at times be supported by a limited use of juristic preference &quot;(istihsan)&quot;, whereas the Maliki school also allows pragmatic considerations in the interest of public welfare &quot;(istislah)&quot; are also acceptable. Instead of the Sunni concept of analogy &quot;(qiyās)&quot;, Shia ulama prefer &quot;dialectical reasoning&quot; &quot;(&#x27;Aql)&quot; to deduce law.

The body of substantive jurisprudence &quot;(fiqh&quot;) defines the proper way of life through interpretation of &quot;sharia&quot;, which Muslims should follow if they want to live according to God&#x27;s will. Over time, the &quot;madhhabs&quot; established &quot;codes of conduct&quot;, examining human actions in the light of the Quran and Hadith. Supplementing the sharia were customs &quot;(ʿurf)&quot; within a given society. Islamic law and regional customs were not opposed to each other: In 15th century Morocco, qadis were allowed to use a process called &quot;ʻamal&quot; in order to choose from different juridical opinions one which applied best to the local customs, even if they were not supported by the consensus of the majority. More often, the use of sharia led to changes in local customs.

=== Theology ===
ʿIlm al-Kalām, the &quot;science of discourse&quot;, also termed &quot;Islamic theology&quot;, serves to explain and defend the doctrine of the Quran and Hadith. The concept of &quot;kalām&quot; was introduced during the first Islamic centuries by the Muʿtazila school. One of the most prominent scholars of the Muʿtazila was Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad (935–1025 AD). From the 11th century on, the Muʿtazila was suppressed by the Sunni Abbasid Caliphate and the Seljuk Empire, but it continued playing an important role in the formation of Shia theology. The Ash&#x27;ari school encouraged the use of Kalām as the basis of fiqh, and was followed in this approach by parts of the Shafi&#x27;i madhhab. In contrast, the Hanbali and Maliki madhhabs discouraged theological speculation. Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (853–944 AD) developed his own form of Kalām, differing from the Ash&#x27;ari view in the question of Man&#x27;s free will and God&#x27;s omnipotence. Maturidi Kalām was often used in combination with Hanafi fiqh in the northwestern parts of the Islamic world.

A distinct school of theology often called traditionalist theology emerged under the leadership of Ahmad ibn Hanbal in the early centuries of Islam among hadith scholars who rejected rationalistic argumentation. In the wake of the Ash&#x27;arite synthesis between Mu&#x27;tazilite rationalism and Hanbalite literalism, its original form survived among a minority of mostly Hanbalite scholars. While Ash&#x27;arism and Maturidism are often called the Sunni &quot;orthodoxy&quot;, traditionalist theology has thrived alongside it, laying rival claims to be the orthodox Sunni faith.

Islamic theology experienced further developments among Shia theologians.

==Cosmopolitan scholarly tradition==
The study of, and commentaries on Quran and hadith, debates about &quot;ijtihad&quot; and &quot;taqlid&quot; and the issuing of &quot;fatwa&quot; as well as the use of Arabic, and later also Persian as common languages of discourse constituted the religious authority of the ulama throughout the entire Islamic world. Zaman has demonstrated that, as personal contacts were key to acquiring knowledge, Islamic scholars sometimes travel far in search of knowledge &quot;(ṭalab al-ʿilm)&quot;. Due to their common training and language, any scholars travelling from one region of the Islamic world to another can easily integrate themselves into the local Muslim community and hold offices there: The traveller Ibn Battuta (1304–1368 or 1369), born in Tangiers, Morocco, to a family of ulema, was appointed qadi by Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq of Delhi. Nuruddin ar-Raniri (d. 1658), born to a Gujarati Muslim family, travelled to, and worked as Shaykh ul-Islam in modern-day Indonesia under the protection of Iskandar Thani, Sultan of Aceh. Both scholars were able to move freely in an &quot;interconnected world of fellow scholars&quot;. According to Zaman, their offices and positions as respected scholars were only questioned if they proved themselves unfamiliar with local customs (as happened to Ibn Battuta]), or met resistance from opponents with stronger local roots (ar-Raniri).

Through their travels and teachings, ulama are able to transmit new knowledge and ideas over considerable distances. However, according to Zaman (2010), scholars have often been required to rely on commonly known texts which could support their &quot;fatwas&quot;. A text which might be widely known within the intellectual circles of one region could be unknown in another. The ability of scholars from one region to support their argument in another might therefore be limited by the familiarity with the respective texts of the community they are working in. In an era without book print or mass communication media, a scholar&#x27;s reputation might have remain limited if he was unfamiliar with the local canon of texts. As the &quot;ijazah&quot;, the scholar&#x27;s approval by another master, is key to the scholar&#x27;s reputation, the latter would be greater in regions where the approving masters is more widely known.

==Political and cultural history==
===Early Muslim communities===
The second caliph, Umar ibn al-Khattab, funded a group of Muslims to study the revelations, stories of Muhammed&#x27;s life, &quot;and other pertinent data, so that when he needed expert advice&quot; he could draw it from these &quot;people of the bench&quot;. According to Tamim Ansary, this group evolved into the &quot;Ulama&quot;

===&quot;Fiqh&quot;===
The formative period of Islamic jurisprudence stretches back to the time of the early Muslim communities. In this period, jurists were more concerned with pragmatic issues of authority and teaching than with theory. Progress in theory began to develop with the coming of the early Muslim jurist Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi&#x27;i (767–820), who codified the basic principles of Islamic jurisprudence in his book &quot;ar-Risālah&quot;. The book details the four roots of law (Qur&#x27;an, Sunnah, &quot;ijma&quot;, and &quot;qiyas&quot;) while specifying that the primary Islamic texts (the Qur&#x27;an and the hadith) must be understood according to objective rules of interpretation derived from scientific study of the Arabic language.

According to Feldman (2008), under many Muslim caliphate states and later states ruled by sultans, the ulama were regarded as the guardians of Islamic law and prevented the Caliph from dictating legal results, with the ruler and ulama forming a sort of &quot;separation of powers&quot; in government. Laws were decided based on the &quot;Ijma&quot; (consensus) of the Ummah (community), which was most often represented by the legal scholars.

===Early modern Islamic empires===
The Sunni Ottoman, and the Shi&#x27;a Safavid Persian dynasties, rulers of the two opponent early modern Islamic empires, both relied on ulama in order to legitimise their power. In both empires, ulama patronised by the royal courts created &quot;official&quot; religious doctrines which supported the dynastic rule. At the high points of their political power, respectively, the development took different paths: The Ottoman Sultan Süleyman I successfully integrated the imperial ulama into the imperial bureaucracy, and Ottoman secular law into Islamic law. In contrast, Shah Abbas I of Persia was unable to gain similar support by the Shi&#x27;a ulama, who retained a more independent position. During the late Safavid empire, the Shi&#x27;a ulama developed into one of the warrantors of continuity in a period of instability of the central government, thus securing a relative independency which they retained during the reign of subsequent dynasties.

====Ottoman imperial Sunni ulama====
After the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the leaders and subjects of the Ottoman Empire became increasingly aware of its role as a great power of its time. This new self-awareness was associated with the idea to legitimise the new political role by linking the religious scholarship to the political system: Ottoman historians of the 15th and 16th century like Ibn Zunbul or Eyyûbî, described the deeds of the Ottoman sultans in terms of idealised Islamic ghazi warriors. According to Burak (2015), the Ottoman literature genres of the &quot;rank order&quot; ( and the &quot;biografic lexicon&quot; () compiled the biographies of scholars in such ways as to create a concise and coherent tradition of the doctrine and structure of the Ottoman imperial scholarship. During the 16th century, scholars like the Shaykh al-Islām Kemālpaşazade (d. 1534), Aḥmād b. Muṣṭafā Taşköprüzāde (1494–1561), Kınalızāde ʿAli Çelebi (d. 1572) and Ali ben Bali (1527–1584) established a seamless chain of tradition from Abu Hanifa to their own time. Explicitly, some authors stated that their work must not only be understood as the historiography of the Hanafi madhhab, but that it should be consulted in case of eventual disagreements within the school of law. This exemplifies their purpose to establish a canon of Hanafi law within the Ottoman imperial scholarship. which modern Ottomanists termed the &quot;Ottoman Islam&quot;.

After 1453, Mehmed the Conqueror (1432–1481) had established eight madrasas in former Byzantine church buildings, and later founded the &quot;sahn-ı şeman&quot; or &quot;Eight courtyards madrasa&quot;, adjacent to the Fatih mosque, where he brought together the most distinguished Islamic law scholars of his territory. In his 2015 study on the &quot;second formation of Islamic law&quot;, Burak has shown in detail how the Ottoman state gradually imposed upon the traditional ulama a hierarchy of &quot;official imperial scholars&quot;, appointed and paid by the central government. From the conquest of the Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo in 1517 onwards, the Ottoman ulama set up their own interpretation of the Sunni Hanafi doctrine which then served as the official religious doctrine of the empire. The formal acknowledgment by decree of the sultan became a prerequisite to issue fatwas. In the 17th century, the annalist al-Hamawi used the expression &quot;sultanic mufti&quot; (&quot;al-ifta&#x27; al-sultani&quot;) to delineate the difference between the officially appointed religious leaders and those who had followed the traditional way of education. Other authors at that time called the Ottoman law scholars &quot;Hanafi of Rūm [i.e., the Ottoman Empire]&quot; &quot;(Rūmi ḫānāfi)&quot;, &quot;Scholars of Rūm&quot; &quot;(ʿulamā&#x27;-ı rūm)&quot; or &quot;Scholars of the Ottoman Empire&quot; (&quot;ʿulamā&#x27; al-dawla al-ʿUthmaniyyā&quot;). The Shaykh al-Islām () in Istanbul became the highest-ranking Islamic scholar within, and head of the ulama throughout the empire.

The ulama in the Ottoman Empire had a significant influence over politics due to the belief that secular institutions were all subordinate to Islamic law, the Sharia (). The ulama were responsible for interpreting the religious law, therefore they claimed that their power superseded that of the government. Within the Ottoman hierarchy of ulama, the Shaykh al-Islām held the highest rank. He exerted his influence by issuing fatwas, his written interpretations of the sharia had authority over the entire Ottoman population. In the 16th century, as the support by the ulama of the sultan and the central government was essential for shaping the still-growing empire, the importance of the office rose, and its power increased. As members of the &quot;Ilmiye&quot;, the imperial scholars were part of the Ottoman elite class of the Askeri, and were exempt from any taxes.

However, by approving scholars and appointing them to offices, over time the sultan&#x27;s influence increased over the religious scholars, although, as a Muslim, he still stood under the Islamic law. Even the Shaykh al-Islām was subordinate to the sultan; his position, like the ranks of the muftis, was described as a &quot;service&quot; () or &quot;rank&quot; ( or &quot;paye-ı Sahn&quot;), to which a candidate was appointed or elevated. Sometimes, the sultans made use of their power: In 1633, Murad IV gave order to execute the Shaykh al-Islām Ahīzāde Ḥüseyin Efendi. In 1656, Shaykh al-Islām Ḥocazāde Mesʿud Efendi was sentenced to death by sultan Mehmed IV.

The use of the Sunni Islam as a legitimisation of the Ottoman dynastic rule is closely linked to Sultan Süleyman I and his kazasker and later Schaykh al-Islām Ebussuud Efendi. Ebussuud compiled an imperial book of law (&quot;ḳānūn-nāme&quot;), which combined religious law &quot;(sharīʿah)&quot; with secular dynastic law &quot;(ḳānūn)&quot; in the person of the sultan. For example, Ebussuud provided a reason why the government could own land, or could levy and increase taxes, as the government was responsible for the protection of the common good of all Muslims.

====Shi&#x27;a state religion of Safavid Persia====
Shaikh Safi-ad-Din Ardabili (1252–1334) was the founder of the Safaviyya tariqa. Safi ad-Din&#x27;s great-great grandson Ismail, who from 1501 onwards ruled over the Persian Empire, was the founder of the Safavid dynasty. Shah Ismail I proclaimed the Twelver Shi&#x27;a as the new Persian state religion. To propagate the Safavid faith, he invited ulama from Qom, Jabal &#x27;Āmil in southern Lebanon and Syria to travel around Iran and promote the Shi&#x27;a doctrine. In 1533, Shah Tahmasp I commissioned a new edition of the Safvat as-safa, Shaikh Ṣāfī&#x27;s genealogy. It was rewritten in order to support the royal family&#x27;s claim at descendency from Musa al-Kadhim, the Seventh Imam, and thus to legitimise the Safavid rule.

During the reign of Shah Abbas I (1571 – 1629 AD), the argument of the theocratic unity of religious and political power was no longer sufficient to legitimise the Shah&#x27;s authority: Shi&#x27;a ulama renounced the monarch&#x27;s claim to represent the hidden Imam by teaching that descendancy did not necessarily mean representation. Likewise, as the influence of Sufi mysticism weakened, the Shah&#x27;s role as the head of the Safaviyya lost its significance as a justification for his political role. Abbas I thus sought to associate himself with eminent ulama like Shaykh Bahāʾi (1574–1621 AD), whom he made Shaykh al-Islām in his new capital, Isfahan. Other famous ulama working under Abbas&#x27;s patronage were Mir Damad (d. 1631 or 1632 AD), one of the founders of the School of Isfahan, and Ahmad ibn Muhammad Ardabili (d. 1585). By their teachings, they further developed the Shi&#x27;a Islamic teachings and religious practice. However, as religion did no longer suffice to support political power in Persia, Abbas I had to develop independent concepts to legitimise his rule. He did so by creating a new &quot;ghulam&quot; army, thus evoking the Turco-Mongol tradition of Timur and his reign.

===19th century===
====New Ottoman scholarly elite====
By the beginning of the 19th century, the Ottoman ulama still retained their political influence. When sultan Selim III tried to reform the Ottoman army, the ulama opposed his plans, which they rejected as an apostasy from Islam. Consequently, his reform failed. However, Selims successor Mahmud II (r. 1808–1839) was more successful: He called the new troops, organised according to European models, by the name &quot;Victorious army of Muhammad&quot; (&quot;Asâkir-i Mansure-i Muhammediye&quot;). By doing so, he was able to overcome the accusation of apostasy and secure the ulama&#x27;s support. Mahmuds reforms created a new imperial elite class who spoke Western European languages and were knowledgeable of the Western European societies and their political systems. As the political and economic pressure increased on the Ottoman Empire in the course of the 19th century, this new elite carried on the Sultan&#x27;s reforms and helped initiating a new era of reform, the Tanzimat. In parallel, the political influence of the ulama was circumvented and reduced step by step. A ministry for religious endowments was created in order to control the finances of the vakıf. Thus, the ulama lost direct control over their finances, which significantly reduced their capacity to exert political influence.

====Orthodox Shi&#x27;a ulama in post-Safavid and Qajar Iran====
In Iran, a period of political instability began with the collapse of the Safavid reign after shah Sultan Husayns death in 1722. In the light of the discontinuity and fragmentation of the central government, two social groups maintained continuity and, consequently, rose in power: Tribal chieftains established, amongst others, the Khanates of the Caucasus, the Afsharid and Zand dynasties. The second group who benefitted from the weakness of the central authority was the Shi&#x27;a ulama. According to Garthwaite (2010), &quot;the ulama constituted one institution that not only provided continuity, but gradually asserted its role over and against royal authority.&quot; A process of change began which continued throughout the 19th century and into the present.

Already some of the last Safavids, Sulayman Shah (r. 1666–1694) and Tahmasp II (r. 1722–1732) had sought the ulama&#x27;s support in an attempt to strengthen their authority. Particularly, they associated themselves with a group of ulama who supported the &quot;official&quot; Twelver Shi&#x27;a doctrine, established by the Iranian Shaykh al-Islām Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi (1627–1699) during the later decades of Safavid rule. The dispute between the Twelver Shi&#x27;a and Mir Damad&#x27;s (d. 1631 or 1632) and Mulla Sadra&#x27;s (c. 1571/2 – 1640) School of Isfahan, who promoted Sufi mysticism and Islamic philosophy, continued throughout the 18th century, and shaped the relationship between ulama and government during the reigns of the subsequent dynasties.

With the accession of Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar to the Iranian throne, the Qajar dynasty consolidated the central power. However, the Qajar Shahs, in particular Naser al-Din Shah Qajar (r. 1848–1896), whose reign paralleled that of the Ottoman Sultans of the Tanzimat time, failed at obtaining central control over the ulama. The Shiite scholars retained their political influence on the Persian society. They also maintained unrestricted access to the financial resources from the religious endowments. In addition, the Islamic Zakat tax was paid to individual imams and not to state-sponsored tax collectors. Both their religious influence and their financial means allowed the Shiite ulama to act, at times, against the Shah. Thus, under the Qajar dynasty, the ulama provided a source of religious legitimacy and served as interpreters of religious law in a dual legal system where the state administered law based on custom &quot;(ʻurf)&quot;.

===19th/20th century: Ulama and Muslim reform===
====Reformers and concepts====
Starting in the first half of the 19th century, direct contacts began and gradually increased between members of the ulama and modern Western Europe. The Egyptian alim Rifa&#x27;a al-Tahtawi (1801–1873) was amongst the first members of the ulama who travelled to Europe. As a religious counsellor to a delegation by the Egyptian khedive Muhammad Ali Pasha he stayed in Paris from 1826 to 1831. His report &quot;The Extraction of Gold or an Overview of Paris&quot; (&quot;Taḫlīṣ al-ibrīz fī talḫīṣ Bārīz&quot;) (1849) included some outlines of future reforms and potential improvements in his native country. Although al-Tahtawi had gone through the traditional education of an alim, his interest focused on modern French concepts of administration and economy. He only referred to Islam in order to emphasize that Muslims can adopt practical knowledge and insights from Europe. As such, lt-Tahtawi&#x27;s report reflects the political efforts of Muhammad Ali Pasha, who did not intend to reform al-Azhar university, but aimed at building an independent educational system sponsored by his government.

Hayreddin Pasha (1822/3–1890) was an Ottoman Tunisian alim and statesman who reformed the administration and jurisdiction of the province. He was able to explain his ideas in French (&quot;Réformes nécessaires aux États musulmans&quot; – Necessary reforms of the Muslim states. Paris, 1868), which he had learned whilst representing his sovereign Ahmad Bey at the court of Napoleon III from 1852 to 1855. In contrast to al-Tahtawi, Hayreddin Pasha used the religious concept of the Muslim collective interest &quot;(maṣlaḥa)&quot; to make his point, thereby applying the idea of ijtihad to public affairs.

Positions comparable to the Western Islamic ulama were also taken in the Eastern parts of the Islamic world by Syed Ahmad Khan, the pioneering Muslim modernist in South Asia, and Jamal al-Din al-Afghani. The latter is regarded as the mentor of Pan-Islamism, but also as one of the founders of the political Islam and of the late 19th and 20th century Salafi movement.

The Egyptian Grand Mufti Muhammad Abduh (1849–1905), who was granted the degree of &#x27;Alim by al-Azhar university in 1877, was the first who used the term Islāh in order to denote political and religious reforms. Until 1887 he edited together with al-Afghani the newspaper &quot;al-ʿUrwa al-Wuthqā&quot; (&quot;The firm bond&quot;). The gazette widely spread the pan-islamistic concept of Islam representing a religious bond which was believed to be stronger than nationality or language. From 1876 on, Abduh edited the newspaper &quot;al-Ahrām&quot;. Since 1898, he also edited, together with Rashid Rida (1865–1935), the newspaper &quot;al-Manār&quot; (&quot;The Beacon&quot;), in which he further developed his ideas. &quot;al-Manār&quot; appeared in print for almost 40 years and was read throughout the Islamic world.

ʿAbduh understood Islah as a concept of &quot;reform of mankind&quot; &quot;(iṣlāḥ nauʿ al-insān)&quot;. In his works, he emphasized the special importance of a reform of the traditional madrasa system, which was taken to disadvantage by the parallel establishment of the secular, state-sponsored educational system in Egypt. He strove at reconciling the traditional and modern educational systems, thereby justifying from the point of view of Islam the introduction of modern institutions by the national state. He referred to the Islamic concept of the collective interest or common good of the Muslim community &quot;(maṣlaḥa)&quot;, to which he accorded overarching importance &quot;(al-maṣlaḥa shar)&quot; in the interest of his fellow Muslims. The concept of &quot;islāh&quot; gained special relevance for the future, as it strives at understanding and justifying all aspects of modern life from the Islamic doctrine.

After Abduh&#x27;s death in 1905, Rashīd Ridā continued editing &quot;al-Manār&quot; on his own. In 1924, he published a collection of writings by some ulama of Najd: &quot;Maǧmūʿat al-ḥadiṭ an-naǧdīya&quot;. Thus, the teachings of the Yemeni alim Muhammad ash-Shawkani (1759–1839), which had already been discussed since the 1880s, gained greater publicity. Likewise, the writings of the Hanbali scholar Ibn Taymiyyah (1263–1328) came to attention again. Ibn Taymiyyah&#x27;s doctrine provided a link between the &quot;wahhabiyya&quot; and parts of the &quot;salafiyya&quot; movements. The theological differences between the two movements were altogether too large for a complete union of the two doctrines. However, the opening of the Salafi movement towards Wahhabism helped to reconcile the latter with the Islamic public after king Ibn Saud&#x27;s invasion of the Hijaz in 1924. The Central Arabian militias (&quot;Iḫwān&quot;) had occupied and looted the holy towns of Mecca and Medina, thereby destroying monuments which they considered pagan (&quot;shirk&quot;). Starting with the Pan-Islamic Congress in Mecca in 1926, the pro-Saudi movement developed into one of the most relevant currents of Islamic thought.

In his Egyptian exile, the Syrian alim Abd ar-Rahman al-Kawakibi (1854–1902) met al-Afghani, Abduh and Rida. In his books &quot;Ṭabāʾiʿ al-istibdād&quot; (&quot;The nature of despotism&quot;) and &quot;Umm al-Qurā&quot; (&quot;Mother of villages [i.e., Mecca]&quot;, 1899) he accused the Ottoman sultan Abdülhamid II of corrupting the Islamic community. The Ottoman despotism &quot;encroaches on the rights of its citizens, keeps them ignorant to keep them passive, [and] denies their right to take an active part in human life&quot;. Therefore, the law must be reformed. By the use of &quot;ijtihad&quot;, a &quot;modern and unified system of law&quot; must be created, and &quot;proper religious education&quot; must be provided. Because of the central position of the Arabic peoples in the &quot;ummah&quot; and the Arabic language in the intellectual discourse, but also because &quot;Arabian Islam is ... free from modern corruptions and the bedouin are free from the moral decay and passivity of despotism&quot;, the balance of power must shift from the Turks towards the Arabs. The Ottoman dynasty must give up their claim to the caliphate, and a new caliph of Quraysh descent must be elected by representatives of the &quot;ummah&quot;. His temporal authority would be set up in the Hejaz, whilst he would hold religious authority over the entire Muslim community, &quot;assisted ... by a consultative council nominated by the Muslim rulers&quot;.

Al-Kawākibīs idea that the Arabian doctrine represented a more puristic form of the Islam, according to Cleveland and Bunton (2016), prepared the ground for the 20th century Arab nationalism as well as the Islamic renewal movement of the Nahda.

====Muslim mass organizations====
In 1912, the Muhammadiyah organization was founded in Yogyakarta (in modern-day Indonesia), which, together with Nahdlatul Ulama (&quot;Reawakening of the ulama&quot;), founded in 1926, form the two largest Muslim organizations in the world. Since the 1930s, their religious boarding schools (&quot;pesantren&quot;) also taught mathematics, natural sciences, English and history. Since the 1980, the Nahdlatul Ulama schools also offered degrees in economy, jurisdiction, paedagogical and medical sciences. In the 1990s, under their leader Abdurrahman Wahid, the organization adopted an anti-fundamentalistic doctrine, teaching democracy and pluralism.

Darul Uloom Deoband, next to al-Azhar one of the most influential madrasas, was founded in the city of Deoband, Uttar Pradesh, in 1867. Initially, the intention of the school was to help Indian Muslims, who had become subjects of the British Empire after 1857, to lead their lives according to Islamic law. The Deobandi propagate a Sunni Islam of the Hanafi school, which was the most prevalent madhhab in South Asia. Still today, they aim at a revival of the Islamic society and education. Following the example of Deoband, thousands of madrasas were founded during the late 19th century which adopted the Deobandi way of studying fundamental texts of Islam and commenting on Quran and Hadith. By referring back to traditional Islamic scholars, the Deobandi School aims at defending the traditional Islamic madhhab, especially the Hanafi, against criticism which arose from other Islamic schools like the Ahl-i Hadith. During the 1990s, the Afghan &quot;taliban&quot; also referred to the Deoband School. Ashraf Ali Thanwi (1863–1943) is one of the most prominent teachers of Darul Uloom Deoband. Thanwi initiated and edited multi-volume encyclopedic commentaries on the Quran. However, he was also able to reach out to a larger audience: His book Bahishti Zewar, which is still widely read in South Asia, as it details, amongst other topics, the proper conduct and beliefs for Muslim women.

Ahl-i Hadith is a movement which emerged in North India in the mid-19th century. By rejecting &quot;taqlid&quot; (following legal precedent) and favoring &quot;ijtihad&quot; (independent legal reasoning) based on the foundational scriptures of Islam, they oppose the traditional madhhab and criticize their reliance on legal authorities other than the traditional texts. The Ahl-i Hadith was the first organization which printed and spread the works of Muhammad ash-Shawkani, whose writings did also influence the doctrine of the Salafi movement in the Arab Middle East and worldwide.

Muslim World League is an international non-governmental Islamic organization based in Mecca, Saudi Arabia that is a member of UNICEF, UNESCO and OIC. It aims to resolve the issues faced by the Islamic community by organizing scholarly conferences with the ulama around the world in order to form public Islamic opinions based on principles of moderation, peace and harmony.

===Ulama in the secular national states of the 20th century===
In most countries, the classical institution of the madrasa as a place of teaching remained largely intact until the beginning of the 20th century. In the Western parts of the Islamic world, national states arose from the disintegration and partition of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War. The government of Kemalist Turkey sought to distance the nation from the religious traditions and institutions of the Ottoman past.

In Egypt, the establishment of a state-controlled educational system had already begun in the 1820s. From 1961 onwards, Gamal Abdel Nasser tried to increase the state control over ancient Islamic institutions like al-Azhar university. The head of al-Azhar was—and still is—appointed directly by the president, and new faculties were created in this ancient Islamic institution.

Initially giving rise to modernist reforms, up to a certain degree the state-sponsored faculties were able to retain their independence from government control. However, as Pierret has pointed out in detail for Syria, in some countries the orthodox madrasa system remained largely intact, its decentralised organisation protecting it from state control. In fact, the government&#x27;s attempt at controlling the religious education focussed largely on the academic institutions and neglected the traditional madrasas. By their continuing ability to provide social support and access to an educational alternative which was propagated as being more orthodox according to Islamic faith, the traditional ulama not only maintained their influence on large parts of the population, but actually increased their political influence and power.

====Republic of Turkey====
In the Kemalist Republic of Turkey, traditional Ottoman religious institutions were abolished like the Ottoman Caliphate, the office of the Shaykh ul-Islam, as well as the dervish brotherhoods. The Presidency of Religious Affairs (, or Diyanet) was created in 1924 by article 136 of the Constitution of Turkey by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey as a successor to the office of the Shaykh ul-Islam. From 1925 onwards, the traditional dervish tekkes and Islamic schools were dissolved. Famous convents like the Tekke of the Mevlevi order in Konya were secularized and turned into museums.

====Iran====
In Iran, contrary to many other Islamic countries, the Shi&#x27;a ulama have maintained their religious authority together by Khums tax. Thus, they maintained their ability to exert political pressure.

Between 1905 and 1911, a coalition of ulama, bazaari, and some radical reformers incited the Persian Constitutional Revolution, which led to the establishment of the parliament (majlis) of Iran during the Qajar dynasty.

The Islamic Revolution in Iran was led by a senior Shia cleric—the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini—who then established the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist.

====Syria====
In his study &quot;Religion and State in Syria&quot; (2013), Pierret pointed out how the training of Syria&#x27;s ulama gradually became more institutionalised, based upon the traditional madrasa system. In 1920, the madrasa of the Khusruwiyah Mosque complex (which was to be destroyed in 2014 during the Syrian Civil War) introduced an entrance exam and a stable curriculum for its Islamic seminary. Graduates were issued a diploma carrying the name of the institution, which bore the signatures of all teachers, signifying individual &quot;ijazah&quot;. In 1947, courses also included natural sciences and foreign languages. In 1947, the state-run &quot;Faculty of Sharia&quot; was initiated in Damascus by Kamal al-Qassab (1853–1954), a former student of Muhammad Abduh (1849–1905) in Cairo. Until 1954, all Syrian ulama aiming at higher degrees had to join Al-Azhar University in Cairo. In 1954, however, Syria&#x27;s first higher faculty of sharia was founded by members of the modernist wing of the Muslim Brotherhood. Its curriculum, which included economy and the &quot;current situation of the Muslim world&quot;, according to Pierret, &quot;anticipated the 1961 modernist reform of al-Azhar by Nasser&quot;. In 1972, the curriculum of the state-run &quot;Sharia high schools&quot; was reformed again, thus providing access for their students to all faculties of Syrian high schools.

According to Pierret (2015), the Ba&#x27;ath Party coup of 1963 brought about a weakening of the state-controlled sharia high schools by the secular government. Many teachers of the Damascus faculty of sharia were forced into exile during the 1960s. Attempts of the regime during the 1980s at changing the curricula of the faculty and create a new &quot;Ba&#x27;athist ulama&quot; failed. The faculty, maintaining their ability to recruit competent teachers, was able to resist the political pressure. Consequently, the Syrian government prohibited the faculty to grant doctorates until 1998, and delayed the establishment of another faculty in Aleppo until 2006.

====Tunisia, Egypt, Iraq====
In 1961, Gamal Abdel Nasser put the Al-Azhar University under the direct control of the state. &quot;Azharis were given military uniforms and found themselves marching in step under the orders of army officers.&quot; After the independence of Algeria, President Ahmed Ben Bella also deprived the Algerian ulama of their power. Baathist repression in Iraq led to a drop of enrollment in the Shia holy cities of Iraq from 12,000 students in the early 1900s to only 600 scholars and students in 1977.

====Pakistan====
In the 1980s and 1990s, competition arose between Sunni and Shia interests in Pakistan, with Saudi Arabian humanitarian organizations using the sponsorship of madrasas to spread their Wahhabi doctrine, while the Islamic Republic of Iran used Shiite madrasas to similarly peddle influence. For poorer communities in Pakistan, internationally sponsored madrasas could be the only accessible form of education.

This influence from institutions which were financially independent from the state led to a resurgence of the social and political influence of the traditional ulama, while the insufficient state control over the educational institutions, insufficient qualification of the teachers and ideologic indoctrination of such institutions all become considerable issues. Graduates &quot;(talib)&quot; from North Pakistani madrasas like &quot;Mullah&quot; Mohammed Omar subsequently played a role in the establishment of the Afghan Taliban regime.

==Modern challenges==
Some opinions from within the Muslim world have criticized the lack of scientific training of the ulama, and argued that those proficient in the sciences should qualify for this title. In Egypt, the Al-Azhar University has begun to introduce scientific and practical subjects in its traditional theological colleges to help the ulama face the challenges of the modern world. Sudanese politician Hassan Al-Turabi argued, in his work The Islamic State, that the ulama should not be limited to those versed in religious affairs but include experts in fields such as engineering, science, politics, and education because all knowledge is divine and God-given.

<text>Cheddar Gorge is a limestone gorge in the Mendip Hills, near the village of Cheddar, Somerset, England. The gorge is the site of the Cheddar show caves, where Britain&#x27;s oldest complete human skeleton, Cheddar Man, estimated to be 9,000 years old, was found in 1903. Older remains from the Upper Late Palaeolithic era (12,000–13,000 years ago) have been found. The caves, produced by the activity of an underground river, contain stalactites and stalagmites. The gorge is part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest called Cheddar Complex.

Cheddar Gorge, including the caves and other attractions, has become a tourist destination. In a 2005 poll of &quot;Radio Times&quot; readers, following its appearance on the television programme &quot;Seven Natural Wonders&quot; (2005), Cheddar Gorge was named as the second greatest natural wonder in Britain, surpassed only by Dan yr Ogof caves.
The gorge attracts about 500,000 visitors per year.

== Geology ==

Cheddar is a gorge lying on the southern edge of the Mendip Hills. The maximum depth of the gorge is , with a near-vertical cliff-face to the south, and steep grassy slopes to the north. The B3135 road runs along the bottom of the gorge.

The area is underlain by Black Rock slate, Burrington Oolite and Clifton Down Limestone of the Carboniferous Limestone Series, which contain ooliths and fossil debris, on top of Old Red Sandstone and by dolomitic conglomerate of the Keuper. Evidence for Variscan orogeny is seen in the sheared rock and cleaved shales. In many places weathering of these strata has resulted in the formation of immature calcareous soils.

The gorge was originally formed 225 million years ago, during the Triassic Period. The Mendip Carboniferous limestone, stood as a series of &#x27;whale backed&#x27; hills. At that time the UK had a warm arid climate, not dissimilar to northern Africa today. Occasionally &#x27;flash floods&#x27; cause huge volumes of water to run off the hills and form Wadis - steep sided gorges. Cheddar gorge and its near neighbour, Burrington Combe are exhumed Wadies. They were originally filled with Triassic rocks that may have been eroded out by meltwaters, at the end of the last Ice age. Parts of Burrington Combe still have these Triassic rocks, forming an unconformity with the Carboniferous limestones, along their sides and bottom. 

During the ice ages, permafrost blocked the caves with ice and frozen mud and made the limestone impermeable. When this melted during the summers, water was forced to flow on the surface, and carved out the softer Triassic rocks, exhuming the wadi. During warmer periods, the water flowed underground through the permeable limestone, creating the caves and leaving the gorge dry, so that today much of the gorge has no river until the underground Cheddar Yeo river emerges in the lower part from Gough&#x27;s Cave. The river is used by Bristol Water, who maintain a series of dams and ponds which supply the nearby Cheddar Reservoir, via a diameter pipe that takes water just upstream of the Rotary Club Sensory Garden, a public park in the gorge opposite Jacob&#x27;s Ladder.

The gorge is susceptible to flooding. In the Chew Stoke flood of 1968, the flow of water washed large boulders down the gorge, damaging the cafe and entrance to Gough&#x27;s Cave and washing away cars. In the cave itself the flooding lasted for three days. In 2012 the B3135, the road through the gorge, was closed for several weeks following damage to the road surface during extensive flooding.

== Ownership ==
The south side of the gorge is owned and administered by the Marquess of Bath&#x27;s Longleat Estate. The cliffs on the north side of the gorge are owned by The National Trust. Every year, both of the gorge&#x27;s owners contribute funds towards the clearance of scrub, bush and trees from the area.

Most of the commercial visitor activity in the gorge is on the Longleat-owned south side, including access to the two main commercial show caves and the visitor centre, which is operated by Longleat-owned company Cheddar Gorge and Caves Ltd.. Because visitors to the show caves have decreased from 400,000 a year in the 1980s to 150,000 in 2013, Ceawlin Thynn, Viscount Weymouth, who runs the Longleat estate on behalf of the family trust, proposed the installation of a 18-gondola cable car at an estimated cost of £10m, which would take visitors from the entrance area to the caves directly to the top of the southside cliffs. The National Trust opposed the proposed development, stating that it would spoil the view and cheapen the experience, creating a &quot;fairground ride&quot; that would make the area feel more like an amusement park. Planning permission was planned in Spring 2014, which would have meant that operations would start in Spring 2016. In 2015 the financial feasibility was still being investigated.

== Ecology ==

Notable species at the gorge include dormice, yellow-necked mice, slowworms and adders and the rare large blue butterfly (&quot;Maculinea arion&quot;), and small pearl-bordered fritillary (&quot;Boloria selene&quot;).

A wide variety of wild birds may be seen in Cheddar Gorge including peregrine falcon, buzzard, kestrel, raven and grasshopper warbler.

The flora include chalk grassland-loving species such as marjoram and wild thyme. The Cheddar pink, &quot;Dianthus gratianopolitanus&quot;, also known as firewitch, only grows in the wild in the gorge. It was once common in the gorge but declined after being picked by collectors. It is also home to unique species of whitebeam.
The nationally rare little robin geranium (&quot;Geranium purpureum&quot;), and Cheddar bedstraw (&quot;Galium fleurotii&quot;) and the nationally scarce species include slender tare (&quot;Vicia tenuissima&quot;), dwarf mouse-ear (&quot;Cerastium pumilum&quot;) and rock stonecrop (&quot;Sedum forsteranum&quot;) also occur in the gorge. It is one of the few localities in England with native populations of the Welsh poppy &quot;Papaver cambricum&quot;. It is one of the very few areas in southern Britain where the lichens &quot;Solorina saccata&quot;, &quot;Squamaria cartilaginea&quot; and &quot;Caloplaca cirrochroa&quot; can be found.

The gorge is also an important site for whitebeams and in 2009 a survey was carried out by botanists from the Welsh National Herbarium as part of a nationwide survey of whitebeams. Among the eight species identified were three new species previously unknown to science. Nineteen specimens with oval-shaped leaves were named the &quot;Cheddar whitebeam&quot;, &quot;Sorbus cheddarensis&quot;, fifteen specimens with roundish leaves and greyish brown bark were named the &quot;Twin Cliffs whitebeam&quot;, &quot;Sorbus eminentoides&quot;, and thirteen with long, narrow leaves were named &quot;Gough’s Rock whitebeam&quot;, &quot;Sorbus rupicoloides&quot;. The Cheddar whitebeam, which has evolved as a cross between the common whitebeam and the grey-leaved whitebeam, is unique to the gorge, but its survival is threatened by the goats that were introduced specifically to keep down the growth of new trees and encourage the proliferation of rare plant species such as the Cheddar pink. Cuttings have been taken from the trees to be grafted and grown on at the Welsh National Herbarium.

Longleat Estate has fenced off a large part of its land and has introduced goats, as part of a programme to encourage the biodiversity of the area; the goats were intended to replace the sheep that grazed in the gorge until the 1970s. The National Trust announced in March 2007 that it plans to release a flock of sheep on its side of the gorge for the same purpose, but will first consult local residents and interested parties on whether to fence off the gorge or introduce cattle grids to prevent the sheep from straying. There is already a small flock of feral Soay sheep in the gorge.

== Caves ==

The two main caves open to the public are on the southside of the Gorge, owned by Longleat Estate. The extensive Gough&#x27;s Cave and the smaller Cox&#x27;s Cave are both named after their respective discoverers. Both are known for their geology, and it has been suggested that the caves were used for maturing cheese in prehistoric times.

Gough&#x27;s cave, which was discovered in 1903, leads around into the rock-face, and contains a variety of large rock chambers and formations.
Cox&#x27;s Cave, discovered in 1837, is smaller but contains many intricate formations. In 2016 Cox&#x27;s cave was turned into &quot;Dreamhunters&quot;, a multimedia walk-through experience with theatrical lighting and video projection.

The Gorge&#x27;s many caves are home to colonies of Greater and Lesser horseshoe bats.

In 1999, the Channel 4 television programme &quot;Time Team&quot; investigated Cooper&#x27;s Hole in an attempt to find evidence of Palaeolithic human activity.

These caves are the inspirations for the glittering caves of Aglarond situated in the White Mountains behind Helm&#x27;s Deep in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, which was later founded as a new kingdom of Durin&#x27;s Folk by Gimli after the War of the Ring.

Several of the caves have been scheduled as ancient monuments as nationally important archaeological sites including: Gough&#x27;s Old Cave, Great Oone&#x27;s Hole, Saye&#x27;s Hole, Soldier&#x27;s Hole and Sun Hole.

== Recreational use ==

Cliff Road (B3135), which runs through the Gorge, offers a popular climb for bicyclists and has a maximum gradient of 16%. The ascent featured in stage 6 of the 2011 Tour of Britain.

There are about 590 graded rock climbing routes on the South side of the gorge, which are generally open to climbers between 1 October and 15 March each year. The North side of the gorge has about 380 climbing routes and the land is predominantly owned by the National Trust and mapped as Open Access land which give a right of access for climbers all year. Each of the routes is named and included in the British Mountaineering Council guidebook. Although the majority of the climbs are &quot;trad&quot; or &quot;traditional&quot;, which means that the leader places protection as they go up, there are also some &quot;sport&quot; routes where bolts are left in place. Climber Chris Bonington was the first to scale the &quot;Coronation Street&quot; route in 1965.

Visitors to the gorge have experienced a number of accidents. Rescue services, including local mountain rescue and cave rescue groups, frequently use the gorge to stage exercises. It is also used as a training location for military rescue helicopter pilots.

The Cheddar Man Museum of Prehistory inspired by the discovery of ancient hominids such as Cheddar Man contains information about the caves and their palaeontological development. Exhibits include original flint tools and human remains excavated from the caves. The Visitors&#x27; Centre and Restaurant is an important Modernist design by Geoffrey Jellicoe, dating from 1934. Jellicoe was commissioned by the fifth Marquess of Bath, and created a two-block structure with a rooftop pool. He drew inspiration from International Modernist buildings, including the De La Warr Pavilion. The integrity of the building has been greatly compromised. In the 1960s, the glass roof to the restaurant, and the pool set above it, were removed to increase seating capacity, and it has since been re-clad in poor quality materials. Michael Spens, in his comprehensive study, &quot;The Complete Landscape Designs and Gardens of Geoffrey Jellicoe&quot;, writes that it is &quot;now barely recognizable as a pioneer construction of the modern period&quot;.

There is a clifftop walk from Jacob&#x27;s Ladder along the crest of the gorge and back to the road, with views of the gorge. A caving experience is offered within Gough&#x27;s Cave. There is a path of 274 steps, built up the side of the gorge, known as Jacob&#x27;s Ladder after the Biblical description of a ladder to the heavens. A watchtower at the top provides a 360–degree view of the entire area and village. An open-top bus tour operates during the summer. Cheddar cheese is made in the lower part of the gorge.

==In popular culture==
In 1916, a location scene for the movie &quot;Just a Girl&quot; was filmed at Cheddar Gorge. The heroine, played by Daisy Burrell, had to fire a revolver while riding a pony, which bolted. Burrell clung on grimly, and filming had to be abandoned for the rest of the morning.

Gough&#x27;s Cave and Cox&#x27;s Cave were cited by author J. R. R. Tolkien as the inspiration for the Glittering Caves of Helm&#x27;s Deep in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. Tolkien and his wife, Edith Tolkien, took their honeymoon in Clevedon, 10 miles northwest of the gorge.

The British artist, drag performer, academic, and RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race UK series 4´s runner-up Michael John Atkins, was inspired by the landmark’s name (which they have visited several times during their childhood) to call their drag persona Cheddar Gorgeous.

<doc id="165518" wikidata="Q3020046" url="?curid=165518" title="DeMarcus Corley">
<text>DeMarcus Deon Corley (born June 3, 1974) is an American professional boxer. A veteran of the sport for more than two decades, he held the WBO junior welterweight title from 2001 to 2003, and has fought as a gatekeeper against many of boxing&#x27;s biggest names.

==Amateur career==
Corley was an amateur standout, and won the National Golden Gloves Light Welterweight Championship in 1995. Corley also had a record of 100-19.

==Professional career==
Corley began boxing professionally on May 17, 1996, knocking out Aaron Smith in the first round. Corley would not lose a match until 1999, against Daniel Lujan. Later that year in his 22nd bout with a record of 21 wins 1 defeat (11KO), he faced Ener Julio for the USBA light welterweight title. He won via a 12-round split decision.

===WBO light welterweight champion===
In 2001 Corley would stop Felix Flores in the first round to win the WBO light welterweight belt. He would later defeat Ener Julio again to defend his belt.

Corley took 2002 off from boxing to recover from the murder of his brother. This murder left Corley to care for his brother’s 7 children on top of the 7 children he already had. He returned to the ring on January 4, 2003.

====Loss to Judah====

After the Bernard Hopkins vs. Morrade Hakkar bout in Philadelphia in March 2003, Corley was involved in a brawl at a bar with former light welterweight champion Zab Judah which had to be broken up by the police

On the undercard of the rematch between Ricardo Mayorga and Vernon Forrest in July, Corley and Judah met in the ring. Corley was dropped by a looping left from Judah in the third round. He would work himself back into the bout during the middle rounds but Judah was able to control most of the fight by jabbing and moving and making Corley miss with his best punches.

At the end of 12 rounds judge Duane Ford, scored it 115–112 for Corley while judges Chuck Giampa and Michael Pernik, scored it 115–112 for Judah, giving him a split decision victory. HBO&#x27;s unofficial scorer Harold Lederman had it 116–111 for Judah.

====Cotto challenge====

In February 2005 Corley attempted to win back his WBO belt against Miguel Cotto, losing by 5th round TKO.

===WBC title shot===
In 2006 Corley fought Junior Witter for the vacant WBC light welterweight championship, losing a wide decision in a very tactical bout.

===Later career===
After many consecutive losses, Corley took on Damian Fuller in 2010 and improved his record to 37-13-1 (21 KOs) with a 4th-round TKO.

On August 28, 2010, Corley lost to Marcos Maidana by unanimous decision in a fight in which was disputed, for the WBA light welterweight title.

On November 14, 2010, Corley lost to Serhiy Fedchenko by unanimous decision in a fight in which was also disputed, for the vacant WBO European light welterweight title.

On January 21, 2012, Corley won the vacant NABF light welterweight title when he defeated Gabriel Bracero by unanimous decision.

===Bare knuckle boxing===
On March 19, 2021, Corley fought Reggie Barnett Jr in Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship. He lost the fight via retirement after the fourth round.

<text>A Close Shave is a 1995 British stop-motion animated short film co-written and directed by Nick Park and produced by Aardman Animations with Wallace &amp; Gromit Ltd., BBC Bristol and BBC Children&#x27;s International. It is the third film featuring Wallace &amp; Gromit, following &quot;A Grand Day Out&quot; (1989) and &quot;The Wrong Trousers&quot; (1993). In the film, Wallace and Gromit foil a sheep rustling operation operated by a sinister dog, Preston. 

&quot;A Close Shave&quot; was acclaimed and won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 68th Academy Awards. A spin-off television series based on the Shaun character, &quot;Shaun the Sheep&quot;, premiered in 2007.

== Plot ==
Wallace and his dog, Gromit, operate a window cleaning business. Wallace falls for the wool shopkeeper Wendolene Ramsbottom. Her sinister dog, Preston, rustles sheep to supply the shop. After a lost sheep wanders into the house, Wallace places him in his Knit-o-Matic, which shears sheep and knits the wool into jumpers. Wallace names the sheep Shaun.

Preston steals the Knit-o-Matic blueprints. When Gromit investigates, Preston captures him and frames him for the sheep rustling. Gromit is arrested and imprisoned, while Wallace&#x27;s house is inundated with sheep. Wallace and the sheep save Gromit and hide out in the fields. Wendolene and Preston arrive in the lorry to round up the sheep. When Wendolene demands Preston stop the rustling, he locks her in the lorry with the sheep and drives away, intent on turning them into dog food.

Wallace and Gromit give chase on their motorcycle. When Gromit&#x27;s sidecar detaches, he activates its aeroplane mode and resumes the chase from the air. Wallace becomes trapped in the lorry and he, Wendolene, and the sheep are transported to Preston&#x27;s dog food factory, where Preston has built an enormous Knit-o-Matic. The captives are loaded into the wash basin, but Shaun escapes. Shaun activates neon signs to reveal the factory&#x27;s location to Gromit, who attacks Preston. Shaun sucks Preston into the Knit-o-Matic, removing his fur. Wendolene reveals that Preston is a robot created by her deceased inventor father, and his behaviour is a result of him malfunctioning.

When the Knit-o-Matic dresses Preston in a sweater made of his fur, he inadvertently hits the controls, and the group become poised to fall into the mincing machine. Shaun pushes Preston into the machine, crushing him. Gromit is exonerated and Wallace rebuilds Preston as a harmless remote-controlled dog. Afterwards, Wallace is saddened when Wendolene leaves and tells him that she is allergic to cheese. When he tries to cheer himself up with some cheese, he finds that Shaun has eaten it all.

== Production ==
Peter Lord, the co-founder of Aardman, had Park simplify the script to keep the film to 30 minutes. Lord said it once contained &quot;the best scene we ever had to cut&quot;, a love scene based on &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; between Wallace and Wendolene set in Crewe railway station. A spin-off television series based on the Shaun character, &quot;Shaun the Sheep&quot;, premiered in 2007.

==Cast==
* Peter Sallis as Wallace

<doc id="165522" wikidata="Q20932" url="?curid=165522" title="Incheon International Airport">
<text>Incheon International Airport — or simply Incheon Airport — is the main international airport serving Seoul, the capital of South Korea. It is also one of the largest and busiest airports in the world.

This airport opened for business on 29 March 2001, to replace the older Gimpo International Airport, which now serves mostly domestic destinations and shuttle flights to several East Asian metropolitan areas, including Beijing–Capital, Kaohsiung, Osaka–Kansai, Shanghai–Hongqiao, Taipei–Songshan and Tokyo–Haneda.

Incheon International Airport is located west of Incheon&#x27;s city center, on an artificially created piece of land between Yeongjong and Yongyu Islands. A shallow sea originally separated the two islands. That area between the two islands was reclaimed for the construction project, effectively connecting the once-separate Yeongjong and Yongyu islands. The reclaimed area and the two islands are all part of Jung-gu, an administrative district of Incheon. The airport has 111 boarding gates altogether, with 44 in Terminal 1, 30 in Concourse A (connected to Terminal 1), and 37 in Terminal 2.

This airport was constructed to share the demand for air transport in the 21st century and to serve as a hub airport in Northeast Asia.

==History==
International air traffic to South Korea increased after the 1988 Summer Olympics. In the 1990s, it became apparent that Gimpo International Airport could not cope with the increased air traffic. The government decided to build a new international airport to reduce the load on Gimpo International Airport.

The new airport was originally planned to be located in Cheongju, southeast of Seoul, but due to its distance, it was opposed by Seoul and Gyeonggi citizens. Hwaseong, the other choice, was also rejected due to similar reasons. Finally, the area chosen was Incheon. 

In November 1992, the construction of the Incheon airport began on reclaimed land between Yeongjong Island and Youngyu Island. It took eight years to finish, with an additional six months for testing. Completion was initially scheduled for 1997 but delayed due to the Asian economic crisis. The airport was officially opened on 21 March 2001.

On 15 November 2006, an Airbus A380 landed at the airport as part of the first leg of its certification trip. Tests on the runways, taxiways, and ramps showed that the airport is fully capable of handling A380.

To further upgrade service, Incheon and major Korean logistics firm Hanjin Group (parent company of Korean Air) agreed on 10 January 2008, to build Yeongjong Medical Centre, which was completed in 2012. This hospital serves nearby residents and some 30,000 medical tourists who come to Korea annually.

==Operations==
The airport opened for business in early 2001 to replace the older Gimpo International Airport, which now serves mostly domestic destinations plus shuttle flights to Beijing–Capital, Osaka–Kansai, Shanghai–Hongqiao, Taipei–Songshan and Tokyo–Haneda although flights to Beijing and Osaka also operate from Incheon Airport. Located west of Seoul, the capital and the largest city of South Korea, Incheon International Airport is the main hub for Korean Air, Asiana Airlines, Jeju Air, and Polar Air Cargo. The airport is a hub for international civilian air transportation and cargo traffic in East Asia. In 2016, the Incheon International Airport was the fifth-busiest airport in the world and third in Asia by cargo traffic, and 19th in the world and eighth in Asia by passenger traffic. In 2016, the airport served a total of 57,849,814 passengers.

==Construction phases==
The airport was originally planned to be built in three phases, incrementally increasing airport capacity as the demand grew. This was changed, however, to four phases after the airport was opened.

===Phase 1===

In Phase 1, the airport had a capacity of 30 million passengers annually, and a cargo capacity of annually. In this phase, a passenger terminal with a floor space of , two parallel runways, a control tower, an administrative building, a transportation centre (the Integrated Transportation Centre, designed by Terry Farrell and Partners and Samoo Architects &amp; Engineers), an integrated operations centre, three cargo terminals, international business centre, and a government office building were constructed.

===Phase 2===
Phase 2 construction began in 2002, and was originally expected to be completed in December 2008. However, in an attempt to have the airport ready for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which took place in August 2008, the schedule was modified, and Phase 2 construction was completed on 20 June 2008. During this construction phase, a third parallel runway and a cargo terminal area was added. A concourse connected to the main passenger building via two parallel underground passageways were added, with a Mitsubishi Crystal Mover shuttle train APM shuttling passengers between the concourse and the main terminal.

Many long-distance foreign carriers were moved to the new concourse, with Korean Air and Asiana Airlines continuing to use the existing terminal.

===Phase 3===
The South Korean government invested ₩4 trillion until 2017 to expand Incheon International Airport. The second passenger terminal was constructed in the northern field of the airport, and its existing cargo terminal and other infrastructures were expanded. The terminals are connected by the underground &quot;Starline&quot; train. Also, a Landside Connecting system (Bus shuttle) is used for airport employees and departing passengers who don&#x27;t come to the right terminal. After completion, Incheon International Airport can handle 62 million passengers and of cargo a year, up from the previous capacity of 44 million passengers and . Construction began in 2011 and was completed in 2017. The terminal opened on 18 January 2018. Incheon&#x27;s expansion also includes adding more aprons to park planes and extending a railway line to the city center of Seoul about away from the airport. The airport also signed an agreement to build a resort called &quot;Inspire&quot; which includes 6-star hotels, theme parks, and a casino.

===Phase 4===
Between 2017 and 2024, a fourth construction phase at the airport was taking place. There was an expansion of Terminal 2, the building of a fourth runway and additional apron and car parking facilities. Following completion of the works, it is expected that the hourly flight capacity of the airport will increase from 90 to 107. The 4th runway opened on 17 June, 2017. The phase 4 construction completed on 3 December, 2024.

There are long-term plans for a fifth runway and a third terminal to handle LCC.

Terminal 1 (measuring ) is the largest airport terminal by area in South Korea. Terminal 1 was designed by Curtis W. Fentress, FAIA, RIBA of Fentress Architects. It is long, wide, and high. Its construction cost was 5.632 trillion South Korean Won. The terminal has 44 boarding ports (all of which can accommodate the Airbus A380), 50 customs inspection ports, 2 biological quarantine counters, 6 stationary and 14 portable passenger quarantine counters, 120 arrival passport inspection counters, 8 arrival security ports, 28 departure security ports, 252 check-in counters, and 120 departure passport inspection counters. In 2015, an automatic check-in counter lane was introduced, which people travelling via Korean Air, Asiana Airlines and China Southern Airlines can use. Instead of having airport staff at the counter, there is a machine where travellers input their flight information, scan their passports, receive their flight tickets and lastly, load the luggage onto the conveyor. This system was planned to be introduced in Terminal 2, but in May 2015 Incheon Airport used one of the counter islands for the unmanned luggage handling system.

In December 2023, a Oneworld-branded and operated lounge opened in Incheon Airport Terminal 1 to serve passengers flying on seven of the alliance&#x27;s 13 member carriers who serve the airport: American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Finnair, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas, Qatar Airways, and SriLankan Airlines. It is the first in a series of planned lounges under development by the alliance.

===Midfield Concourse===
The passenger concourse was completed at the end of May 2008. It is connected to Terminal 1 by two parallel underground passageways equipped with IATs (Intra Airport Transit). It has 30 gates and six lounges.

===Terminal 2 (Incheon T2)===
A new passenger terminal, designed by Gensler, opened on 18 January 2018, and Korean Air, Air France, Delta Air Lines, and KLM flights were relocated from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2. Other SkyTeam members such as Aeroflot, Aeroméxico, China Airlines, Czech Airlines, Garuda Indonesia, and XiamenAir started serving the Terminal 2 on 28 October 2018. From 1 July 2023, Jin Air, the low-cost subsidiary of Korean Air, started operating at Terminal 2. And the rest of the SkyTeam members, such as China Eastern Airlines, Shanghai Airlines, and Vietnam Airlines will be relocated to Terminal 2 after the Phase 4 construction work is completed.

This airport also has a golf course, spa, private sleeping rooms, an ice skating rink, a casino, indoor gardens, a video game center and the Museum of Korean Culture.

==Accidents and incidents==
On 16 June 2011, an Airbus A321-200, operating as Asiana Airlines flight 324 between Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, China and Incheon International Airport, was fired upon by two soldiers of the Republic of Korea Marine Corps as it came in to land at Incheon. A total of 99 rounds were discharged at the aircraft, which was out of range and made a safe landing without sustaining any damage. The soldiers had misidentified the aircraft as belonging to the North Korean military and were acting on orders that permitted them to engage without reference to senior officers, following the Bombardment of Yeonpyeong in November 2010.

==Ground transport==
=== Public transport ===
====Rail====
The Airport Railroad Express (AREX and styled as A&#x27;REX) has two stations located in both the Transport Centre adjacent to the Terminal 1 building (Incheon International Airport Terminal 1 station) and is in the basement of Terminal 2 (Incheon International Airport Terminal 2 station). It provides service to Gimpo International Airport and Seoul. Many of the stations along the line provide connections to Incheon Subway, Seoul Metropolitan Subway, and Incheon Airport Maglev.

For departing passengers, Seoul Station City Airport Terminal offers in-town early check-in service and has related immigration services before arriving at the airport. After CALT closed its in-town check-in operation at Gangnam in 2023, the Seoul Station City Airport Terminal is the only available place in Seoul where in-town check-in service is provided.

The Korea Train eXpress (KTX) operated at the same station as AREX but used a different platform. It operated 20 times per day from the airport; twelve times on the Gyeonbu Line, twice on the Gyeonjeon Line, four times on the Honam Line, and twice on the Jeolla Line. The service started in 2014 but was suspended in March 2018 due to low ridership. The suspension became permanent in September 2018 as the line was officially closed.

The Incheon Airport Maglev opened on 3 February 2016, and closed on 1 September 2023. The first phase was to be 6.1 km long, spread over six stations (but eight stations were built, spanning more than 8 km), taking riders from the airport toward the southwest of the island where a water park is located. Phase 2 was to be 9.7 km long, extending the line to the northwest of the island. Phase 3 would have added 37.4 km, transforming the line into a circle. After converting the tracks from Maglev to orbital tram tracks, service is expected to resume from March 2024.

====Bus====
Airport shuttle buses transport passengers between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2. Buses are free, arrive every 5 to 8 minutes, take approximately 20 minutes of travel time, and stop at the Hyatt Hotel or airport fire station en route, depending on direction. Airport buses are called limousine buses. Standard limousine buses travel to Gimpo Airport &amp; Songjeong station. Intercity buses connect with other towns and cities in Korea. The City Air Logistics &amp; Transportation company runs an airport bus line directly connected to the bus station at COEX, Gangnam.

====Ferry====
A ferry service connects Yeongjong-do to the mainland. However, the dock is located a considerable distance from the airport. An alternative means of transport must be sought upon arriving at the island to be able to get to the airport.

===Car===
The airport provides a short-term parking lot for 4,000 cars and a long-term parking lot for 6,000 cars. Shuttle services connect the long-term parking lot to the passenger terminal and the cargo terminal. Car rental is located near the long-term parking lot. A link to the mainland is provided by the toll Yeongjong Bridge and an expressway. A second expressway on the Incheon Bridge also connects the island to central Incheon.

===Roads===
It is connected to the Incheon Bridge and the 2nd Gyeongin Expressway. Airport limousine buses, which have been operating since the day Incheon International Airport opened, and many visitors in private cars use this road. When the 3rd Yeonyukgyo Bridge opens in 2025, a general road connecting to the Gyeongin Expressway, Incheon Airport will be accessible by two-wheeled vehicles and on foot.
==Traffic and statistics==
In 2017, the airport was the world&#x27;s fourth busiest airport by cargo traffic and third in Asia, and the world&#x27;s 19th busiest airport by passenger traffic and ninth in Asia. In 2019, the airport served a total of 70,857,908 passengers.

=== Top destinations ===

===Annual traffic===
After COVID-19 ended, it recovered dramatically. In about nine months, the number of passengers increased to the level of the previous year.

==Awards==
As of 2024, the airport has been rated by Skytrax as the third-best airport in the world. Skytrax has also rated the airport as the world&#x27;s best international transit airport and one of the world&#x27;s cleanest airports. The airport is one of Skytrax&#x27;s 5-star airports and has also been awarded for the best airport security in 2021.

During the entire run of the best airport worldwide ranking by Airports Council International (ACI) from 2005 to 2011, Incheon International Airport topped the ranking every year. ACI also rated the airport as the best airport in Asia-Pacific for 10 consecutive years from 2006 to 2016 until the ranking series ended in 2017.

Its duty-free shopping mall has been rated the world&#x27;s best for three years in a row in 2013 by Business Traveller.

<text>Marlborough District or the Marlborough Region (, or &quot;Tauihu&quot;), commonly known simply as Marlborough, is one of the 16 regions of New Zealand, located on the northeast of the South Island. It is administered by Marlborough District Council, a unitary authority, performing the functions of both a territorial authority and a regional council. The council is based at Blenheim, the largest town. The unitary region has a population of .

Marlborough is known for its dry climate, the Marlborough Sounds, and Sauvignon blanc wine. It takes its name from the earlier Marlborough Province, which was named after John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, an English general and statesman.

==Geography==
Marlborough&#x27;s geography can be roughly divided into four sections. The south and west sections are mountainous, particularly the southern section, which rises to the peaks of the Kaikōura Ranges. These two mountainous regions are the final northern vestiges of the ranges that make up the Southern Alps, although that name is rarely applied to mountains this far north.

Between those two sections is the long, straight valley of the Wairau River. This broadens to wide plains at its eastern end, in the centre of which stands the town of Blenheim. This region has fertile soil and temperate weather, which has enabled it to become the centre of the New Zealand wine industry.

The fourth geographic zone lies along its north coast. Here, the drowned valleys of the Marlborough Sounds make for a convoluted and attractive coastline. The town of Picton is located at the southern end of one of the larger sounds, Queen Charlotte Sound. The town of Havelock is at the southern end of the Pelorus Sound; this sound feeds into Kenepuru Sound.

===Climate===
In line with most of New Zealand, the Marlborough Region has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;) with warm summers, cool winters, and rainfall distributed across the year.

== Demography ==
Marlborough District covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. The district is home to % of New Zealand&#x27;s population.
Marlborough District had a population of 49,431 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 2,091 people (4.4%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 6,015 people (13.9%) since the 2013 census. There were 24,594 males, 24,681 females and 156 people of other genders in 20,187 dwellings. 2.6% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. The median age was 46.1 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally).

==Government and politics==
Marlborough is administered by a unitary authority, the Marlborough District Council. Between 1859 and 1876 Marlborough had its own provincial government, and was known as the Marlborough Province, which ended when the Abolition of the Provinces Act came into force on 1 November 1876.

The Marlborough District Council consists of a mayor and 14 councillors. The councillors are elected from three wards: seven from the Blenheim ward, three each from the Marlborough Sounds and Wairau-Awatere wards, and one from the Marlborough Māori ward. The mayor is elected at-large. Elections are held every three years in conjunction with nationwide local elections, with the next election in 2025. 

As of October 2022, the mayor and councillors are:

* Mayor: Nadine Taylor
* Councillors – Blenheim ward: Jamie Arbuckle, David Croad (deputy mayor), Deborah Dalliessi, Brian Dawson, Matt Flight, Jonathan Rosene, Thelma Sowman
* Councillors – Marlborough Sounds ward: Barbara Faulls, Raylene Innes, Ben Minehan
* Councillors – Wairau-Awatere ward: Scott Adams, Sally Arbuckle, Gerald Hope
* Councillors – Marlborough Māori Ward: Allanah Burgess

Nationally, Marlborough is part of the Kaikōura electorate, which also includes the Canterbury region north of the Ashley River / Rakahuri. For the Māori roll, Marlborough is part of the Te Tai Tonga electorate, as is the entire South Island. The electorate was first contested in the 1996 general election, the first under the new MMP voting system. From 1938 to 1996, the region was covered by the Marlborough electorate.

Marlborough is considered a safe area for the National Party, with the region held continuously by the party since the 1975 general election. Stuart Smith of the National Party has been the MP for the Kaikōura electorate since the 2014 general election. Tākuta Ferris from Te Pāti Māori has been the MP for the Te Tai Tonga electorate since 2023.

A combined District and High Court at Blenheim serves the region judicially.

==Economy==
The subnational gross domestic product (GDP) of Marlborough was estimated at NZ$3.25 billion in the year to March 2019, 1.1% of New Zealand&#x27;s national GDP. The regional GDP per capita was estimated at $66,277 in the same period. In the year to March 2018, primary industries contributed $650 million (21.3%) to the regional GDP, goods-producing industries contributed $1.55 billion (37.9%), service industries contributed $1.56 billion (51.2%), and taxes and duties contributed $260 million (8.6%).

=== Agriculture ===


Marlborough has of horticultural land as of 2017, the second-largest area in New Zealand behind Canterbury. Wine grapes make up 23,050 hectares of that area, with sweetcorn and peas being the only other crops with more than 100 hectares of planted area.

The ripening period of wine grapes is extended by Marlborough&#x27;s climate, which has a strong contrast between hot sunny days and cool nights. This results in more intense flavour and aroma characters in the wine. The first commercial vineyards were planted around Blenheim in 1973, and Marlborough subsequently grew to become New Zealand&#x27;s largest and most internationally well-known wine-producing region. Due to this growth, particularly in the export market, the Marlborough wine region now produces three quarters of all New Zealand wine. The most important varietal is Sauvignon Blanc, which is recognised as world-class; wine writers Oz Clarke and George Taber have described Marlborough&#x27;s Sauvignon Blanc as the best in the world. Also, important is the production of méthode traditionelle sparkling wine made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, which has attracted investment from large Champagne producers Mumm, Deutz, Moët &amp; Chandon and Veuve Clicquot.

=== State security facilities ===
The New Zealand Defence Force operates RNZAF Base Woodbourne, co-located with Woodbourne Airport west of Blenheim.

The Waihopai communications monitoring facility, run by the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) and part of the ECHELON network, is located in the Waihopai Valley southwest of Renwick.

== Transport ==
Marlborough is served by four state highways: State Highway 1, , State Highway 62, and State Highway 63. State Highway 1 is the main highway in the region, connecting Picton and Blenheim, and connecting the region south to Christchurch via Seddon and Kaikōura. State Highway 6 connects Blenheim and Renwick, and connects the region to Nelson and Tasman via Havelock. State Highway 63 leaves State Highway 6 at Renwick and travels via the Wairau Valley and Saint Arnaud to meet SH 6 again at Kawatiri, providing a direct route to the West Coast and bypassing Nelson. State Highway 62 is a short highway linking SH 1 at Spring Creek with SH 6 north of Renwick, providing a direct route between Picton and Nelson and bypassing Blenheim.

The Main North Line railway serves the region, running roughly parallel to State Highway 1. The first section of the line in Marlborough opened on 18 November 1875 between Blenheim and Picton. The line south of Blenheim opened to Seddon in October 1902, to Ward in April 1911, and to Wharanui in December 1915. The line finally opened across the present-day Marlborough border in October 1942 when the line was extended to Clarence. The entire line through to Christchurch opened on 15 December 1945 when the railheads met at Kaikōura. Today, the line is used by the Coastal Pacific passenger train, which operates one return journey per day during the summer months. The line is also heavily used by freight trains between Christchurch and the Cook Strait rail ferry at Picton.

Woodbourne Airport (trading as Marlborough Airport) is the region&#x27;s main airport. Air New Zealand Link operates flights from Woodbourne to Auckland and Wellington and Sounds Air operates flights from Woodbourne to Wellington and Christchurch Airport. Sounds Air also operates flights from Picton Aerodrome to Wellington.

Port Marlborough at Picton is the region&#x27;s main seaport. Interislander and Bluebridge both operate roll-on-roll-off ferry services between Picton and Wellington.

== Education ==
There are 29 primary and secondary schools in Marlborough. There are 22 state primary schools, one state intermediate school (Bohally Intermediate in Blenheim), three state secondary schools (Marlborough Boys&#x27; College and Marlborough Girls&#x27; College in Blenheim, and Queen Charlotte College in Picton), and one state area school (Rai Valley Area School). There are two state-integrated schools, one Catholic primary school and one Christian composite school, both in Blenheim.

<text>Dame Angela Brigid Lansbury (October 16, 1925 – October 11, 2022) was a British, Irish and American actress. In a career spanning 80 years, she played various roles across film, stage, and television. Although based for much of her life in the United States, her work attracted international attention.
Lansbury was born into an upper-middle-class family in central London, the daughter of Irish actress Moyna Macgill and English politician Edgar Lansbury. To escape the Blitz, she moved to the United States in 1940, studying acting in New York City. Proceeding to Hollywood in 1942, she signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and obtained her first film roles, in &quot;Gaslight&quot; (1944), &quot;National Velvet&quot; (1944), and &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (1945). She appeared in 11 further MGM films, mostly in minor roles, and after her contract ended in 1952, she began to supplement her cinematic work with theatrical appearances. Lansbury was largely seen as a B-list star during this period, but her role in &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1962) received widespread acclaim and is frequently ranked as one of her best performances. Moving into musical theatre, Lansbury gained stardom for playing the leading role in the Broadway musical &quot;Mame&quot; (1966), winning her first Tony Award and becoming a gay icon.
Amid difficulties in her personal life, Lansbury moved from California to Ireland&#x27;s County Cork in 1970. She continued to make theatrical and cinematic appearances throughout that decade, including leading roles in the stage musicals &quot;Gypsy&quot;, &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;, and &quot;The King and I&quot;, as well as in the Disney film &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; (1971). Moving into television in 1984, she achieved worldwide fame as the sleuth Jessica Fletcher in the American whodunit series &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, which ran for twelve seasons until 1996, becoming one of the longest-running and most popular detective drama series in television history. Through Corymore Productions, a company that she co-owned with her husband Peter Shaw, Lansbury assumed ownership of the series and was its executive producer during its final four seasons. She also moved into voice work, contributing to animated films like &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991) and &quot;Anastasia&quot; (1997). In the 21st century, she toured in several theatrical productions and appeared in family films such as &quot;Nanny McPhee&quot; (2005) and &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot; (2018).
Among her numerous accolades were six Tony Awards (including a Lifetime Achievement Award), six Golden Globe Awards, a Laurence Olivier Award, and the Academy Honorary Award, in addition to nominations for three Academy Awards, eighteen Primetime Emmy Awards, and a Grammy Award.

==Early life and career beginnings ==
===Childhood: 1925–1942===
Angela Brigid Lansbury was born to an upper-middle-class family on October 16, 1925. Although her birthplace has often been given as Poplar, east London, she rejected this, stating that while she had ancestral connections to Poplar, she was born in Regent&#x27;s Park, central London. Her mother was Belfast-born Irish Moyna Macgill (born Charlotte Lillian McIldowie), an actress who regularly appeared on stage in London&#x27;s West End and who also appeared in several films. Her father was the wealthy English timber merchant and politician Edgar Lansbury, a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain and former mayor of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. Her paternal grandfather was the Labour Party leader George Lansbury, a man whom she felt &quot;awed&quot; by and considered &quot;a giant in my youth&quot;. Angela had an older half-sister, Isolde, from Macgill&#x27;s previous marriage to Reginald Denham. In January 1930, Macgill gave birth to twin boys, Bruce and Edgar, leading the Lansburys to move from their Poplar flat to a house in Mill Hill, north London; at weekends, they would stay at a farm in Berrick Salome, Oxfordshire.

When Lansbury was nine, her father died from stomach cancer; she retreated into playing characters as a coping mechanism. Facing financial difficulty, her mother entered a relationship with a Scottish colonel, Leckie Forbes, and moved into his house in Hampstead. Lansbury then received an education at South Hampstead High School from 1934 until 1939, where she was a contemporary of Glynis Johns. She nevertheless considered herself largely self-educated, learning from books, theatre and cinema. Lansbury became a self-professed &quot;complete movie maniac&quot;, visiting the cinema regularly. Keen on playing the piano, she briefly studied music at the Ritman School of Dancing, and in 1940 began studying acting at the Webber Douglas School of Singing and Dramatic Art in Kensington, west London, first appearing onstage as a lady-in-waiting in the school&#x27;s production of Maxwell Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Mary of Scotland&quot;.

That year, Lansbury&#x27;s grandfather died, and with the onset of the Blitz, Macgill decided to take Angela, Bruce and Edgar to the United States; Isolde remained in Britain with her new husband, the actor Peter Ustinov. Macgill secured a job supervising 60 British children who were being evacuated to North America aboard the &quot;Duchess of Athol&quot;, arriving with them in Montreal, Canada, in August 1940. She then proceeded by train to New York City, where she was financially sponsored by a Wall Street businessman, Charles T. Smith, moving in with his family at their home at Mahopac, New York. Lansbury gained a scholarship from the American Theatre Wing to study at the Feagin School of Drama and Radio, where she appeared in performances of William Congreve&#x27;s &quot;The Way of the World&quot; and Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;. She graduated in March 1942, by which time the family had moved to an apartment on Morton Street, Greenwich Village.

===Career breakthrough: 1942–1945===
Macgill secured work in a Canadian touring production of &quot;Tonight at 8:30&quot;, and was joined by her daughter. There, Lansbury gained her first theatrical job as a nightclub act at the Samovar Club, Montreal, singing songs by Noël Coward. Although 16 years old, she claimed to be 19 to secure the job. Lansbury returned to New York City in August 1942, but her mother had moved to Hollywood, Los Angeles, to resurrect her cinematic career; Lansbury and her brothers followed. Moving into a bungalow in Laurel Canyon, both Lansbury and her mother obtained Christmas jobs at the Bullocks Wilshire department store in Los Angeles; Macgill was sacked for incompetence, leaving the family to subsist on Lansbury&#x27;s wages of $28 a week. Befriending a group of gay men, Lansbury became privy to the city&#x27;s underground gay scene. With her mother, she attended lectures by the spiritual guru Jiddu Krishnamurti - at one of these, meeting the writer Aldous Huxley.
At a party hosted by her mother, Lansbury met John van Druten, who had recently co-authored a script for &quot;Gaslight&quot; (1944), a mystery-thriller based on Patrick Hamilton&#x27;s 1938 play, &quot;Gas Light&quot;. The film was being directed by George Cukor and starred Ingrid Bergman in the lead role of Paula Alquist, a woman in Victorian London being psychologically tormented by her husband. Druten suggested that Lansbury would be perfect for the role of Nancy Oliver, a cockney maid; she was accepted for the part, although, since she was only 17, a social worker had to accompany her on the set. Obtaining an agent, Earl Kramer, she was signed to a seven-year contract with MGM, earning $500 a week. &quot;Gaslight&quot; received critical acclaim, and Lansbury&#x27;s performance was widely praised, earning her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Her next film appearance was as Edwina Brown in &quot;National Velvet&quot; (1944); the film became a major commercial success and Lansbury developed a lifelong friendship with co-star Elizabeth Taylor. Lansbury next starred in &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (1945), a cinematic adaptation of Wilde&#x27;s 1890 novel of the same name, which was again set in Victorian London. Directed by Albert Lewin, Lansbury was cast as Sybil Vane, a working class music hall singer who falls in love with the protagonist, Dorian Gray (Hurd Hatfield). Although the film was not a financial success, Lansbury&#x27;s performance once more drew praise, earning her a Golden Globe Award, and she was again nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Academy Awards, losing to Anne Revere, her co-star in &quot;National Velvet&quot;.

===Later MGM films: 1945–1951===
On September 27, 1945, Lansbury married Richard Cromwell, an artist and decorator whose acting career had come to a standstill. Their marriage was troubled; Cromwell was gay, and had married Lansbury in the unsuccessful hope that it would turn him heterosexual. Lansbury filed for divorce within a year, it being granted on September 11, 1946, but they remained friends until his death. In December 1946, she was introduced to fellow English expatriate Peter Pullen Shaw at a party held by former co-star Hurd Hatfield in Ojai Valley. Shaw was an aspiring actor, also signed to MGM, and had recently left a relationship with Joan Crawford. He and Lansbury became a couple, living together before she proposed marriage. They wanted a wedding in Britain, but the Church of England refused to marry two divorcees. Instead, they wed at St. Columba&#x27;s Church, a place of worship under the jurisdiction of the Church of Scotland, in Knightsbridge, London, in August 1949, followed by a honeymoon in France. Returning to the US, they settled into Lansbury&#x27;s home in Rustic Canyon, Malibu. In 1951, the couple both became naturalized US citizens, albeit retaining their British citizenship via dual nationality.
Following the success of &quot;Gaslight&quot; and &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;, MGM cast Lansbury in 11 further films until her contract with the company ended in 1952. Keeping her among their B-list stars, MGM used her less than their similar-aged actresses; Lansbury biographers Rob Edelman and Audrey E. Kupferberg believed that the majority of these films were &quot;mediocre&quot;, doing little to further her career. This view was echoed by Cukor, who believed Lansbury had been &quot;consistently miscast&quot; by MGM. She was repeatedly made to portray older women, often villainous, and as a result she became increasingly dissatisfied with working for MGM, commenting that &quot;I kept wanting to play the Jean Arthur roles, and Mr Mayer kept casting me as a series of venal bitches.&quot; The company was suffering from the post-1948 slump in cinema sales, as a result slashing film budgets and cutting their number of staff.

In 1946, Lansbury played her first American character as Em, a honky-tonk saloon singer in the Oscar-winning Wild West musical &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot;; her singing was dubbed by Virginia Reese. She appeared in &quot;The Hoodlum Saint&quot; (1946), &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot; (1947), &quot;If Winter Comes&quot; (1947), &quot;Tenth Avenue Angel&quot; (1948), &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1948), &quot;State of the Union&quot; (1948) and &quot;The Red Danube&quot; (1949). Lansbury was loaned by MGM first to United Artists for &quot;The Private Affairs of Bel Ami&quot; (1947), and then to Paramount for &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (1949). She appeared as a villainous maidservant in &quot;Kind Lady&quot; (1951) and a French adventuress in &quot;Mutiny&quot; (1952). Turning to radio, in 1948, Lansbury appeared in an audio adaptation of Somerset Maugham&#x27;s &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; for &quot;NBC University Theatre&quot; and the following year, she starred in their adaptation of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. Moving into television, she appeared in a 1950 episode of &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot; adapted from A.J. Cronin&#x27;s &quot;The Citadel&quot;.

==Mid-career==
===&quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; and minor roles: 1952–1965===

Unhappy with the roles she was being given by MGM, Lansbury instructed her manager, Harry Friedman of MCA Inc., to terminate her contract in 1952. That same year, she gave birth to her first child, Anthony. Soon after the birth, she joined the East Coast touring productions of two former-Broadway plays: Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse&#x27;s &quot;Remains to be Seen&quot; and Louis Verneuil&#x27;s &quot;Affairs of State&quot;. Biographer Margaret Bonanno later stated that at this point, Lansbury&#x27;s career had &quot;hit an all-time low&quot;. In April 1953, her daughter Deirdre Angela Shaw was born. Shaw had a son by a previous marriage, David, whom he brought to California to live with the family after he gained legal custody of the boy in 1953. Now with three children to care for, Lansbury moved to a larger house in San Vicente Boulevard in Santa Monica. Lansbury did not feel entirely comfortable in the Hollywood social scene, later commenting that as a result of her British roots, &quot;in Hollywood, I always felt like a stranger in a strange land.&quot; In 1959, the family moved to Malibu, settling into a house that had been designed by Aaron Green on the Pacific Coast Highway; there, she and Peter escaped the Hollywood scene, and sent their children to public school.

Returning to cinema as a freelance actress, Lansbury found herself typecast as an older, maternal figure, appearing in this capacity in most of her films from this period. She later stated that &quot;Hollywood made me old before my time&quot;, noting that in her twenties she was receiving fan mail from people who thought her in her forties. She obtained minor roles in such films as &quot;A Life at Stake&quot; (1954), &quot;A Lawless Street&quot; (1955) and &quot;The Purple Mask&quot; (1955), later describing the latter as &quot;the worst movie I ever made.&quot; She played Princess Gwendolyn in the comedy film &quot;The Court Jester&quot; (1956), before taking on the role of a wife who kills her husband in &quot;Please Murder Me&quot; (1956). From there she appeared as Minnie Littlejohn in &quot;The Long Hot Summer&quot; (1958), and as Mabel Claremont in &quot;The Reluctant Debutante&quot; (1958), for which she filmed in Paris. Biographer Martin Gottfried has claimed that it was these latter two cinematic appearances which restored Lansbury&#x27;s status as an &quot;A-picture actress.&quot; Throughout this period, she continued making television appearances, starring in episodes of &quot;The Revlon Mirror Theater&quot;, &quot;Ford Theatre&quot; and &quot;The George Gobel Show&quot;, and became a regular on game show &quot;Pantomime Quiz&quot;.

In April 1957, she debuted on Broadway at the Henry Miller Theatre in &quot;Hotel Paradiso,&quot; a French burlesque directed by Peter Glenville. The play only ran for 15 weeks, although she earned good reviews for her role as Marcel Cat. She later stated that had she not appeared in the play, her &quot;whole career would have fizzled out.&quot; Into the 1960s, she followed this with an appearance in a Broadway performance of &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; at the Lyceum Theatre, directed by Tony Richardson and George Devine. Lansbury played Helen, the boorish, verbally abusive mother of Josephine (played by Joan Plowright, only four years Lansbury&#x27;s junior), remarking that she gained &quot;a great deal of satisfaction&quot; from the role. During the show&#x27;s run, Lansbury developed a friendship with both Plowright and Plowright&#x27;s lover Laurence Olivier; it was from Lansbury&#x27;s rented flat on East 97th Street that Plowright and Olivier eloped to be married.

After a well-reviewed appearance in &quot;Summer of the Seventeenth Doll&quot; (1959) – for which she had filmed in Australia – and a minor role in &quot;A Breath of Scandal&quot; (1960), Lansbury appeared in 1961&#x27;s &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; as the mother of a character played by Elvis Presley, just ten years her junior. Although believing that the film was of poor quality, she commented that she agreed to appear in it because she &quot;was desperate&quot;. Her role as Mavis in &quot;The Dark at the Top of the Stairs&quot; (1960) drew critical acclaim, as did her appearance in &quot;All Fall Down&quot; (1962) as a manipulative, destructive mother. In 1962, she appeared in the Cold War thriller &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; as Eleanor Iselin, cast for the role by John Frankenheimer. Although Lansbury played actor Laurence Harvey&#x27;s mother in the film, she was in fact only three years older than him. She had agreed to appear in the film after reading the original novel, describing it as &quot;one of the most exciting political books I ever read&quot;. Biographers Edelman and Kupferberg considered this role &quot;her enduring cinematic triumph,&quot; while Gottfried stated that it was &quot;the strongest, the most memorable and the best picture she ever made... she gives her finest film performance in it.&quot; Lansbury received her third Best Supporting Actress Academy Award nomination for the film.

She followed this with a performance as Sybil Logan in &quot;In the Cool of the Day&quot; (1963) – a film she denounced as awful – before appearing as wealthy Isabel Boyd in &quot;The World of Henry Orient&quot; (1964) and the widow Phyllis in &quot;Dear Heart&quot; (1964). Her first appearance in a theatrical musical was the short-lived &quot;Anyone Can Whistle&quot;, written by Arthur Laurents and Stephen Sondheim. An experimental work, it opened at the Majestic Theatre on Broadway in April 1964, but was critically panned and closed after nine performances. Lansbury had played the role of crooked mayoress Cora Hoover Hooper, and although she loved Sondheim&#x27;s score she experienced personal differences with Laurents and was glad when the show closed. She appeared in &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965), a cinematic biopic of Jesus, but was cut almost entirely from the final edit. She followed this with appearances as Mama Jean Bello in &quot;Harlow&quot; (1965), as Lady Blystone in &quot;The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders&quot; (1965), and as Gloria in &quot;Mister Buddwing&quot; (1966). Although many of her cinematic roles had been well received, &quot;celluloid superstardom&quot; evaded Lansbury, and she became increasingly dissatisfied with these minor roles, feeling that none allowed her to explore her potential as an actress.

===&quot;Mame&quot; and theatrical stardom: 1966–1969===

In 1966, Lansbury took on the title role of Mame Dennis in the musical &quot;Mame&quot;, Jerry Herman&#x27;s musical adaptation of the 1955 novel &quot;Auntie Mame&quot;. The director&#x27;s first choice for the role had been Rosalind Russell, who played Mame in the 1958 non-musical film adaptation, but she had declined. Lansbury actively sought the role in the hope that it would mark a change in her career. When she was chosen, it came as a surprise to theatre critics, who believed that the part would go to a better-known actress; Lansbury was 41 years old, and it was her first starring role. Mame Dennis was a glamorous character, with over 20 costume changes throughout the play, and Lansbury&#x27;s role involved ten songs and dance routines for which she trained extensively. First appearing in Philadelphia and then Boston, &quot;Mame&quot; opened at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway in May 1966. &quot;Auntie Mame&quot; was already popular among the gay community, and &quot;Mame&quot; gained Lansbury a cult gay following, something that she later attributed to the fact that Mame Dennis was &quot;every gay person&#x27;s idea of glamour... Everything about Mame coincided with every young man&#x27;s idea of beauty and glory and it was lovely.&quot;

Reviews of Lansbury&#x27;s performance were overwhelmingly positive. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stanley Kauffmann wrote: &quot;Miss Lansbury is a singing-dancing actress, not a singer or dancer who also acts... In this marathon role she has wit, poise, warmth and a very taking .&quot; The role resulted in Lansbury receiving her first Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical. Lansbury&#x27;s later biographer Margaret Bonanno claimed that &quot;Mame&quot; made Lansbury a &quot;superstar&quot;, with the actress herself commenting on her success: &quot;Everyone loves you, everyone loves the success, and enjoys it as much as you do. And it lasts as long as you are on that stage and as long as you keep coming out of that stage door.&quot;

Off the stage, Lansbury made further television appearances, such as on Perry Como&#x27;s Thanksgiving Special in November 1966. She also engaged in high-profile charitable endeavours, for instance appearing as the guest of honour at the 1967 March of Dimes annual benefit luncheon. She was invited to star in a musical performance for the 1968 Academy Awards ceremony, and co-hosted that year&#x27;s Tony Awards with former brother-in-law Peter Ustinov. That year, Harvard University&#x27;s Hasty Pudding Club elected her &quot;Woman of the Year&quot;. When the film adaptation of &quot;Mame&quot; was put into production, Lansbury hoped to be offered the part, but it instead went to Lucille Ball, an established box-office success. Lansbury considered this to be &quot;one of my bitterest disappointments&quot;. Her personal life was further complicated when she learned that both of her children had become involved with the counterculture of the 1960s and had been using recreational drugs. As a result, Anthony had become addicted to cocaine and heroin.

Lansbury followed the success of &quot;Mame&quot; with a performance as Countess Aurelia, the 75-year-old Parisian eccentric in &quot;Dear World&quot;, a musical adaptation of Jean Giraudoux&#x27;s &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot;. The show opened at Broadway&#x27;s Mark Hellinger Theatre in February 1969, but Lansbury found it a &quot;pretty depressing&quot; experience. Reviews of her performance were positive, and she was awarded her second Tony Award on the basis of it. Reviews of the show more generally were critical, however, and it ended after 132 performances. She followed this with an appearance in the title role of the musical &quot;Prettybelle&quot;, based upon Jean Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Prettybelle: A Lively Tale of Rape and Resurrection&quot;. Set in the Deep South, it dealt with issues of racism, with Lansbury playing a wealthy alcoholic who seeks sexual encounters with black men. The play opened in Boston, but received poor reviews and was cancelled before it reached Broadway. Lansbury later described the play as &quot;a complete and utter fiasco&quot;, admitting that in her opinion, her &quot;performance was awful&quot;.

===Ireland and &quot;Gypsy&quot;: 1970–1978===
In the early 1970s, Lansbury declined several cinematic roles, including the lead in &quot;The Killing of Sister George&quot; and the role of Nurse Ratched in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, because she was not satisfied with them. Instead, she accepted the role of the Countess von Ornstein, an ageing German aristocrat who falls in love with a younger man, in &quot;Something for Everyone&quot; (1970), for which she filmed on location in Hohenschwangau, Bavaria. That same year, she appeared as the middle-aged English witch Eglantine Price in the Disney film &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot;; this was her first lead in a screen musical, and led to her publicizing the film on television programmes like the &quot;David Frost Show&quot;. She later noted that as a big commercial success, this film &quot;secured an enormous audience for me&quot;.

The year 1970 was a traumatic one for the Lansbury family, as Peter underwent a hip replacement, Anthony suffered a heroin overdose and entered a coma, and the family&#x27;s Malibu home was destroyed in a brush fire. They then purchased Knockmourne Glebe, a farmhouse built in the 1820s which was located near Conna in rural County Cork, and, after Anthony quit using cocaine and heroin, took him there to recover from his drug addiction. He subsequently enrolled in the Webber-Douglas School, his mother&#x27;s alma mater, and became a professional actor, before moving into television directing. Lansbury and her husband did not return to California, instead dividing their time between Cork and New York City, where they lived in a flat opposite the Lincoln Center.

In 1972, Lansbury returned to London&#x27;s West End to perform in the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s theatrical production of Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;All Over&quot; at the Aldwych Theatre. She portrayed the mistress of a dying New England millionaire, and although the play&#x27;s reviews were mixed, Lansbury&#x27;s acting was widely praised. This was followed by her reluctant involvement in a revival of &quot;Mame&quot;, which was then touring the United States, after which she returned to the West End to play the character of Rose in the musical &quot;Gypsy&quot;. She had initially turned down the role, not wishing to be in the shadow of Ethel Merman, who had portrayed the character in the original Broadway production. When the show started in May 1973, Lansbury earned a standing ovation and rave reviews. Settling into a Belgravia flat, she was soon in demand among London society, having dinners held in her honour. Following the culmination of the London run, in 1974 &quot;Gypsy&quot; toured the US; in Chicago, Lansbury was awarded the Sarah Siddons Award for her performance. The show eventually reached Broadway, where it ran until January 1975. A critical success, it earned Lansbury her third Tony Award. After several months&#x27; break, &quot;Gypsy&quot; toured the US again in the summer of 1975.

Wanting to move on from musicals, Lansbury obtained the role of Gertrude in the National Theatre Company&#x27;s production of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, staged at the Old Vic. Directed by Peter Hall, the production ran from December 1975 to May 1976 and received mixed reviews. Lansbury disliked the role, later commenting that she found it &quot;very trying playing restrained roles&quot; such as Gertrude. Her mood was worsened by her mother&#x27;s death in November 1975. Her next theatrical appearance was in two one-act plays by Albee, &quot;Counting the Ways&quot; and &quot;Listening&quot;, performed side by side at the Hartford Stage Company in Connecticut. Reviews of the production were mixed, although Lansbury was again singled out for praise. This was followed by another revival tour of &quot;Gypsy&quot;.

In April 1978, Lansbury appeared in 24 performances of a revival of &quot;The King and I&quot; musical staged at Broadway&#x27;s Uris Theatre; Lansbury played the role of Mrs Anna, replacing Constance Towers, who was on a short break. Her first cinematic role in seven years was as novelist Salome Otterbourne in a 1978 adaptation of Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Death on the Nile&quot;, filmed in both London and Egypt. In the film, Lansbury starred alongside Ustinov and Bette Davis, who became a close friend. The role earned Lansbury the National Board of Review award for Best Supporting Actress of 1978.

===&quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; and continued cinematic work: 1979–1984===
In March 1979, Lansbury appeared as Nellie Lovett in &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot;, a Sondheim musical directed by Harold Prince. Opening at the Uris Theatre, she starred alongside Len Cariou as Sweeney Todd, the murderous barber in 19th-century London. After being offered the role, she jumped on the opportunity due to Sondheim&#x27;s involvement, commenting that she loved &quot;the extraordinary wit and intelligence of his lyrics.&quot; She remained in the role for 14 months before being replaced by Dorothy Loudon; the musical received mixed critical reviews, although earned Lansbury her fourth Tony Award and &quot;After Dark&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ruby Award for Broadway Performer of the Year. She returned to the role in October 1980 for a ten-month US tour; the production was also filmed and broadcast on the Entertainment Channel.

In 1982, Lansbury took on the role of an upper middle-class housewife who champions workers&#x27; rights in &quot;A Little Family Business&quot;, a farce set in Baltimore in which her son Anthony also starred. It debuted at Los Angeles&#x27; Ahmanson Theatre before moving to Broadway&#x27;s Martin Beck Theatre. It was critically panned and faced protests from California&#x27;s Japanese-American community for including anti-Japanese slurs. That year, Lansbury was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame, and the following year appeared in a &quot;Mame&quot; revival at Broadway&#x27;s Gershwin Theatre. Although Lansbury was praised, the revival was a commercial failure, with Lansbury noting: &quot;I realised that it&#x27;s not a show of today. It&#x27;s a period piece.&quot;

Working in cinema, in 1979 Lansbury appeared as Miss Froy in &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot;, a remake of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1938 film. The following year she appeared in &quot;The Mirror Crack&#x27;d&quot;, another film based on an Agatha Christie novel, this time as Miss Marple, a sleuth in 1950s Kent. Lansbury hoped to get away from the depiction of the role made famous by Margaret Rutherford, instead returning to Christie&#x27;s description of the character. She was signed to appear in two sequels as Miss Marple, but these were never made. Lansbury&#x27;s next film was the animated &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; (1982), for which she provided the voice of the witch Mommy Fortuna.

Returning to musical cinema, she starred as Ruth in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; (1983), a film based on Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s comic opera of the same name, and while filming it in London sang on a recording of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;. This was followed by an appearance as the grandmother in Gothic fantasy film &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot; (1984). Lansbury had also begun work for television, appearing in a 1982 television film with Bette Davis titled &quot;Little Gloria... Happy at Last&quot;. She followed this with an appearance in CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Gift of Love: A Christmas Story&quot; (1983), later describing it as &quot;the most unsophisticated thing you can imagine.&quot; A BBC television film followed, &quot;A Talent for Murder&quot; (1984), in which she played a wheelchair user mystery writer; although describing it as &quot;a rush job&quot;, she agreed to do it in order to work with co-star Laurence Olivier. Two further miniseries featuring Lansbury appeared in 1984: &quot;Lace&quot; and &quot;The First Olympics: Athens 1896&quot;.

==Global fame==
===&quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;: 1984–2003===

In 1983, Lansbury was offered two main television roles, one in a sitcom and the other in a detective drama series, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;. As she was unable to do both, her agents advised her to accept the former, but Lansbury chose the latter. Her decision was based on the appeal of the series&#x27; central character, Jessica Fletcher, a retired school teacher from the fictional town of Cabot Cove, Maine. As portrayed by Lansbury, Fletcher was a successful detective novelist who also solved murders encountered during her travels. Lansbury described the character as &quot;an American Miss Marple&quot;.

&quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; had been created by Peter S. Fischer, Richard Levinson, and William Link, who had earlier had success with &quot;Columbo&quot;, and the role of Fletcher had been first offered to Jean Stapleton, who had declined it. The pilot episode, &quot;The Murder of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, premiered on CBS on September 30, 1984, with the rest of the first season airing on Sundays from 8 to 9 pm. Although critical reviews were mixed, it proved highly popular, with the pilot having a Nielsen rating of 18.9 and the first season being rated top in its time slot. Designed as inoffensive family viewing, as despite its topic the show eschewed depicting violence or gore, it followed the &quot;whodunit&quot; format rather than those of most US crime shows of the time. Lansbury herself commented that &quot;best of all, there&#x27;s no violence. I hate violence.&quot;

Lansbury exerted creative input over Fletcher&#x27;s costumes, makeup and hair, and rejected pressure from network executives to put the character in a relationship, believing that the character should remain a strong single woman. When she believed that a scriptwriter had made Fletcher do or say things that did not fit with the character&#x27;s personality, Lansbury ensured that the script was changed. She saw Fletcher as a role model for older female viewers, praising her &quot;enormous, universal appeal – that was an accomplishment I never expected in my entire life.&quot; Edelman and Kupferberg described the series as &quot;a television landmark&quot; in the US for having an older female character as the protagonist, paving the way for later series like &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;. Lansbury commented that &quot;I think it&#x27;s the first time a show has really been aimed at the middle aged audience&quot;, and although it was most popular among senior citizens, it gradually gained a younger audience; by 1991, a third of viewers were under fifty. It gained continually high ratings throughout most of its run, outdoing rivals in its time slot such as Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; on NBC. In 1987, a spin-off was produced, &quot;The Law &amp; Harry McGraw&quot;, although it proved short-lived.

As &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; went on, Lansbury assumed a larger role behind the scenes. In 1989, her own company, Corymore Productions, began co-producing the show with Universal. Lansbury began to tire of the series, and in particular the long working hours, stating that the 1990–1991 season would be its last. She changed her mind after being appointed executive producer for the 1992–1993 season, something that she felt &quot;made it far more interesting to me.&quot; For the seventh season, the show&#x27;s primary setting moved to New York City, where Fletcher had taken a job teaching criminology at Manhattan University; the move, encouraged by Lansbury, was an attempt to attract younger viewers. Having become a &quot;Sunday-night institution&quot; in the US, the show&#x27;s ratings improved during the early 1990s, becoming a Top Five programme.

For the show&#x27;s 12th season, CBS executives moved &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; to Thursdays at 8 pm, opposite NBC&#x27;s new sitcom, &quot;Friends&quot;. Lansbury was upset by the move, believing that it ignored the show&#x27;s core audience. This would prove to be the series&#x27; final season. The final episode aired on May 19, 1996, and ended with Lansbury voicing a &quot;Goodbye from Jessica&quot; message. In &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Tom Shales suggested that the series had become &quot;partly a victim of commercial television&#x27;s mad youth mania&quot;. There were &quot;vocal protests&quot; at its cancellation from the show&#x27;s fanbase. At the time, it tied the original &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; as the longest-running detective drama series in history.

Lansbury initially had plans for a &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; television film that would be a musical with a score composed by Jerry Herman; that project did not materialize but resulted in the 1996 television film &quot;Mrs. Santa Claus&quot;, with Lansbury playing the eponymous character, which proved to be a ratings success. &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; continued through several made-for-television films: &quot;South By Southwest&quot; in 1997, &quot;A Story To Die For&quot; in 2000, &quot;The Last Free Man&quot; in 2001, and &quot;The Celtic Riddle&quot; in 2003. The role of Fletcher would prove the most successful and prominent of Lansbury&#x27;s career, and she would later speak critically of attempts to reboot the series with a different actress in the lead.

Throughout the run of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, Lansbury had continued appearing in other television films, miniseries and cinema. In 1986, she co-hosted the New York Philharmonic&#x27;s televised tribute to the centenary of the Statue of Liberty with Kirk Douglas. That same year, she appeared as the protagonist&#x27;s mother in &quot;Rage of Angels: The Story Continues&quot;, and in 1988 portrayed Nan Moore – the mother of a victim of the real-life Korean Air Lines Flight 007 plane crash – in &quot;Shootdown&quot;. 1989 saw her featured in &quot;The Shell Seekers&quot; as an Englishwoman recuperating from a heart attack, and in 1990 she starred in &quot;The Love She Sought&quot; as an American school teacher who falls in love with a Catholic priest while visiting Ireland; Lansbury thought it &quot;a marvelous woman&#x27;s story.&quot; She next starred as the eponymous cockney in a television film adaptation of the novel &quot;Mrs &#x27;Arris Goes to Paris&quot;, directed by her son and executive produced by her stepson. Lansbury&#x27;s highest profile cinematic role since &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; was as the voice of the singing teapot Mrs. Potts in the 1991 Disney animation &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, as part of which she performed the film&#x27;s title song. She considered the appearance to be a gift for her three grandchildren. Lansbury again lent her voice to an animated character, this time that of the Empress Dowager, for the 1997 film &quot;Anastasia&quot;.

Lansbury&#x27;s &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; fame resulted in her being employed to appear in advertisements and infomercials for Bufferin, MasterCard and the Beatrix Potter Company. In 1988, she released a VHS video titled &quot;Angela Lansbury&#x27;s Positive Moves: My Personal Plan for Fitness and Well-Being&quot;, in which she outlined her personal exercise routine, and in 1990 published a book with the same title co-written with Mimi Avins, which she dedicated to her mother. As a result of her work, she was awarded a CBE by the British government, given to her in a ceremony by Charles, Prince of Wales, at the British consulate in Los Angeles. While living for most of the year in California, Lansbury spent the Christmas period and the summer at Corymore House, a farmhouse overlooking the Atlantic Ocean near to Ballywilliam, County Cork, which she had had built as a family home in 1991.

===Final years: 2003–2022===

In the years following &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, Lansbury was increasingly preoccupied by her husband&#x27;s deteriorating health; it was for this reason that she dropped out of being the lead role in the 2001 Kander and Ebb musical &quot;The Visit&quot; before it opened. Peter died in January 2003 of congestive heart failure at the couple&#x27;s Brentwood home. Lansbury felt that after this she would not take on any more major acting roles, perhaps only making cameo appearances. Wanting to spend more time in New York City, in 2006 she purchased a $2 million condominium in Manhattan.

Lansbury appeared in a season six episode of the television show &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, for which she was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2005. She also starred in the 2005 film &quot;Nanny McPhee&quot; as Aunt Adelaide, later informing an interviewer that working on it &quot;pulled me out of the abyss&quot; after her husband&#x27;s death. Lansbury returned to Broadway after a 23-year absence in &quot;Deuce&quot;, a play by Terrence McNally that opened at the Music Box Theatre in May 2007 for an 18-week limited run. Lansbury received a Tony Award nomination for Best Leading Actress in a Play for her role. In March 2009, she returned to Broadway for a revival of &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; at the Shubert Theatre, where she took on the role of Madame Arcati. This appearance earned her the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play; this was her fifth Tony Award, tying her with the previous record holder for the number of Tony Awards, Julie Harris. From December 2009 to June 2010, Lansbury then starred as Madame Armfeldt in a Broadway revival of &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; at the Walter Kerr Theatre. The role earned her a seventh Tony Award nomination. In May 2010, she was awarded an honorary doctoral degree from Manhattan School of Music. She then appeared in the 2011 film &quot;Mr. Popper&#x27;s Penguins&quot;, opposite Jim Carrey.

From March to July 2012, Lansbury appeared as women&#x27;s rights advocate Sue-Ellen Gamadge in the Broadway revival of Gore Vidal&#x27;s &quot;The Best Man&quot; at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre. From February 2013, she starred alongside James Earl Jones in an Australian tour of &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot;, an appearance that resulted in her pulling out from a scheduled role in Wes Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot;. In November 2013, she received an Academy Honorary Award for her lifetime achievement at the Governors Awards. In 2014, Lansbury was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II. From March 2014, Lansbury reprised her performance as Madame Arcati in &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; at the Gielgud Theatre in London&#x27;s West End, her first London stage appearance in nearly 40 years. While in London, she made an appearance at the Angela Lansbury Film Festival, a screening of some of her films in Poplar. From December 2014 to March 2015 she joined the tour of &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; across North America. In April 2015 she received her first Olivier Award as Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Arcati, and in November 2015 was awarded the Oscar Hammerstein Award for Lifetime Achievement in Musical Theatre.

Lansbury agreed to star as Mrs St Maugham in a Broadway run of Enid Bagnold&#x27;s 1955 play &quot;The Chalk Garden&quot;, although later acknowledged that she no longer had the stamina for eight performances a week. Instead, she appeared in a one-night staged reading of the play at Hunter College in 2017. Her next role was as Aunt March in the BBC miniseries &quot;Little Women&quot;, screened in December 2017. In 
2018, she appeared in the family film &quot;&quot;, as well as in the film &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot;; her cameo role as the Balloon Lady involved singing the song &quot;Nowhere To Go But Up&quot;. That year also saw the release of animated film &quot;The Grinch&quot;, for which Lansbury voiced the Mayor of Whoville. In November 2019, she returned to Broadway, portraying Lady Bracknell in a one-night benefit staging of Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; for Roundabout Theatre Company&#x27;s American Airlines Theatre. Lansbury made her final film appearance, a cameo role as herself, in the 2022 film &quot;Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery&quot;. Lansbury died in her sleep at her home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles on October 11, 2022, at the age of 96.

==Personal life==
Lansbury defined herself as being &quot;Irish-British&quot;. She became a US citizen in 1951, while retaining her British citizenship. According to a 2014 article in the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, she also held Irish citizenship. 
Although adopting an Americanized accent for roles like that of Fletcher, Lansbury retained her English accent throughout her life.

Lansbury was a profoundly private person, and disliked attempts at flattery. Gottfried characterized her as being &quot;Meticulous. Cautious. Self-editing. Deliberate. It is what the British call reserved&quot;. In &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, the theatre critic Dominic Cavendish stated that Lansbury&#x27;s hallmarks were &quot;self-composure, commitment and, yes, gentility&quot;, approaches he thought had become &quot;in too short supply&quot; in modern times. Gottfried also commented that she was &quot;as concerned, as sensitive, and as sympathetic as anyone might want in a friend&quot;.

Lansbury was married twice. Her first marriage was to actor Richard Cromwell and lasted from 1945 to 1946. In 1949, Lansbury married actor and producer Peter Shaw, and they remained married until he died in 2003. They had two children together, Anthony Peter (b. 1952) and Deirdre Ann (b. 1953), and Lansbury became the stepmother of Shaw&#x27;s son David from his first marriage. While Lansbury repeatedly stated that she wanted to put her children before her career, she admitted that she frequently had to leave them in California for long periods when she was working elsewhere.

Anthony became a television director and directed 68 episodes of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;. Deirdre married a chef, and together they opened a restaurant in West Los Angeles. Lansbury had three grandchildren and five great-grandchildren at the time of her death in 2022.
Lansbury was a cousin of the Postgate family, including the animator and activist Oliver Postgate. She was also a cousin of the actor Kate (Geraghty) Lansbury, and of the novelist Coral Lansbury, whose son Malcolm Turnbull was Prime Minister of Australia from 2015 to 2018.

As a young actress, Lansbury was a self-professed , who commented that she loved housekeeping. She preferred to spend quiet evenings with her friends inside her house because she did not like to engage in Hollywood nightlife. Her hobbies at the time included reading, riding, playing tennis, cooking, and playing the piano; she also had a keen interest in gardening. She cited F. Scott Fitzgerald as her favourite author, and &quot;Roseanne&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld&quot; among her favourite television shows. Lansbury was an avid letter writer who wrote letters by hand and made copies of all of them. At Howard Gotlieb&#x27;s request, Lansbury&#x27;s papers are housed at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University.

Lansbury brought up her children as Episcopalians, but they were not members of a congregation. She stated, &quot;I believe that God is within all of us, that we are perfect, precious beings, and that we have to put our faith and trust in that.&quot; She supported Britain&#x27;s Labour Party, to which she had family ties, and the US Democratic Party; she described herself as a &quot;Democrat from the ground up&quot; to quash online rumours that she endorsed the Republican Party. She also supported various charities, particularly those combating domestic abuse and rehabilitating drug users. In the 1980s, she also supported charities combating HIV/AIDS.

Lansbury was a chain smoker in early life, but quit smoking in the mid-1960s. In 1976 and 1987, she underwent cosmetic surgery on her neck to prevent it from broadening with age. During the 1990s, she began to suffer from arthritis. Lansbury underwent hip replacement surgery in May 1994, followed by knee replacement surgery in 2005.

==Honours and legacy==

In the 1960s, &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to Lansbury as the &quot;First Lady of Musical Theatre&quot;. She described herself as an actress who also could sing, although in her early film appearances her singing was repeatedly dubbed; Sondheim stated that she had a strong voice, albeit with a limited range. In &quot;The Oxford Companion to the American Musical&quot;, Thomas Hischak related that Lansbury was &quot;more a character actress than a leading lady&quot; for much of her career, one who brought &quot;a sparkling stage presence to her work&quot;. Gottfried described her as &quot;an American icon&quot;, while the BBC characterized her as &quot;one of Britain&#x27;s favourite exports,&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot; suggested that she could be considered Britain&#x27;s most successful actress. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, journalist Mark Lawson described her as a member of the &quot;acting aristocracy in three countries&quot; – Britain, Ireland, and the United States.

Gottfried noted that Lansbury&#x27;s public image was &quot;practically saintly&quot;. A 2007 interviewer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; described her as &quot;one of the few actors it makes sense to call beloved&quot;, noting that a 1994 article in &quot;People&quot; magazine awarded her a perfect score on its &quot;lovability index&quot;. The &quot;New Statesman&quot; commented that she &quot;has the kind of pulling power many younger and more ubiquitous actors can only dream of.&quot; Lansbury was a gay icon. She described herself as being &quot;very proud of the fact&quot;, attributing her popularity among gay people to her performance in &quot;Mame&quot;; an article in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; suggested that &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; had further broadened her appeal with that demographic.

Following the announcement of Lansbury&#x27;s death, many figures in the entertainment industry praised her on social media. The actor Jason Alexander called her &quot;one of the most versatile, talented, graceful, kind, witty, wise, classy ladies&quot; he had ever met. Actor Uzo Aduba called her an &quot;icon of the stage&quot;, while actor Josh Gad noted that it was rare that &quot;one person can touch multiple generations, creating a breadth of work that defines decade after decade. Angela Lansbury was that artist&quot;. Screenwriter and actor Mark Gatiss praised Lansbury as &quot;the very definition of a pro,&quot; while Douglas C. Baker, the producing director for Center Theatre Group, stated that &quot;Angela was a titan of show business, but at the same time she was one of the most kind and approachable people you would ever meet [...] Impeccably professional, genuine and deeply hilarious.&quot; Former Walt Disney Studios CEO Robert Iger described her &quot;a consummate professional, a talented actress, and a lovely person.&quot; Others who posted in remembrance of Lansbury included Kristin Chenoweth, Viola Davis, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Harvey Fierstein, Kathy Griffin, Jeremy O. Harris, Brent Spiner, George Takei, and Rachel Zegler. On October 12 theatres across the West End of London, dimmed their lights for two minutes to mark Lansbury&#x27;s passing.

Lansbury was recognised for her achievements in Britain on multiple occasions. In 2002, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) gave her a Lifetime Achievement Award. She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1994 Birthday Honours, and subsequently was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2014 New Year Honours for services to drama, charitable work, and philanthropy. On being made a dame by Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle, Lansbury stated: &quot;I&#x27;m joining a marvellous group of women I greatly admire like Judi Dench and Maggie Smith. It&#x27;s a lovely thing to be given that nod of approval by your own country and I cherish it.&quot;

Lansbury won six Golden Globe Awards and a People&#x27;s Choice Awards for her television and film work. She never won an Emmy Award despite 18 nominations. As of 2009, she held the record for the most unsuccessful Emmy nominations by a performer. She was nominated three times for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, but never won. Reflecting on this in 2007, she stated that she was at first &quot;terribly disappointed, but subsequently very glad that [she] did not win&quot; because she believed that she would have otherwise had a less successful career.

In 2013, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Board of Governors voted to bestow upon Lansbury an Honorary Academy Award for her lifetime achievements in the industry. The actors Emma Thompson and Geoffrey Rush offered tributes at the Governors Awards where the ceremony was held, and Robert Osborne of Turner Classic Movies presented her with the Oscar, stating that &quot;Angela has been adding class, talent, beauty, and intelligence to the movies&quot; since 1944. The Oscar statue is inscribed: &quot;To Angela Lansbury, an icon who has created some of cinema&#x27;s most memorable characters inspiring generations of actors&quot;.
