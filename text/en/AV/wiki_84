<doc id="165073" wikidata="Q1689719" url="?curid=165073" title="Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers">
<text>Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers are a British novelty pop music act from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England. The face of the group was Jive Bunny, a cartoon rabbit who appeared in their music videos. Costumed actors also made promotional appearances as the character.

Doncaster DJ and producer Les Hemstock created the original &quot;Swing the Mood&quot; mix for the Music Factory owned Mastermix DJ service. It was then taken from there and developed as a single release by father and son team John and Andrew Pickles. The name Jive Bunny was devised by Andy Pickles. Ian Morgan, a fellow DJ and co-producer, also engineered and mixed some of the early releases along with Andy Pickles. Morgan was replaced in the early 1990s by DJ and producer Mark &quot;The Hitman&quot; Smith.

Jive Bunny&#x27;s three number ones during 1989 were &quot;Swing the Mood&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s What I Like&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Party&quot;. All three songs used sampling and synthesisers to combine pop music from the early rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll era together into a medley.

==Musical career==
The act had 11 entries in the UK singles chart between July 1989 and November 1991. Each track used a sampled instrumental theme to join the old songs together, in much the same way as dance music megamixes. &quot;Swing the Mood&quot; began with Glenn Miller&#x27;s &quot;In the Mood&quot; (a recording from 1939), followed immediately by rhythmic re-editing of Bill Haley and His Comets&#x27; &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, Little Richard&#x27;s &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; and the Everly Brothers&#x27; &quot;Wake Up, Little Susie&quot;. The recording also had a short extract from &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot; (1954) with James Stewart as Glenn Miller. &quot;Swing the Mood&quot; was No. 1 for five weeks on the UK Singles Chart in 1989, and quickly caught on in the United States, where it reached No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

&quot;That&#x27;s What I Like&quot; featured the theme music from the television police drama &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, with overlaid excerpts from rock hits like Chubby Checker&#x27;s &quot;The Twist&quot; and Ernie Maresca&#x27;s &quot;Shout! Shout! (Knock Yourself Out)&quot;. &quot;Let&#x27;s Party&quot; (released originally in the U.S. as &quot;March of the Mods&quot;) used &quot;March of the Mods&quot; (also known as the Finnjenka Dance), interpolating Del Shannon&#x27;s &quot;Runaway&quot; and The Wrens&#x27; &quot;Come Back My Love&quot; among others. 

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Let&#x27;s Party&quot; was a Christmas hit with samples of Wizzard&#x27;s &quot;I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday&quot;, Slade&#x27;s &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot; and Gary Glitter&#x27;s &quot;Another Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Christmas&quot;. Recently this has been remixed to remove the Gary Glitter track to avoid controversy over his subsequent criminal convictions and, somewhat anachronistically, replace it with Mariah Carey&#x27;s &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot;, should any radio stations wish to play it over the Christmas period. They did not have permission to use the original Wizzard recording so Roy Wood re-recorded the part of the track for them.

With &quot;Let&#x27;s Party&quot; reaching Number One in the UK Singles Chart a couple of weeks before the Christmas chart of 1989, the act became the third group after Gerry and the Pacemakers and Frankie Goes to Hollywood to &#x27;top the chart&#x27; with their first three releases. However, Jive Bunny was also credited on a Children In Need charity single (&quot;It Takes Two, Baby&quot;, also featuring Liz Kershaw, Bruno Brookes and Londonbeat), which preceded &quot;Let&#x27;s Party&quot; and did not top the charts. As of 2020, the Official Charts Company website does not include &quot;It Takes Two, Baby&quot; in its list of Jive Bunny releases, while many British Hit Singles books of the early 2000s added the record to their discography.

The original European medleys featured the original recordings by the original artists. Legalities prevented certain of the original recordings to be reused in America, so the American Jive Bunny releases substituted later re-recordings of the same tunes by Bill Haley, Del Shannon and others. Later reissues further replaced some of these artists, such as Bill Haley and Elvis, with impersonator-singers.

The original idea for the project came from Les Hemstock on the DJ-only Mastermix DJ service. The original &quot;Swing the Mood&quot; mix appeared on Issue 22 of Mastermix&#x27;s monthly album release. John Pickles (father of Andy Pickles) was never in the band, but was the owner of the label and effectively the manager.

<doc id="165078" wikidata="Q11167066" url="?curid=165078" title="Order of battle">
<text>In modern use, the order of battle of an armed force participating in a military operation or campaign shows the hierarchical organization, command structure, strength, disposition of personnel, and equipment of units and formations of the armed force. Various abbreviations are in use, including OOB, O/B, or OB, while ORBAT remains the most common in the United Kingdom. An order of battle is distinct from a table of organisation, which is the intended composition of a given unit or formation according to the military doctrine of its armed force. Historically, an order of battle was the order in which troops were positioned relative to the position of the army commander or the chronological order in which ships were deployed in naval situations.

As combat operations develop during a campaign, orders of battle may be revised and altered in response to the military needs and challenges. Also the known details of an order of battle may change during the course of executing the commanders&#x27; after action reports and/or other accounting methods (e.g. despatches) as combat assessment is conducted.

==Historical approaches==

In its original form during the Medieval period of European warfare, an order of battle was the order in which troops were positioned relative to the position of the army commander. The term was also applied to the disposition of ships in the line of battle during the age of sail. In the later transformation of its meaning during the European period of Early Modern warfare the order of battle came to mean the order in which the units manoeuvered or deployed onto the battlefield to form battle-lines, with the positioning on the right considered the place of greatest honour. This need to reflect the unit seniority led to the keeping of military staff records, in tabular form reflecting the compilation of units an army, their commanders, equipment, and locations on the battlefield.

During the Napoleonic wars the meaning of the order of battle changed yet again to reflect the changes in the composition of opposing forces during the battle owing to use of larger formations than in the previous century. Napoleon also instituted the staff procedure of maintaining accurate information about the composition of the enemy order of battle, and tables of organisation, and this later evolved into an important function and an organisational tool used by military intelligence to analyse enemy capability for combat.

===British historical approach===
British military history is the source of some of the earliest orders of battle in the English language, and due to the British Empire&#x27;s involvement in global conflicts over several centuries the records of historical orders of battle provide a valuable source of study for understanding not only of the composition, but also of tactics and doctrines of the forces through their depiction in the orders of battle. The British Army and UK forces use the acronym ORBAT to describe the structure of both friendly and enemy forces.

Operation Quicksilver, part of the British deception plan for the Invasion of Normandy in World War II, fed German intelligence a combination of true and false information about troop deployments in Britain, causing the Germans to deduce an order of battle which suggested an invasion at the Pas-de-Calais instead of Normandy.

Clausewitz defined the &#x27;order of battle&#x27; as &quot;that division and formation of the different arms into separate parts, or sections, of the whole Army, and that form of general position or disposition of those parts which is to be the norm throughout the whole campaign or war.&quot;

*Division comes from the permanent peacetime organization of the Army, with certain parts such as battalions, squadrons, and batteries being formed into units of higher order up to the highest of all, the whole Army.
*Disposition comes from the tactics and how these troops are to be drawn up for the battle.

Normally these tactics are exercised in peace and cannot be essentially modified when war breaks out. Order of battle belongs more to tactics than strategy. Clausewitz also noted that the order of battle depends on the effective span of control by a commander. Too few subunits makes an army unwieldy; too many subunits makes the &#x27;power of the superior will&#x27; weak; and in addition every step by which an order has to pass weakens its effect by loss of force and longer time of transmission. Clausewitz recommended that armies have no more than eight to ten subunits and subordinate corps four to six subunits.

===United States Army===

In United States Army standing operating procedures, an order of battle to be used for operations planning should relate what an Army unit might be expected to encounter while deployed in the field. The templating of the OoB during maneuvers is typically the responsibility of a battalion or brigade commander, conducted through their Headquarters S-2 (intelligence) sections. Observations about enemy troop movements may be gathered by various military intelligence resources from all echelons, including the employment of any attached special forces units (such as Rangers or LRS teams) as well as Cavalry RSTA squadrons.

From such intelligence data, the OOB section staff compiles a likely order of battle for a planning document or operations order by assessing the following factors:

Enemy&#x27;s Composition, Disposition, Strength (often mnemonicized with SALUTE: Size, Activity, Location, Unit, Time, Equipment):
* Composition: the command structure and organisation of headquarters and subunits
* Disposition: geographical locations of unit headquarters and subunits
* Strength expressed in units and weight of fire delivered by its weapon systems

Enemy capabilities and limitations (often mnemonicized with DRAWD: Defend, Reinforce, Attack, Withdraw, Delay):
* Personnel training
* Logistics: how the enemy unit obtains its supplies and lines of communication
* Combat Effectiveness using complex algorithms and combat modelling applications
* Electronic Technical Data used to provide data for the combat modelling applications

Enemy&#x27;s Most Likely Course of Action (EMLCOA):
* Tactics used by the enemy unit
* Miscellaneous data related to specific task, mission or operations
:* Personalities (known enemy personnel and their behaviour, often based on communications intelligence analysis)
:* Unit history used to judge expected performance based on its past performance
:* Uniforms and insignia to enable confirmation of the above data

A general rule in American military doctrine is that each unit should keep track of enemy subunits two echelons below its own: that is, a division should monitor enemy units confronting it down to the battalion, a brigade should monitor enemy units down to companies, and a battalion should monitor enemy forces down to platoons. 

The United States military&#x27;s intelligence capabilities in the 21st century have allowed for monitoring even further than two echelons down the chain of command. This situational awareness provides a more complete picture of the battlespace for both combatant commanders and tactical commanders.

Up until the end of the Cold War, determining realistic orders of battle was generally an orderly but extremely frustrating process for NATO. The intelligence situation for Western militaries has since been exacerbated as they continue to become engaged in operations against non-traditional enemies (insurgents, guerrillas, etc.) and compiling orders of battle for irregular forces becomes very difficult; the equivalent military intelligence output requiring an increase in acquired data and analysis effort to provide an accurate and timely picture to the commander.

An example of ORBATs in modern warfare can be found for German forces and Allied forces during the Normandy landings. Other examples include the Battle of Bình Giã during the Vietnam War and the Battle of Al Faw during the Iraq War.

<doc id="165081" wikidata="Q840668" url="?curid=165081" title="La Jolla">
<text>La Jolla ( , ) is a hilly, seaside neighborhood in San Diego, California, occupying of curving coastline along the Pacific Ocean. The population reported in the 2010 census was 46,781. The climate is mild, with an average daily temperature of .

La Jolla is surrounded on three sides by ocean bluffs and beaches and is located north of downtown San Diego and south of the Orange County line. The neighborhood&#x27;s border starts at Pacific Beach to the south and extends along the Pacific Ocean shoreline north to include Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve ending at Del Mar.

La Jolla is home to many educational institutions and a variety of businesses in the areas of lodging, dining, shopping, software, finance, real estate, bioengineering, medical practice and scientific research. The University of California, San Diego is located in La Jolla, as is Birch Aquarium, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Scripps Research, and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.

==History==
===Origin of the name===

Local Native Americans, the Kumeyaay, called this location (), ( = ). The topographic feature that gave rise to the name &quot;holes&quot; is uncertain; it probably refers to sea-level caves located on the north-facing bluffs, which are visible from La Jolla Shores. It is suggested that the Kumeyaay name for the area was transcribed by the Spanish settlers as . Another suggestion for the origin of the name is that it is an alternative spelling of the Spanish phrase , which means . Despite being disputed by scholars, this derivation of the name has been widely cited in popular culture. This supposed origin gave rise to the nickname &quot;The Jewel&quot;. The name may also come from the Spanish , meaning a geographic hollow. Different spelling conventions over the years would permit this to be written as La Jolla.

===Early history===


During the Mexican period of San Diego&#x27;s history, La Jolla was mapped as &quot;pueblo&quot; land and contained about 60 lots. When California became a state in 1850, the La Jolla area was incorporated as part of the chartered City of San Diego. In 1870, Charles Dean acquired several of the pueblo lots and subdivided them into an area that became known as La Jolla Park. Dean was unable to develop the land and left San Diego in 1881. A real estate boom in the 1880s led speculators Frank T. Botsford and George W. Heald to further develop the sparsely settled area.

In the 1890s, the San Diego, Pacific Beach, and La Jolla Railway was built, connecting La Jolla to the rest of San Diego. La Jolla became known as a resort area. To attract visitors to the beach, the railway built facilities such as a bath house and a dance pavilion. Visitors were housed in small cottages and bungalows above La Jolla Cove, as well as a temporary tent city erected every summer. Two of the cottages that were built in 1894, the &quot;Red Roost&quot; and the &quot;Red Rest&quot;, also known as the &quot;Neptune and Cove Tea Room&quot;, still exist and are the oldest buildings in La Jolla that are still on their original site. The two cottages have been vacant since the 1980s, boarded up and covered in tarpaulins while their fate was debated. In November 2020 the Red Rest was largely destroyed by fire.

The La Jolla Park Hotel opened in 1893. The Hotel Cabrillo was built in 1908 by &quot;Squire&quot; James A. Wilson and was later incorporated into the La Valencia Hotel.

By 1900, La Jolla comprised 100 buildings and 350 residents. The first reading room (library) was built in 1898. A volunteer fire brigade was organized in 1907; the city of San Diego established a regular fire house in 1914. Livery stable owner Nathan Rannells served successively as La Jolla&#x27;s volunteer fire captain, first police officer (the only San Diego police officer north of Mission Valley), and first postmaster.

La Jolla Elementary School began educating local children in 1896. The Bishop&#x27;s School opened in 1909. La Jolla High School was established in 1922. Between 1951 and 1963, other elementary schools (Bird Rock, Decatur, Scripps, and Torrey Pines) were established in the area to ease overcrowding. The La Jolla Beach and Yacht Club (later the La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club) was built in 1927.

===Ellen Browning Scripps===

In 1896 journalist and publisher Ellen Browning Scripps settled in La Jolla, where she lived for the last 35 years of her life. She was wealthy in her own right from her investments and writing, and she inherited a large sum from her brother George H. Scripps in 1900. She devoted herself to philanthropic endeavors, particularly those benefiting her adopted home of La Jolla. She commissioned many of La Jolla&#x27;s most notable buildings, usually designed by Irving Gill or his nephew and partner Louis John Gill. Many of these buildings are now on the National Register of Historic Places or are listed as historic by the city of San Diego; these include the La Jolla Woman&#x27;s Club (1914), the La Jolla Recreational Center (1915), the earliest buildings of The Bishop&#x27;s School, and the Old Scripps Building at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, as well as her own residence, built in 1915 and now housing the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego. Her donations also launched Scripps Memorial Hospital in 1924 (originally located on Prospect Street in La Jolla until it moved to its present site in 1964), the Scripps Metabolic Clinic (now Scripps Research), and the Children&#x27;s Pool. Ellen Browning Scripps also founded Scripps College, a women&#x27;s college, in 1926. Scripps College is located in Claremont in Los Angeles County (not to be confused with Clairemont, a neighborhood of San Diego).

===Scripps Institution of Oceanography===

Scripps Institution of Oceanography, one of the nation&#x27;s oldest oceanographic institutes, was founded in 1903 by William Emerson Ritter, chair of the zoology department at the University of California, Berkeley, with financial support from Scripps and her brother E. W. Scripps. At first the institution operated out of a boathouse in Coronado. In 1905, they purchased a site in La Jolla, where the Institution still stands today. The first laboratory buildings there opened in 1907. The institution became part of the University of California in 1912. Ultimately, it became the nucleus for the establishment of the University of California, San Diego.

===Camp Matthews===
From 1917 through 1964, the United States Marine Corps maintained a military base in La Jolla. The base was used for marksmanship training and was known as Camp Calvin B. Matthews. During and after World War II, the population of La Jolla grew, causing residential development to draw close to the base, so that it became less and less suitable as a firing range because of risk to the adjacent civilian population. Meanwhile, the site was being eyed as a location for a proposed new campus of the University of California. In 1962, Camp Matthews was declared surplus by the Marine Corps. The base formally closed in 1964, and that same year, the first class of undergraduates enrolled in the University of California San Diego.

===University of California, San Diego===
Local civic leaders had long toyed with the idea of a San Diego campus of the University of California, and the quest became more definite following World War II. Scripps Institution of Oceanography, under its director Roger Revelle, had become an important defense contractor, and local aerospace companies like Convair were pressing for local training for their scientists and engineers. The state legislature proposed the idea in 1955, and the Regents of the university formally approved it in 1960. During the planning stage of the university&#x27;s establishment, it was briefly known as the &quot;University of California, La Jolla&quot;, but the name was changed to &quot;University of California, San Diego&quot; before its founding in 1960. The founding chancellor was Herbert York, named in 1961, and the second chancellor was John Semple Galbraith, named in 1964. The university was designed to have a &quot;college&quot; system; there are now eight colleges. The first college was established in 1965 and was named Revelle College after Roger Revelle, who is regarded as the &quot;father&quot; of the university. A medical school was established in 1968. The landmark Geisel Library with its Brutalist architecture opened in 1970. The university is the second largest employer in the city and has the 7th largest research expenditure in the country.

===Antisemitism===
The Camp Matthews site for the university was selected with some hesitation; one of the concerns was &quot;whether La Jollans in particular would lay aside old prejudices in order to welcome a culturally, ethnically, and religiously diverse professoriate into their midst&quot;. La Jolla had a history of restrictive housing policies, often specified in deeds and ownership documents. In La Jolla Shores and La Jolla Hermosa, only people with pure European ancestry could own property; this excluded Jews, who were not considered white. Such &quot;restrictive covenants&quot; were once fairly common throughout the United States; the 1948 Supreme Court case &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot; ruled them to be unenforceable, and Congress outlawed them twenty years later via the Fair Housing Act (Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968). However, realtors and property owners in La Jolla continued to use more subtle ways of preventing or discouraging Jews from owning property there. Revelle stated the issue bluntly: &quot;You can&#x27;t have a university without having Jewish professors. The Real Estate Broker&#x27;s Association and their supporters in La Jolla had to make up their minds whether they wanted a university or an anti-Semitic covenant. You couldn&#x27;t have both.&quot; The issue was overcome; La Jolla now boasts a thriving Jewish population, and there are four synagogues in La Jolla.

===Mount Soledad cross===
Mount Soledad is an hill on the eastern edge of La Jolla and one of the highest points in San Diego. A large Christian cross was placed at the top in 1913 as a prominent landmark. It has been replaced twice, most recently in 1954 with a cross ( tall including the base). Originally known as the &quot;Mount Soledad Easter Cross&quot;, its presence on publicly owned land was challenged in the 1980s as a violation of the separation of church and state. Since then the cross has had a war memorial built around it and was renamed &quot;Mount Soledad Veterans War Memorial&quot;.

The issue has been in almost continual litigation ever since, with the city attempting to sell or give away the land under the cross. By an act of Congress, the federal government took possession of it under eminent domain in 2006. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declared the cross unconstitutional in 2011, and the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear an appeal. In December 2013, U.S. District Judge Larry Burns ordered that the cross be removed within 90 days, but stayed the order pending a forthcoming appeal by the government.

On July 20, 2015, a group called the Mt. Soledad Memorial Association reported that it had bought the land under the cross from the Department of Defense for $1.4 million. On September 7, 2016, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a one-page ruling, ordering dismissal of the case and an end to all current appeals, stating that the case was now moot because the cross was no longer on government land. Both sides agreed that this decision puts a final end to the case.

===Arts===
La Jolla became an art colony in 1894 when Anna Held (also known as Anna Held Heinrich) established the Green Dragon Colony. This was a cluster of twelve rustic cottages that included The Green Dragon, Wahnfried, and The Ark, a boat-shaped structure with port holes and swinging bunks.

The La Jolla Playhouse was founded in 1947 by Gregory Peck, Dorothy McGuire, and Mel Ferrer. It became inactive in 1959, but was revived in 1983 on the University of California campus under the leadership of Des McAnuff. It now incorporates three theaters: the Mandell Weiss Theatre (1983), the Mandell Weiss Forum (1991) and the Potiker Theater (2005).

The Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego was founded in 1941 in La Jolla, in the former home of Ellen Browning Scripps (designed by Irving J. Gill). The museum has undergone several renovations and expansions, and is working on plans to triple its size.

The La Jolla Music Society was founded in 1941 as the Musical Arts Society of La Jolla by Nikolai Sokoloff, former conductor of the Cleveland Orchestra. It presented the premieres of commissioned works in the auditorium of La Jolla High School before presenting their concerts in the Sherwood Auditorium of the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego. Since April 2019, the Conrad Prebys Performing Arts Center is the permanent home of La Jolla Music Society and hosts world-class performances presented by LJMS as well as other San Diego arts presenters. Additionally, The Conrad will see a wide range of conferences, corporate meetings, and private events.

==Geography==


===Demarcation===
The neighborhoods&#x27;s border starts at Pacific Beach to the south and extends along the Pacific Ocean shoreline north to include Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve ending at Del Mar. La Jolla encompasses the neighborhoods of Bird Rock, Windansea Beach, the commercial center known as the Village of La Jolla, Muirlands, La Jolla Shores, La Jolla Farms, Torrey Pines, and Mount Soledad to name a few.

The City of San Diego defines the neighboorhood&#x27;s eastern boundary as Gilman Drive and the Interstate 5 freeway and the northern boundary as UCSD.

The United States Postal Service defines a somewhat larger area, assigning the neighborhood the 92037 ZIP Code, recognizing it as a historically and geographically distinct area. This unique ZIP code allows addresses to read La Jolla, CA, and is the only neighborhood within the City of San Diego so recognized. Additionally, it is in the 919xx/920xx sequence used for suburban and rural ZIP Codes in San Diego County, rather than the 921xx sequence used for the remainder of the City of San Diego. These conditions sometimes lead to the erroneous impression that La Jolla is a separate city, rather than a part of San Diego. The 92037 ZIP code extends the northeasterly boundary to Genesee Avenue and the northerly boundary to Del Mar, California. The UCSD campus, also part of La Jolla, has ZIP Codes 92092 and 92093.

Despite the city and postal service definitions, La Jolla does not have universally accepted boundaries. In the 1980s, the trustees of Scripps Hospital voted to move the campus from downtown La Jolla to University City, east of Interstate 5 and not within the traditional boundaries of La Jolla. The governing documents of the hospital required it to be located in La Jolla, however. A court ruled that &quot;La Jolla&quot; exists merely as a &quot;state of mind&quot; and thus allowed the relocation of the hospital. Several businesses and housing developments east of Interstate 5 use &quot;La Jolla&quot; in their names despite being geographically located in the University City neighborhood of San Diego, which includes areas east of Interstate 5.

=== Wildlife ===
La Jolla&#x27;s offshore waters are known to be home to an endless array of marine wildlife, including sea lions, harbor seals, whales—such as migratory gray, humpback and blue whales—harbor porpoises, dolphins (including, at times, hundreds of common dolphins, as well as rough-toothed, bottlenose, Pacific white-sided and Risso&#x27;s dolphins, and orcas), green sea turtles, countless fish (such as garibaldi, sculpin and more), many migratory and resident sea and shorebirds, and many different sharks, ranging from diminutive, clam-eating dogfish and leopard sharks to the formidable great white shark. Many of the marine animals live within and/or depend on the extensive offshore kelp forest, where scuba divers often venture to explore and encounter interesting species. The kelp forests are also home to an extensive number of invertebrate species, from sea urchins, abalone, sea stars and limpets to king crab and giant octopus.

Oftentimes, tourists can see California sea lions and harbor seals hauled-out on the rocks, basking in the sun; however, as many local divers and swimmers can attest, pinnipeds are not always a good omen, as their presence usually lures bigger, predatory sharks—namely the great whites. During the winter, these apex predators breed, hunting the plentiful seals around the kelp forest, and sometimes, coming even closer to shore. Piers, caves, and buoys are areas that surfers avoid for these reasons, as sharks patrol these locations to ambush pinnipeds diving back into the water. However, with very few exceptions, the majority of shark encounters are uneventful and not aggressive, and, many times, great white sharks may come within mere feet of surfers or swimmers yet remain completely unnoticed; it is often only with drone footage that such close encounters are even observed.

===Geology===
La Jolla is an area of mixed geology, including sandy beaches and rocky shorelines. The area is occasionally susceptible to flooding and ocean storms, as occurred in January and December 2010.

Mount Soledad is covered with the narrow roads that follow its contours and hundreds of homes overlooking the ocean on its slopes. It is the home of the Mount Soledad Cross, built in 1954, later designated a Korean War Memorial, that became the center of a controversy over the display of religious symbols on government property.

The most compelling geographical highlight of La Jolla is its ocean front, with alternating rugged and sandy coastline that serves as habitat for many wild seal congregations. There are many beaches, accessible from the cliffs all throughout the coast of La Jolla. Locals and surfers will walk barefoot down to the beachfront, occasionally using ropes and planks to safely cross otherwise impassable, steep passageways down the cliff-face. There are many notable tourist locations including Torrey Pines Gliderport, Blacks Beach, Sunset Cliffs, La Jolla Shores, La Jolla Cove, and more. Blacks Beach, commonly known for being one of the only nudist beaches in the area, is one of the most popular lesser known surfer spots throughout the year.

<text>Alagoas (), officially State of Alagoas, is one of the 27 federative units of Brazil and is situated in the eastern part of the Northeast Region. It borders: Pernambuco (N and NW); Sergipe (S); Bahia (SW); and the Atlantic Ocean (E). Its capital is the city of Maceió. It has 1.6% of the Brazilian population and produces 0.8% of the Brazilian GDP. It is made up of 102 municipalities and its most populous cities are Maceió, Arapiraca, Palmeira dos Índios, Rio Largo, Penedo, União dos Palmares, São Miguel dos Campos, Santana do Ipanema, Delmiro Gouveia, Coruripe, and Campo Alegre.

It is the second smallest Brazilian state in area (larger only than Sergipe) and it is 16th in population. It is also one of the largest producers of sugarcane, coconuts, and natural gas in the country. Alagoas also has oil exploration, mostly of onshore deposits.

Land of the &quot;sururu&quot; (or Charru Mussel), lagoon shellfish which serves as food for the coastal population, and of coconut water, Alagoas also possesses some of the country&#x27;s richest folklore.

Initially, the territory of Alagoas constituted the southern part of the Captaincy of Pernambuco and only gained its autonomy in 1817. Its occupation pushed the expansion of the captaincy&#x27;s sugarcane farming, which required new areas of cultivation, southward. Thus arose Porto Calvo, Alagoas (now Marechal Deodoro) and Penedo, nuclei which guided the colonization, economic, and social life of the region for a long time.

The Dutch invasion in Pernambuco was extended to Alagoas in 1631. The invaders were expelled in 1645, after intense fighting in Porto Calvo, leaving the economy in ruins.

The escape of African slaves during the Dutch invasion created a serious labour shortage problem on the sugarcane plantations. Grouped in villages called quilombos, the Africans were only completely dominated at the end of the 17th century with the destruction of the most important quilombo, Palmares.

During the empire, the separatist and republican Confederation of the Equator received the support of noteworthy figures from Alagoas. Throughout the 1840s, political life was marked by the conflict between the &quot;lisos&quot; (lit. &quot;straights&quot;, not the sexual orientation connotation), conservatives, and the &quot;cabeludos&quot; (lit. &quot;hairies&quot;), liberals.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the region&#x27;s hinterland lived through the pioneering experience of Delmiro Gouveia, an entrepreneur from Pernambuco who installed the Estrela thread factory, which came to produce 200 spools daily. Delmiro Gouveia was killed in October 1917 in circumstances still unclarified, after being pressured, according to rumor, to sell his factory to competing foreign firms. After his death, his machines would be destroyed and thrown into Paulo Afonso Falls.

Nicknamed the &quot;Land of the Marshals&quot; (&quot;Terra dos Marechais&quot;), for being the birthplace of Deodoro da Fonseca and Floriano Peixoto, the first two presidents of Brazil, Alagoas gave the country numerous illustrious Brazilians among whom are the anthropologist Arthur Ramos, the maestro Hekel Tavares, the philologist Aurélio Buarque de Holanda, the musicians Djavan and Hermeto Pascoal the poet Jorge de Lima, the jurists Pontes de Miranda and Marcos Bernardes de Mello, besides the writers Lêdo Ivo and Graciliano Ramos.

==Etymology==
The Latin , &quot;reservoir, lake&quot; is the origin, in the primitive vocabulary heritage, of the Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian , French , one of its derivatives, the Latin , &quot;pitfall, hole&quot;, &quot;lack, want, neglect&quot;, explains the Spanish and Italian . But the Portuguese , coincidentally with the Spanish and Mirandese , suggests a change in suffix, already documented in a 938 document from Valencia, under the spelling , and in another from 1094, in Sahagún, under the spelling .

The Portuguese under the spelling (perhaps ), is documented in the 14th century, and alternated with the other for a long time; the prosthesis is then explained by the introduction of the article, chiefly in locution (, ) (&quot;in the lake&quot;, &quot;coming from the lake&quot;), and for morphologic regularization with the derivatives of the verb (&quot;to inundate&quot;) (, , , , etc.) (&quot;swampish, waterlogged, flooding, overflow&quot;, etc.).

The name appears as a competitor with the names of the lagoons of Manguaba, (&quot;the southern lagoon&quot;), and Mundaú, (&quot;the northern lagoon&quot;), already in the 16th century, when settlements were founded near the Alagoa do Norte and the Alagoa do Sul, the Alagoas, with the inclusion of the rest of the lagoons in the area.

The suffix is characteristic of Brazil: , , , , , , and later .

==Geography==
The state&#x27;s name originates with the lakes along its coast near the city of Maceió. The coast is bordered by fringing reefs and many fine beaches. Behind the beaches, sometimes only hundreds of meters and defined by steep scarps, lies a stretch of green coastal hills having enough rainfall for considerable agriculture and scarce remnants of the Atlantic Forest that now is largely limited to steep hill tops or steep valley sides and bottoms. This is the area long dominated by sugar cane.

Still farther inland lies the Sertão of the Northeast region of the nation. The Sertão is a high dry region dominated by scrub that is often thorn-filled and sometimes toxic, the caatinga. This area and its people are famed in legend and song. It is the land of the cowboy who is clad from head to toe (if he is lucky) with very thick leather to avoid the sharp vegetation.

==History==
During the first three centuries of its history, Alagoas was part of the captaincy of Pernambuco, only becoming an independent captaincy in 1817. As a reprisal against the Pernambuco Revolution, the King John VI of Portugal ordered a vast portion of the territory of Pernambuco to be taken from it, most including its southern portion, one part was given to the captaincy of Bahia, the other portion was made independent, creating Alagoas as a new Brazilian captaincy.

Initially, in the first years of the 16th century, Alagoas settlement went on slowly, however helped by Africans turned into slaves whose work urged the local economy. In the period of the 16th and 17th centuries, French pirates invaded its territory attracted by the commerce of brazilwood.

Some time later, Duarte Coelho, owner of the captaincy of Pernambuco, gave the control of the region back to the Portuguese, running the territory as part of his captaincy. He increased the number of sugar cane plantations and built some sugar mills, as well as founding the cities of Penedo and Alagoas – this last one originally baptized by Portuguese as Santa Maria Madalena da Alagoa do Sul (Saint Mary Magdalene of the Southern Lake), currently the historic heritage town of Deodoro da Fonseca.

In 1570, a second expedition ordered by Duarte Coelho and led by Cristóvão Lins, explored the north of Alagoas and founded the settlement of Porto Calvo and five sugar mills, which two of them still endure, Buenos Aires and Escurial.

In 1630, the territory was taken by the Dutch, whose interest was to manage the commerce of sugarcane in most parts of the northeastern region of Brazil. As part of one of the wealthiest Brazilian captaincies, Alagoas prospered along with the sugar trade. They built &quot;Fort Maurits&quot; in Penedo, on the river São Francisco. However, the Dutch colonizers abandoned the territory after being defeated in 1646.

Decades before Alagoas was formed in 1817, its sugar industry had 200 mills, and agriculture also involved cotton, tobacco and corn plantations. With Brazilian independence from Portugal in 1822, Alagoas became a province. In 1839, the capital of the province was changed definitively from the town of Alagoas to Maceió, mainly due to the increasing growth of the city because of its port.

==Demographics==
According to the IBGE of 2008, there were 3,173,000 people residing in the state. The population density was 109.9 inhabitants/km2.

Urbanization: 67.4% (2006); Population growth: 1.3% (1991–2000); Houses: 779,000 (2006).

The 2022 census revealed the following numbers: 1,887,865 Brown (Multiracial) people (60.4%), 915,400 White people (29.3%), 298,709 Black people (9.6%), 20,095 Amerindian people (0.6%), 5,505 Asian people (0.2%).

According to a genetic study from 2013, Brazilians in Alagoas have 53.7% European, 26.6% African and 18.7% Amerindian ancestries, respectively.

==Economy==

Alagoas is one of the poorest states of Brazil. It has the second worst HDI in the country, ahead only of the state of Maranhão, though its indicators have improved in recent years. The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 55.8%, followed by the industrial sector at 36.9%. Agriculture represents 7.3% of the state&#x27;s GDP (2004). Alagoas exports consist of: sugar 58.8%, alcohol 29.4%, chemicals 9%, tobacco 2.1% (2002).

The economy has been agricultural, dependent largely on large sugarcane plantations with some tobacco farming that is concentrated around the city of Arapiraca. Sugar cane formed the basis for an alcohol industry that is in decline. Small to medium-sized tanker ships took alcohol on board in Maceio&#x27;s port with considerable frequency during the peak period. Such loads still take place with less frequency. Another local industry is based on chemical products from brine pumped from deep wells on the outskirts of Maceió.

In the last twenty years the tourist industry has found the beaches and Maceió itself has changed from a rather sleepy little port with coconut palm plantations along its beaches to high-rise hotels. The northern coast, particularly around the towns Maragogi and Japaratinga is beginning to see some of this development in the form of resorts attracting people from the south and from Europe. There is considerable European investment (as of 2007) in beach property north of Maceió with walled compounds of beach homes.

== Infrastructure ==

===International Airport===
Alagoas gained a new airport complex, Zumbi dos Palmares International Airport, in the Maceió Metropolitan Area, designed by homegrown architect Mário Aloísio, which combines glass, metal and granite. It includes space for art exhibitions, a panoramic deck, chapel, seven escalators, nine elevators and four boarding bridges. The whole terminal was designed to permit access by the physically disabled, with ramps and special bathroom fixtures.

In the new terminal, Infraero also brings to Maceió &quot;Aeroshopping&quot; – a concept that is transforming the country&#x27;s airports into centers for leisure and high-quality products and services. The entire building has a computerized air conditioning, with commercial spaces that will be occupied gradually. The parking area was more than tripled. Demand will be able to grow to 1.2 million passengers a year since the new passenger terminal has 24,000 square meters, the triple of its former size. The check-in counters were doubled and can reach higher numbers without any structural remodeling. The building is &quot;intelligent&quot;, meaning controlled by a computerized system that regulates factors ranging from the lighting level to air temperature and even the speed of the escalators. This system also controls access to restricted areas and the fire protection system, among others.

===Port===
The Port of Jaraguá is located in Maceió. The commercial and economic development of the Port of Jaraguá, on the margins of the Mundaú lagoon, was responsible for the emergence of an important settlement that received the name of Maceió and later became the present capital of Alagoas. The Port of Jaraguá is situated in a natural port area that facilitates the ships docking. During the colonial period, the most important products exported through the port were sugar, tobacco, coconut and spices.

==Sports==

Alagoas provides visitors and residents with various sport activities. There are several football clubs based in the state, such as ASA de Arapiraca, CRB, CSA, Murici, Coruripe, CSE, Santa Rita, Penedense and Ipanema.

Maceió was one of the 18 candidates to host games of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which Brazil was the selected host, but it did not make the final cut.

<text>The California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) is a private art school in Santa Clarita, California. It was incorporated in 1961 as the first degree-granting institution of higher learning in the US created specifically for students of both the visual and performing arts. It offers Bachelor of Fine Arts, Master of Fine Arts, Master of Arts, and Doctor of Musical Arts degrees through its six schools: Art, Critical Studies, Dance, Film/Video, Music, and Theater.

The school was first envisioned by many benefactors in the early 1960s including Nelbert Chouinard, Walt Disney, Lulu Von Hagen, and Thornton Ladd.

==History==

CalArts was originally formed in 1961, as a merger of the Chouinard Art Institute (founded 1921) and the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music (founded 1883). Both of the formerly existing institutions were going through financial difficulties, and the founder of the Art Institute, Nelbert Chouinard, was terminally ill. Walt Disney was longtime friends with both Chouinard and Lulu May Von Hagen, the chair of the Conservatory, and discovered and trained many of his studio&#x27;s artists at the two schools (including Mary Blair, Maurice Noble, and some of the Nine Old Men, among others). To keep the educational mission of the schools alive, the merger and expansion of the two institutions was coordinated; a process which continued after Walt&#x27;s death in 1966. Joining him in this effort were his brother Roy O. Disney, Nelbert Chouinard, Lulu May Von Hagen and Thornton Ladd (Ladd &amp; Kelsey, Architects).

Without Walt, the remaining founders assembled a team and planned on creating CalArts as a school that was a destination, like Disneyland, to be a feeder school for the various arts industries. To lead this project they appointed Robert W. Corrigan as the first president of the institute.

The original board of trustees at CalArts included Nelbert Chouinard, Lulu May Von Hagen, Harrison Price, Royal Clark, Robert W. Corrigan, Roy E. Disney, Roy O. Disney, film producer Z. Wayne Griffin, H. R. Haldeman, Ralph Hetzel (then vice president of Motion Picture Association of America), Chuck Jones, Ronald Miller, Millard Sheets, attorney Maynard Toll, attorney Luther Reese Marr, bank executive G. Robert Truex Jr., Jerry Wexler, Meredith Willson, Peter McBean and Scott Newhall (descendants of Henry Newhall), Mrs. Roswell Gilpatric, and Mrs. J. L. Hurschler.

In 1965, the Alumni Association was founded as a separate organization. The 12 founding board of directors members were Mary Costa, Edith Head, Gale Storm, Marc Davis, Tony Duquette, Harold Grieve, John Hench, Chuck Jones, Henry Mancini, Marty Paich, Nelson Riddle, and Millard Sheets.

The ground-breaking for CalArts&#x27; current campus took place on May 3, 1969, as part of the Master Plan for a new planned community in the Santa Clarita Valley of Los Angeles. However, construction of the new campus was hampered by torrential rains, labor shortages, and the Sylmar Earthquake in 1971. As a result, the first combined campus for the Institute started at the former Villa Cabrini Academy (now the home of Woodbury University) in July 1970. CalArts moved to its new campus in Valencia, now part of the city of Santa Clarita, California, in November 1971.

Founding CalArts president Corrigan, formerly the founding dean of the School of Arts at New York University, fired almost all the artists who taught at Chouinard and the Conservatory in his attempt to remake CalArts into his new vision. He appointed fellow academic Herbert Blau to be the founding dean of the School of Theatre and Dance, and serve as the institute&#x27;s first Provost. Blau and Corrigan then hired other academics to found the original academic areas, including Mel Powell (dean of the School of Music), Paul Brach (dean of the School of Art), Alexander Mackendrick (dean of the School of Film), Maurice R. Stein (director of Critical Studies), and Richard Farson (dean of the School of Design), as well as other influential faculty such as Stephan von Huene, Allan Kaprow, Bella Lewitzky, Michael Asher, Jules Engel, John Baldessari, Judy Chicago, Ravi Shankar, Max Kozloff, Miriam Shapiro, Douglas Huebler, Morton Subotnick, Norman M. Klein, and Nam June Paik, most of whom came from a counterculture and &quot;avant garde&quot; perspective.

Corrigan held his position until 1972, when he was fired and replaced by then board member William S. Lund, Walt Disney&#x27;s son-in-law, as the Institute approached insolvency. The period between 1972 and 1975 was extremely unstable financially, and Lund had to make significant operational reductions, including layoffs, the pausing of some degree programs, and the elimination of the School of Design, in order to keep the Institute alive.

In 1975, Robert J. Fitzpatrick was appointed president of CalArts. During his presidency, the Institute grew its enrollment and stabilized, renewed its accreditation, and added new programs for which it is known globally today including the programs of Character Animation and Jazz. While President, Fitzpatrick also served as the director of the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival. He then founded the Los Angeles Festival, which grew directly out of the proceeds of the 1984 Olympic Games. After 1984, John Orders (the assistant to the president/chief of staff) largely coordinated the institute&#x27;s operations in partnership with the other leaders. In 1987, Fitzpatrick resigned as president to take the position of head of EuroDisney (now Disneyland Paris) in Paris, France.

During the search for a President from 1987–1988, Nicholas England, the then dean of the School of Music, served as Acting President. In the fall of 1988, Steven D. Lavine, then the Assistant Program Director for the Arts and Humanities of the Rockefeller Foundation, was appointed president. During his time in office, Lavine continued to grow enrollment without significantly physically expanding the campus, and added the Roy &amp; Edna Disney CalArts Theatre, part of the Los Angeles Music Center&#x27;s new Walt Disney Concert Hall project, to the operations of the Institute.

Lavine navigated the 1994 Northridge Earthquake which closed the main building in Valencia at the start of the spring semester. Classes were held in rental party tents on the 60 acre grounds, and alternate teaching locations were scattered miles apart around Los Angeles County. The building was &quot;red tagged&quot; and not allowed to be used until millions of dollars of repairs were performed. The Federal Emergency Management Agency provided the bulk of the financial assistance allowing fundamental repairs due to seismic activity to occur, with private donations allowing the aesthetic renovations of certain spaces in the building, which opened again during the fall 1994 semester.

Also in 1994, Herb Alpert, a professional musician and admirer of the institute, established the Alpert Awards in the Arts in collaboration with CalArts and his Herb Alpert Foundation. The foundation provides the funding for the awards and related activity. The institute&#x27;s faculty in the fields film/new media, visual arts, theatre, dance, and music select artists in their field to nominate an individual artist who is recognized for their innovation in their given medium. Recipients of the award have a visiting artist residency at CalArts, mentor students, and sometimes premiere work at REDCAT. In 2008, CalArts named the School of Music for Alpert, in recognition of his ongoing support.

On June 24, 2015, Lavine announced he would step down as president in May 2017, after 29 years in the position. After an 18-month search (which included over 500 candidates), Board Chair Tim Disney and the CalArts board of trustees announced on December 13, 2016, that Ravi S. Rajan, then the dean of the School of the Arts at the State University of New York at Purchase, was unanimously selected as president, to begin in June 2017.

Over the years, the institute has developed experimental interdisciplinary laboratories such as the Center for Experiments in Art, Information, and Technology, Center for Integrated Media, Center for New Performance at CalArts, and the Cotsen Center for Puppetry and the Arts. Some of these experimental labs continue today.

==Academics==
CalArts offers various undergraduate and graduate degrees in programs that are related to and combine music, art, dance, film, animation, theater, and writing. Students receive intensive professional training in an area of their creative aspirations without being cast into a rigid pattern. The institute&#x27;s overall focus is on experimental, multidisciplinary, contemporary arts practices, and its stated mission is to enable the professional artists of tomorrow, artists who will transform the world through artistic practice. With these goals in place, the Institute encourages students to recognize the complexity of political, social, and aesthetic questions and to respond to them with informed, independent judgment.

===Admission===
Every program within the Institute requires that applicants send in an artist&#x27;s statement, along with a portfolio or audition to be considered for admission. The institute has never required an applicant&#x27;s SAT or other test scores, and does not consider an applicant&#x27;s GPA as part of the admission process without the consent of the applicant .

===Conception and foundation===
The initial concept behind CalArts&#x27; interdisciplinary approach came from Richard Wagner&#x27;s idea of &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot; (&quot;total artwork&quot;), of which Walt Disney himself was fond and explored in a variety of forms, beginning with his own studio, then later in the incorporation of CalArts. He began with the film &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940), where animators, dancers, composers, and artists alike collaborated. In 1952, Walt Disney Imagineering was founded, where Disney formed a team of artists including Herbert Ryman, Ken O&#x27;Brien, Collin Campbell, Marc Davis, Al Bertino, Wathel Rogers, Mary Blair, T. Hee, Blaine Gibson, Xavier Atencio, Claude Coats, and Yale Gracey. He believed that the same concept that developed WDI could also be applied to a university setting, where art students of different media would be exposed to and explore a wide range of creative directions.

== Campus life ==

=== Schools ===
Schools at CalArts include:

* School of Art
* School of Critical Studies
* The Sharon Disney Lund School of Dance
* School of Film/Video
* The Herb Alpert School of Music
* School of Theater

=== Notable facilities ===

===A113===
A113 is a classroom at CalArts where the character animation program (then called the Disney animation program) was originally founded. Many CalArts alumni have inserted references to it in their works (not just animation) as an homage to this classroom and to CalArts.

===Downtown Los Angeles===
In 2003, CalArts built a theater and art gallery in downtown Los Angeles called REDCAT, the Roy and Edna Disney CalArts Theater as part of the Walt Disney Concert Hall in the Los Angeles Music Center.

===John Baldessari Art Studios===
In 2013, CalArts opened its John Baldessari Art Studios, which cost $3.1 million to build, and features approximately 7,000 square feet of space for MFA Art students and program courses. In addition to debt, funding for the studios was partially raised by the sale of artwork donated by School of Art alumni, for whom each studio was then named.

==Notable people==

CalArts&#x27; notable current and former faculty members include the artists John Baldessari, Judy Chicago, Charles Gaines, Martin Kersels, Thomas Lawson, Miriam Schapiro, and Allan Kaprow. The faculty in theatre arts has included Fran Bennett, Lee Breuer, Ron Cephas Jones, Lew Palter, Suzan-Lori Parks, and Janie Geiser. The faculty in dance has included Donald Byrd, Donald McKayle, and Bella Lewitzky. The faculty in music has included John Bergamo.

Notable alumni include artists Nayland Blake, Raven Chacon, Eric Fischl, Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Mike Kelley, Matt Mullican, and Catherine Opie. Notable alumni working in film and television include Tim Burton, Don Cheadle, David Hasselhoff, Paul Reubens, and Katey Sagal.

==Alpert Award in the Arts==
The Alpert Award in the Arts was established in 1994 by The Herb Alpert Foundation and CalArts. The institute annually awards a $75,000 no-strings-attached fellowship to five artists in the fields of dance, film and video, music, theatre, and visual arts. Awardees have a residency at CalArts during the following academic year.

== Student outcomes ==
According to College Scorecard, the median income in 2020 and 2021 for graduates who matriculated in 2010 and 2011 was $43,071, with 48% of graduates making more than high school graduates. 

British magazine Times Higher Education states the salary 10 years after graduation is $35500. According to Payscale, graduates make $71,000 in early career and $113,200 in mid-career.

Center on Education and the Workforce estimates the return on investment 10 years after graduation with a bachelor&#x27;s from CalArts is -$80,000; however, this metric appreciates to $630,000 40 years after graduation.

=== Graduation rates ===
According to College Scorecard, the graduation rate at Calarts is 65%.

==Reception and legacy==

In 2011, &quot;Newsweek&quot;/&quot;The Daily Beast&quot; listed CalArts as the top school for arts-minded students. The ranking was not aimed to assess the country&#x27;s best school, but rather to assess campuses that offer an exceptional artistic atmosphere.

CalArts&#x27; various schools are consistently featured in the top ten lists of the &quot;best schools&quot; of Art, Film, Animation, Theater, Music, and Dance of publications such as U.S. News, New York Times, The Hollywood Reporter, Variety, and various other news and trade publications. No other single college or university in the world reflects such a high reputation across the full breadth of the many arts and creative industries.

As of 2025, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranks CalArts as the fifth best overall graduate program for fine arts in the U.S..

===Animation industry===
Many students who attended CalArts&#x27; animation programs have found work at Walt Disney Animation Studios, and several of those went on to successful careers at Disney, Pixar, and other animation studios. In February 2014, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine highlighted the success of CalArts&#x27; 1970s animation alumni and briefly profiled several (including Jerry Rees, John Lasseter, Tim Burton, John Musker, Brad Bird, Gary Trousdale, Kirk Wise, Henry Selick and Nancy Beiman) in an article illustrated with a group portrait taken by photographer Annie Leibovitz inside classroom A113.

In the late 1980s, a group of CalArts animation students contacted animation director Ralph Bakshi. As he was in the process of moving to New York, they persuaded him to stay in Los Angeles to continue to produce adult animation. Bakshi then got the production rights to the cartoon character Mighty Mouse. By Bakshi&#x27;s request, Tom Minton and John Kricfalusi then went to the CalArts campus to recruit the best talent from what was the recent group of graduates. They hired Jeff Pidgeon, Rich Moore, Carole Holiday, Andrew Stanton and Nate Kanfer to work on the then-new &quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot; television series.

In an interview, Craig &quot;Spike&quot; Decker of Spike and Mike&#x27;s Festival of Animation criticized commercial aspects of the school, saying &quot;A lot of animators come out of CalArts – they could be so prolific, but then they&#x27;re owned by Disney or someone, and they&#x27;re painting the fins on the Little Mermaid. You&#x27;ll never see their full potential.&quot;

===Art===
During the formative years of the Art School, many of the teaching artists led different camps of movements. The two main camps were the conceptualism students, which were led by John Baldasseri, and the fluxus camp, which was led by Allan Kaprow. Kaprow&#x27;s approach to art was a continuation from his tenure at Rutgers University. Other movements included Light and Space, which was closely related to the artists associated with the Ferus Gallery in the greater Los Angeles area. In 1972, Calarts hosted an exhibition called &quot;The Last Plastics Show&quot;, which was organized by faculty artist Judy Chicago, Doug Edge, as well as Dewain Valentine. This exhibition included artists such as, Carole Caroompas, Ron Cooper, Ronald Davis, Fred Eversley, Craig Kauffman, Linda Levi, Ed Moses, Barbara T. Smith, and Vasa Mihich.

In the autobiography &quot;Bad Boy: My Life On and Off the Canvas&quot; by CalArts alum Eric Fischl, he describes his experience as a student as &quot;CalArts had such a narrow idea of the New. It was innovation for its own sake, a future that didn&#x27;t include the past But without foundation, without techniques or a deeper understanding of history, you&#x27;d go off these wild explorations and end up reinventing the wheel. And then you&#x27;d get slammed for it.&quot;

Art critic Dave Hickey critiqued the art program of CalArts by suggesting that the variety of reference that students are exposed to is limited to a certain pantheon. He stated &quot;I can go over to Cal Arts and ask them if they know who John Wesly is, and they would go, &#x27;Huh? What discourse does he participate in?&#x27; I am in the art world only insofar as there are interesting things for me to write about. When that stops, or when I stop getting offers to write things, I&#x27;ll be out.&quot; Additionally, Hickey mentioned the use of appropriation by students at programs like CalArts. In this, he referenced the VH1 show &quot;Pop-Up Video&quot;, by which he stated &quot;Creators Tad Low and Woody Thompson should receive honorary MFAs for [Pop Up Video], because grad students worldwide are getting diplomas for just this sort of thing -- stealing (or as they say in art school, &quot;appropriating&quot;) hackneyed pop images and scribbling on top of them à la granddaddy Marcel. The show, which would not be out of place on a monitor in a darkened gallery at CalArts [...]&quot;.

In the &quot;LA Weekly&quot; op-ed piece &quot;The Kids Aren&#x27;t All Right: Is over-education killing young artists?&quot;, published in 2005, curator Aaron Rose wrote about an observed trend he recognized in Los Angeles&#x27;s most esteemed art schools and their MFA programs, including CalArts. He uses the example of Supersonic, &quot;a large exhibition ... that features the work of MFA students from esteemed area programs like CalArts, Art Center, UCLA, etc.&quot; In his observation of the showcase, he examined, &quot;... the work left me mostly empty and with a few exceptions seemed like nothing more than a rehash of conceptual ideas that were mined years ago.&quot; He went on to state that &quot;these institutions are staffed with amazing talents (Mike Kelley and John Baldessari among them). Legions of creative young people flock to our city [Los Angeles] every year to work alongside their heroes and develop their talents with hopes of making it as an artist.&quot; He goes on to further state &quot;What happens too often in these situations, though, is that we find young artists simply emulating their instructors, rather than finding and honing their own aesthetics and points of view about the world, society, themselves. In the beginnings of an artist&#x27;s career, the power in his or her work should lie not in their technique or knowledge of art history or theory or business acumen, but in what one has to say.&quot;

Musician and CalArts alumnus Ariel Pink notes in an interview &quot;Unlike other art schools, they didn&#x27;t focus on skills of any kind, specific color theory or anything like that. They were the only art school that was totally focused on teaching artists about the art market. They were trying to make the next Damien Hirst. They&#x27;re trying to make the next Jeff Koons. Those guys don&#x27;t need to know how to paint or draw.&quot;

===Music===
CalArts graduates have joined or started successful pop bands, including: Maryama, Tranquility Bass, The Belle Brigade, The Weirdos, The Swords of Fatima / Buko Pan Guerra, Bedroom Walls, Dawn of Midi, Dirtwire, The Rippingtons, Fitz and the Tantrums, Fol Chen, London After Midnight, No Doubt, Mission of Burma, Radio Vago, Oingo Boingo, Acetone, Liars, Suburban Lawns, The Mae Shi, The Suburbs, Touché Amoré, and Ozomatli.

Individually, Danny Elfman and Grant-Lee Phillips never officially enrolled at CalArts, but participated in the world music courses at CalArts. Elfman would later gain recognition for his composition work with CalArts alum Tim Burton, and Phillips would go onto a career in music.

Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon, members of the band Sonic Youth, remarked in an interview with VH1 about the band Liars, of which Angus Andrew and Julian Gross are CalArts luminaries. Moore&#x27;s initial remarks were: &quot;There&#x27;s this whole world of young people who [think] everything&#x27;s allowed. What Liars are doing right now is completely crazy. I saw them the other night and it was really great. It&#x27;s really out-there&quot;. Gordon then stated &quot;I&#x27;m not so crazy about the way [the Liars&#x27; They Were Wrong, So We Drowned] sounds. It&#x27;s like &#x27;how lo-fi can we make it?&#x27; But I think the content is really good&quot;. In reference to CalArts and Gordon&#x27;s statement, Moore lastly remarked &quot;They&#x27;re art kids. They came out of CalArts and that&#x27;s the kind of sensibility you have when you come out of these sort of places.&quot; Interestingly, Moore&#x27;s partner Gordon went to the Otis College of Art and Design, herself a product of an art school. In a 2005 interview, Moore discussed the book &quot;Jack Goldstein and the CalArts Mafia&quot; and his conversation with Gordon after reading the book. During their conversation, Moore asked Gordon why she had chosen to attend Otis College of Art and Design instead of CalArts, a school she had always wanted to attend since she grew up in Los Angeles. Gordon explained that she was unable to afford CalArts&#x27; high tuition. Moore went on to emphasize that the book did not mention the economic feasibility of attending CalArts and that this financial barrier can create a division between those who can afford highly regarded academic art education and those who pursue DIY art.

===Theater===
In his book, &quot;Survival of the Richest&quot;, media theorist and MFA directing program graduate Douglas Rushkoff described his time while a theater student at CalArts. He saw CalArts as an institution that offered numerous opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration; however, despite the creative atmosphere, the theater school was rooted in tradition, adhering to the classical approach to drama with a focus on crisis, climax, and resolution.

Rushkoff, influenced by the experimental theater of the 1970s and 1980s (i.e. Happenings, Fluxus), had a different perspective on theater. Rushkoff believed in blurring the line between performer and audience, and questioned the traditional theater model, which he viewed as imposing a sense of inevitability and confirming established order. He saw this as cultural propaganda, creating problems in the first act and solving them in the last.

In addition to his dissatisfaction with the traditional theater model, Rushkoff was troubled by the high cost of theater productions. After attending a performance of Brecht&#x27;s Threepenny Opera at the Ahmanson Theatre in 1989, and noticing the high cost of the least expensive ticket, he decide to leave the theater behind in favor of the Internet. He believed that interactivity and digital platforms, such as the Web and hypertext stories, would provide users with multiple pathways and the freedom to choose their own adventures. Even in video games with clear-cut goals (i.e. Super Mario, World of Warcraft), players could derive satisfaction from exploring the game world rather than focusing solely on achieving the official story objectives.
== &quot;CalArts style&quot; animation ==
A pejorative term, &quot;CalArts style&quot; gained prominence in the late 2010s to describe an animation style allegedly overused on popular American television channels such as Cartoon Network and Disney Channel. The term had reportedly been in use within the animation industry since the early 1990s; its spread outside of the industry is attributed to animator John Kricfalusi. In a now-deleted blog post from 2010 about the film &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;, Kricfalusi criticized what he saw as young animators subconsciously copying superficial aspects of well-respected animators&#x27; work (specifically, late 1950s to 1970s Disney movies) without learning underlying animation skills. As the decade progressed, the term came to refer to a cartoon aesthetic different from the one Kricfalusi described. Works that have been said to exemplify this version of the &quot;CalArts style&quot; include &quot;Adventure Time&quot;, &quot;Gravity Falls&quot;, and &quot;Over the Garden Wall&quot;, which were from CalArts graduates Pendleton Ward, Alex Hirsch, and Pat McHale respectively, but also the works of many non-CalArts animators, such as Rebecca Sugar&#x27;s &quot;Steven Universe&quot;, Ben Bocquelet&#x27;s &quot;The Amazing World of Gumball&quot;, Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon&#x27;s &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, Domee Shi&#x27;s Academy Award-nominated &quot;Turning Red&quot;, etc.

Detractors claim that because of CalArts&#x27; importance to American animation, it often inspires other styles of illustration. American animator Rob Renzetti questioned the use of the term, saying that it has been applied so broadly as to be functionally meaningless as criticism, and is instead just name calling. Adam Muto, executive producer on &quot;Adventure Time&quot;, has also said the term over-simplifies the process of animation design, and is too vague. Gavia Baker-Whitelaw on &quot;The Daily Dot&quot; wrote that many animation fans that deride the &quot;CalArts style&quot; do so only when it is associated with shows that appear to promote, in their views, &quot;Tumblr culture&quot; that favors progressive views.

<text>The Hutt Valley (or &#x27;The Hutt&#x27;) is the large area of fairly flat land in the Hutt River valley in the Wellington region of New Zealand. Like the river that flows through it, it takes its name from Sir William Hutt, a director of the New Zealand Company in early colonial New Zealand.

The river flows roughly along the course of an active geologic fault, which continues to the south to become the main instrument responsible for the uplift of the South Island&#x27;s Southern Alps. For this reason, the land rises abruptly to the west of the river; to the east two floodplains have developed. The higher of these is between from the mouth of the river. Beyond this, the river is briefly confined by a steep-sided gorge near Taitā, before the land opens up into a long triangular plain close to the outflow into Wellington Harbour.

The Waiwhetu Aquifer is formed from water seeping underground from the Hutt River near Taitā. It flows underground down the Hutt Valley and out under Wellington Harbour.

==Human settlement==
Some early Māori nations (iwi) of the region were Ngāi Tara, Muaūpoko, Rangitāne, Ngāti Apa ki te Rā Tō and Ngāti Ira. These iwi descended from the sons of Whātonga, Taraika and Tautoki-ihu-nui-a-Whātonga, who migrated through the lower North Island with some descendants settling in the Hutt Valley. The name Heretaunga is often applied to the Hutt Valley from the name of the &#x27;house of Whātonga at Nukutaurua vollage (pā)&#x27;.

In 1846 there was fighting between Māori tribes and the Government, known as the Hutt Valley Campaign.

The Hutt River also has the name Te Awa Kairangi, and was a major arterial route for Māori. There was a trail linking Wellington Harbour and the Wairarapa over the Remutaka Range and through Pākuratahi river. Before the 1855 Wairarapa earthquake large Māori boats (waka) could travel as far Pākuratahi river, and European ships could also go up the valley &#x27;almost&#x27; to Silverstream.

The lower valley contains the city of Lower Hutt, administered by Hutt City Council, while the adjacent, larger but less populous city of Upper Hutt has its centre on the smaller plain above the Taita Gorge. The valley forms a major dormitory suburban area for Wellington, and is a location for manufacturing and heavy industry, educational and recreational facilities, and the region&#x27;s motor camps.

Petone, on the Wellington Harbour shoreline, was proposed as the initial site for the settlement of Wellington by the New Zealand Company. However, as the chosen site was soon seen to be prone to river flooding, early settlement was relocated to Wellington. A small settlement remained at the Petone site as the whole valley was believed to be well suited as farm land.

Almost the whole valley was clearfelled and converted to pasture or market gardens before the urbanisation of the 20th century. A small remnant of the early podocarp forest is preserved in Barton&#x27;s Bush in Upper Hutt.

<doc id="165093" wikidata="Q1421250" url="?curid=165093" title="Taxiing">
<text>Taxiing (rarely spelled taxying) is the movement of an aircraft on the ground, under its own power, in contrast to towing or pushback where the aircraft is moved by a tug. The aircraft usually moves on wheels, but the term also includes aircraft with skis or floats (for water-based travel).

An airplane uses taxiways to taxi from one place on an airport to another; for example, when moving from a hangar to the runway. The term &quot;taxiing&quot; is not used for the accelerating run along a runway prior to takeoff, or the decelerating run immediately after landing, which are called the takeoff roll and landing rollout, respectively; however, aircraft are considered to be taxiing when they leave the runway after landing to travel to a gate or remote stand for disembarkment.

== Etymology ==

As early as 1909 aviation journalists envisioned aeroplanes to replace the taxicab in traffic-congested cities. 

Some aviators and some linguists report that around the year 1911 the slang word &quot;taxi&quot; was in use for an &quot;airplane&quot;. They suggest that the way aircraft move under power before they take off or after they land reminded someone of the way taxicabs slowly drove around the block when looking for passengers.

Also by 1909, French aviation pioneers like Blériot, Farman and Voisin used the term &quot;taxi&quot; for a trainer aircraft, that was so constructed that a pupil would not accidentally get airborne.

Usage of the word for an airplane quickly disappeared again, but the verb &quot;to taxi&quot; stuck, and words like the &quot;taxiway&quot; were derived from it.

== Propulsion ==

The thrust to propel the aircraft forward comes from its propellers or jet engines. Reverse thrust for backing up can be generated by thrust reversers such as on the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, or reversible pitch propellers such as on the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, a rare procedure known as powerback. Most aircraft, however, are not designed to back up on their own and must be pushed back either by hand or by using an aircraft tug.

At low power settings, combustion aircraft engines operate at lower efficiency than at cruise power settings. A typical A320 spends an average of 3.5 hours a day taxiing, using of fuel. Hybrid electrically driven nose gear are under development to allow high use aircraft to shut down the engines during taxi operations.

== Control ==
Steering is achieved by turning a nose wheel or tail wheel/rudder; the pilot controls the direction travelled with their feet. Larger jet aircraft have a tiller wheel on the left side of the cockpit that acts as a steering wheel allowing the nosewheel to be turned hydraulically. Braking is controlled by differential toe or heel brakes. Not all aircraft have steerable wheels, and in some cases steering is solely by means of differential braking (all Van&#x27;s aircraft for instance) or solely by means of the rudder (including all floatplanes).

== Hover taxi ==
Skid-equipped helicopters and other VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft conduct hover taxiing to move in ground effect in the same manner that wheel-equipped aircraft ground taxi. In general hover taxis are conducted at speeds up to , or below translational lift.

The Bell CH-135 Twin Huey is hover taxied in a manner typical for skid-equipped aircraft of that size:

== Safety ==

When taxiing, aircraft travel slowly. This ensures that they can be stopped quickly and do not risk wheel damage on larger aircraft if they accidentally turn off the paved surface. Taxi speeds are typically .

Rotor downwash limits helicopter hover-taxiing near parked light aircraft. The use of engine thrust near terminals is restricted due to the possibility of structural damage or injury to personnel caused by jet blast.

<text>In aviation, a runway is an elongated, rectangular surface designed for the landing and takeoff of an aircraft. Runways may be a human-made surface (often asphalt, concrete, or a mixture of both) or a natural surface (grass, dirt, gravel, ice, sand or salt). Runways, taxiways and ramps, are sometimes referred to as &quot;tarmac&quot;, though very few runways are built using tarmac. Takeoff and landing areas defined on the surface of water for seaplanes are generally referred to as waterways. Runway lengths are now commonly given in meters worldwide, except in North America where feet are commonly used.

==History==
In 1916, in a World War I war effort context, the first concrete-paved runway was built in Clermont-Ferrand in France, allowing local company Michelin to manufacture Bréguet Aviation military aircraft.

In January 1919, aviation pioneer Orville Wright underlined the need for &quot;distinctly marked and carefully prepared landing places, [but] the preparing of the surface of reasonably flat ground [is] an expensive undertaking [and] there would also be a continuous expense for the upkeep.&quot;

==Headings==
For fixed-wing aircraft, it is advantageous to perform takeoffs and landings into the wind to reduce takeoff or landing roll and reduce the ground speed needed to attain flying speed. Larger airports usually have several runways in different directions, so that one can be selected that is most nearly aligned with the wind. Airports with one runway are often constructed to be aligned with the prevailing wind. Compiling a wind rose is one of the preliminary steps taken in constructing airport runways. Wind direction is given as the direction the wind is coming &quot;from&quot;: a plane taking off from runway 09 faces east, into an &quot;east wind&quot; blowing from 090°.
Originally in the 1920s and 1930s, airports and air bases (particularly in the United Kingdom) were built in a triangle-like pattern of three runways at 60° angles to each other. The reason was that aviation was only starting, and although it was known that wind affected the runway distance required, not much was known about wind behaviour. As a result, three runways in a triangle-like pattern were built, and the runway with the heaviest traffic would eventually expand into the airport&#x27;s main runway, while the other two runways would be either abandoned or converted into taxiways. 

===Naming===

Runways are named by a number between 01 and 36, which is generally the magnetic azimuth of the runway&#x27;s heading in decadegrees. This heading differs from true north by the local magnetic declination. A runway numbered 09 points east (90°), runway 18 is south (180°), runway 27 points west (270°) and runway 36 points to the north (360° rather than 0°). When taking off from or landing on runway 09, a plane is heading around 90° (east). A runway can normally be used in both directions, and is named for each direction separately: e.g., &quot;runway 15&quot; in one direction is &quot;runway 33&quot; when used in the other. The two numbers differ by 18 (= 180°). For clarity in radio communications, each digit in the runway name is pronounced individually: runway one-five, runway three-three, etc. (instead of &quot;fifteen&quot; or &quot;thirty-three&quot;).
A leading zero, for example in &quot;runway zero-six&quot; or &quot;runway zero-one-left&quot;, is included for all ICAO and some U.S. military airports (such as Edwards Air Force Base). However, most U.S. civil aviation airports drop the leading zero as required by FAA regulation. This also includes some military airfields such as Cairns Army Airfield. This American anomaly may lead to inconsistencies in conversations between American pilots and controllers in other countries.

Military airbases may include smaller paved runways known as &quot;assault strips&quot; for practice and training next to larger primary runways. These strips eschew the standard numerical naming convention and instead employ the runway&#x27;s full three digit heading; examples include Dobbins Air Reserve Base&#x27;s Runway 110/290 and Duke Field&#x27;s Runway 180/360.

Runways with non-hard surfaces, such as small turf airfields and waterways for seaplanes, may use the standard numerical scheme or may use traditional compass point naming, examples include Ketchikan Harbor Seaplane Base&#x27;s Waterway E/W. Airports with unpredictable or chaotic water currents, such as Santa Catalina Island&#x27;s Pebbly Beach Seaplane Base, may designate their landing area as Waterway ALL/WAY to denote the lack of designated landing direction.

===Letter suffix===
If there is more than one runway pointing in the same direction (parallel runways), each runway is identified by appending left (L), center (C) and right (R) to the end of the runway number to identify its position (when facing its direction)—for example, runways one-five-left (15L), one-five-center (15C), and one-five-right (15R). Runway zero-three-left (03L) becomes runway two-one-right (21R) when used in the opposite direction (derived from adding 18 to the original number for the 180° difference when approaching from the opposite direction). In some countries, regulations mandate that where parallel runways are too close to each other, only one may be used at a time under certain conditions (usually adverse weather).

At large airports with four or more parallel runways (for example, at Chicago O&#x27;Hare, Los Angeles, Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta, Denver, Dallas–Fort Worth and Orlando), some runway identifiers are shifted by 1 to avoid the ambiguity that would result with more than three parallel runways. For example, in Los Angeles, this system results in runways 6L, 6R, 7L, and 7R, even though all four runways are actually parallel at approximately 69°. At Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, there are five parallel runways, named 17L, 17C, 17R, 18L, and 18R, all oriented at a heading of 175.4°. Occasionally, an airport with only three parallel runways may use different runway identifiers, such as when a third parallel runway was opened at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in 2000 to the south of existing 8R/26L—rather than confusingly becoming the &quot;new&quot; 8R/26L it was instead designated 7R/25L, with the former 8R/26L becoming 7L/25R and 8L/26R becoming 8/26.

Suffixes may also be used to denote special-use runways. Airports that have seaplane waterways may choose to denote the waterway on charts with the suffix W; such as Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu and Lake Hood Seaplane Base in Anchorage. Small airports that host various forms of air traffic may employ additional suffixes to denote special runway types based on the type of aircraft expected to use them, including STOL aircraft (S), gliders (G), rotorcraft (H), and ultralights (U). Runways that are numbered relative to true north rather than magnetic north will use the suffix T; this is advantageous for certain airfields in the far north such as Thule Air Base (08T/26T).

===Renumbering===
Runway designations may be changed over time as the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field shifts and their headings shift with it. This is more common at higher latitudes: for example, Fairbanks International Airport in Alaska renames runways roughly every 24 years, most recently in 2009. In northern Canada, runways are designated based on true north, which avoids the need to update them. Nav Canada, Canada&#x27;s air navigation service provider, has advocated for an industry-wide switch to true north.

As runways are designated with headings rounded to the nearest 10°, some runways are affected sooner than others; e.g. a hypothetical Runway 23 with a heading of 226° would only have to shift to 224° to become Runway 22. Because magnetic drift itself is slow, these changes are uncommon, and not welcomed, as they require accompanying changes in aeronautical charts and descriptive documents. When a runway designation does change, it is often done at night, especially at major airports, because taxiway signs need to be changed and the numbers at each end of the runway need to be repainted to the new runway designators. In 2009 for example, London Stansted Airport in the United Kingdom changed its runway designation from 05/23 to 04/22 during the night.

==Declared distances==

Runway dimensions vary from as small as long and wide in smaller general aviation airports, to long and wide at large international airports built to accommodate the largest jets, to the huge lake bed runway 17/35 at Edwards Air Force Base in California – developed as a landing site for the Space Shuttle.

Takeoff and landing distances available are given using one of the following terms:

* Takeoff Run Available (TORA) – The length of runway declared available and suitable for the ground run of an airplane taking off.
* Takeoff Distance Available (TODA) – The length of the takeoff run available plus the length of the clearway, if clearway is provided. (The clearway length allowed must lie within the aerodrome or airport boundary. According to the Federal Aviation Regulations and Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR) TODA is the lesser of TORA plus clearway or 1.5 times TORA).
* Accelerate-Stop Distance Available (ASDA)– The length of the takeoff run available plus the length of the stopway, if stopway is provided.
* Landing Distance Available (LDA) – The length of runway that is declared available and suitable for the ground run of an airplane landing.
* Emergency Distance Available (EMDA) – LDA (or TORA) plus a stopway.

==Sections==
There are standards for runway markings.

* The runway thresholds are markings across the runway that denote the beginning and end of the designated space for landing and takeoff under non-emergency conditions.
* The runway safety area is the cleared, smoothed and graded area around the paved runway. It is kept free from any obstacles that might impede flight or ground roll of aircraft.
* The runway is the surface from threshold to threshold (including displaced thresholds), which typically features threshold markings, numbers, and centerlines, but excludes blast pads and stopways at both ends.
* Blast pads are often constructed just before the start of a runway where jet blast produced by large planes during the takeoff roll could otherwise erode the ground and eventually damage the runway. 
* Stopways, also known as overrun areas, are also constructed at the end of runways as emergency space to stop planes that overrun the runway on landing or a rejected takeoff.
** Blast pads and stopways look similar, and are both marked with yellow chevrons; stopways may optionally be surrounded by red runway lights. The differences are that stopways can support the full weight of an aircraft and are designated for use in an aborted takeoff, while blast pads are often not as strong as the main paved surface of the runway and are not to be used for taxiing, landing, or aborted takeoffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;AC 150/5300-13B&quot;&gt; FAA Advisory Circular 150/5300-13B&lt;/ref&gt; An engineered materials arrestor system (EMAS) may also be present, which may overlap with the end of the blast pad or stopway and is painted similarly (although an EMAS does not count as part of a stopway).

* Displaced thresholds may be used for taxiing, takeoff, and landing rollout, but not for touchdown. A displaced threshold often exists because of obstacles just before the runway, runway strength, or noise restrictions making the beginning section of runway unsuitable for landings. It is marked with white paint arrows that lead up to the beginning of the landing portion of the runway. As with blast pads, landings on displaced thresholds are not permitted aside from emergency use or exigent circumstance.

* Relocated thresholds are similar to displaced thresholds. They are used to mark a portion of the runway temporarily closed due to construction or runway maintenance. This closed portion of the runway is not available for use by aircraft for takeoff or landing, but it is available for taxi. While methods for identifying the relocated threshold vary, a common way for the relocated threshold to be marked is a ten-foot-wide white bar across the width of the runway.
* Clearway is an area beyond the paved runway, aligned with the runway centerline and under the control of the airport authorities. This area is not less than 500 ft and there are no protruding obstacles except for threshold lights provided they are not higher than 26 inches. There is a limit on the upslope of the clearway of 1.25%. The length of the clearway may be included in the length of the takeoff distance available. For example, if a paved runway is long and there are of clearway beyond the end of the runway, the takeoff distance available is long. When the runway is to be used for takeoff of a large airplane, the maximum permissible takeoff weight of the airplane can be based on the takeoff distance available, including clearway. Clearway allows large airplanes to take off at a heavier weight than would be allowed if only the length of the paved runway is taken into account.

==Markings==

There are runway markings and signs on most large runways. Larger runways have a distance remaining sign (black box with white numbers). This sign uses a single number to indicate the remaining distance of the runway in thousands of feet. For example, a 7 will indicate remaining. The runway threshold is marked by a line of green lights.

There are three types of runways:

* Visual runways are used at small airstrips and are usually just a strip of grass, gravel, ice, asphalt, or concrete. Although there are usually no markings on a visual runway, they may have threshold markings, designators, and centerlines. Additionally, they do not provide an instrument-based landing procedure; pilots must be able to see the runway to use it. Also, radio communication may not be available and pilots must be self-reliant.
* Non-precision instrument runways are often used at small- to medium-size airports. These runways, depending on the surface, may be marked with threshold markings, designators, centerlines, and sometimes a mark (known as an aiming point, sometimes installed at ). While centerlines provide horizontal position guidance, aiming point markers provide vertical position guidance to planes on visual approach.
* Precision instrument runways, which are found at medium- and large-size airports, consist of a blast pad/stopway (optional, for airports handling jets), threshold, designator, centerline, aiming point, and , /, , , and touchdown zone marks. Precision runways provide both horizontal and vertical guidance for instrument approaches.

Waterways may be unmarked or marked with buoys that follow maritime notation instead.

For runways and taxiways that are permanently closed, the lighting circuits are disconnected. The runway threshold, runway designation, and touchdown markings are obliterated and yellow &quot;Xs&quot; are placed at each end of the runway and at intervals.

===National variants===
* In Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, as well as some other countries or territories (Hong Kong and Macau) all 3-stripe and 2-stripe touchdown zones for precision runways are replaced with one-stripe touchdown zones.
* In some South American countries like Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, one 3-stripe is added and a 2-stripe is replaced with the aiming point.
* Some European countries replace the aiming point with a 3-stripe touchdown zone.
* Runways in Norway have yellow markings instead of the usual white ones. This also occurs in some airports in Japan, Sweden, and Finland. The yellow markings are used to ensure better contrast against snow.
* Runways may have different types of equipment on each end. To reduce costs, many airports do not install precision guidance equipment on both ends. Runways with one precision end and any other type of end can install the full set of touchdown zones, even if some are past the midpoint. Runways with precision markings on both ends omit touchdown zones within of the midpoint, to avoid ambiguity over the end with which the zone is associated.

==Lighting==
A line of lights on an airfield or elsewhere to guide aircraft in taking off or coming in to land or an illuminated runway is sometimes also known as a flare path.

===Technical specifications===


Runway lighting is used at airports during periods of darkness and low visibility. Seen from the air, runway lights form an outline of the runway. A runway may have some or all of the following:
* Runway end identifier lights (REIL) – unidirectional (facing approach direction) or omnidirectional pair of synchronized flashing lights installed at the runway threshold, one on each side.
* Runway end lights – a pair of four lights on each side of the runway on precision instrument runways, these lights extend along the full width of the runway. These lights show green when viewed by approaching aircraft and red when seen from the runway.
* Runway edge lights – white elevated lights that run the length of the runway on either side. On precision instrument runways, the edge-lighting becomes amber in the last of the runway, or last third of the runway, whichever is less. Taxiways are differentiated by being bordered by blue lights, or by having green center lights, depending on the width of the taxiway, and the complexity of the taxi pattern.
* Runway centerline lighting system (RCLS) – lights embedded into the surface of the runway at intervals along the runway centerline on some precision instrument runways. White except the last : alternate white and red for next and red for last .
* Touchdown zone lights (TDZL) – rows of white light bars (with three in each row) at intervals on either side of the centerline for .
* Taxiway centerline lead-off lights – installed along lead-off markings, alternate green and yellow lights embedded into the runway pavement. It starts with green light at about the runway centerline to the position of first centerline light beyond the Hold-Short markings on the taxiway.
* Taxiway centerline lead-on lights – installed the same way as taxiway centerline lead-off Lights, but directing airplane traffic in the opposite direction.
* Land and hold short lights – a row of white pulsating lights installed across the runway to indicate hold short position on some runways that are facilitating land and hold short operations (LAHSO).
* Approach lighting system (ALS) – a lighting system installed on the approach end of an airport runway and consists of a series of lightbars, strobe lights, or a combination of the two that extends outward from the runway end.

According to Transport Canada&#x27;s regulations, the runway-edge lighting must be visible for at least . Additionally, a new system of advisory lighting, runway status lights, is currently being tested in the United States.

The edge lights must be arranged such that:
* the minimum distance between lines is , and maximum is 
* the maximum distance between lights within each line is 
* the minimum length of parallel lines is 
* the minimum number of lights in the line is 8.
===Control of lighting system===
Typically the lights are controlled by a control tower, a flight service station or another designated authority. Some airports/airfields (particularly uncontrolled ones) are equipped with pilot-controlled lighting, so that pilots can temporarily turn on the lights when the relevant authority is not available. This avoids the need for automatic systems or staff to turn the lights on at night or in other low visibility situations. This also avoids the cost of having the lighting system on for extended periods. Smaller airports may not have lighted runways or runway markings. Particularly at private airfields for light planes, there may be nothing more than a windsock beside a landing strip.

==Safety==
Types of runway safety incidents include:
* Runway excursion – an incident involving only a single aircraft, where it makes an inappropriate exit from the runway (e.g. Thai Airways Flight 679).
** Runway overrun (also known as an overshoot) – a type of excursion where the aircraft is unable to stop before the end of the runway (e.g. Air France Flight 358, TAM Airlines Flight 3054, Air India Express Flight 812).
* Runway incursion – an incident involving incorrect presence of a vehicle, person or another aircraft on the runway (e.g. Aeroflot Flight 3352, Scandinavian Airlines Flight 686).
* Runway confusion – an aircraft makes use of the wrong runway for landing or takeoff (e.g. Singapore Airlines Flight 006, Western Airlines Flight 2605).
* Runway undershoot – an aircraft that lands short of the runway (e.g. British Airways Flight 38, Asiana Airlines Flight 214).

==Surface==
The choice of material used to construct the runway depends on the use and the local ground conditions. For a major airport, where the ground conditions permit, the most satisfactory type of pavement for long-term minimum maintenance is concrete. Although certain airports have used reinforcement in concrete pavements, this is generally found to be unnecessary, with the exception of expansion joints across the runway where a dowel assembly, which permits relative movement of the concrete slabs, is placed in the concrete. Where it can be anticipated that major settlements of the runway will occur over the years because of unstable ground conditions, it is preferable to install asphalt concrete surface, as it is easier to patch on a periodic basis. Fields with very low traffic of light planes may use a sod surface. Some runways make use of salt flats.

For pavement designs, borings are taken to determine the subgrade condition, and based on the relative bearing capacity of the subgrade, the specifications are established. For heavy-duty commercial aircraft, the pavement thickness, no matter what the top surface, varies from , including subgrade.

Airport pavements have been designed by two methods. The first, &quot;Westergaard&quot;, is based on the assumption that the pavement is an elastic plate supported on a heavy fluid base with a uniform reaction coefficient known as the K value. Experience has shown that the &quot;K&quot; values on which the formula was developed are not applicable for newer aircraft with very large footprint pressures.

The second method is called the &quot;California bearing ratio&quot; and was developed in the late 1940s. It is an extrapolation of the original test results, which are not applicable to modern aircraft pavements or to modern aircraft landing gear. Some designs were made by a mixture of these two design theories. A more recent method is an analytical system based on the introduction of vehicle response as an important design parameter. Essentially it takes into account all factors, including the traffic conditions, service life, materials used in the construction, and, especially important, the dynamic response of the vehicles using the landing area.

Because airport pavement construction is so expensive, manufacturers aim to minimize aircraft stresses on the pavement. Manufacturers of the larger planes design landing gear so that the weight of the plane is supported on larger and more numerous tires. Attention is also paid to the characteristics of the landing gear itself, so that adverse effects on the pavement are minimized. Sometimes it is possible to reinforce a pavement for higher loading by applying an overlay of asphaltic concrete or portland cement concrete that is bonded to the original slab. Post-tensioning concrete has been developed for the runway surface. This permits the use of thinner pavements and should result in longer concrete pavement life. Because of the susceptibility of thinner pavements to frost heave, this process is generally applicable only where there is no appreciable frost action.

===Pavement surface===
Runway pavement surface is prepared and maintained to maximize friction for wheel braking. To minimize hydroplaning following heavy rain, the pavement surface is usually grooved so that the surface water film flows into the grooves and the peaks between grooves will still be in contact with the aircraft tyres. To maintain the macrotexturing built into the runway by the grooves, maintenance crews engage in airfield rubber removal or hydrocleaning in order to meet required FAA, or other aviation authority friction levels.

===Pavement subsurface drainage and underdrains===
Subsurface underdrains help provide extended life and excellent and reliable pavement performance. At the Hartsfield Atlanta, GA airport the underdrains usually consist of trenches wide and deep from the top of the pavement. A perforated plastic tube ( in diameter) is placed at the bottom of the ditch. The ditches are filled with gravel size crushed stone. Excessive moisture under a concrete pavement can cause pumping, cracking, and joint failure.

=== Surface type codes===
In aviation charts, the surface type is usually abbreviated to a three-letter code.

The most common hard surface types are asphalt and concrete. The most common soft surface types are grass and gravel.

==Length==

A runway of at least in length is usually adequate for aircraft weights below approximately . Larger aircraft including widebodies will usually require at least at sea level. International widebody flights, which carry substantial amounts of fuel and are therefore heavier, may also have landing requirements of or more and takeoff requirements of . The Boeing 747 is considered to have the longest takeoff distance of the more common aircraft types and has set the standard for runway lengths of larger international airports.

At sea level, can be considered an adequate length to land virtually any aircraft. For example, at O&#x27;Hare International Airport, when landing simultaneously on 4L/22R and 10/28 or parallel 9R/27L, it is routine for arrivals from East Asia, which would normally be vectored for 4L/22R () or 9R/27L () to request 28R (). It is always accommodated, although occasionally with a delay. Another example is that the Luleå Airport in Sweden was extended to to allow any fully loaded freight aircraft to take off. These distances are also influenced by the runway grade (slope) such that, for example, each 1 percent of runway down slope increases the landing distance by 10 percent.

An aircraft taking off at a higher altitude must do so at reduced weight due to decreased density of air at higher altitudes, which reduces engine power and wing lift. An aircraft must also take off at a reduced weight in hotter or more humid conditions (see density altitude). In the worst case, this is colloquially referred to as hot and high operation, among the most challenging conditions for takeoff performance. Most commercial aircraft carry manufacturer&#x27;s tables showing the adjustments required for a given temperature.

<doc id="165096" wikidata="Q854248" url="?curid=165096" title="Takeoff">
<text>Takeoff is the phase of flight in which an aerospace vehicle leaves the ground and becomes airborne. For aircraft traveling vertically, this is known as liftoff.

For aircraft that take off horizontally, this usually involves starting with a transition from moving along the ground on a runway. For balloons, helicopters and some specialized fixed-wing aircraft (VTOL aircraft such as the Harrier and the Bell Boeing V22 Osprey), no runway is needed.

==Horizontal==
===Power settings===
For light aircraft, usually full power is used during takeoff. Large transport category (airliner) aircraft may use a reduced power for takeoff, where less than full power is applied in order to prolong engine life, reduce maintenance costs and reduce noise emissions. In some emergency cases, the power used can then be increased to increase the aircraft&#x27;s performance. Before takeoff, the engines, particularly piston engines, are routinely run up at high power to check for engine-related problems. The aircraft is permitted to accelerate to rotation speed (often referred to as Vr). The term &quot;rotation&quot; is used because the aircraft pivots around the axis of its main landing gear while still on the ground, usually because of gentle manipulation of the flight controls to make or facilitate this change in aircraft attitude (once proper air displacement occurs under / over the wings, an aircraft will lift off on its own; controls are to ease that in).

The nose is raised to a nominal 5°–15° nose up pitch attitude to increase lift from the wings and effect liftoff. For most aircraft, attempting a takeoff without a pitch-up would require cruise speeds while still on the runway.

Fixed-wing aircraft designed for high-speed operation (such as commercial jet aircraft) have difficulty generating enough lift at the low speeds encountered during takeoff. These are therefore fitted with high-lift devices, often including slats and usually flaps, which increase the camber and often area of the wing, making it more effective at low speed, thus creating more lift. These are deployed from the wing before takeoff, and retracted during the climb. They can also be deployed at other times, such as before landing.

===Required speeds===
The &quot;takeoff speed required&quot; varies with aircraft weight and aircraft configuration (flap or slat position, as applicable), and is provided to the flight crew as indicated airspeed.

Operations with transport category aircraft employ the concept of the takeoff V-speeds: V1, VR and V2. These speeds are determined not only by the above factors affecting takeoff performance, but also by the length and slope of the runway and any peculiar conditions, such as obstacles off the end of the runway. Below V1, in case of critical failures, the takeoff should be aborted; above V1 the pilot continues the takeoff and returns for landing. After the co-pilot calls V1, they will call VR or &quot;rotate,&quot; marking speed at which to rotate the aircraft. The VR for transport category aircraft is calculated such as to allow the aircraft to reach the regulatory screen height at V2 with one engine failed. Then, V2 (the safe takeoff speed) is called. This speed must be maintained after an engine failure to meet performance targets for rate of climb and angle of climb.
In a single-engine or light twin-engine aircraft, the pilot calculates the length of runway required to take off and clear any obstacles, to ensure sufficient runway to use for takeoff. A safety margin can be added to provide the option to stop on the runway in case of a rejected takeoff. In most such aircraft, any engine failure results in a rejected takeoff as a matter of course, since even overrunning the end of the runway is preferable to lifting off with insufficient power to maintain flight.

If an obstacle needs to be cleared, the pilot climbs at the speed for maximum climb angle (Vx), which results in the greatest altitude gain per unit of horizontal distance travelled. If no obstacle needs to be cleared, or after an obstacle is cleared, the pilot can accelerate to the best rate of climb speed (Vy), where the aircraft will gain the most altitude in the least amount of time. Generally speaking, Vx is a lower speed than Vy, and requires a higher pitch attitude to achieve.

The speeds needed for takeoff are relative to the motion of the air (indicated airspeed). A headwind will reduce the ground speed needed for takeoff, as there is a greater flow of air over the wings. Typical takeoff air speeds for jetliners are in the range of . Light aircraft, such as a Cessna 150, take off at around . Ultralights have even lower takeoff speeds. For a given aircraft, the takeoff speed is usually dependent on the aircraft weight; the heavier the weight, the greater the speed needed. Some aircraft are specifically designed for short takeoff and landing (STOL), which they achieve by becoming airborne at very low speeds.

===Assistance===
Assisted takeoff is any system for helping aircraft into the air (as opposed to strictly under its own power). The reason it might be needed is due to the aircraft&#x27;s weight exceeding the normal maximum takeoff weight, insufficient power, or the available runway length may be insufficient, or a hot and high airfield, or a combination of all four factors. Assisted takeoff is also required for gliders, which do not have an engine and so are unable to take off by themselves. Hence assisted takeoff is required.

==Vertical==

Vertical takeoff refers to aircraft or rockets that take off in a vertical trajectory. Vertical takeoff eliminates the need for airfields. Most vertical take off aircraft are also able to land horizontally, but there were certain rocket-powered aircraft of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; that only took off vertically, landing in other ways. The Bachem Ba 349 &quot;Natter&quot; landed under a parachute after having taken off vertically. Other late projects developed in Nazi Germany, such as the Heinkel P.1077 &quot;Julia&quot; or the Focke-Wulf &quot;Volksjäger&quot; 2, climbed to their ceiling at a nearly vertical angle and landed later on a skid.

===VTOL===
Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft include fixed-wing aircraft that can hover, take off and land vertically as well as helicopters and other aircraft with powered rotors, such as tiltrotors. Some VTOL aircraft can operate in other modes as well, such as CTOL (conventional take-off and landing), STOL (short take-off and landing), and/or STOVL (short take-off and vertical landing). Others, such as some helicopters, can only operate by VTOL, due to the aircraft lacking landing gear that can handle horizontal motion. VTOL is a subset of V/STOL (vertical and/or short take-off and landing).

Besides the helicopter, there are two types of VTOL aircraft in military service: craft using a tiltrotor, such as the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey, and some aircraft using directed jet thrust such as the Harrier family.

===Rocket launch===
The takeoff phase of the flight of a rocket is called &quot;rocket launch&quot;. Launches for orbital spaceflights, or launches into interplanetary space, are usually from a fixed location on the ground, but may also be from a floating platform such as the San Marco platform, or the Sea Launch launch vessel.

<doc id="165097" wikidata="Q1499786" url="?curid=165097" title="Climb (aeronautics)">
<text>In aviation, a climb or ascent is the operation of increasing the altitude of an aircraft. It is also the logical phase of a typical flight (the &quot;climb phase&quot; or &quot;climbout&quot;) following takeoff and preceding the cruise. During the climb phase there is an increase in altitude to a predetermined level.
The opposite of a climb is a &quot;descent&quot;.

== Climb operation ==

A steady climb is carried out by using excess thrust, the amount by which the thrust from the power plant exceeds the drag on the aircraft. The aircraft will climb steadily until the excess thrust falls to zero. Excess thrust might fall to zero as a result of the pilot&#x27;s deliberate action in control of the output of the engines, or as the engines&#x27; response to reducing air density.

== Climb phase ==

The climb phase, also known as climb-out or initial climb, is the period during which the aircraft climbs to a predetermined cruising altitude after take-off. The climb phase immediately follows take-off and precedes the cruise phase of the flight. Although a single climb phase is typical, multiple climb phases may alternate with cruise phases, particularly for very long flights in which altitude is increased as the weight of fuel aboard decreases (see &quot;step climb&quot;).

As the climb progresses, the rate of climb decreases as thrust reduces due to reducing air density. A gradual climb improves forward visibility over the nose of the aircraft.

Aircraft also climb when flying in a zone of rising air, but since such zones are unpredictable and inconveniently located, and since most are poorly adapted to passive climbs of this type, only gliders attempt such climbs on a regular basis.

== Normal climb ==

In some jurisdictions and under some conditions, normal climbs are defined by regulations or procedures, and are used to develop airway systems, airspaces, and instrument procedures. Normal climbs are simply standardized climb rates achievable by most aircraft under most conditions that are used as conservative guidelines when developing procedures or structures that are partially a function of such rates. For example, a normal climb of 20 meters per km (120 feet per nautical mile) might be assumed during the development of a navigational procedure or while defining airspace limits in airport terminal areas.

<text>Aschaffenburg (; Hessian: &quot;Aschebersch&quot;) is a town in northwest Bavaria, Germany. The town of Aschaffenburg, despite being its administrative seat, is not part of the district of Aschaffenburg.

Aschaffenburg belonged to the Archbishopric of Mainz for more than 800 years. The town is located at the westernmost border of Lower Franconia and separated from the central and eastern part of the &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; (administrative region) by the Spessart hills, whereas it opens towards the Rhine-Main plain in the west and the north-west. Therefore, the inhabitants speak neither Bavarian nor East Franconian but rather a local version of Rhine Franconian.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is located on both sides of the Main in north-west Bavaria, bordering to Hesse. On a federal scale it is part of central Germany, just southeast of Frankfurt am Main. In the western part of the municipality, the smaller Aschaff flows into the Main. The region is also known as &quot;Bayerischer Untermain&quot; (&quot;Bavarian Lower Main&quot;).

=== Climate ===
The climate is continental, typically with warm, dry summers and cold, damp winters. Aschaffenburg usually receives less snowfall during the winter than the nearby Spessart.

=== Subdivision ===
Aschaffenburg comprises 10 &quot;Stadtteile&quot;:

* Damm
* Gailbach
* Leider
* Nilkheim
* Obernau
* &quot;Obernauer Kolonie&quot; (Obernauer Colony)
* &quot;Österreicher Kolonie&quot; (Austrian Colony)
* Schweinheim
* &quot;Stadtmitte&quot; (town center)
* Strietwald

Nilkheim and Leider are the only &quot;Stadtteile&quot; that are located on the left bank of the river Main.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
The following municipalities border Aschaffenburg (clockwise, from the north): Johannesberg, Glattbach, Goldbach, Haibach, Bessenbach, Sulzbach am Main, Niedernberg, Großostheim, Stockstadt am Main and Mainaschaff.

== History ==
=== Etymology ===
The name &quot;Aschaffenburg&quot; (&quot;Ascaffaburc&quot;, &quot;Ascapha&quot; or &quot;Ascaphaburg&quot; in the Middle Ages) originally meant &quot;castle at the ash tree river&quot; deriving from the river &quot;Aschaff&quot; that runs through parts of the town.

===Pre-history to Middle Ages===
The earliest remains of settlements in the area of Aschaffenburg date from the Stone Age.

Aschaffenburg was originally a settlement of the Alamanni. Roman legions were stationed here. In c. 700 AD, the &quot;Ravenna Cosmography&quot; names two settlements in region: &quot;Uburzis&quot; (Würzburg) and &quot;Ascapha&quot; (Aschaffenburg).

Around 550, the area had been conquered by the Franks, and their &quot;Hausmeier&quot; built a castle here. In the 8th century, a Benedictine monastery was founded, dedicated to St. Michael, reportedly by Saint Boniface. This became the &quot;Kollegiatstift St. Peter und Alexander&quot; in the second half of the 10th century (957). In 869, King Louis the Younger married Liutgard of Saxony at Aschaffenburg. She also died here in 885 and was later laid to rest with her daughter Hildegard in the &quot;Stiftskirche&quot;. &quot;Ascaffinburg&quot; is mentioned first in 974 in a gift document by Otto II, in which he gave several villages including Wertheim am Main and a stretch of forest in the Spessart to the collegiate church.

In the Middle Ages the town was known as &quot;Ascaffaburc&quot;, &quot;Ascapha&quot; or &quot;Ascaphaburg&quot;. A stone bridge over the Main was reportedly built by Archbishop Willigis in 989, who also made the town his second residence. The town (referred to in 975 as a &quot;civitas&quot;) was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 982, when Duke Otto died. A &quot;Vizedom&quot; is mentioned for the first time in 1122 as the top local representative of the Archbishop. In 1292 a synod was held here, and in 1447 an imperial diet, preliminary to that of Vienna, approved a concordat (sometimes called the &quot;Aschaffenburg Concordat&quot;). In the German Peasants&#x27; War (1525), the town backed the losing side.

=== Modern times through 19th century ===
In 1552, the late-Gothic castle of Johannisburg was destroyed. It was replaced in 1605-14 by the Renaissance &quot;Schloss Johannisburg&quot;. The town suffered greatly during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, being held in turn by the various belligerents. During the Battle of Dettingen (1743), which took place to the north, the town was occupied by French troops. It formed part of the electorate of the Archbishop of Mainz, and in 1803 was made over to Archbishop Karl Theodor von Dalberg as the Principality of Aschaffenburg.
Aschaffenburg was the site of the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Königlich Bayerische Centralforstlehranstalt&quot;), established in 1807, &quot;made famous by the researches of Professor Dr Ernst Ebermayer.&quot; The academy was &quot;dissolved in 1832, but re-organized under the Ministry of Finance in 1874&quot;; and, as &quot;of 30th March, 1874, united to the University of Munich.&quot;

In 1810, the Principality of Aschaffenburg was merged into the new Grand Duchy of Frankfurt although Dalberg retained Aschaffenburg as his residence. In 1814, the town was transferred to the Kingdom of Bavaria by an Austrian-Bavarian treaty. In 1817 it was included within Bavarian Lower Franconia. From 1840 to 1848, King Ludwig I of Bavaria had a Roman villa built to the west of town. It was named &quot;Pompejanum&quot; after its model, the house of Castor and Pollux at Pompeii.

During the Austro-Prussian War, the Prussian Army inflicted a severe defeat on the Grand Duchy of Hesse near Aschaffenburg in the Battle of Frohnhofen on 13 July 1866.

=== World War II ===
In World War II, Aschaffenburg was heavily damaged by Allied area bombing, including Schloss Johannisburg, which was completely restored several years later. The German military chose to defend Aschaffenburg strongly during the last weeks of the war, which resulted in the Battle of Aschaffenburg fought 28 March – 3 April 1945. The U.S. 45th Infantry Division was forced to take the fortified town against stiff German resistance in a series of frontal assaults that involved house-to-house fighting and vicious close combat. The resulting widespread urban destruction was quite severe, as cannon fire was used point-blank to blast through structures.

=== Aschaffenburg displaced persons camps ===
At the end of World War II, the United States Army occupied military facilities that had been used and controlled by the Wehrmacht. These were converted for use by U.S. military personnel as processing centres for displaced persons at the end of the war. From 1945 7,000 Ukrainians were accommodated in four displaced persons camps:

* &quot;Artillerie Kaserne&quot; — approx. 2,000 people (1945–1949)
* &quot;Bois Brulé Kaserne&quot; — 1,500 people (1946–1949)
* &quot;LaGarde Kaserne&quot; — 1,700 people (1945–1949)
* &quot;Pionier Kaserne&quot; — 2,000 people (1946–1949)

Two other camps, &quot;Alte (old) Kaserne&quot; and &quot;Jäger Kaserne&quot; housed mainly Poles and Lithuanians.

=== Post-war development ===
In the decades following the war, Aschaffenburg and the surrounding region experienced robust economic prosperity, partially due to its close proximity to Frankfurt am Main.
According to an online 2002 survey in &quot;Stern&quot; magazine, [Stern 14/2002], 82 percent of residents living in the &quot;Bayerischer Untermain&quot; region where Aschaffenburg is located were satisfied with the place where they lived. This was the highest level recorded in the survey, making the region the #1 place to live in Germany, based on several factors including employment opportunities in the region, educational facilities, public services, transportation, recreational options, shopping, cultural facilities/events, climate, etc.

Another survey taken in 2006 by McKinsey, &quot;Stern&quot; magazine, ZDF, and web.de again showed that Aschaffenburg has one of the highest ratings for quality of life in Germany.

In January 2025, two people were killed in the 2025 Aschaffenburg stabbing, a knife attack by an Afghan asylum seeker in the Schöntal park.

=== U.S. military presence (1945–2007) ===
Aschaffenburg was the location of several United States Army installations throughout the Cold War. After initially taking over the administration of the ex-Wehrmacht installations, which were then used as displaced persons camps, the American presence in the Aschaffenburg military community began after general renovations in 1948. The installation sites were known as &quot;Ready Kaserne&quot; (previously &quot;Artillerie Kaserne&quot;), &quot;Smith Kaserne&quot; (previously &quot;LaGarde Kaserne&quot;), &quot;Graves Kaserne&quot; (previously &quot;Bois Brulé Kaserne&quot;), &quot;Fiori Kaserne&quot; (previously &quot;Pionier Kaserne&quot;), and &quot;Jaeger Kaserne&quot; (previously &quot;Jäger Kaserne&quot;). These housed armour, infantry, engineer, maintenance and artillery elements of the U.S. Army 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division and various VII Corps elements including the 9th Engineer Battalion, the 3rd Bn 21st Field Artillery (Honest John), and the 1st Bn 80th Field Artillery (LANCE). Much of the U.S. Army presence in Aschaffenburg ended in 1992 with the ending of the Cold War. The last buildings, which were primarily used for housing, were handed back to the local government in 2007.

==== Roads ====
Aschaffenburg is located on Bundesautobahn 3 between Frankfurt am Main and Würzburg. The southern terminus of Bundesautobahn 45 is located just west of the town. Bundesstrasse B 26 passes through the town. Bundestrasse B 8 used to pass through Aschaffenburg, but has now been rerouted along the Bundesautobahn 3. Three road bridges cross the river Main at Aschaffenburg: Friedrich Ebert Bridge (a new span opened in 2008), Willigis Bridge and Konrad Adenauer Bridge. In the 1980s, a road tunnel was constructed under the Schlossplatz to improve traffic flow through the &quot;Stadtmitte&quot; (town center).

After 43 years of planning and construction, the limited-access &quot;Innenstadtring&quot; or &quot;inner-town-ring&quot; road was completed in July 2013. It allows motorists to bypass the &quot;Stadtmitte&quot; (town center) and reduces traffic congestion in Aschaffenburg, which has been a problem in recent years. Another road project called &quot;Bahnparallele&quot; is currently under construction, with a small section already opened. It is located in the &quot;Stadtteil&quot; of Damm and runs parallel to the railway tracks.

<doc id="165100" wikidata="Q24746" url="?curid=165100" title="Provinces of the Philippines">
<text>In the Philippines, provinces ( or ) are one of its primary political and administrative divisions. There are 82 provinces at present, which are further subdivided into component cities and municipalities. The local government units in the National Capital Region, as well as independent cities, are independent of any provincial government. Each province is governed by an elected legislature called the Sangguniang Panlalawigan and an elected governor.

The provinces are grouped into eighteen regions based on geographical, cultural, and ethnological characteristics. Thirteen of these regions are numerically designated from north to south, while the National Capital Region, the Cordillera Administrative Region, the Southwestern Tagalog Region (Mimaropa), the Negros Island Region, and the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao are only designated by acronyms.

Each province is a member of the League of Provinces of the Philippines, an organization that aims to address issues affecting provincial and metropolitan government administrations.
== Government ==
A provincial government is autonomous of other provinces within the republic. Each province is governed by two main elected branches of the government: executive and legislative. Judicial affairs are separated from provincial governance and are administered by the Supreme Court of the Philippines. Each province has at least one branch of a Regional Trial Court.

=== Executive ===

The provincial governor is chief executive and head of each province. Provincial governors are elected to a term of three years and limited to three consecutive terms and appoint the directors of each provincial department which include the office of administration, engineering office, information office, legal office, and treasury office.

=== Legislative ===

The vice governor acts as the president for each &quot;Sangguniang Panlalawigan&quot; (SP; &quot;Provincial Board&quot;), the province&#x27;s legislative body. Every SP is composed of regularly elected members from provincial districts, as well as &quot;ex officio&quot; members. The number of regularly elected SP members allotted to each province is determined by its income class. First- and second-class provinces are provided ten regular SP members; third- and fourth-class provinces have eight, while fifth- and sixth-class provinces have six. Exceptions are provinces with more than five congressional districts, such as Cavite with 16 regularly elected SP members, and Cebu, Negros Occidental and Pangasinan which have twelve each.

Every SP has designated seats for &quot;ex officio&quot; members, given to the respective local presidents of the Association of Barangay Captains (ABC), Philippine Councilors&#x27; League (PCL), and &quot;Sangguniang Kabataan&quot; (SK; &quot;Youth Council&quot;).

The vice governor and regular members of an SP are elected by the voters within the province. &quot;Ex officio&quot; members are elected by members of their respective organizations.

=== Relation to other levels of government ===
==== National government ====
National intrusion into the affairs of each provincial government is limited by the Philippine Constitution. The President of the Philippines however coordinates with provincial administrators through the Department of the Interior and Local Government. For purposes of national representation, each province is guaranteed its own congressional district. One congressional representative represents each district in the House of Representatives. Senatorial representation is elected at an at-large basis and not apportioned through territory-based districts.

==== Cities and municipalities ====

Those classified as either &quot;highly urbanized&quot; or &quot;independent component&quot; cities are independent from the province, as provided for in Section 29 of the Local Government Code of 1991. Although such a city is a self-governing second-level entity, in many cases it is often presented as part of the province in which it is geographically located, or in the case of Zamboanga City, the province it last formed part the congressional representation of.

Local government units classified as &quot;component&quot; cities and municipalities are under the jurisdiction of the provincial government. In order to make sure that all component city or municipal governments act within the scope of their prescribed powers and functions, the Local Government Code mandates the provincial governor to review executive orders issued by mayors, and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan to review legislation by the Sangguniang Panlungsod (City Council) or Sangguniang Bayan (Municipal Council), of all component cities and municipalities under the province&#x27;s jurisdiction.

=== Barangays ===
The provincial government does not have direct relations with individual barangays. Supervision over a barangay government is the mandate of the mayor and the Sanggunian of the component city or municipality of which the barangay in question is a part.

=== Classification ===

Provinces are classified according to average annual income based on the previous 4 calendar years. Effective July 29, 2008, the thresholds for the income classes for cities are:
A province&#x27;s income class determines the size of the membership of its Sangguniang Panlalawigan, and also how much it can spend on certain items, or procure through certain means.

== List ==


=== Former provinces ===
* Manila (until 1901) Incorporated into Rizal; portions around Manila later consolidated to form present-day NCR.
* Lepanto-Bontoc (1902–1908) Incorporated into Mountain Province.
* Moro Province (1903–1913) Converted to the Department of Mindanao and Sulu, composed of seven provinces. Now part of several regions in Mindanao.
* Ambos Camarines (1901–1908) Divided into Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur, although the wording of &quot;Act No. 2809&quot; implies Camarines Norte was created from &quot;Ambos Camarines&quot;, the remainder of which was renamed Camarines Sur. Camarines Sur retained the provincial capital of Nueva Caceres.
* Misamis (1901–1939) Partitioned into Misamis Occidental and Misamis Oriental. Misamis Oriental retained the provincial capital of Cagayan.
* Mindoro (1902–1950) Divided into Occidental Mindoro and Oriental Mindoro. Oriental Mindoro retained the provincial capital of Calapan.
* Zamboanga (1914–1952) Partitioned into Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga del Sur. The &quot;de jure&quot; provincial capital of Molave was placed under the jurisdiction of Zamboanga del Sur which had its capital in Pagadian. Zamboanga Sibugay later created from Zamboanga del Sur.
* Lanao (1914–1959) Divided into Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur. Lanao del Sur retained the provincial capital of Dansalan (now Marawi).
* Surigao (1901–1967) Partitioned into Surigao del Norte and Surigao del Sur. Surigao del Norte retained the provincial capital of Surigao City and the provincial seal. The province of Dinagat Islands was later created from Surigao del Norte.
* Davao (1914–1967; 1972–1998) Divided into Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur and Davao Oriental. Davao del Norte was officially known as Davao from 1972 to 1998, when Compostela Valley (now Davao de Oro) was later created from Davao province. Davao Occidental later created from Davao del Sur.
* Agusan (1907–1967) Partitioned into Agusan del Norte and Agusan del Sur. Agusan del Norte retained the former provincial capital of Butuan. The provincial capital was officially transferred to Cabadbaran in 2000 but the provincial government services and functions are yet to be completely transferred to the new capital.
* Negros del Norte (1985–1986) &quot;Batas Pambansa Blg. 885&quot;, which created a new province out of the northern part of Negros Occidental, took effect on December 23, 1985, with a plebiscite to ratify the law held on January 3, 1986. The province comprised the present-day cities of Cadiz (which was to serve as the capital), Escalante, Sagay, San Carlos, Silay and Victorias, as well as the municipalities of Calatrava, Don Salvador Benedicto, Enrique B. Magalona, Manapla, and Toboso. Despite voters ratifying &quot;Batas Pambansa Blg. 885&quot;, on July 11, 1986, the Supreme Court declared the law and the proclamation of the province null and void. The ruling states the enabling law was unconstitutional for, among other things, not including the rest of Negros Occidental in the plebiscite, and the proposed province not meeting the 3,500 square kilometer land area requirement of the 1983 Local Government Code.
* Kalinga-Apayao (1966–1995) Divided into Apayao and Kalinga. Kalinga retained the provincial capital of Tabuk.
* Shariff Kabunsuan (2006–2008) &quot;Republic Act No. 9054&quot; conferred to the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao expanded powers, especially the capacity to create provinces (Article VI, Section 19). Based on this, the ARMM Regional Legislative Assembly enacted &quot;Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 201&quot; on August 28, 2006. The Act created a new province, comprising all the municipalities in the first congressional district of Maguindanao (except Cotabato City), with its capital at Datu Odin Sinsuat. The province&#x27;s creation was approved on October 28, 2006, by a majority vote in a plebiscite. Responding to requests for clarification as to which congressional districts form Shariff Kabunsuan for the 2007 elections (specifically whether Cotabato City was part of the representation of the new province), COMELEC issued &quot;Resolution No. 7845&quot;, which initially held Cotabato City to be the sole remaining LGU in the First District of Maguindanao. COMELEC later amended this with &quot;Resolution No. 7902&quot;, which maintained the &quot;status quo&quot; before the province&#x27;s creation. The COMELEC resolutions became the subject of a case in which the Supreme Court opined that because &quot;the power to create new a province or city inherently involves the power to create a legislative district&quot;—a power that Congress did not explicitly delegate to the ARMM Regional Assembly—the creation of a province by a lower legislative body (the ARMM Regional Assembly) will necessarily entail the creation of a legislative district for a higher legislative body (Congress). Therefore, on July 16, 2008, the Supreme Court declared Section 19, Article VI of &quot;RA No. 9054&quot; unconstitutional, &quot;MMA Act No. 201&quot; void, and &quot;COMELEC Resolution No. 7902&quot; valid.
* Maguindanao (1973–2022)&quot;Republic Act No. 11550&quot; divided the province into Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur through a plebiscite. Maguindanao del Norte resembles the former province of Shariff Kabunsuan however adds the municipality of Sultan Sumagka into its territory. The capital of Maguindanao del Norte is Datu Odin Sinsuat while the capital of Maguindanao del Sur is Buluan.

=== Timeline ===
When the United States acquired the Philippines from Spain in 1898, the islands were divided into four &quot;gobiernos&quot; (governments), which were further subdivided into provinces and districts. The American administration initially inherited the Spanish divisions and placed them under military government. As insurgencies were pacified, civil government was gradually organized.

== Formally proposed/renamed provinces ==
=== Proposed provinces with enacted law ===
* Occidental Leyte and Oriental Leyte (1923)Leyte was divided into two new provinces by &quot;Act No. 3117&quot; on March 27, 1923. The division never took place, however, as no proclamation was issued by the Governor-General.
** The province of Oriental Leyte would have covered the present-day territories of the entire province of Biliran, the municipalities of Abuyog, Alangalang, Babatngon, Barugo, Burauen, Calubian, Capoocan, Carigara, Dagami, Dulag, Jaro, Javier, Julita, La Paz, Leyte, MacArthur, Mahaplag, Mayorga, Palo, Pastrana, San Isidro, San Miguel, Santa Fe, Tabango, Tabontabon, Tanauan, Tolosa, Tunga and Tacloban (which was designated as the provincial capital).
** The province of Occidental Leyte would have covered the present-day territories of the entire province of Southern Leyte, the municipalities of Albuera, Bato, Hilongos, Hindang, Inopacan, Isabel, Kananga, Matag-ob, Matalom, Mérida, Palompon, Villaba and the cities of Baybay and Ormoc. The province capital of Occidental Leyte &quot;SEC. 2.&quot; ... shall be designated by the Governor-General, until determined by a plurality vote of the electors of the new province at the next general election.&quot;&quot;
* Samal (1969)The sub-province of Samal was created by &quot;Republic Act No. 5999&quot; and covered the area of the present-day Island Garden City of Samal. However, the sub-province was never inaugurated.
* Maranaw (1971)&quot;Republic Act No. 6406&quot;, which sought to create a new province out of eastern Lanao del Sur (now corresponding to the province&#x27;s first congressional district), was approved on October 4, 1971. The province was to consist of the municipalities of Bubong, Ditsaan-Ramain (including what is now Buadiposo-Buntong), Kapai, Lumba-Bayabao (including what is now Maguing), Marantao, Masiu, Mulondo, Saguiaran, Piagapo, Poona Bayabao, Tamparan, Taraka and Wao (including what is now Bumbaran), with the chartered city of Marawi serving as the new province&#x27;s capital. Lanao del Sur was to retain the remaining municipalities, with Malabang serving as its new capital. Section 4 of RA 6406 provided that &quot;&quot;The new provinces as provided in this Act shall come into existence upon the election and qualification of their first elective provincial officials, who shall be elected in a special election simultaneously with the general elections of November, nineteen hundred and seventy-three&quot;.&quot; The division never took place due to the declaration of martial law in the Philippines on September 21, 1972, which disrupted the scheduled general elections for 1973 and paved the way for the adoption of a new Constitution and the establishment of the Fourth Philippine Republic. A legacy of this unimplemented division is the existence of two ZIP code series for Lanao del Sur: the 93- series was retained by what were to be the remaining towns of the province (with Malabang, the new capital, being reassigned the code 9300), while a new series (97-) was assigned to what was supposed to be the province of Maranaw (with Marawi getting the new code 9700).

==== Rejected in a plebiscite ====
* Isabela del Norte and Isabela del Sur (1995)On February 20, 1995, &quot;Republic Act No. 7891&quot;, which sought to divide the province of Isabela, was approved. Isabela del Norte was to comprise municipalities belonging to the province&#x27;s first and second congressional districts with Ilagan serving as capital. Isabela del Sur was to consist of the third and fourth congressional districts (excluding the independent component city of Santiago), with Cauayan as the capital. The proposed division was rejected in a plebiscite held on June 20, 1995.
* Quezon del Norte and Quezon del Sur (2007)The act dividing the province of Quezon into two, &quot;Republic Act No. 9495&quot;, lapsed into law without the President&#x27;s signature on September 7, 2007. Quezon del Norte (which would be renamed from Quezon) was to be composed of the first and second congressional districts of the province, with Lucena as its capital. Quezon del Sur, with its capital at Gumaca, would have been composed of the third and fourth congressional districts. The COMELEC held the plebiscite on December 13, 2008, and the majority of the votes rejected the division. Notwithstanding the voters&#x27; rejection, all the representatives of Quezon&#x27;s four legislative districts—Wilfrido Mark Enverga, Irvin Alcala, Danilo Suarez, and Lorenzo Tañada III—reintroduced the measure as House Bill No. 3839 on December 8, 2010. They explained that “the wisdom, logic and bare facts behind what is driving this bill to be filed again in this Congress remain,” citing the persistence of poverty in far-flung coastal municipalities and small islands. Yet, the bill did not make it out of the committee level this time.
* Palawan del Norte, Palawan Oriental, and Palawan del Sur (2021) On April 5, 2019, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11259 that proposed the division the province of Palawan, with the exception of the independent city of Puerto Princesa, into three separate provinces. A plebiscite was originally scheduled for the second Monday of May 2020 but was postponed to March 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Palawan del Norte would have been composed of Taytay and municipalities north of it. Palawan del Sur would have been composed of the municipalities west and south of Puerto Princesa, including Kalayaan (which administers the country&#x27;s claims in the Spratly Islands), while the rest were proposed to form Palawan Oriental. The proposed provincial capitals would be Taytay (Palawan del Norte), Brooke&#x27;s Point (Palawan del Sur), and Roxas (Palawan Oriental). The COMELEC held the plebiscite on March 13, 2021, and the majority of the votes rejected the division.

=== Currently proposed provinces in the 19th Congress ===
* Kutawato or Moro Province (2024): Senate Bill No. 2875 of Robin Padilla has proposed the conversion of the Special Geographic Area of the Bangsamoro autonomous region situated within Soccsksargen region&#x27;s Cotabato province in a separate province named &#x27;Kutawato&#x27;. Separately, Bangsamoro regional government has been planning to convert the SGA towns into a new province. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front which leads the regional government is already informally referring to the SGA as &#x27;Ligawasan Province&#x27;. The regional government has alternatively proposed that the subdivision be named &quot;Moro Province&quot; to avoid confusion with Cotabato province.
* Western Leyte (2005, 2010, 2024): During the 13th and the 15th Congress, Leyte 5th District Rep. Carmen L. Cari and her son and successor Rep. Jose Carlos L. Cari introduced bills seeking to carve the new province of Western Leyte out of the province of Leyte. The Caris&#x27; constituency consisted of the City of Baybay and the eight southernmost municipalities of the province. The bills died in the committee level. Previously, during the 9th Congress, Leyte 4th District Rep. Carmelo J. Locsin filed House Bill No. 6388 also to create the province of Western Leyte; his district consists of the City of Ormoc and the surrounding western municipalities of Albuera, Isabel, Kananga, Matag-ob, Merida, and Palompon. During the 19th congress, Leyte 4th District Rep. Richard Gomez revived the idea through House Bill 11077, seeking to establish Western Leyte as a new province. The proposed province would consist of Cebuano-speaking areas, including Ormoc City as its capital, Baybay City, and the municipalities of Leyte, Calubian, San Isidro, Tabango, Villaba, Albuera, Isabel, Kananga, Matag-ob, Merida, Palompon, Bato, Hilongos, Hindang, Inopacan, and Matalom. This would divide Leyte’s third and fourth congressional districts, covering approximately 3,000 square kilometers with a population nearing 1 million. Gomez cited the geographic division caused by the Leyte Central Highland Range and Mt. Pangasugan, which hinders access to essential services concentrated in Tacloban City on the eastern side of the island. He maintained that creating Western Leyte would address these logistical challenges and improve service delivery for the population on the western side.
* Surigao Oriental (1992, 2015, 2022): House Bill No. 2336 seeks to carve a province out of the six southernmost local government units of Surigao del Sur province. The City of Bislig and the municipalities of Barobo, Hinatuan, Lingig, and Tagbina all comprise the district of the bill&#x27;s author, Surigao del Sur 2nd District Representative Johnny T. Pimentel; the bill also seeks to transfer Lianga, currently part of the First District, to the proposed province. Bislig would be the designated capital. The bill is pending with the Committee on Local Government since August 2, 2022. A previous attempt to create the province of Surigao del Oriente, which would have covered the 2nd District municipalities but would have excluded Lianga, died in the committee level during the 16th Congress. The proposal to create a province called Surigao Oriental was raised as early as 1992 by then-2nd District Representative Ernesto T. Estrella. 
* Zamboanga Occidental (2002, 2007, 2010, 2017, 2023) On September 25, 2023, Zamboanga del Norte 3rd District Representative Adrian Michael A. Amatong filed House Bill No. 9311 seeking to create a new province out of his constituency. The proposed province would consist of the 12 westernmost municipalities of Zamboanga del Norte—Liloy as the proposed capital, together with Baliguian, Godod, Gutalac, Kalawit, Leon B. Postigo, Salug, Sibuco, Siocon, Sirawai, and Tampilisan. Previous attempts to turn the district into the province of Zamboanga Occidental, the province of Liloy, or the province of Zamboanga Hermosa—which began with the efforts of then-2nd District Representative Ernesto T. Estrella as early as 1992—failed to hurdle the 12th, the 14th, the 15th and the 17th Congress.

=== Other proposed provinces ===
* Mindoro del Sur (1998): During the 11th Congress, Oriental Mindoro 1st District Rep. Renato Leviste filed House Bill No. 1476 proposing to turn the adjoining 2nd District into its own province called Mindoro del Sur. The proposed province would have consisted of the seven municipalities forming the southern half of Oriental Mindoro: Bansud, Bongabong, Bulalacao, Gloria, Mansalay, Pinamalayan, and Roxas. However, the measure did not take off. The Sangguniang Panlalawigan in 2002 passed a resolution urging the province&#x27;s two representatives, Charity Leviste and Alfonso Umali, Jr., to refile the bill in the 12th Congress, but to no avail.
* Panguil Bay (1999): During the 11th Congress, Lanao del Norte 1st District Rep. Alipio Cirilo Badelles filed House Bill No. 8049 to carve the province of Panguil Bay out of Lanao del Norte. The bill died in the committee level.
* Bukidnon del Sur (2004): In November 2004, during the 13th Congress, Bukidnon 3rd District Rep. Juan Miguel F. Zubiri filed a bill seeking to carve the new province of Bukidnon del Sur out of the province of Bukidnon. The proposed province would have been composed of 10 southwestern and southern municipalities: Damulog, Dangcagan, Don Carlos, Kadingilan, Kalilangan, Kibawe, Kitaotao, Maramag, Pangantucan, and Quezon. The capital would have been determined by way of plebiscite had the bill passed into law. House Bill No. 4834 was unanimously approved on third reading by the House of Representatives on November 21, 2005, but it never moved past the committee level at the Senate. 
* Cebu del Norte, Cebu del Sur, and Occidental Cebu (2005): During the 13th Congress, the province of Cebu grappled with the so-called &quot;Sugbuak&quot; controversy. Three bills were filed in January and February 2005 by 2nd District Rep. Simeon L. Kintanar, 3rd District Rep. Antonio P. Yapha, Jr., and 4th District Clavel A. Martinez, who sought to turn their respective constituencies into the new provinces of Cebu del Sur, Occidental Cebu, and Cebu del Norte, respectively. The consolidated substitute bill, House Bill No. 5721, was approved by the Committee on Local Government but was not acted upon by the Committee on Rules by the end of the 13th Congress amid strong opposition. 
* Misamis North and Misamis South (2005): During the 13th Congress, Misamis Oriental 2nd District Rep. Augusto H. Baculio introduced two bills seeking to carve the provinces of Misamis North and Misamis South out of the province of Misamis Oriental. The bills died in the committee level.
* Northwestern Samar (2008, 2010, 2019) Most recently during the 17th Congress, House Bill No. 8824 was introduced in the House of Representatives on January 22, 2019, by 1st District Representative Edgar Mary Sarmiento to turn his constituency into a new province called Northwestern Samar. The proposed province would have consisted of the City of Calbayog as its capital, along with the nine municipalities of Almagro, Gandara, Matuginao, Pagsanghan, San Jorge, Santa Margarita, Santo Niño, Tagapul-an, and Tarangnan. This proposal has repeatedly died in the committee level during the 14th, 15th and 17th Congress.
* Nueva Camarines (2011) On May 24, 2011, during the 15th Congress, Camarines Sur Fourth District Rep. Arnulfo Fuentebella introduced House Bill 4728, which sought to create a new province out of the City of Iriga and 16 municipalities comprising the eastern half and the southern portion of Camarines Sur. This would have included all 10 municipalities of Fuentebella&#x27;s Fourth District (Caramoan, Garchitorena, Goa, Lagonoy, Presentacion, Sagñay, San Jose, Siruma, Tigaon, and Tinambac) and all six municipalities of the adjacent Fifth District (Baao, Balatan, Bato, Buhi, Bula, and Nabua). Tigaon would have been the capital of the proposed province. Just three months later, on August 3, 2011, the finalized measure numbered House Bill No. 4820 passed the House of Representatives of the Philippines with 229 votes in favor to one against. However, it failed to gain the concurrence of the Senate, which did not take up the controversial bill by the end of 15th Congress, following the opposition of Senators Joker Arroyo, Antonio Trillanes IV, Bongbong Marcos and Manny Villar. In 2015, Rappler reported: “It is widely believed here that the Fuentebellas want a new province they can rule because they had failed to win the governorship of Camarines Sur since former Governor Luis Villafuerte held the position.”

=== Proposed renaming ===
* Southern Leyte to Leyte del Sur (2007) Southern Leyte Lone District Rep. Roger Mercado introduced bills to rename the province of Southern Leyte to Leyte del Sur, citing a desire to “enhance the identity of [the province] as geographically a part of the Leyte Island with a distinct personality of its own” and to have the province alphabetically listed closer to the neighboring province of Leyte, from which it was separated in 1959. Mercado first filed the bill in 2007, and this attempt gained traction during the 14th Congress, as House Bill No. 6650 was passed by the House of Representatives on September 8, 2009, with 170 votes in its favor and none against it. The Senate, however, did not act on the measure. Mercado&#x27;s second attempt in 2017 did not prosper, as House Bill No. 1602 died in the committee level during the 17th Congress.

<doc id="165101" wikidata="Q807817" url="?curid=165101" title="Barbershop Harmony Society">
<text>The Barbershop Harmony Society, legally and historically named the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America, Inc. (SPEBSQSA), is the first of several organizations to promote and preserve barbershop music as an art form. Founded by Owen C. Cash and Rupert I. Hall in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1938, the organization quickly grew, promoting barbershop harmony among men of all ages. As of 2014, just under 23,000 men in the United States and Canada were members of this organization whose focus is on a cappella music. The international headquarters was in Kenosha, Wisconsin for fifty years before moving to Nashville, Tennessee in 2007. In June 2018, the society announced it would allow women to join as full members.

A parallel women&#x27;s singing organization, Sweet Adelines International (SAI) was founded in 1945. A second women&#x27;s barbershop harmony organization, Harmony, Incorporated, broke from SAI in 1959 over an issue of racial exclusion, with SAI (like SPEBSQSA and many other organizations) being white-only at that time; SPEBSQSA officially lifted the requirement in 1963. Several international affiliate organizations, in countries around the world, add their own flavor to the signature sound of barbershop harmony.

Since November 1941, the organization has published a bi-monthly magazine titled &quot;The Harmonizer&quot;.

==Name==

The original name SPEBSQSA was intended as a lampoon on Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal alphabet agencies. Because of the name&#x27;s length and the difficult-to-pronounce acronym, society staff and members often refer to SPEBSQSA as &quot;The Society&quot;. For decades, SPEBSQSA was &quot;the&quot; official name, while the &quot;Barbershop Harmony Society&quot; was an officially recognized and sanctioned alternate. Members were encouraged to use the alternate name, because it was felt that the official name was an in-joke that did not resonate outside the Society. In mid-2004, faced with declining membership, the Society adopted a marketing plan that called for using &quot;Barbershop Harmony Society&quot; consistently and retaining the old name for certain legal purposes.

The old official name spelled &quot;barber shop&quot; as two words, while &quot;barbershop&quot; is generally used elsewhere.

In reference to the acronym SPEBSQSA, The Society has said &quot;attempts to pronounce the name are discouraged&quot;. Unofficially, it is sometimes pronounced as if it were spelled &quot;Spebsqua&quot;.

&quot;Sharp Harmony&quot;, a Norman Rockwell painting, appeared on the cover of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; magazine issue dated September 26, 1936; it depicts a barber and three clients enjoying a cappella song. The image was adopted by SPEBSQSA in its promotion of the art.

In late 2004, the Society established Barbershop Harmony Society as its new &quot;brand name&quot;, with a logo and identity program released in 2005. The legal name remained SPEBSQSA, Inc.

==Preservation==
A key aspect of the Society&#x27;s mission is in the preservation of barbershop music. To this end, it maintains the Old Songs Library. Holding over 100,000 titles (750,000 sheets) this is the largest sheet music collection in the world excepting only the Library of Congress.

The &quot;Barberpole Cat Program&quot; is a collection of 12 songs (commonly known as &quot;polecats&quot;) that are considered standard repertoire for every barbershopper (&quot;Let Me Call You Sweetheart&quot;, &quot;My Wild Irish Rose&quot;, etc.) Every member receives a booklet upon joining the society. The purpose of this collection is so that whenever any barbershoppers meet they will always have something ready to sing. The society has also published collections such as &quot;Strictly Barbershop&quot;.

Harmony Foundation International, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization, was incorporated in 1959 as a charitable subsidiary of the Barbershop Harmony Society; it raises financial support for the society&#x27;s programs.

==Headquarters and membership==
In 2003, in preparation for a new headquarters location, the Society sold both Harmony Hall, a historic lakefront mansion in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and its nearby facility (known as Harmony Hall West) located in a strip mall which the Society purchased in 1976 and renovated. HHW had housed finance, merchandising, IT and membership. Operations and staff from both buildings were consolidated into a remodeled HHW.

In 2006 the Society announced plans to move its headquarters to Nashville, Tennessee. In August 2007, the Society completed the relocation to 110 Seventh Avenue North, in Nashville.

In June 2018, the society announced it would allow women to join as full members, with each chapter deciding whether to remain all-male or add a mixed or all-women&#x27;s chorus. Since 2009, women had been allowed to join as associates.

==Contests==
To promote and improve barbershop singing, the society annually runs international and district-level contests for choruses and quartets.

When a quartet wins the international gold medal, the foursome is considered champions forever and may not compete again. A chorus that wins the gold must sit out only for the next two competitions.

===International quartet champions===

===Chorus champions===
* The Vocal Majority, based in Dallas, Texas, thirteen-time International Chorus Champions (1975, 1979, 1982, 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2014, 2018) – the chorus with the most international gold medals, ten of which were in succession (each time the chorus was eligible to compete) until 2009.
* The Ambassadors of Harmony, based in St. Charles, Missouri, International Chorus Champions in 2004, 2009, 2012, 2016, and 2023. Their 2009 championship interrupted the Vocal Majority&#x27;s streak at 10 consecutive championships.
* The Masters of Harmony, nine-time International Chorus Champions (1990, 1993, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2011, 2017).
* The Westminster Chorus, initially a youth barbershop chorus in California started by young members of the Masters of Harmony, then expanded into a chorus with members of all ages; International Chorus Champions in 2007, 2010, 2015, 2019, and 2024.
* The Louisville Thoroughbreds Chorus, the society&#x27;s first 7-time International Chorus Champions, winning in 1962, 1966, 1969, 1974, 1978, 1981 and 1984.

===Awards===
In 2020, the society inaugurated an annual Awards Gala to &quot;amplify and celebrate&quot; those who have impacted the barbershop genre via excellence and service. Award nominations are accepted from January into February, selected nominees announced in April, and winners made known during the black tie gala held early in the week of the international contests. Awards are given for the Barbershopper, Quartet, Ensemble, Arranger, Innovator, Ambassador, Album, and Video of the Year, as well as Lifetime Achievement for an Arranger. Several pre-existent awards and honors are also now announced at the gala, including Hall of Fame, Honorary Membership, Harmony Fellows (50-year members) and the Joe Liles Lifetime Achievement Award (for a chorus director). With the inaugural year&#x27;s international convention canceled due to COVID-19, a virtual awards event was held on September 14, 2020.

====Hall of Fame====
Since 2004, the society&#x27;s Hall of Fame recognizes quartets and individual members who have made exceptional contributions to barbershop as a whole.



==Districts ==
For purposes of administration, particularly of local education and contests, the society is organized into 17 geographical districts as follows. (Chapter quantities are as of April 2024.)

There are currently two chapters (Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, New York and Loveland, Colorado) that are not part of any district.

<doc id="165102" wikidata="Q380438" url="?curid=165102" title="List of presidents of Venezuela">
<text>Under the Venezuelan Constitution, the president of Venezuela is the head of state and head of government of Venezuela. As chief of the executive branch and face of the government as a whole, the presidency is the highest political office in the country by influence and recognition. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela. The president is directly elected through a popular vote to a six-year term. Since the 2009 constitutional referendum, any person can be elected to the office an indefinite number of times. Upon the death, resignation, or removal from office of an incumbent president, the vice president assumes the office. The president must be at least 30 years of age, and has to be a &quot;natural born&quot; citizen of Venezuela, and cannot possess any other citizenship.

This list includes only those persons who were sworn into office as president following the establishment of the independent State of Venezuela, which took place on January 13, 1830. There have been 46 people sworn into office, and 64 presidencies, as several politicians (most prominently between 1830 and 1953) have held the office more than once. José Antonio Páez, the first president, was inaugurated in 1830. Antonio Guzmán Blanco served during the most terms, with three. Juan Vicente Gómez has served during the longest (although interrupted by interim presidencies), with over 27 years. Rómulo Betancourt served from 1959 until 1964. Hugo Chávez served the longest uninterrupted period in office with 11 consecutive years, from his restoration to power in April 2002 until his death in March 2013.

The presidency was disputed between Juan Guaidó and Nicolás Maduro from January 2019 to 2023 during the Venezuelan presidential crisis. Maduro was elected to his first term in 2013 but received backlash from opposing Venezuelans and some members of the international community especially the United States. Maduro was accused of authoritarian rule and fraud in the elections that were held on 20 May 2018. Guaidó, the president of the National Assembly of Venezuela, took the oath of office as interim president on 23 January 2019, citing Article 233 of the Constitution of Venezuela to &quot;cease the usurpation, hold a transitional government, and call for new elections&quot;. The office remained disputed until December 2022 when opposition parties voted to dissolve the Guaidó government effective as of 5 January 2023.

==History==
The presidential designation encompasses only those persons who were sworn into office as President of Venezuela following Venezuela&#x27;s declaration of independence from Spanish colonial rule, which took effect on July 5, 1811. The first president, taking office on July 5, 1811, was actually the president of a triumvirate of the first established Republic of Venezuela that rotated the presidency weekly. The person serving as president during the week of July 5 was one of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence: Cristóbal Mendoza. Mendoza shared the triumvirate with Juan Escalona and Baltasar Padrón. A second triumvirate followed on April 3, 1812, whose members were Francisco Espejo, and Francisco Javier Ustariz.

Owing to the profound confusion of the Venezuelan War of Independence and the period of Gran Colombia over what is now Venezuela, this page has gaps between 1813 and 1819. For this period in time, historians refer to the Republic of Venezuela as the Second Republic of Venezuela (1813–1814) and the Third Republic of Venezuela (1817–1819) as Simon Bolivar twice reestablished the republic. The Congress of Angostura appointed Simón Bolívar &quot;Supreme Commander of the Republic of Venezuela&quot; (Jefe Supremo de la República de Venezuela) from 1819 until 1830.

In 1830, José Antonio Páez declared Venezuela independent from Gran Colombia and became president, taking office on January 13, 1830. Although he was not the first president of Venezuela (having in mind Cristóbal Mendoza in 1811), he was the first head of state of independent Venezuela, after the dissolution of Gran Colombia.

==Presidents of Venezuela since independence (1830–present)==
The list below includes interim &quot;caretaker&quot; as well as regular serving presidents, and democratically installed presidents as well as those installed by other means (e.g.; Marcos Pérez Jiménez).

===State of Venezuela (1830–1864)===
===United States of Venezuela (1864–1953)===
=== Republic of Venezuela (1953–1999) ===
Venezuela took the name of Republic of Venezuela () with the adoption of the 1953 constitution, written by the Constituent Assembly elected in November 1952. The Presidents of Venezuela under this constitution (as well as the 1961 Constitution, which kept the name) were officially styled as President of the Republic of Venezuela.

This period of the history of Venezuela began with the dictatorship of Marcos Pérez Jiménez. After a short period of political instability following Pérez Jiménez&#x27;s exile in 1958, democracy was restored in the country with the election of Democratic Action leader Rómulo Betancourt as president in 1959. This marked the beginning of the democratic period, started with the Puntofijo Pact and which was characterized by the prevalence of the bipartidism of the two main political parties in the country at the time, Democratic Action and Copei.

The second presidency of Carlos Andrés Pérez (1989–93) saw a deep economic crisis, a series of major riots known as the Caracazo in 1989, in which hundreds were killed by security forces, two coup attempts in 1992, and the 1993 impeachment of Pérez. That same year, Rafael Caldera became the first President of Venezuela not to belong to either Democratic Action or Copei in over forty years, having been elected under the banner of National Convergence. The bipartidism ended in 2000 when a new constitution entered in force.

=== Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (1999–present) ===

Venezuela became the &quot;Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela&quot; () with the adoption of the 1999 constitution, which renamed the country in honor of Simón Bolívar. The new constitution was promulgated by President Hugo Chávez, who served &quot;de jure&quot; from 1999 until his death in 2013. The new constitution augmented the presidential term from five years to six years.

Chávez&#x27;s presidency was interrupted shortly in 2002 following a failed coup d&#x27;état attempt that put Pedro Carmona in office for a day. After government-loyal forces ousted Carmona from Miraflores, Vice President Diosdado Cabello assumed executive control for a couple of hours until Chávez could be restored. In 2009, a constitutional referendum approved the elimination of term limits, which allowed Chávez to be re-elected again in 2012. However, Chávez died in March 2013, only three months into his fourth term, and was succeeded by his Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who was elected the following month to finish Chávez&#x27;s term, enforcing the majority of Chávez&#x27;s economic policies.

Under Maduro, Venezuela has seen a rise in unemployment, shortages of goods, closures of several corporations, and the deterioration of productivity. Maduro – who has seen a sharp decline in his approval ratings in correlation to the economic collapse, and was the subject of a 2016 recall referendum to remove him from office that was later suspended – has been criticized for what opponents consider to be him backsliding the country towards a full-fledged authoritarian regime; this led to an ongoing constitutional crisis stemming from a March 2017 ruling by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice (whose members largely consist of Maduro supporters) that removed immunity for National Assembly members (including those opposing Maduro), which subsequently made a brief assumption of legislative powers from the Assembly, and the Constituent Assembly election, which resulted in the formation of a Constituent Assembly intended to rewrite the 1999 constitution. These actions have worsened tensions and sparked violence during protests against the Maduro administration over concerns that Maduro would eliminate or significantly erode the independence of Venezuela&#x27;s democratic institutions and shift the country towards one-man rule.

The process and results of the May 2018 Venezuelan presidential election were widely disputed. The opposition-majority National Assembly declared Maduro a &quot;usurper&quot; of the presidency on the day of his second inauguration and disclosed a plan to set forth its president, Juan Guaidó as the succeeding acting President of the country under article 233 of the Venezuelan Constitution. A week later, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice declared that the presidency of the National Assembly was the &quot;usurper&quot; of authority and declared the body to be unconstitutional.

Minutes after Maduro took the oath as President of Venezuela, the Organization of American States (OAS) approved a resolution in a special session of its Permanent Council declaring Maduro&#x27;s presidency illegitimate and urging new elections. Special meetings of the OAS on 24 January and in the United Nations Security Council on 26 January were held but no consensus was reached. Secretary-General of the United Nations António Guterres called for dialogue. During the 49th General Assembly of the Organization of American States, on 27 June, Guaidó&#x27;s presidency was recognized by the organization.

Guaidó was declared acting president and swore himself in on 23 January. Maduro&#x27;s government has accused the United States of organizing a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; to remove him and take control of the country&#x27;s oil reserves. Guaidó rejects the characterization of his actions as a coup, saying that his movement is backed by peaceful volunteers. As of June 2019, Guaidó has been recognized as the acting President of Venezuela by 54 countries. Internationally, support has followed traditional geopolitical lines, with allies China, Cuba, Iran, Russia, Syria, and Turkey supporting Maduro; and the US, Canada, and most of Western Europe supporting Guaidó as acting president. The United Nations has continued to recognize the Maduro presidency as the legal representative of Venezuela as of December 2019.

On 22 December 2022, the Venezuelan opposition held an initial vote to remove Guaidó&#x27;s interim government from its leadership and on 30 December 2022, three of the four main opposition political parties (Justice First, Democratic Action and A New Era) approved a reform to dissolve the interim government and instead create a commission of five members to manage foreign assets, stating the failure of the interim government to achieve the goals it had set. The amendment was voted by the opposition as deputies sought a united strategy ahead of the presidential elections scheduled for 2024 with the reform approved with 72 votes in favor, 29 against and 8 abstentions, this dissolving the Guaidó government effective as of 5 January 2023.

<text>Desk Set (released as His Other Woman in the UK) is a 1957 American romantic comedy film starring Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. Directed by Walter Lang, the picture&#x27;s screenplay was written by Phoebe Ephron and Henry Ephron, adapted from the 1955 play of the same name by William Marchant.

==Plot==
Bunny Watson is a documentalist in charge of the reference library at the Federal Broadcasting Network in Midtown Manhattan. The reference librarians are responsible for researching facts and answering questions for the general public on all manner of topics, great and small. Bunny has been romantically involved for seven years with rising network executive Mike Cutler, but with no marriage in sight.

Methods engineer and efficiency expert Richard Sumner is the inventor of EMERAC (&quot;Electromagnetic MEmory and Research Arithmetical Calculator&quot;), nicknamed &quot;Emmy,&quot; a powerful early generation computer (referred to then as an &quot;electronic brain&quot;). He is brought in to see how the library functions, and size it up for installation of one of his massive machines.

Despite Bunny&#x27;s initial intransigence, Richard is surprised and intrigued to discover how stunningly capable and engaging she is. When her staff finds out the computer is coming, they jump to the conclusion they are being replaced.

After an innocuous but seemingly salacious situation that Mike walks in on at Bunny&#x27;s apartment, he recognizes the older Richard has emerged as a romantic rival, and begins to want to commit to Bunny.

Bunny&#x27;s fear of unemployment seems confirmed when she and everyone on her staff receive a pink &quot;layoff&quot; slip printed out by a similar new EMERAC already installed in payroll. But it turns out to have been a mistake – the machine fired everybody in the company, including the president. The network has kept everything hush-hush to avoid tipping off competitors that a merger was in the works. Rather than replace the research staff, &quot;Emmy&quot; was installed to help the employees cope with the extra work.

With the threat of displacement out of the way, Richard reveals his romantic interest to Bunny, but she believes that EMERAC will always be his first love. He denies it, but then Bunny puts him to the test, pressing the machine beyond its limits. Richard resists the urge to fix it as long as possible, but finally gives in and forces an emergency shutdown. Bunny then accepts his marriage proposal.

==Production==
In the play, Bunny Watson (played by Shirley Booth, who was originally intended for the film as well) had only brief, somewhat hostile interactions with Richard Sumner. Screenwriters Phoebe and Henry Ephron (the parents of Nora Ephron) built up the role of the efficiency expert and tailored the interactions between him and the researcher to fit Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn.

The exterior shots of the &quot;Federal Broadcasting Network&quot; seen in the film are actually of the RCA Building (now known as the Comcast Building) at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in Rockefeller Center, the headquarters of NBC.

The character of Bunny Watson was based on Agnes E. Law, a real-life librarian at CBS who retired about a year before the film was released.

This film was the eighth screen pairing of Hepburn and Tracy, after a five-year respite since 1952&#x27;s &quot;Pat and Mike,&quot; and was a first for Hepburn and Tracy in several ways: the first non-MGM film the two starred in together, their first color film, and their first CinemaScope film. Following &quot;Desk Set&quot; their last film together would be 1967&#x27;s &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot;.

The computer referred to as EMERAC is a metonym for ENIAC (&quot;Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer&quot;), which was developed in the 1940s and was the first electronic general-purpose computer. Parts of the EMERAC computer, particularly the massive display of moving square lights, would later be seen in various 20th Century Fox productions including both the motion picture (1961) and TV (1964–1968) versions of &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; and the Edgar Hopper segment of the 1964 film &quot;What a Way to Go!&quot;.

The researchers furnish incorrect information about the career of baseball player Ty Cobb. Miss Costello claims his major league career lasted for 21 years, and that he played only for the Detroit Tigers. In fact, he played for 24 years—22 with Detroit, and his final two seasons with the Philadelphia Athletics.

There is a well-known &quot;goof&quot; in one scene. Mike gives Bunny an arrangement of white carnations, and she inserts one in his lapel&#x27;s button-hole. At the end of the day, she and Richard leave the office. She is carrying the white carnation arrangement as they enter the elevator. As they exit the building, the carnations are pink.

==Reception==
Bosley Crowther, film critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, felt the film was &quot;out of dramatic kilter&quot;, inasmuch as Hepburn was simply too &quot;formidable&quot; to convincingly play someone &quot;scared by a machine&quot;, resulting in &quot;not much tension in this thoroughly lighthearted film&quot;.

The &quot;New York Post&quot; review was mixed: &quot;There are such sops to sentiment as Miss Hepburn&#x27;s willingness to be dragged altarwards by the young head of her department, Gig Young, who kindly lets her do her most impressive work, and a growing understanding between Hepburn and the rather remote and intellectually Olympian Tracy...Running true to form, the sex narrative follows a predictable pattern, rewarding honest virtue and slapping down the unworthy, and the other, scientific trail is permitted a twist that may surprise any who have found themselves emotionally involved in that timely problem of technological unemployment...&#x27;Desk Set,&#x27; let us conclude, is a shining piece of machinery brought to a high polish, and, delivered with appropriate performances, flourishes. Affection, though, it cannot inspire.&quot;

&quot;TIME&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;At long last, somebody has a kind word for the girls in the research department. The word: one of those electronic brains could do the job much better and with less back chat—and what&#x27;s more, it would free the girls&#x27; energies for the more important job of getting a man...Desk Set has been expanded [from the play] by a sizable pigeonhole, in which [Hepburn and Tracy] intermittently bill and coo...On the whole, the film compares favorably with the play...And though Actress Hepburn tends to wallow in the wake of Shirley Booth...she never quite sinks in the comic scenes, and in the romantic ones she is light enough to ride the champagne splashes of emotion as if she were going over Niagara in a barrel. Spencer Tracy has one wonderful slapstick scene, and Gig Young does very well with a comic style for which he is much beholden to William Holden.&quot;

The &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; was critical: &quot;The middle-aged excesses of Miss Hepburn and Tracy...leave a good deal to be desired. Equipped with an insubstantial vehicle, bogged down by surprisingly flat-footed direction...the stars come close to being embarrassing as they bound through roles involving them in office nonsense about a mechanical brain, a bibulous Christmas party, an innocent, but suspecting, dinner in negligee Katie&#x27;s rain-bound flat...Marchant&#x27;s foolish little comedy gains nothing via the Phoebe and Henry Ephron adaptation. Long recitations from &quot;Hiawatha&quot; and &quot;The Curfew Shall Not Ring Tonight,&quot; plus question-and-answer games...in addition to the repetitiousness of the central idea...turn &#x27;Desk Set&#x27;s&#x27; 104 minutes into an endurance contest for cast and audience.&quot;

Today the film is seen far more favorably, with the sharpness of the script praised in particular. It has achieved a rare 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 22 reviews, with a weighted average of 6.78/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Desk Set&quot; reunites one of cinema&#x27;s most well-loved pairings for a solidly crafted romantic comedy that charmingly encapsulates their timeless appeal&quot;. Dennis Schwartz of Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews called it an &quot;inconsequential sex comedy,&quot; but contended &quot;the star performers are better than the material they are given to work with&quot; and that &quot;the comedy was so cheerful and the banter between the two was so refreshingly smart that it was easy to forgive this bauble for not being as rich as many of the legendary duo&#x27;s other films together.&quot;

A Canadian radio program, &quot;Bunny Watson&quot;, was named for and inspired by Hepburn&#x27;s character.

<text>Columbia Records is an American record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment, a subsidiary of Sony Music Group, the American division of multinational conglomerate Sony. Columbia is the oldest surviving brand name in the recorded sound business, and the second major company to produce records. From 1961 to 1991, its recordings were released outside North America under the name CBS Records to avoid confusion with EMI&#x27;s Columbia Graphophone Company. Columbia is one of Sony Music&#x27;s four flagship record labels: Epic Records, and former longtime rivals, RCA Records and Arista Records as the latter two were originally owned by BMG before its 2008 relaunch after Sony&#x27;s acquisition alongside other BMG labels.

== History ==
=== Beginnings (1888–1929) ===

The Columbia Phonograph Company was founded on January 15, 1889, by stenographer, lawyer, and New Jersey native Edward D. Easton (1856–1915) and a group of investors. It derived its name from the District of Columbia, where it was headquartered. At first it had a local monopoly on sales and service of Edison phonographs and phonograph cylinders in Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Delaware. As was the custom of some of the regional phonograph companies, Columbia produced many commercial cylinder recordings of its own, and its catalog of musical records in 1891 was 10 pages.

Columbia&#x27;s ties to Edison were severed in 1894 with the North American Phonograph Company&#x27;s breakup. Thereafter, it sold only records and phonographs of its own manufacture. In 1902, Columbia introduced the &quot;XP&quot; record, a molded brown wax record, to use up old stock. Columbia introduced black wax records in 1903. According to one source, they continued to mold brown waxes until 1904 with the highest number being 32601, &quot;Heinie&quot;, which is a duet by Arthur Collins and Byron G. Harlan. The molded brown waxes may have been sold to Sears for distribution (possibly under Sears&#x27; Oxford trademark for Columbia products).

Columbia began selling disc records, invented and patented by Victor Talking Machine Company&#x27;s Emile Berliner, and phonographs in addition to the cylinder system in 1901, preceded only by their &quot;Toy Graphophone&quot; of 1899, which used small, vertically cut records. For a decade, Columbia competed with both the Edison Phonograph Company cylinders and Victor Talking Machine Company disc records as one of the top three names in American sound recording.

In 1903, to add prestige to its early catalog of artists, Columbia contracted several prominent singers from the Metropolitan Opera in New York to make a highly touted series of Grand Opera Records. These stars included Marcella Sembrich, Lillian Nordica, Antonio Scotti, and Edouard de Reszke, but the technical standard of Columbia&#x27;s Grand Opera series was not considered to be as high as the results achieved with opera singers during the pre–World War I period by Victor, Edison, England&#x27;s His Master&#x27;s Voice (The Gramophone Company Ltd.) or Italy&#x27;s Fonotipia Records. After an abortive attempt in 1904 to manufacture discs with the recording grooves stamped into both sides of each disc—not just one—in 1908 Columbia commenced successful mass production of what they called their &quot;Double-Faced&quot; discs, the 10-inch variety initially selling for 65 cents each. Columbia also introduced the internal-horn &quot;Grafonola&quot; to compete with the extremely popular &quot;Victrola&quot; introduced by the rival Victor Talking Machine Company in 1906.

During this era, Columbia began to use the &quot;Magic Notes&quot; logo—a pair of sixteenth notes (semiquavers) in a circle—both in the United States and overseas (where this particular logo would never substantially change).

In 1908, Columbia ceased the recording and manufacturing of wax cylinder records after arranging to issue celluloid cylinder records made by the Indestructible Record Company of Albany, New York, as &quot;Columbia Indestructible Records&quot;. In July 1912, Columbia decided to concentrate exclusively on disc records and ended production of cylinder phonographs, although Indestructible cylinders continued to be sold under the Columbia label for a few more years.

Columbia was split into two companies, one to make records and one to make players. Columbia Phonograph relocated to Bridgeport, Connecticut, and Edward Easton went with it. Eventually it was renamed the Dictaphone Corporation.

=== Columbia Phonograph Company ownership (1925–1931) ===

In late 1922, Columbia entered receivership.

The company was bought by its UK subsidiary, the Columbia Graphophone Company, in 1925 and the label, record numbering system, and recording process changed. On February 25, 1925, Columbia began recording with the electric recording process licensed from Western Electric. &quot;Viva-tonal&quot; records set a benchmark in tone and clarity unequaled on commercial discs during the 78-rpm era. The first electrical recordings were made by Art Gillham, the &quot;Whispering Pianist&quot;. In a secret agreement with Victor, electrical technology was kept secret to avoid hurting sales of acoustic records.

Louis Sterling, managing director of the Columbia Graphophone Company, had been the moving force behind bringing Western Electric&#x27;s recording process, and the British takeover. Originally from New York, Sterling became Chairman of Columbia NY from 1925 until 1931, and oversaw stability and success. 

In 1926, Columbia acquired Okeh Records and its growing stable of jazz and blues artists, including Louis Armstrong and Clarence Williams. Columbia had already built a catalog of blues and jazz artists, including Bessie Smith in their 14000-D Race series. Columbia also had a successful &quot;Hillbilly&quot; series (15000-D) with Dan Hornsby among others. By 1927, the &quot;Sweet Jazz&quot; bandleader Guy Lombardo also joined Columbia and recorded forty five 78 rpm&#x27;s by 1931. In 1928, Paul Whiteman, the nation&#x27;s most popular orchestra leader, left Victor to record for Columbia. During the same year, Columbia executive Frank Buckley Walker pioneered some of the first country music or &quot;hillbilly&quot; genre recordings with the Johnson City sessions in Tennessee, including artists such as Clarence Horton Greene and &quot;Fiddlin&#x27;&quot; Charlie Bowman. He followed that with a return to Tennessee the next year, and recording sessions in other cities of the South. Moran and Mack as The Two Black Crows 1926 recording &#x27;The Early Bird Catches the Worm&#x27; sold 2.5 million copies.

In 1929, Ben Selvin became house bandleader and A. &amp; R. director. Other favorites in the Viva-tonal era included Ruth Etting, Paul Whiteman, Fletcher Henderson, Ipana Troubadours (a Sam Lanin group), and Ted Lewis. Columbia used acoustic recording for &quot;budget label&quot; pop product well into 1929 on the labels Harmony, Velvet Tone (both general purpose labels), and Diva (sold exclusively at W.T. Grant stores). When Edison Records folded, Columbia was the oldest surviving record label.

=== Columbia ownership separation (1931–1936) ===

The repercussions of the stock market Crash of 1929 and subsequent Great Depression led to the near collapse of the entire recording industry and, in March 1931, J.P Morgan, the major shareholder, steered the Columbia Graphophone Company (along with Odeon records and Parlophone, which it had owned since 1926) into a merger with the Gramophone Company (&quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot;) to form Electric and Musical Industries Ltd (EMI). Since the Gramophone Company (HMV) was now a wholly owned subsidiary of Victor, and Columbia in America was a subsidiary of UK Columbia, Victor now technically owned its largest rival in the US. To avoid antitrust legislation, EMI had to sell off its US Columbia operation, which continued to release pressings of matrices made in the UK.

In December, 1931, the U.S. Columbia Phonograph Company, Inc. was acquired by the Grigsby-Grunow Company, the manufacturers of Majestic radios and refrigerators. When Grigsby-Grunow declared bankruptcy in November 1933, Columbia was placed in receivership, and in June 1934, the company was sold to Sacro Enterprises Inc. (&quot;Sacro&quot;) for $70,000. Sacro was incorporated a few days before the sale in New York. Public documents do not contain any names. Many suspect that it was a shell corporation set up by Consolidated Films Industries, Inc. (&quot;CFI&quot;) to hold the Columbia stock, while its subsidiary, American Record Corporation (&quot;ARC&quot;), operated the label. This assumption grew out of the ease which CFI later exhibited in selling Columbia in 1938.

On December 3, 1931, CFI made a deal with Warner Brothers Pictures, Inc. (&quot;WB&quot;) to lease Brunswick Record Corporation, which included the trademarks and masters of the Brunswick, Vocalion, and Melotone labels to ARC. WB would receive a portion of the sales of its catalogues, while ARC was free to use the labels for new recordings. Brunswick immediately became the premium $.75 label, Melotone would release new hillbilly and other $.35 dime-store discounted discs, and Vocalion, while re-releasing prior ARC records, would also be the blues-R&amp;B label, and the exclusive outlet for Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys, a mid-1930s Western Swing band which drew 10,000+ customers nightly to dance. Columbia was added in mid-1932, relegated to slower sellers such as the Hawaiian music of Andy Iona, the Irving Mills stable of artists and songs, and the still unknown Benny Goodman. It tried a marketing ploy, the Columbia &quot;Royal Blue Record&quot;, a blue laminated product with matching label. Royal Blue issues, made from late 1932 through 1935, are particularly popular with collectors for their rarity and musical interest. The Columbia plant in Oakland, California, did Columbia&#x27;s pressings for sale west of the Rockies and continued using the Royal Blue material for these until about mid-1936.

As southern gospel developed, Columbia had astutely sought to record the artists associated with the emerging genre; for example, Columbia was the only company to record Charles Davis Tillman. Most fortuitously for Columbia in its Depression Era financial woes, in 1936 the company entered into an exclusive recording contract with the Chuck Wagon Gang, a hugely successful relationship which continued into the 1970s. A signature group of southern gospel, the Chuck Wagon Gang became Columbia&#x27;s bestsellers with at least 37 million records, many of them through the aegis of the &quot;Mull Singing Convention of the Air&quot; sponsored on radio (and later television) by southern gospel broadcaster J. Bazzel Mull (1914–2006).

In 1935, Herbert M. Greenspon, an 18-year-old shipping clerk, led a committee to organize the first trade union shop at the main manufacturing factory in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Elected as president of the Congress of Industrial Unions (CIO) local, Greenspon negotiated the first contract between factory workers and Columbia management. In a career with Columbia that lasted 30 years, Greenspon retired after achieving the position of executive vice president of the company. Columbia also hired talent scout, music writer, producer, and impresario John Hammond in 1937. Alongside his significance as a discoverer, promoter, and producer of jazz, blues, and folk artists during the swing music era, Hammond had already been of great help to Columbia in 1932–33. Through his involvement in the UK music paper &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Hammond had arranged for the struggling US Columbia label to provide recordings for the UK Columbia label, mostly using the specially created Columbia W-265000 matrix series. Hammond recorded Fletcher Henderson, Benny Carter, Joe Venuti, Roger Wolfe Kahn and other jazz performers during a time when the economy was bad enough that many of them would not have had the opportunity to enter a studio and play real jazz (a handful of these in this special series were issued in the US). Hammond&#x27;s work for Columbia was interrupted by his service during World War II, and he had less involvement with the music scene during the bebop era, but when he returned to work as a talent scout for Columbia in the 1950s, his career proved to be of incalculable historical and cultural importance – the list of superstar artists he would discover and sign to Columbia over the course of his career included Charlie Christian, Count Basie, Teddy Wilson, Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Aretha Franklin, Bruce Springsteen and Stevie Ray Vaughan, and in the early 1960s Hammond would also exert an enormous cultural effect on the emerging rock music scene thanks to his championing of reissue LPs of the music of blues artists Robert Johnson and Bessie Smith.

By 1937–38, the record business in America was finally recovering from the near-death blow of the Great Depression, at least for RCA Victor and Decca, but privately, there were doubts about the survival of ARC. In a 1941 court case brought by unhappy shareholders of Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. (&quot;CBS&quot;), Edward Wallerstein, a high executive with RCA Victor from 1932 thru 1938, was asked to comment on ARC. &quot;The chief value was that the record industry had come back tremendously, especially in the case of two other record companies; and the American Record Company, with all its facilities, had not, so far as I could learn, increased its business in any degree at all in the previous six years.&quot;

=== CBS takes over (1938–1947) ===

On December 17, 1938, the ARC, including the Columbia label in the U.S., was acquired by William S. Paley of the Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. for US$700,000, ten times the price ARC paid in 1934, which would later spark lawsuits by disgruntled shareholders. (Columbia Records had originally co-founded CBS in 1927 along with New York talent agent Arthur Judson, but soon cashed out of the partnership leaving only the name; Paley acquired the fledgling radio network in 1928.) On January 3, 1939, Wallerstein left RCA Victor to become president of the CBS phonograph subsidiary, a position he would hold for twelve years. CBS kept the ARC name for three months. then on April 4, it amended the New York Department of State record of &quot;Columbia Phonograph Company, Inc.,&quot; naming several of its own employees to directorships, and announced in a press release, &quot;The American Record Co. tag is discarded&quot;. Columbia Records was actually reborn on May 22, 1939, as &quot;Columbia Recording Corporation, Inc.&quot;, a Delaware corporation. The NYDOS shows a later incorporation date of April 4, 1947. This corporation changed its name to Columbia Records, Inc. on October 11, 1954, and reverted to Columbia Recording Corporation on January 2, 1962. The Columbia trademark remained under Columbia Records, Inc. of Delaware, filed back in 1929. Brothers Ike and Leon Levy owned stakes in CBS.

In February 1939, NYC Studios moved from ARC headquarters at 1776 Broadway, to 799 7th Avenue, 6th&amp;7th flrs, New York City (&quot;Studio A&quot;). Corporate offices, studio and Pressing Plant would also continue at 1473 Barnum Avenue, Bridgeport, CT. John Hammond was hired by Wallerstein as &quot;Associate Director Popular Recording&quot; (at 7th Ave). Another executive from ARC, Art Satherley, was not expected to transition over as easily. &quot;It is understood that CBS and the Levys are not interested in retaining American Record&#x27;s hillbilly department, and that Art Satherly, who has been running this section for many years, will take it out of the company with him&quot;. Fortunately, to the delight of many, this did not happen, and Art went on to many more successful years supervising all aspects of Columbia&#x27;s Hillbilly/Country artists and sessions.

On August 30, 1939, Columbia replaced its $.75 Brunswick record for a $.50 Columbia label. Brunswick was gradually phased out, the final issue being Brunswick 8520, in April 1940. Wallerstein and Paley knew in advance that their course of action would lead to violation of the 1931 Brunswick lease agreement, so they discontinued Vocalion in June 1940, and fired up Okeh. By July, it was releasing new Hillbilly platters by Gene Autry and Bob Wills, and re-issuing past Vocalion discs, using the same catalogue numbers with a leading zero added. When a January 1941 audit found that not more than 150,000 Brunswick records had sold during the period from December 1, 1939, through December 31, 1940, control of the loaned trademarks and catalog of master recordings made prior to December 3, 1931, reverted to Warner Bros. Pictures.

The Columbia trademark from this point until the late 1950s was two overlapping circles with the Magic Notes in the left circle and a CBS microphone in the right circle. The Royal Blue labels were dropped in favor of a deep red, which caused RCA Victor to claim infringement on its famous Red Seal trademark (RCA lost the case). The blue Columbia label was retained for its classical music Columbia Masterworks Records series until it was later changed to a green label before switching to a gray label in the late 1950s, and then to the bronze that is familiar to owners of Columbia/CBS classical and Broadway albums. Columbia Phonograph Company of Canada did not survive the Great Depression, so CBS made a distribution deal with Sparton Records in 1939 to release Columbia records in Canada under the Columbia name.

During the 1940s, Frank Sinatra recorded for Columbia and helped to substantially boost the company&#x27;s revenue. Sinatra recorded over 200 songs for Columbia which include his most popular songs from his early years. Other popular artists on Columbia at this time included Benny Goodman (signed from RCA Victor in 1939), Count Basie, Jimmie Lunceford (both signed from Decca), Eddy Duchin, Ray Noble (both moved to Columbia from Brunswick), Kate Smith, Mildred Bailey, and Will Bradley.

In 1947, the company was renamed Columbia Records Inc. and founded its Mexican record company, Discos Columbia de Mexico. 1948 saw the first classical LP Nathan Milstein&#x27;s recording of the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto. Columbia&#x27;s new 33 rpm format quickly spelled the death of the classical 78 rpm record and for the first time in nearly fifty years, gave Columbia a commanding lead over RCA Victor Red Seal.

=== The LP record (1948–1959) ===
Columbia&#x27;s president Edward Wallerstein was instrumental in steering Paley towards the ARC purchase. He set his talents to his goal of hearing an entire movement of a symphony on one side of an album. Ward Botsford writing for the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Issue of &quot;High Fidelity Magazine&quot; relates: &quot;He was no inventor—he was simply a man who seized an idea whose time was ripe and begged, ordered, and cajoled a thousand men into bringing into being the now accepted medium of the record business.&quot; Despite Wallerstein&#x27;s stormy tenure, in June 1948, Columbia introduced the Long Playing &quot;microgroove&quot; LP record format (sometimes written &quot;Lp&quot; in early advertisements), which rotated at 33⅓ revolutions per minute, to be the standard for the gramophone record for forty years. CBS research director Dr. Peter Goldmark played a managerial role in the collaborative effort, but Wallerstein credits engineer William Savory with the technical prowess that brought the long-playing disc to the public.

By the early 1940s, Columbia had been experimenting with higher fidelity recordings, and longer masters, which paved the way for the successful release of the LPs in 1948. One such record that helped set a new standard for music listeners was the 10&quot; LP reissue of &quot;The Voice of Frank Sinatra&quot;, originally released on March 4, 1946, as an album of four 78 rpm records, which was the first pop album issued in the new LP format. Sinatra was arguably Columbia&#x27;s hottest commodity and his artistic vision combined with the direction Columbia were taking the medium of music, both popular and classic, were well suited. &quot;The Voice of Frank Sinatra&quot; was also considered to be the first genuine &quot;concept album&quot;. Since the term &quot;LP&quot; has come to refer to the 12-inch rpm vinyl disk, the first LP is the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto in E minor played by Nathan Milstein with Bruno Walter conducting the New York Philharmonic (then called the Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra of New York), Columbia ML 4001, found in the Columbia Record Catalog for 1949, published in July 1948. The other &quot;LP&#x27;s&quot; listed in the catalog were in the 10 inch format starting with ML 2001 for the light classics, CL 6001 for popular songs and JL 8001 for children&#x27;s records. The Library of Congress in Washington DC now holds the Columbia Records Paperwork Archive which shows the Label order for ML 4001 being written on March 1, 1948. One can infer that Columbia was pressing the first LPs for distribution to their dealers for at least 3 months prior to the introduction of the LP on June 21, 1948. The catalog numbering system has had minor changes ever since.

Columbia&#x27;s LPs were particularly well-suited to classical music&#x27;s longer pieces, so some of the early albums featured such artists as Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra, Bruno Walter and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, and Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. The success of these recordings persuaded Capitol Records to begin releasing LPs in 1949. Even before the LP record was officially demonstrated, Columbia offered to share the new speed with rival RCA Victor, who initially rejected it and soon introduced their new competitive 45 RPM record. When it became clear that the LP was the preferred format for classical recordings, RCA Victor announced that the company would begin releasing its own LPs in January 1950. This was quickly followed by the other major American labels. Decca Records in the U.K. was the first to release LPs in Europe, beginning in 1949. EMI would not fully adopt the LP format until 1955.

An &quot;original cast recording&quot; of Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;South Pacific&quot; with Ezio Pinza and Mary Martin was recorded in 1949. Both conventional metal masters and tape were used in the sessions in New York City. For some reason, the taped version was not used until Sony released it as part of a set of CDs devoted to Columbia&#x27;s Broadway albums. Over the years, Columbia joined Decca and RCA Victor in specializing in albums devoted to Broadway musicals with members of the original casts. In the 1950s, Columbia also began releasing LPs drawn from the soundtracks of popular films.

Many album covers put together by Columbia and the other major labels were put together using one piece of cardboard (folded in half) and two paper &quot;slicks&quot;, one for the front and one for the back. The front slick bent around the top, bottom, and left sides (the right side is open for the record to be inserted into the cover) and glued the two halves of cardboard together at the top and bottom. The back slick is pasted over the edges of the pasted-on front slick to make it appear that the album cover is one continuous piece.

Columbia discovered that printing two front cover slicks, one for mono and one for stereo, was inefficient and therefore needlessly costly. Starting in the summer of 1959 with some of the albums released in August, they went to the &quot;paste-over&quot; front slick, which had the stereo information printed on the top and the mono information printed on the bottom. For stereo issues, they moved the front slick down so the stereo information was showing at the top, and the mono information was bent around the bottom to the back and &quot;pasted over&quot; by the back slick. Conversely, for a mono album, they moved the slick up so the mono information showed at the bottom, and the stereo information was pasted over. Soon, other record companies had adopted the paste-over method.

===1950s ===
In 1951, Columbia US began issuing records in the 45 rpm format RCA Victor had introduced two years earlier. The same year, Ted Wallerstein retired as Columbia Records chairman; and Columbia US also severed its decades-long distribution arrangement with EMI and signed a distribution deal with Philips Records to market Columbia recordings outside North America. EMI continued to distribute Okeh and later Epic label recordings until 1968. EMI also continued to distribute Columbia recordings in Australia and New Zealand. American Columbia was not happy with EMI&#x27;s reluctance to introduce long playing records.

Columbia became the most successful non-rock record company in the 1950s after it lured producer and bandleader Mitch Miller away from the Mercury label in 1950. Despite its many successes, Columbia remained largely uninvolved in the teenage rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll market until the mid-1960s, despite a handful of crossover hits, largely because of Miller&#x27;s frequently expressed loathing of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll. (Miller was a classically trained oboist who had been a friend of Columbia executive Goddard Lieberson since their days at the Eastman School of Music in the 1930s.) Miller quickly signed up Mercury&#x27;s biggest artist at the time, Frankie Laine, and discovered several of the decade&#x27;s biggest recording stars including Tony Bennett, Mahalia Jackson, Jimmy Boyd, Guy Mitchell (whose stage surname was taken from Miller&#x27;s first name), Johnnie Ray, The Four Lads, Rosemary Clooney, Kay Lande, Ray Conniff, Jerry Vale and Johnny Mathis. He also oversaw many of the early singles by the label&#x27;s top female recording star of the decade, Doris Day.

In 1953, Columbia formed a new subsidiary label Epic Records. 1954 saw Columbia end its distribution arrangement with Sparton Records and form Columbia Records of Canada. To enhance its country music stable, which already included Marty Robbins, Ray Price and Carl Smith, Columbia bid $15,000 for Elvis Presley&#x27;s contract from Sun Records in 1955. Presley&#x27;s manager, Colonel Tom Parker, turned down their offer and signed Presley with RCA Victor. However, Columbia did sign two Sun artists in 1958: Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins.

With 1954, Columbia U.S. decisively broke with its past when it introduced its new, modernist-style &quot;Walking Eye&quot; logo, designed by Columbia&#x27;s art director S. Neil Fujita. This logo actually depicts a stylus (the legs) on a record (the eye); however, the &quot;eye&quot; also subtly refers to CBS&#x27;s main business in television, and that division&#x27;s iconic Eye logo. Columbia continued to use the &quot;notes and mike&quot; logo on record labels and even used a promo label showing both logos until the &quot;notes and mike&quot; was phased out (along with the 78 in the US) in 1958. In Canada, Columbia 78s were pressed with the &quot;Walking Eye&quot; logo in 1958. The original Walking Eye was tall and solid; it was modified in 1961 to the familiar one still used today (pictured on this page), despite the fact that the Walking Eye was used only sporadically during most of the 1990s.

Although the big band era had passed, Columbia had Duke Ellington under contract for several years, capturing the historic moment when Ellington&#x27;s band provoked a post-midnight frenzy (followed by international headlines) at the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival, which proved a boost to a bandleader whose career had stalled. Under new head producer George Avakian, Columbia became the most vital label to the general public&#x27;s appreciation and understanding (with help from Avakian&#x27;s prolific and perceptive play-by-play liner notes) of jazz, releasing a series of LP&#x27;s by Louis Armstrong, but also signing to long-term contracts Dave Brubeck and Miles Davis, the two modern jazz artists who would in 1959 record albums that remain—more than sixty years later—among the best-selling jazz albums by any label—viz., &quot;Time Out&quot; by the Brubeck Quartet and, to an even greater extent, &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; by the Davis Sextet, which, in 2003, appeared as number 12 in &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums Of All Time&quot;. With another producer, Teo Macero, a skilled modernist composer himself, Columbia cemented contracts with jazz composer/musicians Thelonious Monk and Charles Mingus, while Macero became a significant figure in Miles Davis career from an explorer of the art of modal jazz from Davis&#x27; sextets 1958 album &quot;Milestones&quot; to innovator and avatar of the marriage of jazz with rock and electronic sounds—commonly known as jazz fusion.

In 1954, Columbia embraced small-group modern jazz by signing of the Dave Brubeck Quartet, which resulted in the release of the on-location, best-selling jazz album (up to this time), &quot;Jazz Goes to College&quot;. Contemporaneously with Columbia&#x27;s first release of modern jazz by a small group, which was also the Brubeck Quartet&#x27;s debut on the label, was a &quot;Time&quot; magazine cover story on the phenomenon of Brubeck&#x27;s success on college campuses. The humble Dave Brubeck demurred, saying that the second &quot;Time&quot; cover story on a jazz musician (the first featured Louis Armstrong&#x27;s picture) had been earned by Duke Ellington, not himself. Within two years Ellington&#x27;s picture would appear on the cover of &quot;Time&quot;, following his success at the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival. Ellington at Newport, recorded on Columbia, was also the bandleader-composer-pianist&#x27;s best-selling album. Moreover, this exclusive trinity of jazz giants featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine were all Columbia artists. (In the early 1960s Columbia jazz artist Thelonious Monk would be afforded the same honor.)

Columbia changed distributors in Australia and New Zealand in 1956 when the Australian Record Company picked up distribution of U.S. Columbia product to replace the Capitol Records product which ARC lost when EMI bought Capitol. As EMI owned the Columbia trademark at that time, the U.S. Columbia material was issued in Australia and New Zealand on the CBS Coronet label.

In the same year, former Columbia A&amp;R manager Goddard Lieberson was promoted to President of the entire CBS recording division, which included Columbia and Epic, and the company&#x27;s various international divisions and licensees. Under his leadership the corporation&#x27;s music division soon overtook RCA Victor as the top recording company in the world, boasting a star-studded roster of artists and an unmatched catalogue of popular, jazz, classical and stage and screen soundtrack titles. Lieberson, who had joined Columbia as an A&amp;R manager in 1938, was known for both his personal elegance and his dedication to quality, overseeing the release of many hugely successful albums and singles, and championing prestige releases that sold relatively poorly, and even some titles that had limited appeal, such as complete editions of the works of Arnold Schoenberg and Anton von Webern. One of his first major successes was the original Broadway cast album of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, which sold over 5 million copies worldwide in 1957, becoming the most successful LP ever released up to that time. Lieberson also convinced long-serving CBS President William S. Paley to become the sole backer of the original Broadway production, a $500,000 investment which subsequently earned the company some $32 million in profits.

In October 1958, Columbia, in time for the Christmas season, put out a series of &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; packages by such artists as Johnny Mathis, Doris Day, Guy Mitchell, Johnnie Ray, Jo Stafford, Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney, Frankie Laine and the Four Lads; months later, it put out another Mathis compilation and that of Marty Robbins. Only Mathis&#x27; compilations charted, since there were only 25 positions on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s album charts at the time. However, the compilations were so successful that they led to Columbia doing such packages on a widespread basis, usually when an artist&#x27;s career was in decline.

==== Stereo ====
Although Columbia began recording in stereo in 1956, stereo LPs did not begin to be manufactured until 1958. One of Columbia&#x27;s first stereo releases was an abridged and re-structured performance of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; by the New York Philharmonic and the Westminster Choir conducted by Leonard Bernstein (recorded on December 31, 1956, on -inch tape, using an Ampex 300-3 machine). Bernstein combined the Nativity and Resurrection sections, and ended the performance with the death of Christ. As with RCA Victor, most of the early stereo recordings were of classical artists, including the New York Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Bruno Walter, Dimitri Mitropoulos, and Leonard Bernstein, and the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Eugene Ormandy, who also recorded an abridged &quot;Messiah&quot; for Columbia. Some sessions were made with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, an ensemble drawn from leading New York musicians, which had first made recordings with Sir Thomas Beecham in 1949 in Columbia&#x27;s New York City studios. George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra recorded mostly for Epic. When Epic dropped classical music, the roster and catalogue was moved to Columbia Masterworks Records.

Columbia released its first pop stereo albums in the summer of 1958. All of the first dozen or so were stereo versions of albums already available in mono. It was not until September 1958, that Columbia began simultaneous mono/stereo releases. Mono versions of otherwise stereo recordings were discontinued in 1968. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the introduction of the LP, in 1958 Columbia initiated the &quot;Adventures in Sound&quot; series that showcased music from around the world.

As far as the catalog numbering system went, there was no correlation between mono and stereo versions for the first few years. Columbia started a new CS 8000 series for pop stereo releases, and figuring the stereo releases as some sort of specialty niche records, didn&#x27;t bother to link the mono and stereo numbers for two years. Masterworks classical LPs had an MS 6000 series, while showtunes albums on Masterworks were OS 2000. Finally, in 1960, the pop stereo series jumped from 8300 to 8310 to match &quot;Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross Sing Ellington&quot;, the Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross album issued as CL-1510. From that point, the stereo numbers on pop albums were exactly 6800 higher than the mono; stereo classical albums were the mono number plus 600; and showtunes releases were the mono number MINUS 3600. Only the last two digits in the respective catalog series&#x27; matched.

Pop stereo LPs got into the high 9000s by 1970, when CBS Records revamped and unified its catalog numbering system across all its labels. Masterworks classical albums were in the 7000s, while showtunes stayed in the low 2000s.

Columbia&#x27;s engineering department developed a process for emulating stereo from a mono source. They called this process &quot;Electronically Rechanneled for Stereo&quot;. In the June 16, 1962, issue of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine (page 5), Columbia announced it would issue &quot;rechanneled&quot; versions of greatest hits compilations that had been recorded in mono, including albums by Doris Day, Frankie Laine, Percy Faith, Mitch Miller, Marty Robbins, Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis, and Johnny Mathis.

=== The 1960s ===
==== Outing of &quot;deep groove&quot; ====
By the latter half of 1961, Columbia started using pressing plants with newer equipment. The &quot;deep groove&quot; pressings were made on older pressing machines, where the groove was an artifact of the metal stamper being affixed to a round center &quot;block&quot; to assure the resulting record would be centered. Newer machines used parts with a slightly different geometry, that only left a small &quot;ledge&quot; where the deep groove used to be. This changeover did not happen all at once, as different plants replaced machines at different times, leaving the possibility that both deep groove and ledge varieties could be original pressings. The changeover took place starting in late 1961.

==== CBS Records ====

In 1961, CBS ended its arrangement with Philips Records and formed its own international organization, CBS Records International, in 1962. This subsidiary label released Columbia recordings outside the US and Canada on the CBS label (until 1964 marketed by Philips in Britain). The recordings could not be released under the Columbia Records name because EMI operated a separate record label by that name, Columbia Graphophone Company, outside North America. This was the result of legal maneuvers which led to the creation of EMI in the early 1930s.

While this happened, starting in late 1961, both the mono and the stereo labels of domestic Columbia releases started carrying a small &quot;CBS&quot; at the top of the label. This was not something that changed at a certain date, but rather, pressing plants were told to use up the stock of old (pre-CBS) labels first, resulting in a mixture of labels for some given releases. Some are known with the CBS text on mono albums, and not on stereo of the same album, and vice versa; diggings brought up pressings with the CBS text on one side and not on the other. Many, but certainly not all, of the early numbers with the &quot;ledge&quot; variation (i.e., no deep groove), had the small &quot;CBS&quot;. This text would be used on the Columbia labels until June 1962.

Columbia&#x27;s Mexican unit, Discos Columbia, was renamed Discos CBS.

With the formation of CBS Records International, CBS started establishing its own distribution in the early 1960s, beginning in Australia. In 1960 CBS took over its distributor in Australia and New Zealand, the Australian Record Company (founded in 1936) including Coronet Records, one of the leading Australian independent recording and distribution companies of the day. The CBS Coronet label was replaced by the CBS label with the &#x27;walking eye&#x27; logo in 1963. ARC continued trading under that name until the late 1970s when it formally changed its business name to CBS Australia.

==== Mitch Miller on television ====
In 1961, Columbia&#x27;s music repertoire was given an enormous boost when Mitch Miller, its A&amp;R manager and bandleader, became the host of the variety series &quot;Sing Along with Mitch&quot; on NBC. The show was based on Miller&#x27;s &#x27;folksy&#x27; but appealing &#x27;chorus&#x27; style performance of popular standards. During its four-season run, the series promoted Miller&#x27;s &quot;Singalong&quot; albums, which sold over 20 million units, and received a 34% audience share when it was cancelled in 1964.

==== Bob Dylan ====
In September 1961, CBS A&amp;R manager John Hammond was producing the first Columbia album by folk singer Carolyn Hester, who invited a friend to accompany her on one of the recording sessions. It was here that Hammond first met Bob Dylan, whom he signed to the label, initially as a harmonica player. Dylan&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released in March 1962 and sold only moderately. Some executives in Columbia dubbed Dylan &quot;Hammond&#x27;s folly&quot; and suggest that Dylan be dropped from the label. But John Hammond and Johnny Cash defended Dylan, who over the next four years became one of Columbia&#x27;s highest earning acts.

Over the course of the 1960s, Dylan achieved a prominent position in Columbia. His early folk songs were recorded by many acts and became hits for Peter, Paul &amp; Mary and The Turtles. Some of these cover versions became the foundation of the folk rock genre. The Byrds achieved their pop breakthrough with a version of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;. In 1965, Dylan&#x27;s controversial decision to &#x27;go electric&#x27; and work with rock musicians divided his audience but catapulted him to greater commercial success with his 1965 hit single &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;. Following his withdrawal from touring in 1966, Dylan recorded a large group of songs with his backing group The Band which reached other artists as &#x27;demo recordings&#x27;. These resulted in hits by Manfred Mann (&quot;The Mighty Quinn&quot;) and Julie Driscoll &amp; Brian Auger and the Trinity (&quot;This Wheel&#x27;s On Fire&quot;). Dylan&#x27;s late 1960s albums &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; and &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot; became cornerstone recordings of the emergent country rock genre and influenced The Byrds and The Flying Burrito Brothers.

==== Rock and roll ====
When the British Invasion arrived in January 1964, Columbia had no rock musicians on its roster except for Dion, who was signed in 1963 as the label&#x27;s first major rock star, and Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders who were also signed in 1963. The label released a merseybeat album, &quot;The Exciting New Liverpool Sound&quot; (Columbia CL-2172, issued in mono only). Terry Melcher, son of Doris Day, produced the hard driving &quot;Don&#x27;t Make My Baby Blue&quot; for Frankie Laine, who had gone six years without a hit record. The song reached No. 51 on the pop chart and No. 17 on the easy listening chart.

Melcher and Bruce Johnston discovered and brought to Columbia the Rip Chords, a vocal group consisting of Ernie Bringas and Phil Stewart, and turned it into a rock group through production techniques. The group had hits in &quot;Here I Stand&quot;, a remake of the song by Wade Flemons, and &quot;Hey Little Cobra&quot;. Columbia saw the two recordings as a start to getting into rock and roll. Melcher and Johnston recorded several additional singles for Columbia in 1964 as &quot;Bruce &amp; Terry&quot; and later as &quot;The Rogues&quot;. Melcher produced early albums by the Byrds and Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders for Columbia while Johnston produced the Beach Boys for Capitol Records.

==== Ascension of Clive Davis ====
When Mitch Miller retired in 1965, Columbia was at a turning point. Miller&#x27;s disdain for rock and roll and pop rock had dominated Columbia&#x27;s A&amp;R policy. Sales of Broadway soundtracks and Mitch Miller&#x27;s singalong series were waning. Pretax earnings had flattened to about $5 million annually. The label&#x27;s only significant &quot;pop&quot; acts at the time were Bob Dylan, the Byrds, Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders and Simon &amp; Garfunkel. In its catalogue were other genres: classical, jazz and country, along with a select group of R&amp;B artists, among them Aretha Franklin. Most historians observed that Columbia had problems marketing Franklin as a major talent in the R&amp;B genre, which led to her leaving the label for Atlantic Records in 1967.

In 1967, Brooklyn-born lawyer Clive Davis became president of Columbia. Following the appointment of Davis, the Columbia label became more of a rock music label, thanks mainly to Davis&#x27;s fortuitous decision to attend the Monterey International Pop Festival, where he spotted and signed several leading acts including Janis Joplin. Joplin led the way for several generations of female rock and rollers. However, Columbia/CBS still had a hand in traditional pop and jazz and one of its key acquisitions during this period was Barbra Streisand. She released her first solo album on Columbia in 1963 and remains with the label to this day. Additionally, the label kept Miles Davis on the roster, and his late 1960s recordings, &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; and &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;, pioneered a fusion of jazz and rock music.

A San Francisco group called Moby Grape had been gaining popularity on the West Coast, and were signed by Davis in 1967. As a way of introducing them to the world with a splash, they released their debut album, along with five singles from the album, all on the same day, June 6, 1967, 23 years following D-Day. The album hit made No. 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, but the singles barely made a dent in the charts, the best performer being &quot;Omaha&quot;, which lasted a mere three weeks on the Hot 100 reaching only No. 88. The other charter, &quot;Hey Grandma&quot;, only reached the Bubbling Under chart and faded within a week. Also, there were some complaints about the obscene gesture made to the American flag on the front cover that had to be edited out on the second pressing, not to mention that the group started to decline in sales after that. The return on all the promotional budget for the singles realized nothing. Although the group made two more albums, this particular publicity stunt was never again attempted by Columbia or any other major label.

==== Simon &amp; Garfunkel ====
Arguably the most commercially successful Columbia pop act of this period, other than Bob Dylan, was Simon &amp; Garfunkel. The duo scored a surprise No. 1 hit in 1965 when Columbia producer Tom Wilson, inspired by the folk-rock experiments of Dylan, The Byrds and others, added drums and bass to the duo&#x27;s earlier recording of &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; without their knowledge or approval. Indeed, the duo had already broken up some months earlier, discouraged by the poor sales of their debut LP, and Paul Simon had relocated to the UK, where he only found out about the single being a hit via the music press. The dramatic success of the song prompted Simon to return to the US; the duo reformed, and they soon became one of the flagship acts of the folk-rock boom of the mid-1960s. Their next album, &quot;Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme&quot;, went to No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. The duo subsequently had a Top 20 single, &quot;A Hazy Shade of Winter&quot;, but progress slowed during 1966–67 as Simon struggled with writer&#x27;s block and the demands of constant touring. They shot back to the top in 1968 after Simon agreed to write songs for the Mike Nichols film &quot;The Graduate&quot;. The resulting single, &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;, became a smash hit. Both &quot;The Graduate&quot; soundtrack and Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s next studio album, &quot;Bookends&quot;, were major hits on the album chart, with combined total sales in excess of five million copies. Simon and Garfunkel&#x27;s fifth and final studio album, &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; (1970), reached number one in the US album charts in January 1970 and became one of the most successful albums of all time.

==== Hoyt Axton and Tom Rush ====
Davis lured artists Hoyt Axton and Tom Rush to Columbia in 1969, and both were given what was known as &quot;the pop treatment&quot; by the label. Hoyt Axton had been a folk/blues singer-songwriter since the early 1960s, when he made several albums for Horizon, then Vee-Jay. By the time he joined Columbia, he had mixed successful pop songs like &quot;Greenback Dollar&quot;, with hard rock songs for Steppenwolf, such as &quot;The Pusher&quot;, which was used in the film &quot;Easy Rider&quot; in the same year. When he landed at Columbia, his album &quot;My Griffin Is Gone&quot; was described as &quot;the poster child for &#x27;overproduced,&#x27; full of all kinds of instruments and even strings&quot;. After that album, Axton left and joined Capitol Records, where his next albums contained &quot;Joy to the World&quot; and &quot;Never Been to Spain&quot;, which became hits for Three Dog Night on Dunhill. Axton eventually became a country singer, and founded his own record label, Jeremiah.

Tom Rush had always been the &quot;storyteller&quot; or &quot;balladeer&quot; type of folk artist, before and after his stint with Columbia, to which Rush was lured from Elektra. As with Axton, Rush was given &quot;the treatment&quot; on his self-titled Columbia debut. The multitude of instruments added to his usual solo guitar were all done &quot;tastefully&quot;, of course, but was not really on par with Rush&#x27;s audience expectations. He commented to record label historian Mike Callahan: Eventually, Rush returned to his usual sound (which he applied to his next three albums for Columbia) and has been playing to appreciative audiences ever since.

=== The 1970s ===
==== Catalog numbers ====
The Columbia album series began in 1951 with album GL-500 (CL-500) and reached an awkward milestone in 1970, when the stereo numbering sequence reached CS-9999, assigned to the Patti Page album &quot;Honey Come Back&quot;. This presented a catalog numbering system challenge as Columbia had used a four-digit catalog number for 13 years, and CS-10000 seemed cumbersome. Columbia decided to start issuing albums at CS-1000 instead, preserving the four-digit catalog number. However, this resulted in the reuse of numbers previously used in 1957–58, although the prefix was now different. In July 1970, the cataloging department implemented a new system, combining all their labels into a unified catalog numbering system starting with 30000, with the prefix letter indicating the label: C for Columbia, E for Epic, H for Harmony (budget reissue line), M for Columbia Masterworks, S for movie soundtrack and original Broadway cast albums, Y for Columbia Odyssey, and Z for every other label that CBS distributed (collectively referred to as CBS Associated). The prefix letter G was also used for two album sets—or the number of records in the set after the label letter, such as KC2. The first CBS album released under the new system was The Elvin Bishop Group&#x27;s self-titled album on Fillmore Records, assigned with F 30001 (the earliest Fillmore albums had the &#x27;F&#x27; prefix, rather than a &#x27;Z&#x27;), while the first actual Columbia release under the system was Herschel Bernardi&#x27;s &quot;Show Stopper&quot;, assigned with C 30004. The highest catalog number released in the old system was CS-1069, assigned to &quot;The Sesame Street Book and Record&quot;. Chronologically, Columbia issued at least one album in this series in August, but by that time, the CBS Consolidated 30000 series, which started issuing albums in July with the new label design, was well underway, having issued nearly 100 albums. The system was later expanded with even more prefix letters (including R and V for Portrait, A and W for Special Products, L for Sony Wonder, S for Sony Classical, N for Monument, O for Chaos Recordings, and B for 550 Music), which continued until 2005.

In September 1970, under the guidance of Clive Davis, Columbia Records entered the West Coast rock market, opening a state-of-the art recording studio (which was located at 827 Folsom St. in San Francisco and later morphed into the Automatt) and establishing an A&amp;R head and office in San Francisco at Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf, headed by George Daly, a producer and artist for Monument Records (who inked a distribution deal with Columbia at the time) and a former bandmate of Nils Lofgren and Roy Buchanan. The recording studio operated under CBS until 1978.

==== Quadraphonic Sound ====
During 1971 Columbia began producing records in four-channel quadraphonic sound, using the &quot;SQ Quadraphonic&quot; matrix decoding system. These recordings were backward compatible on conventional two-channel stereo playback systems, but played four-channels of surround sound when heard with special amplifiers and additional speakers. Artists using this technology covered all genres, including classical music Leonard Bernstein and Pierre Boulez, plus popular artists such as Electric Light Orchestra, Billy Joel, Pink Floyd, Johnny Cash, Barbra Streisand, Ray Conniff, Santana, Herbie Hancock, and Blue Öyster Cult. RCA had already begun releasing quadraphonic recordings on 8-track tape starting in 1970, and countered on LP record with the Quadradisc system. The RCA process required a special phono cartridge for &quot;discrete&quot; four-channel playback unlike the Columbia &quot;matrix&quot; system. Although the Columbia process was simpler and quite effective, many consumers were confused by competing systems and sales of both were disappointing. Columbia released its last quadraphonic recordings in 1978. Starting in the 1990s multichannel surround sound music surged again with the popularity of home cinema systems. Many quadraphonic recordings were reissued in new surround sound formats such as Dolby Digital, DTS, Super Audio CD and Blu-ray, however, multichannel music still did not reach mass-market acceptance.

==== Yetnikoff becomes president ====
In 1975, Walter Yetnikoff was promoted to become President of Columbia Records, and his vacated position as President of CBS Records International was filled by Dick Asher. At this point, according to music historian Fredric Dannen, the shy and introverted Yetnikoff began to transform his personality, becoming (in Asher&#x27;s words) &quot;wild, menacing, crude, and above all, very loud&quot;. In Dannen&#x27;s view, Yetnikoff was probably over-compensating for his naturally sensitive and generous personality, and that he had little hope of being recognised as a &quot;record man&quot; (someone with a musical ear and an intuitive understanding of current trends and artists&#x27; intentions) because he was tone-deaf, so he instead determined to become a &quot;colourful character&quot;. Yetnikoff soon became notorious for his violent temper and regular tantrums: &quot;He shattered glassware, spewed a mixture of Yiddish and barnyard epithets, and had people physically ejected from the CBS building.&quot;

In 1976, Columbia Records of Canada was renamed CBS Records Canada Ltd. The Columbia label continued to be used by CBS Canada, but the CBS label was introduced for French-language recordings. On May 5, 1979, Columbia Masterworks began digital recording in a recording session of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Petrouchka&quot; by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Zubin Mehta, in New York (using 3M&#x27;s 32-channel multitrack digital recorder).

==== Dick Asher vs &quot;The Network&quot; ====

CBS Records had a popular roster of musicians. It distributed Philadelphia International Records, Blue Sky Records, the Isley Brothers&#x27; T-Neck Records and Monument Records (from 1971 to 1976). But the music industry was in financial decline. Total sales fell by 11%, the biggest drop since World War II. In 1979, CBS had a pre-tax income of $51 million and sales of over $1 billion. The label laid off hundreds of employees.

To deal with the crisis, CEO John Backe promoted Dick Asher from Vice President of Business Affairs to Deputy President. Charged with cutting costs and restoring profits, Asher was reportedly reluctant to take on the role. He was worried that Yetnikoff would resent his promotion. But Backe had confidence in Asher&#x27;s experience. In 1972, Asher had turned the British division of CBS from loss to profit. Backe considered him to be honest and trustworthy, and he appealed to Asher&#x27;s loyalty to the company. Employees at CBS thought Asher was a bore and an interloper. He cut back on expenses and on perks like limousines and restaurants. His relationship with Yetnikoff deteriorated.

Asher became increasingly concerned about the huge and rapidly growing cost of hiring independent agents, who were paid to promote new singles to radio station program directors. &quot;Indies&quot; had been used by record labels for many years to promote new releases, but as he methodically delved into CBS Records&#x27; expenses, Asher was dismayed to discover that hiring these independent promoters was now costing CBS alone as much as $10 million per year. When Asher took over CBS&#x27; UK division in 1972, a freelance promoter might only charge $100 per week, but by 1979 the top American independent promoters had organized themselves into a loose collective known as &quot;The Network&quot;, and their fees were now running into the tens millions of dollars per year, Music historian Fredric Dannen estimates that by 1980 the major labels were paying anywhere from to $100,000 to $300,000 &quot;per song&quot; to the &quot;Network&quot; promoters, and that it was costing the industry as whole as much as $80 million annually.

During this period, Columbia scored a Top 40 hit with the Pink Floyd single &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot;, and its parent album &quot;The Wall&quot; would spend four months at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; LP chart in early 1980, but few in the industry knew that Dick Asher was in fact using the single as a covert experiment to test the extent of the pernicious influence of The Network – by &quot;not&quot; paying them to promote the new Pink Floyd single. The results were immediate and deeply troubling – not one of the major radio stations in Los Angeles would program the record, despite the fact that the group was in town, performing the first seven concerts on their elaborate The Wall Tour at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena to rave reviews and sold-out crowds. Asher was already worried about the growing power of The Network, and the fact it operated entirely outside the control of the label, but he was profoundly dismayed to realize that &quot;The Network&quot; was in effect a huge extortion racket, and that the operation could well be linked to organized crime – a concern vehemently dismissed by Yetnikoff, who resolutely defended the &quot;indies&quot; and declared them to be &quot;mensches&quot;. But Dick Asher now knew that The Network&#x27;s real power lay in their ability to &quot;prevent&quot; records from being picked up by radio, and as an experienced media lawyer and a loyal CBS employee, he was also acutely aware that this could become a new payola scandal which had the potential to engulf the entire CBS corporation, and that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) could even revoke CBS&#x27; all-important broadcast licenses if the corporation was found to be involved in any illegality.

=== The 1980s and sale to Sony ===
The structure of US Columbia remained the same until 1980, when it spun off the classical/Broadway unit, Columbia Masterworks Records, into a separate imprint, CBS Masterworks Records.

In 1988, the CBS Records Group, including the Columbia Records unit, was acquired by Sony, which re-christened the parent division Sony Music Entertainment in 1991. As Sony only had a temporary license on the CBS Records name, it then acquired the rights to the Columbia trademarks (Columbia Graphophone) outside the U.S., Canada, Spain (trademark owned by BMG) and Japan (Nippon Columbia) from EMI, a firm which generally had not used them since the early 1970s. The CBS Records label was officially renamed Columbia Records on January 1, 1991, worldwide except Spain (where Sony got the rights in 2004 by forming a joint venture with BMG) and Japan. CBS Masterworks Records was renamed Sony Classical Records. In December 2006, CBS Corporation revived the CBS Records name for a new minor label closely linked with its television properties (coincidentally, the new CBS Records is currently distributed by another Sony Music division, RED Distribution).

=== The 1990s–present ===
American talent manager Will Botwin was recruited in 1996 to serve as a Senior Vice President. In 1998, he was appointed Executive Vice President/General Manager and worked closely with many of the label&#x27;s established artists, and newer performers such as Microdisney and Five For Fighting. In 2002, Botwin was promoted to President of the Columbia Records Group; he was appointed Chairman in 2005. In 2006, he left Columbia to head Red Light Management and its associated ATO Records.

Columbia Records remains a premier subsidiary label of Sony Music Entertainment. In 2009, during the re-consolidation of Sony Music, Columbia was partnered with its Epic Records sister to form the Columbia/Epic Label Group under which it operated as an imprint. In July 2011, as part of further corporate restructuring, Epic was split from the Columbia/Epic Group as Epic took in multiple artists from Jive Records.

As of March 2013, Columbia Records was home to 90 artists such as Lauren Jauregui, Robbie Williams, Calvin Harris and Daft Punk.

On January 2, 2018, Ron Perry was named as the chairman and CEO of Columbia Records. In January 2023, Jennifer Mallory was appointed President.

== Logos and branding ==
The acquisition of rights to the Columbia trademarks by EMI (including the &quot;Magic Notes&quot; logo) presented the company with a dilemma of which logo to use. For much of the 1990s, Columbia released its albums without a logo, just the &quot;COLUMBIA&quot; word mark in the Bodoni Classic Bold typeface. Columbia experimented with bringing back the &quot;Notes and Mic&quot; logo but without the CBS mark on the microphone. That logo is currently used in the &quot;Columbia Jazz&quot; series of jazz releases and reissues. A modified &quot;Magic Notes&quot; logo is found on the logo for Sony Classical. In mid to late 1999, it was eventually decided that the &quot;Walking Eye&quot; (previously the CBS Records logo outside North America) would be Columbia&#x27;s logo, with the retained Columbia word mark design, throughout the world except in Japan where Nippon Columbia has the rights to the Columbia trademark to this day and continues to use the &quot;Magic Notes&quot; logo. In Japan, CBS/Sony Records was renamed Sony Records in 1991 and stopped using the &quot;Walking Eye&quot; logo in 1998.

== List of Columbia Records artists ==

As of 2025, the current Columbia Records roster includes Barbra Streisand, Bruce Springsteen, Celine Dion, Beyoncé, Adele, Rosalía, Seohyun, Harry Styles, Miley Cyrus, Lil Nas X, Blink-182, Addison Rae, Jennie, Dove Cameron, Central Cee, Chlöe, Halsey, Ive, Tyler, the Creator, Pharrell Williams, and many more. In October 2012, there were 85 recording artists signed to Columbia Records, making it the largest of the three flagship labels owned by Sony Music (followed by RCA Records with 78 artists and Epic Records with 43 artists).

== Subsidiaries ==
* Kemosabe Records
* Small Giant Records
* CloudBoy Records
* Signal Records
* CMV: Columbia Music Video
* Brushfire Records

== Affiliated labels ==
=== Columbia Label Group (UK) ===
In January 2006, Sony BMG UK split its front-line operations into two separate labels: RCA Label Group, mainly dealing with Pop and R&amp;B and Columbia Label Group, mainly dealing with Rock, Dance and Alternative music (although this remit has widened in recent years). Domestic artists include Calvin Harris, George Ezra, Central Cee and Robbie Williams. Dipesh Parmar is the President of Columba Label Group and Amy Wheatley is the Managing Director. Subsidiary labels include Ministry of Sound Records and Room Two Recordings.

=== American Recording Company (ARC) ===
During August 1978 Maurice White, founder and leader of the band Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, re-launched the American Recording Company (ARC). In addition to White&#x27;s Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, the Columbia Records-distributed label artist roster included successful R&amp;B and pop singer Deniece Williams, jazz-fusion group Weather Report, and R&amp;B trio the Emotions. Since the 1940s, Columbia has also re-issued thousands of 1930s records issued on ARC labels.

=== Aware Records ===
In 1997, Columbia made an affiliation with unsigned artist promotion label Aware Records to distribute Aware&#x27;s artists&#x27; music. In 2002, Columbia and Aware accepted the option to continue this relationship.

=== Columbia Nashville ===
In 2007, Columbia formed Columbia Nashville, which is part of Sony Music Nashville. This gave Columbia Nashville complete autonomy and managerial separation from Columbia in New York City. Columbia had given its country music department semi-autonomy for many years and through the 1950s, had a 20,000 series catalog for country music singles while the rest of Columbia&#x27;s output of singles had a 30,000, then 40,000 series catalog number.

In 2009, Columbia Nashville became part of Sony Music Nashville under the Sony Group Corporation umbrella through Sony Music Group.

== Recording studios ==
Columbia Records operated recording studios, the most notable of which were in New York City, Nashville, Hollywood and San Francisco. Columbia&#x27;s first recording studio was established in 1913, after the company moved into the Woolworth Building in Manhattan, the tallest building in the world at the time. In 1917, Columbia used this studio to make one of the earliest jazz records, by the Original Dixieland Jass Band.

=== 7th Avenue, New York===
In 1939, Columbia established Studio A at 799 Seventh Avenue in New York City. This studio – well known for its use by Bob Dylan in the 1960s – was purchased in 1967 by Jack Arnold and Phil Ramone&#x27;s A &amp; R Recording, and became Studios A-1 and A-2 for A &amp; R. The building was demolished in 1983 to make way for the Equitable Tower.

=== 52nd Street, New York===

Studio B and Studio E were located in the CBS Studio Building at 49 East 52nd Street in New York City – on the second and fifth floor, respectively.

===30th Street, New York===

In 1948, Columbia built additional new studios at 207 East 30th Street in Manhattan&#x27;s Murray Hill district, naming them Studio C and Studio D. This complex, nicknamed &quot;The Church&quot; due to it having been built within an 1875 building that was originally constructed as a Christian church, was considered by some in the music industry to be the best-sounding room of its time, and many consider it to have been the greatest recording studio in history. CBS never took up the option to buy the building outright, giving up its lease and closing the studio in 1981. In spite of the building&#x27;s inherent heritage status and its cultural significance, it was sold to developers in 1985, demolished, and replaced by a high-rise apartment complex.

===Columbia Square, Hollywood===

In 1961, Columbia Records renovated and repurposed CBS Radio Studio A at the company&#x27;s Columbia Square complex at 6121 Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California. Columbia utilized the studio for recording and mastering services until its closure in 1972.

===Columbia Studios, Nashville===

In 1962, Columbia Records purchased the Bradley Studios in Nashville, Tennessee (also known as the Quonset Hut), the first recording studio in what would become Nashville&#x27;s Music Row district when first established by Harold and Owen Bradley in 1954. Renamed Columbia Studios, the company replaced Bradley Studio A with a building containing a newer, larger studio A, mixing and mastering studios, and administrative offices. Columbia operated these studios from 1962 through 1982, when they were converted into office space. Philanthropist Mike Curb bought the structure in 2006 and restored it; it is now a recording classroom for Belmont University&#x27;s Mike Curb College of Entertainment &amp; Music Business.

===Liederkranz Hall Studio, New York===
Columbia also recorded in the highly respected Liederkranz Hall, at 111 East 58th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, in New York City, it was built by and formerly belonged to a German cultural and musical society, The Liederkranz Society, and used as a recording studio (Victor also recorded in Liederkranz Hall in the late 1920s). The producer Morty Palitz had been instrumental in convincing Columbia Records to begin to use the Liederkranz Hall studio for recording music, additionally convincing the conductor Andre Kostelanetz to make some of the first recordings in Liederkranz Hall which until then had only been used for CBS Symphony radio shows. In 1949, the large Liederkranz Hall space was physically rearranged to create four television studios.

== Executives ==
* Ron Perry – Chairman &amp; CEO
* Jenifer Mallory – GM
* Stephen Russo – EVP &amp; CFO
* Abou &quot;Bu&quot; Thiam – EVP
* Edward Wallerstein – Chairman &amp; CEO (1939–1951)

<text>Upper Hutt () is a city in the Wellington Region of New Zealand and one of the four cities that constitute the Wellington metropolitan area.

==History==
Upper Hutt is in an area originally known as Orongomai and that of the river was Heretaunga (today the name of a suburb of Upper Hutt). The first residents of the area were Māori of the Ngāi Tara iwi. Various other iwi controlled the area in the years before 1840, and by the time the first colonial settlers arrived the area was part of the Te Āti awa rohe.

Orongomai Marae is to the south of the modern city centre.

In 1839, the English colonising company, The New Zealand Company made a purchase from Māori chiefs of about 160,000 acres of land in the Wellington region including Upper Hutt. The Hutt Valley is named after one of the founders of this company. Dealings from the New Zealand Company and following that, the Crown (after the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840), with local Māori regarding the land in Upper Hutt were flawed including not transacting with all the iwi that had claims on the land. Disputes arose and there were skirmishes and warfare in the Hutt Valley in 1846 between troops under Governor George Grey and Māori including chiefs Te Rauparaha, Te Rangihaeata, Te Mamaku and iwi including Ngāti Toa, Ngāti Rangatahi, Ngāti Tama and Ngāti Hāua-te-rangi.

Richard Barton, who settled at Trentham in 1841 in the area now known as Trentham Memorial Park, was the first European resident. Barton subsequently subdivided his land and set aside a large area that was turned into parkland. James Brown settled in the area that became the Upper Hutt town in 1848.

Having divided the land into 100 acre block, the settlers set about clearing the land of its indigenous forest and turning it into farmland. Sawmillers milled larger trees, such as Totara, for building materials and burned off the remaining scrub and underbrush.

Alarmed by unrest in Taranaki and sightings of local Māori bearing arms, settlers in the Hutt Valley lobbied for the construction of fortifications in Upper and Lower Hutt. The government and the military responded by constructing 2 stockades in the Hutt Valley in 1860. While the stockade in Upper Hutt was manned for 6 months, the threat of hostilities soon passed and neither installation ever saw hostile action.

The railway line from Wellington reached Upper Hutt on 1 February 1876. The line was extended to Kaitoke at the top end of the valley, reaching there on 1 January 1878. The line continued over the Remutaka Ranges to Featherston in the Wairarapa as a Fell railway, opening on 12 October 1878.

Upper Hutt in 1897 was recorded in the Cyclopedia of New Zealand.

By the beginning of March 1914, the area of Upper Hutt controlled by the Upper Hutt Town Board had its own water supply. The supply capacity was increased when the Birchville Dam was built in 1930.

On the evening of 28 March 1914, fire broke out at the Benge and Pratt store in Main Street. An explosion killed 8 of the volunteers fighting the fire and destroyed the building.

For many years, Upper Hutt was a rural service town, supporting the surrounding rural farming and forestry community. Serious urbanisation of the upper Hutt Valley only started around the 1920s, but from the late 1940s onwards, Upper Hutt&#x27;s population exploded as people moved from the crowded hustle and bustle of inner-city Wellington into a more secluded yet sprawling Hutt Valley. In 1950, Trentham Memorial Park was created with an area of almost 50 hectares. 

Upper Hutt continued to grow in population and became a city within the Wellington metropolitan area on 2 May 1966 after the Government Statistician certified that the population had reached 20 000, allowing the Town Clerk to make an application for city status.

On 9 April 1976, Upper Hutt became the first area in New Zealand to implement subscriber toll dialling (STD), allowing telephone subscribers to make national calls without operator assistance.
Residential subdivision in areas such as Clouston Park, Maoribank, Tōtara Park and Kingsley Heights continued into the 1980s.

In February 1979 Muhammed Ali came to New Zealand, staying at Upper Hutt.

=== Historic places ===

There are twelve historic sites within Upper Hutt included on the Heritage New Zealand list of historic places, including four Category 1 sites, seven Category 2 sites, and one historic area. The historic area, the Remutaka Incline Rail Trail, crosses into part of neighbouring South Wairarapa District.

==Geography==
The Upper Hutt city centre lies approximately 26 km north-east of Wellington. While the main areas of urban development lie along the Te Awa Kairangi / Hutt River valley floor, the city extends to the top of the Remutaka Pass to the north-east and into the Akatarawa Valley and rough hill-country of the Akatarawa ranges to the north and north-west, almost reaching the Kāpiti Coast close to Paekākāriki. 

Upper Hutt is in the bed of an ancient river flood plain and as such was prone to flooding. In the 1970s and 1980s, a stop bank was built alongside the eastern side of the river from northern Upper Hutt to the mouth of Te Awa Kairangi / Hutt River in Lower Hutt to prevent further flooding. Centred on the upper (northern) valley of Te Awa Kairangi / Hutt River, which flows north-east to south-west on its way to Wellington harbour, the flat land widens briefly into a 2500-m-wide floodplain between the Remutaka and Akatarawa Ranges before constricting nine kilometres further downstream at the Taitā Gorge, which separates Upper Hutt from its neighbour, Lower Hutt. The city&#x27;s main urban area spreads over this plain. A smaller flood plain lies upstream, above the Kaitoke Gorge, but has experienced little urban development.

===Climate===
Upper Hutt has a temperate climate however due to its sheltered valley location, it generally tends to be warmer than inner city Wellington in the summer and much colder in the winter. It is not uncommon in summer for temperatures to reach the high-20s Celsius (+/- 82 °F), and in winter, the temperature to drop to as low as −5 °C (about 23 °F) with regular and often heavy frost. Snow generally doesn&#x27;t fall below 300 m, but in 2011 Upper Hutt sea level snow occurred twice, as part of 2011 New Zealand snowstorms. On 25 July and again between 14 and 16 August, which was the heaviest blizzard in Upper Hutt since 1976 and came as a great novelty to residents. Upper Hutt receives about 1400 mm of rain per year. At 17.5 °C on average, February is the warmest month, while July is the coldest at 8.5 °C.

==Government==

=== Local government ===
Upper Hutt City Council administers the city with its surrounding rural areas, parks and reserves. Its area is 540 km2, the third-largest area of city council in New Zealand, after Dunedin and Auckland. New Zealand local authorities with a large land area are usually termed districts, but Upper Hutt maintains its status as a city largely because of its high degree of urbanisation.

Upper Hutt was originally administered by the Hutt County Council, which was constituted in 1877. The Town Board was proclaimed on 24 April 1908. Upper Hutt became a Borough on 26 February 1926 and a City on 2 May 1966. On 1 April 1973, the Rimutaka Riding of Hutt County was added to the city. When the Hutt County Council was abolished on 1 November 1988, the city took over administration of the Heretaunga/Pinehaven ward, which was incorporated into the city on 1 November 1989 when the Heretaunga/Pinehaven Community Council was abolished.

=== Parliamentary representation ===
Today, Upper Hutt City falls entirely within the boundaries of the Remutaka electorate, currently held by Labour&#x27;s Chris Hipkins. Upper Hutt was represented by the Heretaunga electorate prior to the introduction of MMP in 1996, when the seat was merged with Eastern Hutt to form Remutaka.

:Te Mārua, Akatarawa, Rimutaka, Parkdale, Emerald Hill, Birchville, Timberlea, Brown Owl, Kaitoke, Maoribank, Ebdentown, Upper Hutt Central, Clouston Park, Mangaroa, Maymorn, Whitemans Valley, Tōtara Park, Kingsley Heights, Elderslea, Wallaceville, Trentham, Heretaunga, Silverstream and Pinehaven.

Developments in the area include Mount Timbale Marua, Marua Downs, Waitoka Estate, Wallaceville Estate, and Riverstone Terraces. A development called The Lanes was proposed but rejected by the Lanes Commissioners appointed by the council. This decision was made as to ensure the maintenance of the significant rural character and amenity in the Mangaroa Valley.

== Economy ==

=== Tyre factory ===
In 1945, Dunlop was granted a government licence to manufacture tyres. A site in Upper Hutt was purchased for a factory, and the first Dunlop tyres were produced on 11 March 1949. South Pacific Tyres was subsequently formed as a joint venture between Pacific Dunlop and the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. In November 1987, the company laid off around 120 of its 500 workers citing deregulation of the tyre industry that had led to reductions in the tariffs imposed on imported tyres. In June 2008, the company announced that the plant would be closing within 8 months.

=== Brewtown ===
In 2008, a site including the former tyre factory was purchased by property developer Malcolm Gillies, with the intention of turning it into an industrial park. The subsequent development of the site has focussed on craft brewing and the area has been branded as &quot;Brewtown&quot;. As of 2024, Brewtown is home to some popular entertainment attractions such as Daytona Adventure Park, which houses Go-kart racing, ice skating and ten-pin bowling. There are some other activities like escape rooms and axe throwing in the area. Weekend markets and events are also hosted on the grassy area.

==Transport==
===Road===
State Highway 2 is the principal highway through Upper Hutt, connecting with Lower Hutt and Wellington&#x27;s motorway system to the south, and the Wairarapa region via the Remutaka Hill Road to the north.

Fergusson Drive is the main thoroughfare through suburban Upper Hutt, passing through the city centre and connecting to State Highway 2 at Silverstream and Maoribank. It formed part of State Highway 2 before the River Road bypass opened in 1987.

In the 1980s, significant travel delays were being experienced through Upper Hutt, with State Highway 2 traffic travelling from Lower Hutt and Wellington to central Upper Hutt and further afield to the Wairarapa being funnelled down the two-lane Fergusson Drive and mixing with local traffic through Silverstream and Trentham. With the central government reluctant to fund any road improvements in the area, the Upper Hutt City Council commissioned the construction of a two-laned high-speed bypass along the banks of Te Awa Kairangi / Hutt River from the Taitā Gorge in the south to Māoribank in the north. River Road, as the road became known, opened in 1987. It promptly ran at full capacity and, after several serious accidents that were a legacy of its origins, it was enlarged and re-engineered to cope with the growing traffic volume. Today, River Road is a median-divided 2+1 road from the Taitā Gorge to Tōtara Park, with two-laned undivided sections over the Moonshine Bridge and from Tōtara Park to Maoribank.

State Highway 58, while only briefly in Upper Hutt itself, intersects with SH 2 a short distance to the south of the boundary of Upper Hutt and Lower Hutt, and provides a link between Upper Hutt and Porirua.

State Highway 1 (as the Transmission Gully Motorway) briefly touches Upper Hutt at the Wainui Saddle (the tripoint of Upper Hutt, Porirua City and the Kāpiti Coast District), but otherwise does not pass through the region.

===Bus===
Bus services, planned and subsidised by Greater Wellington Regional Council under the Metlink brand, are centred around the Upper Hutt railway station and operate from Monday to Saturday on most routes, with the 110 route between Upper Hutt and Lower Hutt operating 7 days a week. All of the urbanised areas of the city are served by public bus routes, and the rural areas are served by school buses.

===Railway===
Upper Hutt is on the Hutt Valley Line, Metlink electric trains operated by Transdev Wellington run between 4:30am and 11pm weekdays, (midnight Fridays), 5am till midnight Saturdays and 6am till 11pm Sundays. Service which reaches Waterloo in Lower Hutt in around 20 minutes and Wellington in around 45 minutes. Express peak hour weekday trains reach Wellington in around 38 minutes. Services run every 20 minutes between 6am and 4:30pm weekday and half-hourly Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. Evening services run hourly from 8 to 11pm.

The railway continues beyond Upper Hutt to Masterton, becoming the Wairarapa Line, which is not electrified. Masterton is about an hour away by morning and afternoon diesel hauled trains. There are services five times a day each way Monday to Thursday, six on Friday, and twice a day, each way on Saturday, Sunday, and public holidays. A notable feature of this section of railway is the Rimutaka Tunnel, the second-longest railway tunnel in New Zealand, which replaced the Rimutaka Incline in 1955.

There are six railway stations within the boundaries of the city: Silverstream, Heretaunga, Trentham, Wallaceville, Upper Hutt (the main station for the city and outer terminus of electric services), and Maymorn (a request stop on the Wairarapa Line).

Upper Hutt&#x27;s main railway station was originally built in 1876 but has been rebuilt twice, firstly in 1955 and more recently in 2015. The most recent rebuild, jointly funded by NZTA and the Upper Hutt City Council, cost $3.5m and features a coffee bar, public toilets and an upgraded ticket office featuring real-time information of arrivals and departures of trains in a larger waiting room than the 1955 building.

In July 1955, the electrification of the railway line from Wellington to Upper Hutt was completed, allowing fast electric multiple unit trains to replace steam- and diesel-electric-hauled carriage trains. Later in November, the 8.8 km Rimutaka Tunnel opened, bypassing the Remutaka Incline and most of the existing line between Upper Hutt and Featherston, and reducing the time between the two from 2.5 hours to just 40 minutes.

The &quot;Blue Mountains Campus&quot; at Wallaceville is to be the location for KiwiRail &#x27;s national train control centre, which is to move from the Wellington railway station; to house a team of 120 train control team members in a train control room. It will be next to the rail network.
====Remutaka Incline====
To assist with the 1 in 15 grade of the Rimutaka Incline on the Featherston side of the range, the Fell engines that used a raised centre rail to haul trains up the steep grade were employed. The less steep 1 in 40 grades between Upper Hutt and the small settlement and shunting yard at Summit could be managed by ordinary steam locomotives. The only other rolling stock able to traverse the incline unaided were small bus-like Wairarapa railcars, colloquially known as &quot;Tin Hares&quot;.

By the 1950s, the Fell system had become too expensive to operate and was closed on 29 October 1955. To replace it, the Rimutaka Tunnel had been constructed, opening on 3 November 1955. In conjunction with the tunnel, the laying of a new route, new bridges and substantial realignment and double-tracking of the rest of the line from Wellington to Trentham had occurred by 26 June 1955.

The course of the incline is open to the public as part of the Remutaka Rail Trail.

==Sports and recreation==

Walking and mountain-biking is popular along Te Awa Kairangi / Hutt River and on the tracks in many parks, including Karapoti (focal point of the annual Karapoti Classic), Kaitoke, Cannon Point Walkway, Tunnel Gully and the Remutaka Rail Trail. Popular team sports include Cricket, Netball, Rugby, Rugby league, Soccer, and Valley Gridiron American football.

Expressions Whirinaki Arts and Entertainment Centre is home to Upper Hutt&#x27;s public art gallery including Golden Homes Gallery and Mitre 10 Mega Create Gallery, these two galleries feature a diverse programme of Local and National exhibitions. The Expressions Whirinaki complex also includes Gillies Group Theatre; the city&#x27;s performing arts venue, and the civic hall known as Professionals Recreation Hall. Close by is the central library of Upper Hutt Libraries – Ngā Puna Mātauranga o Te Awa Kairangi ki Uta and swimming pool Xtreme.

Upper Hutt is home to the biggest junior football club in New Zealand. The club was formed when Tararua Sports Club Inc and Upper Hutt City Soccer merged to create one club. The club now carries both of the old clubs&#x27; names. The club primarily plays its home games at Maidstone Park but also plays at Awakairangi, Harcourt Park and Trentham Memorial Park.

The city has one of New Zealand&#x27;s largest Inline speed skating clubs, Valley Inline which has many successful skaters and holds the annual Speed King Tour that celebrated its 22nd year in 2012.

<text>Roy Edward Disney KCSG (January 10, 1930 – December 16, 2009) was an American businessman. He was the longtime senior executive for the Walt Disney Company, which was founded by his uncle, Walt Disney, and his father, Roy O. Disney. At the time of his death, he held more than 16 million shares (about 1% of the company), and served as a consultant for the company, as well as director emeritus for the board of directors. During his tenure, he organized ousting of the company&#x27;s top two executives: Ron W. Miller in 1984 and Michael Eisner in 2005.

As the last member of the Disney family to be actively involved in the company, Disney was often compared to his uncle and to his father. In 2006, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine estimated his personal fortune at $1.2 billion.

Disney was also a celebrated yachtsman, a member of San Diego Yacht Club best known for his success in the Transpacific Yacht Race and winning the Newport Bermuda Race. Disney died from stomach cancer on December 16, 2009.

==Early life and career==

Disney was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of Edna (&quot;&quot; Francis; 1890–1984) and Roy O. Disney (1893–1971), the brother of Walt Disney. He graduated from Pomona College in 1951 and first began working for Walt Disney Productions as an assistant director and producer (&quot;True-Life Adventure&quot;). He continued until 1967, when he was elected to the company&#x27;s board of directors.

==Career==
===First &quot;Save Disney&quot; campaign (1984)===
Disney resigned as an executive from Walt Disney Productions in 1977 over disagreements with corporate decisions. He later said, &quot;I just felt creatively the company was not going anywhere interesting. It was very stifling.&quot;

Disney retained a seat on the board of directors until 1984, when he resigned in the midst of a corporate takeover battle. This began a series of events that ultimately led to the replacement of Ron Miller (husband of Walt&#x27;s daughter Diane Marie Disney) by Frank Wells and Michael Eisner as president and CEO, respectively. While investors were attempting the hostile takeover of Disney with the intention of dismantling the company and selling off its assets, Disney and his attorney and financial advisor Stanley Gold organized a consortium of white knight investors to fend off the takeover attempts. With the introduction of Wells and Eisner, Roy returned to the company as vice chairman and chairman of the animation department, which became Walt Disney Feature Animation.

===Partnership with Eisner===
During the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, Disney&#x27;s department produced a number of commercially successful and critically acclaimed films, an era which has been called the &quot;Disney Renaissance&quot;. &quot;The Lion King&quot;, for instance, garnered nearly $1 billion following its release in the summer of 1994 and was the second-highest-grossing film of the year. Despite this, Disney experienced a marked decline in profits beginning in the late 1990s as it expanded into lower-grossing, though still profitable direct-to-video spin-offs and sequels.

Disney was concerned about Jeffrey Katzenberg taking too much credit for the success of Disney&#x27;s early 1990s releases. When Frank Wells died in a helicopter crash in 1994, Michael Eisner refused to promote Katzenberg to the vacated position of president. Eisner recalled, &quot;Roy [Walt Disney&#x27;s nephew and a force on Disney&#x27;s board who Eisner says &quot;could be a troublemaker&quot;], who did not like him at all — I forget the reason, but Jeffrey probably did not treat him the way that Roy would have wanted to be treated — said to me, &#x27;If you make him the president, I will start a proxy fight.&#x27;&quot; Tensions between Katzenberg, Eisner and Disney resulted in Katzenberg&#x27;s resignation from the company that October. Katzenberg launched a lawsuit against Disney to recover money he felt he was owed and settled out of court for an estimated $250 million.

On October 16, 1998, in a surprise presentation made at the newly unveiled Disney Legends Plaza at the company&#x27;s headquarters, Eisner presented Disney with the Disney Legends Award. Disney&#x27;s pet project was the film &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;, a sequel to his uncle&#x27;s 1940 animated movie &quot;Fantasia&quot;. Walt Disney had planned a sequel to the original movie, but it was not finally released until December 17, 1999, after nine years of production under Disney. Like its predecessor, the film combined high-quality contemporary animation and classical music, but also suffered at the US box office.

===Second &quot;Save Disney&quot; campaign (2003–2005)===
After relations with Eisner began to sour, Disney&#x27;s influence began to wane as important executive posts were filled by those friendly to Eisner. When the board of directors rejected Disney&#x27;s request for an extension of his term as a member, he announced his resignation on November 30, 2003, citing &quot;serious differences of opinion about the direction and style of management&quot; in the company. He issued a letter criticizing Eisner&#x27;s alleged mismanagement, neglect of the studio&#x27;s animation division, failures with ABC, timidity in the theme-park business, corporate mentality in the executive structure turning the Walt Disney Company into a &quot;rapacious, soul-less&quot; conglomerate, and refusal to establish a clear succession plan.

After his resignation, Disney helped establish the website SaveDisney.com, intended to oust Michael Eisner and his supporters from their positions and revamp the Walt Disney Company. On March 3, 2004, at the company&#x27;s annual shareholders&#x27; meeting, a surprising 43% of shareholders, predominantly rallied by Disney and fellow former board member Stanley Gold, voted to oppose the re-election of Eisner to the corporate board of directors. This vigorous opposition, unusual in major public corporations, persuaded the board to replace Eisner as chairman with George J. Mitchell; he did, however, remain as chief executive. This &quot;Save Disney&quot; campaign regarded Mitchell himself unfavorably, and in the same election, 25% of shareholders opposed Mitchell&#x27;s re-election to the board.

As criticism of Eisner intensified in the wake of the shareholder meeting, his position became increasingly tenuous, culminating on March 13, 2005, with the announcement of Eisner&#x27;s resignation as CEO effective September 30, one year before his contract would expire. On July 8, Roy and the Walt Disney Company agreed to &quot;put aside their differences.&quot; Roy rejoined the board as a nonvoting director emeritus and consultant. Roy and Gold consequently shut down their SaveDisney.com website effective August 7 that year.

As announced, on September 30, Eisner resigned as both chief executive and a member of the board. Severing all formal ties with the company, he waived his contractual rights to perks such as use of a corporate jet, a Gold Pass, and an office at the company&#x27;s Burbank headquarters. Bob Iger, Eisner&#x27;s long-time lieutenant who had been effectively running the company, now assumed the title of CEO. One of Roy Disney&#x27;s stated reasons for engineering his second &quot;Save Disney&quot; initiative had been Eisner&#x27;s well-publicized disputes with long-time production partner Pixar Animation Studios and its CEO Steve Jobs, with whom Disney had produced such animated hits as &quot;Toy Story&quot;, &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, and &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, which were critically acclaimed and financially successful for both partners. Iger quickly repaired the estrangement, and on January 24, 2006, the company announced the acquisition of Pixar in an all-stock deal worth $7.4 billion. This deal made Jobs, best known as co-founder and CEO of Apple, Inc, Disney&#x27;s largest shareholder with 7% of all outstanding shares and gave him a new seat on Disney&#x27;s board of directors. Eisner, who retained 1.7% of shares, became Disney&#x27;s second-largest shareholder, followed by Roy Disney, with 1% of shares. Disney&#x27;s second &quot;Save Disney&quot; campaign against Eisner was chronicled by James B. Stewart in his best-selling book &quot;DisneyWar&quot;.

==Personal life==
Disney held several sailing speed records, including the Los Angeles to Honolulu monohull time record. He set it on his boat &quot;Pyewacket&quot; in July 1999 (7 days, 11 hours, 41 minutes, 27 seconds).

On January 19, 2007, after beginning a relationship with Leslie DeMeuse, Disney (then 77 years old) filed for divorce from his wife, Patricia (then 72), citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;, according to court documents. The couple, married 52 years, had been living apart, according to the Los Angeles County Superior Court filing. They had four adult children, Abigail Disney, Susan Disney Lord, Tim Disney (a documentary film producer), and Roy Patrick Disney (step-father of Charlee Corra).

In 2008, Disney married DeMeuse, a CSTV producer, and Emmy winner of various sailing documentaries.

==Death==

Disney died of stomach cancer on December 16, 2009, 43 years after his uncle died, and 4 days shy of 38 years after his father&#x27;s death, at Hoag Memorial Hospital in Newport Beach, California. He was 79 years old, and had been battling the disease for over a year. He was cremated after his funeral service, and his ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean.

==Honors==
On January 4, 1998, Pope John Paul II made Disney a Knight Commander of the Pontifical Order of St. Gregory the Great.

On January 1, 2000, Disney participated as the grand marshal of the 111th Rose Parade.

On April 26, 2008, Disney received an honorary doctorate from the California Maritime Academy &quot;for his many contributions to the state and the nation, including international sailing.&quot;

The animation studio building at the Walt Disney Studios, in Burbank, California, was rededicated as the &quot;Roy E. Disney Animation Building&quot; on May 7, 2010.

<doc id="165113" wikidata="Q294531" url="?curid=165113" title="Neil Diamond">
<text>Neil Leslie Diamond (born January 24, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter. He has sold more than 130 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. 

He has written and recorded ten singles that reached No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts: &quot;Cracklin&#x27; Rosie&quot;, &quot;Song Sung Blue&quot;, &quot;Longfellow Serenade&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Been This Way Before&quot;, &quot;If You Know What I Mean&quot;, &quot;Desirée&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Bring Me Flowers&quot; (which he co-wrote with Marilyn Bergman and performed with Barbra Streisand), &quot;America&quot;, &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Songs&quot;, and &quot;Heartlight (co-written with Carole Bayer Sager and Burt Bacharach). A total of thirty-eight songs by Diamond have reached the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary charts, including &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot;. He has also acted in films, making his screen debut in the 1980 musical drama film &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;.

Diamond was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1984 and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011, and he received the Sammy Cahn Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000. In 2011, he was an honoree at the Kennedy Center Honors, and he received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2018.

==Early life and education==
Diamond was born in Brooklyn, New York City, to a Jewish family. All four of his grandparents were immigrants, from Poland on his father&#x27;s side and Russia on his mother&#x27;s. His parents were Rose (&quot;née&quot; Rapoport; 1918–2019) and Akeeba &quot;Kieve&quot; Diamond (1917–1985), a dry-goods merchant. He grew up in several homes in Brooklyn, having also spent four years in Cheyenne, Wyoming, where his father was stationed in the army. In Brooklyn, he attended Erasmus Hall High School and was a member of the Freshman Chorus and Choral Club, along with classmate Barbra Streisand. 

Diamond recalled they were not close friends at the time: &quot;We were two poor kids in Brooklyn. We hung out in the front of Erasmus High and smoked cigarettes.&quot; Also in their class was chess grandmaster Bobby Fischer. After his family moved to Brighton Beach, he attended Abraham Lincoln High School and was a member of the fencing team. Also on the team was his best friend, future Olympic fencer Herb Cohen.

For his 16th birthday, he received his first guitar. When he was 16 and still in high school, Diamond spent a number of weeks at Surprise Lake Camp, a camp in upstate New York for Jewish children, when folk singer Pete Seeger performed a small concert. Seeing the widely recognized singer perform, and watching other children singing songs for Seeger that they wrote themselves, had an immediate effect on Diamond, who then became aware of the possibility of writing his own songs. &quot;And the next thing, I got a guitar when we got back to Brooklyn, started to take lessons and almost immediately began to write songs&quot;, he said. He added that his attraction to songwriting was the &quot;first real interest&quot; he had growing up, while also helping him release his youthful &quot;frustrations&quot;.

Diamond also used his newly developed skill to write poetry. By writing poems for girls he was attracted to in school, he soon learned it often won their hearts. His male classmates took note and began asking him to write poems for them, which they would sing and use with equal success. He spent the summer after graduation working as a waiter in the Catskills resort area. There he first met Jaye Posner, who would years later become his wife.

Diamond next attended New York University as a pre-med major on a fencing scholarship, again on the fencing team with Herb Cohen. He was a member of the 1960 NCAA men&#x27;s championship fencing team. Often bored in class, he found writing song lyrics more to his liking. He began cutting classes and taking the train up to Tin Pan Alley, where he tried to get some of his songs heard by local music publishers. In his senior year, when he was just 10 units short of graduation, Sunbeam Music Publishing offered him a 16-week job writing songs for $50 a week (equivalent to about $ per week, in ), and he dropped out of college to accept it.

==Career==

===1960s===
Diamond was not rehired after his 16 weeks with Sunbeam, and he began writing and singing his own songs for demos. &quot;I never really chose songwriting&quot;, he says. &quot;It just absorbed me and became more and more important in my life.&quot; His first recording contract was billed as &quot;Neil and Jack&quot;, an Everly Brothers-type duet with high school friend Jack Packer. They recorded the unsuccessful singles &quot;You Are My Love at Last&quot; with &quot;What Will I Do&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid&quot; with &quot;Till You&#x27;ve Tried Love&quot;, both records released in 1962. &quot;Cashbox&quot; and &quot;Billboard&quot; magazines gave all four sides positive reviews, and Diamond signed with Columbia Records as a solo performer later in 1962. In July 1963, Columbia released the single &quot;Clown Town&quot; / &quot;At Night&quot;; &quot;Billboard&quot; gave a laudatory review to &quot;Clown Town&quot;, and &quot;Cashbox&quot; was complimentary to both sides, but it still failed to make the charts. Columbia dropped him from their label and he went back to writing songs in and out of publishing houses for the next seven years.

Diamond wrote wherever he could, including on buses, and used an upright piano above the Birdland Club in New York City. One of the causes of this early nomadic life as a songwriter was his songs&#x27; wordiness: &quot;I&#x27;d spent a lot of time on lyrics, and they were looking for hooks, and I didn&#x27;t really understand the nature of that&quot;, he says. He was able to sell only about one song a week during those years, barely enough to survive. He found himself only earning enough to spend 35 cents a day on food (equivalent to $ in ). But the privacy that he had above the Birdland Club allowed him to focus on writing without distractions. &quot;Something new began to happen. I wasn&#x27;t under the gun, and suddenly interesting songs began to happen, songs that had things none of the others did.&quot; Among them were &quot;Cherry, Cherry&quot; and &quot;Solitary Man&quot;. &quot;Solitary Man&quot; was the first record that Diamond recorded under his own name which made the charts. It remains one of his personal favorites, as it was about his early years as a songwriter, even though he failed to realize it at the time. He describes the song as &quot;an outgrowth of my despair&quot;.

Diamond spent his early career in the Brill Building. His first success as a songwriter came in November 1965 with &quot;Sunday and Me&quot;, a Top 20 hit for Jay and the Americans. Greater success followed with &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot;; &quot;A Little Bit Me, a Little Bit You&quot;; &quot;Look Out (Here Comes Tomorrow)&quot;; and &quot;Love to Love&quot;, all performed by the Monkees. He wrote and recorded the songs for himself, but the other versions were released before his own. The unintended consequence was that Diamond began to gain fame as a songwriter. &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot; became a gold record within two days of its release and stayed at the top of the charts for seven weeks, making it the Popular Music Song of the Year in 1966.

&quot;And the Grass Won&#x27;t Pay No Mind&quot; brought covers from Elvis Presley (who also interpreted &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot;) and Mark Lindsay, former lead singer for Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders. Other notable artists who recorded his early songs were Lulu, Cliff Richard and the English hard-rock band Deep Purple.

In 1966, Diamond signed a deal with Bert Berns&#x27;s Bang Records, then a subsidiary of Atlantic. His first release on that label was &quot;Solitary Man&quot;, which was his first true hit as a solo artist. Diamond followed with &quot;Cherry, Cherry&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Woman&quot;. His early concerts featured him opening for bands such as Herman&#x27;s Hermits and the Who. As a guest performer with The Who, he was shocked to see Pete Townshend swinging his guitar like a club and then throwing it against walls and off the stage until the instrument&#x27;s neck broke.

Diamond began to feel restricted by Bang Records because he wanted to record more ambitious, introspective music, such as &quot;Brooklyn Roads&quot;, starting in 1968. Berns wanted to release &quot;Kentucky Woman&quot; as a single, but Diamond was no longer satisfied writing simple pop songs, so he proposed &quot;Shilo&quot; about an imaginary childhood friend. Bang believed that the song was not commercial enough, so it was relegated to being an LP track on &quot;Just for You&quot;. Diamond was also dissatisfied with his royalties and tried to sign with another record label after discovering a loophole in his contract that did not bind him exclusively to either WEB IV or Tallyrand, but the result was a series of lawsuits that coincided with a slump in his record sales and professional success. A magistrate refused WEB IV&#x27;s request for a temporary injunction to prevent Diamond from joining another record company while his contract dispute continued in court, but the lawsuits persisted until February 1977, when he triumphed in court and purchased the rights to his Bang-era master tapes.

In March 1968, Diamond signed a deal with Uni Records; the label was named after Universal Pictures, the owner of which, MCA Inc., later consolidated its labels into MCA Records (now called Universal Music after merging with PolyGram in 1999). His debut album for Uni/MCA was in late 1968 with &quot;Velvet Gloves and Spit&quot;, produced by Tom Catalano, which did not chart, and he recorded the early 1969 follow-up &quot;Brother Love&#x27;s Traveling Salvation Show&quot; at American Sound Studios in Memphis with Tommy Cogbill and Chips Moman producing.

===1970s===
In mid 1969, Diamond moved to Los Angeles. His sound mellowed with such songs as &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; (1969), &quot;Holly Holy&quot; (1969), &quot;Cracklin&#x27; Rosie&quot; (1970) and &quot;Song Sung Blue&quot; (1972), the last two reaching No. 1 on the Hot 100. &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; was Diamond&#x27;s first major hit after his slump. In 2007, Diamond said he had written &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; for Caroline Kennedy after seeing her on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; in an equestrian riding outfit, but in 2014 he said in an interview on the &quot;Today&quot; show that it was written for his then wife, Marcia. He could not find a good rhyme with the name &quot;Marcia&quot; and so used the name Caroline. It took him just one hour in a Memphis hotel to write and compose it. The 1971 release &quot;I Am...I Said&quot; was a Top 5 hit in both the US and UK and was his most intensely personal effort to date, taking over four months to complete.

In 1971, Diamond played seven sold-out concerts at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles. The outdoor theater, which was noted for showcasing the best of current entertainers, added a stereo sound system for the first time. Diamond was also backed by a 35-piece string orchestra and six backing singers. After the first night, one leading newspaper called it &quot;the finest concert in Greek Theater history.&quot;

In August 1972, he played again at the Greek, this time doing ten shows. When the show was first announced, tickets at the 5000-seat theater sold out rapidly. He added a quadraphonic sound system for his performance to create full surround sound. The performance of August 24, 1972, was recorded and released as the live double album &quot;Hot August Night&quot;. Diamond recalled: &quot;&quot;Hot August Night&quot; captures a very special show for me. We went all out to really knock &#x27;em dead in LA.&quot; Many consider it his best work; critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine called &quot;Hot August Night&quot; &quot;the ultimate Neil Diamond record... [showing] Diamond the icon in full glory.&quot; The album became a classic, and was remastered in 2000 with additional selections. In Australia, which at the time was said to have the most Neil Diamond fans per capita of any country, the album ranked No. 1 for 29 weeks and stayed in their top 20 bestsellers for two years.

In the fall of 1972, Diamond performed for 20 consecutive nights at the Winter Garden Theater in New York City. That theater had not staged a one-man show since Al Jolson in the 1930s. The approximately 1,600-seat Broadway venue provided an intimate concert setting not common at the time, with every performance reportedly sold out. It also made Diamond the first rock-era star to headline on Broadway. The review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated:
After the Winter Garden shows, Diamond announced that he needed a break, and he engaged in no live performances until 1976. He used those four years to work on the score for Hall Bartlett&#x27;s film version of Richard Bach&#x27;s &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot; and to record two albums, &quot;Serenade&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Noise&quot;. He said years later, &quot;I knew I&#x27;d come back, but I wasn&#x27;t sure when. I spent one year on each of those albums...I&#x27;d been on the road six years. I had a son 2½ and I felt he needed me more than the audience did. So for four years I devoted myself to my son Jesse.&quot; He also said he needed to get back to having a private life, one where he could be anonymous.

In 1973, Diamond switched labels again, returning to Columbia Records for a million-dollar-advance-per-album contract (about $ million per album in ). His first project, released as a solo album, was the soundtrack to &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot;. The film received hostile reviews and did poorly at the box office, and the album grossed more than the film did. Richard Bach, author of the best-selling source story, disowned the film, and he and Diamond sued Bartlett, though for differing reasons; in Bach&#x27;s case, it was because he felt the film omitted too much from the original novella, whereas in Diamond&#x27;s case, it was because he felt the film had butchered his score. &quot;After &#x27;Jonathan,&#x27;&quot; Diamond declared, &quot;I vowed never to get involved in a movie again unless I had complete control.&quot; Bartlett angrily responded to Diamond&#x27;s lawsuit by criticizing his music as having become &quot;too slick...and it&#x27;s not as much from his heart as it used to be.&quot; Bartlett also added, &quot;Neil is extraordinarily talented. Often his arrogance is just a cover for the lonely and insecure person underneath.&quot;

Despite the controversy surrounding the film, the soundtrack was a success, peaking at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart. Diamond also won a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and a Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture. Thereafter, Diamond often included a &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot; suite in his live performances, as he did in his 1976 &quot;Love at the Greek&quot; concert and for his show in Las Vegas that same year.

Diamond returned to live shows in 1976 with an Australian tour, &quot;The &#x27;Thank You Australia&#x27; Concert&quot;, which was broadcast to 36 television outlets nationwide. He also again appeared at the Greek Theater in a 1976 concert, &quot;Love at the Greek&quot;. An album and accompanying video/DVD of the show includes a version of &quot;Song Sung Blue&quot; with duets with Helen Reddy and Henry Winkler, a.k.a. Arthur &quot;The Fonz&quot; Fonzarelli of &quot;Happy Days&quot;.

He began wearing colorful beaded shirts in concert, originally so that everyone in the audience could see him without binoculars. Bill Whitten designed and made the shirts for Diamond from the 1970s until approximately 2007.

In 1974, Diamond released the album &quot;Serenade&quot;, from which &quot;Longfellow Serenade&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Been This Way Before&quot; were issued as singles. The latter had been intended for the &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot; score, but Diamond had completed it too late for inclusion. That same year he appeared on a TV special for Shirley Bassey and sang a duet with her.

In 1976, he released &quot;Beautiful Noise&quot;, produced by Robbie Robertson of The Band. On Thanksgiving 1976, Diamond made an appearance at The Band&#x27;s farewell concert, &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;, performing &quot;Dry Your Eyes&quot;, which he wrote jointly with Robertson, and which had appeared on &quot;Beautiful Noise&quot;. He also joined the rest of the performers onstage at the end in a rendition of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot;.

Diamond was paid $650,000 (about $ million in ) by the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, to open its new $10 million Theater For the Performing Arts on July 2, 1976. The show played through July 5 and drew sold-out crowds at the 7,500-seat theater. A &quot;who&#x27;s who&quot; of Hollywood attended opening night, ranging from Elizabeth Taylor to Chevy Chase, and Diamond walked out on stage to a standing ovation. He opened the show with a story about an ex-girlfriend who dumped him before he became successful. His lead-in line to the first song of the evening was, &quot;You may have dumped me a bit too soon, baby, because look who&#x27;s standing here tonight.&quot;

He performed at Woburn Abbey on July 2, 1977, to an audience of 55,000 British fans. The concert and interviews were taped by film director William Friedkin, who used six cameras to capture the performance.

In 1977, Diamond released &quot;I&#x27;m Glad You&#x27;re Here with Me Tonight&quot;, including &quot;You Don&#x27;t Bring Me Flowers&quot;, for which he composed the music and on the writing of whose lyrics he collaborated with Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman. Barbra Streisand covered the song on her album &quot;Songbird&quot;, and later, a Diamond-Streisand duet was recorded, spurred by the success of radio mash-ups. That version hit No. 1 in 1978, his third song to top the Hot 100. They appeared unannounced at the 1980 Grammy awards ceremony, where they performed the song to a surprised and rapturous audience.

His last 1970s album was &quot;September Morn&quot;, which included a new version of &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot;. It and &quot;Red Red Wine&quot; are his best-known original songs made more famous by other artists. In February 1979, the uptempo &quot;Forever in Blue Jeans&quot;, co-written and jointly composed with his guitarist, Richard Bennett, was released as a single from &quot;You Don&#x27;t Bring Me Flowers&quot;, Diamond&#x27;s album from the previous year.

In 1979, Diamond collapsed on stage in San Francisco and was taken to the hospital, where he endured a 12-hour operation to remove what turned out to be a tumor on his spine.&lt;ref name=&quot;juke/ref&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He said he had been losing feeling in his right leg &quot;for a number of years but ignored it&quot;. When he collapsed, he had no strength in either leg. He underwent a long rehabilitation process just before starting principal photography on his film &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1980). He was so convinced he was going to die that he wrote farewell letters to his friends.

===1980s===
A planned film version of &quot;You Don&#x27;t Bring Me Flowers&quot; to star Diamond and Streisand fell through when Diamond instead starred in a 1980 remake of the Al Jolson classic &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; alongside Laurence Olivier and Lucie Arnaz. Though the movie received poor reviews, the soundtrack spawned three top-10 singles, &quot;Love on the Rocks&quot;, &quot;Hello Again&quot;, and &quot;America&quot;, the last of which has emotional significance for Diamond. &quot;&#x27;America&#x27; was the story of my grandparents,&quot; he told an interviewer. &quot;It&#x27;s my gift to them, and it&#x27;s very real for me ... In a way, it speaks to the immigrant in all of us.&quot; The song was performed in full by Diamond during the film&#x27;s finale. An abbreviated version played over the film&#x27;s opening titles.

The song was also the one he was most proud of, partly because of when it was later used: national news shows played it when the hostages were shown returning home after the Iran hostage crisis ended; it was played on the air during the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty; and at a tribute to slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., as well as the Vietnam Vets Welcome Home concert, he was asked to perform it live. At the time, a national poll found the song to be the number-one most recognized song about America, more than &quot;God Bless America&quot;. It also became the anthem of his world tour two weeks after the attacks on America on September 11, 2001, when he changed the lyric at the end from; &quot;They&#x27;re coming to America&quot;, to &quot;Stand up for America!&quot; Earlier that year he performed it after a request from former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali.

The film&#x27;s failure was due in part to Diamond never having acted professionally before. &quot;I didn&#x27;t think I could handle it,&quot; he said later, seeing himself as &quot;a fish out of water&quot;. For his performance, Diamond became the first-ever winner of a Worst Actor Razzie Award, even though he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for the same role. Critic David Wild noted that the film showed that Diamond was open about his religion: &quot;Who else but this Jewish Elvis could go multi-platinum with an album that featured a version of &#x27;the Kol Nidre?&#x27;&quot; Diamond later told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;For me, this was the ultimate bar mitzvah.&quot;

Another Top 10 selection, &quot;Heartlight&quot;, was inspired by the blockbuster 1982 movie &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;. Though the film&#x27;s title character is never mentioned in the lyrics, Universal Pictures, which had released &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; and was the parent company of the Uni Records label (by then called MCA Records), for which Diamond had recorded for years, briefly threatened legal action against both Diamond and Columbia Records.

Diamond&#x27;s record sales slumped somewhat in the 1980s and 1990s, his last single to make the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Singles chart coming in 1986, but his concert tours continued to be big draws. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked Diamond as the most profitable solo performer of 1986. He released his 17th studio album in 1986, &quot;Headed for the Future&quot;, which reached number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Three weeks later he starred in &quot;Hello Again&quot;, his first television special in nine years, performing comedy sketches and a duo medley with Carol Burnett.

In January 1987, Diamond sang the national anthem at the Super Bowl. His &quot;America&quot; became the theme song for the Michael Dukakis 1988 presidential campaign. That same year, British band UB40&#x27;s reggae interpretation of Diamond&#x27;s ballad &quot;Red Red Wine&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Singles chart and like the Monkees&#x27; version of &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot;, became better known than Diamond&#x27;s original version.

===1990s===
During the 1990s, Diamond produced six studio albums. He covered many classic songs from the movies and from famous Brill Building-era songwriters. He also released two Christmas albums, the first of which peaked at No. 8 on Billboard&#x27;s Album chart. Diamond also recorded two albums of mostly new material during this period. In 1992, he performed for President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s final &quot;Christmas in Washington&quot; NBC special. In 1993, Diamond opened the Mark of the Quad Cities (now the iWireless Center) with two shows on May 27 and 28 to a crowd of 27,000-plus.

The 1990s saw a resurgence in Diamond&#x27;s popularity. &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; became a popular sing-along at sporting events. It was used at Boston College football and basketball games. College sporting events in other states also played it, and it was even played at sports events in other countries, such as a Hong Kong Sevens rugby tournament or a soccer match in Northern Ireland. It is played at every home game of the Sydney Swans of the Australian Football League. It became the theme song of Red Sox Nation, the fans of the Boston Red Sox.

The New York Rangers also adapted it as their own and played it whenever they were winning at the end of the third period of their games. The Pittsburgh Panthers football team also played it after the third quarter of all home games, with the crowd cheering, &quot;Let&#x27;s go Pitt&quot;. The Carolina Panthers played it at the end of every home game they won. The Davidson College pep band likewise played it in the second half of every Davidson Wildcats men&#x27;s basketball home game.

===2000s===

A more severely stripped-down-to-basics album, &quot;12 Songs&quot;, produced by Rick Rubin, was released on November 8, 2005, in two editions: a standard 12-song release, and a special edition with two bonus tracks, including one featuring backing vocals by Brian Wilson. The album debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard chart, and received generally positive reviews; Erlewine describes the album as &quot;inarguably Neil Diamond&#x27;s best set of songs in a long, long time.&quot; &quot;12 Songs&quot; also became noteworthy as one of the last albums to be pressed and released by Sony BMG with the Extended Copy Protection software embedded in the disc. (See the 2005 Sony BMG CD copy protection scandal.)

In 2007, Diamond was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame.

On March 19, 2008, it was announced on the television show &quot;American Idol&quot; that Diamond would be a guest mentor to the remaining &quot;Idol&quot; contestants, who would sing Diamond songs for the broadcasts of April 29 and 30, 2008. On the April 30 broadcast, Diamond premiered a new song, &quot;Pretty Amazing Grace&quot;, from his then recently released album &quot;Home Before Dark&quot;. On May 2, 2008, Sirius Satellite Radio started Neil Diamond Radio. On April 8, 2008, Diamond made a surprise announcement in a big-screen broadcast at Fenway Park that he would be appearing there &quot;live in concert&quot; on August 23, 2008, as part of his world tour. The announcement, which marked the first official confirmation of any 2008 concert dates in the US, came during the traditional eighth-inning singalong of &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot;, which had by that time become an anthem for Boston fans.

On April 28, 2008, Diamond appeared on the roof of the Jimmy Kimmel building to sing &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; after Kimmel, who had been singing the song dressed as Diamond, was &quot;arrested&quot; for impersonating the singer.
&quot;Home Before Dark&quot; was released May 6, 2008, and topped the album charts in New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States.

On June 29, 2008, Diamond played to an estimated 108,000 fans at the Glastonbury Festival in Somerset, England on the Concert of a Lifetime Tour; technical problems, including the sound cutting out, marred the concert. In August, Diamond allowed cameras to record his entire four-night run at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden; he released the resulting DVD in the US in 2009, one year to the day of the first concert. &quot;Hot August Night/NYC&quot; debuted at No. 2 on the charts. On the same day the DVD was released, CBS aired an edited version, which won the ratings hour with 13 million viewers. The next day, the sales of the DVD surged, prompting Sony to order more copies to meet the high demand.

On August 25, 2008, Diamond performed at The Ohio State University while suffering from laryngitis. The result disappointed him as well as his fans, and on August 26, he offered refunds to anyone who applied by September 5.

Diamond was honored as the MusiCares Person of the Year on February 6, 2009, two nights before the 51st Annual Grammy Awards.

Long loved in Boston, Diamond was invited to sing at the July 4, 2009, Independence Day celebration.

On October 13, 2009, he released &quot;A Cherry Cherry Christmas&quot;, his third album of holiday music.

===2010s===

On November 2, 2010, Diamond released the album &quot;Dreams&quot;, a collection of 14 interpretations of his favorite songs by artists from the rock era. The album also included a new slow-tempo arrangement of his &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot;. In December, he performed a track from the album, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine&quot;, on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Sing-Off&quot; with Committed and Street Corner Symphony, two a cappella groups featured on the show. &quot;The Very Best of Neil Diamond&quot;, a compilation CD of Diamond&#x27;s 23 studio recordings from the Bang, UNI/MCA, &amp; Columbia catalogs, was released on December 6, 2011, on the Sony Legacy label.

The years 2011 and 2012 were marked by several milestones in Diamond&#x27;s career. On March 14, 2011, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at a ceremony at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. In December, he received a lifetime achievement award from the Kennedy Center at the 2011 Kennedy Center Honors. On August 10, 2012, Diamond received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In November 2012, he topped the bill at the centenary edition of the Royal Variety Performance in the UK, which was transmitted on December 3. He also appeared in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade.

On April 20, 2013, Diamond made an unannounced appearance at Fenway Park to sing &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; during the 8th inning. It was the first game at Fenway since the Boston Marathon bombing. On July 2, he released the single &quot;Freedom Song (They&#x27;ll Never Take Us Down)&quot;, with 100% of the purchase price benefiting One Fund Boston and the Wounded Warrior Project. Sporting a beard, Diamond performed live on the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol as part of &quot;A Capitol Fourth&quot;, which was broadcast nationally by PBS on July 4, 2013.

In January 2014, it was confirmed that Diamond had signed with the Capitol Music Group unit of Universal Music Group, which also owned Diamond&#x27;s Uni/MCA catalog. UMG also took over Diamond&#x27;s Columbia and Bang catalogues, which meant that all of his recorded output would be consolidated for the first time.

On July 8, 2014, Capitol Records announced, via a flyer included with Diamond&#x27;s latest greatest hits compilations, &quot;All-Time Greatest Hits&quot;, which charted at 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, that his next album, &quot;Melody Road&quot;, which was to be produced by Don Was and Jacknife Lee, would be released on September 30, 2014. In August, the release date was moved to October 21.

In September 2014, Diamond performed a surprise concert at his alma mater, Erasmus High School in Brooklyn. The show was announced via Twitter that afternoon. On the same day, he announced a 2015 &quot;Melody Road&quot; World Tour. The North American leg of the World Tour 2015 launched with a concert in Allentown, PA at the PPL Center on February 27 and ended at the Pepsi Center in Denver, Colorado on May 31, 2015. Diamond used new media platforms and social media extensively throughout the tour, streaming several shows live on Periscope and showing tweets from fans who used the hashtag #tweetcaroline on two large screens. &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; wrote: &quot;This, my friends, wasn&#x27;t your grandfather&#x27;s Neil Diamond concert. It was a multimedia extravaganza. Twitter. Periscope...It was a social media blitzkrieg that, by all accounts, proved to be an innovative way to widen his fan base.&quot;

In October 2016, Diamond released &quot;Acoustic Christmas&quot;, a folk-inspired Christmas album of original songs as well as acoustic versions of holiday classics. Produced by Was and Lee, who had produced &quot;Melody Road&quot;, the idea for the album began to take shape as the &quot;Melody Road&quot; sessions ended. To &quot;channel the intimate atmosphere of &#x27;60s folk, Diamond recorded &quot;Acoustic Christmas&quot; with a handful of musicians, sitting around a circle of microphones, wires and, of course, Christmas lights.&quot;

In March 2017, the career-spanning anthology &quot;Neil Diamond 50 – 50th Anniversary Collection&quot; was released. He began his final concert tour, the 50 Year Anniversary World Tour in Fresno, California, in April.

In 2019, his 1969 signature song &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

=== 2020s ===
On March 7, 2020, despite his retirement due to Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Diamond gave a rare performance at the Keep Memory Alive Power of Love Gala at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, where he was being honored.

On March 22, 2020, Diamond posted a video to YouTube playing &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; with slightly modified lyrics (&quot;...washing hands, don&#x27;t touch me, I won&#x27;t touch you...&quot;) in response to the widespread social distancing measures implemented due to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.

In April 2021, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;A Beautiful Noise&quot;, a musical based on Diamond&#x27;s life and featuring his songs, would open at the Emerson Colonial Theater in Boston in the summer of 2022. The musical was scheduled to open on Broadway following the month-long run in Boston.

Universal Music Group acquired Diamond&#x27;s songwriting catalog and the rights to his Bang Records, Columbia Records, and Capitol recordings in February 2022. The acquisition also included 110 unreleased tracks, an unreleased album and archival videos.

On June 18, 2022, Diamond sang &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; during the 8th-inning stretch of a Red Sox game at Fenway Park. In a surprise appearance, he was joined by Will Swenson, who portrays Diamond in the musical &quot;A Beautiful Noise&quot;.

==Retirement from touring==
In January 2018, Diamond announced that he would stop touring after he was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Tour dates on the final leg of Diamond&#x27;s &quot;50 Year Anniversary World Tour&quot; in Australia and New Zealand were cancelled. An announcement on his official website said he was not retiring from music and that the cancellation of the live performances would allow him to &quot;continue his writing, recording and development of new projects.&quot;

On July 28, 2018, Diamond and his wife, Katie, made a surprise visit to the Incident Command post in Basalt, Colorado, near Diamond&#x27;s home, to thank firefighters and their families for efforts to contain the Lake Christine Fire, which began on July 3 and scorched . Diamond performed a solo acoustic guitar concert in their honor.

==In popular culture==
In 1967, Diamond was featured on the fourth episode of the detective drama &quot;Mannix&quot; as the &#x27;featured&#x27; artist in a small underground club called &#x27;The Bad Scene&#x27; and was interrupted during his singing by one of many fights that took place weekly on the show.

In 2000, Neil Diamond appeared onstage with a Diamond tribute band, Super Diamond, surprising them before their show at House of Blues in Los Angeles.

In the 2001 comedy film &quot;Saving Silverman&quot;, the main characters play in a Diamond cover band; Diamond made an extended cameo appearance as himself. Diamond even wrote and composed a new song, &quot;I Believe in Happy Endings&quot;, for the film. He sat in with the tribute band Super Diamond at the film&#x27;s premiere party.

In recent times, fans of the England national football team sing Sweet Caroline since Tony Parry (Wembley DJ) played it after England had defeated Germany at Wembley in Euro 2020. He said &quot;I thought Sweet Caroline went slightly better than Three Lions in the post-match sing-song.&quot;

==Personal life==

Diamond has been married three times. In 1963, he married his high-school sweetheart, Jaye Posner, who had become a schoolteacher. They had two daughters. The couple separated in 1967 and divorced in 1969.

On December 5, 1969, Diamond married production assistant Marcia Murphey. They had two sons. The marriage ended in 1994 or 1995.

In 1996, Diamond began a relationship with Australian Rae Farley after the two met in Brisbane, Australia. The songs on &quot;Home Before Dark&quot; were written and composed during his struggle with chronic back pain.

On September 7, 2011, in a message on Twitter, the 70-year-old Diamond announced his engagement to the 41-year-old Katie McNeil. The couple married in front of family and close friends in Los Angeles in 2012. In addition to serving as Diamond&#x27;s manager, McNeil produced the documentary &quot;Neil Diamond: Hot August Nights NYC&quot;. Diamond said that his 2014 album &quot;Melody Road&quot; was fueled by their relationship, explaining:

There&#x27;s no better inspiration or motivation for work than being in love. It&#x27;s what you dream of as a creative person. I was able to complete this album—start it, write it and complete it—under the spell of love, and I think it shows somehow.&lt;ref name=&quot;BB/Melody Road&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>Amanda Kay Levens (born January 24, 1979) is an American women&#x27;s college basketball coach. She is currently the head coach at the University of Nevada. Previously, she was hired as head coach at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) in 2008, when the school began a five-year transition to the NCAA&#x27;s Division I. From 2012 to 2017, she was associate head coach at Arizona State before being hired at Nevada as head coach.

==Early life and education==
Born in Belvidere, Illinois, Levens graduated from Belvidere High School in 1997. At Belvidere High, she was a three-time All State and Amateur Athletic Union All-American honoree in basketball.

In the fall of 1997, Levens enrolled at Old Dominion University and began playing at point guard for the Old Dominion Monarchs. In her first season in 1997–98, Levens played in 29 games and averaged 3.1 points as Old Dominion made a run to the Sweet 16 round of the 1998 NCAA tournament. Then in 1998–99, Levens started 23 of 32 games, averaging 21.0 minutes and 6.7 points. Old Dominion made a second straight Sweet 16 appearance in the 1999 NCAA Tournament.

After two seasons at Old Dominion, Levens transferred to Arizona State University, where she was a star member of the Sun Devils. At Arizona State, she broke the school&#x27;s season records for most three-point shots made, with 60 in 2001 and free throws, with 167 in 2002. In her Arizona State career, Levens scored 1,020 points, an average of 15.9 points per game; dished out 240 assists, a 3.8 per game average; and recovered 218 rebounds for 3.4 per game. In both seasons at ASU, she was a member of the All Pac-10 First Team, and she received an honorable mention on the 2002 Associated Press All-America Team. After graduating from Arizona State with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history, Levens signed a free agent contract with the Charlotte Sting of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association, but she was released before the regular season began.
In 2007 she earned her master&#x27;s degree in educational leadership from Nevada.

==Coaching career==

===Nevada assistant (2003–2008)===

From 2003 to 2008, Levens was an assistant coach for the women&#x27;s basketball program headed by Kim Gervasoni at the University of Nevada.

===SIU Edwardsville (2008–2012)===

In April 2008, she was selected as the fourth head coach of the SIU Edwardsville Cougars.
SIUE joined the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) in 2008 and played its first full conference schedule in the 2011–12 season. Prior to that first season, Leven&#x27;s Cougars were picked by the league&#x27;s coaches to finish eighth of the eleven teams. After SIUE finished the season in third place, with a conference record of 12 wins and 4 losses, Levens was named the 2012 Ohio Valley Conference Women&#x27;s Basketball Coach of the Year. Although the Cougars would not be eligible for OVC or NCAA post-season competition until the 2012–13 season, they were invited to play in the 2012 Women&#x27;s Basketball Invitational (WBI) tournament.

===Arizona State assistant (2012–2017)===
On April 20, 2012, Levens returned to Arizona State as associate head coach under Charli Turner Thorne. During her five-year tenure as the top assistant, Arizona State appeared in the Sweet 16 of the 2015 NCAA tournament and won the 2015–16 Pac-12 Conference regular season title.

===Nevada (2017–present)===
On March 31, 2017, Levens returned to Nevada to be head coach, following the retirement of Jane Albright.

Inheriting a team that finished 11–19 the previous season, Levens led Nevada to a 19–17 record and appearance in the 2018 Women&#x27;s Basketball Invitational semifinals. The 19 wins were the most for any Nevada first-year head coach in program history. However, with an inexperienced roster with six freshmen and only four experienced returning players, Nevada went 12–19 in 2018–19.

In 2019–20, Nevada improved to 15–16. Then in 2020–21, with the season shortened due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Nevada finished 13–9, including a 9–7 record and fifth place finish in the Mountain West Conference standings, the best under Levens. Nevada improved further in 2021–22 with a 20–13 record, including 11–6 in Mountain West games for a third place tie in conference standings, and an appearance in the 2022 Women&#x27;s Basketball Invitational third place game.

However, the 2022–23 Nevada team had just half as many wins at 10–21, finishing eighth in the Mountain West standings at 6–12 in conference play.

==Personal life==

In 2015, Levens adopted two boys, aged four and three at the time. Levens married Ashley Elliott, an assistant coach on her staff, in 2019.

<doc id="165116" wikidata="Q728177" url="?curid=165116" title="Ealhmund of Kent">
<text>Ealhmund was King of Kent in 784. He was probably the father of King Ecgberht who was King of Wessex from 802, and who conquered Kent in the 820s. Ecgberht was the grandfather of King Alfred the Great.

==Biography==
King Offa of Mercia conquered Kent in the 760s, but he had lost control by the late 770s, when King Ecgberht II issued charters in his own name without any reference to Offa. The only contemporary evidence of Ealhmund is a charter he issued as king of Kent, also without any reference to Offa, in 784. The charter granted land at Sheldwich in Kent to the abbot of Reculver. Ealhmund is not known to have struck any coins, and by 785 Offa had regained control of Kent. Ealhmund had probably been killed or driven out.

==Lineage==
In 802 Ecgberht seized the West Saxon throne, and a genealogy of his son King Æthelwulf, in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; gives Ecgberht&#x27;s father as Ealhmund, whose father is given as Eafa, with a descent going back to Cerdic, the traditional founder of the West Saxon dynasty. The information is repeated in a genealogy based on the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; in Asser&#x27;s life of Alfred the Great, which dates to 893. A late eleventh or early twelfth century Canterbury chronicler identified the father of Ecgberht with the Ealhmund who was king of Kent.

Some scholars accept the claim that Ealhmund was part of a West Saxon lineage, but the historian Heather Edwards argues that a Kentish royal lineage is more likely, and that a West Saxon one was probably invented in order to legitimise Ecgberht&#x27;s seizure of the West Saxon throne. In the 820s Ecgberht annexed south-east England, and the &quot;Chronicle&quot; states that &quot;the people of Kent and of Surrey and the South Saxons and the East Saxons submitted to him because they had been wrongfully forced away from his kinsmen&quot;. Edwards sees this as a statement that Ecgberht was the descendant of a south-eastern ruling family which had been dispossessed by Offa. Ecgberht had been expelled from England in his youth by Offa and Beorhtric, Ecgberht&#x27;s predecessor as king of Wessex. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; states that Beorhtric helped Offa because he was married to his daughter, and Edwards argues that this shows that Ecgberht was a threat to Offa&#x27;s control of Kent, and that Beorhtric had no personal reason to fear him. She also suggests that Ecgberht may have had a special connection with Kent. For instance, after he briefly dethroned Wiglaf of Mercia in 829, Wessex kept control over the southeast, with Ecgberht holding councils in Kent and involving the Kentish nobility in the affairs of the province. Edwards notes that this style of ruling was very different from the Mercian overlords who issued charters relating to Kentish affairs from councils held in Mercia.

The historian Rory Naismith, however, casts doubt on this interpretation. He argues that the identification of Ecgberht&#x27;s father as Ealhmund of Kent may rely solely on the compiler of the MS F (bilingual Old English and Latin version) of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; having had access to Ealhmund&#x27;s charter of 784, and that perhaps Ecgberht&#x27;s father and the Kentish king simply shared the same name. The question is whether the compiler knew of Ealhmund only from the coincidence of the charter and genealogy or if he had access to vanished sources that connected Ecgberht to the royal line of Kent, which he considers unlikely but not impossible.

Naismith notes that Ealhmund and Ecgberht&#x27;s names seem to beckon to previous Kentish rulers, namely Ecgberht I, Ecgberht II and Eadberht III Praen, which corroborates Henry of Huntingdon&#x27;s claim that Ecgberht of Wessex was related to the latter. Indeed, Barbara Yorke speculates that Ealhmund may have been a West Saxon who strengthened his claim through marriage with the Kentish royal house, perhaps with a kinswoman of Ecgberht II, which would account for the Kentish name of his son Ecgberht. Although, in Naismith&#x27;s opinion, Henry&#x27;s testimony is of little independent value and could even be dependent on the conclusions made by the compiler of MS F. Also, &quot;the fluid and widely dissemination of the naming tradition that Ecgberht and his kin drew upon clouds any dynastic affiliation of his name,&quot; as Anglo-Saxon aristocratic families had intermarried each other since at least the 7th century onwards. 

While, he concedes that a forged genealogy could be used to legitimise a dynasty with little concern to biological fact, Naismith argues that the assertion that the people of Kent, Surrey, Sussex and Essex had been forced away from Ecgberht&#x27;s kinsmen may have an alternative explanation more in line with a West Saxon origin. He mentions the reigns of Cædwalla and Ine, who ruled over substantial parts of Southern England, including most or all of the territory taken by Ecgberht in 825. He then points out that Ecgberht&#x27;s heirs have successively referred to their kinship with Ine. His grandson, Æthelred I was buried at Wimborne, a monastery founded by Ine’s sister Cuthburh, and Ine’s laws were part of the material assembled alongside Alfred’s law-code, in the preface to which it was Ine and not Æthelberht I of Kent (whose legislation Alfred asserts he had used), who was called by Alfred &quot;my kinsman&quot;.

Naismith maintains that Ecgberht&#x27;s exile from c. 782 to 802, could be explained by Ecgberht being a scion of both the Kentish and West Saxon royal lines, therefore posing a threat to both Offa and Beorhtric. He states that &quot;had Egbert been a claimant from Kent alone, it is difficult to see why Beorhtric should have played any part in arranging his exile,&quot; and that &quot;the same applies to Offa if Egbert’s origins lay solely in Wessex, unless Beorhtric’s position was far more precarious than the &quot;Chronicle&quot; admits.&quot; Nevertheless, Naismith concludes that the true origins of Ecgberht and his family remain something of a mystery, and as far as the most authoritative surviving sources are concerned, he &quot; was born of good West Saxon royal stock,&quot; for it is probably what the author(s) of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; wished to be believed, and the closest we confidently presume of Ecgberht&#x27;s ancestry.

<text>Mia Rosales St. John (born June 24, 1967) is an American professional boxer and former World Boxing Council (WBC) champion in the super welterweight division. She is also the IBA and IFBA lightweight champion. She is also a model, businesswoman, and taekwondo champion.

== Early life ==
St. John, a Mexican-American with family roots in Zacatecas, Mexico, was born in San Francisco, California. She attended California State University, Northridge, earning a degree in psychology. While a student, she compiled a taekwondo record of 27–1, was awarded a black belt, and worked as a model to fund her education.

She married actor Kristoff St. John. They had two children, son Julian (1989–2014) and daughter Paris. The marriage ended in divorce.

== Professional boxing career ==
At the age of 29, St. John decided to become a professional boxer. In her first bout on February 14, 1997, she knocked out Angelica Villain in 54 seconds of the first round, earning her the nickname &quot;The Knockout.&quot;

St. John, whose first manager was Art Lovett, in partnership with his brother Stewart Lovett, would eventually sign a contract with Don King and then Top Rank Boxing, and was featured on the undercard of Oscar De La Hoya bouts. She had 23 fights and won 22 with one draw, 3 KOs and 9 TKOs. All fights were four-rounders and most were televised gaining her national attention. St. John was crowned the &quot;Queen of the Four-Rounders&quot;, a title she hated. St. John&#x27;s opponents were selected by Top Rank without her input.

After her twentieth bout, St. John was injured in a skiing accident that threatened possible amputation of one of her legs. She underwent two operations to remove a blood clot.

In November 1999, St. John appeared on the cover of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine and in an 11-page pictorial. She wanted to show that she was a feminine woman as well as an athlete. Critical of her career, the boxing press added the term &quot;Busty Bunny Boxer&quot; in describing St. John.

St. John did not renew her contract with Top Rank in 2001, becoming her own manager and promoter. On November 9, 2001, she lost her first fight to Rolanda Andrews with a TKO in the second round, St. John&#x27;s first contest after parting with Top Rank.

=== Eduardo and Roberto Garcia ===
St. John turned to trainers Eduardo and Roberto Garcia to learn proper punching techniques, footwork, and defensive strategies. St. John won her next four bouts, one by TKO.

On December 6, 2002, St. John fought top boxer Christy Martin. Martin had a record of 44 wins, 2 losses, and 2 draws. The press laughed at the match-up and predicted St. John would be knocked out early in the bout. St. John, coming up two weight classes, lost the bout but fought toe-to-toe with Martin all ten rounds for a credible performance.

=== WBC, IFBA and IBA lightweight championships ===
On June 12, 2005, and after 47 professional bouts and 9 years, St. John was given a title bout with Liz Drew. St. John won by unanimous decision, earning the International Female Boxers Association lightweight world title. She followed this win with a unanimous decision over Donna Biggers in August, winning the IBA continental lightweight title.

St. John has fought all over the world, including Beijing, China, where she won her IBA Championship. After accumulating an unheard of boxing record of nearly 60 pro fights, on June 14, 2008, St. John fulfilled her dream of fighting in her mother&#x27;s home country of Mexico. She fought one of the toughest fights of her career and became the WBC international boxing champion of the world at the age of 40.

In November 2008, she was awarded by the Governor of Zacatecas, Mexico, an outstanding achievement award for her role in sports and humanitarianism. The WBC also presented her with the 2008 &quot;WBC Goodwill Ambassador&quot; Award.

In November 2010, Rep. Grace Napolitano joined St. John and LA Laker Ron Artest for an official mental health and suicide prevention training at Napolitano&#x27;s district office in Santa Fe Springs. Artest and St. John have joined Napolitano to promote the Mental Health in Schools Act, legislation she authored which would increase federal funding for mental health therapists in schools.

She also spoke at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, where President Barack Obama made a speech at the CHCI&#x27;s annual Gala.

As well as Congress, St. John speaks in schools and juvenile halls on the importance of education and overcoming hardship. She speaks of her own battles with mental illness, addiction, poverty and overcoming it all, to become a three time international boxing champion.

On August 14, 2012, St. John fought Christy Martin in a long-awaited rematch. Her dream of sixteen years finally materialized and at the age of 45, she captured the WBC super welter weight championship of the world.

On November 10, 2012, St. John was defeated by Tiffany Junot in Bakersfield, California, losing her WBC Female Super Welterweight Championship in a unanimous decision.

On April 14, 2016, St. John had her last boxing bout in New Zealand on the Kali Reis vs. Maricela Cornejo undercard as the curtain call. This was her retirement bout, winning by TKO in the 4th round.

In August 2018, St. John admitted to the use of prohibited substances including steroids and masking agents in preparation for around 20 bouts, stating that &quot;everyone does it and everyone in boxing knows it.&quot;

== MMA career ==
On January 26, 2008, in Honolulu, Hawaii, St. John&#x27;s fighting career took yet another turn. &quot;Returning to her roots&quot; in the martial arts, she competed in her first mixed martial arts (MMA) contest and, with a combination of kicks and punches, defeated her opponent Rhonda Gallegos with a first-round knockout.

<doc id="165119" wikidata="Q1401607" url="?curid=165119" title="Cowardice">
<text>Cowardice is a characteristic wherein excessive fear prevents an individual from taking a risk or facing danger. It is the opposite of courage. As a label, &quot;cowardice&quot; indicates a failure of character in the face of a challenge. One who succumbs to cowardice is known as a coward.

As the opposite of bravery, which many historical and current human societies reward, cowardice is seen as a character flaw that is detrimental to society and thus the failure to face one&#x27;s fear is often stigmatized or punished.

==Etymology==
According to the &quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot;, the word &quot;coward&quot; came into English from the Old French word &quot;coart&quot; (modern French ), which is a combination of the word for &quot;tail&quot; (Modern French &quot;queue&quot;, Latin &quot;cauda&quot;) and an agent noun suffix. It would therefore have meant &quot;one with a tail&quot;, which may conjure an image of an animal displaying its tail in flight of fear (&quot;turning tail&quot;), or a dog&#x27;s habit of putting its tail between its legs when it is afraid. Like many other English words of French origin, this word was introduced in the English language by the French-speaking Normans, after the Norman conquest of England in 1066.

The English surname Coward (as in Noël Coward), however, has the same origin and meaning as the word &quot;cowherd&quot;.

==Military law==
Acts of cowardice have long been punishable by military law, which defines a wide range of cowardly offenses, including desertion in face of the enemy and surrendering to the enemy against orders. The punishment for such acts is typically severe, ranging from corporal punishment to the death sentence.

The United States military codes of justice define cowardice in combat as a crime punishable by death.

Generally, cowardice was punishable by execution during World War I, and those who were caught were often court-martialed and, in many cases, executed by firing squad. British soldiers executed for cowardice were often not commemorated on war memorials, and their families often did not receive benefits and had to endure social stigma. However, many decades later, those soldiers all received posthumous pardons in the UK Armed Forces Act 2006 and have been commemorated with the Shot at Dawn Memorial. Unlike British, Canadian, French, German, and Russian forces, the U.S. military tried soldiers for cowardice, but never followed through with execution while German commanders were less inclined to use execution as a form of punishment.

Considerable controversy was generated by military historian S.L.A. Marshall, who claimed that 75% of U.S. combat troops in World War II never fired at the enemy for the purpose of killing, even while under direct threat. Author Dave Grossman attempted to explain these findings in his book &quot;On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society&quot;. Marshall&#x27;s findings were later challenged as mistaken or even fabricated, and were not replicated in a more rigorous study of Canadian troops in World War II.

<text>Hannes Olof Gösta Alfvén (; 30 May 1908 – 2 April 1995) was a Swedish electrical engineer, plasma physicist and winner of the 1970 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). He described the class of MHD waves now known as Alfvén waves. He was originally trained as an electrical power engineer and later moved to research and teaching in the fields of plasma physics and electrical engineering. Alfvén made many contributions to plasma physics, including theories describing the behavior of aurorae, the Van Allen radiation belts, the effect of magnetic storms on the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, the terrestrial magnetosphere, and the dynamics of plasmas in the Milky Way galaxy.

== Education ==

Alfvén received his PhD from the University of Uppsala in 1934. His thesis was titled &quot;Investigations of High-frequency Electromagnetic Waves.&quot;

== Early years ==

In 1934, Alfvén taught physics at both the University of Uppsala and the Nobel Institute for Physics (later renamed the Manne Siegbahn Institute of Physics) in Stockholm, Sweden. In 1940, he became professor of electromagnetic theory and electrical measurements at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. In 1945, he acquired the nonappointive position of Chair of Electronics. His title was changed to Chair of Plasma Physics in 1963. From 1954 to 1955, Alfvén was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Maryland, College Park. In 1967, after leaving Sweden and spending time in the Soviet Union, he moved to the United States. Alfvén worked in the departments of electrical engineering at both the University of California, San Diego and the University of Southern California.

== Later years ==
In 1991, Alfvén retired as professor of electrical engineering at the University of California, San Diego and professor of plasma physics at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.

Alfvén spent his later adult life alternating between California and Sweden. He died at the age of 86.

== Research ==
In 1937, Alfvén argued that if plasma pervaded the universe, it could then carry electric currents capable of generating a galactic magnetic field. After winning the Nobel Prize for his works in magnetohydrodynamics, he emphasized that:

In order to understand the phenomena in a certain plasma region, it is necessary to map not only the magnetic but also the electric field and the electric currents. Space is filled with a network of currents which transfer energy and momentum over large or very large distances. The currents often pinch to filamentary or surface currents. The latter are likely to give space, as also interstellar and intergalactic space, a cellular structure.

His theoretical work on field-aligned electric currents in the aurora (based on earlier work by Kristian Birkeland) was confirmed in 1967, these currents now being known as Birkeland currents.

British scientist Sydney Chapman was a strong critic of Alfvén. Many physicists regarded Alfvén as espousing unorthodox opinions R. H. Stuewer noting that &quot;... he remained an embittered outsider, winning little respect from other scientists even after he received the Nobel Prize...&quot; and was often forced to publish his papers in obscure journals. Alfvén recalled:

When I describe [plasma phenomena] according to this formalism most referees do not understand what I say and turn down my papers. With the referee system which rules US science today, this means that my papers are rarely accepted by the leading US journals.

Alfvén played a central role in the development of:

* Plasma physics
* Charged particle beams
* Interplanetary medium
* Magnetospheric physics
* Magnetohydrodynamics
* Solar phenomena investigation (such as the solar wind)
* Aurorae science

In 1939, Alfvén proposed the theory of magnetic storms and auroras and the theory of plasma dynamics in the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere. This was the paper rejected by the U.S. journal &quot;Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity&quot;.

Applications of Alfvén&#x27;s research in space science include:

* Van Allen radiation belt theory
* Reduction of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field during magnetic storms
* Magnetosphere (protective plasma covering the Earth)
* Formation of comet tails
* Formation of the Solar System
* Dynamics of plasmas in the galaxy
* Physical cosmology

Alfvén&#x27;s views followed those of the founder of magnetospheric physics, Kristian Birkeland. At the end of the nineteenth century, Birkeland proposed (backed by extensive data) that electric currents flowing down along the Earth&#x27;s magnetic fields into the atmosphere caused the aurora and polar magnetic disturbances.

Areas of technology benefiting from Alfvén&#x27;s contributions include:

* Particle accelerators
* Controlled thermonuclear fusion
* Hypersonic flight
* Rocket propulsion
* Reentry braking of space vehicles

Contributions to astrophysics:

* Galactic magnetic field (1937)
* Identified nonthermal synchrotron radiation from astronomical sources (1950)

Alfvén waves (low frequency hydromagnetic plasma oscillations) are named in his honor, and propagate at the Alfvén speed. Many of his theories about the solar system were verified as late as the 1980s through external measurements of cometary and planetary magnetospheres. However, Alfvén himself noted that astrophysical textbooks poorly represented known plasma phenomena:

A study of how a number of the most used textbooks in astrophysics treat important concepts such as double layers, critical velocity, pinch effects, and circuits is made. It is found that students using these textbooks remain essentially ignorant of even the existence of these concepts, despite the fact that some of them have been well known for half a century (e.g, double layers, Langmuir, 1929; pinch effect, Bennet, 1934).

Alfvén reported that of 17 of the most used textbooks on astrophysics, none mention the pinch effect, none mentioned critical ionization velocity, only two mentioned circuits, and three mentioned double layers.

Alfvén believed the problem with the Big Bang was that astrophysicists tried to extrapolate the origin of the universe from mathematical theories developed on the blackboard, rather than starting from known observable phenomena. He also considered the Big Bang to be a myth devised to explain creation. Alfvén and colleagues proposed the Alfvén–Klein model as an alternative cosmological theory to both the Big Bang and steady state theory cosmologies.

== Personal life ==
Alfvén was married for 67 years to his wife Kerstin (1910–1992). They raised five children, one boy and four girls. Their son became a physician, while one daughter became a writer and another a lawyer in Sweden. The writer was Inger Alfvén and is well known for her work in Sweden. The composer Hugo Alfvén was Hannes Alfvén&#x27;s uncle.

Alfvén studied the history of science, oriental philosophy, and religion. On his religious views, Alfven was irreligious and critical of religion. He spoke Swedish, English, German, French, and Russian, and some Spanish and Chinese. He expressed great concern about the difficulties of permanent high-level radioactive waste management.&quot; Alfvén was also interested in problems in cosmology and all aspects of auroral physics, and used Schröder&#x27;s well known book on aurora, &quot;Das Phänomen des Polarlichts&quot;. Letters of Alfvén, Treder, and Schröder were published on the occasion of Treder&#x27;s 70th birthday. The relationships between Hans-Jürgen Treder, Hannes Alfvén and Wilfried Schröder were discussed in detail by Schröder in his publications.

Alfvén died on 2 April, 1995 at Djursholm aged 86.

== Awards and honours ==
The Hannes Alfvén Prize, awarded annually by the European Physical Society for outstanding contributions in plasma physics, is named after him. The asteroid 1778 Alfvén is named in his honour.

<text>Cyrus Roberts Vance (March 27, 1917January 12, 2002) was an American lawyer and United States Secretary of State under President Jimmy Carter from 1977 to 1980. Prior to serving in that position, he was the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense in the Johnson administration. During the Kennedy administration he was Secretary of the Army and General Counsel of the Department of Defense.

As Secretary of State, Vance approached foreign policy with an emphasis on negotiation over conflict and a special interest in arms reduction. In April 1980, he resigned in protest of Operation Eagle Claw, the secret mission to rescue American hostages in Iran. He was succeeded by Edmund Muskie.

Vance was the cousin (and adoptive son) of 1924 Democratic presidential nominee and lawyer John W. Davis. He was the father of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.

==Early life and family==
Cyrus Vance was born on March 27, 1917, in Clarksburg, West Virginia. He was the son of John Carl Vance II and his wife Amy Roberts Vance, and had an elder brother, John Carl Vance III. Following Vance&#x27;s birth, his family relocated to Bronxville, New York, so that his father could commute to New York City, where he was an insurance broker. Vance&#x27;s father was also a landowner and worked for a government agency during World War I. He died unexpectedly of pneumonia in 1922.

Vance&#x27;s mother was Amy Roberts Vance, who had a prominent family history in Philadelphia and was active in civic affairs. Following her husband&#x27;s death, she moved her family to Switzerland for a year, where Vance and his brother learned French at L&#x27;Institut Sillig in Vevey. Vance&#x27;s much older cousin (referred to as an &quot;uncle&quot; within the family) John W. Davis, an Ambassador to the United Kingdom and 1924 United States presidential candidate, became his mentor and adopted him.

Vance graduated from Kent School in 1935 and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1939 from Yale College, where he was a member of the secret Scroll and Key society and earned three varsity letters in ice hockey. He graduated from Yale Law School in 1942. While there, his classmates included Sargent Shriver, William Scranton, Stanley Rogers Resor, and William Bundy, with all of whom he would later work.

During World War II, Vance served in the United States Navy as a gunnery officer on the destroyer USS &quot;Hale&quot; (DD-642) until 1946. He saw sea action in the Battle of Tarawa, the Battle of Saipan, the Battle of Guam (1944), the Bougainville Campaign, and the Philippines Campaign (1944–1945). After the war, he worked for the Mead Corporation for a year before joining the law firm Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett in New York City.

At the age of 29, Vance married Grace Elsie &quot;Gay&quot; Sloane on February 15, 1947. She was a Bryn Mawr College graduate and was the daughter of the board chairman of the W. &amp; J. Sloane furniture company in New York City. They had five children:
* Elsie Nicoll Vance
* Amy Sloane Vance
* Grace Roberts Vance
* Camilla Vance Holmes
* Cyrus R. Vance Jr.

==Political career==
In 1957, Senator Lyndon B. Johnson asked Vance to leave Wall Street to work for the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, where he helped draft the National Aeronautics and Space Act, leading to the creation of NASA.

In 1961, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara recruited Vance to become General Counsel of the Department of Defense. He was then made the Secretary of the Army by President John F. Kennedy. He was Secretary when Army units were sent to northern Mississippi in 1962 to protect James Meredith and ensure that the court-ordered integration of the University of Mississippi took place.

In 1964, Vance became the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense and now-President Johnson sent him to the Panama Canal Zone after student riots. After the 1967 Detroit riot, Johnson sent him to Michigan. Vance next attempted to delay the Cyprus dispute as the President&#x27;s personal envoy, brokering the Greek-Turkish agreement of Dec. 1, 1967. In 1968, Johnson sent him to South Korea to deal with the hostage situation.

Vance first supported the Vietnam War but by the late 1960s changed his views and resigned from office, advising the president to withdraw US troops from South Vietnam. Vance served as a deputy to W. Averell Harriman during the Paris Peace Accords, which were a failure due to the duplicity of the South Vietnamese. Vance called the failed peace talks &quot;one of the great tragedies in history&quot;. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in January 1969.

In May 1970, Vance was appointed to serve as a commissioner in a landmark panel known as the Knapp Commission, which was formed and assigned by New York City Mayor John V. Lindsay to investigate systemic corruption in the New York Police Department. The Knapp Commission held televised hearings into police corruption and issued a final report of its findings in 1972. The work of the Knapp Commission led to the prosecution of police officers on charges of corruption and culminated in significant, if short-lived, reforms and oversight of the police department, including the appointment of a temporary special prosecutor to investigate and prosecute corruption committed by NYPD officers, district attorneys, and judges.

From 1974 to 1976, Vance served as president of the New York City Bar Association. Vance returned to his law practice at Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett in 1980, but was repeatedly called back to public service throughout the 1980s and 1990s, participating in diplomatic missions to Bosnia, Croatia, and South Africa. Vance helped negotiate the dispute over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

===Secretary of State===

President Jimmy Carter initially wanted to nominate George Ball to become Secretary of State, but, fearing Ball was too liberal to be confirmed, nominated Vance instead. Vance played an integral role as the administration negotiated the Panama Canal Treaties, along with peace talks in Rhodesia, Namibia and South Africa. He worked closely with Israeli Ministers Moshe Dayan and Ezer Weizman to secure the Camp David Accords in 1978. Vance insisted that the President make Paul Warnke Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, over strong opposition by Senator Henry M. Jackson.

Vance also pushed for détente with the Soviet Union, and clashed frequently with the more hawkish National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. Vance tried to advance arms limitations by working on the SALT II agreement with the Soviet Union, which he saw as the central diplomatic issue of the time, but Brzezinski lobbied for a tougher more assertive policy vis-a-vis the Soviets. He argued for strong condemnation of Soviet activity in Africa and in the Third World as well as successfully lobbying for normalized relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1978.

As Brzezinski took control of the negotiations, Vance was marginalized and his influence began to wane. When revolution erupted in Iran in late 1978, the two were divided on how to support the United States&#x27; ally the Shah of Iran. Vance argued in favor of reforms while Brzezinski urged him to crack down – the &#x27;iron fist&#x27; approach. Unable to receive a direct course of action from Carter, the mixed messages that the Shah received from Vance and Brzezinski contributed to his confusion and indecision as he fled Iran in January 1979 and his regime collapsed.

Vance negotiated the SALT II agreement directly with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, bypassing American Ambassador Malcolm Toon, who then criticized the agreement. In June 1979, President Carter and Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev signed the treaty in Vienna&#x27;s Hofburg Imperial Palace, in front of the international press, but the Senate ultimately did not ratify it. After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan on December 27, 1979, Vance&#x27;s opposition to what he had called &quot;visceral anti-Sovietism&quot; led to a rapid reduction of his stature. 

Vance&#x27;s attempt to surreptitiously negotiate a solution to the Iran hostage crisis with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini through the Palestine Liberation Organization failed badly. Believing that diplomatic initiatives could see the hostages safely returned home, Vance initially fought off attempts by Brzezinski to pursue a military solution. Vance, struggling with gout, went to Florida on April 10, 1980, for a long weekend. On April 11, the National Security Council held a newly scheduled meeting and authorized Operation Eagle Claw, a military expedition into Tehran to rescue the hostages. Deputy Secretary Warren Christopher, who attended the meeting in Vance&#x27;s place, did not inform him. Furious, on April 21 Vance handed in his resignation, calling Brzezinski &quot;evil&quot;. The only Secretaries of State who had previously resigned in protest were Lewis Cass, who resigned in the buildup to the Civil War, and William Jennings Bryan, who resigned in the buildup to World War I. 

President Carter aborted the operation after only five of the eight helicopters he had sent into the Dasht-e Kavir desert arrived in operational condition. As U.S. forces prepared to depart from the staging area, a helicopter collided with a transport plane, causing a fire that killed eight servicemen. Vance&#x27;s resignation was confirmed several days later, and he was replaced by Senator Edmund Muskie. A second rescue mission was planned but never carried out, and the diplomatic efforts to negotiate the release of the hostages were handed over to Deputy Secretary Christopher. The hostages were released during the first inauguration of Ronald Reagan, after 444 days in captivity.

==Later career in law and as Special Envoy==
In 1991, he was named Special Envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations for Croatia and proposed the Vance plan for solution of conflict in Croatia. Authorities of Croatia and Serbia agreed to Vance&#x27;s plan, but the leaders of SAO Krajina rejected it, even though it offered Serbs quite a large degree of autonomy by the rest of the world&#x27;s standards, as it did not include full independence for Krajina. He continued his work as member of Zagreb 4 group. The plan they drafted, named Z-4, was effectively superseded when Croatian forces retook the Krajina region (Operation Storm) in 1995.

In January 1993, as the United Nations Special Envoy to Bosnia, Vance and Lord David Owen, the EU representative, began negotiating a peace plan for the ending the War in Bosnia. The plan was rejected, and Vance announced his resignation as Special Envoy to the UN Secretary-General. He was replaced by Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg.

In 1997, he was made the original honorary chair of the American Iranian Council.

==Later life==
Vance was a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

In 1993, Vance was awarded the United States Military Academy&#x27;s Sylvanus Thayer Award.

In 1995 he again acted as Special Envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and signed the interim accord as witness in the negotiations between the Republic of Macedonia and Greece. Vance was a member of the Trilateral Commission.

Vance also served on the board of directors of IBM, Pan American World Airways, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, U.S. Steel, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, as a trustee of the Yale Corporation, as chairman of the board of the Rockefeller Foundation, and vice chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations.

==Death==
Vance suffered for several years from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and died at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, on January 12, 2002, aged 84, of pneumonia and other complications. His funeral was held at the Church of the Heavenly Rest in Manhattan. His remains were interred at the Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia. His wife Grace died in New York City on March 22, 2008, at the age of 89.

==Legacy==
He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969.

In 1980, Vance received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

He received the Freedom Medal in 1993.

The house of Vance&#x27;s mother, which was known as the Stealey-Goff-Vance House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. It is home to the Harrison County Historical Society.

In 1999, Vance was presented the Lifetime Contributions to American Diplomacy Award by the American Foreign Service Association.

In the 2012 movie &quot;Argo&quot;, he was portrayed by actor Bob Gunton.

<text>The royal &quot;we&quot;, majestic plural (), or royal plural, is the use of a plural pronoun (or corresponding plural-inflected verb forms) used by a single person who is a monarch or holds a high office to refer to themself. A more general term for the use of a &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, or &quot;our&quot; to refer to oneself is &quot;nosism&quot;.

== Example ==
In 1902, after the United Kingdom had been asked to arbitrate a boundary dispute between Argentina and Chile, King Edward VII issued the adjudication of the requested arbitration, known as the Cordillera of the Andes Boundary Case. The sentence following the preamble of the award begins as follows:

In this quotation, underlining has been added to the words that exemplify the use of the majestic plural.

== Western usage ==
The royal &quot;we&quot; is commonly employed by a person of high office, such as a monarch or other type of sovereign. It is also used in certain formal contexts by bishops and university rectors. William Longchamp is credited with its introduction to England in the late 12th century, following the practice of the Chancery of Apostolic Briefs.

In the public situations in which it is used, the monarch or other dignitary is typically speaking not only in their own personal capacity but also in an official capacity as leader of a nation or institution. In the grammar of several languages, plural forms tend to be perceived as deferential and more polite than singular forms.

In diplomatic letters, such as letters of credence, it is customary for monarchs to use the singular first-person (&quot;I&quot;, &quot;me&quot;, &quot;my&quot;) when writing to other monarchs, while the majestic plural is used in royal letters to a president of a republic.

In Commonwealth realms, the sovereign discharges their commissions to ranked military officers in the capacity of &quot;we&quot;. Many official documents published in the name of the monarch are also presented with royal &quot;we&quot;, such as letters patent, proclamations, etc.

Popes have historically used the &quot;we&quot; as part of their formal speech, for example as used in , , and . 
Since Pope John Paul I, however, the royal &quot;we&quot; has been dropped by popes in public speech, although formal documents may have retained it. Recent important papal documents still use the majestic plural in the original Latin but are given with the singular &quot;I&quot; in their official English translations.

In 1989, Margaret Thatcher, then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, was met with disdain by some in the press for using the royal &quot;we&quot; when announcing to reporters that she had become a grandmother in her &quot;We have become a grandmother&quot; statement.

== Non-Western usage ==
Several prominent epithets of the Bible describe the Hebrew God in plural terms: , , and . Many Christian scholars, including the post-apostolic leaders and Augustine of Hippo, have seen the use of the plural and grammatically singular verb forms as support for the doctrine of the Trinity. The earliest known use of this poetic device is somewhere in the 4th century AD, during the Byzantine period; nevertheless, scholars such as Mircea Eliade, Wilhelm Gesenius, and Aaron Ember claim that Elohim is a form of majestic plural in the Torah.

In Imperial China and every monarchy within its cultural sphere (including Japan, Korea, Ryukyu, and Vietnam), the majestic imperial pronoun was expressed by the character (, ). This was in fact the former Chinese first-person pronoun (that is, ). However, following his unification of China, the emperor Shi Huangdi arrogated it entirely for his personal use. Previously, in the Chinese cultural sphere, the use of the first-person pronoun in formal courtly language was already uncommon, with the nobility using the self-deprecating term () for self-reference, while their subjects referred to themselves as (, original meaning or ), with an indirect deferential reference like (), or by employing a deferential epithet (such as the adjective (), ). While this practice did not affect the non-Chinese countries as much since their variants of () and other terms were generally imported loanwords, the practice of polite avoidance of pronouns nevertheless spread throughout East Asia. This still persists, except in China, where, following the May Fourth Movement and the Communist Party victory in the Chinese Civil War, the use of the first-person pronoun , which dates to the Shang dynasty oracle inscriptions as a plural possessive pronoun, is common. 

In Hindustani and other Indo-Aryan languages, the majestic plural is a common way for elder speakers to refer to themselves, and also for persons of higher social rank to refer to themselves. In certain communities, the first-person singular () may be dispensed with altogether for self-reference and the plural nosism used uniformly.

In Islam, several plural word forms are used to refer to Allah.

In Malaysia, before the Yang di-Pertuan Agong takes office, he will first take an oath, in which the Malay word for &#x27;we&#x27;, , would be the pronoun used. This is because His Majesty represents the other Malay Rulers of Malaysia during his reign as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong.

Historically, in Indonesia, royal we &quot;Kami, Presiden Republik Indonesia&quot; (We, President of Republic of Indonesia) used as preamble of early Indonesian law products, Government Regulation No. 1/1945 and Law No. 1/1945. But later no longer used in 1946 since issuance of Government Regulation No. 1/1946 and Law No. 1/1946.

<text>Eddie from Ohio is an American folk band. 
Formed in 1991 in Northern Virginia, the band has achieved considerable local success, winning four Wammies (Washington, D.C. area music awards) and a nationwide following, all outside the purview of major record labels.

==Members==
* Julie Murphy Wells - vocals
* Robbie Schaefer - guitar, vocals
* Eddie Hartness - percussion, vocals
* Michael Clem - guitar, bass, harmonica, vocals

==History==
Name notwithstanding, the band is not from Ohio. All four band members are natives of Virginia, and the band has recorded many songs influenced by their deep Virginia roots. The band&#x27;s name comes from a nickname given to Hartness by a college friend, who coined the nickname as a tribute to the lead singer of Firehose, Ed &#x27;From Ohio&#x27; Crawford.

Childhood friends Robbie Schaefer and Michael Clem both attended Virginia&#x27;s James Madison University, where they founded the Jellyfish Blues Band. It was at JMU that they met Eddie Hartness, a native of Arlington, Virginia.

Schaefer had stayed in contact with Julie Murphy (now Murphy Wells), whom he&#x27;d met while they&#x27;d attended rival high schools. One evening, when Clem and Wells added their voices to Schaefer&#x27;s during a set in a solo gig, the idea for EFO was formed. The trio invited percussionist Hartness to join them, and, in 1991, the nascent folk group came into being.

Their early repertoire of covers (by such artists as The Byrds and Blues Traveler) was soon augmented by originals from songwriters Schaefer and Clem, and over time the band developed a distinctive folk sound, marrying two acoustic guitars with hand percussion and strong four-part harmonies.

The band saw relative success from the beginning. They launched their own Virginia Soul record label, began producing cassettes and CDs, and handled their own business and bookings. They soon landed themselves a Tuesday night residency at a local Northern Virginia bar, the Bad Habits Grille. After just six months, the venue went from no cover and small audiences to a $5 cover charge and a packed house every Tuesday.

With this gig as a springboard, the band&#x27;s following grew. EFO&#x27;s first three CDs drew the attention of booking agency Fleming and Associates. Under their auspices, the band embarked on longer, more ambitious tours.

In 1998, the Washington Area Music Association honored EFO with a Wammie as &quot;Best Contemporary Folk Group.&quot; Later that year, EFO played their farewell gig at Bad Habits and began regularly touring beyond the Washington, DC, metro area. They built a following that covered both coasts and the American heartland, with performances from Berkeley, California, to New York City and frequent returns to the band&#x27;s Virginia home that included sold-out performances at such venues as the Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts.
In September 2005 vocalist Wells was diagnosed with breast cancer. The band subsequently reduced their tour schedule, and the members began to pursue other interests.

Wells is now a cancer survivor, active in cancer cure fundraising. Clem and Schaefer continue to sing and tour independently. Schaefer has a respected children&#x27;s music show, &quot;Robbie Schaefer&#x27;s Stuck In a Real Tall Tree,&quot; on XM Satellite Radio, where he serves as Music Director for XM Kids, and in 2004 released his second solo album entitled &quot;In the Flesh.&quot; In 2024, he was ordained as a rabbi. In 2006, Clem released his first solo endeavor, &quot;1st and 40,&quot; produced by bandmate Hartness. Hartness himself continues to play and tour with local bands such as Brother Shamus.

The band stopped performing after 31 years following a 2022 Alaskan cruise. You can occasionally catch a sneak performance of EFO forerunner, the Jellyfish Blues Band.

<text>Walnut trees are any species of tree in the plant genus Juglans, the type genus of the family Juglandaceae, the seeds of which are referred to as walnuts. All species are deciduous trees, tall, with pinnate leaves , with 5–25 leaflets; the shoots have chambered pith, a character shared with the wingnuts (&quot;Pterocarya&quot;), but not the hickories (&quot;Carya&quot;) in the same family.

The 21 species in the genus range across the north temperate Old World from southeast Europe east to Japan, and more widely in the New World from southeast Canada west to California and south to Argentina.

Edible walnuts, which are consumed worldwide, are usually harvested from cultivated varieties of the species &quot;Juglans regia&quot;. China produces half of the world total of walnuts.

==Etymology==
The common name &quot;walnut&quot; derives from Old English &quot;wealhhnutu&quot;, literally &#x27;foreign nut&#x27; (from &quot;wealh&quot; &#x27;foreign&#x27; + &quot;hnutu&quot; &#x27;nut&#x27;), because it was introduced from Gaul and Italy. The Latin name for the walnut was &quot;nux Gallica&quot;, &quot;Gallic nut&quot;. The name &quot;Juglans&quot; was apparently conjured by Linnaeus himself, replacing the prior &quot;Nux&quot;, by combining &quot;Ju&quot; from Jupiter with the Latin &quot;glans&quot; meaning &#x27;acorn&#x27;, referring to the association of the plant with Jupiter by the Romans.

==Folklore==
Tradition has it that a walnut tree should be beaten. This would have the benefit of removing dead wood and stimulating shoot formation.

==Production==
In 2017, world production of walnuts (in shell) was 3.8 million tonnes, led by China with producing half of the world total (table). Other major producers were the United States (15%) and Iran (9%).

==Cultivation and uses==

The two most commercially important species are &quot;J. regia&quot; for timber and nuts, and &quot;J. nigra&quot; for timber. Both species have similar cultivation requirements and are widely grown in temperate zones.

Walnuts are light-demanding species that benefit from protection from wind. Walnuts are also very hardy against drought.

Interplanting walnut plantations with a nitrogen fixing plant, such as &quot;Elaeagnus × ebbingei&quot; or &quot;Elaeagnus umbellata&quot;, and various &quot;Alnus&quot; species, results in a 30% increase in tree height and girth (Hemery 2001).

When grown for nuts, care must be taken to select cultivars that are compatible for pollination purposes; although some cultivars are marketed as &quot;self fertile&quot;, they will generally fruit better with a different pollination partner. Many different cultivars are available for growers, and offer different growth habits, flowering and leafing, kernel flavours and shell thicknesses. A key trait for more northerly latitudes of North America and Europe is phenology, with ‘late flushing’ being particularly important to avoid frost damage in spring. Some cultivars have been developed for novel ‘hedge’ production systems developed in Europe and would not suit more traditional orchard systems.

===Flowers===
The leaves and blossoms of the walnut tree normally appear in spring. The male cylindrical catkins are developed from leafless shoots from the past year; they are about in length and have a large number of little flowers. Female flowers appear in a cluster at the peak of the current year’s leafy shoots.

===Fruit===
The fruits of the walnut are a type of accessory fruit known as a pseudodrupe (or drupe-like nut), the outer covering of the fruit is an involucre - in a drupe the covering would be derived from the carpel.

====Nuts and kernels====
The nut kernels of all the species are edible, but the walnuts most commonly traded are from the &quot;J. regia&quot;, the only species which has a large nut and thin shell. &quot;J. nigra&quot; kernels are also produced commercially in the US.

Two-thirds of the world export market and 99% of US walnuts are grown in California&#x27;s Central Valley and in Coastal Valleys, from Redding in the north to Bakersfield in the south. Of the more than 30 varieties of &quot;J. regia&quot; grown there, Chandler and Hartley account for over half of total production. In California commercial production, the Hinds&#x27; black walnut (&quot;J. hindsii&quot;) and the hybrid between &quot;J. hindsii&quot; and &quot;J. regia&quot;, &quot;Juglans x paradox&quot;, are widely used as rootstocks for &quot;J. regia&quot; cultivars because of their resistance to Phytophthora and to a very limited degree, the oak root fungus. However, trees grafted on these rootstocks often succumb to black line.

In some countries, immature nuts in their husks are preserved in vinegar. In the UK, these are called pickled walnuts and this is one of the major uses for fresh nuts from the small scale plantings. In Armenian cuisine, unripe walnuts, including husks, are preserved in sugar syrup and eaten whole. In Italy, liqueurs called Nocino and Nocello are flavoured with walnuts, while &quot;Salsa di Noci&quot; (walnut sauce) is a pasta sauce originating from Liguria. In Georgia, walnuts are ground with other ingredients to make walnut sauce.

Walnuts are heavily used in India. In Jammu, it is used widely as a &quot;prasad&quot; (offering) to Mother Goddess Vaisnav Devi and, generally, as a dry food in the season of festivals such as Diwali.

The nuts are rich in oil, and are widely eaten both fresh and in cookery. Walnut oil is expensive and consequently is used sparingly; most often in salad dressings. Walnut oil has been used in oil paint, as an effective binding medium, known for its clear, glossy consistency and nontoxicity.

Manos and Stone studied the composition of seed oils from several species of the Rhoipteleaceae and Juglandaceae and found the nut oils were generally more unsaturated from species which grow in the temperate zones and more saturated for species which grow in the tropical zones. In the northerly-growing section &quot;Trachycaryon&quot;, &quot;J. cinerea&quot; oil was reported to contain 15% linolenate (the report did not specify whether the linolenate was the alpha (n-3) or gamma (n-6) isomer, or perhaps a mixture), 2% of saturated palmitate, and a maximum concentration of 71% linoleate. In the section &quot;Juglans&quot;, &quot;J. regia&quot; nut oil was found to contain from 10% to 11% linolenate, 6% to 7% palmitate, and a maximum concentration of linoleate (62% to 68%). In the section &quot;Cardiocaryon&quot;, the nut oils of &quot;J. ailantifolia&quot; and &quot;J. mandshurica&quot; were reported to contain (respectively) 7% and 5% of linolenate, 2% of palmitate, and maximum concentrations of 74% and 79% linoleate. Within the section &quot;Rhysocaryon&quot;, the nut oils of the U.S. native black walnuts &quot;J. microcarpa&quot; and &quot;J. nigra&quot; were reported to contain (respectively) 7% and 3% linolenate, 4% and 3% palmitate, and 70% and 69% linoleate. The remaining results for black walnuts were: &quot;J. australis&quot; contained 2% linolenate, 7% palmitate, and 61% linoleate; &quot;J. boliviana&quot; contained 4% linolenate, 4% palmitate, and 70% linoleate; &quot;J. hirsuta&quot; contained 2% linolenate, 5% palmitate, and 75% linoleate; &quot;J. mollis&quot; contained 0% linolenate, 5% palmitate, 46% linoleate, and 49% oleate; &quot;J. neotropica&quot; contained 3% linolenate, 5% palmitate, and 50% linoleate; and &quot;J. olanchana&quot; contained only a trace of linolenate, 9% palmitate, and 73% linoleate;

====Shells====
The walnut shell has a wide variety of uses. Eastern black walnut (&quot;J. nigra&quot;) shell is the hardest of the walnut shells, and therefore has the highest resistance to breakdown. 
;Cleansing and polishing
:Walnut shells are mostly used to clean soft metals, fiberglass, plastics, wood and stone. This environmentally friendly and recyclable soft grit abrasive is well suited for air blasting, deburring, descaling, and polishing operations because of its elasticity and resilience. Uses include cleaning automobile and jet engines, electronic circuit boards, and paint and graffiti removal. For example: In the early days of jet transportation, crushed walnut shells were used to scour the compressor airfoils clean, but when engines with air cooled vanes and blades in the turbine started being manufactured, this practice was stopped because the crushed shells tended to plug up the cooling passages to the turbine, resulting in turbine failures due to overheating.
;Oil well drilling
: The shell is used widely in oil well drilling for lost circulation material in making and maintaining seals in fracture zones and unconsolidated formations.
;Flour
: Flour from walnut shells can be used in thermoplastic starch composites to substitute oil derivatives.
;Paint thickener
: Walnut shells are added to paint to give it a thicker consistency for &quot;plaster effect&quot; ranges.
;Explosives
: Used as a filler in dynamite.
;Cosmetic cleaner
: Occasionally used in soap and exfoliating cleansers.

====Husks====
Walnut husks are often used to create a rich yellow-brown to dark brown dye used for dyeing fabric, yarn or wood and for other purposes. The dye does not require a mordant and will readily stain the hand if picked without gloves.

===Wood===
The common walnut, and the black walnut and its allies, are important for their attractive timber, which is hard, dense, tight-grained and polishes to a very smooth finish. The color is dark chocolate or similar in the heartwood changing by a sharp boundary to creamy white in the sapwood. When kiln-dried, walnut wood tends toward a dull brown color, but when air-dried can become a rich purplish-brown. Because of its color, hardness and grain, it is a prized furniture and carving wood.

When walnut vascular cambium is involved in a crotch (a branch fork), it behaves unusually, producing characteristic &quot;crotch figure&quot; in the wood which it makes. The grain figure exposed when a crotch in a walnut log is cut in the plane of its one entering branch and two exiting branches is attractive and sought after.

There are some differences between the wood of the European walnut (&quot;Juglans regia&quot;) and the wood of the black walnut (&quot;Juglans nigra&quot;). For example, &quot;Juglans regia&quot; wood sometimes has patches with a wavy texture. Black walnut wood tends to be darker than European walnut wood, and can suffer from paler sapwood that only really comes to light when the wood has been planed.

Walnut wood has been the timber of choice for gun makers for centuries, including the Gewehr 98 and Lee–Enfield rifles of the First World War. It remains one of the most popular choices for rifle and shotgun stocks, and is generally considered to be the premium – as well as the most traditional – wood for gun stocks, due to its resilience to compression along the grain. Walnut is also used in lutherie and for the body of pipe organs.

Walnut burls (or &quot;burrs&quot; in the rest of the world) are commonly used to create bowls and other turned pieces. Walnut burl veneer is one of the most valuable and highly prized by cabinet makers and prestige car manufacturers.

The wood of the butternut and related Asian species is of much lower value, softer, coarser, less strong and heavy, and paler in colour.

Freshly sawn walnut heartwood may be greenish in color, but with exposure to air this color quickly changes to brown due to oxidation of the pigment.

In North America, forestry research has been undertaken, mostly on &quot;J. nigra&quot;, aiming to improve the quality of planting stock and markets. In some areas of the US, black walnut is the most valuable commercial timber species. The Walnut Council is the key body linking growers with scientists. In Europe, various EU-led scientific programmes have studied walnut growing for timber.

The Cherokee Indians would produce a black dye from walnut bark, which they used to dye cloth. As early as the 2nd century CE, shells and kernels of the edible walnut were used to make a dye solution in the Levant.

===Parkland and garden trees===
Walnuts are very attractive trees in parks and large gardens. Walnut trees are easily propagated from the nuts. Seedlings grow rapidly on good soils.
The Japanese walnut in particular is known for its huge leaves, which have a tropical appearance.

As garden trees, they have some drawbacks, in particular the falling nuts, and the releasing of the allelopathic compound juglone, though a number of gardeners do grow them. However, different walnut species vary in the amount of juglone they release from the roots and fallen leaves - &quot;J. nigra&quot;, in particular, is known for its toxicity, both to plants and horses. Juglone is toxic to plants such as tomato, apple, and birch, and may cause stunting and death of nearby vegetation. Juglone appears to be one of the walnut&#x27;s primary defence mechanisms against potential competitors for resources (water, nutrients and sunlight), and its effects are felt most strongly inside the tree&#x27;s &quot;drip line&quot; (the circle around the tree marked by the horizontal distance of its outermost branches). However, even plants at a seemingly great distance outside the drip line can be affected, and juglone can linger in the soil for several years even after a walnut is removed as its roots slowly decompose and release juglone into the soil.

===Walnut as wildlife food plants===
Walnut species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species. These include:
* Brown-tail moth (&quot;Euproctis chrysorrhoea&quot;)
* &quot;Coleophora&quot; case-bearers (moths) &quot;C. laticornella&quot; (recorded on &quot;J. nigra&quot;) and &quot;C. pruniella&quot;.
* Common emerald (a geometer moth) (&quot;Hemithea aestivaria&quot;)
* Small emperor moth (&quot;Pavonia pavonia&quot;)
* The engrailed (a geometer moth) (&quot;Ectropis crepuscularia&quot;)
* Walnut sphinx moth (&quot;Amorpha juglandis&quot;)
* The bride (a moth) (&quot;Catocala neogama&quot;) – nominate subspecies on butternut and others, &quot;C. n. euphemia&quot; on Arizona black walnut, perhaps Texas black walnut and others.

The nuts are consumed by other animals, such as mice and squirrels.

In California (US) and Switzerland, crows have been witnessed taking walnuts into their beaks, flying up to 60 feet or so in the air, and dropping them to the ground to crack the shells and eat the nut inside.

==Nutritional information==
The raw edible seed of walnut is composed of 4% water, 14% carbohydrates, 15% protein, and 65% fat. In a 100 gram amount, walnuts provide 654 calories and are a rich source (≥20% of Daily Value) of protein, dietary fiber, the B vitamins, niacin, vitamin B6, and folate, and several dietary minerals, particularly manganese.

Walnut oil is composed mostly of polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid, although it also contains oleic acid, a monounsaturated fat and 31% of total fat is saturated fat.

==Systematics==

===Taxonomy===
The genus &quot;Juglans&quot; is divided into four sections.

====Sections and species====
The best-known member of the genus is the Persian walnut (&quot;J. regia&quot;, literally &quot;royal walnut&quot;), native from the Balkans in southeast Europe, southwest and central Asia to the Himalaya and southwest China. Walnuts are a traditional feature of Iranian cuisine; the nation has extensive orchards which are an important feature of regional economies. In Kyrgyzstan alone, there are 230,700 ha of walnut-fruit forest, where &quot;J. regia&quot; is the dominant overstory tree (Hemery and Popov 1998). In non-European English-speaking nations, the nut of the &quot;J. regia&quot; is often called the &quot;English walnut&quot;; in Great Britain, the &quot;common walnut.&quot;

The eastern black walnut (&quot;J. nigra&quot;) is a common species in its native eastern North America, and is also widely cultivated elsewhere. The nuts are edible, and though they are often used in expensive baked goods, the Persian walnut is preferred for everyday use because it is easier to extract the nutmeat. The wood is particularly valuable.

The Hinds&#x27; black walnut (&quot;J. hindsii&quot;) is native to northern California, where it has been widely used commercially as a rootstock for &quot;J. regia&quot; trees. Hinds&#x27; black walnut shells do not have the deep grooves characteristic of the eastern black walnut.
The Japanese walnut (&quot;J. ailantifolia&quot;) is similar to butternut, distinguished by the larger leaves up to 90 cm long, and round (not oval) nuts. The variety &quot;cordiformis&quot;, often called the heartnut has heart-shaped nuts; the common name of this variety is the source of the sectional name Cardiocaryon.

The butternut (&quot;J. cinerea&quot;) is also native to eastern North America, where it is currently endangered by an introduced disease, butternut canker, caused by the fungus &quot;Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum&quot;. Its leaves are 40–60 cm long, the fruits are oval, the shell has very tall, very slender ridges, and the kernel is especially high in fat.

====Hybrids====
*&quot;J. × bixbyi&quot; Rehd.—&quot;J. ailantifolia&quot; x &quot;J. cinerea&quot;
*&quot;J. × intermedia&quot; Carr.—&quot;J. nigra&quot; x &quot;J. regia&quot;
*&quot;J. × notha&quot; Rehd.—&quot;J. ailantifolia&quot; x &quot;J. regia&quot;
*&quot;J. × quadrangulata&quot; (Carr.) Rehd.—&quot;J. cinerea&quot; x &quot;J. regia&quot;
*&quot;J. × sinensis&quot; (D. C.) Rehd.—&quot;J. mandschurica&quot; x &quot;J. regia&quot;
*&quot;J. × paradox&quot; Burbank—&quot;J. hindsii&quot; x &quot;J. regia&quot;
*&quot;J. × royal&quot; Burbank—&quot;J. hindsii&quot; x &quot;J. nigra&quot;

===Phylogeny===
A study of sequenced nuclear DNA from the external transcribed spacer (ETS) of ribosomal DNA (rDNA), the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of rDNA, and the second intron of the &quot;LEAFY&quot; gene taken from at least one individual of most of the species of Juglans has supported several conclusions:

* The genus &quot;Juglans&quot; is monophyletic;
* Sect. &quot;Cardiocaryon&quot; is sister to Sect. &quot;Trachycaryon&quot;;
* Sect. &quot;Juglans&quot; is sister to Sect. &quot;Cardiocaryon&quot; and Sect. &quot;Trachycaryon&quot; together;
* Sect. &quot;Rhysocaryon&quot; is monophyletic and sister to Sect. &quot;Juglans&quot;, Sect. &quot;Cardiocaryon&quot;, and Sect. &quot;Trachycaryon&quot; together;
* Sect. &quot;Rhysocaryon&quot;, the black walnuts, contains two clades:
** one comprises the more northerly species &quot;J. californica&quot;, &quot;J. hindsii&quot;, &quot;J. hirsuta&quot;, &quot;J. major&quot;, &quot;J. microcarpa&quot;, and &quot;J. nigra&quot;;
** the other comprises the more southerly species &quot;J. australis&quot;, &quot;J. boliviana&quot;, &quot;J. jamaicensis&quot;, &quot;J. molis&quot;, &quot;J. neotropica&quot;, &quot;J. olanchana&quot;, &quot;J. steyermarkii&quot;, and &quot;J. venezuelensis&quot;
* &quot;J. olanchana&quot; var. &quot;standleyi&quot; seems to be more closely related to &quot;J. steyermarkii&quot; than to &quot;J. olanchana&quot; var. &quot;olanchana&quot;, suggesting &quot;J. olanchana&quot; var. &quot;standleyi&quot; might be better understood as either a separate species or a variety of &quot;J. steyermarkii&quot;.

The paper presenting these results did not publish any new names for the subdivisions of sect. &quot;Rhysocaryon&quot;, for any combinations of the other sections, or for &quot;J. olanchana&quot; var. &quot;standleyi&quot;.

==Paleontological history==
Fossils of &quot;Juglans&quot; nuts have been described from the Tertiary period of North America. The paleontological history of &quot;Juglans regia&quot; in Europe shows signs of a post-Ice-Age re-expansíon from refugia in the southeast, much influenced by people carrying walnut nuts about after the numbers of humans had been much increased by the start of agriculture.

<text>Sliders is an American science fiction and fantasy television series created by Robert K. Weiss and Tracy Tormé. It was broadcast for five seasons between 1995 and 2000. The series follows a group of travelers as they use a wormhole to &quot;slide&quot; between parallel universes. Tracy Tormé, Robert K. Weiss, Leslie Belzberg, John Landis, David Peckinpah, Bill Dial, and Alan Barnette served as executive producers at different times of the production. For its first two seasons, it was produced in Vancouver, British Columbia. It was filmed primarily in Los Angeles, California, in the last three seasons.

The first three seasons were broadcast by Fox. After being canceled by Fox, the series moved to Sci-Fi Channel for its final two seasons. The final episode was shown in February 2000.

==Plot==

The show&#x27;s titular characters are a group of people who travel (&quot;slide&quot;) between different Earths in parallel universes via a vortex-like wormhole, activated by a handheld timer device. While the slide technology was intended to return them to their home universe, their premature use of the timer to escape a dangerous situation has caused the timer to lose track of the coordinates for their home universe.

Now, they are forced to slide between universes, spending anywhere from minutes to months there, waiting for the timer to count down to the next time they can open a vortex to a new universe, hoping it is their original one. Failing to use the vortex to slide at that point would mean they would be stuck in that universe for nearly three decades until they can open the vortex again.

While waiting for the timer countdown, the Sliders frequently explore the nature of the alternate universe and often become caught up in events of that world. Some of these universes are based on alternate timelines in which certain historical events happened differently from the history they know, such as one where penicillin was never discovered, or a world where America had lost the Revolutionary War; while other worlds have entirely novel histories, such as one where time flowed in reverse, or where dinosaurs never became extinct.

The main initial cast included Quinn Mallory (Jerry O&#x27;Connell), who created the Sliding technology, Professor Maximillian Arturo (John Rhys-Davies), Quinn&#x27;s mentor; Wade Welles (Sabrina Lloyd), Quinn&#x27;s friend; and Rembrandt &quot;Cryin&#x27; Man&quot; Brown (Cleavant Derricks), a professional singer who is accidentally caught in the first major test of the vortex. Over the course of the show, cast members departed and were replaced by others: Captain Maggie Beckett (Kari Wuhrer), a military officer from one doomed alternate Earth; Colin Mallory (Charlie O&#x27;Connell), Quinn&#x27;s lost brother; a second Quinn Mallory (Robert Floyd) that resulted from the original Quinn inadvertently merging with the Quinn of a world they slid into, and Dr. Diana Davis (Tembi Locke), a scientist who attempts to help them reverse the process.

==Episodes==

==Cast==
===Main===
* While Sabrina Lloyd returned as a guest, she provided only the voice for her character, played by a barely-visible body-double.

===Recurring===
* Angus Rickman (first portrayed by Roger Daltrey for 2 episodes and then by Neil Dickson for 4 episodes): A colonel and Maggie&#x27;s superior officer.
* Elston Diggs (portrayed by Lester Barrie): A bartender.
* Oberon Geiger (portrayed by Peter Jurasik): Diana&#x27;s boss.
* Amanda Mallory (portrayed by Linda Kaye Henning): Quinn&#x27;s adoptive mother on Earth Prime
* Michael Mallory (portrayed by John Walcutt): Quinn&#x27;s father whose Earth Prime version died when Quinn was young.
* Gomez Calhoun (portrayed by Will Sasso)
* Pavel Kurlienko (portrayed by Alex Bruhanski): A taxi driver.

==Production==
Michio Kaku explains in the appendix of his book, &quot;The Future of the Mind&quot;, that the &quot;Sliders&quot; series began &quot;when a young boy read a book. That book is actually my book &quot;Hyperspace&quot;, but I take no responsibility for the physics behind that series.&quot; Before moving to Sci-Fi Channel each episode of the series cost $1.4 million to $1.5 million.

While filming the episode &quot;Desert Storm&quot;, actor Ken Steadman (Cutter) was killed. In an accident that occurred between takes, Steadman moved a dune buggy to the next shooting location. While he was moving the vehicle, the dune buggy overturned and crushed him, killing him instantly. According to Steadman&#x27;s parents, his death was preventable.

Entering into the fifth season, the production team knew the series was not being renewed and had saved money from the budget of each season five episode for use in a climactic battle for the season finale. The money was instead used for the penultimate episode, &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot;, while the last episode ended with an unresolved cliffhanger. Insiders have various theories as to why this happened. The producers were concerned the Sci Fi Channel had lost interest in the show (even though it was their highest-rated program at the time) after they ceased supplying corrective notes for the episodes, and it was believed they were not even reading the scripts.

One strict rule the Sci Fi Channel had was that a gun couldn&#x27;t be pointed at a person&#x27;s head. To test this rule, executive producer Bill Dial presented a script featuring a character getting his head shot completely off—which was ignored. Dial then presented the script for the final episode cliffhanger, which was also ignored. Some claim this was done to encourage fans to push for a sixth season, but members of the production team claim that the decision was personal.

Iranian-American director Reza Badiyi is credited with directing a number of the episodes in the fifth season, and his daughter, Mina Badiyi, makes a guest appearance in Episode 3, &quot;Common Ground&quot;.

=== Changing cast and crew ===

&quot;Sliders&quot; had a turbulent history due to changes in the cast and crew through its run. Cleavant Derricks is the only cast member to stay with the series throughout its entire run. Derricks and Linda Henning (Mrs. Mallory) are the only actors to appear in both the first and last episodes of the series. Derricks&#x27; identical twin, Clinton Derricks-Carroll, appeared in the episodes &quot;The King Is Back&quot;, &quot;Greatfellas&quot;, and &quot;The Prince of Slides&quot;, when there was a need for Rembrandt and his double to interact.

==== Third season transitions ====
Jerry O&#x27;Connell felt the first two seasons went smoothly, but then there was a significant shift in creative direction of the series with the third season, with the Fox network desiring it to be a more action-oriented show than thought-provoking. John Rhys-Davies was the first star of the series to leave. Rhys-Davies stated in a 2016 interview that he had been critical of how the show was written, calling the concept what &quot;could&#x27;ve been the best show on television&quot;, but most of the scripts he had been given were &quot;incomprehensible gibberish&quot; and missed the potential of the concept. He cited that Fox had exerted too much control on the scripts as part of the reason for his departure.

In a 2014 interview at the Toulouse Game Show, Rhys-Davies stated that the inability to get writers who had read science fiction in the first place led to the show&#x27;s downfall, and their inexperience in the area led to the show often repurposing ideas from other works. He said, &quot;We did an episode like &quot;Tremors&quot;, one like &quot;Twister&quot;, one like &quot;The Night of the Living Dead&quot; and even one like &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot;, using the film&#x27;s original masks!&quot; He found the writers were just &quot;looting&quot; these ideas rather than using these as a tribute, pointing to one episode in which Quinn needed to cross an invisible bridge and on approaching the writer about it, discovered he had never seen &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; which Rhys-Davies had starred in and simply used the idea instead of toying with the meta nature of the scene.

For Rhys-Davies, &quot;the breaking point for me was when I walked in and saw the writers sitting around looking at a DVD of &quot;Species&quot; which had just been released and saying: &#x27;Look, we could take a bit of that scene there and a bit of that scene there.&#x27;&quot;

The series co-creator, Tracy Tormé, has often been critical of the direction the series took in the third season. Tormé called the third season two-parter &quot;Exodus&quot; &quot;one of the worst pieces of television ever produced, and the low point of the entire series&quot;. David Peckinpah was brought onto the series in the third season (around the time when Tormé started to criticize the show). The last episode to be written by Tormé was K1803, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and the first to be written by Peckinpah was K1815, &quot;Murder Most Foul&quot;. Some argue Peckinpah&#x27;s involvement in the series (and by extension Fox&#x27;s more hands-on involvement) caused the show to &quot;jump the shark&quot;, despite new executive producer Marc Scott Zicree&#x27;s decision to restore Tracy Tormé&#x27;s original &quot;alternate history&quot; premise for the series in season 4. Tormé, along with co-creators Robert K. Weiss and John Landis, all departed the show during the third season.

Part of Fox&#x27;s involvement in the third season was to shift production from Vancouver to Los Angeles to reduce filming costs. The recurring characters were dropped due to the expense of flying them from Vancouver to Los Angeles for filming. Bartender Elston Diggs was brought in as a recurring character for six episodes, but Peckinpah eventually rejected the concept. Logan St. Clair was created to be a recurring character, which is evident in the episode&#x27;s dialogue, but only appeared once. Fox did not believe she was &quot;sexy&quot; enough and requested she not appear again.

==== Cancellation by Fox and pickup by Sci-Fi ====
Fox canceled the show after the third season, but it was later picked up by the Sci-Fi network. Jerry O&#x27;Connell felt that Sci-Fi was looking to maintain the action-based show with more emphasis on darker sci-fi elements. Lloyd decided not to return to the series when it was revived, according to her agency. A source came forward claiming Lloyd was fired because she was jealous of Kari Wuhrer. Universal and Lloyd&#x27;s agent both refused to comment and the rumour spread.

Much later it was revealed that Lloyd and Wuhrer did not get along, primarily due to some snide comments Wuhrer had made about Lloyd&#x27;s engagement to a crew member. As Peckinpah wanted to return to the 3 male/1 female dynamic of the first two seasons, it was decided Lloyd was no longer required after she asked for a raise. Her character&#x27;s fate—to be trapped in a Kromagg breeding camp—was allegedly Peckinpah&#x27;s idea, and one that was pushed through by him alone.

As a result of public pressure to elaborate on what happened to Wade after she disappeared, the producers asked Lloyd to guest star in one season five episode that was to focus entirely on Wade (without the rest of the cast). Lloyd requested $40,000 to appear, the same per-episode salary Derricks was receiving and $20,000 more than Wuhrer, and the idea was scrapped. However, the episode she was to appear in, &quot;Requiem&quot;, was &quot;fine tuned&quot; to answer this question without her. Lloyd ultimately provided voiceovers for the episode, and a stand-in was used.

By the end of the fourth season, Jerry and Charlie O&#x27;Connell left the series to pursue film careers. Jerry O&#x27;Connell felt that without Lloyd, Rhys-Davies, and Tormé, that much of the show&#x27;s original premise was gone, and opted to leave. The brothers leaving the show upset many fans and Tracy Tormé was asked what could be done to win them back. This resulted in an unsuccessful effort to bring back some popular previously recurring characters.

The producers negotiated with John Novak (Ross J. Kelly, the ambulance-chasing lawyer), Alex Bruhanski (Pavel Kurlienko, the taxi driver) and Lester Barrie (Elston Diggs the waiter at the Chandler Hotel) for their return in season five. Zoe McLellan (Logan St. Clair) was scheduled to appear again and Jason Gaffney (Conrad Bennish, Jr) from season one was confirmed for four episodes including the season finale. However, none of these guest stars appeared.

==Broadcast==

=== Season 1===
Quinn, eager to demonstrate his vortex technology to Prof. Arturo and Wade, inadvertently opens a large wormhole that draws Rembrandt with them to a hostile ice-covered Earth. Quinn is forced to activate the vortex prematurely to save them, and they find themselves unable to return to their Earth. So not to be stranded on any alternate Earth for over 20 years, the group continues to slide between worlds, many of them involving alternate histories, such as if the British had won the Revolutionary War, or if antibiotics had never been discovered.

===Season 2===
The group continues to slide between alternate Earths, exploring further alternate timelines and more fantastical variations from the Earth they know. On one slide, they encounter the Kromaggs, an alien species that have perfected sliding and use it to strip resources from alternate earths. The Kromaggs become aggressively curious about Quinn&#x27;s technology.

===Season 3===
As they continue to slide, hoping to return to their prime dimension, the Sliders land on an Earth that is doomed by a passing pulsar, they provide a means to evacuate a small portion of its population to a safe dimension; however, the exodus is betrayed by a new enemy in Colonel Rickman who needs brain fluid to survive a disease he obtained in a gulf war. While protecting Quinn Prof. Arturo sacrifices himself. The group, now joined by Captain Maggie Beckett, pursue Rickman to acquire a Timer he stole with Earth Prime&#x27;s location saved into it. While Wade and Rembrandt make it back, Quinn and Maggie end up stuck on another alternate Earth.

===Season 4===
Quinn and Maggie find a way to return to Earth Prime, but they find it taken over by the Kromaggs; they are able to rescue Rembrandt but not Wade. Quinn&#x27;s mother tells him he is actually adopted, born from parents that knew of sliding technology and used it to hide him from the Kromaggs. She also tells him where to find his brother, Colin, who then joins the Sliders. The group continue to slide, hoping to find a means to deal with the Kromaggs on Earth Prime and in other dimensions.

===Season 5===
In what at first appears to be a freak sliding accident, Quinn merges with the Quinn of the dimension they have slid into, merging them into &quot;Mallory&quot;, while Colin is lost to the vortex, as explained to them by Dr. Diana Davis, a scientist studying transdimensional travel. She later slides with Mallory, Maggie, and Rembrandt as they continue to search for a way to stop the Kromaggs. Ultimately, they discover a contagious virus, deadly to Kromaggs. After the timer is destroyed, they find they can send one slider back to Earth Prime. Rembrandt injects himself with the virus and jumps through, leaving the three unsure of his fate.

=== Broadcast order ===
The Fox Network aired certain episodes from seasons one and two in a different order than originally scripted to best capitalize on potential ratings-winning episodes, thus causing some continuity errors. For instance, the timer is first set to count down not in the pilot episode, but in &quot;Summer of Love&quot;—since Fox aired &quot;Fever&quot; right &quot;after&quot; the pilot episode, though, many viewers were left confused as to why the Sliders suddenly had to leave within a very specific period of time. Similarly, the cliffhanger at the end of &quot;Summer of Love&quot; leads directly into the opening of &quot;Prince of Wails&quot;, which Fox had actually aired a week earlier.

For season two, Fox did not want to resolve the cliffhanger at the end of &quot;Luck of the Draw&quot;, preferring to focus instead on brand-new storylines. Thus, in &quot;Time Again and World&quot; (the first episode filmed for Season Two), Arturo makes a brief passing reference to the events of &quot;Luck of the Draw.&quot; This missed cliffhanger was particularly significant as the episode had ended with Quinn being shot in the back. Tracy Tormé successfully petitioned for a chance to resolve the cliffhanger, though, which is briefly dealt with in the opening minutes of &quot;Into the Mystic&quot; (the third episode filmed, but the first to air that season) where the life-threatening wound is now merely a flesh wound in his shoulder, allowing for a quick recovery. &quot;Time Again and World&quot; ended up airing sixth in the rotation.

&quot;Double Cross&quot; was filmed as the premiere for season three. In this episode, the audience learns why the Sliders will now be able to slide anywhere between San Francisco and L.A. Fox opted to air &quot;Rules of the Game&quot; first, since it was a more action-oriented episode.

&quot;The Last of Eden&quot; was filmed before John Rhys-Davies left the show. Fox chose to air the episode for the first time on March 28, a full month &quot;after&quot; Arturo had been written off the show, requiring a new opening scene be added to frame the story as a flashback.

When the show began airing in reruns on the Sci Fi Channel, Sci Fi restored the original filmed order for season one. When the DVDs were released, Universal used the aired order for all seasons.

== Home media ==
Universal Studios Home Entertainment has released all five seasons on DVD in Region 1, 2, and 4. The fifth and final season was released in Region 1 on January 17, 2012, almost 4 years after season 4.

On December 2, 2014, Universal released &quot;Sliders- The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1. This set contains all 88 episodes of the series on 22 single sided discs with a run time of 66 hours (3954 minutes).

On July 1, 2016, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to the series in Region 1 and would re-release the complete series on DVD on October 4, 2016. The 15-disc set contains all 5 seasons of the series in correct story order.

On August 23, 2007, Netflix Instant View started providing all five seasons of &quot;Sliders&quot; available for streaming. Two season 1 episodes (&quot;Last Days&quot;, and &quot;The Weaker Sex&quot;) are missing with a note in their place stating that the DVD is required to view the episode. The first episode, &quot;Pilot&quot;, is available both as one combined episode, and as two separate parts, &quot;Pilot Part 1&quot; and &quot;Pilot Part 2&quot;. All episodes of the remaining seasons (2-5) are available for streaming.

On March 12, 2008, Universal Studios added &quot;Sliders&quot; season one to their free online viewing service, Hulu. Season two was added on May 8, 2009, and season three was added on July 2, 2009.

In late 2008, season five and eventually all five seasons were made available through iTunes TV Shows store.

In August 2020, all episodes were available with free version of Peacock, although the pilot episode was split into two approximately 45-minute segments. The series was originally mistakenly listed as &quot;Drama&quot; rather than &quot;Sci-Fi&quot; but that was corrected within a month. As of February 2023, the series was no longer available for free on Peacock TV after all episodes were moved to pay to view.

== Revival ==
On February 22, 2015, in a &quot;Sliders&quot; 20th anniversary interview, when asked about a revival of the series, Jerry O&#x27;Connell stated, “Tracy Tormé is the guy to talk to. I am in if he is. That is the creator and boss. I go where he tells me.” Both Jerry O&#x27;Connell and John Rhys-Davies have spoken of a potential revival of the series as recently as 2019.

According to Rhys-Davies, O&#x27;Connell had been in private talks with him over a possible revival, which Rhys-Davies said he would do if the series stayed focused on the thought-provoking aspects of the alternate worlds. The two have spoken to NBC about this, as the rights to distribute &quot;Sliders&quot; are believed to be held by NBCUniversal. O&#x27;Connell has also said that Tormé is interested in a revival as well. On 14 July 2021, Tormé stated in an interview that a Sliders reboot is actively in the works.

On January 4, 2024, series creator Tracy Tormé died of complications from diabetes. It&#x27;s unknown if the revival is still in the works.

== Connection to other works ==
=== &quot;Doorways&quot; ===
The plotlines in &quot;Sliders&quot; are all set around the idea of a multiverse, where the outcomes of non-deterministic quantum processes result in the splitting of reality into multiple universes, each existing in parallel. There has also been speculation that &quot;Sliders&quot; was inspired by George R. R. Martin&#x27;s 1992 ABC pilot &quot;Doorways&quot;, in which the main cast were fugitives fleeing through parallel worlds, while carrying a device that tells them where and when the next Doorway opens.

Although scripts for six additional episodes after the pilot film were completed, &quot;Doorways&quot; never went to series, as ABC decided to launch &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; instead in the fall of 1993. At the time of &quot;Sliders&quot;&#x27; launch, Evelyn C. Leeper noted the similarities to &quot;Doorways&quot;, and in response to rumors that &quot;Sliders&quot; creator Tracy Tormé applied for a writing position on the show, Martin clarified in a 1995 post on GEnie that it was Tormé&#x27;s agent that inquired about the position, and Tormé has denied any connection between the two.

=== &quot;Sliders&quot;-branded works ===
* The pilot episode of &quot;Sliders&quot; was novelized by science-fiction writer Brad Linaweaver, and was released in the spring of 1996, one year after the series originally premiered. Linaweaver&#x27;s novelization incorporates several deleted scenes from the original pilot episode production script, along with Linaweaver&#x27;s own additions to the plot.
* Linaweaver also later compiled an episodic guide to the show, &quot;Sliders: The Classic Episodes&quot;, which contained information only on Seasons One through Three.
* Dennis McCarthy produced a &quot;Sliders&quot; soundtrack in 2007 with complete scores to both the episodes from the first season he scored, which included the pilot. As of late 2010, no other scoring from the series&#x27; other composers has been released.
* &quot;Sliders&quot; was also spun off into a 10 issue comic book series published by Acclaim Comics in 1996. This comics series had no direct input from series creators Tracy Tormé and Robert K.

While advertised and solicited for advance order, the eleventh and final &quot;Sliders&quot; comic, titled &quot;Get a Life&quot;, never made it to store shelves; but artist Rags Morales completed art for 14 pages of the comic before production was stopped.
* &quot;Sliders&quot; trading cards were produced by Inkworks in 1997. The set consisted of 90 cards, including nine embossed cards, six foil cards combining to make a large portrait of the Kromagg homeworld, two lenticular cards, and one promotional card by the Official Sliders Fan Club.

<text>The following is a list of episodes for the Fox and Sci Fi Channel original series &quot;Sliders&quot;. The series aired on Fox from March 1995 to May 1997 and on the Sci Fi Channel from June 1998 to February 2000. A total of 88 episodes were produced.

==Series overview==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Episodes==
===Season 1 (1995)===

Fox changed the intended order of the episodes, beginning with episodes they thought would draw in audiences. This often causes confusion and sometimes chronological errors in continuity with respect to the story arc (for example, episode 5 &quot;Prince of Wails&quot; opens with the resolution to the cliffhanger brought about in episode 6 &quot;Summer of Love&quot;).

===Season 2 (1996)===
As in Season 1, Fox again broadcast the episodes out of their intended order, this time even changing the finale. The intended order of the episodes is shown by the production codes.

===Season 3 (1996–1997)===
Again, Fox aired this season&#x27;s episodes out of order. For instance, &quot;Double Cross&quot; was filmed as the premiere for Season Three. In this episode, the audience learns why the Sliders will now be able to slide anywhere between San Francisco and L.A. However, Fox opted to air &quot;Rules of the Game&quot; first, since it was a more action-oriented episode. The intended order of the episodes is shown by the production codes. The broadcast viewing order is as follows:

===Season 4 (1998–1999)===
===Season 5 (1999–2000)===
==Notes==
* Episode titles for season one were not shown on screen; they come from production scripts, and DVD descriptions.

<doc id="165146" wikidata="Q177897" url="?curid=165146" title="Inductance">
<text>Inductance is the tendency of an electrical conductor to oppose a change in the electric current flowing through it. The electric current produces a magnetic field around the conductor. The magnetic field strength depends on the magnitude of the electric current, and therefore follows any changes in the magnitude of the current. From Faraday&#x27;s law of induction, any change in magnetic field through a circuit induces an electromotive force (EMF) (voltage) in the conductors, a process known as electromagnetic induction. This induced voltage created by the changing current has the effect of opposing the change in current. This is stated by Lenz&#x27;s law, and the voltage is called &quot;back EMF&quot;.

Inductance is defined as the ratio of the induced voltage to the rate of change of current causing it. It is a proportionality constant that depends on the geometry of circuit conductors (e.g., cross-section area and length) and the magnetic permeability of the conductor and nearby materials. An electronic component designed to add inductance to a circuit is called an inductor. It typically consists of a coil or helix of wire.

The term &quot;inductance&quot; was coined by Oliver Heaviside in May 1884, as a convenient way to refer to &quot;coefficient of self-induction&quot;. It is customary to use the symbol formula_1 for inductance, in honour of the physicist Heinrich Lenz. In the SI system, the unit of inductance is the henry (H), which is the amount of inductance that causes a voltage of one volt, when the current is changing at a rate of one ampere per second. The unit is named for Joseph Henry, who discovered inductance independently of Faraday.

== History ==

The history of electromagnetic induction, a facet of electromagnetism, began with observations of the ancients: electric charge or static electricity (rubbing silk on amber), electric current (lightning), and magnetic attraction (lodestone). Understanding the unity of these forces of nature, and the scientific theory of electromagnetism was initiated and achieved during the 19th century.

Electromagnetic induction was first described by Michael Faraday in 1831. In Faraday&#x27;s experiment, he wrapped two wires around opposite sides of an iron ring. He expected that, when current started to flow in one wire, a sort of wave would travel through the ring and cause some electrical effect on the opposite side. Using a galvanometer, he observed a transient current flow in the second coil of wire each time that a battery was connected or disconnected from the first coil. This current was induced by the change in magnetic flux that occurred when the battery was connected and disconnected. Faraday found several other manifestations of electromagnetic induction. For example, he saw transient currents when he quickly slid a bar magnet in and out of a coil of wires, and he generated a steady (DC) current by rotating a copper disk near the bar magnet with a sliding electrical lead (&quot;Faraday&#x27;s disk&quot;).

== Source of inductance ==
A current formula_2 flowing through a conductor generates a magnetic field around the conductor, which is described by Ampere&#x27;s circuital law. The total magnetic flux formula_3 through a circuit is equal to the product of the perpendicular component of the magnetic flux density and the area of the surface spanning the current path. If the current varies, the magnetic flux formula_3 through the circuit changes. By Faraday&#x27;s law of induction, any change in flux through a circuit induces an electromotive force (EMF, in the circuit, proportional to the rate of change of flux

formula_5

The negative sign in the equation indicates that the induced voltage is in a direction which opposes the change in current that created it; this is called Lenz&#x27;s law. The potential is therefore called a back EMF. If the current is increasing, the voltage is positive at the end of the conductor through which the current enters and negative at the end through which it leaves, tending to reduce the current. If the current is decreasing, the voltage is positive at the end through which the current leaves the conductor, tending to maintain the current. Self-inductance, usually just called inductance, formula_1 is the ratio between the induced voltage and the rate of change of the current

formula_7

Thus, inductance is a property of a conductor or circuit, due to its magnetic field, which tends to oppose changes in current through the circuit. The unit of inductance in the SI system is the henry (H), named after Joseph Henry, which is the amount of inductance that generates a voltage of one volt when the current is changing at a rate of one ampere per second.

All conductors have some inductance, which may have either desirable or detrimental effects in practical electrical devices. The inductance of a circuit depends on the geometry of the current path, and on the magnetic permeability of nearby materials; ferromagnetic materials with a higher permeability like iron near a conductor tend to increase the magnetic field and inductance. Any alteration to a circuit which increases the flux (total magnetic field) through the circuit produced by a given current increases the inductance, because inductance is also equal to the ratio of magnetic flux to current

formula_8

An inductor is an electrical component consisting of a conductor shaped to increase the magnetic flux, to add inductance to a circuit. Typically it consists of a wire wound into a coil or helix. A coiled wire has a higher inductance than a straight wire of the same length, because the magnetic field lines pass through the circuit multiple times, it has multiple flux linkages. The inductance is proportional to the square of the number of turns in the coil, assuming full flux linkage.

The inductance of a coil can be increased by placing a magnetic core of ferromagnetic material in the hole in the center. The magnetic field of the coil magnetizes the material of the core, aligning its magnetic domains, and the magnetic field of the core adds to that of the coil, increasing the flux through the coil. This is called a ferromagnetic core inductor. A magnetic core can increase the inductance of a coil by thousands of times.

If multiple electric circuits are located close to each other, the magnetic field of one can pass through the other; in this case the circuits are said to be &quot;inductively coupled&quot;. Due to Faraday&#x27;s law of induction, a change in current in one circuit can cause a change in magnetic flux in another circuit and thus induce a voltage in another circuit. The concept of inductance can be generalized in this case by defining the mutual inductance formula_9 of circuit formula_10 and circuit formula_11 as the ratio of voltage induced in circuit formula_11 to the rate of change of current in circuit This is the principle behind a &quot;transformer&quot;. The property describing the effect of one conductor on itself is more precisely called &quot;self-inductance&quot;, and the properties describing the effects of one conductor with changing current on nearby conductors is called &quot;mutual inductance&quot;.

== Self-inductance and magnetic energy ==
If the current through a conductor with inductance is increasing, a voltage formula_13 is induced across the conductor with a polarity that opposes the current—in addition to any voltage drop caused by the conductor&#x27;s resistance. The charges flowing through the circuit lose potential energy. The energy from the external circuit required to overcome this &quot;potential hill&quot; is stored in the increased magnetic field around the conductor. Therefore, an inductor stores energy in its magnetic field. At any given time formula_14 the power formula_15 flowing into the magnetic field, which is equal to the rate of change of the stored energy is the product of the current formula_16 and voltage formula_13 across the conductor

formula_18

From (1) above

formula_19

When there is no current, there is no magnetic field and the stored energy is zero. Neglecting resistive losses, the energy formula_20 (measured in joules, in SI) stored by an inductance with a current formula_21 through it is equal to the amount of work required to establish the current through the inductance from zero, and therefore the magnetic field. This is given by:

formula_22

If the inductance formula_23 is constant over the current range, the stored energy is

formula_24

Inductance is therefore also proportional to the energy stored in the magnetic field for a given current. This energy is stored as long as the current remains constant. If the current decreases, the magnetic field decreases, inducing a voltage in the conductor in the opposite direction, negative at the end through which current enters and positive at the end through which it leaves. This returns stored magnetic energy to the external circuit.

If ferromagnetic materials are located near the conductor, such as in an inductor with a magnetic core, the constant inductance equation above is only valid for linear regions of the magnetic flux, at currents below the level at which the ferromagnetic material saturates, where the inductance is approximately constant. If the magnetic field in the inductor approaches the level at which the core saturates, the inductance begins to change with current, and the integral equation must be used.

== Inductive reactance ==
When a sinusoidal alternating current (AC) is passing through a linear inductance, the induced back- is also sinusoidal. If the current through the inductance is formula_25, from (1) above the voltage across it is
formula_26

where formula_27 is the amplitude (peak value) of the sinusoidal current in amperes, formula_28 is the angular frequency of the alternating current, with formula_29 being its frequency in hertz, and formula_1 is the inductance.

Thus the amplitude (peak value) of the voltage across the inductance is

formula_31

Inductive reactance is the opposition of an inductor to an alternating current. It is defined analogously to electrical resistance in a resistor, as the ratio of the amplitude (peak value) of the alternating voltage to current in the component

formula_32

Reactance has units of ohms. It can be seen that inductive reactance of an inductor increases proportionally with frequency so an inductor conducts less current for a given applied AC voltage as the frequency increases. Because the induced voltage is greatest when the current is increasing, the voltage and current waveforms are out of phase; the voltage peaks occur earlier in each cycle than the current peaks. The phase difference between the current and the induced voltage is formula_33 radians or 90 degrees, showing that in an ideal inductor &quot;the current lags the voltage by 90°&quot;.

==Calculating inductance==
In the most general case, inductance can be calculated from Maxwell&#x27;s equations. Many important cases can be solved using simplifications. Where high frequency currents are considered, with skin effect, the surface current densities and magnetic field may be obtained by solving the Laplace equation. Where the conductors are thin wires, self-inductance still depends on the wire radius and the distribution of the current in the wire. This current distribution is approximately constant (on the surface or in the volume of the wire) for a wire radius much smaller than other length scales.

===Inductance of a straight single wire===
As a practical matter, longer wires have more inductance, and thicker wires have less, analogous to their electrical resistance (although the relationships are not linear, and are different in kind from the relationships that length and diameter bear to resistance).

Separating the wire from the other parts of the circuit introduces some unavoidable error in any formulas&#x27; results. These inductances are often referred to as “partial inductances”, in part to encourage consideration of the other contributions to whole-circuit inductance which are omitted.

====Practical formulas====
For derivation of the formulas below, see Rosa (1908).
The total low frequency inductance (interior plus exterior) of a straight wire is:

formula_34

where 
* formula_35 is the &quot;low-frequency&quot; or DC inductance in nanohenry (nH or 10−9H),
* formula_11 is the length of the wire in meters,
* formula_37 is the radius of the wire in meters (hence a very small decimal number),
* the constant formula_38 is the permeability of free space, commonly called formula_39, divided by formula_40; in the absence of magnetically reactive insulation the value 200 is exact when using the classical definition of &quot;μ&quot;0 = , and correct to 7 decimal places when using the 2019-redefined SI value of &quot;μ&quot;0 = .

The constant 0.75 is just one parameter value among several; different frequency ranges, different shapes, or extremely long wire lengths require a slightly different constant (see below). This result is based on the assumption that the radius formula_37 is much less than the length which is the common case for wires and rods. Disks or thick cylinders have slightly different formulas.

For sufficiently high frequencies skin effects cause the interior currents to vanish, leaving only the currents on the surface of the conductor; the inductance for alternating current, formula_42 is then given by a very similar formula:

formula_43
where the variables formula_11 and formula_37 are the same as above; note the changed constant term now 1, from 0.75 above.

In an example from everyday experience, just one of the conductors of a lamp cord long, made of 18 AWG wire, would only have an inductance of about if stretched out straight.
===Self-inductance of a wire loop===
Formally, the self-inductance of a wire loop would be given by the above equation with formula_46 However, here formula_47 becomes infinite, leading to a logarithmically divergent integral.
This necessitates taking the finite wire radius formula_48 and the distribution of the current in the wire into account. There remains the contribution from the integral over all points and a correction term,

: formula_49

where
: formula_50 and formula_51 are distances along the curves formula_52 and formula_53 respectively
: formula_48 is the radius of the wire 
: formula_55 is the length of the wire
: formula_56 is a constant that depends on the distribution of the current in the wire:
:: formula_57 when the current flows on the surface of the wire (total skin effect),
:: formula_58 when the current is evenly over the cross-section of the wire. 
: formula_59 is an error term whose size depends on the curve of the loop:
:: formula_60 when the loop has sharp corners, and
:: formula_61 when it is a smooth curve.
:: Both are small when the wire is long compared to its radius.

===Inductance of a solenoid===
A solenoid is a long, thin coil; i.e., a coil whose length is much greater than its diameter. Under these conditions, and without any magnetic material used, the magnetic flux density formula_62 within the coil is practically constant and is given by
formula_63

where formula_64 is the magnetic constant, formula_65 the number of turns, formula_2 the current and formula_67 the length of the coil. Ignoring end effects, the total magnetic flux through the coil is obtained by multiplying the flux density formula_62 by the cross-section area 
formula_69

When this is combined with the definition of inductance it follows that the inductance of a solenoid is given by:
formula_70

Therefore, for air-core coils, inductance is a function of coil geometry and number of turns, and is independent of current.

===Inductance of a coaxial cable===
Let the inner conductor have radius formula_71 and permeability let the dielectric between the inner and outer conductor have permeability and let the outer conductor have inner radius outer radius and permeability However, for a typical coaxial line application, we are interested in passing (non-DC) signals at frequencies for which the resistive skin effect cannot be neglected. In most cases, the inner and outer conductor terms are negligible, in which case one may approximate

formula_72

===Inductance of multilayer coils===
Most practical air-core inductors are multilayer cylindrical coils with square cross-sections to minimize average distance between turns (circular cross -sections would be better but harder to form).

===Magnetic cores===
Many inductors include a magnetic core at the center of or partly surrounding the winding. Over a large enough range these exhibit a nonlinear permeability with effects such as magnetic saturation. Saturation makes the resulting inductance a function of the applied current.

The secant or large-signal inductance is used in flux calculations. It is defined as:

formula_73

The differential or small-signal inductance, on the other hand, is used in calculating voltage. It is defined as:

formula_74

The circuit voltage for a nonlinear inductor is obtained via the differential inductance as shown by Faraday&#x27;s Law and the chain rule of calculus.

formula_75

Similar definitions may be derived for nonlinear mutual inductance.

==Mutual inductance==
=== Definition of Mutual induction or Coefficient of mutual induction ===
The mutual inductance or the coefficient of mutual induction of two magnetically linked coils is equal to the flux linkage of one coil per unit current in the neighboring coil. OR

The mutual inductance or the coefficient of mutual induction of two magnetically linked coils is numerically equal to the emf induced in one coil (secondary) per unit time rate of change of current in the neighboring coil (primary).

===Mutual inductance of two parallel straight wires===
There are two cases to consider:
# Current travels in the same direction in each wire, and
# current travels in opposing directions in the wires.
Currents in the wires need not be equal, though they often are, as in the case of a complete circuit, where one wire is the source and the other the return.

===Mutual inductance of two wire loops===
This is the generalized case of the paradigmatic two-loop cylindrical coil carrying a uniform low frequency current; the loops are independent closed circuits that can have different lengths, any orientation in space, and carry different currents. Nonetheless, the error terms, which are not included in the integral are only small if the geometries of the loops are mostly smooth and convex: They must not have too many kinks, sharp corners, coils, crossovers, parallel segments, concave cavities, or other topologically &quot;close&quot; deformations. A necessary predicate for the reduction of the 3-dimensional manifold integration formula to a double curve integral is that the current paths be filamentary circuits, i.e. thin wires where the radius of the wire is negligible compared to its length.

The mutual inductance by a filamentary circuit formula_76 on a filamentary circuit formula_77 is given by the double integral &quot;Neumann formula&quot;
: formula_78

where
: formula_79 and formula_80 are the curves followed by the wires.
: formula_64 is the permeability of free space ()
: formula_82 is a small increment of the wire in circuit 
: formula_83 is the position of formula_82 in space
: formula_85 is a small increment of the wire in circuit 
: formula_86 is the position of formula_85 in space.

===Derivation===
formula_88

where
* formula_89 is the current through the formula_90th wire, this current creates the magnetic flux formula_91through the formula_2th surface
* formula_93 is the magnetic flux through the &quot;i&quot;th surface due to the electrical circuit outlined by 
formula_94

where
Stokes&#x27; theorem has been used for the 3rd equality step. For the last equality step, we used the retarded potential expression for formula_95 and we ignore the effect of the retarded time (assuming the geometry of the circuits is small enough compared to the wavelength of the current they carry). It is actually an approximation step, and is valid only for local circuits made of thin wires.

Mutual inductance is defined as the ratio between the EMF induced in one loop or coil by the rate of change of current in another loop or coil. Mutual inductance is given the symbol .

=== Derivation of mutual inductance ===
The inductance equations above are a consequence of Maxwell&#x27;s equations. For the important case of electrical circuits consisting of thin wires, the derivation is straightforward.

In a system of formula_96 wire loops, each with one or several wire turns, the flux linkage of loop is given by
formula_97

Here formula_98 denotes the number of turns in loop formula_99 is the magnetic flux through loop and formula_100 are some constants described below. This equation follows from Ampere&#x27;s law: &quot;magnetic fields and fluxes are linear functions of the currents&quot;. By Faraday&#x27;s law of induction, we have

formula_101

where formula_102 denotes the voltage induced in circuit This agrees with the definition of inductance above if the coefficients formula_100 are identified with the coefficients of inductance. Because the total currents formula_104 contribute to formula_99 it also follows that formula_100 is proportional to the product of turns 

=== Mutual inductance and magnetic field energy ===
Multiplying the equation for &quot;vm&quot; above with &quot;imdt&quot; and summing over &quot;m&quot; gives the energy transferred to the system in the time interval &quot;dt&quot;,
formula_107

This must agree with the change of the magnetic field energy, &quot;W&quot;, caused by the currents. The integrability condition

formula_108

requires &quot;Lm,n = Ln,m&quot;. The inductance matrix, &quot;Lm,n&quot;, thus is symmetric. The integral of the energy transfer is the magnetic field energy as a function of the currents,
formula_109

This equation also is a direct consequence of the linearity of Maxwell&#x27;s equations. It is helpful to associate changing electric currents with a build-up or decrease of magnetic field energy. The corresponding energy transfer requires or generates a voltage. A mechanical analogy in the &quot;K&quot; = 1 case with magnetic field energy (1/2)&quot;Li&quot;2 is a body with mass &quot;M&quot;, velocity &quot;u&quot; and kinetic energy (1/2)&quot;Mu&quot;2. The rate of change of velocity (current) multiplied with mass (inductance) requires or generates a force (an electrical voltage).

Mutual inductance occurs when the change in current in one inductor induces a voltage in another nearby inductor. It is important as the mechanism by which transformers work, but it can also cause unwanted coupling between conductors in a circuit.

The mutual inductance, is also a measure of the coupling between two inductors. The mutual inductance by circuit formula_2 on circuit formula_90 is given by the double integral &quot;Neumann formula&quot;, see calculation techniques

The mutual inductance also has the relationship:
formula_112
where

Once the mutual inductance formula_113 is determined, it can be used to predict the behavior of a circuit:
formula_114
where

The minus sign arises because of the sense the current formula_115 has been defined in the diagram. With both currents defined going into the dots the sign of formula_113 will be positive (the equation would read with a plus sign instead).

===Coupling coefficient===

The coupling coefficient is the ratio of the open-circuit actual voltage ratio to the ratio that would be obtained if all the flux coupled from one magnetic circuit to the other. The coupling coefficient is related to mutual inductance and self inductances in the following way. From the two simultaneous equations expressed in the two-port matrix the open-circuit voltage ratio is found to be:

formula_117
where

while the ratio if all the flux is coupled is the ratio of the turns, hence the ratio of the square root of the inductances

formula_118

thus,

formula_119
where

The coupling coefficient is a convenient way to specify the relationship between a certain orientation of inductors with arbitrary inductance. Most authors define the range as but some define it as Allowing negative values of formula_10 captures phase inversions of the coil connections and the direction of the windings.

===Matrix representation===
Mutually coupled inductors can be described by any of the two-port network parameter matrix representations. The most direct are the z parameters, which are given by

formula_121

The y parameters are given by

formula_122 Where formula_123 is the complex frequency variable, formula_124 and formula_125 are the inductances of the primary and secondary coil, respectively, and formula_113 is the mutual inductance between the coils.

==== Multiple Coupled Inductors ====
Mutual inductance may be applied to multiple inductors simultaneously. The matrix representations for multiple mutually coupled inductors are given byformula_127

===Equivalent circuits===
====T-circuit====

Mutually coupled inductors can equivalently be represented by a T-circuit of inductors as shown. If the coupling is strong and the inductors are of unequal values then the series inductor on the step-down side may take on a negative value.

This can be analyzed as a two port network. With the output terminated with some arbitrary impedance the voltage gain is given by,

formula_128

where formula_10 is the coupling constant and formula_123 is the complex frequency variable, as above.
For tightly coupled inductors where formula_131 this reduces to

formula_132

which is independent of the load impedance. If the inductors are wound on the same core and with the same geometry, then this expression is equal to the turns ratio of the two inductors because inductance is proportional to the square of turns ratio.

The input impedance of the network is given by,

formula_133

For formula_131 this reduces to

formula_135

Thus, current gain formula_136 is independent of load unless the further condition

formula_137

is met, in which case,

formula_138

and

formula_139

====π-circuit====

Alternatively, two coupled inductors can be modelled using a &quot;π&quot; equivalent circuit with optional ideal transformers at each port. While the circuit is more complicated than a T-circuit, it can be generalized to circuits consisting of more than two coupled inductors. Equivalent circuit elements formula_140 have physical meaning, modelling respectively magnetic reluctances of coupling paths and magnetic reluctances of leakage paths. For example, electric currents flowing through these elements correspond to coupling and leakage magnetic fluxes. Ideal transformers normalize all self-inductances to 1 Henry to simplify mathematical formulas.

Equivalent circuit element values can be calculated from coupling coefficients with
formula_141

where coupling coefficient matrix and its cofactors are defined as
: formula_142 and formula_143

For two coupled inductors, these formulas simplify to
: formula_144 and formula_145

and for three coupled inductors (for brevity shown only for formula_146 and formula_147)

: formula_148 and formula_149

===Resonant transformer===

When a capacitor is connected across one winding of a transformer, making the winding a tuned circuit (resonant circuit) it is called a single-tuned transformer. When a capacitor is connected across each winding, it is called a double tuned transformer. These &quot;resonant transformers&quot; can store oscillating electrical energy similar to a resonant circuit and thus function as a bandpass filter, allowing frequencies near their resonant frequency to pass from the primary to secondary winding, but blocking other frequencies. The amount of mutual inductance between the two windings, together with the Q factor of the circuit, determine the shape of the frequency response curve. The advantage of the double tuned transformer is that it can have a wider bandwidth than a simple tuned circuit. The coupling of double-tuned circuits is described as loose-, critical-, or over-coupled depending on the value of the coupling coefficient When two tuned circuits are loosely coupled through mutual inductance, the bandwidth is narrow. As the amount of mutual inductance increases, the bandwidth continues to grow. When the mutual inductance is increased beyond the critical coupling, the peak in the frequency response curve splits into two peaks, and as the coupling is increased the two peaks move further apart. This is known as overcoupling.

Stongly-coupled self-resonant coils can be used for wireless power transfer between devices in the mid range distances (up to two metres). Strong coupling is required for a high percentage of power transferred, which results in peak splitting of the frequency response.

===Ideal transformers===
When the inductor is referred to as being closely coupled. If in addition, the self-inductances go to infinity, the inductor becomes an ideal transformer. In this case the voltages, currents, and number of turns can be related in the following way:

formula_150
where

Conversely the current:

formula_151
where

The power through one inductor is the same as the power through the other. These equations neglect any forcing by current sources or voltage sources.

==Self-inductance of thin wire shapes==

The table below lists formulas for the self-inductance of various simple shapes made of thin cylindrical conductors (wires). In general these are only accurate if the wire radius formula_152 is much smaller than the dimensions of the shape, and if no ferromagnetic materials are nearby (no magnetic core).

formula_153 is an approximately constant value between 0 and 1 that depends on the distribution of the current in the wire: when the current flows only on the surface of the wire (complete skin effect), when the current is evenly spread over the cross-section of the wire (direct current). For round wires, Rosa (1908) gives a formula equivalent to:

formula_154

where

formula_155 is represents small term(s) that have been dropped from the formula, to make it simpler. Read the term formula_156 as &quot;plus small corrections that vary on the order of (see big O notation).

<doc id="165147" wikidata="Q28963" url="?curid=165147" title="Stereophonics">
<text>Stereophonics are a Welsh rock band formed in 1992 in the village of Cwmaman in the Cynon Valley. The band consists of Kelly Jones (lead vocals, lead guitar, keyboards), Richard Jones (no relation to Kelly; bass guitar, harmonica, backing vocals), Adam Zindani (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Jamie Morrison (drums, percussion) and touring member Tony Kirkham (keyboards). The group previously included Stuart Cable (1992–2003) and then Javier Weyler (2004–2012) on drums. Stereophonics have released twelve studio albums, including eight UK number one albums. A successful compilation album, &quot;Decade in the Sun&quot;, was released in November 2008 and charted at number two on the UK Albums chart.

Described as &quot;classic UK rock delivered with whiskey vocals&quot;, the band have been summarised as possessing a sound akin to the genres of alternative rock and &quot;British traditional rock&quot;. Stereophonics&#x27; debut album, &quot;Word Gets Around&quot;, was released in August 1997 and charted at number six in the UK, aided by the singles &quot;Local Boy in the Photograph&quot;, &quot;More Life in a Tramps Vest&quot; and &quot;A Thousand Trees&quot;. The band reached mainstream success with the release of &quot;Performance and Cocktails&quot; (and its promotional singles &quot;The Bartender and the Thief&quot;, &quot;Just Looking&quot; and &quot;Pick a Part That&#x27;s New&quot;) in 1999 and have achieved a total of ten top-ten singles as well as one number one: &quot;Dakota&quot; (2005). Having sold around 10 million copies worldwide by 2016, Stereophonics are one of the most successful Welsh rock acts. Upon their release of &quot;Pull the Pin&quot;, they achieved five consecutive UK number one albums.

The band have also been praised for their live performances, which have landed them headlining slots at many of the UK and Ireland&#x27;s most high-profile music festivals, including Reading and Leeds in 2000, Glastonbury in 2002, V Festival in 2002, the Isle of Wight in 2004 and 2009, Oxegen in 2010, Tramlines Festival and TRNSMT in 2018, and Latitude in 2019. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene.

==History==

=== Formation and early years (1986–1991) ===
Kelly Jones and Stuart Cable lived on the same street in the Welsh village of Cwmaman. Jones heard Cable played drums so asked if he wanted to jam together. After some time practising in Jones&#x27; dad&#x27;s garage, Nicholas Geake joined in on guitar. Later, Jones invited Paul Rosser and Chris Davies to play on bass guitar and keyboards, respectively. Cable recalls he was the one who suggested that Jones be the singer, as his dad was a singer back in the sixties who supported Roy Orbison. In 1986 the band recorded a demo under the name &quot;Zephyr&quot;. When Jones went on holiday the band played a gig without him, which resulted in Jones leaving the band and Jones and Cable going their separate ways. Jones, Rosser and Davies formed their own R&amp;B band called &quot;Silent Runner&quot; while Cable joined a glam-rock band named &quot;King Catwalk&quot; on drums.

A few years later, Cable was sacked from the band. A few weeks later, Cable waved to Jones from a bus, and Jones, who was standing at a bus stop, waved back. It was the first contact they had since Zephyr had broken up. Two weeks later, Jones and Cable started speaking again. They agreed to give the band another go, but Cable only wanted to play their own songs. Jones agreed. The duo invited Mark Everett to play for them on bass guitar and Jones then started writing his own songs.

Everett went on holiday for two weeks but Jones and Cable wanted to continue rehearsing, so Jones invited long-time friend Richard Jones to fill in for Everett. Stunned by Richard&#x27;s appearance and bass playing, Cable convinced Kelly to keep him instead of Everett. The band decided they needed another member to play lead guitar. Simon Collier was the first guitarist brought in. He did not stay in the band, but instead became Kelly&#x27;s guitar technician. The band tried hiring two other guitarists, another Richard Jones and Glenn Hyde. Neither stayed for long. Hyde did, however, play harmonica on &quot;Rooftop&quot; for the band&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Just Enough Education to Perform&quot;. After Hyde left, the band stuck as a three-piece act.

=== Name change and V2 Records (1992–1996) ===
Kelly, Richard and Cable began writing and performing music in working men&#x27;s clubs together in 1992 as a band known as &quot;Tragic Love Company&quot;, a name inspired by their favourite bands (the Tragically Hip, Mother Love Bone and Bad Company). After Tragic Love Company supported Smalltown Heroes in the Borderline Club, London, they met Marshall Bird and Steve Bush who were interested in producing for the band. The band agreed and recorded a demo for &quot;A Thousand Trees&quot;.

Wayne Coleman organised a series of concerts throughout South Wales after receiving a demo from the band. Wayne liked it a lot but hated the band name and told them they wouldn&#x27;t be performing unless they changed it. After Cable read the manufacturer name of a gramophone, &quot;Falcon Stereophonic&quot;, he told Kelly and the band agreed to change their name to &quot;the Stereophonics&quot;. In March 1996, the band played a gig at their local Coliseum Theatre, Aberdare with Catatonia along with local bands Krazy Keyboards (later to become Dylan Thorn), and the Pocket Devils. When the band finished their slot, John Brand approached them and he became their manager. Brand managed to get over 35 record companies in the UK interested in signing the Stereophonics. In May 1996, they signed with V2, the first artists to be signed to newly formed record label. Upon signing, they dropped &quot;the&quot; from their name and simply became &quot;Stereophonics&quot;.

=== Debut album and ascent to fame (1997–2000) ===
In August 1997, the band released their first studio album, &quot;Word Gets Around&quot;, which reached number six in the UK Albums chart, from which five singles were released. The debut single, released 25 November 1996, was &quot;Looks Like Chaplin&quot;. Afterwards, the band embarked on a successful world tour.
In February 1998, the band received a BRIT Award for Best New Group. In the same week, the band re-released the single &quot;Local Boy in the Photograph&quot;, which in turn reached number fourteen in the UK Singles chart. The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Word Gets Around&quot;, also went gold in the UK.

In November 1998, &quot;The Bartender and the Thief&quot; (the first single from the album &quot;Performance and Cocktails&quot;) was released, eventually reaching number three on the UK charts. &quot;Just Looking&quot; was released next and reached number four in March 1999. In that same month, the album was released, entering at number one and going platinum within three weeks. Later that year, the band played in front of 50,000 people at Morfa Stadium in Swansea. The concert was filmed and released on DVD the following year. They also collaborated with Tom Jones on a cover of the Randy Newman song &quot;Mama Told Me Not to Come&quot;, for the Tom Jones album &quot;Reload&quot;.

Throughout 1998 and 1999, the band toured in Europe, Australia and the US. On 12 June 1998, Stereophonics played to over 10,000 spectators in the grounds of Cardiff Castle in Wales. Footage of the concert was released on VHS and DVD, titled &quot;Live at Cardiff Castle&quot;.

=== Mainstream success (2001–2004) ===
The band released their third album, &quot;Just Enough Education to Perform&quot;, in April 2001. The album included the track &quot;Mr. Writer&quot;, which includes lyrics that criticise a critic who the band believe gave them a negative review. The album also contained &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot;, which reached number five in the UK charts. To promote the new album, &quot;Just Enough Education to Perform&quot;, the Stereophonics played a two-day festival, which was called &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;. This event was held in Donington Park on the first day and at Cardiff&#x27;s Millennium Stadium on the second. The concerts were supported by Ash, Black Crowes and the Crocketts, with Proud Mary playing Donington only. Over 200,000 separate tickets were sold for the weekend festival. The performance was released on a DVD in 2002.

2003 saw the release of their fourth album, titled &quot;You Gotta Go There to Come Back&quot;. In September 2003, drummer Stuart Cable was sacked. According to reports, it was because of his lack of commitment to the band. Cable, at the time, presented a TV show called &quot;Cable TV&quot; and felt that the band would never improve. Because of this, he missed several rehearsals and live concerts. He was eventually replaced by Javier Weyler. Steve Gorman, from the Black Crowes, stood in for Cable during the band&#x27;s live performances until Weyler was appointed. When asked about Cable leaving the band in a 2010 interview with &quot;Rip It Up&quot; magazine, Kelly Jones acknowledged the difficulty of the situation.

Towards the end of the year, Stereophonics performed a sold-out tour of the UK, ending with a Christmas show at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, supported by Feeder, Ocean Colour Scene and Adam Masterson. The show was closed with a version of &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot;, originally recorded by Slade. The group took a break after their 2003–2004 world tour, which included a set at the Manchester Move Festival in July 2004.

=== Drummer changes and Stuart Cable&#x27;s death (2005–2010) ===

Their fifth studio album, &quot;Language. Sex. Violence. Other?&quot; was released in March 2005. It marked their first recording with new drummer Javier Weyler. The band achieved their first number one hit in the UK singles charts with the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Dakota&quot;. The second single from the album was &quot;Superman&quot;. However, that song did not repeat the success of &quot;Dakota&quot;, peaking at number thirteen. After &quot;Superman&quot; came &quot;Devil&quot;, featuring a controversial video and reaching number eleven in the charts. The album was nominated for a Pop Factory award at the end of the year, losing out to Feeder&#x27;s &quot;Pushing the Senses&quot;.

On 2 July 2005, the group appeared at the Live 8 concert in Hyde Park, London, playing to their biggest audience yet. The band were also scheduled to support Oasis for a number of dates across Europe, in early 2006, but pulled out due to family commitments. 2006 also saw the release of Stereophonics&#x27; first live album, &quot;Live from Dakota&quot;. The album is a two-disc compilation, featuring twenty tracks spanning all five of the band&#x27;s albums and capturing the best of their 2005 world tour. Rather than being a recording of a single show, the tour was recorded every night and the band picked out the best version of each song individually. The album also features a track titled &quot;Jayne&quot;, later released as part of Kelly Jones&#x27; solo album, &quot;Only the Names Have Been Changed&quot;.

&quot;Pull the Pin&quot; was released in the UK on 15 October 2007, along with a download-only taster; &quot;Bank Holiday Monday&quot;. The track was also available for free to people who pre-ordered tickets for the band&#x27;s concerts in 2007. The album was written and recorded by November 2006 but held back for release until late 2007. &quot;It Means Nothing&quot; was the first single of the album, released in September before the LP was released a week later on 15 October. The album contains twelve songs and reached number one in the UK&#x27;s official album chart. The next single, &quot;My Friends&quot;, reached number thirty-two in the UK charts, their poorest chart performance since &quot;More Life in a Tramps Vest&quot; from their debut album.

On 20 May 2007, at Radio 1&#x27;s Big Weekend in Preston, the band were joined on stage by Casino frontman Adam Zindani. Zindani continued to tour with the band for the remainder of the &quot;Pull the Pin&quot; tour, playing lead guitar and backing vocals. He has been credited for writing and performing on two of the band&#x27;s new tracks, &quot;You&#x27;re My Star&quot; and &quot;My Own Worst Enemy&quot;. On &quot;You&#x27;re My Star&quot;, he sings backing vocals and plays lead guitar, whereas on &quot;My Own Worst Enemy&quot; he only plays lead guitar. In November 2008, Stereophonics released their first greatest hits compilation, &quot;Decade in the Sun&quot;.

On 8 December 2009, the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games announced the line up for performers for the nightly Victory Ceremonies. These ceremonies included 30 minutes of entertainment from the evening&#x27;s host province/territory, 30 minutes of medal presentations, and a one-hour performance by a musical talent. Stereophonics performed their song &quot;I Got Your Number&quot; at this event on 20 February – Yukon Night. The band&#x27;s seventh album, titled &quot;Keep Calm and Carry On&quot;, was released on 16 November 2009. They decided on this name after seeing a poster in the White Horse pub in Richmond where they spent a lot of time whilst recording the album. The album&#x27;s debut single was &quot;Innocent&quot;. The second single from the album, &quot;Could You Be the One?&quot;, was released on 15 February 2010. The band embarked on a seven-date tour to support the new album in March 2010 playing at Aberdeen, Newcastle, Glasgow, Nottingham, Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield and London. with support from Glasgow band Hip Parade.

On 5 June 2010, Stereophonics played the first-ever gig at the Cardiff City Stadium with support from unsigned South Wales band 4th Street Traffic, followed by Kids in Glass Houses and Doves. The concert, known as &quot;Summer in the City&quot;, was played to a sold-out audience of 30,000. Two days later, original drummer Stuart Cable was found dead in his home in Aberdare having choked on his own vomit after binge drinking. After the Keep Calm and Carry On Tour concluded, and their contract with Universal at an end, Kelly Jones wanted to change the way the band worked and so decided to take a break from writing and recording an album every two years.

=== More Drummer changes, &quot;Graffiti on the Train&quot;, &quot;Keep the Village Alive&quot; and &quot;Scream Above the Sounds&quot; (2011–2018) ===
On 3 March 2011, Stereophonics announced that they were working on new music in the studio. In July 2012 it was announced that Weyler and the band had parted company. It was announced on 24 September 2012 that Jamie Morrison, former drummer for Noisettes, had replaced Weyler in the band. On 8 October 2012, Stereophonics released the video to a track titled &quot;Violins and Tambourines&quot; from the upcoming album. On 4 November, the first single from the new album, &quot;In a Moment&quot;, was released as a free download from the band&#x27;s website. On the same day, NME.com reported that the album would be titled &quot;Graffiti on the Train&quot;. The album was released on 4 March 2013. Second single preceding the album, &quot;Indian Summer&quot; was released in January 2013; by 10 March it had peaked at number 30 in the UK, making it their group&#x27;s first UK top-40 single since 2007. A third single, the album&#x27;s title track, was released on 13 May.

In late September 2014, it was announced that a new album has been mixed and that it should be released in 2015. On 21 March 2015, Stereophonics performed in Bristol and in London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall and debuted 3 new songs &quot;C&#x27;est La Vie&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Get Lost With You&quot; and &quot;Song for the Summer&quot; which are to be on their 9th album &quot;Keep the Village Alive&quot; with the release date of 11 September. &quot;C&#x27;est la Vie&quot; was released as the first single of the album. In September 2015 the band appeared on BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;. During the Keep the Summer Alive Tour, Kelly Jones announced he would like to release the band&#x27;s tenth studio album &quot;before next summer&quot; to commemorate the 20th anniversary of &quot;Word Gets Around&quot;, rather than release a compilation album.

On 27 July 2017 the band announced &quot;Scream Above the Sounds&quot; as the title for the album and will be released on 27 October 2017. It became available to pre-order on the same day. The album was released under the new distribution label &quot;Parlophone&quot;, as the band parted ways with the old label V2. The band released &quot;All In One Night&quot; on the same day as the lead single from it. On 4 September 2017 &quot;Caught By The Wind&quot; was released as the second single from the album followed by &quot;Before Anyone Knew Our Name&quot; as the third single on 20 October 2017.They released the album&#x27;s fourth and final single, &quot;What&#x27;s All the Fuss About?&quot; on 4 December 2017. They embarked on the Scream Above The Sounds tour in 2018.

=== &quot;Kind.&quot; and &quot;Oochya!&quot; (2019–2022) ===
In January 2019, Stereophonics announced two shows as part of Forest Live, the summer concert series promoted by the Forestry Commission: 13 June at Westonbirt Arboretum, near Tetbury, Gloucestershire and 23 June at Thetford Forest, near Brandon, Suffolk. &quot;Kind.&quot; became their seventh number-one album later that year.

Originally intending to release another greatest hits album, the band announced their twelfth album, &quot;Oochya!&quot; on 6 September 2021. It became their eighth number-one album. 

On 18 June 2022, the second of the band&#x27;s two concerts at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff, was broadcast live on BBC One Wales and BBC Two, with special guest Sir Tom Jones.

== Other projects ==
On 9 October 2007, a retrospective DVD was released in the United States, &quot;Rewind: The First 10 Years&quot;. The DVD is a double disc with a runtime of nearly four hours. Much of this footage was recorded around the time that the &quot;You Gotta Go There to Come Back&quot; album was being recorded. This is because a similar band history DVD was listed for release shortly after that album but was never released, due to the departure of Stuart Cable. This explains Jones&#x27; hairstyle (circa 2003/2004) in the interview footage and the appearance of Stuart and the rest of the band freely talking about their togetherness and solidarity as the original three members. The original footage was updated by adding further footage to the end, bringing it up to date with the band&#x27;s fifth album. Stuart does not appear on any of the extra footage. Availability coincides with the US re-release of the &quot;Language.Sex.Violence.Other?&quot; DVD, and the worldwide digital debut of their latest studio album, &quot;Pull the Pin&quot;.

In 2007, Jones released a solo album, titled &quot;Only the Names Have Been Changed&quot;, while recording the band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Pull the Pin&quot;. The album contains ten tracks (all named after women) and features minimal instrumentation. The album also includes the song &quot;Jayne&quot;, a previously unreleased Stereophonics track featured on the live album &quot;Live from Dakota&quot; and the &quot;Rewind&quot; DVD.

Stereophonics also performed the original opening theme tune for the TV series &quot;Long Way Round&quot;. The song&#x27;s lyrics were slightly altered for the follow-up series, &quot;Long Way Down and Long Way Up&quot;.

<text>Jack Hodgins (born October 3, 1938 in Comox Valley, British Columbia) is a Canadian novelist and short story writer. 
Critically acclaimed, among his best received works is &quot;Broken Ground&quot; (1998), a historical novel set after the First World War, for which he received the Ethel Wilson Fiction Prize and many other accolades.

==Biography==
Jack Hodgins grew up in Merville, a small town in the Comox Valley of British Columbia. He left home for Vancouver, where he attended the University of British Columbia, and was encouraged by Earle Birney, graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Education. Hodgins spent the next 18 years of his career teaching English in Nanaimo, back on Vancouver Island.

In 1968, his first piece of literary work was accepted by a publication, and the exposure allowed him the chance to expand his work in print. With the publication of his first book of short stories, &quot;Spit Delaney&#x27;s Island&quot; (1976), and his first novel &quot;The Invention of the World&quot; (1977), Hodgins was well on his way to becoming a recognized name in Canadian literature, before taking a position at the University of Victoria in the Creative Writing Department.

He began receiving short-term teaching positions at universities throughout Canada, including Simon Fraser University and the University of Ottawa. (http://www.nwpassages.com/bios/hodgins.asp). He lectured in countries such as Japan, Finland, Norway, Germany, Spain, and Australia. In 1983, he accepted a position as a professor of Creative Writing at the University of Victoria. He and his family settled themselves in Victoria and stayed through until the time of his retirement from teaching, in 2002.

Hodgins continues his life in Victoria today and occasionally gives lectures on writing and speaks at a workshop in Mallorca, Spain annually. Hodgins has received much recognition for his work including the Eaton&#x27;s BC Book Award for &quot;Spit Delaney&#x27;s Island,&quot; the Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s Award for Literary Excellence in 2006, and the Terasen Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2001, a play based on several short stories from his book &quot;The Barclay Family Theatre&quot; was made into an opera by composer Christopher Donnison and premiered on stage in Victoria, BC. His life has been commemorated in a National Film Board Film entitled &quot;Jack Hodgins&#x27; Island&quot;.

==Literature and the Environment==
*Hodgins&#x27; close relationship with the environment stems from his personal experiences within the temperate rainforests and seasides of British Columbia. Places like Comox Valley, Nanaimo, and Victoria, as well as his travels abroad, have influenced his writing and the contents of his books. His characters in &quot;Innocent Cities&quot; are based on actual residents of the city of Victoria in the late 1900s, as well as people he met on his travels to Australia. &quot;The Invention of the World&quot; is based on the legendary cult leader Brother Twelve and his followers from outside Nanaimo, BC. &quot;The Macken Charm&quot;, set in 1956, illustrates the Comox Valley with characters inspired by influential people in his life. He based the many settings in &quot;Spit Delaney&#x27;s Island&quot; around places he has lived or previously travelled. 
 In an email interview with students from the University of Victoria, Hodgins elaborates on place affecting his writing, and uses &quot;Macken Charm&quot; as his example.

&quot;In The Macken Charm the family gathers (after a family funeral) at the site of a burnt hotel owned by the family. This place exists still. My own memories go back to playing as a child in that hotel when it was no longer in use. I knew that my parents began their married life in that hotel—the old uncle who owned it asked them to move in and look after it and them. My mother learned to cook 
on a stove big enough for a hotel dining room full of guests! All of this is in the novel, pretty well just as it happens, though the characters are fictitious replacements for the originals. The beach, the trees, the roads, the cars of 1956, the store, the funeral parlour, the bridge over the river in Courtenay, the glacier—they&#x27;re all there. The story is fiction but the place is real.&quot;

<doc id="165154" wikidata="Q71550" url="?curid=165154" title="Application server">
<text>An application server is a server that hosts applications or software that delivers a business application through a communication protocol. For a typical web application, the application server sits behind the web servers.

An application server framework is a service layer model. It includes software components available to a software developer through an application programming interface. An application server may have features such as clustering, fail-over, and load-balancing. The goal is for developers to focus on the business logic.

==Java application servers==
Jakarta EE (formerly Java EE or J2EE) defines the core set of API and features of Java application servers.

The Jakarta EE infrastructure is partitioned into logical containers.
*EJB container: Enterprise Beans are used to manage transactions. According to the Java BluePrints, the business logic of an application resides in Enterprise Beans—a modular server component providing many features, including declarative transaction management, and improving application scalability.
* Web container: the web modules include Jakarta Servlets and Jakarta Server Pages (JSP).
* JCA container (Jakarta Connectors)
* JMS provider (Jakarta Messaging)

==Microsoft==
Microsoft&#x27;s .NET positions their middle-tier applications and services infrastructure in the Windows Server operating system and the .NET Framework technologies in the role of an application server. The Windows Application Server role includes Internet Information Services (IIS) to provide web server support, the .NET Framework to provide application support, ASP.NET to provide server side scripting, COM+ for application component communication, Message Queuing for multithreaded processing, and the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) for application communication.

==PHP application servers==
PHP application servers run and manage PHP applications.

* Zend Server, built by Zend, provides application server functionality for the PHP-based applications.
* RoadRunner, built by Spiral Scout is a high-performance PHP application server, load-balancer, and process manager written in Go.

==Third-party==
*Mono (a cross platform open-source implementation of .NET supporting nearly all its features, with the exception of Windows OS-specific features), sponsored by Microsoft and released under the MIT License

==Mobile application servers==
Mobile application servers provide data delivery to mobile devices.

===Mobile features===
Core capabilities of mobile application services include
* Data routing– data is packaged in smaller (REST) objects with some business logic to minimize demands on bandwidth and battery
* Orchestration– transactions and data integration across multiple sources
* Authentication service– secure connectivity to back-end systems is managed by the mobile middleware
* Off-line support– allows users to access and use data even though the device is not connected
* Security– data encryption, device control, SSL, call logging

===Mobile challenges===
Although most standards-based infrastructure (including SOAs) are designed to connect to any independent of any vendor, product or technology, most enterprises have trouble connecting back-end systems to mobile applications, because mobile devices add the following technological challenges:
* Limited resources – mobile devices have limited power and bandwidth
* Intermittent connectivity – cellular service and wifi coverage is often not continuous
* Difficult to secure – mobility and BYOD practices make it hard to secure mobile devices

==Deployment models==
An application server can be deployed:
* On premises
* Cloud
* Private cloud
* Platform as a service (PaaS)

*Application service provider

<doc id="165155" wikidata="Q1139272" url="?curid=165155" title="Crazy Taxi (video game)">
<text>is a racing video game developed and published by Sega. It is the first game in the &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; series. The game was first released in arcades in 1999 and then was ported to the Dreamcast in 2000. Gameplay is based on picking up taxi customers and driving to their destination as quickly as possible. Reception to &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; has been mostly positive. It was ported to other platforms numerous times, including the PlayStation 2 and GameCube by Acclaim in 2001, and then Windows in 2002, becoming Sega&#x27;s first multi-platform game after the company transitioned to third-party.

The game has also been rereleased for the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, iOS and Android, and is also featured on the &quot;Dreamcast Collection&quot;. It became one of the few Sega All Stars on the Dreamcast and also earned Greatest Hits and Player&#x27;s Choice status on PlayStation 2 and GameCube respectively. Sega followed up on the success of &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; with numerous sequels, the first being &quot;Crazy Taxi 2&quot; for the Dreamcast, which included several gameplay changes.

==Gameplay==

The main objective of the game is to pick up customers and take them to their chosen destination as quickly as possible. Along the way, money can be earned by performing stunts, such as near misses with other vehicles. The player is directed to a destination by a large green arrow at the top of the screen. The arrow does not adjust based on obstacles but rather points in the general direction of the destination. Once the player arrives near the destination, they must stop within a specified zone. When the destination is reached, the customer&#x27;s fare is added to the player&#x27;s total money earned. Ratings are then awarded depending on how long the player took to complete the journey. If the customer&#x27;s timer runs out before the player reaches the destination, the customer will jump from the taxi without paying the driver.

Players can select three-, five-, or ten-minute settings, or the Arcade Rules used in the original coin-op version of the game. In the three time-limited settings, play continues for the designated period of time, after which the cab automatically stops and no more points can be scored. Under Arcade Rules, the player starts with an initial time limit of one minute, which can be extended through time bonuses earned for quick deliveries. Console versions of the game also feature a mode known as Crazy Box, a set of minigames that feature challenges, such as picking up and dropping off a number of customers within a time limit, bowling using the taxi as a ball, and popping giant balloons in a field.

The arcade version of the game includes one stage, and an additional &quot;Original&quot; stage was added for the console versions. Both stages are based in sunny coastal Californian locales, with steep hills and other strong similarities to San Francisco. The player has a choice of four drivers (Axel, B.D. Joe, Gena, and Gus) and their cabs, each of which has slightly different attributes.

==Development and marketing==
The arcade edition of the game was developed by Hitmaker as a variation from then-current arcade titles. The &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; cabinet ran on Sega Naomi hardware. It was originally released in arcades as a sit-down machine. An upright version was later released. Over the next few years, the game would be ported to the Dreamcast, GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Windows; the latter port was published by Empire Interactive and developed by their internal studio Strangelite. &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; was later ported to PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade. These ports originally were to force a 4:3 aspect ratio, with widescreen monitors showing blue bars on either side of the screen, resulting in featuring full widescreen support for these ports. The game is a port of the Dreamcast version, including both the original arcade and the Dreamcast-exclusive level. The PlayStation Network port was released on November 16, 2010, while the Xbox Live Arcade version was released the following week. The game was also announced for the Zeebo console, though no port was ever released.

&quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; was brought to the App Store on iOS devices in October 2012. The game includes the arcade map and the map that was introduced for consoles. It also includes all Crazy Box challenges. As in the console versions, if all challenges are completed, a pedicab is unlocked to play the main game with. The taxi can be controlled though either the touch screen or by tilting the device making use of its accelerometer. Critics were impressed with this port because the maps remained unchanged and the controls were intuitive.

Sega applied for and was awarded U.S. Patent 6,200,138 – &quot;Game display method, moving direction indicating method, game apparatus and drive simulating apparatus&quot; – in 2001. The mechanics in the &quot;138 patent&quot; describe an arcade cabinet similar to Sega&#x27;s previous arcade game &quot;Harley-Davidson &amp; L.A. Riders&quot; (1997) but also describe the arrow navigation system and pedestrian avoidance aspects that were used in &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot;.

&quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; producer Kenji Kanno noted that the time extension on gameplay was a breakaway of the current &quot;100 yen for three minutes&quot; that persisted at the time for arcade games, and it rewarded players with longer playing times by performing well in the game. In addition to providing a game that could be played in short sessions, Kanno wanted a game to explore the &quot;daily life and routine&quot; of a taxi driver. In the development of the Dreamcast version of the original arcade game, the developers included a larger map in addition to the arcade one, as to create a feeling of &quot;being lost&quot; and allowing home console players to have fun &quot;learning the town&quot;. Mini-games were developed for this version as to &quot;let the player play longer if he improved skill&quot; by offering challenges that were both fun and educational. Over one hundred different ideas for mini-games were developed by the team, but then pared down for the Crazy Box mini-game challenges for the game.

&quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; is also notable for its soundtrack featuring the bands Bad Religion and The Offspring, who provided all of the tracks for the arcade, Dreamcast, PlayStation 2 and GameCube ports. The PC featured an entirely new soundtrack, omitting the original bands in favor of music from Pivit, Too Rude and Total Chaos. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; also exclude the original bands, providing an original soundtrack for the ports. Custom soundtracks can also be used on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 via their system firmware. The iOS and Android versions feature the original soundtrack.

In addition to generic destinations, such as the city&#x27;s police station, rail terminal and lookout point, passengers may also request to be taken to Pizza Hut, Tower Records, the FILA sportswear store, the Levi&#x27;s store or KFC. &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; also featured vans on the roads with the WOW! logo on the side. Each of these chains are modeled as a location in the game. This is considered one of the most prominent examples of product placement in video gaming history. These establishments have been replaced with generic businesses in later versions, due to licensing difficulties.

==Reception==

In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; on their April 1, 1999 issue as being the second most-successful arcade game of the month. It went on to be the biggest hit from Sega&#x27;s Hitmaker studio.

Sales for the game were generally high, with the Dreamcast version being the second highest selling Dreamcast game in the United States in 2000, selling nearly 750,000 units. American sales later reached units across the Dreamcast and , including for the Dreamcast and for the PS2. In the UK, the Dreamcast version was reported to have sold out. The PlayStation 2 version received a &quot;Platinum&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom. In Japan, the Dreamcast, PS2 and GameCube versions sold 155,714 units. Xbox Live Arcade sales for 2011 were high, with the game selling nearly 100,000 units.

The Dreamcast version of &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; was critically acclaimed, averaging 90% at video game aggregate site GameRankings based on 37 reviews. Subsequent ports of the game have also received generally positive reviews, but had a trend of declining average scores. The PlayStation 2 port averaged 79% at GameRankings and 80/100 at Metacritic respectively. The next port for the GameCube scored lower, with aggregate scores of 70% and 69/100. The PC port was the poorest rated of the ports, scoring an average of 56% at GameRankings.

Critics generally praised the overall gameplay. Brandon Justice of &quot;IGN&quot; said: &quot;I can&#x27;t stress enough how addictive this game is&quot;. Of the Dreamcast port, &quot;Game Revolution&quot; felt that &quot;a great arcade game became a good home game&quot;. They further noted the game&#x27;s high difficulty and added that while the game was difficult, it was not frustrating. Michael Goncalves of &quot;PALGN&quot; added that the game was either a &quot;love or hate&quot; title, adding &quot;if you love it, you will cherish the game and play it to your hearts content&quot;. Goncalves also pointed out that the game featured occasional pop up and clipping. Reviews were split across the releases in regards to the game&#x27;s soundtrack. &quot;PALGN&quot; cited Bad Religion and The Offspring as a high point of the game, while &quot;Game Revolution&quot; felt that the tracks were repetitive. &quot;GameSpot&quot; reviewer Jeff Gerstmann felt that the soundtrack was subjective to personal preference, stating &quot;you&#x27;ll either want to crank the volume up or turn the music all the way down&quot;. In a review for the PC version&#x27;s altered soundtrack, fellow &quot;GameSpot&quot; reviewer Andrew Park felt that the new music was fitting for the game. However, they criticized the PC version for frame rate issues and recommended the Dreamcast version instead.

James Bottorff of &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; gave the Dreamcast version three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that &quot;the only bug on &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot;″s window is the lack of longevity. The game can grow tiresome after multiple plays. However, the amount of fun packed into its short life span makes it a worthwhile addition to your library of games&quot;. &quot;Maxim&quot; gave the same version a score of six out of ten: &quot;We don’t like how the pesky pedestrians always manage to dodge your cab, but the graphics of the San Francisco-like city are amazingly detailed&quot;. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave the Dreamcast version a score of 34 out of 40, and the PS2 version 30 out of 40. &quot;GameFan&quot; gave the Dreamcast version a score of 96%, while &quot;Edge&quot; gave both the Dreamcast and PS2 versions a score of seven out of 10.

Hilary Goldstein in &quot;IGN&quot; called the Xbox Live Arcade release &quot;a mad dash of fun&quot;, adding &quot;there&#x27;s almost no depth to &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot;, but that&#x27;s just fine&quot;. Goldstein praised the fact that the port stayed true to the original source, but felt that the lack of the original soundtrack &quot;kills half the reason to pick &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; up again&quot;. Criticism also pointed to the lack of visual updates such as higher resolution models and textures. &quot;GamePro&quot;″s Dave Rudden also lauded the fact that the port played faithfully to the original. Rudden echoed Goldstein&#x27;s comments in regards to poor visuals, saying it had &quot;ugly character models and boxy traffic cars&quot;.

Robert Workman from &quot;GameZone&quot; praised the game for sticking to its Sega roots: &quot;&quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; isn&#x27;t just a nostalgic trip, but also a wondrous stress reliever and an all-around entertaining game&quot;. Russ Pitts of &quot;The Escapist&quot; gave it four stars out of five: &quot;In spite of dated graphics and other technical whizbangery, &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; will remind you why you love driving games – and who started that fire. It&#x27;s a game that&#x27;s fun to play in short bursts that will become longer and longer the more of them you devote to it&quot;. In contrast, Daniel Feit of &quot;Wired&quot; gave it a score of six stars out of ten: &quot;Gameplay is pure repetition; fun in short bursts but little lasting attraction&quot;.

Jeff Lundrigan and Daniel Erickson reviewed the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 versions for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, respectively, and each gave their games four stars out of five: &quot;A strangely addictive experience overall, &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; is perfect for the gaming obsessive, but also makes a great party game&quot;. Erickson described it as &quot;a near-perfect port of a fantastic game&quot;.

The Dreamcast version was a runner-up &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Driving Game&quot; award among console games, losing to &quot;Test Drive Le Mans&quot;.

During the 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; won &quot;Console Action Game of the Year&quot;; it also received nominations for &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Game Play Engineering&quot;.

===Legacy===
&quot;Crazy Taxi&quot;″s success prompted Sega to produce multiple sequels. In 2001, &quot;Crazy Taxi 2&quot; was released, followed by &quot;Crazy Taxi 3: High Roller&quot; in 2002. THQ would publish the Graphic State developed &quot;Crazy Taxi: Catch a Ride&quot; in 2003, the only title for the Game Boy Advance. &quot;Crazy Taxi: Fare Wars&quot;, a compilation of &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; and &quot;Crazy Taxi 2,&quot; was released in 2007 for the PlayStation Portable. A mobile-exclusive entry to the series, titled &quot;Crazy Taxi: City Rush&quot;, was released on the iOS and Google Play app stores in 2014.

&quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; and its sequels have also prompted several games which clone its core gameplay. &quot;The Simpsons: Road Rage&quot; was the first of these titles, released in 2001. In 2003, Sega filed a lawsuit against Fox Interactive, Electronic Arts, and Radical Entertainment. Sega claimed that the game was a patent infringement of &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot;. The case, &quot;Sega of America, Inc. v. Fox Interactive, et al.&quot;, was settled in private for an undisclosed amount. The poorly received &quot;Emergency Mayhem&quot; for the Wii utilizes the same core gameplay of the &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; series but adds additional elements in regards to driving emergency response vehicles.

Team6 Game Studios would later release a similar game called &quot;Taxi Chaos&quot;, which could be considered as a spiritual successor to &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot;. The game was released on February 23, 2021, for the PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One. The game takes place in a fictionalized version of New York City and has the same format as the original &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; games.

====2024 United States presidential campaign====

One of the game&#x27;s fans was Tim Walz, then a high school teacher and later the governor of Minnesota and the Democratic nominee for United States vice president in 2024. During the campaign, a former student of Walz said the governor recounted that his wife made him get rid of his Dreamcast because he was playing it too much. A Plymouth, Minnesota man later said a Walz intern sold him the console for $25, with &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; inside. 

That October, Walz and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez played &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; and &quot;Madden NFL 25&quot; on Ocasio-Cortez&#x27;s Twitch channel. Walz confirmed many details of the story, saying he considered the game an alternative to the violence of &quot;Grand Theft Auto 3&quot;.

===Film adaptation===
In 2001, Richard Donner was attached to a live-action version of &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; but eventually left the project. Talk of a screen adaptation of &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; was renewed in 2014, as Sega optioned the film and TV rights to its library.
