<text>Eric Hilliard &quot;Ricky&quot; Nelson (May 8, 1940 – December 31, 1985) was an American musician and actor. From age eight, he starred alongside his family in the radio and television series &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;. In 1957, he began a long and successful career as a popular recording artist.

His fame as both a recording artist and television star also led to a motion picture role co-starring alongside John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan, and Angie Dickinson in Howard Hawks&#x27;s western feature film &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; (1959). He placed 54 songs on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and its predecessors between 1957 and 1973, including &quot;Poor Little Fool&quot; in 1958, which was the first number one song on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s then-newly created Hot 100 chart. He recorded 17 additional top ten hits and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on January 21, 1987. In 1996, Nelson was ranked No. 49 on TV Guide&#x27;s 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time.

Nelson began his entertainment career in 1949, playing himself in the radio sitcom series &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;. In 1952, he appeared in his first feature film, &quot;Here Come the Nelsons&quot;. In 1957, he recorded his first single (&quot;I&#x27;m Walkin&#x27; b/w &quot;A Teenager&#x27;s Romance&quot;, Verve 10047X4S), debuted as a singer on the television version of the sitcom, and released the No. 1 album &quot;Ricky&quot;. In 1958, Nelson released his first No. 1 single, &quot;Poor Little Fool&quot;, and in 1959 received a Golden Globe nomination for &quot;Most Promising Male Newcomer&quot; after starring in &quot;Rio Bravo&quot;. A few films followed, and when the television series was cancelled in 1966, Nelson made occasional appearances as a guest star on various television programs. In his twenties, he moved away from the pop music of his youth and began to perform in a country rock style. After recording several albums with mostly session musicians, most of which flopped, he formed the Stone Canyon Band in 1969 and experienced a career resurgence, buoyed by the live album &quot;In Concert at the Troubadour, 1969&quot; and had a surprise hit with 1972&#x27;s &quot;Garden Party&quot;, which peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100. His comeback was short-lived, however, as his record label was bought out and folded, and his followup albums were not well promoted by his new label. He continued to perform live and take small television roles through the 1970s, though his label dropped him by the end of the decade. He released two more albums, with unimpressive results, before his death in a plane crash on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1985.

Nelson was married once, to Sharon Kristin Harmon, from 1963 until their divorce in 1982. They had four children: actress Tracy Nelson, twin sons and musicians Gunnar and Matthew, and actor Sam.

==Early life==
Nelson was born on May 8, 1940, in Teaneck, New Jersey. He was the second son of entertainment couple Ozzie and Harriet Nelson. His father was of half-Swedish descent. The Nelsons&#x27; older son was actor David Nelson.

Harriet, normally the vocalist for Ozzie&#x27;s band, remained in Englewood, New Jersey, with her newborn and toddler. Meanwhile, bandleader Ozzie toured with the Nelson orchestra. The Nelsons bought a two-story colonial house in Tenafly, New Jersey, and six months after the purchase, moved with son David to Hollywood, where Ozzie and Harriet were slated to appear in the 1941–42 season of Red Skelton&#x27;s &quot;The Raleigh Cigarette Hour;&quot; Ricky remained in Tenafly in the care of his paternal grandmother. In November 1941, the Nelsons bought what would become their permanent home: a green and white, two-story, Cape Cod colonial home at 1822 Camino Palmero in Los Angeles. Ricky joined his parents and brother there in 1942.

Ricky was a small and insecure child who suffered from severe asthma. At night, his sleep was eased with a vaporizer emitting tincture of evergreen. He was described by Red Skelton&#x27;s producer John Guedel as &quot;an odd little kid&quot;, likable, shy, introspective, mysterious, and inscrutable. When Skelton was drafted in 1944, Guedel crafted the radio sitcom &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot; for Ricky&#x27;s parents. The show debuted on Sunday, October 8, 1944, to favorable reviews. Ozzie eventually became head writer for the show and based episodes on the fraternal exploits and enmity of his sons. The Nelson boys were first played in the radio series by professional child actors until twelve-year-old Dave and eight-year-old Ricky joined the show on February 20, 1949, in the episode &quot;Invitation to Dinner&quot;.
In 1952, the Nelsons tested the waters for a television series with the theatrically released film &quot;Here Come the Nelsons.&quot; The film was a hit, and Ozzie was convinced the family could make the transition from radio&#x27;s airwaves to television&#x27;s small screen. On October 3, 1952, &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot; made its television debut and was broadcast in first run until September 3, 1966, to become one of the longest running sitcoms in television history.

==Education==
Nelson attended Gardner Street Public School, Bancroft Junior High, and, between 1954 and 1958, Hollywood High School, from which he graduated with a B average. He played football at Hollywood High and represented the school in interscholastic tennis matches. Twenty-five years later, Nelson told the &quot;Los Angeles Weekly&quot; he hated school because it &quot;smelled of pencils&quot; and he was forced to rise early in the morning to attend. In January 1960, the athletic Nelson brothers formed a trapeze act with stunts in the 1/27/1960 episode of &quot;Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot; titled &#x27;THE CIRCUS&#x27;.

Ozzie Nelson was a Rutgers alumnus and keen on college education, but eighteen-year-old Ricky was already in the 93 percent income-tax bracket and saw no reason to attend. At age thirteen, Ricky was making over $100,000 per annum, and at sixteen he had a personal fortune of $500,000 ().

Nelson&#x27;s wealth was astutely managed by his parents, who channeled his earnings into trust funds. Although his parents permitted him a $50 allowance at the age of eighteen, Ricky was often strapped for cash and one evening collected and redeemed empty pop bottles to gain entrance to a movie theater for himself and a date.

==Music career==

===Debut===
Nelson played clarinet and drums in his tweens and early teens, learned the rudimentary guitar chords, and vocally imitated his favorite Sun Records rockabilly artists in the bathroom at home or in the showers at the Los Angeles Tennis Club. He was strongly influenced by the music of Carl Perkins, and once said he tried to emulate the sound and the tone of the guitar break in Perkins&#x27;s March 1956 Top Ten hit &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;.

At age sixteen, he wanted to impress his girlfriend of two years, Diana Osborn(e), who was an Elvis fan and, although he had no record contract at the time, told her that he, too, was going to make a record. With his father&#x27;s help, he secured a one-record deal with Verve Records, an important jazz label looking for a young and popular personality who could sing or be taught to sing. On March 26, 1957, he recorded the Fats Domino standard &quot;I&#x27;m Walkin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;A Teenager&#x27;s Romance&quot; (released in late April 1957 as his first single), and &quot;You&#x27;re My One and Only Love&quot;.

Before the single was released, he made his television rock-and-roll debut on April 10, 1957, singing and playing the drums to &quot;I&#x27;m Walkin&#x27;&quot; in the &quot;Ozzie and Harriet&quot; episode &quot;Ricky, the Drummer&quot;. About the same time, he made an unpaid public appearance, singing &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot; with The Four Preps at a Hamilton High School lunch-hour assembly in Los Angeles and was greeted by hordes of screaming teens who had seen the television episode.

&quot;I&#x27;m Walkin&#x27;&quot; reached No. 4 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Best Sellers in Stores chart, and its flip side, &quot;A Teenager&#x27;s Romance&quot;, hit No. 2. When the television series went on summer break in 1957, Nelson made his first road trip and played four state and county fairs in Ohio and Wisconsin with the Four Preps, who opened and closed for him.

===First album, band, and #1 single===
In early summer 1957, Ozzie Nelson pulled his son from Verve after disputes about royalties and signed him to a lucrative five-year deal with Imperial Records that gave him approval over song selection, sleeve artwork, and other production details. Ricky&#x27;s first Imperial single, &quot;Be-Bop Baby&quot;, generated 750,000 advance orders, sold over one million copies, and reached No. 3 on the charts. Nelson&#x27;s first album, &quot;Ricky&quot;, was released in October 1957 and hit No. 1 before the end of the year. Following these successes, Nelson was given a more prominent role on the &quot;Ozzie and Harriet&quot; show and ended every two or three episodes with a musical number.

Nelson grew increasingly dissatisfied performing with older jazz and country session musicians, who were openly contemptuous of rock and roll. After his Ohio and Minnesota tours in the summer of 1957, he decided to form his own band with members closer to his age. Eighteen-year-old electric guitarist James Burton was the first signed. Bassist James Kirkland, drummer Richie Frost, and pianist Gene Garf completed the band. Their first recording together was &quot;Believe What You Say&quot;. Prior to this, Joe Maphis had been playing the lead guitar part, and played lead on his first hits &quot;Be-Bop Baby&quot;, &quot;Stood Up&quot;, and &quot;Waitin In School&quot;.

In 1958, Nelson recorded 17-year-old Sharon Sheeley&#x27;s &quot;Poor Little Fool&quot; for his second album, &quot;Ricky Nelson&quot;, released in June 1958. Radio airplay brought the tune notice, and Imperial suggested releasing a single, but Nelson opposed the idea, believing a single would diminish EP sales. When a single was released nonetheless, he exercised his contractual right to approve any artwork and vetoed a picture sleeve. On August 4, 1958, &quot;Poor Little Fool&quot; became the No. 1 single on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s newly instituted Hot 100 singles chart and sold over two million copies.

Nelson stated:

During 1958 and 1959, Nelson had twelve hits in the charts in comparison with Elvis Presley&#x27;s eleven. During these two years, Presley had recorded music only for the movie &quot;King Creole&quot;, in January and February 1958, before his induction into the U.S. Armed Forces and a brief recording session (consisting of five songs) while on military leave four months later. In the summer of 1958, Nelson conducted his first full-scale tour, averaging $5,000 nightly. By 1960, the Ricky Nelson International Fan Club had 9,000 chapters around the world.
Nelson was the first teen idol to use television to promote hit records. Ozzie Nelson even had the idea to edit footage together to create some of the first music videos. This creative editing can be seen in videos Ozzie produced for &quot;Travelin&#x27; Man&quot;. Nelson appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in 1967, but his career by that time was in limbo. He also appeared on other television shows (usually in acting roles). In 1973, he had an acting role in an episode of &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;. He starred in the episode &quot;A Hand For Sonny Blue&quot; from the 1977 series &quot;Quinn Martin&#x27;s Tales of the Unexpected&quot; (known in the United Kingdom as &quot;Twist in the Tale&quot;). In 1979, he guest-hosted on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, spoofing his television sitcom image by appearing in a &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; sendup in which, always trying to go &quot;home,&quot; he finds himself among the characters from other 1950s/early 1960s-era sitcoms, &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;, &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;, &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot;, and &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;.

Nelson knew and loved music and was a skilled performer even before he became a teen idol, largely because of his parents&#x27; musical background. Nelson worked with many musicians of repute, including James Burton, Joe Osborn, and Allen &quot;Puddler&quot; Harris, all natives of Louisiana, and Joe Maphis, The Jordanaires, Scotty Moore, and Johnny and Dorsey Burnette.

Nelson&#x27;s music was very well recorded with a clear, punchy sound—thanks in part to engineer Bunny Robyn and producer Jimmy Haskell.

From 1957 to 1962, Nelson had 30 Top-40 hits, more than any other artist except Presley (who had 53) and Pat Boone (38). Many of Nelson&#x27;s early records were double hits with both the A and B sides hitting the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

While Nelson preferred rockabilly and uptempo rock songs like &quot;Believe What You Say&quot; (Hot 100 #4), &quot;I Got a Feeling&quot; (#10), &quot;My Bucket&#x27;s Got a Hole in It&quot; (#12), &quot;Hello Mary Lou&quot; (#9), &quot;It&#x27;s Late&quot; (#9), &quot;Stood Up&quot; (#2), &quot;Waitin&#x27; in School&quot; (#18), &quot;Be-Bop Baby&quot; (#3), and &quot;Just a Little Too Much&quot; (#9), his smooth, calm voice made him a natural to sing ballads. He had major success with &quot;Travelin&#x27; Man&quot; (#1), &quot;A Teenager&#x27;s Romance&quot; (#2), &quot;Poor Little Fool&quot; (#1), &quot;Young World&quot; (#5), &quot;Lonesome Town&quot; (#7), &quot;Never Be Anyone Else But You&quot; (#6), &quot;Sweeter Than You&quot; (#9), &quot;It&#x27;s Up to You&quot; (#6), and &quot;Teen Age Idol&quot; (#5).

==Film and Television actor==

In addition to his recording career, Nelson appeared in movies. He made his film debut in &quot;Here Come the Nelsons&quot; (1952) and had a small role in &quot;The Story of Three Loves&quot; (1953) at MGM directed by Vincente Minnelli playing Farley Granger as a boy.

Following his success on TV and with singing, Howard Hawks cast him as a gunslinger in &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; (1959) with John Wayne and Dean Martin; Hawks attributed much of the film&#x27;s box office success to Nelson.

Nelson co-starred with Jack Lemmon in &quot;The Wackiest Ship in the Army&quot; (1960), which was popular enough to give rise to a TV series (in which Nelson did not appear). He guest starred on &quot;General Electric Theatre&quot; (&quot;The Wish Book&quot;) and starred in a romantic comedy feature written and directed by his father, &quot;Love and Kisses&quot; (1965) with Jack Kelly.

Nelson guest starred on &quot;Hondo&quot; (playing Jesse James), and had a support role in &quot;The Over-the-Hill Gang&quot; (1969) with Walter Brennan and Pat O&#x27;Brien.

Nelson was in &quot;Fol-de-Rol&quot; (1972), guest starred on &quot;McCloud&quot;, &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law&quot;, &quot;Petrocelli&quot;, &quot;A Twist in the Tale&quot;, &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot;, and &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. On &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot; he played the part of &quot;Tony Eagle&quot; and performed various well-known Nelson songs throughout the episode.

He had support roles in the TV films &quot;Three on a Date&quot; and &quot;High School USA&quot; (1983).

==Name change and 1960s career==

On May 8, 1961 (his 21st birthday), he officially modified his recording name from &quot;Ricky Nelson&quot; to &quot;Rick Nelson&quot;. His childhood nickname proved hard to shake, especially among the generation who had watched him grow up on &quot;Ozzie and Harriet&quot;. Even in the 1980s, when Nelson realized his dream of meeting Carl Perkins, Perkins noted that he and &quot;Ricky&quot; were the last of the &quot;rockabilly breed&quot;.

In 1963, Nelson signed a 20-year contract with Decca Records. After some early successes with the label, most notably 1964&#x27;s &quot;For You&quot; (#6), Nelson&#x27;s chart career came to a dramatic halt in the wake of Beatlemania, The British Invasion, and later the Counterculture era. However, instead of dropping him, Decca kept him on board.

In the mid-1960s, Nelson began to move toward country music, becoming a pioneer in the country-rock genre. He was one of the early influences of the so-called &quot;California Sound&quot; (which would include singers like Jackson Browne and Linda Ronstadt and bands such as Eagles). Yet Nelson himself did not reach the Top 40 again until 1970, when he recorded Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;She Belongs to Me&quot; with the Stone Canyon Band, featuring Randy Meisner, who in 1971 became a founding member of the Eagles, and former Buckaroo steel guitarist Tom Brumley.

==&quot;Garden Party&quot; and short-lived comeback==

In 1972, Nelson reached the Top 40 one last time with &quot;Garden Party,&quot; a song he wrote in disgust after a Richard Nader Oldies Concert at Madison Square Garden where the audience booed, perhaps against some unrelated police action. However, Nelson may have felt that the reason was because he was playing new songs instead of just his old hits. When he performed The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Honky Tonk Women,&quot; there was booing, said to be against police and not him. He was watching the rest of the performance on a TV monitor backstage until Richard Nader finally convinced Nelson to return to the stage and play his &quot;oldies.&quot; He returned to the stage and played his &quot;oldies&quot; and the audience responded with applause, according to Deborah Nader, President of Richard Nader Entertainment. He wanted to record an album featuring original material, but the single was released before the album because Nelson had not completed the entire &quot;Garden Party&quot; album yet. &quot;Garden Party&quot; reached No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart and was certified as a gold single. The second single released from the album was &quot;Palace Guard&quot; which peaked at No. 65.

In 1973, MCA Records, whose parent company MCA Inc. had owned American Decca since 1962, ceased the label&#x27;s operations, and transferred Nelson (and many other Decca artists) to its roster. His comeback was short-lived, and Nelson&#x27;s band soon resigned. MCA wanted Nelson to have a producer on his next album. A new band was formed by Lindy Goetz, then a promotion person at MCA Records. Nelson&#x27;s band moved to Aspen and changed their name to &quot;Canyon.&quot; Nelson and the new Stone Canyon Band began to tour for the &quot;Garden Party&quot; album. Nelson still played nightclubs and bars, but he soon advanced to higher-paying venues because of the success of &quot;Garden Party.&quot;

In 1974, MCA was unsure as to what to do with the former teen idol. Albums like &quot;Windfall&quot; failed to have an impact. Nelson became an attraction at theme parks like Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm and Disneyland. He also started appearing in minor roles on television shows.

Nelson tried to score another hit but did not have any luck with songs like &quot;Rock and Roll Lady.&quot; With seven years to go on his contract, MCA dropped him from the label.

==Personal life==
In 1957, when Nelson was 17, he met and fell in love with Marianne Gaba, who played the role of Ricky&#x27;s girlfriend in three episodes of &quot;Ozzie and Harriet&quot;. Nelson and Gaba were too young to enter a serious relationship, although according to Gaba &quot;we used to neck &quot;for hours&quot;.&quot;

The next year, Nelson fell in love with 15-year-old Lorrie Collins, a country singer appearing on a weekly telecast called &quot;Town Hall Party&quot;. The two wrote Nelson&#x27;s first composition, the song &quot;My Gal&quot;, and she introduced him to Johnny Cash and Tex Ritter. Collins appeared in an &quot;Ozzie and Harriet&quot; episode as Ricky&#x27;s girlfriend and sang &quot;Just Because&quot; with him in the musical finale. They went steady and discussed marriage, but their parents discouraged the idea.

===Kris Harmon===
At Christmas 1961, Nelson began dating Kristin Harmon (June 25, 1945 – April 26, 2018), a daughter of football player Tom Harmon and actress Elyse Knox (née Elsie Kornbrath) and the older sister of Kelly and Mark Harmon. The Nelsons and the Harmons had long been friends, and a union between their children held great appeal. Rick and Kris had much in common: quiet dispositions, Hollywood upbringings, and high-powered, domineering fathers.

They married on April 20, 1963. Kris was pregnant, and Rick later described the union as a &quot;shotgun wedding&quot;. Nelson, a nonpracticing Protestant, received instruction in Catholicism at the insistence of the bride&#x27;s parents and signed a pledge to have any children of the union raised in the Catholic faith. Kris Nelson joined the television show as a regular cast member in 1963. They had four children: actress Tracy Kristine Nelson, twin sons Gunnar Eric Nelson and Matthew Gray Nelson who formed the band Nelson, and Sam Hilliard Nelson.

By 1975, following the birth of their last child, the marriage had deteriorated and a very public, controversial divorce involving both families was covered in the press for several years. In October 1977, Kris filed for divorce and asked for alimony, custody of their four children, and a portion of community property. The couple temporarily resolved their differences, but Kris retained her attorney to pursue a permanent break. Kris wanted Rick to give up music, spend more time at home, and focus on acting, but the family enjoyed a recklessly expensive lifestyle, and Kris&#x27;s extravagant spending left Rick no choice but to tour relentlessly. The impasse over Rick&#x27;s career created unpleasantness at home. Kris became an alcoholic and left the children in the care of household help. After years of legal proceedings, they were divorced in December 1982. The divorce was financially devastating for Nelson, with attorneys and accountants taking over $1 million. Years of legal wrangling followed.

===Helen Blair===

In 1980, Nelson met Helen Blair, a part-time model and exotic animal trainer, in Las Vegas. Within months of their meeting, she became his road companion, and in 1982 she began living with him. She was the only woman he dated after his divorce.

Blair acted as personal assistant to Nelson, organizing his day and acting as a liaison for his fan club, but Nelson&#x27;s mother, brother, business manager, and manager disapproved of her presence in his life. He contemplated marrying her but eventually declined. Blair died with Nelson in the airplane fire. Her name was never mentioned at Nelson&#x27;s funeral. Blair&#x27;s parents wanted their daughter buried next to Nelson at Forest Lawn Cemetery, but Harriet dismissed the idea. The Blairs refused to bury Helen&#x27;s remains and filed a $2 million wrongful death suit against Nelson&#x27;s estate. They received a small settlement.

==Death==
On December 31, 1985, Nelson died when the Douglas DC-3 on which he was a passenger crashed into trees, poles, and electrical wires, when it attempted to make an emergency landing while in flight between Guntersville, Alabama, and Dallas, Texas, where he was to perform a New Year&#x27;s Eve concert. Nelson&#x27;s DC-3 seemed constantly beset by mechanical problems. The fatal fire was caused by a defective heater in the tail of the plane. The heater caught fire and filled the cabin with toxic fumes. While both pilots survived, all seven passengers died.

<doc id="164401" wikidata="Q627438" url="?curid=164401" title="Arthur (1981 film)">
<text>Arthur is a 1981 American romantic comedy film written and directed by Steve Gordon. It stars Dudley Moore as Arthur Bach, a drunken New York City millionaire who is on the brink of an arranged marriage to a wealthy heiress but ends up falling for a common working-class young woman from Queens. It was the sole film directed by Gordon, who died in 1982 of a heart attack at age 44.

The film earned over $95 million domestically, making it the fourth highest-grossing film of 1981. Its title song, &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Theme (Best That You Can Do)&quot;, won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Co-written by Christopher Cross, Burt Bacharach, Carole Bayer Sager, and Peter Allen, it was performed by Cross. Sir John Gielgud also won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. It was nominated for two other Academy Awards for Best Actor for Moore and Best Original Screenplay for Gordon.

== Plot ==

Arthur Bach is a spoiled, alcoholic man-child from New York City, who likes to be driven in his chauffeured Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith limousine through Central Park. Arthur is heir to a portion of his family&#x27;s vast fortune, but only if he marries the upper-class Susan Johnson, the daughter of a business acquaintance of his father. He does not love Susan, but his family feels that she will make him finally grow up. During a shopping trip in Manhattan, accompanied by his valet, Hobson, Arthur witnesses a young woman, Linda Marolla, shoplifting a necktie. He intercedes with the store security guard on her behalf, and later asks her for a date. Despite his attraction to her, Arthur remains pressured by his family to marry Susan.

While visiting his grandmother, Martha, Arthur shares his feelings for Linda, but is warned again that he will be disowned if he does not marry Susan. Hobson, who has been more like a father to him than Arthur&#x27;s real father, realizes that Arthur is beginning to grow up, and secretly encourages Linda to attend Arthur&#x27;s engagement party. Hobson confides in Linda that he senses Arthur loves her. Linda crashes the party, held at the estate of Arthur&#x27;s father, and she and Arthur eventually spend time alone together, which is tracked by both families. Hobson is later hospitalized, and Arthur rushes to his side, vowing to care for the person who has long cared for him. After several weeks, Hobson dies, and then Arthur, who has been sober the entire time, goes on a drinking binge. On his wedding day, he visits the diner where Linda works and proposes to her. At the church, he jilts Susan, resulting in her father, Burt Johnson, attempting to stab Arthur with a cheese knife, though he is prevented by Martha.

A wounded Arthur announces in church there will be no wedding, then passes out soon after. Later, Linda tends to his wounds, and they discuss living a life of poverty. A horrified Martha tells Arthur that he can have his fortune, because no Bach has ever been working class. Arthur declines, but at the last minute, he talks privately to Martha. When he returns to Linda&#x27;s side, he tells her that he declined again – Martha&#x27;s dinner invitation, he means – but he did accept $750 million. Arthur&#x27;s pleased chauffeur Bitterman drives the couple through Central Park.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
Gordon originally wrote the title character with an American actor in mind. Prior to the casting of Moore, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson, John Travolta, Richard Dreyfuss, and James Caan were all considered for the role. In addition, Alec Guinness and David Niven were considered for the role of Hobson. John Belushi was also considered for Arthur. Initially, Gordon wanted Moore to perform the role with an American accent, but this proved contentious as Moore had trouble doing so and eventually convinced Gordon to let him use his natural English accent. While some critiques objected to the obvious difference in accent between Arthur and his biological father, others were quick to catch the deeper implication that Hobson taught Arthur to speak. Debra Winger reportedly turned down the role of Linda. Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton, Gilda Radner, and Meryl Streep were also considered for the role of Linda.

Although the project was initially in the works at Paramount Pictures, studio executives eventually dropped the project and Orion Pictures stepped in. Promoting the film proved to be a challenge; reportedly six ad campaigns were discarded before a final one was decided upon.

=== Soundtrack ===
Christopher Cross was initially asked to score the film, but writer-director Steven Gordon did not feel comfortable with his lack of experience in composing for film and the job was given to Burt Bacharach. Cross was asked to compose a song for the film which he did, &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Theme&quot;, which he wrote with Bacharach along with Carole Bayer Sager and Peter Allen.

== Reception ==
The film had a disappointing opening at the box office but improved its performance over its run, becoming the seventh highest-grossing film of the summer. It eventually earned over $95 million domestically, making it the fourth highest-grossing film of 1981.

The film received critical acclaim upon its release and is considered by many as one of the best films of 1981. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 86% based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Dudley Moore brings a boozy charm to &quot;Arthur&quot;, a coming of age tale for a wayward millionaire that deploys energetic cast chemistry and spiffy humor to jovial effect.&quot;

Then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan viewed this film at Camp David on July 25, 1981.

=== Accolades ===
=== Honors ===
The film was ranked 10 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot;.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – No. 53
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
** &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Theme (Best That You Can Do)&quot; – No. 79

=== Sequel ===
The film was followed by a sequel in 1988, &quot;Arthur 2: On the Rocks&quot;. Lead players Moore, Minnelli, and Gielgud reprised their roles, as well as supporting players such as Fitzgerald and Martin. The sequel was a critical and financial failure.

=== Remake ===
The 2011 version was first reported in 2008 with news that &quot;Arthur&quot; was to be remade by Warner Bros., with Russell Brand in the lead role. Brand confirmed this during his March 10, 2009, appearance on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;. The remake was an overall critical and financial failure.

=== Indian versions ===
The film had three Indian remakes: the 1984 Hindi-language film &quot;Sharaabi&quot;, the 1985 Kannada-language film &quot;Nee Thanda Kanike&quot;, and the 2004 Hindi &quot;Tumsa Nahin Dekha: A Love Story&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
The animated series &quot;The Critic&quot; starring Jon Lovitz shows a parody of &quot;Arthur&quot; called &quot;Arthur 3: Revenge of the Liver&quot;, where the character of Arthur Bach (voiced by Maurice LaMarche impersonating Dudley Moore) is shown intoxicated and is informed that he has cirrhosis of the liver.

<doc id="164402" wikidata="Q390314" url="?curid=164402" title="Magnetic dipole">
<text>The [[Magnetic dipole|[[magnetic field]]]] due to natural magnetic dipoles (upper left), [[magnetic monopole]]s (upper right), an [[electric current]] in a circular loop (lower left) or in a [[solenoid]] (lower right). All generate the same field profile when the arrangement is infinitesimally small.

In electromagnetism, a magnetic dipole is the limit of either a closed loop of electric current or a pair of poles as the size of the source is reduced to zero while keeping the magnetic moment constant. 

It is a magnetic analogue of the electric dipole, but the analogy is not perfect. In particular, a true magnetic monopole, the magnetic analogue of an electric charge, has never been observed in nature. However, magnetic monopole quasiparticles have been observed as emergent properties of certain condensed matter systems. Moreover, one form of magnetic dipole moment is associated with a fundamental quantum property—the spin of elementary particles.

Because magnetic monopoles do not exist, the magnetic field at a large distance from any static magnetic source looks like the field of a dipole with the same dipole moment. For higher-order sources (e.g. quadrupoles) with no dipole moment, their field decays towards zero with distance faster than a dipole field does.

== External magnetic field produced by a magnetic dipole moment ==

In classical physics, the magnetic field of a dipole is calculated as the limit of either a current loop or a pair of charges as the source shrinks to a point while keeping the magnetic moment constant. For the current loop, this limit is most easily derived from the vector potential:

: formula_1

where &quot;μ&quot;0 is the vacuum permeability constant and is the surface of a sphere of radius .
The magnetic flux density (strength of the B-field) is then

:formula_2

Alternatively one can obtain the scalar potential first from the magnetic pole limit,
:formula_3

and hence the magnetic field strength (or strength of the H-field) is
:formula_4

The magnetic field strength is symmetric under rotations about the axis of the magnetic moment.
In spherical coordinates, with formula_5, and with the magnetic moment aligned with the z-axis, then the field strength can more simply be expressed as

:formula_6

== Internal magnetic field of a dipole ==
The two models for a dipole (current loop and magnetic poles), give the same predictions for the magnetic field far from the source. However, inside the source region they give different predictions. The magnetic field between poles is in the opposite direction to the magnetic moment (which points from the negative charge to the positive charge), while inside a current loop it is in the same direction (see the figure to the right (above for mobile users)). Clearly, the limits of these fields must also be different as the sources shrink to zero size. This distinction only matters if the dipole limit is used to calculate fields inside a magnetic material.

If a magnetic dipole is formed by making a current loop smaller and smaller, but keeping the product of current and area constant, the limiting field is
:formula_7
where is the Dirac delta function in three dimensions. Unlike the expressions in the previous section, this limit is correct for the internal field of the dipole.

If a magnetic dipole is formed by taking a &quot;north pole&quot; and a &quot;south pole&quot;, bringing them closer and closer together but keeping the product of magnetic pole-charge and distance constant, the limiting field is
:formula_8

These fields are related by , where
:formula_9
is the magnetization.

== Forces between two magnetic dipoles ==
The force exerted by one dipole moment on another separated in space by a vector can be calculated using:

:formula_10

or

: formula_11

where is the distance between dipoles. The force acting on is in the opposite direction.

The torque can be obtained from the formula

: formula_12

== Dipolar fields from finite sources ==
The magnetic scalar potential produced by a finite source, but external to it, can be represented by a multipole expansion. Each term in the expansion is associated with a characteristic moment and a potential having a characteristic rate of decrease with distance from the source. Monopole moments have a rate of decrease, dipole moments have a rate, quadrupole moments have a rate, and so on. The higher the order, the faster the potential drops off. Since the lowest-order term observed in magnetic sources is the dipole term, it dominates at large distances. Therefore, at large distances any magnetic source looks like a dipole of the same magnetic moment.

<text>A scorched-earth policy is a military strategy of destroying everything that allows an enemy military force to be able to fight a war, including the deprivation and destruction of water, food, humans, animals, plants and any kind of tools and infrastructure. Its use is possible by a retreating army to leave nothing of value worth taking, to weaken the attacking force or by an advancing army to fight against unconventional warfare.

Scorched earth against non-combatants has been banned under the 1977 Geneva Conventions.

==Origin of the term==
The term was found in English in a 1937 report on the Second Sino-Japanese War. The retreating Chinese forces burned crops and destroyed infrastructure including cities to sabotage the logistics of the advancing Japanese forces.

==Military theory==
Clausewitz wrote in &quot;Principles of War&quot;:
Clausewitz wrote in &quot;On War&quot;:
==Historic examples==
Notable historic examples of successful scorched-earth tactics include the failed Swedish, French and German invasion of Russia, Sherman&#x27;s march to the sea during the American Civil War, Kit Carson&#x27;s campaign during the Navajo Wars in 1863 and Lord Kitchener&#x27;s methods in the Anglo-Boer War.

==6th century BCE==
===European Scythian campaign===
The Scythians used scorched-earth methods against the Persian Achaemenid Empire, led by King Darius the Great, during his European Scythian campaign. The Scythians, who were nomadic herders, evaded the Persian invaders and retreated into the depths of the steppes after they had destroyed food supplies and poisoned wells.

==4th century BCE==
===March of the Ten Thousand===
The Greek general Xenophon recorded in his &quot;Anabasis&quot; that the withdrawing enemy burnt up the grass and everything else that was good for use in front of the Ten Thousand.

==3rd century BCE==
===Second Punic War===
During the Second Punic War in 218–202 BCE, both Carthaginians and Romans used the method selectively during Hannibal&#x27;s invasion of Italy. After the Roman defeat at Lake Trasimene, Quintus Fabius Maximus instructed those living in the path of the invading Carthaginians to burn their houses and grain.

==2nd century BCE==
===Third Punic War===
After the end of the Third Punic War in 146 BCE, the Roman Senate also elected to use this method to permanently destroy the Carthaginian capital city, Carthage (near modern-day Tunis). The buildings were torn down, their stones scattered so not even rubble remained, and the fields were burned. However, the story that they salted the earth is apocryphal.

==1st century BCE==
===Gallic Wars===
The system of punitive destruction of property and subjugation of people when accompanying a military campaign was known as &quot;vastatio&quot;. Two of the first uses of scorched earth recorded happened in the Gallic Wars. The first was used when the Celtic Helvetii were forced to evacuate their homes in Southern Germany and Switzerland because of incursions of unfriendly Germanic tribes: to add incentive to the march, the Helvetii destroyed everything they could not bring.

The second case shows actual military value: during the Great Gallic War the Gauls under Vercingetorix planned to lure the Roman armies into Gaul and then trap and obliterate them. They thus ravaged the countryside of what are now the Benelux countries and France. This caused immense problems for the Romans, but the Roman military triumphs over the Gallic alliance showed that the ravaging alone was not to be enough to save Gaul from subjugation by Rome.

==4th century CE==
===Roman invasion of Persia===
In the year CE 363, the Emperor Julian&#x27;s invasion of Persia was turned back by a scorched-earth policy:

==7th century CE==
===First Fitna===
During the First Fitna (656–661), Muawiyah I sent Busr ibn Abi Artat to a campaign in the Hejaz and Yemen to ravage territory loyal to Muawiyah&#x27;s opponent Ali ibn Abi Talib. According to Tabari, 30,000 civilians are estimated to have been killed during that campaign of the civil war. Muawiyah also sent Sufyan ibn Awf to Iraq to burn the crops and homes of Ali&#x27;s supporters.

==9th century CE==
===Viking invasion of England===
During the Viking invasion of England, the Viking chieftain Hastein tried to occupy the ruined Roman fortress of Chester in late summer 893, planning to raid northern Mercia from the refortified fortress. But the Mercians destroyed all crops and livestock in the surrounding countryside and expelled the Vikings successfully.

==11th century==
===Harrying of the North===
In the Harrying of the North, William the Conqueror&#x27;s solution to stop a rebellion in 1069 was the brutal conquest and subjugation of northern England. William&#x27;s men burnt whole villages from the Humber to Tees and slaughtered the inhabitants. Food stores and livestock were destroyed so that anyone surviving the initial massacre would soon succumb to starvation over the winter. The destruction is depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry. The survivors were reduced to cannibalism, with one report stating that the skulls of the dead were cracked open so that their brains could be eaten. Between 100,000 and 150,000 perished, and the area took centuries to recover from the damage.

==14th century==
===Hundred Years&#x27; War===

During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, both the English and the French conducted chevauchée raids over the enemy territory to damage its infrastructure.

Robert the Bruce counselled using scorched earth to frustrate the invasion of Scotland by Edward I of England, according to an anonymous 14th-century poem:
===Wars of Scottish Independence===

A slighting is the deliberate destruction, whether partial or complete, of a fortification without opposition. Sometimes, such as during the Wars of Scottish Independence and the English Civil War, it was done to render the structure unusable as a fortress. In England, adulterine (unauthorised) castles would usually be slighted if captured by a king. During the Wars of Scottish Independence, Robert the Bruce adopted a strategy of slighting Scottish castles to prevent them from being occupied by the invading English. 

===Crusades===
A strategy of slighting castles in Palestine was also adopted by the Mamlukes during their wars with the Crusaders.

==15th century==
===Moldavian–Ottoman Wars===
Stephen the Great used scorched earth in the Carpathians against the Ottoman Army in 1475 and 1476.

===Wallachian–Ottoman Wars===
In 1462, a massive Ottoman army, led by Sultan Mehmed II, marched into Wallachia. Vlad the Impaler retreated to Transylvania. During his departure, he conducted scorched-earth tactics to ward off Mehmed&#x27;s approach. When the Ottoman forces approached Tirgoviste, they encountered over 20,000 people impaled by the forces of Vlad the Impaler, creating a &quot;forest&quot; of dead or dying bodies on stakes. The atrocious, gut-wrenching sight caused Mehmed to withdraw from battle and send instead Radu, Vlad&#x27;s brother, to fight Vlad the Impaler.

==16th century==
===Anglicisation of the Irish===
Further use of scorched-earth policies in war was seen during the 16th century in Ireland, where it was used by English commanders such as Walter Devereux and Richard Bingham.

The Desmond Rebellions were a famous case in Ireland. Much of the province of Munster was laid waste. The poet Edmund Spenser left an account of it:
===Great Siege of Malta===

In early 1565, Grandmaster Jean Parisot de Valette ordered the harvesting of all the crops in Malta, including unripened grain, to deprive the Ottomans of any local food supplies since spies had warned of an imminent Ottoman attack. Furthermore, the Knights poisoned all of the wells with bitter herbs and dead animals. The Ottomans arrived on 18 May, and the Great Siege of Malta began. The Ottomans managed to capture one fort but were eventually defeated by the Knights, the Maltese militia and a Spanish relief force.

==17th century==
===Thirty Years&#x27; War===
In 1630, Field-Marshal General Torquato Conti was in command of the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s forces during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Forced to retreat from the advancing Swedish army of King Gustavus Adolphus, Conti ordered his troops to burn houses, destroy villages and cause as much harm generally to property and people as possible.:
===Nine Years&#x27; War===

In 1688, France attacked the German Electoral Palatinate. The German states responded by forming an alliance and assembling a sizeable armed force to push the French out of Germany. The French had not prepared for such an eventuality. Realising that the war in Germany was not going to end quickly and that the war would not be a brief and decisive parade of French glory, Louis XIV and War Minister Marquis de Louvois resolved upon a scorched-earth policy in the Palatinate, Baden and Württemberg. The French were intent on denying enemy troops local resources and on preventing the Germans from invading France. By 20 December 1688, Louvois had selected all the cities, towns, villages and châteaux intended for destruction. On 2 March 1689, the Count of Tessé torched Heidelberg, and on 8 March, Montclar levelled Mannheim. Oppenheim and Worms were finally destroyed on 31 May, followed by Speyer on 1 June, and Bingen on 4 June. In all, French troops burnt over 20 substantial towns as well as numerous villages.

===Mughal–Maratha Wars===
In the Maratha Empire, Shivaji Maharaj had introduced scorched-earth tactics, known as &quot;Ganimi Kava&quot;. His forces looted traders and businessmen from Aurangzeb&#x27;s Mughal Empire and burnt down his cities, but they were strictly ordered not to rape or hurt the innocent civilians and not to cause any sort of disrespect to any of the religious institutes.

Shivaji&#x27;s son, Sambhaji Maharaj, was detested throughout the Mughal Empire for his scorched-earth tactics until he and his men were captured by Muqarrab Khan and his Mughal Army contingent of 25,000. On 11 March 1689, a panel of Mughal qadis indicted and sentenced Sambhaji to death on accusations of casual torture, arson, looting and massacres but most prominently for giving shelter to Sultan Muhammad Akbar, the fourth son of Aurangzeb, who had sought Sambhaji&#x27;s aid in winning the Mughal throne from the emperor, his father. Sambhaji was particularly condemned for the three days of ravaging committed after the Battle of Burhanpur.

==18th century==
===Great Northern War===
During the Great Northern War, Russian Emperor Peter the Great&#x27;s forces used scorched-earth tactics to hold back Swedish King Charles XII&#x27;s campaign towards Moscow in 1707–1708.

===Sullivan–Clinton genocide===
In 1779 Congress decided to defeat the four British allied nations of the Iroquois decisively during the American Revolutionary War with the Sullivan Expedition. General John Sullivan used a scorched earth campaign by destroying more than 40 Iroquois villages and their stores of winter crops resulting in many deaths by starvation and cold in the following winter.

===Haitian Revolution against Napoleon===
In a letter to Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Toussaint Louverture outlined his plans for defeating the French in the Haitian Revolution starting in 1791 using scorched-earth: &quot;Do not forget, while waiting for the rainy reason which will rid us of our foes, that we have no other resource than destruction and fire. Bear in mind that the soil bathed with our sweat must not furnish our enemies with the smallest sustenance. Tear up the roads with shot; throw corpses and horses into all the foundations, burn and annihilate everything in order that those who have come to reduce us to slavery may have before their eyes the image of the hell which they deserve&quot;.

==19th century==
===Napoleonic Wars===
During the third Napoleonic invasion of Portugal in 1810, the Portuguese population retreated towards Lisbon and was ordered to destroy all the food supplies the French might capture as well as forage and shelter in a wide belt across the country. (Although effective food-preserving techniques had recently been invented, they were still not fit for military use because a suitably-rugged container had not yet been invented.) The command was obeyed as a result of French plundering and general ill-treatment of civilians in the previous invasions. The civilians would rather destroy anything that had to be left behind, rather than leave it to the French. When the French armies reached the Lines of Torres Vedras on the way to Lisbon, French soldiers reported that the country &quot;seemed to empty ahead of them&quot;. Low morale, hunger, disease and indiscipline greatly weakened the French army and compelled the forces to retreat, see also Attrition warfare against Napoleon.
In 1812, Emperor Alexander I was able to render Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia useless by using a scorched-earth policy. As Russians withdrew from the advancing French army, they burned the countryside over which they passed (and allegedly Moscow), leaving nothing of value for the pursuing French army. Encountering only desolate and useless land Napoleon&#x27;s Grande Armée was prevented from using its usual doctrine of living off the lands that it conquered. Pushing relentlessly on despite dwindling numbers, the Grand Army met with disaster as the invasion progressed. Napoleon&#x27;s army arrived in a virtually-abandoned Moscow, which was a tattered starving shell of its former self, largely because of scorched-earth tactics by the retreating Russians. Having conquered essentially nothing, Napoleon&#x27;s troops retreated, but the scorched-earth policy came into effect again because even though some large supply dumps had been established on the advance, the route between them had both been scorched and marched over once already. Thus, the French army starved as it marched along the resource-depleted invasion route.

===South American War of Independence===
In August 1812, Argentine General Manuel Belgrano led the Jujuy Exodus, a massive forced displacement of people from what is now Jujuy and Salta Provinces to the south. The Jujuy Exodus was conducted by the patriot forces of the Army of the North, which was battling a Royalist army.

Belgrano, faced with the prospect of total defeat and territorial loss, ordered all people to pack their necessities, including food and furniture, and to follow him in carriages or on foot together with whatever cattle and beasts of burden that could endure the journey. The rest (houses, crops, food stocks and any objects made of iron) was to be burned to deprive the Royalists of resources. The strict scorched-earth policy made him ask on 29 July 1812 the people of Jujuy to &quot;show their heroism&quot; and to join the march of the army under his command &quot;if, as you assure, you want to be free&quot;. The punishment for ignoring the order was execution, with the destruction of the defector&#x27;s properties. Belgrano labored to win the support of the populace and later reported that most of the people had willingly followed him without the need for force.

The exodus started on 23 August and gathered people from Jujuy and Salta. People travelled south about 250 km and finally arrived at the banks of the Pasaje River, in Tucumán Province in the early hours of 29 August. They applied a scorched-earth policy and so the Spaniards advanced into a wasteland. Belgrano&#x27;s army destroyed everything that could provide shelter or be useful to the Royalists.

===Greek War of Independence===
In 1827, Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt led an Ottoman-Egyptian combined force in a campaign to crush Greek revolutionaries in the Peloponnese. In response to Greek guerrilla attacks on his forces in the Peloponnese, Ibrahim launched a scorched earth campaign that threatened the population with starvation and deported many civilians into slavery in Egypt. The fires of burning villages and fields were clearly visible from Allied ships standing offshore. A British landing party reported that the population of Messinia was close to mass starvation. Ibrahim&#x27;s scorched-earth policy caused much outrage in Europe, which was one factor for the Great Powers (United Kingdom, the Kingdom of France and the Russian Empire) decisively intervening against him in the Battle of Navarino.

===American Civil War===
In the American Civil War, Union forces under Philip Sheridan and William Tecumseh Sherman used the policy widely:
General Sherman used that policy during his March to the Sea.

Another event, in response to William Quantrill&#x27;s raid on Lawrence, Kansas, and the many civilian casualties, including the killing of 150 men, Brigadier General Thomas Ewing Jr., Sherman&#x27;s brother-in-law, issued US Army General Order No. 11 (1863) to order the near-total evacuation of three-and-a-half counties in western Missouri, south of Kansas City, which were subsequently looted and burned by US Army troops. Under Sherman&#x27;s overall direction, General Philip Sheridan followed that policy in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia and then in the Indian Wars of the Great Plains.
When General Ulysses Grant&#x27;s forces broke through the defenses of Richmond, Virginia, Confederate President Jefferson Davis ordered the destruction of Richmond&#x27;s military supplies. The resulting fires quickly spread to other buildings, as well as to the Confederate warships docked on the James River. Civilians in panic were forced to escape the city as it quickly burned.

===Native American Wars===
During the wars with Native American tribes of the American West, Kit Carson, under James Henry Carleton&#x27;s direction, instituted a scorched-earth policy, burning fields and homes destroying any livestock. He was aided by other Indian tribes with long-standing enmity toward the Navajos, chiefly the Ute tribe. The Navajo were forced to surrender because of the destruction of their livestock and food supplies. In the spring of 1864, 8000 Navajo men, women, and children were forced to march 300 miles to Fort Sumner, New Mexico. Navajos call it &quot;The Long Walk.&quot;

===Second Boer War===
During the Second Boer War (1899–1902), British forces applied a scorched-earth policy in the occupied Boer republics under the direction of General Lord Kitchener. Numerous Boers, refusing to accept military defeat, adopted guerrilla warfare despite the capture of both of their capital cities. As a result, under Lord Kitchener&#x27;s command British forces initiated a policy of the destruction of the farms and the homes of civilians in the republics to prevent the Boers who were still fighting from obtaining food and supplies. Boer noncombatants inhabiting the republics (mostly women and children) were interned in concentration camps to prevent them from supplying guerillas still in the field.

The existence of the concentration camps was exposed by English activist Emily Hobhouse, who toured the camps and began petitioning the British government to change its policy. In an attempt to counter Hobhouse&#x27;s activism, the British government commissioned the Fawcett Commission, but it confirmed Hobhouse&#x27;s findings. The British government then claimed that it perceived the concentration camps to be humanitarian measure and were established to care for displaced noncombatants until the war&#x27;s end, in response to mounting criticism of the camps in Britain. A number of factors, including outbreaks of infectious diseases, a lack of planning and supplies for the camps, and overcrowding led to numerous internees dying in the camps. A decade after the war, historian P. L. A. Goldman estimated that 27,927 Boers died in the concentration camps, 26,251 women and children (of whom more than 22,000 were under the age of 16) and 1,676 men over the age of 16, with 1,421 being above the age of 16.
The number of Black Africans who also suffered the same is unknown.

===New Zealand Wars===
In 1868, the Tūhoe, who had sheltered the Māori leader Te Kooti, were thus subjected to a scorched-earth policy in which their crops and buildings were destroyed and the people of fighting age were captured.

==20th century==
===World War I===

On the Eastern Front of World War I, the Imperial Russian Army created a zone of destruction by using a massive scorched-earth strategy during their retreat from the Imperial German Army in the summer and the autumn of 1915. The Russian troops, retreating along a front of more than 600 miles, destroyed anything that might be of use to their enemy, including crops, houses, railways and entire cities. They also forcibly removed huge numbers of people. In pushing the Russian troops back into Russia&#x27;s interior, the German army gained a large area of territory from the Russian Empire that is now Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, Latvia and Lithuania.

In late 1916 the British army set fire to the Romanian oil fields in order to prevent the central powers from capturing them. 800 million litres of oil were burned.

On the Western Front on 24 February 1917, the German army made a strategic scorched-earth withdrawal (Operation Alberich) from the Somme battlefield to the prepared fortifications of the Hindenburg Line to shorten the line that had to be occupied. Since a scorched-earth campaign requires a war of movement, the Western Front provided little opportunity for the policy as the war was mostly a stalemate and was fought mostly in the same concentrated area for its entire duration.

===Greco-Turkish War===
During the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922), the retreating Greek Army carried out a scorched-earth policy while it was fleeing from Anatolia in the final phase of the war. The historian Sydney Nettleton Fisher wrote, &quot;The Greek army in retreat pursued a burned-earth policy and committed every known outrage against defenceless Turkish villagers in its path&quot;.

Norman Naimark noted that &quot;the Greek retreat was even more devastating for the local population than the occupation&quot;.

===Second Sino-Japanese War===
During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Imperial Japanese Army had a scorched-earth policy, known as &quot;Three Alls Policy&quot;, which caused immense environmental and infrastructure damage to be recorded. It contributed to the complete destruction of entire villages and partial destruction of entire cities.

The Chinese National Revolutionary Army destroyed dams and levees in an attempt to flood the land to slow down the advancement of Japanese soldiers, which further added to the environmental impact and resulted in the 1938 Yellow River flood. In the 1938 Changsha fire, the city of Changsha was put on fire by the Kuomintang to prevent any wealth from falling into enemy hands.

===World War II===
At the start of the Winter War in 1939, the Finns used the tactic in the vicinity of the border in order to deprive the invading Soviet Red Army&#x27;s provisions and shelter for the forthcoming cold winter. In some cases, fighting took place in areas that were familiar to the Finnish soldiers who were fighting it. There were accounts of soldiers burning down their very own homes and parishes. One of the burned parishes was Suomussalmi.

When Germany attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941, many district governments took the initiative to begin a partial scorched-earth policy to deny the invaders access to electrical, telecommunications, rail, and industrial resources. Parts of the telegraph network were destroyed, some rail and road bridges were blown up, most electrical generators were sabotaged through the removal of key components, and many mineshafts were collapsed.

The process was repeated later in the war by the German forces of Army Group North and Erich von Manstein&#x27;s Army Group Don, which stole crops, destroyed farms, and razed cities and smaller settlements during several military operations. The rationale for the policy was that it would slow pursuing Soviet forces by forcing them to save their own civilians. The best-known victims of the German scorched-earth policy were the people of the historic city of Novgorod, which was razed during the winter of 1944 to cover Army Group North&#x27;s retreat from Leningrad.
Near the end of the summer of 1944, Finland, which had made a separate peace with the Allies, was required to evict the German forces, which had been fighting against the Soviets alongside Finnish troops in northern Finland. The Finnish forces, under the leadership of General Hjalmar Siilasvuo, struck aggressively in late September 1944 by making a landfall at Tornio. That accelerated the German retreat, and by November 1944, the Germans had left most of northern Finland. The German forces, forced to retreat because of an overall strategic situation, covered their retreat towards Norway by devastating large areas of northern Finland by using a scorched-earth strategy. More than a third of the area&#x27;s dwellings were destroyed, and the provincial capital Rovaniemi was burned to the ground. All but two bridges in Lapland Province were blown up, and all roads were mined.

In northern Norway, which was also being invaded by Soviet forces in pursuit of the retreating Wehrmacht in 1944, the Germans also undertook a scorched-earth policy of destroying every building that could offer shelter and thus interposing a belt of &quot;scorched earth&quot; between themselves and the allies.

In 1945, Adolf Hitler ordered his minister of armaments, Albert Speer, to carry out a nationwide scorched-earth policy, in what became known as the Nero Decree. Speer, who was looking to the future, actively resisted the order, just as he had earlier refused Hitler&#x27;s command to destroy French industry when the Wehrmacht was being driven out of France. Speer managed to continue doing so even after Hitler became aware of his actions.

During the Second World War, the railroad plough was used during retreats in Germany, Czechoslovakia and other countries to deny enemy use of railways by partially destroying them.

===Malayan Liberation War===
Britain was the first nation to employ herbicides and defoliants (chiefly Agent Orange) to destroy the crops and the bushes of Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA) insurgents in Malaya during the Malayan Emergency. The intent was to prevent MNLA insurgents from utilizing rice fields to resupply their rations and using them as a cover to ambush passing convoys of Commonwealth troops.

===Goa War===
In response to India&#x27;s invasion of Portuguese Goa in December 1961 during the annexation of Portuguese India, orders delivered from Portuguese President Américo Tomás called for a scorched-earth policy for Goa to be destroyed before its surrender to India.

However, despite his orders from Lisbon, Governor General Manuel António Vassalo e Silva took stock of the superiority of the Indian troops and of his forces&#x27; supplies of food and ammunition and took the decision to surrender. He later described his orders to destroy Goa as &quot;a useless sacrifice&quot; (&quot;um sacrifício inútil&quot;)&quot;.

===Vietnam War===
The United States used Agent Orange as a part of its herbicidal warfare program Operation Ranch Hand to destroy crops and foliage to expose possible enemy hideouts during the Vietnam War. Agent Blue was used on rice fields to deny food to the Viet Cong.

===Guatemalan Civil War===
Efraín Ríos Montt used the policy in Guatemala&#x27;s highlands in 1981 and 1982, but it had been used under the previous president, Fernando Romeo Lucas García. Upon entering office, Ríos Montt implemented a new counterinsurgency strategy that called for the use of scorched earth to combat the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity rebels. Plan Victoria 82 was more commonly known by the nickname of the rural pacification elements of the strategy, &quot;Fusiles y Frijoles&quot; (Bullets and Beans). Ríos Montt&#x27;s policies resulted in the death of thousands, most of them indigenous Mayans.

===Indonesia===

The Indonesian military used the method during Indonesian National Revolution when the British forces in Bandung gave an ultimatum for Indonesian fighters to leave the city. In response, the southern part of Bandung was deliberately burned down in an act of defiance as they left the city on 24 March 1946. This event is known as the Bandung Sea of Fire (&quot;Bandung Lautan Api&quot;).

The Indonesian military and pro-Indonesia militias also used the method in the 1999 East Timorese crisis. The Timor-Leste scorched-earth campaign was around the time of East Timor&#x27;s referendum for independence in 1999.

===Yugoslav Wars===
The method was used during the Yugoslav Wars that started in 1991, such as against the Serbs in Krajina by the Croatian Army, and by Serbian paramilitary groups.

===Soviet–Afghan War===
The Soviet army used scorched-earth tactics against towns and villages in 1983 to 1984 in the Soviet–Afghan War to prevent the return of the Mujahideen by a migratory genocide. The Soviet army used mines extensively in the bordering provinces to Pakistan to cut off weapon supply.

==21st century==

===Sri Lankan Civil War===
During the 2009 Sri Lankan Civil War, the United Nations Regional Information Centre accused the government of Sri Lanka of using scorched-earth tactics.

===Myanmar civil war===

In March 2023, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned the Burmese military&#x27;s use of a scorched earth strategy, which has killed thousands of civilians, displaced 1.3 million people and destroyed 39,000 houses throughout the country since the 2021 Myanmar coup d&#x27;état, as the military has denied humanitarian access to survivors, razed entire villages, and used indiscriminate airstrikes and artillery shelling.

==In business world==
The concept of scorched-earth defense is sometimes applied figuratively to the business world in which a firm facing a takeover attempts to make itself less valuable by selling off its assets.

<doc id="164411" wikidata="Q1216268" url="?curid=164411" title="Absence of Malice">
<text>Absence of Malice is a 1981 American drama neo noir thriller film directed by Sydney Pollack and starring Paul Newman, Sally Field, Wilford Brimley, Melinda Dillon and Bob Balaban.

The title refers to one of the defenses against libel defamation. It is used in journalism classes to illustrate the conflict between disclosing damaging personal information and the public&#x27;s right to know.

==Plot==
Miami liquor wholesaler Michael Gallagher, the son of a deceased criminal, awakens to find himself a front-page story in the local newspaper. The paper indicates that he is being investigated in the disappearance and presumed murder of a longshoremans&#x27; union official, Joey Diaz.

The story was written by &quot;Miami Standard&quot; newspaper reporter Megan Carter. She acquired it from reading a file left intentionally on the desktop of federal prosecutor Elliot Rosen, who is doing a bogus investigation. He leaked it in order to squeeze Gallagher for information.

Gallagher comes to the newspaper&#x27;s office trying to discover Carter&#x27;s basis for the story, but the reporter does not reveal her source. Gallagher&#x27;s business is shut down by union officials, who are suspicious of him since he has been implicated in Diaz&#x27;s murder. Gallagher&#x27;s uncle, local crime boss Malderone, has him followed in case he talks to the government.

Teresa Perrone, a friend of Gallagher, tells Carter that Gallagher could not have killed Diaz because he took her out of town to get an abortion that weekend. A devout Catholic, she does not want Carter to reveal the abortion, but she includes it in the story anyway.

The paper&#x27;s editor tells Carter that Perrone has died by suicide. Carter goes to Gallagher to apologize, but he physically assaults her. She attempts to make it up to him by revealing Rosen&#x27;s role in the investigation.

Gallagher hatches a plan for revenge. He arranges a secret meeting with District Attorney Quinn, offering to use his organized-crime contacts to give Quinn information on Diaz&#x27;s murder in exchange for the D.A. calling off the investigation and issuing a statement clearing him. He also makes anonymous contributions to one of Quinn&#x27;s political action committee backers and then he and Carter begin a love affair.

Rosen is mystified by Quinn&#x27;s exoneration of Gallagher, so he places phone taps on both and surveils their movements. He and federal agent Bob Waddell obtain evidence of Gallagher&#x27;s donations to Quinn&#x27;s political committee. They also find out about Gallagher and Carter&#x27;s relationship. Waddell, as a friend, warns Carter about the investigation, but she breaks the story that the federal strike force is investigating Gallagher&#x27;s attempt to bribe the D.A.

The story makes the front page again and causes an uproar over the investigation of the district attorney. Assistant US Attorney General Wells 
calls the principals together and offers them a choice between going before a grand jury or informally making their case to him. Rosen questions Gallagher but it becomes apparent that he has no case, and Carter reveals that Rosen left Gallagher&#x27;s file open on his desk for her to read.

Wells suggests that Quinn resign because Gallagher&#x27;s legal donations to Quinn’s political committee cast suspicions on his motives in issuing his statement clearing Gallagher. Wells also suspects that Gallagher set everything up but cannot prove it, so he will not investigate further. Finally, he fires Rosen for malfeasance. The newspaper prints a story written by a different reporter revealing details of the incidents.

The final scene shows Carter and Gallagher having a cordial conversation on the wharf where Gallagher&#x27;s boat is docked before he sails away and leaves the city.

==Cast==

==Production==
The movie was written by Kurt Luedtke, a former newspaper editor, and David Rayfiel (uncredited). Newman said that the film was a &quot;direct attack on the &quot;New York Post&quot;,&quot; which had earlier published a caption for a photo of Newman that he said was inaccurate. Because of the dispute, the &quot;Post&quot; banned Newman from its pages, even removing his name from movies in the TV listings.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Absence of Malice&quot; received mostly positive reviews. Newman and Dillon&#x27;s performances were praised, as was Brimley&#x27;s cameo. Many reviewers compared the film to the 1976 Oscar-winner &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;. In his review, &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Richard Schickel wrote &quot;&quot;Absence of Malice&quot; does not invalidate &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;. But with entertainment values – and a moral sense – every bit as high as that film&#x27;s, it observes that there is an underside to journalistic gallantry.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a splendidly disturbing look at the power of sloppy reporting to inflict harm on the innocent.&quot;

The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;″ Roger Ebert wrote that some may take the approach &quot;that no respectable journalist would ever do the things that Sally Field does about, to, and with Paul Newman in this movie. She is a disgrace to her profession.&quot; Instead he preferred a &quot;romantic&quot; approach, writing that he &quot;liked this movie despite its factual and ethical problems&quot; and was not &quot;even so sure they matter so much to most viewers&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found the movie &quot;lacking in momentum&quot;, but praised its &quot;quiet gravity&quot;. Although Pauline Kael described the film as only &quot;moderately entertaining&quot;, she offered higher praise for Newman&#x27;s &quot;sly, compact performance&quot; and particularly for &quot;the marvelously inventive acting of Melinda Dillon&quot;.

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 81% based on reviews from 27 critics, with an average score of 6.8/10.

===Academic use===
&quot;Absence of Malice&quot; has been used in journalism and public administration courses to illustrate professional errors such as writing a story without seeking confirmation and having a romantic relationship with a source.

===Box office===
The film was a box office success. &quot;Film Comment&quot; said &quot;It was the first picture in ages that had Newman playing opposite a strong female co-star in a romantic vein and Columbia astutely capitalized on public desire to see Newman in such a role again.&quot;

They were originally formed as a backing group for Clyde McPhatter, formerly the lead tenor of Billy Ward and his Dominoes in 1953. The second group of Drifters, formed in 1959 and led by Ben E. King, were originally an up-and-coming group named The Five Crowns. After 1965, members swapped in and out of both groups and many of these formed other groups of Drifters as well. Over the succeeding decades, several different bands, all called the Drifters, can trace roots back to these original groups, but contain few—if any—original members.

According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the Drifters were the least stable of the great vocal groups, as they were low-paid musicians hired by George Treadwell, who owned the Drifters&#x27; name from 1955, after McPhatter left. The Treadwell Drifters line has had 60 musicians, including several splinter groups by former Drifters members (not under Treadwell&#x27;s management). These groups are usually identified with a possessive credit such as &quot;Bill Pinkney&#x27;s Original Drifters&quot;, &quot;Charlie Thomas&#x27; Drifters&quot;.

The three golden eras of the Drifters were the early 1950s, the 1960s, and the early 1970s (post-Atlantic period). From these, the first Drifters, formed by Clyde McPhatter, were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame as &quot;The Drifters&quot;. The second Drifters, featuring Ben E. King, were separately inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame as &quot;Ben E. King and the Drifters&quot;. In their induction, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame selected four members from the first Drifters, two from the second Drifters, and one from the post-Atlantic Drifters. There were other lead singers too, but the group was less successful during those times.

According to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame: &quot;Through turmoil and changes, the (original) Drifters managed to set musical trends and give the public 13 chart hits, most of which are legendary recordings today.&quot; Matching that feat, subsequent formations of the Drifters recorded 13 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top-30 chart hits. The 1950s and &#x27;60s incarnations of the group were also a force on the US R&amp;B charts, notching six number-one R&amp;B hits: &quot;Money Honey&quot; (1953), &quot;Honey Love&quot; (1954), &quot;Adorable&quot; (1955), &quot;There Goes My Baby&quot; (1959), &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me&quot; (1960), and &quot;Under The Boardwalk&quot; (1964). A 1970s revival in Britain, with both old and new material, was not matched in the United States, although they had their biggest successes on the UK singles chart, peaking with the number-two hit &quot;Kissin&#x27; in the Back Row of the Movies&quot;.

==History==
===Classic first Drifters and Clyde McPhatter===
To historians and many fans, &quot;The Drifters&quot; means Clyde McPhatter, although he was with the group for only one year. McPhatter was lead tenor for Billy Ward and His Dominoes for three years, starting in 1950. McPhatter&#x27;s high-pitched tenor was mostly responsible for the Dominoes&#x27; success. In 1953, Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records attended a Dominoes performance at Birdland, and noticed McPhatter was absent. Jerry Wexler recalled,

Ahmet exited Birdland like a shot and headed directly uptown. He raced from bar to bar looking for Clyde and finally found him in a furnished room. That very night, Ahmet reached an agreement with McPhatter under which Clyde would assemble a group of his own. They became known as the Drifters.

Wanting to blend gospel and secular sounds, McPhatter&#x27;s first effort was to get members of his church group, the Mount Lebanon Singers: William &quot;Chick&quot; Anderson, Charlie White, and David &quot;Little Dave&quot; Baughan (tenors); David Baldwin (baritone, and author James Baldwin&#x27;s brother); and James &quot;Wrinkle&quot; Johnson (bass). After a recording session of four songs on June 29, 1953, Ertegun realized that this combination did not work, and had McPhatter recruit another lineup. The second group included first tenor Bill Pinkney (of the Jerusalem Stars), second tenor Andrew Thrasher, and baritone Gerhart Thrasher (both of the gospel group &quot;The Thrasher Wonders&quot;), Willie Ferbee as bass vocal, and Walter Adams on guitar.

This is the group on the second session that produced their first major hit, &quot;Money Honey&quot;, released September 1953, with the record label displaying the group name &quot;Clyde McPhatter and the Drifters&quot;. McPhatter was barely known during his time with the Dominoes, and he was sometimes passed off as &quot;Clyde Ward, Billy&#x27;s little brother&quot;. In other instances, people assumed Billy Ward was doing the singing.

&quot;Lucille&quot;, written by McPhatter, from the first recording session, was put on the B-side of &quot;Money Honey&quot;, making a recording industry rarity; a single released with two songs by two essentially different groups of the same name. &quot;Money Honey&quot; was a huge success, and propelled the Drifters to immediate fame.

More lineup changes followed after Ferbee was involved in an accident and left the group. After Adams died, he was replaced by Jimmy Oliver. Ferbee was not replaced; instead, the voice parts were shifted around. Gerhart Thrasher moved up to first tenor, Andrew Thrasher shifted down to baritone, and Bill Pinkney dropped to bass. This group released several more hits, including &quot;Such A Night&quot; in November 1953, &quot;Honey Love&quot; June 1954, &quot;Bip Bam&quot; October 1954, &quot;White Christmas&quot; November 1954, and &quot;What&#x27;cha Gonna Do&quot; in February 1955. McPhatter received his draft letter in March 1954, but as he was initially stationed in Buffalo, New York, he was able to continue with the group for a time. &quot;What&#x27;cha Gonna Do&quot;, recorded a year before its release, was McPhatter&#x27;s last official record as a member of the Drifters, although his first solo release (&quot;Everyone&#x27;s Laughing&quot; b/w &quot;Hot Ziggety&quot;) was from his final Drifters session in October 1954. After completing his military service, McPhatter pursued a successful but relatively short-lived solo career with 16 R&amp;B and 21 pop hits.

McPhatter demanded a large share of the group&#x27;s profits, which he had been denied in the Dominoes; on his departure, though, he did not ensure that this would continue for his successor. He sold his share of the group to George Treadwell, manager, former jazz trumpeter, and husband of singer Sarah Vaughan. As a result, the Drifters recycled many members, none of whom made much money and got paid a mere $100 a week (US$ in dollars). McPhatter later expressed regret at this action, recognizing that it doomed his fellow musicians to unprofitability.

McPhatter was first replaced by original member David Baughan, who had been singing lead in concert while McPhatter was in the service. Baughan&#x27;s voice was similar to McPhatter&#x27;s, but his erratic behavior made him difficult to work with and unsuitable in the eyes of Atlantic Records executives. Baughan soon left the group to form the Harps (1955) (finding his way back into Bill Pinkney&#x27;s Original Drifters in 1958), and was replaced by Johnny Moore (formerly of The Hornets). During September 1955, this lineup recorded an R&amp;B hit with the A side &quot;Adorable&quot; reaching number one and the B side &quot;Steamboat&quot; going to number five. These were followed by &quot;Ruby Baby&quot; in February 1956, and &quot;I Gotta Get Myself a Woman&quot;.

Low salaries contributed to burnout among the members. Bill Pinkney was fired after asking Treadwell for more money. In protest, Andrew Thrasher left, as well. Pinkney formed The Flyers with lead singer Bobby Hendricks, who would leave to join the Drifters the next year. Pinkney was replaced by Tommy Evans (who had replaced Jimmy Ricks in The Ravens). Charlie Hughes, a baritone, replaced Andrew Thrasher. Moore, Evans, Gerhart Thrasher, and Charlie Hughes got a top-10 hit in 1957 with &quot;Fools Fall In Love&quot; (number 69 Pop and number 10 R&amp;B).

Moore and Hughes were drafted in 1957 and replaced by Bobby Hendricks and Jimmy Milner. By early 1958, the lineup was Bobby Hendricks (lead tenor), Gerhart Thrasher (first tenor), Jimmy Milner (baritone), Tommy Evans (bass), and Jimmy Oliver (guitar). This lineup had one moderate hit, &quot;Drip Drop&quot; (number 58 Pop), released in April 1958.

With declining popularity, the last of the original Drifters were reduced to working the club scene and doing double duty with gigs under the Coasters and the Ravens names. By May 1958, both Hendricks and Oliver had quit, returning only for a week&#x27;s appearance at the Apollo Theater. During that week, one of the members got into a fight with the master of ceremonies for the Apollo Theatre&#x27;s Amateur Night, Ralph Cooper. This was considered the last straw for Treadwell, who fired the entire group. After the argument with Cooper, Treadwell hired a group called the Five Crowns and renamed them &quot;The Drifters&quot;.

===Bill Pinkney&#x27;s Original Drifters===

Although Treadwell owned the Drifters brand, original members felt they were the real Drifters and were determined to keep the group alive. Bill Pinkney left first. After receiving exclusive and irrevocable ownership of the name/mark &quot;The Original Drifters&quot; in a binding arbitration, he joined with the Thrashers and David Baughan to begin touring as &quot;The Original Drifters&quot;. Several original Drifters came in and out of this group over time, as well as other new artists, but these Drifters never replicated the success of the earlier Drifters group.

Baughan left after a short time. Bobby Lee Hollis joined in 1964 and took over the lead spot. Later that year, Andrew Thrasher left and Jimmy Lewis joined the group. Bobby Hendricks returned, making the group a quintet for a short time, before Lewis&#x27; departure. Andrew Thrasher returned, replacing Hollis. Hollis and Baughan were periodically with the group through the 1960s. In 1968, the group consisted of Pinkney, Gerhart Thrasher, Hollis, and Hendricks.

Pinkney hired the Tears to perform as part of his group on a short tour. The Tears were Benny Andersson, George Wallace, Albert Fortson, and Mark Williams. After the tour, the Tears—without Pinkney—continued to tour as the Original Drifters, but Pinkney successfully sued to stop them from using the name.

Pinkney added Bruce Caesar, Clarence Tex Walker, and Duke Richardson, but the lineup changed rapidly. In 1979, the group was Pinkney, Andrew Lawyer, Chuck Cockerham, Harriel Jackson, and Tony Cook. Their 1995 album &quot;Peace in the Valley&quot; on Blackberry Records credited vocals to Pinkney, Cockerham, Richard Knight Dunbar, (Vernon Young), and Greg Johnson. They appeared on the 2001 PBS special &quot;Doo Wop 51&quot; with Pinkney, Dunbar, Johnson, and Bobby Hendricks. The lineup in the early 2000s was Pinkney, Cockerham, Dunbar, Young, and Ronald Jackson, the son of singer Ruth Brown and Clyde McPhatter.

Pinkney died on July 4, 2007, and his legacy continues via the successfully defended registered federal service mark &quot;Bill Pinkney&#x27;s Original Drifters&quot;. The present Original Drifters lineup is Russell Henry, Chuck Cockerham, Richard Knight Dunbar, and Roger Whitehead.

===The New Drifters===
Treadwell owned the rights to the name &quot;Drifters&quot; and still had a year&#x27;s worth of bookings for the Apollo when he fired the group. In summer 1958, he approached Lover Patterson, the manager of the Five Crowns featuring lead singer Benjamin Earl Nelson—better known by his stage name of Ben E. King—and arranged for them to become the Drifters. The new line-up consisted of King (lead tenor), Charlie Thomas (tenor), Dock Green (baritone), and Elsbeary Hobbs (bass). James &quot;Poppa&quot; Clark was the fifth &quot;Crown&quot;; he was not included due to an alcohol problem, which Treadwell had considered to be a problem with the first group. The group went out on the road to tour for almost a year. Since this new group had no connection to the previous Drifters, they often played to hostile audiences.

When Atlantic decided to send the new Drifters into the studio, Ertegun and Wexler were too busy to produce the sessions, so they hired Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, who had been successful producing the Coasters. With Leiber and Stoller producing, this new lineup—widely considered the &quot;true&quot; golden age of the group—released several singles with King on lead that became chart hits. &quot;There Goes My Baby&quot;, the first commercial rock-and-roll recording to include a string orchestra, was a top-10 hit, and number 193 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. &quot;Dance with Me&quot; followed and then &quot;This Magic Moment&quot; (number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1960). &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me&quot; reached number one on the U.S. pop charts and number two in the UK. It was followed by &quot;I Count the Tears&quot;. This version of the Drifters was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2000 as Ben E. King and the Drifters. The write-up indicates an award primarily as a tribute to Ben E. King with a nod to his time in the Drifters, only one of five paragraphs being exclusively devoted to the Drifters, although Charlie Thomas was also cited by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame&#x27;s induction of the original Drifters, which technically was only through 1958).

With this brief golden age lasting two years, personnel changes followed. Lover Patterson (the Drifters&#x27; road manager) got into an argument with George Treadwell. Since Patterson had King under contract, he refused to let him tour with the group. King was only able to record with the group for about a year. Johnny Lee Williams, who sang lead on &quot;(If You Cry) True Love, True Love&quot;, the B-side of &quot;Dance with Me&quot;, handled the vocals on tour along with Charlie Thomas. When the group passed through Williams&#x27; hometown of Mobile, Alabama, Williams left the group. Williams died on December 19, 2004, at the age of 64.

When King asked Treadwell for a raise and a share of royalties, a request that was not honored, he left and began a successful solo career. Williams left at the same time, and a new lead, Rudy Lewis, (of The Clara Ward Singers), was hired. Lewis led the Drifters on hits such as &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot;, &quot;Please Stay&quot;, &quot;Up on the Roof&quot; (which reached number five on the U.S. pop singles chart and number four on the U.S. R&amp;B singles chart in 1963), and &quot;On Broadway&quot; (which reached number 9 on the U.S. pop singles chart and number seven on the U.S. R&amp;B singles chart in 1963). Lewis was also named in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Drifters induction. Ben E. King died on April 30, 2015, at the age of 76.

Hobbs was drafted for military service and replaced by the returning Tommy Evans (from the first group). Green left in 1962 and was replaced by Eugene Pearson (of The Rivileers and The Cleftones). Evans left again in 1963 and was replaced by Johnny Terry, who had been an original member of James Brown&#x27;s singing group, The Famous Flames (and was co-writer of their first hit, &quot;Please, Please, Please&quot;). After his military service and a failed solo career, Johnny Moore returned in 1964, making the group a quintet of Moore, Thomas, Lewis, Pearson, and Terry.

Later that year, the group was scheduled to record &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot; on May 21, but Rudy Lewis died on the night before the session, and Johnny Moore took over as the sole lead (Lewis and he had been alternating). &quot;Under The Boardwalk&quot; was a top 10 hit in the US, but the pace of the Drifters&#x27; chart career slowed after this, with &quot;Saturday Night At The Movies&quot; being the group&#x27;s last US top 40 hit in 1964. The Drifters released several minor hits between 1964 and 1967 that made the US top 100, but didn&#x27;t break through beyond that. By mid-1968, their singles were not charting at all, anywhere -- and they would never have any kind of pop hit in the US again.

Turnover remained frequent. Terry was replaced in 1966 by Dan Dandridge for a few months, then by William Brent, who had been with Johnny Moore in the Hornets in 1954. Gene Pearson was replaced by Rick Sheppard during the same year. By late 1966, baritone/bass Bill Fredericks had replaced William Brent. Charlie Thomas, the group&#x27;s last member from the Five Crowns, left in mid-1967 and was replaced by Charles Baskerville, a former member of The Limelites. Baskerville stayed only a short time.

In May, 1967, George Treadwell died unexpectedly at age 48. His widow, Faye Treadwell, bought out George Treadwell&#x27;s partners&#x27; ownership stakes in The Drifters and took ownership of the group. In 1972, the Drifters left the Atlantic roster.

===Post-Atlantic career===
In 1972, as a by-product of the Northern Soul scene, the group had three big chart hits in the UK with reissued material from the mid-1960s: &quot;Saturday Night At The Movies&quot;, &quot;At The Club&quot;, and &quot;Come On Over To My Place&quot;. None were previously hits in the UK (though they had all been hits in the US), and all went top 10.

The Drifters, their career rejuvenated, moved to England and continued with several different vocalists. New material was written and overseen by songwriter/producer (and long-term Drifters fan) Roger Greenaway, usually working in conjunction with other partners. The group issued four albums between 1973 and 1976, and became a major UK chart act, scoring 9 top 40 hits in that same timespan. The hits started with 1973&#x27;s &quot;Like Sister and Brother&quot; (lead vocal by Fredericks), and included a string of extremely popular numbers sung by Moore, including &quot;Kissin&#x27; in the Back Row of the Movies&quot; (a #2 hit in 1974), &quot;There Goes My First Love&quot; (which hit #3), and &quot;You&#x27;re More Than a Number in My Little Red Book&quot; (which peaked at #5). In America, only &quot;Kissin&#x27; in the Back Row of the Movies&quot; made any chart impression, reaching #83 on the R&amp;B charts.

The Drifters had their last hit in 1976, &quot;You&#x27;re More Than a Number in My Little Red Book&quot;. While The Drifters kept recording, they never released another chart hit in the UK or the US.

Personnel turnover remained frequent. Butch Leake and Grant Kitchings of The Ink Spots replaced Sheppard and Thomas in 1973. Fredericks was replaced by Clyde Brown during the next year, and Kitchings by Billy Lewis the year after. Leake was replaced by Joe Blunt in 1976, making the lineup Johnny Moore, Clyde Brown, Joe Blunt, and Billy Lewis. Faye Treadwell renamed the group&#x27;s management company Treadwell Drifters Inc.

Moore left in 1978 and was replaced by Ray Lewis. Blunt and Billy Lewis left in 1979 and were replaced by the returning Johnny Moore and former Temptations lead Louis Price. Moore left again in late 1982, along with Clyde Brown. They were replaced by two returning members, Ben E. King and Bill Fredericks.

Fredericks, Lewis, and Price all left in 1983 and were replaced by the returning Johnny Moore, Joe Blunt, and Clyde Brown. In 1986, the group split up, and a new lineup was constructed by Treadwell, consisting of new member Jonah Ellis and former members Ray Lewis, Billy Lewis, and Louis Price. During the next year, more former members came in as replacements, making the group Moore, Billy and Ray Lewis, and Gene Jenkins (replaced shortly after by George Chandler, then John Thurston). Ray Lewis was out in 1988 and was replaced by Joe Cofie. In 1989, Billy Lewis left and was replaced by the returning George Chandler, then Tony Jackson, Keith John, and Peter Lamarr in 1990.

Thurston was out at the end of the year and was replaced by Roy Hemmings. Patrick Alan was in for Peter Lamarr briefly before Lamarr left in 1991 and was permanently replaced by Rohan Delano Turney. Johnny Stewart joined the group in 1963 and left in 1993 in Las Vegas. He joined The Platters and continued his singing career. This lineup lasted until 1996, when Cofie was out and Jason Leigh was in. Leigh was replaced after two years by the returning Lamarr. Leigh returned on the next tour and Lamarr was replaced by the returning Patrick Alan.

On December 30, 1998, the group&#x27;s longest-serving member, Johnny Moore, died in London. Patrick Alan returned to the group, keeping it a quartet.

In 2001, Faye Treadwell left the United Kingdom and apparently abandoned the Treadwell Drifters franchise, although in January 2000, a US court had overturned a 1999 jury verdict declaring that it was abandoned. Two members of her company, Mark Lundquist and Phil Lunderman, started a new management company, Drifters UK Limited, to run the group. Their new duties included stopping a trademark by a UK group calling themselves American Drifters. Lamarr left again in 2003 and was replaced by Victor Bynoe. Hemmings left in 2004 and was replaced by Peter Lamarr. The group&#x27;s lineup as of 2007 was Peter Lamarr, Rohan Delano Turney, Patrick Alan, and Victor Bynoe. On June 20, 2007, this lineup performed at Prime Minister Tony Blair&#x27;s Farewell Party in London. In 2008, Faye Treadwell&#x27;s daughter, Tina Treadwell, won a case in a UK court establishing her ownership of the Treadwell Drifters franchise, so this lineup lost the right to use the Drifters name.

===Litigation===
In 1969, magazine editor Larry Marshak planned a series of concerts by the Drifters and other classic vocal groups. He found Dock Green, Charlie Thomas, and Elsbeary Hobbs, and began to promote them as &quot;the Drifters&quot;. This brought swift legal action from Faye Treadwell, wife of George Treadwell, who was managing the Drifters. In an attempt to grant his group the sole rights to the name, Marshak convinced Hobbs, Thomas, and Green to apply for a trademark on the Drifters name in 1976. The trademark was granted, but due to Treadwell&#x27;s legal action, it was revoked in 2000 in U.S. federal court. The trio of original Drifters split afterward into separate groups. The Truth in Music Advertising laws were legislated in 35 of the 50 US states from 2005 to 2020 to stop promoters such as Marshak from assembling new groups of musicians and marketing them as well-known groups such as the Drifters.

In December 2006, writs were served in the London high court by Tina Treadwell, daughter of George and Faye, against Mark Lundquist and Philip Luderman&#x27;s Drifters UK Ltd, alleging they are not the rightful controllers of the Drifters.

In July 2008, The Treadwell family and Prism Music Group Ltd won their legal battle. The court order prohibited Phil Luderman, Mark Lundquist, Rohan Delano Turney, Peter Lamarr, Patrick Alan, or Victor Bynoe from using the Drifters name.

Ownership of the Drifters name continues with the Treadwell family in the form of George Treadwell&#x27;s daughter, Tina, and the UK-based company Prism Music Group Ltd. The line-up features Michael Williams, Pierre Herelle, Ryan King, and Carlton Powell.

The Drifters lineup performed at the London IndigoO2 Arena in 2009 with special guests the Drifter Legends, made up of some of the most prestigious former members of the group. Lifetime achievement awards were presented at this concert to Joe Blunt and Butch Leake by Neil Martin from Sony Music and songwriter Roger Greenway. In 2012, gold discs (100,000 units sold of &quot;Up on the Roof, The Very Best Of&quot;) were awarded by Sony Music to Butch Leake, Joe Blunt, and Clyde Brown.

This is the only lineup, with the exception of Johnny Moore, to have recorded on both of the group&#x27;s former labels, having recorded new material on Atlantic/Warner in 2009 and on Sony Music in 2011.

==Splinter groups==
Dock Green led his group, the Drifters featuring Dock Green, throughout the 1970s and 1980s. That group consisted of Green (lead/baritone), Derek Ventura (lead/tenor), Lloyd Butch Phillips (second tenor), and Bernard Jones (bass/baritone). Green died on March 10, 1989; Phillips died in 2002.

Ray Lewis and Roy Hemmings have led a Drifters group. Bobby Hendricks led a group, as did Billy Lewis. Don Thomas leads a group, Don Thomas and the Drifters Review. In addition, Ronn McPhatter, son of Clyde McPhatter, leads a group called Clyde McPhatter&#x27;s Drifters.

Aside from the official post-2008 lineup, Treadwell managed a second group, The Drifters Legends, composed of former members Rick Sheppard, Butch Leake, Joe Blunt, and Clyde Brown. Faye Treadwell died of breast cancer at the age of 84 on May 22, 2011.

==Awards==
The Vocal Group Hall of Fame has inducted both &quot;The Original Drifters&quot; (1998) and &quot;Ben E. King and the Drifters&quot; (2000). In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the Drifters number 81 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 1988, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted the Drifters; naming members Clyde McPhatter, Bill Pinkney, Gerhart Thrasher, Johnny Moore, Ben E. King, Charlie Thomas, and Rudy Lewis. Bill Pinkney, Charlie Thomas, and Johnny Moore (posthumously) received Pioneer Awards from the Rhythm &amp; Blues Foundation in 1999. The Songwriters Hall of Fame include The Drifters among their Songwriters Friends, the artists who popularized the songs written by inductees. Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame 2018.

==Soundtracks==
Even after their last golden age in the late 70s, The Drifters still make themselves known in 1990s cinema. US pop culture today still recognizes famous tracks like &quot;There Goes My Baby&quot; and &quot;This Magic Moment&quot; 34 years later in the movie &quot;The Sandlot&quot; released in 1993. This familiar 90s classic invites the present and future generations to fully understand the appreciation for Ben E. King&#x27;s timeless voice. To put the icing on the cake, &quot;White Christmas&quot;, has made itself a staple in &quot;Home Alone&quot;, &quot;The Santa Clause&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Home for Christmas.&quot; Recent research by Forbes magazine announced that in 2023, &quot;Home Alone&quot; was played approximately 7.1 million times.

<doc id="164419" wikidata="Q1386011" url="?curid=164419" title="Chesty Puller">
<text>Lewis Burwell &quot;Chesty&quot; Puller (June 26, 1898 – October 11, 1971) was a United States Marine Corps officer. Beginning his career fighting guerillas in Haiti and Nicaragua as part of the Banana Wars, he later served with distinction in World War II and the Korean War as a senior officer. By the time of his retirement in 1955, he had reached the rank of lieutenant general.

Puller is the most decorated Marine in American history. He was awarded five Navy Crosses and one Distinguished Service Cross. With six crosses, Puller is second behind Eddie Rickenbacker for citations of the nation&#x27;s second-highest military award for valor. Puller retired from the Marine Corps in 1955, after 37 years of service. He lived in Virginia and died in 1971 at age 73.

==Early life==
Puller was born in West Point, Virginia, to Matthew and Martha Puller. Puller was of English ancestry; his ancestors who came to America emigrated to the colony of Virginia from Bedfordshire, England in 1621. His father was a grocer who died when Puller was 10 years old. Puller grew up listening to old veterans&#x27; tales of the American Civil War and idolizing Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson. He wanted to enlist in the United States Army to fight in the Border War with Mexico in 1916, but he was too young and could not get parental consent from his mother.

The following year, Puller attended the Virginia Military Institute but left in August 1918 as World War I was still ongoing, saying that he wanted to &quot;go where the guns are!&quot; Inspired by the 5th Marines at Belleau Wood, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps as a private and attended boot camp at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, Parris Island, South Carolina. Although he never saw action in that war, the Marine Corps was expanding, and soon after graduating he attended its non-commissioned officer school and Officer Candidates School (OCS) at Quantico, Virginia. Graduating from OCS on June 16, 1919, Puller was appointed second lieutenant in the reserves, but the reduction in force from 73,000 to 1,100 officers and 27,400 men following the war led to his being put on inactive status 10 days later and given the rank of corporal.

==Interwar years==
===United States occupation of Haiti===
Corporal Puller received orders to serve in the &quot;Gendarmerie d&#x27;Haiti&quot; as a lieutenant, seeing action in Haiti. While the United States was working under a treaty with Haiti, he participated in over forty engagements during the ensuing five years against the Caco rebels and attempted to regain his commission as an officer twice. In 1922, he served as an adjutant to Major Alexander Vandegrift, a future Commandant of the Marine Corps.

====Supply run====
Puller received orders to deliver supplies to Mirebalais and Lascahobas. These two small towns were located in a region where there was a significant presence of Caco guerrillas under the command of Benoît Batraville, who was a high ranking insurgent leader. Puller&#x27;s supply party consisted of twenty-five mounted Haitian Gendarmes along with the pack animals. Puller kept his force moving rapidly to avoid risking an ambush or night attack by the Caco.

Later on, the small force of Gendarmes led by Puller ran into an equally surprised column of about one hundred Cacos coming from the opposite direction around a bend in the road. Puller ordered a charge and spurred his horse forward to attack the Cacos. The Gendarmes charged beside him and scattered the Cacos, who used guerilla tactics and therefore seldom stood their ground if attacked by a significant force. The Cacos fired a handful of shots at the onrushing American-led Gendarmes and then dispersed to make pursuit more difficult. With the burden of the pack mules, Puller could not pursue the evasive Cacos. After the clash ended, one dead Caco bandit was found.

This skirmish was Puller&#x27;s first engagement in the occupation and showed his adeptness at aggressive action and effective leadership from the front. Puller and his force of Gendarmes reached Mirebalais and delivered the supplies needed by the town. The next day, Puller made a 34-hour round trip to Lascahobas to deliver the final supplies and then returned to Port-au-Prince completing his supply run.

====Ambushing the Cacos====
Puller was assigned a new duty to begin offensive operations against the Cacos. Puller inherited a force of one hundred Gendarmes who were supported unofficially by about the same number of female camp followers. Puller&#x27;s assigned chief assistant was acting Second Lieutenant Augustin B. Brunot, a Haitian who was fluent in English. Other pro-American Haitians added to Puller&#x27;s force were newly commissioned lieutenants Lyautey and Brunot, and a Haitian private named Jean Louis Cermontout, who Puller recruited with the promise of promotion after seeing him return from a successful patrol with the severed heads of two Cacos bandits.

Brunot and Lyautey advised Puller on how to combat the Cacos insurgents. They advised him that daylight patrols had little chance of encountering the Cacos, as they hid during the day, only emerging from hiding to ambush government patrols if they had superior numbers. Chance encounters such as Puller&#x27;s supply run were rare because the Cacos knew the terrain and had good intelligence of constabulary activities. They advised him that the Cacos encamped at night and that night patrols would have a better chance of surprising them. When Puller and his unit, following this advice, patrolled along a ridge-top trail one night, he observed campfires and heard drums nearby. Puller with Lyautey and some Gendarmes went to scout, while Brunot remained with the rest of the Gendarmes. The noise turned out to be a celebration at a Cacos guerrilla encampment. After returning, Puller came up with a plan to ambush the Cacos at dawn.

Puller placed the main body of men in a line facing the bandit camp and sent the smaller crews with three Lewis machine guns to the flank in a position where they covered the enemy rear, setting an L-shaped ambush. After Puller&#x27;s force of Gendarmes got into position, Puller executed the ambush. As Puller had predicted, when the main body of men opened fire at first light, the surprised Cacos bandits fled from the source of immediate danger into the fields of fire of the machine guns, where all seventeen were killed. Dozens of machetes and a large flock of gamecocks were found. Puller and his Gendarmes celebrated their victory and feasted on abandoned supplies while using the game cocks for cockfighting. Puller later participated in more patrols as he gained experience and learned the peculiarities of small wars.

====Further operations against the Cacos, October–November 1919====
Puller would conduct more offensive operations to suppress the Cacos. On October 28, 1919, Puller went on a patrol with Brunot and a mixed force of fifteen American Marines and Gendarmes. They would stay out ten days, at which time another group would relieve them. The unit, using night movements, made contact on October 31 with a small band, killing two of the enemy and capturing four rifles, several machetes, and some swords. On November 1, they arrested three suspected bandits.

====Infiltrating and raiding a Cacos camp, November 4, 1919====
On the afternoon of November 4, 1919, Puller and his men entered a small village of grass shacks ten miles west of Mirebalais. A priest told Brunot that a high ranking Cacos insurgent leader named Dominique Georges had a camp about fifteen miles away. He and his men decided to take this opportunity to kill or capture Dominique Georges. Despite heavy rain, Puller took a small patrol of Marines and Gendarmes out immediately. Puller, Brunot, and Private Cermontout Jean Louis scouted out ahead of the small column during the night when they came upon the remains of a bonfire, indicating a bandit guard post. A Cacos sentry armed with a rifle challenged Puller&#x27;s group. The sentry could not see them clearly as it was very dark and his bonfire had been put out by the rain. Brunot replied in his Haitain accent &quot;Cacos&quot;, at which the guard let them through. Puller, Brunot, and Jean Louis were able to infiltrate the Cacos camp and came upon a clearing with many huts and lean-tos. Puller and Jean Louis took firing positions on the ground after Puller sent Brunot to gather the rest of the patrol to assault the camp. Puller aimed his rifle at a man he later believed was Georges, but waited for the main attack instead of firing. A Caco challenged the two prone figures, so that Puller had to shoot the Caco, starting the battle. The marines and gendarmes rushed forward, but the estimated two hundred Cacos scattered, with Puller and Jean Louis firing as fast as they could at fleeing figures. After the government forces had possession of the camp, they found one dead Caco. Puller&#x27;s patrol took twenty seven rifles, swords, and machetes, and several dozen gamecocks. Among the booty was Georges&#x27; personal rifle, identified by his initials in the stock. Puller and his patrol spent the night at the camp and then withdrew safely to their base at Mirebalais.

====Patrol and raid, November 9, 1919====
On November 9, Puller and Brunot led a patrol of thirty-three Gendarmes. Just before dawn they found a camp and attacked it. This time Puller and his fellow Gendarmes killed ten Cacos and captured two rifles. After the raid of the Cacos camp, they safely withdrew to Mirebalais by a circuitous route and fell into garrison routine for a few days.

====Further patrol operations====
After the successful assassination of Charlemagne Péralte by Herman H. Hanneken in a raid, Benoît Batraville became the next leader of the Cacos. Puller and Brunot each took a part of the company out on a patrol. Brunot spotted a Caco force that turned out to be Batraville&#x27;s, but before Brunot could get his force into position for an attack, the Cacos broke camp and melted away. Puller had better luck, with two Cacos killed and sixteen captured.

====Ending of the fighting in Haiti====
The Cacos rebellion collapsed altogether when a Marine patrol killed Batraville on May 19, 1920. A month later, the last significant Caco leader surrendered. More patrols by the Gendarmes and American Marines in the following year killed a further eighty-five Cacos. Later on in September 1920, Herman H. Hanneken penetrated a Caco camp in disguise, arresting five chiefs while killing another. By June 1921, a government military commander declared the country to be &quot;completely tranquil.&quot;

====Return to the United States====
Puller returned stateside and was finally recommissioned as a second lieutenant on March 6, 1924 (Service No. 03158). After completing assignments at the Marine barracks in Norfolk, Virginia; The Basic School in Quantico, Virginia; and with the 10th Marine Artillery Regiment in Quantico, Virginia, he was assigned to the Marine barracks at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in July 1926 and in San Diego, California, in 1928.

===United States occupation of Nicaragua===
In December 1928, Puller was assigned to the Nicaraguan National Guard detachment, where he was awarded his first Navy Cross for his actions from February 16 to August 19, 1930, when he led &quot;five successive engagements against superior numbers of armed bandit forces.&quot; He returned stateside in July 1931 and completed the year-long Company Officers Course at Fort Benning, Georgia, thereafter returning to Nicaragua from September 20 to October 1, 1932, and was awarded a second Navy Cross. Puller led American Marines and Nicaraguan National Guardsmen into battle against Sandinista rebels in the last major engagement of the Sandino Rebellion near El Sauce on December 26, 1932.

====Patrolling, June 4–6, 1930====
After Puller inherited command of Nicaraguan Guardia Nacional called Company M, he was prepared to conduct operations against the Sandinista rebels, and immediately departed on a patrol. Puller moved eastward for a five-day sweep, but soon received orders to head northeast. The patrol moved by day and camped each night in a village. In the afternoon of June 4, the company was at San Antonio cooking a steer in preparation for a trek into the uninhabited area around Mt. Kilande. After hearing some gunshots to the north, Puller sent thirteen men of the Guardia to investigate a thousand yards beyond the town. The Guardia encountered six rebels who may have been Sandinistas and a firefight occurred. The Guardia killed one rebel while the other five fled. The rebel bandit was armed with a Springfield rifle and Colt revolver. On June 6, the patrol moved toward the village of Los Cedros when it encountered an equally surprised force of Sandinistas who were on top of a brush covered hill that sloped about 175 yards down to the trail. The Sandinistas opened fire on the patrol and the patrol returned fire. Without hesitation, Puller dashed up the rise while yelling for his men to charge. Puller&#x27;s men joined in the attack and fired their weapons while charging the enemy position. Puller and his Guardia were able to avoid being hit by small arms fire and crude improvised grenades thrown by the rebels. The rebels were routed and fled. Puller and his men realized they stumbled onto an insurgent camp. Seven dead rebel bodies were found and Puller&#x27;s force suffered no casualties. Puller&#x27;s patrol found two rifles, one pistol, and ten machetes. They also found rosters and papers in the rebel camp, which revealed that two of the seven dead rebels were leaders of the group. After that, Puller&#x27;s company returned to Jinotega.

====Further operations, June 12 – July 12, 1930====
Puller departed on a new patrol on June 12. Puller&#x27;s patrol searched fruitlessly and found nothing. Puller and his men arrived back at their base at June 20. At June 24, Puller, William &quot;Ironman&quot; Lee, and their men joined forces with another government patrol of thirty men under the command of Lieutenant M.K. Chenoweth. Together the combined American-Nicaraguan force left Jinotega. At Santa Fe, Puller picked up an additional fifteen Guardias. After patrolling, Puller&#x27;s men had encountered lone bandits on two occasions and killed them both. Puller&#x27;s large group operated for nearly two more weeks, often split into two patrols with one following the other at a distance. The reinforced unit finally returned to base on July 12.

====Attempted ambush against the rebels, further pursuit, and raiding a rebel camp, November 6–27, 1930====
Puller and his Company M went out on a patrol again on November 6, 1930. Puller, Lee, and twenty-one men left Jinetoga to search for the enemy. The patrol picked up a trail of about thirty bandits who were pillaging small ranches near Santa Isabel. Puller&#x27;s patrol caught sight of the enemy at 9:00 a.m. on November 19 pursuing them for three miles, and wounding at least one of them. Puller&#x27;s patrol decided to surprise the bandits. The patrol set up an ambush hiding themselves along a trail when a manager of a local finca spotted them and walked up to them to provide them information on a rebel band. With the ambush compromised by the finca manager, the patrol moved on. Puller&#x27;s patrol reported into Corinto Finca on November 20 for supplies and pack animals, then left on the same day to check out a report of a rebel concentration near Mt. Guapinol. Puller and his patrol struggled through heavy rains, muddy trails, and flooded rivers. On the morning of November 25, the patrol came across a bandit trail. The Guardia under Puller followed this trail and at 10:30 a.m., the point sighted about ten rebels amongst some fallen trees. Puller&#x27;s men opened fire and the enemy fled. Further along the trail, the pursuers came upon the rebel camp which had four buildings with log barricades in front and a hundred-foot cliff in the rear. There were at least forty or so rebels who fought briefly. Then the rebels threw their belongings and three wounded men into the ravine and then clambered down on ropes and ladders, which they pulled down after themselves. By the time some of the Guardia worked their way down into the draw the enemy had disappeared. Puller&#x27;s patrol found two dead bandits and some supplies. Puller was certain that the three wounded bandits who had gone over the cliff had died. Puller&#x27;s force captured documents which showed that one of their previous operations on August 19, 1930, wounded a minor chief of the rebels. After raiding this rebel camp, Puller&#x27;s unit withdrew and returned to Jinotega on November 27 after three weeks of hard patrolling.

====Patrol and raid against the rebels September 20–26, 1932====

Puller discovered a trail which seemed to be used by rebels. Puller, along with Lee, gathered 40 Guardia Nacional members for a raid like patrol against the rebels. Puller, Lee, and the Guardia left on September 20. After traveling a long distance, the patrol came by the northwest from the bank of Auyabal river. On September 26, Puller&#x27;s patrol was ambushed by the rebels. Lee used a Lewis machine gun to keep the enemy pinned down while the Guardia Nacional worked their way up the slope opposite the rebel ambush party. When they gained the crest, they were able to fire directly into the rebel emplacements. Puller&#x27;s men penetrated the center of a rebel encampment, killing at least 16 rebels. Of Puller&#x27;s force, two men were killed and four wounded. In order to obtain medical care for the wounded, Puller immediately withdrew back to Jinotega. During Puller&#x27;s withdrawal, his patrol was ambushed twice, but suffered no more casualties and fought off the ambushers. Puller&#x27;s Guardia killed at least eight more rebels. Puller&#x27;s force arrived back at Jinotega on September 30 after their raid on the rebel encampment.

====Final battle in Nicaragua December 26, 1932====

There were rumors that Sandinista rebels were planning an attack on a ceremony that was going to commemorate the completion of the LeónEl Sauce railway. An expedition of eight American marines and 64 Nicaraguan National Guardsmen led by Puller were sent to El Sauce on the December 26, 1932. As Puller&#x27;s force of American marines and Nicaraguan national guard were traveling some distance in their train to their destination, they were ambushed by the rebels from both sides of the tracks. Puller and William A. Lee quickly with their troops immediately engaged the rebel ambushers. After a firefight of one hour and ten minutes, the Marines and Guardia Nacional were able to drive off the rebels. Puller&#x27;s victorious force had suffered three dead and three wounded for the Guardia Nacional. The rebels suffered thirty one killed and lost 63 live horses to capture by Puller&#x27;s force. The ceremony went on as planned two days later, while Puller and Lee got promoted.

===Aftermath===
After his service in Nicaragua, Puller was assigned to the Marine detachment at the American Legation in Beijing, China, commanding a unit of China Marines. He then went on to serve aboard , a cruiser in the Asiatic Fleet, which was commanded by then-Captain Chester W. Nimitz. Puller returned to the States in June 1936 as an instructor at The Basic School in Philadelphia, where he trained Ben Robertshaw, Pappy Boyington, and Lew Walt.

In May 1939, he returned to the &quot;Augusta&quot; as commander of the on-board Marine detachment, and then back to China, disembarking in Shanghai in May 1940 to serve as the executive officer and commanding officer of 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines (2/4) until August 1941. Major Puller returned to the U.S. on August 28, 1941. After a short leave, he was given command of 1st Battalion, 7th Marines (1/7) of the 1st Marine Division, stationed at New River, North Carolina (later Camp Lejeune).

==World War II==

Early in the Pacific theater, the 7th Marines formed the nucleus of the newly created 3rd Marine Brigade and arrived to defend American Samoa on May 8, 1942. Later they were redeployed from the brigade and on September 4, 1942, they left American Samoa and rejoined the 1st Marine Division at Guadalcanal on September 18, 1942.

Soon after arriving on Guadalcanal, Lt. Col. Puller led his battalion in a fierce action along the Matanikau, in which Puller&#x27;s quick thinking saved three of his companies from annihilation. In the action, these companies were surrounded and cut off by a larger Japanese force. Puller ran to the shore, signaled a United States Navy destroyer, the , and then directed the destroyer to provide fire support while landing craft rescued his Marines from their precarious position. U.S. Coast Guard Signalman First Class Douglas Albert Munro—Officer-in-Charge of the group of landing craft, was killed while providing covering fire from his landing craft for the Marines as they evacuated the beach and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for the action, to date the only Coast Guardsman to receive the decoration. Puller, for his actions, was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with Combat &quot;V&quot;.

Later on Guadalcanal, Puller was awarded his third Navy Cross, in what was later known as the &quot;Battle for Henderson Field&quot;. Puller commanded 1st Battalion, 7th Marines (1/7), one of two American infantry units defending the airfield against a regiment-strength Japanese force. The 3rd Battalion of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 164th Infantry Regiment (3/164) fought alongside the Marines. In a firefight on the night of October 24–25, 1942, lasting about three hours, 1/7 and 3/164 sustained 70 casualties; the Japanese force suffered over 1,400 killed in action, and the Americans held the airfield. He nominated two of his men (one being Sgt. John Basilone) for Medals of Honor. Puller was wounded himself on November 8, 1942, during the Battle of Koli Point, suffering arm and leg wounds during a Japanese attack on his command post. His injuries were serious, requiring surgery, and command of 1/7 was temporarily assigned to Major John E. Weber of 3/7. Puller was released from the hospital and resumed command of his battalion on November 18.

Puller was then made executive officer of the 7th Marine Regiment. While serving in this capacity at the Battle of Cape Gloucester, Puller was awarded his fourth Navy Cross for overall performance of duty between December 26, 1943, and January 19, 1944. During this time, when the battalion commanders of 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines (3/7) and later, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines (3/5), were under heavy machine gun and mortar fire, he expertly reorganized the battalion and led the successful attack against heavily fortified Japanese defensive positions. He was promoted to colonel effective February 1, 1944, and by the end of the month had been named commander of the 1st Marine Regiment. In the summer of 1944, Puller&#x27;s younger brother, Samuel D. Puller, the executive officer of the 4th Marine Regiment, would be killed by an enemy sniper on Guam.

=== Battle of Peleliu ===
In September and October 1944, Puller led the 1st Marine Regiment into the protracted battle on Peleliu, one of the bloodiest battles in Marine Corps history, and received his first of two Legion of Merit awards. The 1st Marines under Puller&#x27;s command lost 1,749 killed and wounded out of approximately 3,000 men, but these losses did not stop Puller from ordering frontal assaults against the well-entrenched enemy. He would come under significant criticism for not asking for reinforcements when both he and his regiment were at the point of exhaustion. When the Corps commander, General Roy Geiger visited Puller&#x27;s command post, he found Puller, shirtless, with a corncob pipe in his mouth and a badly swollen leg that had originally been injured on Guadalcanal but swollen to twice its size. Colonel William Coleman, a member of the corps staff, had the impression that Puller was completely exhausted both mentally and physically. “He was unable to give a very clear picture of what his situation was.” When Geiger asked him if he needed reinforcements and Puller “stated that he was doing alright with what he had.” This was a crucial moment when Puller could have asked for the help that he so badly needed. But like the division commander, General Rupertus, Puller could not bring himself ask for help from U.S. Army units held in reserve. General Robert Cushman believed that while Puller was a great combat leader, his aggressive nature limited his understanding of combat to launching constant attacks, regardless of the circumstances. As a result of the strain on both Puller and his regiment, Geiger ordered Rupertus to pull the all but annihilated 1st Marine Regiment out of the line as they were no longer combat-effective. Within days, the other two regiments would also be withdrawn from the island and replaced by three Army regiments who would also be eventually pulled out. 

=== Return to the U.S. ===
Puller returned to the United States in November 1944, was named executive officer of the Infantry Training Regiment at Camp Lejeune and, two weeks later, commanding officer. After the war, he was made director of the 8th Reserve District at New Orleans, and later commanded the Marine barracks at Pearl Harbor.

==Korean War==


At the outbreak of the Korean War, Puller was once again assigned as commander of the 1st Marine Regiment. He participated in the landing at Inchon on September 15, 1950, and was awarded the Silver Star Medal. For leadership from September 15 through November 2, he was awarded his second Legion of Merit. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross from the U.S. Army for heroism in action from November 29 to December 4, and his fifth Navy Cross for heroism during December 5–10, 1950, at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. It was during that battle that he said the famous line, &quot;We&#x27;ve been looking for the enemy for some time now. We&#x27;ve finally found him. We&#x27;re surrounded. That simplifies things.&quot;

In January 1951, Puller was promoted to brigadier general and was assigned duty as assistant division commander (ADC) of the 1st Marine Division. On February 24, however, his immediate superior, Major General Oliver Prince Smith, was hastily transferred to command IX Corps when its Army commander, Major General Bryant Moore, died. Smith&#x27;s transfer left Puller temporarily in command of the 1st Marine Division until sometime in March. He completed his tour of duty as assistant commander and left for the United States on May 20, 1951. He took command of the 3rd Marine Division at Camp Pendleton in California until January 1952, and then was assistant commander of the division until June 1952. He then took over Troop Training Unit Pacific at Coronado, California. In September 1953, he was promoted to major general.

==Post-Korean War life==
In July 1954, Puller took command of the 2nd Marine Division at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina until February 1955 when he became Deputy Camp Commander. He suffered a stroke, and was retired by the Marine Corps on November 1, 1955, with a promotion to lieutenant general.

His nickname was related to the way his barrel chest stood out due to his aggressive stance, with legends claiming that a steel plate had been inserted by surgeons to treat a battle wound. In a handwritten addition to a typed November 22, 1954, letter to Major Frank C. Sheppard, Puller wrote, &quot;I agree with you 100%. I had done a little soldiering previous to Guadalcanal and had been called a lot of names, but why &#x27;Chesty&#x27;? Especially the steel part??&quot;

==Relations==
Puller&#x27;s son, Lewis Burwell Puller, Jr. (generally known as Lewis Puller), served as a Marine lieutenant in the Vietnam War. While serving with 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines (2/1), Lewis Jr. was severely wounded by a mine explosion, losing both legs and parts of his hands. Lieutenant General Puller broke down sobbing at seeing his son for the first time in the hospital. Lewis Jr. won a 1992 Pulitzer Prize for his autobiography, &quot;Fortunate Son: The Healing of a Vietnam Vet&quot;. He committed suicide in 1994.

Puller was father-in-law to Colonel William H. Dabney, a Virginia Military Institute (VMI) graduate, who was the commanding officer (then Captain) of two heavily reinforced rifle companies of the 3rd Battalion, 26th Marines (3/26) from January 21 to April 14, 1968, in Vietnam. During the entire period, Dabney&#x27;s force stubbornly defended Hill 881 South, a regional outpost vital to the defense of the Khe Sanh Combat Base during the 77-day siege at the Battle of Khe Sanh. Dabney was recommended for the Navy Cross for his actions on Hill 881 South, but his battalion executive officer&#x27;s helicopter carrying the recommendation papers crashed and the papers were lost. It was not until April 15, 2005, that Colonel Dabney received the Navy Cross during an award ceremony at Virginia Military Institute.

Puller was a distant cousin to U.S. Army General George S. Patton.

He was an Episcopalian and parishioner of Christ Church Parish in Saluda and is buried in the historic cemetery there next to his wife, Virginia Montague Evans.

==Decorations and awards==
Puller received the second-highest U.S. military award six times (one of only two persons so honored): five Navy Crosses and one U.S. Army Distinguished Service Cross. He was the second of two U.S. servicemen (after U.S. Navy submarine commander Roy Milton Davenport) to ever receive five Navy Crosses.

Puller&#x27;s military awards include:

===First Navy Cross citation===
Citation:
For distinguished service in the line of his profession while commanding a Nicaraguan National Guard patrol. First Lieutenant Lewis B. Puller, United States Marine Corps, successfully led his forces into five successful engagements against superior numbers of armed bandit forces; namely, at LaVirgen on 16 February 1930, at Los Cedros on 6 June 1930, at Moncotal on 22 July 1930, at Guapinol on 25 July 1930, and at Malacate on 19 August 1930, with the result that the bandits were in each engagement completely routed with losses of nine killed and many wounded. By his intelligent and forceful leadership without thought of his own personal safety, by great physical exertion and by suffering many hardships, Lieutenant Puller surmounted all obstacles and dealt five successive and severe blows against organized banditry in the Republic of Nicaragua.

===Second Navy Cross citation===
Citation:

First Lieutenant Lewis B. Puller, United States Marine Corps (Captain, Guardia Nacional de Nicaragua) performed exceptionally meritorious service in a duty of great responsibility while in command of a Guardia Patrol from 20 September to 1 October 1932. Lieutenant Puller and his command of forty Guardia and Gunnery Sergeant William A. Lee, United States Marine Corps, serving as a First Lieutenant in the Guardia, penetrated the isolated mountainous bandit territory for a distance of from eighty to one hundred miles north of Jinotega, his nearest base. This patrol was ambushed on 26 September 1932, at a point northeast of Mount Kilambe by an insurgent force of one hundred fifty in a well-prepared position armed with not less than seven automatic weapons and various classes of small arms and well-supplied with ammunition. Early in the combat, Gunnery Sergeant Lee, the Second in Command, was seriously wounded and reported as dead. The Guardia immediately behind Lieutenant Puller in the point was killed by the first burst of fire, Lieutenant Puller, with great courage, coolness and display of military judgment, so directed the fire and movement of his men that the enemy were driven first from the high ground on the right of his position, and then by a flanking movement forced from the high ground to the left and finally were scattered in confusion with a loss of ten killed and many wounded by the persistent and well-directed attack of the patrol. The numerous casualties suffered by the enemy and the Guardia losses of two killed and four wounded are indicative of the severity of the enemy resistance. This signal victory in jungle country, with no lines of communication and a hundred miles from any supporting force, was largely due to the indomitable courage and persistence of the patrol commander. Returning with the wounded to Jinotega, the patrol was ambushed twice by superior forces on 30 September. On both of the occasions the enemy was dispersed with severe losses.

===Third Navy Cross citation===
Citation:

For extraordinary heroism as Commanding Officer of the First Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division, during the action against enemy Japanese forces on Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, on the night of 24 to 25 October 1942. While Lieutenant Colonel Puller&#x27;s battalion was holding a mile-long front in a heavy downpour of rain, a Japanese force, superior in number, launched a vigorous assault against that position of the line which passed through a dense jungle. Courageously withstanding the enemy&#x27;s desperate and determined attacks, Lieutenant Colonel Puller not only held his battalion to its position until reinforcements arrived three hours later, but also effectively commanded the augmented force until late in the afternoon of the next day. By his tireless devotion to duty and cool judgment under fire, he prevented a hostile penetration of our lines and was largely responsible for the successful defense of the sector assigned to his troops.

===Fourth Navy Cross citation===
Citation:

For extraordinary heroism as Executive Officer of the Seventh Marines, First Marine Division, serving with the Sixth United States Army, in combat against enemy Japanese forces at Cape Gloucester, New Britain, from 26 December 1943 to 19 January 1944. Assigned temporary command of the Third Battalion, Seventh Marines, from 4 to 9 January, Lieutenant Colonel Puller quickly reorganized and advanced his unit, effecting the seizure of the objective without delay. Assuming additional duty in command of the Third Battalion, Fifth Marines, from 7 to 8 January, after the commanding officer and executive officer had been wounded, Lieutenant Colonel Puller unhesitatingly exposed himself to rifle, machine-gun and mortar fire from strongly entrenched Japanese positions to move from company to company in his front lines, reorganizing and maintaining a critical position along a fire-swept ridge. His forceful leadership and gallant fighting spirit under the most hazardous conditions were contributing factors in the defeat of the enemy during this campaign and in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

===Fifth Navy Cross citation===
Citation

For extraordinary heroism as Commanding Officer of the First Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against aggressor forces in the vicinity of Koto-ri, Korea, from 5 to 10 December 1950. Fighting continuously in sub-zero weather against a vastly outnumbering hostile force, Colonel Puller drove off repeated and fanatical enemy attacks upon his Regimental defense sector and supply points. Although the area was frequently covered by grazing machine-gun fire and intense artillery and mortar fire, he coolly moved along his troops to insure their correct tactical employment, reinforced the lines as the situation demanded, and successfully defended the perimeter, keeping open the main supply routes for the movement of the Division. During the attack from Koto-ri to Hungnam, he expertly utilized his Regiment as the Division rear guard, repelling two fierce enemy assaults which severely threatened the security of the unit, and personally supervised the care and prompt evacuation of all casualties. By his unflagging determination, he served to inspire his men to heroic efforts in defense of their positions and assured the safety of much valuable equipment which would otherwise have been lost to the enemy. His skilled leadership, superb courage and valiant devotion to duty in the face of overwhelming odds reflect the highest credit upon Colonel Puller and the United States Naval Service.

===Distinguished Service Cross citation===

* In 2012, Military Sealift Command announced that a Mobile Landing Platform will be named after Puller, .

==Death and legacy==

Following his retirement Puller lived in Saluda, Virginia, where he was later buried after his death on October 11, 1971, at Christ Church Cemetery next to his wife.

Puller remains a well-known figure in U.S. Marine Corps folklore with both true and exaggerated tales of his experiences being constantly recounted among U.S. Marines.

A common practice in U.S. Marine Corps boot camp is to end one&#x27;s day with the declaration, &quot;Good night, Chesty, wherever you are!&quot; Another common encouragement is &quot;Chesty Puller never quit!&quot;

In U.S. Marine Corps recruit training and OCS cadences, Marines chant &quot;It was good for Chesty Puller/And it&#x27;s good enough for me&quot; as well as &quot;Tell Chesty Puller I did my best.&quot;—Chesty is symbolic of the &quot;esprit de corps&quot; of the Marines.
Also, the recruits sing &quot;Chesty Puller was a good Marine and a good Marine was he.&quot;

U.S. Marines, while doing pull-ups, will tell each other to &quot;do one for Chesty!&quot;

Puller insisted upon good equipment and discipline; once he came upon a second lieutenant who had ordered an enlisted man to salute him 100 times for missing a salute. Puller told the lieutenant, &quot;You were absolutely correct in making him salute you 100 times, Lieutenant, but you know that an officer must return every salute he receives. Now return them all and I will keep count.&quot;

While on duty in Hawaii and inspecting the armory, Puller fined himself $100 for accidentally discharging a .45 caliber pistol indoors, although the charge for his men was only $20.

A section of Virginia Highway 33 running from West Point to the Gloucester County community of Glenns is named Lewis B Puller Memorial Highway.

Puller was also a life-long freemason. He was made a master mason at Hiram Lodge Number 57 in Virginia, where he was a member until his death.

<text>Jean-Henri Casimir Fabre (; 21 December 1823 – 11 October 1915) was a French naturalist, entomologist, and author known for the lively style of his popular books on the lives of insects.

==Biography==
Fabre was born on 21 December 1823 in Saint-Léons in Aveyron, France.
Fabre was largely an autodidact, owing to the poverty of his family. Nevertheless, he acquired a primary teaching certificate at the age of 19 and began teaching in Carpentras whilst pursuing further studies. In 1849, he was appointed to a teaching post in Ajaccio (Corsica), then in 1853 moved on to the lycée in Avignon.
Fabre was a popular teacher, physicist, chemist and botanist. However, he is probably best known for his findings in the field of entomology, the study of insects, and is considered by many to be the father of modern entomology. Much of his enduring popularity is due to his marvellous teaching ability and his manner of writing about the lives of insects in biographical form, which he preferred to a clinically detached, journalistic mode of recording. In doing so he combined what he called &quot;my passion for scientific truth&quot; with keen observations and an engaging, colloquial style of writing. Fabre (translated) wrote:

His &quot;Souvenirs Entomologiques&quot; is a series of texts on insects and arachnids. He influenced the later writings of Charles Darwin, who called Fabre &quot;an inimitable observer&quot;. Fabre, however, was a Christian who remained sceptical about Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution, as he always held back from all theories and systems. His special force was exact and detailed observation, field research, always avoiding general conclusions from his observations, which he considered premature.

In one of Fabre&#x27;s most famous experiments, he arranged pine processionary caterpillars to form a continuous loop around the edge of a pot. As each caterpillar instinctively followed the silken trail of the caterpillars in front of it, the group moved around in a circle for seven days. He further was able to forecast low atmospheric pressure events by observing the behaviours of the caterpillars.

He died on 11 October 1915. 
In the English speaking world, he became known through the extensive translations of his work by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos, carried out from 1912 to 1922.

==Legacy==
The site of his birth, at St Léons, near Millau is now the site of Micropolis, a tourist attraction dedicated to popularising entomology and a museum on his life.

His last home and office, the Harmas de Fabre in Provence is similarly a museum devoted to his life and work. His insect collection is preserved in the Musée Requien in Avignon. 

The French post office commemorated Fabre in 1956 with a stamp depicting a portrait of him.

The 1951 biographical film &quot;Monsieur Fabre&quot; is devoted to his life.

&quot;Blood of the Mantis&quot;, a 2009 fantasy novel by the British author Adrian Tchaikovsky is dedicated to Fabre.

Fabre appears as the only major human character in a Caper story parody set on his property in Matthew Bennardo&#x27;s short story &quot;The Famous Fabre Fly Caper&quot;.

<text>Johnnie Clyde Johnson (July 8, 1924 – April 13, 2005) was an American pianist who played jazz, blues, and rock and roll. His work with Chuck Berry led to his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for breaking racial barriers in the military as a Montford Point Marine, where he endured racism and inspired social change while integrating the previously all-white Marine Corps during World War II.

==Career==
Johnson was born in Fairmont, West Virginia, United States. He began playing the piano in 1928. During World War II, he joined the United States Marine Corps and became a member of Bobby Troup&#x27;s all-serviceman jazz orchestra: the Barracudas. After his service, Johnson moved to Detroit and then Chicago, where he sat in with many notable artists, including Muddy Waters and Little Walter.

Johnson moved to St. Louis, Missouri in 1952; he immediately assembled a jazz and blues group called the Sir John Trio with the drummer Ebby Hardy and the saxophonist Alvin Bennett. The three had a regular engagement at the Cosmopolitan Club in East St. Louis. On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1952, Bennett suffered a stroke and could not perform. While searching for a last-minute replacement, Johnson called a young man named Chuck Berry. Berry was the only musician he knew who, because of his inexperience, would likely not be playing on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Although Berry was hired as a limited guitarist, he added vocals and showmanship to the group and soon became a permanent member of the trio.

Berry took one of their tunes, a reworking of Bob Wills&#x27;s version of &quot;Ida Red&quot;, to Chess Records in 1955. The Chess brothers liked the song. Soon, the trio were in Chicago recording &quot;Maybellene&quot; and &quot;Wee Wee Hours&quot; – a song Johnson played as an instrumental for years before Berry wrote some accompanying lyrics. The same year, &quot;Maybellene&quot; got Berry and Johnson onto the Billboard charts. Berry was soon signed as a solo act while Johnson and Hardy became part of Berry&#x27;s band. &quot;I figured we could get better jobs with Chuck running the band,&quot; said Johnson. &quot;He had a car and rubber wheels beat rubber heels any day.&quot;

Over the next twenty years, the two collaborated on many of Berry&#x27;s songs, including &quot;School Days&quot;, &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot;, &quot;Carol&quot;, and &quot;Nadine&quot;. The song &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; was reportedly a tribute to Johnson&#x27;s behavior when he was drinking.

Berry and Johnson played and toured together on and off, until 1973. Although never on his payroll after 1973, Johnson played occasionally with Berry, until he sued Berry over songwriting credits and royalties.

Johnson was known to have a serious drinking problem. In Berry&#x27;s autobiography, he wrote that he had declared there would be no drinking in the car while the band was on the road. Johnson and his bandmates complied with the request by putting their heads out the window. Johnson denied the story but said he did drink on the road. Johnson quit drinking in 1991, after nearly suffering a stroke on stage with Eric Clapton.

Aside from songwriting and performing with Berry, Johnson made many significant contributions to blues and rock and roll. Johnson was the leader of Albert King&#x27;s rhythm section during King&#x27;s most prolific and musically significant period. Johnson also served as one of the cornerstones of the St. Louis blues scene. In the early and mid 1980s he was a member of The Sounds of The City, with vocalist Larry Thurston, bassist Gus Thornton, and guitarist Tom Maloney. Johnson performed all over St. Louis with Tommy Bankhead, Oliver Sain, and many significant blues artists throughout their lives.

Johnson received little recognition until the Chuck Berry concert documentary, &quot;Hail! Hail! Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, was released in 1987. The experience forged a permanent bond between him, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton, and Steve Jordan. Although Johnson had been supporting himself as a bus driver in St. Louis, the exposure and experience of the film helped him return to headlining.

He recorded his first solo album, &quot;Blue Hand Johnnie&quot;, that year. Having worked steadily in St. Louis, Johnson returned to performing all over the world. He performed with the Kentucky Headhunters on occasion and was featured in both the &quot;Dumas Walker&quot; and &quot;Walk Softly on This Heart of Mine&quot; videos. Eric Clapton hired him as a featured artist for his annual Royal Albert Hall blues shows. Keith Richards employed Johnson in the Xpensive Winos, and Johnson played piano on Richards&#x27; debut solo album, &quot;Talk Is Cheap&quot; (1988). Johnson toured worldwide as a solo artist, and released records produced by Keith Richards, Jimmy Vivino, and Al Kooper. He later performed with Richards, Clapton, Buddy Guy, John Lee Hooker, Bo Diddley, and George Thorogood on Thorogood&#x27;s 1995 live album, &quot;&quot;. In 1996 and 1997, Johnson toured with Bob Weir&#x27;s band, Ratdog, playing 67 shows. In 1997, Johnson, Raymond Cantrell, and Stevie Lee Dodge composed the St. Charles Blues Trio.

In 1998, Johnson told Doug Donnelly of &quot;Monroenews.com&quot; that &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; was a tribute to Johnson himself. &quot;I played no part in nothing of &#x27;Johnny B. Goode,&#x27;&quot; Johnson said. &quot;On other songs, Chuck and I worked together, but not that one. We were playing one night, I think it was Chicago, and he played it. Afterward, he told me it was a tribute to me. He did it on his own. I didn&#x27;t know nothing about it. It was never discussed.&quot;

A biography of Johnson, &quot;Father of Rock and Roll: The Story of Johnnie B. Goode Johnson&quot;, by Travis Fitzpatrick, was published in 1999. The book was entered into the annual Pulitzer Prize competition by Congressman John Conyers and garnered Johnson more recognition.

Johnson received a Pioneer Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in 2000.

Johnson&#x27;s final album, &quot;Johnnie Be Eighty. And Still Bad!&quot;, was recorded in St. Louis in late 2004, consisting of all original songs written with the producer, Jeff Alexander, which was a first for Johnson. The album was released the same week he died in April 2005, and contains the biographical &quot;Beach Weather&quot; and &quot;Lucky Four&quot;.

In 2005, he played piano on Styx&#x27;s re-recording of &quot;Blue Collar Man&quot;, entitled &quot;Blue Collar Man @ 2120&quot;, for their album &quot;Big Bang Theory&quot;. It was recorded at Chess Studios, on the 46th anniversary of the recording of &quot;Johnnie B. Goode&quot; at the same studio.

Johnson died at the age of 80 from a kidney ailment and pneumonia in St. Louis on April 13, 2005. He was interred in the Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery.

==Legacy==
In November 2000, Johnson sued Chuck Berry, alleging he deserved co-composer credits (and royalties) for dozens of songs, including &quot;No Particular Place to Go,&quot; &quot;Sweet Little Sixteen&quot;, and &quot;Roll Over Beethoven,&quot; which credit Berry alone. The case was eventually dismissed, because too many years had passed since the songs in dispute were written.

In 2001, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in the category &quot;Sidemen,&quot; after a campaign by the businessman George Turek, Johnson&#x27;s biographer Travis Fitzpatrick, and the guitarist Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones.

Johnson has a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

Johnson was the subject of a Homespun Tapes piano instructional video, &quot;The Blues/Rock Piano of Johnnie Johnson: Sessions with a Keyboard Legend&quot;. Originally released in 1999 (a DVD was issued in 2005), the video is hosted by David Bennett Cohen, along with Johnson&#x27;s band, featuring guitarist Jimmy Vivino.

The Johnnie Johnson Blues &amp; Jazz Festival is held annually in Fairmont West Virginia, only a few blocks from where Johnson was born.

<text>Ivan Alekseyevich Bunin ( or ; ;  – 8 November 1953) was the first Russian writer awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, in 1933. He was noted for the strict artistry with which he carried on the classical Russian traditions in the writing of prose and poetry. The texture of his poems and stories, sometimes referred to as &quot;Bunin brocade&quot;, is considered to be one of the richest in the language.

Best known for his short novels &quot;The Village&quot; (1910) and &quot;Dry Valley&quot; (1912), his autobiographical novel &quot;The Life of Arseniev&quot; (1933, 1939), the book of short stories &quot;Dark Avenues&quot; (1946) and his 1917–1918 diary (&quot;Cursed Days&quot;, 1926), Bunin was a revered figure among white emigres, European critics, and many of his fellow writers, who viewed him as a true heir to the tradition of realism in Russian literature established by Tolstoy and Chekhov.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Ivan Bunin was born on his parental estate in Voronezh province, the third and youngest son of Aleksey Nikolayevich Bunin (1827–1906) and Lyudmila Aleksandrovna Bunina (née Chubarova, 1835–1910). He had two younger sisters: Masha (Maria Bunina-Laskarzhevskaya, 1873–1930) and Nadya (that latter died very young) and two elder brothers, Yuly and Yevgeny. Having come from a long line of Russian nobility, Bunin was especially proud that poets Anna Bunina (1774–1829) and Vasily Zhukovsky (1783–1852) were among his ancestors. He wrote in his 1952 autobiography: 

&quot;The Bunins are direct ancestors of Simeon Bunkovsky, a nobleman who came from Poland to the court of the Great Prince Vasily Vasilyevich,&quot; he wrote in 1915, quoting the Russian gentry&#x27;s &quot;Armorial Book&quot;. Chubarovs, according to Bunin, &quot;knew very little about themselves except that their ancestors were landowners in Kostromskaya, Moskovskaya, Orlovskya and Tambovskaya Guberniyas&quot;. &quot;As for me, from early childhood I was such a libertine as to be totally indifferent both to my own &#x27;high blood&#x27; and to the loss of whatever might have been connected to it,&quot; he added.

Ivan Bunin&#x27;s early childhood, spent in Butyrky Khutor and later in Ozerky (of Yelets county, Lipetskaya Oblast), was a happy one: the boy was surrounded by intelligent and loving people. Father Alexei Nikolayevich was described by Bunin as a very strong man, both physically and mentally, quick-tempered and addicted to gambling, impulsive and generous, eloquent in a theatrical fashion and totally illogical. &quot;Before the Crimean War he&#x27;d never even known the taste of wine, on return he became a heavy drinker, although never a typical alcoholic,&quot; he wrote. His mother Lyudmila Alexandrovna&#x27;s character was much more subtle and tender: this Bunin attributed to the fact that &quot;her father spent years in Warsaw where he acquired certain European tastes which made him quite different from fellow local land-owners.&quot; It was Lyudmila Alexandrovna who introduced her son to the world of Russian folklore. Elder brothers Yuly and Yevgeny showed great interest in mathematics and painting respectively, his mother said later, yet, in their mother&#x27;s words, &quot;Vanya has been different from the moment of birth... none of the others had a soul like his.&quot;

Young Bunin&#x27;s susceptibility and keenness to the nuances of nature were extraordinary. &quot;The quality of my vision was such that I&#x27;ve seen all seven of the stars of the Pleiades, heard a marmot&#x27;s whistle a verst away, and could get drunk from the smells of a lily of the valley or an old book,&quot; he remembered later. Bunin&#x27;s experiences of rural life had a profound impact on his writing. &quot;There, amidst the deep silence of vast fields, among cornfields – or, in winter, huge snowdrifts which were stepping up to our very doorsteps – I spent my childhood which was full of melancholic poetry,&quot; Bunin later wrote of his Ozerky days.

Ivan Bunin&#x27;s first home tutor was an ex-student named Romashkov, whom he later described as a &quot;positively bizarre character,&quot; a wanderer full of fascinating stories, &quot;always thought-provoking even if not altogether comprehensible.&quot; Later it was university-educated Yuly Bunin (deported home for being a Narodnik activist) who taught his younger brother psychology, philosophy and the social sciences as part of his private, domestic education. It was Yuly who encouraged Ivan to read the Russian classics and to write himself. Until 1920 Yuly (who once described Ivan as &quot;undeveloped yet gifted and capable of original independent thought&quot;) was the latter&#x27;s closest friend and mentor. &quot;I had a passion for painting, which, I think, shows in my writings. I wrote both poetry and prose fairly early and my works were also published from an early date,&quot; wrote Bunin in his short autobiography.

By the end of the 1870s, the Bunins, plagued by the gambling habits of the head of the family, had lost most of their wealth. In 1881 Ivan was sent to a public school in Yelets, but never completed the course: he was expelled in March 1886 for failing to return to the school after the Christmas holidays due to the family&#x27;s financial difficulties.

=== Literary career ===
In May 1887 Bunin published his first poem &quot;Village Paupers&quot; (Деревенские нищие) in the Saint Petersburg literary magazine &quot;Rodina&quot; (Motherland). In 1891 his first short story &quot;Country Sketch (Деревенский эскиз) appeared in the Nikolay Mikhaylovsky-edited journal &quot;Russkoye Bogatstvo&quot;. In Spring 1889, Bunin followed his brother to Kharkiv, where he became a government clerk, then an assistant editor of a local paper, librarian, and court statistician. In January 1889 he moved to Oryol to work on the local &quot;Orlovsky Vestnik&quot; newspaper, first as an editorial assistant and later as de facto editor; this enabled him to publish his short stories, poems and reviews in the paper&#x27;s literary section. There he met Varvara Pashchenko and fell passionately in love with her. In August 1892 the couple moved to Poltava and settled in the home of Yuly Bunin. The latter helped his younger brother to find a job in the local zemstvo administration.

Ivan Bunin&#x27;s debut book of poetry &quot;Poems. 1887–1891&quot; was published in 1891 in Oryol. Some of his articles, essays and short stories, published earlier in local papers, began to feature in the Saint Petersburg periodicals.

Bunin spent the first half of 1894 travelling all over Ukraine. &quot;Those were the times when I fell in love with Malorossiya (Little Russia), its villages and steppes, was eagerly meeting its people and listening to Ukrainian songs, this country&#x27;s very soul,&quot; he later wrote.

In 1895 Bunin visited the Russian capital for the first time. There he was to meet the Narodniks Nikolay Mikhaylovsky and Sergey Krivenko, Anton Chekhov (with whom he began a correspondence and became close friends), Alexander Ertel, and the poets Konstantin Balmont and Valery Bryusov. 1899 saw the beginning of Bunin&#x27;s friendship with Maxim Gorky, to whom he dedicated his &quot;Falling Leaves&quot; (1901) collection of poetry and whom he later visited at Capri. Bunin became involved with Gorky&#x27;s Znanie (Knowledge) group. Another influence and inspiration was Leo Tolstoy whom he met in Moscow in January 1894. Admittedly infatuated with the latter&#x27;s prose, Bunin tried desperately to follow the great man&#x27;s lifestyle too, visiting sectarian settlements and doing a lot of hard work. He was even sentenced to three months in prison for illegally distributing Tolstoyan literature in the autumn of 1894, but avoided jail due to a general amnesty proclaimed on the occasion of the succession to the throne of Nicholas II. Tellingly, it was Tolstoy himself who discouraged Bunin from slipping into what he called &quot;total peasantification.&quot; Several years later, while still admiring Tolstoy&#x27;s prose, Bunin changed his views regarding his philosophy which he now saw as utopian.

In 1895–1896 Bunin divided his time between Moscow and Saint Petersburg. In 1897 his first short story collection &quot;To the Edge of the World and Other Stories&quot; came out, followed a year later by &quot;In the Open Air&quot; (Под открытым небом, 1898), his second book of verse. In June 1898 Bunin moved to Odessa. Here he became close to the Southern Russia Painters Comradeship, became friends with Yevgeny Bukovetski and Pyotr Nilus. In the winter of 1899–1900 he began attending the Sreda (Wednesday) literary group in Moscow, striking up a friendship with the Nikolay Teleshov, among others. Here the young writer made himself a reputation as an uncompromising advocate of the realistic traditions of classic Russian literature. &quot;Bunin made everybody uncomfortable. Having got this severe and sharp eye for real art, feeling acutely the power of a word, he was full of hatred towards every kind of artistic excess. In times when (quoting Andrey Bely) &quot;throwing pineapples to the sky&quot; was the order of the day, Bunin&#x27;s very presence made words stick in people&#x27;s throats,&quot; Boris Zaitsev later remembered. He met Anton Chekov in 1896, and a strong friendship ensued.

=== 1900–1909 ===
The collections &quot;Poems and Stories&quot; (1900) and &quot;Flowers of the Field&quot; (1901) were followed by &quot;Falling Leaves&quot; (Листопад, 1901), Bunin&#x27;s third book of poetry (including a large poem of the same title first published in the October 1900 issue of &quot;Zhizn&quot; (Life) magazine). It was welcomed by both critics and colleagues, among them Alexander Ertel, Alexander Blok and Aleksandr Kuprin, who praised its &quot;rare subtlety.&quot; Even though the book testifies to his association with the Symbolists, primarily Valery Bryusov, at the time many saw it as an antidote to the pretentiousness of &#x27;decadent&#x27; poetry which was then popular in Russia. &quot;Falling Leaves&quot; was &quot;definitely Pushkin-like&quot;, full of &quot;inner poise, sophistication, clarity and wholesomeness,&quot; according to critic Korney Chukovsky. Soon after the book&#x27;s release, Gorky called Bunin (in a letter to Valery Bryusov) &quot;the first poet of our times.&quot; It was for &quot;Falling Leaves&quot; (along with the translation of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;, 1898) that Bunin was awarded his first Pushkin Prize. Bunin justified a pause of two years in the early 1900s by the need for &quot;inner growth&quot; and spiritual change.

At the turn of the century Bunin made a major switch from poetry to prose which started to change both in form and texture, becoming richer in lexicon, more compact and perfectly poised. Citing Gustave Flaubert, whose work he admired, as an influence, Bunin was &quot;demonstrating that prose could be driven by poetic rhythms, but still remain prose.&quot; According to the writer&#x27;s nephew Pusheshnikov, Bunin once told him: &quot;Apparently I was born a versemaker... like Turgenev, who was a versemaker, first and foremost. Finding the true rhythm of the story was for him the main thing – everything else was supplementary. And for me the crucial thing is to find the proper rhythm. Once it&#x27;s there, everything else comes in spontaneously, and I know when the story is done.&quot;

In 1900 the novella &quot;Antonov Apples&quot; (Антоновские яблоки) was published; later it was included in textbooks and is regarded as Bunin&#x27;s first real masterpiece, but it was criticised at the time as too nostalgic and elitist, allegedly idealising &quot;the Russian nobleman&#x27;s past.&quot; Other acclaimed novellas of this period, &quot;On the Farm&quot;, &quot;The News from Home&quot;, and &quot;To the Edge of the World&quot; (На край света), showing a penchant for extreme precision of language, delicate description of nature and detailed psychological analysis, made him a popular and well-respected young author.

In 1902 Znanie started publishing the &quot;Complete Bunin&quot; series; five volumes appeared by the year 1909. Three books, &quot;Poems (1903)&quot;, &quot;Poems (1903–1906)&quot; and &quot;Poems of 1907&quot; (the latter published by Znanie in 1908), formed the basis of a special (non-numbered) volume of the &quot;Complete&quot; series which in 1910 was published in Saint Petersburg as &quot;Volume VI. Poems and Stories (1907–1909)&quot; by the Obschestvennaya Polza (Public Benefit) publishing house. Bunin&#x27;s works featured regularly in Znanie&#x27;s literary compilations; beginning with Book I, where &quot;Black Earth&quot; appeared along with several poems, all in all he contributed to 16 books of the series.

In the early 1900s Bunin travelled extensively. He was a close friend of Chekhov and his family and continued visiting them regularly until 1904. The October social turmoil of 1905 found Bunin in Yalta, Crimea, from where he moved back to Odessa. Scenes of &quot;class struggle&quot; there did not impress the writer, for he saw them as little more than the Russian common people&#x27;s craving for anarchy and destruction.
In November 1906 Bunin&#x27;s passionate affair with Vera Muromtseva began. The girl&#x27;s family was unimpressed with Bunin&#x27;s position as a writer, but the couple defied social convention, moving in together and in April 1907 leaving Russia for an extended tour through Egypt and Palestine. The &quot;Bird&#x27;s Shadow&quot; (Тень птицы) (1907–1911) collection (published as a separate book in 1931 in Paris) came as a result of this voyage. These travelling sketches were to change the critics&#x27; assessment of Bunin&#x27;s work. Before them Bunin was mostly regarded as (using his own words) &quot;a melancholy lyricist, singing hymns to noblemen&#x27;s estates and idylls of the past.&quot; In the late 1900s critics started to pay more notice to the colourfulness and dynamics of his poetry and prose. &quot;In terms of artistic precision he has no equal among Russian poets,&quot; &quot;Vestnik Evropy&quot; wrote at the time. Bunin attributed much importance to his travels, counting himself among that special &quot;type of people who tend to feel strongest for alien times and cultures rather than those of their own&quot; and admitting to being drawn to &quot;all the necropolises of the world.&quot; Besides, foreign voyages had, admittedly, an eye-opening effect on the writer, helping him to see Russian reality more objectively. In the early 1910s Bunin produced several famous novellas which came as a direct result of this change in perspective.

In October 1909 Bunin received his second Pushkin Prize for &quot;Poems 1903–1906&quot; and translations of (Lord Byron&#x27;s &quot;Cain&quot;, and parts of Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Legend&quot;). He was elected a member of the Russian Academy the same year. In Bunin, The Academy crowns &quot;not a daring innovator, not an adventurous searcher but arguably the last gifted pupil of talented teachers who&#x27;s kept and preserved... all the most beautiful testaments of their school,&quot; wrote critic Aleksander Izmailov, formulating the conventional view of the time. It was much later that Bunin was proclaimed one of the most innovative Russian writers of the century.

=== 1910–1920 ===

In 1910 Bunin published &quot;The Village&quot; (Деревня), a bleak portrayal of Russian country life, which he depicted as full of stupidity, brutality, and violence. This book caused controversy and made him famous. Its harsh realism (with &quot;characters having sunk so far below the average level of intelligence as to be scarcely human&quot;) prompted Maxim Gorky to call Bunin &quot;the best Russian writer of the day.&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;ve left behind my &quot;narodnicism&quot; which didn&#x27;t last very long, my Tolstoyism too and now I&#x27;m closer to the social democrats, but I still stay away from political parties,&quot; Bunin wrote in the early 1910s. He said he realised now that the working class had become a force powerful enough to &quot;overcome the whole of Western Europe,&quot; but warned against the possible negative effect of the Russian workers&#x27; lack of organisation, the one thing that made them different from their Western counterparts. He criticised the Russian intelligentsia for being ignorant of the common people&#x27;s life, and spoke of a tragic schism between &quot;the cultured people and the uncultured masses.&quot;

In December 1910 Bunin and Muromtseva made another journey to the Middle East, then visited Ceylon; this four-month trip inspired such stories as &quot;Brothers&quot; (&quot;Братья&quot;) and &quot;The Tsar of Tsars City&quot; (&quot;Город царя царей&quot;). On his return to Odessa in April 1911, Bunin wrote &quot;Waters Aplenty&quot; (&quot;Воды многие&quot;), a travel diary, much lauded after its publication in 1926. In 1912 the novel &quot;Dry Valley&quot; (Суходол) came out, his second major piece of semi-autobiographical fiction, concerning the dire state of the Russian rural community. Again it left the literary critics divided: social democrats praised its stark honesty, many others were appalled with the author&#x27;s negativism.

Bunin and Muromtseva spent three winters (1912–1914) with Gorky on the island of Capri, where they met with Fyodor Shalyapin and Leonid Andreev, among others. In Russia the couple divided their time mainly between Moscow and a Bunin family estate at Glotovo village nearby Oryol; it was there that they spent the first couple years of World War I. Dogged by anxieties concerning Russia&#x27;s future, Bunin was still working hard. In the winter of 1914–1915 he finished a new volume of prose and verse entitled &quot;The Chalice of Life&quot; (Чаша жизни), published in early 1915 to wide acclaim (including high praise from the French poet Rene Ghil). The same year saw the publication of &quot;The Gentleman from San Francisco&quot; (Господин из Сан-Франциско), arguably the best-known of Bunin&#x27;s short stories, which was translated into English by D. H. Lawrence. Bunin was a productive translator himself. After Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot; (1898), he did translations of Byron, Tennyson, Musset and François Coppée.

During the war years, Bunin completed the preparation of a six-volume edition of his &quot;Collected Works&quot;, which was published by Adolph Marks in 1915. Throughout this time Bunin kept aloof from contemporary literary debates. &quot;I did not belong to any literary school; I was neither a decadent, nor a symbolist nor a romantic, nor a naturalist. Of literary circles I frequented only a few,&quot; he commented later. By the spring of 1916, overcome by pessimism, Bunin all but stopped writing, complaining to his nephew, N.A. Pusheshnikov, of how insignificant he felt as a writer and how depressed he was for being unable to do more than be horrified at the millions of deaths being caused by the War.

In May 1917 the Bunins moved to Glotovo and stayed there until autumn. In October the couple returned to Moscow to stay with Vera&#x27;s parents. Life in the city was dangerous (residents had to guard their own homes, maintaining nightly vigils) but Bunin still visited publishers and took part in the meetings of the Sreda and The Art circles. While dismissive of Ivan Goremykin (the 1914–1916 Russian Government Premier), he criticised opposition figures like Pavel Milyukov as &quot;false defenders of the Russian people&quot;. In April 1917 he severed all ties with the pro-revolutionary Gorky, causing a rift which would never be healed. On 21 May 1918, Bunin and Muromtseva obtained the official permission to leave Moscow for Kiev, then continued their journey through to Odessa. By 1919 Bunin was working for the Volunteer Army as the editor of the cultural section of the anti-Bolshevik newspaper &quot;Iuzhnoe Slovo&quot;. On 26 January 1920, the couple boarded the last French ship in Odessa and soon were in Constantinople.

=== Emigration ===

On 28 March 1920, after short stints in Sofia and Belgrade, Bunin and Muromtseva arrived in Paris, from then on dividing their time between apartments at 1, rue Jacques Offenbach in the 16th arrondissement of Paris and rented villas in or near Grasse in the Alpes Maritimes. Much as he hated Bolshevism, Bunin never endorsed the idea of foreign intervention in Russia. &quot;It&#x27;s for a common Russian countryman to sort out his problems for himself, not for foreign masters to come and maintain their new order in our home. I&#x27;d rather die in exile than return home with the help of Poland or England. As my father taught me: &#x27;Love your own tub even if it&#x27;s broken up&#x27;&quot;, he once said, allegedly, to Merezhkovsky who still cherished hopes for Pilsudsky&#x27;s military success against the Bolshevik regime.

Slowly and painfully, overcoming physical and mental stress, Bunin returned to his usual mode of writing. &quot;Scream&quot;, his first book published in France, was compiled of short stories written in 1911–1912, years he referred to as the happiest of his life.

In France Bunin published many of his pre-revolutionary works and collections of original novellas, regularly contributing to the Russian emigre press. According to Vera Muromtseva, her husband often complained of his inability to get used to life in the new world. He said he belonged to &quot;the old world, that of Goncharov and Tolstoy, of Moscow and Saint Petersburg, where his muse had been lost, never to be found again.&quot; Yet his new prose was marked with obvious artistic progress: &quot;Mitya&#x27;s Love&quot; (&quot;Митина любовь&quot;, 1924), &quot;Sunstroke&quot; (&quot;Солнечный удаp&quot;, 1925), &quot;Cornet Yelagin&#x27;s Case&quot; (&quot;Дело коpнета Елагина&quot;, 1925) and especially &quot;The Life of Arseniev&quot; (&quot;Жизнь Аpсеньева&quot;, written in 1927–1929, published in 1930–1933) were praised by critics as bringing Russian literature to new heights. Konstantin Paustovsky called &quot;The Life of Arseniev&quot; an apex of the whole of Russian prose and &quot;one of the most striking phenomena in the world of literature.&quot;

In 1924, he published the &quot;Manifesto of the Russian Emigration&quot;, in which he i.a. declared:There was Russia, inhabited by a mighty family, which had been created by the blessed work of countless generations. ... What was then done to them? They paid for the deposal of the ruler with the destruction of literally the whole home and with unheard of fratricide. ... A bastard, a moral idiot from the birth, Lenin presented to the World at the height of his activities something monstrous, staggering, he discorded the largest country of the Earth and killed millions of people, and in the broad day-light it is being disputed: was he a benefactor of the mankind or not?

In 1925–1926 &quot;Cursed Days&quot; (&quot;Окаянные дни&quot;), Bunin&#x27;s diary of the years 1918–1920 started to appear in the Paris-based &quot;Vozrozhdenye&quot; newspaper (its final version was published by Petropolis in 1936). According to Bunin scholar Thomas Gaiton Marullo, &quot;Cursed Days&quot;, one of the very few anti-Bolshevik diaries to be preserved from the time of the Russian Revolution and civil war, linked &quot;Russian anti-utopian writing of the nineteenth century to its counterpart in the twentieth&quot; and, &quot;in its painful exposing of political and social utopias... heralded the anti-utopian writing of George Orwell and Aldous Huxley. Bunin and Zamyatin had correctly understood that the Soviet experiment was destined to self destruct,&quot; Marullo wrote.

In the 1920s and 1930s Bunin was regarded as the moral and artistic spokesman for a generation of expatriates who awaited the collapse of Bolshevism, a revered senior figure among living Russian writers, true to the tradition of Tolstoy and Chekhov. He became the first Russian to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, which was awarded to him in 1933 &quot;for following through and developing with chastity and artfulness the traditions of Russian classic prose.&quot; Per Halstroem, in his celebratory speech, noted the laureate&#x27;s poetic gift. Bunin for his part praised the Swedish Academy for honouring a writer in exile. In his speech, addressing the Academy, he said: 

In France, Bunin found himself, for the first time, at the center of public attention. On 10 November 1933, the Paris newspapers came out with huge headlines: &quot;Bunin — the Nobel Prize laureate&quot; giving the whole of the Russian community in France cause for celebration. &quot;You see, up until then we, émigrés, felt like we were at the bottom there. Then all of a sudden our writer received an internationally acclaimed prize! And not for some political scribblings, but for real prose! After having been asked to write a first page column for the Paris &quot;Revival&quot; newspaper, I stepped out in the middle of the night onto the Place d&#x27;Italie and toured the local bistros on my way home, drinking in each and every one of them to the health of Ivan Bunin!&quot; fellow Russian writer Boris Zaitsev wrote. Back in the USSR the reaction was negative: Bunin&#x27;s triumph was explained there as &quot;an imperialist intrigue.&quot;

Dealing with the Prize, Bunin donated 100,000 francs to a literary charity fund, but the process of money distribution caused controversy among his fellow Russian émigré writers. It was during this time that Bunin&#x27;s relationship deteriorated with Zinaida Gippius and Dmitry Merezhkovsky (a fellow Nobel Prize nominee who once suggested that they divide the Prize between the two, should one of them get it, and had been refused). Although reluctant to become involved in politics, Bunin was now feted as both a writer and the embodiment of non-Bolshevik Russian values and traditions. His travels throughout Europe featured prominently on the front pages of the Russian emigre press for the remainder of the decade.

In 1933 he allowed calligrapher Guido Colucci to create a unique manuscript of &quot;Un crime&quot;, a French translation of one of his novellas, illustrated with three original gouaches by Nicolas Poliakoff.

In 1934–1936, &quot;The Complete Bunin&quot; in 11 volumes was published in Berlin by Petropolis. Bunin cited this edition as the most credible one and warned his future publishers against using any other versions of his work rather than those featured in the Petropolis collection. 1936 was marred by an incident in Lindau on the Swiss-German border when Bunin, having completed his European voyage, was stopped and unceremoniously searched. The writer (who caught cold and fell ill after the night spent under arrest) responded by writing a letter to the Paris-based &quot;Latest News&quot; newspaper. The incident caused disbelief and outrage in France. In 1937 Bunin finished his book &quot;The Liberation of Tolstoy&quot; (&quot;Освобождение Толстого&quot;), held in the highest regard by Leo Tolstoy scholars.

In 1938 Bunin began working on what would later become a celebrated cycle of nostalgic stories with a strong erotic undercurrent and a Proustian ring. The first eleven stories of it came out as &quot;Dark Avenues&quot; (or &quot;Dark Alleys&quot;, Тёмные аллеи) in New York (1943); the cycle appeared in a full version in 1946 in France. These stories assumed a more abstract and metaphysical tone which has been identified with his need to find refuge from the &quot;nightmarish reality&quot; of Nazi occupation. Bunin&#x27;s prose became more introspective, which was attributed to &quot;the fact that a Russian is surrounded by enormous, broad and lasting things: the steppes, the sky. In the West everything is cramped and enclosed, and this automatically produces a turning towards the self, inwards.&quot;&quot;

=== The war years ===

As World War II broke out, Bunin&#x27;s friends in New York, anxious to help the Nobel Prize laureate get out of France, issued officially-endorsed invitations for him to travel to the US, and in 1941 they received their Nansen passports enabling them to make the trip. But the couple chose to remain in Grasse. They spent the war years at Villa Jeanette, high in the mountains. Two young writers became long-term residents in the Bunin household at the time: Leonid Zurov (1902–1971) , who had arrived on a visit from Latvia at Bunin&#x27;s invitation earlier, in late 1929, and remained with them for the rest of their lives, and Nikolai Roshchin (1896–1956), who returned to the Soviet Union after the war.

Members of this small commune (occasionally joined by Galina Kuznetsova and Margarita Stepun) were bent on survival: they grew vegetables and greens, helping one another out at a time when, according to Zurov, &quot;Grasse&#x27;s population had eaten all of their cats and dogs&quot;. A journalist who visited the Villa in 1942 described Bunin as a &quot;skinny and emaciated man, looking like an ancient patrician&quot;. For Bunin, though, this isolation was a blessing and he refused to re-locate to Paris where conditions might have been better. &quot;It takes 30 minutes of climbing to reach our villa, but there&#x27;s not another view in the whole world like the one that&#x27;s facing us,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Freezing cold, though, is damning and making it impossible for me to write,&quot; he complained in one of his letters. Vera Muromtseva-Bunina remembered: &quot;There were five or six of us... and we were all writing continuously. This was the only way for us to bear the unbearable, to overcome hunger, cold and fear.&quot;

Ivan Bunin was a staunch anti-Nazi, referring to Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini as &quot;rabid monkeys&quot;. He risked his life, sheltering fugitives (including Jews such as the pianist A. Liebermann and his wife) in his house in Grasse after Vichy was occupied by the Germans. According to Zurov, Bunin invited some of the Soviet war prisoners (&quot;straight from Gatchina&quot;, who worked in occupied Grasse) to his home in the mountains, when the heavily guarded German forces&#x27; headquarters were only away from his home.

The atmosphere in the neighbourhood, though, was not that deadly, judging by the Bunin&#x27;s diary entry for 1 August 1944: &quot;Nearby there were two guards, there were also one German, and one Russian prisoner, Kolesnikov, a student. The three of us talked a bit. Saying our farewells, a German guard shook my hand firmly&quot;.

Under the occupation Bunin never ceased writing but, according to Zurov, &quot;published not a single word. He was receiving offers to contribute to newspapers in unoccupied Switzerland, but declined them. Somebody visited him once, a guest who proved to be an agent, and proposed some literary work, but again Ivan Alekseyevich refused.&quot; On 24 September 1944, Bunin wrote to Nikolai Roshchin: &quot;Thank God, the Germans fled Grasse without a fight, on August 23. In the early morning of the 24th the Americans came. What was going on in the town, and in our souls, that&#x27;s beyond description.&quot; &quot;For all this hunger, I&#x27;m glad we spent the War years in the South, sharing the life and difficulties of the people, I&#x27;m glad that we&#x27;ve managed even to help some&quot;, Vera Muromtseva-Bunina later wrote.

=== Last years ===

In May 1945 the Bunins returned to 1, rue Jacques Offenbach in Paris. Aside from several spells at the Russian House (a clinic in Juan-les-Pins) where he was convalescing, Bunin stayed in the French capital for the rest of his life. On 15 June, &quot;Russkye Novosty&quot; newspaper published its correspondent&#x27;s account of his meeting with an elderly writer who looked &quot;as sprightly and lively as if he had never had to come through those five years of voluntary exile.&quot; According to Bunin&#x27;s friend N. Roshchin, &quot;the liberation of France was a cause of great celebration and exultation for Bunin&quot;.

Once, in the audience at a Soviet &quot;Russian Theatre&quot; show in Paris, Bunin found himself sitting next to a young Red Army colonel. As the latter rose and bowed, saying: &quot;Do I have the honour of sitting next to Ivan Alekseyevich Bunin?&quot; the writer sprang to his feet: &quot;I have the even higher honour of sitting next to an officer of the great Red Army!&quot; he passionately retorted. On 19 June 1945, Bunin held a literary show in Paris where he read some of the &quot;Dark Avenue&quot; stories. In the autumn of 1945, on the wave of the great patriotic boom, Bunin&#x27;s 75th birthday was widely celebrated in the Parisian Russian community. Bunin started to communicate closely with the Soviet connoisseurs, journalist Yuri Zhukov and literary agent Boris Mikhailov, the latter receiving from the writer several new stories for proposed publishing in the USSR. Rumours started circulating that the Soviet version of &quot;The Complete Bunin&quot; was already in the works.

In the late 1940s Bunin, having become interested in the new Soviet literature, in particular the works of Aleksandr Tvardovsky and Konstantin Paustovsky, entertained plans of returning to the Soviet Union, as Aleksandr Kuprin had done in the 1930s. In 1946, speaking to his Communist counterparts in Paris, Bunin praised the Supreme Soviet&#x27;s decision to return Soviet citizenship to Russian exiles in France, still stopping short of saying &quot;yes&quot; to the continuous urging from the Soviet side for him to return. &quot;It is hard for an old man to go back to places where he&#x27;s pranced goat-like in better times. Friends and relatives are all buried... That for me would be a graveyard trip,&quot; he reportedly said to Zhukov, promising though, to &quot;think more of it.&quot; Financial difficulties and the French reading public&#x27;s relative indifference to the publication of &quot;Dark Avenues&quot; figured high among his motives. &quot;Would you mind asking the Union of Writers to send me at least some of the money for books that&#x27;ve been published and re-issued in Moscow in the 1920s and 1930s? I am weak, I am short of breath, I need to go to the South but am too skinny to even dream of it,&quot; Bunin wrote to Nikolay Teleshov in a 19 November 1946, letter.

Negotiations for the writer&#x27;s return came to an end after the publication of his &quot;Memoirs&quot; (&quot;Воспоминания&quot;, 1950), full of scathing criticism of Soviet cultural life. Apparently aware of his own negativism, Bunin wrote: &quot;I was born too late. If I had been born earlier, my literary memoirs would have been different. I wouldn&#x27;t have been a witness to 1905, the First World War, then 1917 and what followed: Lenin, Stalin, Hitler... How can I not be jealous of our forefather Noah. He lived through only one flood in his lifetime&quot;. Reportedly, the infamous Zhdanov decree was one of the reasons for Bunin&#x27;s change of mind. On 15 September 1947, Bunin wrote to Mark Aldanov: &quot;I have a letter here from Teleshov, written on 7 September; &#x27;what a pity (he writes) that you&#x27;ve missed all of this: how your book was set up, how everybody was waiting for you here, in the place where you could have been... rich, feasted, and held in such high honour!&#x27; Having read this I spent an hour hair-tearing. Then I suddenly became calm. It just came to me all of a sudden all those other things Zhdanov and Fadeev might have given me instead of feasts, riches and laurels...&quot;

After 1948, his health deteriorating, Bunin concentrated upon writing memoirs and a book on Anton Chekhov. He was aided by his wife, who, along with Zurov, completed the work after Bunin&#x27;s death and saw to its publication in New York in 1955. In English translation it was entitled &quot;About Chekhov: The Unfinished Symphony&quot;. Bunin also revised a number of stories for publication in new collections, spent considerable time looking through his papers and annotated his collected works for a definitive edition. In 1951 Bunin was elected the first ever hononary International PEN member, representing the community of writers in exile. According to A. J. Heywood, one major event of Bunin&#x27;s last years was his quarrel in 1948 with Maria Tsetlina and Boris Zaitsev, following the decision by the Union of Russian Writers and Journalists in France to expel holders of Soviet passports from its membership. Bunin responded by resigning from the Union. The writer&#x27;s last years were marred by bitterness, disillusionment and ill-health; he was suffering from asthma, bronchitis and chronic pneumonia.

===Death===
On 2 May 1953, Bunin left in his diary a note that proved to be his last one. &quot;Still, this is so dumbfoundingly extraordinary. In a very short while there will be no more of me – and of all the things worldly, of all the affairs and destinies, from then on I will be unaware! And what I&#x27;m left to do here is dumbly try to consciously impose upon myself fear and amazement,&quot; he wrote.

Ivan Alekseyevich Bunin died in a Paris attic flat in the early hours of 8 November 1953. Heart failure, cardiac asthma and pulmonary sclerosis were cited as the causes of death. A lavish burial service took place at the Russian Church on Rue Daru. All the major newspapers, both Russian and French, published large obituaries. For quite a while the coffin was held in a vault. On 30 January 1954, Bunin was buried in the Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery.

In the 1950s, Bunin became the first of the Russian writers in exile to be published officially in the USSR. In 1965, &quot;The Complete Bunin&quot; came out in Moscow in nine volumes. Some of his more controversial books, notably &quot;Cursed Days&quot;, remained banned in the Soviet Union until the late 1980s.

== Legacy ==

Ivan Bunin made history as the first Russian writer to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature. The immediate basis for the award was the autobiographical novel &quot;The Life of Arseniev&quot;, but Bunin&#x27;s legacy is much wider in scope. He is regarded as a master of the short story, described by scholar Oleg Mikhaylov as an &quot;archaist innovator&quot; who, while remaining true to the literary tradition of the 19th century, made huge leaps in terms of artistic expression and purity of style. &quot;[Bunin&#x27;s] style heralds an historical precedent... technical precision as an instrument of bringing out beauty is sharpened to the extreme. There&#x27;s hardly another poet who on dozens of pages would fail to produce a single epithet, analogy or metaphor... the ability to perform such a simplification of poetic language without doing any harm to it is the sign of a true artist. When it comes to artistic precision Bunin has no rivals among Russian poets,&quot; wrote &quot;Vestnik Evropy&quot;.

Bunin&#x27;s early stories were of uneven quality. They were united in their &quot;earthiness&quot;, lack of plot and signs of a curious longing for &quot;life&#x27;s farthest horizons&quot;; young Bunin started his career by trying to approach the ancient dilemmas of the human being, and his first characters were typically old men. His early prose works had one common leitmotif: that of nature&#x27;s beauty and wisdom bitterly contrasting with humanity&#x27;s ugly shallowness. As he progressed, Bunin started to receive encouraging reviews: Anton Chekhov warmly greeted his first stories, even if he found too much &quot;density&quot; in them. But it was Gorky who gave Bunin&#x27;s prose its highest praise. Till the end of his life Gorky (long after the relationship between former friends had soured) rated Bunin among Russian literature&#x27;s greatest writers and recommended his prose for younger generations of writers as an example of true and unwithering classicism.

As a poet, Bunin started out as a follower of Ivan Nikitin and Aleksey Koltsov, then gravitated towards the Yakov Polonsky and Afanasy Fet school, the latter&#x27;s impressionism becoming a marked influence. The theme of Bunin&#x27;s early works seemed to be the demise of the traditional Russian nobleman of the past – something which as an artist he simultaneously gravitated toward and felt averted from. In the 1900s this gave way to a more introspective, philosophical style, akin to Fyodor Tyutchev and his &quot;poetic cosmology&quot;. All the while Bunin remained hostile to modernism (and the darker side of it, &quot;decadence&quot;); Mikhaylov saw him as the torch-bearer of Aleksander Pushkin&#x27;s tradition of &quot;praising the naked simplicity&#x27;s charms.&quot;
The symbolist&#x27;s flights of imagination and grotesque passions foreign to him, Bunin made nature his field of artistic research and here carved his art to perfection. &quot;Few people are capable of loving nature as Bunin does. And it&#x27;s this love that makes his scope wide, his vision deep, his colour and aural impressions so rich,&quot; wrote Aleksander Blok, a poet from a literary camp Bunin treated as hostile. It was for his books of poetry (the most notable of which is &quot;Falling Leaves&quot;, 1901) and his poetic translations that Bunin became a three time Pushkin Prize laureate. His verse was praised by Aleksander Kuprin while Blok regarded Bunin as among the first in the hierarchy of Russian poets. One great admirer of Bunin&#x27;s verse was Vladimir Nabokov, who (even if making scornful remarks about Bunin&#x27;s prose) compared him to Blok. Some see Bunin as a direct follower of Gogol, who was the first in Russian literature to discover the art of fusing poetry and prose together.

The wholesomeness of Bunin&#x27;s character allowed him to avoid crises to become virtually the only author of the first decades of the 20th century to develop gradually and logically. &quot;Bunin is the only one who remains true to himself&quot;, Gorky wrote in a letter to Chirikov in 1907. Yet, an outsider to all the contemporary trends and literary movements, Bunin was never truly famous in Russia. Becoming an Academician in 1909 alienated him even more from the critics, the majority of whom saw the Academy&#x27;s decision to expel Gorky several years earlier as a disgrace. The closest Bunin came to fame was in 1911–1912 when &quot;The Village&quot; and &quot;Dry Valley&quot; came out. The former, according to the author, &quot;sketched with sharp cruelty the most striking lines of the Russian soul, its light and dark sides, and its often tragic foundations&quot;; it caused passionate, and occasionally very hostile reactions. &quot;Nobody has ever drawn the [Russian] village in such a deep historical context before,&quot; Maxim Gorky wrote. After this uncompromising book it became impossible to continue to paint the Russian peasantry life in the idealised, narodnik-style way, Bunin single-handedly closed this long chapter in Russian literature. He maintained the truly classic traditions of realism in Russian literature at the very time when they were in the gravest danger, under attack by modernists and decadents. Yet he was far from &quot;traditional&quot; in many ways, introducing to Russian literature a completely new set of characters and a quite novel, laconic way of saying things.
&quot;Dry Valley&quot; was regarded as another huge step forward for Bunin. While &quot;The Village&quot; dealt metaphorically with Russia as a whole in a historical context, here, according to the author, the &quot;Russian soul [was brought into the focus] in the attempt to highlight the Slavic psyche&#x27;s most prominent features.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s one of the greatest books of Russian horror, and there&#x27;s an element of liturgy in it... Like a young priest with his faith destroyed, Bunin buried the whole of his class,&quot; wrote Gorky.

Bunin&#x27;s travel sketches were lauded as innovative, notably &quot;Bird&#x27;s Shadow&quot; (1907–1911). &quot;He&#x27;s enchanted with the East, with the &#x27;light-bearing&#x27; lands he now describes in such beautiful fashion... For [depicting] the East, both Biblical and modern, Bunin chooses the appropriate style, solemn and incandescent, full of imagery, bathing in waves of sultry sunlight and adorned with arabesques and precious stones, so that, when he tells of these grey-haired ancient times, disappearing in the distant haze of religion and myth, the impression he achieves is that of watching a great chariot of human history moving before our eyes,&quot; wrote Yuri Aykhenvald. Critics noted Bunin&#x27;s uncanny knack of immersing himself into alien cultures, both old and new, best demonstrated in his Eastern cycle of short stories as well as his superb translation of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot; (1898).

Bunin was greatly interested in international myths and folklore, as well as the Russian folkloric tradition. But, (according to Georgy Adamovich) &quot;he was absolutely intolerant towards those of his colleagues who employed stylizations, the &quot;style Russe&quot; manufacturers. His cruel – and rightly so – review of Sergey Gorodetsky&#x27;s poetry was one example. Even Blok&#x27;s &quot;Kulikovo Field&quot; (for me, an outstanding piece) irritated him as too lavishly adorned... &quot;That&#x27;s Vasnetsov,&quot; he commented, meaning &#x27;masquerade and opera&#x27;. But he treated things that he felt were not masqueradery differently. Of the &quot;Slovo o Polku Igoreve&quot;... he said something to the effect that all the poets of the whole world lumped together couldn&#x27;t have created such wonder, in fact something close to Pushkin&#x27;s words. Yet translations of the legend... outraged him, particularly that of Balmont. He despised Shmelyov for his pseudo-Russian pretenses, though admitting his literary gift. Bunin had an extraordinarily sharp ear for falseness: he instantly recognized this jarring note and was infuriated. That was why he loved Tolstoy so much. Once, I remember, he spoke of Tolstoy as the one &#x27;who&#x27;s never said a single word that would be an exaggeration&#x27;.&quot;

Bunin has often been spoken of as a &quot;cold&quot; writer. Some of his conceptual poems of the 1910s refuted this stereotype, tackling philosophical issues like the mission of an artist (&quot;Insensory&quot;, 1916) where he showed fiery passion. According to Oleg Mikhaylov, &quot;Bunin wanted to maintain distance between himself and his reader, being frightened by any closeness... But his pride never excluded passions, just served as a panzer — it was like a flaming torch in an icy shell.&quot; On a more personal level, Vera Muromtseva confirmed: &quot;Sure, he wanted to come across as [cold and aloof] and he succeeded by being a first-class actor... people who didn&#x27;t know him well enough couldn&#x27;t begin to imagine what depths of soft tenderness his soul was capable of reaching,&quot; she wrote in her memoirs.

The best of Bunin&#x27;s prose (&quot;The Gentleman from San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Loopy Ears&quot; and notably, &quot;Brothers&quot;, based on Ceylon&#x27;s religious myth) had a strong philosophical streak to it. In terms of ethics Bunin was under the strong influence of Socrates (as related by Xenophon and Plato), he argued that it was the Greek classic who first expounded many things that were later found in Hindu and Jewish sacred books. Bunin was particularly impressed with Socrates&#x27;s ideas on the intrinsic value of human individuality, it being a &quot;kind of focus for higher forces&quot; (quoted from Bunin&#x27;s short story &quot;Back to Rome&quot;). As a purveyor of Socratic ideals, Bunin followed Leo Tolstoy; the latter&#x27;s observation about beauty being &quot;the crown of virtue&quot; was Bunin&#x27;s idea too. Critics found deep philosophical motives, and deep undercurrents in &quot;Mitya&#x27;s Love&quot; and &quot;The Life of Arseniev&quot;, two pieces in which &quot;Bunin came closest to a deep metaphysical understanding of the human being&#x27;s tragic essence.&quot; Konstantin Paustovsky called &quot;The Life of Arseniev&quot; &quot;one of the most outstanding phenomena of world literature.&quot;

In his view on Russia and its history Bunin for a while had much in common with A. K. Tolstoy (of whom he spoke with great respect); both tended to idealise the pre-Tatar Rus. Years later he greatly modified his view of Russian history, forming a more negative outlook. &quot;There are two streaks in our people: one dominated by Rus, another by Chudh and Merya. Both have in them a frightening instability, sway... As Russian people say of themselves: we are like wood — both club and icon may come of it, depending on who is working on this wood,&quot; Bunin wrote years later.

In emigration Bunin continued his experiments with extremely concise, ultra-ionized prose, taking Chekhov and Tolstoy&#x27;s ideas on expressive economy to the last extreme. The result of this was &quot;God&#x27;s Tree&quot;, a collection of stories so short, some of them were half a page long. Professor Pyotr Bitsilly thought &quot;God&#x27;s Tree&quot; to be &quot;the most perfect of Bunin&#x27;s works and the most exemplary. Nowhere else can such eloquent laconism can be found, such definitive and exquisite writing, such freedom of expression and really magnificent demonstration of [mind] over matter. No other book of his has in it such a wealth of material for understanding of Bunin&#x27;s basic method – a method in which, in fact, there was nothing but basics. This simple but precious quality – honesty bordering on hatred of any pretense – is what makes Bunin so closely related to... Pushkin, Tolstoy and Chekhov,&quot; Bitsilli wrote.

Influential, even if controversial, was his &quot;Cursed Days&quot; 1918–1920 diary, of which scholar Thomas Gaiton Marullo wrote: 

Despite his works being virtually banned in the Soviet Union up until the mid-1950s, Bunin exerted a strong influence over several generations of Soviet writers. Among those who owed a lot to Bunin, critics mentioned Mikhail Sholokhov, Konstantin Fedin, Konstantin Paustovsky, Ivan Sokolov-Mikitov, and later Yuri Kazakov, Vasily Belov and Viktor Likhonosov.

Ivan Bunin&#x27;s books have been translated into many languages, and the world&#x27;s leading writers praised his gift. Romain Rolland called Bunin an &quot;artistic genius&quot;; he was spoken and written of in much the same vein by writers like Henri de Régnier, Thomas Mann, Rainer Maria Rilke, Jerome K. Jerome, and Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz. In 1950, on the eve of his 80th birthday, François Mauriac expressed in a letter his delight and admiration, but also his deep sympathy to Bunin&#x27;s personal qualities and the dignified way he&#x27;d got through all the tremendous difficulties life had thrown at him. In a letter published by Figaro, André Gide greeted Bunin &quot;on behalf of all France&quot;, calling him &quot;the great artist&quot; and adding: &quot;I don&#x27;t know of any other writer... who&#x27;s so to the point in expressing human feelings, simple and yet always so fresh and new&quot;. European critics often compared Bunin to both Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky, crediting him with having renovated the Russian realist tradition both in essence and in form.

On 22 October 2020 Google celebrated his 150th birthday with a Google Doodle.

== Private life ==

Bunin&#x27;s first love was Varvara Pashchenko, his classmate in Yelets [not plausible as Ivan was at a male gymnasium and Varvara at an all female gymnasium], daughter of a doctor and an actress, whom he fell for in 1889 and then went on to work with in Oryol in 1892. Their relationship was difficult in many ways: the girl&#x27;s father detested the union because of Bunin&#x27;s impecunious circumstances, Varvara herself was not sure if she wanted to marry and Bunin too was uncertain whether marriage was really appropriate for him. The couple moved to Poltava and settled in Yuly Bunin&#x27;s home, but by 1892 their relations deteriorated, Pashchenko complaining in a letter to Yuly Bunin that serious quarrels were frequent, and begging for assistance in bringing their union to an end. The affair eventually ended in 1894 with her marrying actor and writer A. N. Bibikov, Ivan Bunin&#x27;s close friend. Bunin felt betrayed, and for a time his family feared the possibility of him committing suicide. According to some sources it was Varvara Pashchenko who many years later would appear under the name of Lika in &quot;The Life of Arseniev&quot; (chapter V of the book, entitled &quot;Lika&quot;, was also published as a short story). Scholar Tatyana Alexandrova, though, questioned this identification (suggesting Mirra Lokhvitskaya might have been the major prototype), while Vera Muromtseva thought of Lika as a &#x27;collective&#x27; character aggregating the writer&#x27;s reminiscences of several women he knew in his youth.

In the summer of 1898 while staying with writer A. M. Fedorov, Bunin became acquainted with N. P. Tsakni, a Greek social-democrat activist, the publisher and editor of the Odessa newspaper &quot;Yuzhnoe Obozrenie&quot; (&quot;Southern Review&quot;). Invited to contribute to the paper, Bunin became virtually a daily visitor to the Tsakni family dacha and fell in love with the latter&#x27;s 18-year-old daughter, Anna (1879–1963). On 23 September 1898, the two married, but by 1899 signs of alienation between them were obvious. At the time of their acrimonious separation in March 1900 Anna was pregnant. She gave birth to a son, Nikolai, in Odessa on 30 August of the same year. The boy, of whom his father saw very little, died on 16 January 1905, from a combination of scarlet fever, measles and heart complications.

Ivan Bunin&#x27;s second wife was Vera Muromtseva (1881–1961), niece of the high-ranking politician Sergey Muromtsev. The two had initially been introduced to each other by writer Ekaterina Lopatina some years earlier, but it was their encounter at the house of the writer Boris Zaitsev in November 1906 which led to an intense relationship which resulted in the couple becoming inseparable until Bunin&#x27;s death. Bunin and Muromtseva married officially only in 1922, after he managed at last to divorce Tsakni legally. Decades later Vera Muromtseva-Bunina became famous in her own right with her book &quot;Life of Bunin&quot;.

In 1927, while in Grasse, Bunin fell for the Russian poet Galina Kuznetsova, on vacation there with her husband. The latter, outraged by the well-publicized affair, stormed off, while Bunin not only managed to somehow convince Vera Muromtseva that his love for Galina was purely platonic, but also invite the latter to stay in the house as a secretary and &#x27;a family member&#x27;. The situation was complicated by the fact that Leonid Zurov, who stayed with the Bunins as a guest for many years, was secretly in love with Vera (of which her husband was aware); this made it more of a &quot;love quadrilateral&quot; than a mere triangle. Bunin and Kuznetsova&#x27;s affair ended dramatically in 1942 when the latter, now deeply in love with another frequent guest, opera singer Margo Stepun, sister of Fyodor Stepun, left Bunin, who felt disgraced and insulted. The writer&#x27;s tempestuous private life in emigration became the subject of the internationally acclaimed Russian movie, &quot;His Wife&#x27;s Diary&quot; (or &quot;The Diary of His Wife&quot;) (2000). which caused controversy and was described by some as masterful and thought-provoking, but by others as vulgar, inaccurate and in bad taste. Vera Muromtseva-Bunina later accepted both Kuznetsova and Margarita Stepun as friends: &quot;nashi&quot; (&quot;ours&quot;), as she called them, lived with the Bunins for long periods during the Second World War. According to A.J. Heywood of Leeds University, in Germany and then New York, after the war, Kuznetsova and Stepun negotiated with publishers on Bunin&#x27;s behalf and maintained a regular correspondence with Ivan and Vera up until their respective deaths.

<text>James Edward Burton (born August 21, 1939, in Dubberly, Louisiana, United States) is an American guitarist. A member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame since 2001 (his induction speech was given by longtime fan Keith Richards), Burton has also been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum. He was elected into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2024. Critic Mark Deming writes that &quot;Burton has a well-deserved reputation as one of the finest guitar pickers in either country or rock ... Burton is one of the best guitar players to ever touch a fretboard.&quot; He is ranked number 24 in Rolling Stone list of 250 greatest guitarists of all time.

Since the 1950s, Burton has recorded and performed with an array of singers, including Bob Luman, Dale Hawkins, Ricky Nelson, Elvis Presley (and was leader of Presley&#x27;s TCB Band), The Everly Brothers, Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, Glen Campbell, John Denver, Gram Parsons, Emmylou Harris, Judy Collins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Claude King, Elvis Costello, Joe Osborn, Roy Orbison, Joni Mitchell, Hoyt Axton, Townes Van Zandt, Steve Young, Vince Gill, and Suzi Quatro.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Burton was born in Dubberly in south Webster Parish near Minden, Louisiana, to Guy M. Burton (1909–2001) and the former Lola Poland (1914–2011), a native of rural Fryeburg in Bienville Parish. She was the daughter of James and Althius Poland. Burton&#x27;s wife is Louise Burton.

Self-taught, Burton began playing guitar during childhood. He was hired to be part of the staff band for the popular &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; radio show in Shreveport. While he was still a teenager, Burton left Shreveport for Los Angeles, where he joined Ricky Nelson&#x27;s band. There, he made numerous recordings as a session musician. Burton created and played the guitar solo on Dale Hawkins 1957 hit song &quot;Susie Q&quot;, a record that would become one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. He had originally written the song as an instrumental before Hawkins wrote lyrics for it; Burton never received credit or royalties for his contributions to &quot;Susie Q&quot;.

===With Ricky Nelson, work as a session musician, and &quot;Shindig!&quot;===
Burton played guitar on the majority of Ricky Nelson&#x27;s songs recorded during the first 11 years of Nelson&#x27;s career, beginning with his premiere at Master Recorders in Hollywood on November 18, 1957, for the classic &quot;Stood Up&quot;/&quot;Waitin&#x27; in School&quot; rockabilly single. At this time, Burton was relegated to rhythm as Joe Maphis was still playing lead guitar for Nelson. Ricky Nelson&#x27;s original (regular) band included Burton and double bassist James Kirkland; Kirkland was later replaced by Joe Osborn on electric bass.

Burton&#x27;s first single as Nelson&#x27;s &quot;lead&quot; guitarist was &quot;Believe What You Say&quot;. In 1965 he started working on the television program &quot;Shindig!&quot; which curtailed his touring with Nelson. However, Burton continued contributing to his friend&#x27;s studio albums through the &quot;Perspective&quot; sessions in April 1968.

The &quot;Shindig!&quot; exposure led to recording session work with a variety of artists, mostly as an unattributed sideman. In 1966, he began focusing more on his work as a session guitarist. 

In 1967 Burton played Dobro on the Richie Furay song, &quot;A Child&#x27;s Claim To Fame&quot; on Buffalo Springfield&#x27;s second album, &quot;Buffalo Springfield Again&quot;. Due to the volume of work, Burton turned down an offer to join Bob Dylan&#x27;s first touring band, and another offer to play on Elvis Presley&#x27;s 1968 comeback TV special &quot;Elvis&quot;.

===With Elvis Presley===
In 1969, Presley again asked Burton to join his show in Las Vegas, and, this time, Burton accepted. Burton organized the TCB Band, serving as its leader, and backed Presley from 1969 until Presley&#x27;s death in 1977. A hallmark of Elvis&#x27; live shows during this period was his exhortation, &quot;Play it, James&quot;, as a cue for the guitarist&#x27;s solos. For the first season in Vegas in 1969, Burton played his red standard Telecaster. Shortly thereafter, he purchased the now familiar pink paisley custom Telecaster. Burton was not sure that Elvis would like it; however, since Elvis did, Burton used it for every show.

While working with Elvis Presley, he also recorded a solo album, &quot;The Guitar Sounds of James Burton&quot;, in 1971.

===With Emmylou Harris and John Denver===
During 1975 and 1976, while still touring with Presley, Burton was one of the first members to join and tour with Emmylou Harris as part of her backing band, the &quot;Hot Band&quot;, after the death of Gram Parsons. He was joined by a cast of talented musicians which included his bandmate with Presley, Glen D. Hardin, and newer musicians which included Rodney Crowell. However, once Presley was ready to return to the road, Burton returned to perform with him, although the others, including Hardin, elected to continue with Harris. Just before Presley died in 1977, Burton was called to play on a John Denver television special. During the taping, Denver asked if Burton would consider going on a European tour. Burton said he was working with Elvis, but if scheduling permitted, he would be glad to go. Shortly after Elvis&#x27; death, Burton began a regular collaboration with Denver. The first album they recorded was &quot;I Want to Live&quot;.

During the sessions, Burton and Denver talked about a band. Glen Hardin and Jerry Scheff, from Presley&#x27;s band, joined the new band too. Burton remained a member of Denver&#x27;s band until 1994, but often toured in parallel with other artists including Jerry Lee Lewis. In the 16 years Burton worked with Denver, they recorded 12 albums and toured around the world. While touring with Denver, Burton carried several instruments, including backup Dobros and a spare 1969 Pink Paisley Fender Telecaster he had used as a touring guitarist with Elvis Presley during the 1970s. He rejoined Denver in 1995 for the Wildlife Concert. When Denver died in 1997, Burton spoke at his memorial service in Aspen, Colorado.

===Recent career===
Burton&#x27;s later career included work with John Denver, Merle Haggard, Rodney Crowell, and Emmylou Harris. Beginning with &quot;King of America&quot; (1986), Burton recorded and toured with Elvis Costello intermittently for about a decade. In 1988, he was a prominent part of the acclaimed Cinemax special, &quot;Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night&quot;. In 1990, Burton moved back to his hometown of Shreveport permanently.

Between 1998 and 2013, Burton played lead guitar in &quot;&quot; which reunited some of Elvis&#x27; former TCB bandmates, background singers, and Elvis&#x27; orchestral conductor Joe Guercio (mostly from the &quot;concert years&quot; 1969–1977) live on stage.

In fall 2004, Burton recorded &quot;Matt Lucas-Back in the Saddle Again&quot;, a sequel to the Matt Lucas album &quot;The Chicago Sessions&quot;. The album features rockabilly and country music, and was released in May 2006 by Ten O Nine Records.

In 2005, Burton started the annual James Burton International Guitar Festival to raise money for his charitable foundation. The festival is held in the Red River District of Shreveport.

In 2007, he was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, TN as a member of the L.A. session player group known as The Wrecking Crew. In 2008, Burton was asked by Brad Paisley to play on his upcoming album &quot;&quot;. Burton was featured on an instrumental track called &quot;Cluster Pluck&quot;, which also featured Vince Gill, Albert Lee, Steve Wariner, John Jorgenson, Brent Mason, and Redd Volkaert. At the 51st Grammy Awards in 2009, the song won Best Country Instrumental Performance.

On August 22, 2009, on stage at his James Burton International Guitar Festival, James Burton was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. On July 15, 2010, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Magazine announced that Eric Clapton and James Burton would provide guitars on the track &quot;You Can Have Her&quot; for Jerry Lee Lewis&#x27; album &quot;Mean Old Man&quot;, scheduled for release in fall 2010. Burton also joined Jerry Lee Lewis on &quot;Swinging Doors&quot; on the same album. In 2011, Burton was named one of &quot;Five Living Legends of Shreveport&quot; by Danny Fox of KWKH radio. On June 9, 2012, Burton appeared in Shreveport at the Municipal Auditorium for a presentation of Garrison Keillor&#x27;s &quot;Prairie Home Companion&quot;.

In 2019, for the first time since 2014, the TCB Band performed a new Elvis: The Concert-style show, alongside the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, combining elements from the 2016-2018 Presley/Philharmonic tours with the old 1997-2014 TCB Band tours; however, no further tours with the TCB Band members were booked after this point.

In March 2020, it was announced that Burton and producer T-Bone Burnett were collaborating with Jerry Lee Lewis and recording a new album of gospel covers. It was the first time he entered a recording studio following his stroke. , it is unknown how much progress was made with this gospel album, or if it was ever completed, as nothing from these sessions has been released; Lewis later recorded another gospel album with his cousin Jimmy Swaggart that was unrelated to the 2020 project with Burnett and Burton.

In 2022 and early 2023, Burton was sidelined due to contracting the coronavirus, being diagnosed with kidney cancer, and breaking his hip. In June 2023, Burton led an all-star group of guest musicians at the London Palladium for a concert event named &quot;James Burton &amp; Friends: One Night Only&quot;. The event featured Burton joined by Sir Brian May of Queen, Albert Lee, Van Morrison, Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter, Ronnie Wood, and Elvis Costello. In September 2023, Burton contributed to recordings for Brad Paisley&#x27;s upcoming album &quot;Son of the Mountains&quot;. 

In January 2024, Burton participated in the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California, riding on a Louisiana-themed float. Also in 2024, Burton was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

==Equipment and playing style==
Burton works with a variety of amplifiers to provide flexibility and a wide range of sounds. He has used a Music Man 210-150, an old Fender Twin with K model Lansing speakers, and a 1964 Fender Deluxe. His primary guitar has always been a Fender Telecaster, beginning with an early blonde model his parents bought for him around 1952. His 1969 Paisley Red (better known as Pink Paisley) Telecaster became the basis for his James Burton Telecaster model in 1991, with Lace Sensor pickups and a TBX tone circuit. Five years later his 1953 Candy Apple Red Telecaster was the inspiration for a standard version Artist Signature model featuring two Fender Texas Special Tele single coil pickups and a vintage-style 6-saddle bridge. In 2006, the Signature Paisley model was redesigned with a red paisley flame design over a black body, plus three specially designed blade pickups, a no-load tone control and S-1 switching system. 

He can also be seen playing am early model Fender Jazz Master (possibly a prototype) in a circa 1961 live television version of &quot;Hello Mary Lou&quot; with Nelson. There is no other recorded evidence that he used this guitar again.

According to the biography on Burton&#x27;s official website, his style of lead playing is unique, as &quot;[he] uses a straight pick and a fingerpick on his middle finger. On this record [starting with his performance on Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Believe What You Say&quot;], James replaced his first 4 strings with banjo strings and moved the A and D string up to D and E. This allowed him to bend the strings up a lot more. James&#x27; legendary chickin&#x27; pickin&#x27; was born. He later had them [his guitar strings] gauged: .009, .010, .012, .024, .032 and .038.&quot;

==Planned museum==
The James Burton Foundation, a 501(c) non-profit organization at 714 Elvis Presley Avenue in Shreveport, is constructing the proposed &quot;James Burton Guitar and Car Museum&quot;. The facility will showcase Burton&#x27;s collection of guitars and classic cars as well as models from some of his celebrity friends.

<text>Documentation is any communicable material that is used to describe, explain or instruct regarding some attributes of an object, system or procedure, such as its parts, assembly, installation, maintenance, and use. As a form of knowledge management and knowledge organization, documentation can be provided on paper, online, or on digital or analog media, such as audio tape or CDs. Examples are user guides, white papers, online help, and quick-reference guides. Paper or hard-copy documentation has become less common. Documentation is often distributed via websites, software products, and other online applications.

Documentation as a set of instructional materials shouldn&#x27;t be confused with documentation science, the study of the recording and retrieval of information.

== Principles for producing documentation ==

While associated International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards are not easily available publicly, a guide from other sources for this topic may serve the purpose.

Documentation development may involve document drafting, formatting, submitting, reviewing, approving, distributing, reposting and tracking, etc., and are convened by associated standard operating procedure in a regulatory industry. It could also involve creating content from scratch. Documentation should be easy to read and understand. If it is too long and too wordy, it may be misunderstood or ignored. Clear, concise words should be used, and sentences should be limited to a maximum of 15 words. Documentation intended for a general audience should avoid gender-specific terms and cultural biases. In a series of procedures, steps should be clearly numbered.

== Producing documentation ==
Technical writers and corporate communicators are professionals whose field and work is documentation. Ideally, technical writers have a background in both the subject matter and also in writing, managing content, and information architecture. Technical writers more commonly collaborate with subject-matter experts, such as engineers, technical experts, medical professionals, etc. to define and then create documentation to meet the user&#x27;s needs. Corporate communications includes other types of written documentation, for example:
* Market communications (MarCom): MarCom writers endeavor to convey the company&#x27;s value proposition through a variety of print, electronic, and social media. This area of corporate writing is often engaged in responding to proposals.
* Technical communication (TechCom): Technical writers document a company&#x27;s product or service. Technical publications can include user guides, installation and configuration manuals, and troubleshooting and repair procedures.
* Legal writing: This type of documentation is often prepared by attorneys or paralegals.
* Compliance documentation: This type of documentation codifies standard operating procedures, for any regulatory compliance needs, as for safety approval, taxation, financing, and technical approval.
* Healthcare documentation: This field of documentation encompasses the timely recording and validation of events that have occurred during the course of providing health care.

== Documentation in computer science ==

=== Types ===
The following are typical software documentation types:
* Request for proposal
* Requirements/statement of work/scope of work
* Software design and functional specification
* System design and functional specifications
* Change management, error and enhancement tracking
* User acceptance testing
* Manpages

The following are typical hardware and service documentation types:
* Network diagrams
* Network maps
* Datasheet for IT systems (server, switch, e.g.)
* Service catalog and service portfolio (Information Technology Infrastructure Library)

=== Software Documentation Folder (SDF) tool ===
A common type of software document written in the simulation industry is the SDF. When developing software for a simulator, which can range from embedded avionics devices to 3D terrain databases by way of full motion control systems, the engineer keeps a notebook detailing the development &quot;the build&quot; of the project or module. The document can be a wiki page, Microsoft Word document or other environment. They should contain a &quot;requirements&quot; section, an &quot;interface&quot; section to detail the communication interface of the software. Often a &quot;notes&quot; section is used to detail the proof of concept, and then track errors and enhancements. Finally, a &quot;testing&quot; section to document how the software was tested. This documents conformance to the client&#x27;s requirements. The result is a detailed description of how the software is designed, how to build and install the software on the target device, and any known defects and workarounds. This build document enables future developers and maintainers to come up to speed on the software in a timely manner, and also provides a roadmap to modifying code or searching for bugs.

=== Software tools for network inventory and configuration ===
These software tools can automatically collect data of your network equipment. The data could be for inventory and for configuration information. The Information Technology Infrastructure Library requests to create such a database as a basis for all information for the IT responsible. It is also the basis for IT documentation. Examples include XIA Configuration.

== Documentation in criminal justice ==

&quot;Documentation&quot; is the preferred term for the process of populating criminal databases. Examples include the National Counterterrorism Center&#x27;s Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, sex offender registries, and gang databases.

== Documentation in early childhood education ==
Documentation, as it pertains to the early childhood education field, is &quot;when we notice and value children&#x27;s ideas, thinking, questions, and theories about the world and then collect traces of their work (drawings, photographs of the children in action, and transcripts of their words) to share with a wider community&quot;.

Thus, documentation is a process, used to link the educator&#x27;s knowledge and learning of the child/children with the families, other collaborators, and even to the children themselves.

Documentation is an integral part of the cycle of inquiry - observing, reflecting, documenting, sharing and responding.

Pedagogical documentation, in terms of the teacher documentation, is the &quot;teacher&#x27;s story of the movement in children&#x27;s understanding&quot;. According to Stephanie Cox Suarez in &quot;Documentation - Transforming our Perspectives&quot;, &quot;teachers are considered researchers, and documentation is a research tool to support knowledge building among children and adults&quot;.

Documentation can take many different styles in the classroom. The following exemplifies ways in which documentation can make the research, or learning, visible:

# Documentation panels (bulletin-board-like presentation with multiple pictures and descriptions about the project or event).
# Daily log (a log kept every day that records the play and learning in the classroom)
# Documentation developed by or with the children (when observing children during documentation, the child&#x27;s lens of the observation is used in the actual documentation)
# Individual portfolios (documentation used to track and highlight the development of each child)
# Electronic documentation (using apps and devices to share documentation with families and collaborators)
# Transcripts or recordings of conversations (using recording in documentation can bring about deeper reflections for both the educator and the child)
# Learning stories (a narrative used to &quot;describe learning and help children see themselves as powerful learners&quot;)
# The classroom as documentation (reflections and documentation of the physical environment of a classroom).

Documentation is certainly a process in and of itself, and it is also a process within the educator. The following is the development of documentation as it progresses for and in the educator themselves:

* Develop(s) habits of documentation
* Become(s) comfortable with going public with recounting of activities
* Develop(s) visual literacy skills
* Conceptualize(s) the purpose of documentation as making learning styles visible, and
* Share(s) visible theories for interpretation purposes and further design of curriculum.

<doc id="164431" wikidata="Q281327" url="?curid=164431" title="Lupe Pintor">
<text>José Guadalupe Pintor Guzmán (born April 13, 1955), better known as Lupe Pintor, is a Mexican former professional boxer who competed from 1974 to 1995. He is a world champion in two weight classes, having held the WBC bantamweight title from 1979 to 1983 and the WBC super bantamweight title from 1985 to 1986.

==Early life and his career==
Lupe Pintor was born into a poor, working-class family in Cuajimalpa, just outside Mexico City in 1955 and is alleged to have had an extremely violent relationship with his father, eventually forcing him to run away. He lived for some time on the city streets and began boxing professionally in 1974.

He opened his account with a second-round knockout of Manuel Vázquez and immediately stepped up to ten round bouts, claiming a decision over Francisco Nunez on his next outing. He suffered his first loss three fights later, when he was disqualified against Magarito Lozano, but claimed victory in his next eight bouts, seven by knockout, including wins over notables Juan Díaz, Rocky Mijares and Willie Jespen.

Pintor first boxed future World Bantamweight Champion Alberto Davila on 25 February 1976, losing a decision over ten rounds, then embarked on a winning streak of some twenty-two fights in a row. Amongst the fighters he beat during this period were Gerald Hayes – who later conquered Juan Laporte – and Antonio Becerra, the only man to get the better of Salvador Sánchez as a professional boxer.

He then travelled to Puerto Rico, where he lost a ten-round decision to Leo Cruz – himself a future world champion. Upon returning to Mexico, Pintor lost for the second time in a row, carelessly dropping a decision to journeyman Jose Luis Soto. Another winning streak, comprising five fights in a row, all by way of knockout and he was ready for a shot at the world title.

==World championships==
Carlos Zarate was Pintor&#x27;s stable mate and a fellow Mexican. He was an outstanding champion and continues to be rated one of the very best of all Bantamweights. The records, however, show that Pintor edged a very close and controversial split decision, following a remarkable contest that saw him hit the canvas in round four. But the judges were so at variance when recording their verdict, that (like already stated) the contest remains a matter of controversy today. Naturally, the new world champion&#x27;s relationship with Zarate – already strained – took another hit and Zarate retired in disgust.

Pintor was a busy champion and he began his reign by engaging in three non-title bouts, beating Aucencio Melendez by a knockout in the first and avenging his loss to Jose Luis Soto before losing a rematch with Manuel Vázquez by a knockout in six. Then he began to defend his title in earnest, retaining it with a knockout in twelve over Alberto Sandoval in Los Angeles and drawing over fifteen with Eijiro Murata in Tokyo.

His next bout ended tragically. He defended against Johnny Owen of Wales in Los Angeles. Many of the fans present and the authors of &quot;The Ring&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Boxing in The 20th Century&quot;, have agreed that the fight should have been stopped during round ten. But it carried on until the close of the twelfth, when Pintor unleashed a savage right-hand, knocking his opponent out cold. Owen failed to regain consciousness, lapsed into a coma and died seven weeks later. This fight was documented in the film &quot;Faces of Death II&quot;.

Saddened, Pintor – encouraged by Owen&#x27;s family – resumed his career by avenging his loss to Davila, retaining the title by unanimous decision. He went on to retain the belt against Jose Uziga – again by decision – and Jovito Rengifo, by a knockout in eight. He stopped Hurricane Teru in the fifteenth and final round to close 1981 and began 1982, by retaining the title against Seung-Hoon Lee with an eleventh-round knockout.

Soon after the Lee fight, Pintor vacated his world title and started eyeing the WBC Super Bantamweight crown worn by the great Wilfredo Gómez. Stepping up, he immediately beat former WBA World Bantamweight Champion Jorge Luján and then, on 3 December of that year, he and Gómez met as part of the Carnival of Champions in New Orleans. Showcased on HBO, this duel was subsequently dubbed the division&#x27;s &#x27;Fight of The Decade&#x27; by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine. But it did not go Pintor&#x27;s way. Gómez recorded a fourteenth-round knockout and relinquished his own title five months later.

Pintor was inactive throughout 1983. He returned to the ring a year-and-a-half later as a fully-fledged Super Bantamweight defeating Ruben Solorio on 16 February 1984 and busied himself thereafter trying to get another shot at the world title. his perseverance paid off when he was pitted against Juan &#x27;Kid&#x27; Meza, the WBC&#x27;s Super Bantamweight Champion on 18 August 1985. Pintor floored the defending champion three times on the way to collecting a unanimous decision and celebrated his new status as a double world title holder.

His first defense of this new crown did not go to plan. Traveling to Bangkok to meet Samart Payakaroon, Pintor exceeded the division weight limit and was subsequently stripped of his title at the scales. Payakaroon could still become champion if he defeated Pintor but if Pintor won the title would be declared vacant. Payakaroon pounded Pintor to defeat in five rounds and the ex-champion quit fighting for the next eight years.

Pintor made a comeback of sorts in 1994, but at the comparatively advanced age of thirty-eight, he was long past his best. Winning just twice in seven contests over the next eighteen months, he was finally convinced that it was time to retire.

===Honors===
Pintor was named The Ring magazine Comeback of the Year fighter for 1985.

==After boxing==
Pintor opened a boxing school in Mexico City. In 2002, he was invited to Merthyr Tydfil by Johnny Owen&#x27;s family to help unveil a bronze statue commemorating the boxer&#x27;s life and career.

In 2008, Pintor reunited with Carlos Zarate and joined Juan Laporte as the three former victims of Wilfredo Gómez showed up at a party dedicated to Gómez for his fiftieth birthday in Puerto Rico.

Pintor, along with Hector Camacho, Hilario Zapata, and several non-boxers, was voted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in December 2015 and inducted in June 2016.

<doc id="164432" wikidata="Q3246417" url="?curid=164432" title="Cause célèbre">
<text>A ( , ; pl. causes célèbres, pronounced like the singular) is an issue or incident arousing widespread controversy, outside campaigning, and heated public debate. The term is sometimes used positively for celebrated legal cases for their precedent value (each &quot;locus classicus&quot; or &quot;case-in-point&quot;) and more often negatively for infamous ones, whether for scale, outrage, scandal, or conspiracy theories. The term is a French phrase in common usage in English. Since it has been fully adopted into English and is included unitalicized in English dictionaries, it is not normally italicized despite its French origin.

It has been noted that the public attention given to a particular case or event can obscure the facts rather than clarify them. As John Humffreys Parry states, &quot;The true story of many a cause célèbre is never made manifest in the evidence given or in the advocates&#x27; orations, but might be recovered from these old papers when the dust of ages has rendered them immune from scandal&quot;.

== Etymology ==
In French, one of the meanings of is a legal case, and means &quot;famous&quot;. The phrase originated with the 37-volume , published in 1763, which was a collection of reports of well-known French court decisions from the 17th and 18th centuries.

While English speakers had used the phrase for many years, it came into much more common usage after the 1894 conviction of Alfred Dreyfus for espionage during the cementing of a period of deep cultural ties with a political tie between England and France, the Entente Cordiale. Both attracted worldwide interest and the period of closeness or rapprochement officially broadened the English language.

<text>Alexander Petrovich Sumarokov (; , Villmanstrand – ) was a Russian poet and playwright who single-handedly created classical theatre in Russia, thus assisting Mikhail Lomonosov to inaugurate the reign of classicism in Russian literature.

== Life and works ==
Alexander Sumarakov was born in 1717 into a family of Muscovite gentry. He was born in Villmanstrand (now Lappeenranta) in Swedish-ruled Finland, where his father was most likely serving in the Great Northern War against Sweden. Sumarokov was educated at the Cadet School in Saint Petersburg, where he became closely familiar with French learning. Neither an aristocratic dilettante like Antiokh Kantemir nor a learned professor like Vasily Trediakovsky or Mikhail Lomonosov, he was the first gentleman in Russia to choose the profession of letters. He consequently may be called the father of the Russian literary profession. His pursuits did not undermine his position in the family; indeed, his grandson was made a count and, when the Sumarokov family became extinct a century later, the title eventually passed to Prince Felix Yusupov, who also held the title of Count Sumarokov-Elston.

Sumarokov wrote much and regularly, chiefly in those literary genres neglected by Lomonosov. His principal importance rests in his plays, among which &quot;Khorev&quot; (1749) is regarded as the first regular Russian drama. He ran the first permanent public theatre in the Russian capital, where he worked with the likes of Fyodor Volkov and Ivan Dmitrevsky. His plays were based on the subjects taken from Russian history (&quot;Dmitry Samozvanets&quot;), proto-Russian legends (&quot;Khorev&quot;) or on Shakespearean plots (&quot;Makbet&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;).

In his evaluation of Sumarokov&#x27;s plays, literary historian D. S. Mirsky writes: 

Sumarokov also wrote non-dramatic works. He was the first Russian author to write fables, a genre which subsequently flourished in Russia. His satires, in which he sometimes imitates the style of popular poetry, are described by Mirsky as &quot;racy and witty attacks against the government clerks and officers of law.&quot; He wrote love songs intended for popular consumption, which brought him fame and made him chief among a group of songwriting poets who followed him. Mirsky praises Sumarokov&#x27;s songs for their &quot;prodigious metrical inventiveness (which was not so much as imitated by any of his successors) and a genuine gift of melody.&quot;

Sumarokov was also one of the earliest Russian journalists and literary critics. He edited the journal &quot;Yezhemesyachnye sochineniya&quot; (Monthly compositions) from 1759 to 1764. According to Mirsky, Sumarokov&#x27;s literary criticism is &quot;usually carping and superficial&quot; but played a significant role in teaching Russian readers the rules of classical taste. He was a follower of Voltaire and was proud of having exchanged several letters with him. Amanda Ewington has argued that Sumarokov was not only influenced by Voltaire as such but accessed a wide variety of European influences, from Shakespeare to Lope de Vega, through the conduit of Voltaire. Mirsky describes the playwright&#x27;s personality as follows: 

His daughter Ekaterina, an 18th-century poet, is often considered to be the first Russian woman writer, as she, together with and were the first women to see their works printed in Russian journals.

==Opera libretti==
Sumarokov wrote the first Russian-language libretto for an opera: that of &quot;Tsefal i Prokris&quot; (&quot;Cephalus and Prokris&quot;), by Francesco Araja, an Italian composer in the Russian court. The opera was staged in Saint Petersburg on 7 March [O.S. 27 February] 1755. He also wrote the libretto for the second opera set to a Russian text, &quot;Altsesta&quot; (&quot;Alceste&quot;, 1758), by German composer Hermann Raupach (1728–1778), also serving in the Russian court.

<doc id="164437" wikidata="Q4856361" url="?curid=164437" title="Banking in the United States">
<text>In the United States, banking had begun by the 1780s, along with the country&#x27;s founding. It has developed into a highly influential and complex system of banking and financial services. Anchored by New York City and Wall Street, it is centered on various financial services, such as private banking, asset management, and deposit security.

The beginnings of the banking industry can be traced to 1780 when the Bank of Pennsylvania was founded to fund the American Revolutionary War. After merchants in the Thirteen Colonies needed a currency as a medium of exchange, the Bank of North America was opened to facilitate more advanced financial transactions.

As of 2018, the largest banks in the United States were JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs. As of March 2024, there were 4,587 FDIC insured commercial banks and savings institutions in the U.S.

==History==
Merchants traveled from Britain to the United States and established the Bank of Pennsylvania in 1780 to fund the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). During this time, the Thirteen Colonies had not established a currency, and used informal trade to finance their daily activities. On January 4, 1782, the first commercial bank in the U.S., Bank of North America, opened. In 1791, U.S. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton created the Bank of the United States, a national bank intended to maintain American taxes and pay off foreign debt. However, President Andrew Jackson closed the bank in 1832 and redirected all bank assets into U.S. state banks. State banks began printing money rapidly, sparking runaway inflation and leading to the Panic of 1837.

Investment banking began in the 1860s with the establishment of Jay Cooke &amp; Company, one of the first selling agents for government bonds. In 1863, the National Bank Act was passed to create a national currency and a federal banking system, and to make public loans. But at that time not all parts of the country had become states. In Oklahoma Territory, which did not become a state until 1907, Muskogee mayor H.B. Spaulding resigned in 1902 from his position as vice-president of the Territorial Trust and Surety Company, after his Spaulding Mercantile Company was given a charter to found a private bank. Similarly in 1903 several more private banks were founded. One contemporary banker from Oklahoma defending the vitality of these private non-US banks did note that a small number of bank failures had resulted from a &quot;dip in deposits due to partial crop failure&quot;.

In 1913 the Federal Reserve System was established and began executing monetary policy. The Great Depression led to the separation between investment and commercial banking known as the &quot;Glass-Steagall Act&quot;, but the Act was repealed in 1999, leading to the 2008 financial crisis.

==Regulatory agencies==
While most countries have only one bank regulator, in the U.S., banking is regulated at both the federal and state levels in an arrangement known as a dual banking system. Depending on its type of charter and organizational structure, a banking organization may be subject to numerous federal and state banking regulations. Unlike Switzerland and the United Kingdom (where regulatory authority over the banking, securities and insurance industries is combined into one single financial service agency), the U.S. maintains separate securities, commodities, and insurance regulatory agencies—separate from the bank regulatory agencies—at the federal and state levels. U.S. banking regulations address privacy, disclosure, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-usury lending, and the promotion of lending to lower-income populations. Some individual cities also enact their own financial regulation laws (for example, defining what constitutes usurious lending).

===Federal Reserve System===
The central banking system of the United States, called the Federal Reserve System, was created in 1913 by the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act, largely in response to a series of financial panics, particularly a severe panic in 1907. Over time, the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System have expanded and its structure has evolved. Events such as the Great Depression were major factors leading to changes in the system. Its duties today, according to official Federal Reserve documentation, are to conduct the nation&#x27;s monetary policy, supervise and regulate banking institutions, maintain the stability of the financial system and provide financial services to depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions.

===Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation===
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is a United States government corporation created by the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933. It provides deposit insurance, which guarantees the safety of deposits in member banks, up to $250,000 per depositor per bank. , the FDIC insured deposits at 6,800 institutions. The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection functions, and manages banks in receivership (failed banks). Since the start of FDIC insurance on January 1, 1934, no depositor has lost any insured funds as a result of a bank failure.

===Office of the Comptroller of the Currency===
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is a U.S. federal agency established by the National Currency Act of 1863 and serves to charter, regulate, and supervise all national banks and the federal branches and agencies of foreign banks in the United States. Thomas J. Curry was sworn in as the 30th Comptroller of the Currency on April 9, 2012.

===Office of Thrift Supervision===
The Office of Thrift Supervision is a U.S. federal agency under the Department of the Treasury. It was created in 1989 as a renamed version of another federal agency (that was faulted for its role in the Savings and loan crisis). Like other U.S. federal bank regulators, it is paid by the banks it regulates. On July 21, 2011, the Office of Thrift Supervision became part of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

===Consumer Financial Protection Bureau===
==Bank classification==
There are various classifications and charters that a bank can obtain in the United States. Depending on their classification, they may be overseen by the Federal Reserve and supervised by either the FDIC or OCC.

===National bank===

A national bank is a bank that is nationally or federally chartered and is allowed to operate throughout the country in any state. An advantage of holding a National Bank Act charter is that a national bank is not subject to state usury laws intended to prevent predatory lending. (However, see also &quot;Cuomo v. Clearing House Association, L. L. C.&quot;, stating that federal banking regulations do not preempt the ability of states to enforce their own fair-lending laws.) There is currently no federal cap on rates. The federal government only requires that whatever rates, fees, or terms are set by issuers be disclosed to the consumer in accordance with the Truth in Lending Act. A national bank must have &quot;National&quot; or &quot;N.A.&quot; in its corporate name.

===State bank===

A state bank is a bank that is state chartered, meaning that it has been formed under the laws of a specific state government and not the federal government. Although historically state banks could only operate within the state where it was chartered, this distinction slowly eroded. In 2010, this distinction was eliminated with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act. Now state chartered banks may operate branches in any other state. A state chartered bank cannot have &quot;National&quot; or &quot;Federal&quot; in its name.

===State non-member bank===
These are the similar to state chartered banks but are not members of the federal reserve. They are still overseen by the FDIC.

===Federal savings association===

Federal savings associations (FSAs), including federal savings banks (FSBs), are chartered under the Homeowners Refinancing Act of 1933. Although originally focused on residential mortgage lending, they have expanded their business across the range of banking activities. They operate under a distinct regulatory framework from national banks that allows them, for example, to invest directly in real estate development companies. FSAs were originally overseen by the Office of Thrift Supervision, but the Dodd–Frank Act transferred most regulatory jurisdiction to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

===State savings association===
This is similar to a federal savings association but is registered under state law. They are overseen by the FDIC.

===FDIC charter class table===
==Bank mergers and closures==

Bank mergers can happen for many reasons in normal business: for example, to create a single larger bank in which operations of both banks can be streamlined; to acquire another bank&#x27;s brands; or due to regulators closing the institution due to unsafe and unsound business practices or inadequate capitalization and liquidity. Banks may not go bankrupt in the United States. As of October 2008, depositor accounts are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000 per individual per bank. Banks that are in danger of failing are either taken over by the FDIC, or administered temporarily, then sold or merged with other banks. The FDIC maintains a list of banks showing institutions seized by regulators and the assuming institutions.

== Banking privacy ==
In the United States, banking privacy and information security is not protected through a singular law nor is it an unalienable right. The regulation of banking privacy is typically undertaken by a sector-by-sector basis. The most prominent federal law governing banking privacy in the U.S. is the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB). This regulates the disclosure, collection, and use of non-public information by banking institutions. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) serves as the primary protector of banking privacy by fining violators of federal and state banking privacy laws. Unlike banking in Switzerland or other European countries, violations of banking privacy are usually a civil offense not a criminal one. However, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) offers numerous banking privacy provisions within its statutes.

==List of banks==

According to the FDIC, there were 6,799 FDIC-insured commercial banks in the United States as of February 11, 2014. Every member of the Federal Reserve System is listed along with non-members who are also insured by the FDIC. The five largest banks by assets in 2011 were JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs.

<doc id="164453" wikidata="Q1378829" url="?curid=164453" title="Debenture">
<text>In corporate finance, a debenture is a medium- to long-term debt instrument used by large companies to borrow money, at a fixed rate of interest. The legal term &quot;debenture&quot; originally referred to a document that either creates a debt or acknowledges it, but in some countries the term is now used interchangeably with [[bond (finance)|bond]], loan stock or note. A debenture is thus like a certificate of loan or a loan bond evidencing the company&#x27;s liability to pay a specified amount with interest. Although the money raised by the debentures becomes a part of the company&#x27;s capital structure, it does not become share capital. Senior debentures get paid before subordinate debentures, and there are varying rates of risk and payoff for these categories.

Debentures are freely transferable by the debenture holder. Debenture holders have no rights to vote in the company&#x27;s general meetings of shareholders, but they may have separate meetings or votes e.g. on changes to the rights attached to the debentures. The interest paid to them is a charge against profit in the company&#x27;s financial statements.

The term &quot;debenture&quot; is more descriptive than definitive. An exact and all-encompassing definition for a debenture has proved elusive. The English commercial judge, Lord Lindley, notably remarked in one case: &quot;Now, what the correct meaning of &#x27;debenture&#x27; is I do not know. I do not find anywhere any precise definition of it. We know that there are various kinds of instruments commonly called debentures.&quot;

==Attributes==

* A movable property or assets
* Issued by a company in the form of a certificate of indebtedness
* Generally specifying the dates of redemption, repayment of principal and payment of interest
* May or may not create a charge on the assets of the company
* Corporations in the US often issue bonds of around $1,000, while government bonds are more likely to be $5,000

Debentures gave rise to the idea of the rich &quot;clipping their coupons&quot;, which means that a bondholder will present their &quot;coupon&quot; to the bank and receive a payment each quarter (or in whatever period is specified in the agreement).

There are also other features that minimize risk, such as a &quot;sinking fund&quot;, which means that the debtor must pay some of the value of the bond after a specified period of time. This decreases risk for the creditors, as a hedge against inflation, bankruptcy, or other risk factors. A sinking fund makes the bond less risky, and therefore gives it a smaller &quot;coupon&quot; (or interest payment). There are also options for &quot;convertibility&quot;, which means a creditor may turn their bonds into equity in the company if it does well. Companies also reserve the right to call their bonds, which mean they can call it sooner than the maturity date. Often there is a clause in the contract that allows this; for example, if a bond issuer wishes to rebook a 30-year bond at the 25th year, they must pay a premium. If a bond is called, it means that less interest is paid out.

Failure to pay a bond effectively means bankruptcy. Bondholders who have not received their interest can throw an offending company into bankruptcy, or seize its assets if that is stipulated in the contract.

==Security in different jurisdictions==
In the United States, debenture refers specifically to an unsecured corporate bond, i.e. a bond that does not have a certain line of income or piece of property or equipment to guarantee repayment of principal upon the bond&#x27;s maturity. Where security is provided for loan stocks or bonds in the US, they are termed &quot;mortgage bonds&quot;.

In the United Kingdom a debenture is usually secured.

In Canada, a debenture refers to a secured loan instrument where security is generally over the debtor&#x27;s credit, but security is not pledged to specific assets. Like other secured debts, the debenture gives the debtor priority status over unsecured creditors in a bankruptcy.

In Asia, if repayment is secured by a charge over land, the loan document is called a mortgage; where repayment is secured by a charge against other assets of the company, the document is called a debenture; and where no security is involved, the document is called a note or &quot;unsecured deposit note&quot;.

== Convertibility ==

There are two types of debentures:

# Convertible debentures, which are convertible bonds or bonds that can be converted into equity shares of the issuing company after a predetermined period of time. &quot;Convertibility&quot; is a feature that corporations may add to the bonds they issue to make them more attractive to buyers. In other words, it is a special feature that a corporate bond may carry. As a result of the advantage a buyer gets from the ability to convert, convertible bonds typically have lower interest rates than non-convertible corporate bonds.
# Non-convertible debentures, which are simply regular debentures, cannot be converted into equity shares of the liable company. They are debentures without the convertibility feature attached to them. As a result, they usually carry higher interest rates than their convertible counterparts.

<doc id="164455" wikidata="Q528231" url="?curid=164455" title="Goldsmiths, University of London">
<text>Goldsmiths, University of London, legally the Goldsmiths&#x27; College, is a constituent research university of the University of London. It was originally founded in 1891 as The Goldsmiths&#x27; Technical and Recreative Institute by the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths in New Cross, London. It was renamed Goldsmiths&#x27; College after being acquired by the University of London in 1904, and specialises in the arts, design, computing, humanities and social sciences. The main building on campus, known as the Richard Hoggart Building, was originally opened in 1844 and is the site of the former Royal Naval School.

According to Quacquarelli Symonds (2021), Goldsmiths ranks 12th in Communication and Media Studies, 15th in Art &amp; Design and is ranked in the top 50 in the areas of Anthropology, Sociology and the Performing Arts. In 2020, the university enrolled over 10,000 students at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. 37% of students come from outside the United Kingdom and 52% of all undergraduates are mature students (aged 21 or over at the start of their studies). Additionally, around a third of students at Goldsmiths are postgraduate students.

==History==
===Founding===

In 1891, the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, one of the Livery Companies of the City of London, founded &quot;The Goldsmiths&#x27; Technical and Recreative Institute&quot; (more commonly referred to simply as the &quot;Goldsmiths&#x27; Institute&quot;). The Goldsmiths&#x27; Company was established in the 12th century as a medieval guild for goldsmiths, silversmiths, and jewellers. The Livery Company dedicated the foundation of its new Institute to &quot;the promotion of technical skill, knowledge, health and general well-being among men and women of the industrial, working and artisan classes&quot;. The original Institute was based in New Cross at the site of the former Royal Naval School; the building, now known as the &quot;Richard Hoggart Building&quot;, remains the main building of the campus today.

===20th century===

In 1904, the institute was merged with the University of London and was re-established as Goldsmiths&#x27; College (the apostrophe was removed in 1993, and the word &quot;College&quot; dropped in a rebranding in 2006). At this point Goldsmiths was the largest teacher training institution in the country. Training functions were later expanded to include refresher courses for teachers, the University Postgraduate Certificate in Education and an Art teacher&#x27;s Certificate course. The college also ran its own Nursery School.

Shortly after the merger, in 1907, Goldsmiths added a new Arts building, designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield, at the back of the main building. During the Second World War it was decided to evacuate the faculty and students of the college to University College, Nottingham, a decision which proved wise both at the time and in hindsight, since the main building was struck by an incendiary bomb and gutted in 1940 (and not finally repaired until 1947).

During the 1960s, Goldsmiths experienced a rapid expansion in student numbers. It is during this period that Goldsmiths began to establish its reputation in the arts and social science fields, as well as offering a number of new teacher training qualifications. The original main building was expanded, and the Lockwood Building, Whitehead Building, Education Building, Warmington Tower and St James&#x27;s Hall were all built to accommodate the influx of new students. The university also acquired a number of historic buildings in the surrounding area, including the splendid former Deptford Town Hall and Laurie Grove Baths buildings. The Richard Hoggart Building, Deptford Town Hall and the Laurie Grove Baths all retain Grade II listed-building status.

In 1988, Goldsmiths became a full College of the University of London and in 1990 received its Royal Charter.

===21st century===
In 2018, the former boiler house and public laundry of Laurie Grove Baths was refurbished and opened as Goldsmiths CCA.

In August 2019, Goldsmiths announced that it would be removing all beef products from sale and would be charging a 10p levy on bottled water and single-use plastic cups. The changes were introduced as part of the university&#x27;s efforts to become carbon neutral by 2025.

===Financial difficulties and restructuring===
In 2019, Goldsmiths ran a deficit and Frances Corner became Warden; Corner&#x27;s administration was regularly opposed by faculty and students over governance and financial strategy.

In January 2020, Goldsmiths proposed to cut costs by 15% over two years in the &quot;Evolving Goldsmiths&quot; plan by reducing faculty and centralizing administration. According to the Goldsmiths University and College Union (UCU), the plan did not address the causes of the deficit, which it attributed in part to overoptimistic enrolment forecasts and excessive capital expenditures. Furthermore, UCU warned that cuts to faculty would increase the deficit by reducing the income stream of tuition fees, which accounted for 77% of the College&#x27;s revenue in the 2019-2020 fiscal year. &quot;Evolving Goldsmiths&quot; was &quot;closed&quot; in April 2022. In summer 2020, the UCU proposed selling &quot;underused&quot; property to build cash reserves; this was not done. Goldsmiths consolidated and refinanced its loans through NatWest and Lloyds Bank; the banks required the College to consult KPMG to discover cost saving opportunities.

The 2021 &quot;recovery plan&quot; included elimination of 52 faculty and staff positions. Goldsmiths identified additional costs from COVID-19 and over-staffing caused increased competition for student applications following the removal of limits on student numbers by the government. According to the UCU in March 2022, the College refused to stop layoffs although savings from voluntary resignations and maintaining vacancies exceeded the requirements of the banks. Administrative was concentrated into a central hub in 2021-2022; the resulting &quot;chaos&quot; reduced the number of enrolments by international students; international students are a critical revenue steam. Through 2021, Corner also charged the College nearly for taxi fares, with being for personal use.

The &quot;Transformation Programme&quot;, announced in early 2024, included the elimination of 132 full-time, or equivalent, positions, or 17% of all staff, with some departments being reduced by 50%. The plan was expected to be completed by September. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the extent of the cuts would radically change the College&#x27;s culture.

In August 2024, the UCU announced that it had prevented compulsory redundancies for the 2024/25 academic year. 

==Campus and location==

Goldsmiths is situated in New Cross, a highly populated area of south-east London.

The main building, the Richard Hoggart Building, was originally designed as a school (opened in 1844) by the architect John Shaw, Jr (1803–1870). The former Deptford Town Hall building, designed by Henry Vaughan Lanchester and Edwin Alfred Rickards, acquired in 1998, is used for academic seminars and conferences. In addition to this Goldsmiths has built several more modern buildings to develop the campus, including the RIBA award-winning Rutherford Building completed in 1997, the &quot;Ben Pimlott Building&quot; designed by Will Alsop and completed in 2005, and the &quot;Professor Stuart Hall Building&quot; (formerly the &quot;New Academic Building&quot;), which was completed in 2010.

The library, or the Rutherford Building&#x27;, has three floors and gives students access to an extensive range of printed and electronic resources. Goldsmiths&#x27; students, like all other students in the University of London, have full access to the collections at Senate House Library at Bloomsbury in central London.
The seven-storey &quot;Ben Pimlott Building&quot; on New Cross Road, complete with its distinctive &quot;scribble in the sky&quot; (made from 229 separate pieces of metal) has become a signature of modern Goldsmiths. It contains studio and teaching space for the Department of Art, as well as housing the Goldsmiths Digital Studios and the Centre for Cognition, Computation and Culture.

The &quot;Professor Stuart Hall Building&quot;, situated next to the green, is home to the Media and Communications Department and the Institute for Creative and Cultural Entrepreneurship (ICCE). Formerly the &quot;New Academic Building)&quot;, in 2014 it was renamed after cultural theorist Stuart Hall. Facilities include a 250-seat lecture theatre, seminar and teaching rooms, as well as a cafe with outdoor seating.

Goldsmiths has a long history of student-led media platforms, including &quot;Smiths Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Leopard&quot; newspaper, and Wired radio. The student media is run independently by students at the college.

===Student housing===
Accommodation Services offers accommodation within seven halls:
* Loring Hall

===Students&#x27; Union===

The union provides, among other things, catering facilities, a chaplaincy, a medical clinic, an advice service on academic and welfare issues and a state of the art gym for students&#x27; use.

In October 2014, the union faced critical coverage, from student newspaper The Tab after voting down a proposal to commemorate Holocaust Memorial Day, with Education Officer Sarah El-alfy describing it as &quot;Eurocentric&quot; and &quot;colonialist&quot;. El-alfy offered to help put forward a redrafted version of the motion for the following Student Assembly meeting. The Union issued a statement claiming &quot;Redrafting motions and re-entering them at a later date isn&#x27;t unusual in Students&#x27; Unions and shouldn&#x27;t be misinterpreted as opposition.&quot;

In 2015 the student union Welfare and Diversity Officer, Bahar Mustafa, caused a public controversy by banning white people and men from a student union event. Bahar Mustafa caused more public controversy through her justification of the ban, and through her use of the hash tag #KillAllWhiteMen. A group of students petitioned for a vote of no confidence in her, but the petition was signed by less than 3% of the student body and therefore failed to trigger a referendum.

<doc id="164456" wikidata="Q776272" url="?curid=164456" title="Yoshinoya">
<text>is a Japanese multinational fast food chain, and the second-largest chain of &quot;gyūdon&quot; (beef bowl) restaurants. The chain was established in Japan in 1899. Its motto is &quot;Tasty, low-priced, and quick&quot;.

==Etymology and logo==
The kanji 吉 (&quot;yoshi&quot;) means &quot;luck&quot; in Japanese, the kanji 野 (&quot;no&quot;) means &quot;&quot;, and the kanji 家 (&quot;ya&quot;) means &quot;house&quot;.

The founder of the company, , was from the former town of in Osaka Prefecture, and a belief predominates that Yoshino is the origin of the name.

In Japan, the nickname of the restaurant is , which is an abbreviation of .

The logo of Yoshinoya depicts bull horns, and was created by Yoshinoya&#x27;s founder Eikichi Matsuda. The stylized bull horns were derived from the shape of the initial letter in Yoshinoya&#x27;s English name, &quot;Y&quot;. The rope surrounding the horns references Japanese sumo-wrestling, where the word &quot;Yokozuna&quot; is equivalent to &quot;winner,&quot; representing the quality of the food served in Yoshinoya. The surrounding rope is made up of 27 rice grains. The logo as a whole is meant to suggest that Yoshinoya sells the &quot;best beef bowls&quot;.

==History==
Yoshinoya first opened in 1899 at the Nihonbashi fish market in Tokyo. When the market was devastated by the Great Kantō earthquake, Yoshinoya moved to the new Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo in 1926.

The chain opened its first 24-hour store in 1952.

On December 27, 1958, the chain&#x27;s business model was changed from self-employed restaurants to a stock company, as an attempt to gain more profit.

In 1965, the chain earned a million dollars in sales, which led to the idea of expanding the chain&#x27;s operations in Japan.

The chain&#x27;s first franchised store was opened in Shinsaibashi, in 1968.

In 1975, the first American store of the fast-food chain was opened in Colorado. In the early 2000s, Yoshinoya, along with other chains such as McDonald&#x27;s, triggered a price war in Japan by introducing a regular beef bowl dish for , or around .

==Locations==

Yoshinoya has a chain of stores in Japan, the United States, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Mongolia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. Its Malaysian branch closed down in 2021.

===Japan===

In its restaurants in Japan, tables are often counters, and in that case, they take orders over those counters. Chopsticks are provided. The menu includes , , or beef bowls, , raw eggs (to stir and pour on top, sometimes mixed with soy sauce), , miso soup and pickles (called &quot;oshinkō&quot; [お新香] in its menu; a kind of &quot;asazuke&quot;). They also serve red ginger (&quot;beni shōga&quot;), spice, and free of charge. Some menus including raw eggs and miso soup can be taken out.

Some customers make special requests at no extra charge such as: , , , , and .

On June 14, 2011, Yoshinoya in Japan started serving as a standard seasonal menu to be offered until the latter part of July.

===United States===

Yoshinoya entered the United States opening a corporate office in Denver in 1973, and then its first retail location in Denver in 1975. (This location later became &quot;Kokoro&quot;, a similar restaurant run by Mas Torito who had previous experience at a location in Japan.) Yoshinoya is currently only present in California. A location in Las Vegas, Nevada, went out of business in February 2017. A location in Goodyear, Arizona, opened in 2008, but went out of business in December 2011. A Dallas location that opened in June 2011 was Yoshinoya&#x27;s first venture into Texas, but it went out of business in December of that year. The first location east of the Mississippi River opened on 42nd Street off Times Square, New York City, in 2002. Two more stores opened in other Manhattan locations, but Yoshinoya later filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2008, and later all the New York City stores went out of business by January 2012.

In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, indoor dining was temporarily abandoned, with take-away, drive-thru or pick-up service still available.

The main menu in the United States includes the beef bowl, chicken bowl, combo bowl, and shrimp bowl, along with soup and desserts, and has variations such as &quot;beef with vegetables bowls&quot;, &quot;teriyaki chicken bowls&quot;, and barbecue-style plates. Skinless chicken is available upon request. Tempura bowls are no longer available. The menu of Yoshinoya in the U.S. is similar to that in Japan. At a basic level, both companies serve several recipes over a bowl of rice, which includes the trademark beef bowl with very thinly sliced beef plus light sauce and onions.

===Taiwan===
Yoshinoya entered the Taiwanese market in 1987 with the establishment of Taiwan Yoshinoya Co., Ltd. through a joint venture. It opened its first Asian branch outside Japan along Guanqian Road in Zhongzheng District, Taipei in 1988.

===China===

Yoshinoya opened its first Chinese branch at Wangfujing, Beijing in 1992. It was later expanded beginning in 2002, the year of opening of its branches in Shanghai (flagship branch) and Shenzhen.

In 2015, Yoshinoya China Holdings Co., Ltd. was established. As of 2021, there are 390 Yoshinoya branches in China. That same year, Hop Hing Group Holdings, the operator of Yoshinoya and Dairy Queen in China, decided to go private.

===Hong Kong===

The Hong Kong division of Yoshinoya was founded in 1991. Currently, 50 Yoshinoya food stores are split among three main areas: the Hong Kong branch, the New Territories branch, and the Kowloon branch. Fourteen stores are in the Hong Kong branch, 21 stores are in the New Territories branch, and 22 stores are in the Kowloon branch. Each Yoshinoya food store has five working positions: store manager, supervisor, customer service assistant, crew, and production assistant.

Unlike the Yoshinoya in Japan, stores in Hong Kong do not provide table services. Customers order their food at a cashier and collect their food on a tray there, which is the same as in Western fast-food stores and international Food Court outlets elsewhere.

===Philippines===

In 1992, the first Philippine franchisee of Yoshinoya was established, with its first store at Robinsons Galleria, Quezon City that opened on June 12. However, it operated until October 1993. It later changed to direct management.

In 2001, Yoshinoya re-entered the Philippine market through a joint-venture between Yoshinoya and the Century Pacific Group named Yoshinoya Century Pacific Inc. Its first store since re-entry opened in Metro Point Mall, Pasay on December 15, 2001.

In 2021, following the end of the partnership between Yoshinoya and the Century Pacific Group, Yoshinoya formed a new joint-venture with Jollibee Foods Corporation that would serve as the next franchisee of Yoshinoya in the Philippines. Under the new deal, there are plans to open 50 stores in the country in the long-term.

As of 2023, there are seven Yoshinoya stores operating in the Philippines.

=== Indonesia ===

In October 1993, Yoshinoya signed a franchise contract with a leading Indonesian company. The first Indonesian branch opened at Pondok Indah Mall, South Jakarta. However, it operated until July 1998.

In 2009, Yoshinoya re-entered the Indonesian market through another franchise agreement, this time with Multirasa Nusantara Co., Ltd. In October 2010, its first branch since re-entry opened at Grand Indonesia Shopping Town, Central Jakarta. As of November 2024, there are 169 Yoshinoya stores in Indonesia in the Greater Jakarta Metropolitan Area, Surabaya, Bandung, Bali, Semarang, Yogyakarta, Medan, Solo, Malang, Makassar, Manado, Palembang, Pekanbaru, Pontianak, Banjarmasin, Balikpapan, Samarinda, Lombok, Lampung, Bengkulu, Cikarang, Karawang, Garut, Kudus, Madiun, Kediri, Batu, Sidoarjo, Mojokerto, Gresik, Jember, and Singkawang.

=== Singapore ===

In 1997, Yoshinoya entered the Singaporean market through a franchise agreement with Wing Tai Investment &amp; Development Pte. Ltd. In the same year, it opened its first two branches; the first is located at Ngee Ann City (opened in September) and the second one is at Scott&#x27;s Picnic. In 2016, Wing Tai sold the whole shares of the Singaporean franchise to Asia Yoshinoya International Sdn. Bhd. to make it as a subsidiary. As of 2023, there are 11 Yoshinoya stores in Singapore.

=== Cambodia ===
In 2013, the first Yoshinoya franchise in Cambodia opened on King&#x27;s Road in Siem Reap with a franchise agreement signed with Meas Development Co., Ltd.

There are currently around two Yoshinoya stores in Cambodia as of September 2022, with both of them being located in Phnom Penh International Airport and Siem Reap International Airport.

==Impact of BSE==
In late 2001, a domestic bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) incident critically damaged beef bowl sales. In late 2003, Japan suspended imports of American beef due to a BSE incident in Washington, cutting off Yoshinoya&#x27;s main source of short plate (fatty beef) that is the main component of its beef bowl. This forced Yoshinoya to terminate beef bowl sales in Japan for the first time in its history on February 11, 2004.

News of the removal of this item from Yoshinoya&#x27;s menu caused its fans and non-fans alike to queue in massive lines at its restaurants all around Japan to taste what might be their last beef bowl for a long time. Yoshinoya then switched to serving pork bowl (&quot;butadon&quot;) instead of beef. However, its restaurants in the United States continued to serve the beef bowl using American short plate. From December 2, 2004, restaurants in Japan started serving , which use Australian beef, a different sauce, and additional vegetables. These bowls differed from original &quot;beef bowls&quot;, which use American beef.

In December 2005, Japan agreed to remove the restriction on importing beef from the United States. A letter to customers was then put up in restaurants, promising that the beef bowl would return in a few months. In January 2006, imports stopped again because inspectors found banned cattle parts in a veal shipment from the United States. In June 2006, Japan lifted the ban on imports again, and on July 31, 2006, Yoshinoya reposted the letter promising to resume serving the beef bowl in about two months.

On September 18, 2006, Yoshinoya brought back their beef bowl for one day as . This &quot;revival&quot;, however, meant that its beef bowls would be available only the first five days of the month in October and November. On December 1, 2006, they began serving beef bowls daily, albeit at limited hours. These hours were extended once during special campaigns in February and December 2007. By March 17, 2008, Yoshinoya announced that they would resume 24-hour sales of the beef bowl, rolling out through their then 1040 stores nationwide through March 20, 2008. An announcement of banned cattle products in a Californian beef import on April 21, 2008, did not halt the company&#x27;s plans, as they felt they had enough stock from other sources to avoid a recall.
==Controversies==
In August 2008, three Yoshinoya employees in Hong Kong including the store&#x27;s manager were arrested after gang-raping another employee. Footage of the incident was uploaded to the internet.

In 2019, Yoshinoya outlets in Hong Kong were targeted to be boycotted and vandalized by anti-government protesters during 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. Hop Hing Group, based in Hong Kong, is the licensed franchise of Yoshinoya in the city and Mainland China (Beijing and the cities in Southeast China). Its CEO, Marvin Hung, was criticized by protesters for attending a rally for Hong Kong police organized by pro-Beijing camps.

Another major reason that caused the boycott of Yoshinoya is an advertisement posted on Facebook in July 2019. The advertisement featured a traditional Japanese food, &quot;chikuwa&quot;; in Cantonese, the word sounds similar to &quot;dog that tears paper&quot;. As this advert was published after police removed messages on a Lennon Wall in Tai Po, the advertisement was then regarded as poking fun at the police. The staff from Social Strategy Hong Kong who helped create the advertisement was sacked afterwards. Hence, protestors thought that Yoshinoya was politically biased and suppressed freedom of speech. Citizens in support of the protests then started boycotting Yoshinoya.

On April 16, 2022, Yoshinoya managing director Masaaki Itō attracted controversy over his statements as an instructor during a Waseda University marketing course. During the first class while covering marketing strategies for young female consumers Itō reportedly described a &quot;drug-addled virgins strategy&quot; stating: &quot;You have these women straight out of the countryside who don&#x27;t know left or right, while they&#x27;re virgins you get them hooked on gyudon like a methamphetamine addiction. Once a man starts paying for their expensive dinners they&#x27;ll never eat with us again.&quot; Students&#x27; shocked reactions were uploaded to Facebook and attracted fierce criticism online. One user wrote &quot;Let&#x27;s deconstruct this remark – he showed contempt for women, young people, people from rural areas and his own company&#x27;s products. In short, he pretty much insulted most of his company&#x27;s customers.&quot; The course tuition reportedly cost 36,500 yen over 29 days. On April 18, 2022, Yoshinoya issued a public apology, calling Itō&#x27;s statements &quot;profoundly inappropriate&quot;. Itō joined the company in 2018, previously vice-president at Procter &amp; Gamble. On April 19, 2022, the company announced Itō&#x27;s dismissal, calling that his statements &quot;could not be tolerated from the point of view of human rights and gender issues&quot;. The controversy led to Yoshinoya suspending an upcoming marketing campaign starring Nicole Fujita and rollout of a new product that took 10 years to develop.

<text>A chart (sometimes known as a graph) is a graphical representation for data visualization, in which &quot;the data is represented by symbols, such as bars in a bar chart, lines in a line chart, or slices in a pie chart&quot;. A chart can represent tabular numeric data, functions or some kinds of quality structure and provides different info.

The term &quot;chart&quot; as a graphical representation of data has multiple meanings:
* A data chart is a type of diagram or graph, that organizes and represents a set of numerical or qualitative data.
* Maps that are adorned with extra information (map surround) for a specific purpose are often known as charts, such as a nautical chart or aeronautical chart, typically spread over several map sheets.
* Other domain-specific constructs are sometimes called charts, such as the chord chart in music notation or a record chart for album popularity.

Charts are often used to ease understanding of large quantities of data and the relationships between parts of the data. Charts can usually be read more quickly than the raw data. They are used in a wide variety of fields, and can be created by hand (often on graph paper) or by computer using a charting application. Certain types of charts are more useful for presenting a given data set than others. For example, data that presents percentages in different groups (such as &quot;satisfied, not satisfied, unsure&quot;) are often displayed in a pie chart, but maybe more easily understood when presented in a horizontal bar chart. On the other hand, data that represents numbers that change over a period of time (such as &quot;annual revenue from 1990 to 2000&quot;) might be best shown as a line chart.

== Features ==
A chart can take a large variety of forms. However, there are common features that provide the chart with its ability to extract meaning from data.

Typically the data in a chart is represented graphically since humans can infer meaning from pictures more quickly than from text. Thus, the text is generally used only to annotate the data.

One of the most important uses of text in a graph is the title. A graph&#x27;s title usually appears above the main graphic and provides a succinct description of what the data in the graph refers to.

Dimensions in the data are often displayed on axes. If a horizontal and a vertical axis are used, they are usually referred to as the x-axis and y-axis. Each axis will have a scale, denoted by periodic graduations and usually accompanied by numerical or categorical indications. Each axis will typically also have a label displayed outside or beside it, briefly describing the dimension represented. If the scale is numerical, the label will often be suffixed with the unit of that scale in parentheses. For example, &quot;Distance traveled (m)&quot; is a typical x-axis label and would mean that the distance traveled, in units of meters, is related to the horizontal position of the data within the chart.

Within the graph, a grid of lines may appear to aid in the visual alignment of data. The grid can be enhanced by visually emphasizing the lines at regular or significant graduations. The emphasized lines are then called major gridlines, and the remainder is minor grid lines.

A chart&#x27;s data can appear in all manner of formats and may include individual textual labels describing the datum associated with the indicated position in the chart. The data may appear as dots or shapes, connected or unconnected, and in any combination of colors and patterns. In addition, inferences or points of interest can be overlaid directly on the graph to further aid information extraction.

When the data appearing in a chart contains multiple variables, the chart may include a legend (also known as a key). A legend contains a list of the variables appearing in the chart and an example of their appearance. This information allows the data from each variable to be identified in the chart.

== Types ==

=== Common charts ===
Four of the most common charts are:

This gallery shows:

* A histogram consists of tabular frequencies, shown as adjacent rectangles, erected over discrete intervals (bins), with an area equal to the frequency of the observations in the interval; first introduced by Karl Pearson.
* A bar chart is a chart with rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the values that they represent. The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally. The first known bar charts are usually attributed to Nicole Oresme, Joseph Priestley, and William Playfair.
* A pie chart shows percentage values as a slice of a pie; first introduced by William Playfair.
* A line chart is a two-dimensional scatterplot of ordered observations where the observations are connected following their order. The first known line charts are usually credited to Francis Hauksbee, Nicolaus Samuel Cruquius, Johann Heinrich Lambert and William Playfair.
Other common charts are:

=== Less-common charts ===
Examples of less common charts are:

This gallery shows:
* A bubble chart is a two-dimensional scatterplot where a third variable is represented by the size of the points.
* A polar area diagram, sometimes called a Coxcomb chart, is an enhanced form of pie chart developed by Florence Nightingale.
* A radar chart or &quot;spider chart&quot; or &quot;doi&quot; is a two-dimensional chart of three or more quantitative variables represented on axes starting from the same point.
* A waterfall chart also known as a &quot;Walk&quot; chart, is a special type of floating-column chart.
* A tree map where the areas of the rectangles correspond to values. Other dimensions can be represented with color or hue. Smaller areas go to the bottom right corner.
* A streamgraph, a stacked, curvilinear area graph displaced around a central axis
* A GapChart, a time series chart showing evolving gaps and equalities between series. Other dimensions can be represented with color or hue.

=== Field-specific charts ===
Some types of charts have specific uses in a certain field

This gallery shows:
* Stock market prices are often depicted with an open-high-low-close chart with a traditional bar chart of volume at the bottom.
* Candlestick charts are another type of bar chart used to describe price movements of an equity over time.
* A Kagi chart is a time-independent stock tracking chart that attempts to minimise noise.
* Alternatively, where less detail is required, and chart size is paramount, a Sparkline may be used.

Other examples:
* Interest rates, temperatures, etc., at the close of the period are plotted with a line chart.
* Project planners use a Gantt chart to show the timing of tasks as they occur over time.

=== Well-known named charts ===
Some of the better-known named charts are:

Some specific charts have become well known by effectively explaining a phenomenon or idea.
* An Allele chart is a chart originating from the study of genetics to show the interaction of two data points in a grid.
* A Gantt chart helps in scheduling complex projects.
* The Nolan chart and the Pournelle chart classify political philosophies according to two axes of variation.
* A PERT chart is often used in project management.
* The Smith chart serves in radio electronics.

=== Other charts ===
There are dozens of other types of charts. Here are some of them:

One more example: Bernal chart

=== Common plots ===


== Chart software ==
While charts can be drawn by hand, computer software is often used to automatically produce a chart based on entered data. For examples of commonly used software tools, see List of charting software.

<doc id="164464" wikidata="Q475040" url="?curid=164464" title="IBM Series/1">
<text>The IBM Series/1 is a 16-bit minicomputer, introduced in 1976, that in many respects competed with other minicomputers of the time, such as the PDP-11 from Digital Equipment Corporation and similar offerings from Data General and HP. The Series/1 was typically used to control and operate external electro-mechanical components while also allowing for primitive data storage and handling.

Although the Series/1 uses EBCDIC character encoding internally and locally attached EBCDIC terminals, ASCII-based remote terminals and devices could be attached via an I/O card with a RS-232 interface to be more compatible with competing minicomputers. IBM&#x27;s own 3101 and 3151 ASCII display terminals are examples of this. This was a departure from IBM mainframes that used 3270 terminals and coaxial attachment.

Series/1 computers were withdrawn from marketing in 1988 at or near the introduction of the IBM AS/400 line.

A US government asset report dated May 2016 revealed that an IBM Series/1 was still being used as part of the country&#x27;s nuclear command and control systems.

==Models==

Initially, model 1 (4952, Model C), model 3 (IBM 4953) and model 5 (IBM 4955, Model F) processors were provided. Later processors were the model 4 (IBM 4954) and model 6 (IBM 4956). Don Estridge had been the lead manager on the IBM Series/1 minicomputer. He reportedly had fallen out of grace when that project was ill-received.

==Software support==
The Series/1 could be ordered with or without operating system. Available were either of two mutually exclusive operating systems: Event Driven Executive (EDX) or Realtime Programming System (RPS). Systems using EDX were primarily programmed using Event Driven Language (EDL), though high level languages such as FORTRAN IV, PL/I, Pascal and COBOL were also available. EDL delivered output in IBM machine code for System/3 or System/7 and for the Series/1 by an emulator. Although the Series/1 is underpowered by today&#x27;s standards, a robust multi-user operating environment (RPS) was available along with several additional high level languages for the RPS OS. The EDX operating system was originally ported from the System/7. Series/1 was also the first computer that IBM supported for Unix. 

Systems without an operating system were intended for users needing dedicated applications that did not require the full capabilities of either OS. Applications were built using a set of standalone programs, called the Base Program Preparation Facilities, consisting of a macro assembler, a link editor and some basic utilities. A set of modules, called Control Program Support (CPS), was linked with the application to provide task management, data processing input/output support and initial program loading for both disks and diskettes.

==Applications of the Series/1==

The Series/1 was also widely used in manufacturing environments, including General Motors assembly plants. 
Example systems and applications included Manufacturing Information Database (MIDB), Vehicle Component Verification System (VCVS) and Assembly Line Diagnostic Link (ALDL). These systems were connected to plant floor devices and used in the realtime manufacture of vehicles. There was also a Time and Attendance (T&amp;A) system connected to badge readers and employee turnstiles. Series/1 computers were also utilized in the early development of GM&#x27;s Manufacturing Automation Protocol (MAP)

Commercial applications of customized Series/1 computers included an application by State Farm as an intelligent remote terminal in agents&#x27; offices. The processing unit was built into a desk.

The Kmart Corporation also used the Series/1 computer initially for its Kmart Information Network (KIN) which handled the store&#x27;s ordering, invoicing, payroll, inventory, cash, and headquarters to store communications. A separate Series/1 computer was later added in the early phases of its POS roll-out networked with IBM 3683 registers. The Series/1 used for POS systems was short lived as it was quickly replaced by two IBM PC AT computers running either IBM 3683 or IBM 4683 registers.

The Deluxe Corporation also used a bank of Series/1 IBM 4956 computers for each check printing facility which handled the plant&#x27;s business and personal check sales orders and printing operations. Various serial peripherals were attached: Printronix bar-coding printers, MICR Readers, IBM ASCII Terminals. Parallel devices were also used for phototypesetting machines, plate makers and Teletype BRPE punch creating Punched tape; all connecting to the IBM integrated DI/DO digital in/out card. The Series/1 was a good work horse for its day and was operational around the clock in an industrial environment.

Severn Trent Water Authority used a number of Series/1 computers running the RPS operating system to collect and process river telemetry outstation data. It polled each outstation every 6 hours and fed data to applications running on their ICL 2900 mainframe. Unusually, the communications link between the IBM Series/1 machines and the ICL 2900 machine used the ICL CO3 protocol rather than one of the (de facto standard) IBM communication protocols.

Shared Medical Systems (SMS Corp.) in the 1980s used the Series/1 (running EDX) as a channel-attached front-end communications processor for its IBM mainframe-based MVS/CICS hospital information system. In this environment the Series/1 provided customized interfaces to diverse (and generally non-IBM) minicomputer-based hospital systems using asynchronous or binary synchronous communications then commonly found in the laboratory, pharmacy, and other departments. Where necessary, the Series/1 also provided batch connectivity to a centralized TCAM host at SMS headquarters in Malvern, PA. Finally, the Series/1 provided a cost-effective method for remote support of the distributed mainframes using inexpensive ASCII terminals and modems, or IBM PCs equipped with light pens (emulating the 3278/9 terminals). The Series/1 was selected for this application due to challenges with MVS/VTAM and the 37x5 supporting straightforward non-SNA/SDLC communications. These Series/1 systems were connected to the mainframe using the Series/1 to System/370 channel attach module, and connected to non-IBM systems using the Feature-Programmable Multi-line Controller and Adapter.

Internally, IBM used banks of Series/1 computers as communications front end systems on their IBM Information Systems commercial network although back end processing was done with System/370 architecture computers. Also, in some IBM locations, the Series/1 was employed for building access security using ID card readers.

==Series/1 in the Marine Corps==
The United States Marine Corps was a major Series/1 customer in the late 1970s and into the early 1980s. IBM created a ruggedized, portable version with a green plastic and metal housing for field and shipboard use known as the IBM Series I Model 4110. The central processor unit boasted twin 1 megabyte 8 inch floppy disk drives, an 8-inch green monitor with 25 × 80 character resolution (and seldom-used graphics capability) and 16 kilobytes of RAM which was upgraded to 32 kilobytes in 1984. Each standard &#x27;suite&#x27; included the CPU unit, a keyboard, and a 132 column dot-matrix printer with a separate cooling-fan base. This suite was transported in two green, foam-lined, waterproof, locking plastic cases; each weighing over 100 pounds loaded. Among the optional pieces of equipment was a paper tape punch and a magnetic tape reader. Each of these also came with its own case.

The official nomenclature for this equipment was the &#x27;Automated Data Processing Equipment for the Fleet Marine Force&#x27; (ADPE-FMF), but it was universally known as the &#x27;Green Machine&#x27;.

The initial rollout of the equipment was on the west coast at Camp Pendleton in 1981, where the 1st FSSG Information Systems Management Office (ISMO) was formed to develop software and support the new equipment. ISMOs were also formed at 2nd FSSG at Camp Lejeune, 2nd MAW Cherry Point and 3rd FSSG and 1st MAW on Okinawa and were staffed with computer programmers (MOS 4063/4066) whose responsibilities included training of end users, hardware and software troubleshooting and development of local computer applications. Systems development offices were also established at Marine Corps Central Design and Programming Activities (MCCDPA) at the Marine Corps Finance Center, Kansas City, Missouri, at Marine Corps Base Quantico, and at Marine Corps Logistic Base Albany, Georgia. These offices specialized in (respectively) financial, personnel and logistical applications.

The &#x27;Class I&#x27; systems were classified as mainframe systems – and the Series/1 systems that provided field input to them – that were maintained at and distributed from the three CDPAs. The chief among these were JUMPS/MMS (Joint Uniform Military Pay System/Manpower Management System), SASSY (Supported Activities Supply SYstem), and MIMMS (Marine Corps Integrated Maintenance Management System).

Designed primarily as a Source Data Automation (SDA) device for the enhancement of input into &#x27;Class I&#x27; logistics and personnel computer systems, the ADPE-FMF Series/1 provided the power of a minicomputer to the battalion/squadron commander. However, left in the hands of young Marine Corps programmers eager to explore the capabilities of their new equipment, the Series/1 soon proved to be a valuable and flexible workhorse for all manner of tasks at all organizational levels.

Dozens of &#x27;Class II&#x27; systems were locally developed and maintained at the GSUs (General Support Units), later known as ISMOs (Information Systems Management Offices), providing undreamed-of functionality even as far as the company and deployed unit level. Systems developed included the waggishly named &#x27;Standardized Wing Overseas Operation Passenger System&#x27; (SWOOPS – developed to generate Air Force passenger manifests from personnel databases) and &#x27;Universal Random Integrity News Extract&#x27; (URINE – developed to provide names picked randomly from personnel databases for urinalysis screening), FLEAS (FLight Evaluation Administration System).

Although a COBOL compiler was available as part of the software package sold to the Marine Corps with the Series/1, most Class I and Class II systems development was in EDL.

In the middle 1980s, the ADPE-FMF equipment was gradually phased out in favor of IBM-PC class microcomputers running off-the-shelf software and Marine Corps developed applications written in Ada.

== As part of U.S. nuclear weapon command and control systems ==

In May 2016 the United States Government Accountability Office released a document that covered the need to upgrade or replace legacy computer systems within Federal Agencies. According to this document, the Air Force&#x27;s Strategic Automated Command and Control System still uses Series/1 computer to &quot;coordinate[...] the operational functions of the United States&#x27; nuclear forces, such as intercontinental ballistic missiles, nuclear bombers, and tanker support aircraft.&quot; This system still used 8-inch floppy disks, however the Department of Defense planned to update some of the technology by the end of the 2017 fiscal year. In June 2019, the retirement of the 8-inch floppy drives was completed, and they were replaced by a &quot;highly secure solid state digital storage solution&quot; (floppy disk hardware emulator).

<text>Earl Cyril Palmer (October 25, 1924 – September 19, 2008) was an American drummer. Considered one of the inventors of rock and roll, he is a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Palmer was one of the most prolific studio musicians of all time and played on thousands of recordings, including nearly all of Little Richard&#x27;s hits, many of Fats Domino&#x27;s hits, &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot; by the Righteous Brothers, and a long list of classic TV and film soundtracks. According to one obituary, &quot;his list of credits read like a Who&#x27;s Who of American popular music of the last 60 years&quot;.

==Biography==

Born into a show-business family in New Orleans and raised in the Tremé district, Palmer started his career at five as a tap dancer, joining his mother and aunt on the black vaudeville circuit in its twilight and touring the country extensively with Ida Cox&#x27;s Darktown Scandals Review. His father is thought to have been the local pianist and bandleader Walter &quot;Fats&quot; Pichon. Palmer was raised Catholic.

Palmer was 12 when he headlined a floor show at the Rhythm Club in New Orleans, &quot;a very beautiful spot where one can enjoy a floor show, headed by Alvin Howey and Little Earl Palmer&quot;.

Palmer served in the United States Army during World War II and was posted in the European theatre. His biographer wrote,

After the war ended Palmer studied piano and percussion at the Grunewald School of Music in New Orleans, where he also learned to read music. He started drumming with the Dave Bartholomew Band in the late 1940s. Palmer was known for playing on New Orleans recording sessions, including Fats Domino&#x27;s &quot;The Fat Man&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Walkin&quot; (and several more of Domino&#x27;s hits), &quot;Tipitina&quot; by Professor Longhair, &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; by Little Richard (and most of Richard&#x27;s hits), &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy&quot; by Lloyd Price, and &quot;I Hear You Knocking&#x27;&quot; by Smiley Lewis.

His playing on &quot;The Fat Man&quot; featured the backbeat that has come to be the most important element in rock and roll. Palmer said, &quot;That song required a strong afterbeat throughout the whole piece. With Dixieland you had a strong afterbeat only after you got to the shout last chorus…It was sort of a new approach to rhythm music.&quot; Reportedly, he was the first to use the word &quot;funky&quot;, to explain to other musicians that their music should be made more syncopated and danceable.

Palmer left New Orleans for Hollywood in 1957, initially working for Aladdin Records. He soon started working with the Wrecking Crew, a loose-knit group of session musicians who recorded nonstop during their heyday from 1962 to 1968.

The musicians union tracked Palmer playing on 450 dates in 1967 alone.

For more than 30 years he played drums on the soundtracks of many movies and television shows. Amongst the many artists he worked with were Glenn Yarbrough, Frank Sinatra, Phil Spector, Ricky Nelson, Bobby Vee, Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, Eddie Cochran, Ritchie Valens, Bobby Day, Don and Dewey, Jan and Dean, The Beach Boys, Larry Williams, Gene McDaniels, Bobby Darin, Neil Young, 
The Pets, The Byrds when they were still known as The Beefeaters, and B. Bumble and the Stingers. He also played in jazz sessions with David Axelrod, Dizzy Gillespie, Earl Bostic, Onzy Matthews, and Count Basie, and he contributed to blues recordings by B.B. King.

He remained in demand as a drummer throughout the 1970s and 1980s, playing on recordings for albums by Randy Newman, Tom Waits, Bonnie Raitt, Tim Buckley, Little Feat and Elvis Costello.

In 1982, Palmer was elected treasurer of the Local 47 of the American Federation of Musicians. He served until he was defeated in 1984. He was re-elected in 1990.

A biography, &quot;Backbeat: Earl Palmer&#x27;s Story&quot;, by Tony Scherman, was published in 1999.

In later years, Palmer played with a jazz trio in Los Angeles.

Palmer is interviewed on screen and appears in performance footage in the 2005 documentary film &quot;Make It Funky!&quot;, which presents a history of New Orleans music and its influence on rhythm and blues, rock and roll, funk and jazz. In the film, he performs &quot;Rip It Up&quot; with guest vocalist Ivan Neville and house band.

Palmer is also interviewed in the 2008 documentary film about Los Angeles session musicians, &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot;.

Palmer died in September 2008, in Banning, California, after a long illness. He is buried at Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California.

===Personal life===
Palmer married four times and had seven children. At the time of his death, he was survived by his children Earl Cyril Palmer Jr., Donald Alfred Palmer, Ronald Raymond Palmer and Patricia Ann Palmer from his marriage to Catherine Palmer; Shelly Margaret Palmer and Pamela Teresa Palmer from his marriage to Susan Joy Weidenpesch; and Penny Yasuko Palmer from his marriage to Yumiko Makino. He married his fourth wife, Jeline, in 2004.

==Quotations==
* &quot;You could always tell a New Orleans drummer the minute you heard him play his bass drum because he&#x27;d have that parade beat connotation&quot;.
* Late in his career, Palmer appeared in a music video with the band Cracker on the song &quot;I Hate My Generation&quot;. As &quot;Addicted to Noise&quot; tells the story, &quot;According to Cracker leader David Lowery, when Palmer was asked if he would be able to play along with the songs, he gave Lowery a look and said, &#x27;I invented this shit.&#x27;&quot;
* &quot;I&#x27;ve been asked if people could borrow my drums because they like their sound. What the hell, they think the drums play themselves? I said, &#x27;You really want &#x27;em? Really? Okay. Cost you triple scale and cartage.&#x27;&quot;
* When asked by Max Weinberg what more of the recording sessions he had played on Palmer replied, &quot;Don&#x27;t ask me which ones I played on. I should have done like Hal [Blaine]. Hal used to get gold records for all the things he played on. I never did that, you know. I would like to have a room with all those things in them. It would have been nice—show my grandchildren when they grow up so they don&#x27;t say, &#x27;Oh shut up old man and sit down.&#x27; I could just say, &#x27;Look. I don&#x27;t have to tell you nothing. There it is.&#x27;&quot;

==Awards==
In 2000, Palmer became one of the first session musicians to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

<text>Winfield Scott Moore III (December 27, 1931 – June 28, 2016) was an American guitarist who formed The Blue Moon Boys in 1954, Elvis Presley&#x27;s backing band. He was studio and touring guitarist for Presley between 1954 and 1968.

Rock critic Dave Marsh credits Moore with inventing power chords, on the 1957 Elvis hit &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;. Moore was ranked 29th in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time in 2011. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000, the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2007, and the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2015. The Rolling Stones&#x27; guitarist Keith Richards said of Moore:When I heard &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, I knew what I wanted to do in life. It was as plain as day. All I wanted to do in the world was to be able to play and sound like the way Scotty Moore did. Everyone wanted to be Elvis, I wanted to be Scotty.

==Biography==

Winfield Scott Moore III was born near Gadsden, Tennessee, to Mattie (nee Hefley) and Winfield Scott Moore II, as the youngest of four boys by 14 years. He learned to play the guitar from family and friends at age eight. Although underage when he enlisted, Moore served in the United States Navy in China and Korea from 1948 through January 1952.

Moore&#x27;s early background was in jazz and country music. A fan of the guitarist Chet Atkins, Moore led a group called the Starlite Wranglers before Sam Phillips at Sun Records put him together with then-teenage Elvis Presley. The trio was completed with double bass player Bill Black, who brought a &quot;rhythmic propulsion&quot; that much pleased Phillips. In 1954, Moore and Black accompanied Elvis on what would become the first Presley hit, the Sun Studios session cut of &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot;, a recording regarded as a seminal event in rock and roll history.

This session, held on the evening of July 5, 1954, proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. As they were about to give up and go home, Presley took his guitar and launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot;. Moore recalled,All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool and then Bill picked up his bass and he started acting the fool too, and I started playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open...he stuck his head out and said, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; And we said, &quot;We don&#x27;t know.&quot; &quot;Well, back up,&quot; he said, &quot;try to find a place to start and do it again.&quot; Phillips quickly began taping as this was the sound he had been looking for.During the next few days, the trio recorded a bluegrass number, Bill Monroe&#x27;s &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot;, again in a distinctive style and employing an echo effect that Sam Phillips called &quot;slapback&quot;. A single was pressed with &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; on the A side and &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot; as the B-side.

Phillips&#x27; rhythm-centered vision led him to steer Moore away from Chet Atkins&#x27; style, the one which had been adopted by Merle Travis&#x27;s finger-picking style, now dubbed as &quot;travis picking&quot;, which he deemed fine for pop or country but not for the simple, gutsy sound Phillips was aiming at. &quot;Simplify&quot; was the keyword.

By his performance at the Louisiana Hayride in October 1954, Presley, Black and Moore were called the Blue Moon Boys.

For a time, Moore served as Presley&#x27;s personal manager. They were later joined by the drummer D.J. Fontana. 

Beginning in July 1954, the Blue Moon Boys toured and recorded throughout the American South. Subsequently, Elvis&#x27;s popularity rose amongst teenage girls, they began touring nationwide, appearing on distinguished programs such as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, which, at the time, was the hallmark for success for young artists. On April 3, 1956, they performed &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll,&quot; &quot;Heartbreak Hotel,&quot; and &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; on &quot;The Milton Berle Show.&quot; Elvis and the band appeared on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; in a comedy sketch performing &quot;Hound Dog&quot; to an actual hound dog. Presley was prohibited from doing the gyrations that elicited screams from the audience, which would produce good reviews, but those were nothing compared to the scandals Elvis and the band would face. Elvis never understood why the girls screamed out of control when he sang. It was Moore who told him why. &quot;It&#x27;s your leg, man. The way you shake your left leg.&quot;

Moore played on many of Presley&#x27;s most famous recordings, including &quot;That&#x27;s All Right,&quot; &quot;Good Rockin&#x27; Tonight,&quot; &quot;Milkcow Blues Boogie,&quot; &quot;Baby Let&#x27;s Play House&quot; (where Elvis introduced the vocal stutter to the music pundits), &quot;Heartbreak Hotel,&quot; &quot;Mystery Train,&quot; &quot;Blue Suede Shoes,&quot; &quot;Hound Dog,&quot; &quot;Too Much,&quot;&quot;Jailhouse Rock,&quot; and &quot;Hard Headed Woman.&quot; He called his solo on &quot;Hound Dog&quot; &quot;ancient psychedelia.&quot;

During the filming and recording of &quot;Loving You&quot; in Hollywood in early 1957, Moore and Black drove boredom away by jamming with Presley between takes but they usually saw little of Presley, although he stayed only a couple of floors away from them. They grew hurt and resentful at the separation, which they came to perceive as willfully organized.

They did not accompany Presley on the soundtrack recordings for his first movie, &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;, because 20th Century Fox had refused to allow him to use his own band, with the excuse that the band could not play country. By December 1956, they were experiencing financial difficulties because there had been few performances since August. When there were performances, they received $200 a week (US$ in dollars), but only $100 (US$ in dollars) when they were not performing. Moore and his wife were forced to move in with her three sisters and brother-in-law. In an interview with the Memphis &quot;Press-Scimitar&quot; that December, they spoke about their lack of performances and contact with Presley himself. The interview was the vehicle for their announcement that management had given them permission to record an instrumental album of their own, which RCA Victor would release, permission which was needed in order for them to appear as a group without Presley.

During Presley&#x27;s 1957 tour of Canada, the concert promoter Oscar Davis offered to represent them as their manager. Moore and Black, who had seen Presley become a millionaire while they were still earning $200 or $100 a week themselves, were willing to work with Davis but the backing vocalists, the Jordanaires, were not amenable, because they did not trust Davis. They had usually been living off $100 a week since 1956, as had Elvis; however, once Hollywood had been introduced, Presley&#x27;s salary experienced a dramatic rise, while Moore and Black continued at $100 a week. They only received one raise in two years and with the lack of personal appearances it was getting to be too financially difficult.

Tension hit a breaking point right after the September 1957 sessions for Presley&#x27;s first Christmas album. Moore and Black had been promised an opportunity to jam with Elvis after the session, on Presley&#x27;s studio time. Yet when the session was over, they were told to pack up and leave. That same evening, the duo wrote a letter of resignation.

They deduced (correctly) the Colonel was working against them. They had been denied virtually all access to Presley and felt as if &quot;they were no longer even permitted to talk to him&quot;. Colonel Parker didn&#x27;t interfere but RCA Victor executive Steve Sholes, who had little regard for the ability of Presley&#x27;s band, hoped the separation would be permanent. Back in Memphis, a journalist found out about the split and interviewed the duo. Presley responded to the article with a press statement wishing them good luck, saying things could have been worked out if they had come to him first instead of bringing it to the press. In an accompanying interview, Presley revealed that during the previous two years, people had tried to convince him to get rid of his band so from his point of view he had stayed loyal to them.

Presley was scheduled to appear in Tupelo within the next two weeks and started to audition new musicians. He performed with Hank Garland on guitar and D.J. Fontana&#x27;s friend, Chuck Wiginton, on bass, but despite their musical ability, it didn&#x27;t feel the same to him. The week after his Tupelo engagement he hired back Moore and Black on a per diem basis. In the meantime, the duo had played &quot;a miserable two-week engagement at the Dallas State Fair.&quot; Moore declared there were no hard feelings, though Presley himself, according to biographer Guralnick, seems to have taken a more melancholic view. One day, Guralnick writes, Presley heard &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; on the radio &quot;and declared, &#x27;Elvis Presley and his one-man-band,&#x27; with a rueful shake of his head.&quot;

Moore and the Blue Moon Boys performed (and had additional small walk-on and speaking roles) with Presley in four of his movies (&quot;Loving You&quot;, &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;, &quot;King Creole&quot;, and &quot;G.I. Blues&quot;) filmed in 1957, 1958, and 1960.

Early in 1958, when Presley was drafted, Moore began working at Fernwood Records and produced a hit record, &quot;
Tragedy,&quot; for Thomas Wayne Perkins, the brother of Johnny Cash&#x27;s guitarist Luther Perkins. 

In 1960, Moore commenced recording sessions with Presley at RCA Victor and also served as production manager at Sam Phillips Recording Service, which involved supervising all aspects of studio operation. Moore played on such Presley songs as &quot;Fame and Fortune,&quot; &quot;Such a Night,&quot; &quot;Frankfort Special,&quot; &quot;Surrender,&quot; &quot;I Feel So Bad,&quot; &quot;Rock-A-Hula Baby&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me Quick,&quot; &quot;Good Luck Charm,&quot; &quot;She&#x27;s Not You&quot;, &quot;(You&#x27;re the) Devil in Disguise&quot;, and &quot;Bossa Nova Baby.&quot; Moore remained as a guitarist for the majority of the songs recorded after Presley&#x27;s work was dominated by Hollywood sessions. Moore mostly played rhythm guitar, however, with his last lead guitar work occurring by 1962 with &quot;(You&#x27;re the) Devil in Disguise&quot;. Moore also played on sessions for Roy Orbison (most notably on “Crying”) and others.

In 1964, Moore released a solo album on Epic Records called &quot;The Guitar That Changed the World&quot;, played using his Gibson Super 400. Phillips was initially unaware of the project, and once he got wind of it, Moore was fired. He reunited with Fontana and Presley for the NBC television special known as the &quot;&#x27;68 Comeback Special&quot;, again with his Gibson Super 400, which was also played by Presley. This special was the last time these musicians would play with Presley, and for Moore, it was the last time he ever saw him.

==Style and influence==
Moore&#x27;s playing on his Gibson with his unique finger-picking style using a thumbpick, as on the Sun and early RCA Victor recordings, represented a move of the Chet Atkins style into a more rockabilly mode.

Of Presley&#x27;s first single &quot;That&#x27;s All Right,&quot; the critic Dave Marsh wrote that &quot;Moore&#x27;s guitar—especially the solo—toughens the song up and forces it to rock.&quot; Though Marsh credits Presley with introducing &quot;the vocal stutter&quot; on &quot;Baby Let&#x27;s Play House,&quot; Marsh states, &quot;Other than that, it&#x27;s guitarist Scotty Moore&#x27;s show and he sets a few precedents of his own.&quot; Of the other Sun recordings, Marsh cited the &quot;urgent Scotty Moore guitar lick&quot; as a standout element of &quot;Mystery Train,&quot; while &quot;Good Rockin&#x27; Tonight&quot; displays his &quot;stinging guitar.&quot; 

In Marsh&#x27;s description, the teamwork of Moore and other musicians turned the 1957 single and movie title song &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; into an &quot;enduring smash for at least three reasons: the great walking bass, Scotty Moore&#x27;s invention of power chording, and D.J. Fontana&#x27;s drumming, which is halfway between strip joint rhumba and the perfect New Orleans shuffle.&quot;

On the 1961, post-Army Presley single &quot;Little Sister,&quot; &quot;Scotty Moore comes up with his greatest post-Sun guitar lick and not only converts a comparatively humdrum Pomus-Shuman teen love triangle number into the best of Elvis&#x27;s early sixties hits but (together with D.J. Fontana&#x27;s heavy-footed thunderation) gives more than a few pointers toward the metallic rock to come.&quot; According to Presley discographer Ernst Jorgensen, however, Hank Garland was the lead guitarist on the song, while Moore played acoustic guitar.

Moore is given credit as a pioneer rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll lead guitarist, though he characteristically downplayed his own innovative role in the development of the style. &quot;It had been there for quite a while,&quot; recalled Moore. &quot;Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around Jackson and I know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old.&quot; Paul Friedlander describes the defining elements of rockabilly, which he similarly characterizes as &quot;essentially... an Elvis Presley construction:&quot; &quot;the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [of] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [of] country.&quot; In &quot;That&#x27;s All Right,&quot; the Presley trio&#x27;s first record, Moore&#x27;s guitar solo, &quot;a combination of Merle Travis–style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion.&quot;

Although some lead guitarists and vocalists, such as Chuck Berry and the blues legend B. B. King, had gained popularity by the 1950s, Presley rarely played his own lead while performing, instead providing rhythm guitar and leaving the lead duties to Moore. As a guitarist, Moore was a noticeable presence in Presley&#x27;s performances despite his introverted demeanor. He became an inspiration to many subsequent popular guitarists, including George Harrison, Jeff Beck, and Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones. While Moore was working on his memoir with co-author James L. Dickerson, Richards told Dickerson, &quot;Everyone else wanted to be Elvis—I wanted to be Scotty.&quot; Richards has stated many times (in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine and in his autobiography, &quot;Life&quot;) that he could never figure out how to play the &quot;stop time&quot; break and figure that Moore played on &quot;I&#x27;m Left, You&#x27;re Right, She&#x27;s Gone&quot; (Sun) and that he hopes it will remain a mystery.

===Equipment===
Earlier on, Scotty used a &#x27;52 Telecaster, which he traded at the Houck Piano Company in Memphis for the now-iconic gold-colored Gibson ES-295 (nicknamed &quot;The Guitar That Changed the World&quot;). He made some modifications to the guitar, mainly he was unhappy with the Les Paul style bridge, which he replaced with a Melita-Synchro Sonic model with adjustable saddles, which enabled fine-tuning of each string; but this bridge further required a different tailpiece--Scotty opted for a Kluson trapeze model as utilized by Gibson on the ES-125. This is the guitar heard on all but the later Sun sessions with Elvis. In July 1955, Scotty traded this guitar for a blonde-finish 1954 Gibson L-5 CESN, with which he recorded the last Sun sessions (including &quot;Mystery Train&quot;), as well as several RCA cuts, and in 1957 he switched to a Gibson Super 400. This Super 400 was the guitar heard on the &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; and &quot;King Creole&quot; soundtracks, as well as the earlier post-army sessions.

One of the key pieces of equipment in Moore&#x27;s sound on many of the recordings with Presley, besides his guitars, was the Ray Butts EchoSonic, first used by Chet Atkins, a guitar amplifier with a tape echo built in, which allowed him to take his trademark slapback echo on the road. It is important to note, however, that this amplifier was not used until 1955--which means that the earlier Sun sessions (including &quot;That&#x27;s All Right Mama&quot;) were not recorded with this amplifier.

===Last years and death===
Moore had to give up playing guitar a few years before his death because of arthritis. Quite likely his last appearance on a recording came as a guest on the 2011 album &quot;61 &amp; 49&quot; by the Mike Eldred Trio. That group&#x27;s leader, guitarist Mike Eldred, had been a friend of Moore&#x27;s since the early 1990s. As a member of Lee Rocker&#x27;s Big Blue, Eldred also helped bring Moore (then semi-retired) aboard as a guest on that group&#x27;s first album.

Moore died on June 28, 2016, in Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 84.

==Songwriting==
Scotty Moore co-wrote the songs &quot;My Kind of Carrying On&quot; and &quot;Now She Cares No More&quot; which were released as Sun 202 on Sun Records in 1954 when he was a member of the group Doug Poindexter and the Starlite Wranglers with Bill Black as the double bass player. He co-wrote the instrumental &quot;Have Guitar Will Travel&quot; in 1958 with Bill Black, which was released as a 45 single, 107, on the Fernwood Records label.

==Awards==
For his pioneering contribution, Moore has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. In 2000, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

<doc id="164468" wikidata="Q9640723" url="?curid=164468" title="Commercial aviation">
<text>Commercial aviation is the part of civil aviation that involves operating aircraft for remuneration or hire, as opposed to private aviation.

==Definition==
Commercial aviation is not a rigorously defined category. All commercial air transport and aerial work operations are regarded as commercial aviation, as well as some general aviation flights. 

An aircraft operation involving the transportation of people, goods, or mail for payment or hiring is referred to as commercial air transport. Both scheduled and unscheduled air transport operations are included. An aircraft used for specialized services including agriculture, construction, photography, surveying, observation and patrol, search and rescue, advertising, etc. is referred to as aerial work.

 General aviation includes commercial activities such as flight instruction, aerial work, and corporate and business aviation, as well as non-commercial activities such as recreational flying.

Most commercial aviation activities require at minimum a commercial pilot licence, and some require an airline transport pilot licence (ATPL). In the US, the pilot in command of a scheduled air carriers&#x27; aircraft must hold an ATPL. In the UK, pilots must hold an ATPL before they be pilot in command of an aircraft with 9 or more passenger seats.

Not all activities involving pilot remuneration require a commercial pilot licence. For example, in European Union Aviation Safety Agency states and the UK it is possible to become a paid flight instructor with only a private pilot licence. Nonetheless, in the UK, flight instruction is considered a commercial operation.

It is the purpose of the flight, not the aircraft or pilot, that determines whether the flight is commercial or private. For example, if a commercially licensed pilot flies a plane to visit a friend or attend a business meeting, this would be a private flight. Conversely, a private pilot could legally fly a multi-engine complex aircraft carrying passengers for non-commercial purposes (no compensation paid to the pilot, and a &quot;pro rata&quot; or larger portion of the aircraft operating expenses paid by the pilot).

==Potential radiation exposure==
The magnetosphere guides cosmic ray and solar energetic particles to polar latitudes, while high-energy charged particles enter the mesosphere, stratosphere, and troposphere. These energetic particles at the top of the atmosphere shatter atmospheric atoms and molecules, creating harmful lower-energy particles that penetrate deep into the atmosphere and create measurable radiation. All aircraft flying above 8 km (26,200 feet) altitude are exposed to these particles. The dose exposure is greater in polar regions than in mid-latitude and equatorial regions. When a space weather event causes radiation exposure to exceed the safe level set by aviation authorities, the aircraft&#x27;s flight path is diverted.

While the most significant — but highly unlikely — health consequences of atmospheric radiation exposure include death from radiation-induced cancer due to long-term exposure, many lifestyle-degrading and career-impacting cancer forms can also occur. A cancer diagnosis can have significant career impact for a commercial pilot. A cancer diagnosis can ground a pilot temporarily or permanently. International guidelines from the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) have been developed to mitigate this statistical risk. The ICRP recommends effective dose limits of a 5-year average of 20 mSv per year with no more than 50 mSv in a single year for nonpregnant, occupationally exposed persons, and 1 mSv per year for the general public. Radiation dose limits are not engineering limits. In the U.S., they are treated as an upper limit of acceptability and not a regulatory limit.

Measurement of radiation at altitudes above 8 km (26,000 ft) has historically been done by instruments that record the data on board where the data are then processed later on the ground. However, a system of real-time radiation measurement has been developed through the NASA Automated Radiation Measurements for Aerospace Safety (ARMAS) program. ARMAS has flown hundreds of flights since 2013, mostly on research aircraft, and sent the data to the ground through Iridium satellite links. The goal is to assimilate this data into physics-based global radiation models, e.g., NASA&#x27;s Nowcast of Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation System (NAIRAS), so as to provide the weather of the radiation environment rather than the climatology.

==History==
===United States===
====Origins====

Harry Bruno and Juan Trippe were early promoters of commercial aviation.

The Air Commerce Act of 1926 began to regularize commercial aviation by establishing standards, facilitation, and promotion. An Aeronautical Branch was established in the Department of Commerce with William P. MacCracken Jr. as director. To promote commercial aviation, he told town fathers that &quot;Communities without airports would be communities without airmail.&quot;

Writing for &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in 1929, he noted &quot;Commercial aviation is the first industry inspired by hero-worship and built upon heros&quot;. He cited the promotion in South America by Herbert Dargue in early 1927. After his 1927 trans-Atlantic flight, Charles Lindbergh made a tour of the contiguous United States, paid for by the Daniel Guggenheim Foundation for the Promotion of Aeronautics. From that point, commercial aviation took off:

Roads were choked on Sundays, for weeks afterward, by motorists trying to get to Lambert Field, Lindbergh&#x27;s home port in Saint Louis, to buy their first air hop. Hundreds of thousands of you went aloft for the first time that summer.

The Aeronautical Branch was charged with issuing commercial pilot licenses, airworthiness certificates, and with investigating air accidents.

====1920s and 30s====

Many small regional airlines operated in the 1920s in the United States. Many of them merged or were acquired late in the decade by the first developing nationwide airlines, such as Eastern Airlines, Pan Am, American Airlines, and TWA.

====After 1945====

After World War II, commercial aviation grew rapidly, using mostly ex-military aircraft to transport people and cargo. The experience used in designing heavy bombers such as the Boeing B-29 Superfortress and Avro Lancaster could be used for designing heavy commercial aircraft. The Douglas DC-3 also made for easier and longer commercial flights. The first commercial jet airliner to fly was the British de Havilland DH.106 Comet. By 1952, the British state airline British Overseas Airways Corporation had introduced the Comet into scheduled service. While a technical achievement, the plane suffered a series of highly public failures, including the crashing of BOAC Flight 781 and South African Airways Flight 201. By the time the problems were overcome, other jet airliner designs had already taken to the skies.

=== Latin America ===

==== Pre-war ====
Inspired by the major players such as the United States, the Soviet Union, Russia, France and Britain in the aviation industry. In the 1910s, Brazil and Argentina were among the first Latin American countries to possess the instruments of aircraft that were not all locally made, yet the aircraft was locally congregated. At that time, many individuals were interested to be pilots in Latin American countries, yet there were not sufficient resources and funding to support and promote the best interests of the aviation industry. Amidst these obstacles, Argentina and the Dominican Republic made efforts in creating jet aviation rather than creating and using propeller planes. In 1944, the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation attended by all Latin American countries except Argentina drafted the clauses of aviation law. The introduction of the jet fighter F-80 by the US in 1945 pushed the Latin American countries even further away from development of aviation industry because it was simply expensive to recreate the sophisticated technology of F-80.

==== Post-war ====
The Latin American Civil Aviation Commission (LACAC) was formed in December 1973 &quot;intended to provide civil aviation authorities in the region with an adequate framework for cooperation and coordination of activities related to civil aviation&quot;. In 1976, about seven percent of the world logged in the Latin American and Caribbean region. This contributed to the increase of average annual rate of air traffic. Subsequently, higher passenger load factor decided the profitability of these airlines.

According to C. Bogolasky, airline pooling agreements between Latin American airlines contributed to better financial performance of the airlines. The economic problems related to the &quot;airline capacity regulation, regulation of non-scheduled operations, tariff enforcement, high operating costs, passenger and cargo rates.&quot;

== Corporate social responsibility ==

Corporate social responsibility comprises an umbrella of responsibilities of an organization towards its community, stakeholders and shareholders. Organizations who are socially responsible fulfill their triple bottom line obligations and dedicate efforts to minimize negative impact on stakeholders and shareholders. According to &quot;The Pyramid of Corporate Social Responsibility&quot; by Archie B. Carroll, there are four steps of social responsibility. First, economic responsibility of an organization is to produce profit and maximize the growth of an organization. Second, legal responsibility of an organization is to be compliant with all the laws and regulations. Third, ethical responsibility of an organization to create and follow standards of right decision-making considering how it affects all the stakeholders. Fourth, philanthropic responsibility of an organization to help the community and stakeholders by &quot;giving back&quot;. The extent of fulfilling the four responsibilities defines the corporate citizenship of an organization.

Delta and LATAM Airlines were the only two airlines listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, LATAM being the only airline company in the world to achieve 100% scores for efficiency, reliability and climate strategy in their corporate sustainability assessment. LATAM promotes their corporate citizenship in their 2016 Sustainability report. LATAM is affiliated with 6 countries which are Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, and Peru. LATAM accounts for 95% of South America&#x27;s air traffic.

<text>The Fieseler Fi 103R, code-named Reichenberg, was a German manned version of the V-1 flying bomb (more correctly known as the &quot;Fieseler Fi 103&quot;). It was developed towards the end of the Second World War and was intended to be used as a human-guided bomb in suicidal attacks against the advancing Allies.

The Fi 103R started development in 1944 at a time when Germany was anticipating a major naval landing by the Allies in western Europe. It was believed that a disposable aircraft armed with of explosives would potentially inflict heavy damage on important targets such as enemy shipping. However, these attacks would have very likely involved the death of the pilot, who was expected to exit the aircraft and parachute away mere moments before the aircraft&#x27;s impact. These pilots were reportedly to be volunteers and aware of the risk to their own lives. The &quot;Leonidas Squadron&quot;, V. &quot;Gruppe&quot; of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s Kampfgeschwader 200, was established in early 1944 to conduct these attacks.

Initially, the development of a manned Fi 103 had been considered but passed over for the rival Messerschmitt Me 328 project. However, this aircraft had fundamental difficulties with its pulsejet propulsion, which led to officials opting to switch focus to the Fi 103R&#x27;s development. Pilots were trained using gliders, including specially-adapted ones capable of high-speed diving. It was intended that their training would then continue with the &quot;R-III&quot;, a twin-seat powered model of the Fi 103R. In September 1944, the maiden flight of the Fi 103R occurred, which resulted in a crash; a second aircraft flown on the next day also crashed. One month later, development was shelved at the direct order of Hitler, who had been encouraged by Albert Speer and Werner Baumbach not to pursue suicide attacks.

== History ==

=== Background ===

During the latter part of the Second World War, it was becoming increasingly clear that Germany was on the defensive and that increasingly drastic measures would be needed just to maintain the status quo against the Allies. In February 1944, Adolf Hitler was initially dismissive of the need to resort to tactics such as suicide attacks, as was advocated by figures such as Otto Skorzeny, Hanna Reitsch, and Hajo Herrmann, but he did authorise the formation of a squadron to prepare for such missions. Accordingly, the &quot;Leonidas&quot; Squadron, a part of Kampfgeschwader 200, was established to be this suicide squadron. Volunteers for this squadron were required to sign a declaration which said, &quot;I hereby voluntarily apply to be enrolled in the suicide group as part of a human glider-bomb. I fully understand that employment in this capacity will entail my own death.&quot;

The concept called for an aircraft that would be armed with a single explosive device that would detonate upon impact with the target, which was typically envisioned to be Allied shipping. Two different aircraft were quickly considered to be the most suitable options available, the Messerschmitt Me 328 and the Fieseler Fi 103 (better known as the V-1 flying bomb), although both required development work. Officials opted to pass over the Fi 103 in favour of the Me 328. Being largely composed of wood and conceived of as potentially suitable for using multiple means of propulsion, the Me 328 had been worked on since 1941.

However, difficulties were encountered in the Me 328 during prototype testing, the vibration caused by its pulsejet engines having been a particular source of issues, leading to work being suspended. The project had also encountered political opposition from figures such as the head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, who sought the programme&#x27;s termination. The programme was placed under the supervision of the SS, but was not terminated at this point; instead, Skorzeny, who had been investigating the possibility of using crewed torpedoes against Allied shipping, was personally briefed by Hitler to revive the project.

Skorzeny played a key role in the programme&#x27;s reappraisal, which included its reorientation towards the Fi 103. The project was given the codename &quot;Reichenberg&quot; after the capital of the former Czechoslovakian territory &quot;Reichsgau Sudetenland&quot; (present-day Liberec), while the aircraft themselves were referred to as &quot;Reichenberg-Geräte&quot; (Reichenberg apparatus). It has been claimed that one reason for the switch towards the Fi 103R was its ability to offer the pilot a slim chance of survival.

=== DFS development ===

In the summer of 1944, the Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug (German Research Institute for Sailplane Flight) at Ainring took on the task of developing a crewed version of the Fi 103, an example was made ready for testing within days and a production line was established at Dannenberg.

The V-1 was transformed into the &quot;Reichenberg&quot; via the addition of a compact cockpit at the point of the fuselage that was immediately ahead of the pulsejet&#x27;s intake, where the compressed-air cylinders were fitted on a standard V-1. This cramped cockpit was outfitted with only basic flight instrumentation, along with a bucket seat composed of plywood. The single-piece canopy incorporated an armoured front panel and opened to the side to allow entry. The two displaced compressed-air cylinders were replaced by a single one, fitted in the rear in the space which normally accommodated the V-1&#x27;s autopilot. At no point was any landing gear fitted to the aircraft. The wings were fitted with hardened edges that would cut the cables of barrage balloons.

It was proposed that a He 111 bomber would carry either one or two Reichenbergs beneath its wings, releasing them close to the target. The pilots would then steer their aircraft towards the target, jettisoning the cockpit canopy shortly before impact and bailing out. It was estimated that the chances of a pilot surviving such a bailout were less than 1% due to the proximity of the pulsejet&#x27;s intake to the cockpit.

== Operational history ==

=== Training ===
Trainees were initially prepared using ordinary gliders to get them used to handling unpowered flight; specially-adapted gliders with shortened wings would be used to provide more advanced training. Amongst other things, these adaptations enabled them to dive at speeds of up to . Once sufficient proficiency had been demonstrated, the last stage of training would be conducted using the dual-control R-II. According to Christopher, there was no shortage of volunteers for the programme despite the open acknowledgement that the mission involved their near-certain demise.

Training began on the R-I and R-II and, although landing them on a skid was difficult, the aircraft handled well and it was anticipated that the Leonidas Squadron would soon be using the machines. On 28 July 1944, Albert Speer wrote to Hitler, stating his opposition to the wasting of both men and machines on the Allies in France and suggested their deployment to be more worthwhile against Soviet power stations on the Eastern Front. These were not the only alternative targets that were proposed; other potential uses for the Fi 103R included ramming enemy bombers. Such was the interest in this latter role that formal evaluations were conducted in the final months of the conflict.

=== Test flights ===

During September 1944, the first real flight was performed at the &quot;Erprobungsstelle Rechlin&quot;, the Reichenberg being dropped from a Heinkel He 111. However, this flight ended in a crash, which was attributed to the pilot having lost control of the aircraft after accidentally jettisoning the canopy. The next day, a second flight was conducted that also ended in a crash. The technical department struggled to explain these losses, although there were suspicions that the Fi 103R&#x27;s flight characteristics could make landing particularly challenging.

Seeking to avoid further accidents while also hoping to uncover the source of these difficulties, further test flights were carried out by Heinz Kensche and Hanna Reitsch, both of whom were particularly accomplished test pilots. Reitsch herself experienced several crashes, which she survived unscathed. On 5 November 1944, during the second test flight of the R-III, a wing detached from the aircraft due to the vibrations; Kensche managed to parachute to safety, albeit with some difficulty due to the cramped cockpit. It was concluded that the Fi 103R had a relatively high stall speed and that pilots, unaware of this, had been attempting to land at speeds that were too slow for the aircraft to maintain stable flight.

=== Cancellation ===
During October 1944, Werner Baumbach assumed command of KG 200, and quickly opted to shelve the Reichenberg in favour of the Mistel project. By this point, the Allies had consolidated their position in France and thus the value of attacking potential invasion fleets was no longer considered to be as pressing as dealing with land warfare. On 15 March 1945, in a meeting between Baumbach, Speer, and Hitler, the latter was convinced that suicide missions were not part of the German warrior tradition; later that same day, Baumbach ordered the disbandment of the Reichenberg unit.

== Variants ==
There were five variants: By October 1944 about 175 R-IVs were ready for action.
* R-I – The basic single-seat unpowered glider.
* R-II – Unpowered glider; had a second cockpit fitted where the warhead would normally be.
* R-III – A pulsejet-powered two-seater.
* R-IV – The standard-powered operational model.
* R-V – Powered trainer for the Heinkel He 162 (shorter nose).

<doc id="164477" wikidata="Q49888" url="?curid=164477" title="Solomon Burke">
<text>Solomon Vincent McDonald Burke (born James Solomon McDonald, March 21, 1940 – October 10, 2010) was an American singer who shaped the sound of rhythm and blues as one of the founding fathers of soul music in the 1960s. He has been called &quot;a key transitional figure bridging R&amp;B and soul&quot;, and was known for his &quot;prodigious output&quot;.

He had a string of hits including &quot;Cry to Me&quot;, &quot;If You Need Me&quot;, &quot;Got to Get You Off My Mind&quot;, &quot;Down in the Valley&quot;, and &quot;Everybody Needs Somebody to Love&quot;. Burke was referred to honorifically as &quot;King Solomon&quot;, the &quot;King of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Soul&quot;, &quot;Bishop of Soul&quot;, and the &quot;Muhammad Ali of Soul&quot;. Due to his minimal chart success in comparison to other soul music greats such as James Brown, Wilson Pickett, and Otis Redding, Burke has been described as the genre&#x27;s &quot;most unfairly overlooked singer&quot; of its golden age. Atlantic Records executive Jerry Wexler referred to Burke as &quot;the greatest male soul singer of all time&quot;.

Burke&#x27;s most famous recordings, which spanned five years in the early 1960s, bridged the gap between mainstream R&amp;B and grittier R&amp;B. Burke was &quot;a singer whose smooth, powerful articulation and mingling of sacred and profane themes helped define soul music in the early 1960s.&quot; He drew from his roots—gospel, jazz, country, and blues—as well as developing his own style at a time when R&amp;B, and rock were both still in their infancy. Described as both &quot;Rabelaisian&quot; and also as a &quot;spiritual enigma&quot;, &quot;perhaps more than any other artist, the ample figure of Solomon Burke symbolized the ways that spirituality and commerce, ecstasy and entertainment, sex and salvation, individualism and brotherhood, could blend in the world of 1960s soul music.&quot;

During the 55 years that he performed professionally, Burke released 38 studio albums on at least 17 record labels and had 35 singles that charted in the US, including 26 singles that made the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B charts. In 2001, Burke was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a performer. His album &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up on Me&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards in 2003. By 2005 Burke was credited with selling 17 million albums. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Burke as No. 89 on its 2008 list of &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Burke was born James Solomon McDonald on March 21, 1940 (sometimes listed as 1936 or 1939) in the upper floor of his grandmother Eleanor Moore&#x27;s home, a row house in West Philadelphia. On his headstone, his birth year is 1940. 

Burke was the child of Josephine Moore and an absentee father. His mother Josephine was a nurse, schoolteacher, concert performer and pastor. Burke was consecrated a bishop at birth by his grandmother in the Solomon&#x27;s Temple, a congregation of the United House of Prayer for All People, which she founded at her home in Black Bottom, West Philadelphia. When Burke was nine, his mother married rabbi and butcher Vincent Burke and had his name changed to Solomon Vincent McDonald Burke. Burke&#x27;s friends and family called him &quot;Sol&quot;. Burke was the godson of Daddy Grace.

Burke credited his grandmother as his main spiritual and musical influence. He learned how to sing all forms of music from his grandmother&#x27;s coaching him to listen to music on the radio. Burke began preaching at the age of seven at the Solomon&#x27;s Temple. He was described in his young preaching years as a &quot;frantic sermonizer&quot; and &quot;spellbinding in his delivery&quot;, and was soon nicknamed the &quot;Boy Wonder Preacher&quot; for his charismatic preaching in the pulpit. Burke became a pastor of the congregation at the age of 12, appeared on the radio station WDAS, and later hosted a gospel show on WHAT-AM, mixing songs and sermons in broadcasts from Solomon&#x27;s Temple. On weekends he traveled with a truck and tent, to Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas to carry on the spiritual crusade of his church. Influenced by Superman, &quot;the first sign of a royal persona was evident in the cape that he wore only on Sundays, made from his &quot;blankie&quot; by his grandmother.

Burke had six younger siblings – a sister, Laurena Burke-Corbin (born June 23, 1946), and five brothers: Elec Edward &quot;Alec&quot; (born February 16, 1948), Vladimir H. &quot;Laddie&quot; (born July 31, 1949), Mario &quot;Chuck&quot; (born September 13, 1953), Daniel S. &quot;Danny&quot; (born March 10, 1955), and Jolester R. M. Burke (born September 24, 1958). From an early age Solomon Burke worked to supplement his family&#x27;s income. He recalled: &quot;I used to deliver grocery orders in a little wagon I made out of fish boxes. When I was seven, I sold newspapers out of my own newsstand on the corner of 40th and Lancaster. I had the first 99-cent car wash, which was located at 40th and Wallace outside Al&#x27;s Barber Shop. We had it there because he was the only one who would let us use his water. We could wash your car in 20 minutes. I had four or five guys, gave &#x27;em each a nickel for each car.&quot; Another briefly held early job was as a hot dog seller at Eddie&#x27;s Meat Market, where his friend Ernest Evans, later known as Chubby Checker, also worked. Burke eventually graduated from John Bartram High School. He first became a father at 14.

During high school, Burke formed and fronted the quartet, the Gospel Cavaliers. He received his first guitar from his grandmother, later writing his first song, &quot;Christmas Presents&quot;. The Cavaliers began performing in churches. It was around this time that Burke met Kae &quot;Loudmouth&quot; Williams, a famed Philadelphia deejay with help from Williams&#x27; wife, Viola, who saw Burke and the Cavaliers perform at church. Before entering a gospel talent contest in which a record deal was first prize, the group split up.

Burke entered the contest, held at Cornerstone Baptist Church, as a solo artist and won the contest against eleven other competitors. Soon, several labels including Apollo, Vee-Jay Records and Peacock Records pursued the 15-year-old. Before pursuing the deal, Burke signed Kae Williams as his manager. Williams then took him to Apollo Records introducing him to Bess Berman, who signed him to the label. The move was made after Williams added four years to Burke&#x27;s age, which led to confusion from the press about his age.

==Career==

===Early recordings===
Burke signed with Apollo Records in late 1955, following the departure of gospel singer and the label&#x27;s primary star Mahalia Jackson to Columbia. After he signed with Apollo, the label&#x27;s founder Bess Berman and its handlers were reportedly trying to make Burke &quot;the next Harry Belafonte&quot;.

Burke recorded nine singles for the label during his two-year tenure, releasing his first single, &quot;Christmas Presents&quot;, on Christmas Eve of 1955.

He recorded with musicians including King Curtis and Lester Young. His other Apollo recordings during this early period included &quot;I&#x27;m in Love&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m All Alone&quot; and &quot;No Man Walks Alone&quot;, later collected as his first long-player, &quot;Solomon Burke&quot;. These early records did not sell well, although the self-titled album was re-released in 1964 after Burke had experienced some chart success.

Burke gained some notoriety for the Apollo single, &quot;You Can Run (But You Can&#x27;t Hide)&quot;, which he wrote with Charles Merenstein. Due to the song&#x27;s title borrowing from Joe Louis&#x27; quote, &quot;he can run, but he can&#x27;t hide&quot;, Louis was credited as co-writer. Louis helped promote the song by having Burke appear on the &quot;Steve Allen Show&quot; in early 1957. Burke was abruptly dropped from Apollo following a violent argument with manager Kae Williams over performance royalties; Burke claimed Williams had him &quot;blackballed&quot; from the industry following this move. After releasing a few singles for other labels, Burke briefly returned to Apollo under the pseudonym &quot;Little Vincent&quot;, releasing one song in 1961, and the label issued a self-titled album in 1962.

Following his initial Apollo departure, Burke struggled to record or get club dates, and an argument with his mother left him homeless. He later moved into a home owned by Ohella Thompson, after Thompson accidentally hit him with her car outside a club.

During this time, Burke studied the Islamic faith and married, but the marriage was annulled. Soon afterwards, he married Delores Clark, Thompson&#x27;s niece, and soon had seven children.

As his family grew, Burke trained for a while to be a mortician at Eckels College of Mortuary Science, graduating from mortuary science, and finding work at a funeral home. Burke later had his own mortuary business in Los Angeles.

Burke was briefly signed to Herb Abramson&#x27;s Triumph Records. However, Burke could not record for the label because his contract with Apollo had not yet been dissolved.

In 1959, Philadelphia businessman Marvin Leonard &quot;Babe&quot; Chivian (1925-1972), a &quot;body-and-fender man&quot; and real estate speculator, offered Burke a red Lincoln Continental convertible if he would agree to a management contract with him. Chivian arranged for Burke to be signed to Singular Records, a Philadelphia-based label that was owned by WPEN disc jockey Edwin L. &quot;Larry&quot; Brown and vocal coach Arthur &quot;Artie&quot; Singer, who had a distribution deal with Chess Records. Burke released just two singles for Singular, &quot;Doodle Dee Doo&quot; and &quot;This Little Ring&quot;, written by Delores Burke and Marvin Chivian&quot;; neither song charted.

===Work with Atlantic Records===
In November 1960, he signed with Atlantic Records. According to Burke, he signed with the label within ten minutes of entering Jerry Wexler&#x27;s office, reportedly signing a &quot;handshake deal&quot; with Wexler and Ahmet Ertegun.

At the time of Burke&#x27;s signing, two of Atlantic Records&#x27; major stars, Bobby Darin and Ray Charles, had left the label for better deals with Capitol and ABC respectively. According to Alex Halberstadt, &quot;Salvation arrived in the person of Solomon Burke, a soul singer of overwhelming charisma and remarkable stylistic range. ... Wexler and Burke created a string of hits that carried the label financially and represented the first fully realized examples of the classic soul sound.&quot; Burke reportedly helped keep Atlantic Records solvent from 1961 to 1965 with his steady run of hit records.

Burke recorded thirty-two singles with Atlantic, most of which hit both the pop and R&amp;B charts. Burke&#x27;s second single for the label was the country single, &quot;Just Out of Reach (Of My Two Open Arms)&quot;, which became his first charted single, reaching No. 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and peaking at No. 7 on the R&amp;B charts. The song also became Burke&#x27;s first million-seller. His next hit came with &quot;Cry to Me&quot;, which reached No. 5 on the R&amp;B chart in 1962 and was described as one of the first songs to mix country, R&amp;B and gospel. After the release of &quot;Cry to Me&quot;, Burke was one of the first artists to be referred to as a &quot;soul artist&quot;. Other hits included Wilson Pickett&#x27;s &quot;If You Need Me&quot;; &quot;You&#x27;re Good for Me&quot;; his co-written classic, &quot;Everybody Needs Somebody to Love&quot;; his only number-one single, &quot;Got to Get You Off My Mind&quot;; and &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;. Burke became the first R&amp;B artist to cover a Bob Dylan song with his cover of &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Farm&quot;, which became the B-side of &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;. In 1965, Atlantic released his fifth album, &quot;The Best of Solomon Burke&quot;, which peaked at No. 22 on the US charts.

====Branding====
Almost immediately after signing to Atlantic, Wexler and Burke clashed over his branding and the songs that he would record. According to Burke, &quot;Their idea was, we have another young kid to sing gospel, and we&#x27;re going to put him in the blues bag.&quot; As Burke had struggled from an early age with &quot;his attraction to secular music on the one hand and his allegiance to the church on the other,&quot; when he was signed to Atlantic Records he &quot;refused to be classified as a rhythm-and-blues singer&quot; due to a perceived &quot;stigma of profanity&quot; by the church, and R&amp;B&#x27;s reputation as &quot;the devil&#x27;s music&quot;. Burke indicated in 2005: &quot;I told them about my spiritual background, and what I felt was necessary, and that I was concerned about being labeled rhythm &amp; blues. What kind of songs would they be giving me to sing? Because of my age, and my position in the church, I was concerned about saying things that were not proper, or that sent the wrong message. That angered Jerry Wexler a little bit. He said, &#x27;We&#x27;re the greatest blues label in the world! You should be honored to be on this label, and we&#x27;ll do everything we can – but you have to work with us.&#x27;&quot;

To mollify Burke, it was decided to market him as a singer of &quot;soul music&quot; after he had consulted his church brethren and won approval for the term. When a Philadelphia DJ said to Burke, &quot;You&#x27;re singing from your soul and you don&#x27;t want to be an R&amp;B singer, so what kind of singer are you going to be?&quot;, Burke shot back: &quot;I want to be a soul singer.&quot; Burke&#x27;s sound, which was especially popular in the South, was described there as &quot;river deep country fried buttercream soul.&quot; Burke is credited with coining the term &quot;soul music&quot;, which he confirmed in a 1996 interview.

Despite his initial reluctance, shared with several former gospel singers including Aretha Franklin and Wilson Pickett, Burke was &quot;molded into a more secular direction when he signed with Atlantic in the &#x27;60s&quot;, and became one of &quot;the &quot;backsliders&quot;, artists who &quot;preferred a secular acclaim to the gospel obscurity&quot;.

He decided eventually that &quot;secular music was not the antithesis of the church but, rather, &#x27;a new avenue, a new dimension to spread the gospel.&#x27;&quot; Despite this, &quot;leaving gospel for secular music, as well as integrating secular music into gospel performances, was controversial.&quot;

Noted blues scholar Paul Oliver maintains that when Sam Cooke and Burke &quot;turned from gospel singing to the blues&quot;, unlike others who had done so previously, &quot;they took the gospel technique with them&quot;; &quot;even the words often secularized gospel songs&quot;, and this was coupled with a &quot;screaming delivery, the exploitation of emotional involvement, [and] the frenetic displays of dancing singers.&quot;

For Burke, &quot;gospel influences were pervasive. Gospelly chord progressions, organ accompaniment and a style of singing which can only be described as &quot;preaching&quot; have now spread widely into much black popular music.&quot; Music critic Mark Deming described Burke as having: &quot;one of the finest voices in popular music, that possessed a churchly authority that was the ideal match for his material which balanced the pleasures of the flesh with the price of the transgression.&quot;

&quot;Burke sounded like a Baptist preacher in a country church, and for [Jerry] Wexler he was the first and possibly the greatest of all &#x27;60s soul men.&quot; Wexler, who considered Burke to be &quot;the greatest male soul singer of all time&quot;, pronounced him a &quot;vocalist of rare prowess and remarkable range. His voice is an instrument of exquisite sensitivity.&quot; Wexler also described the young Burke&#x27;s vocal style as &quot;churchy without being coarse.&quot;

In 2000, Wexler indicated: &quot;Solomon was beautiful, baby. He sounded just like Dean Martin.&quot; In 2003 Wexler assessed Burke: &quot;I rate him at the very top. Since all singing is a trade-off between music and drama, he&#x27;s the master at both. His theatricality. He&#x27;s a great actor.&quot; Despite his admiration for Burke, Wexler also described Burke as &quot;a piece of work: wily, highly intelligent, a salesman of epic proportions, sly, sure-footed, a never-say-die entrepreneur&quot;, while also branding him &quot;a card-carrying fabulist. Solomon has told so many versions of the same happening that it&#x27;s unreal.&quot;

====Impact====

After a string of a dozen hit records, by November 1963 Burke had agreed to be crowned the &quot;King of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Soul&quot; in a ceremony at the Royal Theatre in Baltimore by local deejay Fred Robinson, known professionally as &quot;Rockin&#x27; Robin&quot;, who also gave him a cape and crown that he always wore on stage. Burke accepted the appellation the &quot;King of Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Soul&quot;, indicating &quot;without soul, there&#x27;d be no rock and without rock, there&#x27;d be no soul.&quot; The ceremony was repeated each night during the week Burke performed in Baltimore.

According to Gerri Hirshey: &quot;Title agreed upon, Solomon added the trappings: a crown, a scepter, a cape, robe, dancing girls, and colored lights.&quot; Burke&#x27;s crown was an exact replica of &quot;the crown jewels of London&quot; and the cape was trimmed with real ermine. Burke, whose shows were &quot;tours de force&quot; of riveting soul and unashamed hokum&quot;, &quot;ticked every box from low comedy through country pleading to the kind of magisterial rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll that brought the house down&quot;, and he &quot;became known as much for his showmanship as he did his voice. He would often take the stage in a flowing, 15-foot-long cape and bejeweled crown, his stage theatrics predating those of such legendary showman as James Brown. According to David Hepworth, Burke &quot;once employed a midget who was secreted under his cape. When it was thrown off the cape would disappear stage left as of its own volition.&quot;

After the success of his &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Bag&quot; in late 1965, James Brown, believing he deserved to be crowned &quot;King of Soul&quot;, hired Burke to perform for one night in Chicago, but ended up paying not to perform but rather to watch him perform instead, expecting Burke also to surrender his crown and title to him. According to Burke, &quot;He paid me $7,500 to stand onstage and hand him my robe and crown. It was a great gig: I got paid and I didn&#x27;t have to sing a note.&quot; Burke accepted Brown&#x27;s money, but retained his title and regal paraphernalia.

As he increased in weight, &quot;Burke&#x27;s sheer bulk meant that he could never be a dancer like James Brown, but like Brown, his act was full of showmanship.&quot; Consequently, over the years Burke &quot;evolved a fervently demonstrative stage act&quot;, that were often compared with religious revival meetings. Burke and black performers like James Brown, Aretha Franklin and Wilson Pickett, &quot;would adopt the &#x27;house-wrecking&#x27; tactics of black preachers, and their shows functioned in much the same way as black religious events in that performer and audience became immersed in the music, arriving together at an ecstatic state that allowed them to feel a deep intensity of experience.&quot; According to Weldon McDougal, Burke &quot;turned theatres like the Apollo and the Uptown into churches, he had folk running down the aisles to be saved by his music.&quot; Cliff White described a show in the UK where &quot;with head thrown back and one hand cupped to his mouth like an Alpine yodeller he cried out with such overwhelming passion that he left the spellbound audience wrung out and exhausted like so many limp rags.&quot;

====Decline with Atlantic====
After 1965, the &quot;biggest year of his career&quot;, Burke settled as &quot;at best a middle-of-the-pack chart performer&quot;. Due to failing chart numbers and the rise of several performers including Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett and Otis Redding, Burke was described by David Cantwell in this period as &quot;a King without a kingdom&quot;. Burke&#x27;s position in Atlantic dropped by 1968 as other Atlantic artists replaced him as the label&#x27;s primary artists. Burke tried to regain his early Atlantic success by recording at Memphis, working on the album &quot;I Wish I Knew&quot; at Chips Moman&#x27;s American Sound Studio. The album included the songs &quot;Get Out of My Life Woman&quot; and a cover of &quot;I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free&quot;, his first recording that provided social commentary. It was later dedicated to Martin Luther King Jr., and Atlantic gave up 5% of royalties on the single to King&#x27;s family. It reached only No. 32 R&amp;B and No. 68 pop. Burke later met his next manager Tamiko Jones at the Memphis studio. Burke and Jones recorded several duets on Jones&#x27; album, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Anything for You&quot;. Following a failed collaboration with other soul artists as the Soul Clan, Burke decided to leave the label. His reasons for leaving Atlantic were for not &quot;being treated properly&quot; and that Atlantic &quot;just wasn&#x27;t home anymore, wasn&#x27;t family&quot;.

===Later recordings===
After leaving Atlantic, Burke signed with Bell Records where he released five singles in the next eighteen months. In 1969 he had a small hit with his second release for Bell, a reworking of Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s &quot;Proud Mary&quot; b/w &quot;What Am I Living For&quot; (Bell 783). This was co-produced by Tamiko Jones, who was being rehabilitated after a bout of polio, and was at the time Burke&#x27;s manager. Burke recorded a cover of &quot;Proud Mary&quot; prior to Ike &amp; Tina Turner&#x27;s version, and according to Burke was the one who convinced the duo to record it. The song became a brief hit reaching No. 15 R&amp;B and No. 45 pop. All but four of the tracks Burke recorded during an 18-month stay with Bell Records were packaged on the &quot;Proud Mary&quot; LP. After this album and the two following singles—his own &quot;Generation of Revelations&quot;, and the Mac Davis song &quot;In the Ghetto&quot;, which had previously been a hit for Elvis Presley—failed to chart, his contract was not renewed.

Through the efforts of his manager, Buddy Glee, by November 1970 Burke signed with Mike Curb&#x27;s MGM label, and formed MBM Productions, his own production company. Burke&#x27;s record debut for MGM, &quot;Lookin&#x27; Out My Back Door&quot;, another Creedence Clearwater Revival song, had disappointing sales. His first MGM album, &quot;Electronic Magnetism&quot;, also failed to chart. In 1972 Burke had a No. 13 R&amp;B hit for MGM with &quot;Love Street and Fool&#x27;s Road&quot; (MGM 14353). In 1972, he recorded the soundtrack to two films, &quot;Cool Breeze&quot; and &quot;Hammer&quot;. He left MGM for ABC-Dunhill Records in 1974, recording the album, &quot;I Have a Dream&quot;, which produced the No. 14 R&amp;B hit, &quot;Midnight and You&quot;. By 1975 Burke was signed to Chess Records. He recorded two albums for Chess: &quot;Music to Make Love By&quot; and &quot;Back to My Roots&quot;, and had a top 20 R&amp;B hit in 1975 with &quot;You And Your Baby Blues&quot;. However, his follow-up single &quot;Let Me Wrap My Arms Around You&quot; reached only No. 72 on the R&amp;B chart. In 1978 Burke released an album &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Say Goodbye To Me&quot;, which was produced by Jerry &quot;Swamp Dogg&quot; Williams, though Amherst Records. On September 23, 1978, Burke charted for the 31st and last time when &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Say Goodbye to Me&quot; reached No. 91 on the R&amp;B chart. He released the album &quot;Sidewalks, Fences and Walls&quot; on Infinity Records in 1979 (reissued as &quot;Let Your Love Flow&quot; in 1993 by Shanachie Records).

Between 1979 and 1984, Burke recorded four gospel albums for Savoy Records, starting with the album, &quot;Lord I Need a Miracle Right Now&quot;. He was nominated for his first Grammy in the Best Male Gospel Soul category for his rendition of &quot;Precious Lord, Take My Hand&quot;, but complained later that he did not receive royalties from his Savoy work. He then recorded for smaller labels such as Rounder, MCI/Isis, Bizarre/Straight, Black Top, Point Blank and GTR Records. Burke was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 19, 2001, in New York City by Mary J. Blige, after eight previous nominations since 1986.

===Final recordings===

In 2002, Burke signed with Fat Possum Records and released the album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up on Me&quot;. Many of the songs were previously unreleased tunes, some written for him by top writers including Tom Waits, with whom he had a discussion over whether to sing about a mint julep, which was against Solomon&#x27;s principles at the time. Burke agreed to sing the line. The album became critically acclaimed and later resulted in Burke&#x27;s first Grammy Award win. In 2004 Burke appeared on the Italian singer Zucchero Fornaciari&#x27;s &quot;Zu &amp; Co.&quot;, a duets album. He also performed at the Royal Albert Hall for the beginning of the &quot;Zu &amp; Co. Tour&quot;, from which &quot;Zu &amp; Co live at the Royal Albert Hall&quot; was recorded.

Burke later signed with Shout! Factory to release the album &quot;Make Do With What You Got&quot;, which became another critically acclaimed success. In 2006, Burke returned to his country roots with the album, &quot;Nashville&quot;. In 2008, he received another Grammy nomination for the album, &quot;Like a Fire&quot;. That year, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Burke as No. 89 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;. In 2010, Burke came out with the Willie Mitchell-produced &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Impossible&quot; for E1 Entertainment. Later in 2010, he released his final album, &quot;Hold on Tight&quot;, a collaboration album with De Dijk, a Dutch band.

==Entrepreneurship==
From an early age Burke was &quot;always an enterprising personality&quot;. In addition to his recording career, Burke ran funeral homes, owned two drugstores and a popcorn business in Philadelphia, and later had the first Mountain Dew franchise in Philadelphia.

Burke&#x27;s entrepreneurial activities included cooking and selling barbecued chicken sandwiches backstage, as well as sandwiches, soft drinks, and fried chickens at increasingly inflated prices to other performers who were refused service at restaurants on the Chitlin&#x27; Circuit in the &quot;Jim Crow&quot; South. According to Sam Moore of the soul duo Sam &amp; Dave, &quot;He gave me one pork chop, one scoop of macaroni and cheese, and one spoonful of gravy. I said, &#x27;Is that it?&#x27; And he&#x27;d say, &quot;That&#x27;s it, brother. I&#x27;m doing you a favor, so take it or leave it.&quot; Trombonist Fred Wesley was one who was critical of Burke&#x27;s business practices. Burke demanded and operated the concessions at the Apollo Theater when he performed there in 1966. This was very profitable for him but so enraged the owner Frank Schiffman that he was banned from performing at the Apollo for life. After playing at the reopening of The Cavern Club in Liverpool in July 1966, Burke said: &quot;The Cavern was a great place to play. The groove was there, the people were there, and it was wonderful. I remember them selling hot Pepsis. What a mistake—you gotta put ice in those things. Think of how many more they could have sold with ice in them.&quot;

Burke owned funeral parlors in California, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina, and two of his children have turned the mortuary business into a franchise. Additionally, Burke owned and operated a limousine service. Burke continued to operate companies that supplied theaters and stadiums with his own brand of fast food—Soul Dogs and Soul Corn until at least 2004.

==Bishopric and community work==
From the early 1970s, after having moved to Los Angeles, Burke concentrated on his episcopal duties, preaching from a crimson throne on the third Sunday of the month at the Prayer Assembly Church of God in Christ, his church at 226 North Market St., Inglewood, California. Within three decades his church grew to have about 170 missions and 40,000 members. By 2000, Burke&#x27;s Solomon&#x27;s Temple: The House of God for All People had over 300 ordained ministers whose job is to &quot;feed the hungry, educate the uneducated and be God&#x27;s workers in the vineyard&quot;, and 40,000 parishioners in close to 200 churches across the USA, Canada, and Jamaica. At the time of his death, there were about 180 churches that were established under the charter of his denomination, with Burke indicating: &quot;We&#x27;re non-sectarian, non-denominational. Ours is an open door.&quot; In 2008 Burke acknowledged his Christian methodology differed from that of his maternal uncle, Pastor Harry R. Moore (1933–1982), the founder and pastor of Our First Temple of Faith, at Front and Susquehanna Streets, Philadelphia: &quot;Mine was more: God, money and women, hey hey hey; truth, love, peace and get it on.&quot; While pursuing other interests, Burke was also deeply involved in community work, assisting The Crippled Children&#x27;s Foundation for blind and underprivileged children, while personally being responsible for more than 120 adopted children.

Burke was also a mentor to up-coming Soul and Blues musicians, including a young Reggie Sears.

==Personal life==
Burke was married four times. In total he fathered 21 children (fourteen daughters and seven sons). He had seven step-children, 90 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren at the time of his death.

Burke was married to Doris P. Williams for two months; the marriage was annulled by August 1958, though it resulted in the birth of one child, Valerie Doris Gresham (born 1957).

Burke&#x27;s second wife was Delores Clark Burke, with whom he had seven children, including Eleanor Alma (born 1958), Dr. Melanie Burke-McCall (born March 1960), Solomon Vincent Jr. (born 1961), Carolyn J. Burke (born 1962), Prince Solomon (JFK) Burke, Gemini C. Burke (born 1964), and Lillian (born 1966).

Burke&#x27;s third wife was Bernadine Burke. In 2012 Court documents BP Case 126258 (Solomon McDonald Burke) it proved that Burke had never divorced Arch Bishop Bernadine Turner Burke in 1970 before marrying Frances Szeto, Court records shows no divorce from Bernadine McDonald Burke or Delores Burke. Burke&#x27;s fourth wife was Frances Szeto Burke McDonald (born 1951), Marriage License dated December 1977; she was living with Burke and live in lover/manager and caregiver Jane Margolis Vickers when Burke died, Frances had three children with Burke.
In a 2006 interview Burke admitted having his first child at age 14: &quot;being a father at age 14 maybe been a little early, but I don&#x27;t regret one moment, one second, one day, or one hour. My only regrets are the loss of my twins and my first son.&quot; Burke&#x27;s twin sons were James and David, who both died in infancy. By 1961, Burke had &quot;three kids on the outside, and about four at home&quot;, including Eleanor A. H. Burke (born 1958) Melanie Burke (born 1960), Solomon Vincent Burke Jr. (born 1961). In an open letter to his children, Burke wrote: Burke admitted serial infidelity during his marriages: &quot;I was young. Girls were coming from every angle. I couldn&#x27;t love them all. But I tried.&quot;

Burke stated: 

===Family members===
Several of Burke&#x27;s family have had successful careers in various facets of show business. In the mid-1960s two of Burke&#x27;s younger brothers, Alex (born 1948 in Philadelphia). and Laddie (born 1949 in Philadelphia), joined with fellow Germantown High School students, brothers Earl and Timmy Smith to form The Showstoppers, who had a couple of local hit singles in Philadelphia on Showtime Records in 1968, including a No. 11 hit on the UK Singles Chart with &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; But a Houseparty&quot; b/w &quot;How Easy Your Heart Forgets Me&quot; (Heritage HE-800), which peaked at No. 87 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart in 1968, which was later a discothèque hit (No. 33) in 1971, just before the group disbanded after a series of flops.

Burke&#x27;s daughter Melanie Burke-McCall, a neo soul singer is an artist as well as a freelance background recording artist with companies including Daxwood Records, Casablanca, A&amp;M and Rawkus Records. She is a studio artist for groups Billy Preston, Peacock (Anna Gayle group), and Leslie Uggams, and toured with Chaka Khan, and wrote and produced Trouble Don&#x27;t Last Play and LP with &quot;Family, &amp; Friends&quot;, a 14-song original soundtrack, which was released in 2003, she opened for Jocelyn Brown, Jaheim, Norman Connors, and Angela Bofill, as well as for her father at the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia in 2006. In 1972 Burke-McCall was signed along with her siblings The Sons &amp; Daughters of Solomon to MGM Records. Her son is Novel, who released his first studio album &quot;The Audiobiography&quot; in October 2008, and wrote movie soundtracks for Tyler Perry&#x27;s &quot;Diary of a Mad Black Woman&quot;, &quot;Step Up,&quot; and &quot;21&quot;. Her youngest son, Solomon, also has started recording.

Burke&#x27;s granddaughter Candy Burke (born 1977) was a backing singer at many of Burke&#x27;s performances, including the July 2008 Juan-les-Pins concert, where she performed a rendition of &quot;I Will Survive&quot;. She also appears in the 2003 North Sea Jazz Festival DVD with her grandfather who raised her as his daughter.

Burke&#x27;s grandson Novel Stevenson has written songs for numerous artists.

Rapper Raeneal T. Quann (known as Q-Don) (born about 1978), who was accidentally shot and killed by robbers on April 26, 2000, outside the Club Evolution in Philadelphia, was also a grandson of Burke.

==Declining health==
For many years Burke struggled with his health, with his &quot;weight estimated somewhere between 300 and 400 pounds&quot; in 2006. &quot;New York Times&quot; writer Ben Sisario wrote of Burke: &quot;Wide-shaped in his youth, he grew into Henry VIII-like corpulence, and in his later years had to be wheeled to his throne.&quot; In the later years of his life, &quot;arthritis and weight ... limited his mobility&quot; and made him reliant on a wheelchair.

In an interview in 2008, Burke said that &quot;God put me in this wheelchair&quot;, and that God&#x27;s message to him was: &quot;&#x27;You are too fat!&#x27;&quot; Burke denied having an eating disorder: ... I guess God let me develop into what I am now and allowed me to live. It&#x27;s not an eating disorder. If I had an eating disorder, I wouldn&#x27;t travel.&quot; In 2006 Burke acknowledged: &quot;It&#x27;s very rough. I love to eat and I love to cook—as you can see. But my hip has to be replaced and a knee has to be replaced and I&#x27;ve got to lose 150 pounds before they can do that. And that&#x27;s a lot. But it&#x27;s NOT! God knows I&#x27;ve enjoyed every kind of food there is, all around the world. It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m going to miss any of it. Because I&#x27;ve had it all!&quot; Despite his efforts, at the time of his death, Burke&#x27;s weight still exceeded 350 pounds.

==Death and funeral==
On October 10, 2010, Burke died at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport while on a plane from Washington Dulles International Airport that had just landed. He had been due to perform with De Dijk in Amsterdam on October 12. The cause of death was not immediately clear; according to his family, Burke died of natural causes. At a 2012 probate court hearing of Burke&#x27;s will, Burke&#x27;s manager/companion of 16 years, Jane Margolis Vickers, stated that doctors at Reston Hospital suspected that Burke had a pulmonary embolism and had urged him not to travel. Burke decided to leave the hospital &quot;against medical advice&quot; and proceed to Dulles for his flight to Amsterdam. There was no autopsy after his death, but the general assumption is that Burke died as a result of a pulmonary embolism.

On October 21 a wake and meditation service was held at the Pierce Brothers Valley Oaks Griffin Mortuary at Westlake Village. Burke&#x27;s funeral was at 10:00 am on October 22, 2010, at the City of Refuge in Gardena, California and was open to the public. It was simulcast on the internet and at a memorial service held at the Sharon Baptist Church in Philadelphia, that was led by Minister Lester Fields and Solomon&#x27;s younger sister, Apostle Laurena Burke Corbin, the pastor of Our First Temple of Faith Mt. Deborah Pentecostal Church on Haverford Avenue in Philadelphia, and attended by Burke&#x27;s extended East Coast family.

Joe Henry described the funeral, which was &quot;2 and a half hours long, included many eulogies, some spontaneous gospel singing; some shouting, some wailing, a fainting, and a daughter who hopped on the balls of her feet and spoke in tongues as punctuation to her scripted remarks. The highlight for me was Rudy [Copeland]&#x27;s bluesy Hammond B-3 instrumental of Tommy Dorsey&#x27;s &quot;Precious Lord (Lead Me On)&quot;. He played it like Ray [Charles] would have, kicking it heavy on the bass foot pedals, and shouting his own encouragement: &#x27;Tell the story, son!&#x27; The whole service climaxed with a rousing version of &quot;When the Saints Go Marching In&quot;, which included the choir, a 2nd-line-style brass band marching through the isles , and everyone in the pews clapping and singing along.&quot;

Burke is buried at Lot 4037, Space 1, in the Murmuring Trees section of the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills, at 6300 Forest Lawn Drive, Los Angeles, California.

Neil Portnow, President/CEO of The Recording Academy, praised Burke soon after his death: &quot;GRAMMY-winning soul singer Solomon Burke was revered as one of music&#x27;s greatest vocalists and a pioneer of the genre. A deeply spiritual man, his love and passion for his craft kept him touring and performing to sold-out audiences right up to his final days. Few artists have had careers as long, rich and influential as his, and he leaves a larger-than-life legacy as powerful and soulful as he was. The music industry has lost one of its most distinctive voices.&quot;

<doc id="164479" wikidata="Q310170" url="?curid=164479" title="Curtis Mayfield">
<text>Curtis Lee Mayfield (June 3, 1942 – December 26, 1999) was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and record producer. Dubbed the &quot;Gentle Genius&quot;, he is considered one of the most influential musicians of soul and socially conscious African-American music. Mayfield first achieved success and recognition with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame-inducted vocal group The Impressions during the civil rights movement of the late 1950s and the 1960s, and later worked as a solo artist.

Mayfield started his musical career in a gospel choir. Moving to the North Side of Chicago, he met Jerry Butler in 1956 at the age of 14 and joined The Impressions. The group&#x27;s lead singer and primary songwriter, Mayfield became noted as one of the first musicians to bring more prevalent themes of social awareness into soul music. In 1965, he wrote &quot;People Get Ready&quot; for The Impressions, which was ranked No. 24 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; in 2004. The song received numerous other awards; it was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;, and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998.

After leaving The Impressions in 1970 in pursuit of a solo career, Mayfield released several albums throughout the decade, including his debut &quot;Curtis&quot; (1970) and the soundtrack for the 1972 blaxploitation film &quot;Super Fly&quot;. The soundtrack was noted for its socially conscious themes, primarily addressing issues that heavily affected inner city residents and racial minorities such as crime, poverty and drug abuse. The album was ranked No. 72 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in 2003.

On August 13, 1990, Mayfield was paralyzed from the neck down during an accident in which lighting equipment fell on him during a live performance at Wingate Field in Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York. Despite this, he continued his career as a recording artist, releasing his final album &quot;New World Order&quot; in 1996. Mayfield won a Grammy Legend Award in 1994 and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. He is a double inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of The Impressions in 1991, and again in 1999 as a solo artist. He is also a two-time Grammy Hall of Fame inductee. He died from complications of type 2 diabetes at the age of 57 on December 26, 1999.

== Early life ==
Curtis Lee Mayfield was born on Wednesday, June 3, 1942, in Cook County Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Marion Washington and Kenneth Mayfield, one of five children. Mayfield&#x27;s father left the family when Curtis was five; his mother (and maternal grandmother) moved the family into several Chicago public housing projects before settling in Cabrini–Green during his teen years. Mayfield attended Wells Community Academy High School before dropping out his second year. His mother taught him piano and, along with his grandmother, encouraged him to enjoy gospel music. At the age of seven he sang publicly at his aunt&#x27;s church with the Northern Jubilee Gospel Singers.

Mayfield received his first guitar when he was ten, later recalling that he loved his guitar so much he used to sleep with it. He was a self-taught musician, and he grew up admiring blues singer Muddy Waters and Spanish guitarist Andres Segovia.

When he was 14 years old he formed the Alphatones when the Northern Jubilee Gospel Singers decided to try their luck in downtown Chicago and Mayfield stayed behind. Fellow group member Sam Gooden was quoted &quot;It would have been nice to have him there with us, but of course, your parents have the first say.&quot;

Later in 1956, he joined his high school friend Jerry Butler&#x27;s group The Roosters with brothers Arthur and Richard Brooks. He wrote and composed songs for this group who would become The Impressions two years later. He was also notably a childhood friend of fellow musician Terry Callier.

==Career==
===The Impressions===
Mayfield&#x27;s career began in 1956 when he joined the Roosters with Arthur and Richard Brooks and Jerry Butler. Two years later the Roosters, now including Sam Gooden, became the Impressions. The band had two hit singles with Butler, &quot;For Your Precious Love&quot; and &quot;Come Back My Love&quot;, then Butler left. Mayfield temporarily went with him, co-writing and performing on Butler&#x27;s next hit, &quot;He Will Break Your Heart&quot;, before returning to the Impressions with the group signing for ABC Records and working with the label&#x27;s Chicago-based producer/A&amp;R manager, Johnny Pate.

Butler was replaced by Fred Cash, a returning original Roosters member, and Mayfield became lead singer, frequently composing for the band, starting with &quot;Gypsy Woman&quot;, a Top 20 Pop hit. Their hit &quot;Amen&quot; (Top 10), an updated version of an old gospel tune, was included in the soundtrack of the 1963 United Artists film &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot;, which starred Sidney Poitier. The Impressions reached the height of their popularity in the mid-to-late-&#x27;60s with a string of Mayfield compositions that included &quot;Keep On Pushing,&quot; &quot;People Get Ready&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s All Right&quot; (Top 10), the up-tempo &quot;Talking about My Baby&quot;(Top 20) and &quot;Woman&#x27;s Got Soul&quot;.

He formed his own label, Curtom Records in Chicago in 1968 and the Impressions joined him to continue their run of hits including &quot;Fool For You,&quot; &quot;This is My Country&quot;, &quot;Choice Of Colors&quot; and &quot;Check Out Your Mind&quot;. Mayfield had written much of the soundtrack of the Civil Rights Movement in the early 1960s, but by the end of the decade, he was a pioneering voice in the black pride movement along with James Brown and Sly Stone. Mayfield&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;re a Winner&quot; was their last major hit for ABC. Reaching number 14 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s pop chart and number one on the R&amp;B chart, it became an anthem of the black power and black pride movements when it was released in late 1967, much as his earlier &quot;Keep on Pushing&quot; (whose title is quoted in the lyrics of &quot;We&#x27;re a Winner&quot; and also in &quot;Move On Up&quot;) had been an anthem for Martin Luther King Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement.

Mayfield was a prolific songwriter in Chicago even outside his work for the Impressions, writing and producing scores of hits for many other artists. He also owned the Mayfield and Windy C labels which were distributed by Cameo-Parkway, and was a partner in the Curtom (first independent, then distributed by Buddah then Warner Bros and finally RSO) and Thomas labels (first independent, then distributed by Atlantic, then independent again and finally Buddah).

Among Mayfield&#x27;s greatest songwriting successes were three hits that he wrote for Jerry Butler on Vee Jay (&quot;He Will Break Your Heart&quot;, &quot;Find Another Girl&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m A-Tellin&#x27; You&quot;). His harmony vocals are very prominent. He also had great success writing and arranging Jan Bradley&#x27;s &quot;Mama Didn&#x27;t Lie&quot;. Starting in 1963, he was heavily involved in writing and arranging for OKeh Records (with Carl Davis producing), which included hits by Major Lance such as &quot;Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um&quot; and &quot;The Monkey Time&quot;, as well as Walter Jackson, Billy Butler and the Artistics. This arrangement ran through 1965.

===Solo career===
In 1970, Mayfield left the Impressions and began a solo career. Curtom released many of Mayfield&#x27;s 1970s records, as well as records by the Impressions, Leroy Hutson, the Five Stairsteps, the Staples Singers, Mavis Staples, Linda Clifford, Natural Four, The Notations and Baby Huey and the Babysitters. Gene Chandler and Major Lance, who had worked with Mayfield during the 1960s, also signed for short stays at Curtom. Many of the label&#x27;s recordings were produced by Mayfield.

Mayfield&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Curtis&quot;, was released in 1970, and hit the top 20, as well as being a critical success. It pre-dated Marvin Gaye&#x27;s album, &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;, to which it has been compared in addressing social change. The commercial and critical peak of his solo career came with &quot;Super Fly&quot;, the soundtrack to the blaxploitation &quot;Super Fly&quot; film, which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart and sold more than 12 million copies. Unlike the soundtracks to other blaxploitation films (most notably Isaac Hayes&#x27; score for &quot;Shaft&quot;), which glorified the ghetto excesses of the characters, Mayfield&#x27;s lyrics consisted of hard-hitting commentary on the state of affairs in black, urban ghettos at the time, as well as direct criticisms of several characters in the film. Bob Donat wrote in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in 1972 that while the film&#x27;s message &quot;was diluted by schizoid cross-purposes&quot; because it &quot;glamorizes machismo-cocaine consciousness... the anti-drug message on [Mayfield&#x27;s soundtrack] is far stronger and more definite than in the film.&quot; Because of the tendency of these blaxploitation films to glorify the criminal life of dealers and pimps to target a mostly black lower class audience, Mayfield&#x27;s album set this movie apart. With songs like &quot;Freddie&#x27;s Dead&quot;, a song that focuses on the demise of Freddie, a junkie that was forced into &quot;pushin&#x27; dope for the man&quot; because of a debt that he owed to his dealer, and &quot;Pusherman&quot;, a song that reveals how many people in the ghetto fell victim to drug abuse, and therefore became dependent upon their dealers, Mayfield illuminated a darker side of life in the ghetto that these blaxploitation films often failed to criticize. However, although Mayfield&#x27;s soundtrack criticized the glorification of dealers and pimps, he in no way denied that this glorification was occurring. When asked about the subject matter of these films he was quoted stating &quot;I don&#x27;t see why people are complaining about the subject of these films&quot;, and &quot;The way you clean up the films is by cleaning up the streets.&quot;

Along with &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; and Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Innervisions&quot;, this album ushered in a new socially conscious, funky style of popular soul music. The single releases &quot;Freddie&#x27;s Dead&quot; and &quot;Super Fly&quot; each sold more than one million copies, and were awarded gold discs by the R.I.A.A.

&quot;Super Fly&quot; brought success that resulted in Mayfield being tapped for additional soundtracks, some of which he wrote and produced while having others perform the vocals. Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips recorded Mayfield&#x27;s soundtrack for &quot;Claudine&quot; in 1974, while Aretha Franklin recorded the soundtrack for &quot;Sparkle&quot; in 1976. Mayfield also worked with The Staples Singers on the soundtrack for the 1975 film &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot;, and teamed up with Mavis Staples exclusively on the 1977 film soundtrack &quot;A Piece of the Action&quot; (both movies were part of a trilogy of films that featured the acting and comedic exploits of Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier and were directed by Poitier).

In 1973 Mayfield released the anti-war album &quot;Back to the World&quot;, a concept album that dealt with the social aftermath of the Vietnam War and criticized the United States&#x27; involvement in wars across the planet. One of Mayfield&#x27;s most successful funk-disco meldings was the 1977 hit &quot;Do Do Wap is Strong in Here&quot; from his soundtrack to the Robert M. Young film of Miguel Piñero&#x27;s play &quot;Short Eyes&quot;. In his 2003 biography of Curtis Mayfield, &quot;People Never Give Up&quot;, author Peter Burns noted that Mayfield has 140 songs in the Curtom vaults. Burns indicated that the songs were maybe already completed or in the stages of completion, so that they could then be released commercially. These recordings include &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, &quot;In The News&quot;, &quot;Turn up the Radio&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s The Situation?&quot; and one recording labelled &quot;Curtis at Montreux Jazz Festival 87&quot;.Two other albums featuring Curtis Mayfield present in the Curtom vaults and as yet unissued are a 1982/83 live recording titled &quot;25th Silver Anniversary&quot; (which features performances by Mayfield, the Impressions, and Jerry Butler) and a live performance, recorded in September 1966 by the Impressions titled &quot;Live at the Club Chicago&quot;.

In 1982, Mayfield decided to move to Atlanta with his family, closing down his recording operation in Chicago. The label had gradually reduced in size in its final two years or so with releases on the main RSO imprint and Curtom credited as the production company. Mayfield continued to record occasionally, keeping the Curtom name alive for a few more years, and to tour worldwide. Mayfield&#x27;s song &quot;(Don&#x27;t Worry) If There&#x27;s a Hell Below, We&#x27;re All Going to Go&quot; has been included as an entrance song on every episode of the drama series &quot;The Deuce&quot;. &quot;The Deuce&quot; tells of the germination of the sex-trade industry in the heart of New York&#x27;s Times Square in the 1970s. Mayfield&#x27;s career began to slow down during the 1980s.

In later years, Mayfield&#x27;s music was included in the movies &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Git You Sucka&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Shuffle&quot;, &quot;Friday&quot; (though not on the soundtrack album), &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot;, &quot;The Hangover Part II&quot; and &quot;Short Eyes&quot;, where he had a cameo role as a prisoner.

==Social activism==

Mayfield sang openly about civil rights and black pride, and was known for introducing social consciousness into African-American music. Having been raised in the Cabrini-Green projects of Chicago, he witnessed many of the tragedies of the urban ghetto first hand, and was quoted saying &quot;With everything I saw on the streets as a young black kid, it wasn&#x27;t hard during the later fifties and sixties for me to write my heartfelt way of how I visualized things, how I thought things ought to be.&quot;

Following the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, his group the Impressions produced music that became the soundtrack to a summer of revolution. It is even said that &quot;Keep On Pushing&quot; became the number one sing along during the Freedom Rides. Black students sang their songs as they marched to jail or protested outside their universities, while King often used &quot;Keep On Pushing&quot;, &quot;People Get Ready&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re A Winner&quot; because of their ability to motivate and inspire marchers. Mayfield had quickly become a civil rights hero with his ability to inspire hope and courage.

Mayfield was unique in his ability to fuse relevant social commentary with melodies and lyrics that instilled a hopefulness for a better future in his listeners. He wrote and recorded the soundtrack to the 1972 blaxploitation film &quot;Super Fly&quot; with the help of producer Johnny Pate. The soundtrack for &quot;Super Fly&quot; is regarded as an all-time great body of work that captured the essence of life in the ghetto while criticizing the tendency of young people to glorify the &quot;glamorous&quot; lifestyles of drug dealers and pimps, and illuminating the dark realities of drugs, addiction, and exploitation.

Mayfield, along with several other soul and funk musicians, spread messages of hope in the face of oppression, pride in being a member of the black race and gave courage to a generation of people who were demanding their human rights. He has been compared to Martin Luther King Jr. for making a lasting impact in the civil rights struggle with his inspirational music. By the end of the decade Mayfield was a pioneering voice in the black pride movement, along with James Brown and Sly Stone. Paving the way for a future generation of rebel thinkers, Mayfield paid the price, artistically and commercially, for his politically charged music. Mayfield&#x27;s &quot;Keep On Pushing&quot; was actually banned from several radio stations, including WLS in his hometown of Chicago. Regardless of the persistent radio bans and loss of revenue, he continued his quest for equality right until his death.

Mayfield was also a descriptive social commentator. As the influx of drugs ravaged through black America in the late 1960s and 1970s his bittersweet descriptions of the ghetto would serve as warnings to the impressionable. &quot;Freddie&#x27;s Dead&quot; is a graphic tale of street life, while &quot;Pusherman&quot; revealed the role of drug dealers in the urban ghettos.

==Personal life==
Mayfield was married twice. He had 10 children from different relationships. At the time of his death he was married to Altheida Mayfield. Together they had six children.

===Accident===
On August 13, 1990, Mayfield became paralyzed from the neck down after stage lighting equipment fell on him while he was being introduced at an outdoor concert at Wingate Field in Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York. Two years after the accident, he sang the second verse of a remake of &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot; being produced by Gary Katz by the Repercussions for &quot;All Men Are Brothers: A Tribute to Curtis Mayfield&quot;, while lying on his back in the recording studio. Although he was unable to play the guitar, he continued to compose and sing, which he found he could do by lying down and letting gravity pull down on his chest and lungs. The 1996 album &quot;New World Order&quot; was recorded in this way, with vocals sometimes recorded in lines at a time.

===Final years and death===
Mayfield received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994. In February 1998, he had to have his right leg amputated due to diabetes. He was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame on March 15, 1999. Health reasons prevented him from attending the ceremony, which included fellow inductees Paul McCartney, Billy Joel, Bruce Springsteen, Dusty Springfield, George Martin, and 1970s Curtom signees and labelmates the Staple Singers.

Mayfield&#x27;s last appearance on record was with the group Bran Van 3000 on the song &quot;Astounded&quot; for their album &quot;Discosis&quot;, recorded just before his death and released in 2001. However, his health had steadily declined following his paralysis, so his vocals were not new but were instead lifted from archive recordings, including &quot;Move On Up&quot;.

Mayfield died from complications of type 2 diabetes at 7:20 EST (12:20 GMT) on December 26, 1999, at the North Fulton Regional Hospital in Roswell, Georgia. He was survived by his wife, Altheida Mayfield; his mother, Mariam Jackson; 10 children; two sisters, Carolyn Falls and Judy Mayfield; a brother, Kenneth Mayfield; and seven grandchildren.

==Musical legacy==
=== Influence ===
Mayfield was among the first of a new wave of mainstream black R&amp;B performing artists and composers injecting social commentary into their work. This &quot;message music&quot; proved immensely popular during the 1960s and 1970s.

Mayfield taught himself how to play guitar, tuning it to the black keys of the piano, giving the guitar an open F-sharp tuning that he used throughout his career. He primarily sang in falsetto register. His guitar playing, singing, and socially aware song-writing influenced a range of artists, including Jimi Hendrix, Bob Marley, Tracy Chapman, Sly Stone, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Sinéad O&#x27;Connor.

In 2017, it was reported that Lionel Richie had secured the rights to produce a biographical film about Mayfield. Richie said, &quot;I&#x27;m so grateful to be working closely with [Mayfield&#x27;s widow] Altheida Mayfield, [son] Cheaa Mayfield and the Curtis Mayfield Estate and couldn&#x27;t be happier to be moving forward on this amazing project about a one-of-a-kind music genius.&quot;

<text>William Edward &quot;Little Willie&quot; John (November 15, 1937 – May 26, 1968) was an American R&amp;B singer who performed in the 1950s and early 1960s. He is best known for his successes on the record charts, with songs such as &quot;All Around the World&quot; (1955), &quot;Need Your Love So Bad&quot; (1956), &quot;Talk to Me, Talk to Me&quot; (1958), &quot;Leave My Kitten Alone&quot; (1960), &quot;Sleep&quot; (1960), and his number-one R&amp;B hit &quot;Fever&quot; (1956). An important figure in R&amp;B music of the 1950s, he faded into obscurity in the 1960s and died while serving a prison sentence for manslaughter. 

John was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. In 2022, John was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame.

==Biography==
John was born in Cullendale, Arkansas, on November 15, 1937. He was one of ten children born to Lillie (née Robinson) and Mertis John. Many sources erroneously give his middle name as Edgar. His family moved to Detroit, Michigan, when he was four, so that his father could find factory work. In the late 1940s, the eldest children, including Willie, formed a gospel singing group. Willie also performed in talent shows, which brought him to the notice of Johnny Otis and, later, the musician and producer Henry Glover. After seeing him sing with the Paul &quot;Hucklebuck&quot; Williams orchestra, Glover signed him to a recording contract with King Records in 1955. He was nicknamed &quot;Little Willie&quot; for his short stature.

John&#x27;s first recording, a version of Titus Turner&#x27;s &quot;All Around the World&quot;, was a hit, reaching number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. He followed up with a string of R&amp;B hits, including the original version of &quot;Need Your Love So Bad&quot;, co-written with his elder brother Mertis John Jr. One of his biggest hits, &quot;Fever&quot; (1956) (Pop number 24, R&amp;B number 1), sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. A famous cover version was recorded by Peggy Lee in 1958. Another song, &quot;Talk to Me, Talk to Me&quot;, recorded in 1958, reached number 5 on the R&amp;B chart and number 20 on the Pop chart. It also sold over one million copies. A few years later it was a hit once again in a cover version by Sunny &amp; the Sunglows. On December 23, 1959, John also recorded &quot;I&#x27;m Shakin&#x27;&quot;, by Rudy Toombs, &quot;Suffering with the Blues&quot;, &quot;My Love Is,&quot; and &quot;Sleep&quot; (1960, Pop number 13). In all, John made the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 a total of fourteen times. A cover version of &quot;Need Your Love So Bad&quot; by Fleetwood Mac was also a hit in Europe. Another of his songs to be covered was &quot;Leave My Kitten Alone&quot; (1959), recorded by The Beatles in 1964 and intended for their &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; album. However, the track was not released until 1995.

John performed for the famed Cavalcade of Jazz concert produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. held at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on August 3, 1958. The other headliners were Ernie Freeman and his Band, Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, The Clark Kids and Bo Rhambo. Sammy Davis Jr. was there to crown the winner of the Miss Cavalcade of Jazz beauty contest. The event featured the top four prominent disc jockeys of Los Angeles.

John was involved in the civil rights fight against segregation. He performed a benefit concert for the NAACP in 1964, telling &quot;Jet&quot; magazine: &quot;As entertainers, we can no longer sit and wait for the Sammy Davis&#x27; and Harry Belafonte&#x27;s to raise all of the money.&quot;

John was also known for his short temper and propensity to abuse alcohol. He was arrested multiple times for charges that include narcotics, swindling, and grand larceny. John was dropped by his record company, King Records, in 1963. In 1965, he was convicted of manslaughter for the 1964 stabbing of Kendall Roundtree in Seattle. He was sent to Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla. John appealed the conviction and was released on probation while the case was reconsidered, during which time he recorded what was intended to be his comeback album. Due to contractual disputes and the decline of his appeal, it was not released until 2008 (as &quot;Nineteen Sixty Six&quot;).

John died at Washington State Penitentiary on May 26, 1968. Despite counterclaims, the cause of death stated on his death certificate was a heart attack. His interment was in Detroit Memorial Park East, in Warren, Michigan.

John was survived by his wife Darlynn (née Bonner), whom he married on May 25, 1957; two children, William Kevin John (b. February 3, 1958) and Darryl Keith John (b. January 25, 1960); his mother; five brothers; three sisters. One of his sisters was Mable John, who recorded for Motown and Stax and was member of The Raelettes, the vocal quartette backing Ray Charles. His son Keith John is a backing vocalist for Stevie Wonder.

== Legacy and honors ==
John was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, presented by Stevie Wonder.

James Brown, who early in his career had opened shows for John, recorded a tribute album, &quot;Thinking About Little Willie John and a Few Nice Things&quot;.

The guitarist and songwriter Robbie Robertson, formerly of The Band, mentioned John in the song &quot;Somewhere Down the Crazy River&quot;, on his 1987 self-titled album. John was also mentioned in Tom Russell&#x27;s &quot;Blue Wing&quot; and Mark Lanegan&#x27;s &quot;Like Little Willie John&quot;, from his 2004 album &quot;Bubblegum&quot;. The Swedish singer songwriter Peter LeMarc recorded a song entitled &quot;Little Willie John&quot; in 1991.

A biography, &quot;Fever: Little Willie John, a Fast Life, Mysterious Death and the Birth of Soul&quot;, by Susan Whitall with Kevin John (another of his sons), was published by Titan Books in 2011.

Little Willie John was posthumously inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2014 as a singer and in 2016 as a songwriter.

In June 2016, Little Willie John was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.

In 2022, John was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame. His induction citation noted &quot;... John was a sharply attired and exciting showstopper, recalled by fellow singers as mischievous, fun-loving, and generous&quot;.

<text>Simca (; Mechanical and Automotive Body Manufacturing Company) was a French automaker, founded in November 1934 by Fiat S.p.A. and directed from July 1935 to May 1963 by Italian Henri Pigozzi. Simca was affiliated with Fiat and, after Simca bought Ford&#x27;s French subsidiary, became increasingly controlled by Chrysler. In 1970, Simca became a brand of Chrysler&#x27;s European business, ending its period as an independent company. Simca disappeared in 1978, when Chrysler divested its European operations to another French automaker, PSA Peugeot Citroën. PSA replaced the Simca brand with Talbot after a short period when some models were badged as Simca-Talbots.

During most of its post-war activity, Simca was one of the biggest automobile manufacturers in France. The Simca 1100 was for some time the best-selling car in France, while the Simca 1307 and Simca Horizon won the coveted European Car of the Year title in 1976 and 1979, respectively—these models were badge engineered as products of other marques in some countries. For instance the Simca 1307 was sold in Britain as the Chrysler Alpine and the Horizon was also sold under the Chrysler brand.

Simca vehicles were also manufactured by Simca do Brasil in São Bernardo do Campo, Brazil, and Barreiros (another Chrysler subsidiary) in Spain. They were also assembled in Australia, Chile, Colombia and the Netherlands during the Chrysler era. In Argentina, Simca had a small partnership with Metalmecánica SAIC (better known as de Carlo) for the production of the Simca Ariane in 1965.

== Foundation ==
Henri Pigozzi was active in the automotive business in the early 1920s when he met Fiat founder Giovanni Agnelli. They began business together in 1922 with Pigozzi acting as a scrap merchant, buying old automobile bodies and sending them to Fiat for recycling. Two years later Pigozzi became Fiat&#x27;s General Agent in France and in 1926 SAFAF (Société Anonyme Française des Automobiles Fiat) was founded. In 1928, SAFAF started the assembly of Fiat cars in Suresnes near Paris and licensed the production of some parts to local suppliers. By 1934, as many as 30,000 Fiat cars were sold by SAFAF.

== Simca-Fiat ==

The SIMCA (&quot;Société Industrielle de Mécanique et de Carrosserie Automobile&quot;) company was founded in 1935 by Fiat S.p.A., when it bought the former Donnet factory in the French town of Nanterre.

The first cars produced were Fiat 508 Balillas and Fiat 518 Arditas, but with Simca-Fiat 6CV and 11CV badges. They were followed during 1936 by the 3CV Simca 5, a version of the Fiat Topolino announced in the Spring, but only available for sale from October 1936. Its name references the first digit of the car&#x27;s 570 cc displacement. The Huit, a 6CV version of the Fiat 508C-1100, appeared in late 1937 for the 1938 model year - hence its name. Production of the 6CV and 11CV stopped in 1937, leaving the 5 and the 8 in production until the outbreak of World War II. The firm nevertheless remained closely connected with Fiat, and it was not until 1938 that the shortened name &quot;Simca&quot; replaced &quot;Simca-Fiat&quot;.

Of the businesses that emerged as France&#x27;s big four auto-makers after the war, Simca was unique in not suffering serious bomb damage to its plant. There were persistent suggestions that Henri Pigozzi&#x27;s close personal relationship with the Agnelli family (which owned Fiat) and Fiat&#x27;s powerful political influence with the Mussolini government in Italy secured relatively favourable treatment for Simca during the years when France fell under the control of Italy&#x27;s powerful ally, Germany. Despite France being occupied, Simca cars continued to be produced in small numbers throughout the war.

Following the 1944 liberation, the company&#x27;s close association with Italy became an obvious liability in the feverish atmosphere of recrimination and new beginnings that swept France following four years of German occupation. Nevertheless, shortly after the liberation the Nanterre plant&#x27;s financial sustainability received a boost when Simca won a contract from the American army to repair large numbers of Jeep engines.

==1946: a decisive year==
On 3 January 1946 the new government&#x27;s five-year plan for the automobile industry (remembered, without affection, as the Pons Plan) came into force. Government plans for Simca involved pushing it into a merger with various smaller companies such as Delahaye-Delage, Bernard, Laffly and Unic so as to create an automobile manufacturing combine to be called “Générale française automobile” (GFA). With half an eye on the Volkswagen project across the Rhine, the authorities determined that GFA should produce the two door version of the &quot;AFG&quot;, a small family car that had been developed during the war by the influential automobile engineer, Jean-Albert Grégoire. Grégoire owed his influence to a powerfully persuasive personality and a considerable engineering talent. Regarding the future of the French automobile industry, Grégoire held strong opinions, two of which favoured front-wheel drive and aluminium as a material for car bodies. A few weeks after the liberation Grégoire joined the Simca board as General Technical Director, in order to prepare for the production of the AFG at the company&#x27;s Nanterre factory.

For Simca, faced with a determinedly dirigiste left-wing French government, the prospect of nationalisation seemed very real. (Renault had already been confiscated and nationalised by the government at the start of 1945.) Simca&#x27;s long standing (but Italian born) Director General, Henri Pigozzi, was obliged to deploy his very considerable reserves of guile and charm in order to retain his own position within the company, and it appears that in the end Pigozzi owed his very survival at Simca to the intervention with the national politicians of his new board room colleague, Jean-Albert Grégoire. In return, Grégoire obtained the personal commitment of the surviving Director General to the production at Nanterre of his two-door AFG.

It is very easy to see how the two-door AFG looked, because its four-door equivalent went into production, little changed from Grégoire&#x27;s prototype, as the Panhard Dyna X. It was a car designed by an engineer, and Pigozzi thought it ugly. In trying to make it more appealing to the style conscious car buyers who, it was hoped, would appear in Simca showrooms once the economy picked up and government restrictions on car ownership began to be relaxed, Simca designers took the underpinnings of the Grégoire prototype and clothed it with various more conventionally modern bodies, the last of which looked uncannily similar to a shortened Peugeot 203. This “Simca-Grégoire” performed satisfactorily in road tests in France and around Turin (home town of Fiat who still owned Simca), and by September 1946 the car was deemed ready for production. But Pigozzi was still cautious. He had little enthusiasm for the gratuitously unfathomable complexities involved in producing a mass-market front-wheel drive car. The experience of the Citroën Traction Avant, which had bankrupted its manufacturer in the mid-1930s, was not encouraging. Pigozzi therefore applied to the (at this stage still strongly interventionist) government for a far higher level of government subsidy than the government could contemplate. Both the “Simca-Grégoire” project and the government&#x27;s own enthusiasm for micro-managing the French automobile industry were by now running out of momentum. Sensing that there was no prospect of putting the “Simca-Grégoire” into production any time soon, General Technical Director Grégoire resigned from the company early in 1947.

Meanwhile, at the first Paris Motor Show since the end of the war, in October 1946, two models were on display on the Simca stand, being the Simca 5 and the Simca 8, at this stage barely distinguishable from their pre-war equivalents. A new car arrived in 1948 with the Simca 6, a development of the Simca 5 which it would eventually replace, featuring an overhead valve 570 cc engine: the Simca 6 was launched ahead of the introduction of the equivalent Fiat.

The French economy in this period was in a precarious condition and government pressure was applied on the automakers to maximize export sales. During the first eight months of 1947, Simca exported 70% of cars produced, placing it behind Citroën (92% exported), Renault (90% exported), Peugeot (87% exported) and Ford France (83% exported). In the struggle to maximize exports, Simca was handicapped by the fact that it was not allowed to compete directly with its principal Italian shareholder, Fiat.

== Aronde and Ford SAF takeover ==

The Simca Aronde, launched in 1951, was the first Simca model not based on a Fiat design. It had a 1200 cc engine and its production reached 100,000 units yearly. Following this success, Simca took over the French truck manufacturers Unic in 1951, Saurer in 1956, and the Poissy plant of Ford SAF in 1954. The Poissy plant had ample room for expansion, enabling Simca to consolidate French production in a single plant and, in 1961, to sell the old Nanterre plant.

The 1950s was a decade of growth for Simca, and by 1959 the combined output of the plants at Nanterre and at Poissy had exceeded 225,000 cars, placing the manufacturer in second place among French automakers in volume terms, ahead of Peugeot and Citroën, though still far behind market leader Renault.

The Ford purchase also added the V-8 powered Ford Vedette range to the Simca stable. This model continued to be produced and progressively upgraded until 1962 in France and 1967 in Brazil, but with various names under the Simca badge. An Aronde-powered version was also made in 1957 and called the Ariane which, because it was economical and had a large body, was popular as a taxi.

In 1958, Simca bought the French Talbot-Lago manufacturing company.

==Brazil==
The Simca plant received a visit by Juscelino Kubitschek before his inauguration in 1956, organized by a Brazilian General who had a family member employed there. He jokingly invited Simca to build a plant in Minas Gerais, his home state. Simca followed through and sent a letter of intent to this effect. In the interim, Brazil had formed an (GEIA), which had established a set of requirements for any producer wishing to establish a plant in Brazil. Simca claimed that their proposal and arrangement with Kubitschek pre-dated these rules and lobbied for exceptions. Simca also lobbied directly in Minas, but in the end were forced to present their own proposal, which was accepted with a number of conditions. The delays in passing the GEIA rules meant that Simca, which established its first plant in São Paulo, was unable to access hard currency and suffered severe parts shortages as a result. Simca quickly developed a reputation for low quality which it was unable to shake.

Simca do Brasil was originally 50% Brazilian-owned, but after Chrysler took over Simca France in 1966 they also obtained control of the Brazilian arm. Simca remained based in São Paulo for the entire time they were active in Brazil and never moved to Minas, as originally promised. Their range was built around the 2.4 liter V8-engined Simca Vedette, which entered production in Brazil in March 1959. It was built under a variety of names and in a number of different bodystyles, until the Simca badge was retired there in 1969. Later models were redesigned completely, and were sold as the Simca Esplanada.

== Fulgur ==
The Simca Fulgur was a concept car designed in 1958 by Robert Opron for Simca and first displayed at the 1959 Geneva Auto Show. It was also displayed at the New York Auto Show, and the 1961 Chicago Auto Show. The concept car was intended to show what cars in the year 2000 would look like. It was to be atomic powered, voice controlled, guided by radar, and use only two wheels balanced by gyroscopes when driven at over 150 km/h. Fulgur is Latin for &quot;flash&quot; or &quot;lightning&quot;.

== Chrysler ==
In 1958, the American car manufacturer Chrysler, which wanted to enter the European car market, bought 15% of Simca from Ford in a deal which Henry Ford II was later reported as having publicly regretted. At this stage, however, the dominant shareholder remained Fiat S.p.A., and their influence is apparent in the engineering and design of Simcas of that period such as the 1000 and 1300 models introduced respectively in 1961 and 1963. However, in 1963 Chrysler increased their stake to a controlling 64% by purchasing stock from Fiat, and they subsequently extended that holding further to 77%. Even in 1971 Fiat retained a 19% holding, but by now they had long ceased to play an active role in the business.

Also, in 1964 Chrysler bought the British manufacturer Rootes thus putting together the basis of Chrysler Europe. All the Simca models manufactured after 1967 had the Chrysler pentastar logo as well as Simca badging. In 1961, Simca started to manufacture all of its models in the ex-Ford SAF factory in Poissy and sold the factory at Nanterre to Citroën. The rear-engined Simca 1000 was introduced in 1961 with its sporting offspring, the Simca-Abarth in 1963. The 1000 also served as the platform for the 1000 Coupe, a sports coupe sporting a Bertone-designed body by Giorgetto Giugiaro and 4-wheel disc brakes. It debuted in 1963 and was described by Car Magazine as &quot;the world&#x27;s neatest small coupe&quot;. 1967 saw the more powerful 1200S Bertone Coupe that, with a horsepower upgrade in 1970, could reach the dizzying speed of almost 112 mph (180 km/h), making it the fastest standard production Simca ever built. In 1967, a much more up to date car, the 1100, appeared with front wheel drive and independent suspension all round, and continued in production until 1979. On 1 July 1970 the company title was formally changed to Chrysler France.

Having increased their stake to 77% of Simca in 1963 and taken control of the Rootes Group by mid-1964, Chrysler had already marketed numerous Simca and Rootes models in the United States, including the Simca 1204, via a new &quot;Simca-Rootes Division&quot;, formed in 1966
— with 850 dealers selling four Simca models and 400 dealers selling four Rootes models. Results were dismal, and in late 1969, Chrysler announced it would henceforth market its Rootes and Simca products from its Chrysler-Plymouth Division. The Simca 1204 was imported to the United States through 1971, marketed next to another captive import, the Plymouth Cricket, at its Plymouth dealerships.

== Collapse of Chrysler Europe ==
The most successful pre-Chrysler Simca models were the Aronde, the Simca 1000 and the front-engined 1100 compact. During the 1970s Chrysler era, Simca produced the new Chrysler 160/180/2 litre saloon, 1307 range (Chrysler Alpine in the UK) and later the Horizon, (Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon in the USA). The 1307 and Horizon were both named European Car of the Year at launch. However, Chrysler&#x27;s forced marriage of Simca and Rootes was not a happy one - Chrysler Europe collapsed in 1977 and the remains were sold to Peugeot SA the following year for a nominal US$1.00 plus assumption of outstanding debt. The cars sold reasonably well in France, but were outsold by their key Ford, British Leyland and Vauxhall rivals in Britain.

The last remaining Simca and Rootes models were discontinued by the end of 1981, and the Simca-based Alpine and Horizon soldiered on through the first half of the 1980s using the resurrected Talbot badge, which itself had vanished from passenger cars within a decade.

Meanwhile, Peugeot expanded its own brand and made use of the former Simca and Rootes factories for production of its own vehicles, although the Talbot brand survived into the 1990s on commercial vehicles.

==Afterlife==
Peugeot eventually abandoned the Talbot brand, and the last Simca design was launched as Peugeot 309 (instead of Talbot Arizona as had been originally planned). The Peugeot 309 used Simca engines until October 1991 (some 18 months before the end of production) when they were replaced by PSA&#x27;s own TU and XU series of engines. The 309 was produced at the former Rootes factory in Ryton-on-Dunsmore, UK, as well as in the Poissy plant.

Simcas were also manufactured in Brazil, Colombia, Spain and Finland. The last Simca-based car produced was the Horizon-based Dodge Omni, which was built in the USA until 1990. The European equivalent had already been axed three years earlier when use of the Talbot name on passenger cars was finally discontinued.

<text>In physics, scattering is a wide range of physical processes where moving particles or radiation of some form, such as light or sound, are forced to deviate from a straight trajectory by localized non-uniformities (including particles and radiation) in the medium through which they pass. In conventional use, this also includes deviation of reflected radiation from the angle predicted by the law of reflection. Reflections of radiation that undergo scattering are often called &quot;diffuse reflections&quot; and unscattered reflections are called &quot;specular&quot; (mirror-like) reflections. Originally, the term was confined to light scattering (going back at least as far as Isaac Newton in the 17th century). As more &quot;ray&quot;-like phenomena were discovered, the idea of scattering was extended to them, so that William Herschel could refer to the scattering of &quot;heat rays&quot; (not then recognized as electromagnetic in nature) in 1800. John Tyndall, a pioneer in light scattering research, noted the connection between light scattering and acoustic scattering in the 1870s. Near the end of the 19th century, the scattering of cathode rays (electron beams) and X-rays was observed and discussed. With the discovery of subatomic particles (e.g. Ernest Rutherford in 1911) and the development of quantum theory in the 20th century, the sense of the term became broader as it was recognized that the same mathematical frameworks used in light scattering could be applied to many other phenomena.

Scattering can refer to the consequences of particle-particle collisions between molecules, atoms, electrons, photons and other particles. Examples include: cosmic ray scattering in the Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere; particle collisions inside particle accelerators; electron scattering by gas atoms in fluorescent lamps; and neutron scattering inside nuclear reactors.

The types of non-uniformities which can cause scattering, sometimes known as &quot;scatterers&quot; or &quot;scattering centers&quot;, are too numerous to list, but a small sample includes particles, bubbles, droplets, density fluctuations in fluids, crystallites in polycrystalline solids, defects in monocrystalline solids, surface roughness, cells in organisms, and textile fibers in clothing. The effects of such features on the path of almost any type of propagating wave or moving particle can be described in the framework of scattering theory.

Some areas where scattering and scattering theory are significant include radar sensing, medical ultrasound, semiconductor wafer inspection, polymerization process monitoring, acoustic tiling, free-space communications and computer-generated imagery. Particle-particle scattering theory is important in areas such as particle physics, atomic, molecular, and optical physics, nuclear physics and astrophysics. In particle physics the quantum interaction and scattering of fundamental particles is described by the Scattering Matrix or S-Matrix, introduced and developed by John Archibald Wheeler and Werner Heisenberg.

Scattering is quantified using many different concepts, including scattering cross section (σ), attenuation coefficients, the bidirectional scattering distribution function (BSDF), S-matrices, and mean free path.

==Single and multiple scattering==

When radiation is only scattered by one localized scattering center, this is called &quot;single scattering&quot;. It is more common that scattering centers are grouped together; in such cases, radiation may scatter many times, in what is known as &quot;multiple scattering&quot;. The main difference between the effects of single and multiple scattering is that single scattering can usually be treated as a random phenomenon, whereas multiple scattering, somewhat counterintuitively, can be modeled as a more deterministic process because the combined results of a large number of scattering events tend to average out. Multiple scattering can thus often be modeled well with diffusion theory.

Because the location of a single scattering center is not usually well known relative to the path of the radiation, the outcome, which tends to depend strongly on the exact incoming trajectory, appears random to an observer. This type of scattering would be exemplified by an electron being fired at an atomic nucleus. In this case, the atom&#x27;s exact position relative to the path of the electron is unknown and would be unmeasurable, so the exact trajectory of the electron after the collision cannot be predicted. Single scattering is therefore often described by probability distributions.

With multiple scattering, the randomness of the interaction tends to be averaged out by a large number of scattering events, so that the final path of the radiation appears to be a deterministic distribution of intensity. This is exemplified by a light beam passing through thick fog. Multiple scattering is highly analogous to diffusion, and the terms &quot;multiple scattering&quot; and &quot;diffusion&quot; are interchangeable in many contexts. Optical elements designed to produce multiple scattering are thus known as &quot;diffusers&quot;. Coherent backscattering, an enhancement of backscattering that occurs when coherent radiation is multiply scattered by a random medium, is usually attributed to weak localization.

Not all single scattering is random, however. A well-controlled laser beam can be exactly positioned to scatter off a microscopic particle with a deterministic outcome, for instance. Such situations are encountered in radar scattering as well, where the targets tend to be macroscopic objects such as people or aircraft.

Similarly, multiple scattering can sometimes have somewhat random outcomes, particularly with coherent radiation. The random fluctuations in the multiply scattered intensity of coherent radiation are called speckles. Speckle also occurs if multiple parts of a coherent wave scatter from different centers. In certain rare circumstances, multiple scattering may only involve a small number of interactions such that the randomness is not completely averaged out. These systems are considered to be some of the most difficult to model accurately.

The description of scattering and the distinction between single and multiple scattering are tightly related to wave–particle duality.

== Theory ==

Scattering theory is a framework for studying and understanding the scattering of waves and particles. Wave scattering corresponds to the collision and scattering of a wave with some material object, for instance (sunlight) scattered by rain drops to form a rainbow. Scattering also includes the interaction of billiard balls on a table, the Rutherford scattering (or angle change) of alpha particles by gold nuclei, the Bragg scattering (or diffraction) of electrons and X-rays by a cluster of atoms, and the inelastic scattering of a fission fragment as it traverses a thin foil. More precisely, scattering consists of the study of how solutions of partial differential equations, propagating freely &quot;in the distant past&quot;, come together and interact with one another or with a boundary condition, and then propagate away &quot;to the distant future&quot;.

The direct scattering problem is the problem of determining the distribution of scattered radiation/particle flux basing on the characteristics of the scatterer. The inverse scattering problem is the problem of determining the characteristics of an object (e.g., its shape, internal constitution) from measurement data of radiation or particles scattered from the object.

===Attenuation due to scattering===
When the target is a set of many scattering centers whose relative position varies unpredictably, it is customary to think of a range equation whose arguments take different forms in different application areas. In the simplest case consider an interaction that removes particles from the &quot;unscattered beam&quot; at a uniform rate that is proportional to the incident number of particles per unit area per unit time (formula_1), i.e. that

:formula_2

where &quot;Q&quot; is an interaction coefficient and &quot;x&quot; is the distance traveled in the target.

The above ordinary first-order differential equation has solutions of the form:

: formula_3

where &quot;I&quot;o is the initial flux, path length Δx ≡ &quot;x&quot; − &quot;x&quot;o, the second equality defines an interaction mean free path λ, the third uses the number of targets per unit volume η to define an area cross-section σ, and the last uses the target mass density ρ to define a density mean free path τ. Hence one converts between these quantities via &quot;Q&quot; = 1/&quot;λ&quot; = &quot;ησ&quot; = &quot;ρ/τ&quot;, as shown in the figure at left.

In electromagnetic absorption spectroscopy, for example, interaction coefficient (e.g. Q in cm−1) is variously called opacity, absorption coefficient, and attenuation coefficient. In nuclear physics, area cross-sections (e.g. σ in barns or units of 10−24 cm2), density mean free path (e.g. τ in grams/cm2), and its reciprocal the mass attenuation coefficient (e.g. in cm2/gram) or &quot;area per nucleon&quot; are all popular, while in electron microscopy the inelastic mean free path (e.g. λ in nanometers) is often discussed instead.

===Elastic and inelastic scattering===
The term &quot;elastic scattering&quot; implies that the internal states of the scattering particles do not change, and hence they emerge unchanged from the scattering process. In inelastic scattering, by contrast, the particles&#x27; internal state is changed, which may amount to exciting some of the electrons of a scattering atom, or the complete annihilation of a scattering particle and the creation of entirely new particles.

The example of scattering in quantum chemistry is particularly instructive, as the theory is reasonably complex while still having a good foundation on which to build an intuitive understanding. When two atoms are scattered off one another, one can understand them as being the bound state solutions of some differential equation. Thus, for example, the hydrogen atom corresponds to a solution to the Schrödinger equation with a negative inverse-power (i.e., attractive Coulombic) central potential. The scattering of two hydrogen atoms will disturb the state of each atom, resulting in one or both becoming excited, or even ionized, representing an inelastic scattering process.

The term &quot;deep inelastic scattering&quot; refers to a special kind of scattering experiment in particle physics.

===Mathematical framework===
In mathematics, scattering theory deals with a more abstract formulation of the same set of concepts. For example, if a differential equation is known to have some simple, localized solutions, and the solutions are a function of a single parameter, that parameter can take the conceptual role of time. One then asks what might happen if two such solutions are set up far away from each other, in the &quot;distant past&quot;, and are made to move towards each other, interact (under the constraint of the differential equation) and then move apart in the &quot;future&quot;. The scattering matrix then pairs solutions in the &quot;distant past&quot; to those in the &quot;distant future&quot;.

Solutions to differential equations are often posed on manifolds. Frequently, the means to the solution requires the study of the spectrum of an operator on the manifold. As a result, the solutions often have a spectrum that can be identified with a Hilbert space, and scattering is described by a certain map, the S matrix, on Hilbert spaces. Solutions with a discrete spectrum correspond to bound states in quantum mechanics, while a continuous spectrum is associated with scattering states. The study of inelastic scattering then asks how discrete and continuous spectra are mixed together.

An important, notable development is the inverse scattering transform, central to the solution of many exactly solvable models.

==Theoretical physics==

In mathematical physics, scattering theory is a framework for studying and understanding the interaction or scattering of solutions to partial differential equations. In acoustics, the differential equation is the wave equation, and scattering studies how its solutions, the sound waves, scatter from solid objects or propagate through non-uniform media (such as sound waves, in sea water, coming from a submarine). In the case of classical electrodynamics, the differential equation is again the wave equation, and the scattering of light or radio waves is studied. In particle physics, the equations are those of Quantum electrodynamics, Quantum chromodynamics and the Standard Model, the solutions of which correspond to fundamental particles.

In regular quantum mechanics, which includes quantum chemistry, the relevant equation is the Schrödinger equation, although equivalent formulations, such as the Lippmann-Schwinger equation and the Faddeev equations, are also largely used. The solutions of interest describe the long-term motion of free atoms, molecules, photons, electrons, and protons. The scenario is that several particles come together from an infinite distance away. These reagents then collide, optionally reacting, getting destroyed or creating new particles. The products and unused reagents then fly away to infinity again. (The atoms and molecules are effectively particles for our purposes. Also, under everyday circumstances, only photons are being created and destroyed.) The solutions reveal which directions the products are most likely to fly off to and how quickly. They also reveal the probability of various reactions, creations, and decays occurring. There are two predominant techniques of finding solutions to scattering problems: partial wave analysis, and the Born approximation.

== Electromagnetics ==
Electromagnetic waves are one of the best known and most commonly encountered forms of radiation that undergo scattering. Scattering of light and radio waves (especially in radar) is particularly important. Several different aspects of electromagnetic scattering are distinct enough to have conventional names. Major forms of elastic light scattering (involving negligible energy transfer) are Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering. Inelastic scattering includes Brillouin scattering, Raman scattering, inelastic X-ray scattering and Compton scattering.

Light scattering is one of the two major physical processes that contribute to the visible appearance of most objects, the other being absorption. Surfaces described as &quot;white&quot; owe their appearance to multiple scattering of light by internal or surface inhomogeneities in the object, for example by the boundaries of transparent microscopic crystals that make up a stone or by the microscopic fibers in a sheet of paper. More generally, the gloss (or lustre or sheen) of the surface is determined by scattering. Highly scattering surfaces are described as being dull or having a matte finish, while the absence of surface scattering leads to a glossy appearance, as with polished metal or stone.

Spectral absorption, the selective absorption of certain colors, determines the color of most objects with some modification by elastic scattering. The apparent blue color of veins in skin is a common example where both spectral absorption and scattering play important and complex roles in the coloration. Light scattering can also create color without absorption, often shades of blue, as with the sky (Rayleigh scattering), the human blue iris, and the feathers of some birds (Prum et al. 1998). However, resonant light scattering in nanoparticles can produce many different highly saturated and vibrant hues, especially when surface plasmon resonance is involved (Roqué et al. 2006).

Models of light scattering can be divided into three domains based on a dimensionless size parameter, &quot;α&quot; which is defined as:
formula_4
where &quot;πD&quot;p is the circumference of a particle and &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength of incident radiation in the medium. Based on the value of &quot;α&quot;, these domains are:
* &quot;α&quot; ≪ 1: Rayleigh scattering (small particle compared to wavelength of light);
* &quot;α&quot; ≈ 1: Mie scattering (particle about the same size as wavelength of light, valid only for spheres);
* &quot;α&quot; ≫ 1: geometric scattering (particle much larger than wavelength of light).

Rayleigh scattering is a process in which electromagnetic radiation (including light) is scattered by a small spherical volume of variant refractive indexes, such as a particle, bubble, droplet, or even a density fluctuation. This effect was first modeled successfully by Lord Rayleigh, from whom it gets its name. In order for Rayleigh&#x27;s model to apply, the sphere must be much smaller in diameter than the wavelength (&quot;λ&quot;) of the scattered wave; typically the upper limit is taken to be about 1/10 the wavelength. In this size regime, the exact shape of the scattering center is usually not very significant and can often be treated as a sphere of equivalent volume. The inherent scattering that radiation undergoes passing through a pure gas is due to microscopic density fluctuations as the gas molecules move around, which are normally small enough in scale for Rayleigh&#x27;s model to apply. This scattering mechanism is the primary cause of the blue color of the Earth&#x27;s sky on a clear day, as the shorter blue wavelengths of sunlight passing overhead are more strongly scattered than the longer red wavelengths according to Rayleigh&#x27;s famous 1/&quot;λ&quot;4 relation. Along with absorption, such scattering is a major cause of the attenuation of radiation by the atmosphere. The degree of scattering varies as a function of the ratio of the particle diameter to the wavelength of the radiation, along with many other factors including polarization, angle, and coherence.

For larger diameters, the problem of electromagnetic scattering by spheres was first solved by Gustav Mie, and scattering by spheres larger than the Rayleigh range is therefore usually known as Mie scattering. In the Mie regime, the shape of the scattering center becomes much more significant and the theory only applies well to spheres and, with some modification, spheroids and ellipsoids. Closed-form solutions for scattering by certain other simple shapes exist, but no general closed-form solution is known for arbitrary shapes.

Both Mie and Rayleigh scattering are considered elastic scattering processes, in which the energy (and thus wavelength and frequency) of the light is not substantially changed. However, electromagnetic radiation scattered by moving scattering centers does undergo a Doppler shift, which can be detected and used to measure the velocity of the scattering center/s in forms of techniques such as lidar and radar. This shift involves a slight change in energy.

At values of the ratio of particle diameter to wavelength more than about 10, the laws of geometric optics are mostly sufficient to describe the interaction of light with the particle. Mie theory can still be used for these larger spheres, but the solution often becomes numerically unwieldy.

For modeling of scattering in cases where the Rayleigh and Mie models do not apply such as larger, irregularly shaped particles, there are many numerical methods that can be used. The most common are finite-element methods which solve Maxwell&#x27;s equations to find the distribution of the scattered electromagnetic field. Sophisticated software packages exist which allow the user to specify the refractive index or indices of the scattering feature in space, creating a 2- or sometimes 3-dimensional model of the structure. For relatively large and complex structures, these models usually require substantial execution times on a computer.

Electrophoresis involves the migration of macromolecules under the influence of an electric field. Electrophoretic light scattering involves passing an electric field through a liquid which makes particles move. The bigger the charge is on the particles, the faster they are able to move.

<text>Kate Douglas Wiggin (September 28, 1856August 24, 1923) was an American educator, author and composer. She wrote children&#x27;s stories, most notably the classic children&#x27;s novel &quot;Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm,&quot; and composed collections of children&#x27;s songs. She started the first free kindergarten in San Francisco in 1878 (the Silver Street Free Kindergarten). With her sister Nora during the 1880s, she also established a training school for kindergarten teachers. Wiggin devoted her adult life to the welfare of children in an era when children were commonly thought of as cheap labor.

Wiggin went to California to study kindergarten methods. She began to teach in San Francisco with her sister assisting her, and the two were instrumental in the establishment of over 60 kindergartens for the poor in San Francisco and Oakland. When she later moved from California to New York, without kindergarten work on hand, she devoted herself to literature. She sent &quot;The Story of Patsy&quot; and &quot;The Bird&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; to Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co., who accepted them at once. 

Besides her talent for storytelling, she was also a musician, sang well, and composed settings for her poems. She was also an excellent elocutionist. 

After the death of her husband in 1889, she returned to California to resume her kindergarten work, serving as the head of a kindergarten normal school. Some of her other works included &quot;Cathedral Courtship&quot;, &quot;A Summer in a Canon&quot;, &quot;Timothy&#x27;s Quest&quot;, &quot;The Story Hour&quot;, &quot;Kindergarten Chimes&quot;, &quot;Polly Oliver&#x27;s Problem&quot;, and &quot;Children&#x27;s Rights&quot;.

==Early life==
Kate Douglas Smith Wiggin was born in Philadelphia, the daughter of lawyer Robert N. Smith, and of Welsh descent. Wiggin experienced a happy childhood, even though it was colored by the American Civil War and her father&#x27;s death. She and her sister Nora were still quite young when their widowed mother moved her little family from Philadelphia to Portland, Maine, then, three years later, upon her remarriage, to the little village of Hollis. There she matured in rural surroundings, with her sister and her new baby brother Philip.

Notably, she once met the novelist Charles Dickens. Her mother and another relative had gone to hear Dickens read in Portland, but Wiggin, aged 11, was thought to be too young to warrant an expensive ticket. The following day, she found herself on the same train as Dickens and engaged him in a lively conversation for the course of the journey, an experience which she later detailed in a short memoir titled &quot;A Child&#x27;s Journey with Dickens&quot; (1912).

Her education was spotty, consisting of a short stint at a dame school; some home schooling under the &quot;capable, slightly impatient, somewhat sporadic&quot; instruction of Albion Bradbury (her stepfather); a brief spell at the district school; a year as a boarder at the Gorham Female Seminary, a winter term at Morison Academy in Baltimore, Maryland; and a few months&#x27; stay at Abbot Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, where she graduated with the class of 1873. Although rather casual, this was more education than most women received at the time.

==Early career==
In 1873, hoping to ease Albion Bradbury&#x27;s lung disease, Wiggin&#x27;s family moved to Santa Barbara, California, where her stepfather died three years later. A kindergarten training class was opening in Los Angeles under Emma Marwedel (1818–1893), and Wiggin enrolled. After graduation, in 1878, she headed the first free kindergarten in California, on Silver Street in the slums of San Francisco. The children were &quot;street Arabs of the wildest type&quot;, but she had a loving personality and dramatic flair. By 1880 she was forming a teacher-training school in conjunction with the Silver Street kindergarten.

In 1881, she married (Samuel) Bradley Wiggin, a San Francisco lawyer. According to the customs of the time, she was required to resign her teaching job. Still devoted to her school, she began to raise money for it through writing, first &quot;The Story of Patsy&quot; (1883), then &quot;The Birds&#x27; Christmas Carol&quot; (1887). Both privately printed books were issued commercially by Houghton Mifflin in 1889, with enormous success.

Wiggin had no children. She moved to New York City in 1888. When her husband died suddenly in 1889, she relocated to Maine. For the rest of her life she grieved; but she also traveled as frequently as she could, dividing her time between writing, visits to Europe, and giving public reading for the benefit of various children&#x27;s charities. She traveled abroad and back from Liverpool in the United Kingdom at least three times. Records from the Ellis Island logs show that she arrived back in New York City from Liverpool in October 1892, July 1893, and July 1894. On the logs for the 1892 trip, Wiggin describes her occupation as &quot;wife&quot;, despite her former husband having died three years prior. In 1893 and 1894, she describes herself as an &quot;authoress&quot;.

On her way to England in 1894, Wiggin met George Christopher Riggs, an importer of dry goods, specifically linen. The pair are said to have hit it off and to have agreed to marry even before the ship docked in England. In the Ellis Island logs from Wiggin&#x27;s 1894 trip back to New York from Liverpool, the two signed their names next to each other, indicating their closeness. They married in New York City on March 30, 1895, at All Souls Church. 

Riggs soon became one of Wiggin&#x27;s biggest advocates as she became more successful. She continued to write under the name of Wiggin after the marriage. Her literary output included popular books for adults. With her sister, she published scholarly work on the educational principles of Friedrich Fröbel: &quot;Froebel&#x27;s Gifts&quot; (1895), &quot;Froebel&#x27;s Occupations&quot; (1896), and &quot;Kindergarten Principles and Practice&quot; (1896). In 1903 she wrote the classic children&#x27;s novel &quot;Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm&quot;, which became an immediate best-seller, as did &quot;Rose o&#x27; the River&quot; in 1905&quot;.&quot; &quot;Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm&quot; and &quot;Mother Carey&#x27;s Chickens&quot; (1911) were adapted to the stage. Houghton Mifflin collected Wiggin&#x27;s writings in 10 volumes in 1917.

For a time, Wiggin lived at Quillcote, her summer home in Hollis, Maine (now listed on the National Register of Historic Places). Quillcote is around the corner from the town library, the Salmon Falls Library, which she founded in 1911. She also founded a Dorcas Society in Hollis and the adjacent town of Buxton, Maine in 1897. The Tory Hill Meeting House in Buxton inspired her book (and later play) &quot;The Old Peabody Pew&quot; (1907).

==Later life and death==
Wiggin was an active and popular hostess in New York and in the community of Upper Largo, Scotland, where she had a summer home and where she organized plays for many years, as detailed in her autobiography &quot;My Garden of Memory.&quot;

In 1921, she and her sister edited an edition of Jane Porter&#x27;s &quot;The Scottish Chiefs&quot;, an 1809 novel of William Wallace, for the Scribner&#x27;s Illustrated Classics series, illustrated by N.C. Wyeth. During the spring of 1923, Wiggin traveled to England as a New York delegate to the Dickens Fellowship. There she became ill and died, at age 66, of bronchial pneumonia. At her request, her ashes were brought home to Maine and scattered over the Saco River. 

Wiggin&#x27;s autobiography was published after her death. In sorting through material for it, she put many items in a box she and her sister labelled &quot;posthumous&quot;, and from these materials her sister later published her own reminiscences of Wiggin, titled &quot;Kate Douglas Wiggin as Her Sister Knew Her&quot;.

Wiggin was also a songwriter and composer. For &quot;Kindergarten Chimes&quot; (1885) and other collections for children, she wrote some of the lyrics, music, and arrangements. For &quot;Nine Love Songs and a Carol&quot;, (1896), she composed all of the music.

==Legacy==

In the 1980s and 1990s, Wiggin&#x27;s first husband&#x27;s distant cousin Eric E. Wiggin published updated versions of some of the books in her Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm series. He later published his own addition to the series, entitled &quot;Rebecca Returns to Sunnybrook&quot;. Eric E. Wiggin extended her series after years of writing Christian literature, newspaper articles, and other children&#x27;s books. His books sold best among his target audience of homeschoolers; with their help, his updated novels and his new addition to the series have sold more than 50,000 copies.

Many of Wiggin&#x27;s novels were made into movies. Perhaps the most famous film adaptation of her books is the 1938 film &quot;Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm&quot;, starring Shirley Temple.

<text>No Secrets was an American girl group formed in 2000. The group consisted of five members: Angel Faith, Carly Lewis, Erin Tanner, Jessica Fried, and Jade Ryusaki. The group debuted in the United States in 2001 with the single &quot;Kids in America&quot;.

==History==
===2000–2002: Formation, debut album and tour===
No Secrets was formed by Carly&#x27;s father, Adrian Gurvitz, a music producer from London. She wrote a letter to him asking to put a group together. Soon after, Jade was invited; Carly and Jade&#x27;s mothers were friends. Erin, Jade&#x27;s cousin, joined next. Later, the three girls found Angel in an advertisement for a singing group; she joined, bringing Jessica with her. Once the group line-up had been completed, No Secrets began recording songs for their debut album. The girls worked with a variety of producers and songwriters, including Adrian Gurvitz, Andy Goldmark, and Riprock &#x27;n&#x27; Alex G. The process took a number of months. They took a break from recording and album prep to go touring and promoting their group. In July 2001, No Secrets joined Aaron Carter in Toronto for the shooting of his video &quot;Oh Aaron&quot; and provided backing vocals for the song. They were also featured in another track of off his album, &quot;Stride (Jump on the Fizzy).&quot; In 2002, after touring with Carter for four months, they filmed their first video, the home VHS and DVD release &quot;No Secrets - Get to Know Us&quot;, and resumed work on their album.

Later that year, the group released their self-titled debut album, with singles &quot;That&#x27;s What Girls Do&quot; and &quot;Kids in America.&quot; The latter was featured in the soundtrack for the 2001 film &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot; and its music video was included as a bonus for the film&#x27;s VHS release. &quot;That&#x27;s What Girls Do&quot; played in the end credits of &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot;, and its music video was a bonus feature on the DVD. The song would later be used in &quot;The Hot Chick&quot;. They also recorded &quot;Little Angel of Mine&quot; for the soundtrack of &quot;Stuart Little 2.&quot;

===2003–2004: Faith&#x27;s departure and &quot;Friends Forever&quot;===
In early 2003, No Secrets was featured on &quot;DisneyMania&quot; singing a cover of &quot;Kiss the Girl&quot; from &quot;The Little Mermaid.&quot;

Soon after singing the majority of leads in the band, Angel left the group to pursue a solo career, releasing the album &quot;Believe in Angels... Believe in Me&quot; in 2004, just as the finishing touches were being put on No Secrets&#x27; second album, &quot;Friends Forever.&quot; The album was released with Angel featured in the artwork because it was too close to the release date and too far in production to make any changes. The four remaining members recorded and shot a video for the song &quot;Once Upon (Another) Dream&quot; for Disney&#x27;s 2003 DVD release of &quot;Sleeping Beauty.&quot; At one point, many rumors floated about a new member joining the girl group, but no official statements were ever made. Until blog posts and other articles were created a few years later stating, Lady Gaga was confirmed to promptly replace Angel in late 2003 but after her manager backed out of the project too early, Gaga (then known as Stefani) didn&#x27;t make it into the group.

===2005: Break-up===
Disagreements between the remaining four members of the group led to the eventual break-up of No Secrets in March 2005.

Jessica Fried took on a solo career, signing with Reprise Records under the name Jessi Malay. Erin Tanner adopted the stage name Nicki Foxx and began working on solo material.

In a 2007 interview, Fried commented on the break-up, stating that the girls got along great but greedy parental actions ended up breaking the group apart.

In 2007, Angel Faith retired from the entertainment industry and began pursuing an education. In June 2009, she graduated magna cum laude from UCLA and went on to complete a doctorate degree in clinical psychology at Pepperdine University. Jade Ryusaki now resides in Hawaii as a model.

<text>Sir Henry Maximilian Beerbohm (24 August 1872 – 20 May 1956) was an English essayist, parodist and caricaturist under the signature Max. He first became known in the 1890s as a dandy and a humorist. He was the drama critic for the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; from 1898 until 1910, when he relocated to Rapallo, Italy. In his later years he was popular for his occasional radio broadcasts. Among his best-known works is his only novel, &quot;Zuleika Dobson&quot;, published in 1911. His caricatures, drawn usually in pen or pencil with muted watercolour tinting, are in many public collections.

==Early life==

Born in 57 Palace Gardens Terrace, London which is now marked with a blue plaque, Henry Maximilian Beerbohm was the youngest of nine children of a Lithuanian-born grain merchant, Julius Ewald Edward Beerbohm (1811–1892). His mother was Eliza Draper Beerbohm (c. 1833–1918), the sister of Julius&#x27;s late first wife. Although the Beerbohms were supposed by some to be of Jewish descent, on looking into the question in his later years Beerbohm told a biographer:
Beerbohm was close to four half-siblings, one of whom, Herbert Beerbohm Tree, was already a renowned stage actor when Max was a child. Other older half-siblings were the author and explorer Julius Beerbohm and the author Constance Beerbohm. His nieces were Viola, Felicity and Iris Tree.

From 1881 to 1885, Max – he was always called simply &quot;Max&quot; and it is thus that he signed his drawings – attended the day school of a Mr Wilkinson in Orme Square. Wilkinson, Beerbohm later said, &quot;gave me my love of Latin and thereby enabled me to write English&quot;. Mrs Wilkinson taught drawing to the students, the only lessons Beerbohm ever had in the subject.

Beerbohm was educated at Charterhouse School and Merton College, Oxford, from 1890, where he was Secretary of the Myrmidon Club. It was at school that he began writing. While at Oxford Beerbohm became acquainted with Oscar Wilde and his circle through his half-brother, Herbert Beerbohm Tree. In 1893, he met William Rothenstein, who introduced him to Aubrey Beardsley and other members of the literary and artistic circle connected with The Bodley Head.

Although he was an unenthusiastic student academically, Beerbohm became a well-known figure in Oxford social circles. He also began submitting articles and caricatures to London publications, which were met enthusiastically. &quot;I was a modest, good-humoured boy&quot;, he recalled. &quot;It was Oxford that has made me insufferable.&quot; In March 1893, he submitted an article on Oscar Wilde to the &quot;Anglo-American Times&quot; under the pen name &quot;An American&quot;. Later in 1893 his essay &quot;The Incomparable Beauty of Modern Dress&quot; was published in the Oxford journal &quot;The Spirit Lamp&quot; by its editor, Lord Alfred Douglas.

By 1894, having developed his personality as a dandy and humourist, and already a rising star in English letters, he left Oxford without a degree. His &quot;A Defence of Cosmetics&quot; (&quot;The Pervasion of Rouge&quot;) appeared in the first edition of &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; in 1894, his friend Aubrey Beardsley being art editor at the time. At this time Wilde said of him, &quot;The gods have bestowed on Max the gift of perpetual old age.&quot;

In 1895, Beerbohm went to the United States for several months as secretary to his half-brother Herbert Beerbohm Tree&#x27;s theatrical company. He was fired when he spent far too many hours polishing the business correspondence. There he became engaged to Grace Conover, an American actress in the company, a relationship that lasted several years.

==Writer and broadcaster==

On his return to England Beerbohm published his first book, &quot;The Works of Max Beerbohm&quot; (1896), a collection of his essays which had first appeared in &quot;The Yellow Book&quot;. His first piece of fiction, &quot;The Happy Hypocrite&quot;, was published in volume XI of &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; in October 1896. Having been interviewed by George Bernard Shaw himself, in 1898 he followed Shaw as drama critic for the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, on whose staff he remained until 1910. At that time the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; was undergoing renewed popularity under its new owner, the writer Frank Harris, who would later become a close friend of Beerbohm&#x27;s.

It was Shaw, in his final &quot;Saturday Review&quot; piece, who bestowed upon Beerbohm the lasting epithet, &quot;the Incomparable Max&quot; when he wrote, &quot;The younger generation is knocking at the door; and as I open it there steps spritely in the incomparable Max&quot;.

In 1904 Beerbohm met the American actress Florence Kahn. In 1910 they married and moved to Rapallo in Italy, partly as an escape from the social demands and the expense of living in London. Here they remained for the rest of their lives except for the duration of World War I and World War II, when they returned to Britain, and occasional trips to England to take part in exhibitions of his drawings.

Beerbohm and his wife Florence spent the period of the First World War (1914 to 1918) in a cottage belonging to William Rothenstein, next to Rothenstein&#x27;s own residence Iles Farm, in Far Oakridge, Gloucestershire. The Arts and Crafts architect Norman Jewson remarked on his dapper appearance there: &quot;At first it amazed me to see him, in the depths of the country, in war time, always perfectly groomed and immaculately dressed as if for a garden party at Buckingham Palace, but as I got to know him better I realised that he just could not do anything else.&quot;

In his years in Rapallo Beerbohm was visited by many of the eminent men and women of his day, including Ezra Pound, who lived nearby, Somerset Maugham, John Gielgud, Laurence Olivier and Truman Capote among others. Beerbohm never learned to speak Italian in the five decades that he lived in Italy.

From 1935 onwards, he was an occasional though popular radio broadcaster, talking on cars and carriages and music halls for the BBC. His radio talks were published in 1946 as &quot;Mainly on the Air&quot;. His wit is shown often enough in his caricatures but his letters contain a carefully blended humour—a gentle admonishing of the excesses of the day—whilst remaining firmly tongue in cheek. His lifelong friend Reginald Turner, who was also an aesthete and a somewhat witty companion, saved many of Beerbohm&#x27;s letters.

Beerbohm&#x27;s best-known works include &quot;A Christmas Garland&quot; (1912), a parody of literary styles, &quot;Seven Men&quot; (1919), which includes &quot;Enoch Soames&quot;, the tale of a poet who makes a deal with the Devil to find out how posterity will remember him, and &quot;Zuleika Dobson&quot; (1911), a satire of undergraduate life at Oxford. This was his only novel, but was nonetheless very successful.

==Caricaturist==
In the 1890s, while a student at Oxford University, Beerbohm showed great skill at observant figure sketching. His usual style of single-figure caricatures on formalised groupings, drawn in pen or pencil with delicately applied watercolour tinting, was established by 1896 and flourished until about 1930. In contrast to the heavier artistic style of the &quot;Punch&quot; tradition, he showed a lightness of touch and simplicity of line. Beerbohm&#x27;s career as a professional caricaturist began when he was twenty: in 1892 &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; published thirty-six of his drawings of &#x27;Club Types&#x27;. Their publication dealt, Beerbohm said, &quot;a great, an almost mortal blow to my modesty&quot;. The first public exhibition of his caricatures was as part of a group show at the Fine Art Society in 1896; his first one-man show at the Carfax Gallery in 1901. Explaining his system for caricature, Beerbohm wrote: &quot;The whole man must be melted down in a crucible and then, from the solution, fashioned anew. Nothing will be lost but no particle will be as it was before.&quot; He concluded: &quot;The most perfect caricature is that which, on a small surface, with the simplest means, most accurately exaggerates, to the highest point, the peculiarities of a human being, at his most characteristic moment, in the most beautiful manner.&quot;

Beerbohm was influenced by French cartoonists such as &quot;Sem&quot; (Georges Goursat) and &quot;Caran d&#x27;Ache&quot; (Emmanuel Poiré). He was hailed by &quot;The Times&quot; in 1913 as &quot;the greatest of English comic artists&quot;, by Bernard Berenson as &quot;the English Goya&quot;, and by Edmund Wilson as &quot;the greatest ... portrayer of personalities – in the history of art&quot;.

Usually inept with hands and feet, Beerbohm excelled in heads and with dandified male costume of a period whose elegance became a source of nostalgic inspiration. His collections of caricatures included &quot;Caricatures of Twenty-five Gentlemen&quot; (1896), &quot;The Poets&#x27; Corner&quot; (1904), &quot;Fifty Caricatures&quot; (1913) and &quot;Rossetti and His Circle&quot; (1922). His caricatures were published widely in the fashionable magazines of the time, and his works were exhibited regularly in London at the Carfax Gallery (1901–08) and Leicester Galleries (1911–57). At his Rapallo home he drew and wrote infrequently and decorated books in his library. These were sold at auction by Sotheby&#x27;s of London on 12 and 13 December 1960 following the death of his second wife and literary executor Elisabeth Jungmann.

His Rapallo caricatures were mostly of late Victorian and Edwardian political, literary and theatrical personalities. The court of Edward VII had a special place as a subject for affectionate ridicule. Many of Beerbohm&#x27;s later caricatures were of himself.

Major collections of Beerbohm&#x27;s caricatures are in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; the Tate collection; the Victoria and Albert Museum; Charterhouse School; the Clark Library, University of California; and the Lilly Library, Indiana University; depositories of both caricatures and archival material include Merton College, Oxford; the Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin; the Robert H. Taylor collection, Princeton University Library; the Houghton Library, Harvard University; and the privately owned Mark Samuels Lasner collection.

==Personal life==
Beerbohm married the actress Florence Kahn in 1910. There has been speculation that he was a non-active homosexual (Malcolm Muggeridge, who much disliked him, imputed homosexuality to him), that his marriage was never consummated, that he was a &quot;natural celibate&quot; or even just asexual.

David Cecil wrote that, &quot;though he showed no moral disapproval of homosexuality, [Beerbohm] was not disposed to it himself; on the contrary he looked upon it as a great misfortune to be avoided if possible.&quot; Cecil quotes a letter from Beerbohm to Oscar Wilde&#x27;s friend Robert Ross in which he asks Ross to keep Reggie Turner from the clutches of Lord Alfred Douglas, &quot;I really think Reg is at a rather crucial point of his career – and should hate to see him fall an entire victim to the love that dare not tell its name.&quot; The fact is that not much is known of Beerbohm&#x27;s private life.

Evelyn Waugh also speculated that Beerbohm had made a &quot;mariage blanc&quot; but added: &quot;Beerbohm remarked of Ruskin that it was surprising he should marry, without knowing he was impotent.&quot; Waugh also observed, &quot;the question is of little importance in an artist of Beerbohm&#x27;s quality.&quot;

There was also some speculation during his lifetime that Beerbohm was Jewish. Muggeridge assumed that Beerbohm&#x27;s Jewishness was certain. Beerbohm responded by saying that, disappointingly for him, he was not. However, both of his wives were Jews of German origin, although Florence was born and reared in Memphis, Tennessee, in an immigrant family. She is described as an American.

When asked by George Bernard Shaw if he had any Jewish ancestors, Beerbohm replied: &quot;That my talent is rather like Jewish talent I admit readily... But, being in fact a Gentile, I am, in a small way, rather remarkable, and wish to remain so.&quot; In his poem &quot;Hugh Selwyn Mauberley&quot; Ezra Pound, a neighbour in Rapallo – and later a supporter of fascism and anti-Semitism – caricatured Beerbohm as &quot;Brennbaum&quot;, a Jewish artist.

==The Maximilian Society==
Beerbohm was knighted by George VI in 1939; it was thought that this mark of esteem had been delayed by his mockery in 1911 of the king&#x27;s parents, about whom he had written a satiric verse, &quot;Ballade Tragique a Double Refrain&quot;. In August 1942, on the occasion of Beerbohm&#x27;s seventieth birthday, the Maximilian Society was created by a London drama critic in his honour. It had seventy distinguished members, including J. B. Priestley, Walter de la Mare, Augustus John, William Rothenstein, Edward Lutyens, Osbert Lancaster, Siegfried Sassoon, Osbert Sitwell, Leonard Woolf, John Betjeman, Kenneth Clark, E. M. Forster, Graham Greene, and Laurence Housman, and planned to add one more member on each of Beerbohm&#x27;s successive birthdays. In their first meeting a banquet was held in his honour, and he was presented with seventy bottles of wine.

==Death==
He died at the Villa Chiara, a private hospital in Rapallo, Italy, aged 83, shortly after marrying his former secretary and companion, Elisabeth Jungmann. Beerbohm was cremated in Genoa and his ashes were interred in the crypt of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London, on 29 June 1956.

A relation is the American comic book historian Robert Beerbohm (1952–2024).

<text>The cucumber (Cucumis sativus) is a widely-cultivated creeping vine plant in the family Cucurbitaceae that bears cylindrical to spherical fruits, which are used as culinary vegetables. Considered an annual plant, there are three main types of cucumber—slicing, pickling, and seedless—within which several cultivars have been created. The cucumber originates in Asia extending from India, Nepal, Bangladesh, China (Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi), and Northern Thailand, but now grows on most continents, and many different types of cucumber are grown commercially and traded on the global market. In North America, the term &quot;wild cucumber&quot; refers to plants in the genera &quot;Echinocystis&quot; and &quot;Marah&quot;, though the two are not closely related.

== Description ==
The cucumber is a creeping vine that roots in the ground and grows up trellises or other supporting frames, wrapping around supports with thin, spiraling tendrils. The plant may also root in a soilless medium, whereby it will sprawl along the ground in lieu of a supporting structure. The vine has large leaves that form a canopy over the fruits.

The fruit of typical cultivars of cucumber is roughly cylindrical, but elongated with tapered ends, and may be as large as long and in diameter.

Cucumber fruits consist of 95% water (see nutrition table). In botanical terms, the cucumber is classified as a &quot;pepo&quot;, a type of botanical berry with a hard outer rind and no internal divisions. However, much like tomatoes and squashes, it is often perceived, prepared, and eaten as a vegetable.

=== Flowering and pollination ===


Most cucumber cultivars are seeded and require pollination. For this purpose, thousands of honey beehives are annually carried to cucumber fields just before bloom. Cucumbers may also be pollinated via bumblebees and several other bee species. Most cucumbers that require pollination are self-incompatible, thus requiring the pollen of another plant in order to form seeds and fruit. Some self-compatible cultivars exist that are related to the &#x27;Lemon cucumber&#x27; cultivar.

A few cultivars of cucumber are parthenocarpic, the blossoms of which create seedless fruit without pollination, which degrades the eating quality of these cultivar. In the United States, these are usually grown in greenhouses, where bees are excluded. In Europe, they are grown outdoors in some regions, where bees are likewise excluded.

Traditional cultivars produce male blossoms first, then female, in about equivalent numbers. Newer gynoecious hybrid cultivars produce almost all female blossoms. They may have a pollenizer cultivar interplanted, and the number of beehives per unit area is increased, but temperature changes induce male flowers even on these plants, which may be sufficient for pollination to occur.

In 2009, an international team of researchers announced they had sequenced the cucumber genome.

A study of genetic recombination during meiosis in cucumber provided a high resolution landscape of meiotic DNA double strand-breaks and genetic crossovers. The average number of crossovers per chromosome per meiosis was 0.92 to 0.99.

===Herbivore defense===
Phytochemicals in cucumbers may discourage natural foraging by herbivores, such as insects, nematodes or wildlife. As a possible defense mechanism, cucumbers produce cucurbitacin C, which causes a bitter taste in some cucumber varieties. This potential mechanism is under preliminary research to identify whether cucumbers are able to deter herbivores and environmental stresses by using an intrinsic chemical defense, particularly in the leaves, cotyledons, pedicel, carpopodium, and fruit.

== Nutrition, aroma, and taste ==
Raw cucumber (with peel) is 95% water, 4% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contains negligible fat. A reference serving provides of food energy. It has a low content of micronutrients: it is notable only for vitamin K, at 14% of the Daily Value (table).

Depending on variety, cucumbers may have a mild melon aroma and flavor, in part resulting from unsaturated aldehydes, such as , and the &quot;cis&quot;- and &quot;trans&quot;- isomers of 2-nonenal. The slightly bitter taste of cucumber rind results from cucurbitacins.

Research from 2018 found that polyphenol content was higher in unpeeled cucumbers.

== Varieties ==
In general cultivation, cucumbers are classified into three main cultivar groups: slicing, pickling, and seedless/burpless.

== Culinary uses ==
=== Fruit ===
==== Slicing ====
Cucumbers grown to eat fresh are called &quot;slicing cucumbers&quot;. The main varieties of slicers mature on vines with large leaves that provide shading.

Slicers grown commercially for the North American market are generally longer, smoother, more uniform in color, and have much tougher skin. In contrast, those in other countries, often called European cucumbers, are smaller and have thinner, more delicate skin, often with fewer seeds, thus are often sold in plastic skin for protection. This variety may also be called a &quot;telegraph cucumber&quot;, particularly in Australasia.

==== Pickling ====
Pickling with brine, sugar, vinegar, and spices creates various flavored products from cucumbers and other foods. Although any cucumber can be pickled, commercial pickles are made from cucumbers specially bred for uniformity of length-to-diameter ratio and lack of voids in the flesh. Those cucumbers intended for pickling, called &quot;picklers&quot;, grow to about long and wide. Compared to slicers, picklers tend to be shorter, thicker, less-regularly shaped, and have bumpy skin with tiny white or black-dotted spines. Color can vary from creamy yellow to pale or dark green.

==== Gherkin ====
Gherkins, also called &quot;cornichons&quot;, or &quot;baby pickles&quot;, are small cucumbers, typically those in length, often with bumpy skin, which are typically used for pickling. The word &quot;gherkin&quot; comes from the early modern Dutch &quot;gurken&quot; or &quot;augurken&quot; (&#x27;small pickled cucumber&#x27;). The term is also used in the name for &quot;Cucumis anguria&quot;, the &quot;West Indian gherkin&quot;, a closely related species.

==== Burpless ====
Burpless cucumbers are sweeter and have a thinner skin than other varieties of cucumber. They are reputed to be easy to digest and to have a pleasant taste. They can grow as long as , are nearly seedless, and have a delicate skin. Most commonly grown in greenhouses, these parthenocarpic cucumbers are often found in grocery markets, shrink-wrapped in plastic. They are marketed as either burpless or seedless, as the seeds and skin of other varieties of cucumbers are said to give some people gas.

=== Shoots === 
Cucumber shoots are regularly consumed as a vegetable, especially in rural areas. In Thailand they are often served with a crab meat sauce. They can also be stir fried or used in soups.

==Production==
In 2022, world production of cucumbers and gherkins was 95 million tonnes, led by China with 82% of the total.

== Cultivation history ==
Cultivated for at least 3,000 years, the cultivated cucumbers &quot;Cucumis sativus&quot; were domesticated in India from wild &quot;C. sativus var. hardwickii&quot;. where a great many varieties have been observed, along with its closest living relative, &quot;Cucumis hystrix&quot;. Three main cultivar groups of cucumber are namely Eurasian cucumbers (slicing cucumbers eaten raw and immature), East Asian cucumbers (pickling cucumbers) and Xishuangbanna cucumbers. Based on demographic modelling, the East Asian C. sativus cultivars diverged from the Indian cultivars c. 2500 years ago. It was probably introduced to Europe by the Greeks or Romans. Records of cucumber cultivation appear in France in the 9th century, England in the 14th century, and in North America by the mid-16th century.

=== Roman Empire ===
According to Pliny the Elder, the Emperor Tiberius had the cucumber on his table daily during summer and winter. In order to have it available for his table every day of the year, the Romans reportedly used artificial methods of growing (similar to the greenhouse system), whereby &quot;mirrorstone&quot; refers to Pliny&#x27;s &quot;lapis specularis&quot;, believed to have been sheet mica:

Reportedly, they were also cultivated in &quot;specularia&quot;, cucumber houses glazed with oiled cloth. Pliny describes the Italian fruit as very small, probably like a gherkin. He also describes the preparation of a medication known as &quot;elaterium&quot;. However, some scholars believe that he was instead referring to &quot;Ecballium elaterium&quot;, known in pre-Linnean times as &quot;Cucumis silvestris&quot; or &quot;Cucumis asininus&quot; (&#x27;wild cucumber&#x27; or &#x27;donkey cucumber&#x27;), a species different from the common cucumber. Pliny also writes about several other varieties of cucumber, including the cultivated cucumber, and remedies from the different types (9 from the cultivated; 5 from the &quot;anguine;&quot; and 26 from the &quot;wild&quot;).

=== Middle Ages ===
Charlemagne had cucumbers grown in his gardens in the 8th/9th century. They were reportedly introduced into England in the early 14th century, lost, then reintroduced approximately 250 years later. The Spaniards (through the Italian Christopher Columbus) brought cucumbers to Haiti in 1494. In 1535, Jacques Cartier, a French explorer, found &quot;very great cucumbers&quot; grown on the site of what is now Montreal.

=== Early-modern age ===

Throughout the 16th century, European trappers, traders, bison hunters, and explorers bartered for the products of American Indian agriculture. The tribes of the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains learned from the Spanish how to grow European crops. The farmers on the Great Plains included the Mandan and Abenaki. They obtained cucumbers and watermelons from the Spanish, and added them to the crops they were already growing, including several varieties of corn and beans, pumpkins, squash, and gourd plants. The Iroquois were also growing them when the first Europeans visited them.

In 1630, the Reverend Francis Higginson produced a book called &quot;New-Englands Plantation&quot; in which, describing a garden on Conant&#x27;s Island in Boston Harbor known as &quot;The Governor&#x27;s Garden&quot;, he states:The countrie aboundeth naturally with store of roots of great and good to eat. Our turnips, parsnips, and carrots are here both bigger and sweeter than is ordinary to be found in England. Here are store of pompions, cowcumbers, and other things of that nature which I know not...In &quot;New England Prospect&quot; (1633, England), William Wood published observations he made in 1629 in America:

===Age of Enlightenment and later===

In the later 17th century, a prejudice developed against uncooked vegetables and fruits. A number of articles in contemporary health publications stated that uncooked plants brought on summer diseases and should be forbidden to children. The cucumber kept this reputation for an inordinate period of time, &quot;fit only for consumption by cows,&quot; which some believe is why it gained the name, &quot;cowcumber&quot;.

Samuel Pepys wrote in his diary on 22 August 1663:[T]his day Sir W. Batten tells me that Mr. Newburne is dead of eating cowcumbers, of which the other day I heard of another, I think.

John Evelyn in 1699 wrote that the cucumber, &#x27;however dress&#x27;d, was thought fit to be thrown away, being accounted little better than poyson (poison)&#x27;.

According to 18th-century British writer Samuel Johnson, it was commonly said among English physicians that a cucumber &quot;should be well sliced, and dressed with pepper and vinegar, and then thrown out, as good for nothing.&quot;

A copper etching made by Maddalena Bouchard between 1772 and 1793 shows this plant to have smaller, almost bean-shaped fruits, and small yellow flowers. The small form of the cucumber is figured in Herbals of the 16th century, however stating that &quot;[i]f hung in a tube while in blossom, the Cucumber will grow to a most surprising length.&quot;

<text>Computer magazines are about computers and related subjects, such as networking and the Internet. Most computer magazines offer (or offered) advice, some offer programming tutorials, reviews of the latest technologies, and advertisements.

=== 1940s–1950s===
Sources:.
*&quot;Mathematics of Computation&quot; established in 1943, articles about computers began to appear from 1946 (Volume 2, Number 15) to the end of 1954. Scientific journal.
*&quot;Digital Computer Newsletter&quot;, (1949–1968), founded by Albert Eugene Smith.
*&quot;Computers and People&quot;, (1951–1988), was arguably the first computer magazine. It began as &quot;Roster of Organizations in the Field of Automatic Computing Machinery&quot; (1951–1952), and then &quot;The Computing Machinery Field&quot; (1952–1953). It was published by Edmund Berkeley. &quot;Computers and Automation&quot; held the first Computer Art Contest in 1963 and maintained a bibliography on computer art starting in 1966. It also included a monthly estimated census of all installed computer systems starting in 1962. In 1973 name changed to &quot;Computers and Automation and People&quot;, and finally in 1975 to &quot;Computers and People.&quot;
*AFIPS conference proceedings (AFIPS Joint Computer Conferences) (1952–1987).
*ACM National Conference proceedings (Proceedings of National Meetings) (1952, 1956–1987, 1997)
*&quot;IEEE Transactions on Computers&quot; from 1952, scientific journal.
*&quot;Computing News&quot; (1953–1963), was an early computer magazine produced by Jackson W. Granholm out of Thousand Oaks, California. The first documented copyright was applied for on September 1, 1954, for issue #36. The magazine was released on the 1st and 15th of each month, which places issue #1 at March 15, 1953. The last documented release was issue #217 on March 15, 1962.
*&quot;Journal of the ACM&quot; from 1954, scientific journal.
*&quot;Datamation&quot; from 1957, was another early computer and data processing magazine. It is still being published as an e-publication on the Internet. Futurist Donald Prell was its founder.
*&quot;Information and Computation&quot; from 1957, scientific journal.
*&quot;IBM Journal of Research and Development&quot; from 1957, scientific journal.
*&quot;Communications of the ACM&quot; from 1958, mix of science magazine, trade magazine, and a scientific journal
*&quot;The Computer Journal&quot; from 1958, scientific journal.

*&quot;ACS Newsletter&quot; (1966–1976), Amateur Computer Society newsletter.
* &quot;Computerworld&quot; (1967)
* &quot;People&#x27;s Computer Company Newsletter&quot; (1972–1981)
* &quot;Amateur Computer Club Newsletter&quot; (ACCN; 1973–)
* &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot; (1976–2014) was the first microcomputer magazine to focus on software, rather than hardware.

===1980s ===

In the 1980s, computer magazines skewed their content towards the hobbyist end of the then-microcomputer market, and used to contain type-in programs, but these have gone out of fashion. The first magazine devoted to this class of computers was &quot;Creative Computing&quot;. &quot;Byte&quot; was an influential technical journal that published until the 1990s.

In 1983, an average of one new computer magazine appeared each week. By late that year more than 200 existed. Their numbers and size grew rapidly with the industry they covered, and &quot;BYTE&quot; and &quot;80 Micro&quot; were among the three thickest magazines of any kind per issue. &quot;Compute!&quot;″s editor in chief reported in the December 1983 issue that &quot;all of our previous records are being broken: largest number of pages, largest-number of four-color advertising pages, largest number of printing pages, and the largest number of editorial pages&quot;.

Computers were the only industry with product-specific magazines, like &quot;80 Micro&quot;, &quot;PC Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Macworld&quot;; their editors vowed to impartially cover their computers whether or not doing so hurt their readers&#x27; and advertisers&#x27; market, while claiming that their rivals pandered to advertisers by only publishing positive news. 

&quot;BYTE,&quot; in March 1984, apologized for publishing articles by authors with promotional material for companies without describing them as such, and in April suggested that other magazines adopt its rules of conduct for writers, such as prohibiting employees from accepting gifts or discounts. 

&quot;InfoWorld&quot; stated in June that many of the &quot;150 or so&quot; industry magazines published articles without clearly identifying authors&#x27; affiliations and conflicts of interest.

Around 1985, many magazines ended. However, as their number exceeded the amount of available advertising revenue despite revenue in the first half of the year five times that of the same period in 1982. Consumers typically bought computer magazines more for advertising than articles, which benefited already leading journals like &quot;BYTE&quot; and &quot;PC Magazine&quot; and hurt weaker ones. Also affecting magazines was the computer industry&#x27;s economic difficulties, including the video game crash of 1983, which badly hurt the home-computer market. 

Dan Gutman, the founder of &quot;Computer Games&quot;, recalled in 1987 that &quot;the computer games industry crashed and burned like a bad night of &quot;Flight Simulator&quot;—with my magazine on the runway&quot;. &quot;Antic&quot;&#x27;s advertising sales declined by 50% in 90 days, &quot;Compute!&quot;&#x27;s number of pages declined from 392 in December 1983 to 160 ten months later, and &quot;Compute!&quot; and &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot;&#x27;s publisher assured readers in an editorial that his company &quot;is and continues to be quite successful ... even during these particularly difficult times in the industry&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated in 1988 that it was the only one of the 18 color magazines that covered computer games in 1983 to survive the crash. &quot;Compute!&quot; similarly stated that year that it was the only general-interest survivor of about 150 consumer-computing magazines published in 1983.

Some computer magazines in the 1980s and 1990s were issued only on disk (or cassette tape, or CD-ROM) with no printed counterpart; such publications are collectively (though somewhat inaccurately) known as &quot;disk magazines&quot; and are listed separately.

=== 1990s ===
In some ways, the heyday of printed computer magazines was a period during the 1990s. During this period, a large number of computer manufacturers took out advertisements in computer magazines, so they became quite thick and could afford to carry quite a number of articles in each issue. &quot;Computer Shopper&quot; was a good example of this trend. 

Some printed computer magazines used to include covermount floppy disks, CDs, or other media as inserts; they typically contained software, demos, and electronic versions of the print issue.

=== 2000s–2010s ===
However, with the rise in popularity of the Internet, many computer magazines went bankrupt or transitioned to an online-only existence. Exceptions include &quot;Wired&quot;, which is more of a technology magazine than a computer magazine.
