<text>Sir Dirk Bogarde (born Derek Jules Gaspard Ulric Niven van den Bogaerde; 28 March 1921 – 8 May 1999) was an English actor, novelist and screenwriter. Initially a matinée idol in films such as &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; (1954) for the Rank Organisation, he later acted in art house films, evolving from &quot;heartthrob to icon of edginess&quot;.

In a second career, Bogarde wrote seven best-selling volumes of memoirs, six novels, and a volume of collected journalism, mainly from articles in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. He saw active military duty during World War II, and over the course of five years reached the rank of major and was awarded seven medals. His poetry has been published in war anthologies, and a grey ink brush drawing, &quot;Tents in Orchard. 1944&quot;, is in the collection of the British Museum.

Having come to prominence in films including &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot; in the early 1950s, Bogarde starred in the successful &quot;Doctor&quot; film series (1954–1963). He twice won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, for &quot;The Servant&quot; (1963) and &quot;Darling&quot; (1965). His other notable film roles included &quot;Victim&quot; (1961), &quot;Accident&quot; (1967), &quot;The Damned&quot; (1969), &quot;Death in Venice&quot; (1971), &quot;The Night Porter&quot; (1974), &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977) and &quot;Despair&quot; (1978). He was appointed a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters in 1990 and a Knight Bachelor in 1992.

==Early years and education==
Bogarde was the eldest of three children born to Ulric van den Bogaerde (1892–1972) and Margaret Niven (1898–1980). Ulric was born in Perry Barr, Birmingham, of Flemish ancestry, and was art editor of &quot;The Times&quot;. Margaret Niven, a former actress, was Scottish, from Glasgow. Dirk Bogarde was born in a nursing home at 12 Hemstal Road, West Hampstead, London, and was baptised on 30 October 1921, at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Kilburn. He had a younger sister, Elizabeth (born 1924), and a brother, Gareth Ulric Van Den Bogaerde, an advertising film producer, born in July 1933 in Hendon.

Conditions in the family home in north London became cramped, so Bogarde was moved to Glasgow to stay with relatives of his mother. He stayed there for more than three years, returning at the end of 1937. He attended University College School and the former Allan Glen&#x27;s High School of Science in Glasgow, a time he described in his autobiography as an unhappy one. Having secured a scholarship at Chelsea College of Art, Bogarde completed his two year course, and landed &quot;a back-stage job as tea-boy at seven shillings and sixpence per week&quot;. A chance to act as a stand-in convinced Bogarde that &quot;he needed some additional basic training, and he joined a provincial repertory group&quot;. His first on-screen appearance was as an uncredited extra in the George Formby comedy, &quot;Come On George!&quot; (1939).

==War service==
During the war, Derek &quot;Pip&quot; Bogaerde served in the British Army, initially with the Royal Corps of Signals. He was then commissioned at the age of 22 into the Queen&#x27;s Royal Regiment (West Surrey) on 2 April 1943 with the rank of second lieutenant. He served in both the European and Pacific theatres, principally as an intelligence officer.

===D-Day and aftermath===
Bogarde served as an intelligence officer with Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery&#x27;s 21st Army Group as it liberated Europe. Taylor Downing&#x27;s book, &quot;Spies in the Sky&quot;, tells of Bogarde&#x27;s work in photo-reconnaissance in the aftermath of D-Day, moving through Normandy with Royal Canadian Air Force units. By July 1944, they were located at the &quot;B.8&quot; airfield at Sommervieu, near Bayeux. As an air photographic interpreter with the rank of captain, Bogarde was later attached to the Second Army, where he selected ground targets in France, Holland and Germany for the Second Tactical Air Force and RAF Bomber Command. Villages on key routes were heavily bombed to prevent the Wehrmacht&#x27;s armour from reaching the invasion lodgement areas. In a 1986 Yorkshire Television interview with Russell Harty, Bogarde recalled going on painting trips, sometimes to see the villages which he had selected as targets:
===Bergen-Belsen concentration camp===
Bogarde said he was one of the first Allied officers to reach the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany on 20 April 1945, an experience that had the most profound effect on him and about which he had difficulty speaking for many years afterward.

There was some doubt as to whether he really visited Belsen, although, more than a decade after publishing his biography, and following additional research, John Coldstream concluded that &quot;it is now possible to state with some authority that he did at least set foot inside the camp&quot;.

===Long-term effects===
The horror and revulsion at the cruelty and inhumanity that he said he witnessed left him with a deep-seated hostility towards Germany; in the late 1980s, he wrote that he would disembark from a lift rather than ride with a German of his generation. Nevertheless, three of his more memorable film roles were as Germans, one of them as a former SS officer in &quot;The Night Porter&quot; (1974).

Bogarde was most vocal towards the end of his life on voluntary euthanasia, of which he became a staunch proponent after witnessing the protracted death of his lifelong partner and manager Anthony Forwood (the former husband of actress Glynis Johns) in 1988. He gave an interview to John Hofsess, London executive director of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society:
==Career==
Bogarde&#x27;s London West End theatre-acting debut was in 1939, with the stage name &quot;Derek Bogaerde&quot;, in J. B. Priestley&#x27;s play &quot;Cornelius&quot;. In 1947 he appeared at the Fortune Theatre in Michael Clayton Hutton&#x27;s &quot;Power Without Glory&quot;. After the war, he started pursuing film roles using the name &quot;Dirk Bogarde&quot;. One of Bogarde&#x27;s earliest starring roles in cinema was in the 1949 film &quot;Once a Jolly Swagman&quot;, where he played a daring speedway ace, riding for the Cobras. This was filmed at New Cross Speedway, in South East London, during one of the postwar years in which speedway was the biggest spectator sport in the UK.

===Film stardom===
Bogarde was contracted to the Rank Organisation under the wing of the prolific independent film producer Betty Box, who produced most of his early films and was instrumental in creating his matinée idol image. His Rank contract began following his appearance in &quot;Esther Waters&quot; (1948), his first credited role, replacing Stewart Granger. Another early role of his was in &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot; (1950), playing a hoodlum who shoots and kills a police constable (Jack Warner), whilst in &quot;So Long at the Fair&quot; (1950), a film noir, he played a handsome artist who comes to the rescue of Jean Simmons during the World&#x27;s Fair in Paris. He also had roles as an accidental murderer in &quot;Hunted&quot; (or &quot;The Stranger in Between&quot;, 1952), a young wing commander in Bomber Command in &quot;Appointment in London&quot; (1953), and in &quot;Desperate Moment&quot; (1953), a wrongly imprisoned man who regains hope of clearing his name when he learns his sweetheart, Mai Zetterling, is still alive.

Bogarde featured as a medical student in &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; (1954), a film that made him one of the most popular British stars of the 1950s. The film co-starred Kenneth More and Donald Sinden, with James Robertson Justice as their crabby mentor. The production was initiated by Betty Box, who had picked up a copy of the book at Crewe during a long rail journey and had seen its possibility as a film. Box and Ralph Thomas had difficulties convincing Rank executives that people would go to a film about doctors and that Bogarde, who up to then had played character roles, had sex appeal and could play light comedy. They were allocated a modest budget and were allowed to use only available Rank contract artists. The film was the first of the &quot;Doctor&quot; film series based on the books by Richard Gordon.

In &quot;The Sleeping Tiger&quot; (1954), Bogarde played a neurotic criminal with co-star Alexis Smith. It was Bogarde&#x27;s first film for American expatriate director Joseph Losey. He did his second &quot;Doctor&quot; film, &quot;Doctor at Sea&quot; (1955), co-starring Brigitte Bardot in one of her first film roles; played a returning colonial who fights the Mau-Mau with Virginia McKenna and Donald Sinden in &quot;Simba&quot; (1955); &quot;Cast a Dark Shadow&quot; (1955), as a man who marries women for money and then murders them; &quot;The Spanish Gardener&quot; (1956), with Michael Hordern, Jon Whiteley and Cyril Cusack; &quot;Doctor at Large&quot; (1957), again with Donald Sinden, another entry in the &quot;Doctor&quot; film series, with later Bond girl Shirley Eaton; the Powell and Pressburger production &quot;Ill Met by Moonlight&quot; (1957) co-starring Marius Goring as German General Kreipe, kidnapped on Crete by Patrick &quot;Paddy&quot; Leigh Fermor (Bogarde) and W. Stanley Moss (David Oxley), and a fellow band of Cretan resistance fighters based on W. Stanley Moss&#x27; real-life account (&quot;Ill Met by Moonlight&quot;) of the Second World War abduction; &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1958), a faithful retelling of Charles Dickens&#x27; classic; as a flight lieutenant in the Far East, who falls in love with a beautiful Japanese teacher Yoko Tani in &quot;The Wind Cannot Read&quot; (1958);&quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; (1959), based on a play by George Bernard Shaw and co-starring Leslie Caron and Robert Morley; and &quot;Libel&quot; (1959), playing three separate roles and co-starring Olivia de Havilland.

===Art house and European cinema===
After leaving the Rank Organisation in the early 1960s, Bogarde abandoned his heart-throb image and &quot;chose roles that challenged received morality and that pushed the scope of cinema&quot;. He starred in the film &quot;Victim&quot; (1961), playing a London barrister who fights the blackmailers of a young man with whom he has had a deeply emotional relationship. The young man commits suicide after being arrested for embezzlement, rather than ruin his beloved&#x27;s career. In exposing the ring of extortionists, Bogarde&#x27;s character risks his reputation and marriage to see that justice is done. &quot;Victim&quot; was the first British film to portray the humiliation to which gay people were exposed via discriminatory law and as a victimised minority; it is said to have had some effect upon the later Sexual Offences Act 1967 ending, to some extent, the illegal status of male homosexual activity.

He again teamed up with Joseph Losey to play Hugo Barrett, a decadent valet, in &quot;The Servant&quot; (1963), with a script by Harold Pinter, and which garnered Bogarde a BAFTA Award. That year also saw the release of &quot;The Mind Benders&quot;, in which he played a professor conducting sensory deprivation experiments at Oxford University (and which anticipates &quot;Altered States&quot; (1980)). The following year saw another collaboration with Losey in the antiwar film &quot;King and Country&quot;, in which Bogarde played an army officer at a court-martial, reluctantly defending deserter Tom Courtenay. He won a second BAFTA for his role as a television broadcaster-writer Robert Gold in &quot;Darling&quot; (1965), directed by John Schlesinger. Bogarde, Losey and Pinter reunited for &quot;Accident&quot; (1967), which recounted the travails of Stephen, a bored Oxford University professor.

&quot;Our Mother&#x27;s House&quot; (1967) is an off-beat film noir and the British entry at the Venice Film Festival, directed by Jack Clayton, in which Bogarde plays a ne&#x27;er-do-well father who descends upon &quot;his&quot; seven children on the death of their mother. In his first collaboration with Luchino Visconti in &quot;La Caduta degli dei&quot; (&quot;The Damned&quot;, 1969), Bogarde played German industrialist Frederick Bruckmann alongside Ingrid Thulin. Two years later Visconti was back at the helm when Bogarde portrayed Gustav von Aschenbach in &quot;Morte a Venezia&quot; (&quot;Death in Venice&quot;). In 1974, the controversial &quot;Il Portiere di notte&quot; (&quot;The Night Porter&quot;) saw Bogarde cast as an ex-Nazi, Max Aldorfer, co-starring Charlotte Rampling, and directed by Liliana Cavani. He played Claude, the lawyer son of a dying, drunken writer (John Gielgud) in the well-received, multidimensional French film &quot;Providence&quot; (1977), directed by Alain Resnais, and industrialist Hermann Hermann, who descends into madness in &quot;Despair&quot; (1978) directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. &quot;It was the best performance I&#x27;ve ever done in my life,&quot; he later recounted. &quot;Fassbinder... really screwed the film up. He tore it to pieces with a scissors.&quot; This led to Bogarde going on an extended hiatus. &quot;And I thought, &#x27;OK. Give it up&#x27;. So I gave it up and I didn&#x27;t do another film for fourteen years.&quot; He returned one last time, as Daddy in Bertrand Tavernier&#x27;s &quot;Daddy Nostalgie&quot;, (or &quot;These Foolish Things&quot;) (1991), co-starring Jane Birkin as his daughter.

===Other later career roles===
In the 1960s and 1970s Bogarde played opposite many renowned stars. &quot;The Angel Wore Red&quot; (1960) saw Bogarde playing an unfrocked priest who falls in love with cabaret entertainer Ava Gardner during the Spanish Civil War. The same year, in &quot;Song Without End&quot; he portrayed Hungarian composer and virtuoso pianist Franz Liszt, a film initially directed by Charles Vidor (who died during shooting) and completed by Bogarde&#x27;s friend George Cukor, which was the actor&#x27;s only foray into Hollywood. The campy &quot;The Singer Not the Song&quot; (1961) starred Bogarde as a Mexican bandit alongside John Mills as a priest.

In &quot;H.M.S. Defiant&quot; (or &quot;Damn the Defiant!&quot;) (1962), he played the sadistic Lieutenant Scott-Padget, co-starring Sir Alec Guinness; &quot;I Could Go On Singing&quot; (1963), co-starring Judy Garland in her final screen role; &quot;Hot Enough for June&quot; (or &quot;Agent 8¾&quot;) (1964), a James Bond-type spy spoof co-starring Robert Morley; &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; (1966), a campy spy send-up playing archvillain Gabriel opposite Monica Vitti and Terence Stamp and directed by Joseph Losey; &quot;The Fixer&quot; (1968), based on Bernard Malamud&#x27;s novel, co-starring Alan Bates; &quot;Sebastian&quot; (1968), as Sebastian, a mathematician working on code decryption, who falls in love with Susannah York, a decrypter in the all-female decoding office he heads for British Intelligence, also co-starring Sir John Gielgud and Lilli Palmer, co-produced by Michael Powell; &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; (1969), co-starring Sir John Gielgud and Sir Laurence Olivier and directed by Richard Attenborough; &quot;Justine&quot; (1969), directed by George Cukor; &quot;Le Serpent&quot; (1973), co-starring Henry Fonda and Yul Brynner;

&quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977), also starring Sean Connery, and again directed by Richard Attenborough, saw Bogarde give a controversial performance as Lieutenant General Frederick &#x27;Boy&#x27; Browning. Bogarde claimed he had known General Browning from his time on Field Marshal Montgomery&#x27;s staff during the war, and took issue with the largely negative portrayal of the general whom he played in &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;. Browning&#x27;s widow, author Dame Daphne du Maurier, ferociously attacked his characterisation and &quot;the resultant establishment fallout, much of it homophobic, wrongly convinced [Bogarde] that the newly ennobled Sir Richard [Attenborough] had deliberately contrived to scupper his own chance of a knighthood.&quot; While several of his fellow actors were veterans, Bogarde was the only cast member to have served at the battles being depicted in the film, having entered Brussels the day after its liberation, and worked on the planning of Operation Market Garden.

===Biographer and novelist===
In 1977, Bogarde embarked on his second career as an author. Starting with a first volume &quot;A Postillion Struck by Lightning&quot; (an allusion to the phrase &quot;My postillion has been struck by lightning&quot;), he wrote a series of 15 best-selling books—nine volumes of memoirs and six novels, as well as essays, reviews, poetry and collected journalism. As a writer, Bogarde displayed a witty, elegant, highly literate and thoughtful style.

===Missed roles===
While under contract with the Rank Organisation, Bogarde was set to play the role of T. E. Lawrence in a proposed film &quot;Lawrence&quot; written by Terence Rattigan and to be directed by Anthony Asquith. On the eve of production, after a year of preparation by Bogarde, Rattigan and Asquith, the film was scrapped without full explanation—ostensibly for budgetary reasons—to the dismay of all three men. The abrupt scrapping of &quot;Lawrence&quot;, a role long researched and keenly anticipated by Bogarde, was among his greatest screen disappointments. (Rattigan reworked the script as a play, &quot;Ross&quot;, which opened to great success in 1960, initially with Alec Guinness playing Lawrence.) Bogarde was also reportedly considered for the title role in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965). Earlier, he had declined Louis Jourdan&#x27;s role as Gaston in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Gigi&quot; (1958).

His contract with Rank had precluded him from accepting the lead in the film adaptation of John Osborne&#x27;s ground-breaking stage play, &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; in 1959. In 1961, Bogarde was offered the chance to play Hamlet at the recently founded Chichester Festival Theatre by artistic director Sir Laurence Olivier but had to decline owing to film commitments. Bogarde later said that he regretted declining Olivier&#x27;s offer and with it the chance to &quot;really learn my craft&quot;.

==Personal life==

After his acting career had given him some success, Bogarde moved from London and rented a cottage on the Bendrose Estate in Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, the family home of his business manager and partner, Anthony &#x27;Tote&#x27; Forwood. Bogarde subsequently lived in the area for some 40 years. After an unsuccessful attempt to gain planning permission to convert the estate into a housing development, Bogarde bought the adjoining Beel House and Park from William Lowndes for £4,000. After tearing down the servants&#x27; wing, Bogarde and Forwood had the main house redeveloped and refurbished &quot;to bring more light&quot; into the original 1700s core. They lived there until 1960, after the development of Dr Challoner&#x27;s High School just 200 yards from Beel House. The couple subsequently moved to Drummer&#x27;s Yard near Beaconsfield. Beel House was later owned by Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne, and Robert Kilroy Silk who sold it for £6.5M in the mid-2010&#x27;s.

Bogarde and Forwood later moved to Provence, France, then Italy, before returning to France. They moved back to London shortly before Forwood&#x27;s death in 1988.

The critical and commercial failure of &quot;Song Without End&quot; affected his Hollywood leading man hopes. He struggled with the trauma of his active service, compounded by rapid fame, recounting, &quot;First there was the war, and then the peace to cope with, and then suddenly I was a film star. It happened all too soon.&quot;

==Death==
Bogarde, a heavy smoker, had a minor stroke in November 1987 while Forwood was dying of liver cancer and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. In September 1996, he underwent angioplasty to unblock arteries leading to his heart and had a massive stroke following the operation. He was paralysed on one side of his body, which affected his speech. After the stroke, he used a wheelchair. He then completed the final volume of his autobiography, which covered the effects of the stroke, and published an edition of his collected journalism, mainly from &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

He spent some time with his friend Lauren Bacall the day before he died at his home in London from a heart attack on 8 May 1999, aged 78. His ashes were scattered at his former estate Le Pigeonnier in Grasse, southern France.

==Honours and awards==
Bogarde was nominated five times as Best Actor by BAFTA, winning twice, for &quot;The Servant&quot; in 1963 and for &quot;Darling&quot; in 1965. He also received the London Film Critics Circle Lifetime Award in 1991. He made a total of 63 films between 1939 and 1991. In 1983, he received a special award for service to the cinema at the Cannes Festival. He was awarded the British Film Institute Fellowship in 1987. In 1988, Bogarde was honoured with the first BAFTA Tribute Award for an outstanding contribution to cinema.

Bogarde was created a Knight Bachelor in the United Kingdom in 1992, awarded the &quot;Commandeur de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres&quot; by the French government in 1990, an honorary doctorate of literature on 4 July 1985 by St Andrews University in Scotland, and an honorary doctorate of letters in 1993 by the University of Sussex in England.

In 1984, Bogarde served as president of the jury at the Cannes Film Festival, the first British person to serve in this capacity.

<doc id="159609" wikidata="Q587266" url="?curid=159609" title="Tourism in Denmark">
<text>Tourism in Denmark is a growing industry and a major economic contributor. Tourists spent a total of DKK 128 billion and the tourism industry employed 161,999 people in full time positions in 2017. 

In 2018, tourists from Denmark&#x27;s neighboring countries, Germany, Norway, and Sweden, comprised the majority of foreign tourists. That year also saw 30 million international arrivals. The number of overnight visitors has been slightly increasing since 2014; in 2018, 16.6 million tourists stayed overnight. 
Denmark has long stretches of sandy beaches, attracting many tourists in the summer, with Germany accounting for most foreign visitors. Swedish and Norwegian tourists often come to visit the relatively lively city of Copenhagen, while many young Scandinavians come for Denmark&#x27;s comparably cheap and readily accessible beer, wines and spirits.

As Europe&#x27;s oldest kingdom and the home of Hans Christian Andersen, Denmark is often marketed as a &quot;fairytale country&quot;. The term is so ingrained, that it is still used in international news reports, especially when the news is of a nature contradicting the image, such as the Copenhagen riots or the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy.

Denmark has a relatively large outbound tourism, with Spain as primary destination, accounting for 14% of all overnight stays abroad of four days or more in 2013. Turkey ranks as the primary destination outside of Europe at 7%.

==Copenhagen and Zealand==

===The capital===

In 2004, Copenhagen Region had 136 hotels with a total of 4.9 million nights spent.

In 2018, Copenhagen recorded 9 million overnight stays. In 2019, Copenhagen Port had 348 cruise calls and 940,000 cruise guests.

Among the major tourist attractions are Tivoli Gardens, the Freetown Christiania and &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; statue, all located in Copenhagen. A survey conducted by the newspaper &quot;Berlingske Tidende&quot; in July 2008 listed &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; as the most popular tourist attraction in Copenhagen.

===Surrounding area===

Kronborg Castle in Helsingør is famous for its associations with Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, 30 km north of Copenhagen, is the most visited museum in Denmark and Roskilde Festival near Roskilde, 30 km west of Copenhagen, attracts over 100,000 guests every year.

===Southern Zealand, Lolland, Falster and Møn===
In view of its proximity to Germany, one of the most popular areas of Denmark for visitors is the South of Zealand and the neighbouring islands. Møn, with its magnificent chalk cliffs, Liselund Park and its sandy beaches is one of the main destinations. Falster has a number of sandy beaches including those at Marielyst. The area also has several tourist attractions including Knuthenborg Safari Park and Middelaldercentret both on Lolland, BonBon-Land near Næstved and the GeoCenter at Møns Klint.

==Bornholm==

The island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea to the south of Sweden has a number of tourist attractions, including rocky seascapes, sandy beaches and fishing villages. Among these towns are Gudhjem, Sandvig, Svaneke and Rønne. The ruin of Europe&#x27;s largest castle, Hammershus, is the island&#x27;s most famous monument. There are ferry services to Bornholm from Køge near Copenhagen, from Ystad in the south of Sweden, from Rügen in the north east of Germany and from Kołobrzeg and Świnoujście in the north west of Poland. There is also an airport at Rønne.

==Funen==

Funen, linked to Zealand by the Great Belt Bridge, has strong associations with Hans Christian Andersen who was born in Odense. The small coastal towns of Fåborg and Svendborg are popular among the tourists, both as attractions in their own right and as centres for visiting the surroundings, particularly the castles of Egeskov and Hvedholm and the unspoiled islands of Thurø, Tåsinge and Ærø with their narrow streets and thatched cottages.

==Jutland==

===Major cities===
The cities of Aalborg, in the north, and Aarhus, in the east, attract a considerable number of visitors, whether for business or pleasure.

Aalborg&#x27;s 14th century Budolfi Church, 17th century Aalborghus Castle and the Jomfru Ane Gade (a lively old street close to the city centre) are major attractions.

Aarhus is amongst the top 100 conference cities of the World and has seen a large expansion in the hotel business, throughout the last couple of decades. The city is home to several of Denmark&#x27;s top tourist attractions, including the museum village of Den Gamle By (the Old Town), ARoS Art Museum, Moesgård Museum and Tivoli Friheden, accounting for more than 1.4 million visitors annually. Other important tourist attractions are music festivals and shopping facilities. With one of the largest ports in Northern Europe, more than a dozen international cruise ships docks in Aarhus each year.

===Regional attractions===

Among Jutland&#x27;s regional attractions are Legoland close to Billund Airport, the easterly village of Ebeltoft with its cobbled streets and half-timbered houses, Skagen in the far north known for its seascapes and artist community and the north-west beach resorts of Løkken and Lønstrup. The island of Mors, also known for its natural environment, attracts tourists to its Jesperhus Flower Park and to the cliff at Hanklit which overlooks the sea.

Jelling, near Vejle in the south-eastern part of Jutland, is a World Heritage Site, famous for its two great tumulus mounds erected in the late 10th century and its runic stones erected by King Harold.

Near Esbjerg on the west coast stands Svend Wiig Hansen&#x27;s enormous sculpture of four chalky white figures gazing out at the sea. Known as &quot;Mennesket ved havet&quot; or Men at the Sea and standing 79 m high, it can be seen at several kilometers distance.

==Cuisine==

The new Danish cuisine - part of the new Nordic cuisine movement - has gathered international attention in the new millennium as an inspiring, high quality gourmet cuisine with several acclaimed restaurants. The most popular restaurants of this particular cuisine are primarily located in the Copenhagen area such as Noma, Geranium, Restaurant AOC, Den Røde Cottage and many others. Important provincial restaurants serving a new Danish cuisine includes Ti Trin Ned in Fredericia and Ruths Gourmet in Skagen.

Apart from the new Danish cuisine, Denmark has an increasing number of high quality gourmet restaurants serving an international cuisine that has also attracted international attention. Many restaurants in the Copenhagen area have been awarded Michelin stars and in 2015, restaurants in Aarhus were the first provincial spots to receive this highly acclaimed rating. Many other restaurants throughout the country figures in other important food guides, including the Nordic White Guide.

The usual everyday fare of traditional Danish food for the citizens, comprises a lunch of smørrebrød on thinly sliced rye bread. On occasion, the sandwiches are richly garnished with onion rings, radish slices, cucumbers, tomato slices, parsley, remoulade or mayonnaise among others. For elaborate lunch meals, it is custom that it starts with seafood, usually fish such as marinated herring, smoked mackerel or eel, shrimp, or breaded plaice filets with remoulade, after which it moves on with meat such as slices of roast pork or beef, frikadeller (meat balls), hams and liver pâté. The meal is often accompanied by beer and on occasions, shots of ice-cold snaps or akvavit are also served. In the evening, hot meals are usually served which include traditional dishes such as battered and fried fish, roast pork with red cabbage, pot-roast chicken, and pork chops. Game is sometimes served in the autumn. Steaks are increasingly popular.

==Transport==
===Air===
Copenhagen Airport is the largest airport in Scandinavia. It is located at Kastrup, 8 km from central Copenhagen. It is connected by train to Copenhagen Central Station and beyond as well as to Malmö and other towns in Sweden.

For the west of the country, the major airport is Billund although Aarhus, Aalborg, and Karup also have smaller airports with regular connections to Copenhagen.
===Rail===
Denmark has a good national railway network. There are also frequent train services to Malmö and other parts of Sweden. Germany is connected both by rail services using the ferries from Puttgarden to Rødby and by services across the Flensburg-Padborg land border in the south of Jutland.

===Road===
Motorways are well developed across the country, the only tolls being on the major bridges (over the Great Belt and to Malmö).

===Bicycles===
Outside of the towns and cities there are often bicycle tracks parallel to, but separated from, the roads between towns. During the summer months, there are free &quot;city bikes&quot; stationed at various spots in the downtown area of Copenhagen and Aarhus. The idea is that anyone can take a bike from one of the spots, ride it to another spot and leave it there for the next person.

There are numerous national and regional bicycle routes throughout Denmark. They are all marked and include rest areas with benches and other necessities.

===Sea===
International overnight ferry services connect Oslo, Norway, to Copenhagen every day. Harwich, south-east England, used to be connected to Esbjerg, west Jutland three times a week. The Esbjerg–Harwich connection was closed in 2014, after nearly 140 years of operation.

There are also a number of ferry services connecting the Danish islands.

<text>As of 2019, Norway ranks 22nd in the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report. Tourism in Norway contributed 4.2% of the gross domestic product as reported in 2018. Every seven in a hundred people throughout the country work in the tourism industry. Tourism is seasonal in Norway, with more than half of total tourists visiting between the months of May and August.

== Attractions ==
The main attractions of Norway are the varied landscapes that extend across the Arctic Circle. It is famous for its fjord-indented coastline and its mountains, ski resorts, lakes and woods. Popular tourist destinations in Norway include Oslo, Ålesund, Bergen, Stavanger, Trondheim, Kristiansand, Arendal, Tromsø, Fredrikstad and Tønsberg. Much of the nature of Norway remains unspoiled, and thus attracts numerous hikers and skiers. Pulpit Rock and Trolltunga are among the most popular selfie locations in the mountains. The fjords, mountains and waterfalls in Western and Northern Norway attract several hundred thousand foreign tourists each year. In the cities, sights such as the Holmenkollen ski jump in Oslo and Saga Oseberg in Tønsberg attract many visitors, as do the Hanseatic Bryggen area in Bergen, the Vigeland Sculpture Park in Oslo, The Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, Fredrikstad Fortress (&quot;Gamlebyen&quot;) in Fredrikstad, the ruin park of Tønsberg Fortress in Tønsberg and numerous others.

The culture of Norway evolved as a result of its sparse population, harsh climate, and relative isolation from the rest of Europe. It is therefore distinct from other countries in Europe in that it has fewer opulent palaces and castles, smaller agricultural areas, and longer travel distances. Regionally distinct architecture, crafts, and art are presented in the various folk museums, typically based on an ethnological perspective. Norsk Folkemuseum at Bygdøy in Oslo is the largest of these.

== Weather ==
Norway is often associated with weather similar to Alaska or Siberia, primarily because the country shares the same latitude as them. In reality, while it is often cold in Norway, the weather is often milder than might be expected, due to the Gulf Stream and warm air currents. Away from the coast, winters are colder, with more snow, and summers are mild with little to no humidity.

== Transport ==
The Norwegian highway system covers more than 90,000 kilometres, of which about 67,000 are paved. The highway system includes ferry transit across waterways, numerous bridges and tunnels, and several mountain passes. Some of these mountain passes are closed during the winter months, and some may close during winter storms. With the opening of the Oresund Bridge and the Great Belt Fixed Link, Norway is connected to the European continent by a continuous highway connection through Sweden and Denmark.

The 4,058 kilometres long rail network connects most of the major cities south of Bodø. The Norwegian rail network is also connected to the Swedish network. Oslo Airport, Gardermoen is the most important airport in Norway, with 24 million passengers in 2014. Most cities and towns have nearby airports, and some of the largest also have international flights. The cruise ferry Hurtigruten connects the cities on the coast between Bergen and Kirkenes. In the summer, the coastal cities are visited by numerous foreign cruise ships, Bergen being the main cruise port.

== Arrivals by country ==
In 2015, 8,828,771 foreign tourists visited Norway, an 8.3% increase over the previous year&#x27;s figure of 8,154,436.

The top ten countries of origin of tourists visiting Norway were:
== Most visited tourist attractions ==
Innovation Norway, a state-owned promotion company which is also in charge of tourism affairs, publishes annual reports on the country&#x27;s most visited tourist attractions, both cultural and natural. The 2007 report lists 50 cultural and 20 natural attractions.

== Tourism exhibitions ==
In January 2009, the National Building Museum presented the exhibition &quot;Detour: Architecture and Design along 18 National Tourist Routes in Norway&quot;. The exhibition, which was created in collaboration with the Norwegian Embassy, was available for view until May 2009.

<doc id="159612" wikidata="Q131344" url="?curid=159612" title="MPlayer">
<text>MPlayer is a free and open-source media player software application. It is available for Linux, OS X and Microsoft Windows. Versions for OS/2, Syllable, AmigaOS, MorphOS and AROS Research Operating System are also available. A port for DOS using DJGPP is also available. Versions for the Wii Homebrew Channel and Amazon Kindle have also been developed.

==History==
Development of MPlayer began in 2000. The original author, Hungarian Árpád Gereöffy, started the project because he was unable to find any satisfactory video players for Linux after XAnim stopped development in 1999. The first version was titled &quot;mpg12play v0.1&quot; and was hacked together in half an hour using &quot;libmpeg3&quot; from Cinelerra-HV. After &quot;mpg12play v0.95pre5&quot;, the code was merged with an AVI player based on &quot;avifile&quot;″s &quot;Win32 DLL loader&quot; to form MPlayer v0.3 in November 2000. 
Gereöffy was soon joined by many other programmers, in the beginning mostly from Hungary, but later worldwide.

Alex Beregszászi has maintained MPlayer since 2003 when Gereöffy left MPlayer development to begin work on a second generation MPlayer. The MPlayer G2 project was abandoned, and all the development effort was put on MPlayer 1.0.

MPlayer was previously called &quot;MPlayer - The Movie Player for Linux&quot; by its developers but this was later shortened to &quot;MPlayer - The Movie Player&quot; after it became commonly used on other operating systems.

== Video acceleration ==
There are various SIP blocks that can accelerate video decoding computation in several formats, including PureVideo, UVD, QuickSync Video, TI Ducati and others. Two studies in 2007 and 2010 implemented hardware decoding for MPlayer, including for specific mobile device architectures.

==Capabilities and classification==
MPlayer can play a wide variety of media formats, namely any format supported by FFmpeg libraries, and can also save all streamed content to a file locally.

A companion program, called MEncoder, can take an input stream, file or a sequence of picture files, and transcode it into several different output formats, optionally applying various transforms along the way.

A variety of command-line parameters allows changing the appearance of the player, including codice_1, codice_2 for changing audio speed while maintaining the pitch, codice_3 (start at ___ seconds), codice_4 (start at ___ bytes), codice_5 (stop playing at ___ seconds), codice_6 for only playing the audio track of a video, and codice_7 for looping.

==Media formats==

MPlayer can play many formats, including:
* Physical media: CDs, DVDs, Video CDs, Blu-ray discs
* Container formats: 3GP, AVI, ASF, FLV, Matroska, MOV (QuickTime), MP4, NUT, Ogg, OGM, RealMedia, Bink
* : Cinepak, DV, H.263, H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, HuffYUV, Indeo, MJPEG, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 Part 2, RealVideo, Sorenson, Theora, WMV, Bink
* Audio formats: AAC, AC3, ALAC, AMR, DTS, FLAC, Intel Music Coder, Monkey&#x27;s Audio, MP3, Musepack, RealAudio, Shorten, Speex, Vorbis, WMA, Bink
* Subtitle formats: AQTitle, ASS/SSA, CC, JACOsub, MicroDVD, MPsub, OGM, PJS, RT, Sami, SRT, SubViewer, VOBsub, VPlayer
* Image formats: BMP, JPEG, MNG, PCX, PTX, TGA, TIFF, SGI, Sun Raster
* Protocols: RTP, RTSP, HTTP, FTP, MMS, Netstream (), SMB, (Uses FFmpeg&#x27;s protocol implementations)

MPlayer can also use a variety of output driver protocols to display video, including VDPAU, the X video extension, OpenGL, DirectX, Direct3D, Quartz Compositor, VESA, Framebuffer, SDL and rarer ones such as ASCII art (using AAlib and libcaca) and Blinkenlights. It can also be used to display TV from a TV card using the device , or play and capture radio channels via .

Since version 1.0RC1, Mplayer can decode subtitles in ASS/SSA subtitle format, using libass.

===Available plugins===
* XMMS plugins
* Avisynth

== Interface and graphical front-ends==
Like GStreamer, MPlayer has only command line interface and there are a couple of front-ends available, which use GUI widgets of GTK, Qt or some other widget library. When not using these front-ends, mplayer can still display video in a window (with no visible controls on it), and is controlled using a keyboard.

* GTK-based are gmplayer (official) and Gnome-MPlayer
* Qt-based are SMPlayer and KMPlayer, among others.
* Cocoa-based are MPlayer OS X Extended and MPlayerX

==Forks==
mplayer2 was a GPLv3-licensed fork of MPlayer, largely the work of Uoti Urpala, who was excluded from the MPlayer project in May 2010 due to &quot;long standing differences&quot; with the MPlayer Team. The main changes from MPlayer were improved pause handling, Matroska support, seeking, and support for Nvidia VDPAU; enabling multithreading by default; and the removal of MEncoder, the GUI interface, and various video drivers and bundled libraries, such as ffmpeg, relying instead on shared libraries. The developers also indicated intentions to enable MPlayer2 to use Libav as an alternative to ffmpeg. The first release, 2.0, was published in March 2011. There have been no subsequent stable releases.

mpv is a GPLv2-licensed fork of mplayer2. Since June 2015, mpv has worked to relicense its code as LGPL v2.1 or above.

MPlayer, MPlayer2 and mpv all use incompatible EDL formats.

==Legal controversy==
In January 2004, the MPlayer website was updated with an allegation that the Danish DVD player manufacturer, Kiss Technology, were marketing DVD players with firmware that included parts of MPlayer&#x27;s GPL-licensed code. The implication was that Kiss was violating the GPL, since Kiss did not release its firmware under the GPL license. The response from the managing director of Kiss, Peter Wilmar Christensen, countered that the similarities between the two pieces of code indicate that the MPlayer team had in fact used code from Kiss&#x27;s firmware. However, the Kiss DVD player, released in 2003, used a subtitle file format that is specific to MPlayer, which was designed by an MPlayer developer in 2001.

<doc id="159614" wikidata="Q918442" url="?curid=159614" title="1970 United Kingdom general election">
<text>The 1970 United Kingdom general election was held on Thursday 18 June 1970. It resulted in a surprise victory for the Conservative Party under leader Edward Heath, which defeated the governing Labour Party under Prime Minister Harold Wilson. The Liberal Party, under its new leader Jeremy Thorpe, lost half its seats. The Conservatives, including the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), secured a majority of 30 seats. This general election was the first in which people could vote from the age of 18, after passage of the Representation of the People Act the previous year, and the first UK election in which party affiliations of candidates were put on the ballots.

Most opinion polls prior to the election indicated a comfortable Labour victory, and put Labour up to 12.4% ahead of the Conservatives. On election day, however, a late swing gave the Conservatives a 3.4% lead and ended almost six years of Labour government, although Wilson remained leader of the Labour Party in opposition. Writing in the aftermath of the election, the political scientist Richard Rose described the Conservative victory as &quot;surprising&quot; and noted a significant shift in votes between the two main parties. &quot;The Times&quot; journalist George Clark wrote that the election would be &quot;remembered as the occasion when the people of the United Kingdom hurled the findings of the opinion polls back into the faces of the pollsters&quot;.

The result would provide the mandate for Heath as Prime Minister to begin formal negotiations for the United Kingdom to become a member state of the European Communities (EC)—or the &quot;Common Market&quot; as it was more widely known at the time, before it later became the European Union; the UK officially joined the EC on 1 January 1973, along with the Republic of Ireland and Denmark.

Frontbench Labour politicians George Brown and Jennie Lee were voted out at this election.

This marked the end of a series of elections where both main parties won over 40% of the vote. This would not occur again for the Conservatives for nine years; Labour would wait 27. 

The result was cast as a two-party politics outcome, with no third party reaching 10% of the (total) vote. Such an outcome would not happen again until the 2017 election.

The election was the last in which a nationwide UK party gained seats in Northern Ireland. The UUP sat with the Conservative Party at Westminster, traditionally taking the Conservative parliamentary whip. To all intents and purposes the UUP functioned as the Northern Ireland branch of the Conservative Party. However, hardline unionist Ian Paisley unseated the UUP incumbent in North Antrim, a clear sign that the UUP&#x27;s complete dominance over unionist politics in Northern Ireland was already starting to weaken. In 1972, in protest over the permanent prorogation of the Parliament of Northern Ireland, Westminster UUP MPs withdrew from the alliance.
==Election date==
The date of 18 June was supposedly chosen because Harold Wilson wanted as Prime Minister to go to the polls before the introduction of decimal coinage in early 1971, for which his government had been responsible and which he thought was hugely unpopular, and because Wilson sought to gain some momentum by surprising the Conservatives, who were expecting an October election.

==Overview==
Commentators believed that an unexpectedly bad set of balance of payments figures (a £31-million trade deficit) published three days before the election and a loss of national prestige after the England football team&#x27;s defeat by West Germany on 14 June in the World Cup contributed to the Labour defeat.
Other factors that were cited as reasons for the Conservative victory included union indiscipline, rising prices, the risk of devaluation, the imposition of Selective Employment Tax (SET), and a set of jobless figures released on final week of the campaign showing unemployment at its highest level since 1940. Interviewed by Robin Day, the outgoing Prime Minister Harold Wilson highlighted the possibility that &quot;complacency engendered by the opinion polls&quot; may have resulted in a poor turnout of Labour supporters.

As defending world champions, England&#x27;s venture in the World Cup attracted a much keener public interest than the general election did. However an analysis by pollster Matt Singh for the 50th anniversary of the election concluded that the late swing had been caused by the weak economic data and that there was &quot;no evidence&quot; that the World Cup had influenced the outcome.

American pollster Douglas Schoen and Oxford University academic R. W. Johnson asserted that Enoch Powell had attracted 2.5 million votes to the Conservatives, although the Conservative vote only increased by 1.7 million. Johnson later stated &quot;It became clear that Powell had won the 1970 election for the Tories ... of all those who had switched their vote from one party to another, 50 per cent were working class Powellites&quot;. The Professor of Political Science Randall Hansen assessed a range of studies, including some which contended that Powell had made little or no difference to the result, but concluded that &quot;At the very least, Powell&#x27;s effect was likely to have fired up the Conservative vote in constituencies which would have voted Tory in any event&quot;. Election night commentators Michael Barratt and Jeffrey Preece dismissed any special &quot;Powell factor&quot;, as did Conservative MPs Reginald Maudling, Timothy Raison and Hugh Dykes.

The 1970–74 Parliament has to date been the only time since the 1924–29 Parliament in which the Conservative Party were only in government for one term before returning to opposition.

The most notable casualty of the election was George Brown, deputy leader of the Labour Party, who lost to the Conservative candidate in the Belper constituency. Brown had held the seat since 1945. Labour Minister for the Arts, Jennie Lee lost her Cannock seat, held by Labour since 1935 on a swing of 10.7% to the Conservatives in what Richard Rose called &quot;the biggest upset&quot; of the election.

Unusually for the Liberal Party, the by-elections between 1966 and 1970 had proved almost fruitless, with many Liberal candidates losing deposits. The one exception was its by-election gain of Birmingham Ladywood in June 1969; this was promptly lost in the 1970 general election. The party found itself struggling to introduce its new leader Jeremy Thorpe to the public, owing to the extensive coverage and attention paid to Enoch Powell. The election result was poor for the Liberals, with Thorpe only narrowly winning his own seat in North Devon. Indeed, of the six MPs returned, three (Thorpe, David Steel and John Pardoe) were elected by a majority of less than 1,000 votes.

The BBC&#x27;s election coverage was led by Cliff Michelmore, along with Robin Day, David Butler and Robert McKenzie. There were periodic cutaways to the BBC regions. This coverage has been rerun on BBC Parliament on several occasions, including on 18 July 2005 as a tribute to Edward Heath after his death the previous day. Its most recent screening was on the 20th of June 2020, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of its first transmission. The BBC coverage was parodied by &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; in its famous &quot;Election Night Special&quot; sketch.

Both BBC and ITN carried their 1970 election night broadcasts in colour, although segments broadcast from some remote locations and some BBC and ITN regional bureaus were transmitted in black-and-white. Some ITV regions were not yet broadcasting in colour at the time of the 1970 elections.

The right to vote in this election was widened by the Labour government&#x27;s Sixth Reform Act, which reduced the voting age from 21 to 18 years. The United Kingdom was the first major democratic nation to extend suffrage to this age group. Case law subsequently established the right for undergraduate students to vote in the constituency of their university. This followed an appeal to the High Court.

==Timeline==
The Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, visited Buckingham Palace on 18 May and asked the Queen to dissolve Parliament on 29 May, announcing that the election would be held on 18 June. The key dates were as follows:

==Results==
This was the first general election where 18-year-olds had the right to vote. Therefore, despite 1.1 million more people voting in 1970 compared to 1966, turnout actually fell by 3%. This 72% turnout was the lowest since the 1935 general election and compared with a post-War high of 84% in 1950. Professor Richard Rose described the low turnout, which he noted was &quot;one of the lowest since the introduction of the democratic franchise&quot;, as surprising to politician and pollsters. Changes to electoral law as part of the Representation of the People Act 1969 had made postal voting easier and polling stations were open an hour later than in past elections, and this would have been expected to improve turnout. On top of this it was reported by Rose that an estimated 25% of 18- to 21-year-olds who were now eligible to vote had not put their names on the electoral register, meaning the turnout was even lower than the percentage figure suggested. Rose also argued that the turnout figures in Britain were &quot;now among the lowest in the Western world.&quot; Because the previous election had been in 1966, some people had not had their chance to vote in a general election until the age of 25. Labour&#x27;s number of votes, 12.2 million, was ironically the same amount they had needed to win in 1964. The Conservative vote surge cost Labour in many marginal seats. Rose suggested the absolute fall in the number of Labour votes suggested that many of the party&#x27;s supporters had decided to abstain. He also noted that the Labour Party&#x27;s local organisation was poorer than that of the Conservatives, but did not feel this was a significant factor in Labour supporters failing to come out to vote for the Party given that this organisational difference had been the case in past elections without having this effect. For the Liberals, a small 1% drop in their vote share saw them lose 6 seats, 3 of which were held by the narrowest of margins.

In the end the Conservatives achieved a swing of 4.7%, enough to give them a comfortable working majority. As for the smaller parties, they increased their number in the Commons from 2 to 6 seats.

The Scottish National Party won its first ever seat at a general election (they had won several by-elections previously, going back as far as 1945), although they did lose Hamilton, which they won in a by-election in 1967.

<doc id="159618" wikidata="Q309589" url="?curid=159618" title="Peter Cushing">
<text>Peter Wilton Cushing (26 May 1913 – 11 August 1994) was an English actor. His acting career spanned over six decades and included appearances in more than 100 films, as well as many television, stage and radio roles. He achieved recognition for his leading performances in the Hammer Productions horror films from the 1950s to 1970s and as Grand Moff Tarkin in &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977).

Born in Kenley, Surrey, Cushing made his stage debut in 1935 and spent three years at a repertory theatre before moving to Hollywood to pursue a film career. After making his motion-picture debut in the film &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; (1939), Cushing began to find modest success in American films before returning to England at the outbreak of the Second World War. Despite performing in a string of roles, including one as Osric in Laurence Olivier&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1948), Cushing struggled to find work during this period. His career was revitalised once he started to work in live television plays and he soon became one of the most recognisable faces in British television. He earned particular acclaim for his lead performance as Winston Smith in a BBC adaptation of George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1954).

Cushing gained worldwide fame for his appearances in twenty-two horror films from the Hammer studio, particularly for his role as Baron Frankenstein in six of their seven &quot;Frankenstein&quot; films and Doctor Van Helsing in five &quot;Dracula&quot; films. Cushing often appeared alongside actor Christopher Lee, who became one of his closest friends, and occasionally with the American horror star Vincent Price. Cushing appeared in several other Hammer films, including &quot;The Abominable Snowman&quot; (1957), &quot;The Mummy&quot; and &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; (both 1959), the last of which marked the first of the several occasions he portrayed the detective Sherlock Holmes. Cushing continued to perform in a variety of roles, although he was often typecast as a horror film actor. He played Dr. Who in &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot; (1965) and &quot;Daleks&#x27; Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.&quot; (1966) and became even better known through his part in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film. Cushing continued acting into the early to mid-1990s and wrote two autobiographies.

==Early life==
Peter Wilton Cushing was born in Kenley, then a village in the English county of Surrey, on 26 May 1913 to George Edward Cushing (1881–1956) and Nellie Marie (née King) Cushing (1882–1961). His father, a quantity surveyor, was a reserved and uncommunicative man whom Peter said he never got to know very well. His mother was the daughter of a carpet merchant and considered of a lower class than her husband. Cushing&#x27;s family consisted of several stage actors, including his paternal grandfather Henry William Cushing (who toured with Henry Irving), his paternal aunt Maude Cushing (his father&#x27;s sister) and his step-uncle Wilton Herriot, after whom Peter Cushing received his middle name.

The Cushing family lived in Dulwich during the First World War, but moved to Purley after the war ended in 1918. Although raised during wartime, Cushing was too young to understand or become greatly affected by it, and was shielded from the horrors of war by his mother, who encouraged him to play games under the kitchen table whenever the threat of possible bombings arose. In his infancy, Cushing twice developed pneumonia and once what was then known as &quot;double pneumonia&quot;. The latter was often fatal during that period, although he survived. During one Christmas in his youth, Cushing saw a stage production of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, which served as an early source of inspiration and interest in acting. Cushing loved dressing up and make believe from an early age, and later claimed he always wanted to be an actor, &quot;perhaps without knowing at first.&quot; A fan of comics and toy collectibles in his youth, Cushing earned money by staging puppet shows for family members with his glove-puppets and toys.

He began his early education in Dulwich, South London, before attending the Shoreham Grammar School in Shoreham-by-Sea, on the Sussex coast between Brighton and Worthing. Prone to homesickness, he was miserable at the boarding school and spent only one term there before returning home. He attended the Purley County Grammar School, where he swam and played cricket and rugby. With the exception of art, Cushing was a self-proclaimed poor student in most subjects and had little attention span for that which did not interest him. He got fair grades only through the help of his brother, a strong student who did his homework for him. Cushing harboured aspirations for the arts all throughout his youth, especially acting. His childhood inspiration was Tom Mix, an American film actor and star of many Western films. D.J. Davies, the Purley County Grammar School physics teacher who produced all the school&#x27;s plays, recognised some acting potential in him and encouraged him to participate in the theatre, even allowing Cushing to skip class to paint sets. He played the lead in nearly every school production during his teenage years, including the role of Sir Anthony Absolute in a 1929 staging of Richard Brinsley Sheridan&#x27;s comedy of manners play, &quot;The Rivals&quot;.

Cushing wanted to enter the acting profession after school, but his father opposed the idea, despite the theatrical background of several of his family members. Instead, seizing upon Cushing&#x27;s interest in art and drawing, he got his son a job as a surveyor&#x27;s assistant in the drawing department of the Coulsdon and Purley Urban District Council&#x27;s surveyor&#x27;s office during the summer of 1933. Cushing hated the job, where he remained for three years without promotion or advancement due to his lack of ambition in the profession. The only enjoyment he got out of it was drawing perspectives of proposed buildings, which were almost always rejected because they were too imaginative and expensive and lacked strong foundations, which Cushing disregarded as a &quot;mere detail.&quot;

Thanks to his former teacher Davies, Cushing continued to appear in school productions during this time, as well as amateur plays such as W. S. Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion and Galatea&quot;, George Kelly&#x27;s &quot;The Torch-Bearers&quot;, and &quot;The Red Umbrella&quot;, by Brenda Girvin and Monica Cosens. Cushing often learned and practised his lines in an attic at work, under the guise that he was putting ordnance survey maps into order. He regularly applied for auditions and openings for roles he found in the arts-oriented newspaper &quot;The Stage&quot;, but was turned down repeatedly due to his lack of professional experience in the theatre.

==Career==
===Early films and acting===
Cushing eventually applied for a scholarship at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. His first audition was before the actor Allan Aynesworth, who was so unimpressed with Cushing&#x27;s manner of speech that he rejected him outright and insisted he not return until he improved his diction. Cushing continued to pursue a scholarship, writing twenty-one letters to the school, until actor and theatre manager Bill Fraser finally agreed to meet Cushing in 1935 simply so he could ask him in person to stop writing. During that meeting, Cushing was given a walk-on part as a courier in that night&#x27;s production of J.B. Priestley&#x27;s &quot;Cornelius&quot;. This marked his professional stage debut, although he had no lines and did little more than stand on stage behind other actors. Afterward, he was granted the scholarship and given odd jobs around the theatre, such as selling refreshments and working as an assistant stage manager.

One of his earliest professional stage performances was in 1935 as Captain Randall in Ian Hay&#x27;s &quot;The Middle Watch&quot; at the Connaught Theatre in Worthing. By the end of the summer of 1936, Cushing accepted a job with the repertory theatre company Southampton Rep, working as assistant stage manager and performing in bit roles at the Grand Theatre in the Hampshire city. He spent the next three years in an apprenticeship at Southampton Rep., auditioning for character roles both there and in other surrounding theatres, eventually amassing almost 100 individual parts. While he was in Southampton, he met an 18-year-old fellow actor, Doreen Lawrence, and they were engaged to be married. Lawrence broke off the engagement, citing his frequent crying and bringing his parents on dates.

Soon, he felt the urge to pursue a film career in the United States. In 1939, his father bought him a one-way ticket to Hollywood, where he moved with only £50 to his name. Cushing met a Columbia Pictures employee named Larry Goodkind, who wrote him a letter of recommendation and directed him to acquaintances Goodkind knew at the company Edward Small Productions. Cushing visited the company, which was only a few days away from shooting &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; (1939), the James Whale-directed adaptation of the Alexandre Dumas tale based on the French legend of a prisoner during the reign of Louis XIV of France. Cushing was hired as a stand-in for scenes that featured both characters played by Louis Hayward, who had the dual lead roles of King Louis XIV and Philippe of Gascony. Cushing played one part against Hayward in one scene, then the opposite part in another, and ultimately the scenes were spliced together in a split screen process that featured Hayward in both parts and left Cushing&#x27;s work cut from the film altogether. Although the job meant Cushing received no actual screen time, he was eventually cast in a bit part as the king&#x27;s messenger, which made &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; his official film debut. The small role involved sword-fighting and, although Cushing had no experience with fencing, he told Whale he was an excellent fencer to ensure he got the part. Cushing later said his unscreened scenes alongside Hayward were terrible performances, but that his experience on the film provided an excellent opportunity to learn and observe how filming on a studio set worked.

Only a few days after filming on &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; was completed, Cushing was in the Schwab&#x27;s Drug Store, a famous Sunset Boulevard hangout spot for actors, when he learned producer Hal Roach was seeking an English actor for a comedy film starring Laurel and Hardy. Cushing sought and was cast in the role. Cushing appeared only briefly in &quot;A Chump at Oxford&quot; (1940) and his scenes took just one week to film, but he was proud to work with whom he called &quot;two of the greatest comedians the cinema has ever produced.&quot; Around this time actor Robert Coote, who met Cushing during a cricket game, recommended to director George Stevens that Cushing might be good for a part in Stevens&#x27; upcoming film &quot;Vigil in the Night&quot; (1940). Adapted from a serial novella of the same name, it was a drama film about a nurse played by Carole Lombard working in a poorly-equipped country hospital. Stevens cast Cushing in the second male lead role of Joe Shand, the husband of the Lombard character&#x27;s sister. Shooting ran from September to November 1939, and the film was released in 1940, drawing Cushing&#x27;s first semblance of attention and critical praise.

Cushing continued to work in a few Hollywood engagements, including an uncredited role in the war film &quot;They Dare Not Love&quot; (1941), which reunited him with director James Whale. Cushing was cast (again uncredited) in one of a series of short films in an entry in the MGM series &quot;The Passing Parade&quot;, which focused on strange-but-true historical events. He appeared in the episode &quot;The Hidden Master&quot; (1940) as a young Clive of India, well before the soldier established the military and political supremacy of the East India Company. In the film, Clive tries to shoot himself twice but the gun misfires, then he fires a third time at a pitcher of water and the gun works perfectly. Clive takes this to be an omen that he should live, and he goes on to perform great feats in his life. Studio executives were pleased with Cushing&#x27;s performance, and there was talk among Hollywood insiders grooming him for stardom. Despite the promise, however, Cushing grew homesick and decided he wished to return to England. He moved to New York City in anticipation of his eventual return home, during which time he voiced a few radio commercials and joined a summer stock theatre company to raise money for his voyage back to England. He performed in such plays as Robert E. Sherwood&#x27;s &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot;, Arnold Ridley&#x27;s &quot;The Ghost Train&quot;, S. N. Behrman&#x27;s &quot;Biography&quot; and a modern dress version of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;. He was eventually noticed by a Broadway theatre talent scout, and in 1941 he made his Broadway debut in the religious wartime drama &quot;The Seventh Trumpet&quot;. It received poor reviews, however, and ran for only eleven days.

===Return to England and theatrical work ===
Cushing returned to England during the Second World War. Although some childhood injuries prevented him from serving on active duty, a friend suggested he entertain the troops by performing as part of the Entertainments National Service Association. In 1942, the Noël Coward play &quot;Private Lives&quot; was touring the military stations and hospitals in the British Isles, and the actor playing the lead role of Elyot Chase was called to service. Cushing agreed to take his place with very little notice or time to prepare, and earned a salary of ten pounds a week for the job. During this tour he met Violet Hélène &quot;Helen&quot; Beck, a former dancer who was starring in the lead female role of Amanda Prynne. They fell in love and were married on 10 April 1943. Cushing eventually had to leave ENSA due to lung congestion, an ailment his wife helped him recover from. The two had little money around this time, and Cushing had to collect from both National Assistance and the Actors&#x27; Benevolent Fund. Cushing struggled to find work during this period, with some plays he was cast in failing to even make it past rehearsals into theatres. Others closed after a few showings, like an ambitious five-hour stage adaptation of Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s novel &quot;War and Peace&quot; that opened and closed in 1943 in London&#x27;s Phoenix Theatre.

Cushing recorded occasional radio spots and appeared in week-long stints as a featured player in London&#x27;s Q Theatre, but otherwise work was difficult to come by. He found a modest success in a 1945 production of Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The Rivals&quot; at Westminster&#x27;s Criterion Theatre, which earned him enough money to pay off some growing debts. The war years continued to prove difficult for him, however, and at one point he was forced to work designing ladies head-scarves at a Macclesfield-based silk manufacturer to make ends meet. In the autumn of 1946, after the war ended, Cushing unsuccessfully auditioned for the part of Paul Verrall in a stage production of the play &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; that was being staged by famed actor and director Laurence Olivier. He was not cast because he insisted he could not perform in an American accent. After Cushing attempted the accent and failed, Olivier replied, &quot;Well, I appreciate you not wasting my time. I shall remember you.&quot; Nearing middle age and finding it increasingly harder to make a living in acting, Cushing began to consider himself a failure.

In 1947, when Laurence Olivier sought him out for his film adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Cushing&#x27;s wife Helen pushed him to pursue a role. Far from being deterred by Cushing&#x27;s unsuccessful audition the year before, Olivier remembered the actor well and was happy to cast him, but the only character left unfilled was the relatively small part of the foppish courtier Osric. Cushing accepted the role, and &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1948) marked his British film debut. One of Cushing&#x27;s primary scenes involved Osric talking to Hamlet and Horatio while walking down a wide stone spiral stairway. The set provided technical difficulties, and all of Cushing&#x27;s lines had to be post-synched. Cushing had recently undergone dental surgery and he was trying not to open his mouth widely for fear of spitting. When this hindered the post-synching process, Olivier leaned in close to Cushing&#x27;s face and said, &quot;Now drown me. It&#x27;ll be a glorious death, so long as I can hear what you&#x27;re saying.&quot;

&quot;Hamlet&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and earned Cushing praise for his performance. Also appearing in the film was Christopher Lee, who eventually became a close friend and frequent co-star with Cushing. Cushing designed custom hand-scarves in honour of the &quot;Hamlet&quot; film, and as it was being exhibited across England, the scarves were eventually accepted as gifts by the Queen and her daughter Princess Elizabeth. After &quot;Hamlet&quot;, both Peter and Helen Cushing accepted a personal invitation from Olivier to join Old Vic, Olivier&#x27;s repertory theatre company, which embarked on a year-long tour of Australasia. The tour, which lasted until February 1949, took them to Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Hobart, Tasmania, Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin, and included performances of Richard Brinsley Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;, Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;, Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot;, Jean Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;Antigone&quot; and Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Proposal&quot;.

===Success in television and major films===
Cushing struggled greatly to find work over the next few years, and became so stressed that he felt he was suffering from an extended nervous breakdown. Nevertheless, he continued to appear in several small roles in radio, theatre and film. Among them was the John Huston film &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; (1952) in which he played a racing spectator named Marcel de la Voisier appearing with José Ferrer, who played the artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. During this discouraging period for Cushing, his wife encouraged him to seek roles in television, which was beginning to develop in England. She suggested he write to all the producers listed in the &quot;Radio Times&quot; magazine seeking work in the medium. The move proved to be a wise one, as Cushing was hired to complement the cast of a string of major theatre successes that were being adapted to live television. The first was J.B. Priestley&#x27;s &quot;Eden End&quot;, which was televised in December 1951. Over the next three years, he became one of the most active and favoured names in British television, and was considered a pioneer in British television drama.

He earned praise for playing the lead male role of Mr. Darcy in an early BBC Television serialisation of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1952). Other successful television ventures during this time included &quot;Epitaph for a Spy&quot;, &quot;The Noble Spaniard&quot;, &quot;Beau Brummell&quot;, &quot;Portrait by Peko&quot;, and &quot;Anastasia&quot;, the latter of which won Cushing the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; National Television Award for Best Actor of 1953–54. His largest television success from this period was the leading role of Winston Smith in &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, (1954) an adaptation by Nigel Kneale of George Orwell&#x27;s novel of the same name about a totalitarian regime. The production proved to be controversial, resulting in death threats for director Rudolph Cartier and causing Cushing to be vilified for appearing in such &quot;filth.&quot; Parliament even considered a motion immediately after the first screening to ban the play&#x27;s live repeat. Nevertheless, a second televised production was filmed and aired, and Cushing eventually drew both critical praise and acting awards, further cementing his reputation as one of Britain&#x27;s biggest television stars. Cushing felt his first performance was much stronger than the second, but the second production is the only known surviving version.

In the two years following &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, Cushing appeared in thirty-one television plays and two serials, and won Best Television Actor of the Year from the &quot;Evening Chronicle&quot;. He also won best actor awards from the Guild of Television Producers in 1955, and from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 1956. Among the plays he appeared in during this time were Terence Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;The Browning Version&quot;, Gordon Daviot&#x27;s &quot;Richard of Bordeaux&quot;, and the production of Nigel Kneale&#x27;s &quot;The Creature&quot; (1955), the latter of which Cushing starred in film adaptation released in 1957. Despite this continued success in live television, Cushing found the medium too stressful and wished to return to film. Cinematic roles proved somewhat difficult to find, however, as film producers were often resentful of television stars for drawing audiences away from the cinema.

Nevertheless, he continued to work in some film roles during this period, including the adventure film &quot;The Black Knight&quot; (1954) opposite Alan Ladd. For that film, he travelled to Spain and filmed scenes on location in the castles of Manzanares el Real and El Escorial. He also starred in the film adaptation of the Graham Greene novel &quot;The End of the Affair&quot; (1955) as Henry Miles, an important civil servant and the cuckolded husband of Sarah Miles, played by Deborah Kerr. Also around the same time, he appeared in &quot;Magic Fire&quot; (also 1955), an autobiographical film about the German composer Richard Wagner. Filmed on location in Munich, Cushing played Otto Wesendonck, the husband of poet Mathilde Wesendonck, who in the film is portrayed as having an affair with Wagner.

===Hammer Frankenstein films===

During a brief quiet period following Cushing&#x27;s television work, he read in trade publications about Hammer, a low-budget production company seeking to adapt Mary Shelley&#x27;s horror novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; into a new film. Cushing, who enjoyed the tale as a child, had his agent John Redway inform the company of Cushing&#x27;s interest in playing the protagonist, Baron Victor Frankenstein. The studio executives were anxious to have Cushing; in fact, Hammer co-founder James Carreras had been unsuccessfully courting Cushing for film roles in other projects even before his major success with &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. Cushing was about twenty years older than Baron Frankenstein as he appeared in the original novel, but that did not deter the filmmakers. Cushing was cast in the lead role of &quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot; (1957), marking the first of twenty-two films he made for Hammer. He later said that his career decisions entailed selecting roles where he knew that he would be accepted by the audience. &quot;Who wants to see me as Hamlet? Very few. But millions want to see me as [Baron] Frankenstein, so that&#x27;s the one I do.&quot; The film critic Roger Ebert described Cushing&#x27;s work in the Hammer films: &quot;[Cushing is] the one in all those British horror films, standing between Vincent Price and Christopher Lee. His dialog usually runs along the lines of, &#x27;But good heavens, man! The person you saw has been dead for more than two centuries!

Unlike &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931) produced by Universal, the Hammer films revolved mainly around Victor Frankenstein, rather than his monster. Screenwriter Jimmy Sangster wrote the protagonist as an ambitious, egotistical and coldly intellectual scientist who despised his contemporaries. Unlike the character from the novel and past film versions, Cushing&#x27;s Baron Frankenstein commits vicious crimes to attain his goals, including the murder of a colleague to obtain a brain for his creature. &quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot; also featured Christopher Lee, who played Frankenstein&#x27;s monster. Cushing and Lee became extremely close friends, and remained so for the rest of Cushing&#x27;s life. They first met on the set of the film, where Lee was still wearing the monster make-up prepared by Phil Leakey. Hammer Studios&#x27; publicity department put out a story that when Cushing first encountered Lee without the make-up on, he screamed in terror.

Cushing so valued preparation for his role that he insisted on being trained by a surgeon to learn how to wield a scalpel authentically. Shot in dynamic colour with a £65,000-budget, the film became known for its heavy usage of gore and sexual content. As a result, while the film did well at the box-office with its target audience, it drew mixed to negative reviews from the critics. Most, however, were complimentary of Cushing&#x27;s performance, claiming it added a layer of distinction and credibility to the film. Many felt Cushing&#x27;s performance helped create the archetypal mad scientist character. &quot;Picturegoer&quot; writer Margaret Hinxman, who was not complimentary of Lee&#x27;s performance, praised Cushing and wrote of the film: &quot;Although this shocker may not have created much of a monster, it may well have created something more lasting: a star!&quot; Donald F. Glut, a writer and filmmaker who wrote a book about the portrayals of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, said the inner warmth of Cushing&#x27;s off-screen personality was apparent on-screen even despite the horrific elements of Frankenstein, which helped add a layer of likability to the character.

&quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot; was an overnight success, bringing both Cushing and Lee worldwide fame. The two men continued to work together in many films for Hammer, and their names became synonymous with the company. Cushing reprised the role of Baron Victor Frankenstein in five sequels. In the first, &quot;The Revenge of Frankenstein&quot; (1958), his protagonist is sentenced to death by guillotine, but he flees and hides under the alias Doctor Victor Stein. He returned for &quot;The Evil of Frankenstein&quot; (1963), where the Baron has a carnival hypnotist resurrect his monster&#x27;s inactive brain, and &quot;Frankenstein Created Woman&quot; (1967), in which the Frankenstein&#x27;s monster is a woman played by &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine centrefold model Susan Denberg. Cushing played the lead role twice more in &quot;Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed&quot; (1969) and &quot;Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell&quot; (1974). The former film portrays Frankenstein as a far more ruthless character than had been seen before, and features a scene in which Cushing&#x27;s Frankenstein rapes the character played by Veronica Carlson. Neither Carlson nor Cushing wanted to do the scene, filmed despite director Terence Fisher&#x27;s objections, and the controversial sequence was edited out of the film for its American release. In &quot;Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell&quot;, Cushing portrayed Frankenstein as having gone completely mad, in a fitting coda to the earlier films.

===Hammer Dracula films===

When Hammer sought to adapt Bram Stoker&#x27;s classic vampire novel &quot;Dracula&quot;, they cast Cushing to play the vampire&#x27;s adversary Doctor Van Helsing. Cushing envisioned the character as an idealist warrior for the greater good, and studied the original book carefully and adapted several of Van Helsing&#x27;s characteristics from the books into his performance, including the repeated gesture of raising his index finger to emphasise an important point. Cushing said one of the biggest challenges during filming was not missing whenever he struck a prop stake with a mallet and drove it into a vampire&#x27;s heart. &quot;Dracula&quot; was released in 1958, with Cushing once again starring opposite Lee, who played the title character, although Cushing was given top billing. During filming, Cushing himself suggested the staging for the final confrontation scene, in which Van Helsing leaps onto a large library table, opens window curtains to weaken Dracula with sunlight, then uses two candlesticks as a makeshift crucifix to drive the vampire into the sunlight. As with the &quot;Frankenstein&quot; film, critics largely disliked &quot;Dracula&quot; because of its violence and sexual content, deeming it inferior to the 1931 Universal version.

In 1959, Cushing agreed to reprise the role of Van Helsing in the sequel, &quot;The Brides of Dracula&quot; (1960). Before filming began, however, Cushing said he had reservations about the screenplay written by Jimmy Sangster and Peter Bryan. As a result, playwright Edward Percy was brought in to make modifications to the script, though the rewrites pushed filming into early 1960 and brought additional costs to the production. For the sequel, &quot;&quot; (1966), which marked Lee&#x27;s return to the title role for the first time since 1958, Cushing granted permission for archival footage featuring him to be used in the opening scene, a reprisal of the climax from the first &quot;Dracula&quot; film. In exchange, Hammer&#x27;s James Carreras thanked Cushing by paying for extensive roofing repair work that had recently been done on Cushing&#x27;s recently purchased Whitstable home. Cushing appeared in &quot; Dracula A.D. 1972&quot; (1972), a Hammer modernisation of the Dracula story set in the then-present day. Lee once again starred as Dracula. In the opening scene, Cushing portrays the nineteenth century Van Helsing as he did in the previous films, and the character is killed after battling Dracula. Thereafter the action jumps ahead to 1972, and Cushing plays the original character&#x27;s grandson for the bulk of the movie. Cushing performed many of his own stunts in &quot;Dracula A.D. 1972&quot;, which included tumbling off a haywagon during a fight with Dracula. Christopher Neame, who also starred in the film, said he was particularly impressed with Cushing&#x27;s agility and fitness, considering his age. Cushing and Lee both reprised their respective roles in the sequel &quot;The Satanic Rites of Dracula&quot; (1974), which was known in the United States as &quot;Count Dracula and his Vampire Bride&quot;. Around the same time, Cushing played the original nineteenth-century Van Helsing in &quot;The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires&quot; (also 1974), a co-production between Hammer Studios and the Shaw Brothers Studio, which brought Chinese martial arts into the Dracula story. In that film, Cushing&#x27;s Van Helsing travels to the Chinese city Chongqing, where Count Dracula is heading a vampire cult.

===Other Hammer roles===
Although most well known for his roles in the &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Dracula&quot; films, Cushing appeared in a wide variety of other Hammer productions during this time. Both he and his wife feared that he would become typecast into horror roles, but he continued to take them because they guaranteed regular work. He appeared in the horror film &quot;The Abominable Snowman&quot; (1957), a Hammer adaptation of a BBC Nigel Kneale television play &quot;The Creature&quot; (1955) which Cushing had also starred in. He portrayed an English botanist searching the Himalayas for the legendary Yeti. Director Val Guest said he was particularly impressed with Cushing&#x27;s preparation and ability to plan which props to best use to enhance his performance, so much so that Cushing started to become known as &quot;Props Peter&quot;. Cushing and Lee appeared together in the Hammer horror &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1959), with Cushing as the archaeologist John Banning and Lee as the antagonist Kharis. Cushing saw a promotional poster for &quot;The Mummy&quot; that showed Lee&#x27;s character with a large hole in his chest, allowing a beam of light to pass through his body. There was no reference to such an injury in the film script, and when he asked the publicity department why it was on the poster, they said it was simply meant to serve as a shocking image to promote the movie. During filming, he asked director Terence Fisher for permission to drive a harpoon through the mummy&#x27;s body during a fight scene to explain the poster image. Fisher agreed, and the scene was used in the film.

Around the same time, he portrayed the detective Sherlock Holmes in the Hammer production of &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; (also 1959), an adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s novel of the same name. He again co-starred opposite Lee, who portrayed the aristocratic Sir Henry Baskerville. A huge fan of Sherlock Holmes, Cushing was highly anxious to play the character, and reread the novels in anticipation of the role. Hammer decided to heighten the source novel&#x27;s horror elements, which upset the estate of Conan Doyle, but Cushing himself voiced no objection to the creative licence because he felt the character of Holmes himself remained intact. However, when producer Anthony Hinds proposed removing the character&#x27;s deerstalker, Cushing insisted they remain because audiences associated Holmes with his headgear and pipes. He prepared extensively for the role, studying the novel and taking notes in his script. He scrutinised the costumes and screenwriter Peter Bryan&#x27;s script, often altering words or phrases. Lee later claimed to be awestruck by Cushing&#x27;s ability to incorporate many different props and actions into his performance simultaneously, whether reading, smoking a pipe, drinking whiskey, filing through papers, or other things while portraying Holmes. In later years, Cushing considered his Holmes performance one of the finest accomplishments of his career. He drew generally mixed reviews: &quot;Film Daily&quot; called it a &quot;tantalising performance&quot; and &quot;Time Out&quot; David Pirie called it &quot;one of his very best performances&quot;, while the &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; called him &quot;tiresomely mannered and too lightweight&quot; and BBC Television&#x27;s Barry Norman said he &quot;didn&#x27;t quite capture the air of know-all arrogance that was the great detective&#x27;s hallmark&quot;. &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; was originally conceived as the first in a series of Sherlock Holmes films, but no sequels were made.
Immediately upon completion of &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, Cushing was offered the lead role in the Hammer film &quot;The Man Who Could Cheat Death&quot; (1959), a remake of &quot;The Man in Half Moon Street&quot; (1945). He turned it down, in part because he did not like the script by Jimmy Sangster, and the lead role was taken instead by Anton Diffring. Cushing next appeared for Hammer when he played the Sheriff of Nottingham in the adventure film &quot;Sword of Sherwood Forest&quot; (1960), which starred Richard Greene as the outlaw Robin Hood. It was filmed on location in County Wicklow in the Republic of Ireland. The next year, Cushing starred as an Ebenezer Scrooge-like manager of a bank being robbed in the Hammer thriller film &quot;Cash on Demand&quot; (1961). He considered this among the favourites of his films, and some critics believed it to be among his best performances, although it was one of the least-seen films from his career. He appeared in the Hammer film &quot;Captain Clegg&quot; (1962), known in the United States as &quot;Night Creatures&quot;. Cushing starred as Parson Blyss, the local reverend of an 18th-century English coastal town believed to be hiding his smuggling activities with reports of ghosts. The film was roughly based on the Doctor Syn novels by Russell Thorndike. Cushing read Thorndike to prepare for the role and made suggestions to make-up artist Roy Ashton about Blyss&#x27; costume and hairstyle. He and director Peter Graham Scott did not get along well during filming and at one point, when the two were having a disagreement on set, Cushing turned to cameraman Len Harris and said, &quot;Take no notice, Len. We&#x27;ve done enough of these now to know what we&#x27;re doing.&quot;

Cushing and Lee appeared together in the horror film &quot;The Gorgon&quot; (1964) about the female snake-haired Gorgon character from Greek mythology and in &quot;She&quot; (1965), about a lost realm ruled by the immortal queen Ayesha, played by Ursula Andress. Cushing later appeared in &quot;The Vampire Lovers&quot; (1970), an erotic Hammer horror film about a lesbian vampire, adapted in part from the Sheridan Le Fanu novella &quot;Carmilla&quot;. The next year he was set to star in a sequel, &quot;Lust for a Vampire&quot; (1971), but had to drop out because his wife was ill and Ralph Bates substituted. However, Cushing was able to star in &quot;Twins of Evil&quot; (also 1971), a prequel of sorts to &quot;The Vampire Lovers&quot;, as Gustav Weil, the leader of a group of religious puritans trying to stamp out witchcraft and satanism. Among his final Hammer roles was &quot;Fear in the Night&quot; (1972), where he played a one-armed school headmaster apparently terrorising the protagonist, played by Judy Geeson.

===Non-Hammer film work===
Although best known for his Hammer performances from the 1950s to the 1970s, Cushing worked in a variety of other roles during this time, and actively sought roles outside the horror genre to diversify his work. In an interview published in &quot;ABC Film Review&quot; in November 1964, Cushing stated, &quot;People look at me as if I were some sort of monster, but I can&#x27;t think why. In my macabre pictures, I have either been a monster-maker or a monster-destroyer, but never a monster. Actually, I&#x27;m a gentle fellow. Never harmed a fly. I love animals, and when I&#x27;m in the country I&#x27;m a keen bird-watcher.&quot; In an interview published in 1966, he added, &quot;I do get terribly tired with the neighbourhood kids telling me &#x27;My mum says she wouldn&#x27;t want to meet you in a dark alley&#x27;.&quot; He continued to perform in occasional stage productions, such as Robert E. MacEnroe&#x27;s &quot;The Silver Whistle&quot; at Westminster&#x27;s Duchess Theatre in 1956. Around the same time, he appeared in the film &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; (1956) as the Athenian General Memnon of Rhodes. In 1959, Cushing originally planned to appear in the lead role of William Fairchild&#x27;s play &quot;The Sound of Murder&quot;, while shooting a film at the same time. The hectic schedule became overbearing for Cushing, who had to drop out of the play and resolved to never again attempt a film and play simultaneously.

He appeared in the biographical epic film &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; (1959), in which Robert Stack played the title role of the American naval fighter in the American Revolutionary War. Cushing became very ill with dysentery during filming and lost a considerable amount of weight as a result. Cushing played Robert Knox in &quot;The Flesh and the Fiends&quot; (1960), based on the true story of the doctor who purchased human corpses for research from the serial killer duo Burke and Hare. Cushing had previously stated Knox was one of his role models in developing his portrayal of Baron Frankenstein. The film was called &quot;Mania&quot; in its American release. Cushing appeared in several films released in 1961, including &quot;Fury at Smugglers&#x27; Bay&quot;, an adventure film about pirates scavenging ships off the English coastline; &quot;The Hellfire Club&quot;, where he played a lawyer helping a young man expose a cult; and &quot;The Naked Edge&quot;, a British-American thriller about a woman who suspects her husband framed another man for murder. The latter film starred Deborah Kerr, Cushing&#x27;s co-star from &quot;The End of the Affair&quot;, and Gary Cooper, one of Cushing&#x27;s favourite actors. In 1965, Cushing appeared in the Ben Travers farce play &quot;Thark&quot; at Westminster&#x27;s Garrick Theatre. It was his final stage performance for a decade, but he continued to stay active in film and television during this period.

Cushing took the lead role in two science fiction films by AARU Productions based on the British television series, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Although Cushing&#x27;s protagonist was derived from television scripts used for First Doctor serials, his portrayal of the character differed in the fact that Cushing&#x27;s Dr. Who was a human being, whereas the original Doctor as portrayed on TV by William Hartnell was extraterrestrial. Cushing played the role in &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot; (1965) and &quot;Daleks&#x27; Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.&quot; (1966).

Cushing later starred in the fifteen-episode BBC television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, once again reprising his role as the title character with Nigel Stock as Watson, though only six episodes now survive. The episodes aired in 1968. Douglas Wilmer had previously played Holmes for the BBC, but he turned down the part in this series due to the extremely demanding filming schedule. Fourteen days of rehearsal was originally scheduled for each episode, but they were cut down to ten days for economic reasons. Many actors turned down the role as a result, but Cushing accepted, and the BBC believed his Hammer Studios persona would bring what they called a sense of &quot;lurking horror and callous savagery&quot; to the series. Production lasted from May to December, and Cushing adopted a strict regimen of training, preparation and exercise. He tried to keep his performance identical to his portrayal of Holmes from &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;. Although the series proved popular, Cushing felt he could not give his best performance under the hectic schedule, and he was not pleased with the final result.

Cushing appeared in a handful of horror films by the independent Amicus Productions, including &quot;Dr. Terror&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; (1965), as a man who could see into the future using Tarot cards; &quot;The Skull&quot; (1965), as a professor who became possessed by a spiritual force embodied within a skull; and &quot;Torture Garden&quot; (1967), as a collector of Edgar Allan Poe relics who is robbed and murdered by a rival. Cushing also appeared in non-Amicus horror films like &quot;Island of Terror&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Blood Beast Terror&quot; (1968), in both of which he investigates a series of mysterious deaths. He appeared in &quot;Corruption&quot; (1968), a film that was billed as so horrific that &quot;no woman will be admitted alone&quot; into theatres to see it. Cushing played a surgeon who attempts to restore the beauty of his wife (played by Sue Lloyd), whose face is horribly scarred in an accident.

In July 1969, Cushing appeared as the straight man in &quot;The Morecambe &amp; Wise Show&quot;, the British comedy series. In the skit, Cushing portrayed King Arthur, while the other two gave comedic portrayals of characters like Merlin and the knights of the Round Table. Cushing continued to make occasional cameos in the series over the next decade, portraying himself desperately attempting to collect a payment for his previous acting appearance on the show. Cushing and Lee made cameos as their old roles of Frankenstein and Dracula in the comedy &quot;One More Time&quot; (1970), which starred Peter Lawford and Sammy Davis Jr. The single scene took only one morning of filming, which Cushing agreed to after Davis asked him to do it as a favour. The next year, Cushing appeared in &quot;I, Monster&quot; (1971), which was adapted from Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;, alongside Lee as the Jekyll/Hyde figure. Later that year he was set to appear in &quot;Blood from the Mummy&#x27;s Tomb&quot; (1971), an adaptation of the Bram Stoker novel &quot;The Jewel of Seven Stars&quot;. He was forced to withdraw from the film to care for his wife, and was ultimately replaced by Andrew Keir.
In 1971, Cushing contacted the Royal National Institute for the Blind and offered to provide voice acting for some of their audiobooks. They immediately accepted, and among the works Cushing recorded was &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a collection of thirteen one-hour stories. He appeared alongside Vincent Price in &quot;Dr. Phibes Rises Again!&quot; (1972), a sequel to &quot;The Abominable Dr. Phibes&quot;, and then co-starred with Price again in the film &quot;Madhouse&quot; (1974). He once again starred with longtime collaborator Christopher Lee in &quot;Horror Express&quot; (1972). Cushing continued to appear in several Amicus Productions films during this period, including &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; (1972), &quot;From Beyond the Grave&quot; (1973), &quot;And Now the Screaming Starts!&quot; (1973), and &quot;The Beast Must Die&quot; (1974).

For &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, an anthology film made up of several horror segments, Cushing was offered the part of a ruthless businessman but did not like the part and turned down the role. Instead, Cushing asked to play Arthur Grymsdyke, a kind, working-class widower who gets along well with the local children, but falls subject to a smear campaign by his snobbish neighbours. Eventually, the character is driven to commit suicide, but returns from the grave to seek revenge against his tormentors. After Cushing was cast in the role, several changes were made to the script at his suggestion. Originally, all of the character&#x27;s lines were spoken aloud to himself, but Cushing suggested he speak to a framed photo of his deceased wife instead, and director Freddie Francis agreed. Cushing used the emotions from the recent loss of his wife to add authenticity to the widower character&#x27;s grieving. Make-up artist Roy Ashton designed the costume and make-up Cushing wore when he rose from the dead, but the actor helped Ashton develop the costume, and donned a pair of false teeth that he previously used in a disguise during the &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; television series. His performance in &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; won him the Best Male Actor award at the 1971 French Convention of Fantasy Cinema in France.

In 1975, Cushing was anxious to return to the stage, where he had not performed in ten years. Around this time he learned that Helen Ryan, an actress who impressed him in a televised play about King Edward VII, was planning to run the Horseshoe Theatre in Basingstoke with her husband, Guy Slater. Cushing wrote to the couple and suggested they stage &quot;The Heiress&quot;, a play by Ruth and Augustus Goetz, with Cushing himself in the lead role. Ryan and Slater agreed, and Cushing later said performing the part was his most pleasant experience since his wife had died four years earlier. Cushing also starred in several horror films released in 1975. Among them were &quot;Land of the Minotaur&quot;, where he played Baron Corofax, the evil leader of a Satanic cult opposed by a priest played by Donald Pleasence. Another was &quot;The Ghoul&quot;, where he played a former priest hiding his cannibalistic son in an attic. That film marked the first Cushing worked for producer Kevin Francis, who worked in minor jobs at Hammer and had long aspired to work with Cushing, whom he admired deeply. They went on to make two other films together, &quot;Legend of the Werewolf&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Masks of Death&quot; (1984) with the actor playing Sherlock Holmes once more. Cushing appeared in the television film &quot;The Great Houdini&quot; (1976) as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes. Cushing wrote the forewords to two books about the detective: Peter Haining&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes Scrapbook&quot; (1974) and &quot;Holmes of the Movies: The Screen Career of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1976), by David Stuart Davies. Cushing also appeared in the horror film &quot;The Uncanny&quot; (1977).

===&quot;Star Wars&quot;===
Film director George Lucas approached Cushing with the hopes of casting the actor in his upcoming space fantasy film, &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Since the film&#x27;s primary antagonist Darth Vader wore a mask throughout the entire film and his face was never visible, Lucas felt that a strong human villain character was necessary. This led him to write the character of Grand Moff Tarkin: a high-ranking Imperial governor and commander of the planet-destroying battlestation, the Death Star. Lucas felt a talented actor was needed to play the role and said Cushing was his first choice. However, Cushing has claimed that Lucas originally approached him to play the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and only decided to cast him as Tarkin instead after the two met. He said he would have preferred to play Kenobi rather than Tarkin but could not have done so because he was to be filming other movie roles when &quot;Star Wars&quot; was shooting, and Tarkin&#x27;s scenes took less time to film than those of the larger Kenobi role. Although not a particular fan of science fiction, Cushing accepted the part because he believed his audience would love &quot;Star Wars&quot; and enjoy seeing him in the film.

Cushing joined the cast in May 1976, and his scenes were filmed at Elstree Studios in Borehamwood. Along with Alec Guinness, who was ultimately cast as Kenobi, he was among the best-known actors at the time to appear in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, as the rest of the cast were then relatively unknown. As a result, he was paid a larger daily salary than most of his fellow cast, earning £2,000 per day compared to weekly salaries of $1,000 for Mark Hamill, $850 for Carrie Fisher, and $750 for Harrison Ford, who played protagonists Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia Organa, and Han Solo, respectively. When Cushing smoked between shots, he wore a white glove so the make-up artists would not have to deal with nicotine stains on his fingers. Like Guinness, he had difficulty with some of the technical jargon in his dialogue and claimed he did not understand all of the words he was speaking. Nevertheless, he worked hard to master the lines so that they sounded natural and his character appeared intelligent and confident.

Cushing got along well with the entire cast, especially his old Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell co-star David Prowse, who played Darth Vader, and Carrie Fisher, who was appearing in her first major role as Princess Leia Organa. The scene in which Tarkin and Organa appear together on the Death Star, just before the destruction of the planet Alderaan, was the first scene with major dialogue that Fisher filmed for &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Cushing consciously attempted to define their characters as opposite representations of good and evil, and he purposely stood in the shadows so the light shone on Fisher&#x27;s face. Fisher said she liked Cushing so much that it was difficult to act as though she hated Tarkin, and she had to substitute somebody else in her mind to muster the feelings. Although one of her lines referred to Tarkin&#x27;s &quot;foul stench,&quot; she said the actual actor smelled like &quot;linen and lavender,&quot; something Cushing attributed to his tendency to wash and brush his teeth thoroughly before filming because of his self-consciousness about bad breath.

During the filming of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Cushing was provided with a pair of boots far too small to accommodate his size twelve feet. This caused a great deal of pain for him during shooting, but the costume designers did not have enough time to get him another pair. As a result, he asked Lucas to film as many shots of him as possible from the waist up and, after the director agreed, Cushing wore slippers during the scenes where his feet were not visible. During rehearsals, Lucas originally planned for Tarkin and Vader to use a giant screen filled with computerised architectural representations of hallways to monitor the whereabouts of Skywalker, Solo, and Organa. Although the idea was abandoned before filming began, Cushing and Prowse rehearsed those scenes in a set built by computer animation artist Larry Cuba. The close-up shots of Cushing aboard the Death Star, shown right before the battlestation is destroyed, were actually extra footage taken from previously shot scenes with Cushing that did not make the final film. During production, Lucas decided to add those shots, along with second unit footage of the Death Star gunners preparing to fire, to add more suspense to the film&#x27;s space battle scenes.

When &quot;Star Wars&quot; was first released in 1977, most preliminary advertisements touted Cushing&#x27;s Tarkin as the primary antagonist of the film, not Vader; Cushing was extremely pleased with the final film, and he claimed his only disappointment was that Tarkin was killed and could not appear in the sequels. The film gave him the highest amount of visibility of his entire career and helped inspire younger audiences to watch his older films.

For the film &quot;Rogue One&quot; (2016), CGI and digitally-repurposed-archive footage were used to insert Cushing&#x27;s likeness from the original movie over the face of actor Guy Henry. Henry provided the on-set capture and voice work with the reference material augmented and mapped over his performance like a digital body-mask. Cushing&#x27;s estate owners were heavily involved with the creation, which took place more than twenty years after Cushing died. This extensive use of CGI to &quot;resurrect&quot; an actor who had died many years earlier created a great deal of controversy about the ethics of using a deceased actor&#x27;s likeness. Joyce Broughton, Cushing&#x27;s former secretary, had approved recreating Cushing in the film. After attending the London premiere, she was reportedly &quot;taken aback&quot; and &quot;dazzled&quot; with the effect of seeing him on screen again.

===Later career===
Toward the end of his career, Cushing performed in films and roles critics widely considered below his talent. Director John Carpenter approached him to appear in the horror film &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978) as Samuel Loomis, the psychiatrist of murderer Michael Myers, but Cushing turned down the role. It was also turned down by Christopher Lee, and eventually went to Donald Pleasence, another of Cushing&#x27;s former co-stars. Cushing appeared alongside his old co-stars Christopher Lee and Vincent Price in &quot;House of the Long Shadows&quot; (1983), a horror-parody film featuring Desi Arnaz Jr. as an author trying to write a gothic novel in a deserted Welsh mansion.

Cushing appeared in the television film &quot;The Masks of Death&quot; (1984), marking both the last time he played detective Sherlock Holmes and the final performance for which he received top billing. He appeared alongside actor John Mills as Watson, and the two were noted by critics for their strong chemistry and camaraderie. As both actors were in their seventies, screenwriter N.J. Crisp and executive producer Kevin Francis both in turn sought to portray them as two old-fashioned men in a rapidly changing world. Cushing&#x27;s biographer Tony Earnshaw said Cushing&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Masks of Death&quot; was arguably the actor&#x27;s best interpretation of the role, calling it &quot;the culmination of a life-time as a Holmes fan, and more than a quarter of a century of preparation to play the most complex of characters&quot;. The final notable roles of Cushing&#x27;s career were in the comedy &quot;Top Secret!&quot; (1984), the fantasy film &quot;Sword of the Valiant&quot; (also 1984) and the adventure film &quot;&quot; (1986). In 1986, he appeared on the British television show &quot;Jim&#x27;ll Fix It&quot;, hosted by Jimmy Savile, in which it was arranged for the wishes of guests to be granted. Cushing wished for a strain of rose to be named after his late wife, and it was arranged for the Helen Cushing Rose to be grown at the Wheatcroft Rose Garden in Edwalton, Nottinghamshire.

During this period, Cushing was honoured by the British Film Institute, which invited him in 1986 to give a lecture at the National Film Theatre. He also staged &quot;An Evening with Peter Cushing&quot; at St. Edmund&#x27;s Public School in Canterbury to raise money for the local Cancer Care Unit. In 1987, a watercolour painting Cushing painted was accepted by Prince Edward and auctioned at a charity event he organised to raise funds for The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award Scheme. Also that year, a sketch Cushing drew of Sherlock Holmes was accepted as the official logo of the Northern Musgraves Sherlock Holmes Society.

Cushing wrote two autobiographies, &quot;Peter Cushing: An Autobiography&quot; (1986) and &quot;Past Forgetting: Memoirs of the Hammer Years&quot; (1988). Cushing wrote the books as what he called &quot;a form of therapy to stop me going stark, raving mad&quot; following the loss of his wife. His old friend and co-star John Mills encouraged him to publish his memoirs as a way of overcoming the reclusive state Cushing had placed himself into following her death. In 1989 he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his contributions to the British film industry. Cushing also wrote a children&#x27;s book called &quot;The Bois Saga&quot;, a story based on the history of England. Published in 1994, it was originally written specifically for the daughter of Cushing&#x27;s long-time secretary and friend Joyce Broughton, to help her overcome reading problems resulting from her dyslexia. It was Broughton who encouraged Cushing to have the book published. His final acting job was narrating, along with Christopher Lee, the Hammer Films documentary &quot;Flesh and Blood: The Hammer Heritage of Horror&quot; (1994), which was recorded only a few weeks before his death. Produced by American writer and director Ted Newsom, his contribution was recorded in Canterbury, near his home. Lee recognised Cushing&#x27;s health was fading and did his best to keep his friend&#x27;s spirits up, but Lee later claimed he had a premonition that it would be the last time he saw Cushing alive, which proved to be true.

==Personal life==
Cushing had a variety of interests outside acting, including collecting and battling model soldiers, of which he owned over five thousand. He hand-painted many and used the &quot;Little Wars&quot; rule set by H. G. Wells for miniature wargaming. He also loved games and practical jokes, and enjoyed drawing and painting watercolours, the latter of which he did often in his later years.

After his wife&#x27;s death, Cushing visited several churches and spoke to religious ministers, but was dissatisfied by their reluctance to discuss death and the afterlife, and never joined an organized religion. He nevertheless maintained a belief in both God and an afterlife. He was an ardent vegetarian for most of his life who served as a patron with the Vegetarian Society from 1987 until his death. He also had a great interest in ornithology and wildlife in general. He suffered from nyctophobia from early in his life, but in his later years overcame this by forcing himself to take walks outside after midnight.

Cushing was known among his colleagues for his gentle and gentlemanly demeanour, as well as his professionalism and rigorous preparation as an actor. He once said that he learned his parts &quot;from cover to cover&quot; before filming began. His co-stars and colleagues often spoke of his politeness, charm, old-fashioned manners and sense of humour. While working, he actively provided feedback and suggestions on other elements beyond his performance, such as dialogue and wardrobe. At times, this put him at odds with writers and producers; Hammer Studios producer Anthony Hinds once declared him a &quot;fusspot [and] terrible fusser about his wardrobe and everything, but never a difficult man.&quot;

Although he appeared in both television and stage productions, Cushing preferred the medium of film, which allowed his perfectionist nature to work out the best performance possible. He did not enjoy the repetitive nature of stage performances, and once compared it to a painter being forced to paint the same picture every day. Cushing himself was not a particular fan of horror or science fiction films, but he tended to choose roles not based on whether he enjoyed them, but whether he felt his audience would enjoy him in them. However, Cushing was very proud of his experiences with the Hammer films, and never resented becoming known as a horror actor. He always took the roles seriously and never portrayed them in a campy or tongue-in-cheek style because he felt it would be insulting to his audience.

On 10 April 1943, Cushing married Violet Hélène Beck, sister of Reginald Beck.&lt;ref name=&quot;petercushing/helen&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Cushing&#x27;s wife died of emphysema. Cushing often said he felt his life had ended when hers did, and he was so crushed that when his first autobiography was published in 1986, it made no mention of his life after her death. In 1972, he was quoted in the &quot;Radio Times&quot; as having said, &quot;Since Helen passed on I can&#x27;t find anything; the heart, quite simply, has gone out of everything. Time is interminable, the loneliness is almost unbearable and the only thing that keeps me going is the knowledge that my dear Helen and I will be reunited again some day. To join Helen is my only ambition. You have my permission to publish that ... really, you know, dear boy, it&#x27;s all just killing time. Please say that.&quot;

In his autobiography, Cushing implies that he attempted suicide on the night of his wife&#x27;s death by running up and down stairs in the vain hope that it would induce a heart attack. He later stated that this had simply been a hysterical response borne out of grief, and that he had not purposely attempted to end his life; a poem left by Helen had implored him not to die until he had lived his life to the full.

The effects of his wife&#x27;s death proved to be as much physical as mental. For his role in &quot;Dracula A.D. 1972&quot;, Cushing (who was 58) had originally been cast as the father of Stephanie Beacham&#x27;s character, but had aged so visibly and lost so much weight that the script was hastily rewritten to make him her grandfather: it was done again in the last Dracula film from Hammer, &quot;The Satanic Rites of Dracula&quot;. In a silent tribute to Helen, a shot of Van Helsing&#x27;s desk includes a photograph of her. He repeated the role of the man who lost family in other horror films, including &quot;Asylum&quot; (1972), &quot;The Creeping Flesh&quot; (1973), and &quot;The Ghoul&quot; (1975).

==Death and legacy==
In May 1982, Cushing was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He was rushed to the Kent and Canterbury Hospital when his left eye had swollen to nearly three times its normal size, a side effect of the cancer. Doctors determined he had twelve to eighteen months to live, and that his left eye might be lost. To their surprise, however, Cushing recovered well enough to be released from the hospital, and although his health continued to gradually decline, Cushing lived another twelve years without any operative treatment or chemotherapy. During this period, he lived with Joyce Broughton and her family at their homes in Hartley, Kent. In August 1994, Cushing entered himself into Pilgrims Hospice in Canterbury, where he died on 11 August at 81 years old. In accordance with his wishes, Cushing had a low-profile funeral with family and friends, although hundreds of fans and well-wishers came to Canterbury to pay their respects. In January 1995, a memorial service was held in The Actors&#x27; Church in Covent Garden, with addresses given by Christopher Lee, Kevin Francis, Ron Moody and James Bree. 

In total, Cushing appeared in more than 100 films throughout his career.

In an interview included on the DVD release of &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; (1959), Lee said of his friend&#x27;s death: Several filmmakers and actors have claimed to be influenced by Peter Cushing, including actor Doug Bradley, who played Pinhead in the &quot;Hellraiser&quot; horror films, and John Carpenter, who directed such films as &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978), &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981) and &quot;The Thing&quot; (1982). Director Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp both said the portrayal of Ichabod Crane in &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; was intended to resemble that of Cushing&#x27;s old horror film performances.

In 2008, fourteen years after his death, Cushing&#x27;s image was used in a set of stamps issued by the Royal Mail honouring Hammer Studios films on the fiftieth anniversary of the release of &quot;Dracula&quot;. In 2013, Cushing was honoured by the Royal Mail as one of ten people selected for their &quot;Great Britons&quot; commemorative postage stamp issue.

<text>Tourism in Italy is one of the largest economic sectors of the country. With 60 million tourists per year (2023), Italy is the fourth most visited country in international tourism arrivals. According to 2018 estimates by the Bank of Italy, the tourism sector directly generates more than five per cent of the national GDP (13 per cent when also considering the indirectly generated GDP) and represents over six per cent of the employed.

People have visited Italy for centuries, yet the first to visit the peninsula for tourist reasons were aristocrats during the Grand Tour, beginning in the 17th century, and flourishing in the 18th and 19th centuries. This was a period in which European aristocrats, many of whom were British and French, visited parts of Europe, with Italy as a key destination. For Italy, this was in order to study ancient architecture, local culture and to admire the natural beauties.

Nowadays the factors of tourist interest in Italy are mainly culture, cuisine, history, fashion, architecture, art, religious sites and routes, naturalistic beauties, nightlife, underwater sites and spas. Winter and summer tourism are present in many locations in the Alps and the Apennines, while seaside tourism is widespread in coastal locations along the Mediterranean Sea. Small, historical and artistic Italian villages are promoted through the association &quot;I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia&quot; (literally &quot;The Most Beautiful Villages of Italy&quot;). Italy is among the countries most visited in the world by tourists during the Christmas holidays. Rome is the 3rd most visited city in Europe and the 12th in the world, with 9.4 million arrivals in 2017 while Milan is the 5th most visited city in Europe and the 16th in the world, with 8.81 million tourists. In addition, Venice and Florence are also among the world&#x27;s top 100 destinations. Italy is also the country with the highest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the world (60). Out of Italy&#x27;s 60 heritage sites, 54 are cultural and 6 are natural.

The Roman Empire, Middle Ages, Renaissance and the following centuries of the history of Italy have left many cultural artefacts that attract tourists. In general, the Italian cultural heritage is the largest in the world since it consists of 60 to 75 percent of all the artistic assets that exist on each continent, with over 4,000 museums, 6,000 archaeological sites, 85,000 historic churches and 40,000 historic palaces, all subject to protection by the Italian Ministry of Culture. As of 2018, the Italian places of culture (which include museums, attractions, parks, archives and libraries) amounted to . Italy is the leading cruise tourism destination in the Mediterranean Sea.

In Italy, there is a broad variety of hotels, going from 1-5 stars. According to ISTAT, in 2017, there were 32,988 hotels with 1,133,452 rooms and 2,239,446 beds. As for non-hotel facilities (campsites, tourist villages, accommodations for rent, agritourism, etc.), in 2017 their number was 171,915 with 2,798,352 beds. The tourist flow to coastal resorts is 53 percent; the best equipped cities are Grosseto for farmhouses (217), Vieste for campsites and tourist villages (84) and Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo mountain huts (20).

== History ==


===Beginnings===
People have visited Italy for centuries, yet the first to visit the peninsula for touristic reasons were aristocrats during the Grand Tour, beginning in the 17th century, and flourishing in the 18th and the 19th century.

Rome, as the capital of the Roman Empire, attracted thousands to the city and country from all over the empire, which included a great part of Europe, Western Asia and Northern Africa. Traders and merchants came to Italy from several different parts of the world.
When the empire fell in 476 AD, Rome was no longer the epicentre of European politics and culture; on the other hand, it was the base of the papacy, which then governed the growing Christian religion, meaning that Rome remained one of Europe&#x27;s major places of pilgrimage. Pilgrims, for centuries and still today, would come to the city, and that would have been the early equivalent of &quot;tourism&quot; or &quot;religious tourism&quot;. The trade empires of Venice, Pisa and Genoa meant that several traders, businessmen and merchants from all over the world would also regularly come to Italy. In the 16th and early 17th centuries, with the height of the Renaissance, several students came to Italy to study Italian architecture.

===Grand Tour===

Real &quot;tourism&quot; only affected Italy in the second half of the 17th century, with the beginning of the Grand Tour. This was a period in which European aristocrats, many of whom were British, visited parts of Europe, with Italy as a key destination. For Italy, this was in order to study ancient architecture, local culture and to admire the natural beauties. The Grand Tour was in essence triggered by the book &quot;Voyage to Italy&quot;, by Roman Catholic priest Richard Lassels, and published in 1670.
Due to the Grand Tour, tourism became even more prevalent – making Italy one of the most desired destinations for millions of people. Once inside what would be modern-day Italy, these tourists would begin by visiting Turin for a short while. On the way there, Milan was also a popular stop, yet a trip to the city was not considered essential, and several passed by or simply stayed for a short period of time. If a person came via boat, then they would remain for a few days in Genoa. Yet, the main destination in Northern Italy was Venice, which was considered a vital stop, as well as cities around it such as Verona, Vicenza and Padua.

As the Tour went on, Tuscan cities were also very important itinerary stops. Florence was a major attraction, and other Tuscan towns, such as Siena, Pisa, Lucca and San Gimignano, were also considered important destinations. The most prominent stop in Central Italy, however, was Rome, a major centre for the arts and culture, as well as an essential city for a Grand Tourist. Later, they would go down to the Bay of Naples, and after their discovery in 1710, Pompeii and Herculaneum were popular too. Sicily was considered a significant part of the trail, and several, such as Goethe, visited the island.

===Mass tourism===
Throughout the 17th to 18th centuries, the Grand Tour was mainly reserved for academics or the elite. Nevertheless, circa 1840, rail transport was introduced and the Grand Tour started to fall slightly out of vogue; hence, the first form of mass tourism was introduced. The 1840s saw the period in which the Victorian middle classes toured the country. Several Americans were also able to visit Italy, and many more tourists came to the peninsula. Places such as Venice, Florence, Rome, Naples and Sicily still remained the top attractions.

Like many other Europeans, Italians rely heavily on public transport. Italy is a relatively small country and distances are reduced.

As the century progressed, fewer cultural visits were made, and there was an increase in tourists coming for Italy&#x27;s nature and weather. The first seaside resorts, such as those on the Ligurian coast, around Venice, coastal Tuscany and Amalfi, became popular. This vogue of summer holidays heightened in the fin-de-siècle epoch, when numerous &quot;Grand Hotels&quot; were built (including places such as Sanremo, Lido di Venezia, Viareggio and Forte dei Marmi). Islands such as Capri, Ischia, Procida and Elba grew in popularity, and the Northern lakes, such as Lake Como, Maggiore and Garda were more frequently visited. Tourism to Italy remained very popular until the late-1920s and early-1930s, when, with the Great Depression and economic crisis, several could no longer afford to visit the country; the increasing political instability meant that fewer tourists came. Only old touristic groups, such as the Scorpioni, remained alive.

After a big slump in tourism beginning from approximately 1929 and lasting after World War II, Italy returned to its status as a popular resort, with the Italian economic miracle and raised living standards; films such as &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; were successful abroad, and their depiction of the country&#x27;s perceived idyllic life helped raise Italy&#x27;s international profile. By this point, with higher incomes, Italians could also afford to go on holiday; coastline resorts saw a soar in visitors, especially in Romagna. Many cheap hotels and &quot;pensioni&quot; (hostels) were built in the 1960s, and with the rise of wealth, by now, even a working-class Italian family could afford a holiday somewhere along the coast. The late 1960s also brought mass popularity to mountain holidays and skiing; in Piedmont and the Aosta Valley, numerous ski resorts and chalets started being built. The 1970s also brought a wave of foreign tourists to Italy in search of a sentimental trip, since Mediterranean destinations saw a rise in global visitors.

Despite this, by the late 1970s and early 1980s, economic crises and political instability meant that there was a significant slump in the Italian tourist industry, as destinations in the Far East or South America rose in popularity. Yet, by the late-1980s and early-1990s, tourism saw a return to popularity, with cities such as Milan becoming more popular destinations. Milan saw a rise in tourists since it was ripening its position as a worldwide fashion capital.

== Overtourism ==
Several popular tourism destinations in Italy – including Venice, the Vatican City, and the Cinque Terre – have reported issues with overtourism.

In particular, Venice&#x27;s overtourism problem has received widespread media coverage. The causes of overtourism in Venice are numerous but the main factors include the volume of cruise ship passengers, excessive day trip visitors – which far outnumber residents and overnight guests – and an increase in peer to peer home-sharing platforms which are squeezing local people out of the housing market.

In 2023, less than 50,000 residents lived in Venice&#x27;s Centro Storico. In the 1970s it is reported the old city centre housed 175,000 residents. On busy days, day trippers can number up to 85,000 per day.

A total of 30% of available residential apartments are occupied by tourist rentals.  

Since 2021, large cruise ships have been banned from entering the historic centre after UNESCO threatened to put Venice on its endangered list as a result of damage to the lagoon. In 2024, Venice authorities introduced an entry fee for day trippers on peak days between April and June to deter visitors; however, in late 2024 it was reported that this was not successful in reducing numbers.

== Land and climate ==
=== Geography ===
Italy is located in southern Europe and it is also considered a part of western Europe, between latitudes 35° and 47° N, and longitudes 6° and 19° E. To the north, Italy borders Switzerland, France, Austria and Slovenia and is roughly delimited by the Alpine watershed, enclosing the Po Valley and the Venetian Plain. To the south, it consists of the entirety of the Italian Peninsula crossed by the Apennines and the two Mediterranean islands of Sicily and Sardinia, in addition to many smaller islands. The sovereign states of San Marino and the Vatican City are enclaves within Italy, while Campione d&#x27;Italia is an Italian exclave in Switzerland.

Italy is part of the Northern Hemisphere. The country&#x27;s total area is , of which is land and is water. Including islands, Italy has a coastline of on the Adriatic Sea, Ionian Sea, Tyrrhenian Sea, Ligurian Sea, Sea of Sardinia and Strait of Sicily, and borders shared with France (), Austria (), Slovenia () and Switzerland (). San Marino () and Vatican City (), both enclaves, account for the remainder.

=== Climate ===
The climate of Italy is influenced by the large body of water of the Mediterranean Sea that surrounds Italy on every side except the north. These seas constitute a reservoir of heat and humidity for Italy. Within the southern temperate zone, they determine a particular climate called Mediterranean climate with local differences due to the geomorphology of the territory, which tends to make its mitigating effects felt, especially in high pressure conditions.

Because of the length of the peninsula and the mostly mountainous hinterland, the climate of Italy is highly diverse. The inland northern areas of Italy (for example Turin, Milan, and Bologna) have a relatively cool, mid-latitude version of the Humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), while the coastal areas of Liguria and the peninsula south of Florence generally fit the Mediterranean climate profile (Köppen climate classification Csa).

Conditions on the coast are different from those in the interior, particularly during winter months when the higher altitudes tend to be cold, wet, and often snowy. The coastal regions have mild winters and warm and generally dry summers, although lowland valleys can be quite hot in summer. Between the north and south there can be a considerable difference in temperature, above all during the winter: on some winter days it can be and snowing in Milan, while it is in Rome and in Palermo. Temperature differences are less extreme in the summer.

== Transport ==

Transport infrastructure in Italy is well developed. Italy&#x27;s paved road network is widespread, with a total length of about . It comprises both an extensive motorway network (), called &quot;autostrade&quot;, mostly toll roads, and national and local roads. The Strade Statali is the Italian national network of state highways. The total length for this network is about . Strade Regionali (&quot;regional roads&quot;) are a type of Italian road maintained by the regions they traverse. A regional road is less important than a state highway, but more important than a Strada Provinciale (&quot;provincial road&quot;). A provincial road is more important than a Strada Comunale (&quot;municipal road&quot;).

The national railway network is also extensive, especially in the north, totalizing 16,862 km of which 69% are electrified and on which 4,937 locomotives and railcars circulate. It is the 12th largest in the world, and is operated by state-owned Ferrovie dello Stato, while the rail tracks and infrastructure are managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana. While a number of private railroads exist and provide mostly commuter-type services, the national railway also provides sophisticated high-speed rail service that joins the major cities.

Italy is the fifth in Europe by number of passengers by air transport, with about 148 million passengers or about 10% of the European total in 2011. There are approximately 130 airports in Italy, of which 99 have paved runways (including the two hubs of Leonardo Da Vinci International in Rome and Malpensa International in Milan).

In 2004 there were 43 major seaports including the Port of Genoa, the country&#x27;s largest and the third busiest by cargo tonnage in the Mediterranean Sea. Due to the increasing importance of the maritime Silk Road with its connections to Asia and East Africa, the Italian ports for Central and Eastern Europe have become important in recent years. In particular, the deep water port of Trieste in the northernmost part of the Mediterranean Sea is the target of Italian, Asian and European investments. The national inland waterway network comprises of navigable rivers and channels. In the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto, commuter ferry boats operate on Lake Garda and Lake Como to connect towns and villages at both sides of the lakes.

Seven Italian cities have metro systems:
== Tourist flows ==

The peaks of tourist flows in Italy are recorded in winter, due to the Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Day holidays, in spring, due to the Easter holidays, and in summer, due to the favourable climate.

For internal tourism, peaks of tourist flows are also recorded on the occasion of the three national civil holidays, the &quot;Festa della liberazione&quot; (25 April), the &quot;Festa dei lavoratori&quot; (1 May) and the &quot;Festa della Repubblica&quot; (2 June), as well as for three religious holidays, the &quot;Ferragosto&quot; (15 August), the &quot;Ognissanti&quot; (1 November) and the &quot;Festa dell&#x27;Immacolata Concezione&quot; (8 December).

==Factors of tourist interest==
There are many factors that drive tourism interest to Italy.

===Artistic-cultural tourism===


Italy is considered one of the birthplaces of western civilization and a cultural superpower. Divided by politics and geography for centuries until its eventual unification in 1861, Italy&#x27;s culture has been shaped by a multitude of regional customs and local centres of power and patronage. Italy has had a central role in Western culture for centuries and is still recognised for its cultural traditions and artists. During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, a number of courts competed to attract architects, artists and scholars, thus producing a legacy of monuments, paintings, music and literature. Despite the political and social isolation of these courts, Italy has made a substantial contribution to the cultural and historical heritage of Europe. The country has had a broad cultural influence worldwide, also because numerous Italians emigrated to other places during the Italian diaspora.

The country boasts several world-famous cities. Rome was the ancient capital of the Roman Empire, the seat of the Pope of the Catholic Church, the capital of reunified Italy and the artistic, cultural and cinematographic centre of world relevance. Florence was the heart of the Renaissance, a period of great achievements in the arts at the end of the Middle Ages. Other important cities include Turin, which used to be the capital of Italy and is now one of the world&#x27;s great centres of automobile engineering. Milan is the industrial and financial capital of Italy and one of the world&#x27;s fashion capitals. Venice, the former capital of a major financial and maritime power from the Middle Ages to the early modern period, with its intricate canal system attracts tourists from all over the world, especially during the Venetian Carnival and the Biennale. Naples, with the largest historic city centre in Europe and the oldest continuously active public opera house in the world (Teatro di San Carlo). Bologna is the main transport hub of the country, as well as the home of the oldest university in the world and of a worldwide famous cuisine.

Italian art has influenced several major movements throughout the centuries and has produced several great artists, including painters, architects and sculptors. Italy has a vast and important historical heritage, both in terms of the number of artefacts, as well as in terms of conservation, and in terms of intrinsic artistic-cultural value. For example, Italy boasts the largest number of sites indicated in the UNESCO World Heritage List. In general, the Italian cultural heritage is the largest in the world since it consists of 60% to 75% of all the artistic assets that exist on each continent, with over 4,000 museums, 6,000 archaeological sites, 85,000 historic churches and 40,000 historic palaces, all subject to protection by the Italian Ministry of Culture.

In 2013, the value of the artistic and cultural heritage alone was estimated at 5.4% of Italian GDP, approximately €75.5 billion, capable of employing approximately 1.4 million workers. According to the Eurostat report of 2019, Italian tourism is first in Europe in terms of the number of jobs generated (4.2 million) and third for the average visitor expenditure and the share of revenues of the national sector compared to the European total (€48 billion, 12% of the total).

There are numerous technology parks in Italy such as the Science and Technology Parks Kilometro Rosso (Bergamo), the AREA Science Park (Trieste), The VEGA-Venice Gateway for Science and Technology (Venezia), the Toscana Life Sciences (Siena), the Technology Park of Lodi Cluster (Lodi), and the Technology Park of Navacchio (Pisa), as well as science museums such as the Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci in Milan, the Natural History Museum in Milan, the Città della Scienza in Naples and the Institute and Museum of the History of Science in Florence.

===Seaside tourism===

Italian seaseaports most frequented by cruise passengers who sail the Mediterranean Sea are Civitavecchia, Genoa, Palermo, Bari, Naples, Savona, Trieste, Monfalcone, Taranto and La Spezia.

===Lake tourism===


There are more than 1000 lakes in Italy, the largest of which is Garda (). Other well-known subalpine lakes are Lake Maggiore (), whose most northerly section is part of Switzerland, Como (), one of the deepest lakes in Europe, Orta, Lugano, Iseo, and Idro. Other notable lakes in the Italian peninsula are Trasimeno, Bolsena, Bracciano, Vico, Varano and Lesina in Gargano and Omodeo in Sardinia.

Many Italian lakes are dotted with various accommodation facilities, such as hotels, restaurants and resorts, agritourism, parks, piers and marinas, as well as numerous historic and artistic centres. On the Italian lakes, it is possible to go windsurfing, canoeing and sailing, fishing and scuba diving, while in their surroundings it is possible to go hiking, either on foot or by bicycle. Lakeside noteworthy locations include Mergozzo, Cannero Riviera, Cannobio, Avigliana, Orta San Giulio, Torno, Bellano, Menaggio, Castellaro Lagusello, Tignale, Malcesine, Gardone Riviera, Molveno, Tenno, Ledro, Panicale, Bolsena, Nemi, Trevignano Romano, Civitella Alfedena and Gavoi.

Also on Lake Orta there is a navigation service, thanks to which it is possible to visit the San Giulio Island.

International lake tourism in Italy has been able to establish due to the sounding board created by some celebrities of the international jet set, well known by the general public. The purchase of a holiday residence along Lake Como by actor George Clooney was very publicized in 2001, as well as the marriage of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes in 2006 in the Castello Orsini-Odescalchi, along Lake Bracciano.

===Mountain tourism===

In Italy, there is both winter and summer mountain tourism. Despite a not particularly harsh climate compared to other countries located at more northern latitudes, Italy manages to attract tourists who practice winter sports due to the presence of numerous mountain ranges (the percentage of mountainous territory is around 35%).

Among these are the Alps, the highest mountain range in Europe, and the Apennines, equipped with numerous winter sports and accommodation facilities. In the north the most famous ski resorts are in Sestriere, Livigno, Bormio, Ponte di Legno, in the Dolomites (especially Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo), as well as in the Aosta Valley (especially Breuil-Cervinia), while in the center-south Abruzzo is the mountainous region with major ski resorts in Roccaraso, Ovindoli, Pescasseroli and Campo Felice. These resort usually offer to turists, among others, a package known as &quot;Settimana bianca&quot; (&#x27;white week&#x27;), a week-long retreat during the winter season.

As for mountain summer tourism, noteworthy locations includes Courmayeur, Val di Fassa, Abetone and Ceresole Reale. During the summer, in the Italian mountains, there are itineraries and paths, both on foot and by bicycle, where it is possible to admire naturalistic beauties, historic and artistic centres, glaciers, lakes, as well as practice numerous sports activities such as mountaineering, paragliding, rafting and hang gliding. In the Italian mountains there are a large number of agritourism locations, &quot;baite&quot; and resorts, as well as hotels and restaurants.

The volcanism of Italy is due chiefly to the presence, a short distance to the south, of the boundary between the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate. Italy is a volcanically active country, containing the only active volcanoes in mainland Europe (while volcanic islands are also present in Greece, in the volcanic arc of the southern Aegean). The active Italian volcanoes that attract tourists are Etna, Vesuvius and Stromboli, while the extinct Italian volcanoes that are most visited by tourists are Monte Vulture, Monte Amiata and Alban Hills.

===Hill tourism===

Italy has a predominantly hilly territory (equal to 41.6% of the total area). The best known Italian hilly areas in the world are Langhe, Montferrat, Brianza, Berici Hills, Euganean Hills, Chianti, Colline Metallifere, Alban Hills, Gargano and Murge, while notable locations include Erice, Civita di Bagnoregio, Maratea, Ravello, Urbino, Brisighella, Cortona, Asolo, Ostuni and Cervo. The attraction of tourists to the Italian hills is mainly due to the mild climate, natural beauty and landscape, and historic and artistic centres, with agritourism, resorts, hotels and restaurants that are widespread in these territories.

Vineyard Landscape of Piedmont: Langhe-Roero and Monferrato is a UNESCO World Heritage Site comprising &quot;five distinct wine-growing areas with outstanding landscapes&quot; plus the Castle of Grinzane Cavour in the region of Piedmont, Italy. The site, which extends over hilly areas of Langhe and Montferrat, is one of the most important wine producing zones in Italy. Located in the centre of the Piedmont region (North-West of Italy), the site is inscribed as a &quot;cultural landscape&quot;, since it is a result of the combined work of nature and man. The site is inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List thanks to the outstanding value of its wine culture, which has shaped the landscape over the centuries. These sites are the result of a coexisting process between humans and the environment. As a result of its heartfelt attitude to the environment, this wine region has preserved an incredible cultural heritage that has become a model for other wine districts throughout the world.

===River and canal tourism ===
Italian rivers and canals attract tourists, who can travel along them both in their navigable sections with houseboats and ships, and in non-navigable sections thanks to the use of canoes and kayaks. Along the Italian rivers there are naturalistic beauties, villages and cities, historical monuments and pilgrimage routes. Some Italian rivers such as the Ticino, the Orba, the Dora Baltea and the Elvo stream are frequented by tourists who try their hand as amateur gold prospectors, given the presence in the form of specks of this metal in the waters of these waterways.

The most important Italian river that can be navigated is the Po, which with its in length is the longest river in Italy and which is navigable from Turin to the mouth. Along the Po there are 12 ports, 111 berths (3 in Piedmont, 39 in Lombardy, 36 in Emilia-Romagna, 33 in Veneto) and about 20 river operators who provide boat rental services and organize excursions and river cruises. Noteworthy is its delta mouth, which is one of the largest wetlands in Europe and the Mediterranean area, and which is rich in naturalistic beauties. From the river Po it is possible to reach, directly or indirectly by sailing along its tributaries, the cities of Cremona, Mantua, Parma, Padua and Verona.

The Brenta river is navigable from Padua to Venice, where it has its mouth. Another noteworthy Italian river is the Sile, which is navigable from Treviso to the mouth, which is located near Jesolo. Also important is the network of rivers and artificial canals are present between Friuli-Venezia Giulia and the Venetian Lagoon, which is formed by of navigable canals. Also noteworthy is the Padana waterway, which connects Mantua to the sea via the Mincio river and the Po.

As far as the navigable canals are concerned, worthy of note is the touristic navigation service of the Lombard Navigli, which is an urban transport network in the Milan area integrated by some lines of boats along these canals. The tourist lines connect the dock of Milan with numerous &quot;comuni&quot; that rise along the Naviglio Grande up to Abbiategrasso and Turbigo. Tourist navigation is also present along the Naviglio Martesana, in the stretch from Trezzo sull&#x27;Adda to Vaprio d&#x27;Adda.

===Underwater tourism===
The Marine Protected Areas of Italy restrict human activity for a conservation purpose, to protect natural resources or archaeological sites. There were twenty-seven such marine protected areas, and a further two &quot;Submerged Archaeological Parks&quot; (Italian: &quot;parchi sommersi&quot;); in 2018, two new marine protected areas were created. these areas help safeguard in total some of the seas around Italy as well as some of its coastline, corresponding to 12% of the Italian coasts.

Underwater tourism, both of a naturalistic type and linked to underwater archaeology, is also present. For the naturalistic underwater type, noteworthy seaside locations include the Portofino Marine Protected Area (located between the municipalities of Camogli, Portofino and Santa Margherita Ligure), the island of Giglio, the island of Capraia, and the Maddalena archipelago.

For the underwater archeology type, noteworthy seaside locations include Taormina, Capo Passero, Ustica, Noto, Marettimo, Marzamemi, Santa Maria di Castellabate, Baiae, Gaiola, Ischia, Campi Flegrei, Pantelleria, Syracuse, Gnatia, Tremiti Islands, Manduria and Isola di Capo Rizzuto.

===Food and wine tourism===

Italian cuisine is one of the best known and most appreciated gastronomies worldwide. Italian cuisine includes deeply rooted traditions common to the whole country, as well as all the regional gastronomies, different from each other, especially between the north and the south of Italy, which is in continuous exchange. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated with variations throughout the country. Italian cuisine offers an abundance of taste, and is one of the most popular and copied around the world. Italy is the world&#x27;s largest producer of wine, as well as the country with the widest variety of indigenous grapevine varieties in the world.

One of the main characteristics of Italian cuisine is its simplicity, with many dishes made up of few ingredients, and therefore Italian cooks often rely on the quality of the ingredients, rather than the complexity of preparation. The most popular dishes and recipes, over the centuries, have often been created by ordinary people more so than by chefs, which is why many Italian recipes are suitable for home and daily cooking, respecting regional specificities, privileging only raw materials and ingredients from the region of origin of the dish and preserving its seasonality.

Italian meal structure is typical of the European Mediterranean region and differs from North, Central, and Eastern European meal structure, though it still often consists of breakfast (&quot;colazione&quot;), lunch (&quot;pranzo&quot;), and supper (&quot;cena&quot;). However, much less emphasis is placed on breakfast, and breakfast itself is often skipped or involves lighter meal portions than are seen in non-Mediterranean Western countries. Late-morning and mid-afternoon snacks, called &quot;merenda&quot; (plural &quot;merende&quot;), are also often included in this meal structure.

The Mediterranean diet forms the basis of Italian cuisine, rich in pasta, fish, fruits and vegetables. Cheese, cold cuts and wine are central to Italian cuisine, and along with pizza and coffee (especially espresso) form part of Italian gastronomic culture. Desserts have a long tradition of merging local flavours such as citrus fruits, pistachio and almonds with sweet cheeses like mascarpone and ricotta or exotic tastes as cocoa, vanilla and cinnamon. Gelato, tiramisù and cassata are among the most famous examples of Italian desserts, cakes and patisserie.

Italian cuisine relies heavily on traditional products; the country has a large number of traditional specialities protected under EU law. From the 1950s onwards, a great variety of typical products of Italian cuisine have been recognized as PDO, PGI, TSG and GI by the Council of the European Union, to which they are added to the &quot;Indicazione geografica tipica&quot; (IGT), the regional (PAT) and the municipal &quot;Denominazione comunale d&#x27;origine&quot; (De.C.O.). In the oenological field, there are specific legal protections: the &quot;Denominazione di origine controllata&quot; (DOC) and the &quot;Denominazione di origine controllata e garantita&quot; (DOCG). Protected designation of origin (PDO) and Protected Geographical Indications (PGI) have also been established in olive growing.

Milan is home to the oldest restaurant in Italy and the second in Europe, the Antica trattoria Bagutto, which has existed since at least 1284. The cuisine is therefore often a reason for tourism in the peninsula, perhaps combined with one or more reasons previously described. There are countless food festivals and fairs spread throughout the area, from small agricultural centres to large metropolises. The hospitality sector is slowly updating by including cultural food and wine elements in its offer to tourists, both in traditional hotels and in specially created structures such as agritourisms. In 2018 the food and wine expenditure by foreign tourists amounted to 9.23 billion euros, with an average expenditure of 117 euros each.

===Sports tourism===

Sport in Italy has a long tradition. In several sports, both individual and team, Italy has good representation and many successes. Football is the most popular sport in Italy. Italy has won four FIFA World Cups championship (1934, 1938, 1982 and 2006), and is (along with Germany) currently the second most successful football team in World Cup history, after Brazil. Basketball, volleyball, and cycling are the next most popular/played sports, with Italy having a rich tradition in all three. Italy also has strong traditions in swimming, water polo, rugby union, tennis, athletics, fencing, and Formula One.

Tourism linked to sporting events is capable of attracting fans of various disciplines who, in several cases, then decide to stay to visit the country. In addition to events of a global nature, capable of attracting a large number of visitors for a longer period of time (among the major ones the 1960 Summer Olympics, the 2006 Winter Olympics and the 1990 FIFA World Cup), minor events also contribute to the development of this factor of tourism, such as individual international matches of various sports (for example the home matches of Italy during the Six Nations Championship or the matches of clubs of various sports involved in continental competitions) or tournaments of more local importance.

The Serie A is a professional league competition for football clubs located at the top of the Italian football league system and the winner is awarded the Scudetto and the Coppa Campioni d&#x27;Italia. Serie A is regarded as one of the best football leagues in the world and it is often depicted as the most tactical and defensively sound national league. Serie A was the world&#x27;s strongest national league in 2020 according to IFFHS, and is ranked third among European leagues according to UEFA&#x27;s league coefficient, behind La Liga and the Premier League and ahead of the Bundesliga and Ligue 1, which is based on the performance of Italian clubs in the Champions League and the Europa League during the previous five years. Serie A led the UEFA ranking from 1986 to 1988 and from 1990 to 1999.

The Italian Grand Prix is the fifth oldest national Grand Prix (after the French Grand Prix, the American Grand Prize, the Spanish Grand Prix and the Russian Grand Prix), having been held since 1921. In 2013 it became the most-held Grand Prix (the 2021 edition was the 91st). It is one of the two Grands Prix (along with the British) which has run as an event of the Formula One World Championship Grands Prix every season, continuously since the championship was introduced in 1950. Every Formula One Italian Grand Prix in the World Championship era has been held at Monza except in 1980, when it was held at Imola.

The Giro d&#x27;Italia is an annual multiple-stage bicycle race primarily held in Italy, while also starting in, or passing through, other countries. The first race was organized in 1909 to increase sales of the newspaper &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot;; and is still run by a subsidiary of that paper&#x27;s owner. The Giro is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI WorldTeams, with some additional teams invited as &#x27;wild cards&#x27;. Starting in 1909, the Giro d&#x27;Italia is the Grands Tours&#x27; second oldest.

The Mille Miglia was an open-road, motorsport endurance race established in 1927 by the young Counts Francesco Mazzotti and Aymo Maggi, which took place in Italy twenty-four times from 1927 to 1957 (thirteen before World War II, eleven from 1947). From 1953 until 1957, the Mille Miglia was also a round of the World Sports Car Championship. Since 1977, the &quot;Mille Miglia&quot; has been reborn as a regularity race for classic and vintage cars. Participation is limited to cars, produced no later than 1957, which had attended (or were registered to) the original race. The route (Brescia–Rome round trip) is similar to that of the original race, maintaining the point of departure/arrival in Viale Venezia in Brescia.

Traditional sports also attract tourists in Italy, such as the Palio, the name given in the country to an annual athletic contest, very often of a historical character, pitting the neighbourhoods of a town or the hamlets of a &quot;comune&quot; against each other. Typically, they are fought in costume and commemorate some event or tradition of the Middle Ages and thus often involve horse racing, archery, jousting, crossbow shooting, and similar medieval sports. The Palio di Siena is the only one that has been run without interruption since it started in the 1630s and is definitely the most famous all over the world, attracting tourists from every continent.

Another traditional Italian sport that attracts tourists is the Calcio Fiorentino (also referred to as &quot;calcio storico&quot;, &quot;historic football&quot;), an early form of football (soccer and rugby) that originated during the Middle Ages and is still played annually today in the Piazza Santa Croce in Florence.

===Historical and artistic villages tourism===

The historical and artistic Italian villages are attracting an increasing number of tourists. A non-profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest named &quot;I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia&quot; () and affiliated to the international association The Most Beautiful Villages in the World, was created in 2001 on the initiative of the Tourism Council of the National Association of Italian Municipalities with the aim of preserving and maintaining villages of quality heritage. Founded to contribute to safeguarding, conserving and revitalizing small villages and municipalities, but sometimes even individual hamlets, which, being outside the main tourist circuits, they risk, despite their great value, being forgotten with consequent degradation, depopulation and abandonment. Its motto is (&quot;The charm of hidden Italy&quot;).

As of November 2023, 361 villages in Italy have been listed in &quot;The Most Beautiful Villages of Italy&quot;. This association organizes initiatives within the villages, such as festivals, exhibitions, fetes, conferences and concerts that highlight the cultural, historical, gastronomic and linguistic heritage, involving residents, schools, and local artists. The club promotes numerous initiatives on the international market. In 2016, the association signed a global agreement with ENIT, to promote tourism in the most beautiful villages in the world. In 2017, the club signed an agreement with Costa Cruises for the enhancement of some villages, which are offered to cruise passengers arriving in Italian ports aboard the operator&#x27;s ships.

The &quot;Bandiera arancione&quot; is a tourist-environmental quality recognition conferred by the Touring Club Italiano (TCI) to small towns in the Italian hinterland (maximum 15,000 inhabitants) which stand out for their quality hospitality. The idea was born in 1998 in Sassello (in Liguria), from the need of the regional body to promote and enhance the hinterland. The TCI, therefore, developed an analysis model (called territorial analysis model or MAT) to identify the first deserving localities. Subsequently, the recognition was promoted on a national scale, identifying small places of excellence in each region. The group, as of June 2021, includes 252 villages. The project is the only Italian one included by the World Tourism Organization among the programs successfully implemented for the sustainable development of tourism worldwide.

===Tourist railways===

In Italy the heritage railway institute is recognized and protected by law no. 128 of 9 August 2017, which has as its objective the protection and valorisation of disused, suspended or abolished railway lines, of particular cultural, landscape and tourist value, including both railway routes and stations and the related works of art and appurtenances, on which, upon proposal of the regions to which they belong, tourism-type traffic management is applied (art. 2, paragraph 1). At the same time, the law identified a first list of 18 tourist railways, considered to be of particular value (art. 2, paragraph 2).

The list is periodically updated by decree of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport, in agreement with the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Ministry of Culture, also taking into account the reports in the State-Regions Conference, a list which in 2022 reached 26 railway lines. According to article 1, law 128/2017 has as its purpose: &quot;the protection and valorisation of railway sections of particular cultural, landscape and tourist value, which include railway routes, stations and related works of art and appurtenances, and of the historic and tourist rolling stock authorized to travel along them, as well as the regulation of the use of ferrocycles&quot;.

In July 2023, Ferrovie dello Stato established a new company, the &quot;FS Treni Turistici Italiani&quot; (English: FS Italian Tourist Trains), with the mission &quot;to propose an offer of railway services expressly designed and calibrated for quality, sustainable tourism and attentive to rediscovering the riches of the Italian territory. Tourism that can experience the train journey as an integral moment of the holiday, an element of quality in the overall tourist experience&quot;. There are three service areas proposed: &quot;Luxury trains&quot;, &quot;Express and historic trains&quot;, and &quot;Regional trains&quot;.

The nightlife in Italy is attractive to both tourists and locals. Italy is known to have some of the best nightlife in the world. The best known Italian destinations for nightlife are:

===LGBT tourism===
Italy represented one of the main homosexual male tourist destinations between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. In fact, in Italy there were no anti-homosexual laws, which were widespread in the countries of Northern Europe, such as the German paragraph 175 or the sentences suffered by Oscar Wilde in the United Kingdom. Places such as Capri, Taormina, Florence, Venice, Rome and Naples were the favourite places of homosexual tourism of the time.

This type of tourism disappeared in Italy in the 1950s due to changed political and social conditions, which favoured other types of tourism, such as &quot;family&quot; tourism.

This phenomenon has led to an important flow of tourists of Italian origin who visit the country and discover their roots.

In 2018, about 10 million tourists of Italian origin went to the country to rediscover their roots.

==Vacation in Italy in ancient times==

It was the ancient Romans who invented the concept of &quot;vacation&quot;. The vacation was the prerogative of the patricians, the wealthiest social caste, who owned villas outside Rome, mainly in the &quot;Latium&quot; hinterland and on the Tyrrhenian coast. The most popular place in Roman Italy to vacation was Naples, an important cultural centre and a place that attracted artists, philosophers and scholars of the time.

The ancient Romans also visited Italy to learn about their origins, especially in regards to the history, ancient legends and myths related to the founding of Rome. Among the most popular destinations for this type of vacation were the Circeo, where the jug was kept which, according to tradition, had been used by Odysseus during his stay with the sorceress Circe. Another destination was a visit to the ship with which, according to tradition, Aeneas, a hero destined by fate to the founding of Rome, had arrived on the shores of &quot;Latium&quot;.

At the height of the imperial era, the city of Rome became a destination for aristocrats from all over the Roman province who visited the capital to admire its most important monuments such as the Colosseum, the Ara Pacis, the Pantheon and the Trajan&#x27;s Column. However, the vacation resorts were numerous, from the lakes of Northern Italy to Sicily. The most visited by the ancient Romans were the Phlegraean Fields, Pozzuoli, the hill of Posillipo, Baiae, Cape Miseno and the island of Capri.

In particular, in Baiae, which was characterized by a favourable climate all year round, there were natural springs of sulphurous hot water with healing properties. The city then became a famous seaside resort, embellished by the presence of spas and luxurious villas. Here Julius Caesar, Pompey, Marcus Licinius Crassus, Cicero, Seneca the Younger, Caligula and Nero owned a villa for vacationing. Other important vacation localities of the ancient Romans were Pompeii and Herculaneum, which were destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.

=== Venice ===


Venice is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region. It is built on a group of 118 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by over 400 bridges. The islands are in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay lying between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers (more exactly between the Brenta and the Sile). In 2020, 258,685 people resided in the Comune di Venezia, of whom around 55,000 live in the historical city of Venice (&quot;centro storico&quot;). Together with Padua and Treviso, the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE), which is considered a statistical metropolitan area, with a total population of 2.6 million.

The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC. The city was historically the capital of the Republic of Venice for over a millennium, from 697 to 1797. It was a major financial and maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto, as well as an important centre of commerce—especially silk, grain, and spice, and of art from the 13th century to the end of the 17th. The city-state of Venice is considered to have been the first real international financial centre, emerging in the 9th century and reaching its greatest prominence in the 14th century. This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history. After the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna, the Republic was annexed by the Austrian Empire, until it became part of the Kingdom of Italy in 1866, following a referendum held as a result of the Third Italian War of Independence.

Venice has been known as &quot;La Dominante&quot;, &quot;La Serenissima&quot;, &quot;Queen of the Adriatic&quot;, &quot;City of Water&quot;, &quot;City of Masks&quot;, &quot;City of Bridges&quot;, &quot;The Floating City&quot;, and &quot;City of Canals&quot;.

Venice is known for several important artistic movements—especially during the Renaissance period—and has played an important role in the history of instrumental and operatic music, and is the birthplace of Baroque composers Tomaso Albinoni and Antonio Vivaldi.

Although the city is facing some challenges (including an excessive number of tourists and problems caused by pollution, tide peaks and cruise ships sailing too close to buildings), Venice remains a very popular tourist destination, a major cultural centre, and has been ranked many times the most beautiful city in the world. It has been described by the &quot;Times Online&quot; as one of Europe&#x27;s most romantic cities and by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;undoubtedly the most beautiful city built by man&quot;.

The total contribution of travel and tourism represents 9.7% of GDP and supports 2.9 million jobs (10.9% of employment) in the country. Tourism contributes significantly to the balance of payments.

France was visited by 100 million foreign tourists in 2023, making it the most visited country in the world.

France has 45 sites inscribed in the UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage List and features cities or sites of high cultural interest (Paris being the foremost, but also Loire Valley, Toulouse, Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Lyon and others), beaches and seaside resorts, ski resorts, as well as rural regions that many enjoy for their beauty and tranquility (green tourism). Small and picturesque French villages of quality heritage (such as Collonges-la-Rouge, Locronan, or Montsoreau) are promoted through the association &quot;Les Plus Beaux Villages de France&quot; (literally &quot;The Most Beautiful Villages of France&quot;). The &quot;Remarkable Gardens&quot; label is a list of the over two hundred gardens classified by the Ministry of Culture. This label is intended to protect and promote remarkable gardens and parks.

=== Paris ===

Paris, the capital city of France, is the third most visited city in the world.

It has some of the world&#x27;s largest and renowned museums, including the Louvre, which is the most visited art museum in the world, but also the Musée d&#x27;Orsay which, like the nearby Musée de l&#x27;Orangerie, is mostly devoted to impressionism, and Centre Georges Pompidou, dedicated to Contemporary art.

Paris hosts some of the world&#x27;s most recognizable landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, which is the most-visited paid monument in the world, the Arc de Triomphe, the cathedral of Notre-Dame, or the Sacré-Cœur on Montmartre. The Cité des Sciences et de l&#x27;Industrie, located in Parc de la Villette, is the biggest science museum in Europe. Near Paris are located the Palace of Versailles, the former palace of the Kings of France, now a museum, and the medieval village of Provins. Both attractions are protected as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

=== French Riviera ===
With more than 10 million tourists a year, the French Riviera (French: &quot;Côte d&#x27;Azur&quot;), in Southeastern France, is the second leading tourist destination in the country, after the Parisian region.

According to the Côte d&#x27;Azur Economic Development Agency, it benefits from 300 days of sunshine per year, of coastline and beaches, 18 golf courses and 3,000 restaurants. Each year the &quot;Côte d&#x27;Azur&quot; hosts 50% of the world&#x27;s superyacht fleet, with 90% of all superyachts visiting the region&#x27;s coast at least once in their lifetime.

Main cities on the French Riviera include Nice, Antibes and Cannes; Cap Ferrat is also a popular destination. Cannes hosts the annual Cannes Film Festival. Tourists often visit Port-Cros National Park, east of Toulon, as well as the city-state of Monaco, famous for its Monte Carlo Casino, near the Italian border.

=== Provence ===
A large part of Provence, with Marseille as its leading city, was designed as the 2013 European Capital of Culture. Numerous famous natural sites can be found in the region, as the Gorges du Verdon, the Camargue, the Calanques National Park and the typical landscape of Luberon. Provence hosts dozens of renowned historical sites like the Pont du Gard, the Arles&#x27; Roman Monuments or the Palais des Papes in Avignon. Several smaller cities also attracts a lot of tourists, like Aix-en-Provence, La Ciotat or Cassis, on the Mediterranean Sea coastline.

=== Loire Valley ===
Another major destination are the &quot;Châteaux&quot; (castles) of the Loire Valley. The French Revolution saw a number of the great French châteaux destroyed and many ransacked, their treasures stolen. The overnight impoverishment of many of the deposed nobility, usually after one of its members lost his or her head to the guillotine, saw many châteaux demolished.

During World War I and World War II, some chateaux were commandeered as military headquarters. Some of these continued to be used this way after the end of the Second World War.

This World Heritage Site is noteworthy for the quality of its architectural heritage, in its historic towns such as Amboise, Angers, Blois, Chinon, Orléans, and Saumur, but in particular for its castles, such as the Châteaux d&#x27;Amboise, de Chambord, d&#x27;Ussé, de Villandry, de Chenonceau and de Montsoreau, which illustrate to an exceptional degree the ideals of the French Renaissance.

=== French Alps ===
The French Alps are the portions of the Alps mountain range that stand within France, located in the Rhône-Alpes and Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur regions. While some of the ranges of the French Alps are entirely in France, others, such as the Mont Blanc massif, are shared with Switzerland and Italy.

More than 20 skiing resorts make it a popular destination among Europeans in the winter.

=== Corsica ===
Corsica is the fourth largest island in the Mediterranean Sea after Sicily, Sardinia and Cyprus. It is a popular attraction for tourists with both cultural aspects (with its main cities Ajaccio and Bastia and smaller towns like Porto-Vecchio and Sartène) and geographical features (Parc naturel régional de Corse).

The Calanques de Piana and Scandola Nature Reserve are listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The island is long at longest, wide at widest, has of coastline, more than 200 beaches, and is very mountainous, with Monte Cinto as the highest peak at and around 120 other summits of more than .

Mountains comprise two-thirds of the island, forming a single chain. Forests make up 20% of the island.

=== Villages ===

&quot;Les Plus Beaux Villages de France&quot; (English: &quot;The most beautiful villages of France&quot;) is an independent association, created in 1982, that aims to promote small and picturesque French villages of quality heritage. As of 2008, 152 villages in France have been labelled as the &quot;Plus Beaux Villages de France&quot;.

There are a few criteria before entering the association: the population of the village must not exceed 2,000 inhabitants, there must be at least two protected areas (picturesque or legendary sites, or sites of scientific, artistic or historic interest), and the decision to apply must be taken by the municipal council.

<text>Tourism in Greece has been a key element of the economic activity in the country, and is one of the country&#x27;s most important sectors. Greece has been a major tourist destination and attraction in Europe since the 1970s for its rich culture and history, which is reflected in large part by its 19 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, among the most in Europe and the world as well as for its long coastline, many islands, and beaches.

Greece attracted as many as 33 million visitors in 2023 making it the 10th most visited country in the world.

Greece is one of Europe&#x27;s most popular LGBT tourist destinations. The religious tourism and pilgrimages, the ecotourism, the conference tourism, and the medical tourism are prominent, and initiatives are being made to promote the seasonal tourism as well. Some of the country&#x27;s major tourist destinations include the capital city Athens, the islands of Santorini, Mykonos, Rhodes, Corfu and Crete, as well as the peninsula of Chalkidice.

== History ==
Tourism in Greece traces its roots to ancient times. Cultural exchange took place between the Greek colonies of Magna Graeca and the young Roman Republic before Rome&#x27;s rise to dominance of the Western Mediterranean. When Greece was annexed by the Roman Empire centuries later, the cultural exchange that started between the two civilizations triggered as a result a large number of ancient Roman tourists visiting the famous centers of Greek philosophy and science, such as Athens, Corinth and Thebes, partly because Greece had become a province of the Roman Empire and Greeks were granted Roman citizenship.

Tourism in modern-day Greece started to flourish in the 1960s and 1970s, in what became known as mass tourism. During that time, large-scale construction projects for hotels and other such facilities were undertaken, and the country saw an increase in international tourists over the years. International events such as the 2004 Summer Olympic Games and the Eurovision Song Contest 2006, both held in Athens, greatly helped to boost tourism in the country, while large-scale nationally funded cultural infrastructure such as the New Acropolis Museum also contributed to the flow of tourists in the country. Thessaloniki was the European Youth Capital in 2014.

== Land and climate ==
Greece has a Mediterranean climate along its coasts and islands. Once inland, many areas and cities experience a continental climate.

Summers are usually hot and dry, while winters are generally mild and wet. Northern Greece can experience cold winters, while Southern Greece and the islands experience considerably milder winters.

== Infrastructure ==
As a developed country highly dependent on tourism, Greece offers a wide variety of tourist facilities. Tourism infrastructure in Greece has been greatly improved since the 2004 Athens Olympic Games and continues to expand with a number of important projects particularly in areas of less mass-tourism.

===Beach resorts===
Some popular beach resorts include Crete, Rhodes, Kos, Corfu, Kefalonia, Zante and Skiathos attracting millions of foreign tourists every year.

=== Hotels and facilities ===
According to the Hellenic Chamber of Hotels in 2016, the number of hotels in Greece was by classification (bedplaces):

=== Marinas ===
Greece has 51 marinas and 14,661 mooring places that provide such services as berths, fuel, water and electricity, telephony, and repairs.

Some of the most developed and busiest marinas in Greece are just a few kilometres from the centre of Athens. The marinas of Alimos and Flisvos, on the south coast of Athens, have an aggregated capacity of more than 1,800 vessels.

=== Spas and thermal springs ===
Greece has 752 thermal springs. Many have been classified as therapeutic by the National Institute for Geographical and Mineral Research. Several of them were known and exploited already since antiquity. Thermal or curative tourism was, after all, one of the earliest forms of tourism in the ancient world. In 1983 was founded the Hellenic Association of Municipalities with Thermal Springs Some of these ancient &quot;spa resorts&quot; were situated in Aidipsos, known from the time of Aristotle, Loutraki, mentioned by Xenophon, Traianoupoli , founded by the emperor Trajan in the 2nd century A.D., whereas some others are attested in the Byzantine period, such as the Thermal baths of Langadas . In the late 19th and the beginning of the 20th century these hot springs were surrounded by cosmopolitan facilities, namely hotels and restaurants, whereas several prominent members of the society of both the Modern Greek State and the Ottoman State (for regions still incorporated in it) invested in touristic infrastructure and private estates. Thermal tourism became particularly widespread in the 1960s and 1970s, whereas in the 1980s it was widely supported by a social tourism program, which subsidized large part of the expenses for the elderly users of the facilities.
Nowadays, however, there is an urgent need to refurbish, restore and elevate these spas to modern standards and create an international clientele. Visitors, however, can already find high-standard touristic facilities in Pozar , in Aidipsos and in Kamena Vourla , in Loutraki close to Corinth as well as at Kaiafas, on the western shores of the Peloponnese . A detailed List of spa towns in Greece can give an insight in the inexorable richness of thermal springs of the country.

==Cultural attractions==
=== Museums ===
Several kinds of museums are located in the Hellenic Republic. Generally speaking, every major city and town in Greece has its own Archaeological Museum, which houses findings from the nearby area. However, most of them can be found in the big cities like Athens, where the famous New Acropolis Museum and the National Archaeological Museum are located. Furthermore, there is a vast number of galleries like the National Gallery (Athens). There are many museums in Thessaloniki too, like the Byzantine Museum. Overall, there are approximately 150 museums all over the country which are easily accessible by tourists.

=== Archaeological sites and cities ===



There are numerous archaeological sites dotted all around Greece, many of which are popular with tourists.

The Greek capital, Athens, has many archaeological sites, the most famous being the Acropolis, the Temple of Olympian Zeus, the Ancient Athenian cemetery of Kerameikos, the Philopappou Hill, the Tower of the Winds, Plato&#x27;s Academy and the Ancient Agora.

In the adjacent area of Attica are the Marathon tumuli, burying mounds in Marathon that house the ashes of the Athenian and Plataean hoplites that were killed in the homonymous battle. Findings from the area and from the battle of Marathon are preserved in the Archaeological Museum of Marathon nearby. In western Attica is Eleusis, where, from as early as 1700 BC up to the 4th century AD, it was the site of the Eleusinian Mysteries, or the Mysteries of Demeter and Kore. At the eastern tip of Attica is Sounion, with the ruins of the Temple of Poseidon.

Central Greece is the location of Thebes, an ancient city that once rivalled Athens, and featured in Greek myth. Delphi has a distinguished ancient theatre, the site of the Oracle. Thermopylae is primarily known for the battle that took place there in 480 BC, in which an outnumbered Greek force probably of seven thousand (including the famous 300 Spartans) held off a substantially larger force of Persians estimated in the range 70,000-300,000 under Xerxes.

The Peloponnese peninsula, dominating the south of the mainland, has a wide variety of archaeological sites. Beginning at the north end, there is Ancient Corinth, near the modern town of the same name. In the northeast of the peninsula are Epidaurus, with its ancient theatre, now restored; Argos, with several ancient ruins, including the Heraion; and Nemea, where, in Greek mythology, Heracles overcame the Nemean Lion of the Lady Hera, and during Antiquity the Nemean Games were played. Most important of all, however, is Mycenae, which, in the second millennium BC, was one of the major centres of Greek civilization, a military stronghold which dominated much of southern Greece and parts of southwest Anatolia. The period of Greek history from about 1600 BC to about 1100 BC is called Mycenaean in reference to Mycenae. Tiryns, also in the area, is a Mycenaean archaeological site.

In the centre of the Peloponnese are Sparta, where, near the modern town, are ancient ruins, the most important being the tomb of Leonidas; Tegea, an important religious center of ancient Greece, containing the Temple of Athena Alea; and Lycosura, said by Pausanias to be the oldest city in the world.

On the western side of the peninsula are Bassae, an archaeological site in the northeastern part of Messenia; Messene itself, the ruins of a large classical city-state refounded by Epaminondas in 369 BC; and, at Pylos, the ruins of the Palace of Nestor, which is the primary structure within a larger Late Helladic era settlement, likely once surrounded by a fortified wall. In the northwest is Olympia, with many ancient ruins, including the Temple of Zeus, the Temple of Hera, the Palaestra and the Leonidaion.

Archaeological sites in Epirus, the western part of mainland Greece, include Ambracia, the ruins of the ancient capital of Pyrrhus of Epirus; Dodona, whose shrine was regarded as the oldest Hellenic oracle, possibly dating to the second millennium BC according to Herodotus; Elaea, near the mouth of the Acheron; and Gitanae. Nicopolis or Actia Nicopolis, also in Epirus, was founded 31 BC by Octavian in memory of his victory over Antony and Cleopatra at Actium the previous year. In addition, there are the ruins believed by some to be those of the Necromanteion of Acheron, an ancient Greek temple of necromancy devoted to Hades and Persephone.

Thessaly, another region of central Greece, has an archaeological site in Larissa, the Frourio Hill, which is the location of an ancient theatre and the ruins of a basilica.

The second city of Greece, Thessaloniki, is nicknamed the &quot;Co-capital&quot;. It has many historic buildings, some World Heritage Sites, including the Arch and Rotunda of Galerius, the Church of Panagia Chalkeon and the White Tower.

In the adjacent region of Macedonia, there is Dion, the sacred place of the Ancient Macedonians. Dion is the site of a large temple dedicated to Zeus, as well as a series of temples to Demeter and to Isis. Pella, also in the region, is the capital of Ancient Macedonia and birthplace of Alexander the Great and Philip II of Macedon.

Other archaeological sites in Macedonia include Olynthus in Chalcidice; Philippi, established by the king of Macedon, Philip II, on the site of the Thracian colony of Krinides or Crenides; Amphipolis, an ancient city once inhabited by the Edoni people; Leibethra, an ancient city close to Olympus where Orpheus was buried by the Muses; Stagira, ruins of the ancient city known as the birthplace of Aristotle; and Vergina, a World Heritage Site, the location of the Macedonian Royal Tombs and the ruins of the ancient Macedonian capital.

Thrace, of which only the western part belongs to modern Greece, has an archaeological site at Abdera. Didymoteicho is a historical town built near the Turkish border which has many Ancient Greek, Byzantine and Ottoman landmarks, including the ruins of the ancient city of Plotinopolis, the Byzantine fortifications built around the town, the Bayezid Mosque built in 1420 and the Silent Baths, the oldest hamam in Europe.

The Greek islands have numerous historical sites of their own. Chalcis is located on Euboea. Delos is an uninhabited island in the Cyclades famous for its numerous archaeological sites, including the Stoivadeion, the Temple of the Delians, the Terrace of the Lions and the House of the Dolphins. On Syros, near Piraeus, and linked to the latter by a ferry taking only 2.5 hours, is the neoclassical city of Hermoupolis, where two civilizations and two religions lived harmonically and peacefully together. It has beaches, classical theatre, casino, general hospital and many places to see.

Santorini, one of the Cyclades, is the location of Ancient Thera, an antique city on a ridge of the steep, 360 m high Messavouno mountain, and of Akrotiri, a Minoan Bronze Age settlement.

The Samothrace temple complex is one of the principal Pan-Hellenic religious sanctuaries, located on the island of Samothrace.

Crete, the largest Greek island, has archaeological sites at Phaistos in the south, Zakros in the east, and most important of all, Knossos in the centre, which is famous for its ruined Minoan palace, with bull motifs.

Rhodes, one of the Dodecanese islands, is the location of the Acropolis of Rhodes, an acropolis dating from the Classical Greek period (5th–3rd century BC); the Acropolis of Lindos, a natural citadel which was fortified successively by the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Knights of St John and the Ottomans; and the ancient city of Kameiros. On the nearby island of Kos is the Asclepeion, the ruins of one of the greatest healing temples of the Ancient World and the place where Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine was trained. On Kastellorizo, the easternmost island of Greece, is the Lycian Tomb, a rock cut tomb built by the ancient Anatolian civilization of the Lycians.

== Alternate tourism ==

=== LGBT tourism ===
Greece also is one of Europe&#x27;s most popular LGBT tourist destinations, particularly its largest cities Athens and Thessaloniki and some of its islands such as Lesbos, Santorini, Skiathos and Mykonos. The latter is a well-known Gay-friendly destination with many establishments catering for the LGBT community. Skiathos and Mykonos are ranked among the most LGBT-friendly destinations in Europe and the world.

=== Religious tourism ===
Greece is promoting religious tourism and pilgrimages to regions with a significant historical religious presence, such as the Christian monasteries in Meteora and Mount Athos, in cooperation with other countries.

=== Medical tourism ===
Greece&#x27;s temperate climate, highly-trained medical staff, and cutting-edge medical innovations also are contributing to the country&#x27;s medical travel industry.

=== Ecotourism ===
Greece has become in recent years a destination for ecotourism (especially hiking, canoeing, caving and climbing). The main destinations for skiing in Greece are Arachova, Kalavryta, Karpenisi and Metsovo.
The Greek government is trying to bring more and more ecotourism to help and save the environment. So tourists and locals alike can have a clean environment.

=== Conference tourism ===
Conference tourism, targeted at academic, business, or cultural markets, is a cornerstone of the Greek national tourism policy. As a result, the Greek government, with strong support from local authorities, has been offering lucrative cash grants, leasing and employment subsidies and tax allowances to establish new conference facilities and expand existing ones. In a recent report in Meeting and Incentive Travel, Greece was ranked eighth in the world in overnight stays for conferences. Figures from the Tourism Satellite Accounting Research, conducted by WTTC (World Travel &amp; Tourism Council) project a worldwide increase in revenues in business travel to Greece from US$1.51 bn. in 2001 to US$2.69 bn. in 2011. In 1998, the figure stood at US$1.18 bn.

=== Four Seasons &amp; Winter tourism ===
The government intends to promote four seasons &amp; winter tourism in Greece, which could potentially increase international arrivals even further.

== Economic impact ==
At the same time, tourism consumption increased considerably since the turn of the millennium, from US$17.7 bn. in 2000 to US$29.6 bn. in 2004. The numbers of jobs directly or indirectly related to the tourism sector were 659,719 and represented 16.5% of the country&#x27;s total employment for that year.

=== Revenues by countries ===

Greece earned €19,746,000,000 (around 11% of the total GDP) through its tourism industry, in 2023.

The top four countries by revenue (in ‘000 euros) were:

== Visitors ==


In 2009, the country welcomed over 19.3 million tourists, a major increase from the 17.7 million tourists the country welcomed in 2008. The vast majority of tourists in the country are from within the European Union (12.7 million), followed by those from the Americas (0.56 million), Asia (0.52 million), Oceania (0.1 million) and Africa (0.06 million). In the year 2007, more British people visited the country than any other nationality, numbering 2.61 million in total, making up 15% of the country&#x27;s tourists for that year alone. Additionally, 2.3 million Germans, 1.8 million Albanians and 1.1 million Bulgarians visited the country that year. In 2007, 92.8% of the total number of tourists in Greece were from countries in Europe.

The most-visited region of Greece is that of Central Macedonia in northern Greece, near some of the most popular attractions in the country such as Halkidiki, Mount Olympus, Pella, the birthplace of Alexander the Great, and Greece&#x27;s second-largest city, Thessaloniki. In 2009, Central Macedonia welcomed 3.6 million tourists, or 18% of the total number of tourists who visited Greece that year, followed by Attica (2.6 million) and the Peloponnese (1.8 million). Northern Greece is the country&#x27;s most-visited region, with 6.5 million tourists, while Central Greece comes second with 6.3 million.

According to a survey conducted in China in 2015, Greece was voted as the Chinese people&#x27;s number one choice as a tourist destination. In November 2016, Austria, like China, announced that Greece was the favourite tourist destination for its citizens. In line with these observations, Greece&#x27;s former Minister of Tourism Aris Spiliotopoulos announced the opening of a Greek National Tourism Organization office in Shanghai by the end of 2010, and GNTO currently operates two tourism offices in China, one in Shanghai and one in Beijing. It is estimated that throughout 2013 Greece welcomed over 17.93 million tourists, an increase of 10% compared to 2012.
More than 22 million tourists visited Greece in 2014 and this number increased to 26 million visitors in 2015 and is projected to attract 28 million visitors in 2016, making it one of the most visited countries in Europe and the world.
Tourism in Greece will typically peak between May and September where approximately 75% of all tourist visits happen.

=== Arrivals by countries ===

In 2023, Germany ranked as the leading tourist market for Greece with approximately 4.7 million tourists visiting the country. UK and Italy followed on the ranking with roughly 4.5 million and 1.8 million travelers in Greece, respectively. Traditionally, Germany, UK, Italy, Bulgaria, France and USA have been the main tourist markets for Greece. In 2023, the top 10 countries of arrival were:
== Promoting Greek tourism ==
Tourism in Greece is run by the Greek National Tourism Organisation (GNTO) who used Helena Paparizou, a famous Greek singer who won Eurovision Song Contest in 2005 as an ambassador. Singer Sakis Rouvas, who represented Greece in the 2009 Eurovision song contest, is currently the ambassador for Greek Tourism.

The advertisements displayed in the GNTO&#x27;s web&quot;site still focus on the triptych of sea, sun and sand. However, the tourism campaign is undergoing a significant change as city-breaks and conference tourism are promoted, along with cultural and wellness tourism. The impact of the new campaign will hopefully result in increased tourist revenues. The name of commercials is &quot;You in Greece&quot;.

<text>Richard Stephen Dreyfuss ( ; Dreyfus; born October 29, 1947) is an American actor. He emerged from the New Hollywood wave of American cinema, finding fame with a succession of leading man parts in the 1970s. He has received an Academy Award, a BAFTA, and a Golden Globe Award.

Dreyfuss rose to promimence with starring roles in &quot;American Graffiti&quot; (1973), &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot; (1974), &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975), and &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977). He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Elliot Garfield in the 1977 romantic comedy &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot;, and was Oscar-nominated in the same category for his title role in the 1995 drama &quot;Mr. Holland&#x27;s Opus&quot;. His other film credits include &quot;The Competition&quot; (1980), &quot;Stand by Me&quot; (1986), &quot;Down and Out in Beverly Hills&quot; (1986), &quot;Stakeout&quot; (1987), &quot;Nuts&quot; (1987), &quot;Always&quot; (1989), 
&quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot; (1990), &quot;What About Bob?&quot; (1991), &quot;The American President&quot; (1995), and &quot;W.&quot; (2008).

On television, Dreyfuss starred as the title character on the CBS drama series &quot;The Education of Max Bickford&quot; (2001–2002), for which he was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor. He also portrayed Fagin in the 1997 Disney adaptation of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, Meyer Lansky in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Lansky&quot; (1999), Alexander Haig in Showtime&#x27;s &quot;The Day Reagan Was Shot&quot; (2001), and Bernie Madoff in the ABC miniseries &quot;Madoff&quot; (2016).

==Early life and education==
Dreyfuss was born on October 29, 1947, in Brooklyn, New York, the second and younger son of Norman Dreyfuss, an attorney, restaurateur and plastics company owner originally from a &quot;violent gang culture in Brooklyn&quot;, and Geraldine (&quot;nee&quot; Robbins), a peace activist. He is the second child of three children. He had an older brother, Lorin, who was an actor, film producer and screenplay writer, and a younger sister, Cathy. His father Norman suffered from the debilitating physical effects of a mortar explosion at the Battle of the Bulge in World War II, requiring the use of crutches, canes, and special footwear provided by the Army for the rest of his life. He left the family when his son was 21 years old, and remarried more than once; he and his son were not on speaking terms at the time of his death.

Dreyfuss was raised in the Bayside area of Queens. His family is Jewish, descended from immigrants from Russia and Poland; the Dreyfuss family was from Rzeszow. He has commented that he &quot;grew up thinking that Alfred Dreyfus and [he] are from the same family&quot; and that his great-grand aunt was Hesya Helfman, one of the assassins of Tsar Alexander II of Russia and the only one to escape execution for the deed. His father disliked New York, and moved the family first to Europe, and later to Los Angeles when Dreyfuss was nine. Dreyfuss attended Beverly Hills High School.

==Career==

=== 1964–1974: Rise to prominence === 
Dreyfuss began acting in his youth, at Temple Emanuel of Beverly Hills Arts Center and the Westside Jewish Community Center, under drama teacher Bill Miller. He debuted in the TV production &quot;In Mama&#x27;s House&quot;, when he was fifteen. He attended San Fernando Valley State College, now California State University, Northridge, for a year, and was a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War, working in alternate service for two years, as a clerk in a Los Angeles hospital. During this time, he acted in a few small TV roles on shows such as &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, &quot;Room 222 &quot;, &quot;Gidget&quot;, &quot;That Girl&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Bewitched&quot;, &quot;The Ghost &amp; Mrs. Muir&quot;, and &quot;The Big Valley&quot;. He played a larger role in an episode in the second season of &quot;Judd, for the Defense&quot;. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, he also performed on stage on Broadway, Off-Broadway, repertory, and improvisational theater. Dreyfuss appeared in the play &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot;, which was revived on March 17, 1972, at the Huntington Hartford Theater in Los Angeles, and directed by Edwin Sherin.

Dreyfuss&#x27;s first film role was a small, uncredited appearance in &quot;The Graduate&quot;. He had one line, &quot;Shall I get the cops? I&#x27;ll get the cops.&quot; He was also briefly seen as a stagehand in &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; (1967), in which he had a few lines. In mid-1972, Dreyfuss filmed a supporting role in &quot;The Second Coming of Suzanne&quot;, but the movie did not premiere for two years. In 1973 he starred in the CBS pilot &quot;Catch-22&quot;. He subsequently appeared in &quot;Dillinger&quot;, and landed a key role in the 1973 George Lucas hit &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, acting with other future stars such as Harrison Ford. Dreyfuss played his first lead role in the Canadian film &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot; (1974), receiving positive reviews, including praise from Pauline Kael.

=== 1975–1995: Career stardom and acclaim === 
Dreyfuss went on to star in box office blockbusters &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975) and &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977), both directed by Steven Spielberg. He won the 1978 Academy Award for Best Actor at the 50th Academy Awards ceremony for his portrayal of a struggling actor in &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; (1977), becoming the youngest actor to do so (at the age of 30 years, 125 days old), besting Marlon Brando, who had won his first Oscar in 1955 at the age of 30 years, 360 days old. This record stood for 25 years until it was broken in 2003 by Adrien Brody, who was three weeks shy of age 30 at the time of the 75th Academy Awards ceremony. Dreyfuss is still, however, the shortest to have ever won Best Actor, standing at about 5 foot 4¼ inches tall. In five years, between 1973 and 1978, the films that Dreyfuss appeared in grossed upwards of $900 million. He made his producing debut with &quot;The Big Fix&quot; (1978), in which he also starred.

Around 1978, Dreyfuss began using cocaine frequently; he claims to not remember anything from the production of the 1981 film &quot;Whose Life Is It Anyway?&quot;. His addiction came to a head in 1982, when he was arrested for possession of the drug after he blacked out while driving, and his Mercedes-Benz 450 SL struck a tree. He entered rehabilitation and eventually made a Hollywood comeback with the films &quot;Down and Out in Beverly Hills&quot; in 1986 and &quot;Stakeout&quot; the following year. Dreyfuss appeared as the elder Gordie Lachance (played by his &quot;Buddy System&quot; co-star Wil Wheaton) in Rob Reiner&#x27;s &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, a coming-of-age drama/comedy adapted from Stephen King&#x27;s novella &quot;The Body&quot;. He was nominated for a Golden Globe playing a defense lawyer in the courtroom thriller &quot;Nuts&quot;. In 1988, he reunited with director Paul Mazursky to star in the political farce &quot;Moon over Parador&quot;.

In 1989, Dreyfuss reunited with Spielberg on &quot;Always&quot;, a remake of &quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot; in which he co-starred with Holly Hunter, and reunited with his &quot;Close Encounters&quot; co-star Teri Garr for the comedy &quot;Let It Ride&quot;. He had a starring role opposite Bill Murray in the 1991 comedy &quot;What About Bob?&quot;, as a psychiatrist driven to insanity by a particularly obsessive new patient. That same year, Dreyfuss produced and starred as Georges Picquart in &quot;Prisoner of Honor&quot;, an HBO movie about the historical Dreyfus Affair. In 1994, he participated in the historic &quot;Papal Concert to Commemorate the Shoah&quot; at the Vatican in the presence of Pope John Paul II, Rav Elio Toaff, chief rabbi of Rome, and Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, President of the Italian Republic. He recited Kaddish as part of a performance of Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s Third Symphony with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under the baton of Gilbert Levine. The event was broadcast worldwide. Dreyfuss received his second Oscar nomination for his performance as Glenn Holland in &quot;Mr. Holland&#x27;s Opus&quot; (1995). Since then, he has continued working in movies, television and the stage. In 2001–2002, he played Max Bickford in the television drama &quot;The Education of Max Bickford&quot;. In 2004, he appeared in the revival of &quot;Sly Fox&quot; on Broadway (opposite Eric Stoltz, René Auberjonois, Bronson Pinchot and Elizabeth Berkley).

=== 1996–present === 

In 1997, Dreyfuss recorded a voiceover for the Apple Computer &quot;Think Different&quot; ad campaign, and also provided the voice of the narrator in &quot;The Call of the Wild: Dog of the Yukon&quot;. In 1999, Dreyfuss made his London West End debut starring alongside Marsha Mason in Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Prisoner of Second Avenue&quot; at the Theatre Royal Haymarket. Dreyfuss spent four years as a research adviser at St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford, from 2004 until 2008. He was scheduled to appear in a 2004 production of &quot;The Producers&quot; in London, but withdrew from the production a week before opening night. The media noted that Dreyfuss was suffering from problems relating to an operation for a herniated disc, and that the part of Max Bialystock in the play was a physically demanding one. Both he and his assistant for the production stated that Dreyfuss was accumulating injuries that required him to wear physical therapy supports during rehearsals. After Dreyfuss was officially let go from the production he was replaced by Nathan Lane. He ultimately made his West End return at The Old Vic in 2009.

In 2006, he appeared as Richard Nelson, a gay architect and one of the survivors in the film &quot;Poseidon&quot;. Dreyfuss portrayed U.S Vice President Dick Cheney in Oliver Stone&#x27;s 2008 George W. Bush biopic &quot;W&quot;.
In 2009, he appeared in the play &quot;Complicit&quot; by Joe Sutton at London&#x27;s Old Vic theatre. The production was directed by the theatre&#x27;s artistic director, Kevin Spacey. Dreyfuss&#x27;s performance was subject to some controversy, owing to his use of an earpiece onstage, reportedly because of his inability to learn his lines in time. According to an article published in 2017, Kevin Spacey groped one of Dreyfuss&#x27;s sons while the three of them were alone in Spacey&#x27;s apartment, an allegation that a lawyer representing Kevin Spacey denied. Richard Dreyfuss was focused on learning the lines of his script at the time and did not notice any harassment. He guest-voiced as himself in the &quot;Three Kings&quot; episode of &quot;Family Guy&quot; in 2009, and later appeared again in the episode &quot;Peter-assment&quot;. Dreyfuss guest starred in the sixth season of &quot;Weeds&quot; as Warren Schiff, Nancy&#x27;s high school teacher to whom she had lost her virginity.

In 2010, he played Matt Boyd in &quot;Piranha 3D&quot;. Dreyfuss was inducted as a &quot;star&quot; on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on October 10, 1996. It is located at 7021 Hollywood Blvd. Dreyfuss was among 99 other stars at the 2012 Academy Awards – Night of 100 Stars. He did an interview for the &quot;Bill Zucker Show&quot; with actor/singer Bill Zucker.

In 2014, he appeared with best-selling Abraham Lincoln scholar Ronald C. White in a documentary entitled &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s Greatest Speech&quot;, highlighting Lincoln&#x27;s Second Inaugural Address, appearing as host of the program and reciting Lincoln&#x27;s speech on camera. Dreyfuss portrayed Bernie Madoff in the miniseries &quot;Madoff&quot; (2016), co-starring Blythe Danner. He followed it up with roles in the hit comedy &quot;Book Club&quot; (2018) opposite Candice Bergen and the Netflix movie &quot;The Last Laugh&quot; (2019) with Chevy Chase and Andie MacDowell.

==Personal life==
=== Marriages and family ===

Dreyfuss married writer and producer Jeramie Rain in the early 1980s, and they had three children. After his 1995 divorce from Rain, Dreyfuss married Janelle Lacey in 1999. They divorced in 2005.

In 2006, Dreyfuss discussed his diagnosis of bipolar disorder in the documentary &quot;Stephen Fry: The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive&quot;, in which Fry (who also has the disorder) interviewed Dreyfuss about his experience being bipolar.

Dreyfuss and Russian-born Svetlana Erokhin married in 2006 and as of February 2020 they reside in the San Diego area, although they have frequently visited New York City, London, and Sun Valley, Idaho. 

During his acting career, Dreyfuss had public feuds with some of the people he worked alongside, notably actors Robert Shaw and Bill Murray, who costarred with him in &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;What About Bob?&quot; respectively, and filmmaker Oliver Stone, who directed him in &quot;W&quot;.

In 2017, writer Jessica Teich accused Dreyfuss of sexual harassment during the filming of an ABC special. Dreyfuss denied the allegations. He said he had been overly flirtatious in his past, and that he regretted that behavior, but he emphasized that he &quot;value[s] and respect[s] women&quot; and is &quot;not an assaulter.&quot; He thought they were involved in a &quot;consensual seduction ritual.&quot;

=== Interests ===
Dreyfuss seeks to revive civics education to teach future generations about the power of their citizenship and the principles that hold America together. In 2006, he created The Dreyfuss Civics Initiative (TDCI). TDCI is a 501(c)3 designated organization, recognized as of 2008.

On February 16, 2006, he spoke at The National Press Club in Washington, D.C., in hopes of prompting a national discussion on impeachment charges against U.S. President George W. Bush. On November 17, 2006, Dreyfuss appeared on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot; as a panel member to discuss teaching Civics in schools. In 2007, Dreyfuss appeared in the youth voting documentary film &quot;18 in &#x27;08&quot;.

In 1995, Dreyfuss co-authored with science-fiction writer Harry Turtledove the book &quot;The Two Georges&quot;, a novel set in the year 1995 of a timeline in which the American Revolution was peacefully avoided. In 2022, he authored &quot;One Thought Scares Me...: We Teach Our Children What We Wish Them to Know; We Don&#x27;t Teach Our Children What We Don&#x27;t Wish Them to Know&quot; about the teaching of civics in American schools. 

=== Political views ===

In a 2016 interview with TheWrap, Dreyfuss reportedly said, “I haven’t been a Democrat since 2004.”

Dreyfuss has been outspoken regarding the media&#x27;s influence in shaping public opinion, policy, and legislation. In the 2000s, he expressed his sentiments in favor of right to privacy, freedom of speech, democracy, and individual accountability. In 2011 and 2014, Dreyfuss was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board.

In May 2023, Dreyfuss spoke out against the Academy Awards&#x27; new diversity guidelines that require films to have met at least two of four benchmarks, including that the lead actors are from underrepresented groups or that at least 30% of the cast and crew come from these groups. During an interview with Margaret Hoover, host of the PBS show &quot;The Firing Line&quot;, Dreyfuss said that the new guidelines &quot;make me vomit&quot;. He explained that he was opposed to the guidelines because movie-making is &quot;an art form ... and no one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give into the latest, most current idea of what morality is.&quot; 

During a screening of &quot;Jaws&quot; at The Cabot theater in Beverly, Massachusetts, on May 27, 2024, Dreyfuss criticised &quot;diversity initiatives&quot;, and launched into what was described as a transphobic, misogynistic, homophobic, and sexist rant, causing many attendees to shout at the actor, and many to leave the venue in dismay. According to eyewitnesses, Dreyfuss criticized the MeToo and LGBTQ movements and disparaged parents of transgender children, suggesting that supporting a child&#x27;s transition was indicative of bad parenting.

<text>The Overland Automobile Company was an American automobile manufacturer in Toledo, Ohio. It was the founding company of Willys-Overland and one of the earliest mass producers of automobiles. 

==History==
The Overland Automobile department was founded in Terre Haute, Indiana, by Claude E. Cox, when Charles Minshall of Standard Wheel Company decided to expand into automobile manufacturing. Standard Wheel were major suppliers of wheels to the carriage industry. Cox, a recent graduate of Rose Polytechnic Institute, developed a gasoline runabout in 1903.

Cox&#x27;s runabout was an advanced design with a water-cooled 5-hp vertical single-cylinder engine mounted up front under a hood, rather than under the seat which was common practice. It featured a jump-spark ignition and a two-speed planetary transmission operated by a foot pedal. Priced at $595 (), 11 were built in 1903, doubling to 23 in 1904 when a two-cylinder engine was introduced. Claude Cox continued development adding a 16-hp four-cylinder engine, shaft-drive instead of chain and a steering wheel instead of a tiller, by 1905. 

In 1905, Standard Wheel moved Overland production to Indianapolis, Indiana, but decided to leave automobile production and sold Overland to Claude Cox for $8,000, . David M. Parry became a 51% investor and formed the Overland Auto Company. Overland production was now in an extension of Parry&#x27;s buggy factory. Now producing two models, production was only 37 cars in 1905 because of the moves, and in 1906, production increased to 47, all sold to John North Willys, a car dealer in Elmira, New York. 

The 1907 Panic caused David Parry to go bankrupt, including the loss of his house. By 1910, he had recovered enough to start the Parry Auto Company. J. N. Willys arrived in Indianapolis to protect his investment and ended up taking over Overland Auto Company.

In 1908, control of Overland was purchased by J. N. Willys, and he managed to increase production that year to 467 Overlands. Overlands were rationalized to one design of a 24hp four-cylinder car on two different wheelbases selling for $1,295, . In 1909, the production soared to 4,907 Overlands, and Claude Cox left for Inter-State and later to form his own laboratory business (now Testek, Inc.) in Detroit. In 1909, the Pope-Toledo factory was purchased and Overland moved to Toledo.

Production continued to grow, and Overland remained a top three U. S. automobile manufacturer through 1919. In 1912, it was renamed Willys-Overland Company. Overland models expanded in the mid-price automobile market until 1917, when a new $500 () Overland to challenge the Model T Ford was announced. A disastrous strike delayed introduction until 1919, when it was priced at $845 () with electric lights and a self-starter. Willys revised this car to the Blue Bird and Red Bird models, which helped Willys-Overland return to strength following a Receivership. Willys-Overland continued to use the Overland marque until 1926, when it became the Overland Whippet and then Willys Whippet.

==Models==
==Media==

One of the more unusual uses of an Overland was in 1911 when Milton Reeves used a 1910 model to create his 8-wheel Octo-Auto, his eight-wheel car.

The last vestige of the Overland automobile empire remains in the form of bricks spelling out &quot;Overland&quot; in the smoke stack at the Toledo factory that once formed the core of Willys automotive empire. But the name would come back when DaimlerChrysler (Now Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) introduced the Overland name for a trim package on the 2002–present (except 2005 model year) Jeep Grand Cherokee. The badging is a recreation of the Overland nameplate from the early twentieth century.

<doc id="159632" wikidata="Q1755411" url="?curid=159632" title="Link-state routing protocol">
<text>Link-state routing protocols are one of the two main classes of routing protocols used in packet switching networks for computer communications, the others being distance-vector routing protocols. Examples of link-state routing protocols include Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS).

The link-state protocol is performed by every &quot;switching node&quot; in the network (i.e., nodes which are prepared to forward packets; in the Internet, these are called routers). The basic concept of link-state routing is that every node constructs a &quot;map&quot; of the connectivity to the network in the form of a graph, showing which nodes are connected to which other nodes. Each node then independently calculates the next best logical &quot;path&quot; from it to every possible destination in the network. Each collection of best paths will then form each node&#x27;s routing table.

This contrasts with distance-vector routing protocols, which work by having each node share its routing table with its neighbors, in a link-state protocol, the only information passed between nodes is &quot;connectivity related&quot;. Link-state algorithms are sometimes characterized informally as each router &quot;telling the world about its neighbors.&quot;

==Overview==
In link-state routing protocols, each router possesses information about the complete network topology. Each router then independently calculates the best next hop from it for every possible destination in the network using local information of the topology. The collection of best next hops forms the routing table.

This contrasts with distance-vector routing protocols, which work by having each node share its routing table with its neighbours. In a link-state protocol, the only information passed between the nodes is the information used to construct the connectivity maps.

==History==
What is believed to be the first adaptive routing network of computers, using link-state routing, was designed and implemented during 1976–1977 by a team from Plessey Radar led by Bernard J Harris; the project was for &quot;Wavell&quot; a system of computer command and control for the British Army. The first link-state routing concept was published in 1979 by John M. McQuillan (then at Bolt, Beranek and Newman) as a mechanism that would calculate routes more quickly when network conditions changed and thus lead to more stable routing.

The technique was later adapted for use in the contemporary link-state routing protocols IS-IS and OSPF. Cisco literature refers to Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) as a &quot;hybrid&quot; protocol, despite the fact it distributes routing tables instead of topology maps. However, it does synchronize routing tables at start-up as OSPF does and sends specific updates only when topology changes occur.

In 2004, Radia Perlman proposed using link-state routing for layer 2 frame forwarding with devices called routing bridges, or Rbridges. The Internet Engineering Task Force has standardized the Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) protocol to accomplish this.

More recently, this hierarchical technique was applied to wireless mesh networks using the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR). Where a connection can have varying quality, the quality of a connection can be used to select better connections. This is used in some ad hoc routing protocols that use radio frequency transmission.

==Distributing maps==

The first main stage in the link-state algorithm is to give a map of the network to every node. This is done with several subsidiary steps. First, each node needs to determine what other ports it is connected to over fully working links; it does this using &quot;reachability protocol&quot; that it runs periodically and separately with each of its directly connected neighbours.

Each node periodically (and in case of connectivity changes) sends a short message, the link-state advertisement, which:

* Identifies the node that is producing it.
* Identifies all the other nodes (either routers or networks) to which it is directly connected.
* Includes a &#x27;sequence number&#x27;, which increases every time the source node makes up a new version of the message&quot;.&quot;

This message is sent to all the nodes on a network. As a necessary precursor, each node in the network remembers, for every one of &quot;its&quot; neighbors, the sequence number of the last link-state message which it received from that node. When a link-state advertisement is received at a node, the node looks up the sequence number it has stored for the source of that link-state message; if this message is newer (i.e., has a higher sequence number), it is saved, the sequence number is updated, and a copy is sent in turn to each of that node&#x27;s neighbors. This procedure rapidly gets a copy of the latest version of each node&#x27;s link-state advertisement to every node in the network.

The complete set produces the graph for the map of the network. The link-state message giving information about the neighbors is recomputed and then flooded throughout the network whenever there is a change in the connectivity between the node and its neighbors, e.g., when a link fails.

==Calculating the routing table==
The second main stage in the link-state algorithm is to produce routing tables by inspecting the maps. Each node independently runs an algorithm over the map to determine the shortest path from itself to every other node in the network; generally, some variant of Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm is used. A node maintains two data structures: a tree containing nodes which are &quot;done&quot;, and a list of &quot;candidates&quot;. The algorithm starts with both structures empty; it then adds to the first one the node itself. The variant of a greedy algorithm then repetitively does the following:

* All neighbour nodes which are directly connected to the node are just added to the tree (excepting any nodes which are already in either the tree or the &quot;candidate&quot; list). The rest are added to the second (&quot;candidate&quot;) list.
* Each node in the &quot;candidate&quot; list is compared to each of the nodes already in the tree. The candidate node which is closest to any of the nodes already in the tree is itself moved into the tree and attached to the appropriate neighbor node. When a node is moved from the candidate list into the tree, it is removed from the candidate list and is not considered in subsequent iterations of the algorithm.

The two steps are repeated as long as there are any nodes left in the candidate list. (When there are none, all the nodes in the network will have been added to the tree.) This procedure ends with the tree containing all the nodes in the network. For any given destination node, the best path for that destination is the node which is the first step from the root node, down the branch in the shortest-path tree which leads toward the desired destination node.

== Algorithm optimizations ==
Whenever a change in the connectivity map happens, it is necessary to recompute the shortest-path tree and then recreate the routing table. BBN Technologies discovered how to compute only that part of the tree which could have been affected by a given change in the map.

===Topology reduction===
In some cases, it is reasonable to reduce the number of nodes that generate LSA messages. For this reason, a topology reduction strategy can be applied, in which only a subset of the network nodes generate LSA messages. Two widely studied approaches for topology reduction are multipoint relays that are at the base of the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) but have also been proposed for OSPF and connected dominating sets that were again proposed for OSPF.
===Fisheye State Routing===
With Fisheye State Routing (FSR), the LSA are sent with different time-to-live values to restrict their diffusion and limit the overhead due to control messages. The same concept is used also in the Hazy Sighted Link State Routing Protocol.

==Failure modes==
If all the nodes are not working from exactly the same map, &quot;routing loops&quot; can form. These are situations in which, in the simplest form, two neighboring nodes each think the other is the best path to a given destination. Any packet headed to that destination arriving at either node will loop between the two, hence the name. Routing loops involving more than two nodes are also possible.

This can occur since each node computes its shortest-path tree and its routing table without interacting in any way with any other nodes. If two nodes start with different maps, it is possible to have scenarios in which routing loops are created. In certain circumstances, differential loops may be enabled within a multi-cloud environment. Variable access nodes across the interface protocol may also bypass the simultaneous access node problem.

==Optimized Link State Routing Protocol ==
The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) is a link-state routing protocol optimized for mobile ad hoc networks (which can also be used on other wireless ad hoc networks). OLSR is proactive and uses hello and topology control messages to disseminate link-state information into the mobile ad hoc network. Using hello messages, each node discovers two-hop neighbor information and elects a set of &quot;multipoint relays&quot; (MPRs). MPRs make OLSR distinct from other link-state routing protocols. Individual nodes use the topology information to compute next-hop paths regarding all nodes in the network using shortest-hop forwarding paths.

<doc id="159633" wikidata="Q757489" url="?curid=159633" title="Atmel">
<text>Atmel Corporation was a creator and manufacturer of semiconductors before being subsumed by Microchip Technology in 2016. Atmel was founded in 1984. The company focused on embedded systems built around microcontrollers. Its products included microcontrollers (8-bit AVR, 32-bit AVR, 32-bit ARM-based, automotive grade, and 8-bit Intel 8051 derivatives) radio-frequency (RF) devices including Wi-Fi, EEPROM, and flash memory devices, symmetric and asymmetric security chips, touch sensors and controllers, and application-specific products. Atmel supplies its devices as standard products, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), or application-specific standard product (ASSPs) depending on the requirements of its customers.

Atmel serves applications including consumer, communications, computer networking, industrial, medical, automotive, aerospace and military. It specializes in microcontroller and touch systems, especially for embedded systems.

Atmel&#x27;s corporate headquarters is in San Jose, California, in the North San Jose Innovation District. Other locations include Trondheim, Norway; Colorado Springs, Colorado; Chennai, India; Shanghai, China; Taipei, Taiwan; Rousset, France; Nantes, France; Patras, Greece; Heilbronn, Germany; Munich, Germany; Whiteley, United Kingdom; Cairo, Egypt. Atmel makes much of its product line at vendor fabrication facilities. It owns a facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado that manufactures its XSense line of flexible touch sensors.

In 2016, Microchip agreed to buy Atmel for billion in a deal brokered by JPMorgan Chase and Qatalyst.

==History==
===Founding and 1980s growth===
Atmel Corporation was founded in 1984, by George Perlegos. Atmel was an acronym for &quot;advanced technology for memory and logic&quot;. Perlegos had worked in the memory group of Intel in the 1970s and had co-founded Seeq Technology to manufacture EPROM memory. Using only US$30,000 in capital, Atmel was initially operated as a fabless company, using Sanyo and General Instrument to make the chip wafers.
The first Atmel memory products used less power than competitors. Customers included Motorola, Nokia, and Ericsson. In 1987, Intel sued Atmel for patent infringement. Rather than fight the patent claim, Atmel redesigned its products to use different intellectual property. These had better performance and even lower power consumption. In addition, Atmel then entered the flash memory business that Intel had focused on. Atmel used US$60 million in venture capital for the 1989 purchase of a fabrication facility from Honeywell in Colorado Springs. Atmel then invested another US$30 million in manufacturing technology.

===1990s expansion===

In 1991, Atmel expanded the Colorado facility after acquiring Concurrent Logic, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) manufacturer. The company made its initial public offering (IPO) in 1991 which yielded more than US$65 million. 1994 saw Atmel enter the microprocessor market. The first Atmel flash memory microcontroller was based on the Intel 8051.
The controller executed an instruction for every clock cycle, as opposed to the 12 cycles that legacy 8051 parts required.
In 1994, Atmel purchased the EEPROM assets of Seeq Technology (LSI Corporation acquired the rest of Seeq in 1999). In 1995, Atmel was among the first companies to license the ARM architecture, creating its AT91 family of devices, followed by the SAM family, and more recently a full selection of Cortex-based solutions, including ones based on the ultra-low-power ARM Cortex-M4. Atmel now has dozens of families of ARM-based devices. In 1995, Atmel acquired the pan-European chipmaker European Silicon Structures (ES2) and thus gained a fabrication facility in Rousset, France. Atmel built a new fab alongside the existing ES2 fab. This business unit was named Atmel-ES2. Atmel acquired Digital Research in Electronic Acoustics and Music (DREAM) in 1996. Atmel formed a design team in Trondheim, Norway to develop the Atmel AVR line of RISC microcontrollers. This team combined technology of former students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology with Atmel&#x27;s expertise in flash memory. These 8-bit Harvard architecture chips were first developed in 1996. The AVR chip is the basis of most Arduino open-source development boards. In 1998, Atmel purchased part of TEMIC from Vishay Intertechnology, which provided them with a fab in Germany as well as part of MHS from Vishay that gave them a fab in Nantes, France.

In September 2000, Atmel acquired a fabrication plant in North Tyneside, England, from Siemens, via a £28 million grant from the UK government and paying Siemens around US$35 million.

===Streamlining===
Atmel streamlined operations with a strategy called &quot;fab-lite&quot;. This started in 2005 when Atmel sold the MHS fab in Nantes France to Xbybus. In February 2006, Steven Laub became a director and in August president and chief executive officer. Under Laub Atmel divested more manufacturing plants and business lines. Atmel announced the sale of its North Tyneside facility (Fab9) on October 8, 2007. The manufacturing equipment was sold to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. (TSMC) and the property and associated land to Highbridge Business Park Limited. In 2008, Atmel sold their fab in Germany to Tejas semiconductor. In 2010, Atmel received approval from the French government to sell its fab to Germany-based LFoundry GmbH, while retaining their design center there. Atmel completed the sale of their Secure Microcontroller Solutions smart card business to INSIDE Secure. In February 2011, Atmel sold its Digital Research in Electronics, Acoustics and Music (DREAM) business, which sold products for karaoke and other entertainment machines, for US$2.3 million. Atmel&#x27;s DataFlash serial interface flash memory products were sold to Adesto Technologies in October 2012.

===Acquisitions===

As Atmel divested several fabs and ancillary business lines, Laub also oversaw acquisitions. One strategy was to participate in the touch screen market, both in the semiconductor chips and the sensors themselves. In 2008, Atmel bought Queens Award-winning Quantum Research Group Ltd. (now known as Atmel Technologies Ireland Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary), a supplier of capacitive sensing technology. Work done at Quantum, led to the 2012 release of Atmel&#x27;s XSense product line, a flexible touch screen based on copper mesh electrodes.

Atmel moved into Internet of things technology. They completed the acquisition of Advanced Digital Design S.A, a Spanish company that develops power line communication. Ozmo Devices, which developed products for Wi-Fi Direct, was acquired by Atmel in December 2012. Ozmo was founded in 2004 as H-Stream Wireless by Kateljin Vleugels and Roel Peeters, and was based in Palo Alto, California.

In 2012, Atmel had approximately US$1.4 billion in annual revenue, with over 60% of their revenue from microcontrollers, and net income of US$30 million.

Atmel purchased the smart metering product lines of IDT Corporation in March 2013.

Atmel purchased Newport Media in July 2014. This will provide Atmel further capability in wireless Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.

===Acquisition by Microchip Technology===
In October 2008, Atmel received an unsolicited offer from Microchip Technology and ON Semiconductor, estimated at US$2.3 billion. The offer was eventually rejected and the companies gave up on their hostile takeover attempt.

However, in 2016, Microchip agreed to buy Atmel for $3.6 billion. JPMorgan Chase and Qatalyst Partners served as financial advisers to Microchip and Atmel, respectively. The company had previously heard offers from Cypress Semiconductor and Dialog Semiconductor in 2015, and the deal with Microchip was expected to be finalized at the end of Q2 2016.

Atmel finally merged with Microchip Technology in July 2016 after prolonged negotiations for US$3.56 billion.

===The end of Atmel Way===
Apple Computer purchased the old cul-de-sac where Atmel&#x27;s HQ office sat. Paperwork was filed with the city of San Jose to change the name from &quot;Atmel Way&quot; to &quot;Orchard Place&quot;.

==Products==

===Microcontrollers===
A large part of Atmel&#x27;s revenue is from microcontrollers. These include the AVR 8- and 32-bit microcontrollers, ARM architecture microprocessors, and ARM-based flash microcontrollers. In addition Atmel still makes microcontrollers that use the 8051 architecture, albeit improved to do single-cycle instructions. Supporting the microcontrollers is the Atmel Studio 7 integrated development environment which Atmel offers for free. They also provide an Atmel Software Framework.

===Wireless / RF===
To provide for the Internet of Things (IoT), Atmel offers dual-band 2.4 GHz/5 GHz a/b/g Wi-Fi chips from its Ozmo acquisition. Also, Atmel offers 2.4 GHz b/g/n Wi-Fi chips WILC1000/WILC3000 and WINC1500 from its Newport Media, Inc acquisition. WINC1500 provide a full 802.11 b/g/n network controller with full ip stack TCP/IP, UDP with upper layer protocols as DHCP, DNS, HTTP, SNTP, TLS etc. Also, Atmel makes wireless transceivers using regional 700/800/900 MHz, as well as global 2.4 GHz frequency bands, Some chips are standalone transceivers while others are integrated with a microcontroller. They also sell the Zigbit module that comes with FCC certifications. Atmel also makes remote control RF products using the license-free ISM band (industrial scientific medical) frequencies (5.8 GHz, 2.4 GHz, 868 to 928 MHz, 433 MHz, and 315 MHz). The wireless segment also provides RFID chips for tracking, access and identification. Finally, Atmel offers a line of IR controllers that can support infrared as well as RF wireless.

===Touchscreen===

Atmel makes both touchscreen controller ICs and its XSense flexible touchscreen. The company makes sensor hubs that manage accelerometers, gyroscopes, inertial measurement units and magnetometers. These sensors give consumer products and embedded systems context awareness. The sensor hub offloads the main application processor and allows product functionality without the need to power the main processor. Atmel also makes simple touch controller chips for buttons, sliders, and wheels used on industrial and consumer products. To support the application of its touch controller chips, Atmel provides a free QTouch library of software routines.

===Memory===
Atmel&#x27;s original business was in memory, and it still sells several memory products. It offers serial and parallel EEPROM, as well as one-time programmable (OTP) EPROM. In addition, it offers secure memory with its CryptoMemory product line of EEPROMS in capacities from 1 to 256 kbits.

===Security===
In addition to the secure memory mentioned above, they have the CryptoAuthentication product lines that provide hardware authentication capability with both symmetric and asymmetric-key algorithm authentication. These ICs are used in many applications, including secure access, communications, control, and to prevent cloned products like batteries or ink cartridges not approved by the product manufacturer. Atmel&#x27;s CryptoRF products add hardware encrypted security to RFID applications. Finally Atmel offers a trusted platform module that gives strong hardware-based public key (RSA algorithm) security for both personal computers and embedded processors on a single chip.

===Analog===
Atmel makes LED driver chips. It also has a line of digital-output temperature sensors. The company also makes power management and analog companions (PMAAC) that combine a group of discrete ICs often used in handheld or battery-powered products. Integrated functions include audio codecs (compressor-decompressor), lithium-ion battery chargers, and stereo digital-to-analog converters.

===Custom===
These products include custom integrated circuits designed to meet specialized single-customer requirements. Products include FPGAs, products with military and aerospace applications, and application-specific standard products (ASSP) for space applications, power management, and secure cryptographic memory products.

===Automotive===
Atmel modified or specialized many of its products for the automotive market. These products often have a wider temperature range or are specially qualified for automotive applications. These products include car access, touch control, radio, CAN, VAN, and LIN Bus networking, battery management, high-temperature drivers, and serial EEPROMs.

===Smart energy===
Atmel also has chips specialized for the smart energy and smart metering markets. These chips combine microprocessors with tamper-proof hardware security and power line communication modems. The parts also integrate analog front-ends for accurate metrology.

==Attractions==
Finland is famous for its many lakes, nearly 200,000 of them (larger than 500 m2/0.12 acres). Tampere is the biggest city on the Finnish Lakeland with other major cities being Jyväskylä, Mikkeli, Lahti, Joensuu, Lappeenranta, Kuopio, and Savonlinna. Finland is also known to have excellent water quality, and green deep woods and forests around the sea, rivers, and the waterways.

In wintertime, Finland provides opportunities for cross-country skiing and alpine skiing. Many of the popular ski resorts are situated north of the Arctic Circle in Lapland, but there are exceptions like Kuusamo in the northeastern part of Oulu Province and Himos in Jämsä, only north of Helsinki.

Throughout Finland, Santa Claus (&quot;Joulupukki&quot;) is commonly considered to live on the Korvatunturi fell in Lapland. In addition, the largest town in Finnish Lapland, Rovaniemi, has two theme parks dedicated to the character: Santa Claus Village and Santa Park. Finnish Lapland (Rovaniemi and surroundings) is also the best place in the country to see the aurora borealis.

Another theme park in the country is Moomin World, located in the outskirts of Naantali. The park is based on the popular &quot;Moomins&quot; franchise, created by Tove Jansson.

The biggest picnic of the year called Vappu is held on April 30 - May 1. The celebration happens in every city and village across the country.

== Northern Finland and winter sports ==

Northern Finland, mainly Lapland, has a strong profile as an internationally popular winter holiday destination, which is why the nickname &quot;winter wonderland&quot; has also been used. In the winter there is a large snowcastle with an Ice hotel built every year in the northern town of Kemi. Rovaniemi is a place from which to see the aurora borealis or northern lights. Tourists in the north of the country in winter often enjoy trips in reindeer sleighs with Sami drivers, in dog sleighs, or on snowmobiles.

It is also possible to ski, with downhill resorts at Saariselkä and Levi, and many cross country ski tracks throughout the northern part of the country. Ice hockey is a popular sport in winter, and it is possible to go ice yachting, or ice skating on the ice. Most lakes are also frozen, so ice fishing (&quot;pilkkiminen&quot;) is quite popular.

== Cities ==

Helsinki, Finland&#x27;s capital and largest city, receives many visitors year-round. During the summertime thousands of tourists approach Helsinki by cruising boats travelling across the Baltic Sea. Helsinki is known as a clean, modern, and safe meeting point between the east and west.

Other popular tourist destinations within Finland include Tampere, Jyväskylä, Turku, Oulu, Kuopio, Rovaniemi, and Porvoo.

=== Helsinki ===
Helsinki is the capital and largest city in the country, although it is relatively small compared to other European capitals.

Because Helsinki is located on the coast of the Baltic Sea and has many kilometres of coastline, most of its central districts are near the seaside. Helsinki is considered a maritime city and is popularly called &quot;the daughter of the Baltic&quot;.

Helsinki&#x27;s coastal position makes it ideal to experience in the summertime from one of the many sightseeing ferries leaving from the port of Helsinki. Many of Helsinki&#x27;s main attractions are also related to the sea, including the Suomenlinna naval fortress (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) and the Seurasaari Island with its parks and open-air museum. Locals often spend sunny days at the Hietaniemi beach (often simply called &quot;Hietsu&quot;), Helsinki&#x27;s main beach in the district of Töölö.

In the winter-time Helsinki&#x27;s northern position makes it dark for most of the day, with lighting fixtures such as Aleksanterinkatu&#x27;s Christmas street (&quot;Joulukatu&quot;). During the coldest months of the winter, it is very common for locals to go for walks on the frozen sea, although authorities recommend caution when the ice is thin. There are also many places for ice swimming along the coast, some with saunas.

Air travel to Helsinki is via Helsinki Airport, situated in the neighboring city of Vantaa, a city part of the Helsinki metropolitan area. Helsinki also has popular cruiseferry links with Stockholm, Sweden and Tallinn, Estonia. Silja, Viking and Tallink are the biggest ferry operators.

Helsinki is also the home of the Linnanmäki amusement park, which features five rollercoasters and many other rides, including the world&#x27;s first Intamin ZacSpin rollercoaster.

Helsinki is a safe city for tourists and a safe place to live. In terms of personal safety, Finland was ranked 14 out of 163 countries according to Global Peace Index 2019.

Helsinki also has efficient tourist information system maintained by the City of Helsinki Tourism &amp; Convention Bureau located in the city center next to the Esplanadi park.

Helsinki was ranked 10th of the most expensive cities in the world according to UBS Group AG&#x27;s Prices and Earnings report for 2018. Travelers should plan to spend around US$216 or €199 per day on their vacation in Helsinki, which is the average daily cost of staying in a 4-star hotel, visiting 2 popular attractions, using public transportation, and eating out in mid-range restaurants with a glass of wine included.

=== Tampere ===

Tampere, also known as the &quot;Manchester of Finland&quot;, has often been rated as the most popular city in Finland; perhaps it is precisely for this reason that over the years it has grown into Finland&#x27;s second largest and the second best-known Finnish city in the world after Helsinki. The old industrial city built on between lakes Näsijärvi and Pyhäjärvi, and along Tammerkoski rapids has also proved to be quite a significant tourist destination with its various national and international events, museums (such as Moomin Museum) market places (such as Tampere Market Hall) and, of course, its Särkänniemi amusement park, not to mention the world-acclaimed nature in Tampere. Tampere&#x27;s local traditional food &quot;mustamakkara&quot; in particular has aroused a lot of interest in the world, all the way to celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain. Tampere also have been officially declared the &quot;Sauna Capital of the World&quot;.

Many of Finland&#x27;s most important highways between different cities intersect at Tampere, such as the Helsinki-Tampere Highway (part of E12). Also, air travel to Tampere is via Tampere-Pirkkala Airport, situated in the neighbouring municipality of Pirkkala, a part of the Tampere metropolitan area.

Tampere is also known for several educational institutions, such as University of Applied Sciences and Police University College; the Tampere University, like the city, is also the second largest of its kind in Finland.

=== Jyväskylä ===

Lonely Planet calls Jyväskylä as a Mecca for architecture lovers around the world for its large collection of Alvar Aalto buildings. The city is the biggest city on Finnish Lakeland and capital of Central Finland. Later, a modern architect Arto Sipinen, a pupil of Aalto, has influenced in the cityscape since the 1970s by designing most of the new university buildings in the city.

The Alvar Aalto Museum and the Museum of Central Finland form a centre of culture in the immediate vicinity of the historical campus of the University of Jyväskylä. Both museums are designed by a functionalist Alvar Aalto. The Alvar Aalto Museum displays the artist&#x27;s most important work and design. The Museum of Central Finland specializes in cultural history. It serves both as the town museum of Jyväskylä and the provincial museum of Central Finland. Nokkakivi Amusement Park is about 20 km from Jyväskylä.

One of architect Aalto&#x27;s most significant works Säynätsalo Town Hall is located in Säynätsalo island on Lake Päijänne.

The city hosts the Neste Oil Rally Finland (formerly known as 1000 Lakes Rally). It is the biggest annually organised public event in the Nordic countries, gathering over 500,000 spectators every year. The rally has been held since 1951, first as a national competition, then from 1959 on as a European Rally Championship event and since the introduction of the World Rally Championship in 1973, as Finland&#x27;s WRC event.

UNESCO World Heritage site Petäjävesi Old Church is located in vicinity of Jyväskylä.

=== Porvoo ===

Porvoo has often been called an authentic small town and has been chosen as one of the most beautiful towns in Finland on several occasions. The city is one of the six medieval towns in Finland, first mentioned as a city in texts from the 14th century. At the beginning of the 19th century, the city played an important role in connection with the Diet of Porvoo, when Finland, which at that time was part of the Russian Empire, gained autonomy in the form of the Grand Duchy of Finland.

The Porvoo Old Town is a popular tourist destination, known for its well-preserved 18th and 19th century buildings and 15th century cathedral, the Porvoo Cathedral. The Old Town together with Porvoo River River Valley is recognized as historically and culturally significant as one of the National landscapes of Finland. Porvoo is also culturally important in that many of the most significant writers, starting with J. L. Runeberg, are largely from Porvoo or its immediate sub-region municipalities (such as Johannes Linnankoski from Askola).

Attempts have been made to make the Porvoo Old Town a UNESCO World Heritage site, but so far it has not been qualified.

== Cuisine ==
Finnish cuisine includes fresh ingredients, particularly game and fish, foraged berries and mushrooms such as false morels, and even reindeer. Alcoholic drinks of note are Koskenkorva, the salty liquorice-flavored Salmiakki Koskenkorva and cloudberry liqueur.

== Transportation ==
The Finnish rail system is called VR. It offers InterCity and express trains throughout the country, and the faster Pendolino trains connecting the major cities. There are very large discounts (usually 50%) available for children (7-16 yr), students, senior citizens, and conscripts. Connections to Sweden are by bus due to rail gauge differences. It&#x27;s possible to take the Silja, Tallink and Viking Line ferries from Helsinki to Mariehamn in the Åland archipelago, Stockholm (Sweden), Rostock and Travemünde in Germany, and to Tallinn, (Estonia). Wasaline operates the ferry route from Vaasa to Holmsund in Umeå.

There are about 25 airports in Finland with scheduled passenger services. Finnair, Blue1 and Finncomm Airlines provide air services both domestically and internationally. Helsinki-Vantaa airport is Finland&#x27;s global gateway with scheduled non-stop flights to such places as Bangkok, Beijing, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Miami, Nagoya, New Delhi, New York, Osaka, Seoul, Shanghai, Tokyo and Istanbul. Helsinki has an optimal location for great circle airline traffic routes between Western Europe and the Far East. Hence, many foreign tourists visit Helsinki on a stop-over while flying from Asia to Europe or vice versa. The Helsinki-Vantaa Airport was ranked 18th in the Skytrax World&#x27;s Top 100 Airports survey.

<text>Prignitz () is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in northwestern Brandenburg, in northeastern Germany. Neighboring districts, clockwise from the north, are Ludwigslust-Parchim (in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania), Ostprignitz-Ruppin (Brandenburg), Stendal (Saxony-Anhalt), and Lüchow-Dannenberg (Lower Saxony).

==Geography==
The term Prignitz originally meant the region north of the confluence of the Elbe and Havel rivers. This region is larger than the district. It also includes the town of Havelberg in Saxony-Anhalt and large portions of the neighbouring district of Ostprignitz-Ruppin.

The Elbe river forms the southwestern border of the district.

==History==
The historical region Prignitz consisted of the following eleven districts, established in the 13th century: Wittenberge, Lenzen, Perleberg, Putlitz, Kyritz, Nitzow, Wittstock, Pritzwalk, Havelberg, Wusterhausen and Grabow.

The present district of Prignitz was created in 1993 by merging the previous districts of Pritzwalk and Perleberg and a few municipalities from the district Kyritz. The westernmost part of the district was previously part of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and became part of Brandenburg on August 1, 1992.

The earlier district of Prignitz was the buffer between Brandenburg and Mecklenburg. It was resettled by Germans, especially from the Bremen area, following the First Wendish Crusade of 1147. The rate of German settlement increased over the following decades. The eastern half was dominated by the pro-German counts von Plotho who brought their own vassals such as the von Blumenthal and von Grabow families with them. The western half was dominated by robber barons, especially the Gans zu Putlitz family and their vassals, the von Quitzows. In 1319 the territory was briefly controlled by Mecklenburg. When Frederick, Count of Zollern was appointed Margrave in 1411, he faced an uprising of the Wendish nobility, supported by the Wendish Duke of Mecklenburg. However, he was able to put down the revolt at the battle of the Cremmer Dam, with the support of the German nobility. Families who had stayed loyal were rewarded. Otto von Blumenthal, for example, was made Captain of the Prignitz from 1415 to 1422 and of Lenzen from 1420.

== Demography ==


==Coat of arms==

The coat of arms shows a goose preparing for flight, the symbol of the Gans zu Putlitz family (&quot;Gans&quot; is German for goose), who in the 12th century were one of a number of families (such as the von Plotho, von Blumenthal and von Arnim families) who introduced Christianity and German culture to Prignitz. The pearls around the goose symbolize Perleberg (which translates to &quot;Pearl Mountain&quot;). The wolf at bottom stands for the former administrative seat, Pritzwalk, as &quot;walk&quot; derives from the Slavonic &quot;wolk&quot; meaning wolf. The wavy separation between the top and bottom symbolizes the river Elbe; the colors red and white are those of Brandenburg.

<text>Tourism in Russia plummeted in 2022. Only 200,100 foreigners visited Russia in 2022, a drop of 96.1% from pre-pandemic/pre-Russian invasion of Ukraine years. Earlier, Russia had seen rapid growth since the late Soviet times, first domestic tourism and then international tourism as well. Russia had formerly been among the most popular tourist destinations in the world, though it fell off that list in 2022. Not including Crimea, the country contains 23 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, while more are on UNESCO&#x27;s tentative lists.

Tourist routes in Russia include a travel around the Golden Ring of ancient cities, cruises on the rivers including the Volga, and long journeys on the Trans-Siberian Railway. Diverse regions and ethnic cultures of Russia offer different foods and souvenirs, and show a variety of traditions, including Russian Maslenitsa, Tatar Sabantuy, or Siberian shamanist rituals. In 2013, Russia was visited by 33 million tourists, making it the ninth-most visited country in the world and the seventh-most visited in Europe.

== History ==

After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, several governments, including the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada have issued travel advisories calling on their nationals to avoid travel to Russia. For the same reason, airline routes between Russia and Western countries were closed, and supply of spare parts for some domestic airline traffic inside Russia became a challenge.

Only 200,100 foreigners visited Russia in 2022, a drop of 96.1 percent from the pre-pandemic period. Most of Europe closed its airspace to Russian planes a few days after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Foreign-issued Visa and Mastercard cards no longer work in Russia, further impacting tourism.

== Cultural tourism ==
Tourist destinations in Russia include Saint Petersburg (which appeared in the list of top visited cities of Europe in 2010) and Moscow, the current and the former capitals of the country. Moscow and Saint Petersburg museums such as Hermitage and Tretyakov Gallery, theaters including Bolshoi and Mariinsky, churches such as Saint Basil&#x27;s Cathedral, Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, Saint Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral and Church of the Savior on Blood, fortifications such as the Kremlin and Peter and Paul Fortress, squares such as Red Square and Palace Square, and streets such as Tverskaya and Nevsky Prospect. Palaces and parks are found in the former in the suburbs of Moscow (Kolomenskoye, Tsaritsyno) and Saint Petersburg (Peterhof, Strelna, Oranienbaum, Gatchina, Pavlovsk Palace, Tsarskoye Selo). Moscow contains Soviet-era buildings along with modern skyscrapers, while Saint Petersburg has classical architecture, rivers, channels and bridges.

Nizhny Novgorod is the capital of the Volga region. Nizhny Novgorod is divided into two parts by the Oka River. The &quot;Upper City&quot; is its historical part. The &quot;Lower City&quot; is its industrial and commercial part. Here are the Fair, the old Sormovo and Kanavino, GAZ and Sotsgorod (the so-called &quot;city in the city&quot;), the railway terminal, and the airport.

Kazan, the capital of Tatarstan, shows a mix of Christian Russian and Muslim Tatar cultures.

Sakha Republic proposes to use former forced labour camps as a tourist attraction.
Poles visit places of Communist crimes, e.g., of the Katyn massacre and Solovetsky Islands.

=== Museums ===
Russia is home to museums that include the Tretyakov Gallery, the Kremlin Armoury and the State Historical Museum in Moscow, the Hermitage Museum, and the Russian Museum in St Petersburg, the Kazan Kremlin in Kazan, etc. Russia has museums related to its literary and classical music heritage, such as Yasnaya Polyana associated with Leo Tolstoy, the Mikhaylovskoye Museum Reserve associated with Alexander Pushkin, the Dostoyevsky Museum, the Tchaikovsky State House-Museum, and the Rimsky-Korsakov Apartment and Museum.

Museums related to Russia&#x27;s military history and military hardware include the Central Museum of the Great Patriotic War on Poklonnaya Hill, the Central Naval Museum in St Petersburg, the Battle of Stalingrad Museum in Volgograd. Museums related to science and technology include the Polytechnic Museum of Moscow, and the Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics.

The GULAG History Museum tells the story about the GULAG camps in Siberia.
== Nature tourism ==
In Russia, Nature Reserves have history and it has its own word of definition Zapovedniks (, plural заповедники, ) more than 100 Nature Reserves exist in Russia and more than 50 National Parks.
National parks and sanctuaries of Russia include the Baikal Nature Reserve, the Altai Nature Reserve, the Lazovsky Nature Reserve, the Kedrovaya Pad Nature Reserve, the Curonian Spit National Park, the Valdaysky National Park, the Baikal-Lena Nature Reserve, the Ilmen Nature Reserve.
The Seven Wonders of Russia include Lake Baikal, Valley of Geysers, Manpupuner rock formations, Kizhi Island, and Mount Elbrus
Other areas include Republic of Adygea where Fisht Mountain is located, Chechnya Republic where Lake Kezenoyam is located.
==Health tourism==

Mineral spa resorts have been established across Russia in such regions as Kamchatka Krai, Altai Krai, Krasnodar Krai, Stavropol Krai, North Caucasus region of Russia. Some cites have natural hot spring water during winter and some of Russian cities are called Russian Spa town, including Pyatigorsk, Yessentuki, Kislovodsk, Zheleznovodsk and Mineralnye Vody; these towns are jointly known as the Caucasian Mineral Waters.

Russia has one of the largest water borders in world, but only the more Southern regions are suitable for resort tourism. The warm subtropical Black Sea coast of Russia is the site for some seaside resorts such as Sochi and Tuapse.

===Winter sport===
A vast part of Russian territory is in Subarctic climate and humid continental climate, and that is why it is cold. In addition, Russia is mountainous in regions like Northern Caucasus, Altai Krai and Kamchatka Peninsula. The Highest peak in Europe, Mount Elbrus, is in Russia, which makes Russia a place for Winter sport. Ski resorts are in Russia. A ski resort in Russia is Sochi and its Krasnaya Polyana. Other ski resorts in Russia are Dombay in Karachay–Cherkessia in Northern Caucasus.
== Medical tourism ==
Russia is a destination for medical tourism. A factor in its popularity was the relatively weak ruble post-2014, which saw the industry grow from some 110 thousand clients in 2017 to some 728 thousand clients in the first five months of 2020. Stomatology is the most used (44% of patients), genecology and urology follow (25% taken together), the other services are plastic surgery (10%), ophthalmology (10%), and cardiology (5%). Most clients come from the CIS states, where receiving high-tech medical assistance can be problematic, particularly from Central Asia, which amounts for 62% of all patients; but also from Eastern Europe (32%), South and East Asia (5%). In addition to price and accessibility of complex manipulations, the difference in regulations between Russia and the clients&#x27; own nations is a driving factor for receiving care in Russia: for instance, in vitro fertilization is illegal in China, but legal in Russia.

== Religious tourism ==
Religious tourism has two main subtypes: pilgrimage, as travel done for religious or spiritual purposes, and the viewing of religious monuments and artefacts, as a kind of sightseeing. The former is relatively insignificant for the Russian tourism industry, amounting for approximately 100 thousands pilgrims yearly. The latter is more important. Orthodox Christianity being the most common religion in Russia, it also accounts for most religious monuments across the country.

Multiple pieces of Islamic religious architectural art are scattered across the country, from mosques to maqāms. They are mostly clustered in the historically Muslim regions.

Russia has a Buddhist minority.

== Foreign travel statistics ==
In 2013, 27 million international tourists arrived in Russia, generating US$11.2 billion in international tourism revenue for the country. Including domestic and international tourism, the industry directly contributed RUB860 billion to the Russian GDP and supported 966,500 jobs in the country.

However, only 200,100 foreigners visited Russia in 2022, a drop of 96.1 percent.

<text>[[Ukraine]] used to attract more than 20 million foreign citizens every year (23 million in 2012). But since 2014 this has lowered to about 10 million. Visitors primarily come from Eastern Europe, but also from Western Europe, as well as Turkey and Israel.

Before the Russo-Ukrainian War, Ukraine occupied 8th place in Europe by the number of tourists visiting, according to the World Tourism Organization rankings. Ukraine has numerous tourist attractions: mountain ranges suitable for skiing, hiking and fishing: the Black Sea coastline as a popular summer destination; nature reserves of different ecosystems; churches, castle ruins and other architectural and park landmarks; various outdoor activity points. Kyiv, Lviv, Odesa and Kamyanets-Podilskyi were Ukraine&#x27;s principal tourist centres each offering many historical landmarks as well as formidable hospitality infrastructure. Tourism used to be the mainstay of Crimea&#x27;s economy, but there was a major fall in visitor numbers following the Russian annexation in 2014.

The Seven Wonders of Ukraine and Seven Natural Wonders of Ukraine are the selection of the most important landmarks of Ukraine, chosen by the general public through an Internet-based vote.

Ukraine is a destination on the crossroads between central and eastern Europe, between north and south. It borders Russia and is not far from Turkey. It has mountain ranges – the Carpathian Mountains suitable for skiing, hiking, fishing and hunting. The coastline on the Black Sea is a popular summer destination for vacationers. Ukraine has vineyards where they produce native wines, ruins of ancient castles, historical parks, Orthodox, Catholic and Protestant churches as well as a few mosques and synagogues. Kyiv, the country&#x27;s capital city has many unique structures such as Saint Sophia Cathedral and broad boulevards. There are other cities well known to tourists, such as the harbour town Odesa and the old city of Lviv in the west. Most of Western Ukraine, which used to be within the borders of the Republic of Poland before World War II, is a popular destination for Poles. Crimea, a little &quot;continent&quot; of its own, had been a popular vacation destination for tourists for swimming or sun tanning on the Black Sea with its warm climate, rugged mountains, plateaus and ancient ruins, though the tourist trade has been severely affected by Russia&#x27;s occupation and annexation of the territory in 2014. Cities there include: Sevastopol and Yalta – location of the peace conference at the end of World War II. Visitors can also take cruise tours by ship on the Dnieper River from Kyiv to the Black Sea coastline. Ukrainian cuisine has a long history and offers a wide variety of original dishes.

The country&#x27;s tourism industry is generally considered to be underdeveloped, but it does provide crucial support for Ukraine&#x27;s economy. Ukraine does have certain advantages, including much lower costs than other European destinations, as well as visa-free access for most people from Europe, the former Soviet Union, and North America. Since 2005 citizens of European Union and EFTA, United States, Canada, Japan and South Korea no longer require a visa to visit Ukraine for tourism purposes. Additionally, no visa is required from most countries of the former Soviet Union with the exceptions of Russia and Turkmenistan.

<text>Klaipėda ( ; ) is a city in Lithuania on the Baltic Sea coast. It is the third-largest city in Lithuania, the fifth-largest city in the Baltic States, and the capital of Klaipėda County, as well as the only major seaport in the country - the Port of Klaipėda which is also the busiest port in the Baltic States.

The city has a complex recorded history, partially due to the combined regional importance of the usually ice-free port at the mouth of the river . Located in Lithuania Minor, and the State of the Teutonic Order and Duchy of Prussia under the suzerainty of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, then the Kingdom of Prussia and German Empire, within which it was the northernmost big city until it was placed under French occupation in 1919. From 1923, the city was part of Lithuania until its annexation by Nazi Germany in 1939, and after World War II it was part of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. Klaipėda has remained within Lithuania since 1944.

The city continues to experience sustained demographic decline due to flight towards the suburbs and other cities. The number of inhabitants of Klaipėda city shrank from 202,929 in 1989 to 162,360 in 2011, but the urban zone of Klaipėda expanded well into the suburbs, which sprang up around the city and surrounded it from three sides. These are partly integrated with the city (city bus lines, city water supply, etc.), and the majority of inhabitants of these suburbs work in Klaipėda. According to data from the Department of Statistics, there are 212,302 permanent inhabitants (as of 2020) in the Klaipėda city and Klaipėda district municipalities combined. Popular seaside resorts found close to Klaipėda are Neringa to the south on the Curonian Spit and Palanga to the north.

The city is also known for the annual Klaipėda Sea Festival and a nearby .

==Names==

The Teutonic Knights built a castle in the *Pilsāts Land of the Curonians and named it &quot;Memelburg&quot;, which would later be shortened to &quot;Memel&quot;. From 1252 to 1923 and from 1939 to 1945, the town and city were officially named &quot;Memel&quot;. Between 1923 and 1939, both names were in official use. Since 1945, the Lithuanian name of &quot;Klaipėda&quot; has been used.

The names &quot;Memelburg&quot; and &quot;Memel&quot; are found in most written sources from the 13th century onwards, while &quot;Klaipėda&quot; is found in Lithuanian sources since the 15th century. The city was initially mentioned as &quot;Caloypede&quot; in the letter of Vytautas in 1413, and in negotiation documents from 1420, the city was named &quot;Klawppeda.&quot; In the Treaty of Melno of 1422, the city&#x27;s name was listed as &quot;Cleupeda&quot;. According to Samogitian folk etymology, the name &quot;Klaipėda&quot; refers to the boggy terrain of the town (&quot;klaidyti&quot;=obstruct and &quot;pėda&quot;=foot). Most likely, the name is of Curonian origin and means &quot;even ground&quot;; it likely originates from a combination of &quot;klais/klait&quot; (flat, open, free) and &quot;peda&quot; (sole of the foot, ground), as a reference to relatively flat terrain of the original settlement&#x27;s surroundings. 

The lower reaches of the river Neman were named either *&quot;Mēmele&quot; or *&quot;Mēmela&quot; by Scalovians and local Curonian inhabitants. In the Latvian Curonian language, it means &quot;mute, silent&quot; (&quot;memelis, mimelis, mēms&quot;), as a reference to peaceful flow of the Neman. This name was adopted by German speakers, and also was chosen for the new city founded further away at the lagoon.

The name of the city in the Samogitian language is spelled slightly differently: . The most notable non-Lithuanian names include: ; ; ; .

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of Klaipėda is also used as the coat of arms of the Klaipėda city municipality. The modern version was created by the designer Kęstutis Mickevičius. The modern coat of arms was created by restoring old seals of the Memel city (analogous with those used in the years 1446, 1605 and 1618). It was affirmed on 1 July 1992.

==History==

A settlement of Baltic tribes in the territory of the present-day city is said to have existed in the region as early as the 7th century. Klaipėda is the oldest city which is in modern Lithuanian territory. The Balts initially established Klaipėda as a trading centre for the storage of goods and annual fairs with the Germans.

===Teutonic Knights===
In the 1240s, Pope Gregory IX offered King Håkon IV of Norway the opportunity to conquer the peninsula of Sambia. However, after Grand Duke Mindaugas of Lithuania, the Teutonic Knights and a group of crusaders from Lübeck moved into Sambia and accepted Christianity. These groups founded a fort in 1252 called &quot;Memele castrum&quot; (or &quot;Memelburg&quot;, &quot;Memel Castle&quot;). The fort&#x27;s construction was completed in 1253, and Memel was garrisoned with troops of the Teutonic Order, administered by Deutschmeister Eberhard von Seyne. Documents for its founding were signed by Eberhard and Bishop Heinrich von Lützelburg of Courland on 29 July 1252 and 1 August 1252.


Master Conrad von Thierberg used the fortress as a base for further campaigns along the river Neman and against Samogitia. Memel was unsuccessfully besieged by Sambians in 1255, and the Sambians surrendered in 1259. Memel was also colonized by settlers from Holstein, Lübeck and Dortmund. Hence, Memel also being known at the time as &quot;Neu-Dortmund&quot;, or &quot;New Dortmund&quot;. It became the main town of the Diocese of Curonia, with a cathedral and at least two parochial churches, but the development of the castle became the dominant priority. According to different sources, Memel received Lübeck city rights in 1254 or 1258. Following it Klaipėda&#x27;s status was quite extraordinary as only three cities in the State of the Teutonic Order had Lübeck city rights.

In the spring and summer of 1323, a Lithuanian army led by Grand Duke Gediminas came up the Neman and sieged the castle of Memel, while later he marched to other Prussian, Latvian, Estonian territories controlled by the Order, eventually forcing the Order to sue for a truce in October 1323. While planning a campaign against Samogitia, Memel&#x27;s garrison of the Teutonic Order&#x27;s Livonian branch was replaced with knights from the Prussian branch in 1328. Threats and attacks by Lithuanians greatly slowed down the town&#x27;s development; the castle was sacked by Lithuanian tribes in 1360, and in 1379 the reconstructed castle and town were both sacked once again. In 1409, the castle was rebuilt and in 1422–1441 the strengthening of the castle&#x27;s fortifications continued when eventually its ramparts reached 7 meters height.

After the Battle of Grunwald, the dispute between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Teutonic Order on Samogitia started. Vytautas the Great wanted the border to be the Neman River, while the Teutonic Order wanted to have Veliuona and Klaipėda in the right side of the river. Both sides agreed to accept the prospective solution of Emperor Sigismund&#x27;s representative Benedict Makrai in 1413. He decided that the right side of Nemunas (Veliuona, Klaipėda) were to be owned by Lithuania. Makrai is known to have stated:

Nevertheless, no agreement was concluded and fighting continued until the Treaty of Melno in 1422 stabilized the border between the Teutonic Order and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania for the next 501 years. However, two miles of Lithuanian territories, including Klaipėda, was left for the Order. In 1454, King Casimir IV Jagiellon incorporated the region to the Kingdom of Poland upon the request of the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation. After the subsequent Thirteen Years&#x27; War (1454–1466) the city became a part of Poland as a fief held by the Teutonic Knights, and thus located within the Polish–Lithuanian union. The rebuilt town received Kulm law city rights in 1475.

=== Duchy of Prussia ===
Against the wishes of its governor and commander, Eric of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, Memel adopted Lutheranism after the conversion of Grand Master Albert of Prussia and the creation of the Duchy of Prussia as a fief of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland in 1525, soon part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Since then, Klaipėda has become the county centre within the Duchy of Prussia. It was the onset of a long period of prosperity for the city and port. Klaipėda served as a port for neighbouring Lithuania, benefiting from its location near the mouth of the Neman, with wheat as a profitable export. The Duchy of Prussia was inherited by a relative, John Sigismund, the Hohenzollern prince-electors of the Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1618. Brandenburg-Prussia began active participation in regional policy, which affected the development of Memel. From 1629 to 1635, the town was occupied by Sweden over several periods during the Polish-Swedish War of 1626–1629.

After the Treaty of Königsberg in 1656 during the Northern Wars, Elector Frederick William opened Memel&#x27;s harbor to Sweden, with whom the harbor&#x27;s revenue was divided. Sovereignty of the margraves of Brandenburg over the region was affirmed in the Treaty of Oliva in 1660.

The construction of a fortified defence system around the entire town, initiated in 1627, noticeably changed its status and prospects. In November 1678 a small Swedish army invaded the Prussian territory, but was unable to capture the fortress of Memel.

=== Kingdom of Prussia ===

By the beginning of the 18th century, Memel was one of the strongest fortresses (&quot;Memelfestung&quot;) in Prussia, and the town became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701. Despite its fortifications, it was captured by Russian troops during the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1757. Consequently, from 1757 to 1762 the town, along with the rest of eastern Prussia, was dependent on the Russian Empire. After this war ended, the maintenance of the fortress was neglected, but the town&#x27;s growth continued.

Memel became part of the newly formed province of East Prussia within the Kingdom of Prussia in 1773. In the second half of the 18th century, Memel&#x27;s lax customs and Riga&#x27;s high duties enticed English traders, who established the first industrial sawmills in the town. In 1784, 996 ships arrived in Memel, 500 of which were English. The specialisation in wood manufacturing guaranteed Memel&#x27;s merchants income and stability for more than a hundred years. During this era, it also normalised its trade relations with Königsberg; regional instability had degraded relations since the 16th century.
Memel prospered during the second half of the 18th century by exporting timber to Great Britain for use by the Royal Navy. In 1792, 756 British ships visited the town to transport lumber from forests near Memel. In 1800, its imports consisted chiefly of salt, iron and herrings; the exports, which greatly exceeded the imports, were corn, hemp, flax, and, particularly, timber. The 1815 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; stated that Memel was &quot;provided with the finest harbour in the Baltic&quot;.

During the Napoleonic Wars, Memel became the temporary capital of the Kingdom of Prussia. Between 1807 and 1808, the town was the residence of King Frederick William III, his consort Louise, his court, and the government. On 9 October 1807 the king signed a document in Memel, later called the October Edict, which abolished serfdom in Prussia. It originated the reforms of Karl Freiherr vom und zum Stein and Karl August von Hardenberg. The land around Memel suffered major economic setbacks under Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s Continental System. During Napoleon&#x27;s retreat from Moscow after the failed invasion of Russia in 1812, General Yorck refused Marshal MacDonald&#x27;s orders to fortify Memel at Prussia&#x27;s expense.

During the January Uprising, in June 1863, Polish insurgents made an unsuccessful attempt at a naval landing near the city&#x27;s harbor.

=== German Empire ===
After the unification of Germany into the German Empire in 1871, Memel became Germany&#x27;s northernmost city.

The development of the town in the 19th century was influenced by the Industrial Revolution in Prussia, as well as urbanisation. Even though the population of Memel increased fourfold during the 19th century, and had risen to 21,470 by 1910, its pace of development lagged in comparison. The reasons for this were mostly political. Memel was the northernmost and easternmost city in Germany, and although the government was engaged in a very costly tree-planting exercise to stabilise the sand-dunes on the Curonian Spit, most of the financial infusions in the province of East Prussia were concentrated in Königsberg, the capital of the province. Some notable instances of the German infrastructure investments in the area included sandbar blasting and a new ship canal between Pillau and Königsberg, which enabled vessels of up to 6.5 m draughts to moor alongside the city, at a cost of 13 million marks.

Owing to the absence of heavy industry in the 1870s and 1880s, the population of Memel stagnated, although wood manufacturing persisted as the main industry. It remained the central point of the Baltic timber-trade. A British Consul was located in the town in 1800; in 1900 a British Vice-Consul was recorded there, as well as a Lloyd&#x27;s Agent.
By 1900 steamer services had been established between Memel and Cranz (on the southern end of the Curonian Spit), and also between Memel and Tilsit. A main-line railway was built from Insterburg, the main East Prussian railway junction, to St. Petersburg via Eydtkuhnen, the Prussian frontier station. The Memel line also ran from Insterburg via Tilsit, where a further direct line connected with Königsberg, that crossed the Memel Valley over three bridges before its arrival in Memel.

During the second half of the 19th century, Memel was a center for the publication of books printed in the Lithuanian language using a Latin-script alphabet – these publications were prohibited in the nearby Russian Empire of which Lithuania was a province. The books were then smuggled over the Lithuanian border.

The German 1910 census lists the Memel Territory population as 149,766, of whom 67,345 declared Lithuanian to be their first language. The Germans greatly predominated in the town and port of Memel as well as in other nearby villages; the Lithuanian population was predominant in the area&#x27;s rural districts.

=== Inter-war years and World War II ===
Under the Treaty of Versailles after World War I, Klaipėda and the surrounding Klaipėda Region (Memel Territory) were detached from Germany and made a protectorate of the Entente States. The French became provisional administrators of the region until a more permanent solution could be worked out. Both Lithuania and Poland campaigned for their rights in the region. However, it seemed that the region would become a free city, similar to the Free City of Danzig. Not waiting for an unfavorable decision, the Lithuanians decided to stage the Klaipėda Revolt, take the region by force, and present the Entente with a &quot;fait accompli&quot;. The revolt was carried out in January 1923 while western Europe was distracted by the occupation of the Ruhr. The Germans tacitly supported the action, while the French offered only limited resistance. The revolt was supported by the Chief Rescue Committee of Lithuania Minor, chaired by Prussian Lithuanian Martynas Jankus, which operated since 22 December 1922 with its centre in Klaipėda. The League of Nations protested the revolt, but accepted the transfer in February 1923. The formal Klaipėda Convention was signed in Paris on 8 May 1924, securing extensive autonomy for the region.

The annexation of the city had significant consequences for the Lithuanian economy and foreign relations. The region subsequently accounted for up to 30% of Lithuania&#x27;s entire economic production. Between 70% and 80% of foreign trade passed through Klaipėda. The region, which represented only about 5% of Lithuania&#x27;s territory, contained a third of its industry.

Weimar Germany, under Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann, maintained normal relations with Lithuania. However, Nazi Germany desired to reacquire the region and tensions rose. Pro-German parties won clear supermajorities in all elections to the Klaipėda Parliament, which often clashed with the Lithuanian-appointed Klaipėda Directorate. Lithuanian efforts to &quot;re-Lithuanize&quot; Prussian Lithuanians by promoting the Lithuanian language, culture, education were often met with resistance from the locals. In 1932, a conflict between the Parliament and the Directorate had to be resolved by the Permanent Court of International Justice. In 1934–1935, the Lithuanians attempted to combat increasing Nazi influence in the region by arresting and prosecuting over 120 Nazi activists for the alleged plot to organize an anti-Lithuanian rebellion. Despite these rather harsh sentences, the defendants in the Neumann–Sass case were soon released under pressure from Nazi Germany. The extensive autonomy guaranteed by the Klaipėda Convention prevented Lithuania from blocking the growing pro-German attitudes in the region.
As tensions in pre-war Europe continued to grow, it was expected that Germany would make a move against Lithuania to reacquire the region. German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop delivered an ultimatum to the Lithuanian Foreign Minister on 20 March 1939, demanding the surrender of Klaipėda. Lithuania, unable to secure international support for its cause, submitted to the ultimatum and, in exchange for the right to use the new harbour facilities as a Free Port, ceded the disputed region to Germany in the late evening of 22 March 1939. Adolf Hitler visited the harbour and delivered a speech to the city residents. This was Hitler&#x27;s last territorial acquisition before World War II. During the war, the Germans operated a forced labour subcamp of the Stalag I-A prisoner-of-war camp for Allied prisoners of war in the city, and expelled Poles from German-occupied Poland were also enslaved as forced labour in the city&#x27;s vicinity.

=== 1945–present ===

During World War II, from the end of 1944 into 1945, the battle of Memel took place. The nearly empty city was captured by the Soviet Red Army on 28 January 1945 with only about 50 remaining people. After the war the Klaipėda Region was incorporated into the Lithuanian SSR, as the post-1937 German occupation of various regions of Europe, including Klaipėda, was considered illegal.

The Soviets turned Klaipėda, the foremost ice-free port in the Eastern Baltic, into the largest piscatorial-marine base in the European USSR. Shipyards, dockyards, and a fishing port were constructed. Subsequently, by the end of 1959, the population of the city had doubled its pre-war population, and by 1989 there were 202,900 inhabitants. Initially the Russian-speakers dominated local government in the city, but after the death of Joseph Stalin, more people came to the city from the rest of Lithuania than from other Soviet republics and oblasts; Lithuanians then became its major ethnic group. Among Lithuanian cities with a population greater than 100,000, however, Klaipėda has the highest percentage of people whose native language is Russian.
Until the 1970s, Klaipėda was only important to the USSR for its economy, while cultural and religious activity was minimal and restricted. The developers of a Roman Catholic church (Maria, Queen of Peace, constructed 1957–1962) were arrested. The city began to develop cultural activities in the 1970s and 1980s, such as the introduction of the Sea Festival cultural tradition, where thousands of people come to celebrate from all over the country. Based on the Pedagogical University of Šiauliai and the National Conservatory of Lithuania in Klaipėda, the University of Klaipėda was established in 1991. Klaipėda is now the home of a bilingual German-Lithuanian institution, the &quot;Hermann-Sudermann-Schule&quot;, as well as an English-language University, LCC International University.

In 2014 Klaipėda was visited 64 times by cruise ships, surpassing the Latvian capital, Riga, for the first time.

==Demographics==

Klaipėda was established as an outpost dedicated for German crusaders. Initially, Klaipėda developed slowly. In the 13th century, it was often attacked by the Sambians and Samogitians, and in the middle of the 15th century, it was attacked by the Gdańskians (for trading reasons). Consequently, in the 13th–15th centuries, Klaipėda was burned or ruined around 20 times.

In the second half of the 15th century, the residents began to settle in a territory of the Klaipėda Old Town, which was on a peninsula of the right bank of the old . Soon, the reconstruction of the Klaipėda Castle began, and all residents moved to the peninsula.

The development of Klaipėda was fueled by the increasing trade of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania with the Western countries. Around 1503, there were 25 families of full-fledged townspeople, while in 1540, there were 107 families. Eventually, in 1589, there were 143 families in Klaipėda. The Lithuanians and Curonians lived alongside the German colonists, but the magistrate did not allow non-Germans to join artisan corporations and did not grant them rights available to townspeople. In the State of the Teutonic Order, Old Prussians and Western Lithuanians were not allowed to engage in trade, crafts, and settle in cities. Thus, in the Duchy of Prussia, most of the cities&#x27; residents were Germans. Nevertheless, villages in Lithuania Minor were extensively inhabited by Lithuanians, and Klaipėda developed as one of the most important centres of Lithuania Minor. According to the Prussian Law, all native citizens were initially called as Prussians, while only in the 16th century classification of the population by nationality began. In 1525–1818, Klaipėda was part of the Lithuanian Province (the term was used in state legal documents and Prussian monarchs decrees), which comprised the most Lithuanian territories of Lithuania Minor (the Klaipėda, Tilsit, Ragainė, Įsrūtis counties).

There were few German colonists in Royal Prussia when Prussian monarchs were vassals of the Polish kings (1466–1660), and they mostly moved to cities and towns. During the Second Northern War in 1656–1657, Lithuania Minor was damaged by Tatars detached from the Army of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Following the Treaty of Oliva in 1660, Klaipėda become part of the Brandenburg-Prussia constituent state, which led to strengthened oppression of the locals of Lithuania Minor.
In 1701 the Kingdom of Prussia was created and Prussian officials and intellectuals propagated a political direction which claimed that a new nation formed from Prussian Lithuanians (&quot;Lietuvininkai&quot;), Old Prussians, and German colonists. In the beginning of the 18th century 300,000 residents lived in the core of Lithuania Minor and up to 100% of peasant farms in the Klaipėda Region were Lithuanian, however cities in Lithuania Minor become centres of Germanisation, cultural assimilation, and colonization. In 1700–1721 the Prussian Lithuanians population was dramatically decreased in Klaipėda and other Lithuanian counties by the Great Northern War plague outbreak which killed 160,000 (53%) of residents in Lithuania Minor (more than 90% of the deceased were Prussian Lithuanians). Following it, the Prussian authorities organized a large-scale German colonization of Lithuania Minor. The colonists received various privileges, however they constituted for only 13.4% of residents and quite a few of them later departed to other countries. In 1736–1818 Klaipėda was part of Lithuanian Department which had over 340,000 residents. The recovering population was ravaged by the Imperial Russian Army during the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1756–1763. In 1782 Klaipėda had 5500 residents, in 1790 – 6300.
In the General State Laws for the Prussian States (completed in 1794) the serfdom and privileged position of landlords and colonists was consolidated. During the Napoleonic Wars Napoleon I occupied most of the Kingdom of Prussia, thus in 1807–1808 Klaipėda was a residence of Prussian monarchs and in 1807 Frederick William III abolished serfdom. Following the abolishment of serfdom Prussian Lithuanians migrated to Klaipėda, especially its outskirts, and in 1837 they constituted 10.1% of the residents. In 1825 Klaipėda had 8,500 residents. Moreover, after the Uprising of 1863–1864 part of the Lithuanian insurgents retreated to Lithuania Minor. In 1855 was added to the city of Klaipėda, thus the number of population increased to over 17,000 and in 1875 reached ~20,000. Before World War I, the majority of Lithuanians in Königsberg Region (which included Klaipėda) integrated into the German nation. In March 1915 the population of Klaipėda was yet again ravaged by the Imperial Russian Army.
Following the Klaipėda Revolt in 1923, Klaipėda Region was incorporated into Lithuania and Lithuanian population in Klaipėda increased due to migration (Lithuanians constituted 30.3% and Germans 57.3% of Klaipėda&#x27;s 35,845 population in 1925). German politicians promoted a Memellander ideology and argued that Germans and local Lithuanians were &quot;two ethnicities (&quot;Volkstümer&quot;), yet one cultural community (&quot;Kulturgemeinschaft&quot;)&quot;. Lithuania ceded Klaipėda Region to Nazi Germany due to the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania, however soon World War II started and residents of Klaipėda were evacuated to Germany. In the aftermath of World War II almost all the new residents moved to Klaipėda from Lithuania, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, replacing the former German-speaking population (after the war only six old residents remained in the city). Over the years the Lithuanian population in the city continued to grow and constituted: 55.2% in 1959, 60.9% in 1970, 61.5% in 1979, 63.0% in 1989, 71.3% in 2001, 73.9% in 2011.

, the population of Klaipėda was 154,332. The latest data shows that there are more women in the city: females make up 54.89% (84,717), males make up 45.11% (69,615). In 2022, Lithuanians constituted 80% of the population in Klaipėda.

==Religion==
The first church (possibly chapel) dedicated to the military garrison was built along with the Klaipėda Castle in 1252 and was consecrated after Mary, mother of Jesus, although it did not have as much effect for the townspeople, as well as the residents of surrounding villages. Initially, it was planned that Klaipėda would become centre of the Bishopric of Courland. Thus, before 1290, a St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral was built in the town and a six-members chapter settled down in 1290. Nevertheless, the cathedral also did not have much effect on the town&#x27;s religious life in long-term as bishop waived his rights to the cathedral in 1298. Eventually, the cathedral was moved to Windau.

Eberhard von Sayn, the Teutonic Grand Marshal, and , the Bishop of Courland, agreed in a treaty to build two churches: one for German colonists (Church of St. John), the other for baptized natives (Church of St. Nicholas). The Church of St. Nicholas was large (with 10 windows) and served residents of many neighborhoods. The church services were held in Latin and sermons were given in German, but there also were translators into the language of the local people who had a dedicated place near the pulpit.
Following the creation of the Duchy of Prussia in 1525 and due to the Reformation movement, the Evangelical faith was spread in the languages of the local people, including Lithuanian. In 1620, the Lithuanian Parish of Klaipėda became an independent unit, but in 1627, the Church of St. Nicholas was demolished due to necessity to build a city wall around a growing city and the parish was left without its own church. The construction of a new church for the Lithuanian Parish began in 1686, and the new church was consecrated in the summer of 1687. Johann Lehmann worked in the new church, and by having a great knowledge of Lithuanian language he checked the Daniel Klein&#x27;s &quot;Grammatica Litvanica&quot; and wrote other texts in Lithuanian. Following Lehmann&#x27;s death, the parish was taken over by his son, who worked there for 32 years, and then his grandson, who worked there in 1696–1722. Later priests of the parish (e.g. Abraham David Lüneburg, Johann Richter) also knew Lithuanian language and published Lithuanian texts.
The Lithuanian Church was destroyed during the Great Fire of Klaipėda in 1854. Consequently, the parishioners collected funds and the reconstruction project was prepared by architect Friedrich August Stüler which was completed in the winter of 1856. The Lithuanian Parish of Klaipėda was large (it had 15,600 parishioners in 1848 and 16,000 parishioners in 1878). In 1852, German services started being held in the Lithuanian Church, and since then, the church was called &quot;Landkirche&quot;, but was eventually renamed to Church of St. Jacob. Karl Rudolf Jacobi worked in the Church of St. Jacob in 1859–1881 and in 1879 was selected as Chairman of the Lithuanian Literary Society. After Jacobi&#x27;s death he was replaced by Janis Pipirs who is also known for his prominent Lithuanian publications. Following the Klaipėda Revolt in 1923 the priests of the Church of St. Jacob stayed loyal to Lithuania and did not demonstrate vast support for Adolf Hitler in 1939. Due to migration following the revolt, the number of Catholics in Klaipėda increased and in 1926 the deanery of Klaipėda was assigned to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Telšiai. In 1939 the Catholic deanery had 25,000 believers. In 1944 almost the entire Lutheran parish was evacuated westward to avoid Soviet repressions. Due to the forceful implementation of state atheism in the post-war period, the damaged churches of St. John, St. Jacob, Evangelical Reformed, Anglican and Catholic Church of the Holy Trinity were completely demolished.

In 1956, there were 30,000 Catholics in Klaipėda. Following the death of Joseph Stalin, a construction of the Church of Mary, Queen of Peace, in Rumpiškės Street was started in 1961, but the Soviet administration did not allow to open it. Furthermore, with the support of the Soviet Army, the tower of the church was demolished and it was rearranged into a philharmonic, while priests who built the church were imprisoned. The church was eventually returned to the believers in 1987.

Following the restoration of independent Lithuania in 1990, Klaipėda has one of the largest parishes of the Lithuanian Evangelical Lutheran Church. Since 1991, the Catholic Church of Klaipėda Region belongs to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Telšiai.

==Cityscape==
===Urbanism and architecture===

The city plan is linear, stretching along the shores of the Curonian Lagoon and the Baltic Sea. The main parts of the city Old Town on the left bank of the Danė River, as well as the new residential areas built after 1945 (Pempininkai, Naujakiemis, Alksnynė, Gedminai, and others). The specifics of the port city are emphasized by the quays, warehouses, half-timbered and industrial buildings typical of the Klaipėda Region. In the Old Town of Klaipėda, a rectangular network of streets was formed in the 13th–15th centuries, including Naujamiestis on the right bank of the Danė River.
Some of the fortification structures that were built before the 20th century and facilities have survived. Klaipėda Castle, which was used from the 13th through 18th centuries, as well as its accompanying bastion, built from 1559 remains on the left bank of the Danė River. Klaipėda Castle&#x27;s bastion complex, which dates from the 15th through 18th centuries, still exists on the right bank of Danė River. Old public buildings, including Theater Palace, which was built on the site of a burnt-down Neoclassical building in 1857, still exist on the old town in Klaipėda. Half-timbered and brick warehouses and residential houses are prevalent throughout Klaipėda.

Following the fire of 1854, the city was intensively rebuilt. In the Naujamiestis district, which began to form in the second half of the 19th century, notable historical buildings include the State Bank (1858), Courthouse (1862), the railway station (1875), the Louise Gymnasium (1891), the neo-Gothic Post Office (1890, architect H. Schoede), the barracks complex (1907, now Klaipėda University Central Palace), Teachers&#x27; Seminary (1908), City Hospital (1902), and the Craftsmen&#x27;s Shelter (1910).
Furthermore, during this period, many residential houses and various other buildings were built. For instance, residential buildings were built on Liepų Street. Also, a neoclassical palace was built in Liepų Street 12. The palace would get expanded around 1820 as well as in the late 19th century. The palace is now used as the Klaipėda Clock and Watch Museum. Also, a wooden villa in Giruliai, Šlaito Street 4 was built in the second half of the 19th century. Furthermore, a Neo-Renaissance villa was built in 1874. The aforementioned villa is now used as the Klaipėda County I. Simonaitytė Public Library. Industrial buildings, including a gas factory built in 1861 by the architect J. Hartmann, the fachwerk Union Chemical Fertilizer Factory built in 1869–80, the pulp factory built in 1900 and later expanded to form 1994 Klaipėda Cardboard Company, were also extensively constructed. Furthermore, a bascule bridge was built over the canal between the castle and the Danė River in 1855. The bascule bridge had important economic impacts for the city, as every passing vessel was required to pay a bridge lifting fee.
In the early 20th century, Jugendstil style buildings were built in the city, including houses at Tiltų Street 13 and H. Manto Street 30, as well as a villa at Smiltynės Street 11. Following the Restoration of Independence of Lithuania and the Klaipėda Revolt, the Red Cross Hospital (1933, architect R. Steikūnas; now Klaipėda County Hospital), Vytautas Magnus Gymnasium (1934, architect H. Reissmann), Klaipėda Pedagogical Institute Sports Hall (1937, architect V. Landsbergis ‑ Žemkalnis; known since 2005 as the Klaipėda Physical Culture and Recreation Center), City Savings Bank (1938), Power Plant Complex (3rd–4th decade of the 20th century, architect of some buildings H. Reissmann) were built and are characterized by rationalist features.

During World War II, 60% of the buildings in Klaipėda were destroyed. Moreover, the buildings reminiscent of Klaipėda&#x27;s Germans were destroyed, and the remains of bombed-out Catholic and evangelical Reformed churches were demolished.

During the Soviet occupation, the historical part of Klaipėda was redesigned. The construction of the St. Church of the Queen Mary of Peace was started in 1957 with the funding of the believers (architect J. Baltrėnas). However, in 1960, it was deprived of believers. Instead, a branch of the LSSR Philharmonic was established there in 1963. The building would later be used as a place of worship again in 1988. Other notable constructions from that period include the Palace of Culture (1963, architect A. Mikėnas, now Klaipėda Musical Theater), Marriage Palace (1980, architect R. V. Kraniauskas), Lithuanian Maritime Museum and Aquarium (1979, architects P. Lapė, L. Šliogerienė; located in Kopgalis Fortress, 1866), and Hotel Klaipėda (1986, architect G. Tiškus; now Amberton Klaipėda). Following the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania, the Dolphinarium of the Lithuanian Maritime Museum (1994, architect P. Lapė), large shopping centers, administrative buildings, hotels and residential buildings were built.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary education===

Since the 14th century, Klaipėda has been a center for education in Lithuania Minor. During the period of Teutonic Knights there were so-called Latin schools near the city churches in Pilsotas, the northern part of the Klaipėda Region inhabited by the Curonians, however most of the schools were established in Sambia Peninsula.

During the period of the Duchy of Prussia schools in Lithuania Minor were created based on the regulations of the church authorities. In the 16th century a dozen Lithuanian parochial schools operated in the Duchy of Prussia. The earliest documented fact about teachers in Klaipėda dates to 1540 when a tax payer was described as &quot;living with the teacher&quot;. Around 1590, the Lithuanian community became independent, and then in ~1620 a separate Klaipėdian Parochial School was opened in a house built on a plot belonging to a priest of the Lithuanian Church, located between the extension of John&#x27;s Street and Market&#x27;s Street, but the church and school were demolished in 1627. In 1687, a new Lithuanian Church was built in the Friedrich&#x27;s suburb and the Lithuanian Parochial School was also established next to it. At the beginning of the 19th century, the significance of the Lithuanian Parochial School in Klaipėda decreased and in 1817 the Magistrate of Klaipėda occupied the building and the school ceased its activity after operating for nearly 300 years.
In the first half of the 18th century King Frederick William I carried out a reform of the Prussian education system and was one of the first in Europe to try to implement universal primary education. Out of 1160 new primary schools 275 were established in Lithuanian Province which included Klaipėda. Moreover, Lutheranism provisions encouraged the use of the language of the local people in public life, including in church schools, and in the 18th century the number of primary schools in Lithuanian counties eventually risen to 449 (in 340 of them pupils were taught only in Lithuanian or in German). Nevertheless, a big obstacle for Lithuanian children to study was serfdom which was abolished in Prussia only in 1763. In the 19th century, mixed schools resulted in Germanisation of Lithuanian pupils as bilingual schools eventually became monolingual German. In the interwar period Klaipėda became part of Lithuania since 1923, however in this period out of 102 schools only four were Lithuanian and seven were mixed German–Lithuanian in the entire Klaipėda Region.
At the end of the 17th century, the Great School (or the Latin School) was established which was the first upper school in Klaipėda, and in ~1850 the school was granted gymnasium status, while in 1891 it was named after Queen Louise. In 1829, the Klaipėda Navigation School was established due to the demand to train navigators and sea captains. In 1902, the Klaipėda Teachers&#x27; Seminary was established with an objective to prepare teachers who know Lithuanian language. In 1923, the Klaipėda Conservatory was established on the initiative of composer Stasys Šimkus to educate professional musicians which is still active. In 1925, the Klaipėda Accelerated School was established alongside its German counterpart which after 2 years studies provided an opportunity to its graduates to continues studies in the gymnasium.

Currently, Klaipėda has 12 gymnasiums, 3 primary schools, 17 progymnasiums, and 4 elementary schools. Additionally, there is Eduardo Balsio Gymnasium of Arts. Most of pupils in Klaipėda later studies in the universities or colleges as Lithuania is one of the world&#x27;s leading countries in OECD&#x27;s statistics of population with tertiary education (58.15% of 25–34-year-olds in 2022).

===Tertiary education===
Initially, Klaipėda had no university, therefore many Klaipėdians and prominent Lithuanians from Lithuania Minor and Lithuania proper studied and lectured at the University of Königsberg which was established in 1544 with a permission of Sigismund I the Old and had equal status to the University of Kraków. Since 1718 the University of Königsberg had the Lithuanian language seminar which was the first independent discipline of Lithuanian language in higher education.

In the interwar period three high schools were established in Klaipėda. The Klaipėda Trade Institute (est. in 1934) which had three departments: banking, commercial, and consular (since 1937: banking–commercial and consular). The Klaipėda Pedagogical Institute (est. in 1935) which prepared higher qualification teachers for primary schools. The Klaipėda Regional Pedagogical Institute (est. in 1935) which prepared higher qualification teachers for regional German schools. There also were proposals to establish a university in Klaipėda, however German annexation of the Klaipėda Region in 1939 and subsequently occurred sovietization of Lithuania prevented it from being realized.

In the Soviet period branches of the Kaunas Polytechnic Institute (1959) and Šiauliai Pedagogical Institute (1971), as well as Faculty of Preschool Education of the Šiauliai Pedagogical Institute (1975), and the Klaipėda Ecology Centre of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences were established in Klaipėda. In 1990, following the re-establishment of the State of Lithuania, they were merged to establish Klaipėda University. The Klaipėda University has three faculties (Marine Technology and Natural Sciences, of Social Sciences and Humanities, and of Health Sciences) and two institutes (Marine Research Institute and Institute of Baltic Region History and Archaeology). In 2019, Klaipėda University joined the EU-CONEXUS which is an international alliance of coastal cities universities aiming to enhance cooperation between them. Every year over 3,000 students study at Klaipėda University, while nearly 40,000 are alumni.

Another university operating in Klaipėda is the LCC International University which is an ecumenical Christian university providing liberal arts education of social sciences and humanities. The majority of its students are internationals from tens of countries worldwide.

Four colleges operate in Klaipėda: Klaipėda University of Applied Sciences, Lithuania Business College, SMK High School, and Lithuanian Maritime Academy. Moreover, Vilnius Academy of Arts and Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre also has faculties in Klaipėda.

The railway station consists of two buildings. The old building, made of yellow bricks and reflecting features of Classical architecture, was built in 1881. Currently, the building hosts various small businesses. The new railway station was built of red bricks in 1983.

The railway network of then Prussia reached Klaipėda in 1878. Initially used for lumber and fish freight on the Klaipėda–Šilutė and Klaipėda–Šilutė–Pagėgiai routes, the railway grid network of Lithuania Minor received a major boost after the Klaipėda uprising and the annexation of the region by Lithuania in 1923.

The tram system had two lines with 12 km of tracks and 17 tramcars. The first line was from the old city (lighthouse and Strandvilla restaurant) through center and northern suburbs, which included Royal (Didžioji) Vitė and Bomelio Vitė localities. Eventually, the route would go to beaches, then to Melnragė, a resort. The second line was from the old city through Royal Smeltė, an industrial suburb, then south to Wilhelm Channel and Wooden Bay. Line The tram lines were all connected to the stock exchange in the center of the city. Branches of the tram routes connected the center with railway station through Liepaja (now Manto) Street and Liepaja (now Lietuvninku) Square. Another tram route passed near the Winter Port through the Vite locality. In 1950—1967 tram run functioned in line to Smeltė only. Tram lines were used for delivery of goods from railways and ports. Eventually, the tram degraded and closed due to wear, as well as lack of funds for its renewal and development.

City authorities are currently planning to revitalize the tram system in Klaipėda. The proposed tram routes plan to connect Klaipėda with Šventoji through Palanga International Airport, as well as Palanga. In 2017, a feasibility study began for first tram line on Herkus Manto and Taikos streets.

<text>The United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) was an agency of the U.S. Department of Labor from 1933 to 1940 and the U.S. Department of Justice from 1940 to 2003.

Referred to by some as former INS and by others as legacy INS, the agency ceased to exist under that name on March 1, 2003, when most of its functions were transferred to three new entities – U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) – within the newly created Department of Homeland Security (DHS), as part of a major government reorganization following the September 11 attacks of 2001.

Prior to 1933, there were separate offices administering immigration and naturalization matters, known as the Bureau of Immigration and the Bureau of Naturalization, respectively. The INS was established on June 10, 1933, merging these previously separate areas of administration. In 1890, the federal government, rather than the individual states, regulated immigration into the United States, and the Immigration Act of 1891 established a Commissioner of Immigration in the Treasury Department. Reflecting changing governmental concerns, immigration was transferred to the purview of the United States Department of Commerce and Labor after 1903 and the Department of Labor after 1913. In 1940, with increasing concern about national security, immigration and naturalization was organized under the authority of the Department of Justice.

In 2003 the administration of immigration services, including permanent residence, naturalization, asylum, and other functions, became the responsibility of the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (BCIS), which existed under that name only for a short time before changing to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The investigative and enforcement functions of the INS (including investigations, deportation, and intelligence) were combined with the U.S. Customs investigators to create U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The border functions of the INS, which included the Border Patrol and INS Inspectors, were combined with U.S. Customs Inspectors to create U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

==Mission==

The INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) administered federal immigration laws and regulations including the Immigration and Nationality Act (Title 8, United States Code). Its officers inspected foreigners arriving at an official Port of Entry (POE), detecting and deterring illegal entry between the ports (with the assistance of the Border Patrol, a component of the INS) and by sea, and conducting investigations of criminal and administrative violations of the Act. The INS also adjudicated applications for permanent residency (&quot;green cards&quot;), change of status, naturalization (the process by which an alien [foreign-born person] becomes a citizen), and similar matters.

==Structure==

At the head of the INS was a commissioner appointed by the President who reported to the Attorney General in the Department of Justice. The INS worked closely with the United Nations, the Department of State, and the Department of Health and Human Services. The INS was a very large and complex organization that had four main divisions—Programs, Field Operations, Policy and Planning, and Management—that were responsible for operations and management.

The operational functions of the INS included the Programs and Field Operations divisions. The Programs division was responsible for handling all the functions involved with enforcement and examinations, including the arrest, detaining, and deportation of illegal immigrants as well as controlling illegal and legal entry.

The Field Operations division was responsible for overseeing INS&#x27; many offices operating throughout the country and the world. The Field Operations division implemented policies and handled tasks for its three regional offices, which in turn oversaw 33 districts and 21 border areas throughout the country. Internationally, the Field Operations division oversaw the Headquarters Office of International Affairs which in turn oversaw 16 offices outside the country.

Managerial functions of the INS included the Policy and Planning and Management divisions. The Office of Policy and Planning coordinated all information for the INS and communicated with other cooperating government agencies and the public. The office was divided into three areas: the Policy Division; the Planning Division; and the Evaluation and Research Center. The second managerial division, called the Management division, was responsible for maintaining the overall mission of the INS throughout its many offices and providing administrative services to these offices. These duties were handled by the offices of Information Resources Management, Finance, Human Resources and Administration, and Equal Employment Opportunity.

==History==
Shortly after the U.S. Civil War, some states started to pass their own immigration laws, which prompted the U.S. Supreme Court to rule in 1876 that immigration was a federal responsibility. The Immigration Act of 1891 established an Office of the Superintendent of Immigration within the Treasury Department. This office was responsible for admitting, rejecting, and processing all immigrants seeking admission to the United States and for implementing national immigration policy. &#x27;Immigrant Inspectors&#x27;, as they were called then, were stationed at major U.S. ports of entry collecting manifests of arriving passengers. Its largest station was located on Ellis Island in New York Harbor. Among other things, a &#x27;head tax&#x27; of fifty cents was collected on each immigrant.

Paralleling some contemporary immigration concerns, in the early 1900s Congress&#x27;s primary interest in immigration was to protect American workers and wages: the reason it had become a federal concern in the first place. This made immigration more a matter of commerce than revenue. In 1903, Congress transferred the Bureau of Immigration to the newly created (now-defunct) Department of Commerce and Labor, and on June 10, 1933, the agency was established as the &quot;Immigration and Naturalization Service&quot;.

After World War I, Congress attempted to stem the flow of immigrants, still mainly coming from Europe, by passing a law in 1921 and the Immigration Act of 1924 limiting the number of newcomers by assigning a quota to each nationality based upon its representation in previous U.S. Census figures. Each year, the U.S. State Department issued a limited number of visas; only those immigrants who could present valid visas were permitted entry.

There were a number of predecessor agencies to INS between 1891 and 1933. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) was formed in 1933 by a merger of the Bureau of Immigration and the Bureau of Naturalization.

Both those bureaus, as well as the newly created INS, were controlled by the Department of Labor.
President Franklin Roosevelt moved the INS from the Department of Labor to the Department of Justice in 1940, citing a need for &quot;more effective control over aliens&quot; as the United States moved closer to joining World War II.

By July 1941, Justice Department officials had decided that the INS would oversee the internment of enemy aliens arrested by the FBI should the U.S. enter the war, and immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor these plans went into effect. By December 10, three days after the attack, the INS had 1,291 Japanese, 857 German, and 147 Italian nationals in custody. These &quot;enemy aliens,&quot; many of whom had resided in the United States for decades, were arrested without warrants or formal charges. They were held in immigration stations and various requisitioned sites, often for months, before receiving a hearing (without the benefit of legal counsel or defense witnesses) and being released, paroled, or transferred to a Department of Justice internment camp. Starting in 1942, the INS also interned German, Italian, and Japanese Latin Americans deported from Peru and other countries. It is estimated that 17,477 persons of Japanese ancestry, 11,507 of German ancestry, 2,730 of Italian ancestry, and 185 others were interned by the Immigration and Naturalization Service during the war.

In November 1979, Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti announced that INS &quot;raids&quot; would only take place at places of work, not at residences where illegal aliens were suspected of living.

==Films==

The work of the immigration service has been dramatized or depicted in literature, music, art, and theatre. Films using its work as a theme include &quot;The Immigrant&quot; (1917), &quot;The Strong Man&quot; (1926), &quot;Ellis Island&quot; (1936), &quot;Paddy O&#x27;Day&quot; (1936), &quot;Gateway&quot; (1938), &quot;Secret Service of the Air&quot; (1939), &quot;Exile Express&quot; (1939), &quot;Five Came Back&quot; (1939), &quot;Illegal Entry&quot; (1949), &quot;Deported&quot; (1950), &quot;Gambling House&quot; (1951), &quot;Coneheads&quot; (1993), &quot;My Fellow Americans&quot; (1996), &quot;Men in Black&quot; (1997), &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot; (2005) and &quot;Ip Man 4: The Finale&quot; (2019).

<text>Western astrology is the system of astrology most popular in Western countries. It is historically based on Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Tetrabiblos&quot; (2nd century CE), which in turn was a continuation of Hellenistic and ultimately Babylonian traditions.

Western astrology is largely horoscopic, that is, it is a form of divination based on the construction of a horoscope for an exact moment, such as a person&#x27;s birth as well as location (since time zones may or may not affect a person&#x27;s birth chart), in which various cosmic bodies are said to have an influence. Astrology in western popular culture is often reduced to sun sign astrology, which considers only the individual&#x27;s date of birth (i.e. the &quot;position of the Sun&quot; at that date).

Astrology is a pseudoscience and has consistently failed experimental and theoretical verification.

Astrology was widely considered a respectable academic and scientific field before the Enlightenment, but modern research has found no consistent empirical basis to it.

==Core principles==

A central principle of astrology is integration within the cosmos. The individual, Earth, and its environment are viewed as a single organism, all parts of which are correlated with each other. Cycles of change that are observed in the heavens are therefore reflective (not causative) of similar cycles of change observed on earth and within the individual. This relationship is expressed in the Hermetic maxim &quot;as above, so below; as below, so above&quot;, which postulates symmetry between the individual as a microcosm and the celestial environment as a macrocosm.

As opposed to Sidereal astrology, Western astrology evaluates a person&#x27;s birth based on the alignments of the stars and planets from the perspective on earth instead of in space.

At the heart of astrology is the metaphysical principle that mathematical relationships express qualities or &#x27;tones&#x27; of energy which manifest in numbers, visual angles, shapes and sounds – all connected within a pattern of proportion. An early example is Ptolemy, who wrote influential texts on all these topics. Al-Kindi, in the 9th century, developed Ptolemy&#x27;s ideas in &quot;De Aspectibus&quot; which explores many points of relevance to astrology and the use of planetary aspects.

==The zodiac==
The zodiac is the belt or band of constellations through which the Sun, Moon, and planets move on their journey across the sky. Astrologers noted these constellations and so attached a particular significance to them. Over time they developed the system of twelve signs of the zodiac, based on twelve of the constellations through which the sun passes throughout the year, those constellations that are &quot;Enlightened by the mind&quot;. Most western astrologers use the tropical zodiac beginning with the sign of Aries at the Northern Hemisphere vernal equinox always on or around March 21 of each year. The Western Zodiac is drawn based on the Earth&#x27;s relationship to fixed, designated positions in the sky, and the Earth&#x27;s seasons. The Sidereal Zodiac is drawn based on the Earth&#x27;s position in relation to the constellations, and follows their movements in the sky.

Due to a phenomenon called precession of the equinoxes (where the Earth&#x27;s axis slowly rotates like a spinning top in a 25,700-year cycle), there is a slow shift in the correspondence between Earth&#x27;s seasons (and calendar) and the constellations of the zodiac. Thus, the tropical zodiac corresponds with the position of the earth in relation to fixed positions in the sky (Western Astrology), while the sidereal zodiac is drawn based on the position in relation to the constellations (sidereal zodiac).

===The twelve signs===
In modern Western astrology the signs of the zodiac are believed to represent twelve basic personality types or characteristic modes of expression. The twelve signs are divided into four elements fire, earth, air and water. Fire and air signs are considered masculine, while water and earth signs are considered feminine. The twelve signs are also divided into three qualities, also called modalities, Cardinal, fixed and mutable.


*Note: these are only approximations and the exact date on which the sign of the sun changes varies from year to year.
Zodiac sign for an individual depends on the placement of planets and the ascendant in that sign. If a person has nothing placed in a particular sign, that sign will play no active role in their personality. On the other hand, a person with, for example, both the sun and moon in Cancer, will strongly display the characteristics of that sign in their make up.

===Sun-sign astrology===
Newspapers often print astrology columns which purport to provide guidance on what might occur in a day in relation to the sign of the zodiac that included the sun when the person was born. Astrologers refer to this as the &quot;sun sign&quot;, but it is often commonly called the &quot;star sign&quot;. These predictions are vague or general; so much so that even practicing astrologers consider them of little to no value on their own. Experiments have shown that when people are shown a newspaper horoscope for their own sign along with a newspaper horoscope for a different sign, they judge them to be equally accurate on average. Other tests have been performed on complete, personalized horoscopes cast by professional astrologers, and have shown no correlation between the horoscope results and the person it was cast for.

==The planets==

In modern Western astrology the planets represent basic drives or impulses in the human psyche. These planets differ from the definition of a planet in astronomy in that the Sun, Moon, and recently, Pluto are all considered to be planets for the purposes of astrology. Each planet is also said to be the ruler of one or two zodiac signs. The three outer planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) have each been assigned rulership of a zodiac sign by astrologers. Traditionally rulership of the signs was, according to Ptolemy, based on seasonal derivations and astronomical measurement, whereby the luminaries being the brightest planets were given rulership of the brightest months of the year and Saturn the coldest furthest classical planet was given to the coldest months of the year, with the other planets ruling the remaining signs as per astronomical measurement. It is noteworthy that the modern rulerships do not follow the same logic.

===Classical planets===

The astrological &#x27;planets&#x27; are the seven heavenly bodies known to the ancients. The Sun and Moon, also known as &#x27;the lights&#x27;, are included as they were thought to act like the astronomical planets. Astrologers call inner planets Mercury, Venus and Mars, the &#x27;personal planets&#x27;, as they represent the most immediate drives. The &#x27;lights&#x27; symbolise respectively the existential and sensitive fundamentals of the individuality.

The following table summarizes the rulership by the seven classically known planets of each of the twelve astrological signs, together with their effects on world events, people and the earth itself as understood in the Middle Ages.

==Modern modifications to the Ptolemaic system==
===Additional planets===
These are the planets discovered in modern times, which have since been assigned meanings by Western astrologers.

===Sidereal and tropical astrology===

There are two camps of thought among western astrologers about the &quot;starting point&quot;, 0 degrees Aries, in the zodiac. Sidereal astrology uses a fixed starting point in the background of stars, while tropical astrology, used by the majority of Western astrologers, chooses as a starting point the position of the Sun against the background of stars at the Northern hemisphere vernal equinox (i.e. when the Sun position against the heavens crosses over from the southern hemisphere to the northern hemisphere) each year. The consequence of the Tropical approach is that when we say the Sun or a planet is in a certain zodiac sign, observation of it in the sky will show that it does not lie within that constellation at all.

As the Earth spins on its axis, it &quot;wobbles&quot; like a top, causing the vernal equinox to move gradually backwards against the star background, (a phenomenon known as the Precession of the equinoxes) at a rate of about 30 degrees (one Zodiacal sign length) every 2,160 years. Thus the two zodiacs would be aligned only once every 26,000 years. They were aligned about 2,000 years ago when the zodiac was originally established.

This phenomenon gives us the conceptual basis for the Age of Aquarius, whose &quot;dawning&quot; coincides with the movement of the vernal equinox across the cusp from Pisces to Aquarius in the star background.

===The moon&#x27;s nodes===

Also important in astrology are the moon&#x27;s nodes. The nodes are where the moon&#x27;s path crosses the ecliptic. The North, or Ascending Node marks the place where the moon crosses from South to North (or ascends), while the South, or Descending Node marks where the moon crosses from North to South (or descends). While Lunar nodes are not considered by Western astrologers to be as important a factor as each of the planets, they are thought to mark sensitive areas that are worth taking into account.

* – North or ascending Node. Also the ruler of Pathways and Choices.
* – South or descending Node. Also the ruler of Karma and the Past.

===Essential dignity===
In astrology, &quot;essential dignity&quot; is the strength of a planet or point&#x27;s zodiac position, judged only by its position by sign and degree, what the pre-eminent 17th-century astrologer William Lilly called &quot;the strength, fortitude or debility of the Planets [or] significators.&quot; In other words, essential dignity seeks to view the strengths of a planet or point as though it were isolated from other factors in the sky of the natal chart. Traditionally, there are five dignities: domicile and detriment, exaltation and fall, triplicity, terms, and face. However, the later two have diminished in usage. A planet&#x27;s domicile is the zodiac sign over which it has rulership.

==The horoscope==

Western astrology is based mainly upon the construction of a horoscope, which is a map or &quot;chart&quot; of the heavens at a particular moment. The moment chosen is the beginning of the existence of the subject of the horoscope, as it is believed that the subject will carry with it the pattern of the heavens from that moment throughout its life. The most common form of horoscope is the natal chart based on the moment of a person&#x27;s birth; though in theory a horoscope can be drawn up for the beginning of anything, from a business enterprise to the foundation of a nation state.
===Interpretation===
In Western horoscopic astrology the interpretation of a horoscope is governed by:
*The position of the planets in the astrological signs of the zodiac,
*The position of the planets in the houses of the horoscope,
*The position of the primary angles of the horoscope, namely the horizon line (called the ascendant/descendant axis), and the prime vertical line (called the zenith/midheaven and nadir/imum coeli axis),
*The angles formed by the planets relative to each other and the primary angles, called aspects
*The position of deduced astronomical entities, such as the Lunar nodes.

Some astrologers also use the position of various mathematical points, such as the Arabic parts.

Various techniques are used, with different degrees of complexity, to provide what astrologers claim are forecasts or predictive statements about the future, as well as to analyse past and current events. These include transits, progressions, and primary directions. Different branches of astrology, such as horary and electional astrology, have their own specific sets of techniques.

===The primary angles===

There are four primary angles in the horoscope (though the cusps of the houses are often included as important angles by some astrologers).

*Asc - The ascendant or &quot;rising sign&quot; is the eastern point where the ecliptic and horizon intersect. During the course of a day, because of the Earth&#x27;s rotation, the entire circle of the ecliptic will pass through the ascendant and will be advanced by about 1°. This provides us with the term &quot;rising sign&quot;, which is the sign of the zodiac that was rising in the east at the exact time that the horoscope or natal chart is calculated. In creating a horoscope the ascendant is traditionally placed as the left-hand side point of the chart. In most house systems the ascendant lies on the cusp of the 1st house of the horoscope.

The ascendant is generally considered the most important and personalized angle in the horoscope by the vast majority of astrologers. It signifies a person&#x27;s awakening consciousness, in the same way that the Sun&#x27;s appearance on the eastern horizon signifies the dawn of a new day. Due to the fact that the ascendant is specific to a particular time and place, it signifies the individual environment and conditioning that a person receives during their upbringing, and also the circumstances of their childhood. For this reason, the ascendant is also concerned with how a person has learned to present themself to the world, especially in public and in impersonal situations.

The opposite point to the ascendant in the west is the descendant, which denotes how a person reacts in their relationships with others. It also show the kind of person we are likely to be attracted to, and our ability to form romantic attachments. In most house systems the descendant lies on the cusp of the 7th house of the horoscope.

*Mc - The midheaven or &quot;medium coeli&quot; is the point on the ecliptic that is furthest above the plane of the horizon. For events occurring where the planes of the ecliptic and the horizon coincide, the limiting position for these points is located 90° from the ascendant. For astrologers, the midheaven traditionally indicates a person&#x27;s career, status, aim in life, aspirations, public reputation, and life goal. In &quot;quadrant house&quot; systems the midheaven lies on the cusp of the 10th house of the horoscope.

The opposite point to the midheaven is known as the imum coeli. For astrologers the nadir or IC traditionally indicates the circumstances at the beginning and end of a person&#x27;s life, their parents and the parental home, and their own domestic life. In &quot;quadrant house&quot; systems it lies on the cusp of the 4th house of the horoscope.

===The houses===
The horoscope is divided by astrologers into 12 portions called the houses. The houses of the horoscope are interpreted as being 12 different spheres of life or activity. There are various ways of calculating the houses in the horoscope or birth chart. However, there is no dispute about their meanings, and the 12 houses

Many modern astrologers assume that the houses relate to their corresponding signs, i.e. that the first house has a natural affinity with the first sign, Aries, and so on.

===Aspects===
The aspects are the angles the planets make to each other in the horoscope, and also to the ascendant, midheaven, descendant and nadir. The aspects are measured by the angular distance along the ecliptic in degrees and minutes of celestial longitude between two points, as viewed from the earth. They indicate focal points in the horoscope where the energies involved are given extra emphasis. The more exact the angle, the more powerful the aspect, although an allowance of a few degrees each side of the aspect called an &quot;orb&quot; is allowed for interpretation. The following are the aspects in order of importance:

* - Conjunction 0° (orb ±10°). The conjunction is a major point in the chart, giving strong emphasis to the planets involved. The planets will act together to outside stimulus and act on each other.
* - Opposition 180° (orb ±10°). The opposition is indicative of tension, conflict and confrontation, due to the polarity between the two elements involved. Stress arises when one is used over the other, causing an imbalance; but the opposition can work well if the two parts of the aspect are made to complement each other in a synthesis.
* - Trine 120°(orb ±7.5°). The trine indicates harmony, and ease of expression, with the two elements reinforcing each other. The trine is a source of artistic and creative talent, but can be a &#x27;line of least resistance&#x27; to a person of weak character.
* - Square 90°(orb ±7.5°). The square indicates frustration, inhibitions, disruption and inner conflict, but can become a source of energy and activation to a person determined to overcome limitations.
* - Sextile 60°(orb ±5°). The sextile is similar to the trine, but of less significance. It indicates ease of communication between the two elements involved, with compatibility and harmony between them.
* - Quincunx 150°(orb ±2.5°). The quincunx indicates difficulty and stress, due to incompatible elements being forced together. It can mean an area of self-neglect in a person&#x27;s life (especially health), or obligations being forced on a person. The quincunx can vary from minor to quite major in impact.
* - Semisextile 30° (orb ±1.25°). Slight in effect. Indicates an area of life where a conscious effort to be positive will have to be made.
* - Semisquare 45°(orb ±2.5°). Indicates somewhat difficult circumstance. Similar in effect to semisextile.
* - Sesquiquadrate 135°(orb ±2.5°). Indicates somewhat stressful conditions. Similar to semisextile.
*Q - Quintile 72° (orb ±1.25°). Slight in effect. Indicates talent and vaguely fortunate circumstances.
*bQ - Biquintile 144° (orb ±1.25°). Slight in effect. Indicates talent and vaguely fortunate circumstances.
* - Retrograde: A planet is retrograde when it appears to move backwards across the sky when seen from the earth. Although it is not an aspect, some astrologers believe that it should be included for consideration in the chart. Planets which are retrograde in the natal chart are considered by them to be potential weak points.

==Astrology and science==
The majority of professional astrologers rely on performing astrology-based personality tests and making relevant predictions about the remunerator&#x27;s future. Those who continue to have faith in astrology have been characterised as doing so &quot;in spite of the fact that there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs, and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary&quot;.

Astrology has not demonstrated its effectiveness in controlled studies and has no scientific validity, and as such, is regarded as pseudoscience. There is no proposed mechanism of action by which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth that does not contradict well understood, basic aspects of biology and physics.

Where astrology has made falsifiable predictions, it has been falsified. The most famous test was headed by Shawn Carlson and included a committee of scientists and a committee of astrologers. It led to the conclusion that natal astrology performed no better than chance.

<text>Chinese astrology is based on traditional Chinese astronomy and the Chinese calendar. Chinese astrology flourished during the Han dynasty (2nd century BC to 2nd century AD).

Chinese astrology has a close relation with Chinese philosophy (theory of the three harmonies: heaven, earth, and human), and uses the principles of yin and yang, &quot;wuxing&quot; (five phases), the ten Heavenly Stems, the twelve Earthly Branches, the lunisolar calendar (moon calendar and sun calendar), and the time calculation after year, month, day, and &quot;shichen&quot; (, double hour). These concepts are not readily found or familiar in Western astrology or culture.

==History and background==

Chinese astrology was elaborated during the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BC) and flourished during the Han dynasty (2nd century BC to 2nd century AD). During the Han period, the familiar elements of traditional Chinese culture—the yin-yang philosophy, the theory and technology of the five elements (Wuxing), the concepts of heaven and earth, and Taoist, Buddhist and Confucian morality—were brought together to formalize the philosophical principles of Chinese medicine and divination, astrology and alchemy.

The five classical planets are associated with the &quot;wuxing&quot;:
* Venus—Metal (White Tiger) 
* Jupiter—Wood (Azure Dragon) 
* Mercury—Water (Black Tortoise)
* Mars—Fire (Vermilion Bird) (may be associated with the phoenix which was also an imperial symbol along with the Dragon) 
* Saturn—Earth (Yellow Dragon)

According to Chinese astrology, a person&#x27;s fate can be determined by the position of the major planets at the person&#x27;s birth along with the positions of the Sun, Moon, comets, the person&#x27;s time of birth, and zodiac sign. The system of the twelve-year cycle of animal signs was built from observations of the orbit of Jupiter (the Year Star; ). Following the orbit of Jupiter around the Sun, Chinese astronomers divided the celestial circle into 12 sections, and rounded it to 12 years (from 11.86). Jupiter is associated with the constellation &quot;Sheti&quot; (- Boötes) and is sometimes called Sheti.

A system of computing one&#x27;s predestined fate is based on birthday, birth season, and birth hour, known as &quot;zi wei dou shu&quot; (), or Purple Star Astrology, is still used regularly in modern-day Chinese astrology to divine one&#x27;s fortune. The 28 Chinese constellations, &quot;Xiu&quot; (), are quite different from Western constellations. For example, the Big Bear (Ursa Major) is known as &quot;Dou&quot; (); the belt of Orion is known as &quot;Shen&quot; (), or the &quot;Happiness, Fortune, Longevity&quot; trio of demigods. The seven northern constellations are referred to as &quot;Xuan Wu&quot; (). Xuan Wu is also known as the spirit of the northern sky or the spirit of water in Taoist belief.

In addition to astrological readings of the heavenly bodies, the stars in the sky form the basis of many fairy tales. For example, the Summer Triangle is the trio of the cowherd (Altair), the weaving maiden fairy (Vega), and the &quot;tai bai&quot; fairy (Deneb). The two forbidden lovers were separated by the silvery river (the Milky Way). Each year on the seventh day of the seventh month in the Chinese calendar, the birds form a bridge across the Milky Way. The cowherd carries their two sons (the two stars on each side of Altair) across the bridge to reunite with their fairy mother. The tai bai fairy acts as the chaperone of these two immortal lovers.

===Chinese zodiac===

Chinese astrology has a close relation with Chinese philosophy. The core values and concepts of Chinese philosophy originate from Taoism.

==Table of the sixty-year calendar==

The following table shows the 60-year cycle matched up to the Western calendar for the years 1924–2043 (see sexagenary cycle article for years 1924–1983). This is only applied to Chinese Lunar calendar. The sexagenary cycle begins at lichun. Each of the Chinese lunar years are associated with a combination of the ten Heavenly Stems () and the twelve Earthly Branches () which make up the 60 Stem-Branches () in a sexagenary cycle. 
==&quot;Wuxing&quot;==
Although it is usually translated as &#x27;element&#x27;, the Chinese word &quot;xing&quot; literally means something like &#x27;changing states of being&#x27;, &#x27;permutations&#x27; or &#x27;metamorphoses of being&#x27;. In fact, Sinologists cannot agree on one single translation. The Chinese notion of &#x27;element&#x27; is therefore quite different from the Western one. In the west, India Vedic, and Japanese Go dai elements were seen as the basic building blocks of matter and static or stationary. The Chinese &#x27;elements&#x27;, by contrast, were seen as ever changing, and the transliteration of &quot;xing&quot; is simply &#x27;the five changes&#x27; and in traditional Chinese medicine are commonly referred to as phrases. Things seen as associated to each &quot;xing&quot; are listed below.

===Wood ()===

* The East ()
* Springtime ()
* Azure Dragon ()
* The Planet Jupiter ()
* The Color Green ()
* Liver () and Gall bladder ()

===Fire ()===

* The South ()
* Summer ()
* Vermilion Bird/Vermilion Phoenix ()
* The Planet Mars ()
* The Color Red ()
* Circulatory system, Heart () and Small intestine ()

===Earth ()===

* Center ()
* Change of seasons (the last month of the season)
* The Yellow Dragon ()
* The Planet Saturn ()
* The Color Yellow ()
* Digestive system, Spleen () and Stomach ()

===Metal ()===

* The West ()
* Autumn ()
* White Tiger ()
* The Planet Venus ()
* The Color White ()
* Respiratory system, Lung () and Large intestine ()

===Water ()===

* The North ()
* Winter ()
* Black Tortoise ()
* The Planet Mercury ()
* The Color Black/Blue ()
* Skeleton (), Urinary bladder and Kidney ()

===&quot;Wuxing&quot; generating cycle ( sheng)===
(Inter-promoting, begetting, engendering, mothering or enhancing cycle)
Generating: Wood fuels Fire to burn; Fire creates Earth (ash); Earth produces minerals, Metal; Metal creates Water from condensation; Water nourishes Wood to grow.

===&quot;Wuxing&quot; regulating cycle ( kè)===
The regulating cycle is important to create restraints in the whole system. For example, if Fire was allowed to burn out of control, it would be devastating and destructive as we see in nature in the form of bush fires or internally as high fevers, (Destructing, overcoming or inter-restraining or weakening cycle).
Fire makes Metal flexible; Metal adds the minerals to Wood for there to be strong upward growth; Wood draws water from the Earth to create stability for building; Earth gives Water direction, like the banks of a river; Water controls Fire by cooling its heat.

<doc id="159670" wikidata="Q1956662" url="?curid=159670" title="Adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency type 1">
<text>Adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency type 1 or AMPD1, is a human metabolic disorder in which the body consistently lacks the enzyme AMP deaminase, in sufficient quantities. This may result in exercise intolerance, muscle pain and muscle cramping. The disease was formerly known as myoadenylate deaminase deficiency (MADD).

In virtually all cases, the deficiency has been caused by an SNP mutation, known as &quot;rs17602729&quot; or &quot;C34T&quot;. While it was initially regarded as a recessive (or purely homozygous) disorder, some researchers have reported the existence of similarly deleterious effects from the heterozygous form of the SNP. In the homozygous form of the mutation, a single genetic base (character) has been changed from cytosine (&quot;C&quot;) to thymine (&quot;T&quot;) on both strands of Chromosome 1 – in other words, &quot;C;C&quot; has been replaced by &quot;T;T&quot;. A rarer but analogous condition, in which two guanine bases (&quot;G;G&quot;) bases (in the unmutated form) have been changed to adenine (&quot;A;A&quot;) has also been identified. While there has been no consensus on the effects of the heterozygous form – either &quot;C;T&quot; or &quot;A;G&quot; – some evidence has been found that it too has caused AMPD1 deficiency. In addition, some sources have suggested the existence of a rare, acquired form of AMPD1 deficiency.

AMPD1 deficiency is caused by a defect in the mechanism for production of AMP deaminase – an enzyme that converts adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP). While the deficiency affects approximately 1–2% of people in populations of predominantly European descent, the disorder appears to be considerably rarer in Asian populations.

==Symptoms and signs==
For reasons that are not understood, many people with defective variants of the AMPD genes are asymptomatic, while others have symptoms including exercise intolerance, and/or muscle pain and cramping.

;Fatigue
* MADD lowers aerobic power output, so increased anaerobic power is needed to perform the same amount of work.
* Without myoadenylate deaminase, heavy activity causes adenosine to be released into the cell or perfused into the surrounding tissues. Fatigue and sedation after heavy exertion can be caused by excess adenosine in the cells which signals muscle fiber to feel fatigued. In the brain, excess adenosine decreases alertness and causes sleepiness. In this way, adenosine may play a role in fatigue from MADD.
* Recovery from over-exertion can be hours, days or even months. In cases of rhabdomyolysis, which is the rapid breakdown of muscle fibers, time to recovery is dependent on duration and intensity of original activity plus any excess activity during the recovery period.

;Muscle pain
* Muscle pain from MADD is not well understood, but is partially due to high levels of lactate. Increased levels of free adenosine temporarily decrease pain, allowing over-exertion without awareness. The over exertion can cause mild to severe cases of rhabdomyolysis, which is painful.
* Adenosine mediates pain through adenosine receptors. MADD causes an increase of free adenosine during heavy activity which may cause exercise-induced muscle pain. Over time, excess free adenosine down-regulates primary A1 adenosine receptors, leading to increased muscle pain. Secondary receptors (A3) increase peripheral inflammation, which also increases pain.

;Muscle cramping
* The cause of cramping is unknown, but may be related to elevated lactate, increased calcium signaling across the sarcoplasmic reticulum caused by membrane instability from reduced levels of ATP, or increased levels of free adenosine.

;Muscle weakness
* Muscle weakness is not a major symptom, though the progressive effects of chronic muscle damage from rhabdomyolysis will eventually cause significant weakness. Similarly, the long-term metabolic effects may result in nerve damage.

===Potential complications===
There is an increased risk that statin (cholesterol-reducing drugs) will cause myopathy (muscle weakness) in individuals with MADD.

Anesthesia has the potential to cause malignant hyperthermia, an uncontrolled increase in body temperature, and permanent muscle damage in patients with MADD. Individuals with MADD are advised to notify their anesthesiologist about their condition prior to surgery.

In most cases where myopathy is present with MADD, a second muscle disease is present and symptoms are worse than either disease in isolation.

==Causes==
AMP deaminase is an enzyme that converts adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP), freeing an ammonia molecule in the process. It is a part of the metabolic process that converts sugar, fat, and protein into cellular energy. In order to use energy, a cell converts one of the above fuels into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via the mitochondria. Cellular processes, especially muscles, then convert the ATP into adenosine diphosphate (ADP), freeing the energy to do work.

During heavy or prolonged mild to moderate activity, other enzymes convert two molecules of ADP into one ATP molecule and one AMP molecule, making more ATP available to supply energy. AMP is normally converted into IMP by myoadenylate deaminase—so myoadenylate deaminase deficiency reduces energy that would be available to the cell through the purine nucleotide cycle. Instead of being converted to IMP, the AMP builds up in the cells of affected individuals, spills into the blood, and is eventually metabolized in the liver. In persons with a defective enzyme, 5&#x27;-nucleotidase removes the ribose and phosphorus from AMP, increasing levels of adenosine measured in muscle cells by ~16–25×, after exercise.

==Mechanism==

This failure to deaminate the AMP molecules has three major effects. First, significant amounts of AMP are lost from the cell and the body. Second, ammonia is not freed when the cell does work. Third, the level of IMP in the cell is not maintained.
* The first effect—the loss of AMP—is mostly significant because AMP contains ribose, a sugar molecule that is also used to make DNA, RNA, and some enzymes. Though the body can manufacture some ribose and obtain more from RNA-rich sources such as beans and red meat, this loss of ribose due to MADD is sometimes sufficient to create a shortage in the body, resulting in symptoms of severe fatigue and muscle pain. This outcome is especially likely if the individual regularly exercises vigorously or works physically over a period of weeks or months.
* The second effect, the absence of ammonia, is not well understood. It may result in a reduction of the amount of fumarate available to the citric acid cycle, and it may result in lower levels of nitric oxide (a vasodilator) in the body, reducing blood flow and oxygen intake during vigorous exercise, though this may be offset by increased levels of adenosine, another vasodilator.
* The third effect, the reduction in IMP, is also not well understood. It may somehow result in a reduction in the amount of lactic acid produced by the muscles, though serum lactate is typically slightly elevated with MADD.

The following is a very simplified model of what may be going on inside a muscle cell with AMPD deficiency. There are two major semi-stable states: one with intra-cellular glycogen available, and one with glycogen exhausted. Both states are modified by how much the citric acid cycle is down-regulated by default.

Start from the state where glycogen is available and the citric acid cycle is severely down-regulated. Once the cell has received a non-trivial load, and has expended the phosphocreatine reserve, a small quantity of ATP will become discharged down to AMP. AMP will instantly up-regulate myophosphorylase, which will start liberating glucose from glycogen and make it available to the glycolytic pathway, producing pyruvate and recharging AMP back to ATP. Due to the greater availability of pyruvate as a substrate, and pyruvate also contributing a citric acid cycle intermediate, α-ketoglutarate, while consuming glutamate, the citric acid cycle will also speed up. The combination of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle now balances ATP production with ATP demand and the pool of AMP does not grow further. Because all pyruvate is not burned down in the citric acid cycle—a consequence of the pyruvate&#x27;s concentration regulating its burning at this moment—the excess is converted to lactate and passed into blood as lactic acid.

In muscle cells with normal AMPD activity, the purine nucleotide cycle would now start to gradually add fumarate to the pool of the citric acid cycle intermediates. This would decrease the excess rate of pyruvate production by increasing its consumption, increase the rate of AMP recharge to ATP by the citric acid cycle, and consequently reduce liberation of glucose from glycogen, until increased supply of blood-borne fuels allows to shut down glycogenolysis completely.

In muscle cells with AMPD deficiency, ATP production rate of the citric acid cycle will not be synchronized with ATP demand. It was demonstrated, that muscle cells, that lack AMPD1, stock and consume significantly more glutamate, and produce more alanine in this state, compared to healthy controls, which indicates occurrence of a higher concentration of pyruvate in the cell during exercise. The pool of AMP also grows bigger than in the controls, which would cause higher rate of glucose liberation from glycogen.

This state can last for as long as glycogen is available, and can be prolonged by constantly eating carbohydrate-rich food. If the load on muscles is greater than the body&#x27;s ability to recycle lactate back into glucose, lactate will start to build up in the blood. Once lactate reaches its renal re-absorption threshold (5–6 mmol/L in general population), it gets lost to urine, wasting many calories (and producing bright matte yellow particles on surfaces where urine dries). At about the same time the kidney will also start correcting blood acidity by acidifying urine. Overly acidic urine causes irritation that feels like a frequent urge to urinate (with little volume) and a &quot;hot&quot; urine.

In order to excrete lactate, kidney must also excrete magnesium as an obligatory cation, which may lead to acute and chronic magnesium deficiency. Supplementary magnesium in the form of lactate or citrate may be rapidly lost in the same way. Because magnesium is essential to aerobic metabolism, over time, magnesium loss may lead to a vicious cycle, where the citric acid cycle is further down-regulated, lactate production is increased, and magnesium loss is increased again.

Although probably unrelated to AMPD deficiency, if the person happens to have a high load of d-lactate in the blood (mostly from food and colonic fermentation), the precipitate, the lactate loss and the magnesium loss may occur even before l-lactate (mostly from muscles) reaches its renal re-absorption threshold. This happens because l-lactate and d-lactate compete with each other for renal re-absorption, and because d-lactate has a significantly lower renal re-absorption threshold, &lt;1 mmol/L.

In order to keep the excreted metabolites in solution, the kidney also has to excrete water. This is in contrast to complete oxidation of lactic acid, which would actually yield metabolic water for the body. This may lead to onset of acute thirst some tens of minutes into exercise in this state, if the water balance in the body was neutral initially.

If the muscle load is small, lactate is mostly recycled back into glucose or burned by other cells in the body. However the newly generated glucose is made available to all cells in the body, not just to muscle cells. The ability of the body to assimilate lactate may also be diminished, if working muscle cells cannot take up glucose from blood, due to myophosphorylase maintaining a higher concentration of it inside loaded cells, and if liver has already filled its glycogen stores up to capacity. So, ultimately, in this state, working muscle cells are destined to lose all glycogen. AMP breakdown to adenosine in this state is minor, because the pool of AMP is kept small by the vigorous regulatory action of myophosphorylase. Maximum continuous exertion is limited by the onset of burning sensation from lactate accumulation in muscles.

Eventually, all glycogen is exhausted, and the muscle cell enters another semi-stable state. During this transition, up-regulation of the citric acid cycle due to abundance of pyruvate is reversed, and a substantial part of the ATP pool is necessarily discharged down to AMP, which allows the citric acid cycle to be sped up by some other mechanism (perhaps by the allosteric mechanism that reacts to the lower concentration of ATP, or by amplification of the residual AMPD activity by the bloated AMP pool), until ATP production is balanced with ATP consumption. AMP conversion to adenosine, excretion to the blood (as AMP and its various metabolites), further conversion to uric acid and excretion to urine becomes significant for some time, until all AMP is eliminated from the muscle cell. The muscle movements become noticeably less precise. Breathing slows down, and from this moment reacts very weakly to the load and not at all to the perceived effort. It becomes hard to rapidly increase the load on a muscle, as in McArdle&#x27;s disease, and such a rapid load increase will dump even more purines into blood and urine (looking like translucent or rust-colored sharp shiny crystals and being highly irritating). The same situation would occur if blood flow to muscle cells becomes insufficient (except that somewhat less AMP is spilled over, and somewhat more of it is metabolized inside the muscle cell). On the other hand, there will be no lasting muscle pain from lactate, and continuous aerobic activity is possible. Oxidation of odd-numbered saturated fatty acids may provide another mechanism, although very gradual, to up-regulate citric acid cycle during exercise.

As the short-term regulation of ATP production becomes very weak after the exhaustion of glycogen, the medium-term regulation becomes enabled, but with a progressively weaker authority at higher purine nucleotide energy charge levels, which causes some differences in symptoms compared to McArdle&#x27;s. In McArdle&#x27;s, the highly active AMP deaminase, which additionally experiences amplification from the bloated AMP pool due to the lack of the moderating effect of myophosphorylase, is able to produce a readily observable &quot;second wind&quot; phenomenon almost exactly 7 minutes after a significant load increment. In AMPD deficiency, glycogen-less muscles will feel mostly the same by the time they become able to take another load increment. A load decrement may produce some sense of relief, though, if the pool of the citric acid cycle intermediates built up so far is sufficient to maintain full purine nucleotide energy charge at the lower load.

It is unclear, what, if anything, does it take to unknowingly trigger rhabdomyolysis at this point, assuming the muscle cell is otherwise healthy. Adenosine production and lack of ammonia overproduction seem to strongly suppress rhabdomyolysis down to the purine nucleotide energy charge level, where the cell is able to signal pain, or where individual muscle fibers start cramping (fail to relax from contraction in sync with the rest of the muscle), or the whole muscle fails to contract (when walking quickly downhill), allowing the person to appropriately modulate the exertion.

Most of the AMP probably spills into blood unchanged, and is gradually returned to the muscle cell, if its concentration there falls due to gradual recharge to ATP. The blood thus plays a role of a big AMP buffer. Idle muscles may also take up some free AMP. The spillover also limits, how much the residual AMPD activity can be amplified in this state. Thus, it may take the residual AMPD activity less time to build up citric acid cycle intermediates, when the whole body is warmed up for an exercise at the same time, rather than a specific group of muscles needed in the exercise.

In case of leg muscles, where circulation is substantially dependent on their cyclical contraction when the body is upright, a small but useful degree of initial up-regulation of the citric acid cycle may be achieved just by standing still for a few minutes. It is most useful when a long period of rest, or sitting in a vehicle, must be followed by brisk walking.

If the person keeps standing still for longer, rather than restoring circulation in the leg muscles (e.g. by sitting down, walking, or cycling), the ammonia, produced by the amplified residual AMPD activity, may accumulate in the muscle cells and in the surrounding tissues to toxic levels, and may also indirectly affect other organs. There is little or no warning for nearing toxicity, because the purine nucleotide energy charge is still relatively high, the leg muscles do not cramp, and remain functional. In contrast, while muscle glycogen is available, accumulation of lactic acid in this situation would produce a noticeable sensation. On the other hand, in persons with balanced AMPD and myophosphorylase activities in muscle cells, lactic acid and ammonia are produced simultaneously, counteracting each other&#x27;s effects to some degree.

Some seldom used but strong voluntary muscles, such as those involved in &quot;pushing&quot; during the act of defecation, are not tuned for aerobic mode, and may dump plenty of purines during their short work routine, if it happens in this state.

If a food containing even small but perceivable amount of sugar (simple sugars or disaccharides that can be tasted sweet, or starch that is at least minimally hydrolyzed by salivary amylase, or even some non-sugar sweeteners) is eaten in this state, there may be a period of time after it enters stomach and before bulk absorption occurs, when continuous exercise becomes very hard, and easily triggers rhabdomyolysis. It probably happens because the digestive system senses and signals forthcoming delivery of sugars, inhibiting fatty acid release and oxidation, and starving glycogen-less muscle cells of the sole available source of energy. Even simple continuous exercise, like walking or washing dishes by hand right after the meal, may trigger rhabdomyolysis in the exercising muscles. This rhabdomyolysis is probably not of exertional, but of hypoglycemic nature, as loaded glycogen-less muscles can rapidly remove glucose from blood, and the normal mechanism of glucose homeostasis lacks the required responsiveness or capacity to prevent hypoglycemia. The broken down myocytes probably do not yield much glucose. Unlike the case with exertional rhabdomyolysis, there is no warning. At rest, however, the liver will effortlessly cover the whole body energy needs until absorption of carbohydrates occurs.

If a large group of muscles is still actively drawing fuels from blood after the most recent continuous exercise, in order to replenish the ATP and the phosphocreatine reserve, it may become sour without any additional exercise by the time the carbohydrate meal is finished.

If the carbohydrate meal consists of a food (which doesn&#x27;t need to be carbohydrate itself), that requires prolonged vigorous chewing, and then some time to be digested, for instance parboiled long grain rice, chewing may suddenly become very slow and difficult halfway through the meal.

When a carbohydrate-rich food has been eaten before AMP has been eliminated from muscle cells, when bulk absorption starts, plenty of glucose becomes available in the blood, is taken up by muscle cells, is added to the glycogen store, but then immediately becomes liberated by the still up-regulated myophosphorylase. The resulting excess of glucose is metabolized down to lactic acid (the body cannot increase aerobic metabolism in an instant), recharging all AMP to ATP. The lactate is dumped back into blood and urine. The higher the glycemic index of the food is, the greater proportion of carbohydrates (and calories) is wasted into urine. If the person is at rest at this moment, and pays attention, a sudden increase in the breathing frequency due to lactate dumping is readily observable. If the rise in the blood lactate is particularly sharp, and the person happened to be breathing slowly, a heart palpitation may sometimes be observable. The lactic acidosis with palpitation may also occur during sleep, if stomach emptying has been delayed e.g. due to digestion requirements of the food or its high volume, and the person went to sleep before absorption has started. In this case the person will be awaken in a state of distress, with rapid breathing. The person may recall seeing a nightmare. Delayed stomach emptying creates especially favorable conditions for the shock lactic acidosis, because the digestive system may meanwhile still inhibit fatty acid release and oxidation, helping more muscles to run out of glycogen in those persons, who are otherwise still able to maintain its stores between meals. It has been experimentally demonstrated, that delayed gastric emptying prolongs the duration of the GLP-1 signal.

Notably, a small quantity of dietary fructose does not produce this effect (the lactic acidosis), as it is captured by liver and may be fully expended for replenishing liver glycogen.

Once all AMP has been recharged to ATP, and glycogen stores allowed to replenish, the cell transitions back to the unmodified original state.

If carbohydrate-rich food is not consumed in this state, AMP elimination from the cell eventually completes, glycogen stores can be replenished again, and the cell transitions back to the original state but with reduced ATP pool and an up-regulated citric acid cycle.

It may be especially important to have adequate dietary iodine in the glycogen-less state, so that stomach emptying is not excessively delayed, the up-regulation of the citric acid cycle in muscle cells in response to a load increment is not too slow, and the muscles can each time accept a bigger load increment relative to the perceived effort.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of MADD needs to be considered in patients who have exercise induced myalgia, cramps and sometimes weakness. A mildly elevated creatine kinase may also occur. Exclusion of other muscular diseases such as McArdle&#x27;s Disease and carnitine cycle abnormalities should occur. MADD may be identified if there is a lack of ammonia rise after forearm exercise testing. The diagnosis may then be confirmed with genetic testing.

==Treatment==
It is important for MADD patients to maintain strength and fitness without exercising or working to exhaustion. Learning this balance may be more difficult than normally, as muscle pain and fatigue may be perceived differently from normal individuals.

Symptomatic relief from the effects of MADD may sometimes be achieved by administering ribose orally at a dose of approximately 10 grams per 100 pounds (0.2 g/kg) of body weight per day, and exercise modulation as appropriate. Taken hourly, ribose provides a direct but limited source of energy for the cells. Patients with myoadenylate deaminase deficiency do not retain ribose during heavy exercise, so supplementation may be required to rebuild levels of ATP.

Creatine monohydrate could also be helpful for AMPD patients, as it provides an alternative source of energy for anaerobic muscle tissue and was found to be helpful in the treatment of other, unrelated muscular myopathies.

<text>Slash&#x27;s Snakepit was an American rock supergroup from Los Angeles, California, formed by Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Slash in 1994. Though often described as a solo or side project, Slash stated that Snakepit was a band with equal contributions by all members. The first lineup of the band consisted of Slash, two of his Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmates—drummer Matt Sorum and guitarist Gilby Clarke—as well as Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez and former Jellyfish guitarist Eric Dover on lead vocals.

Their debut album, &quot;It&#x27;s Five O&#x27;Clock Somewhere&quot;, was released in 1995. For the supporting tour, Slash enlisted James LoMenzo and Brian Tichy, of Pride &amp; Glory, in place of Inez and Sorum, who had other commitments. They played shows in the US, Europe, Japan and Australia before Geffen Records pulled their financial support for the tour, with Slash returning to Guns N&#x27; Roses and Slash&#x27;s Snakepit disbanding.

Following his departure from Guns N&#x27; Roses in 1996, Slash formed the cover band Slash&#x27;s Blues Ball. After a tour in 1997, Slash approached Blues Ball bassist Johnny Griparic about forming a new lineup of Slash&#x27;s Snakepit. The new lineup consisted of Slash, Griparic, singer Rod Jackson, guitarist Ryan Roxie, and drummer Matt Laug (Roxie and Laug were both former members of Alice Cooper&#x27;s solo band). They recorded and released their second album, entitled &quot;Ain&#x27;t Life Grand&quot;, in 2000, which was preceded by a tour supporting AC/DC and followed by their own headlining tour. For the tour, Keri Kelli joined the group in place of Ryan Roxie, who departed following the completion of the album. However, after the final show, Slash disbanded Snakepit due to a lack of commitment from his band members. Shortly after, Slash formed Velvet Revolver in 2002, along with drummer Matt Sorum, and Bassist Duff McKagan, both fellows Guns N&#x27; Roses members.

==History==

===Formation (1993–1994)===
Following the two and a half year world tour in support of the albums &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;, Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Slash returned to Los Angeles. He soon sold his home, the Walnut House, and moved to Mulholland Drive. He built a small home studio, nicknamed The Snakepit, over his garage and began working on demos for songs he had written during the tour. Slash worked on the demos with Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmate and drummer Matt Sorum. They were later joined by fellow Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmate Gilby Clarke and Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez, jamming and recording most nights. Slash played the demos for Guns N&#x27; Roses singer Axl Rose who rejected the material, though he would later want to use them for the next Guns N&#x27; Roses album. They had recorded twelve songs by 1994, the same year that Guns N&#x27; Roses went on hiatus.

Slash decided to record the Snakepit demos with Sorum, Clarke and Inez, later adding former Jellyfish live guitarist Eric Dover as lead vocalist. The decision to record with Dover led to a disagreement between Slash and Sorum, due to Slash not seeking Sorum&#x27;s approval before hiring Dover.

===&quot;It&#x27;s Five O&#x27;Clock Somewhere&quot; and breakup (1994–1996)===

Slash and Dover wrote the lyrics to all twelve songs with Slash using the songwriting to vent his frustrations at Guns N&#x27; Roses singer Rose. Clarke contributed the song &quot;Monkey Chow&quot; to the album while &quot;Jizz da Pit&quot; is an instrumental by Slash and Inez. They recorded the album at Conway Recording Studios and The Record Plant with Mike Clink and Slash co-producing and Steven Thompson and Michael Barbiero mixing, all of whom had worked with Guns N&#x27; Roses on their debut album &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;. The album featured contributions by Duff McKagan (who co-wrote &quot;Beggars &amp; Hangers-On&quot;), Dizzy Reed on keyboards, Teddy Andreadis on harmonica, and Paulinho da Costa on percussion. Slash&#x27;s brother, Ash Hudson, designed the album&#x27;s cover.

The resulting album, titled &quot;It&#x27;s Five O&#x27;Clock Somewhere&quot;, was released in February 1995 through Geffen Records. The album&#x27;s title was taken from a phrase Slash overheard at an airport. At the insistence of the record label, the album was released under the name Slash&#x27;s Snakepit, instead of The Snakepit, despite Slash not wanting his name used. Upon release, the album charted at number 70 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 15 on the UK Albums Chart. &quot;Beggars &amp; Hangers-On&quot; was released as the first, and only, single from the album; while a music video was also shot for &quot;Good to Be Alive&quot;, directed by August Jakobsson.
Critically, the album received mainly positive reviews. &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; stated that &quot;the sleazy, downtrodden blues hard rock [...] breaks new ground.&quot; AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine called Slash&#x27;s contributions &quot;quite amazing&quot;, though criticized the song-writing, stating &quot;it&#x27;s too bad that nobody in the band bothered to write any songs.&quot; Devon Jackson of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described the album as &quot;relaxed headbanging and Southern-tinged blues-rock&quot; while &quot;Classic Rock&quot; reviewer Malcolm Dome stated &quot;musically, it&#x27;s a loose-limbed record that has a lot of heavy guitar-led punk-style pop-rock.&quot; Slash&#x27;s Snakepit toured in support of the album, with bassist James LoMenzo and drummer Brian Tichy, of Pride &amp; Glory, replacing Inez and Sorum, who had opted out of touring, with Sorum returning to Guns N&#x27; Roses. They toured the US, Europe, Japan and Australia with Slash stating that &quot;for the first time in years, touring was easy, [his] band mates were loads of fun and low on drama, and every gig was about playing rock and roll.&quot; While booking another leg of the tour, Slash was informed by Geffen that Rose was ready to begin work on the new Guns N&#x27; Roses album and that he was to return to Los Angeles. Geffen pulled financial support for the band&#x27;s tour with Slash&#x27;s Snakepit disbanding soon after.

===Slash&#x27;s Blues Ball and reformation (1996–1999)===

Slash departed Guns N&#x27; Roses in 1996, due to musical differences between himself and singer Axl Rose. Following his departure, Slash toured Japan for two weeks with Chic, and worked on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Curdled&quot;. He later began touring in a blues cover band that eventually became Slash&#x27;s Blues Ball. Aside from Slash, the band consisted of Teddy Andreadis, guitarist Bobby Schneck, bassist Johnny Griparic, saxophonist Dave McClarem and drummer Alvino Bennett. The band toured on and off until 1998, which included a headline slot at a jazz festival in Budapest. They covered various artists and bands such as B.B. King, Steppenwolf, Otis Redding, as well as Guns N&#x27; Roses and early Slash&#x27;s Snakepit material.

Following a tour in 1997, Slash approached Griparic about forming a new lineup of Slash&#x27;s Snakepit They began looking for a singer, receiving over 300 audition tapes from mostly unknown singers. Jon Stevens of Noiseworks, who had been recording with Slash, was seen as a potential singer in early 1998. However, he returned to Australia to continue his solo career. They eventually chose Rod Jackson (earlier of Virginia-based band Ragdoll) after Griparic played a tape of him for Slash. Completing the lineup were guitarist Ryan Roxie, formerly of Alice Cooper, and drummer Matt Laug, also from Alice Cooper and the band Venice. They began rehearsing at Mates Studio before rehearsing and recording in Slash&#x27;s new home studio in Beverly Hills.

===&quot;Ain&#x27;t Life Grand&quot; and second breakup (1999–2002)===
The band began recording material with producer Jack Douglas at Slash&#x27;s home studio as well as Ocean Way Recording. The recording featured contributions by Teddy Andreadis, Jimmy Zavala and Lee Thornburg, amongst others. Initially, the label was positive about the album, setting a release date for February 22, 2000. However, when Slash was informed by Geffen, who had folded into Interscope Records, that the album was not the type of music the label produced, he bought the album back and signed a deal with Koch Records. Following the completion of the album, Roxie departed the band with former Big Bang Babies, Warrant and Ratt guitarist Keri Kelli joining in his place.

&quot;Ain&#x27;t Life Grand&quot; was released on October 20, 2000 through Koch with &quot;Mean Bone&quot; released as the first single. The album did not sell as well as its predecessor, and critical reception to it was mixed. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer Tony Scherman stated that &quot;Slash&#x27;s playing is as flashily incendiary as ever, but the songs and arrangements recycle hard-rock cliches worthier of Ratt than of a bona fide guitar god&quot;. Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted that &quot;great guitarists need great bands, and the Snakepit dudes are barely functional backup peons&quot;. Steve Huey of Allmusic noted that &quot;the new Snakepit does kick up a lot of noise as the album rushes by, and the strong chemistry between the members is immediately obvious&quot;. However, he stated that songwriting was the main problem, and that &quot;it never rises above the level of solid, and too many tracks are by-the-numbers hard rock at best (and pedestrian at worst)&quot;. The band were dropped by Koch two months following the album&#x27;s release.

Prior to the album&#x27;s release, Slash&#x27;s Snakepit supported AC/DC on their &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot; tour from August to September, followed by their own headlining tour of theaters. They played only the first two shows on the winter leg of AC/DC&#x27;s tour. After falling ill and checking into a hospital in Pittsburgh, Slash was ordered by his doctor to stay at home to recuperate, reportedly from pneumonia. Due to this, Slash&#x27;s Snakepit pulled out of supporting AC/DC in early 2001. Slash later revealed in his self-titled biography that he had actually suffered cardiac myopathy caused by years of alcohol and drug abuse, with his heart swelling to the point of rupture. After being fitted with a defibrillator and undergoing physical therapy, Slash returned to the group to continue touring. They later rescheduled their US tour, performing shows from June 16 – July 18, co-headlining three shows with Billy Idol. Following the tour, Slash hid in the tour bus, waiting for the rest of the band to go home. He then announced the disbanding of Slash&#x27;s Snakepit in an announcement made in early 2002. He cited, in particular, Jackson&#x27;s poor work ethic and unreliability.

===Post–breakup activities===
Following the breakup of Slash&#x27;s Snakepit, Slash announced he was to begin working on a solo album. Instead he later worked with The Black Crowes drummer Steve Gorman and an unnamed bassist on a new project. Together with his former Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmates Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum, they formed The Project, that eventually became the hard rock supergroup Velvet Revolver following the addition of former Wasted Youth guitarist Dave Kushner, and then-former Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland. They released their debut album &quot;Contraband&quot;, in 2004, followed by &quot;Libertad&quot; in 2007, before they parted ways with Weiland and went on hiatus in 2008. With Velvet Revolver on hiatus, Slash began work on his debut solo album. &quot;Slash&quot; was released on March 31, 2010, and featured a number of guests such as Andrew Stockdale of Wolfmother, M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold, Kid Rock, Ozzy Osbourne, Myles Kennedy of Alter Bridge, and Fergie. His band for the tour in support of the album consisted of Kennedy, bassist Todd Kerns, and drummer Brent Fitz. It also included guitarist Bobby Schneck, formerly of Slash&#x27;s Blues Ball.

==Musical style==
Slash&#x27;s Snakepit&#x27;s music was often described as hard rock and blues rock with elements of southern rock. The band were also often described as Slash&#x27;s solo or side project though Slash maintained that they were a band, stating &quot;everybody wrote, everybody had equal input even though I had my name on it.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer J.D. Considine noted the differences between Guns N&#x27; Roses and Slash&#x27;s Snakepit on their first album, stating that &quot;Guns [N]&#x27; Roses typically treat the melody as the most important part of the song, most of what slithers out of the Snakepit emphasizes the playing.&quot; He noted that singer Eric Dover &quot;conveys the raw-throated intensity of a hard-rock frontman&quot; and &quot;he avoids the genre&#x27;s most obvious excesses.&quot; The riff to &quot;Good to Be Alive&quot; drew a comparison to Chuck Berry while the musicianship on the album was praised. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic stated that &quot;there&#x27;s little argument that Slash is a great guitarist&quot; who is &quot;capable of making rock and blues clichés sound fresh&quot;. Reviewing &quot;Ain&#x27;t Life Grand&quot; for Allmusic, Steve Huey described second singer Rod Jackson as &quot;a combination of &#x27;80s pop-metal bluster and Faces-era Rod Stewart&quot; with a &quot;touch of Aerosmith&quot;, a description that he felt also fitted the band as a whole. He noted, though, that Slash&#x27;s guitar playing was &quot;tame&quot; and stated that the main problem of the album was the songwriting, though it was &quot;still a passable, workmanlike record that will definitely appeal to fans of grimy, old-school hard rock.&quot; Malcolm Dome of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; stated that &quot;from the moment that &quot;Been There Lately&quot; opens, there&#x27;s a vibe here that was missing before&quot; and that &quot;Ain&#x27;t Life Grand&quot; showed &quot;purpose, direction and individuality.&quot;

<text>The three-year Carolingian Civil War culminated in the decisive Battle of Fontenoy, also called the Battle of Fontenoy-en-Puisaye, fought at Fontenoy, near Auxerre, on 25 June 841. The war was fought to decide the territorial inheritances of Charlemagne&#x27;s grandsonsthe division of the Carolingian Empire among the three surviving sons of Louis the Pious. Despite Louis&#x27; provisions for succession, war broke out between his sons and nephews. The battle has been described as a major defeat for the allied forces of Lothair I of Italy and Pepin II of Aquitaine, and a victory for Charles the Bald and Louis the German. Hostilities dragged on for another two years until the Treaty of Verdun, which had a major influence on subsequent European history.

Although the battle is known to have been large, it was not well documented. Many historical sources are believed to have been destroyed after the war, leaving scant records from which to conjecture the numbers of combatants and casualties.

==Background==
Louis the Pious throughout his long reign had entreated to divide his empire meritoriously amongst his sons—&quot;all&quot; his sons—as it was required by the Salic Law of the Franks. With the late-born Charles, his attempts led to civil wars which culminated in his vindicating defeat of his last rebellious son, Louis, in 839. At Worms, on 30 May that year, he divided his empire for the last time, giving Lothair the kingdom he already held (Italy) and the imperial title, with all the other lands of the east and Charles receiving all the lands of the west. Louis was left with Bavaria while Pepin, his grandson, was left out of the inheritance.

On 24 July 840 in Strasbourg, Lothair precipitated a new civil war by declaring his &quot;imperium&quot; over all the lands of the empire and, joining with his nephew Pepin, attacked the Loire Valley. The barons of Burgundy divided over allegiance to Charles and Lothair. Ermenaud III of Auxerre, Arnoul of Sens, and Audri of Autun pledged themselves for Lothair, while Guerin of Provence and Aubert of Avallon remained with Charles. Girard II, Count of Paris, Lothair&#x27;s son-in-law, joined Lothair also. In March 841, the Burgundians faithful to Charles accompanied Guerin to join him and in May, Louis of Bavaria and his troops met Charles army at Châlons-sur-Marne. In June, Pepin finally joined with Lothair in Auxerre.

==Battle==
The two armies met on 25 June. According to tradition, Charles established his camp at Thury, on the hill of Roichat. Lothair and Pepin initiated battle and took the upper hand until the arrival of Guerin and his army of Provençals. While Pepin and his contingent continued to push back Charles&#x27; men, Lothair was slowly pushed back by Louis the German and the Provençals. Finally, when victory seemed sure for Charles, Bernard of Septimania entered the conflict on his side and the victory became a rout. According to Andreas Agnellus of Ravenna a total of 40,000 men died, including Gerard of Auvergne and Ricwin of Nantes, who fell at Charles&#x27; side.

&quot;Neither dew nor showers nor rain ever fell again on that field where the most battle-hardened warriors had perished mourned by their mothers, their sisters, their brothers, and their friends. On Charles&#x27; side and Louis&#x27; too, the fields were white with the linen habits of the dead as they might have been with birds in the autumn.&quot;

In spite of his personal gallantry, Lothair was defeated and fled to his capital of Aachen. With fresh troops he entered upon a war of plunder, but the forces of his brothers were too strong for him, and taking with him such treasure as he could collect, he abandoned to them his capital.

==Angelbert&#x27;s account==
On the pedestal is written: The victory of Charles the Bald separated France from the Western Empire, and founded the independence of French nationality.

Verses by Angelbert, who fought the battle on the side of Lothar are cited by historian Eleanor Shipley Duckett as the &quot;Most striking of all these Latin records of the battle&quot;.
The verses in English are...
&lt;poem&gt;
Fontenoy they call its fountain, manor to the peasant known,
There the slaughter, there the ruin, of the blood of Frankish race;
Plains and forest shiver, shudder; horror wakes the silent marsh.

Neither dew nor shower nor rainfall yields its freshness to that field,
Where they fell, the strong men fighting, shrewdest in the battle&#x27;s skill,
Father, mother, sister, brother, friends, the dead with tears have wept.

And this deed of crime accomplished, which I here in verse have told,
Angibert myself I witnessed, fighting with the other men,
I alone of all remaining, in the battle&#x27;s foremost line.

On the side alike of Louis, on the side of Charles alike,
Lies the field in white enshrouded, in the vestments of the dead,
As it lies when birds in autumn settle white off the shore.

Woe unto that day of mourning! Never in the round of years
Be it numbered in men&#x27;s annals! Be it banished from all mind,
Never gleam of sun shine on it, never dawn its dusk awake.

Night it was, a night most bitter, harder than we could endure,
When they fell, the brave men fighting, shrewdest in the battle&#x27;s skill,
Father, mother, sister, brother, friends, the dead with tears have wept.

Now the wailing, the lamenting, now no longer will I tell;
Each, so far as in him lieth, let him stay his weeping now;
On their souls may He have mercy, let us pray the Lord of all.
&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="159676" wikidata="Q150735" url="?curid=159676" title="Lothair I">
<text>Lothair I (9th. C. Frankish: &quot;Ludher&quot; and Medieval Latin: &quot;Lodharius&quot;; Dutch and Medieval Latin: &quot;Lotharius&quot;; German: &quot;Lothar&quot;; French: &quot;Lothaire&quot;; Italian: &quot;Lotario&quot;; 795 – 29 September 855) was a 9th-century Carolingian emperor (817–855, with his father until 840) and king of Italy (818–855) and Middle Francia (843–855).

Lothair I was the eldest son of the Carolingian emperor Louis I and his wife Ermengarde of Hesbaye, daughter of Ingerman the duke of Hesbaye. On several occasions, Lothair led his full-brothers Pepin I of Aquitaine and Louis the German in revolt against their father to protest against attempts to make their half-brother Charles the Bald a co-heir to the Frankish domains. Upon the father&#x27;s death, Charles and Louis joined forces against Lothair in a three-year civil war (840–843). The struggles between the brothers led directly to the breakup of the Frankish Empire assembled by their grandfather Charlemagne, and laid the foundation for the development of modern France and Germany.

== Early life and reign ==
Lothair was born in 795, to Louis the Pious and Ermengarde of Hesbaye. His father was the son of the reigning Emperor, Charlemagne. Little is known of Lothair&#x27;s early life, which was probably passed at the court of his grandfather Charlemagne. In 814, the elderly emperor died, and left his sole surviving legitimate son Louis the Pious as successor to his vast empire. The next year, Lothair would be sent to govern Bavaria for his father, the new emperor. In 817, Louis the Pious drew up his &quot;Ordinatio Imperii&quot;. In this, Louis designated Lothair as his principal heir and ordered that Lothair would be the overlord of Louis&#x27; younger sons Pippin of Aquitaine (who was 20) and Louis the German (who was 13), as well as his nephew (Lothair&#x27;s cousin) Bernard of Italy. Lothair would also inherit their lands if they were to die childless. Lothair, aged 22, was then crowned joint emperor by his father at Aachen. At the same time, Aquitaine and Bavaria were granted to his brothers Pippin and Louis, respectively, as subsidiary kingdoms. Following the death of Bernard, brought on by his plotting against and blinding by Louis the Pious, Lothair also received the Kingdom of Italy. In 821, Lothair married Ermengarde (d. 851), daughter of Hugh the Count of Tours.

In 822, he assumed the government of Italy, and at Easter, 5 April 823, he was crowned emperor again by Pope Paschal I, this time at Rome. In November 824, Lothair promulgated a statute, the &quot;Constitutio Romana&quot;, concerning the relations of pope and emperor, which reserved the supreme power to the secular potentate, and he afterwards issued various ordinances for the good government of Italy.

On Lothair&#x27;s return to his father&#x27;s court, his stepmother Judith won his consent to her plan for securing a kingdom for her son Charles, a scheme which was carried out in 829, when the young prince was given Alemannia as king. Lothair, however, soon changed his attitude and spent the succeeding decade in constant strife over the division of the Empire with his father. He was alternately master of the Empire, and banished and confined to Italy, at one time taking up arms in alliance with his brothers and at another fighting against them, whilst the bounds of his appointed kingdom were in turn extended and reduced.

== Division of the kingdom ==
The first rebellion began in 830. All three brothers fought their father, whom they deposed. In 831, their father was reinstated and he deprived Lothair of his imperial title and gave Italy to Charles. The second rebellion was instigated by Angilbert II, Archbishop of Milan in 833, and again Louis was deposed in 834. Lothair, through the loyalty of the Lombards and later reconciliations, retained Italy and the imperial position through all remaining divisions of the Empire by his father.


When Louis the Pious was dying in 840, he sent the imperial insignia to Lothair, who, disregarding the various partitions, claimed the whole of the Empire. He was 45 years old when his father died. Negotiations with his brother Louis the German and his half-brother Charles, both of whom resisted this claim, were followed by an alliance of the younger brothers against Lothair. A decisive battle was fought at Fontenay-en-Puisaye on 25 June 841, when, in spite of his and his allied nephew Pepin II of Aquitaine&#x27;s personal gallantry, Lothair was defeated and fled to Aachen. With fresh troops he began a war of plunder, but the forces of his brothers were too strong, and taking with him such treasure as he could collect, he abandoned his capital to them. He met with the leaders of the &quot;Stellinga&quot; in Speyer and promised them his support in return for theirs, but Louis and then the native Saxon nobility put down the &quot;Stellinga&quot; in the next years.

Peace negotiations began, and in June 842 the brothers met on an island in the Saône. They agreed to an arrangement which developed, after much difficulty and delay, into the Treaty of Verdun, signed in August 843. By this, Lothair received the imperial title as well as northern Italy and a long stretch of territory from the North Sea to the Mediterranean, essentially along the valleys of the Rhine and the Rhône; this territory includes the regions Lorraine, Alsace, Burgundy, and Provence. He soon ceded Italy to his eldest son, Louis, and remained in his new kingdom, engaging in alternate quarrels and reconciliations with his brothers and in futile efforts to defend his lands from the attacks of the Northmen (as Vikings were known in Frankish writings) and the Saracens (as those loyal to the various Fatimids, Umayyads and Abbasides are known in Frankish writings).

In 845 the count of Arles, Fulcrad, led a rebellion in Provence. The emperor put it down and the count joined him in an expedition against the Saracens in Italy in 846.

== Death and aftermath ==
In 855 he became seriously ill, and despairing of recovery renounced the throne, divided his lands among his three sons, and on 23 September entered the monastery of Prüm, where he died six days later. He was buried at Prüm, where his remains were found in 1860. It was at Prüm that Lothair was most commemorated.

The same year, Lothair&#x27;s kingdom was divided between his three sons in a deal called the Treaty of Prüm: the eldest, Louis II, received Italy and the title of emperor; the second, Lothair II, received Lotharingia; the youngest, Charles, received Provence.
