<text>Maximilian Schell (8 December 1930 – 1 February 2014) was a Swiss actor. Born in Austria, his parents were involved in the arts and he grew up surrounded by performance and literature. While he was still a child, his family fled to Switzerland in 1938 when Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany, and they settled in Zürich. After World War II ended, Schell took up acting and directing full-time. 

Schell won the Academy Award for Best Actor for playing a lawyer in the legal drama &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; (1961). He was Oscar-nominated for playing a character with multiple identities in &quot;The Man in the Glass Booth&quot; (1975) and for playing a man resisting Nazism in &quot;Julia&quot; (1977). Fluent in both English and German, Schell earned top billing in a number of Nazi-era themed films. He acted in films such as &quot;Topkapi&quot; (1964), &quot;The Deadly Affair&quot; (1967), &quot;Counterpoint&quot; (1968), &quot;Simón Bolívar&quot; (1969), &quot;The Odessa File&quot; (1974), &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977), and &quot;Deep Impact&quot; (1998).

On television, he received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for the NBC film &quot;Miss Rose White&quot; and the HBO television film &quot;Stalin&quot; (1992), the later of which earned him the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film. He also portrayed Otto Frank in the TV film &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; (1980), the Russian emperor Peter the Great in the NBC series &quot;Peter the Great&quot; (1986), Frederick the Great in the British series &quot;Young Catherine&quot; (1991), and Brother Jean le Maistre in the miniseries &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1999).

Schell also performed in a number of stage plays, including a celebrated performance as Prince Hamlet. Schell was an accomplished pianist and conductor, performing with Claudio Abbado and Leonard Bernstein, and with orchestras in Berlin and Vienna. His elder sister was the internationally noted actress Maria Schell; he produced the documentary tribute &quot;My Sister Maria&quot; in 2002.

== Early life and education ==
Schell was born in Vienna, Austria, the son of Margarethe (née Noe von Nordberg), an actress who ran an acting school, and Hermann Ferdinand Schell, a Swiss poet, novelist, playwright, and pharmacy owner. His parents were Roman Catholic.

Schell&#x27;s father was never enthusiastic about young Maximilian becoming an actor like his mother, feeling that it could not lead to &quot;real happiness&quot;. However, Schell was surrounded by acting in his early youth:

The Schell family fled from Vienna in 1938 to get &quot;away from Hitler&quot; after the Anschluss, when Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany. They resettled in Zürich, Switzerland.

In Zürich, Schell &quot;grew up reading the classics&quot; and, when he was ten, wrote his first play. Schell recalls that as a child, growing up surrounded by the theatre, he took acting for granted and did not want to become an actor at first: &quot;What I wanted was to become a painter, a musician, or a playwright,&quot; like his father.

Schell later attended the University of Zurich for a year, where he also played soccer and was on the rowing team, along with writing for newspapers as a part-time journalist for income. Following the end of World War II, he moved to Germany where he enrolled in the University of Munich and studied philosophy and art history. During breaks, he would sometimes return home to Zürich or stay at his family&#x27;s farm in the country so he could write in seclusion:

Schell then returned to Zürich, where he served in the Swiss Army for a year, after which he attended the sixth form of University College School, London, for one year before re-entering the University of Zurich for another year, and later, the University of Basel for six months. During that period, he acted professionally in small parts, in both classical and modern plays, and decided that he would from then on devote his life to acting rather than pursue academic studies:

Schell began acting at the Basel Theatre.

His elder sister Maria Schell was also an actor, as were their siblings, Carl (1927–2019) and Immaculata &quot;Immy&quot; Schell (1935–1992).

==Career==
=== 1955–1959: Early work and theater roles === 
Schell&#x27;s film debut was in the German anti-war film &quot;Kinder, Mütter und ein General&quot; (&quot;Children, Mothers, and a General&quot;, 1955). It was the story of five mothers who confronted a German general at the front line, after learning that their sons, some as young as 15, had been &quot;slated to be cannon fodder on behalf of the Third Reich.&quot; The film co-starred Klaus Kinski as an officer, with Schell playing the part of an officer-deserter. The story, which according to one critic, &quot;depicts the insanity of continuing to fight a war that is lost,&quot; would become a &quot;trademark&quot; for many of Schell&#x27;s future roles: &quot;Schell&#x27;s sensitivity in his portrayal of a young deserter disillusioned with fighting became a trademark of his acting.&quot;

Schell subsequently acted in seven more films made in Europe before going to the U.S. Among those was &quot;The Plot to Assassinate Hitler&quot; (also 1955). Later in the same year he had a supporting role in &quot;Jackboot Mutiny&quot;, in which he plays &quot;a sensitive philosopher&quot;, who uses ethics to privately debate the arguments for assassinating Hitler.

In 1958 Schell was invited to the United States to act in the Broadway play, &quot;Interlock&quot; by Ira Levin, in which Schell played the role of an aspiring concert pianist. He made his Hollywood debut in the World War II film, &quot;The Young Lions&quot; (1958), as the commanding German officer in another anti-war story, with Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift. German film historian Robert C. Reimer writes that the film, directed by Edward Dmytryk, again drew on Schell&#x27;s German characterisation to &quot;portray young officers disillusioned with a war that no longer made sense.&quot;

In 1960, Schell returned to Germany and played the title role in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; for German TV, a role that he would play on two more occasions in live theatre productions during his career. Along with Laurence Olivier, Schell is considered &quot;one of the greatest Hamlets ever,&quot; according to one writer. Schell recalled that when he played Hamlet for the first time, &quot;it was like falling in love with a woman. ... not until I acted the part of Hamlet did I have a moment when I knew I was in love with acting.&quot; Schell&#x27;s performance of Hamlet was featured as one of the last episodes of the American comedy series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; in 1999.

=== 1960–1979: Breakthrough and acclaim ===

In 1959, Schell acted in the role of a defence attorney on a live TV production, &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot;, a fictionalized re-creation of the Nuremberg War Trials, in an edition of &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;. His performance in the TV drama was considered so good that he and Werner Klemperer were among the only members of the original cast selected to play the same parts in the 1961 film version. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor, which was the first win for a German-speaking actor since World War II. After winning the New York Film Critics award for his role, Schell recalled the pride he felt upon receiving a letter from his older sister Maria Schell, who was already an award-winning actress, &quot;I received the most wonderful letter from Maria. She wrote, &#x27;Now, when you have my letter in your hand, a beautiful day is coming for you. I will be with you, proud, because I knew such recognition would come one day, leading to something even greater and better. . . . not only because you are close to me but because I count you among the truly great actors, and it is wonderful that besides that you are my brother.&#x27; Maria and I are very close&quot;.

According to Reimer, Schell gave a &quot;bravura performance,&quot; where he tried to defend his clients, Nazi judges, &quot;by arguing that all Germans share a collective guilt&quot; for what happened. Biographer James Curtis notes that Schell prepared for his part in the movie by &quot;reading the entire forty-volume record of the Nuremberg trials.&quot; Author Barry Monush describes the impact of Schell&#x27;s acting, &quot;Again, on the big screen, he was nothing short of electrifying as the counselor whose determination to place the blame for the Holocaust on anyone else but his clients, and brings morality into question&quot;.

Producer-director Stanley Kramer assembled a star-studded ensemble cast which included Spencer Tracy and Burt Lancaster. They &quot;worked for nominal wages out of a desire to see the film made and for the opportunity to appear in it,&quot; notes film historian George McManus. Actor William Shatner remembers that, prior to the actual filming, &quot;we understood the importance of the film we were making.&quot; It was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, winning two. In 2011, Schell appeared at a 50th anniversary tribute to the film and his Oscar win, held in Los Angeles at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, where he spoke about his career and the film.

Beginning in 1968 Schell began writing, producing, directing and acting in a number of his own films: Among those were &quot;The Castle&quot; (1968), a German film based on the novel by Franz Kafka, about a man trapped in a bureaucratic nightmare. Soon after he made &quot;Erste Liebe (First Love)&quot; (1970), based on a novel by Ivan Turgenev. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

Schell&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Pedestrian&quot; (1974), is about a German tycoon &quot;haunted by his Nazi past&quot;. In this film, notes one critic, &quot;Schell probes the conscience and guilt in terms of the individual and of society, reaching to the universal heart of responsibility and moral inertia.&quot; It was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar and was a &quot;great and commercial success in Germany,&quot; notes Roger Ebert.

Schell then produced, directed, and acted as a supporting character in &quot;End of the Game&quot; (1975), a German crime thriller starring Jon Voight and Jacqueline Bisset. A few years later he co-wrote and directed the Austrian film &quot;Tales from the Vienna Woods&quot; (1979). He had previously (1977) directed a stage production of the original play of that name by Ödön von Horváth at the National Theatre in London.
During his career, as one of the few German-speaking actors working in English-language films, Schell was top billed in a number of Nazi-era themed films, including &quot;Counterpoint&quot; (1968), &quot;The Odessa File&quot; (1974)&quot;, The Man in the Glass Booth&quot; (1975), &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977), &quot;Cross of Iron&quot; (1977) and &quot;Julia&quot; (1977). For the latter film, directed by Fred Zinnemann, Schell was again nominated for an Oscar for his supporting role as an anti-Nazi activist.

In a number of films Schell played the role of a Jewish character: as Otto Frank, Anne Frank&#x27;s father, in &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; (1980); as the modern Zionist father in &quot;The Chosen&quot; (1981); in 1996, he played an Auschwitz survivor in &quot;Through Roses&quot;, a German film, written and directed by Jürgen Flimm; and in &quot;Left Luggage&quot; (1998) he played the father of a Jewish family.

In &quot;The Man in the Glass Booth&quot; (1975), adapted from the stage play by Robert Shaw, Schell played both a Nazi officer and a Jewish Holocaust survivor, in a character with a double identity. Roger Ebert describes the main character, Albert Goldman, as &quot;mad, and immensely complicated, and he is hidden in a maze of identities so thick that no one knows for sure who he really is.&quot; Schell, who at that period in his career saw himself primarily as a director, felt compelled to accept the part when it was offered to him:

Schell&#x27;s acting in the film has been compared favorably to his other leading roles, with film historian Annette Insdorf writing, &quot;Maximilian Schell is even more compelling as the quick-tempered, quicksilver Goldman than in his previous Holocaust-related roles, including &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; and &quot;The Condemned of Altona&quot;&quot;. She gives a number of examples of Schell&#x27;s acting intensity, including the courtroom scenes, where Schell&#x27;s character, after supposedly being exposed as a German officer, &quot;attacks Jewish meekness&quot; in his defense, and &quot;boasts that the Jews were sheep who didn&#x27;t believe what was happening.&quot; The film eventually suggests that Schell&#x27;s character is in fact a Jew, but one whose sanity has been compromised by &quot;survivor guilt.&quot; Schell was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor for his performance. To avoid being typecast, Schell also played more diverse characters in numerous films throughout his career: he played a museum treasure thief in &quot;Topkapi&quot; (1964); the eponymous Venezuelan revolutionary in &quot;Simón Bolívar&quot; (1969); a 19th-century ship captain in &quot;Krakatoa, East of Java&quot; (1969); a Captain Nemo-esque scientist/starship commander in the science fiction film, &quot;The Black Hole&quot; (1979). 

===1980–2009: Career fluctuations ===

He took roles such as the Russian emperor in the television miniseries, &quot;Peter the Great&quot; (1986), opposite Laurence Olivier, Vanessa Redgrave, and Trevor Howard, which won an Emmy Award; a comedy role with Marlon Brando in &quot;The Freshman&quot; (1990); Reese Witherspoon&#x27;s surrogate grandfather in &quot;A Far Off Place&quot;; a treacherous Cardinal in &quot;John Carpenter&#x27;s Vampires&quot; (1998); as Frederick the Great in a TV film, &quot;Young Catherine&quot; (1991); as Vladimir Lenin in the TV series, &quot;Stalin&quot; (1992), for which he won the Golden Globe Award; a Russian KGB colonel in &quot;Candles in the Dark&quot; (1993); the Pharaoh in &quot;Abraham&quot; (1994); and Tea Leoni&#x27;s father in the science fiction thriller, &quot;Deep Impact&quot; (1998).

From the 1990s until late in his career, Schell appeared in many German-language made-for-TV films, such as the 2003 film &quot;Alles Glück dieser Erde&quot; (&quot;All the Luck in the World&quot;) opposite Uschi Glas and in the television miniseries &quot;&quot; (2004), which was based on Henning Mankell&#x27;s novel &quot;The Return of the Dancing Master&quot;. In 2006 he appeared in the stage play of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Resurrection Blues&quot;, directed by Robert Altman, which played in London at the Old Vic. In 2007, he played the role of Albert Einstein on the German television series &quot;Giganten&quot; (Giants), which enacted the lives of people important in German history.

Schell also served as a writer, producer and director for a variety of films, including the documentary film &quot;Marlene&quot; (1984), with the participation of Marlene Dietrich. It was nominated for an Oscar, received the New York Film Critics Award and the German Film Award. Originally, Dietrich, then 83 years of age, had agreed to allow Schell to interview and film her in the privacy of her apartment. However, after he began filming, she changed her mind and refused to allow any actual video footage of her be shown. During a videotaped interview, Schell described the difficulties he had while making the film.

Schell creatively showed only silhouettes of her along with old film clips during their interview soundtrack. According to one review, &quot;the true originality of the movie is the way it pursues the clash of temperament between interviewer and star. . . . he draws her out, taunting her into a fascinating display of egotism, lying and contentiousness.&quot;

Schell produced &quot;My Sister Maria&quot; in 2002, an intimate documentary about his sister, the noted actress Maria Schell. In the film, he chronicles her life, career and eventual diminished capacity due to illness. The film, made three years before her death, shows her mental and physical frailty, leading to her withdrawing from the world. In 2002, upon the completion of the film, they both received Bambi Awards, and were honored for their lifetime achievements and in recognition of the film.

==Personal life==
=== Marriages and relationships ===

During the 1960s Schell had a three-year-long affair with Soraya Esfandiary-Bakhtiary, former second wife of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran. He also was rumored to have been engaged to the first African-American Supermodel Donyale Luna in the mid 1960s. In 1971 he had an affair with Neile Adams, according to her. In 1985, he met the Russian actress Natalya Andrejchenko, whom he married in June 1985; their daughter Nastassja was born in 1989. After 2002, separated from his wife (whom he divorced in 2005), Schell had a relationship with the Austrian art historian Elisabeth Michitsch. In 2008 he became romantically involved with German opera singer Iva Mihanovic, who was 48 years his junior. They eventually married on 20 August 2013.

=== Interest in classical music ===
Schell was a semi-professional pianist for much of his life. He had a piano when he lived in Munich and said that he would play for hours at a time for his own pleasure and to help him relax: &quot;I find I need to rest. An actor must have pauses in between work, to renew himself, to read, to walk, to chop wood.&quot; Conductor Leonard Bernstein claimed that Schell was a &quot;remarkably good pianist.&quot; In 1982 on a program filmed for the U.S. television network PBS, Schell read from Beethoven&#x27;s letters to the audience before Bernstein conducted the Vienna Philharmonic playing Beethoven symphonies.

In 1983, he and Bernstein co-hosted an 11-part TV series, &quot;Bernstein/Beethoven&quot;, featuring nine live symphonies, along with discussions between Bernstein and Schell about Beethoven&#x27;s works.

On other occasions, Schell worked with Italian conductor Claudio Abbado and the Berlin Philharmonic, which included a performance in Chicago of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; and another in Jerusalem of Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;A Survivor from Warsaw&quot;. Schell also produced and directed a number of live operas, including Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot; for the Los Angeles Opera. He worked on the film project &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Fidelio,&quot; with Plácido Domingo and Kent Nagano.

Schell was a guest professor at the University of Southern California and was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Spertus Institute for Jewish Learning and Leadership in Chicago.

=== Allegations of sexual abuse ===
In 1994, producer Diana Botsford sued Schell for sexual harassment, after he allegedly propositioned her and tried to fondle her while they were working together on a television movie she was an associate producer on. The lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount later that year.

In 2023, his niece Marie Theres Relin (daughter of Maria Schell), wrote in a book that she was abused and lost her virginity to an &quot;uncle&quot; in 1980, when she was 14. She later confirmed to the media that the uncle was Maximilian Schell. Shortly thereafter, Schell&#x27;s daughter Nastassja said to the media that she had known about this, and that she herself had also been sexually abused by her father as a child.

=== Illness and death ===
Schell died at the age of 83 on 1 February 2014, in Innsbruck, Austria, after a &quot;sudden and serious illness&quot;. The German television news service &quot;Tagesschau&quot; reported that he had been receiving treatment for pneumonia.
His funeral was attended by Waltraud Haas, Christian Wolff, Karl Spiehs, Lawrence David Foldes, Elisabeth Endriss, and Peter Kaiser. His grave is in Preitenegg/Carinthia (Austria).

<text>Stuart Maxwell Whitman (February 1, 1928 – March 16, 2020) was an American actor, known for his lengthy career in film and television. Whitman was born in San Francisco and raised in New York until the age of 12, when his family relocated to Los Angeles. In 1948, Whitman was discharged from the Corps of Engineers in the U.S. Army and started to study acting and appear in plays. From 1951 to 1957, Whitman had a streak working in mostly bit parts in films, including &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; (1951), &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951), &quot;Barbed Wire&quot; (1952) and &quot;The Man from the Alamo&quot; (1952). On television, Whitman guest-starred in series such as &quot;Dr. Christian&quot;, &quot;The Roy Rogers Show&quot;, and &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, and also had a recurring role on &quot;Highway Patrol.&quot; Whitman&#x27;s first lead role was in John H. Auer&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Trouble&quot; (1957).

In the late 1950s, 20th Century Fox was on a drive to develop new talent, hence Whitman was signed to the star-building program. Whitman, now in the lead cast, acted in &quot;Darby&#x27;s Rangers&quot; (1958), &quot;China Doll&quot; (1958), &quot;Ten North Frederick&quot; (1958)&quot;,&quot; &quot;The Decks Ran Red&quot; (1958), &quot;Hound-Dog Man&quot; (1959), &quot;These Thousand Hills&quot; (1959), &quot;The Story of Ruth&quot; (1960), &quot;Murder, Inc.&quot; (1960), &quot;The Comancheros&quot; (1961), and &quot;The Mark&quot; (1961), the latter of which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor.

Some of Whitman&#x27;s subsequent roles included &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962), &quot;The Day and the Hour&quot; (1962), &quot;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines&quot; (1965), &quot;Cimarron Strip&quot; (1967), and &quot;Night of the Lepus&quot; (1972). Whitman also acted regularly on television, with credits including &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;, &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Love, American Style&quot;, &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;, &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot;, &quot;The Pirate&quot;, &quot;Condominium&quot;, &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, &quot;Matt Houston,&quot; &quot;A-Team&quot;, &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Once Upon a Texas Train&quot;, &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.&quot; and &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;. From 1988 to 1992, he acted as Jonathan Kent on the TV series &quot;Superboy&quot;. He was seen in projects until 2000, after which he was reported to be retired, and died in 2020.

== Early life ==
Stuart Maxwell Whitman was born on February 1, 1928, in San Francisco, California, the elder of two sons of Cecilia (née Gold) and Joseph Whitman. His family was Jewish. His mother was a Russian Jewish immigrant, while his paternal grandparents were Polish Jews. However, in the 1950s, Whitman described himself to Hedda Hopper as &quot;a real American – have a little bit of English, Irish, Scotch, and Russian – so I get along with everyone.&quot;

Whitman was interested in acting from the age of five. His father at the time was working as a ticket collector at Tammany Hall, and he would sometimes be allowed to watch plays. His parents had married in their teens and traveled frequently during his childhood – his father became a lawyer who moved into property development. Whitman started his education in New York, in Manhattan and Poughkeepsie. &quot;I went to so many schools—26 in all!—that I was always an outsider,&quot; he later recalled. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t until high school that I could &quot;really&quot; read ... I always sat in the back of the room.&quot; Whitman&#x27;s early love for acting came through when he did three summer stock plays in New York when he was 12, but &quot;nobody took that seriously,&quot; he said.

His uncle thought he had potential as a boxer, and secretly trained him. When World War II broke out, Joseph Whitman moved to Los Angeles to run oil-cracking plants for the government. His family settled in Los Angeles, and Whitman graduated from Hollywood High School in 1945.

After school, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and served in the Corps of Engineers for three years at Fort Lewis, Washington. During this time, he occasionally boxed, winning 31 of his 32 bouts. Whitman was a lightweight boxer for the Army during his tenure. The boxing match for which he was most known was one where he had a difficult time against U.S. Army boxer Denny Dennison (né Archibald Dennison Scott III), against whom he had boxed at Hollywood High School. Denny, who had entered active duty in January 1944, after five months of the delayed-entry program, had defeated his third opponent, considered his toughest matchup. Whitman was honorably discharged from the Army in 1948, while his close friend, Scott, completed officer candidate school the following year, ending his service with the rank of colonel.

Whitman originally intended to follow his father into law and used the G.I. Bill to enroll in Los Angeles City College. He minored in drama. During his first year, he &quot;figured that law was a real bore&quot;, and began to develop ambitions to be an actor.

&quot;I reached a point where I said, &#x27;What are you going to do with your life? You got to get something going&#x27;&quot;, he said. &quot;I decided I wanted to spend most of my time on me. So I decided to develop me and educate me.&quot; &quot;My father wanted me to join his law firm and dabble in real estate on the side,&quot; recalled Whitman. &quot;There was a family row about boxing, but nothing like the battle when I told my father I was going to be an actor. He said, &#x27;If that&#x27;s the case, you&#x27;re on your own.&#x27; No money from him. And he kept his word.&quot;

His father did sell Whitman a bulldozer, which his son used to support himself in college. Whitman would hire it (and himself) out to others to clear lots, uproot trees, and level off rugged terrain. This work earned him up to $100 a day. He and his father later went into real estate development together, purchasing various lots in and around Los Angeles.

Whitman joined the Michael Chekhov Stage Society, and studied with them at night for four years. He was considering a career in professional football, but injured his leg at college. He joined the Ben Bard Drama School in Hollywood, and debuted in the school&#x27;s production of &quot;Here Comes Mr Jordan&quot;, which ran for six months.

==Career==
=== 1951 to 1959: Early roles and first leads ===
Whitman was spotted by a talent scout while at City College. He made his screen debut, credited as Kip Whitman, in a bit part in Rudolph Maté&#x27;s &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot;, which was released in November 1951. He followed this with another small part, using the same pseudonym, in Robert Wise&#x27;s &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, released in September of that same year.

In 1952, Whitman continued playing small roles, starting with George Archainbaud&#x27;s &quot;Barbed Wire&quot;, released in July, and Tay Garnett&#x27;s &quot;One Minute to Zero&quot;, released in August. In December 1952, he signed a contract with Universal, which put him in Douglas Sirk&#x27;s &quot;All I Desire&quot;, released in July 1953, and Jesse Hibbs&#x27;s &quot;The All American&quot;, released in October.

Whitman was still cast in small parts in features premiering in 1953. This began with Budd Boetticher&#x27;s &quot;The Man from the Alamo&quot;, released in August. Following this was Jacques Tourneur&#x27;s &quot;Appointment in Honduras&quot;, which premiered on October 16. The next was George Sherman&#x27;s &quot;The Veils of Bagdad&quot;, in November. Finally, Lloyd Bacon&#x27;s &quot;Walking My Baby Back Home&quot; started its theatrical run in December.

In 1954, Whitman continued to be seen in minor film roles. First was Charles Vidor&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody&quot; at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), on April 16. On May 14, it was Andrew Marton&#x27;s &quot;Prisoner of War,&quot; followed in June by Allan Dwan&#x27;s &quot;Silver Lode.&quot; On July 25, it was Lesley Selander&#x27;s &quot;Return from the Sea&quot;. Premiering on October 6 was &quot;Passion.&quot; He then appeared in &quot;Brigadoon&quot; on October 22. He starred on stage in Christopher Fry&#x27;s &quot;Venus Observed&quot; at the Coast Theatre in 1954. On television, Whitman acted in episodes of &quot;Dr. Christian&quot;, &quot;The Roy Rogers Show&quot;, and &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;.

On July 1, 1955, Whitman appeared as a man on the beach in Curtis Bernhardt&#x27;s &quot;Interrupted Melody&quot;. Also that year, Whitman had a minor role in the serial &quot;King of the Carnival&quot;.

In 1956, Whitman continued with the same types of roles, starting with Allan Dwan&#x27;s &quot;Hold Back the Night&quot; on July 29, followed by Budd Boetticher&#x27;s &quot;Seven Men from Now&quot; on August 4. Another acting credit was the Republic Pictures film &quot;Diane&quot;.

Starting that year, he began a recurring role as Sgt. Walters on the television series &quot;Highway Patrol,&quot; appearing in a total of sixteen episodes. Whitman explained that, at the time, he was working part-time in a slaughterhouse, and when he got the role, he and its star Broderick Crawford got along immediately and became friends. From that point on, whenever Whitman was low on cash, he would call Crawford who would gladly invite him to appear in another episode, on the premise that he could drink while Whitman handled most of the dialogue.

In 1957, Whitman&#x27;s film roles gradually grew in size with the following films: Gerd Oswald&#x27;s &quot;Crime of Passion&quot;, which opened in February, and Reginald Le Borg&#x27;s &quot;War Drums&quot;, in April. On September 21, Whitman had his first leading role in John H. Auer&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Trouble&quot;, produced by John Carroll, who had Whitman under contract for one film a year for seven years; the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said he &quot;reminds of both Robert Ryan and James Dean.&quot; In October, he appeared in two releases: &quot;Hell Bound&quot; and Howard W. Koch&#x27;s &quot;The Girl in Black Stockings&quot;. On November 30, it was Gordon Douglas&#x27; &quot;Bombers B-52&quot;. 

Early prominent roles in 1957 were in the syndicated military dramas &quot;Harbor Command&quot;, about the United States Coast Guard, and &quot;The Silent Service&quot;, based on true stories of the submarine service of the United States Navy. Around that time, Whitman acted in &quot;Until the Man Dies&quot;, episode 16 of the first season of &quot;Zane Grey Theater&quot;. 

=== 1958 to 1961: Success on and off the screen ===

By this time, Whitman&#x27;s side career as a real estate developer was thriving. He developed hundreds of acres in such places as Anaheim, Benedict Canyon, and Panorama City, often in partnership with his father. &quot;Because of it, I&#x27;ve never worked as an extra,&quot; he said in 1958. &quot;I&#x27;ve never accepted a part that I wouldn&#x27;t have thought advanced my career. I&#x27;ve never taken an acting job, in movies or TV, which paid less than $250 a week.&quot;

In the late 1950s, 20th Century Fox was on a drive to develop new talent. Head of production Buddy Adler said, &quot;We must bring young people back into film theatres and the best way is to develop young stars as a magnet. While stories have become more important than ever, we must seek our fresh, youthful talent to perform in them.&quot; Whitman was one of a number of new names signed to Fox by Adler as part of a $3–4 million star-building program. Whitman&#x27;s contract was for seven years.

In January 1958, William A. Wellman&#x27;s &quot;Darby&#x27;s Rangers&quot; premiered. During the film&#x27;s production, roles fluctuated: the lead, Charlton Heston, left the film and James Garner was given the lead, while Whitman wound up with Garner&#x27;s original role, which dominated the first half of the picture then barely appeared in the second half. Whitman was one of several actors who tested for the role of Bart Maverick In March 1958, the contract with FOX became exclusive. In June, production of Richard Fleischer&#x27;s &quot;These Thousand Hills&quot; began. In May, &quot;Ten North Frederick&quot; began its theatrical run. Whitman later said he did this to get a choice small part and &quot;many good things came from that&quot;. In August, Whitman appeared in &quot;China Doll&quot;.

In October, MGM&#x27;s production of Andrew L. Stone&#x27;s &quot;The Decks Ran Red&quot;, in which he was cast, was released. According to Whitman, he helped with the signing of his friend Broderick Crawford, promising the studio that Crawford would stay sober throughout the shoot. Crawford was hired and maintained his promise. 

At that time, director Andrew L. Stone wanted Whitman to appear in &quot;The Last Voyage&quot; (1960), but the role went to Robert Stack instead. Fox granted him another role when he replaced Robert Wagner in &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; (1959). Also in 1959, Whitman acted in &quot;The Last Laugh&quot;, the 20th episode of the first season of &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;. Another TV credit came with &quot;The Court of Last Resort&quot;, in an episode called &quot;The Westover Case&quot;.

In 1958, Hedda Hopper wrote a piece on Whitman which said he could be the &quot;new Clark Gable&quot;:This is a fresh personality with tremendous impact. He&#x27;s tall and lean with shock of unruly black hair and dark hazel eyes which harden to slate grey when he plays a bad man or turns on the heat in a love scene. When he comes into camera range, the audience sits up and says: &quot;Who dat?&quot;

In 1959, Whitman acted in several features. In February, Richard Fleischer&#x27;s Western &quot;These Thousand Hills&quot; premiered. In March, &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; was released. At Fox, Whitman graduated to leading-man parts. In November, Don Siegel&#x27;s &quot;Hound-Dog Man&quot; premiered. Whitman had an excellent role co-starring with Fabian Forte playing his &quot;fourth heel in a row... I had a ball because the character was a real louse, everything hanging off him and no inhibitions. I like those kind of guys, I suppose because I can&#x27;t be that way myself.&quot;

In May 1960, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; did a profile on Whitman, calling him &quot;an actor of growing importance in a business that needs stalwarts to follow in the steps of the Clark Gables, Gary Coopers, and John Waynes... Whitman is like a finely trained athletic champion – a modest but self-assured chap who seems to know where he is going.&quot;

The premiere of Henry Koster&#x27;s Biblical drama &quot;The Story of Ruth&quot;, in which Whitman had replaced Stephen Boyd as Boaz, was in June 1960. Whitman&#x27;s next release was in July, with the gangster tale &quot;Murder, Inc.&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;ve done lots of different parts since I left Hollywood High School and City College&quot;, said Whitman in a 1960 interview, &quot;so the sudden switch didn&#x27;t bother me too much. I hope 20th Century Fox will keep the roles varied and interesting.&quot; Whitman said the production of &quot;Murder, Inc.&quot; was troubled. First, when he was reading the script, he was under the impression that he was going to play the role for which Peter Falk was already cast, but he was actually cast as the romantic lead. Additionally, director Stuart Rosenberg was fired by the studio because they felt he was taking too much time setting up shots. Once fired, an actor&#x27;s sitdown strike began, and it was announced that a full strike was going to happen. This put the studio under pressure to finish the project, hence producer Burt Balaban, who shares the directorial credit with Rosenberg, stepped in and finished the film in a week, and on the exact day when the strike started.

In January 1961, Guy Green&#x27;s &quot;The Mark&quot; had its London premiere. The role came about when Whitman was frustrated with the sort of roles he was getting. &quot;I had been knocking around and not getting anything to test my ability&quot;, he said. When Richard Burton turned down the role of a child molester in &quot;The Mark&quot; to do &quot;Camelot&quot; on stage, Whitman said that he was asked by his agent to fly to Ireland to act in the film, without his agent telling him what it was about. Whitman didn&#x27;t know the controversial nature of the role until he read the script on location. Impressed and frightful of the content, Whitman had doubts and asked himself if he was in the right business, but came to the conclusion that he could pull it off. Whitman&#x27;s performance earned him rave reviews and an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. He said the film &quot;doubled my rating as an actor&quot;. However, he later said, &quot;I had a tough time breaking my image in that movie... it blocked my image as a gutsy outdoorsman.&quot;

On April 11, 1961, Whitman appeared in &quot;The Fiercest Heart&quot;, which was shot in South Africa and debuted in San Francisco. On July 12, Whitman appeared in Michael Curtiz&#x27;s religious epic &quot;Francis of Assisi&quot;. According to Whitman, while on the set, Curtiz told him that he would like him for a role in his next film, the Western &quot;The Comancheros&quot;, an adaptation of a novel by Paul Wellman. Whitman loved the idea, but was booked by the studio elsewhere. The only way to rectify this was for Whitman to talk with the film&#x27;s star John Wayne, as only Wayne could ask the studio heads to arrange for Whitman to play the part. Whitman went and introduced himself to Wayne and convinced him to do this. On November 1, &quot;The Comancheros&quot; premiered. In it, Whitman played Paul Regret, who flees the law to avoid death but is eventually captured by Texas Ranger Captain Jake Cutter (Wayne).

Around the same time, Jerry Wald cast Whitman in &quot;The Hell Raisers&quot;, about the Boxer Rebellion, but it was never filmed. Whitman also lobbied unsuccessfully to play the lead in &quot;Sanctuary&quot; (1961). Later in 1961, he announced he would form his own production company to make &quot;Mandrake Route&quot; by Frederick Wakeman. He also stated that his bulldozer had &quot;developed into quite a sideline. I&#x27;m sure I still wouldn&#x27;t be in the picture business without it.&quot;

In an interview later that year, Whitman said, &quot;I&#x27;ve had to battle and say what is an actor? It&#x27;s a fellow who plays someone else. But now I realize it&#x27;s the image that makes a star. John Wayne is a great example of a super actor. Gary Cooper is another one. My image? I think it&#x27;s being free and easy and all man. I say to myself I want to become an actor, I want to lose myself in each role. But that&#x27;s not the way to become an actor.&quot;

=== 1962 to 1969: Hollywood leading man ===
On June 15, 1962, Millard Kaufman&#x27;s &quot;Convicts 4&quot; premiered, in which Whitman appeared. On October 11, Whitman appeared in the all-star World War II epic &quot;The Longest Day&quot;. It was directed by several major directors, and opened in Los Angeles on that day. Whitman was cast in the role after being asked to deliver a box of cigars to producer Darryl F. Zanuck at the time of shooting. Zanuck asked him to be part of it and Whitman agreed. Zanuck directed Whitman&#x27;s segments. Also that year, Whitman announced that he might do &quot;Mandrake Root&quot;, &quot;The Victors&quot; (1963), or a film with either Marilyn Monroe or Lewis Milestone.

However, in 1963, instead of choosing any of these roles, Whitman played an American pilot in the French film &quot;The Day and the Hour&quot;, directed by René Clément, shot in Paris and set during World War II. As described by Whitman, he got the part through Alain Delon, who he bumped into in an elevator at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Delon invited him to meet the director, and eventually worked out a way to loan him out from his studio contract. During the production of the film, Whitman disagreed with Clément on the direction of a torture scene and swore to Clément that he himself could handle it. After coincidentally sitting on a plane next to Sidney Buchman, who co-wrote &quot;The Mark,&quot; they re-wrote the scene together. Whitman directed the scene but did not direct again. He described Clément as one of the finest French directors. He enjoyed the experience, saying, &quot;I busted through at last and can now get an honest emotion, project it and make it real. You become egocentric when you involve yourself to such an extent in your role; your next problem is in learning how to turn it off and come home and live with society. It took a lot of time and energy to break through, so I could honestly feel and I&#x27;m reluctant to turn it off. Now I know why so many actors go to psychiatrists.&quot;

Also that year, Whitman acted in the second episode of the first season of &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot;, called &quot;Killing at Sundial&quot;. In it, Whitman plays a Native American who became wealthy throughout life and is now seeking to avenge the death of his father, who was lynched years prior. Also at that time, Whitman was announced as the lead in &quot;Cardinal&quot; (1963), and he lobbied to play Jimmy Hoffa in an adaptation of &quot;The Enemy Within&quot; by Robert F. Kennedy; however, the first role was lost to Tom Tryon and the second film was never made. He then adjusted his contract with Fox to stipulate one film a year for five years. After several months off, Whitman announced plans to produce his own film, &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot;, based on a novel about the Collyer brothers. However, he moved on to do other projects.

On February 19, 1964, Whitman acted in &quot;Shock Treatment&quot;, which opened in Los Angeles. On November 12, Gordon Douglas&#x27; Western &quot;Rio Conchos&quot; opened, with Whitman cast as one of its three leads. The other two were Richard Boone and Anthony Franciosa. Whitman said that he didn&#x27;t like the script, but producer Darryl F. Zanuck told him that if he would do it, he would then be cast as a lead in Ken Annakin&#x27;s upcoming film, &quot;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines&quot; (1965), in a role the studio had initially intended to give Dick Van Dyke. Whitman went on to have a meeting with actor Boone and director Douglas. He thought highly of them and accepted. Annakin had to accept the studio&#x27;s wishes, and despite Whitman not being his first choice, Annakin was very happy with Whitman&#x27;s performance.

On February 10, 1965, George Englund&#x27;s &quot;Signpost to Murder&quot; premiered, which starred Whitman. On May 3, Whitman was confirmed as the main actor for Cy Endfield&#x27;s &quot;Sands of the Kalahari&quot;. Whitman became the lead after the production company courted many actors such as Richard Burton, Robert Mitchum, Albert Finney, Marlon Brando and Warren Beatty. Eventually, George Peppard was cast as the lead but abandoned it early into the production, and while Alan Bates was considered, Whitman was confirmed. Whitman said that he won the role after reading in &quot;Variety&quot; about the departure of Peppard; he went to the Beverly Hills Hotel and bumped into the producer, to whom he jokingly suggested himself for the role. The producers called him that same evening to fly to Africa to star in it. Whitman found the shoot difficult, due to the hot weather and the fact that the baboons, with whom he had fight scenes, were not properly trained and lived in decrepit conditions, as well as having no animal control. The film premiered on November 10.

June 16, 1965, saw the release of Annakin&#x27;s &quot;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines&quot;. In this British period comedy film, Whitman is featured amongst an international ensemble cast, including Sarah Miles, Robert Morley, Terry-Thomas, James Fox, Red Skelton, Benny Hill, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Gert Fröbe and Alberto Sordi. The film, revolving around the craze of early aviation circa 1910, is about a pompous newspaper magnate (Morley) who is convinced by his daughter (Miles) and fiancée (Fox), a young army officer, to organize an air race from London to Paris. A large sum of money is offered to the winner and it hence attracts a variety of characters who participate. Whitman appears as the American entrant, one of its top participants. The film received positive reviews, in which they said the film was funny, colorful, clever and captured the early enthusiasm for aviation. It was treated as a major production, one of only three full-length 70 mm Todd-AO Fox releases in 1965, with an intermission and musical interlude being part of the original screenings. Because of the Todd-AO process, the film was an exclusive roadshow feature initially shown in deluxe Cinerama venues, where customers needed reserved seats purchased ahead of time. The film grossed $31.1 million theatrically and made $29.9 million in home video sales. Audiences, both then and now, have been nearly unanimous in assessing the film as one of the &quot;classic&quot; aviation films.

In 1966, Whitman appeared in Robert Gist&#x27;s &quot;An American Dream&quot;, based on a novel by Norman Mailer. Around this time, Whitman returned to &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot; in the episode &quot;The Highest Fall of All&quot;, in which he played a suicidal stuntman who is willing to do an extremely dangerous fall for a director.

Whitman had turned down a number of offers to star on television series over the years, including &quot;Mannix&quot; and &quot;Judd for the Defense&quot;. &quot;I wanted more diversity in acting,&quot; he said. &quot;I felt I would limit myself.&quot; However, on September 7, 1967, the TV show &quot;Cimarron Strip&quot; premiered, starring Whitman. &quot;A lot of big people told me I was the number one man the networks wanted,&quot; said Whitman. The show was expensive, costing $350,000–$400,000 per episode with each having a broadcast time of 90 minutes, and was the most expensive drama series made up to that time. The series was produced by Whitman&#x27;s own company. &quot;I always wanted to play a cop with a heart, a guy who would use every possible means not to kill a man,&quot; he said. &quot;TV has needed a superhero... and I think Crown can be the guy.&quot; While Whitman received good reviews for his performance, many criticized the show for having thin plots, and it was met with disappointing ratings. Its time slot had major competition: &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; came out on top, and while &quot;The Flying Nun&quot; remained, &quot;Batman&quot; was pushed to another time slot and &quot;Cimarron Strip&quot; was cancelled.

In 1969, Whitman acted in &quot;Sweet Hunters&quot;. According to John Gregory Dunne&#x27;s book &quot;The Studio&quot; (1969), Whitman was suggested for the title role in &quot;The Boston Strangler&quot; (1968) by John Bottomly, the Massachusetts assistant attorney general who prosecuted Albert DeSalvo. Instead, the role went to Tony Curtis.

=== 1970 to 1987: Subsequent projects ===

In 1967, Whitman admitted, &quot;I&#x27;m the type who must work constantly.&quot; In the early 1970s, he worked increasingly in Europe. &quot;I left Hollywood because it was getting to be a mad mess!&quot; he said. &quot;There are only about two really good scripts going around and they always go to the industry&#x27;s two top stars. I thought that in Europe, something better might come my way—and it did! I&#x27;ve made mistakes in the past, but I kept bouncing back. I always thought that an actor is destined to act, but I now realize that if you do one role well, you get stuck with it!&quot;

On September 25, 1970, Whitman was seen in the &quot;Bracken&#x27;s World&quot; episode &quot;Murder Off-Camera&quot;. Also that year, Whitman appeared in the films &quot;The Last Escape&quot; and &quot;The Invincible Six&quot;. He was also in an episode of &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;, and appeared in several more.

In July, Whitman acted in William F. Claxton&#x27;s newly released horror film &quot;Night of the Lepus.&quot; In it, Whitman and Janet Leigh play a couple of zoologists who are looking for ways to reduce the rabbit population that has infested a nearby ranch. They test a serum on some rabbit specimens that would cause them birth defects, and hence reduce the population. One of them escapes, and soon after the area is infested and under attack by giant rabbits. The production was troubled and the film was critically lambasted upon release. Whitman said that he ended up with the role because at the time he was working with Lee Remick on a film called &quot;The Candy Man&quot;, which was cancelled. When he requested his salary and was turned down, he was told he would be compensated only if he took the lead in &quot;Night of the Lepus&quot;, the screenplay of which he found to be ridiculous right from the start. He went on to say that the film damaged his reputation and wasn&#x27;t bankable. Despite its poor reputation, the film developed a cult status, but was retrospectively described by critics as ridiculous and unintentionally funny.

October 18 was the premiere of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Run, Cougar, Run&quot;, directed by Jerome Courtland and starring Whitman. On December 2, Whitman appeared in the &quot;Carnival/The Vaudevillians&quot; episode of &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;.

As an actor, you&#x27;ve got to keep working. You&#x27;ve got to do something to feed the family, put the kids through school.&quot;

== Personal life ==
===Family and relationships===
Whitman&#x27;s first marriage was to Patricia LaLonde (October 13, 1952 – 1966). They had four children—Tony (born 1953), Michael (born 1954), Linda (born 1956), and Scott (born 1958)—before getting divorced.

Stuart remarried in 1966, to French-born Caroline Boubis. They had one son together, Justin, before divorcing in 1974. In 2006, he wed Julia Paradiz, a Russian woman he met at a friend&#x27;s wedding in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1971.

===Friendships===
In an interview, Whitman said that he and Broderick Crawford clicked upon meeting on the set of &quot;Highway Patrol&quot;. Whenever Whitman was low on cash, he would tell Crawford, who continued to re-invite him. Both would hang-out outside of the workplace. Later, Whitman helped Crawford to be cast in &quot;The Decks Ran Red&quot;.

Another &quot;The Decks Ran Red&quot; co-star Whitman commented on was Dorothy Dandridge, who was going through a divorce and had to institutionalize her mentally ill daughter. Whitman was impressed with her strength and described her as a goddess.

Whitman said that when he first met Peter Falk on the set of &quot;Murder, Inc.&quot;, they had their differences but eventually became friends. Whitman found &quot;The Mark&quot; director Guy Green difficult to work with, finding him demanding and too strict, but they became good friends afterwards. On the set of &quot;Sands of the Kalahari&quot;, Whitman said he became best friends with fellow cast members Stanley Baker and Theodore Bikel. While he didn&#x27;t click with Jim Brown at first, they too became friends.

In the same piece, Whitman said that Terry-Thomas was one of his best friends. After their collaboration on &quot;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines&quot;, both would meet for drinks, visit one another, and swim in the ocean while on Whitman&#x27;s beachfront home in Malibu.

== Death ==
Whitman died on March 16, 2020, from skin cancer at his Montecito, California home.
Survivors included his wife, Julia; four children from his first marriage, Linda Whitman van Hook and Anthony, Michael and Scott Whitman; a son from his second marriage, Justin Whitman; a brother, actor Kipp Whitman; seven grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.

<text>The Mark is a 1961 British film about a convicted child molester, now out of prison, who is suspected in the sexual assault of another child. The film stars Stuart Whitman, Maria Schell, Rod Steiger and Brenda De Banzie.

Adapted by Sidney Buchman and Stanley Mann from the novel by Charles E. Israel, the film was directed by Guy Green.

&quot;The Mark&quot; was selected to compete for a Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival and Whitman was nominated for the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role.

==Plot==
Jim Fuller is released from prison after serving time for intent to commit child molestation. He attempts to return to society while dealing with his psychological demons with the help of psychiatrist Dr. McNally.

After finding employment, Jim begins a romantic relationship with Ruth Leighton, the company&#x27;s secretary, and he appears to be on the way to a better life. However, when a child is reported as a possible abuse victim, Jim is picked up for questioning by the police. He has a genuine alibi, and is eventually cleared, but a tabloid reporter exposes Jim&#x27;s previous conviction, and he becomes a pariah in his new community.

==Cast==
* Stuart Whitman as Jim Fuller
* Rod Steiger as Dr. Edmund McNally
* Maria Schell as Ruth Leighton
* Brenda de Banzie as Gertrude Cartwright
* Donald Houston as Austin
* Donald Wolfit as Andrew Clive 
* Paul Rogers as Roy Milne
* Maurice Denham as Arnold Cartwright

==Production==
&quot;The Mark&quot; was filmed in black and white and Cinemascope. It was shot in Ireland.

Each of the three main characters was played by an actor not originally slated for the role. Stuart Whitman was a last-minute replacement for Richard Burton; Maria Schell took over for Jean Simmons, who was supposed to have played Ruth; and the role of the prison psychiatrist was intended for Trevor Howard before Rod Steiger was cast.

According to an interview given by Steiger many years later, he had visited an analyst himself in the 1950s and observed how he conducted himself. He played McNally as an Irishman to avoid stereotyping and added touches to impart more humanity to the character. Steiger claimed that the portrayal was so well received by psychiatric professionals that he was invited to speak at a convention by a psychiatric society.

==Reception==
&quot;The Mark&quot; premiered in London on 26 January 1961 at 20th Century Fox&#x27;s Carlton Theatre, Haymarket, London and opened in New York in October.

Its subject matter made it controversial, and it was criticised for making a pedophile too sympathetic. It also received favourable reviews for its treatment of a difficult subject and praise for the acting, writing and directing. Green said the film was highly regarded in Hollywood, as was his previous film, &quot;The Angry Silence&quot;, and led to Hollywood offers such as &quot;Light in the Piazza&quot;.

<doc id="161522" wikidata="Q78527" url="?curid=161522" title="Erich Kleiber">
<text>Erich Kleiber (5 August 1890 – 27 January 1956) was an Austrian, later Argentine, conductor, known for his interpretations of the classics and as an advocate of Neue Musik.

Kleiber was born in Vienna, and after studying at the Prague Conservatory, he followed the traditional route for an aspiring conductor in German-speaking countries of the time, starting as a répétiteur in an opera house and moving into conducting in increasingly senior positions. After holding posts in Darmstadt (1912), Barmen-Elberfeld (1919), Düsseldorf (1921) and Mannheim (1922) he was appointed in 1923 to the important post of musical director of the Berlin State Opera.

In Berlin, Kleiber&#x27;s scrupulous musicianship and enterprising programming won him a high reputation, but after the Nazi Party came to power in Germany in 1933, he resigned in protest against its oppressive policies, and left the country, basing himself and his family in Buenos Aires. For the rest of his career he was a freelance, guest conducting internationally in opera houses and concert halls. He played an important part in the creation of The Royal Opera in London, but a plan for him to return to the Berlin State Opera in the 1950s fell foul of politics.

Kleiber was regarded as an outstanding conductor of Mozart, Beethoven and Richard Strauss and encouraged modern composers, including Alban Berg, whose &quot;Wozzeck&quot; he premiered. He died suddenly in Zürich at the age of 65.

==Life and career==
=== Early years ===
Kleiber was born in Wieden, Vienna, on 5 August 1890, the second of the two children of Dr Franz Otto Kleiber, a teacher, and his wife Vroni, &quot;née&quot; Schöppl. Kleiber&#x27;s father died in 1895 and his mother died the following year. Kleiber and his sister went to live with his maternal grandparents in Prague. In 1900, after the death of his grandfather, Kleiber returned to Vienna to live with an aunt and study at a Gymnasium. He was able to attend performances at the Musikverein, the Volksoper and Hofoper where Gustav Mahler was the musical director. With his friend Hans Gál, Kleiber heard a performance of Mahler&#x27;s Sixth Symphony, conducted by the composer; at the end, Kleiber told Gál that he intended to be a conductor. Gál pointed out that the traditional route to becoming a conductor was to start as a Korrepetitor (répétiteur) in one of the many opera houses in German-speaking countries, but Kleiber had never been taught to play the piano.

In July 1908 Kleiber left Vienna and studied art, philosophy, and art history at the Charles University in Prague. On the strength of some compositions of his which he submitted to the Prague Conservatory he was admitted, with the proviso that unless he could reach the required standard within the year he would have to leave. He bought a piano and taught himself to play it, took organ lessons, and mastered the curriculum well enough to pass the conservatory&#x27;s examinations. He was taken on as a coach at the New German Theatre in 1911, and began to get work as an accompanist, working in 1912 with Alfred Piccaver. The intendant of the Darmstadt Court Theatre spotted Kleiber&#x27;s potential and invited him to conduct there. He worked at Darmstadt for seven years. Further appointments followed at Barmen-Elberfeld in 1919, Düsseldorf in 1921 and Mannheim in 1922.

=== Berlin ===
In 1923 Leo Blech resigned as musical director of the Berlin State Opera after 17 years in charge. Bruno Walter and Otto Klemperer had been approached to succeed him, but the approaches were inconclusive. Kleiber, invited to conduct a single performance of &quot;Fidelio&quot; in August 1923, made a highly favourable impression, and three days later he was appointed to succeed Blech with a five-year contract.

&quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; describes Kleiber&#x27;s Berlin years as &quot;exceptionally productive&quot;:
In 1926, Kleiber married an American, Ruth Goodrich (1900–1967). They had two children, Veronica (1928–2017), later assistant to Claudio Abbado, and a son Karl, later known as Carlos, (1930–2004), who became a celebrated conductor.

During his Berlin years Kleiber began an international career, conducting concerts in Buenos Aires (1926, 1927) and Moscow (1927); in New York he worked for six or seven weeks in the 1930–31 and 1931–32 seasons, giving between 20 and 30 concerts.

Kleiber&#x27;s time in Berlin came to end in 1934, the year after the NSDAP (Nazi Party) came to power in Germany. Kleiber, who was not Jewish, politically active, or otherwise &quot;persona non grata&quot; with the Nazis, could have continued his career under their régime, but he would not accept their racial policies or their stifling of artistic freedom. When Berg&#x27;s new opera &quot;Lulu&quot; was banned as &quot;Entartete Musik&quot; (degenerate music) Kleiber resigned from his post at the State Opera. He was outraged when Berg – a close friend – assumed that he had joined or would join the Nazi Party to safeguard his career. He wrote to Berg, &quot;I was never a member of the NSDAP – and never had any intention of becoming one!!! Despite several requests!&quot;

Prevented from performing &quot;Lulu&quot;, Kleiber made a gesture of defiance to the régime by putting the world premiere of the suite from the opera in the programme of the last concert he gave in Nazi Germany. The event attracted international attention. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported

Kleiber conducted the final opera performances to which he was contractually committed and then left Germany with his wife and children in January 1935.

=== Emigré ===
Kleiber&#x27;s biographer John Russell entitles his chapter covering the years 1935 to 1939 &quot;Vagabondage&quot;. Kleiber made his British début with the London Symphony Orchestra in 1935, and was a frequent visitor to Amsterdam, Brussels and other European cities. In 1938, at the invitation of Sir Thomas Beecham, he appeared for the first time at Covent Garden, conducting &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; with a starry cast headed by Lotte Lehmann. He repudiated his contract with La Scala, Milan in April 1939, shortly after Mussolini&#x27;s fascist régime enacted its own anti-semitic legislation. Kleiber said:
Insofar as Kleiber had a base during these years it was in Buenos Aires; he became an Argentine citizen in 1936. He took charge of the German opera seasons at the Teatro Colón between 1937 and 1949, and conducted in Chile, Uruguay, Mexico and Cuba.

At the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, Kleiber conducted 29 different operas (a total of 181 performances) during 10 seasons (1937–41, 1943, and 1946–49). The operas he conducted the most were Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg and Der Rosenkavalier. The performances he conducted featured some of the world&#x27;s top singers of German opera at the time, including for example Kirsten Flagstad, Astrid Varnay, Rose Bampton, Max Lorenz, Set Svanholm, René Maison, Hans Hotter and Alexander Kipnis. Kleiber conducted the Western Hemisphere&#x27;s premiere of Die Frau ohne Schatten in Buenos Aires in 1949. 

===Post-war===
After the Second World War, Kleiber resumed his European activities, first with the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1948, and at Covent Garden from 1950 to 1953. The post-war Covent Garden was very different from the star-studded international pre-war seasons. The new company, built from scratch with largely British singers, was not then of international calibre or even approaching it. Kleiber&#x27;s contribution was of crucial importance to the development of the company. The record producer John Culshaw wrote:
The Covent Garden management hoped Kleiber would become the company&#x27;s musical director, but he was not willing to commit himself. There were many competing demands for his services in Europe. At the 1951 Maggio Musicale in Florence, he conducted a celebrated production of &quot;Les vêpres siciliennes&quot;, starring Maria Callas, and the world premiere of Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; (also with Callas), written 160 years earlier. There were plans for his appointment to the Vienna Staatsoper, but they fell through, and his only operatic engagement in his native city was &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; in 1951. In 1953 he conducted the complete &quot;Ring&quot; cycle in Rome; it was broadcast, but the recordings are thought to be lost. Between 1948 and 1955 he recorded a range of works for the Decca record company.

Almost at the end of Kleiber&#x27;s career there was a debacle after he accepted an invitation to resume his pre-war post at the Berlin Staatsoper. Following the post-war division of the city, the house was in East Berlin. The old building had been bombed and was slowly being restored. In 1951 the East German authorities invited Kleiber to become musical director when the rebuilding was complete. At the time, hostility between the Soviet bloc and the western allies was intense, and some ardent democrats thought Kleiber wrong to work for the totalitarian East German régime. The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra withdrew his invitation to conduct at its concerts, but he felt he was building bridges between east and west. The reopening was scheduled for 1955, but as the time approached, Kleiber became increasingly aware of state interference in the running of the house. Matters came to a head when the authorities removed an old monument to Frederick the Great that was a key feature of the building. Kleiber wrote, &quot;I have had to acknowledge that the spirit of the old theatre cannot reign in the new building&quot;, and he resigned before the re-opening. Feeling that the West Germans had been mean-minded in their attempt to stop him conducting in East Berlin, he left the city and never returned.

In Russell&#x27;s view the collapse of Kleiber&#x27;s hopes for the Staatsoper was a blow from which he did not recover. He died suddenly in Zürich on 27 January 1956, aged 65.

==Reputation, honours and legacy ==
In the view of &quot;Grove&quot;, Kleiber was:
Among the honours awarded to Kleiber were Commandeur Ordre de Léopold, Belgium; Commendatore della Corona d’ Italia; Orden el Sol de Peru; and Comendador del Merito, Chile.

Kleiber was a composer; among his works are a Violin Concerto, Piano Concerto, orchestral variations, Capriccio for Orchestra, numerous chamber music works, piano pieces, and songs.

===Recordings===

&quot;Grove&quot; comments that Kleiber&#x27;s recordings of &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; and Beethoven&#x27;s symphonies &quot;all demonstrate his extraordinary rhythmic control and dynamic flexibility&quot;. For more information on his &quot;Figaro&quot; recording, see &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; (Kleiber recording). His recordings include the following, many of which have been reissued in digital transfers:

<text>Robert Franklin Stroud (January 28, 1890 – November 21, 1963), known as the &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot;, was a convicted murderer, American federal prisoner, and author who has been cited as one of the most notorious criminals in the United States. During his time at Leavenworth Penitentiary, he reared and sold birds and became a respected ornithologist. From 1942 to 1959, he was incarcerated at Alcatraz, where regulations did not allow him to keep birds. Stroud was never released from the federal prison system; he was imprisoned from 1909 to his death in 1963.

Born in Seattle, Washington, Stroud ran away from his abusive father at the age of 13. By the time he was 18, he had become a pimp in the Alaska Territory. In January 1909, he shot and killed a bartender who attacked his mistress, a crime for which he was sentenced to 12 years in the federal penitentiary on McNeil Island in Puget Sound. Stroud gained a reputation as a dangerous inmate who frequently had confrontations with fellow inmates and staff. In 1916, he stabbed and killed a guard. Stroud was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death by hanging, but after several trials, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in solitary confinement.

In 1920, while in solitary confinement at the federal penitentiary of Leavenworth, Stroud discovered a nest with three injured sparrows in the prison yard. He cared for them and within a few years had acquired a collection of about 300 canaries. He began extensive research into birds after being granted equipment by a prison-reforming warden. Stroud wrote &quot;Diseases of Canaries&quot;, which was smuggled out of Leavenworth and published in 1933, as well as a later edition (1943). He made important contributions to avian pathology, most notably a cure for the hemorrhagic septicemia family of diseases, gaining much respect and some level of sympathy among ornithologists and farmers. Stroud ran a successful business from inside the prison, but his activities infuriated the prison staff. He was transferred to Alcatraz in 1942 after it was discovered that he had been secretly making alcohol by using some of the equipment in his cell.

Stroud began serving a 17-year term at Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary on December 19, 1942, and became inmate No. 594. In 1943, he was assessed by psychiatrist Romney M. Ritchey, who diagnosed him as a psychopath, with an I.Q. of 112. Stripped of his birds and equipment, he wrote a history of the penal system.

In what came to be called The Battle of Alcatraz in May 1946, Stroud made efforts to protect other inmates. Then fifty-six years old, Stroud climbed over the third tier railing and lowered himself to the second tier, then dropped onto the floor of D Block. He started closing the front solid steel doors of the six isolation cells to protect the helpless men. Stroud yelled to the Warden, explaining that there were no firearms in D Block and that those involved in violence had retreated to another section of the prison. He made it clear that many innocent men would die if the guards continued to fire into D Block.

In 1959, Stroud was transferred to the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri, where he remained until his death on November 21, 1963.

==Early life and arrest==
Stroud was born in Seattle, the eldest child of Elizabeth Jane (née McCartney, 1860–1938) and Benjamin Franklin Stroud. His mother had two daughters from a previous marriage. His father was an abusive alcoholic, and Stroud ran away from home at the age of 13.

At 18, in Cordova, Alaska, Stroud met 36-year-old Kitty O&#x27;Brien, a prostitute and dance-hall entertainer, for whom he pimped in Juneau. On January 18, 1909, barman F. K. &quot;Charlie&quot; von Dahmer allegedly failed to pay O&#x27;Brien for her services and beat her. Stroud confronted von Dahmer, and after a struggle shot him to death. Stroud surrendered himself. According to police reports, he knocked von Dahmer unconscious and then shot him.

As Alaska was then a United States territory, Stroud was prosecuted in the federal courts, where he was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 12 years in the federal penitentiary at McNeil Island, Washington.

==Prison life==
Stroud was one of the most violent prisoners at McNeil Island, frequently feuding with staff and other inmates, and was prone to illness. He reportedly stabbed a fellow prisoner who reported him for stealing food, assaulted a hospital orderly who had reported him to prison administration for attempting to obtain morphine through threats, and reportedly stabbed an inmate.

In 1912, Stroud was sentenced to an additional six months for the attacks and transferred from McNeil Island to the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas. On March 26, 1916, he stabbed Andrew Turner, a guard at the prison, through the heart after he reprimanded him for a minor rule violation that would have prevented a visit from Stroud&#x27;s younger brother.
In 1918, after three trials, Stroud was sentenced to be hanged.

Stroud&#x27;s mother appealed to President Woodrow Wilson, who commuted his sentence to life imprisonment. Leavenworth&#x27;s warden, T. W. Morgan, strongly opposed the decision, given Stroud&#x27;s reputation for violence. Morgan persuaded the President to stipulate that since Stroud was originally sentenced to await his death sentence in solitary confinement, those conditions should prevail until the halted execution could be carried out. President Wilson&#x27;s Attorney General, Alexander Mitchell Palmer, saw to it that Stroud would spend the rest of his life in solitary confinement.

==Leavenworth==

While at Leavenworth in 1920, Stroud found a nest with three injured sparrows in the prison yard, and raised them to adulthood. Prisoners were sometimes allowed to buy canaries, and Stroud had started to add to his collection. He occupied his time raising and caring for his birds, which he could sell for supplies and to help support his mother. According to Stroud, he used a &quot;razor blade and nail for tools&quot; and made his first bird cage out of wooden crates.

Soon thereafter, Leavenworth&#x27;s administration changed, and William Biddle took over as warden. Impressed with the possibility of presenting Leavenworth as a progressive rehabilitation penitentiary, Biddle furnished Stroud with cages, chemicals, and stationery to conduct his ornithological activities. Visitors were shown Stroud&#x27;s aviary, and many purchased his canaries.

Over the years, he raised nearly 300 canaries in his cells. He also wrote two books, the 60,000-word treatise &quot;Diseases of Canaries&quot; (1933), which was smuggled out of Leavenworth, and a later edition, &quot;Stroud&#x27;s Digest on the Diseases of Birds&quot; (1943), with updated, specific information. He made several important contributions to avian pathology, most notably a cure for the hemorrhagic septicemia family of diseases. He gained respect and also some level of sympathy in the bird-loving field.

Stroud&#x27;s activities created problems for the prison management. According to regulations, each letter sent or received at the prison had to be read, copied, and approved. Stroud was so involved in his business that this alone required a full-time prison secretary. Additionally, most of the time, his birds were permitted to fly freely within his cells, and because of the great number of birds he kept, his cell was filthy. 

In 1931, an attempt to force Stroud to discontinue his business and get rid of his birds failed after Stroud and one of his mail correspondents, a bird researcher from Indiana named Della Mae Jones, made his story known to newspapers and magazines. A massive letter campaign and a 50,000-signature petition sent to President Herbert Hoover resulted in Stroud being permitted to keep his birds. Despite prison overcrowding, he was even given a second cell to house them. However, his letter-writing privileges were greatly curtailed. Jones and Stroud grew so close that she moved to Kansas in 1931 and started a business with him, selling his avian medicines.

Prison officials, fed up with Stroud&#x27;s activities and their attendant publicity, intensified their efforts to transfer him from Leavenworth. Stroud discovered a Kansas law that forbade the transfer of prisoners married in Kansas. To this end, he married Jones by proxy, which infuriated the prison&#x27;s administrators, who would not allow him to correspond with his wife.

Prison officials were not the only ones perturbed with Stroud&#x27;s marriage; his mother was also incensed. They had a close relationship, but Elizabeth Stroud strongly disapproved of the marriage to Jones, believing women were nothing but trouble for her son. Whereas previously she had been a strong advocate for her son, helping him with legal battles, she now argued against his application for parole and became a major obstacle in his attempts to be released from the prison system. After moving away from Leavenworth she had no further contact with him. She died in 1938.

In 1933, Stroud advertised in a publication that he had not received any royalties from the sales of &quot;Diseases of Canaries&quot;. In retaliation, the publisher complained to the warden and, as a result, proceedings were initiated to transfer Stroud to Alcatraz, where he would not be permitted to keep his birds. In the end, Stroud was able to keep both his birds and canary-selling business at Leavenworth.

Stroud mostly avoided trouble for several more years, until it came to light that some of the equipment Stroud had requested for his lab was in fact being used as a home-made distillery to manufacture alcohol. Officials finally had the wedge they needed to drive Stroud out. Citing his &quot;dangerous tendencies&quot; and longstanding concerns about the sanitary conditions of his cell, they initiated proceedings to send him to Alcatraz.

==Alcatraz==

On December 16, 1942, Stroud was transferred to Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary and became inmate No. 594. He reportedly was not informed in advance that he was to leave Leavenworth and his beloved birds, and was given just 10 minutes&#x27; notice of his departure. His birds and equipment were sent to his brother as Alcatraz&#x27;s strict policies meant that he was unable to continue his avocation. He spent six years in segregation and another 11 confined to the hospital wing at the penitentiary.

In 1943, he was assessed by psychiatrist Romney M. Ritchey, who diagnosed him as a psychopath, with an I.Q. of 112 (his initial report in 1942 based on Leavenworth states that he had an I.Q. of 116). While there, he wrote two manuscripts: &quot;Bobbie&quot;, an autobiography, and &quot;Looking Outward: A History of the U.S. Prison System from Colonial Times to the Formation of the Bureau of Prisons&quot;. A judge ruled that Stroud had the right to write and keep such manuscripts, but upheld the warden&#x27;s decision to ban their publication. After Stroud&#x27;s death, the transcripts were delivered to his lawyer, Richard English.

Rumors of Stroud&#x27;s homosexuality were noted at Alcatraz. According to Donald Hurley, whose father was a guard at Alcatraz, &quot;Whenever Stroud was around anyone, which was seldom, he was watched very closely, as prison officials were very aware of his overt homosexual tendencies.&quot; In an interview with Hurley for his book, a former inmate heard Stroud was always in &#x27;dog block&#x27; (solitary confinement) or later in the hospital because he was a &#x27;wolf&#x27; (aggressive homosexual) who had a bad temper.&quot;

In February 1963 Stroud met and talked with actor Burt Lancaster, who portrayed him in &quot;The Birdman of Alcatraz&quot;. Stroud never got to see the film or read the book it was based on but did share one of the problems that prevented parole, that he was an &quot;admitted homosexual.&quot; Lancaster quoted Stroud as saying, &quot;Let&#x27;s face it, I am 73 years old. Does that answer your question about whether I would be a dangerous homosexual?&quot;

During his 17-year term at Alcatraz, Stroud was allowed access to the prison library and began studying law. Occasionally, he was permitted to play chess with one of the guards. Stroud began petitioning the government that his long prison term amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. In 1959, with his health failing, Stroud was transferred to the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri, but he was never released.

==Death==
On November 21, 1963, Robert Stroud died at the Springfield Medical Center at the age of 73, having been incarcerated for the last 54 years of his life, of which 42 were spent in solitary confinement. He was interred in the old Masonic Cemetery near Metropolis, Illinois, after a private funeral ceremony at Aikins-Farmer Funeral Home on November 25.

==Legacy==

Stroud is considered to be one of the most notorious criminals in American history. Robert Niemi states that Stroud had a &quot;superior intellect,&quot; and became a &quot;first-rate ornithologist and author,&quot; but was an &quot;extremely dangerous and menacing psychopath, disliked and distrusted by his jailers and fellow inmates.&quot; 
However, by his last years, Stroud&#x27;s behavior had markedly improved and he was viewed more favorably; Judge Becker considered Stroud to be modest, no longer a danger to society, and as having a genuine love for birds. Given his level of notoriety, the crimes he committed were unremarkable, especially as the assaults he committed had a clear cause. Carl Sifakais considers Stroud to have been a &quot;brilliant self-taught expert on birds, and possibly the best-known example of self-improvement and rehabilitation in the U.S. prison system.&quot;

Because of Stroud&#x27;s contributions to the field of ornithology, he gained a large following of thousands of bird breeders and poultry raisers who demanded his release, and for many years a &quot;Committee to Release Robert F. Stroud&quot; campaigned to have Stroud released from prison. However, because Stroud had killed a federal officer, his punishment in solitary confinement remained intact. In 1963, Richard M. English, a young lawyer who had campaigned for John F. Kennedy in California, took to the cause of securing Stroud&#x27;s release. He met with former President Harry S. Truman to enlist support, but Truman declined. He also met with senior Kennedy administration officials who were studying the subject.

English took the last photo of Stroud, in which he is shown with a green visor. The warden of the prison attempted to have English prosecuted for bringing something into the prison he did not take out: unexposed film. The authorities declined to take any action. Upon Stroud&#x27;s death, his personal property, including original manuscripts, was delivered to English, as his last legal representative, who later turned over some of the possessions to the Audubon Society.

Stroud became the subject of a 1955 book by Thomas E. Gaddis, &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot;. Gaddis, who strongly advocated rehabilitation in the prisons, portrayed Stroud in favorable light. This was adapted by Guy Trosper for the 1962 film of the same name, directed by John Frankenheimer. It starred Burt Lancaster as Stroud, Karl Malden as a fictionalized and renamed warden, Thelma Ritter as Stroud&#x27;s mother and Betty Field as his wife, renamed Stella Johnson in the film. However, former inmates of Alcatraz say that the real Stroud was far more sinister, dangerous and unpleasant than the fictionalized version portrayed in the book and film. One said &quot;he was a vicious killer. I think Burt Lancaster owes us all an apology.&quot;

Art Carney played Stroud in the 1980 TV movie &quot;&quot;, and Dennis Farina played Stroud in the 1987 TV movie &quot;Six Against the Rock&quot;, a dramatization of the Battle of Alcatraz of 1946.

In music, Stroud has been the subject of the instrumental &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; from &quot;Rick Wakeman&#x27;s Criminal Record&quot; (1977), a concept album about criminality, and the song &quot;The Birdman&quot; by Our Lady Peace is also about him. Several video games such as &quot;Galerians&quot; and &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; pay homage to him. In addition, Bryan Christopher Williams, a well-known rapper, adopted the stage name of Birdman (Birdman (rapper)).

<doc id="161527" wikidata="Q160706" url="?curid=161527" title="Carlos Kleiber">
<text>Carlos Kleiber (3 July 1930 – 13 July 2004) was a German-born Austrian conductor, who is widely regarded as among the greatest conductors of all time.

== Early life ==
Kleiber was born as Karl Ludwig Bonifacius Kleiber in Berlin in 1930, the son of the eminent Austrian conductor Erich Kleiber and American Ruth Goodrich (née Baumgardner, 19001967), from Waterloo, Iowa. In 1935, the Kleiber family emigrated to Buenos Aires and Karl was renamed Carlos. As a youth, he had an English governess and grew up in English boarding schools. He also composed, sang, and played piano and timpani. While his father noticed his son&#x27;s musical talents, he nevertheless dissuaded Carlos from pursuing a musical career: &quot;What a pity the boy is musically talented&quot;, wrote Erich to a friend.

Carlos first studied chemistry at ETH Zurich but soon decided to dedicate himself to music. He was répétiteur at the Gärtnerplatz Theatre in Munich in 1952 and made his conducting debut with the operetta &quot;Gasparone&quot; at Potsdam theatre in 1954. From 1958 to 1964 he was &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein in Düsseldorf and Duisburg, and then at the Opera in Zurich from 1964 to 1966. Between 1966 and 1973 he was first &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; in Stuttgart, his last permanent post. During the following years, he often conducted at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich.

During his time at Düsseldorf his operatic repertoire included Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot;, &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, &quot;I due Foscari&quot; and &quot;Otello&quot;, Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot; and &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, Richard Strauss&#x27; &quot;Daphne&quot; and &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Les Contes d&#x27;Hoffmann&quot; plus several of his operettas, Franz Lehár&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, Engelbert Humperdinck&#x27;s &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; and Ruggero Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Edipo re&quot;. At Zurich he conducted Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot; and Bedřich Smetana&#x27;s &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; for the first time.

== Mature career ==
During his freelance career, Kleiber restricted his conducting appearances to select occasions. He made his British debut in 1966 with a performance at the Edinburgh Festival of Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Wozzeck&quot;, a work whose premiere his father had conducted in 1925. Kleiber&#x27;s repertoire at the Royal Opera House included &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, &quot;Elektra&quot;, &quot;La bohème&quot; and &quot;Otello&quot;. He made his Bayreuth debut in 1974 conducting Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;.

His American debut came in 1978 with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, where he again conducted in 1983, his only US orchestra appearances. His Metropolitan Opera debut was in 1988, conducting &quot;La bohème&quot; with Luciano Pavarotti and Mirella Freni. In 1989, following Herbert von Karajan&#x27;s resignation from the Berlin Philharmonic, Kleiber was offered, but declined, the opportunity to succeed him as music director. He returned to the Met in 1989 to conduct &quot;La traviata&quot;, and in 1990 for &quot;Otello&quot; and &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;.

Kleiber kept out of the public eye and apparently gave one interview in his lifetime, contrary to reports that he never gave any. After he resigned from the Bavarian State Opera, his appearances became less frequent and he made only a few recordings.

Most of these studio recordings are highly regarded; they include Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s fifth and seventh symphonies with the Vienna Philharmonic, Johannes Brahms&#x27;s Symphony No. 4 and Franz Schubert&#x27;s third and eighth (&quot;Unfinished&quot;) symphonies, also with the Vienna Philharmonic, recordings of Dvořák&#x27;s Concerto for piano and orchestra with Sviatoslav Richter, Carl Maria von Weber&#x27;s &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;, Johann Strauss&#x27; &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; and Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot;. His last studio recording was Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; with the Staatskapelle Dresden. Recording sessions began in 1980. Kleiber left before they were completed, but since a musically complete performance had been set down, Deutsche Grammophon released it, much to Kleiber&#x27;s anger.

Kleiber&#x27;s small studio discography has been increased by a number of releases of live recordings, often sourced from broadcast relays. These have included his two Vienna New Year&#x27;s Concerts, performances of Beethoven&#x27;s Fourth and Seventh Symphonies with the Concertgebouw Orchestra and the Sixth with the Bavarian State Orchestra. The Sixth is especially notable as the only occasion on which Kleiber conducted the work; in this instance the source came not from a radio broadcast but a C-90 compact cassette recorded for his son.

==Later years==
Kleiber retired from concert life in the early 1990s, occasionally reappearing for private or benefit concerts. For one such event in Ingolstadt, part of his payment consisted of a new Audi made to his specifications. His performances were painstakingly rehearsed, but often seemed spontaneous and inspired. In the opinion of many of his colleagues and audiences, he was an eccentric genius whom some placed among the greatest conductors of all time despite the paucity of his appearances.

He was buried in the Slovenian village of Konjšica near Litija, where he died in 2004, next to his wife Stanislava Brezovar, a ballet dancer, who had died seven months earlier. They had two children, a son Marko and a daughter Lillian.

== Preserved performances ==
Kleiber&#x27;s unique conducting style is preserved on video in a number of performances: Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 4 and Symphony No. 7 from the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, Johann Strauss&#x27; &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; from Munich, Richard Strauss&#x27; &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; from both Munich and Vienna, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s 36th symphony and Brahms&#x27; second symphony from the Musikverein in Vienna; Beethoven&#x27;s Coriolan Overture, Mozart&#x27;s 33rd and Brahms&#x27; fourth symphonies from Munich and Bizet&#x27;s Carmen again from Vienna. He conducted the New Year&#x27;s Concert of the Vienna Philharmonic in 1989 and 1992, which are both preserved on video.

==Legacy==
===Documentary tributes===
In 2008 Rai Radio 3 (Italian National Radio channel 3), inside its evening program &quot;Radio3 Suite&quot;, broadcast a 10-episode program dedicated to Kleiber&#x27;s legacy: &quot;Il Sorriso della Musica: un Ritratto di Carlos Kleiber&quot; (&quot;The Smile of Music: A Portrait of Carlos Kleiber&quot;), organized and hosted by Andrea Ottonello, with participation by Claudio Abbado, Mirella Freni, Maurizio Pollini, and above all Carlos Kleiber&#x27;s sister, Veronica. In his interview, Abbado termed Kleiber &quot;one of the greatest, if not the greatest, conductors of the 20th century&quot; (&quot;Carlos è stato uno dei più grandi, se non il più grande, direttore del Novecento&quot;).

On 26 September 2009, BBC Radio 3 transmitted a documentary, &quot;Who Was Carlos Kleiber?&quot;. Produced by Paul Frankl and presented by Ivan Hewett with research by Ruth Thomson, this feature was based on interviews with four who knew Kleiber well: tenor and conductor Plácido Domingo, music administrator and intendant Sir Peter Jonas, music journalist and critic Christine Lemke-Matvey and conductor–pianist Charles Barber.

Beginning in July 2014, upon the tenth anniversary of his death, a syndicate of public broadcasters in Canada, Great Britain and the United States aired a two-hour documentary, &quot;Carlos Kleiber: A Conductor Unlike Any Other&quot;, about Kleiber as remembered by his colleagues. Producer Jon Tolansky, who himself played for Kleiber at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, interviewed singers Ileana Cotrubaș, Thomas Hampson, Dame Felicity Lott, the late Dame Margaret Price and Jonathan Summers, members of the Chicago Symphony, Royal Opera House, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras, conductor and Kleiber friend Charles Barber, administrators Sir Peter Jonas and Sir John Tooley, and recording executive Costa Pilavachi. This audio essay incorporated numerous excerpts from Kleiber&#x27;s most important recordings, including Beethoven&#x27;s fifth and seventh symphonies, Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot;, Richard Strauss&#x27; &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, and Weber&#x27;s &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;.

===Honors and posthumous evaluation===

On 21 June 2010, the city of Ljubljana celebrated Carlos Kleiber&#x27;s 80th birthday with a concert by the Vienna Philharmonic directed by Kleiber&#x27;s friend Riccardo Muti. &quot;BBC Music Magazine&quot; announced on 17 March 2011 that Kleiber had been selected as &quot;the greatest conductor of all time.&quot; Some 100 current conductors, including Sir Colin Davis, Gustavo Dudamel, Valery Gergiev and Mariss Jansons, participated in the BBC poll. Kleiber, who conducted just 96 concerts and around 400 operatic performances in his 74 years, was voted ahead of Leonard Bernstein and Claudio Abbado, who took second and third places respectively.

Susanna Mälkki, music director, ensemble intercontemporain, and one of the conductors polled, commented: &quot;Carlos Kleiber brought an incredible energy to music... Yes, he did have about five times as much time to rehearse than conductors do today, but he deserved it because his vision was remarkable, he knew what he wanted, and his attention to detail was truly inspiring.&quot;

Jeremy Pound, Deputy Editor of BBC Music Magazine, added: &quot;Asking 100 of today&#x27;s conducting greats to name their idols and inspirations was a fascinating experience. Not least when so many named Carlos Kleiber, who in the course of his whole lifetime conducted fewer concerts than most of them direct in just a couple of years. Kleiber&#x27;s incredible attention to detail, sheer enthusiasm for music, and astonishingly accomplished level of performance could never be doubted – perhaps &#x27;less is more&#x27; is the real path to true greatness?&quot;

According to Charles Barber, biographer, friend and pen-pal of Kleiber, another factor contributed to his legendary and unusual career. &quot;Uniquely, Carlos Kleiber combined the rigors of German analysis, form and discipline with the expressive vitality of Latin dance, pulse and joy. For nearly twenty years at the formative outset, a conductor baptized Karl gradually became Carlos. He never turned his back on that fascinating cultural biochemistry. It would shape everything he did.&quot;

Kleiber was voted into the Gramophone Hall of Fame in 2012. Clemens Hellsberg (&quot;Gramophone&quot;, May 2012) said:

What was it that propelled Carlos Kleiber to near mystical heights? It was the unforgettable experience of surpassing one&#x27;s own boundaries, yet also the utter helplessness when he stormed off in the last minutes of a final rehearsal. This was not pretension but rather the expression of deepest despair, even though the orchestra had performed at the highest level – or perhaps for that very reason. Extreme contradictions characterised his personality: one constantly feared catastrophe, yet he was always available to musicians for private conversations. He had a vast repertoire, yet restricted himself to a very few works. His outbursts of rage could be directed at anyone, yet his interaction with children was characterised by a precious and fragile tenderness. In art there are no upward limits. Yet each generation needs at least one artist who exemplifies this. Kleiber reached to the stars for us; even when he broke down in his efforts, he still proved that they exist.

<text>Alban Berg&#x27;s Violin Concerto was written in 1935. It is probably Berg&#x27;s best-known and most frequently performed piece. In it, Berg sought to reconcile diatonicism and dodecaphony. The work was commissioned by Louis Krasner, and dedicated by Berg to &quot;the memory of an angel&quot;. It was the last work he completed. Krasner performed the solo part in the premiere at the Palau de la Música Catalana, Barcelona, in April 1936, four months after the composer&#x27;s death.

== Conception and composition ==

The piece stemmed from a commission from the violinist Louis Krasner. When he received the commission, Berg was working on his opera &quot;Lulu&quot;, and did not begin work on the concerto for some months.

An event that spurred him to start the concerto was the death by polio of 18-year-old Manon Gropius, daughter of Walter Gropius and Berg&#x27;s friend and patron Alma Mahler (Gustav Mahler&#x27;s widow). Berg set &quot;Lulu&quot; aside to write the concerto, which he dedicated &quot;To the memory of an angel&quot;; he identified the &quot;angel&quot; to Alma as Manon. Alma felt abandoned by the Bergs in her time of mourning, and Berg was eager to repair the breach. Berg sent Alma some part of the score, possibly the dedicatory page and opening, in 1935. It was her 56th birthday, to which the opening metronome marking (56 to a quarter note) likely referred.

Berg worked on the piece very quickly, completing it in a few months; it is thought that his work on the concerto was largely responsible for his failing to complete &quot;Lulu&quot; before his death on 24 December 1935. The concerto was the last work he completed. In a letter to Krasner dated 16 July 1935, Berg wrote: &quot;Yesterday I finished the composition [without the orchestration] of our Violin Concerto. I am probably more surprised by it than you will be ... the work gave me more and more joy. I hope – no, I have the confident belief – that I have succeeded.&quot;

The manuscript score carries the date 11 August 1935.

== Scoring ==
The concerto is scored for 2 flutes (both doubling as piccolo), 2 oboes (one doubling as a cor anglais), alto saxophone (doubling as 3rd clarinet), 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 2 trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion, harp and strings.

== Music ==

Berg described the structure of the concerto in a letter to Arnold Schoenberg. It is in two movements, each divided into two sections:
&lt;poem&gt;
I.a. Andante (Prelude)
I.b. Allegretto (Scherzo)
II.a. Allegro (Cadenza)
II.b. Adagio (Chorale Variations)
&lt;/poem&gt;
The work begins with an Andante in classical sonata form, followed by the Allegretto, a dance-like section. The second movement starts with an Allegro largely based on a single recurring rhythmic cell; this section has been described as cadenza-like, with very difficult passages in the solo part. The orchestration becomes rather violent at its climax (marked in the score as &quot;High point of the Allegro&quot;); the fourth and final section, marked Adagio, is much calmer. The first two sections are meant to represent life, the last two death and transfiguration.

Like many of Berg&#x27;s works, the piece combines the twelve-tone technique, typical of serialist music learned from his teacher Arnold Schoenberg, with passages written in a freer, more tonal style. The score integrates serialism and tonality in a remarkable fashion. Here is Berg&#x27;s tone row:
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \new Staff \with { \remove &quot;Time_signature_engraver&quot; \remove &quot;Bar_engraver&quot; } \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \override Stem #&#x27;transparent = ##t g4 bes d fis a c e gis b cis ees f } &lt;/score&gt;
Although this contains all twelve notes of the chromatic scale, there is a strong tonal undercurrent: the first three notes of the row make up a G minor triad; notes three to five are a D major triad; notes five to seven are an A minor triad; notes seven to nine are an E major triad;
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; { \new PianoStaff « \new Staff \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \time 2/4 r8 &lt;d bes&gt;4( &lt;d bes&gt;8~ | &lt;d bes&gt; &lt;d a&gt;4 &lt;d a&gt;8~ | &lt;d a&gt;) &lt;c a&gt;4( &lt;c a&gt;8~ | &lt;c a&gt; 4 8) } \new Staff \relative c { \clef bass \time 2/4 g,2( | fis&#x27; | e&#x27; | gis, } » } &lt;/score&gt;
and the last four notes (B, C, E, F) and the first (G) together make up part of a whole tone scale. The roots of the four triads correspond to the open strings of the violin, which is highlighted in the opening passage of the piece.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 g8(\pp d&#x27; a&#x27; e&#x27;) e( a, d, g,~ | g1) } &lt;/score&gt;
The resulting triads are thus fifth-related and form a cadence, which we hear directly before the row is played by the violin for the first time. Moreover, the four chords above contain the note sequence B (B) – A – C – H (B), the BACH motif, thus connecting the piece to Johann Sebastian Bach, whose music plays a crucial role in the piece.

The row&#x27;s last four notes, ascending whole tones, are also the first four notes of the chorale melody &quot;Es ist genug&quot; (&quot;It is enough&quot;). Bach composed a four-part setting of the hymn by Franz Joachim Burmeister with a melody by Johann Rudolph Ahle to conclude his cantata &quot;O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort&quot;, BWV 60 (&quot;O eternity, you thunderous word&quot;). The first four measures are shown below.

&lt;/score&gt;

Berg quotes this chorale in the last movement of the piece, where Bach&#x27;s harmonization is heard in the clarinets.

In 1957, Ernst Krenek identified another quoted tonal passage in the work as a Carinthian folk song. Bryan Simms and Charlotte Erwin described it, &quot;A Vögele af&#x27;n Zweschpm-bam&quot;, as a &quot;yodeling song with a saucy, ribald text&quot;. It appears in the second section of the first movement and returns briefly before the coda in the second movement. This is perhaps the only section that does not derive its materials from the row.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \key g \major \time 3/4 \partial 4*1 « { d4 | b&#x27;8. b16 d4 g8 b | b,4 d g | fis4. e8 e4 | c2. | c&#x27;4. fis,8 d4 | c&#x27; fis, d8 c&#x27; | b2 g8 b | d,2 } \\ { d,4 | g8. g16 b4 d | g, b e | d4. c8 c4 | fis,2. | fis&#x27;4. d8 c4 | fis d c8 fis | g2 d8 d | b2 } » } &lt;/score&gt;

Anthony Pople calls the concerto &quot;less serial than &quot;Lulu&quot;&quot;, containing originally serial material later repeated or developed outside that framework, in addition to small adjustments throughout to avoid bare octaves.

== Premieres ==
* World premiere: 19 April 1936, Palau de la Música Catalana, Barcelona, at the XIV ISCM Festival. Louis Krasner played the solo part, and Pau Casals Orchestra was conducted by Hermann Scherchen.
*: Anton Webern was intended to be the conductor. Reports vary as to whether he was ill or was emotionally unable to cope with the subject matter of the music. In any case, Scherchen happened to be there for the Festival, and he was drafted at the literal 11th hour: the first time he ever saw the score was at 11 pm the night before the premiere, and the next morning there was time for only half an hour rehearsal.
* British private premiere: 1 May 1936, London, at an invitation-only concert. Krasner was again the soloist (at the invitation of the BBC producer Edward Clark, who had attended the world premiere in Barcelona), and Webern conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra. This performance was recorded on acetate discs, which survived in Krasner&#x27;s collection. The performance was broadcast on the BBC on Berg&#x27;s centenary, 9 February 1985 and later released on CD.
* Austrian and European premiere: 25 October 1936, Vienna, Krasner with the Vienna Philharmonic under Otto Klemperer. The violinist Arnold Rosé came out of retirement to lead the string section. This performance was also recorded.
* British public premiere: 9 December 1936, London, at the Queen&#x27;s Hall in a BBC concert. Krasner was again the soloist, and Sir Henry Wood conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra.

=== Revised version ===
Berg did not have time to review the score or correct any errors. That was finally done in the 1990s by Professor Douglas Jarman, Principal Lecturer in Academic Studies at the Royal Northern College of Music, Manchester. The premiere of the revised version was given in Vienna in 1996, with Daniel Hope as soloist. Hope also made the first recording of this version, in 2004 with the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Paul Watkins.

<doc id="161532" wikidata="Q7541091" url="?curid=161532" title="Sloane Ranger">
<text>In the United Kingdom, a Sloane Ranger, or simply a Sloane, is a stereotypical upper-middle or upper-class person, typically although not necessarily a young one, who embodies a very particular upbringing and outlook. The Sloane Ranger style is a uniform, effortless, and unambitious although sophisticated one. Its counterpart in the US is the preppy style and in France is &quot;bon chic bon genre&quot;. 

The term is a pun based on references to Sloane Square, a location in Chelsea, London, famed for the wealth of its residents and frequenters, and the television character &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;.

==Origin==

The coinage came from Martina (Tina) Margetts, a sub-editor on &quot;Harpers &amp; Queen&quot; who worked (with fellow sub-editor Laura Pank) on the 1975 article. In her early twenties she had found herself amongst this social group while undertaking a course on fine art at the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Initially, the term &quot;Sloane Ranger&quot; was used mostly in reference to women, a particular archetype being Diana, Princess of Wales. However, the term now usually includes men. A male Sloane has also been referred to as a &quot;Rah&quot; and by the older term &quot;Hooray Henry&quot;.

Although Sloanes are nowadays supposedly more widely spread and amorphous than in the past, they are still perceived to socialise in the expensive areas of west London, most notably King&#x27;s Road, Fulham Road, Kensington High Street, and other areas of Kensington, Chelsea and Fulham. The pubs and nightclubs in these areas are popular with Sloanes, in particular the White Horse pub, known as the &quot;Sloaney Pony&quot; in Fulham, and Admiral Codrington, known as &quot;The Cod&quot;, in Chelsea.

In 2015, Peter York argued that the Sloane population has been winnowed and that Sloanes were more likely to be leading the British trend to downward social mobility. In 2023, &quot;Tatler&quot; announced that it was time for the Sloane Rangers to &quot;step aside&quot; for the Bopeas, or Bohemian Peasants, a term and social theory describing downwardly mobile elite embracing a &quot;rural life of making, brewing, fermenting and foraging&quot;.

==Sloanes==
The following people have been considered by some to be Sloanes:

* Jemima Goldsmith
* James Hewitt, Army officer and lover of Diana, Princess of Wales
* Tara Palmer-Tomkinson
* Trinny and Susannah
* Catherine, Princess of Wales
* Sarah, Duchess of York

==See also==

* Bon chic bon genre
* Bourgeois personality 
* British country clothing
* Class conflict
* Fuerdai
* I.J.G.B.
* International Debutante Ball
* Sloane Street
* Trixie (slang)
* Upper Class Twit of the Year (parody)
* Young fogey
* Bopea, or &quot;Bohemian Peasants&quot;, proclaimed by &quot;Tatler&quot; to be the Sloane Rangers&#x27; successors

<text>The National Park Service (NPS) is an agency of the United States federal government, within the US Department of the Interior. The service manages all national parks; most national monuments; and other natural, historical, and recreational properties, with various title designations. The United States Congress created the agency on August 25, 1916, through the National Park Service Organic Act. Its headquarters is in Washington, D.C., within the main headquarters of the Department of the Interior.

The NPS employs about 20,000 people in units covering over in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and US territories. In 2019, the service had more than 279,000 volunteers. The agency is charged with preserving the ecological and historical integrity of the places entrusted to its management and with making them available for public use and enjoyment.

==History==


Artist George Catlin, during an 1832 trip to the Dakotas, was perhaps the first to suggest the concept of a national park. Indian civilization, wildlife, and wilderness were all in danger, wrote Catlin, unless they could be preserved &quot;by some great protecting policy of government... in a magnificent park... A nation&#x27;s Park, containing man and beast, in all the wild[ness] and freshness of their nature&#x27;s beauty!&quot; Yellowstone National Park was created as the first national park in the United States. In 1872, there was no state government to manage it (Wyoming was a U.S. territory at that time), so the federal government managed it directly through the army, including the famed African American Buffalo Soldier units.

The movement for an independent agency to oversee these federal lands was spearheaded by business magnate and conservationist Stephen Mather. With the help of journalist Robert Sterling Yard, Mather ran a publicity campaign for the Department of the Interior. They wrote numerous articles that praised the scenic and historic qualities of the parks and their possibilities for educational, inspirational, and recreational benefits.

This campaign resulted in the creation of the NPS. On August 25, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed the National Park Service Organic Act that mandated the agency &quot;to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations&quot;. Mather became the first director of the newly formed NPS.

On March 3, 1933, President Herbert Hoover signed the Reorganization Act of 1933. The act gave the president the authority to transfer national monuments from one governmental department to another. Later that summer, new president Franklin D. Roosevelt made use of this power after NPS Deputy Director Horace M. Albright suggested that the NPS, rather than the War Department, should manage historic American Civil War sites.

President Roosevelt agreed and issued two executive orders to implement the reorganization. These two executive orders transferred to the NPS all of the War Department&#x27;s historic sites as well as national monuments that the Department of Agriculture had managed and parks in and around Washington, D.C. that an independent federal office had previously operated.

The popularity of the parks after the end of the World War II left them overburdened with demands that the NPS could not meet. In 1951, Conrad Wirth became director of the NPS and began to bring park facilities up to the standards that the public was expecting. In 1952, with the support of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Wirth began Mission 66, a ten-year effort to upgrade and expand park facilities for the 50th anniversary of the Park Service. New parks were added to preserve unique resources and existing park facilities were upgraded and expanded.

In 1966, as the Park Service turned 50 years old, emphasis began to turn from just saving great and wonderful scenery and unique natural features to making parks accessible to the public. Director George Hartzog began the process with the creation of the National Lakeshores and then National Recreation Areas.

===Resource stewardship policies===

====1963: The Leopold Report====
A 1963 report titled &quot;Wildlife Management in the National Parks&quot; was prepared by a five-member advisory board on Wildlife Management, appointed by United States Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall. This report came to be referred to in later years by its chairman and principal author, A. Starker Leopold. The Leopold Report was just fourteen pages in length, but it set forth ecosystem management recommendations that would guide parks policy until it was revisited in 2012.

The Leopold Report was the first concrete plan for managing park visitors and ecosystems under unified principles. Park management issues and controversies addressed in this report included the difficulties of managing elk populations in Yellowstone National Park and how &quot;overprotection from natural ground fires&quot; in California&#x27;s Sequoia National Park, Kings Canyon National Park, and Yosemite National Park had begun to threaten groves of Giant Sequoia with catastrophic wildfires. The report also established a historical baseline that read, &quot;The goal of managing the national parks and monuments should be to preserve, or where necessary to recreate, the ecologic scene as viewed by the first European visitors.&quot; This baseline would guide ecological restoration in national parks until a climate change adaptation policy, &quot;Resist-Adapt-Direct&quot;, was established in 2021.

====2012: Revisiting Leopold: Resource Stewardship in the National Parks====
National Parks director Jonathan Jarvis charged the twelve-member NPS Advisory Board Science Committee to take a fresh look at the ecological issues and make recommendations for updating the original Leopold Report. The committee published their 23-page report in 2012, titled, &quot;Revisiting Leopold: Resource Stewardship in the National Parks&quot;. The report recommended that parks leadership &quot;manage for change while confronting uncertainty.&quot;

&quot;... New and emerging scientific disciplines — including conservation biology, global change science, and genomics — along with new technological tools like high-resolution remote sensing can provide significant information for constructing contemporary tactics for NPS stewardship. This knowledge is essential to a National Park Service that is science-informed at all organizational levels and able to respond with contemporary strategies for resource management and ultimately park stewardship.&quot;

====2021: Resist-Accept-Direct (RAD): A Framework for the 21st-century Natural Resource Manager====
The &quot;Revisiting Leopold&quot; report mentioned climate change three times and &quot;climate refugia&quot; once, but it did not prescribe or offer any management tactics that could help parks managers with the problems of climate change. Hence, the 2021 report specific to the need for climate adaptation: &quot;Resist-Accept-Direct (RAD): A Framework for the 21st-century Natural Resource Manager.&quot; This &quot;Natural Resource Report&quot; has ten authors. Among them are four associated with the National Park Service, three with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and two with the US Geological Survey — all of which are government agencies within the US Department of Interior.

The report&#x27;s Executive Summary, points to &quot;intensifying global change.&quot;

&quot;... The convention of using baseline conditions to define goals for today&#x27;s resource management is increasingly untenable, presenting practical and philosophical challenges for managers. As formerly familiar ecological conditions continue to change, bringing novelty, surprise, and uncertainty, natural resource managers require a new, shared approach to make conservation decisions... The RAD (Resist-Accept-Direct) decision framework has emerged over the past decade as a simple tool that captures the entire decision space for responding to ecosystems facing the potential for rapid, irreversible ecological change.&quot;

Here, the iconic species of Joshua Tree National Park is a leading example.

The three RAD options are:
* Resist the trajectory of change, by working to maintain or restore ecosystem processes, function, structure, or composition based upon historical or acceptable current conditions.
* Accept the trajectory of change, by allowing ecosystem processes, function, structure, or composition to change, without intervening to alter their trajectory.
* Direct the trajectory of change, by actively shaping ecosystem processes, function, structure, or composition towards desired new conditions.

The &quot;Resist-Accept-Direct&quot; Framework is first described in a July 2020 paper published in &quot;Fisheries&quot; Eighteen researchers from federal and state agencies and universities collaborated in this effort, which included short case studies of where and how this framework has already been applied.

==National Park System==


The National Park System includes all properties managed by the National Park Service, which have a wide variety of titles or designations. The system as a whole is considered to be a national treasure of the United States, and some of the more famous national parks and monuments are sometimes referred to as &quot;crown jewels&quot;.

The system encompasses approximately , of which remain in private ownership. The largest unit is Wrangell–St. Elias National Park and Preserve, Alaska. At 13,200,000 acres (53,000 km2), it is over 16 percent of the entire system. The smallest unit in the system is Thaddeus Kosciuszko National Memorial, Pennsylvania, at 0.02 acres (80 m2).

In addition to administering its units and other properties, the NPS also provides technical and financial assistance to several affiliated areas authorized by Congress. The largest affiliated area is New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve at 1,164,025 acres (4711 km2). The smallest is Benjamin Franklin National Memorial at less than .

While there are laws generally covering all units of the National Park System, they are subject to management policies of individual pieces of authorizing legislation or, in the case of national monuments created under the Antiquities Act, Executive Order. For example, because of provisions within their enabling legislation, Congaree National Park is almost entirely a wilderness area devoid of development, yet Yosemite allows unique developments such as the Badger Pass Ski Area and the O&#x27;Shaughnessy Dam within its boundaries. Such irregularities would not be found in other parks unless specifically provided for with exceptions by the legislation that created them.

===Holdings===
===Criteria===
Most NPS units have been established by an act of Congress, with the president confirming the action by signing the act into law. The exception, under the Antiquities Act, allows the president to designate and protect areas as national monuments by executive order. Regardless of the method used, all parks are to be of national importance.

A potential park should meet all four of the following standards:
* It is an outstanding example of a particular type of resource.
* It possesses exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the natural or cultural themes of the nation&#x27;s heritage.
* It offers superlative opportunities for recreation, for public use and enjoyment, or for scientific study.
* It retains a high degree of integrity as a true, accurate, and relatively unspoiled example of the resource.
Before creation of a new unit, Congress typically directs the NPS to conduct a special resource study of a site to determine its national significance and suitability to be part of the National Park System.

===Nomenclature===
The NPS uses over 20 different titles for the park units it manages, including &quot;national park&quot; and &quot;national monument&quot;.
National parks preserve nationally and globally significant scenic areas and nature reserves.
National monuments preserve a single unique cultural or natural feature. Devils Tower National Monument was the first in 1906. While the National Park Service holds the most national monuments, a monument may be managed or co-managed by a different entity such as the Bureau of Land Management or the Forest Service.
National preserves are for the protection of certain resources and operate similar to many National Parks, but allow limited resource extraction. Activities like hunting, fishing, and some mining may be allowed depending on the site. Big Cypress National Preserve and Big Thicket National Preserve were created in 1974 as the first national preserves.

National reserves are similar to national preserves, but the operational authority can be placed with a state or local government. New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve was the first to be established in 1978.

National historic sites protect a significant cultural resource that is not a complicated site.

National historical parks are larger areas with more complex subjects. Historic sites may also be protected in other unit types.

National military parks, battlefield parks, battlefield sites, and battlefields preserve areas associated with military history. The different designations reflect the complexity of the event and the site. Many of the sites preserve important Revolutionary War battles and Civil War battlefields. &quot;Military parks&quot; are the sites of larger actions, such as Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, Vicksburg National Military Park, Gettysburg National Military Park, and Shiloh National Military Park—the original four from 1890.

Examples of &quot;battlefield parks&quot;, &quot;battlefield sites&quot;, and &quot;national battlefields&quot; include Richmond National Battlefield Park, Brices Cross Roads National Battlefield Site, and Antietam National Battlefield.

National memorials are areas that officially memorialize a person or event, though unlike a National Historical Site, may or may not be placed at a specific historical location. Several national memorials are on the National Mall, such as the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial.

National seashores and national lakeshores offer preservation of the national coast line, while supporting water–based recreation. Cape Hatteras National Seashore was created in 1937. Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore and Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, created in 1966, were the first national lakeshores.

National rivers and wild and scenic riverways protect free-flowing streams over their length. The riverways may not be altered with dams, channelization, or other changes. Recreational pursuits are encouraged along the waterways. Ozark National Scenic Riverways was established in 1964.
National recreation areas originally were units surrounding reservoirs impounded by dams built by other federal agencies, the first being Lake Mead National Recreation Area. Some national recreation areas are in urban centers, such as Gateway National Recreation Area and Golden Gate National Recreation Area, which encompass significant cultural as well as natural resources.
The National Trails System preserves long-distance routes across America. The system was created in 1968 and consists of two major components: National scenic trails are long-distance trails through some of the most scenic parts of the country. They received official protection in 1968. The Appalachian Trail is the best known. National historic trails commemorate the routes of major historic events. Some of the best known are the Trail of Tears, the Mormon Trail, and the Santa Fe Trail. These trails are administered by several federal agencies.
===Special designations===
Wilderness areas are part of the National Wilderness Preservation System, which consists of federally managed lands that are of a pristine condition, established by the Wilderness Act (Public Law 88-577) in 1964. The National Wilderness Preservation System originally created hundreds of wilderness zones within already protected federally administered property, consisting of over 9 million acres (36,000 km2).

Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) began with Executive Order 13158 in May 2000, when official MPAs were established for the first time. The initial listing of U.S. areas was presented in 2010, consisting of areas already set aside under other legislation. The NPS has 19 park units designated as MPAs.

==Visitation==
The National Park System received over 325 million recreation visits in 2023. Park visitation grew 64 percent between 1979 and 2015.

The 10 most-visited units of the National Park System handle around 30 percent of the overall visits. The top 10 percent of parks (43) handle over 64 percent of all visits, leaving the remaining more than 380 units to accommodate around 36 percent of visits. (Note that only 380 sites recorded visitors during 2021 due to COVID-19-related closures).


===Entrance fees===
Most areas of the National Park System do not charge entrance fees and are completely supported by tax dollars, although some of the most popular areas do charge entrance fees. Fees vary site to site and are charged either on a per-vehicle or per-person basis, with most passes valid for 7 days. The America the Beautiful Pass series waives the per-vehicle fee or per-person fee for the holder and up to 3 other adults (children age 15 and younger are admitted for free at most sites). Annual passes for single areas are also available for those who visit the same site often.

===Overnight stays===
Over 15 million visitors spent a night in one of the national park units during 2015. The largest number (3.68 million) were tent campers. The second largest group (3.38 million) stayed in one of the lodges, followed by miscellaneous stays (on boats, group sites—2.15 million). The last three groups of over-night visitors included RV campers (2.26 million), backcountry campers (2.02 million) and users of the concession-run campgrounds (1.42 million).

==Budget==
In 2019, the NPS had an annual budget of $4.085 billion and an estimated $12 billion maintenance backlog. On August 4, 2020, the Great American Outdoors Act was signed into law reducing the $12 billion maintenance backlog by $9.5 billion over a 5-year period beginning in FY 2021. As of 2022, the NPS had the largest budget allocation of any Department of the Interior bureau or program.

The NPS budget is divided into two primary areas, &quot;discretionary&quot; and &quot;mandatory&quot; spending. Within each of these areas, there are numerous specific purposes to which Congress directs the services activities.

The NPS budget includes &quot;discretionary&quot; spending which is broken out into two portions: the direct operations of the National Parks and the special initiatives. Listed separately are the special initiatives of the service for the year specified in the legislation. During fiscal year 2010, the service was charged with five initiatives. They include: stewardship and education; professional excellence; youth programs; climate change impacts; and budget restructure and realignment.

===Discretionary spending===
Discretionary spending includes the Operations of the National Parks (ONPS), from which all park operations are paid. The United States Park Police funds cover the high-profile law enforcement operations at some of the large parks, including Gateway National Recreation Area, Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and the National Mall. The &quot;National Recreation and Preservation Program&quot; and the &quot;Urban Park and Recreation Fund&quot; are outreach programs to support state and local outdoor recreational activities.

The ONPS section of the budget is divided into six operational areas. These areas include:

====Resource stewardship====
These are funds and people directed towards the restoration, preservation, and maintenance of natural and cultural resources. The resource staff includes biologists, geologists, archeologists, museum curators, preservation specialists, and a variety of specialized employees to restore and preserve cultural buildings or natural features.

====Visitor services====
The NPS allocates funds obtained from its visitor services for use in public programs and for educational programs for the general public and school groups. Park rangers trained in providing walks, talks, and educational programs to the public frequently conduct such programs. Media specialists prepare exhibits along trails, roads and in visitor contact facilities, as well as written brochures and web-sites.

====Park protection====
This includes the staff responding to visitor emergencies (criminal, medical, search and rescue), and the protection of the park&#x27;s natural and cultural resources from damage by those persons visiting the park. The staff includes law enforcement rangers, park police, lifeguards, criminal investigators, and communication center operators. In many instances they also work with state and territorial fish and wildlife management agency rangers.

====Facility maintenance and operations====
This is the cost of maintaining the necessary infrastructure within each park that supports all the services provided. It includes the plows and heavy equipment for road clearing, repairs and construction. There are buildings, trails, roads, docks, boats, utility pipes and wires, and a variety of hidden systems that make a park accessible by the public. The staff includes equipment operators, custodians, trail crews, electricians, plumbers, engineers, architects, and other building trade specialists.

====Park support====
This is the staff that provides for the routine logistical needs of the parks. There are human resource specialists, contracting officers, property specialists, budget managers, accountants and information technology specialists.

====External administrative costs====
The NPS pays external administrative costs to outside organizations that provide the logistical support that the NPS needs to operate its facilities. These costs include rent payments to the General Services Administration for building space, postage payments to the postal machine vendor and other direct payments.

===Land and Water Conservation Fund===
The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) supports Land Acquisition and State Conservation Assistance (SCA) grant programs. In 2010, the LWCF began an incremental process to fully fund its programs at a total cost of $900 million. The Department of the Interior and the United States Forest Service use these funds to purchase critical lands to protect existing public lands.

The LWCF also issues grants to States and local jurisdictions to preserve and protect Civil War battlefield sites that are not part of the national park system. The SCA program distributes funds for land preservation to individual states.

===Historic Preservation Fund===
The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 set the federal vision for historic preservation in the United States. To support the vision and framework laid out in this act, the Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) was established in 1977 to provide financial assistance to, originally, states, to carry out activities related to preservation. Funding is provided from Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas lease revenues, not tax dollars, and an amount is appropriated annually by Congress. Awards from the HPF are made to States, Tribes, Territories, local governments, and non-profits. Two specific programs include the Save America&#x27;s Treasures and the Preserve America. The Historic Preservation Offices makes grants available to the States, territories, and tribal lands. To honor the 250th anniversary of the United States, Congress authorized the Semiquincentennial Grant in 2020 to support the preservation of State owned sites and structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places that commemorate the founding of the nation.

===Economic benefits===
The NPS affects economies at national, state, and local levels. According to a 2011 Michigan State University report prepared for the NPS, for each $1 invested in the NPS, the American public receives $4 in economic value. In 2011, national parks generated $30.1 billion in economic activity and 252,000 jobs nationwide. Thirteen billion of that amount went directly into communities within 60 miles of a NPS unit.

In a 2017 study, the NPS found that 331 million park visitors spent $18.2 billion in local areas around National Parks across the nation. This spending helped support 306,000 jobs. The NPS expenditures supported $297 million in economic output in Missouri alone.

==Concessions==
In an effort to increase visitation and allow for a larger audience to enjoy national park land, the NPS has numerous concession contracts with private businesses to bring recreation, resorts and other &quot;compatible&quot; amenities to their parks. NPS lodging opportunities exist at places such as the Wawona Hotel in Yosemite National Park and the Fort Baker Retreat and Conference Center in Golden Gate National Recreation Area.

* Delaware North Corporation at Yosemite National Park, Yellowstone National Park, South Rim Grand Canyon National Park.
* Forever Resorts at Big Bend National Park, Blue Ridge Parkway, Badlands National Park, North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, Olympic National Park, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Mammoth Cave National Park, Isle Royale National Park, and Rocky Mountain National Park.
* Xanterra Parks &amp; Resorts at Bryce Canyon National Park, Crater Lake National Park, Death Valley National Park, South Rim Grand Canyon National Park, Mount Rushmore National Memorial, Painted Desert at Petrified Forest National Park, Yellowstone National Park, and Zion National Park.

===Litigation with Delaware North===
In 2015, Delaware North sued the NPS in the United States Court of Federal Claims for breach of contract, alleging that the NPS had undervalued its trademarks of the names of iconic Yosemite National Park concession facilities. The NPS estimated the value of the intangible assets including the names &quot;Ahwahnee&quot;, &quot;Badger Pass&quot;, &quot;Curry Village&quot;, and &quot;Yosemite Lodge&quot; at $3.5 million. Delaware North lost the contract, and asserted that the historic names were worth $51 million and maintained that the incoming concessioner had to be paid that amount.

The Justice Department and the NPS asserted that this was an &quot;improper and wildly inflated&quot; value. Rather than pay Delaware North&#x27;s demanded valuation, in January 2016 the NPS instead opted to rename the famous landmarks, effective in March. The Ahwahnee Hotel is slated to become The Majestic Yosemite Hotel, Curry Village will become Half Dome Village, and the Wawona Hotel will become Big Trees Lodge. Widespread public outcry focused on Delaware North&#x27;s decision to claim ownership of names within a national park. The names were restored in 2019 upon settlement of the dispute.

==Offices==

The national headquarters is located in the Main Interior Building, 1849 C Street NW, several blocks southwest of the White House. The central office is composed of eleven directorates: director/deputy directors; business services; workforce management; chief information officer; cultural resources; natural resource stewardship and science; office of the comptroller; park planning, facilities and lands; partnerships and visitor experience; visitor and resource protection; and the United States Park Police.

Regional offices are in Anchorage, Atlanta, Lakewood, CO (Denver), Omaha, NE, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Seattle. The headquarters building of the National Park Service Southwest Regional Office is architecturally significant and is designated a National Historic Landmark.

The NPS is an operating unit of the U.S. Department of the Interior. The NPS director is nominated by the president of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate. The director is supported by six senior executives.

These executives manage national programs, policy, and budget from the Washington, DC, headquarters. Under the deputy director of operations are seven regional directors, who are responsible for national park management and program implementation. Together this group is called the &quot;National Leadership Council&quot;.

==Staff and volunteers==

===Directors===


===Employees===
By the mid-1950s, the primary employees of the service were the park rangers, who had broad responsibilities on the parks&#x27; behalf. They cleaned up trash, operated heavy equipment, fought fires, managed traffic, cleared trails and roads, provided information to visitors, managed museums, performed rescues, flew aircraft, and investigated crime.

The NPS employs many kinds of workers:
* National Park Service Ranger
** Interpreter
** Law enforcement
* Park management (Superintendent/Deputy)
* United States Park Police
* Emergency management (Emergency medical providers, search and rescue specialists)
** Lifeguards
* Dispatchers
* Maintenance (including carpenters, plumbers, masons, laborers, auto mechanics, motor vehicle operators, heavy equipment operators, electricians)
* Park planning
** Architects, engineers, and landscape architects
* Resource management (including archeologist, biologist, botanist, aquatics, soil scientist, geologist)
* History (curators, historians, preservation technicians, historic architects, archivists)
* Fire management (managers, weather specialist, firefighters, engine captains, crew superintendents, battalion chiefs)
* Public affairs
* Administration (human resources, finance, accountants, information technology, budgeting, concessions management)

Locations are varied. Parks exist in the nation&#x27;s larger cities like New York City (Federal Hall Memorial National Historic Site), Atlanta (Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site), and San Diego (Cabrillo National Monument) to some of the remotest areas of the continent like Hovenweep National Monument in southeastern Utah, to Aniakchak National Monument in King Salmon, Alaska.

===Volunteers-In-Parks (VIP)===
The Volunteers-In-Parks program was authorized in 1969 by the Volunteers in the Parks Act of 1969. for the purpose of allowing the public to serve in the nations parks providing support and skills for their enhancement and protection.

Volunteers come from all walks of life and include professionals, artists, laborers, homemakers and students, performing varied duties. Many come from surrounding communities and some travel significant distances. In a 2005 annual report, the NPS reported that,

...137,000 VIPs contributed 5.2 million hours of service (or 2500 FTEs) valued at $91,260,000 based on the private sector value figure of $17.55 as used by AARP, Points of Light Foundation, and other large-scale volunteer programs including many federal agencies. There are 365 separate volunteer programs throughout the NPS. Since 1990, the number of volunteers has increased an average of 2% per year.

FTE stands for full-time equivalent (one work year). In 2012, the National Park Service reported that over 221,000 volunteers contributed about 6.4 million hours annually.

Additionally, other types of volunteers also conduct offsite NPS public outreach and education, such as the Trails &amp; Rails program guides on board certain segments of long-haul Amtrak routes, who offer passengers insights to the travel area&#x27;s natural resources and heritage.

===Artist-In-Residence===
Across the nation, there are special opportunities for artists (visual artists, photographers, sculptors, performers, writers, composers, and crafts) to live and work in a park. Twenty-nine parks currently participate in the &quot;Artist-In-Residence program&quot;.

===United States Park Rangers===

National Park Service rangers are among the uniformed employees charged with protecting and preserving areas set aside in the National Park System by the United States Congress and the President of the United States. While all employees of the agency contribute to the National Park Service mission of preserving unimpaired the natural and cultural resources set aside by the American people for future generations, the term &quot;park ranger&quot; is traditionally used to describe all National Park Service employees who wear the uniform. Broadly speaking, all National Park Service rangers promote stewardship of the resources in their care—either voluntary stewardship via resource interpretation, or compliance with statute or regulation through law enforcement. These comprise the two main disciplines of the ranger profession in the National Park Service.

Law enforcement rangers, or protection rangers, are uniformed federal law enforcement officers with broad authority to enforce federal and state laws within NPS sites. The NPS commonly refers to law enforcement operations in the agency as &quot;visitor and resource protection&quot;.

In most NPS units, law enforcement rangers are the primary police agency. The NPS also employs special agents who conduct more complex criminal investigations. Rangers and agents receive extensive police training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center and annual in-service and regular firearms training.

===United States Park Police===
The United States Park Police (USPP) is the oldest uniformed federal law enforcement agency in the United States. It functions as a full service law enforcement agency with responsibilities and jurisdiction in those NPS areas primarily located in the Washington, D.C. Parks, San Francisco, and New York City Parks areas.

In addition to performing the normal crime prevention, investigation, and apprehension functions of an urban police force, the park police are responsible for policing many of the famous monuments in the United States and share law enforcement jurisdiction in all lands administered by the service with a force of national park rangers tasked with the same law enforcement powers and responsibilities.

===Youth programs===
The NPS partners with a variety of youth oriented programs. The oldest serving group is the Student Conservation Association (SCA). It was established in 1957, committed to conservation and preservation. The SCA&#x27;s goal is to create the next generation of conservation leaders.

SCA volunteers work through internships, conservation jobs, and crew experiences. Volunteers conduct resource management, historic preservation, cultural resources and conservation programs to gain experience, which can lead to career development and further educational opportunities. The SCA places volunteers in more than 350 national park units and NPS offices each year.

The Corps Network, formerly known as the National Association for Service and Corps (NASCC), represents 136 Service and Conservation Corps. These groups have programs in 42 states and the District of Columbia. Corpsmembers are between the ages of 16–25. Service and Conservation Corps are direct descendants of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) of the 1930s that built park facilities in the national parks and other public parks around the country. The Corps Network was established in 1985.

* The Youth Conservation Corps (ages 15–18) brings young people into a park to restore, preserve and protect a natural, cultural, or historical resources. Enrollees are paid for their work.
* Public Land Corps (ages 16–25) is a job helping to restore, protect, and rehabilitate a local national parks. The enrollees learn about environmental issues and the parks.

==Special divisions==
Other special NPS divisions include the Archeology Program, Historic American Buildings Survey, National Register of Historic Places, National Natural Landmarks, the Rivers, Trails and Conservation Assistance Program, the Challenge Cost Share Program, the Federal Lands to Parks, the Hydropower Relicensing Program, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the National Trails System, the Partnership Wild and Scenic Rivers Program, Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division., and the Historic Preservation Training Center (HPTC). 

There is also an (ISB), based at NPS headquarters in Washington, D.C. which has personnel distributed among the parks.

===Centers===
The NPS operates four archaeology-related centers: Harpers Ferry Center, in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia; the Midwest Archeological Center, in Lincoln, Nebraska; the Southeast Archeological Center, in Tallahassee, Florida; and the Western Archeological and Conservation Center, in Tucson, Arizona. The Harpers Ferry Center specializes in developing interpretive media and in conserving objects. The others focus to various degrees on archaeological research and the curation and conservation of museum objects.

National Park Service training centers include the Horace Albright Training Center, Grand Canyon; the Stephen Mather Training Center, Harpers Ferry, West Virginia; the Historic Preservation Training Center, Frederick, Maryland; and the Capital Training Center, Washington, D.C.

The Submerged Resources Center catalogues and evaluates submerged resources in the National Park system. The SRC&#x27;s headquarters are at the Intermountain Region&#x27;s headquarters, in Lakewood, Colorado.

The National Center for Preservation Technology and Training, in Natchitoches, Louisiana, conducts research and training in archaeology, architecture, landscape architecture, and materials conservation.

===Preservation Programs===

The oldest federal preservation program, the Historic American Buildings Survey/Historic American Engineering Record (HABS/HAER), produces graphic and written documentation of historically significant architectural, engineering and industrial sites and structures. Dating from 1934, the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) was chartered to document historic architecture—primarily houses and public buildings—of national or regional significance. Originally a New Deal employment/preservation program, after World War II, HABS employed summer teams of advanced undergraduate and graduate students to carry out the documentation, a tradition followed to this day. Many of the structures they documented no longer exist.

HABS/HAER produces measured drawings, large-format photographs and written histories of historic sites, structures and objects, that are significant to the architectural, engineering and industrial heritage of the U.S. Its 25,000 records are part of the Library of Congress. HABS/HAER is administered by the NPS Washington office and five regional offices.

====Historic American Buildings Survey====
In 1933, the NPS established the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS), based on a proposal by Charles E. Peterson, Park Service landscape architect. It was founded as a make-work program for architects, draftsmen and photographers left jobless by the Great Depression. Guided by field instructions from Washington, D.C., the first recorders were tasked with documenting a representative sampling of America&#x27;s architectural heritage. After 70 years, there is now an archive of historic architecture. HABS provided a database of primary source material for the then fledgling historic preservation movement.

====Historic American Engineering Record====
Recognizing a similar fragility in the national industrial and engineering heritage, the NPS, the Library of Congress and the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) formed the HAER program in 1969, to document nationally and regionally significant engineering and industrial sites. Later, HAER was ratified by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) and the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers (AIME). HAER documentation, in the forms of measured and interpretive drawings, large-format photographs and written histories, is archivally preserved in the Prints and Photographs Division of the Library of Congress, where it is readily available to the public.

Historic American Landscapes Survey

With the growing vitality of landscape history, preservation and management, proper recognition for historic American landscape documentation must be addressed. In response to this need, the American Society of Landscape Architects Historic Preservation Professional Interest Group worked with the National Park Service to establish a national program. Hence, in October 2000 the National Park Service permanently established the Historic American Landscapes Survey (HALS) program for the systematic documentation of historic American landscapes.

====Rivers, Trails and Conservation Assistance Program====
The NPS Rivers, Trails and Conservation Assistance (NPS-RTCA) program is designed to assist local communities and the public with planning for conservation and outdoor recreation projects. The NPS-RTCA program is able to work with local communities outside the borders of the nation&#x27;s National Parks because of the second sentence of the NPS Mission Statement. Unlike the mainline National Park Programs, these programs take place on non-federal property at the request of the local community. One of their better known programs is Rails to Trails, where unused railroad right-of-ways are converted into public hiking and biking trails.

====Japanese American Confinement Sites====
The National Park Service is responsible for the management and upkeep of several sites where Americans of Japanese descent were forcibly relocated and incarcerated Japanese Americans during World War II between 1942 and 1946 under the order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Japanese American Confinement Sites (JACS) grant program provides funding for applicants that preserve these sites and their memory.

===National Trails System===
The National Trails System is a joint mission of the NPS, the Bureau of Land Management and the US Forest Service. It was created in 1968 to establish a system of long-distance National Scenic and National Historic Trails, as well as to recognize existing trails in the states as National Recreation Trails. Several additional trails have been established since 1968, and in 2009 Congress established the first National Geologic Trail.

===National Heritage Areas===
National Heritage Areas are a unique blend of natural, cultural, historic, and scenic resources. These are not considered units of the NPS, as they are maintained by state/territorial governments or non-profit organizations (described as &quot;local coordinating entities&quot;). The National Park Service provides an advisory role and limited technical, planning and financial assistance. Designation of National Heritage Areas is done by an Act of Congress. As of 2021 there are 55 designated heritage areas, some of which cross state lines.

==Initiatives==
* 24-hr all Taxa BioBlitz: A joint venture of the National Geographic Society and the NPS. Beginning in 2004, at Rock Creek Parkway, the National Geographic Society and the NPS began a 10-year program of hosting a major biological survey of ten selected national park units. The intent is to develop public interest in the nations natural resources, develop scientific interest in America&#x27;s youth and to create citizen scientist.
** 2007: Rock Creek Park, Washington D.C. 661 species
** 2008: Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, Los Angeles, California. 1,700 species and more pending.
** 2009: Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, near Chicago in northern Indiana. 1,716 species and still counting.
** 2010: Biscayne National Park, Miami, Florida. 810 species were identified during this 24-hr event. As classification continues, more species will be added to the list.
** 2011: Saguaro National Park, Tucson, Arizona. During the 24 hours, 859 different species were identified, of which more than 400 were previously unknown in the park.
** 2012: Rocky Mountain National Park, in Estes Park, In August 2012 489 species were identified.
** 2013: Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve, in New Orleans. May 17–18, 2013 in the park&#x27;s Barataria Preserve.
** 2014: Golden Gate National Recreation Area
** 2015: Hawai&#x27;i Volcanoes National Park
** 2016: Whiskeytown National Recreation Area, Cabrillo National Monument, Channel Islands National Park, Washington, D.C.
** 2017: Virgin Islands National Park
* Biological Diversity: Biological Diversity is the vast variety of life as identified through species and genetics. This variety is decreasing as people spread across the globe, altering areas to better meet their needs.
* Climate Change: &quot;Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global sea levels.&quot; (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007).
* South Florida Restoration Initiative: Rescuing an Ecosystem in Peril: In partnership with the State of Florida, and the Army Corps of Engineers, the NPS is restoring the physical and biological processes of the South Florida ecosystem. Historically, this ecosystem contained some of the most diverse habitats on earth.
* Vanishing Treasures Initiative: Ruins Preservation in the American Southwest: The Vanishing Treasures Initiative began in FY 1998 to reduce threats to prehistoric and historic sites and structures in 44 parks of the Intermountain Region. In 2002, the program expanded to include three parks in the Pacific West Region. The goal is to reduce backlogged work and to bring sites and structures up to a condition where routine maintenance activities can preserve them.
* Wetlands: Wetlands includes marshes, swamps, and bogs. These areas and the plants and animals adapted to these conditions spread from the arctic to the equator. The shrinking wetlands provide habitat for fish and wildlife, help clean water and reduce the impact of storms and floods on the surrounding communities.
* Wildland Fire: Fires have been a natural part of park eco-systems. Many plants and some animals require a cycle of fire or flooding to be successful and productive. With the advent of human intervention and public access to parks, there are safety concerns for the visiting public.

===Green Park Plan===
In September 2010, the NPS released its Climate Change Response Strategy, followed in April 2012 by the Green Parks Plan.

====Climate Friendly Parks Program====
The Climate Friendly Parks Program is a subset of the Green Parks Plan. It was created in collaboration between the NPS and the US Environmental Protection Agency. The program is meant to measure and reduce greenhouse gases to help slow the effects of climate change.

Parks in the CFP program create and implement plans to reduce greenhouse gases through reducing energy and water use. Facilities are designed and retrofitted using sustainable materials. Alternative transportation systems are developed to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. Parks in the program offer public education programs about how the parks are already affected.

The CFP program provides climate-friendly solutions to the visiting public, like using clean energy, reducing waste, and making smart transportation choices. The CFP program can provide technical assistance, tools and resources for the parks and their neighboring communities to protect the natural and cultural resources.

The large, isolated parks typically generate their own electricity and heat and must do so without spoiling the values that the visitors have come to experience. Pollution is emitted by the vehicles used to transport visitors around the often-vast expanses of the parks. Many parks have converted vehicles to electric hybrids, and substitute diesel/electric hybrid buses for private automobiles. In 2001 it was estimated that replacement with electric vehicles would eliminate 25 TPY emissions entirely.

In 2010, the NPS estimated that reducing bottled water could eliminate 6,000 tons of carbon emissions and 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity every year. The NPS Concessions office voiced concerns about concessions impacts.

By 2014, 23 parks had banned disposable water bottles. In 2015, the International Bottled Water Association stated the NPS was &quot;leaving sugary drinks as a primary alternative&quot;, even though the Park Service provides water stations to refill bottles, &quot;encouraging visitors to hydrate for free&quot;. The Water Association made the national parks one of its top lobbying targets. In July 2015 Rep. Keith Rothfus added a &quot;last-minute&quot; amendment into Congress&#x27;s appropriations bill, blocking the NPS from funding or enforcing the program. The NPS discontinued its ban on disposable water bottles in August 2017.

===Cashless===
In an effort to save on cash processing and hand handling fees, 22 national parks have gone cashless as of 2023. In September 2023, US Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) proposed the &quot;Protecting Access to Recreation with Cash Act&quot; (PARC) which would require national parks to accept cash as a form of payment for entrance fee. In April 2024, several NPS visitors sued seeking to restore cash as a payment form noting how cash is legal tender suitable &quot;for all public charges&quot; and that the &quot;additional processing fees that will be borne by NPS and by visitors who ultimately fund the federal government through taxes, in addition to personal surcharges and bank fees visitors may incur under NPS cashless policy.&quot;

<text>Andrew William Mellon (; March 24, 1855 – August 26, 1937), known also as A. W. Mellon, was an American banker, businessman, industrialist, philanthropist, art collector, and politician. The son of Mellon family patriarch Thomas Mellon, he established a vast business empire before moving into politics. He served as United States Secretary of the Treasury from March 9, 1921, to February 12, 1932, presiding over the boom years of the 1920s and the Wall Street Crash of 1929. A conservative Republican, Mellon favored policies that reduced taxation and the national debt of the United States in the aftermath of World War I. Mellon also helped fund and manage Kennywood Park in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania.

Andrew began working at his father&#x27;s Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, bank, T. Mellon &amp; Sons, in the early 1870s, eventually becoming the leading figure in the institution. He later renamed T. Mellon &amp; Sons as Mellon National Bank and established another financial institution, the Union Trust Company in Pittsburgh in 1889. By the end of 1913, Mellon National Bank held more money in deposits than any other bank in Pittsburgh, and the second-largest bank in the region was controlled by Union Trust. In the course of his business career, Mellon owned or helped finance large companies including Alcoa, the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Old Overholt whiskey, Standard Steel Car Company, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, Koppers, the Pittsburgh Coal Company, the Carborundum Company, Union Steel Company, the McClintic-Marshall Construction Company, Gulf Oil, and numerous others. He was also an influential donor to the Republican Party during the Gilded Age and the Progressive Era.

In 1921, newly elected president Warren G. Harding chose Mellon as his Secretary of the Treasury. Mellon would remain in office until 1932, serving under Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover, all three of whom were members of the Republican Party. Mellon sought to reform federal taxation in the aftermath of World War I. He argued cutting tax rates on top earners would generate more tax revenue for the government, but otherwise left in place a progressive income tax. Some of Mellon&#x27;s proposals were enacted by the Revenue Act of 1921 and the Revenue Act of 1924, but it was not until the passage of the Revenue Act of 1926 that the &quot;Mellon plan&quot; was fully realized. He also presided over a reduction in the national debt, which dropped substantially in the 1920s. Mellon&#x27;s influence in state and national politics reached its zenith during Coolidge&#x27;s presidency. Journalist William Allen White noted that &quot;so completely did Andrew Mellon dominate the White House in the days when the Coolidge administration was at its zenith that it would be fair to call the administration the reign of Coolidge and Mellon.&quot;

Mellon&#x27;s national reputation collapsed following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression. He participated in various efforts by the Hoover administration to revive the economy and maintain the international economic order, but opposed direct government intervention in the economy. After Congress began impeachment proceedings against Mellon, President Hoover shifted Mellon to the position of United States ambassador to the United Kingdom. Mellon returned to private life after Hoover&#x27;s defeat in the 1932 presidential election by Franklin D. Roosevelt. Beginning in 1933, the federal government launched a tax fraud investigation on Mellon, leading to a high-profile case that ended with Mellon&#x27;s estate paying significant sums to settle the matter. Shortly before his death, in 1937, Mellon helped establish the National Gallery of Art. His philanthropic efforts also played a major role in the later establishment of Carnegie Mellon University and the National Portrait Gallery.

==Early life==
Mellon&#x27;s paternal grandparents, both of whom were Ulster Scots, migrated to the United States from County Tyrone, Ireland, in 1818. With their son, Thomas Mellon, they settled in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. Thomas Mellon established a successful legal practice in Pittsburgh, and in 1843 he married Sarah Jane Negley, an heiress descended from some of the first settlers of Pittsburgh. Thomas became a wealthy landowner and real estate speculator, and he and his wife had eight children, five of whom survived to adulthood. Andrew Mellon, the fourth son and sixth child of Thomas and Sarah, was born in 1855. Thomas Mellon became a prominent member of the local Republican Party, and in 1859 he won election to a position on the Pennsylvania court of common pleas. Because Thomas was suspicious of both private and public schools, he built a schoolhouse for his children and hired a teacher; Andrew attended this school beginning at age five.

In 1869, after leaving his judicial position, Thomas Mellon established T. Mellon &amp; Sons, a bank located in Pittsburgh. Andrew joined his father at the bank, quickly becoming a valued employee despite being in his early teens. Andrew also attended the Western University of Pennsylvania (which was later renamed the University of Pittsburgh), but he never graduated. After leaving Western University, Andrew briefly worked at a lumber and coal business before joining T. Mellon &amp; Sons as a full-time employee in 1873. That same year, the Panic of 1873 devastated the local and national economy, wiping out a portion of the Mellon fortune. With Andrew taking a leading role at T. Mellon &amp; Sons, the bank quickly recovered, and by late 1874 the bank&#x27;s deposits had reached the level they had been at before the onset of the Panic.

===Business career, 1873–1898===

Mellon&#x27;s role at T. Mellon &amp; Sons continued to grow after 1873, and in 1876 he was given power of attorney to direct the operations of the bank. That same year, Thomas introduced his son to Henry Clay Frick, a customer of the bank who would become one of Mellons&#x27;s closest friends. In 1882, Thomas turned over full ownership of the bank to his son, but Thomas continued to be involved in the bank&#x27;s activities. Five years later, Mellon&#x27;s younger brother, Richard B. Mellon, joined T. Mellon &amp; Sons as a co-owner and vice president.

During the 1880s, Mellon began to expand the bank&#x27;s activities. Along with Frick, Mellon gained control of the Pittsburgh National Bank of Commerce, a national bank that was authorized to print banknotes. Mellon also acquired or helped found the Union Insurance Company, City Deposit Bank, the Fidelity Title and Trust Company, and the Union Trust Company. He branched out into industrial concerns, becoming a director of the Pittsburgh Petroleum Exchange and a co-founder of two natural gas companies that collectively controlled 35,000 acres of gas lands in the late 1880s. In 1890, Thomas Mellon transferred his properties to Andrew, who would manage the properties on behalf of himself, his parents, and his brothers. In late 1894, Thomas transferred all of his remaining assets to Andrew. Despite the large sums entrusted to Andrew, the businesses he ran were still fairly small in the 1890s; T. Mellon &amp; Sons employed seven individuals in 1895.

In 1889, Mellon agreed to loan $25,000 to the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, a fledgling operation seeking to become the first successful industrial producer of aluminum. Mellon became a director of the company in 1891, and he and Richard played a major role in the establishment of aluminum factories in New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and Niagara Falls, New York. The company would emerge as one of the most profitable ventures invested in by the Mellons, and in 1907 it was renamed Alcoa. Moving into the petroleum industry, the Mellon family also established the Crescent Oil Company, the Crescent Pipeline Company, and the Bear Creek refinery. By 1894, the Mellon family&#x27;s vertically integrated companies produced ten percent of the oil exported by the United States. Partly due to the difficult economic conditions caused by the onset of the Panic of 1893, in 1895 the Mellons sold their oil interests to Standard Oil. At roughly the same time they were selling their oil concerns, Andrew and Richard invested in the Carborundum Company, a producer of silicon carbide. The brothers gained majority ownership of the Carborundum Company in 1898 and replaced the company&#x27;s founder and president, Edward Goodrich Acheson, with a Carnegie protege, Frank W. Haskell. Mellon also invested in mining concerns, becoming vice president of the Trade Dollar Consolidated Mining Company.

Mellon and Henry Clay Frick enjoyed a long-lasting business and social relationship, and Frick frequently hosted Mellon, attorney Philander C. Knox, inventor George Westinghouse, and others for poker games. Frick and Mellon both joined the Duquesne Club and, after Frick established the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, Mellon became one of that club&#x27;s first members. The South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club built the South Fork Dam, which supported an artificial lake that the club used for boating and fishing. In 1889, the dam broke, causing the Johnstown Flood, which killed 2,000 people and destroyed 1,600 homes. In the aftermath of the flood, Knox led a legal defense that successfully argued that the club bore no legal responsibility for the flood. Mellon did not publicly comment on the flood, though he did donate $1,000 to a relief fund.

===Business career, 1898–1920===

By the late 1890s, Mellon had amassed a substantial fortune, but his wealth paled in comparison to that of better-known business leaders such as John D. Rockefeller. In the late 1890s, the Union Trust Company emerged for the first time as one of Mellon&#x27;s most important and profitable holdings after Mellon broadened the company&#x27;s activities to include commercial banking. With an infusion of capital from Union Trust, Mellon underwrote the capitalization of National Glass and several other companies. He also became a co-owner of the McClintic-Marshall Construction Company and established Crucible Steel Company, the Pittsburgh Coal Company, and the Monongahela River Coal Company; the two coal companies collectively contributed 11 percent of the coal production of the United States. With Frick, Richard Mellon, and William Donner, Mellon co-founded Union Steel Company, which specialized in the production of nails and barbed wire. Though Frick had fallen out with steel magnate and long-time business partner Andrew Carnegie, Mellon received Carnegie&#x27;s consent to venture into the steel industry. Responding to the growing emphasis on naval power in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War, Mellon and Frick also became major shareholders in the New York Shipbuilding Corporation.

In 1902, Mellon reorganized T. Mellon &amp; Sons as the Mellon National Bank, a federally chartered National Bank. Andrew Mellon, Richard Mellon, and Frick drew up a new business arrangement in which the three of them jointly controlled the Union Trust Company, which in turn controlled Mellon National Bank. They also established Union Savings Bank, which accepted deposits by mail, and the Mellon banks flourished in the first years of the 20th century. While Mellon&#x27;s financial empire prospered, his investments in other areas, including Pittsburgh&#x27;s streetcar network, the Union Steel Company (which was bought out by U.S. Steel), and the Carborundum Company, also paid off handsomely. Another successful Mellon investment, the Standard Steel Car Company, was created in partnership with three former U.S. Steel executives. As part of the Texas oil boom, the Mellons also helped J. M. Guffey establish the Guffey Company. The Mellons later removed Guffey as the head of his company, and in 1907 they reorganized the Guffey Company as Gulf Oil and installed William Larimer Mellon Sr. (a son of Andrew Mellon&#x27;s older brother, James Ross Mellon) as the head of Gulf Oil. The success of Mellon&#x27;s financial empire and his varied investments made him, according to biographer David Cannadine, the &quot;single most significant individual in the economic life and progress of western Pennsylvania&quot; in the first decade of the 20th century.

The Panic of 1907 devastated several companies based in Pittsburgh, ending a period of strong growth. Some of Mellon&#x27;s investments experienced a sustained down period after 1907, but most experienced a quick recovery. Mellon also became an investor in George Westinghouse&#x27;s Westinghouse Electric Corporation after he helped prevent the company from going into bankruptcy. By the end of 1913, Mellon National Bank held more money in deposits than any other bank in Pittsburgh, and the Farmer&#x27;s Deposit National Bank, which held the second-largest amount of deposits, was controlled by Mellon&#x27;s Union Trust Company. In 1914, Mellon became a co-owner of Koppers, which produced a more sophisticated coking oven than the one that had earlier been pioneered by Frick. He also served as a director of various other companies, including the Pennsylvania Railroad and the American Locomotive Company. Mellon was deeply involved in the financing of World War I, as the Union Trust Company and other Mellon institutions provided millions of dollars in loans to the United Kingdom and France, and Mellon himself invested in Liberty bonds.

===Old Overholt whiskey===

In 1887, Frick, Andrew, and Richard Mellon jointly purchased Old Overholt, a whiskey distillery located in West Overton, Pennsylvania. At the time, Old Overholt was one of the largest and most respected whiskey producers in the country. In 1907, as prohibition became more popular across the country, Frick and Mellon removed their names from the distilling license but retained ownership in the company. It is believed that Mellon&#x27;s connections in the Treasury Department are what allowed the company to secure a medicinal permit during Prohibition. This permit allowed Overholt to sell existing whiskey stocks to druggists for medicinal use. When Frick died in December 1919, he left his share to Mellon. In 1925, under pressure from prohibitionists, Mellon sold his share of the company to a New York grocer.

===Early involvement in politics===
Like his father, Mellon consistently supported the Republican Party, and he frequently donated to state and local party leaders. Through state party boss Matthew Quay, Mellon influenced legislators to place high tariffs on aluminum products in the McKinley Tariff of 1890. During the early 20th century, Mellon was dismayed by the rise of progressivism and the antitrust actions pursued by the presidential administrations of Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson. He especially opposed the Taft administration&#x27;s investigations into Alcoa, which in 1912 signed a consent decree rather than going to trial. In the aftermath of World War I, he provided financial support to Henry Cabot Lodge and other Republicans in their successful campaign to prevent ratification of the Treaty of Versailles. Mellon attended the 1920 Republican National Convention as a nominal supporter of Pennsylvania Governor William Cameron Sproul (Mellon hoped Senator Philander Knox would win the nomination), but the convention chose Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio as the party&#x27;s presidential nominee. Mellon strongly approved of the party&#x27;s conservative platform, and he served as a key fundraiser for Harding during the presidential campaign.

==Political career, 1921–1933==
===Harding administration===

Following Harding&#x27;s victory in the 1920 presidential election, Harding considered various candidates for Secretary of the Treasury, including Frank Lowden, John W. Weeks, Charles Dawes, and, at the urging of Senator Knox, Andrew Mellon. By 1920, Mellon was little-known outside of banking circles, but his potential appointment to the cabinet received strong support from bankers and Pennsylvania Republican leaders like Knox, Senator Boies Penrose, and Governor Sproul. Mellon was reluctant to enter public life due to concerns about privacy and a belief that his ownership of various businesses, including Old Overholt distillery, would be a political liability. But Mellon also wanted to retire from active participation in business, and he saw a cabinet position as a prestigious capstone to his career.

Mellon agreed to accept appointment as Secretary of the Treasury in February 1921, and his nomination was quickly confirmed by the United States Senate. Though Mellon&#x27;s supporters believed that he was highly qualified to address the economic issues facing the country, critics of the Harding administration saw the Mellon appointment as a sign that Harding would &quot;reseat the power of special privileged interests, the powers of avarice and greed, the powers that seek self-aggrandizement at the expense of the general public&quot;. Harding paired the nomination of Mellon with that of Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, who was distrusted by many of the same Senate Republicans who favored Mellon&#x27;s candidacy. Before joining the cabinet, Mellon sold his banking stock to his brother, Richard, but he continued to hold his non-banking stock. Through Richard and other business associates, Mellon continued to be involved with the major decisions of the Mellon business empire during his time in public service, and he occasionally lobbied congressmen on behalf of his businesses. His fortune continued to grow, and at one point in the 1920s he paid more in federal income tax than any other individual save John Rockefeller and Henry Ford.

As Treasury Secretary, Mellon focused on balancing the budget and paying off World War I debts in the midst of the Depression of 1920–21; he was largely unconcerned with international affairs and economic matters such as the unemployment rate. To Mellon&#x27;s chagrin, his department was charged with enforcing Prohibition; he did not believe in teetotaling himself and viewed the law as unenforceable. Aside from balancing the budget, Mellon&#x27;s top priority was an overhaul of the federal tax code. The income tax had become a major part of the federal government&#x27;s revenue system with the passage of the Revenue Act of 1913, and federal taxation on income had increased during World War I to provide funding for the war effort. According to M. Susan Murnane, major reforms to the federal income tax in the aftermath of World War I were &quot;inevitable&quot;, but the exact nature of the tax system in the 1920s was debated by conservatives and progressives within the Republican Party. Unlike the progressives in his party, Mellon rejected the redistributive nature of the taxation system that had been left in place by the Wilson administration. Owing in part to the high debts left over from the war, Mellon did not join with some conservatives in the party, who favored the virtual abolition of the income tax in favor of high tariff rates, excise taxes, a national sales tax, or some combination thereof.
Mellon instead advocated the retention of a progressive income tax that would serve as an important, but not primary, source of revenue for the federal government. His so-called &quot;scientific taxation&quot; was designed to maximize federal revenue while minimizing the impact on business and industry. The central tenet of Mellon&#x27;s tax plan was a reduction of the surtax, a progressive tax that affected only high-income earners. Mellon argued that such a reduction would minimize tax avoidance and would not affect federal revenue because it would lead to greater economic growth. He hoped that tax reform would encourage high earners to move their savings from tax-exempt state and municipal bonds to taxable, higher yield industrial stocks. Though much of the tax plan that he proposed had been developed by former Wilson administration officials Russell Cornell Leffingwell and Seymour Parker Gilbert, the press generally referred to it as the &quot;Mellon Plan&quot;.

The Revenue Act of 1918 had set a top marginal income tax rate of 73% and a corporate tax of approximately 10%. Due in part to the size of the U.S. public debt, which had grown from $1 billion before the war to $24 billion in 1921, the provisions of the Revenue Act of 1918 remained in place when Harding took office. In 1921, the Treasury Department and the House Ways and Means Committee jointly prepared a bill setting the top marginal rate at the level advocated by Mellon, but opposition in the Senate from progressives like Senator Robert M. La Follette limited the size of the tax cuts. In November 1921, Congress passed and Harding signed the Revenue Act of 1921, which raised personal tax exemptions and lowered the top marginal tax rate to 58%. Because it differed from his original proposals, Mellon was displeased by the bill. He also strongly disapproved of a &quot;Bonus Bill&quot; passed by Congress that would provide for additional compensation to veterans of World War I, partly because he feared it would interfere with his plans to reduce debt and taxes. With Mellon&#x27;s support, Harding vetoed the bill, and Congress failed to override the veto.

===Coolidge administration===

As the economy recovered from recession and began to experience the prosperity of the Roaring Twenties, Mellon emerged as one of the most renowned figures in the Harding administration. One admiring congressman referred to Mellon as the &quot;greatest Secretary of the Treasury since Alexander Hamilton&quot;. Harding died after suffering a stroke in August 1923, and he was succeeded by Vice President Calvin Coolidge. Mellon enjoyed closer relations with President Coolidge than he had with President Harding, and Coolidge and Mellon shared similar views on most major issues, including the necessity for further tax cuts. William Allen White, a contemporary journalist, stated that &quot;so completely did Andrew Mellon dominate the White House in the days when the Coolidge administration was at its zenith that it would be fair to call the administration the reign of Coolidge and Mellon.&quot;

Coolidge, Mellon, business organizations, and administration allies conducted a publicity campaign designed to convince wavering congressmen to support Mellon&#x27;s tax plan. Their efforts were opposed by the coalition of Democrats and progressive Republicans that exercised effective control over the 68th Congress. In February 1924, the House Ways and Means Committee approved of a bill based on Mellon&#x27;s plan, but an alliance of progressive Republicans and Democrats engineered passage of an alternative tax bill written by Democrat John Nance Garner; Garner&#x27;s plan also reduced income taxes but set the top marginal tax rate at 46% rather than Mellon&#x27;s preferred 33%. In June 1924, Coolidge signed the Revenue Act of 1924, which contained the income tax rates of Garner&#x27;s bill and also increased the estate tax. Coolidge signed the bill but simultaneously called for further tax cuts. Congress also rejected Mellon&#x27;s proposed constitutional amendment that would have barred the issuance of tax-exempt securities and, over Coolidge&#x27;s veto, authorized a bonus to World War I veterans. Mellon did, however, win one legislative victory, as he convinced Congress to create the Board of Tax Appeals to adjudicate disputes between taxpayers and the government.

Mellon had originally planned to retire after one presidential term but decided to remain in the cabinet in the hope of presiding over the full enactment of his taxation proposals. In the 1924 presidential election, the Republicans campaigned on further tax cuts, while both the Democrats and third-party candidate Robert La Follette denounced Mellon&#x27;s tax proposals as &quot;a device to relieve multi-millionaires at the expense of other taxpayers&quot;. Buoyed by the strong economy, and overcoming the scandals of the Harding years, Coolidge won re-election by a decisive margin. Coolidge saw his victory as a mandate to pursue his favored economic policies, including further tax cuts.

When Congress reconvened after the 1924 elections, it immediately began working on another bill designed to lower tax rates on the highest earners. In February 1926, Coolidge signed the Revenue Act of 1926, which reduced the top marginal rate to 25%. Mellon was extremely pleased by the passage of the act, because, unlike the Revenue Act of 1921 and the Revenue Act of 1924, the Revenue Act of 1926 closely reflected Mellon&#x27;s proposals. In addition to cutting tax rates on top earners, the act also raised the personal exemption for federal income taxes, abolished the gift tax, reduced the estate tax rate, and repealed a provision that had required the public disclosure of federal income tax returns. Meanwhile, the booming economy fostered a $400 million budget surplus in 1926, and the country&#x27;s national debt dropped from $24 billion in early 1921 to $19.6 billion at the end of fiscal year 1926. Government revenues increased considerably under Mellon&#x27;s plan, largely collected from higher-income earners.

With his top priority of tax reform accomplished, Mellon increasingly turned over management of the Treasury Department to his deputy, Ogden L. Mills. After the 1926 elections, Mellon and Mills sought to cut the corporate tax and fully repeal the estate tax. The Revenue Act of 1928 did indeed cut the corporate tax, but the estate tax was left unchanged. Mellon also focused on the construction of new federal buildings, and his efforts led to the construction of several buildings in the Federal Triangle. In 1928, Mellon stated that &quot;in no other nation, and at no other time in the history of the world, have so many people enjoyed such a high degree of prosperity or maintained a standard of living comparable to that which prevails throughout this country today.&quot;

Responsibility for foreign relations lay with the State Department rather than the Treasury Department, and Benjamin Strong Jr. and other central bankers took the lead with regard to international monetary policy, but Mellon nonetheless exercised some influence in foreign affairs. He strongly opposed the cancellation of European debts from World War I but recognized that Britain and other countries would be unable to pay those debts without a renegotiation of terms. In 1923, Mellon and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Stanley Baldwin negotiated an agreement in which Britain promised to pay off the debts over a 62-year period. After the adoption of the Dawes Plan, Mellon reached debt settlements with several other European countries. After protracted negotiations, the United States and France agreed to the Mellon-Berenger Agreement, which reduced France&#x27;s debt and set terms for repayment.

===Hoover administration===
====1928 election====

Coolidge surprised many observers by announcing that he would not seek another term in August 1927. The decision left Hoover as the presumed front-runner for the 1928 presidential election, but many conservatives within the party opposed Hoover&#x27;s candidacy. The conservative resistance to Hoover centered around Mellon, who controlled Pennsylvania&#x27;s delegation at the 1928 Republican National Convention and was influential with Republicans throughout the country. Though they had maintained an amicable relationship in public, Mellon privately distrusted Hoover, resented Hoover&#x27;s engagement in the affairs of other cabinet departments and feared that a President Hoover would move away from Mellon&#x27;s tax policies. Several Republicans urged Mellon to run for president, but Mellon believed that he was too old to seek the presidency. Mellon attempted to convince Coolidge or Charles Evans Hughes to run, but neither heeded his appeals. In the months before the 1928 Republican Convention, Mellon maintained his neutrality in the presidential race, but with no compelling alternative Republican candidate willing to run, Mellon finally threw his support behind Hoover. With Mellon&#x27;s backing, Hoover won the Republican nomination on the first ballot of the convention, and he went on to defeat Al Smith in the 1928 presidential election. Defying widespread expectations that he would retire, Mellon chose to stay on as Secretary of the Treasury. Along with Secretary of Agriculture James Wilson and Secretary of Labor James J. Davis, Mellon is one of only three cabinet members to serve in the same post under three consecutive presidents.

====Great Depression====
Secretary Mellon had helped persuade the Federal Reserve Board to lower interest rates in 1921 and 1924; lower interest rates contributed to a booming economy, but they also encouraged stock market speculation. In 1928, responding to increasing fears of the dangers of speculation and a booming stock market, the Federal Reserve Board began raising interest rates. Mellon favored another interest rate increase in 1929, and in August 1929 the Federal Reserve Board raised the discount rate to six percent. The higher rate failed to curb speculation, and the activity on the stock market continued to grow. In October 1929, the New York Stock Exchange suffered the worst crash in its history in what was called &quot;Black Tuesday&quot;. As the vast majority of Americans did not own shares in the stock market, the crash did not immediately have disastrous effects on the U.S. economy as a whole. Mellon had little sympathy for the speculators who lost their money, and he was philosophically opposed to an interventionist economic policy designed to address the stock market crash. Nonetheless, Mellon immediately began calling for cuts to the discount rate, which would reach two percent in mid-1930, and successfully urged Congress to pass a bill providing for temporary, across-the-board tax cuts. Mellon supported the idea of asset liquidation to balance budgets, even if it meant shutting down entire industries.

By mid-1930, many, including Mellon, believed that the economy had already experienced the worst effects of the stock market crash. He did not object to the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act, which raised tariff rates to one of the highest levels in U.S. history. Despite the optimism of Hoover and Mellon, in late 1930 the economy went into a deep slump, as gross national product declined dramatically, and numerous workers lost their jobs. While numerous banks failed, Democrats won control of Congress in the 1930 mid-term elections. As the economy declined, so did Mellon&#x27;s popularity, which was further damaged by his opposition to another bonus bill for veterans. In mid-1931, the country entered a deep depression, and, at Hoover&#x27;s request, Mellon negotiated a moratorium on German debt repayments. After Mellon returned to the United States in August 1931, he was confronted by another series of bank failures. Among the banks that failed was the Bank of Pittsburgh, the lone remaining major Pittsburgh bank not controlled by the Mellon family. Again, following Hoover&#x27;s lead, Mellon presided over the creation of the National Credit Association, a voluntary initiative among the larger banks that was designed to assist failing institutions. As the National Credit Association proved to be ineffective at stemming the tide of bank failures, Congress and the Hoover administration established the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to provide federal loans to banks.

With the unemployment rate approaching twenty percent, Mellon became one of the most &quot;loathed leaders&quot; in the United States, second only to Hoover himself. Facing this unprecedented economic catastrophe, Mellon urged Hoover to refrain from using the government to intervene in the depression. Mellon believed that economic recessions, such as those that had occurred in 1873 and 1907, were a necessary part of the business cycle because they purged the economy. In his memoirs, Hoover wrote that Mellon advised him to &quot;liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate. Purge the rottenness out of the system. High costs of living and high living will come down. ... enterprising people will pick up the wrecks from less competent people.&quot;

Facing a large deficit, Mellon and Mills called for a return to the tax rates set by the Revenue Act of 1924 and also sought new taxes on automobiles, gasoline, and other items. Congress responded by passing the Revenue Act of 1932, which included many of the Treasury Department&#x27;s proposals. In early 1932, Congressman Wright Patman of Texas initiated impeachment proceedings against Mellon, contending that Mellon had violated numerous federal laws designed to prevent conflicts of interest. Though Mellon had defeated similar investigations in the past, his falling popularity left him unable to effectively counter Patman&#x27;s charges. Hoover removed Mellon from Washington by offering him the position of ambassador to the United Kingdom. Mellon accepted the post, and Mills replaced his former boss as Secretary of the Treasury.

Mellon arrived in Britain in April 1932, receiving a friendly reception from a country he had often visited over the previous thirty years. From his post, he watched the collapse of the international economic order, including the debt accords that he had helped negotiate. He also convinced the British to allow Gulf Oil to operate in Kuwait, a British protectorate in the oil-rich region of the Persian Gulf. Defying Mellon&#x27;s expectations, Hoover was defeated by Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. Mellon left office when Hoover&#x27;s term ended in March 1933, returning to private life after twelve years of government service.

===Pennsylvania politics, 1921–1933===

Knox and Penrose both died in 1921, leaving a power vacuum in Pennsylvania Republican politics. Along with his nephew, William Larimer Mellon, Mellon became an influential player in Pennsylvania politics, and their support helped ensure the elections of Senator David A. Reed and Senator George W. Pepper in 1922. Mellon was unable to assert the same level of control that Boies Penrose had had over state politics, and his leadership of the state party was challenged by William Scott Vare of Philadelphia and progressive leader Gifford Pinchot, who won the 1922 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election. Nonetheless, Mellon would continue to exert an important influence on Pennsylvania politics throughout the 1920s, especially in senatorial elections and in Allegheny County. Mellon&#x27;s influence over state politics waned in the early 1930s, as the progressive allies of Governor Pinchot took control of the state Republican Party.

==Later days==
Numerous financial institutions failed in the months prior to Roosevelt&#x27;s inauguration, but Mellon National Bank, the Union Trust Company, and another Mellon banking operation, Mellbank Corporation, were all able to avoid closure. Mellon strongly opposed Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal policies, especially the 1933 Banking Act, which required separation between commercial and investment banking. Mellon believed that the various New Deal policies, including Social Security and unemployment insurance, undermined the free market system that had produced one of the largest economies in the world. Aside from banking reform, other New Deal policies, including regulations on utilities and coal mines and laws designed to promote labor unions, also affected Mellon&#x27;s business empire. Additionally, the Revenue Act of 1934 and the Revenue Act of 1935 rescinded many of Mellon&#x27;s tax policies and contained other provisions that were designed to increase taxation on top earners and corporations.

Even after leaving office, Mellon continued to be vilified by many in the public, and in 1933 Harvey O&#x27;Connor published a popular and unfavorable biography, &quot;Mellon&#x27;s Millions&quot;. Democrats won effective control of Allegheny County in the 1933 elections, and the following year Democrat Joseph F. Guffey won Pennsylvania&#x27;s Senate election and George Howard Earle III won the state&#x27;s gubernatorial election. Mellon endured numerous attacks during these campaigns, and his unpopularity in Pittsburgh led him to spend most of his final years in Washington rather than his home town.

In the 1930s, the Roosevelt administration conducted several high-profile tax evasion prosecutions against individuals such as Thomas W. Lamont and Jimmy Walker. In response to accusations levied by Republican Congressman Louis Thomas McFadden of Pennsylvania in early 1933, Attorney General Homer Cummings began an inquiry into Mellon&#x27;s tax history. Between February 1935 and May 1936, the Board of Tax Appeals heard a widely covered case in which the federal government accused Mellon of tax fraud. During the proceedings, Mellon divulged numerous details of his business career that had previously been unknown to the public.

Mellon was diagnosed with cancer in November 1936. His health declined in 1937, and he died on August 26, 1937. Newspapers across the country took note of his death. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr. stated that Mellon had lived through &quot;an epoch in the economic history of the nation, and his passing takes one of the most important industrial and financial figures of our time.&quot; Months after Mellon&#x27;s death, the Board of Tax Appeals handed down a ruling exonerating Mellon of all tax fraud charges.

==Personal life==

In the early 1880s, Mellon had a serious relationship with Fannie Larimer Jones, but he broke off the relationship after learning that she was suffering from tuberculosis. After this experience, Mellon refrained from courting women for several years. In 1898, while traveling with Frick and Frick&#x27;s wife to Europe, Mellon met Nora McMullen, a nineteen-year-old Englishwoman of Ulster Scots ancestry. Mellon visited McMullen&#x27;s home of Hertford Castle in 1898 and 1899, and, after a period of courtship, the couple married in 1900. Nora gave birth to a daughter, Ailsa, in 1901. Nora disliked living in Pittsburgh, and she was unhappy in her marriage. By the end of 1903, she had begun an affair with Alfred George Curphey, who would also later be involved with the wife of George Vivian, 4th Baron Vivian. Mellon and Nora eventually reconciled, and in 1907 she gave birth to a son, Paul. The reconciliation proved short-lived, as Nora took up with Curphey again in 1908 and requested a divorce the following year. To avoid a public scandal, Andrew reluctantly agreed to a separation in 1909. Seeking to hold divorce proceedings privately before a judge rather than publicly before a jury, in 1911 Mellon convinced the Pennsylvania legislature to amend a law that had required a jury trial in divorce proceedings. In response, Nora attacked Mellon in the press, and the divorce proceedings were widely covered by the media. Nora went so far to contest the divorce that she made an appeal to King George of England and parliament. In 1912, Mellon and Nora finally agreed on a divorce settlement, largely on Mellon&#x27;s terms.

Mellon did not remarry. Nora lived in Pittsburgh for several years before eventually settling in the Hudson Valley, and the two children alternated living with either parent. In 1923, Nora married Harvey Arthur Lee, a British-born antiques dealer 14 years her junior. Two years after the Lees&#x27; divorce in 1928, Nora Lee resumed the surname Mellon, at the request of her son, Paul. In the 1920s, while Mellon served as Secretary of the Treasury, Ailsa was courted by several influential men, including Otto Christian Archibald von Bismarck, Robert Horne, and Gelasio Caetani. In 1926, in the &quot;greatest society event that the nation&#x27;s capital had witnessed&quot; since before World War I, Ailsa married David K. E. Bruce, son of Democratic Senator William Cabell Bruce of Maryland. After attending Yale University and the University of Cambridge, Paul briefly worked at Mellon National Bank. He later settled in Virginia, becoming a well-known philanthropist. Mellon&#x27;s nephew, Richard King Mellon, succeeded Andrew as the head of the Mellon financial empire.

==Philanthropy and art collection==

Emulating his father, Mellon eschewed philanthropy for much of his life, but in the early 1900s, he began donating to local organizations such as the YMCA. Mellon committed to his first large-scale act of philanthropy in 1913, when he and his brother, Richard, established the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research as a department of the University of Pittsburgh. In 1967, the institute merged with the Carnegie Institute of Technology to form Carnegie Mellon University. Mellon also served as an alumni president and trustee of the University of Pittsburgh, and made several major donations to the school, including the land on which the Cathedral of Learning and Heinz Chapel were constructed. In total it is estimated that Mellon donated over $43 million to the University of Pittsburgh.

Encouraged by Frick and guided by Charles Carstairs, Mellon began collecting art in the mid-to-late 1890s. Over the ensuing decades, his art collection continued to grow as he purchased pieces from Knoedler and Joseph Duveen, and during the 1920s his collection was generally considered to be one of the finest art collections in Washington. In the early 1930s, he purchased, according to Cannadine, just under half of the &quot;greatest paintings&quot; from the Soviet Union&#x27;s Hermitage Museum in the Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings. Twenty-one paintings, of the highest quality, were later given to the National Gallery of Art.

Mellon decided to use his fortune and art collection to establish a national art museum in Washington modeled after the National Gallery in London. In 1936, Mellon presented President Roosevelt with an offer to establish a national art museum to which Mellon would donate his art collection as well as an endowment, while the federal government would pay for the institution&#x27;s upkeep. He conditioned the offer on the establishment of a board of trustees, a majority of whom would be chosen by Mellon. Despite the ongoing tax case against Mellon, the Roosevelt administration accepted the offer, and Congress passed legislation authorizing the construction of the National Gallery of Art on Mellon&#x27;s terms. The National Gallery of Art opened in 1941 and continues to operate. Mellon&#x27;s friend and former employee, David E. Finley Jr., would later preside over the establishment of the National Portrait Gallery, which also hosts several paintings donated by Mellon.

Mellon was initiated to the Scottish Rite Freemasonry, till he raised the 33rd and highest degree.

==Legacy==
===Memorials===

The Andrew W. Mellon Memorial Fountain in Washington was created by Sidney Waugh and was dedicated in May 1952 by Harry S. Truman. Washington, D.C., also hosts the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium and the Andrew Mellon Building. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the product of the merger of the Avalon Foundation and the Old Dominion Foundation (set up separately by his children), is named in his honor, as is the 378-foot US Coast Guard Cutter &quot;Mellon (WHEC-717)&quot;.

===In popular culture===
Andrew W. Mellon appears in the HBO drama series &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;, in the fifth, eighth and twelfth episodes of the third season, in his capacity as Secretary of the Treasury. His character is played by Carnegie Mellon alumnus James Cromwell.

In the alternate history/time travel story &quot;A Slip in Time&quot; by S. M. Stirling, featuring a history in which the First World War was avoided and the Austro-Hungarian Empire survived, Andrew Mellon was the President of the United States in 1926.

Mellon is the subject of three unflattering chapters in Matt Stoller&#x27;s 2019 book, &quot;Goliath: The 100 Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy&quot;, which recounts efforts by populists in Washington (namely, Congressman Wright Patman; Roosevelt administration lawyer Robert H. Jackson; and Ferdinand Pecora, attorney for the Senate Banking Committee) to expose Mellon&#x27;s crimes and abuse of power for personal gain.

<doc id="161547" wikidata="Q191789" url="?curid=161547" title="Martha Washington">
<text>Martha Dandridge Custis Washington (June 2, 1731 O.S. – May 22, 1802) was the wife of George Washington, who was the first president of the United States. Although the title was not coined until after her death, she served as the inaugural first lady of the United States, defining the role of the president&#x27;s wife and setting many precedents that future first ladies observed. During her tenure, she was referred to as &quot;Lady Washington&quot;. Washington is consistently ranked in the upper half of first ladies by historians.

Martha Dandridge married Daniel Parke Custis on May 15, 1750, and the couple had four children, only one of whom survived to adulthood. She was widowed in 1757 at the age of 26, inheriting a large estate. She was remarried to George Washington in 1759, moving to his plantation, Mount Vernon. Her youngest daughter died of epilepsy in 1773, and the Washingtons were unable to conceive any children of their own. Washington became a symbol of the American Revolution after her husband was appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. During the war, she played a maternal role, visiting encampments when fighting stalled each winter. Her only surviving child, John Parke Custis, died from a camp illness during the war. After the war ended in 1783, she sought retirement at Mount Vernon, but returned to public life when her husband became president of the United States in 1789.

Washington took on the social role of the president&#x27;s wife reluctantly, becoming a national celebrity in the process. She found this life unpleasant, feeling that she was restricted and wishing for retirement. In addition to hosting weekly social events, Washington understood that how she composed herself would reflect on the nation, both domestically and abroad. As such, she struck a careful balance between the dignity associated with a head of state&#x27;s wife and the humility associated with republican government. The Washingtons returned to Mount Vernon in 1797, and she spent her retirement years greeting admirers and advising her successors. She was widowed for a second time in 1799, and she died two-and-a-half years later in 1802.

==Early life (1731–1748)==
Martha Dandridge was born on June 2, 1731, on her parents&#x27; tobacco plantation, Chestnut Grove Plantation in New Kent County the Colony of Virginia. She was the oldest daughter of Frances Jones, the granddaughter of an Anglican rector, and John Dandridge, a Virginia planter and county clerk who emigrated from England. She had three brothers and four sisters: John (1733–1749), William (1734–1776), Bartholomew (1737–1785), Anna Maria &quot;Fanny&quot; Bassett (1739–1777), Frances Dandridge (1744–1757), Elizabeth Aylett Henley (1749–1800), and Mary Dandridge (1756–1763). As the oldest of eight, including one sister that was 25 years her junior, Dandridge played a maternal and domestic role beginning early in life. Dandridge may have also had an illegitimate half-sister born into slavery, Ann Dandridge Costin, and an illegitimate white half-brother, Ralph Dandridge. 

Dandridge&#x27;s father was well connected with the Virginia aristocracy despite his relative lack of wealth, and she was taught to behave as a woman of the upper class. She received a relatively high quality education for the daughter of a planter, though it was still inferior to that of her brothers. She took to equestrianism, at one point riding her horse up and down the stairs of her uncle&#x27;s home and escaping chastisement because her father was so impressed by her skill.

==Marriage to Daniel Parke Custis (1749–1757)==
In 1749, Dandridge met Daniel Parke Custis, the son of a wealthy planter in Virginia. They wished to marry, but the father of Dandridge&#x27;s prospective groom, John Custis, was highly selective of what woman would marry into the family&#x27;s fortune. She eventually won his approval, and Dandridge married Custis, who was two decades her senior, on May 15, 1750. After they were married, Custis moved with her husband to his residence at White House Plantation on the Pamunkey River. Here they had four children: Daniel, born 1751; Frances, born 1753; John, born 1754; and Martha, born 1756. Daniel died in 1754 and Frances died in 1757. Daniel Parke Custis was one of the wealthiest men in the Virginia colony as well as one of the largest slaveowners, owning nearly 300 slaves.

Custis became a widow at the age of 26 when her husband died (possibly from a severe infection of the throat). Upon his death, she inherited the large estate that he had previously inherited from his father. After his death in 1757, she received one third of his estate outright, and the remaining two thirds were granted to their two young children. The total inheritance amounted to approximately $33,000 (), 17,000 acres of land, and hundreds of slaves. The legal and financial matters of the inheritance presented a considerable burden on Custis while she was raising her two surviving children and grieving the losses of her husband, two children, and her father. She was also left with the responsibility of managing the farmland and overseeing the well-being of the slaves. According to her biographer, &quot;she capably ran the five plantations left to her when her first husband died, bargaining with London merchants for the best tobacco prices&quot;.

==Marriage to George Washington (1758–1774)==
=== Courtship and wedding ===

By one account Custis met George Washington during the Williamsburg social season, and they courted over the following months during his leaves from the military. By another, they were introduced by Colonel Chamberlayne, a mutual acquaintance, when they both stayed the night at his home in May 1758. They married on January 6, 1759, at the White House plantation.

The couple honeymooned at the Custis family&#x27;s White House plantation, followed by a stay in Williamsburg where her husband was a representative in the House of Burgesses before setting up house at his Mount Vernon estate. At the time of their wedding, she was one of the wealthiest widows in the Thirteen Colonies. Their marriage remained happy over the following 40 years, in part because of their similar worldviews. It was a marriage based in mutual respect and shared habits, with both maintaining similar schedules in day-to-day life and both prioritizing family and image over excitement and vice.

=== Mount Vernon ===
From 1759 to 1775, the Washingtons lived at Mount Vernon where they tended to their plantation. Washington ran the household and regularly entertained visitors. She knitted and oversaw the making of clothes, and she became talented in curing meat in their smokehouse. Washington entertained almost daily, having visitors for dinner or for longer stays as the family became more prominent in the political and social life of Virginia. Washington&#x27;s husband used her wealth to expand their home at Mount Vernon and turn it into a profitable estate.

The Washingtons had no children together, but they raised Martha&#x27;s two surviving children. She was highly protective of them, especially after her two previous children had died and Patsy was found to have epilepsy. In 1773, Patsy died when she was 17 during an epileptic seizure. Washington&#x27;s last surviving child, John, left King&#x27;s College that fall and married Eleanor Calvert in February 1774. The Washingtons hoped for more children throughout their marriage, but they were unable to conceive.

== American Revolution (1775–1789) ==
=== Early revolution ===

Life for the Washingtons was interrupted as the American Revolution escalated in the 1770s. Though rumors were spread that she was a Loyalist, Washington consistently shared her husband&#x27;s political beliefs. She strongly supported his role in the Patriot movement and his work to advance his beliefs in the cause. She stayed at Mount Vernon when he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in 1775, overseeing the construction of new wings to their home. She then moved to the home of her brother-in-law so as not to be so conspicuous a target during the American Revolutionary War.

The revolution was the first time in their marriage that they were apart for an extended period. In the fall of 1775, Washington traveled to Massachusetts to meet with her husband. On the journey north, she experienced her newfound celebrity status for the first time as the wife of a famed general. She joined him in Cambridge, from where he and the other Continental Army officers were operating. While staying in Cambridge, she served as a hostess for guests of the officers. She would also sew clothes for the soldiers while at camp, encouraging other officers&#x27; wives to do the same, leading to the creation of a sewing circle that contributed to the war effort. Though she hid it from those around her, Washington was frightened by the gunfire that could be heard from the nearby Siege of Boston. She accompanied her husband when operations were relocated to New York, but she was sent to Philadelphia as British forces came closer. Each spring, when conflict resumed, she returned to Mount Vernon.

=== Independent United States ===
The American Revolution became increasingly stressful for Martha after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, as George faced increased risks on the battlefield. Each winter, Washington would join her husband at his encampment while fighting was stalled. The quality of her housing varied during these visits, both in comfort and in safety. General Lafayette observed that she loved &quot;her husband madly&quot;. Washington was kept informed of the war&#x27;s developments by her husband, sometimes performing clerical work for him, and she was even permitted to know military secrets. She became a symbol of the war effort, alongside George Washington, as a grandmotherly figure that cared for the soldiers.

The Continental Army settled in Valley Forge, the third of the eight winter encampments of the Revolution, on December 19, 1777. Washington traveled 10 days and hundreds of miles to join her husband in Pennsylvania. On April 6, Elizabeth Drinker and three friends arrived at Valley Forge to plead with the General to release their husbands from jail; the men, all Quakers, had refused to swear a loyalty oath to the American revolutionaries. Because the commander was not available at first, the women visited with Martha. Drinker described her later in her diary as &quot;a sociable pretty kind of Woman&quot;.

Washington&#x27;s son John was serving as a civilian aide to his father during the siege of Yorktown in 1781 when he died of &quot;camp fever&quot;, a diagnosis for epidemic typhus. After his death, she and George took in the youngest two of John&#x27;s four children, Eleanor (Nelly) Parke Custis and George Washington Parke (Washy) Custis. The Washingtons also provided personal and financial support to the children of many of their relatives and friends.

=== Postwar retirement ===
The Washingtons returned to Mount Vernon in 1783. They stayed at Mount Vernon for much of the Confederation period, living in retirement with their nephew, nieces, and grandchildren. Washington, now in poorer health, believed that her husband was finished with public service. She spent her time raising their grandchildren, constantly worried for their health after having all four of her children and many other relatives die of illness. She also resumed hosting company at Mount Vernon, recruiting several of her nieces and other young women to assist her, as the house was overwhelmed with visitors. Their life at Mount Vernon was interrupted again when he was asked to participate at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 and again when he was chosen as the first president of the United States in 1789.

==First lady of the United States (1789–1797)==

After the war, Washington was not fully supportive of her husband&#x27;s agreeing to be president of the newly formed United States. She did not immediately join him at the capital in New York City, only arriving in May 1789. The journey was followed by the press, which was unprecedented in the attention that it paid to a woman&#x27;s actions, and the entourage was met with admirers and fanfare in each town that it passed through. It was during this journey that she gave her only public speech as first lady, thanking those that came to see her. She arrived on the presidential barge, escorted by her husband, immediately establishing the president&#x27;s wife as a public figure. After arriving at the capital, Washington became the inaugural first lady of the United States, though the term would not be used until later. Instead, she was referred to as &quot;Lady Washington&quot;.

As the inaugural first lady, many of Washington&#x27;s practices in the White House became traditions for future first ladies, including the opening of the White House to the public on New Year&#x27;s Day, a practice that would continue until the Hoover administration. She hosted many affairs of state at New York City and Philadelphia during their years as temporary capitals. Taking her responsibility as the lady of the house seriously, Washington returned the official calls of every lady that left her card at the heavily-trafficked presidential home to ensure that everyone could reach the president, always doing so within three days.

Washington was also tasked by her husband with the responsibility of hosting drawing room events on Fridays in which ladies were permitted to attend. She would remain seated during such events while the president greeted their guests. The guests were at first uncertain as to whether they should follow the royal custom of waiting for the hostess to leave before they do, and she resolved the issue by announcing her husband always retired at nine. She was careful during these events to avoid political talk, encouraging a change of subject when it came up. The social circles that developed among those in American politics at this time became known as the Republican Court.

=== Personal life ===
The first presidential residence was a house on Cherry Street, followed by a house on Broadway. The capital was moved to Philadelphia in 1790, and the presidential residence again moved, this time to a house on High Street (now Market Street). Washington much preferred the Philadelphia residence, as it had a greater social life and was closer to Mount Vernon. Early in her husband&#x27;s presidency, she had little opportunity to go out, as any action she took would have political implications. After their move to Philadelphia, the Washingtons loosened their self-imposed limits on personal activity. While serving as first lady, Washington became close to Polly Lear, the wife of her husband&#x27;s secretary Tobias Lear. She also associated with Lucy Flucker Knox, wife of war secretary Henry Knox, and Abigail Adams, the second lady. The time she spent with her grandchildren was another high point for Washington, who would sometimes take them to shows and museums. She also made a point of frequently attending church, owing to her firm Episcopalian beliefs.

Washington was forced to take control of the presidential residence at one point shortly after her husband&#x27;s presidency began, forbidding guests from entering, as he was undergoing the removal of a tumor. In July 1790, artist John Trumbull gave Washington a full-length portrait painting of her husband as a gift. It was displayed in their home at Mount Vernon in the New Room. When Washington learned that her husband might take on a second term as president, she uncharacteristically protested against the decision. Despite her opposition, he was reelected in 1793, and she reluctantly accepted four more years as the wife of the president. The young Georges Washington de La Fayette joined the Washington family in 1795 while his father, Marquis de Lafayette, was held as a political prisoner in France. He would live with the Washingtons until fall of 1797. In 1796, Washington&#x27;s slave and personal maid Oney Judge escaped and fled to New Hampshire. Despite Washington&#x27;s insistence to her husband that Judge should be returned and again should be Washington&#x27;s slave, the president did not attempt to pursue Judge. Washington&#x27;s tenure as first lady ended in 1797.

=== Public image ===

As the wife of both the head of government and the head of state, Washington was immediately faced with the pressure of representing the United States. She had to present the United States as a dignified nation to establish credibility among the countries of Europe, but she also had to respect the spirit of democracy by refusing to present herself as a queen. She was also aware that the precedent she set would be inherited by future presidential wives. Washington balanced these responsibilities by playing the role of a social hostess at presidential events, a role that would become the primary function of the first lady. In turn, this made the position of first lady an important point of contact between the president and the people.

Washington presented an image of herself as an amiable wife, but privately she complained about the restrictions placed on her life. She found the pageantry of the presidency to be boring and artificial. Washington was not exempt from the political attacks often levied at her husband&#x27;s administration by opposition-owned newspapers. While her social role was celebrated by her husband&#x27;s supporters, the anti-Federalists criticized her as emulating royalty and encouraging aristocracy. At the same time, other critics accused her social activities of being too informal. To her displeasure, she found that she was constantly the subject of public attention, and she was forced to pay increased attention to her hair and clothes each day. Despite this, she still opted to dress simply in homespun clothes, feeling that it was more appropriate in a republic.

==Later life and death (1797–1802)==

The Washingtons left the capital immediately after the inauguration of John Adams, making the return journey to Mount Vernon, which by then had begun to decay. Again they went into retirement, and they saw to several renovations for their home. In the years after the presidency, the Washingtons received more visitors than ever, from friends and strangers alike. They eventually took in one of the former president&#x27;s nephews, Lawrence Lewis, to serve as secretary, and he would eventually marry Washington&#x27;s granddaughter Nelly.

Washington feared that her husband would again be called away to lead a provisional army against France, but no such conflict took place.
Her husband died of a severe throat infection on December 14, 1799, at the age of 67. As a widow, Washington spent her final years living in a garret where she knitted, sewed, and responded to letters. Though she was the legal owner of her husband&#x27;s property, she gave control of its business affairs to her relatives. She also inherited her husband&#x27;s slaves on the condition that they be freed upon her death. Fearing that these slaves might hurt her, she freed them. She did not have the authority to free her dower slaves, and she chose not to free the one slave, Elish, whom she personally owned.

Washington retained an interest in the presidency after her tenure as first lady, beginning the tradition of advising her successors. The Washington family long disliked Thomas Jefferson and Jeffersonian politics, in part because of the central role he played in criticizing the Washington administration. Washington took offense when Jefferson became president, as she felt that he did not give adequate respect to the office. 
Washington&#x27;s health, always somewhat precarious, declined after her husband&#x27;s death. She had anticipated her death since that of her husband. When she developed a fever in 1802, she burned all of her husband&#x27;s letters to her, summoned a clergyman to administer last communion, and chose her funeral dress. Two and a half years after the death of her husband, Washington died on May 22, 1802, at the age of 70. Following her death, Washington&#x27;s body was interred in the original Washington family tomb vault at Mount Vernon. In 1831, the surviving executors of George&#x27;s estate removed the bodies of the Washingtons from the old vault to a similar structure within the present enclosure at Mount Vernon.

== Legacy ==
Just as her husband had set the precedent for the presidency, Washington established what would eventually become the role of first lady. She was prominent in the ceremonial aspects of the presidency, assisting her husband in his role as head of state, but she had very little public involvement in his administrative role as head of government. This would be the standard of presidential wives for the next century. Washington was recognized for her humility and her mild-mannered nature, to the point that her contemporaries were often taken by surprise when meeting her. No personal records of Washington exist from before the death of her first husband, and she destroyed many letters that she had written since then. Many recipients of her letters kept them, however, and those letters have been preserved in archives such as at Mount Vernon and the Virginia Historical Society. Several collections of these letters have been published.

=== Honors ===
During the Revolutionary War, one of the regiments at Valley Forge named themselves &quot;Lady Washington&#x27;s Dragoon&quot; in her honor.The Martha Washington College for Women was founded in Abingdon, Virginia in 1860. It was merged with Emory &amp; Henry College in 1918, and the main original building of Martha Washington College was converted to the Martha Washington Inn. Martha Washington Seminary, a finishing school for young women in Washington, DC, was opened in 1905, and it ceased operations in 1949.

A postage stamp featuring Martha Washington, the first stamp to honor an American woman, was issued as part of the 1902 stamp series. An stamp, it was printed in violet-black ink. The second stamp issued in her honor, a definitive stamp printed in yellow-brown ink, was released in 1923. A stamp was issued in 1938 to honor Washington as part of the Presidential Issue series. Washington&#x27;s image was featured on the one dollar silver certificate banknote beginning in 1886, making her the second woman to appear on an American banknote after Pocahontas. To prevent confusion with existing coinage, pattern coins testing new metals have been produced by the U.S. mint, or a company contracted to it, with Martha Washington on the obverse.

=== Historian assessments ===
Since 1982 Siena College Research Institute has periodically conducted surveys asking historians to assess American first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. Consistently, Washington has been ranked in the upper-half of first ladies by historians in these surveys. In terms of cumulative assessment, Washington has been ranked:
*9th-best of 42 in 1982
*12th-best of 37 in 1993
*13th-best of 38 in 2003
*9th-best of 38 in 2008
*9th-best of 39 in 2014

In the 2008 Siena Research Institute survey, Washington was ranked 3rd-highest in the criteria of public image. In the 2014 survey, Washington and her husband were ranked the 2nd-highest out of 39 first couples in terms of being a &quot;power couple&quot;.

<text>Aysheaia is an extinct genus of soft-bodied lobopodian, known from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of British Columbia, Canada

== Anatomy ==

&quot;Aysheaia&quot; has ten body segments, each of which has a pair of spiked, annulate legs. The animal is segmented, and looks somewhat like a bloated caterpillar with a few spines added on — including six finger-like projections around the mouth and two grasping limbs on the &quot;head&quot;. Each leg has a subterminal row of about six curved claws. No jaw apparatus is evident. A pair of legs marks the posterior end of the body, unlike in onychophorans where the anus projects posteriad; this may be an adaptation to the terrestrial habit.

==Ecology==
Some specimens of &quot;Aysheaia&quot; have been found associated with sponges, though this does not provide direct evidence of diet.

==Affinity==
&quot;Aysheaia&quot; is a lobopodian, an extinct phylum of marine animals that are similar to modern terrestrial Onychophora (velvet worms). Notable differences are the lack of jaws and antennae, possible lack of visual organs, and the terminal mouth.

==Distribution==
&quot;Aysheaia&quot; is known from fossils found in the middle Cambrian Burgess shale of British Columbia. Similar taxa are known from the lower Cambrian Maotianshan shales of China. Other than the 20 specimens from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they comprise 2% of the community, only 19 specimens of &quot;A. pedunculata&quot; are known. &quot;A. prolata&quot; was described as a separate species from the similarly-aged Wheeler Shale Formation of Utah but in fact represents the frontal appendage of a &quot;Stanleycaris&quot;-like radiodont.

==History of research==
=== Description by Walcott (1911) ===
Aysheaia was described by Walcott in his 1911 work on annelid worms; Walcott imagined that a head (not observed) was present to support a polychaete affinity. His attention was soon drawn to the organism&#x27;s resemblance to velvet worms, which was supported by other early researchers (1920s-30s) who also recognized a similarity with the onychophora, although because Aysheaia does not fall within the range of living onychophora, it has also been allocated to a phylum of its own. Nevertheless, an Onychophoran affinity represented the common opinion until the fossil was redescribed in the late 1970s.

=== Major redescription by Whittington, 1978===
In the 1970s, Whittington undertook a thorough redescription, and associated Aysheaia with the tardigrade lineage concept promoted a couple of years earlier by Delle Cave and Simonetta, and first proposed in 1958. Thus, his interpretation places Aysheaia in the stem group to Tardigrada + Onychophora, although the view at the time was that these two modern phyla represented a group within a polyphyletic Arthropoda. A possible link to &quot;Xenusion&quot; was also brought up, although at this time the affinities of this group were unclear, and a link to the rangeomorphs had been proposed.

=== Response to Whittington (1980s)===
The response to Whittington&#x27;s redescription can be loosely classed into three camps: one school, predominantly Bergström, downplayed the similarities to the Onychophora and focussed on the Tardigrade interpretation; whereas others (after Simonetta and Delle Cave) recognized a group of lobopods containing Onychophora, Tardigrada, and &quot;Aysheaia&quot; (with features of both). Robison preferred to interpret Onychophora as the sister group to Arthropoda, and placed &quot;Aysheaia&quot; in the Onychophoran stem group in a taxon called Protonychophora (solely containing &quot;Aysheaia&quot;). These were differentiated from Euonychophora (the crown group) by the number of lobopod legs and claws, the unusual head appendages, the absence of eyes, jaws, antennae and slime glands, the morphology of the rear of the body, and the terminal mouth.

=== Modern era ===

Later work uncovered further material of &quot;Xenusion&quot; and relatives, particularly from the Chinese fossil deposits. In light of the cladistic revolution of the 1990s, &quot;Aysheaia&quot; and its relatives were recognized as early offshoots of the lineage leading to arthropods and onychophorans.

Looking from the opposite direction, Budd points out that there are no characters that exclude &quot;Aysheaia&quot; from the Arthropoda. It may be premature to assign &quot;Aysheaia&quot; to the Onychophora over Arthropoda, as it lacks any distinctive features of the onychophoran crown group; rather, both Onychophora and Arthropoda may have arisen from animals resembling &quot;Aysheaia&quot; and its kin. Budd sees &quot;Aysheaia&quot;-like organisms as representing a paraphyletic grade from which both modern onychophoran and arthropods evolved. The specialised first appendage pair of &quot;Aysheaia&quot; may be the same as the frontal appendages of Dinocaridida, possibly placing it near this clade. 

===Etymology===
The genus name commemorates a mountain peak named &quot;Ayesha&quot; due north of the Wapta Glacier. This peak was originally named Aysha in the 1904 maps of the region, and was renamed Ayesha after the heroine of Rider Haggard&#x27;s 1887 novel &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="161560" wikidata="Q904189" url="?curid=161560" title="Knuckles the Echidna">
<text>is a character from Sega&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series. He is a red anthropomorphic short-beaked echidna who is Sonic&#x27;s secondary best friend and former rival. Determined and serious, but sometimes gullible, he fights his enemies using brute force and strength. His role is established as the guardian of the Master Emerald, a large gemstone which controls the series&#x27; integral Chaos Emeralds, and is the last living member of his tribe, the Knuckles Clan.

Knuckles debuted as one of the main antagonists in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; (1994); in &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;, he first became a playable character. In the games&#x27; story, Doctor Eggman tricks him into opposing Sonic and Tails. After antagonizing the duo, he forms a temporary alliance with them after learning of Eggman&#x27;s trickery. Since then, he has appeared in numerous playable and non-playable roles, as well as in several series of comic books, Western animated television, and Japanese anime, in addition to the feature films &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot;, he stars in the live action &quot;Knuckles&quot; television miniseries.

One of the series&#x27; most popular characters, Knuckles has appeared in most games in the franchise, including those for the main series and spin-offs. His likeness has been frequently utilized in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; merchandise, with the character also being subject to various Internet memes.

==Concept and creation==

During conception of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot;, the development team wanted to create a new rival for Sonic. The final design of Knuckles was the result of dozens of possible designs inspired by numerous different animals. In collaboration between the Sonic Team and Sega of America&#x27;s product marketing manager, Pamela Kelly, the final character of &quot;Knuckles&quot; was chosen. The emphasis of the character was to break walls, with the original idea being a &#x27;whirlwind&#x27; ability, rather than punching.

Knuckles was created by developer Takashi Yuda and Pamela Kelly who never intended him to be any more than a &quot;supporting character&quot;. Knuckles was introduced in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; as an &quot;intimidator&quot; because of his powerful abilities and physical strength. He was given a headlining role in the next game, &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;, where he made his first appearance as a playable character.

===Voice portrayal===

Knuckles has been voiced by several different actors over the years. In the Japanese dubs, he was voiced by Yasunori Matsumoto in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie&quot;
and by Nobutoshi Canna since 1998, beginning with &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;.

In animation, he was voiced by Brian Drummond in &quot;Sonic Underground&quot; and by Bill Wise in the English dub of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie&quot;.

In the video games, Knuckles was originally voiced by Michael McGaharn in &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, and then by Ryan Drummond in &quot;Sonic Shuffle&quot;. Scott Dreier began voicing the character in 2001, starting with &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;. He continued to voice the character for three more years until 2004, his final role as Knuckles was in &quot;Sonic Advance 3&quot;. Dan Green began voicing the character in the anime series &quot;Sonic X&quot;, he would later take over the role in the video games in 2005, starting with &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot;. In 2010, he was replaced by Travis Willingham, beginning with &quot;Sonic Free Riders&quot;. Willingham continued voicing the character until 2018, and his final role as Knuckles was in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;. Since 2019, Knuckles has been voiced by Dave B. Mitchell, beginning with &quot;Team Sonic Racing&quot;. In the live-action franchise, Knuckles is voiced by Idris Elba. In the 2022 Sonic short film, &quot;Sonic Drone Home&quot;, Knuckles is voiced by Fred Tatasciore. In the Netflix series &quot;Sonic Prime&quot;, Knuckles is voiced by Adam Nurada, while his Shatterverse counterparts (respectively named Renegade Knucks, Gnarly Knuckles, and Knuckles the Dread) are voiced by Vincent Tong.

==Characteristics==
Knuckles is a red anthropomorphic short-beaked echidna, the only living descendant of a well-established clan of echidnas. For many years, his clan guarded a giant gemstone called the Master Emerald, which controls the Chaos Emeralds, objects central to the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; game series. As such, Knuckles has spent most of his life atop a floating island called Angel Island, guarding the Master Emerald from harm. He has grown up fairly introverted as a result.

Knuckles has a personality described as cool. However, he sometimes loses his composure and gets in fights with other characters, and he can be shy around girls. His favorite food is grapes, and his relationship with Sonic is ambivalent. However, in later games, their relationship became more unequivocal: Knuckles entered the series as an antagonist of Sonic but later becomes one of the protagonists and sees him as a partner, while envying Sonic&#x27;s adventurous lifestyle. He is depicted as somewhat gullible and very rash, especially when angered. Since he never left Angel Island, he has often been tricked by Doctor Robotnik but is stated in one game manual to have become more skeptical of him, possibly due to the multiple times of getting fooled by Robotnik.

While slower than Sonic, Knuckles is depicted as one of the series&#x27;s strongest characters and a skilled martial artist: his brawny physique allows him to lift objects many times his size and weight, while his powerful fists enable him to smash boulders and break through solid ground. He can also glide long distances and climb up walls using the spikes of his gloves. Unlike Sonic, Knuckles is able to swim. As is typical among &quot;Sonic&quot; characters, Knuckles can roll into a ball to attack enemies. He also has an empowered &quot;super&quot; form: using the Chaos Emeralds allows him to transform into Super Knuckles. Using the Super Emeralds allows him to transform into Hyper Knuckles.

==Appearances==

===In video games===
Knuckles debuted in the 1994 Sega Genesis game &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot;. Knuckles joins the series&#x27;s primary antagonist Dr. Robotnik after being tricked into thinking that Sonic is attempting to steal the Master Emerald; Knuckles fights Sonic at several points throughout the game. Robotnik&#x27;s betrayal is revealed late in &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; when he steals the Master Emerald and attacks Knuckles, &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; is also the first game where he became a player character, his story takes place after &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Story&quot;. A similar plot follows in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog: Triple Trouble&quot;. While Knuckles&#x27;s canonical playable debut comes in &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;, he is playable in &quot;Sonic 2&quot; and &quot;3&quot; via the Genesis&#x27; lock-on technology. Knuckles starred in &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; for the Sega 32X, in which he serves as the guardian of an island amusement park and rescues his friends—collectively known as the Chaotix—from Robotnik in 1995. He teams up with them individually, creating an unusual gameplay style involving two characters being tethered together.

Eggman shatters the Master Emerald, thus freeing Chaos who appears before Knuckles, the pieces are scattered around, and Chaos flees in &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;. To restore the Emerald, thereby protecting Angel Island, he searches through various expansive levels for pieces. At one point, he defeats Chaos, and Eggman tricks Knuckles into thinking that Sonic is trying to collect Emerald shards for his own purposes. Knuckles finds Sonic holding two Chaos Emeralds he thinks are Master Emerald shards, and attacks him. This knocks them out of Sonic&#x27;s hands, so Eggman shows up to steal them and leaves. He initially stays on Earth to look for pieces while Sonic and Tails follow Eggman, but later joins them aboard Eggman&#x27;s airship, the Egg Carrier, after seeing a vision of there being more pieces on it. He finds the final pieces and is confronted by Chaos&#x27; final form, then returns to the Emerald&#x27;s island to restore it.

Early in &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;, Knuckles and Rouge argue over the Emerald; she wants the pieces for her personal collection. Eggman tries to steal it, so Knuckles shatters it aboard Eggman&#x27;s hovercraft, sending the pieces every which way, while also mentioning that if the shards are found they can be made whole. He spends the game recollecting the pieces like in &quot;Adventure&quot;. He later helps Sonic, Tails, and Amy find Eggman&#x27;s base inside a giant pyramid and a key to an inner chamber housing a giant Space Shuttle. He follows them to a giant space station called the ARK with it, where he again scuffles with Rouge over the Emerald. He saves her from falling into a constructed pit of lava; she decides the shards are worthless and dismissively lets him keep them, so he reassembles the Emerald and runs off. The antagonist Gerald Robotnik, Eggman&#x27;s grandfather, initiates a program to send the ARK on a collision course with Earth as revenge for an attack on the ARK decades earlier, so Knuckles teams up with the other playable characters to reroute it.

Knuckles serves as a power-based character in &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; alongside Sonic and Tails, who respectively represent speed and flight. They team up to defeat Eggman after receiving a letter saying that he will destroy the world in three days. However, it turns out that Eggman is being impersonated by Metal Sonic, whom all of the other characters defeat together. Knuckles helps Sonic, Tails, Amy Rose, and Cream the Rabbit stop Eggman from building an empire in the &quot;Sonic Advance&quot; trilogy. With the same team, Knuckles recurs in &quot;Sonic Riders&quot; and its two sequels; in each game, they participate in board-racing competitions together. In another team-based installment, the role-playing game &quot;Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood&quot;, Knuckles is a playable character with a major role in the story. The game begins with Tails informing Sonic that Knuckles has been kidnapped, so a team beginning as Sonic, Tails, Amy, and Rouge must rescue him. He is eventually saved, and it is revealed that the echidna race is still alive in the form of the helpful Shade the Echidna and her villainous tribe, the Nocturnus.

He is a minor character in &quot;Sonic Rush&quot;, where he accosts Blaze the Cat under the impression that she has stolen Chaos Emeralds. In the Nintendo DS version of &quot;Sonic Colors&quot;, Knuckles arrives at an amusement park Eggman has created after receiving a letter. Frustrated at having been tricked, he challenges Sonic to a race as a mission, but shortly learns that Rouge wrote the letter inviting him to the park. He has a short argument with Rouge. Modern Knuckles gives Classic and Modern Sonic missions and helpful advice in &quot;Sonic Generations&quot;. In &quot;Sonic Lost World&quot;, Knuckles and Amy look after forest animals while Sonic and Tails rescue the animals&#x27; friends. Later, the Deadly Six take control of one of Eggman&#x27;s machines to drain life from the world, and Amy and Knuckles die, but they are brought back to life when Sonic and Tails replenish it. He is a playable character in &quot;Sonic Mania Plus&quot;, regaining his role from the first games alongside Sonic, Tails, Mighty and Ray. He appears in the game &quot;Sonic Forces&quot;, where he becomes the leader of a resistance created to fight back against Eggman&#x27;s advancing forces. In &quot;Sonic Frontiers&quot;, Knuckles inadvertently arrives on the Starfall Islands while investigating some ruins on the Angel Island, once there he is captured by Sage. After Sonic releases his digital form who helps him search for the Chaos Emeralds, Knuckles notices that the ruins of Starfall Islands are similar to those on Angel Island, making him and Sonic wonder if the inhabitants of the islands resettled there after their arrival on the planet. After comparing the extinction of the Ancients and his own people reminds him that he is the last of his kind, Sonic encourages him to live his life to the fullest and not make the protection of the Master Emerald his sole purpose in life, with Knuckles deciding to heed his advice after he is free from Cyber space.

Knuckles has been a playable character in numerous spinoff games with little effect on the series&#x27;s plot, such as the fighting game &quot;Sonic the Fighters&quot;, the racing title &quot;Sonic R&quot;, and the party title &quot;Sonic Shuffle&quot;, as well as crossover games like &quot;Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games&quot; and &quot;Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed&quot;. He makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Sega Superstars Tennis&quot;, as a member of the audience in the Green Hill court and in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; Green Hill stage, where he, Tails, and Silver run through the vertical loop in the background. Knuckles appears as one of four playable characters in the action-adventure spin-off property &quot;Sonic Boom&quot; (&quot;Rise of Lyric&quot; and &quot;Shattered Crystal&quot;). In &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;, Knuckles appears as a non-playable character in the Sonic the Hedgehog world, in which he requests the player to assist him in a sidequest to take down some of Eggman&#x27;s robots, during which he makes a number of references to the rap songs about him in the &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; games. Knuckles also makes a cameo as an easter egg in &quot;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided&quot; on the box of a video game entitled &quot;Knuckles the Echidna in Knuckles &amp; Knuckles &amp; Knuckles&quot; which stems off of a running joke regarding the &quot;&amp; Knuckles&quot; part of the title card when Sonic 3 is locked on to the Sonic and Knuckles cartridge. In &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, Knuckles appears as an assist trophy that attacks players when summoned; he also appears as a spirit.

Knuckles appears as an unlockable playable character in &quot;Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&quot;.

===In comics===
In &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot;, Knuckles plays a similar role to that of the games. When the Death Egg crashes on Angel Island, Knuckles is briefly tricked by Dr. Robotnik and thus allows Robotnik to place his robot armies on the island and construct a base to repair his Death Egg. Knuckles also assists him in fighting Sonic and stealing Sonic&#x27;s own six Emeralds so they can be combined with Knuckles&#x27;s into one set of Emeralds. However, Knuckles does not trust Robotnik enough to tell him that he possesses a seventh Emerald that can control the others, and when Robotnik tries to absorb the Emeralds&#x27; power into himself, Knuckles uses this Emerald to defeat him. From that point on, he works as an ally against Robotnik, starting by removing all traces of the doctor&#x27;s influences from Angel Island.

In the comic series of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; published by Archie Comics, Knuckles is the eighteenth guardian of the Floating Island, which is also called Angel Island. He is also a member of the Brotherhood of Guardians, a secret society that defends the island and is made up of Knuckles&#x27;s predecessors/ancestors. In keeping with the incorporation of elements of the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; cartoon into the series, Knuckles lives on the planet Mobius. Knuckles is supported in his efforts by the Chaotix, and often works together with Sonic the Hedgehog and the Freedom Fighters.

===In animation===
Knuckles&#x27;s animation debut came with the 1996 Japanese &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; OVA. Sonic and Tails meet him during their trip into the Land of Darkness, and over the course of the film he helps them defeat Black Eggman/Metal Robotnik and Hyper Metal Sonic, two robots created by Eggman/Robotnik. As Metal is about to descend into a lava pit, Sonic attempts to save him after all, but Knuckles holds him back and Sonic is disappointed. Knuckles play-fights with Sonic a few times in the film as well.

Knuckles is a minor character in &quot;Sonic Underground&quot;. Sonic, Sonia, and Manic meet Knuckles atop his home, the Floating Island while searching for their mother. Knuckles is initially skeptical of them but soon accepts their help in protecting the Island and its guardian Chaos Emerald from villains Sleet and Dingo. Later on, the siblings recruit Knuckles to help them deactivate Doctor Robotnik&#x27;s giant fortress, as it is powered by Emeralds and he can control them. They succeed, but Sleet and Dingo accidentally break the Emerald, unleashing gradually effective but massive energy upon the planet Mobius, and Knuckles enlists one of his relatives to help them control it, with mediocre results. Reluctantly, Knuckles cuts a deal with Robotnik to turn over the hedgehogs in exchange for setting Mobius right; Robotnik succeeds and starts turning the hedgehogs into robots, but Knuckles betrays Robotnik to rescue his friends.

Knuckles appears in all three seasons of &quot;Sonic X&quot;, where he is depicted as the guardian of the Master Emerald, and is said to have a &quot;chip on his shoulder&quot;. The Sonic X version of Knuckles has been described as an &quot;incredibly serious warrior with a deep, fleshed-out backstory&quot; in comparison to the more comedic depictions of the character in recent years. After being stranded in the new world with Sonic, his only desire is to get back home quickly. He spends most of the first season traveling alone, but as the series continues he begins to travel with Sonic and the others more often, as well as befriending other characters. After returning home for the third season, he joins Sonic on the spaceship, &quot;Blue Typhoon&quot;, which is captained by Tails after their planet was invaded by the Metarex.

Knuckles is among the main cast in the &quot;Sonic Boom&quot; animated series, and had been redesigned for it: now being taller and more muscular than before. As a somewhat exaggerated reference to his mainstream counterpart&#x27;s easily deceived personality (as well as being based on the stereotypical team muscles), Knuckles is also portrayed as being somewhat slow-witted and goofy in this series.

Knuckles appears as a supporting character in &quot;Sonic Prime&quot;. After Sonic shatters the Paradox Prism, which results in the creation of multiple parallel dimensions at the expense of his own, multiple versions of Knuckles are made as well; such as Renegade Knucks who is a rebel against the Chaos Council of New Yoke City, the feral and paranoid Gnarly, and the pirate captain Knuckles the Dread. Knuckles is voiced by Adam Nurada and his variants are voiced by Vincent Tong.

===In other media===
While Knuckles does not appear in the Sonic series&#x27;s first theatrical film, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, his existence is alluded to within the film&#x27;s opening sequence in which a young Sonic and his caretaker Longclaw are attacked by a native clan of Echidnas. Co-writer Pat Casey has since stated that they are Echidnas within Sonic&#x27;s world, thus confirming Knuckles&#x27;s species does exist within that film&#x27;s universe. Casey also hinted that a connection between the first film&#x27;s Echidna tribe and Knuckles could be explored in the film&#x27;s sequel.

Knuckles appears alongside Sonic and Tails in the second film, voiced by Idris Elba. In the film, it is revealed he is the last of the Echidna Tribe, as the rest of his kind went extinct due to a war between them and the owls, and has a grudge against Sonic since he was Longclaw&#x27;s apprentice. After being informed of Sonic&#x27;s location by Dr. Robotnik, he teams up with the scientist and travels to Earth to defeat Sonic and seek out the Master Emerald to honor his ancestors. At the temple where the Emerald is located, Robotnik betrays Knuckles and leaves him to die, but he is rescued by Sonic. He teams up with Sonic and Tails to defeat Robotnik in Green Hills and reclaims the Master Emerald. The three agree to safeguard the Emerald as they live with Sonic&#x27;s adoptive Earth family, the Wachowskis.

Knuckles is the primary protagonist of a spinoff miniseries of the same name released on Paramount+, with Elba reprising the role. In the miniseries, Knuckles (who is struggling to adjust to his new life and home on Earth) takes deputy sheriff Wade Whipple in as his &quot;apprentice&quot;, training him in the ways of the Echidna warrior to help him prepare for a bowling tournament in Reno, Nevada where his estranged father will be competing. During their journey, Wade is reunited with his mother and sister, while Knuckles is pursued by &quot;the Buyer&quot;, Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s former operative who seeks to take Knuckles&#x27;s power for himself.

==Reception and impact==
The character has received positive attention. According to IGN&#x27;s Levi Buchanan, fans &quot;seemed legitimately happy&quot; with the addition of the character of Knuckles, who was popular enough to get marquee billing in &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;, but Buchanan felt that characters who came after him were going &quot;overboard&quot;. IGN&#x27;s Colin Moriarty singled out the introduction of both Knuckles and Tails as when the series became &quot;iffy&quot; and listed them and all other characters in the series, sans Sonic and Robotnik, as being 2nd most in need to &quot;die&quot; on his top 10 list. In contrast, he was listed as the best &quot;Sonic&quot; character by &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; based on the impact he brought to the &quot;Sonic&quot; games in which he first appeared. Similarly, &quot;Complex&quot; writer Elijah Watson considers him a better character than Sonic. Watson praises his debut in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot;, and adds &quot;Knuckles could have never been Sega&#x27;s mascot; the echidna lacks the sociability of Sonic and his Nintendo counterpart, Mario. And yet this defining characteristic is what makes him so appealing. He is Sega&#x27;s anti-hero: the dreadlocked brawler who is surprisingly selfless and has a soft spot for grapes and adorable animals.&quot;

According to official Sonic Team polls, Knuckles is the fourth most popular character in the series, following behind Tails, Shadow, and Sonic. Elton Jones from &quot;Complex&quot; listed Knuckles as his eleventh most wanted character in the next &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; game. Ravi Sinha of &quot;GamingBolt&quot; named Knuckles&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Sonic Boom&quot; as one of their &quot;Worst Video Game Character Design&quot;, stating that &quot;For as annoying as Sonic’s rework was in Sonic Boom, Knuckles was way more baffling. Even worse is that his character is little more than a “dumb jock,” with oddly intellectual viewpoints in the animated series because it&#x27;s randomly funny or something.&quot;

&quot;Mega Zone&quot;″s review of &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; praised the introduction of a new protagonist, whom it deemed &quot;rougher and tougher&quot; in comparison to the &quot;spineless&quot; Sonic. &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; called Knuckles&#x27;s powers &quot;impressive&quot; and the character overall more useful and promising than Tails. &quot;Sega Magazine&quot; stated that Knuckles &quot;looks cooler&quot; than Sonic, comparing him to Spider-Man, and suggested he be given his own game. &quot;Sega Magazine&quot; later called him &quot;groovy&quot; and &quot;ace&quot;, concluding that they &quot;love him.&quot; Knuckles&#x27;s characterization in &quot;Sonic Boom&quot; earned praise from &quot;Polygon&quot; due to how &quot;progressive&quot; he is when mentioning feminism much to the shock of the characters.

Kenneth Shepard from &quot;Kotaku&quot; felt Knuckles did not have enough screentime in his Paramount+ show, and observed &quot;Elba is providing voice work for roughly 76 minutes and 47 seconds of a 172-minute-long season. Those are just scenes Knuckles is in, not accounting for whether or not he’s actually contributing to the scene in a meaningful way.&quot; Rendy Jones at &quot;RogerEbert.com&quot; praised his characterization in the show, noting the character &quot;diverting his muscle-head dim-witted traits into a confident and jovial guy with a heart of gold—an echidna himbo, if you will.&quot;

===Ugandan Knuckles===

In late December 2017, players began to flood the virtual reality video game &quot;VRChat&quot; with avatars depicting a deformed version of the character called &quot;Ugandan Knuckles&quot;. The character stemmed from a 2017 review of &quot;Sonic Lost World&quot; by YouTube user Gregzilla as well as from fans of &quot;PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds&quot; streamer Forsen who often make references to Uganda in the chat section of his streams. The character is often associated with quotes such as &quot;Do you know da wae?&quot; and &quot;Save the queen!&quot; among many other quotes, which originate from the 2010 Ugandan action comedy film &quot;Who Killed Captain Alex?&quot; as well as for &quot;spitting&quot; on other users whom they feel do not know &quot;da wae&quot;.

The meme was criticized by some journalists as being racially insensitive; &quot;Polygon&quot; described it as &quot;problematic&quot;. The creator of the avatar, DeviantArt user &quot;tidiestflyer&quot;, has expressed regret over how it has been used, in particular saying that he hopes it is not used to annoy players of &quot;VRChat&quot;, and that he enjoys the game and he does not want to see anyone&#x27;s rights get taken away because of the avatar. In response, in January 2018 the developers of &quot;VRChat&quot; published an open letter on &quot;Medium&quot;, stating that they were developing &quot;new systems to allow the community to better self-moderate&quot; and asking users to use the built-in muting features.

In April 2019, Canadian toy company Youtooz launched their line of vinyl collectible figurines with a depiction of Ugandan Knuckles.

===...&amp; Knuckles===
Another Knuckles-centric meme is derived from the video game &quot;Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles&quot;, a game which combined &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; and &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;, accessed by attaching the cartridge of the former to the latter. The awkward-sounding combination of names resulted in a meme where a fictitious and absurdly long video game name is created (usually one for a long-running franchise) with &quot;&amp; Knuckles&quot; appended to the end of it. This meme was also used to poke fun at the Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS series of systems due to the large number of variants, with &amp; Knuckles often appended to the end of an invented system, e.g. &quot;New Nintendo 3DSi XL &amp; Knuckles&quot;. This was later referenced in &quot;Sonic Mania&quot;, which featured an unlockable &quot;&amp; Knuckles&quot; mode, allowing a computer-controlled Knuckles to follow the player&#x27;s character, even if Knuckles is also chosen as the playable character.

<text>Olry Terquem (16 June 1782 – 6 May 1862) was a French mathematician. He is known for his works in geometry and for founding two scientific journals, one of which was the first journal about the history of mathematics. He was also the pseudonymous author (as Tsarphati) of a sequence of letters advocating radical reform in Judaism. He was French Jewish.

==Education and career==
Terquem grew up speaking Yiddish, and studying only the Hebrew language and the Talmud. However, after the French Revolution his family came into contact with a wider society, and his studies broadened. Despite his poor French he was admitted to study mathematics at the École Polytechnique in Paris, beginning in 1801, as only the second Jew to study there. He became an assistant there in 1803, and earned his doctorate in 1804.

After finishing his studies he moved to Mainz (at that time known as Mayence and part of imperial France), where he taught at the Imperial Lycée. In 1811 he moved to the artillery school in the same city, in 1814 he moved again to the artillery school in Grenoble, and in 1815 he became the librarian of the Dépôt Central de l&#x27;Artillerie in Paris, where he remained for the rest of his life. He became an officer of the Legion of Honor in 1852. After he died, his funeral was officiated by Lazare Isidor, the Chief Rabbi of Paris and later of France, and attended by over 12 generals headed by Edmond Le Bœuf.

==Mathematics==
Terquem translated works concerning artillery, was the author of several textbooks, and became an expert on the history of mathematics. Terquem and Camille-Christophe Gerono were the founding editors of the &quot;Nouvelles Annales de Mathématiques&quot; in 1842. Terquem also founded another journal in 1855, the &quot;Bulletin de Bibliographie, d&#x27;Histoire et de Biographie de Mathématiques&quot;, which was published as a supplement to the &quot;Nouvelles Annales&quot;, and he continued editing it until 1861. This was the first journal dedicated to the history of mathematics.
In geometry, Terquem is known for naming the nine-point circle and fully proving its properties. This is a circle that passes through nine special points of any given triangle. Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach had previously observed that the three feet of the altitudes of a triangle and the three midpoints of its sides all lie on a single circle, but Terquem was the first to prove that this circle also contains the midpoints of the line segments connecting each vertex to the orthocenter of the triangle. He also gave a new proof of Feuerbach&#x27;s theorem that the nine-point circle is tangent to the incircle and excircles of a triangle.

Terquem&#x27;s other contributions to mathematics include naming the pedal curve of another curve, and counting the number of perpendicular lines from a point to an algebraic curve as a function of the degree of the curve. He was also the first to observe that the minimum or maximum value of a symmetric function is often obtained by setting all variables equal to each other.

==Jewish activism==
Terquem has been called the first, most radical, and most outspoken of the major proponents of Jewish reform in France, &quot;the &quot;enfant terrible&quot; of French Judaism&quot;. He published 27 &quot;letters of an Israelite&quot; under the name &quot;Tsarphati&quot; (a Hebrew word for a Frenchman), pushing for reforms that in his view would better assimilate Jews into modern life and better accommodate working-class Jews. The first nine of these appeared in &quot;L&#x27;Israélite Français&quot;, and the remaining 18 as letters to the editor in &quot;Courrier de la Moselle&quot;. Terquem rejected the Talmud, proposed to codify intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews, pushed to move the sabbath to Sunday, advocated using other languages than Hebrew for prayers, and fought against circumcision, regressive attitudes towards women, and the Jewish calendar. However, he had little effect on the Jewish practices of the time.

Despite Terquem&#x27;s calls for reform, and despite having married a Catholic woman and raised his children as Catholic, he requested that his funeral be held with all the proper Jewish rites.

<text>Aryeh Moshe Eliyahu Kaplan (; October 23, 1934 – January 28, 1983) was an American Orthodox rabbi, author, and translator best known for his Living Torah edition of the Torah and extensive Kabbalistic commentaries. He became well-known as a prolific writer and was lauded as an original thinker. His wide-ranging literary output, inclusive of introductory pamphlets on Jewish beliefs, and philosophy written at the request of NCSY are often regarded as significant factors in the growth of the &quot;baal teshuva&quot; movement.

==Early life==
Aryeh Kaplan was born in the Bronx, New York City, to Samuel and Fannie () Kaplan of the Sefardi Recanati family from Salonika, Greece. His mother died on December 31, 1947, when he was 13, and his two younger sisters, Sandra and Barbara, were sent to a foster home. Kaplan was expelled from public school after acting out, leading him to grow up as a &quot;street kid&quot; in the Bronx.

Kaplan did not grow up religious, and was known as &quot;Len&quot;. His family had only a slight connection to Jewish practice, but he was encouraged to say Kaddish for his mother. On his first day at the minyan, Henoch Rosenberg, a 14-year-old Klausenburger Hosid, realized that Len was out of place—he was not wearing tefillin or opening a siddur—and befriended him. Henoch Rosenberg and his siblings taught Kaplan Hebrew, and within a few days, Kaplan was learning Chumash.

When he was 15, Kaplan enrolled at Yeshiva Torah Vodaas, and at age 18 (from January 1953 until June 1953) was among &quot;a small cadre of talmidim&quot; selected to help Rabbi Simcha Wasserman open Yeshiva Ohr Elchonon, a new yeshiva in Los Angeles.

After his time in Los Angeles, Kaplan had a few small jobs including teaching at a Hebrew school in the Bronx and at Beth Torah in Richmond, Virginia (February 1955).

In January 1956, Kaplan went to Israel to study at the Mir in Jerusalem. That year, he received semikhah (rabbinic ordination) from some of Israel&#x27;s foremost poskim, including Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog and Eliezer Yehuda Finkel.

== Secular career ==
Upon returning from Israel in August of 1956, Kaplan became a Hebrew teacher at Eliahu Academy in Louisville, Kentucky. and beginning in the 1957 fall semester studied at University of Louisville, where he joined Sigma Pi Sigma, the Woodcock Society, and Phi Kappa Phi and eventually completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics on June 11, 1961. While in Louisville, he met Tobie Goldstein, whom he married on June 13, 1961, and with whom he had nine children.

Kaplan then moved to Hyattsville, Maryland, in 1961 to study physics at the University of Maryland and begin his first professional position as a research scientist at the National Bureau of Standards&#x27;s Fluid Mechanics Division, where he was in charge of magnetohydrodynamics research. Kaplan earned his M.S. degree in physics from University of Maryland in 1963. After graduating, Kaplan remained at University of Maryland as a National Science Foundation fellow through the fall semester of 1964.

== Rabbinic career ==
In 1965, Kaplan switched careers and began practicing as a rabbi. In his book &quot;Encounters&quot;, Kaplan wrote that when asked why he switched from his scientific career to the rabbinate, he said &quot;God had a mission for me&quot;. His career here divides between pulpit roles initially, and other roles thereafter when based in Brooklyn, New York.
Kaplan is mentioned in &quot;Igros Moshe&quot;: he asked of and received a response from Moshe Feinstein regarding the matter of permitting/enabling a youth minyan to which parents would drive children on Shabbos.

=== Pulpit roles ===
*Adas Israel (1965–1966): On February 19, 1965, Kaplan moved to Mason City, Iowa, where he became the Rabbi of Adas Israel. According to a February 1965 article, &quot;Because of his teaching and study since ordination, this is Rabbi Kaplan&#x27;s first pulpit.&quot;
*B&#x27;nai Sholom (1966–1967): On August 7, 1966, Kaplan became the Rabbi at B&#x27;nai Sholom, a Conservative synagogue in Blountville, Tennessee. He held the position through 1967.
*Adath Israel (1967–1969): In 1967, Kaplan became the Rabbi at Adath Israel (now known as Adath Shalom), a Conservative synagogue in Dover, New Jersey. He kept this position through 1969.
*Ohav Shalom (1969–1971): Kaplan then moved to Albany, New York, where he became the Rabbi at Ohav Shalom, a Conservative synagogue. During this time, he also functioned as the president of the AJCC (Albany Jewish Community Center) and the Hillel Counselor to the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Hillel Counselorship at University at Albany, SUNY.

=== Brooklyn ===
In 1971 Kaplan moved to Brooklyn, New York, where he lived until the end of his life (1983) . Kaplan did not hold any positions there as a pulpit rabbi, but had many other roles which involved, chiefly, writing and editing religious publications:
* Chaplain at Hunter and Baruch colleges (New York), from 1971 to 1972
* Associate Editor of &quot;Intercom&quot;, of the Association of Orthodox Jewish Scientists, from 1972 to 1973
* Editor of Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America&#x27;s &quot;Jewish Life&quot; magazine from 1973 to 1974
* Director of publishing at the NCSY from 1974 to 1975.

In the 1970s, Kaplan served in the unofficial capacity of the spiritual advisor for NCSY&#x27;s Brooklyn region. He would converse with teenagers and answer their questions, whether in his home or at drawn-out NCSY conventions where &quot;Aryeh Kaplan was the last adult standing.&quot;

He would also deliver lectures at his home in Kensington, which many locals would regularly attend.

He also served as the rabbinic consultant for the play &quot;Yentl&quot;, after the director met him on the Staten Island Ferry. When asked about his association with a play containing nudity and a woman dressed as a man, Kaplan was quoted to have said &quot;It is an abomination, but so what?&quot;

==NCSY==
Kaplan was involved with NCSY as an author, speaker, and spiritual mentor.

Pinchas Stolper&#x27;s wrote in his introduction to &quot;The Aryeh Kaplan Anthology&quot; how he &quot;discovered&quot; Kaplan:

==Breslov==
Kaplan became involved with Breslov through Rabbi Zvi Aryeh Rosenfeld. In 1973, Rabbi Kaplan translated &quot;Rebbe Nachman’s Wisdom&quot;, one of Breslov&#x27;s most important works, into English on Rabbi Zvi Rosenfeld&#x27;s request. Kaplan also translated and annotated two other books: &quot;Until the Mashiach: The Life of Rabbi Nachman&quot;, a day-to-day account of Rebbe Nachman&#x27;s life, and &quot;Rabbi Nachman&#x27;s Tikkun&quot; (based on the &quot;Tikkun HaKlali&quot;).

Kaplan was also involved in preserving Rabbi Nachman of Breslov&#x27;s grave. In 1979, the government in Uman was planning on demolishing the cemetery containing Rabbi Nachman&#x27;s grave so they could build housing over it. Rabbis Michel Dorfman and Noson Maimon of Breslov contacted Rabbi Moshe Sherer of Agudath Israel of America, who connected them with Rabbi Pinchas Teitz, who then introduced them to Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan. &quot;Using a manual typewriter, Kaplan put together a presentation there on the spot with maps of Ukraine to show exact longitude and latitude&quot;. Rabbi Teitz then sent the presentation to Robert Lipshutz and less than two weeks later after Jimmy Carter met with Leonid Brezhnev at the Strategic Arms Limitation Conference in Vienna, the Soviet ambassador to the U.S. stated that &quot;the Kremlin has decided to honor the plan as originally scheduled, except for Bilinsky Street. That yard will remain untouched.&quot; and it was declared an &quot;international shrine.&quot;

== Literary output ==
Kaplan produced works on topics as varied as prayer, Jewish marriage and meditation. His writing incorporated ideas from across the spectrum of Rabbinic literature, Kabbalah, and Hasidut, all without ignoring science. The concise and detail-orientated character of his works have been described as reflective of his physicist training. In researching his books, Kaplan once remarked &quot;I use my physics background to analyze and systematize data, very much as a physicist would deal with physical reality.&quot;

From 1976 onward, Kaplan worked to translate &quot;Me&#x27;am Lo&#x27;ez&quot; (Torah Anthology), which was originally written in Ladino and in time edited for Hebrew (1967). Kaplan was described as working with his typewriter, &quot;the Me’am Loez in Ladino on one side of him and the Hebrew version on the other side, and he&#x27;d look from one to the other and back again, comparing and contrasting and typing away furiously the entire time.&quot; Shortly before his death, he completed &quot;The Living Torah&quot;, an original translation of the Five Books of Moses and the Haftarot.

Kaplan was described by Rabbi Pinchas Stolper, his original sponsor, as never fearing to speak his mind. &quot;He saw harmony between science and Judaism, where many others saw otherwise. He put forward creative and original ideas and hypotheses, all the time anchoring them in classical works of rabbinic literature.&quot;

== Death ==

Kaplan died at his home of a heart attack on January 28, 1983, at the age of 48. He was buried at the Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery in Jerusalem.

== Legacy ==
Kaplan&#x27;s &quot;Living Torah&quot; was posthumously followed 
by a work written by others for the rest of the Bible, The Living Nach (published in 3 volumes in the 1990s).

His works continue to be read, and his extensive references are used as a resource.

His works have been translated into Czech, French, Hungarian, Modern Hebrew, Portuguese, Russian, German and Spanish.

In 2021, NCSY republished Kaplan&#x27;s works.

The &quot;Aryeh Kaplan Academy&quot; day school in Louisville, Kentucky, is named in honor of Kaplan.

== Bibliography ==
=== Religious works ===
*&quot;The Living Torah&quot;, Rabbi Kaplan&#x27;s best-known work, is a translation into English of the Torah, and one of the first to be structured around the &quot;parshiyot&quot; (the traditional division of the Torah text). It includes maps and diagrams, and incorporated research on realia, flora, fauna, and geography (here, drawing on sources as varied as Josephus, Dio Cassius, Philostratus and Herodotus). The work features frequent footnotes, which also indicate differences in interpretation amongst the commentators, classic and modern. Rabbi Kaplan called this book his 10th child, since it took him exactly nine months to complete. (Moznaim, 1981, )
*&quot;The Handbook of Jewish Thought,&quot; produced early in his career, is a wide-ranging treatment of Judaism&#x27;s fundamental beliefs in two volumes, the first of which was published in Kaplan&#x27;s lifetime. A chapter titled &quot;Creation,&quot; in which Rabbi Kaplan &quot;presents evolution as part of the basic tenets of Judaism,&quot; was omitted from publication.
*&quot;Torah Anthology,&quot; a 45-volume translation of &quot;Me&#x27;am Lo&#x27;ez&quot; from Ladino (Judæo-Spanish) into English. Rabbi Kaplan was the primary translator.
*&quot;Made in Heaven: A Jewish Wedding Guide&quot; (Moznaim, )
*&quot;Tefillin: God, Man and Tefillin&quot;; &quot;Love Means Reaching Out&quot;; &quot;Maimonides&#x27; Principles&quot;; &quot;The Fundamentals of Jewish Faith&quot;; &quot;The Waters of Eden: The Mystery of the Mikvah&quot;; &quot;Jerusalem: Eye of the Universe&quot; — a series of highly popular and influential booklets on aspects of Jewish philosophy and various religious practices. Published by the Orthodox Union/NCSY or as an anthology by Artscroll, 1991, .
*Five booklets of the Young Israel Intercollegiate — &quot;Belief in God&quot;; &quot;Free Will and the Purpose of Creation&quot;; &quot;The Jew&quot;; &quot;Love and the Commandments&quot;; and &quot;The Structure of Jewish Law&quot; launched his writing career. He was also a frequent contributor to &quot;The Jewish Observer&quot;. (These articles have been published as a collection: Artscroll, 1986, )
*&quot;Sichot HaRan&quot; (&quot;Rabbi Nachman&#x27;s Wisdom&quot;), edited by Rabbi Zvi Aryeh Rosenfeld who had requested Kaplan translate this. Kaplan also translated and annotated &quot;Until the Mashiach: The Life of Rabbi Nachman&quot;, a day-to-day account of Rebbe Nachman&#x27;s life, for the Breslov Research Institute. In conjunction with Rosenfeld, Kaplan translated and annotated &quot;Rabbi Nachman&#x27;s Tikkun&quot; (based on the &quot;Tikkun HaKlali&quot;).
*Kaplan translated and annotated classic works on Jewish mysticism — &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;, &quot;Bahir&quot;, and &quot;Derekh Hashem&quot; — as well as produced much original work on the subject in English. His &quot;Moreh Ohr&quot;, a Hebrew-language work, discusses the purpose of Creation, &quot;tzimtzum&quot; and free will from a kabbalistic point of view.
*&quot;If You Were God,&quot; his final work, was published posthumously in 1983. It encourages the reader to ponder topics concerning the nature of being and Divine providence.

<text>Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria (; ; 1 December 19492 December 1993) was a Colombian drug lord, narcoterrorist, and politician who was the founder and sole leader of the Medellín Cartel. Dubbed the &quot;King of Cocaine&quot;, Escobar was one of the wealthiest criminals in history, having amassed an estimated net worth of US$30 billion by the time of his death—equivalent to $70 billion as of 2022—while his drug cartel monopolized the cocaine trade into the United States in the 1980s and early 1990s.

Born in Rionegro and raised in Medellín, Escobar studied briefly at Universidad Autónoma Latinoamericana of Medellín but left without graduating; he instead began engaging in criminal activity, selling illegal cigarettes and fake lottery tickets, as well as participating in motor vehicle theft. In the early 1970s, he began to work for various drug smugglers, often kidnapping and holding people for ransom.

In 1976, Escobar founded the Medellín Cartel, which distributed powder cocaine, and established the first smuggling routes from Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, through Colombia and eventually into the United States. Escobar&#x27;s infiltration into the U.S. created exponential demand for cocaine and by the 1980s it was estimated Escobar led monthly shipments of 70 to 80 tons of cocaine into the country from Colombia. As a result, he quickly became one of the richest people in the world, but constantly battled rival cartels domestically and abroad, leading to massacres and the murders of police officers, judges, locals, and prominent politicians.

In the 1982 Colombian parliamentary election, Escobar was elected as an alternate member of the Chamber of Representatives as part of the Liberal Party. Through this, he was responsible for community projects such as the construction of houses and football fields, which gained him popularity among the locals of the towns that he frequented; however, Escobar&#x27;s political ambitions were thwarted by the Colombian and U.S. governments, who routinely pushed for his arrest, with Escobar widely believed to have orchestrated the Avianca Flight 203 and DAS Building bombings in retaliation.

In 1991, Escobar surrendered to authorities, and was sentenced to five years&#x27; imprisonment on a host of charges, but struck a deal of no extradition with Colombian President César Gaviria, with the ability of being housed in his own, self-built prison, La Catedral. In 1992, Escobar escaped and went into hiding when authorities attempted to move him to a more standard holding facility, leading to a nationwide manhunt. As a result, the Medellín Cartel crumbled, and in 1993, Escobar was killed in his hometown by Colombian National Police, a day after his 44th birthday.

Escobar&#x27;s legacy remains controversial; while many denounce the heinous nature of his crimes, he was seen as a &quot;Robin Hood-like&quot; figure for many in Colombia, as he provided many amenities to the poor. His killing was mourned and his funeral attended by over 25,000 people. Additionally, his private estate, Hacienda Nápoles, has been transformed into a theme park. His life has also served as inspiration for or has been dramatized widely in film, television, and in music.

==Early life==

Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria was born on 1 December 1949 in Rionegro, Antioquia Department. He belonged to the Paisa ethnic subgroup. His family was of Spanish origin, specifically from the Basque Country, and also had Italian roots. He was the third of seven children and grew up in poverty, in the neighboring city of Medellín. His father was a small farmer and his mother was a teacher. Escobar left high school in 1966 just before his 17th birthday, before returning two years later with his cousin Gustavo Gaviria. At this time, the hard life on the streets of Medellín had polished them into gangster bullies in the eyes of teachers. The two dropped out of school after more than a year, but Escobar did not give up. Having forged a high school diploma, he studied briefly in college with the goal of becoming a criminal lawyer, a politician, and eventually the president but had to give up because of lack of money.

== Criminal career ==
=== Early ===
Escobar started his criminal career with his gang by stealing tombstones, sandblasting their inscriptions, and reselling them. After dropping out of school, Escobar began to join gangs to steal cars. Escobar soon became involved in violent crime, employing criminals to kidnap people who owed him money and demand ransoms, sometimes tearing up ransom notes even when Escobar had received the ransom. His most famous kidnapping victim was businessman Diego Echavarria, who was kidnapped and eventually killed in the summer of 1971, Escobar received a $50,000 ransom from the Echavarria family; his gang became well known for this kidnapping.

=== Medellín Cartel ===

Escobar had been involved in organized crime for a decade when the cocaine trade began to spread in Colombia in the mid-1970s. Escobar&#x27;s meteoric rise caught the attention of the Colombian Security Service (DAS), who arrested him in May 1976 on his return from drug trafficking in Ecuador. DAS agents found 39 kg of cocaine in the spare tire of Escobar&#x27;s car. Escobar managed to change the first judge in the lawsuit and bribed the second judge, so he was released along with other prisoners. The following year, the agent who arrested Escobar was assassinated. Escobar continued to bribe and intimidate Colombian law enforcement agencies in the same fashion. His carrot-and-stick strategy of bribing public officials and political candidates in Colombia, in addition to sending hitmen to murder the ones who rejected his bribes, came to be known as &quot;silver or lead&quot;, meaning &quot;money or death&quot;. The Medellín Cartel and the Cali Cartel both managed to bribe Colombian politicians, and campaigned for both the Conservative and Liberal parties. Hence, Escobar and many other Colombian drug lords were pulling strings in every level of the Colombian government because many of the political candidates whom they backed financially were eventually elected. Although the Medellín Cartel was only established in the early 1970s, it expanded after Escobar met several drug lords on a farm in April 1978, and by the end of 1978 they had transported some 19,000 kilograms of cocaine to the United States.

=== Rise to prominence ===

Soon, the demand for cocaine greatly increased in the United States, which led to Escobar organizing more smuggling shipments, routes, and distribution networks in South Florida, California, Puerto Rico, and other parts of the country. He and cartel co-founder Carlos Lehder worked together to develop a new trans-shipment point in the Bahamas, an island called Norman&#x27;s Cay about southeast of the Florida coast. Escobar and Robert Vesco purchased most of the land on the island, which included a airstrip, a harbor, a hotel, houses, boats, and aircraft, and they built a refrigerated warehouse to store the cocaine. According to his brother, Escobar did not purchase Norman&#x27;s Cay; it was instead a sole venture of Lehder&#x27;s. From 1978 to 1982, this was used as a central smuggling route for the Medellín Cartel. With the enormous profits generated by this route, Escobar was soon able to purchase of land in Antioquia for several million dollars, on which he built the Hacienda Nápoles. The luxury house he created contained a zoo, a lake, a sculpture garden, a private bullring, and other amenities for his family and the cartel.

===Escobar at the height of his power===

At the height of his power, Escobar was involved in philanthropy in Colombia and paid handsomely for the staff of his cocaine lab. Escobar spent millions developing some of Medellín&#x27;s poorest neighborhoods. He built housing complexes, parks, football stadiums, hospitals, schools, and churches. Escobar also entered politics in the 1980s and participated in and supported the formation of the Liberal Party of Colombia. In 1982, he successfully entered the Colombian Congress. Although only an alternate, he was automatically granted parliamentary immunity and the right to a diplomatic passport under Colombian law. At the same time, Escobar was gradually becoming a public figure, and because of his charitable work, he was known as &quot;Robin Hood Paisa&quot;. He alleged once in an interview that his fortune came from a bicycle rental company he founded when he was 16 years old.
In Congress, the new Minister of Justice, Rodrigo Lara-Bonilla, had become Escobar&#x27;s opponent, accusing Escobar of criminal activity from the first day of Congress. Escobar&#x27;s arrest in 1976 was investigated by Lara-Bonilla&#x27;s subordinates. A few months later, Liberal leader Luis Carlos Galán expelled Escobar from the party. Although Escobar fought back, he announced his retirement from politics in January 1984. Three months later, Lara-Bonilla was murdered.

The Colombian judiciary had been a target of Escobar throughout the mid-1980s. While bribing and murdering several judges, in the fall of 1985, the wanted Escobar requested the Colombian government to allow his conditional surrender without extradition to the United States. The proposal was initially rejected, and Escobar subsequently founded and implicitly supported the &quot;Los Extraditable&quot; Organization, which aims to fight extradition policy. The &quot;Los Extraditable&quot; Organization was subsequently accused of participating in an effort to prevent the Colombian Supreme Court from studying the constitutionality of Colombia&#x27;s extradition treaty with the United States. It supported the far-left guerrilla movement that attacked the Colombian Judiciary Building and killed half of the justices of the Supreme Court on 6 November 1985. In late 1986, Colombia&#x27;s Supreme Court declared the previous extradition treaty illegal due to being signed by a presidential delegation, not the president. Escobar&#x27;s victory over the judiciary was short-lived, with new president Virgilio Barco Vargas having quickly renewed his agreement with the United States.

Escobar still held a grudge against Luis Carlos Galán for kicking him out of politics, so Galán was assassinated on 18 August 1989 at Escobar&#x27;s orders. Escobar then planted a bomb on Avianca Flight 203 in an attempt to assassinate Galán&#x27;s successor, César Gaviria Trujillo, who missed the plane and survived. All 107 people were killed in the blast. Because two Americans were also killed in the bombing, the U.S. government began to intervene directly.

====La Catedral prison====

After the assassination of Luis Carlos Galán, the administration of César Gaviria moved against Escobar and the drug cartels. Eventually, the government negotiated with Escobar and convinced him to surrender and cease all criminal activity in exchange for a reduced sentence and preferential treatment during his captivity. Declaring an end to a series of previous violent acts meant to pressure authorities and public opinion, Escobar surrendered to Colombian authorities in 1991. Before he gave himself up, the extradition of Colombian citizens to the United States had been prohibited by the newly approved Colombian Constitution of 1991. This act was controversial, as it was suspected that Escobar and other drug lords had influenced members of the Constituent Assembly in passing the law. Escobar was confined in what became his own luxurious private prison, La Catedral, which featured a football pitch, a giant dollhouse, a bar, a Jacuzzi, and a waterfall. Accounts of Escobar&#x27;s continued criminal activities while in prison began to surface in the media, which prompted the government to attempt to move him to a more conventional jail on 22 July 1992. Escobar&#x27;s influence allowed him to discover the plan in advance and make a successful escape, spending the remainder of his life evading the police.

==Death==


Escobar faced threats from the Colombian police, the U.S. government and his rivals, the Cali Cartel. On 2 December 1993, Escobar was found in a house in a middle-class residential area of Medellín by Colombian special forces, using technology provided by the United States which allowed them to trace Escobar&#x27;s location after he made a call to his family. Police tried to arrest Escobar but the situation quickly escalated to an exchange of gunfire. Escobar was shot and killed while trying to escape from the roof, along with a bodyguard who was also shot. He was hit by bullets in the torso and feet, and a bullet which struck him in the head, killing him. This sparked debate about whether he killed himself or whether he was shot and killed.

==Aftermath of his death==
Soon after Escobar&#x27;s death and the subsequent fragmentation of the Medellín Cartel, the cocaine market became dominated by the rival Cali Cartel until the mid-1990s when its leaders were either killed or captured by the Colombian government. The Robin Hood image that Escobar had cultivated maintained a lasting influence in Medellín. Many there, especially many of the city&#x27;s poor whom Escobar had aided while he was alive, mourned his death, and over 25,000 people attended his funeral. Some of them consider him a saint and pray to him for receiving divine help. Escobar was buried at the Monte Sacro Cemetery.

===Virginia Vallejo&#x27;s testimony===

On 4 July 2006, Virginia Vallejo, a television anchorwoman romantically involved with Escobar from 1983 to 1987, offered Attorney General Mario Iguarán her testimony in the trial against former Senator Alberto Santofimio, who was accused of conspiracy in the 1989 assassination of presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galán. Iguarán acknowledged that, although Vallejo had contacted his office on 4 July, the judge had decided to close the trial on 9 July, several weeks before the prospective closing date. The action was seen as too late.

On 18 July 2006, Vallejo was taken to the United States on a special flight of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for &quot;safety and security reasons&quot; due to her cooperation in high-profile criminal cases. On 24 July, a video in which Vallejo had accused Santofimio of instigating Escobar to eliminate presidential candidate Galán was aired by RCN Television of Colombia. The video was seen by 14 million people, and was instrumental for the reopened case of Galán&#x27;s assassination. On 31 August 2011 Santofimio was sentenced to 24 years in prison for his role in the crime.

====Role in the Palace of Justice siege====

Among Escobar&#x27;s biographers, only Vallejo has given a detailed explanation of his role in the 1985 Palace of Justice siege. She stated that Escobar had financed the operation, which was committed by M-19; she blamed the army for the killings of more than 100 people, including 11 Supreme Court magistrates, M-19 members, and employees of the cafeteria. Her statements prompted the reopening of the case in 2008; Vallejo was asked to testify, and many of the events she had described in her book and testimonial were confirmed by Colombia&#x27;s Commission of Truth. These events led to further investigation into the siege that resulted with the conviction of a high-ranking former colonel and a former general, later sentenced to 30 and 35 years in prison, respectively, for the forced disappearance of the detained after the siege. Vallejo would subsequently testify in Galán&#x27;s assassination. In her book, &quot;Amando a Pablo, odiando a Escobar&quot; (&quot;Loving Pablo, Hating Escobar&quot;), she had accused several politicians, including Colombian presidents Alfonso López Michelsen, Ernesto Samper, and Álvaro Uribe of having links to drug cartels.

=== Relatives ===
Escobar&#x27;s widow (María Henao, now María Isabel Santos Caballero), son (Juan Pablo, now Sebastián Marroquín Santos) and daughter (Manuela) fled Colombia in 1995 after failing to find a country that would grant them asylum. Despite Escobar&#x27;s numerous and continual infidelities, Maria remained supportive of her husband. Members of the Cali Cartel even replayed their recordings of her conversations with Pablo for their wives to demonstrate how a woman should behave. This attitude proved to be the reason the cartel did not kill her and her children after Pablo&#x27;s death, although the group demanded and received millions of dollars in reparations for Escobar&#x27;s war against them. Henao even successfully negotiated for her son&#x27;s life by personally guaranteeing he would not seek revenge against the cartel or participate in the drug trade.
After escaping first to Mozambique, then to Brazil, the family settled in Argentina. Living under her assumed name, Henao became a successful real estate entrepreneur until one of her business associates discovered her true identity, and Henao absconded with her earnings. Local media were alerted, and after being exposed as Escobar&#x27;s widow, Henao was imprisoned for eighteen months while her finances were investigated. Ultimately, authorities were unable to link her funds to illegal activity, and she was released. According to her son, Henao fell in love with Escobar &quot;because of his naughty smile [and] the way he looked at [her]. [He] was affectionate and sweet. A great lover. I fell in love with his desire to help people and his compassion for their hardship. We [would] drive to places where he dreamed of building schools for the poor. From [the] beginning, he was always a gentleman.&quot; María Victoria Henao de Escobar, with her new identity as María Isabel Santos Caballero, continues to live in Buenos Aires with her son and daughter. On 5 June 2018, the Argentine federal judge Nestor Barral accused her and her son, Sebastián Marroquín Santos, of money laundering with two Colombian drug traffickers. The judge ordered the seizing of assets for about $1m each.

Argentinian filmmaker Nicolas Entel&#x27;s documentary &quot;Sins of My Father&quot; (2009) chronicles Marroquín&#x27;s efforts to seek forgiveness, on behalf of his father, from the sons of Rodrigo Lara, Colombia&#x27;s justice minister who was assassinated in 1984, as well as from the sons of Luis Carlos Galán, the presidential candidate who was assassinated in 1989. The film was shown at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival and premiered in the U.S. on HBO in October 2010. In 2014, Marroquín published &quot;Pablo Escobar, My Father&quot; under his birth name. The book provides a firsthand insight into details of his father&#x27;s life and describes the fundamentally disintegrating effect of his death upon the family. Marroquín aimed to publish the book in hopes to resolve any inaccuracies regarding his father&#x27;s excursions during the 1990s.

Escobar&#x27;s sister, Luz Maria Escobar, made multiple gestures in attempts to make amends for the drug baron&#x27;s crimes. These include making public statements in the press, leaving letters on the graves of his victims, and, on the 20th anniversary of his death, organizing a public memorial for his victims. Escobar&#x27;s body was exhumed on 28 October 2006 at the request of some of his relatives in order to take a DNA sample to confirm the alleged paternity of an illegitimate child and remove all doubt about the identity of the body that had been buried next to his parents for 12 years. A video of the exhumation was broadcast by RCN, angering Marroquín, who accused his uncle, Roberto Escobar, and cousin, Nicolas Escobar, of being &quot;merchants of death&quot; by allowing the video to air.

===Hacienda Nápoles===
After Escobar&#x27;s death, the ranch, zoo and citadel at Hacienda Nápoles were given by the government to low-income families under a law called &quot;Extinción de Dominio&quot; (Domain Extinction). The property has been converted into a theme park surrounded by four luxury hotels overlooking the zoo.

In 2014, Roberto Escobar founded Escobar Inc with Olof K. Gustafsson and registered Successor-In-Interest rights for his brother Pablo Escobar in California, United States.

===Hippos===

Escobar kept four hippos in a private menagerie at Hacienda Nápoles. They were deemed too difficult to seize and move after Escobar&#x27;s death, and hence left on the untended estate. By 2007, the animals had multiplied to 16 and had taken to roaming the area for food in the nearby Magdalena River. In 2009, two adults and one calf escaped the herd and, after attacking humans and killing cattle, one of the adults (called &quot;Pepe&quot;) was killed by hunters under authorization of the local authorities. As of early 2014, 40 hippos have been reported to exist in Puerto Triunfo, Antioquia Department, from the original four belonging to Escobar. As of 2016, without management, the population size is likely to more than double in the next decade.

The National Geographic Channel produced a documentary about them titled &quot;Cocaine Hippos&quot;. A report published in a Yale student magazine noted that local environmentalists are campaigning to protect the animals, although there is no clear plan for what will happen to them. In 2018, National Geographic published another article on the hippos which found disagreement among environmentalists on whether they were having a positive or negative impact but that conservationists and locals – particularly those in the tourism industry – were mostly in support of their continued presence. By October 2021, the Colombian government had started a program of chemically sterilizing the animals.

===Apartment demolition===
On 22 February 2019, at 11:53 AM local time, Medellín authorities demolished the six-story Edificio Mónaco apartment complex in the El Poblado neighborhood where, according to retired Colombian general Rosso José Serrano, Escobar planned some of his most brazen attacks. The building was initially built for Escobar&#x27;s wife but was gutted by a Cali Cartel car bomb in 1988 and had remained unoccupied ever since, becoming an attraction to foreign tourists seeking out Escobar&#x27;s physical legacy. Mayor Federico Gutierrez had been pushing to raze the building and erect in its place a park honoring the thousands of cartel victims, including four presidential candidates and some 500 police officers. Colombian President Ivan Duque said the demolition &quot;means that history is not going to be written in terms of the perpetrators, but by recognizing the victims&quot;, hoping the demolition would showcase that the city had evolved significantly and had more to offer than the legacy left by the cartels.

==Personal life==

===Family and relationships===
In March 1976, the 26-year-old Escobar married María Victoria Henao, who was 15. The relationship was discouraged by the Henao family, who considered Escobar socially inferior; the pair eloped. They had two children: Juan Pablo (now Sebastián Marroquín) and Manuela. In 2007, the journalist Virginia Vallejo published her memoir &quot;Amando a Pablo, odiando a Escobar&quot; (&quot;Loving Pablo, Hating Escobar&quot;), in which she describes her romantic relationship with Escobar and the links of her lover with several presidents, Caribbean dictators, and high-profile politicians. Her book inspired the movie &quot;Loving Pablo&quot; (2017). A drug distributor, Griselda Blanco, is also reported to have conducted a clandestine but passionate relationship with Escobar; several items in her diary link him with the nicknames &quot;Coque de Mi Rey&quot; (My Coke King) and &quot;Polla Blanca&quot; (White Cock).

===Properties===
After becoming wealthy, Escobar created or bought numerous residences and safe houses, with the Hacienda Nápoles gaining significant notoriety. The luxury house contained a colonial house, a sculpture park, and a complete zoo with animals from various continents, including elephants, exotic birds, giraffes, and hippopotamuses. Escobar had also planned to construct a Greek-style citadel near it, and though construction of the citadel was started, it was never finished.

Escobar owned a home in the US under his own name: a 6,500 square foot (604 m2), pink, waterfront mansion situated at 5860 North Bay Road in Miami Beach, Florida. The four-bedroom estate, built in 1948 on Biscayne Bay, was seized by the US federal government in the 1980s. Later, the dilapidated property was owned by Christian de Berdouare, proprietor of the Chicken Kitchen fast-food chain, who had bought it in 2014. De Berdouare would later hire a documentary film crew and professional treasure hunters to search the edifice before and after demolition, for anything related to Escobar or his cartel. They would find unusual holes in floors and walls, as well as a safe that was stolen from its hole in the marble flooring before it could be properly examined.

Escobar owned a huge Caribbean getaway on Isla Grande, the largest of the cluster of the 27 coral cluster islands comprising Islas del Rosario, located about from Cartagena. The compound, now half-demolished and overtaken by vegetation and wild animals, featured a mansion, apartments, courtyards, a large swimming pool, a helicopter landing pad, reinforced windows, tiled floors, and a large but unfinished building to the side of the mansion.

<text>Sita Maria Vermeulen (born 8 June 1980), known by the mononym Sita, is a Dutch pop singer. She rose to fame in the early 2000s as part of the pop group K-otic. After leaving the band in 2001, she had a brief solo career before turning to television, where she was featured primarily on children&#x27;s television and was a candidate on &quot;Sterren Dansen Op Het IJs&quot;, the Dutch adaption of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; as well as the Dutch version of &quot;Dancing With The Stars&quot;. Since 2009, she has been hosting the Dutch Disney Channel.

== Biography ==
Sita&#x27;s career started in 2001 when she entered in the Dutch television show &quot;Starmaker&quot;, which was a casting show intended to create a band. During the show, Sita became a member of a band which was called K-otic. Due to the popularity of the show, the band scored a few hits. In December 2001, Sita left the band to pursue a solo career, releasing &quot;Happy&quot;, her first solo single, which topped the Dutch charts and also became a minor hit in some other European countries. In January 2002 her first solo album, also called &quot;Happy&quot;, followed.

In 2002, Sita released &quot;Happy&quot; in the United States, and the song &quot;Happy&quot; was also included in the soundtrack of &quot;The Wild Thornberrys Movie&quot;. As a consequence, she received some coverage on Nickelodeon.

Within Europe, she became more known in 2003 when she had the hit song &quot;Le Chemin&quot; together with the French band Kyo.

In 2007, Spanish singer Edurne released a cover of her song &quot;Come With Me&quot; under the name &quot;Ven Por Mi&quot;, achieving success in the Spanish charts.

<text>Symbel (OE) and sumbl (ON) are Germanic terms for &quot;feast, banquet&quot;.

Accounts of the &quot;symbel&quot; are preserved in the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Beowulf&quot; (lines 489–675 and 1491–1500), &quot;Dream of the Rood&quot; (line 141) and &quot;Judith&quot; (line 15), Old Saxon &quot;Heliand&quot; (line 3339), and the Old Norse &quot;Lokasenna&quot; (stanza 8) as well as other Eddic and Saga texts, such as in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; account of the funeral ale held by King Sweyn, or in the &quot;Fagrskinna&quot;.

Paul C. Bauschatz in 1976 suggested that the term reflects a pagan ritual which had a &quot;great religious significance in the culture of the early Germanic people&quot;.

==Etymology==
The prevalent view today is that Old English , Old Saxon , &#x27; (Old High German ) and Old Norse &quot;sumbl&quot;, all of which translate roughly as &quot;feast, banquet, (social) gathering&quot;, continue a Common Germanic &quot;*sumlan&quot; &quot;banquet&quot;, which would correspond to a PIE &#x27; &quot;joint meal&quot; or &quot;congregation&quot; (literally, &quot;symposium&quot; or &quot;assembly&quot;).

A number of earlier scholars have argued for a borrowing from Latin , Against this derivation (in the case of OE &#x27;), P.A. Erades argues that these cognates go back to Common Germanic *&quot;sumil&quot; or *&quot;sumal&quot; &quot;gathering&quot; (in the last case, with ablaut in the suffix). He explains the Germanic stem *&quot;sum&quot;- as ultimately deriving from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;-&quot; prefix, the zero-grade of ablaut of *&#x27; &quot;one, together&quot;. This is the same element which developed into copulative &quot;a&quot; in Ancient Greek.

Paul Bauschatz appears to accept &quot;sum&quot;, &quot;sam&quot; &quot;together&quot;, but proposes that the word represents a compound with &quot;alu&quot; &quot;ale&quot; as its second element (rather than a suffix). This would render the meaning &quot;gathering or coming together of ale&quot;.

The Old English noun is usually translated as &quot;feast&quot;, and forms various compounds such as &quot;symbel-wyn&quot; &quot;joy at feasting&quot;, &quot;symbel-dæg&quot; &quot;feast day&quot;, &quot;symbel-niht&quot; &quot;feast-night&quot;, &quot;symbel-hūs&quot; &quot;feast-house, guest-room&quot;, &quot;symbel-tīd&quot; &quot;feast time&quot;, &quot;symbel-werig&quot; &quot;weary of feasting&quot; etc.
There is also a derived verb, &quot;symblian&quot; or &quot;symblan&quot;, meaning &quot;to feast, caraouse, enjoy one&#x27;s self&quot;.
Not to be confused is the unrelated homophone &quot;symbel, symble&quot; meaning &quot;always, ever&quot;.

==Anglo-Saxon cultures==
In Old English poetry, especially &quot;Beowulf&quot;, feasts could be instrumental occasions to bind the community, secure the loyalty of warriors and to bolster their determination to perform heroic deeds.
* In &quot;Beowulf&quot;, Unferth the &quot;thyle&quot; (cf.: ON &quot;þulr&quot;) appears to act as a royal officiant at the feast which King Hrothgar organised for the Geatish newcomers, Beowulf and his companions. He challenged and questioned Beowulf, not eschewing taunts and mockery (&quot;flyting&quot;). Since no one intervenes during the incident, such behaviour appears to have been expected of him.
* In &quot;Beowulf&quot;, a warrior&#x27;s boast (&quot;gielp, gylp&quot;) or his oath (beot) is often spoken at a feast.
* Another role commonly attested for during a feast was that of the &quot;scop&quot; (cf.: ON &quot;skald&quot;), who recited genealogies, folklore and metrical poetry.
* The alcoholic drink was served by women or alekeepers (&quot;ealu bora&quot; &quot;ale bearer&quot;), the first round usually poured by the lady of the house.

==Scandinavian cultures==
===Bragafull===
The bragarfull &quot;promise-cup&quot; or bragafull &quot;best cup&quot; or &quot;chieftain&#x27;s cup&quot; (compare Bragi) was in Norse culture a particular drinking from a cup or drinking horn on ceremonial occasions, often involving the swearing of oaths when the cup or horn was drunk by a chieftain or passed around and drunk by those assembled. The names are sometimes anglicized as bragarful and bragaful respectively.

That the name appears in two forms with two meanings makes it difficult to determine the literal meaning. The word &quot;bragr&quot; &#x27;best, foremost&#x27; is a source for its first element. The form &quot;bragafull&quot; (but not &quot;bragarfull&quot;) can also be interpreted as &#x27;Bragi&#x27;s cup&#x27;, referring to the Bragi, god of poetry, though no special connection to Bragi appears in any of the sources.

Snorri Sturluson in his &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, in the &quot;Saga of Hákon the Good&quot;, describes the custom of the &quot;bragarfull&quot; at feasts:
The fire was in the middle of the floor of the temple, and over it hung the kettles, and the full goblets were handed across the fire; and he who made the feast, and was a &quot;godi&quot; [&#x27;chief&#x27;], blessed the full goblets, and all the meat of the sacrifice. And first Odin&#x27;s goblet was emptied for victory and power to his king; thereafter, Njörd&#x27;s and Freyr&#x27;s goblets for peace and a good season. Then it was the custom of many to empty the &quot;bragafull&quot;; and then the guests emptied a goblet to the memory of departed friends, called the &quot;minni&quot; [&#x27;remembrance&#x27;].
In &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; section of the same work, Snorri relates:
It was the custom at that time that he who gave an heirship-feast after kings or jarls, and entered upon the heritage, should sit upon the footstool in front of the high
seat, until the full bowl, which was called the &quot;bragafull&quot;, was brought in. Then he should stand up, take the &quot;bragafull&quot;, make solemn vows to be afterwards fulfilled, and thereupon empty the beaker. Then he should ascend the high seat which his father had occupied; and thus he came to the full heritage after his father. Now it was done so on this occasion. When the full &quot;bragafull&quot; came in, King Ingjald stood up, grasped a large bull&#x27;s horn, and made a solemn vow to enlarge his dominions by one half, towards all the four corners of the world, or die; and thereupon pointed with the horn to the four quarters.
The &quot;Fagrskinna&quot; (a 13th-century history of the Kings of Norway), has a similar account in respect to Svein Forkbeard, mentioning first ceremonial drinkings dedicated to the greatest of one&#x27;s kindred, then to Thor or others of the gods. Then the &quot;bragarfull&quot; was poured out and when the giver of the feast had drunk this, he was to make a vow, to be also sworn by those present with him, and only then to sit himself on throne of the deceased.

A prose passage inserted in the Poetic Edda poem &quot;Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar&quot; relates:
Hedin was coming home alone from the forest one Yule-eve, and found a troll-woman; she rode on a wolf, and had snakes in place of a bridle. She asked Hedin for his company. &quot;Nay,&quot; said he. She said, &quot;Thou shalt pay for this at the &quot;bragarfull&quot;.&quot; That evening the great vows were taken; the sacred boar was brought in, the men laid their hands thereon, and took their vows at the &quot;bragarfull&quot;. Hedin vowed that he would have Sváva, Eylimi&#x27;s daughter, the beloved of his brother Helgi; then such great grief seized him that he went forth on wild paths southward over the land, and found Helgi, his brother.

&quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot; relates that Hjörvard, the son of Arngrim, promised at his bragarfull to wed Ingeborg the princess of Sweden, and the legends of Ragnar Lodbrok relate that the Geatish jarl Herraud promised his daughter to anyone who could liberate her from a dragon or talk to her in its presence.

===Minni===
The term &quot;minni&quot; &quot;remembrance, memory&quot; was used for ritual drinking dedicated to the remembrance of the gods. Terms used in this context, both in the Eddaic poems and in the sagas, include &quot;minnis-öl&quot; &quot;memory-ale&quot;, &quot;minnis-horn&quot; &quot;memory-horn&quot;, &quot;minnis-full&quot; &quot;memory-cup&quot;, &quot;minni-sveig&quot; &quot;memory-draught&quot;.
The term &quot;minnisveig&quot; is used by the annotator of the Sigrdrífumál before the valkyrie&#x27;s invocation of the gods. Olafssaga has &quot;minniǫl signuð ásom&quot; &quot;memory-ale dedicated to the æsir&quot;. &quot;Memory-cups&quot; dedicated to individual gods are also named &quot;Oðins full, Niarðar full, Freys full&quot; etc.
The custom was continued uninterrupted by Christianization, and &quot;minni&quot; was now drunk to Christ, Mary and the saints (&quot;Krists minni, Michaêls minni&quot;, etc.).

But the &quot;minni&quot; given to gods or saints was only the most prominent instance of this custom, placed at the beginning of the ritual drinking. Later on, drinkers would also give &quot;minni&quot; to their departed friends.
The term &quot;minni&quot; is the exact cognate of the Middle High German &quot;minne&quot;. The German word had the same meaning of &quot;remembrance of absent or departed loved ones&quot;, but acquired the meaning of &quot;romantic longing for an unattainable woman of higher status&quot; in courtly culture, giving rise to the genre of &quot;Minnesang&quot;, and the personification of &quot;remembrance&quot; as Frau Minne.

==Bauschatz&#x27;s theory==
Paul C. Bauschatz in 1976 suggested that the term reflects a pagan ritual which had a &quot;great religious significance in the culture of the early Germanic people&quot;.

The ritual according to Bauschatz was always conducted indoors, usually in a chieftain&#x27;s mead hall. Symbel involved a formulaic ritual that was more solemn and serious than mere drinking or celebration. The primary elements of symbel are drinking ale or mead from a drinking horn, speech making (which often included formulaic boasting and oaths) and gift giving. Eating and feasting were specifically excluded from symbel, and no alcohol was set aside for the gods or other deities in the form of a sacrifice.

==Modern paganism==

Inspired by Bauschatz&#x27; theory from the 1970s, the sumbel has become a central ritual of Heathenry in the United States. In this version, sumbel is a drinking-ritual in which a drinking horn full of mead or ale is passed around and a series of toasts are made, usually to gods, ancestors, and/or heroes of the religion. The toasts vary by group, and some groups make a distinction between a &quot;regular&quot; sumbel and a &quot;high&quot; sumbel, which have different levels of formality, and different rules during toasting. Participants may also make boasts of their own deeds, or oaths or promises of future actions. Words spoken during the sumbel are considered carefully and any oaths made are considered sacrosanct, becoming part of the destiny of those assembled.

The name &quot;sumbel&quot; (or &quot;symbel&quot;) is mainly derived from Anglo-Saxon sources. For this reason, the ritual is not known by this name among Icelandic Nordic pagans, who nevertheless practice a similar ritual as part of their &quot;blot&quot;.

In Theodism or Anglo-Saxon neopaganism in particular, the &quot;symbel&quot; has a particularly high importance, considered &quot;perhaps the highest rite&quot; or &quot;amongst the most holy rites&quot; celebrated. Symbel consists of rounds of ritual drinking and toasting, and invariably takes place within an enclosed space of some kind. It is usually inaugurated by three formal rounds, as determined by the host; often led by toasts in honor of the Gods, then ancestors and/or heroes, and then a general or personal boast. Other boasts may take place as necessary. Symbel is always formally closed once the formal boasts are completed, in order that the symbel might maintain its dignity and not degenerate into &quot;mere partying&quot;. The two types of boast are the ȝielp (pronounced &#x27;yelp&#x27;) and the beot (pronounced &#x27;bayawt&#x27;, but as one syllable). The former is a boast of one&#x27;s own worthiness, such as one&#x27;s accomplishments, ancestry, etc. The latter is a boast of an action one plans to undertake. In order to protect the luck of the hall, such boasts are subject to challenge by the thyle, whose job it is to make sure that unlucky boasts do not contaminate the luck of all present.

<doc id="161582" wikidata="Q623333" url="?curid=161582" title="Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden">
<text>The Cincinnati Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden is the second oldest zoo in the United States, founded in 1873 and officially opening in 1875. It is located in the Avondale neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio. It originally began with in the middle of the city, but has spread into the neighboring blocks and several reserves in Cincinnati&#x27;s outer suburbs. It was appointed as a National Historic Landmark in 1987.

The zoo houses over 500 species, 1,800 animals and 3,000 plant species. In addition, the zoo also has conducted several breeding programs in its history, and was the first to successfully breed California sea lions. In 1986, the Lindner Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife (CREW) was created to further the zoo&#x27;s goal of conservation. The zoo is known for being the home of Martha, the last living passenger pigeon, and of Incas, the last living Carolina parakeet.

The zoo is an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), and a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA).

A 2014 ranking of the nations&#x27;s best zoos by &quot;USA Today&quot; based on data provided by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums lists the Cincinnati Zoo among the best in the country. A 2019 reader&#x27;s choice ranking of the nation&#x27;s best zoos by &quot;USA Today&quot; named the Cincinnati Zoo the top zoo in North America.

==History==

In 1872, three years before the zoo&#x27;s creation, Andrew Erkenbrecher and several other residents created the &quot;Society for the Acclimatization of Birds&quot; in Cincinnati to acquire insect-eating birds to control an severe outbreak of caterpillars. A collection of approximately 1,000 birds imported from Europe in 1872 was housed in Burnet Woods before being released. In 1873, members of the Society of Acclimatization began discussing the idea of starting a zoo and founded The Zoological Society of Cincinnati. One year later, the Zoological Society of Cincinnati purchased a 99-year lease on in the cow pasture known as Blakely Woods.

The Cincinnati Zoological Gardens officially opened its doors on September 18, 1875. Architect James W. McLaughlin, who constructed the zoo&#x27;s first buildings, designed the earliest &quot;completed&quot; zoological exhibits in the United States. The zoo began with eight monkeys, two grizzly bears, three white-tailed deer, six raccoons, two elk, a buffalo, a laughing hyena, a tiger, an American alligator, a circus elephant, and over four hundred birds, including a talking crow. The first guide book about the Cincinnati Zoo was written in 1876 in German. The founders of the zoo, including its first general manager, were German immigrants and the city had quite a large German-speaking population. The first English-language edition (illustrated) was published in 1893.
In its first 20 years, the zoo experienced many financial difficulties, and despite selling to pay off debt in 1886, it went into receivership in 1898. In order to prevent the zoo from being liquidated, the stockholders chose to give up their interests of the $225,000 they originally invested. For the next two years, the zoo was run under the Cincinnati Zoological Company as a business. In 1901, the Cincinnati Traction Company, purchased the zoo, hoping to use it as a way to market itself to potential customers. They operated the zoo until 1917, when the Cincinnati Zoological Park Association, funded by donations from philanthropists Mary Emery and Anna Sinton Taft and a wave of public desire to purchase the increasingly popular zoo, took over management. In 1932, the city purchased the zoo and started to run it through the Board of Park Commissioners. This marked the zoo&#x27;s transition from its period of financial insecurity to its modern state of stable growth and fiscal stability.

In addition to its live animal exhibits, the zoo houses refreshments stands, a dance hall, roads, walkways, and picnic grounds. Between 1920 and 1972, the Cincinnati Summer Opera performed in an open-air pavilion and were broadcast by NBC radio.

In 1987, parts of the zoo were designated as a National Historic Landmark, the Cincinnati Zoo Historic Structures, due to their significant architecture featured in the Elephant House, the Reptile House, and the Passenger Pigeon Memorial.

==Animals and exhibits==

===Elephant Reserve===

The Herbivora building was constructed in 1906 for $50,000, a huge sum at the time. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, it is considered one of the most spectacular historic buildings in the zoo world. At long and , this was the largest and most complete concrete animal building in the world, intended for hoofed animals. In 2000, the attraction became Vanishing Giants, featuring giraffes, okapis and elephants. From 2007 to 2008, the giraffe and okapi yards were renovated into a food court area and their respective species moved to other areas in the zoo. It has since undergone several renovations and became the Cincinnati Zoo&#x27;s Elephant Reserve at that time.

Elephant Reserve was the home to two subspecies of the Asian elephant in a exhibit with a 60,000 gallon pool in the female yard. The zoo has been trying to breed the two, but they have been unsuccessful since their last baby in 1998.

On the October 1st of 2024, the elephants were moved to the Elephant Trek. Plans for what will become the current Elephant Reserve of becoming a giraffe tower have not been released to the public yet.

===P&amp;G Discovery Forest===
Renovated in 1989, this classroom is used for live animal demonstrations for school groups and zoo visitors presented regularly during the summer. The building houses a few species, including a Linnaeus&#x27;s two-toed sloths, blue-and-yellow macaws, and boa constrictors. It also contains many small animals used for demonstrations as part of the zoo’s visitor engagement program.

===Eagle Eyrie===
This flight cage opened in 1970 as one of the largest flight cages of its time. Originally containing bald eagles, these were moved elsewhere, and the exhibit currently features a Steller&#x27;s sea eagle and an Andean condor.

===Reptile House===

The Reptile House is America&#x27;s oldest surviving zoo building, built in 1875. Originally, it housed monkeys and other primates until 1951. Now, it is home to over 30 reptile species from around the world in both indoor and outdoor exhibits. Selected species include Chinese alligators, Gila monsters, brown anoles, emerald tree monitors, quince monitors, Pascagoula map turtles, pancake tortoises, spider tortoises, poison dart frogs, Titicaca water frogs, hellbenders, black rat snakes, corn snakes, rattlesnakes, pine snakes, king cobras, Indochinese spitting cobras, boa constrictors, emerald tree boas and West African Gaboon vipers. Neighboring the Reptile House are two outdoor exhibits featuring the Galápagos tortoises and rescued bald eagles, the latter formerly contained Japanese macaques.

===Gorilla World===
This exhibit opened in 1978 as a naturalistic, rain forest habitat for the Cincinnati Zoo&#x27;s western lowland gorillas. The Cincinnati Zoo leads the country in gorilla births with 48. Elle was the last gorilla born at the zoo in 2015. The zoo holds the record for having 6 gorilla births in one year in 1995. In this same year, one of their gorillas gave birth to the world&#x27;s first test-tube gorilla. Near the gorilla exhibits, the zoo also features black-and-white colobus monkeys.

===Night Hunters===

The Carnivora Building was built in 1952. In 1985, it was renovated to become the Cat House. From 2010 to 2011, it was renovated again to become the Night Hunters exhibit. It is home to many nocturnal and/or predatory animals previously found in other exhibits throughout the zoo, including aardvarks, aardwolves, binturong, black-footed cats, fishing cats, clouded leopards, common vampire bats, fennec foxes, Indian flying foxes, northern greater galagos, large-spotted genets, ocelots, Pallas&#x27;s cats, ringtails, a Gambian pouched rat, sand cats, and tawny frogmouths. During the day, lights inside the building are kept very low to allow visitors to view the animals in their natural nocturnal habitats.

===Cat Canyon===
Cat Canyon links the Night Hunters experience with the former Tiger Canyon area to include new exhibits for cougars, Malayan tigers, and snow leopards. Cat Canyon provides an exciting, sensory adventure into the world of the great feline predators while strengthening the Zoo&#x27;s commitment to the conservation of threatened species through education and scientific research in the wild and at the zoo. Included at the end of this trail is an exhibit housing Eurasian eagle-owls.

===World of the Insect===

Opened in 1978, this is the largest building in North America devoted to the display of live insects. The Cincinnati Zoo has been given four awards by the American Zoo and Aquarium Association for successful propagation of insects, and World of the Insect received the prized American Zoo and Aquarium Association exhibit award in 1979. This building also features the longest ant exhibit in the world, housing colonies of leafcutter ants. Some of its species include Antilles pinktoe tarantulas, Brazilian whiteknee tarantulas, dragon-headed katydids, Eastern lubber grasshoppers, marbled crayfish, Texas bullet ants and water scorpions. Despite being an insect house, it also displays Fire belly newts, the Phelsuma grandis,
poison dart frogs, Argentine horned frogs and even naked mole-rats

===Dragons!===
This building features five species of colorful monitor lizards ranging from Southeast Asia and Australia. In the past, this exhibit housed other animal species until the zoo received the largest Komodo dragon to ever live in captivity in the Western Hemisphere, named Naga. He was a gift from George H. W. Bush from the Indonesian Government. The Cincinnati Zoo was the second U.S. zoo to exhibit Komodo dragons and the second zoo to breed them outside of Indonesia. The exhibit was renovated in 2009 and opened in June 2010. A few other species of lizards such as armadillo girdled lizards, blue tree monitors and Nile monitors are also housed in this complex.

===Lemur Lookout===
This open-aired exhibit was built in 1962 as Baboon Island and renovated as Ibex Island. It allows guests to look down at some of the zoo&#x27;s ring-tailed lemurs on a tall, man-made rock with many lush and shady areas, surrounded by a small stream.

===Wings of Wonder===
Wings of Wonder is an educational live show featuring different species of birds.

===Otto M. Budig Manatee Springs===
Manatee Springs, a $4,500,000 attraction, opened on May 21, 1999, and was awarded the Munson Aquatic Conservation Exhibitry Award and a Significant Achievement Exhibit Award from the American Zoo and Aquarium Association in 2000. The sights, sounds, and smells of Florida greet visitors as they enter Manatee Springs. Close-up viewing on both dry land, as well as dramatic underwater viewing of over 45 magnificent species provide an exciting experience for every Zoo visitor.

Manatee Springs facilities include a greenhouse (304 m2) and an exhibit building (1035 m2). The entire facility (1339 m2) includes 171 m2 (1,900 ft²) of staff and support areas and 369m² (4,100 ft²) of filtration equipment space on two levels. The manatee tank is 120,000 gallons with 3 viewing areas including a bubble window. In addition to the central exhibit with Florida manatees, other Florida species are featured, including American alligators, American crocodiles, alligator gars, alligator snapping turtles, coastal plain cooters, loggerhead musk turtles, greater sirens, two-toed amphiumas and the invasive Burmese python.

=== Siegfried and Roy&#x27;s White Lions of Timbavati ===
This exhibit opened as Big Cat Canyon in 1975, containing three one-year old White tigers. In February and in August 1988, the Zoo attained rare white lion cubs donated to the zoo by Siegfried and Roy. These lions successfully bred four offspring in April 2001, but as of May 2022, they all died, and their exhibit now contains Bennett&#x27;s wallabies.

===Rhino Reserve===

Built in 1935 as the African Veldt with large hoofed animals, the series of exhibits was renovated in 1997 to become Rhino Reserve. This area is home to Flamingo Cove with over twenty greater flamingos. The Cincinnati Zoo ranks as a U.S. leader in breeding eastern black rhinos with eighteen births over the course of their existence. Other featured species include okapi, yellow-backed duiker, plains zebra, eastern bongo, and Visayan warty pigs.

On July 17, 2017, a black rhino calf, Kendi, was born to parents Faru and Seyia. Kendi&#x27;s birth was captured on camera and can be viewed on the zoo&#x27;s website. Curator of mammals at the zoo, Christina Gorsuch states, &quot;This calf is only the fifth eastern black rhino born in the last two years in North America.&quot; She goes on to say &quot;Every rhino calf born is incredibly important for the population, which includes fewer than 60 in North America. Calves will stay with their mothers for 3–4 years which means that the average female can only have one calf every 5 years.&quot; In 2015, AZA and Species Survival Plan (SSP) determined that parents Faru and Seyia were a good genetic match and recommended that they breed. Faru came to Cincinnati from Atlanta in the summer of 2015 and was introduced to Seyia. Kendi was sent to San Diego Zoo Safari Park October of 2019 and later to the Honolulu Zoo in 2022

===Spaulding Children&#x27;s Zoo===
Renovated in 1984–1985, of exhibits that feature common barnyard animals, animals of the eastern American woodlands, and animals of the southwest American desert such as alpacas, llamas, Nigerian Dwarf goats, Juliana pigs, guinea pigs as well as Brazilian porcupines, radiated tortoises and southern tamanduas. There is a nursery where guests can see either babies born at the zoo or babies that came to the zoo. Volunteers and keepers bring a certain harmless animal out everyday for guests to be able to touch, and learn more about them. Lucille, a two-year old binturong, is the ambassador for the Cincinnati Bearcats, there is also a ground squirrel named Yam, Scamper, a rescued American red fox, and a Virginia opossum named Opal who was rescued in Northern Ohio in early 2023, she was brought to the zoo to educate guests about the importance of local wildlife.

===Gibbon Islands===
Completed in 1972, Gibbon Islands occupies the former location of the old Opera Pavilion. (From 1920 to 1971, the Cincinnati Zoo was home to the Cincinnati Opera Summer Festival.) These two islands are surrounded by water that flows from Swan Lake. Bamboo exercise bars are the stage for yellow-cheeked gibbons and siamangs who entertain visitors with their acrobatic antics and loud whooping calls while climbing on their giant jungle gyms.

===Red Panda Habitat===

Opened in 1985, this naturalistic woodland landscape includes many native Chinese plant species to simulate the natural forest habitat of the red panda. One pair of red pandas was a gift to the Cincinnati Zoo from the Beijing Zoo in China. These lavish exhibits are opened aired, connected by a small flowing stream under low elevated bridge. It also provides many tall trees for the five pandas to relax and sleep on.

===Swan Lake===
This big body of water takes up a lot of the zoo&#x27;s ground near the entrance. The Cincinnati Zoo was the first place to exhibit and breed red-crowned cranes, trumpeter swans, wood ducks and various other waterfowl species are kept here.

===Wolf Woods===
Wolf Woods opened in 2005 after a renovation of Otter Creek. After another renovation in the summer of 2011, the second section focuses on the conservation story of the Mexican gray wolf native to the southwestern United States. Here, a rustic, historical trapper&#x27;s cabin has been converted into a Mexican wolf field research station. Other species include the gray foxes, North American river otters, and barred owls.

===Lords of the Arctic===
Lords of the Arctic opened in 2000, housing species representing northern parts of the world in a attraction. Originally housing polar bears; the last individual having died in 2021, the exhibit also features Arctic foxes. According to the zoo&#x27;s master plan, the exhibit will be retooled to house North American wildlife, along with American black bears and sea otters in 2025. 

===Jungle Trails===

Jungle Trails takes visitors through a naturalized rain forest habitat, teeming with rare and exotic wildlife and hundreds of plant species from Asia, South America, and Africa. Each region in the exhibit is divided by outdoor and indoor habitats with enjoyable viewing of the Zoo&#x27;s collection of rare primates birds, reptiles, insects, small mammals.

The attraction received the AZA prestigious exhibit award in 1994, a year after it opened. First, a series of outdoor exhibits features Sumatran orangutans, white-handed gibbons, Müller&#x27;s gibbons, helmeted curassows and blue-throated macaws. Next, an indoor building houses pygmy slow loris, golden-headed lion tamarins, and white-faced sakis, in addition to indoor housing for the orangutans and gibbons. Further on, another series of outdoor exhibits features black howlers, bonobos, Coquerel&#x27;s sifakas, and Angola colobuses. The second building features West African pottos, and an aye-aye.

===Birds of the World===
Birds of the World features a wide-variety of bird species from throughout the entire world, including a selection of aviaries that guests can enter to get up close and personal. Birds housed include Bali mynas, boat-billed herons, buff-crested bustards, Guam rails, Inca terns, masked lapwings, sunbitterns, thick-billed parrots, penguins and puffins.

===Africa===
The $1.6 million Dobsa Giraffe Ridge opened on June 6, 2008, and allows guests to feed Masai giraffes from a tall elevated platform. Guests can also view the giraffes in their indoor stalls especially during winter.

In the 2010s the zoo built an Africa exhibit, the largest animal exhibit in its history. Phases I and II, completed in 2010, added an exhibit for cranes and expanded the Cheetah Encounter yard so that the cheetahs had a 40% larger running space. Phase III opened on June 29, 2013, and included a wider vista that offers visitors an opportunity to see African lions, servals, a bat-eared fox, African wild dogs, and a new cheetah exhibit. A new Base Camp Café, said to be the greenest restaurant in the US, was also added in the 2013 season.

Phase IV, the largest phase of the Africa expansion, opened on June 28, 2014. It introduced a wide savanna with lesser kudus, a saddle-billed stork, common ostriches, crested guineafowl, pink-backed pelicans, Rüppell&#x27;s vultures, lappet-faced vultures, and grey crowned cranes.

Phase V, the final phase of the expansion, opened on July 23, 2016, adding an area for Nile hippos, Hippo Cove, which provides both above and below-water viewing. A 34-year-old male named Henry from the Dickerson Park Zoo and a 17-year-old female named Bibi from the St. Louis Zoo joined the zoo. On the morning of January 24, 2017, Bibi gave birth to a six-weeks premature calf.
The baby female hippo, named Fiona by zoo staff, is the first hippo to be born at the zoo in 75 years. Fiona was also the first Nile hippo to ever be captured on an ultrasound image. After intensive care from zoo keepers, veterinarians, and NICU specialists at Cincinnati Children&#x27;s Hospital, Fiona survived. The story of her trials and success made her an internet celebrity and city hero, and has dramatically increased zoo attendance. Henry&#x27;s health declined later in 2017 and he was euthanized on October 31. On September 6, 2021, a 19-year-old male named Tucker from the San Francisco Zoo joined the zoo. On August 24, 2022, Bibi gave birth to another calf which weighed roughly 60 pounds. This calf&#x27;s was named Fritz, which was decided through a public vote.

===Roo Valley===
In August 2020, the Cincinnati Zoo finished the first part of their master plan &quot;More Home To Roam&quot;. They turned their old Wildlife Canyon exhibit (former home of the critically endangered Sumatran rhino) into an exhibit called Roo Valley, the exhibit features the Zoo&#x27;s first-ever kangaroo walkabout, with a new beer garden and restaurant, a big rope course over the habitat, and provides the largest outdoor little penguin habitat. Roo Valley adds five new species to the zoo as well, including red and western grey kangaroos, Australian wood ducks, New Zealand scaups and freckled ducks, the latter three species living side by side with the little penguins.

===African Penguin Point===
In September 2020, the Cincinnati Zoo finished the second part of the master plan. They turned their old sea lion habitat, sometimes referred to as &quot;Seal Falls&quot; until the passing of Duke the California sea lion in 2019, into a bigger exhibit for their African penguins, increasing their breeding success rate, while at the same time including some other African sea birds like the white-breasted cormorants, great white pelicans, and yellow-billed ducks.

=== Harry and Linda Fath Elephant Trek ===
On June 15, 2021, the Zoo Broke ground on the Biggest Habitat in Zoo History: The Harry and Linda Fath Elephant Trek; The Elephant Trek is five times the size of the Zoo&#x27;s current elephant habitat that opened on October 1st, 2024 that is now home to a multi-generational herd of 8–10 Asian elephants. It includes swimming pools, streams, overhead feeding stations, mud wallows, and enrichment opportunities at every turn. These enrichments encourage movement and other natural behaviors. The herd of eight can access three different yards that serve different purposes and can accommodate separation for training and medical procedures. It is also home to Vietnamese pheasants and Azure-winged magpies. 

Phase 2 in 2025 will include Siamang’s Point, a rhinoceros hornbill exhibit, Asian small-clawed otters and Babirusa pigs for the Clawed River Otter Habitat and the New Picnic Shelter Complex.

==Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife (CREW)==
The Cincinnati Zoo has been active in breeding animals to help save species, starting as early as 1880 with the first hatching of a trumpeter swan in a zoo, as well as four passenger pigeons. This was followed in 1882 with the first American bison born in captivity.

In 1986, the zoo established the Carl H. Lindner Jr. Family Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife for the purpose of using science and technology to understand, preserve, and propagate endangered flora and fauna and facilitate the conservation of global biodiversity.
Its Frozen Zoo plays a major role. In it are stored over 2,500 specimens representing approximately 60 animal and 65 plant species.
Terri Roth is CREW&#x27;s director.

The successful breeding programs have earned the zoo nicknames like &quot;the world&#x27;s sexiest zoo&quot; and &quot;sexiest zoo in America&quot;.

== &quot;More Home to Roam&quot; expansion campaign ==

In 2018 the zoo launched an expansion campaign named &quot;More Home to Roam&quot; with the goal of raising $150 million to be used on developing new attractions and infrastructure. The zoo opened the Roo Valley and African Penguin Point in summer of 2020, and they have plans to renovate the Lords of the Arctic area to bring back the black bears and introduce sea otters after when the their last polar bear named Little One who was euthanized due to a renal failure on March of 2021. The Rhino Reserve renovations and a 1,800 vehicle parking garage will hopefully be open by 2023, Elephant Trek will open in fall of 2024, and the old elephant exhibit will be changed into Giraffe Junction, where they will repair the concrete dome, replace the roof, install new windows, adding a new garden area, and a habitat for giraffes. The plan also includes a new entrance to facilitate traffic into the zoo. The additions are also aimed at making the zoo net zero in terms of waste, water, and energy, making the facilities waste free.

Philanthropists Harry and Linda Fath contributed $50 million to the campaign in June 2018. Previous expansion efforts, such as the Africa exhibit and gorilla exhibit, cost $34 million and $18 million respectively.

As result on the COVID-19 pandemic, the zoo tabled its original plan to build a parking garage and bumped Elephant Trek to the top of the priority list. 

== Notable animals ==
Animals at the zoo have held several records, including the longest living American alligator in captivity at the time (at about 70 years of age), the fastest cheetah in captivity, and the largest Komodo dragon. The zoo was the first in the United States to put an aye-aye on display, and after losing its last aye-aye in 1993, it finally acquired another in 2011 – a six-year old transferred from the Duke Lemur Center in North Carolina.

The zoo is one of only a dozen in North America to house and breed bonobos (also known as pygmy chimpanzees), an endangered species of the great apes.

On January 6 and 7, the zoo celebrated the birth of its first babies of 2020. Two penguin chicks hatched, one each day.

=== Martha ===
Martha was the last passenger pigeon housed at the Cincinnati Zoo. She was named after Martha Washington, the very first First lady of the United States of America. Following the death of her last mate on July 10th, 1910, Martha became the sole passenger pigeon of the zoo and the last known individual of her species. She became one of the most famous individuals in the zoo due to her status as the species&#x27; endling and the $1,000 reward ($33,000 in 2024) for a successful capture of another living individual. On September 1st, 1914, Martha died of natural causes and following her death, the passenger pigeons were declared extinct. Since then, Martha&#x27;s body has been taxidermised and is currently on display at the Smithsonian&#x27;s Wonders of the World exhibit. Outside of the building that is believed to have housed Martha, a statue of her was built to immortalise her and Incas, the last known Carolina parakeet and to raise awareness of conservation to prevent similar species from meeting the same fates as Martha and Incas.

=== Incas ===

Incas was the last known Carolina parakeet, and similar to Martha, he was housed at the Cincinnati Zoo. He was brought to the zoo in 1885 as part of a captive breeding programme to establish a population. He had a mate named Lady Jane, but they were unsuccessful in producing offspring. In the Summer of 1917, Lady Jane died which led to Incas becoming very depressed and mournful. In the evening of February 21st, 1917, Incas died of abnormal freezing temperatures at the age of 33. However, unlike Martha, the location of the remains of Incas are unknown with possibilities that he may be on display unlabelled at the Cincinnati Museum of Natural History. 

=== Susie ===

In 1931, Robert J. Sullivan permanently loaned the zoo a female eastern gorilla named Susie. Captured in the Belgian Congo, Susie was first sold to a group of French explorers who sent her to France. In August 1929, Susie was transported from Europe to the United States aboard the airship &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; accompanied by William Dressman. After Susie completed a tour through the United States and Canada with Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus,

Sullivan purchased Susie for $4,500 and loaned her to the zoo. Dressman, who stayed on as Susie&#x27;s trainer after she was loaned to the zoo, taught her how eat with a knife and fork and orchestrated two performances every day. Susie was so popular that on her birthday on August 7, 1936, more than 16,000 visitors flocked to the zoo. Susie remained one of the most popular animals at the zoo until her death on October 29, 1947. Her body was donated to the University of Cincinnati, where her skeleton remained on display until it was destroyed in a fire in 1974.

=== Harambe ===
On May 28, 2016, Harambe, a 17-year-old, male western lowland gorilla, was fatally shot by zoo officials after a three-year-old boy climbed into Harambe&#x27;s enclosure. The incident was recorded by a bystander and uploaded to YouTube, where the video went viral. Zoo director Thane Maynard stated, &quot;The child was being dragged around ... His head was banging on concrete. This was not a gentle thing. The child was at risk.&quot; The shooting was controversial, with some observers stating that it was not clear whether or not Harambe was likely to harm the child. Others called for the boy&#x27;s parents and/or the zoo to be held accountable for the gorilla&#x27;s death.

The boy was transported to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries after being rescued. Police investigated possible criminal charges, while the parents of the boy defended the zoo&#x27;s actions. The incident received global publicity; comedian and actor Ricky Gervais, rock guitarist and astrophysicist Brian May, and journalist and television personality Piers Morgan criticized the shooting, while real estate developer and then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and zoo director and notable animal expert Jack Hanna both lamented the shooting but defended the zoo&#x27;s decision to prioritize the boy&#x27;s safety.

===Fiona===

In January 2017, the zoo had its first birth of a hippopotamus in 75 years. Named Fiona, she was born six weeks prematurely and her survival was in doubt. At the time of her birth, she weighed only 29 pounds, which was 25 pounds less than the lowest recorded birthweight for her species. The zoo&#x27;s efforts to save her and her subsequent improvement to good health provided a viral sensation on the internet. At the age of four, Fiona weighed 1,600 pounds.

<doc id="161583" wikidata="Q1740848" url="?curid=161583" title="Kid Chocolate">
<text>Eligio Sardiñas Montalvo (January 6, 1910 – August 8, 1988), better known as Kid Chocolate, was a Cuban boxer who enjoyed great success both in the boxing ring and outside it during the 1930s. Chocolate boxed professionally between 1927 and 1938. His record was 136 wins, 10 losses and 6 draws, 51 wins coming by knockout and one no-decision bout, also making &quot;Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of boxers with 50 or more career knockout wins. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall Of Fame in 1991.

==Biography==
===Career===
====Early years====
Sardiñas, also nicknamed &quot;The Cuban Bon Bon&quot;, learned how to fight by watching old fight films in Cuba. He later sparred with boxers such as Benny Leonard and Jack Johnson, all world champions, before beginning an amateur boxing career. Sardiñas had no fear and would actively engage in fights outside the ring with anyone who wanted it.

His professional boxing debut, officially, occurred on March 3, 1928, when he knocked out Juan Sarriá Rodríguez aka &#x27;Kid Sotolongo&#x27; via first-round KO of a scheduled 6 round bout after having fought and won 3 semi-professional bouts from October 1927 to February 1928.

====Taking the World Jr. Lightweight Championship====

After going up in weight class to the Junior Lightweight division, he started 1931 by winning four fights in a row. Then, on July 15, his dream of becoming Cuba&#x27;s first world boxing champion finally came true, as he knocked out the defending world Junior Lightweight champion Benny Bass in seven rounds to take the world title. Five non-title wins followed, including a first-round knockout in a rematch with Scalfaro. He finished the year by going up in weight once again, and challenging world Lightweight champion Tony Canzoneri, losing by a decision in 15 in his first attempt to gain the Lightweight crown.

He started 1932 by winning his first eight bouts, including a world title defense in Havana against Davie Abad, beaten in 15 by decision. Then, he faced &quot;Kid&quot; Berg in a rematch, losing again, this time by decision in 15. He engaged in seven more bouts, including two decision wins over Johnny Farr, before fighting Lew Feldman on October 13. The fight was recognized as a world Featherweight title bout, but only by the New York state athletic commission. Chocolate won by a knockout in 12 rounds, gaining the New York World title.

He defended that &quot;world&quot; title twice, including a third fight with LaBarba, before relinquishing it while in the middle of a European boxing tour that took him to Madrid, Barcelona and Paris. He won all of his fights on that tour by decision. Upon returning to America, he lost by a knockout in two in a rematch with Canzoneri.

====Losing the World Jr. Lightweight Title to Frankie Klick====
Before a crowd of 4,000, the Kid lost the World Jr. Lightweight boxing championship to Frankie Klick, on December 25, 1933, at the Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in a seventh-round technical knockout. The &quot;Ludington Daily News&quot;, wrote &quot;The flashy Cuban &quot;bon bon&quot; (Chocolate) was bereft of the title in the seventh round of a scheduled fifteen round Christmas Day bout by a whistling right smash to the chin and all he got in exchange was the second knockout of his career although the latest was of the technical variety.&quot; The bout had been fairly close until the seventh with Chocolate showing stamina and style. The seventh round had gone two minutes and fifty-eight seconds when the knockout occurred. &quot;The Cuban waged a fast, aggressive fight in the early rounds that gave him a temporary lead.&quot; Chocolate had landed rights &quot;to the head and body.&quot; Kid Chocolate may have been suffering from the knockout he had received from Tony Canzoneri only a month previously. Chocolate retained his featherweight championship at least in the state of New York. After that fight, it was revealed that he was suffering from syphilis.

====Later years====

He retired shortly thereafter, but came back in 1934. He won 47 of his next 50 bouts. He never received another world title attempt and felt abandoned by boxing&#x27;s elite. He retired again in 1938.

Kid Chocolate enjoyed the city&#x27;s nightlife. However, when he stepped out of boxing, he went back to Cuba and lived a quieter life.

====Legacy====
From 1959, Chocolate&#x27;s fame in Cuba was overlooked by Fidel Castro and his revolutionary forces, and he almost became a forgotten champion. But, by the late 1970s, Chocolate&#x27;s achievements were finally recognized by the Cuban government, who gave him a small pension. Chocolate died in his own home – bought for his mother when he was champion – in 1988.

He was the inspiration for the character Chocolate Drop in Clifford Odets&#x27; play Golden Boy.

Former WBO middleweight champion Peter Quillin, an American of Cuban descent, carries the nickname &quot;Kid Chocolate&quot; in honor of Sardiñas.

The highly acclaimed greatest pound for pound boxer of all time Sugar Ray Robinson was a big fan of Kid Chocolate and incorporated a lot of Chocolate&#x27;s boxing style into his own: &quot;Sugar Ray Robinson was a great admirer of Kid Chocolate,&quot; said Fausto Miranda, a former Cuban journalist who covered many of Chocolate&#x27;s fights. Sugar Ray Robinson, went on record saying that he had never seen anyone box like Kid Chocolate before. Robinson studied the Chocolate style and incorporated much of his slick movement and graceful flair into his own boxing style. Robinson in many ways was a combination of his boxing idols Joe Louis and Kid Chocolate. He mixed the concentration, masterful combinations and power punching of Louis with the stylish movement and balance of Chocolate.

Montalvo was also the cousin of the lesser known flyweight contender Eladio &#x27;Black Bill&#x27; Valdés.

<text>The New Zealand dollar (; sign: $; code: NZD) is the official currency and legal tender of New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Niue, the Ross Dependency, Tokelau, and a British territory, the Pitcairn Islands. Within New Zealand, it is almost always abbreviated with the dollar sign ($). The abbreviations &quot;$NZ&quot; or &quot;NZ$&quot; are used (outside New Zealand) when necessary to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies.

The New Zealand dollar was introduced in 1967. It is subdivided into 100 cents. Altogether it has five coins and five banknotes with the smallest being the 10-cent coin; smaller denominations have been discontinued due to inflation and production costs.

In the context of currency trading, the New Zealand dollar is sometimes informally called the &quot;Kiwi&quot; or &quot;Kiwi dollar&quot;, since the flightless bird, the kiwi, is depicted on its one-dollar coin. It is the tenth most traded currency in the world, representing 2.1% of global foreign exchange market daily turnover in 2019.

==History==

===Introduction===

Prior to the introduction of the New Zealand dollar in 1967, the New Zealand pound was the currency of New Zealand, which had been distinct from the pound sterling since 1933. The pound used the £sd system, in which the pound was divided into 20 shillings and one shilling was divided into 12 pence, a system which by the 1950s was considered complicated and cumbersome.

Switching to decimal currency had been proposed in New Zealand since the 1930s, although only in the 1950s did any plans come to fruition. In 1957, a committee was set up by the Government to investigate decimal currency. The idea fell on fertile ground, and in 1963, the Government decided to decimalise New Zealand currency. The Decimal Currency Act was passed in 1964, setting the date of transition to 10 July 1967. Words such as &quot;fern&quot;, &quot;kiwi&quot; and &quot;zeal&quot; were proposed to avoid confusion with the word &quot;dollar&quot;, which many people associate with the United States dollar. In the end, the word &quot;dollar&quot; was chosen anyway, and an anthropomorphic dollar note cartoon character called &quot;Mr. Dollar&quot; became the symbol of transition in a huge publicity campaign.

On Monday 10 July 1967 (&quot;Decimal Currency Day&quot;), the New Zealand dollar was introduced to replace the pound at a rate of two dollars to one pound (one dollar to ten shillings, ten cents to one shilling, cent to a penny). Some 27 million new banknotes were printed and 165 million new coins were minted for the changeover.

===Exchange rate===
The New Zealand dollar was initially pegged to both the British pound sterling and the United States dollar at NZ$1 = UK£ = US$1.40. On 21 November 1967 sterling was devalued from UK£1 = US$2.80 to US$2.40 (see Bretton Woods system), but the New Zealand dollar was devalued even more from NZ$1 = US$1.40 to US$1.12, to match the value of the Australian dollar.

In 1971 the US devalued its dollar relative to gold, leading New Zealand on 23 December to peg its dollar at US$1.216 with a 4.5% fluctuation range, keeping the same gold value. From 9 July 1973 to 4 March 1985 the dollar&#x27;s value was determined from a trade-weighted basket of currencies.

On 4 March 1985, the NZ$ was floated at the initial rate of US$0.4444. Since then the dollar&#x27;s value has been determined by the financial markets, and has been in the range of about US$0.39 to 0.88.

The dollar&#x27;s post-float low was US$0.3922 on 22 November 2000, and it reached a post-float high on 9 July 2014 of US$0.8821. Much of this medium-term variation in the exchange rate has been attributed to differences in interest rates.

The New Zealand dollar is among the 10 most-traded currencies.

On 11 June 2007 the Reserve Bank sold an unknown worth of New Zealand dollars for nine billion USD in an attempt to drive down its value. This is the first intervention in the markets by the Bank since the float in 1985.

Two suspected interventions followed, but they were not as successful as the first: the first appeared to be initially effective, with the dollar dropping to approximately US$0.7490 from near US$0.7620. However, within little more than a month it had risen to new post-float highs, reaching US$0.8103 on 23 July 2007.

After reaching its post-float record high in early 2008, the value of the NZ$ plummeted throughout much of the 2nd half of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 as a response to the global economic downturn and flight by investors away from &quot;riskier&quot; currencies such as the NZ$. The NZ$ bottomed out at approximately US$0.50 on 6 March 2009. However, it rebounded strongly as the year progressed, reaching the US$0.75 range by November 2009.

By late 2012, the dollar was holding above 80 US cents, occasionally reaching 85¢, prompting calls from the Green Party for quantitative easing. Unions also called on the Government and the Reserve Bank to take action, but as of February 2013 both had declined.

As of early June 2017, the NZD was trading at approximately US$0.71, and in early November 2019 it was valued as US$0.63 = NZ$1.

==Coins==
===History===

On the introduction of the dollar, coins came in denominations of 1c, 2c, 5c, 10c, 20c, and 50c. The 1c and 2c coins were bronze, the others were cupro-nickel. To ease transition, the 5c, 10c, and 20c were the same size as the sixpence, shilling and florin that they respectively replaced, and until 1970, the ten-cent coin bore the additional legend &quot;One Shilling&quot;. The obverse designs of all the coins featured Arnold Machin&#x27;s portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, with the legend ELIZABETH II NEW ZEALAND [date]. The reverse sides of coins introduced in 1967 did not follow the designs that were originally intended for them. Those modern art and sculpture themed designs were leaked to a newspaper and met a very negative public reaction. The final releases were given more conservative designs in line with public expectations.

In 1986, New Zealand adopted Raphael Maklouf&#x27;s new portrait of the Queen. The 1c and 2c coins were last minted for circulation in 1987, with collector coins being made for 1988. The coins were demonetised on 30 April 1990. The lack of 1c and 2c coins meant that cash transactions were normally rounded to the nearest 5c (10c from 2006), a process known as Swedish rounding.

On 11 February 1991, aluminium-bronze $1 and $2 coins were introduced to replace existing $1 and $2 notes. In 1999, Ian Rank-Broadley&#x27;s portrait of the Queen was introduced and the legend rearranged to read &quot;&quot;.

On 11 November 2004 the Reserve Bank announced that it proposed to take the 5c coin out of circulation and to make the 50c, 20c and 10c coins smaller and use plated steel to make them lighter. After a three-month public submission period that ended on 4 February 2005, the Reserve Bank announced on 31 March that it would go ahead with the proposed changes. The changeover period started on 31 July 2006, with the old coins usable until 31 October 2006. The old 50c, 20c, 10c and 5c pieces are now no longer legal tender, but are still redeemable at the Reserve Bank. Prior to the change over, these coins were similar, save for the legend and reverse artwork, to international (mainly Commonwealth) coins of the same British-derived sizes, which led to coins from other currencies, particularly older coins, being accepted by vending machines and many retailers.

Commemorative coins, with face values of 50c, were issued in 2015 and 2018 to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli landings and of Armistice Day.

=== Future ===
After the death of Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022, the Reserve Bank said it would exhaust its existing coin stocks before introducing new coins featuring King Charles III. Based on current stock levels, this would likely be several years away.

==Banknotes==
===History===
In 1967, notes were introduced in denominations of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $100, with all except the $5 replacing their pound predecessors. The original series of dollar notes featured on the obverse a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II wearing Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Kokoshnik tiara, King George&#x27;s VI festoon necklace, and Queen Mary&#x27;s floret earrings, while the reverse featured native birds and plants. The notes were changed slightly in 1981 due to a change of printer (from De La Rue to Bradbury, Wilkinson &amp; Co.)—the most noticeable difference being the portrait based upon a photograph by Peter Grugeon, in which Queen Elizabeth II is wearing Grand Duchess Vladimir&#x27;s tiara and Queen Victoria&#x27;s golden jubilee necklace. The $50 note was added in 1983 to fill the long gap between the $20 and the $100 notes. $1 and $2 notes were discontinued in 1991 after being replaced with coins.

A new series of notes, known as Series 5 was introduced in 1992. The obverse of each note featured a notable New Zealander, while the reverse featured a native New Zealand bird and New Zealand scenery. The Queen remained on the $20 note. In 1999, series 6 polymer notes replaced the paper notes. The designs remained much the same, but were changed slightly to accommodate new security features, with the most obvious changes being the two transparent windows.

In 2015–16, new Series 7 notes were issued, refreshing the note design and improving security features. As of 2021, Series 6 and 7 notes are currently legal tender.

In September 2022, following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, the Reserve Bank said it would exhaust its existing stocks of $20 notes before introducing new notes featuring King Charles III.

=== Current circulating banknotes ===

The most recent issue of New Zealand banknotes is the seventh series, first released in October 2015 and May 2016.

==In foreign exchange markets==
===History===
With the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, both Australia and New Zealand converted the mostly-fixed foreign exchange regimes to a moving peg against the US dollar. In September 1974, Australia moved to a peg against a basket of currencies called the trade weighted index (TWI) in an effort to reduce fluctuations associated with its peg to the US dollar. The peg to the TWI was changed to a moving peg in November 1976, causing the actual value of the peg to be periodically adjusted.

===Current exchange rates===
===In currency trading===
The New Zealand dollar contributes greatly to the total global exchange market—far in excess of New Zealand&#x27;s relative share of population or global GDP.

According to the Bank for International Settlements, the New Zealand dollar&#x27;s share of global foreign exchange market daily turnover in 2016 was 2.1% (up from 1.6% in 2010) giving it a rank of 11th. Trading in the currency has climbed steadily since the same survey in 1998 when the NZD&#x27;s ranking was 17th and the share of turnover was just 0.2%.

<doc id="161588" wikidata="Q372626" url="?curid=161588" title="Theora">
<text>Theora is a free lossy video compression format. It was developed by the Xiph.Org Foundation and distributed without licensing fees alongside their other free and open media projects, including the Vorbis audio format and the Ogg container.

The libtheora video codec is the reference implementation of the Theora video compression format developed by the Xiph.Org Foundation.

Theora was derived from the formerly proprietary VP3 codec, released into the public domain by On2 Technologies. It is broadly comparable in design and bitrate efficiency to MPEG-4 Part 2, early versions of Windows Media Video, and RealVideo while it lacked some of the features present in some of these other codecs. It is comparable in open standards philosophy to the BBC&#x27;s Dirac codec.

Theora was named after Theora Jones, Edison Carter&#x27;s Controller on the &quot;Max Headroom&quot; television program.

==Technical details==
Theora is a variable-bitrate, DCT-based video compression scheme. Like most common video codecs, Theora used chroma subsampling, block-based motion compensation and an 8-by-8 DCT block. Pixels are grouped into various structures, namely blocks, super blocks, and macroblocks. Theora supports intra-coded frames (&quot;keyframes&quot;) and forward-predictive frames, but not bi-predictive frames which are found in H.264 and VC-1. Theora also does not support interlacing, or bit-depths larger than 8 bits per component.

Theora video streams can be stored in any suitable container format, but they are most commonly found in the Ogg container with Vorbis or FLAC audio streams. This combination provided a completely open, royalty-free multimedia format. It can also be used with the Matroska container.

The Theora video-compression format is compatible with the VP3 video-compression format, which consisted of a backward-compatible superset. Theora is a superset of VP3, and VP3 streams (with some minor syntactic modifications) can be converted into Theora streams without recompression (but not vice versa). VP3 video compression can be decoded using Theora implementations, but Theora video compression usually cannot be decoded using old VP3 implementations.

==History==

Theora&#x27;s predecessor &quot;On2 TrueMotion VP3&quot; was originally a proprietary and patent-encumbered video codec developed by On2 Technologies. VP3.1 was introduced in May 2000 and followed three months later by the VP3.2 release, which was the basis for Theora.

===Move to free software===
In August 2001, On2 Technologies announced that they would release an open source version of their VP3.2 video compression algorithm. In September 2001, On2 Technologies published the source code of the VP3.2 codec under the VP3.2 Public License 0.1, a custom open-source license. The license only granted the right to modify the source code if the resultant larger work continued to support playback of VP3.2 data.

In March 2002, On2 responded to the public&#x27;s reception by relicensing the VP3 codec under the GNU Lesser General Public License. In June 2002, On2 donated VP3 to the Xiph.Org Foundation and offered it under the Ogg Vorbis BSD-style license. On2 also made an irrevocable, royalty-free license grant for any patent claims it might have over the software and any derivatives, allowing anyone to use any VP3-derived codec for any purpose. In August 2002, On2 entered into an agreement with the Xiph.Org Foundation to make VP3 the basis of a new, free video codec, called Theora. On2 declared Theora to be VP3&#x27;s successor. On 3 October 2002, On2 and Xiph announced the completion and availability of the initial alpha code release of &quot;libtheora&quot;, Theora&#x27;s reference implementation.

There is no formal specification for VP3&#x27;s bitstream format beyond the VP3 source code published by On2 Technologies. In 2003, Mike Melanson created an incomplete description of the VP3 bitstream format and decoding process at a higher level than source code, with some help from On2 and Xiph.Org Foundation. The Theora specification adopted some portions of this VP3 description.

A successor to Theora, Daala, was later merged into AV1.

===Theora I specification===

The Theora I bitstream format was frozen in June 2004 after the libtheora 1.0alpha3 release. Videos encoded with any version of the libtheora since the alpha3 will be compatible with any future player. This is also true for videos encoded with any implementation of the Theora I specification since the format freeze. The &quot;Theora I Specification&quot; was completely published in 2004. Any later changes in the specification are minor updates.

The Theora reference implementation libtheora spent several years in alpha and beta status. The first alpha version was released on 25 September 2002 and the first beta version was released on 22 September 2007. The first stable release of libtheora was made in November 2008. Work then focused on improving the codec&#x27;s performance in the &quot;Thusnelda&quot; branch, which was released as version 1.1 in September 2009 as the second stable libtheora release. This release brought some technical improvements and new features, such as the new rate control module and the two-pass rate control.

The codename for the next version of libtheora was &quot;Ptalarbvorm&quot;.

Theora was well established as a video format in open-source applications, and became the format used for Wikipedia&#x27;s video content before replaced by VP9. However, the proposed adoption of Theora as part of the baseline video support in HTML5 resulted in controversy.

=== Legacy ===
In October 2023, Google announced intent to remove Theora support from Chromium (finalizing removal by Google Chrome 123), with Firefox following suit. Google developers claimed that despite lack of adoption, Theora made a case for open and royalty-free codecs like AV1.

==Performance==
===Encoding performance===
Evaluations of the VP3
and early Theora encoders
found that their subjective visual quality was inferior to that of contemporary video codecs. The performance characteristics of the Theora 1.0 reference implementation are dominated mostly by implementation problems inherited from the original VP3 code base. Work that lead up to the 1.1 stable release focused on improving on or eliminating these. A May 2009 review of this work by Xiph developer Chris Montgomery claimed a considerable improvement in quality, both subjectively and as measured by PSNR, by improving the forward DCT and quantisation matrices. More recently however, Xiph developers compared the 1.1 Theora encoder to YouTube&#x27;s H.264 and H.263+ encoders, in response to concerns raised in 2009 about Theora&#x27;s inferior performance by Chris DiBona, a Google employee. They found the results from Theora to be nearly the same as YouTube&#x27;s H.264 output, and much better than the H.263+ output.

The differences in quality, bitrate and file size between a YouTube H.264 video and a transcoded Ogg video file are very small.

===Playback performance===
There was an open-source VHDL code base for a hardware Theora decoder in development. It began as a 2006 Google Summer of Code project, and it has been developed on both the Nios II and LEON processors. However, there are currently no Theora decoder chips in production, and portable media players, smartphones and similar devices with limited computing power rely on such chips to provide efficient playback.

==Playback==
===Web browsers===

As originally recommended by HTML 5, these browsers support Theora when embedded by the codice_1 element:

* Mozilla Firefox 3.5 and later versions including Firefox for mobile (Fennec). Theora was disabled by default in Firefox 126, and support may be removed in the future due to low usage.
* Google Chrome as of version 3.0.182.2 including Chromium as of 14 July 2009. Chrome 120 disabled support for Theora by default and the complete removal is expected in version 123.
*Tizen browser
* SeaMonkey as of version 2.0.
* Konqueror 4.4.2
* Opera as of version 10.50. It was also supported in Opera 9.5 experimental video builds. Stopped supporting Theora after version 107.
* GNOME Web uses WebKitGTK+ as its rendering engine. As WebKitGTK+ uses GStreamer to implement the HTML5 media player, and all the formats GStreamer supports (including Theora) are available in browser.
* Midori is another example of a browser that supports Theora by using WebKitGTK+.

===Supporting media frameworks===
* DirectShow with use of OpenCodecs
* GStreamer supported via Theora or FFmpeg module, supports GStreamer based applications e.g. Totem and Songbird
* Phonon
* QuickTime (including but not limited to Safari) with use of Xiph QuickTime Components

===Supporting applications===
* FFmpeg (own implementation)
* Helix Player
* Miro Media Player (formerly known as Democracy Player)
* MPlayer and front-ends
* Totem, Moovida and all GStreamer-based players
* VLC (native support)
* xine and all libxine-based players like Kaffeine
* Dragon Player and all Phonon-based players

==Encoding==
There are several third-party programs that support encoding through libtheora:

The libtheora library contains the reference implementation of the Theora specification for encoding and decoding. libtheora was developed by the Xiph.Org Foundation. The library was released under the terms of a BSD-style license.

Also, several media frameworks have support for Theora.

* The open-source ffdshow audio/video decoder is capable of encoding Theora videos using its Video for Windows (VFW) multi-codec interface within popular AVI editing programs. It supports both encoding and decoding Theora video streams and uses Theora&#x27;s alpha 4 libraries. However, many of the more refined features of Theora are not available to the user in ffdshow&#x27;s interface.
* The GStreamer framework has support for parsing raw Theora streams, encoding and decoding raw Theora streams to/from YUV video

==Editing==
==Streaming==
The following streaming media servers are capable of streaming Theora video:

== Makers==
Elphel is the main maker of cameras that record in theora.

<text>Singapore Airlines (abbreviation: SIA or SQ) is the flag carrier of Singapore with its hub located at Changi Airport. The airline is notable for highlighting the Singapore Girl as its central figure in the corporate branding segment and not significantly changing its livery throughout its history. Considered to be one of the world&#x27;s best carriers, the airline is ranked as a 5-star airline as well as ranked as the world&#x27;s best airline by Skytrax five times. The airline operates a variety of Airbus and Boeing aircraft, namely the Airbus A350-900, Airbus A380, Boeing 737 MAX 8, Boeing 737-800, Boeing 747-400 Freighter, Boeing 777-300ER and Boeing 787-10. The airline has been a member of Star Alliance since April 2000.

Singapore Airlines Group has more than 20 subsidiaries, including numerous airline-related subsidiaries. SIA Engineering Company handles maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) business across nine countries with a portfolio of 27 joint ventures including with Boeing and Rolls-Royce. Singapore Airlines Cargo operates SIA&#x27;s freighter fleet and manages the cargo-hold capacity in SIA&#x27;s passenger aircraft. Scoot, a wholly owned subsidiary, operates as a low-cost carrier.

Singapore Airlines was the first to put the Airbus A380—the world&#x27;s largest passenger aircraft—as well as the Boeing 787-10 into service, and is the only operator of the ultra-long-range (ULR) version of the Airbus A350-900. It ranks amongst the top 15 carriers worldwide in terms of revenue passenger kilometres and is ranked tenth in the world for international passengers carried. Singapore Airlines was voted as the Skytrax World&#x27;s Best Airline Cabin Crew 2019. The airline has also won the second and fourth positions as the World&#x27;s Best Airlines and World&#x27;s Cleanest Airlines respectively in 2019. In 2023, the airline for the fifth time took the prize of &quot;Best Airline&quot; as well as the &quot;Best First Class Airline&quot; by Skytrax.

On 1 February 2025, Fortune magazine published the annual World’s Most Admired Companies with Singapore Airlines ranked 28th. In the airline category, Singapore Airlines was the world&#x27;s second most admired airline, behind Delta Air Lines, and ahead of KLM-Lufthansa.

==History==
==Corporate affairs==
Singapore Airlines is majority-owned by the Singapore government&#x27;s investment and holding company Temasek Holdings, which holds 55% of voting stock as of 31 March 2020.

Nevertheless, while the government holds a golden share via the country&#x27;s Ministry of Finance, it stressed its non-interference in the management of the company, a point emphasised by Lee Kuan Yew when he said the Singapore Changi Airport&#x27;s front-runner status as an aviation hub is more important than SIA. However, he was personally involved in easing tensions between the company and its pilots in the early 2000s, warned the airline to cut costs, and made public his advice to the airline to divest from its subsidiary companies.

Singapore Airlines is headquartered at Airline House,&lt;ref name=&quot;Annual Report FY2021/22&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a former hangar at the Changi Airport in Singapore.

In November 2022, Tata Group reached an agreement with Singapore Airlines which will see Indian full-service carrier Vistara merge with Tata-owned Air India to form a single entity with an expanded network and broader fleet. The merger officially took place on 12 November 2024. 

In November 2024, Singapore Airlines said it was feeling the impact of the aviation industry’s widespread supply-chain issues, estimating it is likely to have five fewer aircraft than planned by the end of the 2024 fiscal year, with 204 jets in fleet, due to delivery delays.

=== Business trends ===
The key trends for Singapore Airlines are (as of the financial year ending 31 March):
===Branding===
Branding and publicity efforts have revolved primarily around flight crew, in contrast to most other airlines, who tend to emphasise aircraft and services in general. In particular, the promotion of its female flight attendants known as Singapore Girls has been widely successful and is a common feature in most of the airline&#x27;s advertisements and publications.

The Singapore Airlines logo is a stylised bird inspired by a keris, a dagger that is a cultural symbol of the region. The keris is central in Singapore Airlines&#x27; branding, such as the SilverKris lounge and the KrisWorld entertainment system. The logo has remained unchanged since Singapore Airlines&#x27; inception from the split of Malaysia–Singapore Airlines, except for a minor tweak in 1987.

===Corporate livery===
====Original MSA livery (1966–1972)====
In May 1966 Malaysian Airways (MAL) became Malaysia-Singapore Airlines (MSA). The original MSA livery features a yellow MSA logo on the vertical stabiliser and a black nose, with a white and grey fuselage. All aircraft in this original livery have been repainted or retired.

====Second-generation livery (1972–1987)====
Following the spinoff of Malaysia Airlines, Singapore Airlines introduced a second-generation livery features a blue and yellow strip on the windows on the white fuselage, with the stylised bird logo in yellow. The word &quot;Singapore Airlines&quot; was stylised in italics.

====Third-generation livery (1987–present)====
The current livery has only some minor changes, and the gold-blue color scheme and the bird logo have been retained. In the change to the current livery, the yellow rear fuselage was changed to metallic gold with a new orange line added above it. The same orange line was also added behind the bird logo. The font typeface of the word &quot;Singapore Airlines&quot; was modified.

However, in 2005, the livery received a minor update where the &quot;Singapore Airlines&quot; wording was enlarged and shifted closer towards the front of the aircraft, and the bird logo was also enlarged. The blue/gold sections of the tail is cut horizontally. The first set of windows are also no longer left out from the blue/gold/yellow strip. The engine logos were also subsequently removed since October 2007.

==Destinations==
Singapore Airlines flies on five continents from its primary hub in Singapore.

After the Asian financial crisis in 1997, Singapore Airlines discontinued its routes to Berlin, Darwin, Cairns, Hangzhou, Kagoshima, and Sendai. Toronto was discontinued earlier, in 1992, due to a petition from Air Canada. During the SARS outbreak in 2003–04, Singapore Airlines ceased flights to Brussels, Chicago, Las Vegas, Hiroshima, Kaohsiung, Madrid, Mauritius, Shenzhen, Surabaya, and Vienna. Singapore Airlines discontinued flights to Vancouver and Amritsar in 2009, and São Paulo in 2016.

The airline has a key role in the Kangaroo Route, operating flights between Australia and the United Kingdom via Singapore. It flew 11.0% of all international traffic into and out of Australia in the month ended March 2008. As of summer 2023, it operated more flights to Australia than any other country. Singapore Airlines also operated flights between Singapore and Wellington, New Zealand via Canberra until May 2018, when the intermediate stop was changed to Melbourne. This route was known as the Capital Express. The route was suspended in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Singapore Airlines has taken advantage of liberal bilateral aviation agreements between Singapore and Thailand, and with the United Arab Emirates, to offer more onward connections from Bangkok and Dubai, respectively.

In 2005 AirAsia, a low-cost carrier (LCC) based in Malaysia, accused Singapore Airlines of double standards, when it claimed that the Government of Singapore attempted to keep it out of the Singapore market, despite desiring to fly routes out of Australia itself. In 2007 Singapore Airlines welcomed the liberalisation of the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur route, previously restricted to Singapore Airlines and Malaysia Airlines under rules designed to protect the state-run airlines from competition for over three decades, accounting for about 85% of the over 200 flight frequencies then operated. A highly lucrative route for LCCs due to its short distance and heavy traffic as the fourth-busiest in Asia, bringing Singapore Airline&#x27;s capacity share on the route down to about 46.7%, Malaysia Airlines&#x27; down to 25.3%, and increase to 17.3% to the three LCCs now permitted on the route, and the remainder shared by three other airlines as of 22 September 2008. Until 1 December 2008, Singapore Airlines operated six flights per day. Singapore Airlines operated four flights per day plans from 1 December 2008 when the route was completely opened, while its sister airline SilkAir also operated four flights per day. Malaysia Airlines, the main opponent to the liberalisation of the route and deemed to be the party that stands to lose the most, continued to codeshare with both Singapore Airlines and SilkAir on the route.

Singapore Airlines operated two of the longest flights in the world, both nonstop flights from Singapore to Los Angeles and Newark with Airbus A340-500 aircraft. All A340-500s were phased out in 2013 and nonstop flights to both destinations were terminated. Nonstop service to Los Angeles was terminated on 20 October 2013 (the airline continues to serve Los Angeles from Singapore via Tokyo-Narita), and the nonstop service to Newark was terminated on 23 November 2013 in favour of a Singapore-New York JFK route via Frankfurt.

From 23 October 2016, Singapore Airlines resumed non-stop flights from Singapore to the United States, beginning with San Francisco. The route is flown by the A350-900 aircraft and includes Business, Premium Economy, and Economy classes. This was followed by the resumption of non-stop flights to Newark and Los Angeles from 11 October 2018 and 2 November 2018, respectively, with the delivery of the Airbus A350-900ULRs, allowing the airline to operate two of the world&#x27;s longest non-stop flights again.

=== World&#x27;s longest non-stop scheduled flight routes ===
On 14 October 2015, Singapore Airlines announced plans to resume the world&#x27;s longest non-stop flight between Singapore and New York – a 15,300 km (9,500 mi), 19-hour route that the airline had dropped in 2013. A340-500 aircraft were formerly employed to serve this route until their retirement in 2013. 

SIA resumed the route following the acquisition of new Airbus A350-900ULR aircraft on 18 October 2018. At the time, Singapore Airlines Flights 21 and 22 was the longest scheduled route in the world. It was suspended again in March 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic, and resumed in March 2022.

On 9 November 2020, SIA relaunched the nonstop flights between Changi Airport and New York, but this time to John F. Kennedy International Airport, three times a week. The route, Singapore Airlines Flights 23 and 24, is the longest scheduled flight in the world.

==Services==

===Cabins===
Singapore Airlines offers five classes of service – Suites, first class, business class, premium economy class, and economy class. Major upgrades to its cabin and in-flight service were announced on 17 October 2006, constituting the first major overhaul in over eight years and costing the airline approximately S$570 million. Initially planned for the Airbus A380-800&#x27;s introduction into service in 2006, and subsequently on the Boeing 777-300ER, the postponement of the first A380-800 delivery meant it had to be introduced with the launch of the first Boeing 777-300ER with the airline on 5 December 2006 between Singapore and Paris.

On 9 July 2013, Singapore Airlines, in collaboration with design firms James Park Associates and DesignworksUSA, released new cabin products for the first, business, and economy classes. They debuted on the carrier&#x27;s new Boeing 777-300ERs delivered from 2013 onwards, with London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport being their maiden route. The product was later introduced on its Airbus A350s and extended to all its older Boeing 777-300ERs.

On 2 November 2017, Singapore Airlines released new cabin products for the Airbus A380-800. These new changes cost roughly S$1.16 billion and were rolled out in response to growing competition from Middle Eastern carriers such as Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways. The seating configuration in the new design consists of 6 suites and 78 business class seats on the upper deck, with 44 Premium Economy Class seats and 3-4-3 Economy Class seats on the lower deck. The new changes were rolled out on the five new Airbus A380 aircraft that were delivered to Singapore Airlines, while the existing A380 fleet had these new products retrofitted until 2020. Sydney was the first city served with the new product on 18 December 2017.

====Business class====
The current version of the Business Class was unveiled on 9 July 2013 and is available on refitted Boeing B777-300ERs and the Airbus A350-900. Features include a power socket and ports all in one panel, stowage beside the seat, two new seating positions, arranged in a 1-2-1 configuration and an 18-inch in-flight entertainment screen. The seat has a recline of 132 degrees and can be folded into a length bed.

Long haul business class is available on Airbus A380 and refitted Boeing 777-200ER aircraft, where a fully flat bed is available in a 1-2-1 configuration featuring of seat width. These seats are forward-facing, in contrast to the herring-bone configuration used by several other airlines offering flat beds in business class. The leather seats feature a diagonal screen-size personal television, in-seat power supply and two USB ports.

On eight Airbus A380 aircraft, the first of which entered service in October 2011, Singapore Airlines dedicated the entire upper deck to the Business class cabin, unlike the original configuration&#x27;s upper deck shared by 16 rows of business class and 11 rows of economy at the rear.

Medium and short haul business class layouts are available on Airbus A330-300, Boeing 777-300 and all unrefitted Boeing 777-200 aircraft, configured in 2-2-2 layout and with iPod connectivity, only available in the A330. The Business Class seat is lie-flat at an eight-degree incline, featuring Krisworld on a screen.

On 28 March 2018, the new regional business class was unveiled following the delivery of the first Boeing 787-10. These new seats manufactured by Stelia Aerospace are arranged in a forward-facing 1-2-1 staggered configuration, providing every passenger direct aisle access. Each seat measures up to in width and can be reclined into a fully flat bed. There are also adjustable dividers at the centre seats to provide passengers with a &quot;customised level of privacy&quot;.

Unveiled on 2 November 2017, the new A380 business-class seats were being progressively rolled out on the Airbus A380-800 fleet. There are 78 Business class seats on the aircraft, offered in a 1-2-1 configuration behind the Singapore Airlines Suites on the upper deck. The seats, designed by JPA Design and upholstered with Poltrona Frau grain leather, can be reclined into a fully flat bed. There are also adjustable dividers between the centre seats that can either be fully raised, half raised or fully lowered. When the centre divider is fully lowered, the pair of centre seats directly behind each bulkhead can form double beds. There is also an touchscreen LCD TV and a panel containing power and USB port, as well as an NFC reader for contactless payments.

In November 2024, Singapore Airlines pledged to invest S$1.1 billion ($828 million) to overhaul the seats in its long-haul aircraft, including all-new first- and business-class product.

====Economy class====

A new seat with slight changes was announced to be retrofitted on Singapore Airlines&#x27;s A380 and eventually become available on newer versions of their A350 and 787 aircraft. Features include more legroom and back support, a six-way adjustable headrest, and foldable wings. The Economy Class seat also features a more contemporary fabric seat cover design. The screen size remains the same, yet handsets from the previous iteration of seats have been removed.

A redesign of the economy class seat was unveiled on 9 July 2013 alongside new first and business class products. Features include of legroom, slimmer seats, an adjustable headrest, and an touch-screen inflight entertainment system which is also controllable with a video touch-screen handset as well as brand new KrisWorld software. The new seats were originally announced to be available exclusively onboard factory-fresh Airbus A350-900 and refitted Boeing 777-300ER.

The previous generation economy class seats on unrefitted Airbus A380-800, and Airbus A330-300 are wide, have in-seat power and have a personal television screen which has a non-intrusive reading light under it, which can be used by folding the screen outwards. These are configured 3-4-3 on the lower deck of the Airbus A380, 3-3-3 on the Boeing 777, and 2-4-2 on the Airbus A330, as well as the upper deck of the Airbus A380. Other features include an independent cup-holder (separate from the fold-out table), a USB port, and a power socket, as well as an iPod port exclusively on board the Airbus A330.

Singapore Airlines introduced a similar design on board the Boeing 777 aircraft through its ongoing cabin retrofit program. The Boeing 777–300 was the first model to undergo refit and had introduced the product on the Singapore–Sydney route on 22 July 2009. They are equipped with slightly smaller 9-inch screens (which are, however, larger than the 6.1-inch VGA screens on unrefitted aircraft) and AVOD in each seat. The seats are installed onboard all B777-200ERs and all but one B777-200.

===Catering===

Singapore Airlines offers a wide array of food options on each flight. Regional dishes are often served on their respective flights, such as the &quot;Kyo-Kaiseki&quot;, &quot;Shi Quan Shi Mei&quot;, and &quot;Shahi Thali&quot; meals, available for first-class passengers on flights to Japan, China and India, respectively.

SIA has also introduced the Popular Local Fare culinary programme offering local favourites to passengers in all classes flying from selected destinations. The dishes featured in this programme include Singaporean &quot;hawker&quot; fare such as &quot;Teochew porridge&quot;, &quot;bak chor mee&quot;, &quot;Hainanese chicken rice&quot;, and &quot;Satay&quot; (meat skewers) on certain routes.

They published a cookbook in 2010 titled &quot;Above &amp; Beyond: A Collection of Recipes from the Singapore Airlines Culinary Panel&quot;.

Passengers in Suites, First and Business class may choose to use the &quot;Book the Cook&quot; service, where specific dishes may be selected in advance from a more extensive menu. Premium Economy class passengers may also choose to use the &quot;Premium Economy Book the Cook&quot;. This service is only available on selected flights.

===In-flight entertainment===
KrisWorld is Singapore Airlines&#x27; in-flight entertainment system, introduced in 1997 on Boeing 747–400, Airbus A310-300, Airbus A340-300 and Boeing 777–200 aircraft. KrisWorld overhauled Singapore Airlines&#x27; in-flight experience with a new, cheaper entertainment solution that would supersede the primitive Thales entertainment systems on offer at that time by Virgin Atlantic and Emirates.

The original KrisWorld provided 14 movies, 36 television programmes, and five cartoons, as well as many Super NES games, KrisFone and fax, text news and flight path in all classes. The original KrisWorld was subsequently upgraded to feature Wisemen 3000, an audio and video-on-demand version of the KrisWorld system featured exclusively in First and Raffles Class cabins, then progressively introduced into Economy Class in 747 cabins and selected 777 cabins.

In 2002, Singapore Airlines introduced a re-branding of the KrisWorld system. Named Enhanced KrisWorld, it featured additional movies, television programming, music and games, and was installed on Boeing 747-400 and selected Boeing 777-200 aircraft. Connexion by Boeing, an in-flight Internet service, was introduced in 2005. Live television streaming was proposed on Connexion, but this service was discontinued in December 2006. Since October 2005, Singapore Airlines has offered complimentary language lessons by Berlitz. and, starting December 2005, live text-news feeds.

In 2007, a new KrisWorld based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux was introduced, featuring a new interface, additional programming and audio and video on demand as standard. Widescreen personal video systems were installed in all cabins, including 23-inch LCD monitors in First Class, 15-inch monitors in Business Class, and 10.6-inch monitors in Economy Class. The new KrisWorld is available on Airbus A330, Airbus A380 and Boeing 777-300ER. Features include:

* Widescreen LCD TV with 1280 × 768 resolution
* A range of movies, TV, music, games and interactive programs
* Built-in office software, based on the StarOffice Productivity Suite for use with the USB port
* In-seat AC power ports

A $400 million new KrisWorld entertainment system was unveiled in 2012. This comes from a major deal with Panasonic Avionics, which will provide the latest Panasonic eX3 systems. The eX3 system features a larger screen with much higher resolution, wide touch-screen controllers, new software, and, above all, in-flight connectivity. Singapore Airlines launched its in-flight connectivity in August 2012. Passengers are now able to make phone calls, send text messages and access the Internet for a fee. The new eX3 systems are unveiled alongside the new cabin product and are available on the Airbus A350-900 and refitted B777-300ER aircraft. In-flight connectivity is offered on the aforementioned two aircraft as well as select Airbus A380s.

Apart for winning the best airline, Singapore Airlines also scooped the top awards for &quot;Best Cabin Staff&quot; and &quot;Best First Class in World&quot;. They also won the &quot;Best Airline in Asia&quot; in the same award ceremony.

On 29 January 2025, SIA was named the top airline, securing the 28th position on Fortune’s list of the world’s most admired companies.

==Controversies==
In February 2019, TechCrunch reported that the Singapore Airlines mobile app in the iOS App Store was using session-replay functionality to record users&#x27; activities and send the data to Israeli firm Glassbox without the users&#x27; informed consent, compromising users&#x27; privacy and contravening the rules of the iOS App Store.

== Accidents and incidents ==
Singapore Airlines has experienced the following incidents and accidents:
* 13 July 1982 – A Boeing 747 operating as Singapore Airlines flight SQ21A between Singapore and Melbourne flew into volcanic ash from erupting Galunggung volcano and experienced multiple engine failures. A two-engine emergency landing was made at Jakarta and all four engines were replaced.
* 26 March 1991 – Singapore Airlines Flight 117, an Airbus A310-300 registered as 9V-STP, was hijacked by militants en route from Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport to Singapore Changi International Airport, where it was stormed by the Singapore Special Operations Force. All hijackers were killed in the operation, with no fatalities amongst the passengers and crew.

* 31 October 2000 – Flight 006, a Boeing 747-400 registered as 9V-SPK, attempted to take off on the wrong runway at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport (previously Chiang Kai-shek International Airport) while departing for Los Angeles International Airport. It collided with the construction equipment that was parked on a closed runway, killing 83 of the 179 on board and injuring a further 71 people. This was the first fatal accident involving a Singapore Airlines aircraft. The aircraft 9V-SPK was painted in a &quot;Tropical&quot; promotional livery at the time of the accident. The only other aircraft painted with the promotional livery, another 747-400 registered 9V-SPL, was immediately repainted with standard Singapore Airlines livery.
* 12 March 2003 – A Boeing 747-400 operating as Singapore Airlines Flight 286 from Auckland International Airport to Changi Airport was involved in a tailstrike while taking off from Auckland&#x27;s Runway 23L, causing severe damage to the aircraft&#x27;s tail and damaging the APU (Auxiliary Power Unit), causing in-flight APU fire warnings. The flight returned to Auckland with no fatalities or serious injuries on board. The cause was later determined to be an error in the pilots&#x27; calculations of the aircraft&#x27;s takeoff weight and reference speeds, which caused the pilots to rotate the aircraft prematurely.
* 27 June 2016 – Singapore Airlines Flight 368, a Boeing 777-300ER registered as 9V-SWB with 222 passengers and 19 crew on board, suffered an engine oil leak during a flight from Singapore to Milan. The oil-leak alarm was sounded above Malaysia, two hours into the flight. During the emergency landing at the point of origin, Singapore Changi Airport, the right engine caught fire, leading to the right-wing being engulfed in flames. The fire was extinguished within five minutes after the plane landed. No injuries were reported. The aircraft was substantially damaged and repaired.
* 6 May 2022 – Singapore Airlines Flight 439, a Boeing 737-800, sustained a tailstrike during takeoff from runway 20 at Tribhuvan International Airport. The resulting incident depressurized the aircraft and forced it to divert to Kolkata, India. There were no injuries among the 165 passengers and 8 crew members on board. The tailstrike occurred during the takeoff at the airport was due to over-rotation by the PF, coupled with a likely tailwind with a component of about 10 knots along the runway. The rotation pitch rate was, at times, greater than 5° per second as recorded by the FDR. The pitch angle of 11.07° recorded also exceeded the 7° – 9° normal pitch angle range.
* 28 September 2022 – A drunken passenger on board the Singapore Airlines Flight 33 from San Francisco to Singapore made bomb threats and also inappropriately touched other people. The Republic of Singapore Air Force scrambled their F-16 Fighting Falcons to escort the plane to Changi Airport where the airliner was searched and the threat was declared to be false thereafter.
* 25 October 2022 – A Boeing 777-300ER registered as 9V-SWH and operating as SQ 319 from London Heathrow Airport to Changi Airport in Singapore with 280 occupants on board, diverted to Hang Nadim Airport in Batam due to adverse surface wind conditions and poor visibility caused by a thunderstorm over Singapore. As the aircraft approached Batam, the weather conditions had similarly deteriorated due to a thunderstorm over Batam and after three unsuccessful attempts at landing, the aircraft landed with a fuel quantity that was &quot;significantly below&quot; the final reserve fuel requirement of 3,024 kg. There were no injuries on board or any damage to the aircraft.

* 21 May 2024 – Singapore Airlines Flight 321, a Boeing 777-300ER registered as 9V-SWM with 211 passengers and 18 crew members on board from London Heathrow Airport to Changi Airport in Singapore, was diverted to Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok after encountering severe turbulence en route over the Irrawaddy Basin in Myanmar. Of the 229 people on board, 1 passenger died. All of the other 228 occupants survived, but 104 passengers and crew members were injured.

<text>The  ( , ; &#x27;Overman&#x27; or &#x27;Superman&#x27;) is a concept in the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. In his 1883 book, &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; (), Nietzsche has his character Zarathustra posit the as a goal for humanity to set for itself. The represents a shift from otherworldly Christian values and manifests the grounded human ideal. The is someone who has &quot;crossed over&quot; the bridge, from the comfortable &quot;house on the lake&quot; (the comfortable, easy, mindless acceptance of what a person has been taught, and what everyone else believes) to the mountains of unrest and solitude.

== In English ==

In 1896, Alexander Tille made the first English translation of &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, rendering as &quot;Beyond-Man&quot;. In 1909, Thomas Common translated it as &quot;Superman&quot;, following the terminology of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s 1903 stage play &quot;Man and Superman&quot;. Walter Kaufmann lambasted this translation in the 1950s for two reasons: first, the failure of the English prefix &quot;super&quot; to capture the nuance of the German (though in Latin, its meaning of &quot;above&quot; or &quot;beyond&quot; is closer to the German); and second, for promoting misidentification of Nietzsche&#x27;s concept with the comic-book character Superman. Kaufmann and others preferred to translate as &quot;overman&quot;. A translation like &quot;superior humans&quot; might better fit the concept of Nietzsche as he unfolds his narrative. Scholars continue to employ both terms, some simply opting to reproduce the German word.

The German prefix can have connotations of superiority, transcendence, excessiveness, or intensity, depending on the words to which it is attached. &quot;Mensch&quot; refers to a human being, not a male specifically as it is still sometimes erroneously believed. The adjective means super-human: beyond human strength or out of proportion to humanity.

==This-worldliness==

Nietzsche introduces the concept of the in contrast to his understanding of the other-worldliness of Christianity: Zarathustra proclaims the will of the to give meaning to life on earth, and admonishes his audience to ignore those who promise other-worldly fulfillment to draw them away from the earth.

Zarathustra declares that the Christian escape from this world also required the invention of an immortal soul separate from the earthly body. This led to the abnegation and mortification of the body, or asceticism. Zarathustra further links the to the body and to interpreting the soul as simply an aspect of the body.

==Death of God and the creation of new values==

Zarathustra ties the to the death of God. While the concept of God was the ultimate expression of other-worldly values and their underlying instincts, belief in God nevertheless did give meaning to life for a time. &quot;God is dead&quot; means that the idea of God can no longer provide values. Nietzsche refers to this crucial paradigm shift as a reevaluation of values.

In order to avoid a relapse into Platonic idealism or asceticism, the creation of these new values cannot be motivated by the same instincts that gave birth to those tables of values. Instead, they must be motivated by a love of this world and of life. Whereas Nietzsche diagnosed the Christian value system as a reaction against life and hence destructive in a sense, the new values that the will be responsible for will be life-affirming and creative (see Nietzschean affirmation). Through realizing this new set of values, the is perfect because they have mastered all human obstacles.

==As a goal ==
Zarathustra first announces the as a goal humanity can set for itself. All human life would be given meaning by how it advanced a new generation of human beings. The aspiration of a woman would be to give birth to an , for example; her relationships with men would be judged by this standard.

Zarathustra contrasts the with the degenerate &quot;last man&quot; of egalitarian modernity, an alternative goal which humanity might set for itself. &quot;last man&quot; appears only in &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, and is presented as a smothering of aspiration antithetical to the spirit of the .

According to Rüdiger Safranski, some commentators associate the with a program of eugenics.

==Re-embodiment of amoral aristocratic values==

For Rüdiger Safranski, the represents a higher biological type reached through artificial selection and at the same time is also an ideal for anyone who is creative and strong enough to master the whole spectrum of human potential, good and &quot;evil&quot;, to become an &quot;artist-tyrant&quot;. In &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;, Nietzsche vehemently denied any idealistic, democratic or humanitarian interpretation of the : &quot;The word [designates] a type of supreme achievement, as opposed to &#x27;modern&#x27; men, &#x27;good&#x27; men, Christians, and other nihilists [...] When I whispered into the ears of some people that they were better off looking for a Cesare Borgia than a Parsifal, they did not believe their ears.&quot; Safranski argues that the combination of ruthless warrior pride and artistic brilliance that defined the Italian Renaissance embodied the sense of the for Nietzsche. According to Safranski, Nietzsche intended the ultra-aristocratic figure of the to serve as a Machiavellian bogeyman of the modern Western middle class and its pseudo-Christian egalitarian value system.

==Relation to the eternal recurrence==
The shares a place of prominence in &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; with another of Nietzsche&#x27;s key concepts: the eternal recurrence of the same.

Laurence Lampert suggests that the eternal recurrence replaces the as the object of serious aspiration.

==Use by the Nazis==
The term was used frequently by Hitler and the Nazi regime to describe their idea of a biologically superior Aryan or Germanic master race; a racial version of Nietzsche&#x27;s became a philosophical foundation for Nazi ideas. The Nazi notion of the master race also spawned the idea of &quot;inferior humans&quot; (&quot;Untermenschen&quot;) who should be dominated and enslaved; this term does not originate with Nietzsche, who was critical of both antisemitism and German nationalism.

In his final years, Nietzsche began to believe that he was in fact Polish, not German, and was quoted as saying, &quot;I am a pure-blooded Polish nobleman, without a single drop of bad blood, certainly not German blood&quot;. In defiance of nationalist doctrines, he claimed that he and Germany were great only because of &quot;Polish blood in their veins&quot;, and that he would &quot;[have] all anti-semites shot.&quot; Nietzsche died long before Hitler&#x27;s reign, and it was partly Nietzsche&#x27;s sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche who manipulated her brother&#x27;s words to accommodate the worldview of herself and her husband, Bernhard Förster, a prominent German nationalist and antisemite. Förster founded the &quot;Deutscher Volksverein&quot; (German People&#x27;s League) in 1881 with Max Liebermann von Sonnenberg.

== Anarchism ==
The thought of Nietzsche had an important influence on anarchist authors. Spencer Sunshine writes:

The influential American anarchist Emma Goldman, in the preface of her famous collection &quot;Anarchism and Other Essays&quot;, defends both Nietzsche and Max Stirner from attacks within anarchism when she says

Sunshine says that the &quot;Spanish anarchists also mixed their class politics with Nietzschean inspiration.&quot; Murray Bookchin, in &quot;The Spanish Anarchists&quot;, describes prominent Catalan CNT member Salvador Seguí as &quot;an admirer of Nietzschean individualism, of the to whom &#x27;all is permitted. Bookchin, in his 1973 introduction to Sam Dolgoff&#x27;s &quot;The Anarchist Collectives&quot;, even describes the reconstruction of society by the workers as a Nietzschean project. Bookchin says that

<text>The Mutopia Project is a volunteer-run effort to create a library of free content sheet music, in a way similar to Project Gutenberg&#x27;s library of public domain books. It started in 2000.

The music is reproduced from old scores that are in the public domain. New scores are digitally typeset with GNU LilyPond and distributed in the following formats:
* PDF format in both letter and A4 paper sizes for printing,
* MIDI for aural reproduction, and 
* LilyPond source code format.

, there are 2124 pieces of music available, over a third of which are for piano.

<text>Alles Door Oefening Den Haag (), commonly known by the abbreviated name ADO Den Haag (), is a Dutch association football club from the city of The Hague. They play in the Eerste Divisie, the second tier of Dutch football, following relegation from the Eredivisie in the 2020–21 season. The club was for a time known as FC Den Haag (), with ADO representing the amateur branch of the club. Despite being from one of the traditional three large Dutch cities, it has not been able to match Ajax, Feyenoord or PSV in terms of success in the Eredivisie or in European competition. There is nonetheless a big rivalry with Ajax and Feyenoord. The Dutch words &quot;Alles Door Oefening&quot; translate into &quot;Everything Through Practice&quot;.

==History==
===1905–1971: ADO===
On 1 February 1905, the club Alles Door Oefening (ADO) was founded in café &#x27;Het Hof van Berlijn&#x27; (now: De Paap) in The Hague. In the first years of its existence, the club endured some difficult times as many members refused to pay their fees. ADO started out in the local Haagsche Voetbal Bond, but promoted to the national Nederlandsche Voetbal Bond in 1912. That year they promoted to the third level (3e klasse NVB) and two years later they even earned the championship on that level.

After moving to the Zuiderpark stadium in 1925, ADO continued to grow to a club of some significance. In 1926, the club earned promotion to the highest national level, the Eerste Klasse. In the following years the red-green-white team struggled not to be relegated at first, but rose to the top of the league at the end of the 1930s. In 1939 the club just missed the class title after losing to DWS in Amsterdam. In 1940, the title seemed very close again, but another second-place finish was the highest achievable position after the club saw many players being drafted in the army with World War II closing in. This time another club from Amsterdam, Blauw-Wit, grabbed the title. In 1941, ADO finally won their class and moved on to the national champion&#x27;s competition, losing that to Heracles.

In the 1941–42 season, all the stars were aligned, and although the war made everyday life harder and harder, the club seemed undefeatable. After winning their league, often by many goals difference, ADO moved on to the national champion&#x27;s competition and fought for the title with Heerenveen, AGOVV, Eindhoven and Blauw-Wit. A 5–2 victory over AGOVV finally brought ADO their first national title. In 1943 ADO won another title, amongst others by beating legend Abe Lenstra&#x27;s Heerenveen 8–2.

The Hague had to wait until the 1960s for more successes from their local club. After Ernst Happel joined ADO as a coach in 1962, the club worked their way to the top of the league again. They finished third in the final ranking in 1965. In 1963, 1964 and 1966, ADO played in the national cup final, the KNVB Cup, but lost. In 1968, they again reached the final, and this time beat Ajax to win it. In the 1970–71 season, ADO started the league with 17 games undefeated and were at the top of the national league, but ended their season as No. 3.

In 1967, ADO played a summer in North America&#x27;s United Soccer Association, under the name San Francisco Golden Gate Gales. The club finished tied for second in the Western Division.

===1971–1996: FC Den Haag===

In 1971 the club merged with city rivals Holland Sport to form &quot;FC Den Haag&quot;.

The club again reached the Dutch Cup final in 1972 (this time losing 3–2 to Ajax) then went on to win the trophy for a second time in 1975, this team defeating Twente 1–0. Their greatest European success was a quarter-final game against West Ham United for the European Cup Winners Cup in 1976. A 4–2 win in The Hague followed by a 3–1 defeat in London meant elimination. In the 1980s, FC Den Haag was often associated with hooliganism and financial backfall. However, they reached their fourth Dutch Cup final in 1987, losing 4–2 (again to Ajax) following two extra-time winners from Marco van Basten.

On 3 April 1982, hooligans of the club burned down part of their own home ground, Zuiderpark Stadion. The fire was set after a 4–0 loss to HFC Haarlem. It damaged the ground&#x27;s oldest stand dating back to 1928 and caused $500,000 in damages. The damaged part was rebuilt and opened in 1986.

After another merger the club was renamed ADO Den Haag in 1996.

===1996–present: ADO Den Haag===
After a long spell in the country&#x27;s second tier of league football, ADO Den Haag played four seasons in the Eredivisie then were relegated again in the 2006–07 season. However, after finishing sixth in the 2007–08 season, they went on to win the play-offs, meaning promotion back to the Eredivisie for 2008–09. The club&#x27;s new home was finished in 2007: the 15,000-capacity Kyocera Stadion, formerly known as the Den Haag Stadion. Their home colors are yellow and green. They began the 2008–09 season with two wins which put them on top of the Eredivisie for the first time in 32 years. In the 2009–10 season, the club&#x27;s average home attendance was 11,745 spectators.

The team enjoyed success in the 2010–11 season. Defeating rivals Ajax twice was one of the highlights of the season. ADO Den Haag finished seventh in the league and won the play-offs (beating Roda JC and Groningen) which offered the last Dutch UEFA Europa League place. They won the first matches against Lithuanian side Tauras (3–2, 2–0) but lost the first away leg for the third qualifying round against Cypriot club Omonia 3–0 in Nicosia.

ADO supporters have strong links with Welsh club Swansea City. Flags of the respective clubs are often flown at the matches of the other club, and both clubs regularly hold pre-season friendly matches. Legia Warsaw (Poland), Club Brugge (Belgium) and Juventus (Italy) also share strong supporter links with ADO Den Haag.

The club was in serious financial trouble in 2008 and in June 2014, its majority shareholder agreed to sell the club to Chinese-based United Vansen International Sports Company, Ltd. for a reported $8.9 million. The current ownership group has &quot;promised to invest millions of euros&quot; into the club. UVS was founded in 2008 and was responsible for organising the Beijing Olympic closing ceremony and football curtain-raisers attracting prominent football clubs such as Juventus, Milan, Internazionale, Napoli, Lazio, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United and Hull City.

The 2019–20 season was declared void, with no promotion/relegation, which meant ADO Den Haag remained in Eredivisie for the 2020–21 season despite their 17th-place finish. In 2021, ADO Den Haag was relegated to the Eerste Divisie. The same year, American investment company Global Football Holdings, owned by David Blitzer, purchased majority shares in the club from United Vansen.

<text>1776 is a musical with music and lyrics by Sherman Edwards and a book by Peter Stone. The show is based on the events leading up to the signing of the Declaration of Independence, telling a story of the efforts of John Adams to persuade his colleagues to vote for American independence and to sign the document. The show premiered on Broadway in 1969 where it received acclaim and won three Tony Awards, including Best Musical. The original production starred William Daniels as Adams, Ken Howard as Thomas Jefferson, and Howard Da Silva as Benjamin Franklin.

In 1972, it was made into a film adaptation. It has received three New York revivals: on Broadway in 1997, an Encores! concert in 2016, and a 2022 Broadway production in which the racially diverse cast was entirely made up of people who identify as female, trans, or non-binary.

== History ==
In 1925, Rodgers and Hart wrote a Broadway musical about the American Revolution called &quot;Dearest Enemy&quot;. In 1950, another musical about the Revolution was presented on Broadway, titled &quot;Arms and the Girl&quot;, with music by Morton Gould, lyrics by Dorothy Fields, and book by Herbert Fields, Dorothy Fields and Rouben Mamoulian, the show&#x27;s director.

Sherman Edwards, a writer of pop songs with several top 10 hits in the late 1950s and early &#x27;60s, spent several years developing lyrics and libretto for a musical based on the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Edwards recounted that &quot;I wanted to show [the founding fathers] at their outermost limits. These men were the cream of their colonies. ... They disagreed and fought with each other. But they understood commitment, and though they fought, they fought affirmatively.&quot; Producer Stuart Ostrow recommended that librettist Peter Stone collaborate with Edwards on the book of the musical. Stone recalled, The minute you heard [&quot;Sit Down, John&quot;], you knew what the whole show was. ... You knew immediately that John Adams and the others were not going to be treated as gods or cardboard characters, chopping down cherry trees and flying kites with strings and keys on them. It had this very affectionate familiarity; it wasn&#x27;t reverential. Adams, the outspoken delegate from Massachusetts, was chosen as the central character, and his quest to persuade all 13 colonies to vote for independence became the central conflict. Stone confined nearly all of the action to Independence Hall and the debate among the delegates, and featuring two female characters, Abigail Adams and Martha Jefferson, in the musical. After tryouts in New Haven, Conn., and Washington, D.C., the show opened on Broadway at the 46th Street Theatre on March 16, 1969. Peter Hunt directed.

== Synopsis ==
&quot;NOTE: The show can be performed in one or two acts.&quot;

=== Act I ===
On May 8, 1776, the Second Continental Congress, convening in Philadelphia at present-day Independence Hall, proceeds with its business. John Adams, the widely disliked delegate from Massachusetts, is frustrated because Congress will not even debate his proposals on independence. The other delegates, preoccupied with the rising heat, implore him to &quot;Sit Down, John.&quot; Adams denounces the do-nothing Congress (&quot;Piddle, Twiddle, and Resolve&quot;), then reads the latest missive to his loving wife Abigail, who speaks to him in his imagination (&quot;Till Then&quot;). Later, Adams meets delegate Benjamin Franklin, who suggests that, because Adams is unpopular, he should let another delegate propose a resolution on independence. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia enters, having been summoned by Franklin; Franklin persuades Lee to ask the Virginia House of Burgesses to authorize a pro-independence resolution (&quot;The Lees of Old Virginia&quot;).

Weeks later, new delegate Dr. Lyman Hall of Georgia arrives and is introduced to many important members of Congress, including Andrew McNair, the custodian; Stephen Hopkins of Rhode Island; Edward Rutledge of South Carolina; and Caesar Rodney of Delaware, among others. As Congress is assembled, John Hancock, the president of Congress, notes that the entire New Jersey delegation has been absent for quite some time. A gloomy dispatch from George Washington, commander of the Continental Army, arrives by courier and is read aloud by Charles Thomson, the Congressional Secretary. Comically, the proceedings are interrupted when a fire wagon passes by. Shortly thereafter, Richard Henry Lee returns, bearing a resolution for independence. Elated, Adams seconds the motion to open debate on the resolution.

John Dickinson of Pennsylvania, a conservative and royal apologist, immediately moves to table the debate. The vote is close, but debate is ultimately approved, prompting Dickinson to denounce the desire for independence as an overreaction to petty squabbles with Great Britain. The debate becomes more heated and personal, sparking a physical fight between Dickinson and Adams and causing Caesar Rodney (who is ailing from cancer) to collapse. Rodney is taken back to Delaware, leaving George Read as their delegation&#x27;s sole vote. Since Read is a conservative, South Carolina&#x27;s Edward Rutledge moves to quickly end the debate and vote on independence, knowing it is likely to fail. At this moment, the new delegation from New Jersey arrives, with leader the Reverend John Witherspoon announcing he has explicit orders to vote &quot;for&quot; independence. Adams, now seeing a path to victory, pushes to proceed with the vote, since ties are broken by Hancock and Adams believes Hancock is a firm believer in independence.

Dickinson suddenly makes another motion: that any vote in favor of independence must be unanimous. The vote, predictably, ends in a tie, but Hancock unexpectedly votes in favor of unanimity, explaining that if the colonies are not unanimous in their opinion, loyalist colonies will be turned against pro-independence colonies, spawning a civil war.

Looking for a way to save the independence movement, Adams moves to postpone the vote to allow for the creation of a formal Declaration of Independence that can be used in the courts of Europe to rally favor and assistance to the cause of American independence (this will also grant Adams time to persuade the anti-independence delegates to his side). Again, the vote ties; this time, Hancock votes with Adams, as many in Congress would like to have a break. Before they adjourn, John Hancock appoints a committee of Adams, Franklin, Roger Sherman of Connecticut, Robert Livingston of New York, and Jefferson (who is on the point of going home to see his wife, whom he has not seen in six months) to draft the declaration. The five argue about who should write the declaration (&quot;But, Mr. Adams&quot;); the choice falls on a reluctant Jefferson, since Adams is &quot;obnoxious and disliked&quot;, Franklin won&#x27;t write politics, Sherman has no writing ability and Livingston is headed home to celebrate the birth of his new son.

A week later, Adams and Franklin visit Jefferson, who has spent the week moping; however, Adams has sent for Jefferson&#x27;s beloved wife Martha on the grounds that &quot;the sooner [Jefferson&#x27;s] problem was solved, the sooner [theirs] would.&quot; She enters, and Adams and Franklin leave the young lovers in peace. Adams, alone, again exchanges letters with his wife Abigail (&quot;Yours, Yours, Yours&quot;). The next morning, Franklin and Adams return and formally introduce themselves to Martha, asking her how the deeply intellectual and usually uncommunicative Jefferson wooed her (&quot;He Plays the Violin&quot;). Jefferson enters and silently reclaims his wife, requesting the other two men (by means of a note) to &quot;kindly go away.&quot;

=== Act II ===
In June, with the Congress in what looks like a state of total lethargy, another gloomy dispatch from General Washington causes Adams to challenge Samuel Chase of Maryland to go with him and Franklin to the Army camp in New Brunswick, New Jersey, to check on conditions there. The other liberals also leave the chamber; with only the conservatives left, John Dickinson leads his congressional allies in a defense of their wealth, status and politics (&quot;Cool, Cool Considerate Men&quot;). They depart, leaving Andrew McNair (the custodian), the courier, and a workman in the chamber. The courier describes how his two closest friends were killed on the same day at Lexington (&quot;Momma Look Sharp&quot;).

Some days later, Jefferson is outside the chamber while Mr. Thomson reads the declaration to the Congress. Adams and Franklin arrive, delighted: an exhibition of shooting by the Continental Army has convinced Chase, and Maryland will vote in favor of independence. They congratulate Jefferson on his work, and Franklin compares the creation of this new country to the hatching of a bird (&quot;The Egg&quot;). They debate which bird would best represent America: Franklin argues for the turkey and Jefferson suggests the dove, but Adams insists on the eagle. The others resign themselves to that choice.

On June 28, Hancock asks if there are any alterations to be offered to the Declaration of Independence. Many delegates voice suggestions. Edward Rutledge of South Carolina objects in particular to a clause condemning the slave trade. He accuses the northern colonies of hypocrisy, as they also prosper from slavery through the Triangle Trade (&quot;Molasses to Rum&quot;). Rutledge leads a walk-out with the delegates from both Carolinas and Georgia. The resolve of the other delegates is broken, and most of them also leave. Adams&#x27; faith in himself is shaken after a quarrel with Franklin, who understands that the slavery clause is &quot;a luxury [they] can&#x27;t afford&quot; and that Adams seems to have forgotten, after being caught up in the slavery debate, that &quot;the issue here is independence!&quot; Adams calls on Abigail in his mind to help him, and she reminds him of his commitment to the cause. Bolstered by her (and the arrival of a delivery of kegs of saltpeter she had previously promised him), Adams recovers his energy and sends Franklin to try and win the support of Pennsylvania&#x27;s James Wilson and Jefferson to talk to Rutledge. Re-reading a dispatch from Washington, Adams, now alone, wonders &quot;Is Anybody There?&quot; He is answered by Dr. Hall, the Georgia delegate, who changes Georgia&#x27;s vote on the tally board from &quot;Nay&quot; to &quot;Yea&quot;.

It is now July 2. Hancock calls for the vote on the Lee Resolution. At this moment, Rodney and Thomas McKean return to Congress to assure that Delaware will vote in favor of independence. Thomson calls on each delegation. Although Pennsylvania passes on their first call, the rest of the New England and Mid-Atlantic colonies vote in favor of independence except for New York, who abstains. When South Carolina is called, Rutledge again insists that the slavery clause be removed in exchange for the southern colonies voting in favor; Franklin argues they must first win independence before there is any hope of abolishing slavery, and Jefferson himself strikes out the passage. North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia all vote &quot;yea&quot;. On Pennsylvania&#x27;s second call, Dickinson is about to announce that his colony votes &quot;nay&quot; when Franklin requests that the delegation be polled. Franklin votes &quot;yea&quot; and Dickinson votes &quot;nay&quot;, leaving the decisive vote in the hands of Wilson. Wilson has previously subordinated himself to Dickinson; now, suddenly fearing that if he sides with Dickinson now he would be forever remembered as the man who prevented American independence, he changes his vote and votes for independence. With twelve colonies voting in favor of independence, none against and one colony abstaining, the resolution is unanimously adopted.

Hancock proposes that no man be allowed to sit in Congress without signing the Declaration. Dickinson announces that he cannot in good conscience sign it, and still hopes for reconciliation with England; however, he resolves to join the army to fight for and defend the new nation. Adams leads the Congress in a salute to Dickinson as he leaves the chamber.

On July 4, McNair rings the Liberty Bell in the background as Thomson calls each delegate to sign the Declaration. The delegates freeze in position as the Liberty Bell rings to a fevered pitch.

== Productions ==
After out-of-town tryouts, the original Broadway production opened on Broadway on March 16, 1969, at the 46th Street Theatre (now the Richard Rodgers Theatre) and closed on February 13, 1972, after 1,217 performances. In its three-year run, it played in three different theatres: the 46th Street, the St. James Theatre (1970) and, finally, the Majestic Theatre (1971). The principal cast included William Daniels, Howard da Silva, Paul Hecht, Clifford David, Ronald Holgate, David Ford, Virginia Vestoff and Ken Howard. Rex Everhart, who was da Silva&#x27;s understudy, replaced him on the original Broadway cast album after da Silva suffered a mild heart attack, which required him to leave the show temporarily. Betty Buckley made her Broadway debut as Martha Jefferson in the original stage production. Clifford David left the production soon after opening. He was replaced as Rutledge by David Cryer who was in turn replaced by John Cullum who became one of the few Broadway replacements in history to recreate a role on film. (Cullum was succeeded in the Broadway production by Paul-David Richards.)
The musical toured for two years in the United States and was given a London production, opening on June 16, 1970, at the New Theatre. The production starred Lewis Fiander as Adams, Vivienne Ross as Abigail Adams, Ronald Radd, Bernard Lloyd, David Kernan as Rutledge, John Quentin as Jefferson and Cheryl Kennedy as Martha Jefferson.

An Australian production, also with Lewis Fiander, opened at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in Melbourne on 26 June 1971 and moved to the Theatre Royal in Sydney on 11 September 1971.

&quot;1776&quot; was revived by the Roundabout Theatre Company, opening on August 4, 1997, in a limited engagement at the Roundabout&#x27;s home theater, the Criterion Center, before transferring to the George Gershwin Theatre on December 3, 1997, for a commercial run. It closed on June 14, 1998, after 333 performances and 34 previews. The production was directed by Scott Ellis with choreography by Kathleen Marshall, and featured Brent Spiner as Adams, Michael Cumpsty as Dickinson, Pat Hingle as Franklin, and Paul Michael Valley as Jefferson. Rex Everhart, who replaced Howard da Silva on the original cast album, was the standby for the role of Franklin.

The musical was produced in an Encores! City Center staged concert from March 30 to April 3, 2016. Directed by Garry Hynes, the cast starred Santino Fontana as John Adams, John Larroquette as Benjamin Franklin, John Behlmann as Thomas Jefferson, Christiane Noll as Abigail Adams, Nikki Renée Daniels as Martha Jefferson, Bryce Pinkham as John Dickinson, Alexander Gemignani as Edward Rutledge, André De Shields as Stephen Hopkins, and Jubilant Sykes as Richard Henry Lee. The cast included MacIntyre Dixon, Ric Stoneback, and Kevin Ligon reprising their roles from the 1997 revival as Andrew McNair, Samuel Chase, and George Read respectively. The production notably sported a racially diverse cast in light of the recent success of another musical about the Founding Fathers, &quot;Hamilton&quot;.

The musical was produced in Chicago, Illinois by Porchlight Music Theatre as part of their &quot;Porchlight Revisits&quot; series in November 2018. Directed by Michael Weber, Music Directed by Jeremy Ramey, with Musical Staging by Michelle Lauto.

A new revival of &quot;1776&quot; was to be staged at the American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.) in mid-2020, under the direction of Diane Paulus (Terrie and Bradley Bloom Artistic Director of A.R.T.), and then in Los Angeles at the Ahmanson Theatre, before arriving at the American Airlines Theatre, co-produced by ART and Roundabout Theatre Company. The team held a two-week workshop on Zoom in April 2020, but the production was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2021, A.R.T. announced that the production, now directed by Jeffrey L. Page and Paulus, would begin performances at A.R.T. in May 2022.

In April 2022 A.R.T. announced the revival cast of performers who identify as female, non-binary, and trans, and that the production would transfer to Roundabout&#x27;s American Airlines Theatre on September 16, 2022 (where after previews it officially opened on October 6, 2022, and ran until January 8, 2023) and begin a 16-city national tour in February 2023. The cast (many of whom were making their Broadway debuts) included Crystal Lucas-Perry (later Kristolyn Lloyd) as Adams, Patrena Murray as Franklin, Elizabeth A. Davis as Jefferson, Allison Kaye Daniel as Abigail/Rev. Witherspoon, Eryn Lecroy as Martha/Dr. Hall, Carolee Carmello as Dickinson and Sara Porkalob as Rutledge.

The show received mixed to negative reviews, with Jesse Green of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticizing its casting, writing that it &quot;intensifies and complicates the argument.&quot; Green also wrote of the overall production that despite &quot;underlining one’s progressiveness a thousand times, as this &quot;1776&quot; does, [it] will not actually convey it better; rather it turns characters into cutouts and distracts from the ideas it means to promote.&quot;

== Dramatic analysis ==
Scene Three of &quot;1776&quot; holds the record for the longest time in a musical without a single note of music played or sung – over thirty minutes pass between &quot;The Lees of Old Virginia&quot; and &quot;But Mr. Adams&quot;, the next song in the show. On the DVD commentary, Peter Stone says that he experimented with adding various songs in this section, but nothing ever worked. During this scene, dubbed &quot;Big Three&quot; by cast members, musicians were allowed to leave the pit, reportedly the first time in Broadway history that they were permitted to do so in the middle of a show. Stone also notes that people often told him that, because of the subject matter and the large amount of dialogue, &quot;1776&quot; should have been a conventional play rather than a musical. Stone believes that the songs create a playful, irreverent tone that helps bring the historical characters to life.

== Historical accuracy ==
According to &quot;The Columbia Companion to American History on Film&quot;, historical &quot;[i]naccuracies pervade &quot;1776&quot;, though few are very troubling.&quot; Because Congress was held in secrecy and there are no contemporary records on the debate over the Declaration of Independence, the authors of the play created the narrative based on later accounts and educated guesses, inventing scenes and dialogue as needed for storytelling purposes. Some of the dialogue was taken from words written, often years or even decades later, by the actual people involved, and rearranged for dramatic effect.

The central departure from history is that the separation from Great Britain was accomplished in two steps: the actual vote for independence came on July 2 with the approval of Lee&#x27;s resolution of independence. The wording of the Declaration of Independence—the statement to the world as to the reasons necessitating the split—was then debated for three days before being approved on July 4. The vote for independence did not hinge on some passages being removed from the Declaration, as implied in the play, since Congress had already voted in favor of independence before debating the Declaration. For the sake of drama, the play&#x27;s authors combined the two events. In addition, some historians believe that the Declaration was not signed on July 4, as shown in &quot;1776&quot;, but was instead signed on August 2, 1776. The authors of &quot;1776&quot; had the delegates sign the Declaration on July 4 for dramatic reasons.

Of the four principal characters, the musical also notably focuses on Jefferson&#x27;s wife, Martha, and Adams&#x27; wife, Abigail, but omits Dickinson&#x27;s wife, Mary Norris, who was actually in Philadelphia at the time, unlike the other wives, and had a different perspective than the other wives. Franklin&#x27;s common-law wife, Deborah Read, was deceased at this point, and his mistresses are not depicted, although he does mention a &quot;Rendez-vous&quot; he has to attend.

Many characters in &quot;1776&quot; differ from their historical counterparts. Central to the drama is the depiction of John Adams as &quot;obnoxious and disliked&quot;. According to biographer David McCullough, however, Adams was one of the most respected members of Congress in 1776. Adams&#x27; often-quoted description of himself in Congress as &quot;obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular&quot; is from a letter written 46 years later, in 1822, after his unpopular presidency had likely colored his view of the past. According to McCullough, no delegate described Adams as obnoxious in 1776. Historian Garry Wills earlier made a similar argument, writing that &quot;historians relay John Adams&#x27;s memories without sufficient skepticism&quot;, and that it was Dickinson, not Adams, who was advocating an unpopular position in 1776.

Dickinson, who refused to sign Adams&#x27; and Jefferson&#x27;s declaration based on &quot;rights of man&quot; and &quot;natural law&quot;, was seeking to avoid reopening issues from the English Civil Wars, including Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Puritan regime, and the Jacobitism cause. In 1689, these issues had been definitively resolved in the Glorious Revolution and the constitutionalization of the English Bill of Rights based in &quot;rights and responsibilities of person&quot;; the word &quot;man&quot; is not used except in the context of treason. The last Jacobite rebellion, seeking to re-establish Catholicism and the religious concept of &quot;natural law&quot;, had only just happened in 1745, however. None of this background of Dickinson&#x27;s position is depicted. (Dickinson would later draft the Articles of Confederation, a codification of the Continental Congress system that governed the United States until the present United States Constitution supplanted it; the Articles draw upon the &quot;rights and responsibilities of person&quot; language.)

For practical and dramatic purposes, the play does not depict all of the more than 50 members of Congress who were present at the time. The John Adams of the play is, in part, a composite character, combining the real Adams with his cousin Samuel Adams, who was in Congress at the time but is not depicted in the play (though he is mentioned). Although the play depicts Caesar Rodney as an elderly man near death from skin cancer (which would eventually kill him), he was just 47 at the time and continued to be very active in the Revolution after signing the Declaration. He was not absent from the voting because of health; however, the play is accurate in having him arrive &quot;in the nick of time&quot;, having ridden 80 miles the night before (an event depicted on Delaware&#x27;s 1999 State Quarter). In the play, Richard Henry Lee announces that he is returning to Virginia to serve as governor. He was never governor; his cousin Henry Lee III (who is anachronistically called &quot;General &#x27;Lighthorse&#x27; Harry Lee&quot;, a rank and nickname earned later) did eventually become governor and would also become the father of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. John Adams was also depicted in the play and the film as disliking Richard Henry Lee. That is not the case as, according to David McCullough, Adams expressed nothing but &quot;respect and admiration for the tall, masterly Virginian.&quot; He did, however, contrary to what was portrayed in the play and the film, dislike Benjamin Franklin. Martha Jefferson never traveled to Philadelphia to be with her husband. In fact, she was extremely ill during the summer of 1776, having just endured a miscarriage. The play&#x27;s authors invented the scene &quot;to show something of the young Jefferson&#x27;s life without destroying the unity of setting.&quot; James Wilson was not the indecisive milquetoast depicted in the play. The real Wilson, who was not yet a judge in 1776, had been cautious about supporting independence at an earlier date, but he supported the resolution of independence when it came up for a vote. Pennsylvania&#x27;s deciding swing vote was actually cast by John Morton, who is not depicted in the musical.

The quote attributed to Edmund Burke by Dr. Lyman Hall in a key scene with John Adams is a paraphrase of a real quote by Burke.

The song &quot;Cool Considerate Men&quot; is anachronistic because the terms &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; in politics were not in use until the French Revolution of 1789. John Dickinson, who is portrayed as an antagonist here, was motivated mainly by his Quaker roots and his respect for the British Constitution, having lived in England for 3 years in the 1750s. He was no wealthier than some members of the pro-Independence faction, and freed his slaves in 1777. Thomas Jefferson wrote that &quot;his name will be consecrated in history as one of the great worthies of the revolution&quot;.

The musical also deviates from history in its portrayal of attitudes about slavery. In &quot;1776&quot;, after a dramatic debate over slavery, the southern delegates walk out in protest of the Declaration&#x27;s reference to the slave trade, and support independence only when that language is removed from the Declaration. The walkout is fictional, and apparently most delegates, northern and southern, supported the deletion of the clause.

The musical claims that Edward Rutledge led the opposition to the supposedly anti-slavery clause in the original draft of the Declaration. This is inaccurate on two counts. First, the musical does not mention the motivation of the clause, namely the fact that, following Lord Dunmore&#x27;s Proclamation, England was granting freedom to runaway slaves who joined its army. Second, Rutledge&#x27;s leadership against the clause is completely fictional. According to Jefferson, the clause was opposed by South Carolina and Georgia, plus unspecified &quot;northern brethren&quot;; that is the &quot;limit&quot; of known information about opposition to the clause.

Thomas Jefferson is depicted as saying that he has resolved to free his slaves, something he did not do, except for a few slaves freed after his death 50 years later. Franklin claims that he is the founder of an abolitionist organization, but the real Franklin did not become an active abolitionist until after the American Revolution, becoming president of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society in 1785.

James Wilson is portrayed as subordinating himself to Dickinson&#x27;s opposition to independence, only changing his vote so that he would not be remembered unfavorably. In fact, Wilson was considered one of the leading thinkers behind the American cause, consistently supporting and arguing for independence, although he would not cast his vote until his district had been caucused.

The phrase &quot;We are about to brave the storm in a skiff made of paper&quot;, placed in the mouth of John Hancock, was actually stated by John Dickinson (&quot;Others strenuously assert...we ought to brave the Storm in a Skiff made of Paper.&quot;) in his arguments against independence.

In both the play and the film, John Adams sarcastically predicts that Benjamin Franklin will receive from posterity too great a share of credit for the Revolution. &quot;Franklin smote the ground and out sprang—George Washington. Fully grown, and on his horse. Franklin then electrified them with his magnificent lightning rod and the three of them—Franklin, Washington, and the horse—conducted the entire Revolution all by themselves.&quot; Adams did make a similar comment about Franklin in April 1790, just after Franklin&#x27;s death, although the mention of the horse was a humorous twist added by the authors of the musical.

The 2022 revival production includes an excerpt of Abigail Adams&#x27; March 1776 letter to John Adams, known for its &quot;remember the ladies&quot; statement for women&#x27;s rights.

== Critical reception ==
In his review of the original 1969 production, Clive Barnes of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, On the face of it, few historical incidents seem more unlikely to spawn a Broadway musical than that solemn moment in the history of mankind, the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Yet &quot;1776&quot;... most handsomely demonstrated that people who merely go &#x27;on the face of it&#x27; are occasionally outrageously wrong... &quot;[1776]&quot; is a most striking, most gripping musical. I recommend it without reservation. It makes even an Englishman&#x27;s heart beat faster... the characters are most unusually full... for Mr. Stone&#x27;s book is literate, urbane and, on occasion, very amusing... William Daniels has given many persuasive performances in the past, but nothing, I think, can have been so effective as his John Adams here. This is a beautiful mixture of pride, ambition, an almost priggish sense of justice and yet – the saving grace of the character – an ironic self-awareness.

John Chapman of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; wrote, This is by no means a historical tract or a sermon on the birth of this nation. It is warm with a life of its own; it is funny, it is moving... Often, as I sat enchanted in my seat, it reminded me of Gilbert and Sullivan in its amused regard of human frailties... The songs and lyrics are, as I have indicated, remarkably original.

The &quot;New York Post&quot; noted, In this cynical age, it requires courage as well as enterprise to do a musical play that simply deals with the events leading up to the signing of the Declaration of Independence. And &quot;1776&quot;... makes no attempt to be satirical or wander off into modern bypaths. But the rewards of this confidence reposed in the bold conception were abundant. The result is a brilliant and remarkably moving work of theatrical art... it is Mr. Daniels&#x27; John Adams who dominates the evening, as he did the Congress. Peter Hunt&#x27;s direction, the choreography of Onna White, and the setting by Jo Mielziner are just right.

== Awards and nominations ==

=== Original Broadway production ===

&quot;*Note: William Daniels, who starred as John Adams, was ruled ineligible for the Best Actor nomination because his name was not billed above the title of the show. He was nominated for Best Featured Actor, but refused the nomination.&quot;

== Film adaptation ==

The 1972 film version of &quot;1776&quot; was produced by Jack L. Warner with Hunt again directing and Stone writing the screenplay. The film featured William Daniels as Adams, Ken Howard as Jefferson, Howard da Silva as Franklin, John Cullum as Edward Rutledge, Ron Holgate as Richard Henry Lee, and Virginia Vestoff as Abigail Adams, all of whom had performed their roles on Broadway. The supporting cast was also mostly recruited from the Broadway production. The principal exceptions were Donald Madden and Blythe Danner, who took over the roles of John Dickinson and Martha Jefferson.

A Director&#x27;s Cut of the original film has been released on DVD and Blu-ray. Both the look and sound of the original film have been improved through modern technology. Many cuts to the original film by the producer Jack Warner have been restored, including verses from the songs &quot;Piddle Twiddle and Resolve&quot; and &quot;He Plays the Violin&quot; and the entire &quot;Cool, Cool, Considerate Men&quot;. Musical underscoring has been removed from several scenes without songs in order to strengthen the focus on dialogue. Bonus material includes commentary by Director Peter Hunt and by Peter Stone, the book/screenwriter. Among other topics, they discuss artistic liberties and anachronisms used to dramatize the events.

== In popular culture ==
Throughout the course of the third season of the Netflix original series &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot;, Robert, played by Martin Sheen, and his husband Sol, played by Sam Waterston, are persuaded to audition for a local production of &quot;1776&quot; by the local gay men&#x27;s theater group, resulting in Robert landing the lead role of John Adams, much to the disappointment of Sol who was not cast.

The musical &quot;Hamilton&quot; references the song &quot;Sit Down, John!&quot; in a lyric from the song, &quot;The Adams Administration&quot;, in the lyric: &quot;Adams fires Hamilton/Privately calls him &quot;creole bastard&quot; in his taunts/Say what?/Hamilton publishes his response/Sit down, John, you fat mother.&quot; Lin-Manuel Miranda discovered the &quot;1776&quot; film in college and cites it as having paved the way for &quot;Hamilton&quot;.
