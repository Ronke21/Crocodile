<text>The Lockheed Vega is an American five- to seven-seat high-wing monoplane airliner built by the Lockheed Corporation starting in 1927. It became famous for its use by a number of record-breaking pilots who were attracted to its high speed and long range. Amelia Earhart became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean in one, and Wiley Post used his to prove the existence of the jet stream after flying around the world twice.

==Design and development==

Designed by John Knudsen Northrop and Gerald Vultee, both of whom would later form their own companies, the aircraft was originally intended to serve with Lockheed&#x27;s own airline routes. They set out to build a four-passenger (plus pilot) aircraft that was not only rugged, but also one of the fastest aircraft of its era. Using a wooden monocoque fuselage, plywood-covered cantilever wings and the best engine available, the Vega delivered on the promise of speed.

The fuselage was built from sheets of plywood, skinned over wooden ribs. Using a large concrete mold, a single half of the fuselage shell was laminated in sections with glue between each layer and then a rubber bladder was lowered into the mold and inflated with air to compress the lamination into shape against the inside of the mold. The two fuselage halves were then nailed and glued over a separately constructed rib framework. With the fuselage constructed in this fashion, the wing spar couldn&#x27;t cut through the fuselage, so the single spar cantilever wing was mounted atop the aircraft. Only the engine and landing gear remained essentially unstreamlined, and on the production versions the undercarriage had teardrop shaped fairings covering the wheels, while only the earliest versions lacked NACA cowlings and had the engine cylinders exposed to the airstream. It was powered by the Wright Whirlwind air-cooled radial engine, which delivered .

==Operational history==
The first Vega 1, named the &quot;Golden Eagle&quot;, flew from Lockheed&#x27;s Los Angeles plant on July 4, 1927. It could cruise at a then-fast , and had a top speed of . A number of private owners placed orders for the design, and by the end of 1928, 68 had been produced. In the 1929 National Air Races in Cleveland, Ohio, Vegas won every speed award.

In 1928, Vega &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; (NX4769) was used to break transcontinental speed records. On August 19–20, Hollywood stunt flier Arthur C. Goebel broke the coast-to-coast record of Russell Maughan by flying from Los Angeles, California, to Garden City, New York, in 18 hours and 58 minutes, in what was also the first nonstop flight from west to east. On October 25, barnstormer and former mail pilot Charles B.D. Collyer broke the nonstop east to west record set in 1923 by the U.S. Army Air Service in 24 hours and 51 minutes. Trying to break the new West-to-East record on November 3, Collyer crashed near Prescott, Arizona, killing him and the aircraft owner, Harry J. Tucker.

Looking to improve the design, Lockheed delivered the Vega 5 in 1929. Adding the Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1340 Wasp engine of and a new NACA cowling improved performance enough to allow the addition of two more seats, and increased cruising speed to and top speed to . A variant of the Vega 5 was built specifically for private aviation and executive transport as the L.5A &quot;Executive&quot; although the 5 was also used by a many airlines, including Pan American Airlines, Pacific Alaska Airways and Transcontinental and Western Air. A total of 64 Vega 5s were built.

In 1931, the United States Army Air Corps bought two DL-1 Vegas, with the first designated as Y1C-12 and the second, a DL-1B designated as Y1C-17. These both had a formed metal fuselage, while the Y1C-17 had additional fuel tanks in the wings.

The Vega could be difficult to land. In her memoir, Elinor Smith wrote that it had &quot;all the glide potential of a boulder falling off a mountain.&quot; In addition, forward and side visibility from the cockpit was extremely limited; Lane Wallace, a columnist for &quot;Flying&quot; magazine, wrote that &quot;Even [in level flight], the windscreen would offer a better view of the sky than anything else, which would make it more of a challenge to detect changes in attitude or bank angle. On takeoff or landing, there&#x27;d be almost no forward visibility whatsoever.&quot;

===Vega DL-1A special===
A one-off special based on the metal-fuselaged DL-1 was built by the Detroit Aircraft Corporation, and exported to the United Kingdom for Lt. Cmdr. Glen Kidston who named it &quot;Puch&quot;. It was initially registered in the UK as &quot;G-ABFE&quot;, then was re-registered as &quot;G-ABGK&quot; to incorporate Kidston&#x27;s initials. He used this Vega for a record-breaking flight from the UK to South Africa in April 1931. Following Kidston&#x27;s death the following month, the aircraft was eventually sold to Australian airline owner Horrie Miller, who entered it in the MacRobertson Air Race. Flown in the race by Miller&#x27;s Chief Pilot, Capt. Jimmy Woods, it overturned on landing at Aleppo &quot;en route&quot;, whereupon Woods withdrew from the race and the DL-1A was eventually shipped to Australia. Following repairs and re-registration as &quot;VH-UVK&quot;, Miller used the aircraft for charter and leisure flying, after which it was impressed by the Royal Australian Air Force in 1941. In 1944 the aircraft was transferred to the Australian Department of Civil Aviation (DCA). Via information from RAAF pilots, DCA declared the Vega to have serious pitch control problems and it would be scrapped. Attempts by James Woods to reclaim the aircraft were ignored, and it was destroyed in October 1945. It was the only Vega to operate in Australia.

<text>Hans von Bartels (25 December 1856 – 5 October 1913) was a German painter.

==Life==
He was born in Hamburg, the son of Dr N. F. F. von Bartels, a Russian government official. He studied first under the marine painter R. Hardorff in Hamburg, then under C. Schweitzer in Düsseldorf and Carl Oesterley in Hamburg, and finally at the Berlin School of Art. After travelling extensively, especially in Italy, he settled in Munich in 1885 and was appointed professor of painting in 1891. He died in Munich.

Bartels is associated with the Düsseldorf school of painting. Although an oil painter of great power, he is also one of the leading German water-colour painters, mainly of marines and scenes of fishing life, painted with rude vigour and a great display of technical skill. Bartels made a great contribution to the development of the watercolour. He was the first to use watercolour paint of large formats without the earlier conventions. From 1887 Von Bartels came every summer to the Dutch coast, especially to Katwijk aan Zee, to paint the fisherfolk and their labour. He excels in storm scenes and in depicting the strong, healthy fishing-folk of the northern coasts. He became an honorary member of leading English, German, Dutch, Belgian and Austrian art societies.

==Legacy==
Among his principal works are:

*&quot;&quot;Lonely Beach&quot;
*&quot;Potato Harvest—Rügen&quot;
*&quot;Storm—Bornholm&quot;
*&quot;Moonlight on the Zuyder Zee&quot;&quot;
He has paintings in public collections in London and Paisley.

<doc id="162049" wikidata="Q4650692" url="?curid=162049" title="ACL2">
<text>ACL2 (A Computational Logic for Applicative Common Lisp) is a software system consisting of a programming language, an extensible theory in a first-order logic, and an automated theorem prover. ACL2 is designed to support automated reasoning in inductive logical theories, mostly for software and hardware verification. The input language and implementation of ACL2 are written in Common Lisp. ACL2 is free and open-source software.

==Overview==
The ACL2 programming language is an applicative (side-effect free) variant of Common Lisp. ACL2 is untyped. All ACL2 functions are total — that is, every function maps each object in the ACL2 universe to another object in its universe.

ACL2&#x27;s base theory axiomatizes the semantics of its programming language and its built-in functions. User definitions in the programming language that satisfy a &quot;definitional principle&quot; extend the theory in a way that maintains the theory&#x27;s logical consistency.

The core of ACL2&#x27;s theorem prover is based on term rewriting, and this core is extensible in that user-discovered theorems can be used as ad hoc proof techniques for subsequent conjectures.

ACL2 is intended to be an &quot;industrial strength&quot; version of the Boyer–Moore theorem prover, NQTHM. Toward this goal, ACL2 has many features to support clean engineering of interesting mathematical and computational theories. ACL2 also derives efficiency from being built on Common Lisp; for example, the same specification that is the basis for inductive verification can be compiled and run natively.

In 2005, the authors of the Boyer-Moore family of provers, which includes ACL2, received the ACM Software System Award &quot;for pioneering and engineering a most effective theorem prover (...) as a formal methods tool for verifying safety-critical hardware and software.&quot;

==Proofs==

ACL2 has had numerous industrial applications. In 1995, J Strother Moore, Matt Kaufmann and Tom Lynch used ACL2 to prove the correctness of the floating point division operation of the AMD K5 microprocessor in the wake of the Pentium FDIV bug.

Industrial users of ACL2 include AMD, Arm, Centaur Technology, IBM, Intel, Oracle, and Collins Aerospace.

<text>Thomas Augustine Arne (; 12 March 17105 March 1778) was an English composer. He is best known for his patriotic song &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; and the song &quot;A-Hunting We Will Go&quot;, the latter composed for a 1777 production of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, which has since become popular as a folk song and a nursery rhyme. Arne was a leading British theatre composer of the 18th century, working at the West End&#x27;s Drury Lane and Covent Garden. He wrote many operatic entertainments for the London theatres and pleasure gardens, as well as concertos, sinfonias, and sonatas.

==Early life==
Arne was born on 12 March 1710 in Covent Garden and baptised as a Roman Catholic. He came from a long line of Catholic recusants. 

Arne&#x27;s father and grandfather were both upholsterers and both held office in the Worshipful Company of Upholders of the City of London. His grandfather fell on hard times and died in the debtors&#x27; prison of Marshalsea. His father earned enough money to rent 31 King Street, a large house in Covent Garden, but also to have Arne educated at Eton College but in later life, he too lost most of his money and had to supplement his income by acting as a numberer of the boxes (ticket counter) at the Drury Lane Theatre.

Arne was so keen on music that he smuggled a spinet into his room and, damping the sounds with his handkerchief, would secretly practise during the night while the rest of the family slept. He also dressed up as a liveryman to gain access to the gallery of the Italian Opera. It was at the opera that Arne first met the musician and composer Michael Festing, who was a major influence on him. Festing not only taught him to play the violin, but also took him to various musical events, including going to compete against Thomas Roseingrave for the post of organist at Hanover Square, and a visit to Oxford in 1733 to hear George Frideric Handel&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Athalia&quot;.

Upon leaving school, Arne was articled to a solicitor for three years. However, Arne&#x27;s father discovered his son leading a group of musicians at what was probably one of Festing&#x27;s musical gatherings. Following this disclosure of his son&#x27;s real interest and talent, he was persuaded (again probably by Festing) to allow the young Arne to give up his legal career and to pursue music as a living.

==Musical career==

Between 1733 and 1776, Arne wrote music for about 90 stage works, including plays, masques, pantomimes, and operas. Many of his dramatic scores are now lost, probably in the disastrous fire at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in 1808. Arne&#x27;s sister, Susannah Maria Arne, was a famous contralto, who performed in some of his works, including his first opera, &quot;Rosamund&quot;. With her marriage to the Drury Lane actor Theophilus Cibber Susannah became known professionally as &quot;Mrs Cibber&quot;. She and their brother Richard would often perform Arne&#x27;s works together.
Arne was a Freemason and active in the organization, which has long been centred in the Covent Garden area of London, where Arne lived for many years. Like Mozart, who also lived in the 1700s, Arne lived before the Catholic hierarchy had banned membership in the Lodges in all countries.

On 15 March 1737, Arne married singer Cecilia Young, whose sister, Isabella, was the wife of John Frederick Lampe. During this period Arne&#x27;s operas and masques became increasingly popular, and he received the patronage of Frederick, Prince of Wales, at whose country home, Cliveden, the &quot;Masque of Alfred&quot;, featuring &quot;Rule Britannia&quot;, was debuted in 1740.

In 1741, Arne filed a complaint in Chancery pertaining to a breach of musical copyright and claimed that some of his theatrical songs had been printed and sold by Henry Roberts and John Johnson, the London booksellers and music distributors. The matter was settled out of court. Arne was one of the first composers to have appealed to the law over copyright issues.

In 1742 Arne went with his wife to Dublin, where he remained two years and produced his oratorio &quot;The Death of Abel&quot;, of which only the melody known as the &quot;Hymn of Eve&quot; survives, and some stage works; he also gave a number of successful concerts. Audiences of the day were exacting, and composers had to try to maintain their attention with ever more inventive means. An advertisement in a Dublin newspaper for one of Arne&#x27;s performances read that he &quot;...intend(ed) between the Acts of his Serenatas, Operas, and other Musical Performances, to intermix Comic Interludes... intended to give Relief to that grave Attention, necessary to be kept up in Serious Performances&quot;. On his return to London in 1744 he was engaged as leader of the band at Drury Lane theatre, and the following year as composer at Vauxhall Gardens.

In 1750, after an argument with David Garrick, Susannah left Drury Lane for Covent Garden Theatre, and Arne followed. In 1755 during another period spent in Dublin, he separated from Cecilia, who, he alleged, was mentally ill. He began a relationship with one of his pupils, Charlotte Brent, a soprano and former child prodigy. Brent performed in several of Arne&#x27;s works, including the role of Sally in his 1760 opera &quot;Thomas and Sally&quot; and Mandane in his 1762 opera &quot;Artaxerxes&quot;. Eventually Brent and Arne went their separate ways and she married a violinist named Thomas Pinto in 1766.

==Later life==

During the 1760s Arne transferred his services to Covent Garden Theatre, and frequently collaborated with the Irish writer Isaac Bickerstaffe. &quot;Thomas and Sally&quot; was the first English comic opera to be sung throughout (it contained no spoken dialogue). &quot;Artaxerxes&quot; was one of the most successful and influential English operas of the 18th century and is the only known attempt to write an Italianate, Metastasian &quot;opera seria&quot;, in the English language, using recitative instead of spoken dialogue. Mozart almost certainly saw it in 1764 when he visited London and said that it influenced his operas. It was frequently performed in London into the 1830s and, other than Michael William Balfe&#x27;s &quot;The Bohemian Girl&quot;, it was the most popular full-length English opera before the 20th century. In a 1791 visit to London, Joseph Haydn was impressed by a performance of ″Artaxerxes″ he attended and admitted that he had no idea such an opera existed in the English language.

In 1769 Arne composed the song &quot;Soft Flowing Avon&quot;, with lyrics by Garrick, for the Shakespeare Jubilee held by Garrick in Stratford-upon-Avon to commemorate the life of William Shakespeare. In 1773, in a performance of Judith Arne introduced women&#x27;s voices into the choruses for the first time.
In 1777, shortly before his death, Arne and his wife were reconciled. They had one son, Michael Arne, who was also a composer. Arne is buried at St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden, London. A blue plaque, unveiled in 1988, commemorates Arne at 31 King Street in Covent Garden.

Arne is considered one of 18th-century Britain&#x27;s greatest theatrical composers.

<text>Tyrtaeus (; &quot;Tyrtaios&quot;; fl. mid-7th century BC) was a Greek elegiac poet from Sparta whose works were speculated to fill five books. His works survive from quotations and papyri, and include 250 lines or parts of lines. He wrote at a time of two crises affecting the city: a civic unrest threatening the authority of kings and elders, later recalled in a poem named &quot;Eunomia&quot; (&quot;Law and Order&quot;), where he reminded citizens to respect the divine and constitutional roles of kings, council, and &quot;demos&quot;; and the Second Messenian War, during which he served as a sort of &quot;state poet&quot;, exhorting Spartans to fight to the death for their city. In the 4th century BC, when Tyrtaeus was an established classic, Spartan armies on campaign were made to listen to his poetry. The &quot;Suda&quot; states that he wrote martial songs; these were important in Spartan festivals and were done through anapaestic and iambic chants that accompanied armed dances and processions.

==Life ==

=== Birth and place of origin ===
The floruit given in the first entry of &quot;Suda&quot; is perhaps too early since Jerome offers a date of 633–632 BC. Modern scholars are less specific and provide instead date ranges for the Second Messenian War (and thus for Tyrtaeus&#x27; life) such as &quot;the latter part of the 7th century&quot;, or &quot;any time between the sixties and the thirties&quot; of the 7th century.

The confusion about his place of origin, which emerged by the 5th century BC, may have had several causes. It has been suggested that the depictions of Tyrtaeus as a lame schoolmaster from Athens were invented to denigrate Sparta, which in the views of Athenians could not have had a talented poet of its own. According to Pausanias, the Athenians sent the lame, mentally defective teacher-poet to Sparta as a compromise, wishing to obey the oracle which had demanded an Athenian, but unwilling to help the Spartans in their war with a more capable individual. Yet, Tyrtaeus was not listed by Herodotus among the two foreigners ever to have been awarded Spartan citizenship. One ancient source even listed Aphidnae as his supposed Athenian deme, but there was also a place of that name in Laconia.

Ancient Athenian propaganda might indeed have played a role, although even Plato, who could hardly have intended any denigration as an admirer of Sparta, gave credence to the poet&#x27;s Athenian origin. According to scholar N. R. E. Fisher, &quot;[t]he story was surely an invention by Athenians, designed in the first instance for a predominantly Athenian market. It must have been aimed at making co-operation between Sparta and Athens more acceptable&quot;. It has also been noted that Tyrtaeus did not compose in the vernacular Laconian Doric dialect of Sparta, as could be expected of a native Spartan like his near contemporary Alcman. However, Greek elegists used the Ionic dialect of Homer regardless of their city of origin or their audience.

Scholars generally agree that Tyrtaeus was a native of Laconia for several reasons: the use of the first personal plural to include himself among the Heraclidae whom Zeus had given to Sparta in fragment 2; the presence of occasional Doric words in his vocabulary; and his tone of authority when addressing Spartan warriors, which would have been tolerated only if delivered by a Spartan-born poet.

=== Sources ===
Virtually all that is known about the life of Tyrtaeus is found in two entries of the &quot;Suda&quot;, a Byzantine encyclopedia redacted in the 10th century AD. The first of the entry of the &quot;Suda&quot; runs as follows:
The second entry states that the Spartans took him as their general from among the Athenians in response to an oracle.

Traditional accounts of his life were almost entirely deduced from his poetry or were simply fiction, such as the account by Pausanias (2nd century AD) of his supposed transformation from a lame and stupid school teacher in Athens to the mastermind of Spartan victories against the Messenians. Variations on his Athenian origin and deformity are found in numerous ancient sources. This includes philosopher Diogenes Laërtius (3rd century AD), who said that the Athenians regarded him as deranged, and Porphyry (3rd century AD), who labelled him &quot;one-eyed.&quot; Finally, historian Justin (2nd century AD) believed that he was sent to the Spartans by the Athenians as a deliberate insult.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the picture of Tyrtaeus&#x27; life has been complicated by doubts about the authenticity of many of his verses, which were dated by various scholars to the 5th or 4th century BC. The theory that Tyrtaeus was in fact a 5th-century Athenian poet was even posited by Eduard Schwartz in 1899. According to Douglas E. Gerber (1997), however, &quot;that skepticism has now largely disappeared&quot;. Disagreements among scholars now essentially revolve around the version of fragment 4 that should be accepted as genuine (Plutarch&#x27;s or Diodorus&#x27; version, or a combination of the two), and some doubts remain about the dating of fragment 12, which some critics have assigned to the time of Xenophanes (c. 570 – c. 475 BC) or shortly before 498 BC.

===Sparta at the time of Tyrtaeus===
The conquest of Messenia in the 8th century BC, by the grandfathers of Tyrtaeus&#x27;s generation, provided the foundation for a sophisticated and cultivated lifestyle. Foreign poets like the Lesbian Terpander and Cretan Thaletas were welcome guests. Ivory and gold ornaments, bronze vessels of ornate workmanship, fine pottery and the odes of Alcman all testify to refined tastes, continuing even into the sixth century. The continuance of those luxuries was &quot;dearly purchased&quot; in blood and toil by Tyrtaeus&#x27;s generation when the Messenians revolted, and the ensuing war and civil strife inspired his entire poetic work. The crisis was mentioned by Aristotle for its instructive power:
His verses seem to mark a critical point in Spartan history, when Spartans began to turn from their flourishing arts and crafts and from the lighter verses of poets like Alcman (roughly his contemporary), to embrace a regime of military austerity: &quot;life in Sparta became spartan&quot;. Some modern scholars believe that Tyrtaeus helped to precipitate and formulate this transition, but others see no real evidence for this.

Tyrtaeus in his poetry urged the Spartans to remain loyal to the state and he reminded them of a constitution based on divine providence, requiring co-operation of kings, elders and the people. He sought to inspire them in battle by celebrating the example of their grandfathers&#x27; generation, when Messenia was first captured, in the rule of King Theopompus, and he gave practical advice on weapons, armour and tactics (see for example the verses below). Some modern scholars however think his advice shows more familiarity with the schoolroom than with the battlefield, appearing to feature obsolete armour and tactics typical of Homeric rather than hoplite warfare. Others have argued that the Spartans at that time were still developing hoplite tactics, or that they were adapting hoplite tactics to encounter Messenian guerillas.

Tyrtaeus&#x27;s poetry is almost always interpreted teleologically, for signs of its subsequent impact on Spartan society. The similarities in meter and phrasing between Homeric epic and early elegy have encouraged this tendency, sometimes leading to dramatic conclusions about Tyrtaeus&#x27;s significance. He has been called, for example, &quot;the first poet of the Greek city state&quot; and, in a similar vein, &quot;he has recast the Homeric ideal of the single champion&#x27;s &quot;arete&quot; (excellence) into the &quot;arete&quot; of the patriot&quot;. For some scholars, this is to credit Tyrtaeus with too much: his use of &quot;arete&quot; was not an advance on Homer&#x27;s use of it but can still be interpreted as signifying &quot;virtue&quot; in the archaic sense of an &quot;individual&#x27;s power to achieve something&quot; rather than as an anticipation of the classical sense of &quot;moral excellence&quot;, familiar to Plato and others.

Athenaeus, Strabo and the second entry of the &quot;Suda&quot; claim that Tyrtaeus was a Spartan general. Some modern scholars, such as F. Rossi (1967–68), maintain that Tyrtaeus held a high military position, but Gerber (1997) contends that this is a speculative surmise: &quot;[i]t may have been assumed that only a military commander could give military admonitions and instructions, but it is an unnecessary assumption.&quot;

==Works==
The &quot;Constitution&quot; () mentioned by the Suda is generally treated as an alternative title for the &quot;Eunomia&quot; () mentioned by Aristotle and Strabo. Surviving only in a few fragments, it seems to have emphasized the role of divine providence in the development of the state and of its government. Eventually the Spartans emerged from the Second Messenian War with their constitution intact, either because victory made change unnecessary or because &quot;religious propaganda&quot; of the kind promoted by Tyrtaeus stemmed the pressure for change.

According to the &quot;Suda&quot;, both his &quot;Constitution&quot; and his &quot;Precepts&quot; () were composed in elegiac couplets. Pausanias also mentions &quot;Anapests&quot;, a few lines of which are quoted by Dio Chrysostom and attributed to Tyrtaeus by a scholiast. They are generally seen by scholars as belonging to the so-called &quot;War Songs&quot; () mentioned by the &quot;Suda&quot;. Presumably written in the Laconian dialect, nothing else of it has survived.

According to Philodemus, who presented it as a little-known fact, Tyrtaeus was honoured above others because of his music, not just his verses. Pollux stated that Tyrtaeus introduced Spartans to three choruses based on age (boys, young and old men), and some modern scholars in fact contend that he composed his elegies in units of five couplets each, alternating between exhortation and reflection, in a kind of responsion similar to Greek choral poetry. Ancient commentators included Tyrtaeus with Archilochus and Callinus as the possible inventor of the elegy.

==Poetry==

Tyrtaeus was predominantly an elegiac poet. Elegy may be described as &quot;a variation upon the heroic hexameter, in the direction of lyric poetry&quot;. Heroic hexameters were used by Homer, whose phrases and Ionian vocabulary became the mainstay of Tyrtaeus&#x27;s verse, even though that was composed for Doric-speaking Spartan audiences—&quot;...a measure of the extent to which the Ionian epics had by now created among the Greeks a cultural unity which transcended dialect and ethnic rivalry&quot;. The use of Ionian vocabulary is all the more remarkable in that Tyrtaeus gave voice to a national, military ethic peculiar to Sparta, and his verses were possibly sung at banquets on campaign and even on the march. However, the only verse surviving from the marching songs () is in anapests, it includes Dorisms and its authenticity is doubtful.

The elegies, being sung at military banquets, belong to a tradition of sympotic poetry while also being representative of the genre of martial exhortation. The adoption of language and thematic concerns from Homeric epic is characteristic of this genre. For instance, the words of Tyrtaeus 10.1–2 (&quot;For it is a fine thing for a man having fallen nobly amid the fore-fighters to die, fighting on behalf of the fatherland&quot;) undoubtedly echo Hector&#x27;s speech in 15.494–7 of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad.&quot;: (&quot;And whoever hit by a missile or struck by a sword find his death and fated end, let him die. It is not unseemly for one to die protecting the land of his fathers&quot;). It is possible that Tyrtaeus intentionally alludes to Homer in instances such as these for political reasons: given the fact that his poetry, like that of other archaic authors, was most likely performed in the context of aristocratic symposia, his references to epic heroism served to praise the elite status of his aristocratic audience.

===Poetic style===
The three longest fragments of surviving verse (fr. 10–12) are complete or virtually complete poems describing the ideal warrior and the disgrace or glory that attends his personal choices. Their poetic quality is uneven, they include some arresting imagery and there are some clumsy transitions, repetitions and padding. The following lines belong to one of these (fr. 11, lines 27–34, here referred to as lines 1–8) and they give a compelling picture of battle between hoplite forces.
The noble sentiment of line 1 seems to be original yet the vocabulary is entirely Homeric and, though lines 5–7 are adapted from Homer&#x27;s Iliad (13.130–33), there is an important difference: Homer describes the advance of one side in close formation, whereas Tyrtaeus describes two sides meeting in the hoplite style of fighting. The description of the battle is rejected however by some scholars as anachronistic: for example, missiles were not characteristic of hoplite warfare. The passage demonstrates one of the more common devices employed by Tyrtaeus—the use of parallel phrases for amplification, sometimes degenerating into tedious repetition. Here it is used to communicate a sense of the crowded battlefield.

=== Military ideology ===

There are many instances in Tyrtaeus&#x27; poetry that show the influences he had towards Spartan society. One such theme involves military Ideology and how it helped shape in Sparta.

First, Tyrtaeus&#x27; poems exemplifies an ancient Greek thought and Homeric concept called Arete. This concept involves the idea of what it means to be excellent. Tyrtaeus is able to show in his work this ideal in both the singular and in the group environment of Sparta. In poem 9, he shows that in order to achieve true and the best &quot;arete&quot;, it involves being in a cohesive group that exemplifies this concept together.  The reasoning for writing around the concept of &quot;arete&quot; is through the Spartan ideology of what makes the Spartan warrior the most courageous and patriotic fighter. One can speculate that his poems help push this ideology along by constantly promoting how a Spartan becomes their most powerful self. Although he writes around this concept, he never accepts this as his way of thinking he is instilling. Instead, he writes specifically about a &quot;fierce fighting spirit.&quot;

Another subject within military ideology that is clearly shown in Tyrtaeus, 9 is the idea of solidarity amongst a group. In order to perform one&#x27;s singular &quot;arete&quot; in a Phalanx, one must remain in the forefront with those he is fighting with. This requires a Spartan man to have the duty to be one with his group.

Finally, Tyrtaeus makes a style choice to not include names of anyone in his poems. This further drives in the idea that a warrior must be selfless in their contributions to the welfare of the state. This can further show that Tyrtaeus&#x27; use of military ideology in his poems influenced Spartan warriors to live a certain way for their state including being courageous and knowing they will be honored in death or in victory over battle.

<doc id="162058" wikidata="Q381874" url="?curid=162058" title="Gaius Musonius Rufus">
<text>Gaius Musonius Rufus (; ) was a Roman Stoic philosopher of the 1st century AD. He taught philosophy in Rome during the reign of Nero and so was sent into exile in 65 AD, returning to Rome only under Galba. He was allowed to stay in Rome when Vespasian banished all other philosophers from the city in 71 AD although he was eventually banished anyway, returning only after Vespasian&#x27;s death. A collection of extracts from his lectures still survives. He is also remembered for being the teacher of Epictetus and Dio Chrysostom.

==Life==
The son of a Roman eques of the name of Capito, Musonius Rufus was born in Volsinii, Etruria about 20–30 AD. By the time of Nero, he was already famous in Rome, where he taught Stoic philosophy. He was associated with the Stoic Opposition against the perceived tyranny of Nero. He followed Rubellius Plautus into exile when Plautus was banished by Nero (60 AD). He returned to Rome after Plautus&#x27; death (62 AD), but as a consequence of his practising and teaching Stoicism, he became an object of suspicion and dislike at Nero&#x27;s court, and was accordingly banished to the island of Gyaros (65 AD) on a trumped-up charge of participation in the Pisonian conspiracy. While Gyaros was &quot;harsh and devoid of human culture&quot;, Musonius was able to survive and form a small community of philosophers. He specifically refers to his time in exile in his ninth discourse, pointing out its advantages for a practitioner of Stoicism.

He returned under Galba (68 AD). When Marcus Antonius Primus, the general of Vespasian, was marching upon Rome (69 AD), he joined the ambassadors that were sent by Vitellius to the victorious general, and going among the soldiers of the latter, preached about the blessings of peace and the dangers of war, but was soon made to stop. When the party of Vitellius gained the upper hand, Musonius was able to accuse, and obtain the conviction of, Publius Egnatius Celer, the Stoic philosopher who had condemned Barea Soranus. It was perhaps about this time that Musonius taught Epictetus, his most famous student. So highly was Musonius esteemed in Rome that Vespasian allowed him to remain in Rome when the other philosophers were banished from the city (71 AD), but eventually he was exiled anyway (perhaps around 75 AD), only returning after Vespasian&#x27;s death (79 AD). As to his death, we know only that he was dead by 101 AD, when Pliny speaks of his son-in-law Artemidorus.

==Writings==

It is unknown whether Musonius wrote anything for publication. His philosophical opinions were collected by two of his students. One collection of &quot;Discourses&quot;, by a certain Lucius, form the basis of the 21 lengthy extracts preserved by Stobaeus. A second collection was compiled by one Pollio; it has been lost, but some fragments survive in quotations by later writers.

The titles of the 21 discourses (Cora Lutz edition) are as follows:
# That There is No Need of Giving Many Proofs for One Problem
# That Man is Born with an Inclination Toward Virtue
# That Women Too Should Study Philosophy
# Should Daughters Receive the Same Education as Sons?
# Which is more Effective, Theory or Practice?
# On Training
# That One Should Disdain Hardships
# That Kings Also Should Study Philosophy
# That Exile is not an Evil
# Will the Philosopher Prosecute Anyone for Personal Injury?
# What means of Livelihood is Appropriate for a Philosopher?
# On Sexual Indulgence
# What is the Chief End of Marriage
# Is Marriage a Handicap for the Pursuit of Philosophy?
# Should Every Child that is Born be Raised?
# Must One Obey One&#x27;s Parents under all Circumstances?
# What is the Best Viaticum for Old Age?
# On Food
# On Clothing and Shelter
# On Furnishings
# On Cutting the Hair

==Philosophy==

His philosophy, which is in many respects identical with that of his pupil, Epictetus, is marked by its strong practical tendency. The philosophy he would have everyone cultivate is not a mere matter of words, of instruction, or of the school; but one that everyone by their own reflection and practice may pursue for himself. Still, he considers it becoming in a philosopher to wear the philosopher&#x27;s robe, to allow the hair to grow, and to retire from general society. At the same time he is convinced of the power of philosophy over the minds of people; by it he hopes to heal all the corruption of the human mind. His philosophy consists entirely of the rules for the conduct of life; all knowledge ought to be serviceable to action. He does not reject logic: he regards it as a proof of a weak mind to decline to examine the fallacy which perplexes it; yet at the same time he expresses his disgust at the multitude of dogmas which fed the vanity of the sophists. He gives only a little attention to the physical doctrines of the Stoics; he asserts that the gods know all things without need of reasoning, since to them nothing can be obscure or unknown. The human soul he considers to be akin to the gods, and agrees with other Stoics that the soul is material, which after being corrupted by bodily influence, may be again purified and cleansed. He strongly asserts the liberty of the rational soul ().

Musonius pays much more attention to ethics than logic or physics; for he holds that philosophy is nothing else than an investigation and practice of what is becoming and obligatory; and philosophy, he says, is merely the pursuit of a virtuous life. He requires that all people, both men and women, should cultivate philosophy as the only sure road to virtue. He agrees that it is easy to follow one&#x27;s own nature, and the only great impediment which he can find to a truly moral life is the prejudices with which the mind is filled from childhood, and the evil habits confirmed by practices. Thus he regards philosophy as the mental art of healing, and lays great stress on the practice of virtue, preferring practice to precept. He distinguishes two kinds of practice: the exercise of the mind in reflection and the adoption of good rules in life, and the endurance of bodily pains which affect both the soul and the body.

A life lived according to nature consists in social, friendly sentiments and temper, and in contentment with what will simply alleviate the primary needs of nature. He combats all selfishness, and regards marriage not merely as becoming and natural, but as the principle of the family and state, and the preservation of the whole human race. He zealously protests against the exposure of children as an unnatural custom, and at every opportunity recommends the practice of . His precepts for the simple life are carefully detailed, and he gives precise regulations for diet, the care of the body, clothing, and even furniture. Thus he recommends that the hair should be allowed to grow long and not cut too close; and he honours the beard on the basis that the hair was provided by nature for covering the body. He forbids meat, and prefers food which is furnished and offered by nature to that which requires the art of cooking.

Musonius argued because men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s capacity to understand virtue is the same, both should be trained in philosophy.

<doc id="162060" wikidata="Q469118" url="?curid=162060" title="Gaius Calpurnius Piso (conspirator)">
<text>Gaius Calpurnius Piso (died AD 65) was a Roman senator in the first century. He was the focal figure in the Pisonian conspiracy of AD 65, the most famous and wide-ranging plot against the throne of Emperor Nero.

==Character and early life==

He was the son of the consul Lucius Calpurnius Piso and his wife Licinia, daughter of the consul Marcus Licinius Crassus Frugi and sister of Marcus Licinius Crassus Frugi, a senator.

Piso was extremely well liked throughout Rome. Through his father he inherited connections with many distinguished families, and from his mother great wealth. Piso came from the ancient and noble house of the Calpurnii and he distributed his great wealth among many beneficiaries of all Roman social classes. Among a wide range of interests, Piso sang on the tragic stage, wrote poetry, played an expert game of Latrunculi, and owned the villa Pisoni at Baiae. 

Piso was tall, good-looking, affable, and an excellent orator and advocate in the courts. Despite these facts Piso&#x27;s overall integrity was questionable. According to Tacitus, Piso used his eloquence to defend his fellow citizens and was generous and gracious in speech, but lacked earnestness and was overly ostentatious, while craving the sensual. In AD 40, the Emperor Caligula banished Piso from Rome after he took a fancy to Piso&#x27;s wife, Livia Orestilla. Caligula forced Piso&#x27;s wife to leave him, and then accused Piso of adultery with her in order to establish cause for banishment. Piso would return to Rome one year later, after Caligula&#x27;s assassination. He later married Atria Galla, after she left her first husband Domitius Silus.

==Pisonian conspiracy and death==

Claudius recalled Piso to Rome, probably soon after his accession in AD 41. He was suffect consul in an unknown year. Piso then became a powerful senator during the reign of Emperor Nero and in AD 65 led a secret initiative to replace Emperor Nero that became known as the Pisonian conspiracy.

Piso leveraged senatorial anger with Nero to gain power. Already in AD 62, there had been talk among those of senatorial rank, in the nobility, and among the &quot;equites&quot; that Nero was ruining Rome. By AD 65, the city had endured the Great Fire of Rome, spurring groups of conspirators to come together under the leadership of Piso with the goal of killing Nero.

On 19 April AD 65, the freedman Milichus betrayed Piso&#x27;s plot to kill the emperor and the conspirators were all arrested. In all, 19 were put to death and 13 exiled, reflecting the massive scope of the conspiracy. Piso was ordered to commit suicide and so he killed himself. His properties including the Villa Pisoni in Baiae were confiscated to become imperial property.

Piso was survived by his son, Calpurnius Piso Galerianus, who married Calpurnia, daughter of Licinia Magna and Lucius Calpurnius Piso, who served as one of the consuls in AD 57. Galerianus was executed in AD 70 for opposing the Emperor Vespasian.

==Legacy==
Piso is probably the one referred to by Calpurnius Siculus under the name of &quot;Meliboeus&quot;, and he is the subject of the panegyric &quot;De laude Pisonis&quot; (&quot;On the praise of Piso&quot;).

<text>Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso (c. 44/43 BCAD 20) was a Roman statesman during the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius. He served as consul in 7 BC, after which he was appointed governor of Hispania and consul of Africa. Piso is best known for being accused of poisoning and killing Germanicus, the heir of emperor Tiberius.

==Family==
He was a member of the &quot;gens Calpurnia&quot;, specifically among the &quot;Calpurnii Pisones&quot;. His father and grandfather both shared his name, with his father being Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso (consul in 23 BC), and his grandfather being one of the participants in the Catilinarian conspiracy. He had a brother, Lucius Calpurnius Piso, who was an augur and became consul in 1 BC.

Piso was married to Munatia Plancina, a woman of noble rank and wealth. By Plancina, Piso had two sons, Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, who after Piso&#x27;s death had to take the name of Lucius Calpurnius Piso (consul in AD 27), and Marcus Calpurnius Piso.

==Career==
Piso held several positions under Augustus and Tiberius. Ronald Syme infers that Piso was a military tribune in the Spanish campaigns of 26–25 BC. This accords with his known tenure as &quot;triumvir monetalis&quot; in 23 BC. Between that office and being appointed quaestor, which enabled him entry into the Roman Senate, Syme infers Piso was married. Syme fills the gap between those events and his consulate with various activities, such as accompanying his friend Claudius Nero in his Alpine campaign. At some date between 5 BC and AD 2 he was admitted to the College of Pontiffs.

In 3 BC he was proconsul of the province of Africa, and of Hispania Tarraconensis in AD 9. According to Tacitus, he was cruel to the people of Spain, but during his trial in AD 20 such claims were discounted as &quot;old and irrelevant&quot;.

Though he was given many appointments throughout his career, Piso was known to have a temper. In AD 16, he argued against Tiberius that the senate should be able to conduct business without the emperor if the emperor was away from Rome. It was only after a lengthy debate between Piso and senators close to Tiberius that he lost the debate.

===Governorship of Syria===
In AD 17, heir designate Germanicus was given command of the eastern portion of the empire and Piso was appointed as his legate, and made governor of Syria. This appointment came with the command of four legions. Though both Piso and Germanicus were of the same rank, Germanicus had greater authority (&quot;imperium maius&quot;). Tacitus suggests that Piso was appointed to act as a check on Germanicus, and that he was given secret instructions by Tiberius to thwart his efforts and control him.

In the summer of 19, Germanicus had left to take care of matters in Egypt, and when he returned he found that Piso had ignored his orders to the cities and the legions. Germanicus was furious and ordered Piso&#x27;s recall to Rome. During the feud, Germanicus fell ill and, though Piso had left the province, Germanicus claimed Piso had poisoned him. Piso received a letter from Germanicus renouncing their friendship (&quot;amicitia&quot;). On 10 October, Germanicus died from the illness. Upon hearing of Germanicus&#x27; death, he returned to resume command of Syria.

==Trial==
As the death of Germanicus occurred during their feud most people suspected him of having poisoned Germanicus, although this was never proven. The armed attempt by Piso to regain control of Syria immediately after the death of Germanicus only aroused more indignation. This, the rumors of him poisoning Germanicus, and his conduct going back as far as his governorship of Spain were all taken up by the &quot;delatores&quot; in their accusations against him. It wasn&#x27;t long before the matter was taken to the Emperor.

Tiberius was forced to order an investigation, and after briefly hearing both sides, decided to defer the case to the senate. Tiberius made no effort to conceal his sentiments: the Pisones were longtime supporters of the Claudians, with their support going back to the early days of Octavian. A public trial was held, and Tiberius made allowances for Piso to summon witnesses of all social orders, including slaves, and he was given more time to plead than the prosecution, but it made no difference: before the sentencing, Piso had died. He committed suicide, though Tacitus supposes that Tiberius may have had him murdered, fearing his own implication in Germanicus&#x27; death.

The accusations brought against Piso are numerous, including:

*Insubordination 
*Corruption 
*Abandoning and reentering a province 
*Summary justice 
*Destroying military discipline 
*Misusing the &quot;fiscus principis&quot; (emperor&#x27;s money) 
*Fomenting civil war 
*Violating the divinity of &quot;Divus Augustus&quot; (sacrilege).
Although the murder of Germanicus was one of the accusations brought against him, he was only actually found guilty of abandoning and reentering Syria without authorisation to wage war, and for violating Germanicus&#x27; &quot;imperium&quot;, for, although they were both of proconsular rank, his authority was less than that of Germanicus, to whom the senate had given greater authority (&quot;imperium maius&quot;) in the eastern provinces before his departure in AD 17.

In accordance with the &quot;lex Iulia maiestatis&quot;, the senate had his property proscribed, forbade mourning on his account, removed images of his likeness, such as statues and portraits, and his name was erased from the base of one statue in particular as part of his &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;. Additionally, the senate instructed the &quot;curatores locorum publicorum iudicandorum&quot; to remove and destroy structures built above Porta Fontinalis to connect his properties. Yet, in a show of clemency not unlike that of the emperor, the senate had Piso&#x27;s property returned and divided equally between his two sons, on condition that his daughter Calpurnia be given 1,000,000 sesterces as dowry and a further 4,000,000 as personal property. His wife Plancina was absolved. Allegedly Munatia Plancina was convicted of very serious crimes. But her powerful friend Livia, the mother of emperor Tiberius, fought for her and exerted pressure on Tiberius. Therefore, her acquittal was foreseeable and she dissociated herself from her husband Piso who committed suicide. A recently discovered senate resolution also confirms that Munatia Plancina owed her impunity to the recommendation of Tiberius, who had been pressed by Livia to act in this way. But after the death of Livia in 29 AD, Plancina no longer had such a powerful protectress. So in 33 AD Tiberius renewed the charge. Plancina committed suicide before the judgement.

Piso&#x27;s accomplices, a Visellius Karus and a Sempronius Bassus, were to be declared outlaws for committing treason. Their property was to be sold with profits consigned to the &quot;aerarium&quot;. It is unclear whether or not their case was handled by a judicial authority, such as a &quot;quaestio&quot;, or by the senate as well.

==Character==
Piso was recorded as a man of violent temper, without an idea of obedience, and natural arrogance who saw himself as superior to the children of Tiberius. Tacitus further alleged that Piso&#x27;s marriage to Plancina, a woman of noble rank and wealth, only inflamed his ambition.

Seneca, in &quot;On Anger&quot;, speaks negatively of Piso. A legionary who returned from a foraging mission without his partner and was unable to explain where his friend was. Piso, suspecting murder, accused the legionary and sentenced him to death without offering him time to search for the missing soldier. The centurion at the time was given the order to behead the accused. Fortunately for the legionary, before the centurion could swing the sword, the missing soldier walked into the camp and the execution was stopped. All three men went to Gnaeus Piso to show that the legionary had returned.
To this Piso ordered all three men to be beheaded: the first because he lost his friend; the centurion because he failed to obey his orders; and the third for getting lost. Wrath had found a way to think up three crimes where there was none.

==Portrayals==
He was played by John Phillips in the ITV series &quot;The Caesars&quot;, and by Stratford Johns in the BBC TV serial &quot;I, Claudius&quot;.

<doc id="162063" wikidata="Q712746" url="?curid=162063" title="Frank Norris">
<text>Benjamin Franklin Norris Jr. (March 5, 1870 – October 25, 1902) was an American journalist and novelist during the Progressive Era, whose fiction was predominantly in the naturalist genre. His notable works include &quot;McTeague: A Story of San Francisco&quot; (1899), &quot;The Octopus: A Story of California&quot; (1901) and &quot;The Pit&quot; (1903).

==Life==
Norris was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1870. His father, Benjamin, was a self-made Chicago businessman and his mother, Gertrude Glorvina Doggett, had a stage career. In 1884 the family moved to San Francisco where Benjamin went into real estate. In 1887, after the death of his brother and a brief stay in London, young Norris went to Académie Julian in Paris where he studied painting for two years and was exposed to the naturalist novels of Émile Zola. Between 1890 and 1894 he attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he became acquainted with the ideas of human evolution of Darwin and Spencer that are reflected in his later writings. His stories appeared in the undergraduate magazine at Berkeley and in the &quot;San Francisco Wave&quot;. After his parents&#x27; divorce he went east and spent a year in the English Department of Harvard University. There he met Lewis E. Gates, who encouraged his writing. He worked as a news correspondent in South Africa (1895–96) for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, and then as editorial assistant for the &quot;San Francisco Wave&quot; (1896–97). He worked for &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; as a war correspondent in Cuba during the Spanish–American War in 1898. He joined the New York City publishing firm of Doubleday &amp; Page in 1899.

During his time at the University of California, Berkeley, Norris was a brother in the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta and was an originator of the Skull &amp; Keys society. Because of his involvement with a prank during the Class Day Exercises in 1893, the annual alumni dinner held by each Phi Gamma Delta chapter still bears his name. In 1900 Frank Norris married Jeannette Black. They had a child in 1902. 

Norris died in San Francisco on October 25, 1902, of peritonitis from a ruptured appendix. This left &quot;The Epic of the Wheat&quot; trilogy unfinished. He was 32. He is buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland, California.
Charles Gilman Norris, the author&#x27;s younger brother, became a well regarded novelist and editor. C. G. Norris was also the husband of the prolific novelist Kathleen Norris. The Bancroft Library of the University of California, Berkeley, houses the archives of all three writers.

==Career==
Frank Norris&#x27;s work often includes depictions of suffering caused by corrupt and greedy turn-of-the-century corporate monopolies. In &quot;The Octopus: A California Story&quot;, the Pacific and Southwest Railroad is implicated in the suffering and deaths of a number of ranchers in Southern California. At the end of the novel, after a bloody shootout between farmers and railroad agents at one of the ranches (named Los Muertos), readers are encouraged to take a &quot;larger view&quot; that sees that &quot;through the welter of blood at the irrigating ditch ... the great harvest of Los Muertos rolled like a flood from the Sierras to the Himalayas to feed thousands of starving scarecrows on the barren plains of India&quot;. Though free-wheeling market capitalism causes the deaths of many of the characters in the novel, this &quot;larger view always ... discovers the Truth that will, in the end, prevail, and all things, surely, inevitably, resistlessly work together for good&quot;.

The novel &quot;Vandover and the Brute&quot;, written in the 1890s, but not published until after his death, is about three college friends preparing to become successful, and the ruin of one due to a degenerate lifestyle.

In addition to Zola&#x27;s, Norris&#x27;s writing has been compared to that of Stephen Crane, Theodore Dreiser, and Edith Wharton.

==Critical reception==
Although some of his novels remain highly admired, aspects of Norris&#x27;s work have not fared well with literary critics in the late 20th and early 21st century. As Donald Pizer writes &quot;Frank Norris&#x27;s racism, which included the most vicious anti-Semitic portrayals in any major work of American literature, has long been an embarrassment to admirers of the vigor and intensity of his best fiction and has also contributed to the decline of his reputation during the past several generations.&quot; Other scholars have confirmed Norris&#x27;s antisemitism. Norris&#x27;s work is often seen as strongly influenced by the scientific racism of the late 19th century, such as that espoused by his professor at the University of California, Berkeley, Joseph LeConte. Along with his contemporary Jack London, Norris is seen as &quot;reconstructing American identity as a biological category of Anglo-Saxon masculinity.&quot; In Norris&#x27;s work, critics have seen evidence of racism, antisemitism, and contempt for immigrants and the working poor, all of whom are seen as the losers in a Social-Darwinist struggle for existence.

==Legacy==

* Norris&#x27;s novel &quot;The Pit&quot; was adapted for the theater by Channing Pollock in four acts. Produced by William A. Brady, the play premiered at New York&#x27;s Lyric Theatre on February 10, 1904. A film adaptation of &quot;The Pit&quot; was produced in 1917, by William A. Brady&#x27;s Picture Plays Inc.
* Norris&#x27;s short story &quot;A Deal in Wheat&quot; (1903) and the novel &quot;The Pit&quot; were the basis for the 1909 D.W. Griffith film &quot;A Corner in Wheat&quot;. 
* Norris&#x27;s &quot;Moran of the Lady Letty&quot; was adapted by Monte M. Katterjohn in 1922. Directed by George Melford, the film starred Rudolph Valentino and Dorothy Dalton.
* Norris&#x27;s &quot;McTeague&quot; has been filmed twice. The best known version is the 1924 film entitled &quot;Greed&quot; directed by Erich von Stroheim. An earlier adaptation, &quot;Life&#x27;s Whirlpool&quot;, was produced in 1915 by the World Film Corporation, starring Fania Marinoff and Holbrook Blinn.
* In 1962 the Frank Norris Cabin was designated a National Historic Landmark.
* An opera by William Bolcom, based loosely on his 1899 novel, &quot;McTeague&quot;, was premiered by Chicago&#x27;s Lyric Opera in 1992. The work is in two acts, with libretto by Arnold Weinstein and Robert Altman. The Lyric Opera&#x27;s presentation featured Ben Heppner in the title role and Catherine Malfitano as Trina, the dentist&#x27;s wife.
* In 2008, the Library of America selected Norris&#x27;s newspaper article &quot;Hunting Human Game&quot; for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime.
* An alley-way in San Francisco is named for him (Frank Norris Place). It runs from Polk St. to Larkin St. and is located parallel to and in between Pine St. and Bush St. in the city&#x27;s Lower Nob Hill district.
* A tavern on San Francisco&#x27;s Polk Street, near Frank Norris Place, is named McTeague&#x27;s Saloon in honor of Norris&#x27;s novel &quot;McTeague&quot; (1899). The interior and exterior are decorated with objects and imagery associated with the novel.
* The popular writing quip, &quot;I hate writing, but love having written&quot; is credited to a letter of writing advice written by Norris, published posthumously in 1915.

<text>Tobago () is an island and ward within the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. It is located northeast of the larger island of Trinidad and about off the northeastern coast of Venezuela. It lies to the southeast of Grenada and southwest of Barbados. 

== Etymology ==
Tobago was named &quot;Belaforme&quot; by Christopher Columbus &quot;because from a distance it seemed beautiful&quot;. The Spanish friar Antonio Vázquez de Espinosa wrote that the Kalina (mainland Caribs) called the island &quot;Urupina&quot; because of its resemblance to a big snail, while the Kalinago (Island Caribs) called it &quot;Aloubaéra&quot;, supposedly because it resembled the &quot;alloüebéra&quot;, a giant snake which was supposed to live in a cave on the island of Dominica. The earliest known record of the use of the name &quot;Tabaco&quot; to refer to the island is a Spanish royal order issued in 1511. That name was inspired by the resemblance of the shape of the island to the fat cigars smoked by the Taíno inhabitants of the Greater Antilles.

== History ==

===Indigenous Tobago===

Tobago was settled by indigenous people belonging to the Ortoiroid cultural tradition some time between 3500 and 1000 BCE. In the first century of the Common Era, Saladoid people settled in Tobago. They brought with them pottery-making and agricultural traditions, and are likely to have introduced crops which included cassava, sweet potatoes, Indian yam, tannia and corn. Saladoid cultural traditions were later modified by the introduction of the Barrancoid culture, either by trade or a combination of trade and settlement. After 650 CE, the Saladoid culture was replaced by the Troumassoid tradition in Tobago. Troumassoid traditions were once thought to represent the settlement of the Island Caribs in the Lesser Antilles and Tobago, but this is now associated with the Cayo ceramic tradition. No archaeological sites exclusively associated with the Cayo tradition are known from Tobago.

Tobago&#x27;s location made it an important point of connection between the Kalinago of the Lesser Antilles and their Kalina allies and trading partners in the Guianas and Venezuela. In the 1630s Tobago was inhabited by the Kalina, while the neighbouring island of Grenada was shared by the Kalina and Kalinago.

Columbus sighted Tobago on 14 August 1498, during his fourth voyage, but he did not land. The Spanish settlers in Hispaniola were authorised to conduct slave raids against the island in a royal order issued in 1511. These raids, which continued until at least the 1620s, decimated the island&#x27;s population.

===European colonization===

In 1628, Dutch settlers established the first European settlement in Tobago, a colony they called Nieuw Walcheren at Great Courland Bay. They also built a fort, Nieuw Vlissingen, near the modern town of Plymouth. The settlement was abandoned in 1630 after indigenous attacks, but was re-established in 1633. The new colony was destroyed by the Spanish in Trinidad after the Dutch supported a Nepoyo-led revolt in Trinidad. Attempts by the English to colonize Tobago in the 1630s and 1640s also failed due to indigenous resistance.

The indigenous population also prevented European colonization in the 1650s, including an attempt by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, but the Polish or Lithuanian explorers did not colonize the Island of Tobago, who colonized the island intermittently between 1637 and 1690. Over the ensuing years, the Curonians (Duchy of Courland), Dutch, English, French, Spanish and Swedish had caused Tobago to become a focal point in repeated attempts of colonization, which led to the island having changed hands 33 times, the most in Caribbean history, before the Treaty of Paris ceded it to the British in 1814. In 1662, the Dutch brothers Adrian and Cornelius Lampsins were granted the title of &quot;Barons of Tobago,&quot; and ruled until the English captured the island in 1666. Adrian briefly recaptured Tobago in 1673, but was killed in battle when the English, under Sir Tobias Bridge, yet again took control of the island.

From about 1672, during the temporary English rule of 1672–1674, Tobago had a period of stability during which plantation culture began. Sugar, cotton and indigo factories sprang up and Africans were imported by the British to work as slaves. The economy flourished. France had abandoned the island to Britain in 1763, and by 1777 Tobago was exporting great quantities of cotton, indigo, rum and sugar. 

In 1781, the French retook the island during the Invasion of Tobago. On 24 May 1781, the fleet of Comte de Grasse landed troops on the island under the command of General Marquis de Bouillé. By 2 June 1781, they had successfully gained control of the island.

===British rule and independence===
In 1814, when the island again came under British control, another phase of successful sugar-production began. But a severe hurricane in 1847, combined with the collapse of plantation underwriters, end of slavery in 1834 and the competition from sugar with other European countries, marked the end of the sugar trade. In 1889, the island became a ward of Trinidad. Without sugar, the islanders had to grow other crops, planting acres of limes, coconuts and cocoa and exporting their produce to Trinidad. In 1963, Hurricane Flora ravaged Tobago, destroying the villages and crops. A restructuring programme followed and attempts were made to diversify the economy. The development of a tourist industry began.

Trinidad and Tobago obtained independence from the British Empire in August 1962 and became a republic on 31 August 1976.

== Geography ==
Tobago has a land area of 300 km2 and is approximately long and wide. It is located at latitude 11° 15&#x27; N, longitude 60° 40&#x27; W, slightly north of Trinidad.

The island of Tobago is the main exposed portion of the Tobago terrane, a fragment of crustal material lying between the Caribbean and South American Plates. Tobago is primarily hilly, mountainous and of volcanic origin. The southwest of the island is flat and consists largely of coralline limestone. The mountainous spine of the island is called the Main Ridge. The highest point in Tobago is the Pigeon Peak near Speyside.

=== Climate ===
The climate is tropical, and the island lies just south of the Atlantic Main Development Region, making it vulnerable to occasional low-latitude tropical cyclones. Average rainfall varies between on the Main Ridge to less than in the southwest. There are two seasons: a wet season between June and December, and a dry season between January and May.

==== Hurricanes ====
The island was struck by Hurricane Flora in 1963. The effects were so severe that they changed the face of Tobago&#x27;s economy. The hurricane laid waste to the banana, coconut, and cacao plantations that largely sustained the economy, and it wreaked considerable damage on the largely pristine tropical rainforest that makes up a large proportion of the interior of the island&#x27;s northern half. Many of the plantations were subsequently abandoned, and the economy changed direction away from cash crop agriculture and toward tourism. Hurricane Ivan, while less severe than Flora, also caused significant damage in 2004.

== Government ==
Central and local government functions in Tobago are handled by the Tobago House of Assembly. The current Chief Secretary of Tobago is Farley Chavez Augustine from the Progressive Democratic Patriots, which controls 14 of the 15 seats in the Assembly, with the Tobago Council of the People&#x27;s National Movement led by Ancil Dennis controlling one seat since the December 2021 Tobago House of Assembly election.

Tobago is represented by two seats in the Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago, Tobago East and Tobago West. The two seats are controlled by the Tobago Council of the People&#x27;s National Movement, which won and retained them in the 2015 and 2020 Trinidad and Tobago general election.

=== Districts ===

Historically, Tobago was divided into seven parishes (Saint Andrew, Saint David, Saint George, Saint John, Saint Mary, Saint Patrick and Saint Paul). In 1768 each parish of Tobago nominated representatives to the Tobago House of Assembly. On 20 October 1889 the British crown implemented a Royal Order in Council constituting Tobago as a ward of Trinidad, thus terminating local government on Tobago and forming a unified colony government.

In 1945 when the county council system was first introduced, Tobago was administered as a single county of Trinidad.

In 1980 provisions were made for the Tobago House of Assembly to be revived as an entity providing local government in Tobago. Under the revived system, Tobago is made up of 12 local electoral districts with each district electing one Assemblyman to the THA.

==Demographics==
The population was 60,874 at the 2011 census. The capital, Scarborough, has a population of 17,537. While Trinidad is multiethnic, Tobago&#x27;s population is primarily of African descent, with a growing proportion of Trinidadians of East Indian descent and Europeans. Between 2000 and 2011, the population of Tobago grew by 12.55 percent, making it one of the fastest-growing areas of Trinidad and Tobago.

===Ancestry and ethnicity===

===Religion===
== Economy ==




Tobago&#x27;s main economy is based on tourism, fishing, and government spending, government spending being the largest. The local governing body, the Tobago House of Assembly (THA), employs 62% of the labor force.

Tourism is still a fledgling industry. Conventional beach and water-sports tourism is largely in the southwest around the airport and the coastal strip. Meanwhile, ecotourism is growing in significance, much of it focused on the large area of protected forest in the centre and north of the main island and on Little Tobago, a small island off the main island&#x27;s northeast tip.

The southwestern tourist area around Crown Point, Store Bay, Buccoo Reef, and Pigeon Point has large expanses of sand and is dominated by resort-type developments. Tobago has many idyllic beaches along its coastline, especially those at Castara, Bloody Bay, and Englishman&#x27;s Bay. Tobago is linked to the world through the Arthur Napoleon Raymond Robinson International Airport (formerly Crown Point Airport) and Scarborough harbour. Domestic flights connect Tobago with Trinidad, and international flights connect with the Caribbean and Europe. There is a daily fast ferry service between Port of Spain and Scarborough.

Tobago&#x27;s economy is tightly linked with Trinidad&#x27;s, which is based on liquefied natural gas (LNG), petrochemicals, and steel. 

=== Diving ===
Tobago is also a popular diving location, since it is the southernmost of the Caribbean islands that have coral communities. Trinidad, which is further south, has no significant coral because of low salinity and high silt content, the result of its position close to the mouth of Venezuela&#x27;s Orinoco River. Scuba diving on Tobago tends to be centred at Speyside, almost diametrically across the island from the airport. 

The island has some of the best diving sites in the Caribbean. There are three wrecks located around its shores, but the one usually considered the best is the &quot;Maverick Ferry&quot;, which used to travel between Trinidad and Tobago. The ferry is long and has been sunk in just off Rocky Point, Mt. Irvine. The top of the wreck is at . The wreck has an abundance of marine life, including a jewfish, a member of the grouper family. The wreck was purposely sunk for divers, and so all the doors and windows were removed. The waters around the island are home to many species of tropical fish, rays, sharks, and turtles.

===Golf===
Tobago is home to two golf courses, both of which are open to visitors. The older of the two is Mount Irvine Hotel Golf Course, built in 1968. It was seen throughout the world after hosting the popular golf show &quot;Shell&#x27;s Wonderful World of Golf&quot;. The course is built amongst coconut palms and has a view of the Caribbean Sea from almost every hole. Formerly known as Tobago Plantations Golf Course, the recently renamed Magdalena Grand Hotel &amp; Golf Club was opened in 2001 and has hosted the European Seniors Tour on three occasions. 

== In art ==

=== &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; ===
Tobago roughly matches the size and location of the island in &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, described as being located close to Trinidad and the mouth of Orinoco. However, the book is generally thought to be based on the experiences of Alexander Selkirk, who was marooned in the Pacific&#x27;s Juan Fernández Islands, on the island later named after Robinson Crusoe. On Tobago, there is Crusoe Cave.

===&quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot;===

In 1958, Tobago was chosen by the Walt Disney Company as the setting for a film based upon the Johann Wyss novel &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot;. When producers saw the island for the first time, they &quot;fell instantly in love&quot;. The script required animals, which were brought from all around the world, including eight dogs, two giant tortoises, forty monkeys, two elephants, six ostriches, four zebras, one hundred flamingos, six hyenas, two anacondas, and one tiger.

Filming locations include Richmond Bay (the Robinsons beach), Mount Irvine Bay (the Pirates beach), and the Craig Hall Waterfalls. The treehouse was constructed in a 200-foot tall saman in the Goldsborough Bay area. After filming, locals convinced Disney, who had intended to remove all evidence of filmmaking, to let the treehouse remain, without interior furnishing. In 1960, the treehouse was listed for sale for $9,000, a fraction of its original cost, and became a popular attraction before the structure was destroyed by Hurricane Flora in 1963. The tree still remains, however, and is located on the property of the Roberts Auto Service and Tyre Shop, located in Goldsborough, just off of Windward Road. A local Tobago resident says, &quot;The tree has fallen into obscurity; only a few of the older people knew of its significance. As a matter of fact, not many people know of the film &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot;, much less that it was filmed here in Tobago.&quot;

== Ecology ==

The Tobago Forest Reserve (Main Ridge Reserve) is the oldest protected rain forest in the Western hemisphere and is biodiverse. It was designated a protected Crown reserve on 17 April 1776 after representations by Soame Jenyns, a Member of Parliament in Britain responsible for Tobago&#x27;s development. It has remained a protected area since.

This forested area has great biodiversity, including many species of birds (such as the dancing blue-backed manakin), mammals, frogs, (non-venomous) snakes, butterflies and other invertebrates. Tobago also has nesting beaches for the leatherback turtle, which come to shore between April and July.

The island of Tobago has multiple coral reef ecosystems. The Buccoo Reef, the Culloden Reef and Speyside Reef are the three largest coral reef marine ecosystems in Tobago. These coral reef systems protect the shores of Tobago from eroding.

Little Tobago, the small neighbouring island, supports some of the best dry forest remaining in Tobago. Little Tobago and St Giles Island are important seabird nesting colonies, with red-billed tropicbirds, magnificent frigatebirds and Audubon&#x27;s shearwaters, among others.

=== Environmental problems ===
Coral reefs have been damaged recently by silt and mud runoff during construction of a road along the northeast coast. There has also been damage to the reef in Charlotteville village caused by sealing the road at Flagstaff Hill and diverting more silty water down the stream from Flagstaff down to Charlotteville.

<text>Heinrich August Ritter (; 21 November 1791 – 3 February 1869) was a German philosopher and historian of philosophy.

He was born in Zerbst, and studied philosophy and theology at the University of Göttingen and Berlin until 1815. In 1824 he became an associate professor of philosophy at Berlin, later transferring to Kiel, where he occupied the chair of philosophy from 1833 to 1837. He then accepted a similar position at the University of Göttingen, where he remained till his death. Friedrich Schleiermacher was a major influence in his thinking.

== Works==
Ritter&#x27;s chief work was a history of philosophy (&quot;Geschichte der Philosophie&quot;) published in twelve volumes at Hamburg from 1829 to 1853. This work was the product of a wide and thorough knowledge of the subject aided by an impartial critical faculty, and its value was underscored by its translation into almost all the languages of Europe. He wrote also accounts of ancient schools of philosophy, such as the Ionians, the Pythagoreans and the Megarians.

Beside these important historical works, he published a large number of treatises of which the following may be mentioned:

* &quot;Abriss der philosophischen Logik&quot; (1824).
* &quot;Geschichte der Philosophie&quot; (1829–1853; 2nd edition, vols. i–iv, 1836–1838) — its 1st section, &quot;Geschichte der philosophie alter zeit&quot;, was translated into English by Alexander J.W. Morrison and published as: &quot;The history of ancient philosophy&quot; (1838–46). 
* &quot;Ueber das Verhältnis der Philosophie zum Leben&quot; (1835).
* &quot;Historia philosophiae Graeco-Romanae&quot; (in collaboration with Ludwig Preller, 1838; 7th edition, 1888).
* &quot;Kleine philosophische Schriften&quot; (1839–1840).
* &quot;Versuch zur Verständigung über die neueste deutsche Philosophie seit Kant&quot; (1853).
* &quot;System der Logik und Metaphysik&quot; (1856).
* &quot;Die christliche Philosophie bis auf die neuesten Zeiten&quot; (2 volumes, 1858–1859).
* &quot;Encyklopädie der philosophischen Wissenschaften&quot; (1862–1864).
* &quot;Ernest Renan, über die Naturwissenschaften und die Geschichte&quot; (1865).
* &quot;Ueber das Böse und seine Folgen&quot; (1869).

<text>Eunapius (; c. 347 - c. 420) was a Greek sophist, rhetorician, and historian from Sardis in the region of Lydia in Asia Minor. His principal surviving work is the &quot;Lives of Philosophers and Sophists&quot; (; ), a collection of the biographies of 24 philosophers and sophists.

==Life==
He was born at Sardis, around the year 347 AD. While still a youth, he went to Athens, where he became a pupil of Prohaeresius the rhetorician. Back in his native city he studied under his relative, the sophist Chrysanthius. He as well possessed considerable knowledge of medicine.

In his later years, he seems to have lived at Athens, teaching rhetoric. He was initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries by the last Hierophant, Nestorius. There is evidence that he was still living in the reign of Theodosius II as he mentions an event that happened in 414 AD. The exact date of his death is unknown but speculated around 420 AD.

==Writing==
Eunapius was the author of two works, one entitled &quot;Lives of Philosophers and Sophists&quot;, and &quot;Universal History&quot; consisting of a continuation of the history of Dexippus. The former work is still extant; of the latter only the Constantinian excerpts remain, but the facts are largely incorporated in the work of Zosimus. It embraced the history of events from AD 270–404.

The &quot;Lives of Philosophers and Sophists&quot;, a collection of the biographies of 24 older and contemporary philosophers and sophists, is valuable as the only source for the history of the (mostly neoplatonic) pagan philosophy of that period. The style of both works is marked by a spirit of bitter hostility to Christianity. Photius had before him a &quot;new edition&quot; of the history in which the passages most offensive to Christians were omitted.

The &quot;Lives of Philosophers and Sophists&quot; consists of the biographies of the following philosophers and sophists: Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, Aedesius the Cappadocian, Maximus, Priscus, Chrysanthius, Epigonus, Beronicianus, Julian of Cappadocia, Prohaeresius, Epiphanius, Diophantus the Arab, Sopolis, Himerius, Parnasius, Libanius, Acacius, Nymphidianus, Zeno of Cyprus, Magnus, Oribasius, Ionicus, and Theon.

<text>Publius Herennius Dexippus (; c. 210–273 AD), Greek historian, statesman and general, was an hereditary priest of the Eleusinian family of the Kerykes, and held the offices of &quot;archon basileus&quot; and &quot;eponymous&quot; in Athens.

==Life==
When the Heruli overran Greece and captured Athens (267), Dexippus showed great personal courage and revived the spirit of patriotism among his fellow countrymen. A statue was set up in his honour, the base of which, with an inscription recording his services, has been preserved. It is remarkable that the inscription is silent as to his military achievements.

Photius speaks very highly of the style of Dexippus, whom he calls a second Thucydides.

=== Works ===
Photius (&quot;cod&quot;. 82) mentions three historical works by Dexippus, of which considerable fragments remain:

#Τὰ μετ᾽ Ἀλέξανδρον (&quot;The Events after Alexander&quot;), apparently an epitome of a work by Arrian
#Σκυθικά (&quot;Scythica&quot;), a history of the wars of Rome with the Goths (called Scythians in archaizing language) in the 3rd century
#Χρονικὴ ἱστορία (&quot;Chronike Historia&quot;) in twelve books, probably covering a thousand years to the reign of the emperor Claudius Gothicus (270)

The &quot;Chronicle&quot; was continued by Eunapius of Sardis, who opens his own history with a critique of his predecessor. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; also appears to be the primary source of the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; between 238 and 270, but Paschoud has demonstrated that the author of the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; sometimes attributes material to Dexippus falsely and so that evidence must be used with caution.

<text>The swingout is the defining dance move of Lindy Hop.

The swingout evolved from the breakaway, which in turn evolved from the Texas Tommy. The first documented mention of the swingout pattern that resembles breakaway was in 1911, to describe a &quot;Texas Tommy Swing&quot; show done at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. Its variants are used in Jive, East Coast Swing, West Coast Swing and Modern Jive.

<text>Chrysanthius of Sardis () was a Greek philosopher of the 4th century AD who studied at the school of Iamblichus.

He was one of the favorite pupils of Aedesius, and devoted himself mainly to the mystical side of Neoplatonism. The Roman emperor Julian went to him by the advice of Aedesius, and subsequently invited him to come to the court and assist in the projected resuscitation of Hellenism. But Chrysanthius declined, citing the strength of unfavorable omens, though he probably realized the revival was unlikely to bear fruit.

For the same reason he abstained from drastic religious reforms in his capacity as high-priest of Lydia. As a result of his moderation, he remained high-priest until his death, venerated alike by Pagans and Christians. His wife Meite, who was associated with him in the priestly office, was a kinswoman of Eunapius the biographer. Eunapius, who was related to Chrysanthius by marriage, tended to him in his old age and was devoted to him until his death.

<text>George Roy Hill (December 20, 1921 – December 27, 2002) was an American actor and film director.

His films include &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (1969) and &quot;The Sting&quot; (1973), both starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford; both films also earned him nominations for the Academy Award for Best Director, winning for the latter.

Hill also directed &quot;The World of Henry Orient&quot; (1964), &quot;Hawaii&quot; (1966), &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; (1967), &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; (1972), &quot;The Great Waldo Pepper&quot; (1975), &quot;Slap Shot&quot; (1977), &quot;A Little Romance&quot; (1979), &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; (1982) and his final film &quot;Funny Farm&quot; (1988). According to one obituary &quot;few directors achieved such fame and success... even fewer enjoyed such eminence for such a short period of time.&quot;

==Early life and education==
He was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to George Roy and Helen Frances (née Owens) Hill, part of a well-to-do Roman Catholic family with interests in the newspaper business; the family owned the &quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot;. Hill was no relation to George W. Hill, director and cinematographer of numerous silent movies and early sound films in the 1920s and early 1930s. He was educated at The Blake School, one of Minnesota&#x27;s most prestigious private schools, and graduated from Yale University with a Bachelor of Music in 1943. He received his master&#x27;s degree in literature and music from Trinity College Dublin.

He had a love of flying. After school he liked to visit the airport, and his hobby was to memorize the records of World War I flying aces. He idolized pilot Speed Holman, who, Hill once explained, &quot;used to make his approach to the spectators at state fairs flying past the grandstand upside down.&quot; Hill obtained his pilot&#x27;s license at the age of sixteen. Airplanes featured prominently in his later films and are frequently crashed as well — in &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; and especially &quot;The Great Waldo Pepper&quot; which showed the influence on Hill of pilots like Speed Holman.

Hill loved classical music, especially Johann Sebastian Bach, and as an undergraduate at Yale University studied music under notable composer Paul Hindemith, graduating in 1943. His film &quot;The World of Henry Orient&quot; contains a humorous spoof-like tease of Hindemith during the piano concerto scene of Henry Orient (Peter Sellers). While at Yale, Hill was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon, the Scroll &amp; Key Society and of The Spizzwinks(?) and The Whiffenpoofs, America&#x27;s oldest collegiate a cappella singing group.

==Military service==
During World War II, Hill served in the United States Marine Corps as a transport pilot with VMR-152 in the South Pacific. The outbreak of the Korean War resulted in his recall to active duty service for 18 months as a night fighter pilot, attaining the rank of major. After the war, he was stationed at the Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point jet flight-training center in North Carolina.

==Early career==
After being discharged, Hill worked as a newspaper reporter in Texas, then took advantage of the GI Bill to do graduate work at Trinity College, Dublin, studying James Joyce&#x27;s use of music in &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. Some sources say he graduated in 1949 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in literature.

Other sources say his thesis was never completed because he became sidetracked by the Irish theater, making his stage debut as a walk-on part in 1947 at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, with Cyril Cusack&#x27;s company in a production of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot;. He had a leading role in &quot;Raven of Wicklow&quot; by Bridget G. MacCarthy in the same theater in February 1948.

===Actor===
On his return to the U.S., Hill studied theatre at HB Studio in New York City. He acted Off Broadway and toured with Margaret Webster&#x27;s Shakespeare Repertory Company. He appeared on Broadway in &quot;Richard II&quot;, &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, and August Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;Creditors&quot; (with Bea Arthur).

In 1952 he featured in a supporting role in the Hollywood movie &quot;Walk East on Beacon&quot;, and appeared in episodes of &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot; including &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Wife&quot;, &quot;Man at Bay&quot; and &quot;Masquerade&quot;. He also acted in episodes of &quot;Kraft Theatre&quot; such as &quot;The Golden Slate&quot;. He also acted on radio, including portraying Ned on &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Wife&quot;.

===Television and theatre director===
Hill used his Korean War experience as the basis for a TV drama, &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot;, which appeared on &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot;, with Hill himself in the cast. During his military service at Cherry Point, he had had to be &#x27;talked down&#x27; by a ground controller at Atlanta airport, an incident that led to his writing the screenplay. The episode was performed and transmitted live in 1953. After his demobilisation, he joined the &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot; as a writer, one of his scripts included &quot;Keep Our Honor Bright&quot;. He later directed episodes of &quot;Ponds Theater&quot; (&quot;Time of the Drought&quot;), and &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot; (&quot;The Creaking Gate&quot;, &quot;Not All Your Tears&quot;, &quot;The Happy Man&quot;.) Hill returned to Broadway in 1957 as director of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot;. Starring Jo Van Fleet and Anthony Perkins, this ran for 564 performances.

Hill continued to direct television, most notably episodes of &quot;Kraft Theatre&quot; including &quot;Eleven O&#x27;Clock Flight&quot;, &quot;The Devil as a Roaring Lion&quot;, &quot;Good Old Charlie Faye&quot;, &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;, an adaptation of Walter Lord&#x27;s book about the sinking of the Titanic (of which Hill also co-wrote the teleplay). In addition he did &quot;Man on the White Horse&quot;, &quot;Carnival&quot;, and &quot;A Real Fine Cutting Edge&quot; with George Peppard for &quot;The Kaiser Aluminum Hour&quot;. Hill&#x27;s work on &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; earned him two Emmy nominations for writing and directing at the 9th Primetime Emmy Awards. He directed some famous episodes of &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; including &quot;The Helen Morgan Story&quot; (1957), &quot;The Last Clear Chance&quot; (1958), &quot;Child of Our Time&quot; (1958), and &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; (1959).

Hill then focused on theatre, directing the Broadway productions of &quot;The Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot; (1960) with Melvyn Douglas (132 performances), &quot;Greenwillow&quot; (1960) with Anthony Perkins (97 performances) and &quot;Period of Adjustment&quot; (1961) by Tennessee Williams, which ran for 132 performances. He replaced Elia Kazan for the latter.

===Feature film director===

Hill&#x27;s success as a theatre director led to his first feature as director – the film version of &quot;Period of Adjustment&quot; (1962). Starring Jane Fonda and Jim Hutton, it was a box office success. He was meant to follow with an adaptation of &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot; by William Shirer at MGM for producer John Houseman but it was not made. In light of that his next project was an adaptation of Lillian Hellman&#x27;s &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; (1963) starring Dean Martin. Hill&#x27;s next step was a movie based on the novel &quot;The World of Henry Orient&quot; (1964). Hill and producer Jerome Hellman bought the rights for their own Pan Arts Company. The movie was critically acclaimed but was a commercial disappointment.

Hill was hired to direct the blockbuster &quot;Hawaii&quot; (1966) after Fred Zinnemann pulled out. Reportedly, when budget estimates reached $14 million, the producers attempted to replace Hill with Arthur Hiller, but abandoned the idea after hundreds of native Polynesians in the cast went on strike, declaring: &quot;We can and will perform only for our friend, Monsieur Hill.&quot; The movie was a huge commercial success. Hill rebuilt his Hollywood reputation with the Julie Andrews musical &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; (1967) produced by Ross Hunter. Hill was fired during the editing process because he wanted to make the film shorter, whereas Universal wanted to turn it into a roadshow production. However it was a solid box office hit.

He returned to Broadway to direct &quot;Henry, Sweet Henry&quot; (1967), a musical version of &quot;The World of Henry Orient&quot;, but it only lasted for 80 performances. He was meant to follow that with a film called &quot;Hamburger Dreams&quot;, about a screenwriter in 1930s Hollywood, but it was never made. Instead, Hill had a huge commercial success with &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (1969), based on a script by William Goldman and starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford. The film received seven Academy Award nominations, including ones for Best Picture and Best Director, and won four, including for Best Original Song, &quot;Raindrops Keep Fallin&#x27; on My Head&quot; at the 42nd Academy Awards. In 1970, he said a common theme of his films was innocence vs evil. Hill followed it with &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; (1972). &quot;Most of the characters in my film are not too bright,&quot; he said in a 1972 interview.

Hill was reunited with Newman and Redford in &quot;The Sting&quot; (1973), which won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director at the 46th Academy Awards. The success of &quot;Butch Cassidy&quot; and &quot;The Sting&quot; meant that, for a time, Hill was the only director in history to have made two of the top 10 money-making films. Hill disliked tardiness on set. Paul Newman said of his time (as Butch Cassidy) on &quot;Butch Cassidy&quot;: &quot;If you weren’t on time, he’d take you up in his airplane. Scare the bejesus out of us.&quot;

===Later career===
&quot;The Great Waldo Pepper&quot; (1975) was based on a story by Hill, with a script by William Goldman and starring Robert Redford. However, it was a commercial disappointment. Around that time he said in an interview: &quot;Just as I play nothing but Bach for pleasure, so do I read nothing but history for pleasure. I like to be able to sit back and pick out the most fascinating facets of an era. You have a better perspective. In the present, you get too caught up in the heat of the emotions of the moment.&quot;

In August 1974, Hill signed an exclusive five-year contract with Universal to make projects following &quot;Pepper&quot;. &quot;Why shouldn&#x27;t we give George that kind of deal?&quot; said studio executive Jennings Lang. &quot;He&#x27;s the complete filmmaker. He can put a blank piece of paper in the typewriter and make a movie out of it up to and including the music.&quot; Hill made &quot;Slap Shot&quot; (1977), a popular sports comedy with Paul Newman. His next film was &quot;A Little Romance&quot; (1979), and &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; (1982), with Robin Williams and Glenn Close, in her film debut. He also directed &quot;The Little Drummer Girl&quot; (1984) with Diane Keaton.

His last film was &quot;Funny Farm&quot; (1988) with Chevy Chase. Screenwriter Jeffrey Boam said, &quot;George wanted to do a much classier version than I ever imagined it to be. I imagined it to be a little cruder, more low-brow humor, rougher and more like the movies Chevy was doing at the time, but George was a classy guy and he wasn’t going to do that ... I think a lot of Chevy’s fans were let down because it wasn’t as raucous and vulgar as they might have expected.&quot;

During his later years he taught drama at Yale.

==Personal life and death==
In the Margaret Webster theatre company, Hill met Louisa Horton, whom he married on April 7, 1951. They later divorced. Hill was survived by Horton, their two sons, including George Roy Hill III and John Hill, two daughters, and 12 grandchildren.

After his second return to civilian life, Hill bought an open-cockpit Waco biplane built in 1930, which he retained until about ten years before his death.

According to a 2012 article in The New Yorker by John Colapinto, director Hill handpicked inexperienced 16-year-old actress Tippy Walker from hundreds of actresses who auditioned for the role of &quot;Val&quot; in the 1964 film The World of Henry Orient and then reshaped the film during editing to focus on her character. According to Colapinto, in the 2000s Walker revealed through a series of posts on IMDb that she and Hill began a relationship during filming that lasted throughout most of Walker&#x27;s senior year in high school, even though Hill was married with children and, at age 44, nearly 30 years older than Walker. In the posts Colapinto attributes to Walker, the retired actress describes being sexually assaulted by Hill as a 16-year-old while they were alone in his office and states that Hill, without warning, began aggressively French-kissing her. Walker also claimed that Hill swore her to secrecy about the resulting relationship, then himself told others, and she states the resulting Hollywood gossip made potential employers reluctant to cast her, contributing to her decision to stop acting in the early 1970s.

Hill died from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan on December 27, 2002, aged 81.

<text>Jodie Lee Ann Sweetin (born January 19, 1982) is an American actress and television personality. She is best known for her role as Stephanie Tanner in the ABC comedy series &quot;Full House&quot; and its Netflix sequel series &quot;Fuller House&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Sweetin was born in Los Angeles, California. While an infant, her parents were sent to prison and she was adopted and raised as an only child by her uncle Sam Sweetin and his second wife Janice when she was nine months old. Her father died in a prison riot. Years later, she said she was told not to talk about her adoption publicly out of fear that people would think she was forced into acting. 

In 1999, four years after &quot;Full House&quot; ended, Sweetin graduated from Los Alamitos High School in Los Alamitos, California, and attended Chapman University in Orange, California. While in high school, Sweetin and fellow actor Matthew Morrison performed in musical theater together.

== Career ==
She began her career by appearing in several national commercials such as restaurant chain Sizzler in 1987. Sweetin was cast in a guest role in the sitcom &quot;Valerie&quot; as Pamela, the niece of Mrs. Poole (Edie McClurg). Jeff Franklin cast her as Stephanie Tanner in the ABC comedy series &quot;Full House&quot;, and she played that role until the show ended in 1995. Sweetin played the role of Tanner from age five until she was 13 years old. 

Sweetin returned to television by hosting the second season of the Fuse dance competition show &quot;Pants-Off Dance-Off&quot;. She starred in the television pilot, &quot;Small Bits of Happiness&quot;, a dark comedy centered around a suicide prevention specialist; it won Best Comedy at the 3rd Annual Independent Television Festival, in Los Angeles. In 2009, Sweetin focused on independent films and appeared in two films: &quot;Port City&quot; and &quot;Redefining Love&quot;. In 2011, she appeared in five web episodes in the Internet show &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Arrested&quot;. In 2012, she appeared as Leia in the television film &quot;Singled Out&quot;.

In 2015, it was announced Sweetin would reprise her role as Stephanie Tanner on the Netflix spin-off series &quot;Fuller House&quot;, which ended after five seasons in 2020. On March 2, 2016, Sweetin was announced as one of the celebrities to compete on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; for season 22. Her professional dance partner was Keo Motsepe. Sweetin and Motsepe were eliminated in week eight of the competition and finished in sixth place. On April 12, 2017, she starred in &quot;Hollywood Darlings&quot;, an unscripted docu-comedy series for Pop, where she plays an exaggerated version of herself. The series ran for two seasons and concluded on June 6, 2018.

In 2019, Sweetin started a podcast called &quot;Never Thought I&#x27;d Say This&quot; on parenting alongside Celia Behar, a licensed mental health counselor and Sweetin&#x27;s best friend.

In 2022, Sweetin competed on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Edge&quot;, the seventh celebrity edition of Food Network&#x27;s &quot;Worst Cooks in America&quot;: &quot;That&#x27;s So″90s&quot;, and the second season of FOX&#x27;s &quot;Name That Tune&quot;.

In 2023, Sweetin appeared in a television commercial for Sizzler, 36 years after her first commercial for the restaurant chain.

==Personal life==

As a child, Sweetin took dance lessons, including ballet and tap when she was three years old. In 2002, at age 20, Sweetin married her first husband, Los Angeles Police officer Shaun Holguin. Fellow &quot;Full House&quot; castmate Candace Cameron served as her matron of honor; Cameron&#x27;s daughter, Natasha, served as a flower girl. Sweetin and Holguin divorced in 2006.

Sweetin met Cody Herpin, a film transportation coordinator, through friends, and they started dating in May 2007. They were married in Las Vegas, Nevada on July 14, 2007. Together they have one daughter, Zoie (born 2008). On November 19, 2008, Sweetin filed for legal separation from Herpin. Their divorce was finalized on April 20, 2010.

On April 30, 2010, Sweetin&#x27;s representative confirmed that she and her boyfriend of one year, Morty Coyle, were expecting a baby. Their daughter Beatrix was born in 2010. Sweetin and Coyle became engaged in January 2011, and married on March 15, 2012, in Beverly Hills. Sweetin filed for legal separation from Coyle in June 2013. The divorce was finalized in September 2016.

On January 22, 2016, she announced her engagement to Justin Hodak, who, like Sweetin, is a recovering drug addict. On March 24, 2017, Sweetin announced the couple&#x27;s separation, after he violated a restraining order against her. Hodak was sentenced on related charges a few weeks later.

On January 17, 2022, she announced her engagement to Mescal Wasilewski. They were married on July 30, 2022.

===Substance abuse===
Sweetin started drinking alcohol when she was 14 years old, one year after &quot;Full House&quot; ended. Over parts of the next 13 years, she abused ecstasy, methamphetamine, and crack cocaine, among others, stating that she turned to drugs because she was &quot;bored&quot;. In 2009, Sweetin wrote the memoir &quot;unSweetined&quot;, chronicling her downward spiral of alcohol and drug abuse that began with the ending of &quot;Full House&quot;. In one passage of the book, Sweetin discusses breaking into tears while addressing a crowd at Wisconsin&#x27;s Marquette University while coming down from a two-day methamphetamine, cocaine, and ecstasy binge. She spoke about growing up on television and about how much her life had improved since getting sober. She said she went sober for good in December 2008, but relapsed after separating from Coyle in 2013. She later began working as a clinical logistics coordinator at a Los Angeles drug rehab center and completed her degree as a drug and alcohol counselor.

Sweetin became a public advocate for recovery from addiction.

===Political views===

Sweetin has expressed support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and she was also active with Refuse Fascism, to demand the removal of the Trump administration through nonviolent street protests.

On June 25, 2022, Sweetin was shoved by members of the Los Angeles Police Department and fell to the ground while she was protesting for abortion rights in the wake of &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, a U.S. Supreme Court decision that overruled &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; leading to abortion bans in multiple states. A representative for Sweetin reported that she is &quot;OK&quot; and the LAPD released a statement saying that the use of force would be &quot;evaluated&quot; to see whether it followed their policy and procedure.

<text>Tiendas Topeka (or Topeka Stores) was a large Puerto Rican department store chain.

==History==
Like many of his fellow Cubans, Estrella arrived in Puerto Rico in the early &#x27;60s. In Cuba he had a successful miscellaneous-wholesale operation, which he decided to start up in Puerto Rico with the help of his brother and his nephew. Following the advice of a friend, who happened to be a successful merchant in New York, Estrella decided to venture into the retail business, opening the first Topeka store on Loiza Street in Santurce in 1967. &quot;We stocked our store with some of the same articles we offered through our wholesale business and with some articles from other suppliers,&quot; recalled Estrella. “We also got a break from our friend in New York, who gave us a generous line of credit to begin our operation.” The store&#x27;s offerings were revamped after Estrella&#x27;s nephew noticed that Santurce needed a place where area residents could purchase articles for the home at affordable prices. Topeka&#x27;s shift in inventory caused sales to double within a year, said Estrella. When the operation was generating enough sales to allow investing in advertising, Estrella placed ads in the newspaper and on the radio, which helped push sales even further. Two years later, the first Topeka store in Puerto Rico reported sales of $2 million. After the success of the Loiza Street store, the Estrellas expanded their operation, opening new stores in Hato Rey, Río Piedras, Caguas, Carolina, and Arecibo. As for the Topeka name, its origins became somewhat cloudy with time. Estrella once said it was the name of a nightclub he frequented in his native Cuba. Another possible origin is rooted in frugality. The first Topeka store opened in a location where a store called Kimbo used to be. To take advantage of the existing &quot;K&quot; on the store sign, the name Topeka was chosen. The better known Topeka, Kan., had a role in the company&#x27;s development, as Estrella named another of his business ventures after the neighboring town of Yakima. Topeka would go on to compete with local store chains on the island over the years such as La Reina, Pitusa, and Tiendas Capri.

On June 30, 1988, a new Topeka store would open at the Carolina Shopping Court in Carolina as an anchor to the mall.

In 1998, Hurricane Georges would destroy the Arecibo store, and Estrella owner of Topeka Inc. decided it wouldn&#x27;t be cost effective to refurbish and reopen it.

On March 27, 2003, it was reported that time seemed to have stood still at Topeka Inc. The same principles upheld by the Estrella brothers when they founded the discount retail chain almost 40 years ago at the time remained the driving force behind what was a $34 million operation (based on 2001 revenue), putting it at No. 144 on the 2003 Caribbean Business list of the Top 300 locally owned companies.

On January 30, 2015, Topeka would be kicking off the new year with a long-term strategic succession and expansion plan that called for a $4 million investment, the addition of three new stores, and the creation of 53 new permanent jobs, Rolando López, president of Almacenes Yakima Inc., parent company of Topeka announced. Once completed in 2016, all stores would feature a new retail image. Construction of the first new store and remodeling works of existing locations were scheduled to begin March 2015, at which time the chain will also unveil the chain’s new image. Topeka was among the island’s top 10 discount retail chains with estimated annual retail sales totaling more than $20 million. As part of the succession plan, the López family would acquire the totality of the parent company including the warehouse operation, which would also be prepared to accommodate the chain’s projected growth. Overall, construction plans called for the development of three new stores, bringing Topeka’s total number of locations up to seven once the expansion was completed in 2016. Existing stores in Río Piedras, San Juan, Bayamón and Caguas would continue to serve the thriving downtown centers they operated in, however, they would be remodeled to match the chain’s new image. Expansion efforts would translate into 53 new permanent jobs within the chain’s retail operation, bringing total head count at the time up to more than 175. Another 36 indirect jobs were expected to be created during construction. Citing strategic reasons, the Topeka store on Loiza Street, in Santurce would be closed. However, the store’s approximate 11 employees would be considered for employment within the remaining Topeka stores as well as the new locations once operational. To successfully break into the competitive shopping center arena, Topeka’s new store prototype featured the latest retail industry store-within-store design concept, providing greater retail floor space for new product categories, brand names and designer labels. To that end, Topeka would strengthen relationships with longstanding suppliers. The expansion would be supported by an integrated marketing strategy, including more comprehensive shoppers, targeted promotions and public relations initiatives.

<text>Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker (4 November 1784 – 17 December 1868) was a German classical philologist and archaeologist.

==Biography==
Welcker was born at Grünberg, Hesse-Darmstadt. Having studied classical philology at the University of Giessen, in 1803 he was appointed master in the high school, an office which he combined with that of lecturer at the university. In 1806 he journeyed to Italy, and was for more than a year private tutor at Rome in the family of Wilhelm von Humboldt, who became his friend and correspondent.

Welcker returned to Giessen in 1808, and resuming his school-teaching and university lectures was in the following year appointed the first professor of Greek literature and archaeology at that or any German university. After serving as a volunteer in the campaign of 1814 he went to Copenhagen to edit the posthumous papers of the Danish archaeologist Georg Zoega (1755–1809), and published his biography, &quot;Zoegas Leben&quot; (Stuttgart, 1819).

His liberalism in politics having brought him into conflict with the university authorities of Giessen, he exchanged that university for Göttingen in 1816, and three years later received a chair at the new University of Bonn, where he established the art museum and the library, of which he became the first librarian.

In 1841–1843 he travelled in Greece and Italy (cf. his &quot;Tagebuch&quot;, Berlin, 1865), retired from the librarianship in 1854, and in 1861 from his professorship, but continued to reside at Bonn until his death.

==Work==
Welcker was a pioneer in the field of archaeology, and was one of the first to insist, like Böckh and his pupil Karl Otfried Müller, on the necessity of co-ordinating the study of Greek art and religion with philology, in opposition to the methods of the older Hellenists, like Gottfried Hermann, which they perceived as too narrow. The later workers took as their aim the complete reconstruction of the ancient life, in contrast with members of the school of Hermann, who were disposed to limit the field to the language and text of the Greek and Roman writers. Welcker was thoroughly imbued with the harmony of the whole Greek conception, whether expressed in art, literature, or religion, and it was to the presentation of this as a complete whole that he devoted his efforts.

Besides early work on Aristophanes, Pindar, and Sappho, whose character he vindicated, he edited Alcman (1815), Hipponax (1817), Theognis (1826) and the &quot;Theogony&quot; of Hesiod (1865), and published a &quot;Sylloge epigrammatum Graecorum&quot; (Bonn, 1828). His &quot;Griechische Götterlehre&quot; (3 vols., Göttingen, 1857–1862) may be regarded as the first scientific treatise on Greek religion. Among his works on Greek literature the chief are &quot;Die Äschyleische Trilogie&quot; (1824, 6), &quot;Der epische Zyklus oder die Homerischen Geschichte&quot; (2 vols. 1835, 49), &quot;Die griechischen Tragödien mit Rücksicht auf den epischen Zyklus geordnet&quot; (3 vols., 1839–1841). His editions and biography of Zoega, his &quot;Zeitschrift für Geschichte und Auslegung der alten Kunst&quot; (Göttingen, 1817, 8) and his &quot;Alte Denkmäler&quot; (5 vols., 1849–1864) contain his views on ancient art.

<text>Kenneth Grahame ( ; 8 March 1859 – 6 July 1932) was a British writer. He is best remembered for the classic of children&#x27;s literature &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; (1908). Scottish by birth, he spent most of his childhood with his grandmother in England, following the death of his mother and his father&#x27;s inability to look after the children. After attending St Edward&#x27;s School in Oxford, his ambition to attend university was thwarted and he joined the Bank of England, where he had a successful career. Before writing &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, he published three other books: &quot;Pagan Papers&quot; (1893), &quot;The Golden Age&quot; (1895), and &quot;Dream Days&quot; (1898).

==Biography==
===Early life===
Grahame was born on 8 March 1859 at 32 Castle Street in Edinburgh. His parents were James Cunningham Grahame (1830–1887), advocate, and Elizabeth Ingles (1837–1864). When Grahame was a little more than a year old, his father was appointed as sheriff-substitute in Argyllshire, and the family moved to Inveraray on Loch Fyne with Grahame, his older sister, Helen, and his older brother, Thomas William (known as Willie). In March 1864, Grahame&#x27;s younger brother, Roland, was born and the following month Grahame&#x27;s mother died of scarlet fever. Grahame contracted the disease and was seriously ill. Although he recovered, he was left vulnerable to chest infections for the rest of his life.

After their mother&#x27;s death, the four children were sent to live with their maternal grandmother at The Mount, a large house in extensive grounds in Cookham Dean in Berkshire, while their grieving father remained in Scotland and took to drink. Also living at The Mount was Grahame&#x27;s uncle David Ingles, who was the curate at the local church and took the children boating on the River Thames at nearby Bisham. The children were supported financially by Grahame&#x27;s paternal uncle, John Grahame, who was a parliamentary agent in London. In the spring of 1866, after the collapse of a chimney at The Mount, the children moved with their grandmother to Fernhill Cottage in Cranbourne. Later that year, Grahame&#x27;s father recalled the children to Scotland but the arrangement did not work out and the children returned to Cranbourne in 1867, while their father resigned his post in Scotland, went to live in France and had no further contact with his children.

In 1868, when he was nine years old, Grahame became a boarder at the recently-established St Edward&#x27;s School in Oxford. He was successful at school both academically and in sport, winning prizes for divinity and Latin in 1874 and the sixth form prize in 1875, captaining the rugby fifteen, and becoming head boy. Holidays were spent at Cranbourne or with his naval commander uncle, Jack Ingles, and his children in Portsmouth and London. It was during a Christmas holiday in London in 1875 that Grahame&#x27;s brother, Willie, died of a chest infection.

===Career===
While he was at school, Grahame dreamt of attending Oxford University, but his uncle, John Grahame, was opposed to the idea and refused to finance it. Instead, Grahame began work as a clerk in his uncle&#x27;s firm of parliamentary agents Grahame, Currie and Spens. While working in the Westminster office, he lodged with another uncle, Robert Grahame, in Fulham, joined the London Scottish Volunteers and, having met Frederick James Furnivall in a Soho restaurant, became a member of the New Shakspere Society.

On 1 January 1879, aged nineteen, Grahame entered the Bank of England in Threadneedle Street in the City of London as a &quot;gentleman clerk&quot;. He would stay at the Bank for nearly thirty years, working his way up to become its youngest Secretary (one of the Bank&#x27;s three highest officers) at the age of thirty-nine. In the entrance examination to become a clerk, Grahame had scored the highest marks of his intake, and became the only candidate to score 100 percent in the English Essay paper. To be nearer his work, Grahame took lodgings in Bloomsbury Street, which he later shared with his brother Roland, who also worked at the Bank. In 1882 he moved into a flat in Chelsea, where he lived on his own and caught the ferry to work. In 1884, he became a volunteer at Toynbee Hall, working with impoverished youths from the East End of London. Summer holidays with his sister, Helen, were spent in Cornwall and Italy, both places which would remain favourite destinations throughout his life.

Grahame&#x27;s work at the Bank left him time to pursue his literary interests. He had been jotting down his thoughts in prose and poetry in a bank ledger, but it was not until 1887 that he started to submit stories and essays to periodicals. His first published piece appeared in &quot;St James&#x27;s Gazette&quot; in December 1888. He was then invited to become a regular contributor to the &quot;National Observer&quot; by its editor, the poet William Ernest Henley, who tried to persuade him to give up his position with the Bank and become a full-time writer. In 1893 he encouraged Grahame to send a collection of his short stories and essays to John Lane at The Bodley Head publishers. The collection was published with the title &quot;Pagan Papers&quot; and illustrations by Aubrey Beardsley and was well received by critics. Grahame was now in demand as a writer, and became a regular contributor to The Bodley Head periodical, The Yellow Book. In 1894, Grahame took out a lease on a house in the Kensington Crescent (now demolished) in Kensington, which he shared with another writer, Tom Greg, until the latter&#x27;s marriage, and housekeeper Sarah Bath.

&quot;The Golden Age&quot;, published in 1895, was a collection of stories about four children being brought up by aunts and uncles referred to as the Olympians. Some of the chapters had already been published in &quot;Pagan Papers&quot; while most had appeared in the &quot;National Observer&quot; and other periodicals. The book made Grahame famous and established him as a leading authority on childhood. The poet Algernon Swinburne said the book was &quot;well-nigh too praiseworthy for praise&quot;. A sequel, &quot;Dream Days&quot; followed in 1898, the year that Grahame was appointed Secretary to the Bank of England. &quot;Dream Days&quot; included stories published in periodicals over the past four years; a new story was &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot;.

In 1897, Grahame met Elspeth (Elsie) Thomson, the daughter of Robert William Thomson and sister of Courtauld Thomson. Elsie had written a novel, as well as plays and poems. Having lost both her parents, she was living in Onslow Square with her stepfather John Fletcher Moulton who was a Liberal Party Member of Parliament. Grahame and Elsie married on 22 July 1899, at the Church of St Fimbarrus, Fowey, Cornwall. Grahame had been recovering from pneumonia with his friend Arthur Quiller Couch and family in Fowey. The best man at the wedding was Grahame&#x27;s cousin, the writer Anthony Hope. Grahame&#x27;s sister, Helen, disapproved of the marriage, thinking the couple were temperamentally unsuited to each other, and the brother and sister became estranged. The couple set up home in Durham Villas (now Phillimore Place) in Kensington, where their only child, Alastair (nicknamed Mouse) was born prematurely in 1900 with a congenital cataract that left him blind in one eye. Grahame told his son bedtime stories about a mole, beaver, and water-rat, and the letters he wrote when Alastair was holidaying with his nanny in Littlehampton in 1907 while his parents were in Falmouth, Cornwall, included stories about a toad. These stories about animals have been seen as the source for &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;.

In 1903, Grahame had a narrow escape when a man entered the Bank of England and took three shots at him with a revolver, missing each time. The man, George Frederick Robinson, was overpowered and arrested. After a trial at the Old Bailey in which he was found guilty but insane, he was sent to Broadmoor Hospital. Grahame never completely recovered from the trauma and it may have contributed to his early retirement from the Bank.

===Retirement and later life===

Grahame retired from the Bank in 1908, aged forty-nine, ostensibly on the grounds of ill-health. In his resignation letter, Grahame stated that his health was being affected by his work. A different explanation for Grahame&#x27;s retirement was offered by a former colleague, W. Marston Acres, who wrote in 1950 that Grahame&#x27;s resentment of the bullying manner of a director during a discussion about official business provoked him into accusing the director of being &quot;no gentleman&quot;. Marston Acres believed the director in question to be Walter Cunliffe who would later become Governor of the Bank of England. On leaving the Bank, Grahame was awarded an annual pension of £400, although he could have expected to receive £710. In 1906, he had taken out a lease on a house called Mayfield (later Herries Preparatory School) in Cookham Dean, close to where he grew up.

&quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; was published in 1908, four months after the author&#x27;s resignation from the Bank. Rejected at first by &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in the United States and by Grahame&#x27;s usual publishers, Bodley Head, the book was eventually published in the United Kingdom by Methuen, with an American edition released by Scribner. Reviews were generally unfavourable; a reviewer in &quot;The Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Grown-up readers will find it monstruous and elusive, children will hope, in vain, for more fun&quot;. A rare positive review appeared in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; where Richard Middleton wrote that it was &quot;the best book ever written for children and one of the best written for adults&quot;. The book sold well and continued to sell well, reaching 100 editions in the United Kingdom in 1951. In 1910, the Grahames moved from Cookham Dean to a farmhouse, Boham&#x27;s, in the village of Blewbury near Oxford.

Grahame&#x27;s son Alastair flourished at The Old Malthouse School but went on to have brief, and less happy, experiences at Rugby School and Eton College before having lessons with a private tutor to prepare for the University of Oxford. During World War I, Grahame did war work in the village, setting up a factory for surgical supplies, while Alastair was rejected for active service, probably on account of his poor eyesight, and went up to Christ Church, Oxford in 1918. On 7 May 1920, Alastair&#x27;s body was found on the railway line near a level crossing in Oxford. Although the jury at the inquest returned a verdict of accidental death, rumours of suicide persisted. He was buried in Holywell Cemetery in Oxford on 12 May 1920, his twentieth birthday.

Following the death of their son, Grahame and Elsie went to Italy and spent several years travelling. When they returned to England, they settled at Church Cottage in the village of Pangbourne, where Grahame died of a cerebral haemorrhage on 6 July 1932. He was buried at the Church of St James the Less in Pangbourne, with his body later being removed to Holywell cemetery to be buried with Alastair. Grahame&#x27;s cousin, Anthony Hope, wrote his epitaph: &quot;To the beautiful memory of Kenneth Grahame, husband of Elspeth and father of Alastair, who passed the river on the 6th of July, 1932, leaving childhood and literature through him the more blest for all time.&quot; Elsie survived him by fourteen years. Grahame bequeathed the royalties from his works to the Bodleian Library, which also holds his archive.

<doc id="162094" wikidata="Q795279" url="?curid=162094" title="B2K">
<text>B2K (Boys of the New Millennium) was an American boy band that was active from 1998 to 2004, and again from 2018 to 2019. In 1998, the group was formed by American dance choreographer Dave Scott and Interscope A&amp;R Keshia Gamble. The members consisted of Lil&#x27; Fizz, J-Boog, Raz-B, and Omarion. The group released their self-titled debut album on March 12, 2002. The album peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number one on the U.S. Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

== History ==
The group was originally formed in 1998, when Jarell &quot;J-Boog&quot; Houston, De&#x27;Mario &quot;Raz-B&quot; Thornton and Dreux Pierre &quot;Lil&#x27; Fizz&quot; Frédéric were a part of another group called Melodic. On New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1999, Omari &quot;Omarion&quot; Grandberry was invited to join the band. Together, they would adopt the name B2K, an acronym for &quot;Boys of the New Millennium,&quot; and a reference to the Y2K era.

In 2001, B2K released their debut single, &quot;Uh Huh,&quot; produced by Tricky Stewart. Their self-titled debut album, which also included the singles &quot;Gots ta Be&quot; and &quot;Why I Love You&quot;, was released in March 2002 and peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart, later being certified Gold. Their second album, a Christmas album entitled &quot;Santa Hooked Me Up&quot;, was less successful upon its release in October, peaking at No. 132 on the Billboard 200, but their third and final album &quot;Pandemonium!&quot;, released two months later, debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard 200. The lead single from &quot;Pandemonium!&quot;, a collaboration with P. Diddy entitled &quot;Bump, Bump, Bump&quot;, reached No. 1 on the Hot 100, becoming the group&#x27;s sole number one song.

In 2003, the group won a Kids&#x27; Choice Award for Favorite Singing Group. That same year, all of the members filmed the movie &quot;You Got Served&quot;. In 2004, around the time the movie was released, B2K&#x27;s manager Chris Stokes announced the group&#x27;s split, with their label Epic Records claiming internal disagreements as the cause. Lil&#x27; Fizz, Raz-B, and J-Boog issued a joint statement confirming the end of their professional relationship with Stokes. The trio also said they &quot;just want[ed] to be treated fairly&quot;. Omarion would remain under Stokes&#x27; management and pursue a solo career.

=== 2005–2018: Solo ventures, &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop&quot; ===
Omarion went on to release several solo albums, as well as a collaboration album with Bow Wow. From 2005 to 2007, Lil&#x27; Fizz guest-starred on Fox&#x27;s comedy series &quot;The War at Home&quot; which aired for two seasons. After much controversy, Raz-B relocated overseas to China in pursuit of a solo career, as well as becoming an entrepreneur and manager of his own record label. In 2009, J-Boog collaborated with Lil&#x27; Fizz on the 5-Track EP album &quot;Nightlife&quot;. He also partnered with IMx member and relative Marques Houston, becoming a writer, producer and vice president for Houston&#x27;s film production company, Footage Films.

In 2014, Omarion and Fizz became main cast members of VH1&#x27;s reality show &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop: Hollywood&quot;, where both members showcased their private lives and relationships. Omarion left after two seasons to focus on his personal life with his then girlfriend and newborn child, while Fizz remained as supporting cast for the remainder of the seasons. During the series in 2017, J-Boog made an appearance as Fizz attempted to get the band back together with Omarion not being present and possibly having co-star and long time friend Ray J be a part of the group as a replacement. Ultimately, Ray J&#x27;s ego caused tension between him and J-Boog, which resulted in Fizz and Boog deciding it was best to just let the group rest in their history and reunite the right way.

=== 2018–2020: &quot;The Millennium Tour&quot; Reunion ===
On December 31, 2018, it was announced by group managers Michelle Le Fleur and Damuer H. Leffridge that after 15 years, B2K would reunite for The Millennium Tour in 2019. The 3-month city tour occurred during March, April and May 2019. The location and dates were released through the G-Squared Events website. The tour featured all four members of B2K, as well as several other mid-2000s urban artists, including Pretty Ricky, Chingy, Ying Yang Twins, Mario, Bobby V and Lloyd. During the NYC show at Madison Square Garden, Ashanti made a brief surprise appearance performing with Lloyd on their hit single &quot;Southside&quot;.

==== Raz-B&#x27;s various incidents during the tour ====
During the 3-month Millennium Tour, Raz-B was involved in multiple incidents, which were set to be documented as he officially joined the cast of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop: Hollywood&quot;, and agreed to chronicle his life experiences while on tour. This never came to fruition as the reality show was postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

* During the first few weeks of the tour, Raz-B reported to Instagram, explaining on video that he may recuse himself from the tour due to feeling uncomfortable and unsafe after allegations former manager Chris Stokes was possibly in the presence of the group while on tour. Hours later, the group made a statement that Raz-B would remain on tour, disclosing they were in support of their bandmate&#x27;s mental well-being.
* During the Nashville, Tennessee tour stop, Raz-B walked off stage mid performance. He took to Instagram and posted &quot;It really sucks, this being my dream tour. It’s not right! I’m the spirit of the group! I’m clearly alone in this, Omarion thanks for showing me love when nobody else would. I suggest nobody talk to me! Cause none of y&#x27;all understand what I&#x27;m going through!&quot; He then mentioned his dislike for their performance set opening sequence introduction: &quot;Change the f---ing intro, I hate it!&quot;
* In late April, Raz-B was arrested in Minneapolis after reports of domestic violence with his actress girlfriend. It was alleged that he physically strangled and choked her outside of a Macy&#x27;s store. However, the County Attorney&#x27;s Office decided not to prosecute him due to the lack of evidence provided. The producers and camera crew of Love &amp; Hip Hop were not present during this event.
* In early May, during a 27-minute Lyft ride in Jacksonville, Florida, Raz-B slept through the ride and was half awake exiting the vehicle, leaving his $2,500 Louis Vuitton bag. He contacted the driver and said that he hung up on him, which resulted in Raz-B making claims that the driver would not give it back. However, the driver did in fact return the bag by dropping it off at a secure location.
*On May 10, 2019, B2K announced that Raz-B was taking a break from the tour to cater more to his health and well-being, and would not appear for the remainder of the tour. The group was also said to be in support of him receiving self care and hoped to see his return later.

=== 2021–present: Brief feud and occasional appearances ===

In 2021, Omarion did an interview with the &quot;New York Post&quot;, addressing issues with his bandmates. He stated that he had &quot;matured&quot; and that within the group, there was &quot;a lack of communication&quot; and &quot;lack of knowledge&quot;.

On June 23, 2022, Omarion performed a &quot;Verzuz&quot; where he insinuated his former bandmates were &quot;glorified backup dancers&quot;, prompting J-Boog to negatively respond. Shortly after, Omarion announced the arrival of his five-part docuseries titled &quot;Omega: The Gift &amp; The Curse&quot;, where he finally addressed issues during the 2019 Millennium Tour, the group&#x27;s downfall, Lil&#x27; Fizz&#x27;s relationship with the mother of his children, and more.

On September 3, 2022, J-Boog, Raz B and Lil&#x27; Fizz appeared on the Revolt series &quot;Drink Champs&quot; as a trio to discuss their side of the turmoil.

On July 31, 2024, B2K reunited on stage at a concert held by Jhené Aiko in Los Angeles, California, seemingly ending their feud.

<doc id="162096" wikidata="Q467225" url="?curid=162096" title="The Postman">
<text>The Postman is a post-apocalyptic dystopian science fiction novel by David Brin. It is about a man wandering the desolate Oregon countryside who finds a United States Postal Service uniform, which he puts on and then claims he is a mail carrier and federal inspector for the &quot;Restored United States of America&quot;. His mail service and claims about the return of a central government gives hope to the people, who are threatened by a murderous, neo-feudalist militia.

The first two parts were published separately as &quot;The Postman&quot; (1982) and &quot;Cyclops&quot; (1984). In 1997, a film adaptation of the novel was released starring Kevin Costner and Will Patton.

==Plot==
Despite the post-apocalyptic scenario and several action sequences, the book is largely about civilization and its symbols. Each of the three sections deals with a different symbol.

The first is the Postman himself, Gordon Krantz, who takes the uniform solely for warmth after he loses almost everything to bandits. He wanders amongst small communities performing scenes from William Shakespeare plays in return for food and shelter. Originally a drama student at the University of Minnesota, he traveled west to Oregon in the aftermath of the worldwide chaos that resulted from several EMPs, the destruction of major cities, and the release of bioweapons. Taking shelter in a long-abandoned postal van, he finds a sack of mail and a postal uniform. He wears the uniform and takes the mail to a nearby community to barter for food and shelter. His initial claims to be a real postman start not because of a deliberate fraud (at least initially) but because people are desperate to believe in him and his claim that he represents the &quot;Restored United States&quot;.

Later, in the second section, he encounters a community, Corvallis, Oregon, which is led by Cyclops, who is apparently a sentient artificial intelligence created at Oregon State University which survived the cataclysm. In reality, however, the machine ceased functioning due to damage from a Luddite mob, and a group of scientists maintain the pretense of its working to try to keep hope, order, and knowledge alive. The scientists also claim to use Cyclops&#x27; advice and predictions to solicit contributions of food from citizens, an approach that Gordon compares to the Delphi Oracle.

Eventually, in the third section, as the Postman joins forces with Cyclops&#x27;s scientists in a war against an influx of &quot;hypersurvivalist militia&quot;, the Postman begins to find that the hypersurvivalists are being pressed from Oregon&#x27;s Rogue River area to the south as well. The hypersurvivalists are more commonly referred to as Holnists, after their founder, Nathan Holn, an author who championed a violent, misogynistic, and militaristic society. Holn was lynched sometime before the events in the novel, but in the time following what should have been a brief period of civil disorder, Holn&#x27;s followers&#x27; attacks prevented the United States from recovering from the war and the plagues that followed.

As the story comes to a climax, the Postman allies with a tough tribal group made up of descendants of ranchers, loggers and Native Americans from Southwestern Oregon&#x27;s Umpqua Valley region who are led by a Native American who is a former member of an airborne regiment of the U.S. military. The Umpqua people have developed a warrior culture similar to Native Americans of the Old West and are bitter enemies of the Holnists; they have defeated the Holnists at every turn, but until the Postman&#x27;s arrival they were not inclined to help the &quot;weak&quot; townsfolk of the Willamette Valley against the Holnists. At the end of the novel, the Postman discovers the Holnists have another organized enemy to the South, identified only by the symbol they rally behind: the Bear Flag. The final scenes of the novel give the impression that the groups (symbols) may come together in an effort to revive civilization.

Another message of the plot deals with the backstory of the post-apocalyptic world: specifically, that it was not the electronics-destroying EMPs, the destruction of major cities, or the release of various bio-engineered plagues that completely destroyed society, but rather it was the Holnists, who preyed on humanitarian workers and attacked communities during this difficult period.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;The Postman&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #83, and stated that &quot;The story is complicated by Krantz&#x27;s intersection with another myth in the making, and then by a muddle of battle, murder and enhanced super-guerillas, all a bit of a needless distraction, but never mind. It&#x27;s nicely written, sometimes moving, and ends as it should. Well worth reading.&quot;

Both of the initial parts were nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Novella. The completed novel won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, both for 1986. It was also nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel for 1986.

Brin has suggested that he wrote &quot;The Postman&quot; as a rebuke to the celebrations of mayhem in the many derivative post-apocalyptic fictions that appeared in the wake of the popular &quot;Mad Max&quot; movies.

==Film adaptation==
The novel was adapted as a 1997 American adventure film produced and directed by Kevin Costner, who plays the lead role. It was written by Eric Roth and Brian Helgeland, and also features Will Patton, Larenz Tate, Olivia Williams, James Russo, and Tom Petty.

<doc id="162098" wikidata="Q462997" url="?curid=162098" title="Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester">
<text>Robert FitzRoy, 1st Earl of Gloucester (c. 1090 – 31 October 1147) (&quot;alias&quot; Robert Rufus, Robert de Caen (Latinised to Robertus de Cadomo), Robert Consul) was an illegitimate son of King Henry I of England. He was the half-brother of the Empress Matilda, and her chief military supporter during the civil war known as the Anarchy, in which she vied with Stephen of Blois for the throne of England.

== Early life ==
Robert was probably the eldest of Henry&#x27;s many illegitimate children. He was born before his father&#x27;s accession to the English throne, either during the reign of his grandfather William the Conqueror or his uncle William Rufus. He is sometimes and erroneously designated as a son of Nest, daughter of Rhys ap Tewdwr, last king of Deheubarth, although his mother has been identified as a member of &quot;the Gay or Gayt family of north Oxfordshire&quot;, possibly a daughter of Rainald or Reginald Gay (fl. 1086) of Hampton Gay and Northbrook Gay in Oxfordshire. Rainald had known issue, Robert Gay of Hampton (died c. 1138) and Stephen Gay of Northbrook (died after 1154). A number of Oxfordshire women feature as the mothers of Robert&#x27;s siblings.

Robert may have been a native of Caen or he may have been only the constable and governor of that city, jure uxoris. 

Robert&#x27;s father had contracted him in marriage to Mabel FitzRobert, daughter and heir of Robert Fitzhamon, but the marriage was not solemnised until June 1119 at Lisieux. His wife brought him the substantial honours of Gloucester in England and Glamorgan in Wales, and the honours of Sainte-Scholasse-sur-Sarthe and Évrecy in Normandy, as well as Creully and Thorigny. After the &quot;White Ship&quot; disaster late in 1120, and probably because of this marriage, in 1121 or 1122 his father created him Earl of Gloucester. He commissioned the translation of Welsh historical sources which the subject lent to Walter Espec of Helmsley, and he, in turn, lent to others.

== Earl of Gloucester ==
In either 1121 or 1122, his father created him the 1st Earl of Gloucester. Robert became powerful in both the countries of Normandy and England with this act, as Caen may have remained his principal seat.

Robert possessed many castles and land through grants made to him by his father, King Henry. He was the keeper of Gloucester Castle, Canterbury Castle and fortresses of Bristol, Leeds and Dover. Bristol Castle was Robert&#x27;s principal seat in England and he constructed additions to its exterior fortifications and rebuilt the interior. Robert held Gloucester Castle in right of his earldom, however, after Miles of Gloucester, 1st Earl of Hereford was created earl, Miles became the constable of it under Robert, his liege-lord, as Florence of Worcester called him.

There is evidence in the contemporary source, the &quot;Gesta Stephani&quot;, that Robert was proposed by some as a candidate for the throne, after his father&#x27;s death, but his illegitimacy ruled him out:

This suggestion cannot have led to any idea that he and Stephen were rivals for the Crown, as Geoffrey of Monmouth in 1136 referred to Robert as one of the &#x27;pillars&#x27; of the new King&#x27;s rule. 

For the first five years after the death of his father, Henry I, and usurpation of power by Stephen in 1135, Robert seems to have been an inactive spectator of the struggle between Stephen and Matilda.

In June 1138, Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou persuaded Robert to join the party opposing King Stephen through prayers and promises given to Robert when Geoffrey entered Normandy. It is said that when the hostilities first began, Robert acted with &quot;great prudence, and still held aloof,&quot; but that his hostility to Stephen was not disguised. Thus, while Robert sided in June 1138 with the party opposing Stephen&#x27;s rule was a great change in the power dynamics in England, it may not have been quite as unexpected as some scholars make it out to be, as &quot;his hostility to Stephen was scarcely disguised.&quot; 

In 1139, Robert, along with Guy de Sablé and several others, took Matilda to England. On August 31, 1139, they landed in England and were received at Arundel castle by their step-mother Adeliza, the queen-dowager. Matilda was given leave from King Stephen to pass through England under safe conduct. Robert hosted Matilda after her arrival in England at Bristol Castle and led her forces against Stephen.

Robert commanded the empress&#x27;s forces during the Battle of Lincoln, during which Robert&#x27;s son-in-law Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester commanded his own forces for the empress.

The capture of King Stephen at the Battle of Lincoln on 2 February 1141 gave Empress Matilda the upper hand in her battle for the throne, but by alienating the citizens of London she failed to be crowned queen. Robert imprisoned Stephen in Bristol. Her forces were defeated at the Rout of Winchester on 14 September 1141, and Robert of Gloucester was captured nearby at Stockbridge.

Without the Earl of Gloucester, the party of Matilda was powerless, so the two prisoners, King Stephen and Robert of Gloucester, were then exchanged. But by freeing Stephen, Empress Matilda had given up her best chance of becoming queen. She would later return to France, where she died in 1167, though her son succeeded Stephen as King Henry II in 1154.

With the success of Stephen in England, Robert and Matilda returned to Normandy, where the earl recruited fresh levies. He soon crossed the channel again, taking with him his nephew, Henry, then ten years old. Robert was devoted to the education of his young charge and taught him English habits and culture. Following their crossing of the channel, Robert went to Wareham, Dorsetshire and sent Henry to Somerset, where he was received by friends of his mother, Matilda. 

The civil war continued on without much success, with alternate triumphs and defeats for three more years. However, it came to a quiet close in 1147 when Robert died and the queen and her son, now deprived of Gloucester&#x27;s protection, returned to Normandy.

Robert of Gloucester died in 1147 at Bristol Castle, where he had previously imprisoned King Stephen, and was buried at St James&#x27; Priory, Bristol, which he had founded in 1129.

== Family ==

Robert and his wife Mabel Fitzhamon married in 1119, and they had seven children:
*William FitzRobert (c. 1121–1183): succeeded his father as 2nd Earl of Gloucester
*Roger FitzRobert (c. 1123–1179): Bishop of Worcester
*Hamon FitzRobert, knight (c. 1124–1159): killed at the siege of Toulouse.
*Richard FitzRobert, Lord of Creully (c. 1125–1175): succeeded his mother as Sire de Creully.
*Matilda FitzRobert (c. 1126–1189): married in 1143 Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester.
*Mabel FitzRobert: married Aubrey de Vere
*Philip FitzRobert, Lord of Cricklade (c. 1130–1148)
He also had four illegitimate children:
*Richard FitzRobert (died 1142): Bishop of Bayeux [mother: Isabel de Douvres, sister of Richard de Douvres, bishop of Bayeux (1107–1133)]
*Robert FitzRobert (died 1170): Castellan of Gloucester, married in 1147 Hawise de Reviers (daughter of Baldwin de Reviers, 1st Earl of Devon and his first wife Adelisa), had daughter Mabel FitzRobert (married, firstly, Jordan de Chambernon and, secondly, William de Soliers)
*Mabel FitzRobert: married Gruffud, Lord of Senghenydd, son of Ifor Bach

==In popular culture==
Robert of Gloucester is a figure in many of the novels by Ellis Peters in &quot;The Cadfael Chronicles&quot; (written between 1977 and 1994) where he is seen as a strong moderating force to his half-sister (see &quot;Saint Peter&#x27;s Fair&quot;). His efforts to gain the crown for his sister by capturing King Stephen and her own actions in London are part of the plot in &quot;The Pilgrim of Hate&quot;. His capture by Stephen&#x27;s wife Queen Mathilda is in the background of the plot of &quot;An Excellent Mystery&quot;. The exchange of the imprisoned Robert for the imprisoned Stephen is in the background of the plot of &quot;The Raven in the Foregate&quot;. Robert&#x27;s travels to persuade his brother-in-law to aid Empress Maud militarily in England is in the background of the novel &quot;The Rose Rent.&quot; His return to England when Empress Maud is trapped in Oxford Castle figures in &quot;The Hermit of Eyton Forest&quot;.

Robert&#x27;s return to England with his young nephew Henry, years later the king succeeding Stephen, is in the background of the plot of &quot;The Confession of Brother Haluin&quot;, as the battles begin anew with Robert&#x27;s military guidance. Robert&#x27;s success in the Battle of Wilton leads to the death of a fictional character, part of the plot of &quot;The Potter&#x27;s Field&quot;. In the last novel, he is a father who can disagree with and then forgive his son Philip (see the last novel, &quot;Brother Cadfael&#x27;s Penance&quot;). In that last novel, Brother Cadfael speculates on the possibly different path for England if the first son of old King Henry, the illegitimate Robert of Gloucester, had been recognised and accepted. In Wales of that era, a son was not illegitimate if recognised by his father, and to many in the novels, Robert of Gloucester seemed the best of the contenders to succeed his father.

Robert is also a central character in Sharon Penman&#x27;s 1995 novel &quot;When Christ and His Saints Slept&quot;. He was also central in the struggle during the Anarchy as portrayed in Ken Follett&#x27;s 1989 novel &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot;, in the 2010 mini-series, and in the 2017 video game of the same name too.

<text>Robert Fitzhamon (died March 1107), or Robert FitzHamon (literally, &quot;Robert, son of Hamon&quot;), Seigneur de Creully in the Calvados region and Torigny in the Manche region of Normandy, was the first Norman feudal baron of Gloucester and the Norman conqueror of Glamorgan, southern Wales. He became Lord of Glamorgan in 1075.

As a kinsman of the Conqueror and one of the few Anglo-Norman barons to remain loyal to the kings William Rufus and Henry I of England, he was a prominent figure in England and Normandy.

==Life==

===Parentage and ancestry===
Robert FitzHamon, probably born in the 1040s or 1050s, was the son of Hamo Dapifer the Sheriff of Kent and grandson of Hamon Dentatus (&quot;The Betoothed or Toothy&quot;, i.e., probably buck-toothed). His grandfather held the lordships of Torigny, Creully, Mézy, and Evrecy in Normandy, but following his death at the Battle of Val-ès-Dunes in 1047, the family might have lost these lordships. He is said to have been a relative of William the Conqueror, but the nature of the relationship is unknown.

==Career in England and Wales==
Few details of Robert&#x27;s career prior to 1087 are available. Robert probably did not fight at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, and does not appear in the Domesday Book of 1086, although some of his relatives are listed therein. He first comes to prominence in surviving records as a supporter of King William Rufus (1087–1100) during the Rebellion of 1088. After the revolt was defeated he was granted as a reward by King William Rufus the feudal barony of Gloucester consisting of over two hundred manors in Gloucestershire and other counties. Some of these had belonged to the late Queen Matilda, consort of William the Conqueror and mother of William Rufus, and had been seized by her from the great Saxon thane Brictric son of Algar, apparently as a punishment for his having refused her romantic advances in his youth. They had been 
destined as the inheritance of Rufus&#x27;s younger brother Henry (the future King Henry I); nevertheless Fitzhamon remained on good terms with Henry.

==Conquest of Glamorgan==

The chronology of Robert&#x27;s conquest of Glamorgan is uncertain, but it probably took place in the decades after he received the feudal barony of Gloucester. One explanation is the legend of the Twelve Knights of Glamorgan, which dates from the 16th century, in which the Welsh Prince Iestyn ap Gwrgan (Jestin), prince or Lord of Glamorgan, supposedly called in the assistance of Robert Fitzhamon. Fitzhamon and his Norman knights and defeated the prince of South Wales Rhys ap Tewdwr in battle in 1090. As reward Robert took possession of Glamorgan, and &quot;the French came into Dyfed and Ceredigion, which they have still retained, and fortified the castles, and seized upon all the land of the Britons.&quot; Iestyn did not profit long by his involvement with the Normans. He was soon defeated and his lands taken in 1091. Whether there is any truth in the legend or not Robert Fitzhamon seems to have seized control of the lowlands of Glamorgan and Gwynllwg sometime from around 1089 to 1094. His key strongholds were Cardiff Castle, which already may have been built, on the site of an old Roman fort, new castles at Newport, and at Kenfig. His descendants would inherit these castles and lands.

==Founder of Tewkesbury Abbey (1092)==
Robert FitzHamon refounded Tewkesbury Abbey in 1092. The abbey&#x27;s dimensions are almost the same as Westminster Abbey. The first abbot was Giraldus, Abbot of Cranborne (d. 1110), who died before the abbey was consecrated in October 1121. The abbey was apparently built under the influence of Robert&#x27;s wife, Sybil de Montgomery (or de Montgomerie).

==Fitzhamon and his kings==

Legend has it that Robert had ominous dreams in the days before Rufus&#x27; fatal hunting expedition, which postponed but did not prevent the outing. He was one of the first to gather in tears around Rufus&#x27; corpse, and he used his cloak to cover the late king&#x27;s body on its journey to be buried in Winchester. How much of these stories are the invention of later days is unknown. In any case Fitzhamon proved as loyal to Henry I as he had been to his predecessor, remaining on Henry&#x27;s side in the several open conflicts with Henry&#x27;s brother Robert Curthose. He was one of the three barons who negotiated the 1101 truce between Henry I and Robert Curthose.

In 1105 he went to Normandy and was captured while fighting near his ancestral estates near Bayeux. This was one of the reasons Henry crossed the channel with a substantial force later that year. Fitzhamon was freed, and joined Henry&#x27;s campaign, which proceeded to besiege Falaise. There Fitzhamon was severely injured in the head; although he lived two more years he was never the same mentally. He was buried in the Chapter House at Tewkesbury Abbey, which he had founded and considerably enriched during his lifetime.

==Marriage and progeny==
Between 1087 and 1090, Robert Fitzhamon married Sybil, apparently the youngest daughter of Roger of Montgomery, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury by his first wife, Mabel Talvas, daughter of William I Talvas. She survived her husband and is said to have entered a convent with two of her daughters. 

By his wife, Robert Fitzhamon is said to have had four daughters including:
*Mabel, eldest daughter, who inherited his great estates and in 1119 married Robert de Caen, 1st Earl of Gloucester, a natural son of King Henry I (1100-1135). Fitzhamon&#x27;s huge land-holdings in several counties formed the feudal barony of Gloucester which was inherited by his son-in-law Robert de Caen, who, in 1122, was created 1st Earl of Gloucester. Robert Fitzhamon&#x27;s great-granddaughter, Isabel of Gloucester married King John (1199-1216).
*Isabella (or Hawisa), said to have married a count from Brittany, but no further details exist.

==1860 Depiction at Kilkhampton==
A depiction of Robert FitzHamon (d. 1107) and Richard I de Grenville (d. post 1142) is contained within one of the two Granville windows by Clayton and Bell erected in 1860 by descendants of the latter within the Granville Chapel of the Church of St James the Great, Kilkhampton, Cornwall. The Granvilles claimed in the 17th century to have been the heirs male of Robert FitzHamon to a non-existent Earldom of Corboil, a connection without historical foundation. The seat of the Grenville family (&quot;Granville&quot; after 1661 when elevated to the Earldom of Bath) was Stowe within the parish of Kilkhampton. Below the left-hand figure is inscribed: &quot;Rob. FitzHamon Earl of Corboyle&quot;, with attributed arms under showing: &quot;Azure, a lion rampant guardant or&quot; impaling &quot;Azure, a lion rampant or a bordure of the last&quot;. The windows were erected in 1860 by the heirs of the Grenville family.

<doc id="162104" wikidata="Q851481" url="?curid=162104" title="XS4ALL">
<text>XS4ALL was an Internet service provider (ISP) in the Netherlands. It was founded in 1993 as an offshoot of the hackers club Hack-Tic
by Felipe Rodriquez, Rop Gonggrijp, Paul Jongsma and Cor Bosman, while based in Amsterdam. It was the sixth provider in the Netherlands (after NLnet, SURFnet, HCC!hobbynet, Knoware and IAF) and the second company to offer Internet access to private individuals. Initially only offering dial-in services via modem and ISDN, it later expanded to offer dial-up access as well as ADSL, VDSL, and fiber-optic (FTTH) services as well as mobile internet (but no calling or texting). The name is a play on the English pronunciation of &quot;access for all&quot;.

As of 2007, XS4ALL was one of the larger ISPs in The Netherlands. In 2005, the company had a turnover of 86.1 million euro, realising a 15.4 million euro profit before taxes. Also in 2005, XS4ALL employed 327 people (325 FTE) and served 265,000 private subscribers. The company is known for its willingness to take on controversial issues; has taken legal action against spammers, and fought over other legal issues in court, such as Scientology vs. the Internet.

XS4ALL was sold to KPN in December 1998, but remained an independent subsidiary.
In January 2019, KPN announced that it would eventually phase out the XS4ALL brand and continue operations under the KPN brand. KPN stopped offering services with the XS4ALL brand name on 24 December 2021, and will migrate existing customers to KPN infrastructure during 2022.

A petition and a special action commission was started to try to revert this decision, the petition has been signed over 50,000 times, signatories include ex-board members and founders of XS4ALL. In November 2019 the committee launched a new company named Freedom Internet, meant to serve as an ideological successor to XS4ALL, and supported by a crowdfunding action that raised 2.5 million euro. Freedom Internet initially offers e-mail hosting, and rolled out its first DSL connections in 2020.

== Activism and controversies ==

=== Scientology ===
In 1995 members of the Church of Scientology caused a raid on the servers of Dutch Internet provider XS4ALL as part of a bigger conflict with its online critics and sued it and Karin Spaink for copyright violations because of citing out of some confidential materials of Scientology. A summary judgment followed in 1995, full proceedings in 1999, an appeal in 2001 which has been upheld by the Supreme Court of Netherlands in December 2005, all in favor of the provider and Karin Spaink, putting freedom of speech above copyright in some cases. From these days there is also a relationship with NGO Bits of Freedom, an organisation promoting Freedom of Speech: BoF was a strong supporter for Karin in her fight with Scientology. A video appeared from anonymous featuring the office building of XS4ALL.

=== Station B92 ===
In December 1996, XS4ALL put the Belgrade radio station B92 online using streaming audio technology in response to the jamming of its broadcasts by the regime of Slobodan Milošević. XS4ALL installed a leased line to the radio station in response to a request from Adriënne van Heteren, a Dutch citizen who went to Belgrade to set up various cultural activities. After XS4ALL had launched the online broadcast of Radio B92, its signal was picked up by the Voice of America and BBC World Service and transmitted back into Serbia, where it was then also transmitted via several local radio-stations.

=== &quot;Radikal&quot; magazine ===
In September 1996, members of the German InternetContentTaskForce (ICTF) blocked XS4ALL for about a month because one of its subscribers had put an issue of &quot;&quot; magazine on his homepage. &quot;radikal&quot; is illegal in Germany, and to prevent its publication the German &quot;Bundesanwaltschaft&quot; (prosecutor&#x27;s office) ordered commercial ISPs in Germany to block its website. They ended up blocking the entire XS4ALL site, which at the time had about 6,000 personal and commercial homepages. XS4ALL insisted that the case be settled by the courts, because it did not want to infringe on its customers&#x27; rights of free expression; however, the requests to follow traditional legal paths were ignored by the German ICTF.

On 11 April 1997 one of the largest German ISPs, the Deutsches Forschungsnetz (DFN) academic backbone network, started an IP-filtering blockade against XS4ALL. Many protest letters were sent, mirrors were once again set up around the world, and the complete issue of &quot;radikal 154&quot; was posted in the newsgroup &quot;de.soc.zensur&quot;. As a result, the blockade only lasted a few days. The founders of XS4ALL were interrogated as suspects of publication of terrorist propaganda, but no legal actions were initiated against them. XS4ALL then implemented several technologies to sabotage the censorship attempt, such as automatically rotating the IP address of its website. The ICTF ended up censoring all IP traffic to the XS4ALL domain, including e-mail. After a couple of weeks this became untenable; a global protest against the censorship emerged, and a global network of mirror sites was created by the online community. The ICTF abandoned its efforts after several weeks.

===Arab Spring in Egypt and Libya===
In early 2011 the government in Egypt blocked (initially international, later all) internet-access hoping to thwart organizers of protests against the government and also to control the news leaving the country. On an incoming requests XS4All opened up their—still existing—dial-in modems to give people from Egypt direct access to the open internet. Because international telephone connections from Egypt to the rest of the world were not blocked, people could dial into the modems in Amsterdam and from there subsequently log into the internet using username and password &quot;xs4all&quot;.
When later that year a similar situation arose in Libya, the possibilities of such connections were brought to the attention of protesters in that country.

== Corporate culture ==
In December 1998, XS4ALL was sold to the Dutch incumbent phone company KPN. Many of the original employees, especially system managers, still work there.

XS4ALL also sponsors and hosts the sites of many free software projects, like Python, Squirrelmail and Debian. It sponsors the data traffic of ScriptumLibre, and thereby indirectly helps projects like Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure (FFII) and the Free Software Translation Project.

<text>The Black Crowes are an American rock band formed in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1984. Their discography includes nine studio albums, four live albums and several charting singles. The band was signed to Def American Recordings in 1989 by producer George Drakoulias and released their debut album, &quot;Shake Your Money Maker&quot;, the following year. Their follow-up, &quot;The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion&quot;, reached the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in 1992. The albums &quot;Amorica&quot; (1994), &quot;Three Snakes and One Charm&quot; (1996), &quot;By Your Side&quot; (1999), and &quot;Lions&quot; (2001) followed, with each showing moderate popularity but failing to capture the chart successes of the band&#x27;s first two albums. After a hiatus from 2002 to 2005, the band regrouped and toured for several years before releasing &quot;Warpaint&quot; in 2008, which reached number 5 on the Billboard chart.

Following the release of their greatest hits/acoustic double album &quot;Croweology&quot; in August 2010, the band started a 20th anniversary tour that was followed by a second hiatus. After touring in 2013, the band announced another breakup in 2015, reforming in late 2019 to announce a 2020 tour in support of the 30th anniversary of &quot;Shake Your Money Maker&quot;. By this point the band had none of its original line-up left except for Chris and Rich Robinson, the only two constant members of the band over its entire history.

As of August 2023, the current lineup of the band includes the Robinson brothers, longtime bassist Sven Pipien, and new members Nico Bereciartua (lead guitar), Cully Symington (drums) and Erik Deutsch (keyboards). Their latest album, &quot;Happiness Bastards&quot;, was released in March 2024 and nominated in the Best Rock Album Grammy later that year. In 2025, they were nominated for induction into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the first time. 

The Black Crowes have sold more than 30 million albums, and are listed at number 92 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;. They were labeled by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; as &quot;The Most Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Band in the World&quot; and the readers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; voted them &#x27;Best New American Band&#x27; in 1990.

==History==
===Formation: 1984–1989===

The first incarnation of the band, &quot;Mr. Crowe&#x27;s Garden&quot;, named after Leonard Leslie Brooke&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;Johnny Crow&#x27;s Garden&quot;, formed in 1984 in Atlanta, Georgia. Influenced by contemporary local acts like R.E.M., as well as 1960s psychedelic pop and classic Southern rock, they gradually evolved into a revivalist band dedicated to 1970s-era blues rock. Although the band has had a high turnover rate throughout their history, the driving force behind the band has always been brothers Chris and Rich Robinson, who initially formed the band while attending Walton High School.

The first professional demo the Robinson brothers did was for A&amp;M Records in 1987. The band&#x27;s manager at the time, Dave Macias, got in touch with A&amp;M rep Aaron Jacoves, from Los Angeles, who offered the band a &#x27;demo&#x27; deal and arranged the band&#x27;s first of several demo sessions. It was held at Steve Gronback&#x27;s studio in Carrboro, North Carolina. They were paid $2,000 by Jacoves to cover production costs. Jeff Sullivan (of Drivin N Cryin fame) played drums on the first demo, while subsequent demo recordings featured Steve Gorman on the drums. Gorman played on the subsequent A&amp;M demos in Carrboro, North Carolina, during mid and late 1987, although as a guest drummer at first until he officially joined Mr. Crowe&#x27;s Garden later that year. The band was originally offered a record deal in 1987 under the label &quot;Dog Gone&quot; by R.E.M.&#x27;s manager Jefferson Holt but declined.

The band played as a quartet in New York City clubs such as &quot;Drums&quot; and CBGB in 1988. In 1989 the band - which had stabilized as a five-piece including the Robinsons, Gorman, Johnny Colt and Jeff Cease - met George Drakoulias, who signed the band at Def American. Drakoulias turned the band on to music it had not heard before like The Faces and Humble Pie. Under Drakoulias&#x27; influence, the band began covering the Rolling Stones and Rich began playing in open-G tunings for Mr. Crowe&#x27;s Garden songs. At this point, the band also changed their name, and considered ideas such as &quot;The Heartless Crowes&quot; and &quot;The Stone Mountain Crowes&quot;, before settling on &quot;The Black Crowes&quot;.

===Height of fame: 1990–1995===
The Black Crowes released their first studio album, &quot;Shake Your Money Maker&quot;, in 1990. Supported by the singles &quot;Hard to Handle&quot;, &quot;She Talks to Angels&quot;, &quot;Jealous Again&quot;, &quot;Twice As Hard&quot;, &quot;Sister Luck&quot;, and &quot;Seeing Things&quot;, the album received multi-platinum certification and eventually sold more than five million copies. Their cover of Otis Redding&#x27;s &quot;Hard to Handle&quot;, and acoustic ballad &quot;She Talks to Angels&quot;, both achieved top 30 positions on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1991. The band opened for ZZ Top on a tour sponsored by Miller Beer, from which they were fired in March 1991 after Chris Robinson&#x27;s verbal tirade aimed at Miller. The band launched its own tour that May and later took part in a &quot;Monsters of Rock&quot; tour in Europe, where they opened for Metallica, AC/DC, Mötley Crüe and Queensrÿche.

Due to the prevalence of Chuck Leavell&#x27;s piano and organ parts on the first release, in 1991 the band hired a keyboardist of its own, Eddie Harsch. He became a permanent member of the group beginning with the &quot;High as the Moon&quot; tour in 1992.

After replacing guitarist Jeff Cease with Marc Ford from blues-rock power trio Burning Tree, the band released its second album &quot;The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion&quot; in 1992. The album debuted at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The effort spawned the singles &quot;Remedy&quot;, &quot;Sting Me&quot;, &quot;Thorn in My Pride&quot; and &quot;Hotel Illness&quot;, all of which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Remedy&quot; and &quot;Thorn in My Pride&quot; also charted on the Hot 100 in 1992.

In 1994, the now six-piece band released &quot;Amorica&quot;, after scrapping the unreleased album &quot;Tall&quot; the previous year. The album eventually achieved Gold status, selling over 500,000 copies. The cover featured a picture of a woman&#x27;s crotch wearing a U.S. flag thong with visible pubic hair, which was taken from a 1976 issue of &quot;Hustler&quot; magazine. As some stores would not carry the album because of the cover, a different version was released simultaneously with a solid black background, showing only the triangle featuring the flag.

===Middle era: 1996–2001===
&quot;Three Snakes and One Charm&quot; was released in July 1996. The band&#x27;s support tour included a summer stint with the 1997 Furthur Festival, along with Ratdog, Bruce Hornsby and others. During this period, the band recorded an album called &quot;Band&quot;, which was scrapped. Guitarist Marc Ford was fired and bassist Johnny Colt subsequently left the group, dissolving the Crowes&#x27; line-up for the previous three albums. The unreleased tracks from &quot;Tall&quot; and &quot;Band&quot; surfaced among tape trading circles and were later officially released on &quot;The Lost Crowes&quot; (2006).

The band regrouped, adding Sven Pipien on bass prior to its next recording sessions. &quot;By Your Side&quot; was released in January 1999; the album stripped away the more adventurous sounds of &quot;Amorica&quot; and &quot;Three Snakes and One Charm&quot; in favor of leaner, soul-influenced songs. Guitarist Audley Freed, formerly of Cry of Love, joined prior to the recording of &quot;By Your Side&quot; but was not included in the recording sessions.

In October 1999, the band was joined by Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page for two pairs of shows in New York and Los Angeles, and also at the Centrum in Worcester, Massachusetts, yielding a live release, &quot;Live at the Greek&quot; on TVT Records. Due to contractual issues with Columbia, &quot;Live at the Greek&quot; did not feature any of the band&#x27;s songs performed with Page. The collaboration led to a more extensive tour with Page and The Who in summer 2000, during which Pipien was replaced by Greg Rzab. Following the tour, singer Chris Robinson married actress Kate Hudson, before heading back to the studio to record the band&#x27;s sixth studio album.

In May 2001, the band released &quot;Lions&quot; on Virgin mogul Richard Branson&#x27;s V2 record label; the album peaked at number 20 on the charts. The band launched its support of the album with the month-long Tour of Brotherly Love with Oasis and Spacehog in May and June 2001. Throughout the rest of 2001, the band embarked on the &quot;Listen Massive&quot; headlining tour in support of &quot;Lions&quot;, which spanned Europe and Japan before concluding with 36 U.S. shows. The band effectively dissolved in January 2002 with the departure of drummer Steve Gorman and an announcement that the band was &quot;taking a hiatus.&quot;

===First hiatus and reunion: 2002–2005===

A live album pieced together from two 2001 shows performed at Boston&#x27;s Orpheum Theatre was released in August 2002. In 2004, some members of the band did reunite to play &quot;Sometimes Salvation&quot; with Gov&#x27;t Mule at the 2004 Jammy Awards. During the hiatus, Chris Robinson released albums &quot;New Earth Mud&quot; in 2002 and &quot;This Magnificent Distance&quot; in 2004. Meanwhile, Rich Robinson formed a short-lived band called Hookah Brown before releasing his own solo album, &quot;Paper&quot;, in 2004.

In early 2005, the Robinson brothers and Eddie Harsch reassembled the band, bringing Marc Ford and Sven Pipien back into the fold and in the absence of founding member Steve Gorman, recruited drummer Bill Dobrow, from Rich&#x27;s solo band. Dobrow&#x27;s tenure was short-lived, however, as Gorman rejoined the band during a four-night stand at the Tabernacle in Atlanta. The reinvigorated band continued to tour throughout 2005, including a summer tour opening for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and five nights at The Fillmore in San Francisco. The second show at The Fillmore was filmed in high definition and released later in 2006 as &quot;Freak &#x27;n&#x27; Roll into the Fog&quot; on DVD, Blu-ray and audio CD.

===Changing lineup and renewed success: 2006–2009===
In fall 2006, Eddie Harsch and Marc Ford left the band. Replacing Harsch and Ford were Rob Clores and Paul Stacey, respectively. In August 2007, the band replaced Clores with Adam MacDougall. Stacey&#x27;s tenure was never intended to be permanent and when the band invited guitar player Luther Dickinson from North Mississippi Allstars to perform on their upcoming record, entitled &quot;Warpaint&quot; Dickinson officially replaced Stacey as guitarist. Stacey continued to work with the band, however, as producer of &quot;Warpaint&quot;.

A live album entitled &quot;Live at the Roxy&quot;, culled from the 2006 Brothers of a Feather performances (featuring Chris and Rich Robinson performing mostly acoustic sets) was released on July 10, 2007. The album featured performances of old and new Black Crowes material mixed with covers, taken from a three-night run at The Roxy in Los Angeles in early 2006.

The Black Crowes&#x27; first album since reforming, &quot;Warpaint&quot; was released on March 3, 2008. &quot;Warpaint&quot; was critically acclaimed and the album landed at number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the band&#x27;s best debut since &quot;The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion&quot; topped the charts. The band launched an international tour March 24 when they played the East Coast Blues &amp; Roots Music Festival in Australia. The band continued its Australia and New Zealand tour—the first since 1992—through April 5, before departing for a European trek. A US tour began in May and concluded in December with another five-night stand at The Fillmore in San Francisco. Also that year, the Black Crowes filed a lawsuit against country singer Gretchen Wilson, claiming that she infringed upon their copyright for the song &quot;Jealous Again&quot;.

In April 2009, the band released a two-disc live album entitled &quot;Warpaint Live&quot;. The first disc consists of the &quot;Warpaint&quot; album played in its entirety, while the second disc is made up of catalog classics and cover selections. The entire performance contained on the set was recorded on March 20, 2008, at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles. A DVD of the same performance was released on June 30, 2009. The band released its eighth studio album, &quot;Before the Frost...Until the Freeze&quot;, later that year. A CD purchase of the album is accompanied with a download code to receive the album&#x27;s companion release, &quot;...Until the Freeze&quot;. The vinyl version is a double album that includes all of the songs but in a different running order. These albums resulted from five days of recording at Levon Helms Studio in Woodstock, and present a combination of new material and a few new cover songs recorded live in front of an audience. Continuing the trend set with &quot;Warpaint&quot;, the Crowes incorporated more of their country and bluegrass roots in these recordings as well as venturing into new avenues such as disco in the song &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Hidin&#x27;&quot;. A DVD of these sessions, including some interview and backstage segments, was released named &quot;Cabin Fever&quot;.

===&quot;Final&quot; years: 2010–2015===
On April 21, 2010, the Black Crowes announced an August 3 release date for a double, all-acoustic album &quot;Croweology&quot;, as well as tour dates for the &quot;Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys&quot; tour, which featured two 90-minute sets at the majority of shows: one acoustic and one electric. After the tour, the band went on another &quot;indefinite&quot; hiatus. On November 26, 2010, the Black Crowes released a special edition &quot;Record Store Day Black Friday&quot; 10&quot; vinyl picture disc with download card, called &quot;Say Goodnight to The Bad Guys/Remedy&quot; (acoustic live) for independent record stores. The band was also inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame, performing Georgia on My Mind with Chuck Leavell at the 2010 ceremony.

After ending the U.S. tour at The Fillmore in December 2010, the Crowes played nine &quot;Goodnight to the Bad Guys&quot; shows in Europe in July 2011. These included festivals in Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as a few headlining shows where, comparable to the U.S. tour, they played a 90-minute acoustic and 90-minute electric set. The final four shows included two in London (the second of which featured a Jimmy Page-led encore), followed by two that saw them return to Amsterdam&#x27;s Paradiso.

On December 25, 2012, it was announced that the Crowes would embark on a five-show UK trek in March 2013, followed by a 21-date U.S. tour from April to early May. Instead of Luther Dickinson, Jackie Greene would play guitar and provide backup vocals.

On March 19, 2013, the band released its fourth live album, &quot;Wiser for the Time&quot;. It was released as a digital download and as a four-record vinyl set. The album was recorded during the band&#x27;s 2010 series of concerts in New York City. On April 23, 2013, the Black Crowes returned to Atlanta and played at The Tabernacle in front of a capacity crowd. In July 2013, the band kicked off a tour with the Tedeschi Trucks Band. They returned to hiatus in December that year, but played a show in Boston the following February (a benefit event for the Big Brothers association).

On January 15, 2015, Rich Robinson announced the final breakup of the band due to a disagreement with his brother Chris Robinson over an alleged proposal regarding ownership of the band. In an interview, drummer Steve Gorman indicated that prior to the breakup, the Black Crowes had been discussing a tour.

===Post breakup: 2015–2018===
Following the Crowes&#x27; most recent breakup, band members moved on to other musical projects, some of which were active prior to the band&#x27;s disbandment.

Chris Robinson has continued performing with the Chris Robinson Brotherhood, a band he formed in 2011 which also includes Adam MacDougall. He released his third studio album with them, &quot;Any Way You Love, We Know How You Feel&quot;, in 2016, followed by the EP &quot;If You Lived Here, You Would Be Home By Now&quot; later the same year. In 2017, the CRB released &quot;Barefoot in the Head&quot;. The CRB has also released four live albums: &quot;Betty&#x27;s Blends Volumes 1, 2, 3&quot;, and &quot;Betty&#x27;s Midwestern Magic Blends&quot;. Chris Robinson has performed a few solo acoustic shows during which he played several Black Crowes songs, including &quot;Hotel Illness&quot; and &quot;Bad Luck, Blue Eyes Goodbye&quot;.

In 2018, Chris Robinson formed the band As the Crow Flies, which performs songs from the Black Crowes catalogue. Robinson noted, &quot;I&#x27;m not out to redo the Black Crowes or outdo the Black Crowes or anything like that. I just want to sing the music.&quot; The band includes former Crowes Audley Freed and Adam MacDougall and Andy Hess as well as Marcus King and Tony Leone.

Rich Robinson has continued his solo career, recording his fourth solo album, &quot;Flux&quot;, in 2016. In late 2016, he announced the formation of The Magpie Salute which also includes former Black Crowes members Marc Ford and Sven Pipien. The band performs original songs, Black Crowes songs, covers, and selections from Robinson and Ford&#x27;s solo careers. The band released a live album, &quot;The Magpie Salute&quot;, in 2017, and their debut studio album, &quot;High Water I&quot;, was released on August 10, 2018, and &quot;High Water II&quot; was released in 2019.

Steve Gorman continues to perform with Trigger Hippy, a band he co-founded in 2009 (which also featured Jackie Greene until late 2015 when he left to focus on his solo career). His memoir of his time in the band, &quot;Hard to Handle&quot;, was published on September 24, 2019.

Former keyboardist Eddie Harsch died November 4, 2016, at the age of 59.

===Third reunion: 2019–present===

In late 2019, during an interview on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, Chris and Rich Robinson announced that they had resolved their differences (the brothers had not spoken in the years since the band&#x27;s 2015 split) and were planning a 2020 tour to commemorate the 30th anniversary of &quot;Shake Your Money Maker&quot;.

The reunion was greeted with mixed reaction from fans, as the 46-date tour featured no former band members apart from the brothers and, instead, was to feature an entirely new backing band, including guitarist Isaiah Mitchell (from the bands Earthless and Golden Void), bassist Tim Lefebvre (formerly of the Tedeschi Trucks Band), keyboardist Joel Robinow, and drummer Raj Ojha. This line-up premiered at The Bowery Ballroom in New York City on November 11, 2019, where they played the entire &quot;Shake Your Money Maker&quot; album. Chris had tested out several of the new members with his As the Crow Flies project.

Ultimately, the tour was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The dates were eventually rescheduled for summer and fall of 2021. In May 2021, the Crowes announced their rescheduled tour dates and revealed that Sven Pipien would be returning on bass. In June 2021, it was announced that the band had already written at least 20 songs for an upcoming album but had no plans to record them until after the tour. It was also announced that Brian Griffin is the new drummer. He has toured with Brandi Carlile, Richard Marx, Patti Smith and others.

On January 8, 2021, The Black Crowes announced a 30th Anniversary multi-format re-issue of &quot;Shake Your Money Maker&quot;, releasing a previously unheard track &quot;Charming Mess&quot; in conjunction.

In May 2022, the band released their first newly recorded material since the reunion, &quot;1972&quot;, an EP consisting of covers of famous tracks released in 1972.

On March 17, 2023, the band released a double live album on CD and vinyl called &quot;Shake Your Money Maker Live&quot;, a live album with the first disc being their first album played in its entirety in concert and a second disk consisting of live Black Crowes classics plus a cover of the Rolling Stones&#x27;, &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll (But I Like It)&quot;.

The band released the Grammy nominated &quot;Happiness Bastards&quot; on March 15, 2024. Besides Chris and Rich, the lineup for this release consists of Sven Pipien, Nico Bereciartua, Erik Deutsch and Brian Griffin (who left the band before release).

In 2025, the Black Crowes were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the first time.

<text>Christopher Mark Robinson (born December 20, 1966) is an American musician. He founded the rock band The Black Crowes, then known as Mr. Crowe&#x27;s Garden, with his brother Rich Robinson in 1984. Chris is the lead singer of The Black Crowes, and he and his brother are the only continuous members of the Crowes. He was the vocalist and rhythm guitarist for the Chris Robinson Brotherhood, which toured and recorded from 2011 through 2019. The band broke up after the death of guitarist, Neal Casal, and the Crowes’ return from hiatus, respectively. Robinson is noted for his high tenor vocal range and bluesy vocal runs.

==Early years==
Robinson was born in Atlanta, Georgia. He is the son of Nancy Jane (née Bradley) and Stanley &quot;Stan&quot; Robinson, who had a minor Billboard charted record in 1959 called &quot;Boom-A-Dip-Dip&quot; and who died in September 2013. Along with his brother Rich, Robinson formed Mr. Crowe&#x27;s Garden in the 1980s, having been heavily influenced by The Faces and The Rolling Stones. They played a variety of clubs in and around Atlanta.

Robinson attended Wofford College in Spartanburg, South Carolina. As a teenager, Robinson decorated his dorm room with a Tom Waits poster and a Dream Syndicate poster: &quot;...even at 18, I was into music.&quot;

==Career==
===The Black Crowes===

In 1989, Mr. Crowe&#x27;s Garden changed their name to The Black Crowes. They were signed to Rick Rubin&#x27;s label Def American and released their debut album &quot;Shake Your Money Maker&quot;. With the success of their album they went out on tour to support it. They played one date supporting ZZ Top. During this tour Chris was criticized for talking to the audience about his opposition to corporate sponsorship. This led to ZZ Top firing The Black Crowes from the tour.

In May 1991, Chris Robinson spat at or on a female customer at a 7-Eleven convenience store. Robinson was arrested for assault and disturbing the peace, and pleaded no contest six months later.

In the media, Robinson would openly discuss his use of cannabis.

Over the next nine years The Black Crowes went through many lineup changes and released six studio albums. In 1997, The Black Crowes headlined the second Furthur Festival, which had been spawned in the summer of 1996 by the remaining members of the Grateful Dead following Jerry Garcia&#x27;s death in August 1995. In early 2002, it was announced that drummer Steve Gorman would be leaving the band and that The Black Crowes would be taking a break.

===Solo career; with New Earth Mud===

His first solo recording, &quot;The Red Road&quot;, appeared on the soundtrack to the 2002 film &quot;The Banger Sisters&quot;, confirming the singer&#x27;s turn into softer material. A full-length debut, &quot;New Earth Mud&quot;, appeared in October and garnered positive critical reviews. Written and produced with Paul Stacey and featuring collaborations with ex-Crowes Marc Ford and Eddie Harsch, the album allowed Robinson to hit the road as a headlining act. The band itself became known as New Earth Mud and earned a reputation for playing lengthy, jam-oriented sets across the United States.

New Earth Mud toured well into 2003, both headlining and sharing the bill with such acts as Elvis Costello, Gov&#x27;t Mule and The String Cheese Incident. Robinson headed into the studio after the tour concluded, again with Paul Stacey as co-songwriter and producer. The result was &quot;This Magnificent Distance&quot;, released in June 2004. The album was a bigger commercial success than its predecessor and showcased more of a &quot;full band&quot; sound.

Robinson parted ways with Paul Stacey and the rest of his band in early 2004, the reason for which remains unknown. In a very cryptic post on his official message board, Robinson said farewell to his original line-up and welcomed a new one, which featured ex-Crowes member Audley Freed on guitar and George Reiff on bass. The band toured in support of &quot;This Magnificent Distance&quot; through the Summer of 2004. Another tour was planned for the fall of 2004 but was abruptly and inexplicably scrapped. Robinson instead remained out of the public eye aside from three appearances with Phil Lesh and Friends at the Warfield Theatre in San Francisco (December 2004).

Robinson did not perform publicly again until his February 2005 performance with his brother Rich at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas (a private event for people who work in the field of consumer electronics). He then joined Phil Lesh again for the &quot;Mardi Gras Spectacular&quot; concerts in San Francisco at the end of February, which also featured members of Railroad Earth, Particle and Galactic as well as former members of the Jerry Garcia Band.

===The Black Crowes reunion===
In early 2005, it was announced that The Black Crowes would be reuniting for a run at New York&#x27;s Hammerstein Ballroom. This lineup included former members Sven Pipien and Marc Ford. This quickly turned into a full-fledged tour. Although initially not part of the reunion, Steve Gorman did return to the band in early May. In July 2007, during the Black Crowes Summer Tour, the live album &quot;Brothers of a Feather: Live at the Roxy&quot; was released.

The album was composed of tracks culled from Chris and Rich Robinson&#x27;s three night set at the Roxy, and featured Black Crowes songs (Horsehead, Cursed Diamond, Thorn In My Pride), solo material from both brothers (Someday Past the Sunset, Forgiven Song), covers from some of their favorite artists (Over the Hill, Roll Um Easy, Driving Wheel, Forever Young), and new material (Magic Rooster Blues, Cold Boy Smile). A new album, &quot;Warpaint&quot;, was released on March 4, 2008.

On August 31, 2009, the Black Crowes released another album of original material, recorded in front of a live audience over several shows at Levon Helm&#x27;s barn in New York, &quot;Before the Frost...Until the Freeze&quot;. Each CD purchase of &quot;Before the Frost...&quot; was accompanied by a download code to receive the album&#x27;s companion release, &quot;...Until the Freeze&quot;. The vinyl version includes all 20 tracks.

In April 2010, it was announced that in celebration of the band&#x27;s 20th anniversary, they would release &quot;Croweology&quot;, featuring new acoustic recordings of Black Crowes&#x27; favorites. The two-disc set would be sold at the price of one as a thank you to fans. In conjunction with the release, the band would also embark on the &quot;Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys&quot; tour, which would stretch from August 2010 – December 2010. The majority of the shows saw the band perform two 90 minute sets, the first acoustic, and the second electric. At the end of the tour, it was announced the band would begin a new hiatus of undetermined length.

On January 15, 2015, Rich Robinson announced the final breakup of the band due to a disagreement with his brother Chris Robinson over an alleged proposal regarding ownership of the band. In an interview, drummer Steve Gorman indicated that prior to the breakup, the Black Crowes had been discussing a tour.

On the November 11, 2019 Howard Stern Show Chris and Rich announced that they were reuniting to tour reprising their first studio album, &quot;Shake Your Money Maker&quot;.

===Chris Robinson Brotherhood===
In the fall of 2010, the website for the &quot;Chris Robinson Band&quot; was launched, fueling speculation that this would be Chris&#x27; new project with the advent of the Crowes&#x27; hiatus. This was confirmed at the final date of the &quot;Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys&quot; Tour in San Francisco, when stickers advertising the band and the website were passed out promoting April 2011. Eventually, the project was titled the Chris Robinson Brotherhood (CRB), and a two-month California tour was launched on March 29, 2011, at Soho in Santa Barbara, California and the group toured California heavily. The Chris Robinson Brotherhood lineup includes Adam MacDougall (of the Black Crowes) on keyboards, George Sluppick on drums (George has been replaced by Tony Leone), Mark &quot;Muddy&quot; Dutton (of Burning Tree) on bass, and Neal Casal on guitar. Casal replaced Jonathan Wilson, who was initially announced as a member of the band, but left shortly after.

CRB went into Sunset Studios to record an album in January 2012. Their first album, &quot;Big Moon Ritual&quot;, was released on June 5, 2012, with the companion album &quot;The Magic Door&quot; released on September 11, 2012. CRB also released a 7&quot; of &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; b/w a live version &quot;Girl, I Love You&quot; for Record Store Day on April 21, 2012.

===As the Crow Flies===
In 2018, Chris Robinson formed the band &quot;As the Crow Flies&quot;, which performs songs from the Black Crowes catalogue. Robinson said, &quot;I&#x27;m not out to redo the Black Crowes or outdo the Black Crowes or anything like that. I just want to sing the music.&quot; The band includes former Crowes Audley Freed, Andy Hess and Adam MacDougall, along with Marcus King, and Tony Leone.

===Production work===
Although he dabbled in the field earlier, Robinson began consistently producing other artists&#x27; albums in the late-2000s. Although few of the albums produced under his guidance were commercial successes, most received considerable critical acclaim.

===Other appearances===
Robinson made a cameo appearance (playing an angel) in the final episode of the popular sketch show &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; in 1994. According to &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; Season 5 DVD commentary, Robinson met Kate Hudson at a live &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; performance during their 2000 reunion tour. In 2007, Chris Robinson played Wavy Gravy&#x27;s birthday party in San Francisco under the name Chris Robinson&#x27;s Wooden Family. The show was a benefit to support an international development organization called the Seva Foundation founded by Wavy along with Ram Dass.

In 2009, Robinson performed in &quot;The People Speak&quot;, a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian Howard Zinn&#x27;s &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot;.

==Personal life==
On September 8, 1996, he married actress Lala Sloatman, niece (by marriage) of musician Frank Zappa. They were divorced in 1998.

In December 2000, Robinson married actress Kate Hudson. Their son, Ryder was born in January 2004. On August 14, 2006, after nearly six years of marriage, Hudson&#x27;s publicist announced their separation. On November 17, 2006, Robinson filed divorce papers, citing irreconcilable differences and seeking joint custody of their son. Divorce was granted on October 22, 2007, with Robinson being granted joint custody.

In 2009, Robinson married Allison Bridges. Their daughter was born in December 2009. In 2015 he moved to Marin County, California, where he still resides. He and Bridges divorced in October 2018.

In January 2020, Robinson married Camille Johnson in Marin County.

<doc id="162109" wikidata="Q315537" url="?curid=162109" title="William Cowper">
<text>William Cowper ( ; 15 November 1731 (Julian)&lt;ref name=&quot;1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Calendar&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; / 26 November 1731 (Gregorian) 14 April 1800 (Julian) / 25 April 1800 (Gregorian)) was an English poet and Anglican hymnwriter.

One of the most popular poets of his time, Cowper changed the direction of 18th-century nature poetry by writing of everyday life and scenes of the English countryside. In many ways, he was one of the forerunners of Romantic poetry. Samuel Taylor Coleridge called him &quot;the best modern poet&quot;, whilst William Wordsworth particularly admired his poem &quot;Yardley-Oak&quot;.

After being institutionalised for insanity, Cowper found refuge in a fervent evangelical Christianity. He continued to suffer doubt about his salvation and, after a dream in 1773, believed that he was doomed to eternal damnation. He recovered, and went on to write more religious hymns.

His religious sentiment and association with John Newton (who wrote the hymn &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;) led to much of the poetry for which he is best remembered, and to the series of Olney Hymns. His poem &quot;Light Shining out of Darkness&quot; gave English the phrase: &quot;God moves in a mysterious way/ His wonders to perform.&quot;

He also wrote a number of anti-slavery poems, and his friendship with Newton, who was an avid anti-slavery campaigner, resulted in Cowper&#x27;s being asked to write in support of the Abolitionist campaign. Cowper wrote a poem called &quot;The Negro&#x27;s Complaint&quot; (1788) which rapidly became very famous, and was often quoted by Martin Luther King Jr. during the 20th-century civil rights movement. He also wrote several other less well-known poems on slavery in the 1780s, many of which attacked the idea that slavery was economically viable.

==Early life==

Cowper was born in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, where his father John Cowper was rector of the Church of St Peter. His father&#x27;s sister was the poet Judith Madan. His mother was Ann née Donne. He and his brother John were the only two of seven children to live past infancy. Ann died giving birth to John on 7 November 1737. His mother&#x27;s death at such an early age troubled William deeply and was the subject of his poem &quot;On the Receipt of My Mother&#x27;s Picture&quot;, written more than fifty years later. He grew close to her family in his early years. He was particularly close with her brother Robert and his wife Harriot. They instilled in young William a love of reading and gave him some of his first books – John Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; and John Gay&#x27;s &quot;Fables.&quot;

Cowper was first enrolled in Westminster School in April 1742 after moving from school to school for a number of years. He had begun to study Latin at a young age, and was an eager scholar of Latin for the rest of his life. Older children bullied Cowper through many of his younger years. At Westminster School he studied under the headmaster John Nicoll. At the time, Westminster School was popular amongst families belonging to England&#x27;s Whig political party. Many intelligent boys from families of a lower social status also attended, however. Cowper made lifelong friends from Westminster. He read through the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, which ignited his lifelong scholarship and love for Homer&#x27;s epics. He grew skilled at the interpretation and translation of Latin, an ability he put to use for the rest of his life. He was skilled in the composition of Latin as well and wrote many verses of his own.

==Career==
After education at Westminster School, Cowper was articled to Mr Chapman, solicitor, of Ely Place, Holborn, to be trained for a career in law. During this time, he spent his leisure at the home of his uncle Bob Cowper, where he fell in love with his cousin Theodora, whom he wished to marry. But as James Croft, who in 1825 first published the poems Cowper addressed to Theodora, wrote, &quot;her father, from an idea that the union of persons so nearly related was improper, refused to accede to the wishes of his daughter and nephew.&quot; This refusal left Cowper distraught. He had his first severe attack of depression/mental illness, referred to at the time as melancholy.

In 1763 he was offered a Clerkship of Journals in the House of Lords, but broke under the strain of the approaching examination; he experienced a worse period of depression and insanity. At this time he tried three times to commit suicide and was sent to Nathaniel Cotton&#x27;s asylum at St Albans for recovery. His poem beginning &quot;Hatred and vengeance, my eternal portion&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;Sapphics&quot;) was written in the aftermath of his suicide attempt.

After recovering, he settled at Huntingdon with a retired clergyman named Morley Unwin and his wife Mary. Cowper grew to be on such good terms with the Unwin family that he went to live in their house, and moved with them to Olney. There he met curate John Newton, a former captain of slave ships who had devoted his life to the Christian gospel. Not long afterwards, Morley Unwin was killed in a fall from his horse; Cowper continued to live in the Unwin home and became greatly attached to the widow Mary Unwin.

At Olney, Newton invited Cowper to contribute to a hymnbook that he was compiling. The resulting volume, known as &quot;Olney Hymns,&quot; was not published until 1779 but includes hymns such as &quot;Praise for the Fountain Opened&quot; (beginning &quot;There is a fountain fill&#x27;d with blood&quot;) and &quot;Light Shining out of Darkness&quot; (beginning &quot;God Moves in a Mysterious Way&quot;), which remain some of Cowper&#x27;s most familiar verses. Several of Cowper&#x27;s hymns, as well as others originally published in the &quot;Olney Hymns,&quot; are today preserved in the &quot;Sacred Harp,&quot; which also collects shape note songs.

In 1773, Cowper experienced an attack of insanity, imagining not only that he was eternally condemned to hell, but that God was commanding him to make a sacrifice of his own life. Mary Unwin took care of him with great devotion, and after a year he began to recover. In 1779, after Newton had moved from Olney to London, Cowper started to write poetry again. Mary Unwin, wanting to keep Cowper&#x27;s mind occupied, suggested that he write on the subject of &quot;The Progress of Error.&quot; After writing a satire of this name, he wrote seven others. These poems were collected and published in 1782 under the title &quot;Poems by William Cowper, of the Inner Temple, Esq.&quot;
In 1781 Cowper met a sophisticated and charming widow named Lady Austen who inspired new poetry. Cowper himself tells of the genesis of what some have considered his most substantial work, &quot;The Task,&quot; in his &quot;Advertisement&quot; to the original edition of 1785:
...a lady, fond of blank verse, demanded a poem of that kind from the author, and gave him the SOFA for a subject. He obeyed; and, having much leisure, connected another subject with it; and, pursuing the train of thought to which his situation and turn of mind led him, brought forth at length, instead of the trifle which he at first intended, a serious affaira Volume!
In the same volume Cowper also printed &quot;The Diverting History of John Gilpin&quot;, a notable piece of comic verse. G. K. Chesterton, in &quot;Orthodoxy&quot;, later credited the writing of &quot;John Gilpin&quot; with saving Cowper from becoming completely insane.

Cowper and Mary Unwin moved to Weston Underwood, Buckinghamshire, in 1786, having become close to his cousin Harriett Hesketh (Theodora&#x27;s sister). During this period he started his translations of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; into blank verse. His versions (published in 1791) were the most significant English renderings of these epic poems since those of Alexander Pope earlier in the century. Later critics have faulted Cowper&#x27;s Homer for being too much in the mould of John Milton.

In 1789 Cowper befriended a cousin, Dr John Johnson, a Norfolk clergyman, and in 1795 Cowper and Mary moved to Norfolk to be near him and his sister Catharine. They originally stayed at North Tuddenham, then at Dunham Lodge near Swaffham and then Mundesley before finally settling in East Dereham (all places in Norfolk) with the Johnsons, after Mary Unwin became paralysed.

Mary Unwin died in 1796, plunging Cowper into a gloom from which he never fully recovered. He did continue to revise his Homer for a second edition of his translation. Aside from writing the powerful and bleak poem &quot;The Castaway&quot;, he penned some English translations of Greek verse and translated some of the &quot;Fables&quot; of John Gay into Latin.

==Death and memorials==

Cowper was seized with edema, or dropsy, in the spring of 1800 and died on 25 April. He is buried in the chapel of St Thomas of Canterbury, St Nicholas&#x27;s Church in East Dereham, and a stained-glass window there commemorates his life.

In St Peter&#x27;s Church in Berkhamsted there are two windows in memory of Cowper: The east window by Clayton &amp; Bell (1872) depicts Cowper at his writing desk accompanied by his pet hares, and bears the inscription &quot;Salvation to the dying man, And to the rising God&quot; (a line from Cowper&#x27;s poem &quot;The Saviour, what a noble flame&quot;); and in the north aisle, an etched glass window is inscribed with lines from &quot;Oh! for a closer walk with God&quot; and &quot;The Task&quot;. In the same church there is also a memorial tablet to the poet&#x27;s mother, Ann Cowper. Cowper is also commemorated (along with George Herbert) by another Clayton &amp; Bell stained-glass window in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Westminster Abbey.

In 1823, Cowper&#x27;s correspondence was published posthumously from the original letters in the possession of his kinsman John Johnson.

Near the village of Weston Underwood, Buckinghamshire, where Cowper once resided, is a folly named Cowper&#x27;s Alcove. The folly was built by the Lord of the Manor of Weston House, a member of the Throckmorton family in 1753. Cowper was known to visit there frequently for inspiration for his poetry. The alcove is mentioned in Cowper&#x27;s &quot;The Task&quot;. The folly was dedicated to Cowper by the Buckinghamshire county council green belt estate, and a plaque with the verse from &quot;The Task&quot; referencing the alcove was installed.

== Celibacy ==
Modern literary scholar Conrad Brunstrom described Cowper&#x27;s relationships with women and men at this time as queer and radically anti-heteronormative. &quot;Not only did Cowper refuse a traditional heterosexual role, he also refused many of the attributes attached to those who were supposed to have refused such a role...making him anti-heteronormative and anti-homonormative at one and the same time.&quot; Cowper&#x27;s 18th century understanding of his own predicament was that—being &quot;what the world calls an old bachelor&quot;—he was nevertheless &quot;a rational creature&quot;, much abused by those who would make sport of him.

William Cowper translated Homer&#x27;s two epic poems: &quot;The Iliad&quot; and &quot;The Odyssey.&quot; His translations of these ancient Greek classics are considered significant contributions to English literature. Cowper&#x27;s translations of Homer were part of a broader movement in the 18th and 19th centuries to make classical literature more accessible to English-speaking audiences. While his translations may not be as widely read today as some others, they were influential in their time and contributed to the ongoing appreciation of Homer&#x27;s works in English-speaking countries.

===Hymns===
William Cowper is represented with fifteen hymns in Edwin F. Hatfield&#x27;s 1872 Presbyterian opus &quot;The Church Hymn Book for the Worship of God&quot;.
* 127 &quot;Jesus! where&#x27;er thy people meet&quot; 
* 357 &quot;The Spirit breathes upon the word&quot; 
* 450 &quot;There is a fountain, filled with blood&quot;
* 790 &quot;Hark! my soul! it is the Lord&quot;
* 856 &quot;To Jesus, the Crown of my hope&quot;
* 871 &quot;Far from the world, O Lord! I flee&quot;

* 1009 &quot;O Lord! in sorrow I resign&quot; 
* 1029 &quot;O Lord! my best desire fulfill&quot;

==Familiar quotations==
&lt;poem&gt; moves in a mysterious way,
His wonders to perform;
He plants his footsteps in the sea,
And rides upon the storm.&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;There is a fountain fill&#x27;d with blood
Drawn from &#x27;s veins;
And sinners, plung&#x27;d beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains.&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;Oh! for a closer walk with ,
A calm and heav&#x27;nly frame;
A light to shine upon the road
That leads me to the Lamb!&lt;/poem&gt;

God made the country, and man made the town.

There is a pleasure in poetic pains
Which only poets know.


Variety&#x27;s the very spice of life,
That gives it all its flavour.

&lt;poem&gt;I am monarch of all I survey,
My right there is none to dispute;
From the centre all round to the sea,
I am lord of the fowl and the brute.&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;No voice divine the storm allay&#x27;d,
No light propitious shone;
When, snatch&#x27;d from all effectual aid,
We perish&#x27;d, each alone;
But I beneath a rougher sea,
And whelmed in deeper gulphs than he.&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;&#x27;Tis pleasant, through the loopholes of retreat,
To peep at such a world; to see the stir
Of the great Babel, and not feel the crowd;
To hear the roar she sends through all her gates
At a safe distance, where the dying sound
Falls a soft murmur on the uninjur&#x27;d ear.&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="162110" wikidata="Q42804" url="?curid=162110" title="Beard">
<text>A beard is the hair that grows on the jaw, chin, upper lip, lower lip, cheeks, and neck of humans and some non-human animals. In humans, usually pubescent or adult males are able to start growing beards, on average at the age of 18.

Throughout the course of human history, societal attitudes toward male beards have varied widely depending on factors such as prevailing cultural traditions and the current era&#x27;s fashion trends. Several religions have considered a full beard to be essential and mandate it as part of their observance. Other cultures, even while not officially mandating it, view a beard as central to a man&#x27;s virility, exemplifying such virtues as virtue, beauty, wisdom, strength, fertility, sexual prowess, and high social status. In cultures where facial hair is uncommon (or currently out of fashion), beards may be associated with poor hygiene or an unconventional demeanor. In countries with colder climates, beards help protect the wearer&#x27;s face from the elements. Beards also provide sun protection.

==Biology==
The beard develops in human males during puberty. Beard growth is linked to stimulation of hair follicles in the area by dihydrotestosterone, which continues to affect beard growth after puberty. Dihydrotestosterone also promotes balding. Dihydrotestosterone is produced from testosterone, the levels of which vary with season. Beard growth rate is also genetic.

===Evolution===
Biologists characterize beards as a secondary sexual characteristic because they are (mostly) unique to one sex, yet do not play a direct role in reproduction. Charles Darwin first suggested a possible evolutionary explanation of beards in his work &quot;The Descent of Man&quot;, which hypothesized that the process of sexual selection may have led to beards. Modern biologists have reaffirmed the role of sexual selection in the evolution of beards, concluding that there is evidence that a majority of women find men with beards more attractive than men without beards.

Evolutionary psychology explanations for the existence of beards include signalling sexual maturity and signalling dominance by the increasing perceived size of jaws; clean-shaved faces are rated less dominant than bearded. Some scholars assert that it is not yet established whether the sexual selection leading to beards is rooted in attractiveness (inter-sexual selection) or dominance (intra-sexual selection). A beard can be explained as an indicator of a male&#x27;s overall condition. The rate of facial hairiness appears to influence male attractiveness. The presence of a beard makes the male vulnerable in hand-to-hand fights (it provides an easy way to grab and hold the opponent&#x27;s head), which is costly, so biologists have speculated that there must be other evolutionary benefits that outweigh that drawback. Excess testosterone evidenced by the beard may indicate mild immunosuppression, which may support spermatogenesis.

==Styles==


Beard hair is most commonly removed by shaving or by trimming with the use of a beard trimmer. If only the area above the upper lip is left unshaven, the resulting facial hairstyle is known as a mustache; if hair is left only on the chin, the style is a goatee.

* Full: downward flowing beard with either a styled or integrated mustache
* Garibaldi: wide, full beard with rounded bottom and integrated mustache
* Old Dutch: A large, long beard, connected by sideburns, that flares outward in width at the bottom, without a mustache.
* Sideburns: hair grown from the temples down the cheeks toward the jawline. Worn by Ambrose Burnside (the namesake of the style), Isaac Asimov and Carlos Menem.
* Jawline beard: A beard that is grown from the chin along the jawline. Chinstrap, chin curtain and brett are all variations of a jawline beard with distinctions being chin coverage and sideburn length.
* Chinstrap: a beard with long sideburns that comes forward and ends under the chin.
* Chin curtain: similar to the chinstrap beard but covers the entire chin. Also called a Lincoln, Shenandoah, or spade.
* Brett: similar to the chin curtain beard, but does not connect to the sideburns.
* Neckbeard: similar to the chinstrap, but with the chin and jawline shaven, leaving hair to grow only on the neck. While never as popular as other beard styles, a few noted historical figures have worn this type of beard, such as Nero, Horace Greeley, Henry David Thoreau, William Empson, Peter Cooper, Moses Mendelssohn, Richard Wagner, and Michael Costa.
* Circle beard: Commonly mistaken for the goatee, the circle beard is a small chin beard that connects around the mouth to a mustache. Also called a &quot;doorknocker&quot;.
* Designer stubble: A short growth of the male beard that was popular in the West in the 1980s, and experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 2010s.
* Sea captain: A rounded, bottom-heavy beard of medium length with short sides that is often paired with a longer mustache.

==Maintenance==

For appearance and cleanliness, some people maintain their beards by exfoliating the skin, using soap or shampoo and sometimes conditioner, and afterward applying oils for softness.

==History==

===Ancient and classical world===

====Lebanon====
Phoenicia, the ancient Semitic civilization centered on the coastline of what is today Lebanon, gave great attention to the hair and beard. It was arranged in three, four, or five rows of small tight curls, and extended from ear to ear around the cheeks and chin. Sometimes, however, in lieu of the many rows, we find one row only, the beard falling in tresses curled at the extremity. There is no indication of the Phoenicians having cultivated mustachios.

====Israelites====

Israelite society placed a special importance on the beard. Many male religious figures mentioned in the Tanakh are recorded to have had facial hair. According to biblical scholars, the shaving of hair, particularly of the &quot;corners of the beard&quot;, was a mourning custom. The religious cultivation of beards by Israelites may have been done as a deliberate attempt to distinguish their behaviour in comparison to their neighbours, reducing the impact of foreign customs (and religion) as a result. The Hittites and Elamites were clean-shaven, and the Sumerians were also frequently without a beard; conversely, the Egyptians and Libyans shaved the beard into very stylised elongated goatees. 

====Mesopotamia====

Mesopotamian civilizations (Sumerian, Assyrians, Babylonians, Chaldeans and Medians) devoted great care to oiling and dressing their beards, using tongs and curling irons to create elaborate ringlets and tiered patterns.

====Egypt====
While generally ancient Egyptian fashion called for men to be clean-shaven, during at least some periods the highest ranking Ancient Egyptians grew hair on their chins which was often dyed a reddish orange with henna and sometimes plaited with an interwoven gold thread. A metal false beard, or postiche, which was a sign of sovereignty, was worn by kings and by queens regnant. This was held in place by a ribbon tied over the head and attached to a gold chin strap, a fashion existing from about .

====Greece====

The ancient Greeks regarded the beard as a badge or sign of virility; in the Homeric epics it had almost sanctified significance, so that a common form of entreaty was to touch the beard of the person addressed. According to William Smith in these ancient times the moustache was shaven, leaving clear the space around the lips. It was only shaven as a sign of mourning, though in this case it was instead often left untrimmed. A smooth face was regarded as a sign of effeminacy. The Spartans punished cowards by shaving off a portion of their beards. Greek beards were also frequently curled with tongs. Youngsters usually did not grow a beard, moreover wearing a beard became optional for adults in the .

====Macedon====
In Ancient Macedonia, during the time of Alexander the Great (r. 336–323 BCE) the custom of smooth shaving was introduced. Alexander strongly promoted shaving during his reign because he believed it looked tidier. Reportedly, Alexander ordered his soldiers to be clean-shaven, fearing that their beards would serve as handles for their enemies to grab and hold onto. The practice of shaving spread from the Macedonians, whose kings are represented on coins, statues, etc. with smooth faces, throughout the whole known world of the Macedonian Empire. Laws were passed against it, without effect, at Rhodes and Byzantium; even Aristotle conformed to the new custom, unlike the other philosophers, who retained the beard as a badge of their profession. Due to this, a man with a beard, after the Macedonian period, implied a philosopher; there are many allusions to this custom of the later philosophers in such proverbs as: &quot;The beard does not make the sage.&quot; Due to this association with philosophers, who lost reputation over time, the beard acquired more and more a negative connotation, as in Theodore Prodromos, Lucian of Samosata and Julian the apostate (who wrote the Misopogon, i. e. &quot;beard hater&quot;)

====Rome====
Shaving seems to have not been known to the Romans during their early history (under the kings of Rome and the early Republic). Pliny tells us that P. Ticinius was the first who brought a barber to Rome, which was in the 454th year from the founding of the city (that is, around ). Scipio Africanus () was apparently the first among the Romans who shaved his beard. However, after that point, shaving seems to have caught on very quickly, and soon almost all Roman men were clean-shaven; being clean-shaven became a sign of being Roman and not Greek. Only in the later times of the Republic did the Roman youth begin shaving their beards only partially, trimming it into an ornamental form; prepubescent boys oiled their chins in hopes of forcing premature growth of a beard.

Still, beards remained rare among the Romans throughout the Late Republic and the early Principate. In a general way, in Rome at this time, a long beard was considered a mark of slovenliness and squalor. The censors L. Veturius and P. Licinius compelled M. Livius, who had been banished, on his restoration to the city, to be shaved, to lay aside his dirty appearance, and then, but not until then, to come into the Senate. The first occasion of shaving was regarded as the beginning of manhood, and the day on which this took place was celebrated as a festival. Usually, this was done when the young Roman assumed the &quot;toga virilis&quot;. Augustus did it in his twenty-fourth year, Caligula in his twentieth. The hair cut off on such occasions was consecrated to a god. Thus Nero put his into a golden box set with pearls, and dedicated it to Jupiter Capitolinus. The Romans, unlike the Greeks, let their beards grow in time of mourning; so did Augustus for the death of Julius Caesar. Other occasions of mourning on which the beard was allowed to grow were, appearance as a &quot;reus&quot;, condemnation, or some public calamity. On the other hand, men of the country areas around Rome in the time of Varro seem not to have shaved except when they came to market every eighth day, so that their usual appearance was most likely a short stubble.

In the the Emperor Hadrian (r. 117 - 138), according to Dio Cassius, was the first emperor to grow a full beard; Plutarch says that he did it to hide scars on his face. This was a period in Rome of widespread imitation of Greek culture, and many other men grew beards in imitation of Hadrian and the Greek fashion. After Hadrian until the reign of Constantine the Great (r. 306–337) all adult emperors appear in busts and coins with beards; but Constantine and his successors until the reign of Phocas (r. 602 - 610), with the exception of Julian the Apostate (r. 361 - 363), are represented as beardless. The wearing of the beard as an imperial fashion was subsequently revived by Phocas at the beginning of the 7th century and this fashion lasted until the end of the Byzantine Empire.

====The &quot;philosopher&#x27;s beard&quot;====
In Greco-Roman antiquity the beard was &quot;seen as the defining characteristic of the philosopher; philosophers had to have beards, and anyone with a beard was assumed to be a philosopher.&quot; While one may be tempted to think that Socrates and Plato sported &quot;philosopher&#x27;s beards&quot;, such is not the case. 
Shaving was not widespread in Athens during fifth and fourth-century BCE and so they would not be distinguished from the general populace for having a beard. The popularity of shaving did not rise in the region until the example of Alexander the Great near the end of the fourth century BCE. The popularity of shaving did not spread to Rome until the end of the third century BCE following its acceptance by Scipio Africanus. In Rome shaving&#x27;s popularity grew to the point that for a respectable Roman citizen, it was seen almost as compulsory.

The idea of the philosopher&#x27;s beard gained traction when in 155 BCE three philosophers arrived in Rome as Greek diplomats: Carneades, head of the Platonic Academy; Critolaus of Aristotle&#x27;s Lyceum; and the head of the Stoics, Diogenes of Babylon. &quot;In contrast to their beautifully clean-shaven Italian audience, these three intellectuals all sported magnificent beards.&quot; Thus the connection of beards and philosophy caught hold of the Roman public imagination.

The importance of the beard to Roman philosophers is best seen by the extreme value that the Stoic philosopher Epictetus placed on it. As historian John Sellars puts it, Epictetus &quot;affirmed the philosopher&#x27;s beard as something almost sacred...to express the idea that philosophy is no mere intellectual hobby but rather a way of life that, by definition, transforms every aspect of one&#x27;s behavior, including one&#x27;s shaving habits. If someone continues to shave in order to look the part of a respectable Roman citizen, it is clear that they have not yet embraced philosophy conceived as a way of life and have not yet escaped the social customs of the majority...the true philosopher will only act according to reason or according to nature, rejecting the arbitrary conventions that guide the behavior of everyone else.&quot;

Epictetus saw his beard as an integral part of his identity and held that he would rather be executed than submit to any force demanding he remove it. In his Discourses 1.2.29, he puts forward such a hypothetical confrontation: Come now, Epictetus, shave your beard&#x27;. If I am a philosopher, I answer, I will not shave it off. &#x27;Then I will have you beheaded&#x27;. If it will do you any good, behead me.&quot; The act of shaving &quot;would be to compromise his philosophical ideal of living in accordance with nature and it would be to submit to the unjustified authority of another.&quot;

This was not theoretical in the age of Epictetus, for the Emperor Domitian had the hair and beard forcibly shaven off of the philosopher Apollonius of Tyana &quot;as punishment for anti-State activities.&quot; This disgraced Apollonius while avoiding making him a martyr like Socrates. Well before his declaration of &quot;death before shaving&quot; Epictetus had been forced to flee Rome when Domitian banished all philosophers from Italy under threat of execution.

Roman philosophers sported different styles of beards to distinguish which school they belonged to. Cynics with long dirty beards to indicate their &quot;strict indifference to all external goods and social customs&quot;; Stoics occasionally trimming and washing their beards in accordance with their view &quot;that it is acceptable to prefer certain external goods so long as they are never valued above virtue&quot;; Peripatetics took great care of their beards believing in accordance with Aristotle that &quot;external goods and social status were necessary for the good life together with virtue&quot;. To a Roman philosopher in this era, having a beard and its condition indicated their commitment to live in accordance with their philosophy.

====Celts and Germanic tribes====
Late Hellenistic sculptures of Celts portray them with long hair and mustaches but beardless. Caesar reported the Britons wore no beard except upon the upper lip.

The Anglo-Saxons on arrival in Great Britain wore beards and continued to do so for a considerable time after. Among the Gaelic Celts of Scotland and Ireland, men typically let their facial hair grow into a full beard, and it was often seen as dishonourable for a Gaelic man to have no facial hair.

Tacitus states that among the Catti, a Germanic tribe (perhaps the Chatten), a young man was not allowed to shave or cut his hair until he had slain an enemy. The Lombards derived their name from the great length of their beards (Longobards – Long Beards). When Otto the Great said anything serious, he swore by his beard, which covered his breast.

===Middle Ages===
In Medieval Europe, a beard displayed a knight&#x27;s virility and honour.
The Castilian knight El Cid is described in &quot;The Lay of the Cid&quot; as &quot;the one with the flowery beard&quot;.
Holding somebody else&#x27;s beard was a serious offence that had to be righted in a duel.
The punishment for pulling off someone else&#x27;s beard was the same as for castrating him.

While most noblemen and knights were bearded, the Catholic clergy were generally required to be clean-shaven. This was understood as a symbol of their celibacy.

In pre-Islamic Arabia, Arabian men would apparently shorten their beards and keep big mustachios. Muhammad encouraged his followers to do the opposite, to grow their beards and trim their moustaches, to differ with the non-believers. This style of beard subsequently spread along with Islam during the Muslim expansion in the Middle Ages.

===From the Renaissance to the present day===
Most Chinese emperors of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) appear with beards or mustaches in portraits.

In the 15th century, most European men in both the church and the nobility were clean-shaven. In the 16th-century beards became fashionable, particularly following the Reformation where many rulers, nobles and religious reformers grew long beards to distinguish themselves from the usually clean shaven Catholic clergy. By the mid 16th century most Catholic clergy also adopted beards. Every pope from Clement VII (pope 1523–1534) to Innocent XII (pope 1691–1700) would also sport facial hair. Some other beards of this time were the Spanish spade beard, the English square cut beard, the forked beard, and the stiletto beard. In 1587 Francis Drake claimed, in a figure of speech, to have singed the King of Spain&#x27;s beard.

During the Chinese Qing dynasty (1644–1911), the ruling Manchu minority were either clean-shaven or at most wore mustaches, in contrast to the Han majority who still wore beards in keeping with the Confucian ideal.

In the beginning of the 17th century, the size of beards decreased in urban circles of Western Europe with the shape also becoming more pointed. By the middle of the century men usually wore a mustache or a pointed goatee. In the later part of the century, being clean-shaven gradually became more common again amongst the upper classes, so much so that in 1698 Peter the Great of Russia ordered men to shave off their beards, and in 1705 levied a tax on beards in order to bring Russian society more in line with contemporary Western Europe. Throughout the 18th century essentially all upper class and most middle class European men would be clean shaven.

At the end of the 18th century, after the French Revolution, attitudes began to turn away from the upper class fashions of the previous century particularly among the lower classes. During the early 19th century most men, particularly amongst the nobility and upper classes, went clean-shaven. However the shifts which had begun during the revolutionary period began to creep their way into first the middle and then the upper classes and this included the gradual return of facial hair. This is seen in the 1810s and 1820s with many men adopting sideburns or side whiskers which gradually grew in size in the ensuing decades. Facial hair also became more common amongst western armies during this period with the &#x27;regimental mustache&#x27; becoming a common association with the soldiers of the time. 

This was followed by a dramatic shift in the beard&#x27;s popularity following the Crimean War during the 1850s, with it becoming markedly more popular. Consequently, beards were adopted by many monarchs, such as Alexander III of Russia, Napoleon III of France, Franz Joseph I of Austria and William I of Germany, as well as many leading statesmen and cultural figures, such as Benjamin Disraeli, Charles Dickens, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Karl Marx, and Giuseppe Verdi. This trend can be also recognised in the United States of America, where the shift can be seen amongst the presidents during and after the Civil War in the period of 1861 - 1913. Before Abraham Lincoln, no President had a beard; after Lincoln until William Howard Taft, every President except Andrew Johnson and William McKinley had either a beard or a moustache. Since 1913 when Woodrow Wilson became president all presidents have been clean-shaven.

The beard became linked in this period with notions of masculinity and male courage. The resulting popularity has contributed to the stereotypical Victorian male figure in the popular mind, the stern figure clothed in black whose gravitas is added to by a heavy beard. 

In China, the revolution of 1911 and subsequent May Fourth Movement of 1919 led the Chinese to idealize the West as more modern and progressive than themselves. This included the realm of fashion, and Chinese men began shaving their faces and cutting their hair short.

By the early-twentieth century, beards began a slow decline in popularity. Although retained by some prominent figures who were young men in the Victorian period (like Sigmund Freud), most men who retained facial hair during the 1920s and 1930s limited themselves to a moustache or a goatee (such as with Marcel Proust, Albert Einstein, Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, Adolf Hitler, and Joseph Stalin). In the United States, meanwhile, popular movies portrayed heroes with clean-shaven faces and &quot;crew cuts&quot;. Concurrently, the psychological mass marketing of Edward Bernays and Madison Avenue was becoming prevalent. The Gillette Safety Razor Company was one of these marketers&#x27; early clients. The phrase &quot;&quot;, as a pejorative for stubble, was coined circa 1942 in advertising for Gem Blades, by the American Safety Razor Company, and entered popular usage. These events conspired to popularize short hair and clean-shaven faces as the only acceptable style for decades to come. The few men who wore the beard or portions of the beard during this period were usually either old, Central European, members of a religious sect that required it, or in academia. This case of affairs would last all the way until the mid to late 1960s.

The beard was reintroduced to mainstream society by the counterculture, firstly with the &quot;beatniks&quot; in the 1950s, and then with the hippie movement of the mid-1960s. Following the Vietnam War, facial hair exploded in popularity. In the mid-late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, beards were worn by hippies and businessmen alike. Popular musicians like The Beatles, Barry White, The Beach Boys, Jim Morrison (lead singer of The Doors) and the male members of Peter, Paul, and Mary, among many others, wore full beards or mustaches. The trend of seemingly ubiquitous facial hair in American culture subsided by the beginning of the 1980s.

By the end of the 20th century, the closely clipped Verdi beard, often with a matching integrated moustache, had become relatively common. From the 1990s onward, fashion in the United States has generally trended toward either a goatee, Van Dyke, or a closely cropped full beard undercut on the throat. By 2010, the fashionable length approached a &quot;two-day shadow&quot;. The 2010s decade also saw the full beard become fashionable again amongst young hipster men and a huge increase in the sales of male grooming products.

One stratum of American society where facial hair was long rare is in government and politics. The last President of the United States to wear any type of facial hair was William Howard Taft, who was in office from 1909 to 1913. The last Vice President of the United States to wear any facial hair was Charles Curtis, who was in office from 1929 to 1933. Both of whom wore moustaches, but the last President of the United States to wear a beard was Benjamin Harrison; who was in office from 1889 to 1893. The last member of the United States Supreme Court with a full beard was Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, who served on the Court until 1941. Since 2015 a growing number of male political figures have worn beards in office, including Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, and Senators Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton. 2024 Vice Presidential nominee JD Vance is the first member of a presidential ticket to wear facial hair since Thomas Dewey in 1948.


==In religion==
Beards also play a symbolic role in several religious traditions.

In Greek mythology and art, Zeus and Poseidon are always portrayed with full beards, but Apollo never is. A bearded Hermes was replaced with the more familiar beardless youth in the . Zoroaster, the ancient Iranian prophet and founder of Zoroastrianism, is always depicted with a long beard. In Norse mythology and art, Odin and Thor are always portrayed with full beards.

===Christianity===

Iconography and Christian art dating from the 3rd century onwards almost always portray Jesus Christ with a long beard. In paintings and statues most of the biblical patriarchs and prophets of the Old Testament, such as Moses and Abraham, and the disciples of Jesus in the New Testament, such as Peter the Apostle, appear with beards, as does his predecessor John the Baptist. However, Western European art generally depicts John the Apostle as clean-shaven, to emphasize his relative youth. Eight of the figures portrayed in the painting entitled &quot;The Last Supper&quot; by Leonardo da Vinci are bearded. Mainstream Christians believe that Isaiah is a prophecy foretelling the Crucifixion of Jesus, and as such, as a description of Christ having his beard plucked by his tormentors.

====Eastern Christianity====
In Eastern Christianity, members of the priesthood and monastics often wear beards, and religious authorities at times have recommended or required beards for all male believers. Traditionally, Syrian Christians from Kerala wear long beards. Some view it as a necessity for men in the Malayali Syrian Christian community because icons of Christ and the saints with beards were depicted from the 3rd century onwards.

====Western Christianity====
At various times in the history of the Western world and depending on various circumstances, the Catholic Church permitted or prohibited facial hair (&quot;barbae nutritio&quot;, literally meaning &quot;nourishing a beard&quot;) for its clergymen. A decree of the beginning of the 6th century in either Carthage or the south of Gaul forbade clerics to let their hair and beards grow freely. The phrase &quot;nourishing a beard&quot; was interpreted in different ways, either as imposing a clean-shaven face or only excluding a too-lengthy beard. In relatively modern times, the first pope to wear a beard was Pope Julius II, who in 1511–12 did so for a while as a sign of mourning for the loss of the city of Bologna. Pope Clement VII let his beard grow at the time of the sack of Rome in 1527 and kept it. All his successors did so until the death in 1700 of Pope Innocent XII. Since then, no pope has worn a beard.

Beards have been associated at different dates with particular Catholic religious orders. In the 1160s Burchardus, abbot of the Cistercian monastery of Bellevaux in the Franche-Comté, wrote a treatise on beards. He regarded beards as appropriate for lay brothers, but not for the priests among the monks. In about 1240, Alberic of Trois-Fontaines described the Knights Templar as an &quot;order of bearded brethren&quot;; and, on the eve of the suppression of the order in 1312, out of nearly 230 knights and brothers questioned by the papal commissioners in Paris, 76 are described as wearing a beard (in some cases specified as &quot;in the style of the Templars&quot;), while another 133 are reported to have shaved their beards, either in renunciation of their vows or in a bid to escape detection. Randle Holme, writing in 1688, associated beards with Templars, Teutonic Knights, Austin Friars, and Gregorians. Most Latin Church clergy are now clean-shaven, but Capuchins and some others are bearded. Present Canon law is silent on the matter.

Although most Protestant Christians regard the beard as a matter of choice, some have taken the lead in fashion by openly encouraging its growth as &quot;a habit most natural, scriptural, manly, and beneficial&quot; (C. H. Spurgeon). Amish and Hutterite men shave until they marry, then grow a beard and are never thereafter without one, although it is a particular form of a beard (see Visual markers of marital status). Diarmaid MacCulloch, professor of ecclesiastical history at the University of Oxford, writes: &quot;There is no doubt that Cranmer mourned the dead king (Henry VIII)&quot;, and it was said that he showed his grief by growing a beard. However, MacCulloch also states that during the Reformation Era, many Protestant Reformers decided to grow their beards in order to emphasize their break with the Catholic tradition:


====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====

Since the mid-20th century, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has encouraged its male members to be clean-shaven, particularly those that serve in ecclesiastical leadership positions. The church&#x27;s encouragement of men&#x27;s shaving has neither scriptural nor theological basis, but stems from the general waning of facial hair&#x27;s popularity in Western society during the 20th century and its association with the hippie and drug culture aspects of the counterculture of the 1960s, and has not been a permanent rule.

After Joseph Smith, many of the early presidents of the LDS Church, such as Brigham Young and Lorenzo Snow, wore large beards. Since David O. McKay became church president in 1951, most LDS Church leaders have been clean-shaven. The church maintains no formal policy on facial hair for its general membership. However, formal prohibitions against facial hair are currently enforced for young men providing two-year missionary service. Students and staff of the church-sponsored higher education institutions, such as Brigham Young University (BYU), are required to adhere to the Church Educational System Honor Code, which states in part: &quot;Men are expected to be clean-shaven; beards are not acceptable&quot;, although male BYU students are permitted to wear a neatly groomed moustache. A beard exemption is granted for &quot;serious skin conditions&quot;, and for approved theatrical performances, but until 2015 no exemption was given for any other reason, including religious convictions. In January 2015, BYU clarified that students who want a beard for religious reasons, like Muslims or Sikhs, may be granted permission after applying for an exemption.

BYU students led a campaign to loosen the beard restrictions in 2014, but it had the opposite effect at Church Educational System schools: some who had previously been granted beard exemptions were found no longer to qualify, and for a brief period the LDS Business College required students with a registered exemption to wear a &quot;beard badge&quot;, which was likened to a &quot;badge of shame&quot;. Some students also join in with shaming their fellow beard-wearing students, even those with registered exemptions.

===Islam===
In the Quran, the Israelite patriarch Aaron is said to have had a beard (). In the &quot;ḥadīth&quot; literature, it is reported that Muhammad sported a thick beard along with long head hair that reached his shoulders.

==== Sunni ====
In Sunnī Islamic jurisprudence, there are three scholarly opinions on the beard according to the Islamic tradition (&quot;sunnah&quot;).

The first one is that growing the beard is obligatory and that shaving it is &quot;haram&quot; (forbidden) with the main source for this position being this narration: &quot;Sahih Bukhari&quot;, Book 72, Hadith #781 (USC-MSA), narrated by Ibn ʿUmar: Allah&#x27;s Apostle said, &quot;Cut the moustaches short and leave the beard (as it is).&quot;

The second one, which is the official position of the Shāfiʿī school of Islamic jurisprudence, asserts that the beard is only &quot;mustahabb&quot; (recommended), and shaving the beard is only &quot;makruh&quot; (disliked), but not &quot;haram&quot; (forbidden).

The third one among some contemporary Sunnī Muslim scholars, such as the Grand Mufti of Egypt Shawki Allam, is that keeping the beard is permissible and that shaving it is also permissible.

====Shia====
According to the Twelver denomination of Shīʿa Islam, as per &quot;sunnah&quot; custom, the length of a beard should not exceed the width of a fist. Trimming of facial hair is allowed; however, shaving it is &quot;haram&quot; (forbidden). About the permissible size of it, according to a few Shīʿīte &quot;marjiaʿ&quot; such as Seyyed Ali Khamenei, Seyyed Ali Sistani, and others, if this (its size) is &quot;ʿurfly&quot; applicable (true of) beard, it will not be &quot;haram&quot;.

===Judaism===
Talmudic tradition holds that a man may not shave his beard with a razor with a single blade, since the cutting action of the blade against the skin &quot;mars&quot; the beard. Because scissors have two blades, some opinions in &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law) permit their use to trim the beard, as the cutting action comes from contact of the two blades and not the blade against the skin. For this reason, some &quot;poskim&quot; (Jewish legal deciders) rule that Orthodox Jews may use electric razors to remain clean-shaven, as such shavers cut by trapping the hair between the blades and the metal grating, halakhically a scissor-like action. However, other &quot;poskim&quot; maintain that electric shavers constitute a razor-style action and consequently prohibit their use. The Torah forbids certain shaving practices altogether, in particular Leviticus states: &quot;You must not round off the hair at the sides of your head, or destroy the corners of your beard.&quot;
The &quot;Mishnah&quot; interprets this as a prohibition on using a razor on the beard. This prohibition is further expanded upon in the Kabbalistic literature. The prohibition carries to modern Judaism to this day, with rabbinic opinions traditionally forbidding the use of a razor to shave between the &quot;five corners of the beard&quot;—although there is no uniform consensus on where these five vertices are located. Moses Maimonides criticized the shaving of the beard as being the custom of &quot;idolatrous priests&quot;.

The &quot;Zohar&quot;, one of the primary sources of Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism), attributes Sacred to the beard, specifying that hairs of the beard symbolize channels of subconscious holy energy that flows from above to the human soul. Therefore, most Hasidic Jews, for whom Kabbalah plays an important role in their religious practice, traditionally do not remove or even trim their beards.

Traditional Jews refrain from shaving, trimming the beard, and haircuts during certain times of the year like Passover, Sukkot, the Counting of the Omer, and the Three Weeks. Cutting the hair is also restricted during the 30-day mourning period after the death of a close relative, known in Hebrew as the &quot;Shloshim&quot; (thirty).

===Hinduism===
The ancient Hindu texts regarding beards depend on the &quot;Vedas&quot; and other teachings, varying according to whom the devotee worships or follows. Many sadhus, yogis, or yoga practitioners keep beards in all stages of life. Shaivite ascetics generally have beards, as they are not permitted to own anything, which would include a razor. The beard is also a sign of a nomadic and ascetic lifestyle. Vaishnava men, typically of the ISKCON sect, are often clean-shaven as a sign of cleanliness.

===Sikhism===
Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru, commanded the Sikhs to maintain unshorn hair, recognizing it as a necessary adornment of the body as well as a mandatory Article of Faith. Sikhs consider the beard to be part of the nobility and dignity of their manhood. Sikhs also refrain from cutting their hair and beards out of respect for the God-given form. Keeping the hair uncut is &quot;kesh&quot;, one of the Five Ks, the compulsory articles of faith for a baptized Sikh. As such, a Sikh man is easily identified by his turban (&quot;dastār&quot;) and uncut hair and beard.

===Rastafari movement===
Male Rastafarians wear uncut hair and beards in conformity with injunctions given in the Old Testament of the Christian Bible, such as Leviticus , which reads: &quot;They shall not make any baldness on their heads, nor shave off the edges of their beards, nor make any cuts in their flesh.&quot; The beard is a symbol of the covenant between God (Jah or Jehovah in Rastafari usage) and his people.

==Modern prohibition==

===Civilian prohibitions===
Professional airline pilots are required to be shaven to facilitate a tight seal with auxiliary oxygen masks. However, some airlines have recently lifted such bans in light of modern studies. Similarly, firefighters may also be prohibited from full beards to obtain a proper seal with SCBA equipment. Other jobs may prohibit beards as necessary to wear masks or respirators.

Isezaki city in Gunma prefecture, Japan, decided to ban beards for male municipal employees on 19 May 2010.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has found requiring shaving to be discriminatory.

====Sports====
The International Boxing Association prohibits the wearing of beards by amateur boxers, although the Amateur Boxing Association of England allows exceptions for Sikh men, on condition that the beard be covered with a fine net.

The Cincinnati Reds baseball team had a longstanding enforced policy where all players had to be completely clean-shaven (no beards, long sideburns or moustaches). However, this policy was abolished following the sale of the team by Marge Schott in 1999.

Under owner George Steinbrenner, the New York Yankees baseball team had a strict appearance policy that prohibited long hair and facial hair below the lip; the regulation was continued under Hank and Hal Steinbrenner when control of the Yankees was transferred to them after the . Willie Randolph and Joe Girardi, both former Yankee assistant coaches, adopted a similar clean-shaven policy for their ballclubs: the New York Mets and Miami Marlins, respectively. Fredi Gonzalez, who replaced Girardi as the Marlins&#x27; manager, dropped that policy when he took over after the 2006 season. Yankees legend Don Mattingly restored said policy upon becoming Marlins manager in 2016, but dropped it immediately after only one season.

The Playoff beard is a tradition common with teams in the National Hockey League, and now in other leagues where players allow their beards to grow from the beginning of the playoff season until the playoffs are over for their team. Even then, players such as Joe Thornton and Brent Burns grew large, bushy beards in the regular season. However, executive Lou Lamoriello became notorious for his enforcement of an appearance policy similar to the Yankees during his front office tenures with the New Jersey Devils, the Toronto Maple Leafs and the New York Islanders. Lamoriello would allow players to grow beards during the playoffs, however.

In 2008, some members of the Tyrone Gaelic football team vowed not to shave until the end of the season. They went on to win the All-Ireland football championship, some of them sporting impressive beards by that stage.

Canadian Rugby Union flanker Adam Kleeberger attracted much media attention before, during, and after the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand. Kleeberger was known, alongside teammates Jebb Sinclair and Hubert Buydens as one of &quot;the beardoes&quot;. Fans in the stands could often be seen wearing fake beards and &quot;fear the beard&quot; became a popular expression during the team&#x27;s run in the competition. Kleeberger, who became one of Canada&#x27;s star players in the tournament, later used the publicity surrounding his beard to raise awareness for two causes; Christchurch earthquake relief efforts and prostate cancer. As part of this fundraising, his beard was shaved off by television personality Rick Mercer and aired on national television. The &quot;Fear the Beard&quot; expression was coined by the NBA&#x27;s Oklahoma City Thunder fans and was previously used by Houston Rockets fans to support James Harden.
San Francisco Giants relief pitcher Brian Wilson, who claims not to have shaved since the 2010 All-Star Game, has grown a big beard that has become popular in MLB and with its fans. MLB Fan Cave presented a &quot;Journey Inside Brian Wilson&#x27;s Beard&quot;, which was an interactive screenshot of Wilson&#x27;s beard, where one can click on different sections to see various fictional activities performed by small &quot;residents&quot; of the beard. The hosts on sports show sometimes wear replica beards, and the Giants gave them away to fans as a promo.

The 2013 Boston Red Sox featured at least 12 players with varying degrees of facial hair, ranging from the closely trimmed beard of slugger David Ortiz to the long shaggy looks of Jonny Gomes and Mike Napoli. The Red Sox used their beards as a marketing tool, offering a Dollar Beard Night, where all fans with beards (real or fake) could buy a ticket for $1.00; and also as means of fostering team camaraderie.

Beards have also become a source of competition between athletes. Examples of athlete &quot;beard-offs&quot; include NBA players DeShawn Stevenson and Drew Gooden in 2008, and WWE wrestler Daniel Bryan and Oakland Athletics outfielder Josh Reddick in 2013.

===Armed forces===

Depending on the country and period, facial hair was either prohibited in the army or an integral part of the uniform.

==In animals==
The term &quot;beard&quot; is also used for a collection of stiff, hairlike feathers on the centre of the breast of turkeys. Normally, the turkey&#x27;s beard remains flat and may be hidden under other feathers, but when the bird is displaying, the beard becomes erect and protrudes several centimetres from the breast.

Many goats possess a beard. The orangutan also possesses a beard.

Several animals are termed &quot;bearded&quot; as part of their common name. Sometimes a beard of hair on the chin or face is prominent but for some others, &quot;beard&quot; may refer to a pattern or colouring of the pelage reminiscent of a beard.

<text>Route 67 is a short state highway entirely within the community of Fort Lee in Bergen County, New Jersey. It is part of the original alignment of U.S. Route 9W (US 9W). The road runs from an intersection with Central Boulevard in Fort Lee (also designated as Route 5) up Palisade Avenue in downtown Fort Lee. There it becomes known as Lemoine Avenue, terminating at an interchange with US 9W, the Palisades Interstate Parkway and Route 445S in Fort Lee. The route was designated originally as a portion of State Highway Route 18N in 1923, and was split up in 1929 as part of present-day Route 63, US 9W and Route 67 for Routes S-1, 1 and Route S1A. Route S-1-A remained intact on Palisades and Lemoine Avenue until the 1953 state highway renumbering when it was switched over to Route 67. The route has remained virtually intact since.

==Route description==

Route 67 begins at an intersection with New Jersey Route 5 in the community of Fort Lee. The route heads northward as Palisade Avenue, crossing on a small interchange past commercial businesses and residential homes. The highway continues, crossing directly as the main road in the community, and passing through a large residential district. Route 67 begins to turn northeastward, passing to the west of several cliffside apartment high rises and the local tennis courts. The high-rises and residential homes continue to surrounded the highway for a distance, until reaching a fork in the highway with Lemoine Avenue. There, Palisade Avenue forks to the right while Route 67 heads to the left along Lemoine. After the fork, the highway becomes more residential and commercial, with the cliffside high-rises following Palisade Avenue to the east. A short distance, Route 67 forks again with Schlosser Street, intersecting with County Route 12 (Main Street).
Route 67 and Lemoine Avenue continues northward as a four-lane boulevard through Fort Lee, reaching Bridge Plaza, which serves commercial industry around the George Washington Bridge. The route then crosses over Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1, 9 and 46 as a three-lane truss bridge. After crossing the highways, Route 67 and Lemoine Avenue continue northward out of Bridge Plaza and returns as a four-lane local boulevard in the middle of high-rises and residential homes. Route 67 passes the local high school before reaching an interchange with U.S. Route 9W, the Palisades Interstate Parkway (Route 445) and Route 445S (the Fort Lee Spur), where the designation ends. Lemoine Avenue continues northward as U.S. Route 9W.

==History==

The alignment of Route 67 originates as a portion of State Highway Route 18N, a state highway that survived the 1927 state highway renumbering from its commissioning in 1923. State Highway Route 18N lasted only two years after the 1927 renumbering, being designed as part of State Highway Route S-1 and State Highway Route 1 and State Highway Route S-1-A, which was designated along current Route 67 as a spur of Route S-1. State Highway Route S-1-A remained intact until the second state highway renumbering on January 1, 1953, when it was re-designated as Route 67. The alignment of Route 67 has remained virtually untouched since the 1953 renumbering. On December 8, 1977, the New Jersey Department of Transportation approved a measure that Route 67 in downtown Fort Lee was declared a No Passing Zone.

<text>Route 68 is a state highway located in Burlington County in the U.S. state of New Jersey, serving as the main connector between the New Jersey Turnpike and the Fort Dix entity of Joint Base McGuire–Dix–Lakehurst (JB MDL). It runs from County Route 616 (CR 616) inside Fort Dix to U.S. Route 206 (US 206) in Mansfield Township, south of the New Jersey Turnpike; a total route length of . The route passes through Wrightstown and Springfield Township as a two-lane undivided road, crossing CR 537. It continues through Mansfield Township as a four-lane divided highway, intersecting with CR 543. Outside of ASA Fort Dix, Route 68 passes through mostly agricultural and residential areas.

The route was originally designated as Route S39 in 1941, a spur of Route 39 (present-day US 206) that was to provide improved access to Fort Dix during World War II. In 1953, Route S39 became Route 68 and it was legislated to extend south of Fort Dix to the Four Mile Circle with Route 70 and Route 72. A freeway for Route 68 was proposed to run between a planned Route 38 freeway and the Four Mile Circle in 1960; however, it was never built.

==Route description==

Route 68 begins at General Circle (inaccessible to the general public) with CR 616 on the grounds of the Fort Dix entity of JB MDL in New Hanover Township, heading to the north as a four-lane divided highway called Fort Dix Road. After passing through the Main Gate to Fort Dix and heading east of the Visitor Center for Fort Dix, the road continues through public areas of the military installation and crosses into Wrightstown, where it narrows into a two-lane undivided road before heading into Springfield Township. The route exits JB MDL at its intersection with CR 670 and upon leaving the military base, it heads through a mix of farmland and woodland. Route 68 crosses CR 537 before continuing north into agricultural areas with some homes.
The road enters Mansfield Township where it widens into a four-lane divided highway as it intersects a road that provides access to parallel CR 545 to the east, which heads south to serve as an access road to McGuire Air Force Base. From here, the route turns northwest and crosses CR 543 before heading through a mix of farm fields and suburban residential neighborhoods. Past the intersection with White Pine Road, Route 68 passes in between two large auto auction lots. The route terminates at an intersection with US 206 located a short distance south of that route&#x27;s interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95). Route 68 serves as the main access route between Fort Dix and the New Jersey Turnpike.

==History==

As part of improving road access to the Fort Dix Military Reservation at the onset of World War II, a Works Progress Administration project improved the paved road connecting the fort to Bordentown. In 1941, this road was legislated as Route S39, a state highway spur of Route 39 (now US 206) that was to run from the fort to Mansfield Square. Construction on the access road was completed in 1943 at a cost of over $2 million. Route S39 became Route 68 in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. The same year, an extension of Route 68 was legislated to run south from Fort Dix to the intersection with Route 70 and Route 72 at the Four Mile Circle. In 1961, a freeway was proposed along the Route 68 corridor, running from a planned Route 38 freeway near Fort Dix south to Route 70 and Route 72; however, this was never built.

<text>Banks Peninsula () is a peninsula of volcanic origin on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand. It has an area of approximately and encompasses two large harbours and many smaller bays and coves. The South Island&#x27;s largest city, Christchurch, is immediately north of the peninsula.

== Geology ==

Banks Peninsula forms the most prominent volcanic feature of the South Island, similar to — but more than twice as large as — the older Dunedin volcano (Otago Peninsula and Harbour) to the southwest. Geologically, the peninsula comprises the eroded remnants of two large (Lyttelton formed first, then Akaroa), and the smaller Mt Herbert Volcanic Group. These formed due to intraplate volcanism between approximately eleven and eight million years ago (Miocene) on a continental crust. The peninsula formed as offshore islands, with the volcanoes reaching to about 1,500 m above sea level. Two dominant craters formed Lyttelton and Akaroa Harbours.

The Canterbury Plains formed from the erosion of the Southern Alps (an extensive and high mountain range caused by the meeting of the Indo-Australian and Pacific tectonic plates) and from the alluvial fans created by large braided rivers. These plains reach their widest point where they meet the hilly sub-region of Banks Peninsula. A layer of loess, a rather unstable fine silt deposited by the foehn winds which bluster across the plains, covers the northern and western flanks of the peninsula. The portion of crater rim lying between Lyttelton Harbour / Whakaraupō and Christchurch city forms the Port Hills.

== Prehistory ==
According to tradition the first Māori settlers of the area now known as Banks Peninsula were the Waitaha led by their founding ancestor Rākaihautū. The Māori name for the peninsula is Te Pātaka o Rākaihautū (The Storehouse of Rākaihautū) in recognition of his deeds and the abundance of mahinga kai (foods of the forests, sea, rivers and skies). They were followed by Kāti Māmoe, and then the Ngāi Tahu hapū Ngāi Tūhaitara, who arrived in the 1730s.

== History ==
The first European sighting of the peninsula was on 17 February 1770 by Captain James Cook and crew during Cook&#x27;s first circumnavigation of New Zealand. Cook described the land as &quot;of a circular figure ... of a very broken uneven surface and [having] more the appearance of barrenness than fertility.&quot; Deceived by the outline of higher land behind the peninsula, Cook mistook it for an island and named it &quot;Banks Island&quot; in honour of ″s botanist, Joseph Banks. Distracted by a phantom sighting of land to the southeast, Cook then ordered &quot;Endeavour&quot; away to the south without exploring more closely.

In 1809, Captain Samuel Chase, in the sealer &quot;Pegasus&quot;, corrected Cook&#x27;s charts by determining that &quot;Banks Island&quot; was in fact a peninsula. His first officer, William Stewart, charted this area of the coast. Pegasus Bay is named after their vessel.

In 1830, the Māori settlement at Takapūneke was sacked, and the local Ngāi Tahu chief, Tama-i-hara-nui captured, by Ngāti Toa chief, Te Rauparaha, with the assistance of the captain of the British brig &quot;Elizabeth,&quot; John Stewart. It was partly as a result of this massacre that the British authorities sent James Busby, as official British Resident, to New Zealand in 1832.

During the 1830s, several European whaling bases were established on Banks Peninsula. In 1838 Captain Jean François Langlois, a French whaler, decided that Akaroa would make a good settlement to service whaling ships and made a provisional purchase of land in &quot;the greater Banks Peninsula&quot; from 12 Kāi Tahu chiefs. A deposit of commodities in the value of £6 was paid and a further £234 worth of commodities was to be paid at a later period. He returned to France, advertised for settlers to go to New Zealand, and ceded his interest in the land to the Nanto-Bordelaise Company, of which he became a part-owner. On 9 March 1840 he set sail for New Zealand with a group of French and German families aboard the ship , with the intention of forming a French colony on a French South Island of New Zealand. By the time Langlois and his colonists arrived at Banks Peninsula in August 1840, many Māori had already signed the Treaty of Waitangi (the signatories including two chiefs at Akaroa in May) and New Zealand&#x27;s first British Governor, William Hobson, had declared British sovereignty over the whole of New Zealand. On hearing of the French plan for colonisation, Hobson quickly dispatched HMS &quot;Britomart&quot; from the Bay of Islands to Akaroa with police magistrates on board. While Langlois and his colonists sheltered from unfavourable winds at Pigeon Bay on the other side of the peninsula, the British raised their flag at Greens Point between Akaroa and Takapūneke and courts of law convened to assert British sovereignty over the South Island. The French colonists arrived in Akaroa Harbour on 18 August and established a settlement centred on the present-day site of Akaroa. Given that the French colonists had set out for New Zealand on the assumption that they owned the land, the New Zealand authorities made a grant of 30,000 acres to the Nanto-Bordelaise Company, which ceded all rights to the peninsula for £4,500.

During the 1840s, the peninsula and the Canterbury Plains beyond were considered for colonisation, but it took until 1848 for the Canterbury Association chief surveyor, Captain Joseph Thomas to survey the surrounding plains and prepare for the arrival of the Canterbury pilgrims in December 1850.

From the 1850s, Lyttelton and then Christchurch outgrew Akaroa, which is now a holiday resort and cruise ship destination and has retained many French influences as well as many of its nineteenth-century buildings.

Historic harbour defence works dating from 1874 onwards survive at Ripapa Island in Lyttelton Harbour / Whakaraupō, and at Awaroa / Godley Head.

The Christchurch earthquakes of February 2011 and June 2011 had their epicentres in the Port Hills, significantly affecting communities.

== Economy ==
=== Fisheries ===
Several sites off the coast of the peninsula serve for mariculture cultivation of mussels.

=== Farming ===
Farming has been a traditional industry on Banks Peninsula.

=== Tourism ===
Following the major earthquakes of 2010 and 2011, which affected Christchurch and Lyttelton (the harbour serving Christchurch), cruise ships were diverted to Akaroa Harbour.

== Summit Road ==
The Summit Road forms a notable feature on the peninsula. The road included portions of the early tracks that were built to move cattle around (e.g. the 15 mile track from Akaroa to Pigeon Bay completed in 1844). Much of the construction was completed in the 1880s with more work carried out in the 1930s, the road is in two sections (both of which have views of the area, as well as parks, walkways, and other recreational features):
* one section runs along the crest of the Port Hills from Awaroa / Godley Head (the northern head of Lyttelton Harbour / Whakaraupō) to Gebbies Pass at the head of the harbour.
* the other section runs around the crater rim of Akaroa Harbour from &#x27;Hill Top&#x27; – the junction with the main Christchurch-Akaroa highway – to a point above Akaroa.

== Conservation ==
Estimates suggest that native forest once covered 98% of the peninsula. However, Māori and European settlers successively denuded the forest cover and less than 2% remains today, although some reforestation has started. European settlers have planted many English trees, notably walnut.

=== Hinewai Reserve ===
Hinewai Reserve, a private nature reserve, has been established on the peninsula to allow for native forest to regenerate on land that was once farmed. It was established in 1987 and now spans 1250 hectares of native bush. it has 40 km of walking tracks through the native bush.

Other protected areas on the peninsula include Ellangowan Scenic Reserve (3.14 km2), designated in 1973, Mount Herbert Scenic Reserve (2.42 km2), designated in 1980, Wairewa Stewardship Area (6.51 km2), designated in 1987, and Palm Gully Scenic Reserve (1.11 km2), designated in 1989.

=== Marine Reserves ===
A large Marine Mammal Sanctuary, mainly restricting set-net fishing, surrounds much of the peninsula. This has the principal aim of the conservation of Hector&#x27;s dolphin, the smallest of all dolphin species. Eco-tourism based around the playful dolphins has now become a significant industry in Akaroa.

The Banks Peninsula Marine Mammal Sanctuary was expanded in 2020, with restrictions introduced on seismic surveying and seabed mining. The sanctuary stretches from the Jed River south to the Waitaki River, and extends 20 nautical miles out to sea, covering an area of about 14,310 km2.

The relatively small Pōhatu Marine Reserve centres on Pōhatu / Flea Bay on the south-east side of the peninsula and the larger Akaroa Marine Reserve lies at the entrance to the Akaroa Harbour.

=== Rod Donald Banks Peninsula Trust ===
The Rod Donald Banks Peninsula Trust aims to improve public walking and biking access and enhance biodiversity on Banks Peninsula.

They (in 2020) are raising money to purchase 500ha of land including the summits of Mt Herbert/Te Ahu Pātiki and Mt Bradley with the intention to set up a conservation park protecting and restoring native biodiversity. The land is currently farmland but over time the trust intends to return it to native bush. In May 2021, the money was raised to purchase the land. The Rod Donald Banks Peninsula Trust plans to upgrade fencing and remove feral grazing animals.

The Rod Donald Banks Peninsula Trust are also involved in developing Te Ara Pātaka, also known as the Summit Walkway. They have also been involved in providing tramping huts (Rod Donald Hut and Ōtamahua Hut on Ōtamahua / Quail Island) for the public to access.

=== Banks Peninsula Conservation Trust ===
Banks Peninsula Conservation Trust was formed in 2001. It works to conserve and enhance the biodiversity and encourage sustainable land management on Banks Peninsula. Work being undertaken in 2020 included work to protect ruru (morepork) and tūī. They also work with landowners to legally protect important biodiversity and landscape values in perpetuity through covenants.

== Demographics ==
Banks Peninsula Ward of Christchurch City Council, which encompasses the area south of the Port Hills, covers .
Banks Peninsula Ward had a population of 8,850 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 615 people (7.5%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 684 people (8.4%) since the 2006 census.

== Towns ==
=== Akaroa ===
Akaroa is a small town on the edge of the Akaroa harbour.

=== Little River ===
Little River is a small town which sits at the end of the Little River Rail Trail. There are several art galleries, a camp ground, rugby club and primary school there. Wairewa.

=== Wainui ===
Wainui is a settlement of mostly holiday houses on the Akaroa harbour.

Wainui can mean &#x27;big water&#x27; or &#x27;big river&#x27; or &#x27;big bay&#x27;. Wainui was once home to a large Ngāti Māmoe settlement. Wainui has important associations for Ngāi Tahu as the bay was then claimed by Te Ruahikihiki for Ngāi Tahu. He made his claim when he landed at Wainui and dug for fern roots there. (This was one of the many traditional ways to claim land). In Ngāi Tahu legend, Tuhiraki (Mt Bossu) which lies behind Wainui, is the resting place of the kō (digging stick) of Rakaihautū. He used this digging stick to dig out many of the South Island lakes.

In 1856, the Wainui Māori Reserve was established and set aside 432 acres for the Ngāi Tarewa Hapū of Ngāi Tahu. In the 1857 census, there was 40 people living there but by 1861, this had declined to 20 people.

A post office was established in 1874, telephone office in 1875, school in 1885 and Presbyterian Church in 1911.

=== Duvauchelle ===
Duvauchelle is a small town which sits at the head of the Akaroa harbour.

===Diamond Harbour===
Diamond Harbour is on Banks Peninsula.

== Bays ==

The inland valleys of the Port Hills known as McCormacks Bay and Moncks Bay are bays of the Avon Heathcote Estuary, rather that coastal bays of Banks Peninsula. Working around the coast from north to south one encounters:

=== Sumner Bay ===
Sumner Bay marks the coastal transition from the long sandy beach of Pegasus Bay and the lowlands of the Canterbury Plains to the rocky cliffs of Banks Peninsula. While Sumner is politically and socially considered a suburb of Christchurch, the high Clifton cliffs and the post of volcanic rock on the beach, known locally as Rapanui, or Shag Rock, mark the place where the coastal plains meet the peninsula.

=== Taylors Mistake ===
Taylors Mistake is a Christchurch swimming beach with a number of holiday houses lining the bay. Originally, it was known as Vincent&#x27;s Bay as a result of a Captain John Vincent wrecking his schooner in the bay. It became known as Taylors Mistake in 1853 after another ship wreck in the bay. This time, a Captain Samuel Taylor wrecked his cutter named &quot;Hawk&quot; at night time. Taylors Mistake is known as Te One-poto in Māori.

=== Lyttelton Harbour / Whakaraupō ===
Lyttelton Harbour / Whakaraupō is a harbour within Banks Peninsula. Within the harbour lies Ōtamahua / Quail Island and Ripapa Island.

=== Port Levy ===
Port Levy is the most north facing of the bays on Banks Peninsula. It has been visited by Europeans since the 1820s and known as Koukourarata in Māori.

=== Pigeon Bay ===
Pigeon Bay has a walking track which follows the eastern side of Pigeon bay out to the head of the bay. It takes about 4 or 5 hours to walk there and back. It has spectacular coastal views. There are a number of holiday homes in Pigeon bay as well as a yacht club and a camping ground. Pigeon Bay most likely gained its name from early whalers seeing the large number of pigeons (kererū) in the forests of Pigeon Bay. The first reference to Pigeon Bay was in 1836.

Captain Langlois celebrated his &quot;purchase&quot; of Banks Peninsula on 9 August 1840 by raising the French flag and conducting a 101 gun salute at Pigeon Bay.

HMS &quot;Britomart&quot; visited Pigeon Bay towards the end of August 1840 conducting the first hydrographic survey and reinforcing British sovereignty of Banks Peninsula.

=== Little Akaloa ===
Little Akaloa is named &quot;little&quot; to distinguish it from Akaroa. It was spelt Hakaroa until 1864. Feral goats have been a problem in Little Akaloa but a successful cull of them in early 2019 is helping eradication efforts on Banks Peninsula.

A moonfish (150 cm long) washed up on the beach at Little Akaloa in 2013. They are more commonly found further north.

Farming around Little Akaloa is a mainstay of the economy. with accommodation providers being a second. Camping at the Little Akaloa Domain is popular in summer. The beach has a boat ramp.

=== Okains Bay ===
Okains Bay has a holiday camp ground and a large sandy beach.

=== Le Bons Bay ===
Le Bons Bay has a large often empty beach. There is a small settlement of holiday houses. It is surrounded by rolling hills. A river empties into the sea where New Zealand Fur Seals often frolic. First known as Bones bay in 1845, it became known as Le Bons Bay. It is suggested that this was either that a French settler named Le Bon lived there, or that early French settlers called it &quot;The good bay&quot; or that it is a corruption of Bones bay.

John Cuff and William Cudden established a timber mill in Le Bons Bay in 1857. By 1878, the population of Le Bons Bay reached 237. At this stage, the timber had all been milled and the timber mill was moved to Hickory Bay until 1886.

=== Hickory Bay ===
Hickory Bay is known as having a beach that provides good surfing. It is east facing. It is known in Māori as Waikerikikari, the Bay of Angry Waters, and was never permanently settled by Māori.

The Ellangowan Scenic Reserve walk is located just below the Summit road in Hickory Bay.

=== Goughs Bay ===

Goughs Bay was home to a pā in the 1820s with around 100 people living there. The residents were fugitives from the Kai Huānga feud. In 1830 the pā was attacked by Te Maiharanui and again in 1832 by Te Rauparaha’s raiding parties.

Goughs Bay is most likely named after a whaler, Walter Gough, who was put ashore at the bay in 1836 after an attempted mutiny on the whaling barque &quot;Australian.&quot; He lived there in the Māori community for many years. Goughs Bay was first referenced in 1858 when Elie Bauriaud, who originally arrived on the &quot;Comte de Paris&quot;, purchased land there.

Goughs Bay is a surfing location with an exposed beach break that provides consistent surf throughout the year.

In 2021, funding was put aside to protect and fence the upper Goughs Bay stream catchment. The aims were to exclude stock, allow native bush to regenerate and improve the water quality. Mataī and tōtara trees will be protected as well as a range of native animals.

A significant rain storm in December 2021 caused damage to the access road to Goughs Bay, with a number of slips making the road impassable. Five weeks later, the road was still closed because of the 34 slips blocking the access road. A report into the Christchurch City Council response to the damage caused by the storm highlighted areas for improvement in how the Christchurch City Council responds to emergencies.

=== Ōtanerito Bay ===
Home to a Ngāti Māmoe pā (known as Parakākāriki) and an ancient Māori burial ground, Ōtanerito Bay possibly means &quot;the place of Tane, the fertile one&quot;. Home to the Hinewai reserve since 1987. Ōtanerito Bay also formed part of the Banks Track until 2017.

=== Flea Bay / Pōhatu ===
Pōhatu / Flea Bay has large colonies of penguins and seals living there, It is home to the Pōhatu Marine Reserve. The Marine Reserve is home to many fish species including triplefins, lumpfish, moki, butterfish, spotties, banded wrasse, blue cod, leather jackets, lobsters, pāua and rockfish.

=== Akaroa Harbour ===
Akaroa Harbour is one of the two large harbours on Banks Peninsula. The other being Lyttelton Harbour / Whakaraupō.

=== Peraki Bay ===
Peraki Bay is one of the bigger bays on the south west coast of Banks Peninsula. Multiple spellings of Peraki have existed. It was home to a whaling station in the 1830s and 1840s.

=== Tumbledown Bay/Te Kāio ===
Tumbledown Bay is considered one of the best beaches near Christchurch. Most people are put off by the drive to get there, hence it is usually very quiet. Tumbledown bay has supported a large Māori population in pre-European times. Numerous archaeological digs have uncovered artefacts including tool fragments, fish hooks, oven stones and seal, Kurī (dog), tuatara, penguin, kiwi, kererū and moa remains in the middens.

Tumbledown bay, was named as a result of the actions of Billy Simpson, who working on sailing boats in the area as early as 1836. He was instructed to collect a case of alcohol from a local whaling station. On his return, he sat down in the bay and had a drink or two. On getting up he succeeded in allowing all the bottles to tumble down the hillside and break hence the naming. The earliest reference to the name of Tumbledown bay occurred in 1842.

There are two small islets at the entrance of the bay named Jachin and Boaz (after the pillars to the Temple of Solomon). These were thought to have been named by Bishop George Selwyn.

In 1911, the &quot;Bell Flower&quot; (a 98 ton schooner) was wrecked on the cliffs next to Tumbledown Bay.

=== Te Oka Bay ===
=== Magnet Bay ===
Magnet Bay is known as a spot to go surfing. It has an exposed reef and point break. These provide reasonably consistent surf all year around. The bay is known in Māori as Makara and a pa existed in the bay at one stage. Magnet Bay is named after the &quot;Magnet&quot;, a 148-ton barque that was shipwrecked in the bay on 3 September 1844. It was sailing under the charge of a Captain Lewis who was travelling from Wellington to Waikouaiti. One person lost their life in the shipwreck.

== Mountains ==
Banks Peninsula includes numerous hills or mountains. Named peaks over 700 metres high include:

Mount Herbert / Te Ahu Pātiki is the tallest point on Banks Peninsula at .

Mt Bradley, the second tallest peak on Banks Peninsula at 855m was named after Reginald Robert Bradley who farmed at Charteris Bay from 1858 and also was the vicar of the Parish of Governors Bay and Purau. His oldest son, Orton Bradley, took over the farm which became Orton Bradley Park after his death in 1943.

Mt Sinclair at 841m was named after Captain Francis Sinclair who lived at Holmes Bay. He drowned in 1846 when sailing from Banks Peninsula to Wellington in his schooner &quot;Jessie Millar&quot;. In Māori, Mt Sinclair is known as Tarawera.

Saddle Hill (841m) befits its descriptive name. The French settlers named it Pitou Comete and the Māori named it Puwaitaha or Ka Mokaikai. Near the summit is a spring known as Te Wai-o-hine-puariari

Mt Fitzgerald (826 metres) overlooks Holmes Bay. It is named after William Fitzgerald who arrived at Pigeon Bay in 1861 and taught at the Pigeon Bay Academy until 1869.

Flag Peak (809 metres)

Stony Bay Peak (806 metres)

Brasenose (785 metres)

View Hill (762 metres)

High Bare Peak (756 metres)

Lavericks (755 metres) and Lavericks Bay could have been named after several people. George Laverick was an early settler in the area. It could also have been named after Captain Laverick of the schooner &quot;Lookin&quot; which supplied provisions to Akaroa and the Peninsula in the early 1840s. A third explanation is that it was named after Charlie Laveroux, a Frenchman who ended up marooned at the bay by bad weather during a hunting trip. The Māori name for the peak is Ōtepatotu.

Duvauchelle Peak (738 metres) and the town of Duvauchelle were named after the Duvauchelle brothers who arrived in 1840 at Akaroa. They ran a store in Akaroa before departing for South Pacific Islands in 1843.

Mt Evans (703 metres) was named at some point between 1849 and 1850 after First Lieutenant Frederick Evans of the survey paddleship HMS &quot;Acheron&quot;.

== Walking tracks ==
=== Banks Track ===
The Banks Track is a 31 km circular route that starts in Akaroa and visits Flea Bay, Stony Bay and Hinewai Reserve.

=== Te Ara Pātaka (Summit walkway) ===

The Te Ara Pātaka (Summit walkway) is a three day tramp that can start at multiple places. The longest routes start either at Gebbies Pass or Kaituna Valley and go to Sign of the Packhorse Hut on the first day. On the second day, trampers follow a track crossing just below Mount Bradley (855 metres) and then ascend Mount Herbert (919 metres) before descending to the Port Levy Saddle. From here it is a short walk to the second overnight stay at Rod Donald Hut. The third day takes in Mount Fitzgerald (826 metres) and Mount Sinclair (841 metres). The track then descends past a 2000 year old giant tōtara in Montgomery Park Scenic Reserve before finishing near the Hilltop tavern on state highway 75.

== Le Race ==

The annual 100 km road cycling race from Cathedral Square in Christchurch to Akaroa traverses Banks Peninsula. The course climbs up Dyers Pass road, follows the summit road along the Port Hills before descending Gebbies Pass to State highway 75. It then ascends to Hilltop before turning off and following the summit road, climbing Duvauchelle peak and descending Long Bays Road into Akaroa. It has been won by three times by Mark Bailey and Michael Vink, twice by Jeremy Yates and Daniel Whitehouse. Hayden Roulston (2016) and Brian Fowler (2005 ) have also won it. In the women&#x27;s competition Jo Buick, Reta Trotman and Sharlotte Lucas have all won it three times.

<text>Nielson Field (Luzon, the Philippines) was the location of the Far East Air Force headquarters. Most of the aircraft of the FEAF were based at either Clark Field or Nichols Field. The cultural site was an &quot;Honourable Mention&quot; in the 2001 UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Awards.

== Laurie Reuben Nielson ==
Laurie Reuben Nielson was one of the many foreigners attracted by the business opportunities in the Philippines and moved to the country before World War II. Born in New Zealand, Nielson and his American wife, Annette, arrived in Manila in the early-to-mid-1930s. He established himself in local business, setting up his own firm, L. R. Nielson &amp; Company, and making inroads in the securities and stock brokerage business, importing, and mining. Nielson also sat on the board of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation branch in Manila.

Nielson was an avid aviation enthusiast; with this, he became involved in a project to build an aviation school and airport in Manila. It was an ideal time for pursuing the project because there was a real need for an airport to support the increased economic activity in the country, especially in the mining industry, at the same time, the Quezon government was encouraging infrastructure projects. Nielson convinced several other Manila-based foreign investors to join him in the project and construction of the airport proceeded after the group leased of land in Makati from Ayala y Compañía. When it was inaugurated in July 1937, the Nielson Airport was being touted as the biggest and best-equipped in Asia.

After the outbreak of the war and the invasion of Manila by Japanese forces in 1942, Nielson and his family were detained by the Japanese authorities. Nielson&#x27;s wife and two sons were brought to the internment camp at the University of Santo Tomas. Nielson, because he was British, was taken for internment in British Hong Kong (present-day Hong Kong). Nielson was never seen or heard from again.

By the time the Philippines was liberated from the Japanese, Nielson&#x27;s businesses and most of his properties were all gone. After his wife and two sons left the Philippines and returned to the United States for good, Nielson&#x27;s only remaining legacy to the Philippines was the airport he had built.

== Nielson Airport ==

The property on which the airport stood was part of the Hacienda San Pedro de Macati owned by the Zóbel de Ayala family, then in the province of Rizal. The hacienda encompassed most of what is now the city of Makati. When Enrique Zóbel de Ayala, then senior managing partner at Ayala y Compañía (present-day Ayala Corporation) and a special aide to President Manuel L. Quezon, found out about the Nielson group&#x27;s proposal to the government to build an airport on a turnkey basis, he immediately offered a portion of the hacienda as a possible site for the facility. It was an ideal location for the airport because Makati was then just a sparsely populated town adjacent to Manila. The site was located on a hard tract of land jutting from rice fields, clearly visible from the air, allowing clear approaches from all sides.

The Nielson Airport became the base of the American Far Eastern School of Aviation. More importantly, with the introduction of commercial air services at the airport, it became the primary gateway between Manila and the rest of the country and, later, between the Philippines and the world. The Philippine Aerial Taxi Company (PATCO), the first airline company in the Philippines, and the Iloilo-Negros Air Express Company, the first Filipino-owned commercial passenger airline, started operating from the Nielson Airport. When Philippine Air Lines was established, its very first flight took off in March 1941 from the Nielson Airport for Baguio.

As a response to the expansionist policy of Japan, authorities in the Philippines set up the Far East Air Force (FEAF) headquarters at the Nielson Airport. Commercial flights at the airport were halted in October 1941 and the private carriers were asked to relocate their services to make room for the U.S. Army Air Forces.

When Japanese planes attacked the Philippines on December 8, 1941, the planes were actually spotted by a radar station in Northern Luzon, which immediately alerted the FEAF headquarters at Nielson. Unfortunately, by the time FEAF officers were finally able to get through to Clark Air Base in Pampanga, it was already too late and Japanese bombs were already dropping on Clark. By December 9, Nielson Airport was also under siege. After the Americans and Filipinos were forced to retreat from the Philippines and the Japanese occupation forces took over, the latter sequestered Nielson and turned the airport&#x27;s radio tower and passenger terminal into a headquarters. When Manila was liberated, the Americans and the Filipinos were again able to wrest control of the airport from the Japanese. The partially damaged airport and its facilities were fully restored and commercial air services, including international flights, resumed in 1946.

In 1948, when the airport ceased operations in Makati to relocate to its present site adjacent to Nichols Field (now Villamor Air Base) in Pasay, ownership of the airport&#x27;s permanent facilities reverted to the owner of the land, Ayala y Compañía. Although the runways were eventually converted into roads – the secondary runway (runway 07/25) became Paseo de Roxas and the primary runway (runway 12/30) became Ayala Avenue – and other airport structures were sacrificed to give way to the development of the Makati business and commercial district, the owners preserved the airport&#x27;s passenger terminal and control tower, which came to be known as the Nielson Tower.

== Nielson Tower ==
In the succeeding years, various uses were found for the Nielson Tower, a two-story concrete structure designed to resemble an airplane from a bird&#x27;s-eye view. At one point, it served as the headquarters of a police detachment. It also housed the offices of the Ayala-owned Integrated Property Management Corporation for several years.

From the late 1970s up to April 1994, a group of Filipino investors leased the tower for a semi-private, first-class club and restaurant, as it is opposite The Peninsula Manila hotel. In 1996, after almost two years of renovation work, the Nielson Tower became the home of the Filipinas Heritage Library before its transfer to the Ayala Museum. In 2014, Nielson Tower became the home of an upscale restaurant and bar called Blackbird, which uses the former controlroom as its upper dining floor.

==History==

===Origins===
Camp Nichols was established by the Air Service, United States Army in 1919. Located near Fort William McKinley, south of Manila, it initially was the home of the 1st Group (Observation), being activated on 14 August 1919, Nichols Field became the headquarters of the Philippine Department Air Force, under the Army Philippine Department.

The 1st Group (later 4th Composite Group) consisted of the 2d, 3d and 28th Aero Squadrons in 1919. The 2d Aero Squadron (2d Observation Squadron), having served in the Philippines beginning in 1915, was transferred back from Rockwell Field, California in 1920 after training duties in the United States during the war. The 3d Aero Squadron (3d Pursuit Squadron), also a stateside training unit during the war, was transferred from Mitchel Field, New York in 1920. The 28th Aero Squadron (28th Bombardment Squadron), which had served in combat on the Western Front during the war, was transferred to the group in 1922. The 3d Pursuit Squadron was moved to Clark Field upon its arrival in 1920 and Nichols became home of Air Park No, 11 (later 66th Service Squadron, which supported the group logistically with equipment, supplies and vehicles both at Nichols and Clark Fields). It also became the home of the Manila Air Depot, which provided maintenance support for all Army and Navy aircraft in the Philippines.

The primary operational mission of Nichols Field was tactical training for coastal defense of Luzon. Due to its proximity to Manila, it also was the primary command and control base for the Philippine Department Air Force. Exercises and maneuvers with Army ground forces and Naval forces were a regular and important part of its mission. Another mission of Nichols Field during the 1920s was aerial mapping of the Philippines; the topography of many of the islands were largely unknown. The aerial mapping mission was the primary mission of the 2d Observation Squadron, which moved between Clark and Nichols during the 1920s and 1930s.

===Prelude to war===

In 1940, political relations between the United States and the Japanese Empire reached a crisis with the Japanese occupation of French Indochina. With war clouds forming, a reinforcement effort was made to the Air Corps units in the Philippines.

On or about 1 November 1940, the 4th Composite was reinforced by the 17th Pursuit Squadron from the 1st Pursuit Group, being transferred from Selfridge Field, Michigan to Nichols Field. Nichols Field was commanded by Col. Lawrence S. Churchill. The 20th Pursuit Squadron, from the 35th Pursuit Group at Hamilton Field, California, also was transferred to Nichols. Both of these squadrons, however, had only sent their personnel and both were equipped in the Philippines with the obsolete Boeing P-26 Peashooter. In May 1941, the 17th and 20th squadrons were re-equipped with Seversky P-35As that were manufactured for the Swedish Air Force. On 24 October 1940, President Franklin Roosevelt signed an executive order requisitioning all the undelivered P-35s sold to Sweden and impressing them into the USAAC. Forty of the planes arrived at the Manila Air Depot in Swedish markings, with Swedish language technical orders and Swedish-marked instrumentation. These planes all required modification at the depot before being turned over to the squadrons for operational use. The 28th Bombardment Squadron also received some Douglas B-18 Bolos.

During summer 1941, Nichols Field was undergoing construction of an east–west runway, making the north–south runway unusable due to a lack of drainage. All of the flying units at Nichols were moved to Clark Field with the exception of the 17th Pursuit Squadron. The 17th was sent to Iba Airfield on the north coast of Luzon where it was undergoing gunnery training. In September, the 17th was moved to the still uncompleted Nichols Field when word was received that space at Clark was needed for B-17 Flying Fortresses of the incoming 19th Bombardment Group. The 3d Squadron was sent up to Iba for gunnery training to free up the space. However the 17th suffered from the ongoing construction at Nichols, which caused several ground accidents.

With the large number of units being deployed to the Philippines during the buildup of forces in the summer and fall of 1941, the 3rd, 17th and 20th Squadrons were reassigned to the new 24th Pursuit Group, which was activated at Clark Field. The 2d Observation Squadron was assigned directly to Far East Air Force Headquarters.

Notice was received by the group on 15 November that due to the tense international situation between the United States and the Japanese Empire, all pursuit aircraft on the flight line would be placed on alert 24 hours each day, be armed, fully fueled with pilots available on 30 minutes&#x27; notice. From 30 November to 6 December all squadrons underwent intensive training in day and night enemy interception and air-to-air gunnery.

===Battle of the Philippines===
On 8 December at about 03:30 the commercial radio station at Clark Field intercepted a message from Pearl Harbor, Hawaii about the Japanese attack there. However, the group was unable to verify this interception through official channels; no other action was taken other than notifying the Base Commander. However, all squadrons were put on alert.

At about 04:00 the radar at Iba Airfield on the north coast of Luzon reported a formation of unidentified aircraft approximately 75 miles off the West Coast of Luzon heading towards Corregidor. The 3d Pursuit Squadron was dispatched to intercept the formation, but no planes were sighted and the squadron returned to Iba. However, the radar tracks showed the interception was successful and the unidentified aircraft swung off to the west out of the range of the Radar. It was believed that the 3d went underneath the formation. At 04:45 notification was received of a state of war between the United States and the Japanese Empire. 
At approximately 09:30, a large formation of Japanese bombers was spotted over Lingayen Gulf reported heading towards Manila. The 20th Pursuit Squadron from Clark Field was immediately dispatched to intercept the formation over Roselas. The 17th Pursuit Squadron was ordered from Nichols Field to cover the airspace over Clark. The interception was not successful, as the bombers turned to the northeast and attacked Baguio and Tagagarau then headed north off the radar. Both squadrons returned to their stations and were refueled and put back on alert.

Again at approximately 11:30 a large formation of bombers was reported over the China Sea heading towards Manila. P-40 Warhawks took off from Nichols Field to intercept enemy aircraft spotted on radar, but failed to make contact. In the afternoon, P-40s again took off from Nichols Field to patrol over Bataan and Manila. On 9 December shortly after midnight, telephonic communications were re-established with Headquarters, FEAF. Intelligence reported that an unidentified number of enemy aircraft were approaching from the north. A flight of six P-40s from the 17th Pursuit Squadron was dispatched from Del Carmen Field to intercept. However, two of the aircraft were demolished on takeoff due to an accident. The remaining planes proceeded to Nichols Field but were unable to accomplish any interception of enemy aircraft in the dark and the night bombing of Nichols Field began at 03:15. In order to try to bring some of the units up to strength, FEAF ordered the remainder of the 3d sent to Nichols Field to bring the 34th with its P-35s up to strength.

At the end of the 10th, Group fighter strength had been reduced to about 30 aircraft, with 8 being P-35s. Due to the depleted strength of the Group, orders were received from FEAF Headquarters that pursuit planes were not to be dispatched other than upon orders from Headquarters. The planes would be employed mainly as reconnaissance aircraft to replace the 2d Observation Squadron, which was made inoperable after being mostly destroyed on the ground. Its remaining planes were unarmed and sitting ducks if attacked.

On the morning of 23 December the Japanese made a landing in San Miguel Bay along the east coast of Lingayen Gulf. The ground combat situation on Luzon quickly became desperate when a second set of major landings occurred along the shore of Lamon Bay in southern Luzon. With the landings, the units at Nichols and Clark field withdrew to dispersed bases on Luzon, and with General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s proclamation of Manila as an open city on 26 December, all FEAF personnel withdrew from Nichols Field. On the 28th Japanese forces occupied the airfield.

===Japanese occupation===

After its occupation, Nichols Field became a fighter base for the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service. It was attacked on several occasions by FEAF fighters. On the night of 26/27 January 1942 Fighters from Bataan Airfield, bombed and strafed Nichols during the night inflicting considerable damage on Japanese aircraft and fuel storage. It was also attacked by B-17 Flying Fortresses from Australia, on 12 April 1942 staging though Del Monte Field on Mindanao.

After the capitulation of American forces in the Philippines, on 19 May 1942 the Japanese had American prisoner of war (POW) pilots fly two P-40 Warhawks and a PT-17 Stearman biplane from Davao Airfield to Nichols. One of the P-40s was delayed due to bad weather and landed at a small airstrip en route. It was used as a Prisoner of War Camp (&quot;Philippine Military Prison Camp 306&quot;) and also used as a combat airfield by the IJNAS 1021st Kōkūtai flying Mitsubishi G4M medium bombers.

===Battle of Nichols Field===
After their defeat in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the Japanese Navy reconstituted itself as a land force and positioned their naval guns in Fort Mckinley to halt the Allied advance on Luzon. The Japanese had transformed Fort Mckinley into one of the most heavily armed fortification of the Pacific War. The Japanese deployed their veteran Japanese Imperial Marines, naval troops and some kempeitai to muster some 3,000 troops to defend Fort Mckinley and Nichols Field.

Fifth Air Force flew air attacks against Nichols Field in late January and during February 1945. During the Battle of Luzon, Nichols Field was recaptured by elements of the Sixth United States Army when paratroopers of the 11th Airborne Division attacked the base on 4 February. Four days&#x27; effort had effected little reduction in the amount of Japanese fire originating from the Nichols Field defenses. Support fires of Mindoro-based A-20s and the division&#x27;s light artillery (75 mm pack howitzers and the short 105 mm howitzers) had not destroyed enough Japanese weapons to permit the infantry to advance without taking unduly heavy casualties. In fact, the volume of fire from Japanese naval guns of various types was still so great that one infantry company commander requested: &quot;Tell Halsey to stop looking for the Jap Fleet. It&#x27;s dug in on Nichols Field&quot;.

When direct communication began, the 11th Airborne Division and the XIV Corps quickly co-ordinated artillery fire plans and established a limit of fire line to demark their support zones about midway between Nichols Field and the Manila city limits. Under the provisions of this plan XIV Corps Artillery fired sixteen 155 mm and 8-inch howitzer concentrations in support of the airborne division&#x27;s attack at Nichols Field before the division passed to XIV Corps control about 1300 on 10 February. For the time being, Griswold directed Swing, the 11th Airborne Division would continue to exert pressure against the Japanese at Nichols Field but would mount no general assault. Instead, the division would ascertain the extent and nature of the Japanese defenses at and east of the airfield and prepare to secure the Cavite naval base area, which the division had bypassed on its way north from Nasugbu. Further orders would be forthcoming once XIV Corps itself could learn more about the situation south of Manila.

The attack was preceded by artillery and mortar concentrations and by an air strike executed by Marine Corps SBD&#x27;s from the Lingayen Gulf fields, support that succeeded in knocking out many Japanese artillery positions. The 2d Battalion, 187th Infantry, attacked generally east from the northwest corner of the field; the 188th Infantry and the 1st Battalion, 187th Infantry, drove in from the south and southeast. By dusk the two regiments had cleared most of the field and finished mopping up the next day.

Nichols Field was, however, by no means ready to receive Allied Air Force planes. Runways and taxiways were heavily mined, the runways were pitted by air and artillery bombardments, and the field was still subjected to intermittent artillery and mortar fire from the Fort McKinley area. At the airfield, many wrecked Japanese Navy and Army aircraft were captured, including several intact examples.

===Japanese surrender and postwar use===
Repaired, Nichols was used by the Air Transport Command (ATC) and Naval Air Transport Service (NATS).

On 19 August 1945, a sixteen-man Japanese delegation led by Japanese Lt. General Kanabe secretly left Kazarazu air base, Japan, in two Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot; bombers, painted white with green crosses, as ordered by General MacArthur, to comply with the surrender of the Philippines at Manila. After landing at Nichols Field and met by General Sutherland, they surrendered their swords. During the initial meeting, the Japanese were instructed to have 400 trucks and 100 sedans at Atsugi Airfield, Japan, in readiness to receive the 11th Airborne as occupation forces. This caused much concern with the dignitaries. Atsugi had been a training base for kamikaze pilots and many of them were refusing to surrender. There were also 300,000 well-trained troops on the Kanto Plain of Tokyo, so MacArthur moved the landing for the 11th A/B to 28 August; five days later than originally planned.

During 1945–1946 the 6th Troop Carrier Squadron (Jan-May 1946); 13th Troop Carrier Squadron (June–October 1946) and 22d Troop Carrier Squadrons (October 1946-April 1947) operated C-47 Skytrains from Nichols Field. Also a NATS detachment of six officers operated DC-3 transports was based at Nichols.

===Philippine independence===
After Philippine independence, on 4 July 1946, the US surrendered to the Republic of the Philippines all rights of possession, jurisdiction, supervision and control over the Philippine territory except the use of their military bases. Nichols Field later became the headquarters of the Philippine Air Force. First named Nichols Air Base, it is now named Villamor Air Base. The base shares its site with Ninoy Aquino International Airport.

As of the present, the names &quot;Nichols&quot;, &quot;Nichols Field&quot;, along with &quot;Villamor&quot;, are used as accepted nicknames or codenames for the area surrounding it. Commonly, Nichols Field is the codename for the entire NAIA complex.

<text>Cubana de Aviación S.A., or simply Cubana, is the flag carrier and largest airline of Cuba. It was founded in October 1929, becoming one of the earliest airlines to emerge in Latin America. It has its corporate headquarters in Havana, and its home base is located at José Martí International Airport. Originally a subsidiary of Pan American World Airways and later a private company owned by Cuban investors, Cubana has been wholly owned by the Cuban government since May 1959.

Cubana was a founder and is a current member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the International Association of Aeronautical Telecommunications (SITA) and the International Association of Latin American Air Transportation (AITAL).

==History==


===Early years to Cuban revolution===
The airline was established by Clement Melville Keys on 8 October 1929 as Compañía Nacional Cubana de Aviación Curtiss S.A., initially as a flying school as well as a charter carrier, beginning scheduled services in 1930. The airline&#x27;s name indicated its association with the Curtiss aircraft manufacturing company. Cubana&#x27;s early fleet used Curtiss Robin, amphibian Sikorsky S-38, Ford Trimotor, and Lockheed Electra (L-10) aircraft. Pan American acquired Cubana in 1932, and the word Curtiss was deleted from the carrier&#x27;s name. By the end of the decade, the carrier had a fleet of four Ford Trimotors and three Lockheed Electras that operated on the domestic Havana–Camaguey, Havana–Guantanamo–Baracoa and Santiago–Baracoa routes.

In 1944, the first International Conference on Civil Aviation was convened, which later would lead to the creation of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Cuba was a participant in this conference and a founding member of ICAO. In April 1945, the conference that created the International Air Transport Association (IATA) was held in Havana. Cubana became a founding member of IATA, and participated in the creation of that organization through its involvement with the Havana conference and the resulting accords. Both conferences and the organizations they spawned helped establish Cubana as an internationally recognized airline company.

In May 1945 Cubana started its first scheduled international flights to Miami, using Douglas DC-3 aircraft, making the airline the first Latin American one to establish scheduled passenger services to this city. In April 1948, a transatlantic route was started between Havana and Madrid (via Bermuda, the Azores and Lisbon) using Douglas DC-4 aircraft. The Madrid route was extended to Rome in 1950. The new route to Europe made Cubana one of the earliest Latin American carriers to establish scheduled transatlantic service.

In 1953, Airwork sold Cubana three Viscount 755s in advance of delivery. Cubana was also the first Latin American airline to operate turboprop aircraft, starting in the mid-1950s with the Vickers Viscount (VV-755), which were put in service in its Miami and domestic routes, and later the Super Viscount (VV-818).

By March 1953, the carrier&#x27;s fleet consisted of DC-3s and DC-4s. A year later, the strength of the fleet was 11 —six DC-3s, three Lockheed Constellations, one C-46 and one Stinson— while two Super Constellations were on order. Upon delivery of the first of these aircraft, in late 1954, the airline deployed it on the Mexico City–Madrid route. Cubana transported more than 227,000 passenger in 1955, and by that year end it had 715 employees. In May 1957, the airline ordered two Bristol Britannia 318s, intended to serve New York and Spain. An order for another two aircraft of the type was placed in mid-1958; the combined deal was worth  million. Aimed at replacing the Douglas DC-7s on the Havana–New York route, Cubana received the first of these aircraft in December 1958; it was put in service on that route immediately after being phased in.

===Cuban revolution to 1980s===

In May 1959, Cuba&#x27;s new revolutionary government decided to take over Cubana, expropriating all its investors. The private passenger airline Aerovías Q and private cargo carriers Cuba Aeropostal and Expreso Aéreo Interamericano, were then merged into Cubana, which was rebranded as Empresa Consolidada Cubana de Aviación and had an initial state investment of 80%; it started operations on 27 June 1961. The airline had expanded earlier that year its scheduled transatlantic services, adding Prague to its European route network that solely included Madrid. Having stopovers at Bermuda and the Azores, the route was flown with Bristol Britannia 318s. Cubana later sold one of its Britannias to Czechoslovak Airlines (CSA) so that this carrier could start their own Prague–Havana flights. Cubana trained CSA&#x27;s personnel in the operation of the Britannias. CSA&#x27;s new service started in February 1962 initially flying the Prague–Manchester–Prestwick–Havana route, and then switching to the Prague–Shannon–Gander–Havana run.

With the U.S. breaking relations (in 1961) and the imposition of the U.S. embargo on Cuba (in 1962), Cubana was forced to cancel all its U.S. services and turned to the Soviet Union to obtain new aircraft. The first Soviet-built aircraft were delivered in the early 1960s (Ilyushin Il-14 and Il-18), and were used in Cubana&#x27;s domestic routes. Cubana thus became the first airline in the Americas at that time to operate Soviet-built aircraft. During the decade, the An-12 and the An-24s were also added to the fleet. Cubana&#x27;s cooperation made it possible for Aeroflot to establish 18-hour non-stop scheduled services between Moscow and Havana in 1963, using Tupolev Tu-114 turboprop airliners, which were the longest non-stop flights in the world at that time. Cooperation with the East German airline Interflug also made it possible for this carrier to establish its first scheduled transatlantic services, linking East Berlin with Havana.

In March 1970 the number of employees was 1,971; at this time the carrier fleet consisted of Antonov An-24Bs, Britannias 318s, C-46s, DC-3s, DC-4, Il-14s and Il-18s. Regular services to Peru, Chile, Panama, Guyana and several Caribbean destinations were started in the early and mid- 1970s. Cubana also began operating Tupolev Tu-154, Ilyushin Il-76, Yakovlev Yak-40 and Yak-42 jets in the mid-1970s. These aircraft made it possible to upgrade Cubana&#x27;s domestic services and to expand or start new services to Central and South America, and to some Caribbean nations. Regular services to Canada were also started, as Cuba began to develop its tourism sector. Routes to Africa were started in the mid-1970s, serving Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Cabo Verde. Cubana subsequently ceded one of its Il-62M jets to Angola&#x27;s national airline TAAG so that it could start its own Luanda-Havana flights, in cooperation with Cubana&#x27;s services on that route. This allowed TAAG to start its own, first-ever transatlantic route. In the late 1970s Cubana started services to Iraq, becoming the first Latin American carrier to serve Asia, although these services were discontinued in the early 1980s.

===1990s===
As of March 1990, Cubana had 5,658 employees and its fleet consisted of 12 An-24RVs, 26 Antonov An-26s, four Il-18s, 11 Ilyushin Il-62Ms, two Il-76Ds, eight Tupolev Tu-154s (five Tu-154B2s and three Tu-154Ms) and 12 Yakovlev Yak-40s. At this time, the airline flew internationally to Barbados, Basel, Berlin, Bissau, Buenos Aires, Georgetown, Kingston, Lima, Luanda, Madrid, Managua, Mexico City, Montreal, Panama City, Paris and Prague; it also served a domestic network consisting of Baracoa, Camagüey, Holguín, Nicaro, Nueva Gerona, Santiago de Cuba and Las Tunas.

In the early 1990s, Cubana pursued a multi-faceted strategy to face the challenges posed by the dissolution of the Socialist bloc and the Soviet Union. This strategy targeted a restructuring of Cubana&#x27;s fleet, the revamping of the airline&#x27;s technical capabilities, and upgrading the quality of passenger services. After the early 1990s, spare parts for Cubana&#x27;s Soviet-built aircraft became increasingly harder to source. Limited financial resources and lack of Western financing to replace these aircraft, coupled with restrictions imposed by the U.S. embargo on the sale of American-built aircraft and components (including engines and avionics), made it necessary to keep some of the airline&#x27;s Soviet-built airplanes in service. Cubana had received its last three new Il-62Ms in late 1990 and early 1991 [along with two other (also new) similar aircraft in 1988 and 1989], and was able to keep them in service long after the Soviet Union&#x27;s dissolution and the end of all Il-62 production in the mid-1990s. Cubana started leasing some Western aircraft (Airbus, Boeing) for limited periods of time in the mid-1990s, to help sustain its services to Europe, Canada and some Latin American destinations, given the rapid growth of Cuba&#x27;s tourism sector.

===2000s and onwards===
In the early 2000s, Cubana refurbished several of its Il-62Ms to use on some of its international routes (all but one of these aircraft were removed from service in 2011), and in 2004 it embarked on a long-term renovation programme. The strategy is based on the purchase of $100 million a year in new generation Russian-built aircraft until 2012. As of 2012, Cubana had completely renovated its fleet with new-generation Russian airliners. As part of its renovation strategy, Cubana has sought to upgrade its technical support capabilities. The airline established a joint venture company with Iberia Airlines of Spain in 2005, to maintain and overhaul Western-built aircraft, such as Airbus and Boeing.

In July 2004, the airline placed an order for two convertible Ilyushin Il-96-300s in a  million deal; 85% of that price was financed by a loan from Roseximbank, while Cuba&#x27;s Aviaimport raised the money for the balance. In December 2005, Cubana received the first of these aircraft, becoming the first customer of the type beyond the Russian borders. In April 2006, Cuba signed another deal —worth  million this time— on behalf of Cubana for the purchase of another two Il-96-300s and three Tupolev Tu-204s. Two of these Tu-204s, one passenger and one cargo version, were handed over to the carrier in and August 2007, respectively. During the August 2007 MAKS Airshow Cubana signed a memorandum of understanding with Ilyushin Finance Company (IFC) for the purchase of another two Tu-204s and three Antonov An-148s. A Tu-204 freighter was never delivered to the company due to financing problems.

In July 2012, Cubana de Aviación signed a contract with IFC for the delivery of Antonov An-158 aircraft. In February 2013, Cubana signed a deal for the order of three 350-seater Ilyushin Il-96-400s. In the same year, Cubana received its first Antonov An-158; Cubana received another An-158s during . The delivery of the example marked the signing of another contract for more aircraft of the type, scheduled for delivery in . A An-158 was delivered in April 2014; , Antonov was to deliver to the airline a aircraft of the type. However, since 2018 all aircraft of this type are stored due to ongoing maintenance issues.

==Destinations==

As of January 2025, Cubana operates scheduled flights on two domestic routes within Cuba as well as to two international destinations in Venezuela and Spain. In 2024, Cubana was forced to end further international flights to Argentina, which it had served from both Havana and Cayo Coco, after the airline has been refused further supply of fuel.

<doc id="162132" wikidata="Q1207920" url="?curid=162132" title="Derangement">
<text>In combinatorial mathematics, a derangement is a permutation of the elements of a set in which no element appears in its original position. In other words, a derangement is a permutation that has no fixed points.

The number of derangements of a set of size is known as the subfactorial of or the derangement number or de Montmort number (after Pierre Remond de Montmort). Notations for subfactorials in common use include , , , or  .

For , the subfactorial equals the nearest integer to , where denotes the factorial of and is Euler&#x27;s number.

The problem of counting derangements was first considered by Pierre Raymond de Montmort in his &quot;Essay d&#x27;analyse sur les jeux de hazard&quot; in 1708; he solved it in 1713, as did Nicholas Bernoulli at about the same time.

== Example ==

Suppose that a professor gave a test to 4 students – A, B, C, and D – and wants to let them grade each other&#x27;s tests. Of course, no student should grade their own test. How many ways could the professor hand the tests back to the students for grading, such that no student receives their own test back? Out of (4!) for handing back the tests,
there are only 9 derangements (shown in blue italics above). In every other permutation of this 4-member set, at least one student gets their own test back (shown in bold red).

Another version of the problem arises when we ask for the number of ways &quot;n&quot; letters, each addressed to a different person, can be placed in &quot;n&quot; pre-addressed envelopes so that no letter appears in the correctly addressed envelope.

==Counting derangements==

Counting derangements of a set amounts to the &quot;hat-check problem&quot;, in which one considers the number of ways in which &quot;n&quot; hats (call them &quot;h&quot;1 through &quot;hn&quot;) can be returned to &quot;n&quot; people (&quot;P&quot;1 through &quot;Pn&quot;) such that no hat makes it back to its owner.

Each person may receive any of the &quot;n&quot; − 1 hats that is not their own. Call the hat which the person &quot;P&quot;1 receives &quot;hi&quot; and consider &quot;hi&quot;″s owner: &quot;Pi&quot; receives either &quot;P&quot;1&#x27;s hat, &quot;h&quot;1, or some other. Accordingly, the problem splits into two possible cases:
# &quot;Pi&quot; receives a hat other than &quot;h&quot;1. This case is equivalent to solving the problem with &quot;n&quot; − 1 people and &quot;n&quot; − 1 hats because for each of the &quot;n&quot; − 1 people besides &quot;P&quot;1 there is exactly one hat from among the remaining &quot;n&quot; − 1 hats that they may not receive (for any &quot;Pj&quot; besides &quot;Pi&quot;, the unreceivable hat is &quot;hj&quot;, while for &quot;Pi&quot; it is &quot;h&quot;1). Another way to see this is to rename &quot;h&quot;1 to &quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot;, where the derangement is more explicit: for any &quot;j&quot; from 2 to &quot;n&quot;, &quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot; cannot receive &quot;h&quot;&quot;j&quot;.
# &quot;Pi&quot; receives &quot;h&quot;1. In this case the problem reduces to &quot;n&quot; − 2 people and &quot;n&quot; − 2 hats, because &quot;P&quot;1 received &quot;hi&quot;″s hat and &quot;P&quot;&quot;i&quot; received &quot;h&quot;1&#x27;s hat, effectively putting both out of further consideration. 

For each of the &quot;n&quot; − 1 hats that &quot;P&quot;1 may receive, the number of ways that &quot;P&quot;2, ..., &quot;Pn&quot; may all receive hats is the sum of the counts for the two cases.

This gives us the solution to the hat-check problem: Stated algebraically, the number !&quot;n&quot; of derangements of an &quot;n&quot;-element set is
formula_1 for formula_2,
where formula_3 and formula_4

The number of derangements of small lengths is given in the table below.

There are various other expressions for , equivalent to the formula given above. These include
formula_5 for formula_6
and
:formula_7 for formula_8
where formula_9 is the nearest integer function and formula_10 is the floor function.

Other related formulas include
formula_11
formula_12
and
formula_13

The following recurrence also holds:
formula_14

=== Derivation by inclusion–exclusion principle ===

One may derive a non-recursive formula for the number of derangements of an &quot;n&quot;-set, as well. For formula_15 we define formula_16 to be the set of permutations of objects that fix the object. Any intersection of a collection of of these sets fixes a particular set of objects and therefore contains formula_17 permutations. There are formula_18 such collections, so the inclusion–exclusion principle yields
formula_19
and since a derangement is a permutation that leaves none of the &quot;n&quot; objects fixed, this implies
formula_20

On the other hand, formula_21 since we can choose elements to be in their own place and
derange the other elements in just ways, by definition.

==Growth of number of derangements as &quot;n&quot; approaches ∞==
From
formula_5
and
formula_23
by substituting formula_24 one immediately obtains that
formula_25
This is the limit of the probability that a randomly selected permutation of a large number of objects is a derangement. The probability converges to this limit extremely quickly as increases, which is why is the nearest integer to The above semi-log graph shows that the derangement graph lags the permutation graph by an almost constant value.

More information about this calculation and the above limit may be found in the article on the
statistics of random permutations.

=== Asymptotic expansion in terms of Bell numbers ===
An asymptotic expansion for the number of derangements in terms of Bell numbers is as follows:
formula_26
where formula_27 is any fixed positive integer, and formula_28 denotes the formula_29-th Bell number. Moreover, the constant implied by the big O-term does not exceed formula_30.

== Generalizations ==
The problème des rencontres asks how many permutations of a size-&quot;n&quot; set have exactly &quot;k&quot; fixed points.

Derangements are an example of the wider field of constrained permutations. For example, the &quot;ménage problem&quot; asks if &quot;n&quot; opposite-sex couples are seated man-woman-man-woman-... around a table, how many ways can they be seated so that nobody is seated next to his or her partner?

More formally, given sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;S&quot;, and some sets &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot; of surjections &quot;A&quot; → &quot;S&quot;, we often wish to know the number of pairs of functions (&quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;) such that &quot;f&quot; is in &quot;U&quot; and &quot;g&quot; is in &quot;V&quot;, and for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A&quot;, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) ≠ &quot;g&quot;(&quot;a&quot;); in other words, where for each &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, there exists a derangement φ of &quot;S&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) = φ(&quot;g&quot;(&quot;a&quot;)).

Another generalization is the following problem:

:&quot;How many anagrams with no fixed letters of a given word are there?&quot;

For instance, for a word made of only two different letters, say &quot;n&quot; letters A and &quot;m&quot; letters B, the answer is, of course, 1 or 0 according to whether &quot;n&quot; = &quot;m&quot; or not, for the only way to form an anagram without fixed letters is to exchange all the &quot;A&quot; with &quot;B&quot;, which is possible if and only if &quot;n&quot; = &quot;m&quot;. In the general case, for a word with &quot;n&quot;1 letters &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;n&quot;2 letters &quot;X&quot;2, ..., &quot;n&quot;&quot;r&quot; letters &quot;X&quot;&quot;r&quot;, it turns out (after a proper use of the inclusion-exclusion formula) that the answer has the form
formula_31
for a certain sequence of polynomials &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot; has degree &quot;n&quot;. But the above answer for the case &quot;r&quot; = 2 gives an orthogonality relation, whence the &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;&#x27;s are the Laguerre polynomials (up to a sign that is easily decided).
In particular, for the classical derangements, one has that
formula_32
where formula_33 is the upper incomplete gamma function.

==Computational complexity==
It is NP-complete to determine whether a given permutation group (described by a given set of permutations that generate it) contains any derangements.

<doc id="162138" wikidata="Q3596267" url="?curid=162138" title="'Til Tuesday">
<text>″Til Tuesday (often stylized as ″til tuesday) is an American new wave band formed in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. The band, consisting of Aimee Mann (lead vocals, bass), Robert Holmes (guitar), Joey Pesce (keyboards), and Michael Hausman (drums), was active from 1982 to 1989. They are best known for their 1985 hit single &quot;Voices Carry&quot;.

==History==
&#x27;Til Tuesday first gained fame six months after its formation when it won Boston&#x27;s WBCN Rock &amp; Roll Rumble in 1983. Their original composition &quot;Love in a Vacuum&quot; (credited to all members of the group) received a fair amount of airplay on the station, and the group was eventually signed to Epic Records.

&quot;Love in a Vacuum&quot; was re-recorded for the Epic debut album, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Voices Carry&quot;; however, the title track became their breakthrough song. The &quot;Voices Carry&quot; single peaked at number eight on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and is said to have been inspired by an argument between Mann and Hausman, who had broken off a relationship before the album&#x27;s release. According to producer Mike Thorne on his Stereo Society web site, &quot;The title track was originally written and sung by Aimee as if to a woman... The record company was predictably unhappy with such lyrics.&quot;

The band became an early MTV staple with the &quot;Voices Carry&quot; video, which depicts a domineering boyfriend trying to convert Mann to his upper-class lifestyle; she finally lashes out at him during a concert, standing up from her seat in the audience and removing her cap to reveal her signature spiky, rat-tailed hair. The group won that year&#x27;s MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist.

By the 1986 follow-up &quot;Welcome Home&quot;, Mann was beginning to write more of the songs herself and the band was moving away from the slick new wave sound of their debut. But while critical reaction was generally strong, the #26 placement for the lead single, &quot;What About Love&quot;, was a commercial disappointment, especially after the top-ten success of &quot;Voices Carry&quot;. The album entered the U.S. top 50, also a letdown after the #19 placing for their debut.

After the album&#x27;s release Pesce left the band and was replaced by Michael Montes. At about the same time, Mann&#x27;s two-year relationship with singer-songwriter Jules Shear, whom she had been dating since the release of the &quot;Voices Carry&quot; album, came to an end. This breakup somewhat informed the band&#x27;s final album, 1988&#x27;s &quot;Everything&#x27;s Different Now&quot;, particularly in the song &quot;J for Jules&quot;, though Mann insisted that not every song on the LP was about the relationship. Shear collaborated with Matthew Sweet on the album&#x27;s title track; it also featured &quot;The Other End (Of the Telescope)&quot;, a collaboration between Mann and Elvis Costello on which Costello provided a guest vocal. Holmes and Montes played on every track of the album, but Holmes left before its release; for live dates, Til Tuesday was now a duo of Mann and Hausman, supported by session musicians.

While critical praise continued to flow, &quot;Everything&#x27;s Different Now&quot; album peaked at No. 124 in the U.S., while the lead single &quot;(Believed You Were) Lucky&quot; (co-written with Shear) reached number 95. &#x27;Til Tuesday broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career. She said later that her musical interests had changed, and that she was more interested in &quot;acoustic guitar music&quot; than the new wave pop of &#x27;Til Tuesday. Hausman, her former boyfriend, became her manager. &#x27;Til Tuesday (all the original members) are due to reunite for their first show in 33 years at the Cruel World Festival in Pasadena, California on May 17, 2025.

<text>Ostrołęka (; ) is a small city in northeastern Poland on the Narew river, about northeast of Warsaw, with a population of 51,012 (2021) and an area of . It is the capital of both Ostrołęka County and Ostrołęka City County in the Masovian Voivodeship.

Until the late 1980s, Ostrołęka was a local railroad junction, with four lines stemming from Ostrołęka railway station: eastwards to Łapy and Białystok, southwestwards to Tłuszcz and Warsaw, northwards to Wielbark and Olsztyn, and southwards to Małkinia.

==History==

===Founding===
The territory became part of the emerging Polish state under its first historic ruler Mieszko I in the 10th century, and following the 12th-century fragmentation of the realm, it was part of the provincial Polish Duchy of Masovia.

The city&#x27;s name refers to a sand-mud plain located on the left side of the Narew River which regularly flooded in the springtime throughout the centuries. A small fort was built on an island in the 11th or 12th century, currently located just one kilometer west of the modern city center. The fort was one of few sparsely built fortifications along the Narew River at the time. A village developed surrounding the fort over time, and is associated today as the initial settlement of Ostrołęka. Despite the lack of an exact date for Ostrołęka&#x27;s founding, it was first mentioned as a town in the Province Act of 1373 by Duke Siemowit III of Masovia, and therefore, the year 1373 has become the most commonly associated date of the acquisition of town rights.

===The 15th and 16th centuries===
By the beginning of the 15th Century, Ostrołęka grew into an important economic center in the Duchy of Masovia for trade with the neighboring Teutonic Order. Wood, amber, and honey were the most commonly traded items. In 1526, the Duchy was incorporated directly into the Polish Kingdom. This resulted in an economic boom, most commonly associated to today as Ostrołęka&#x27;s Golden Age. At this time, Queen Bona Sforza founded a folwark in Pomian – a neighboring settlement at the time, which currently finds itself situated well within the modern city&#x27;s borders. The Golden Age lasted for approximately 40 years, whose conclusion is marked by three major catastrophes which struck in 1564 and 1571. In 1564, an epidemic seriously depopulated the town and surrounding regions. The same year, a fire tore through the town burning most of it down to the ground. In 1571, before the town had time to recuperate from the two previous catastrophes, another epidemic struck, further depopulating the region, officially marking the end of the town&#x27;s Golden Age. Within 20 years, however, the town was rebuilt, including with the construction of Ostrołęka&#x27;s first school. By the late 1590s, the town became the center of a big administrative district, approximately 1,980.5 km2 in size. It was a Polish royal city, administratively located in the Masovian Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province.

===The 17th and 18th centuries===
Despite quickly recuperating in the early 17th century, the city passed through a period of impoverishment and stagnation in the middle and late 17th century. On 25 July 1656, in the midst of the Deluge, the town was laid waste by Swedish forces after having resisted them. In 1665, Bernardine monks settled in the town after a monastery was founded by Tomasz Gocłowski. The Bernardine monastery of St. Anthony of Padua was built in a late-Baroque style.

Despite being inhabited by only 400 people in 1676, the town was still considered to be the most populous of towns in the Łomża region. In the following century, the town was destroyed numerous times by Swedish, Russian, and Saxon armies. As a result, further economic development was hindered and the town remained in a state of stagnation for several decades. In the second half of the 18th century the city&#x27;s economy revived and local merchants renewed trade with the major cities of Gdańsk, Warsaw and Königsberg.

During the Kościuszko Uprising, the First Wielkopolska National Cavalry Brigade was stationed in Ostrołęka. With the aim of aiding the Kościuszko Uprising, the First Brigade, led by Antoni Madaliński, started to march towards Kraków on 12 March 1794. Prussian troops reacted quickly by heading as far south as the Narew River, and reached the town&#x27;s northern outskirts on the right bank of the Narew River, yet had never marched directly into, nor fully occupied, the town. The Uprising had failed and as a consequence of the Third Partition of Poland two years later, Ostrołęka found itself within Prussia&#x27;s borders for ten years. At the turn of the century, the first German and Jewish families began to settle in the town and surrounding areas. 

===The Warsaw Duchy===
From the end of 1806 through June 1807, Ostrołęka was occupied by French troops. On 16 February 1807 occurred the Battle of Ostrołęka (1807). Taking place on the banks of the Narew outside of Ostrołęka where the French, under the General Anne Jean Marie René Savary, prevailed. Due to this success of the French Army, Ostrołęka appears on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. In May 1807 the first map of Ostrołęka was made (now located in &quot;Bibliothéque du Génie&quot; in Paris). From 1807 to 1815 the city was part of the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw.

=== Congress Poland ===
As part of a comprehensive plan of industrializing Poland, an extensive settlement for linen and cotton craftsmen was built on the right bank of Narew in 1826. The number of craftsmen increased and workers were trained in new crafts. The town also built two bridges, one permanent. The new route connecting Warsaw and St. Petersburg ran through Ostrołęka. Although the town&#x27;s citizens were eager and proud to take part in the November Uprising of 1830-1831, they worried that their city, as in every previous war, would be destroyed. However they did not expect that the heaviest fighting would take place on near Ostrołęka.

Rebel plans envisaged the Polish Army attacking the Russian Infantry Corps of the Tsar&#x27;s Guard, which made camp between Augustów and Ostrołęka. On 18 May 1831 General Henryk Dembiński claimed Ostrołęka. But General Jan Zygmunt Skrzynecki didn&#x27;t make a use of his temporary superiority and he couldn&#x27;t make up his mind whether to attack the Russians situated near Łomża. As a result, Łomża was destroyed.

On 26 May 1831 the Battle of Ostrołęka (1831) took place. As a cannonade was heard, Jan Zygmunt Skrzynecki couldn&#x27;t believe that Hans Karl von Diebitsch (a Russian general) had already reached the suburbs of the city. He ordered the Fourth Infantry Regiment to defend the city. The main defending forces fortified themselves in the Bernardine Monastery. Unfortunately the Russians had brought cannons with them; they quickly overpowered the Polish units and forced their surrender. 
Von Diebitsch took over the city center, but the battle continued on the right side of the Narew. Skrzynecki and his troops valiantly defended the bridge, wanting to hold back the Russian forces from crossing over to the other side of the river. Lieutenant-Colonel Józef Bem and his Fourth Battery were called in to help defend the bridge. Bem was able to hold back the Russians, but the battle is often referred to as a Polish defeat. The defeat marked the end of the Uprising. As a result of the battle, 6000 Polish soldiers died including many Kurpie. Bem, for his bravery, was nominated as Commander-in-Chief of Artillery and was honoured with a Virtuti Militari Cross. The battle was the greatest and the bloodiest in the November Uprising.

===1831-1918===

After the Polish-Russian War, Ostrołęka became one of the most destroyed cities. Although it suffered great losses, Ostrołęka stayed a district city of Płock&#x27;s Province. Ostrołęka&#x27;s economy greatly declined. Nearly all the city&#x27;s craftsmen became bankrupt. Only products of Ostrołęka&#x27;s amber works were still supplied all over Europe. Ostrołęka got refunds from the Tsar&#x27;s Treasury. However, it took a long time before it rose from its downfall. In 1847 a monument commemorating Russian Army&#x27;s victory in the battle of Ostrołęka was raised on 26 May 1831. At the time of January&#x27;s insurrection, no battles took place nearby Ostrołęka, as the Tsar placed a quite large Russian detachment in the city worrying of another Kurp Uprising. In 1864, after the Russian government&#x27;s order, the Benedictines left Ostrołęka and the monastery buildings were placed under the parish-priest authority. 

Until the First World War, the city managed to develop, but it was still a relatively unremarkable small town. The First World War destroyed its peaceful and monotonous character. Confiscation and forced labor devastated the economy caused rising prices for essential products, and generally caused the city to decline. In 1915, military operations in the territory of Polish Kingdom intensified. By July, the city was situated on the front line during the Russian Great Retreat, and in August 1915, Germans crossed the river Narew and entered the ruined city. At the time of the German occupation, life in Ostrołęka was as hard as in the time of Russian occupation. Between the years of 1916 and 1918, the Germans greatly exploited the forests for timber. To make transporting the wood easier, they built of road from Ostrołęka to Myszyniec and a narrow-gauge railway line.

===Interbellum===

After the First World War and re-establishment of independent Poland in 1918, the city became a part of the Białystok Voivodeship. 75% of the city and population was devastated. New schools and departments were opened as the city was rebuilt.

During the Polish-Soviet War, Ostrołęka once again became a center for military operations. On 4 August 1920, Soviet forces under the command of Hayk Bzhishkyan took the fort and &quot;butchered the newly assembled cavalry group&quot; of General Bolesław Roja. Local Jewish communists organized a rally in the city, tore Polish emblems and flags from buildings, and the newly appointed revolutionary committee leader, member of Poale Zion, announced to local wealthy Poles and Jews that their property will be taken from them. The local Polish intelligentsia and prominent religious Jews, along with the rabbi, were subjected to forced labour in the city. However, the Soviet occupation was short lived as the Soviet XV Army retreated on 20 August, with Polish forces thundering east towards the former Polish-Soviet border after the Battle of Warsaw (1920).

After the Polish-Soviet War, Ostrołęka began to industrialize. A cinema was opened in 1923, and a power plant in 1928. During the summer of 1939, both sides of the Narew beachhead were fortified.

===Second World War===

During the invasion of Poland, which started World War II, on 10 September 1939 German forces reached Ostrołęka. The Germans immediately carried out searches of Polish offices and organizations. Under German occupation the town was annexed directly to Germany and in 1940 it was renamed &quot;Scharfenwiese&quot; to remove traces of Polish origin. The Germans expelled its Jewish minority, which was later mostly murdered in the Treblinka extermination camp. Ostrołęka became a border town, today&#x27;s easternmost areas belonged to USSR.
Quickly, a Polish resistance movement was established with a substantial presence of local Kurpes. Churches and schools were changed into workshops and factories controlled by the Underground. Underground partisans started attacking and destroying German fortifications in and around Ostrołęka.

The Germans established and operated a court prison, in which they held Poles arrested in the city and county during the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;. Around 500 Poles were then massacred in the nearby forest in January–March 1940. On 5–6 April 1940, the Germans carried out further mass arrests of around 200 Poles in Ostrołęka and nearby villages. The Germans also operated a forced labour camp in the city from 1940 to 1944. In December 1940, German police expelled around 1,150 Poles from Ostrołęka and Wojciechowice (present-day district of Ostrołęka), who were transported in trucks to a camp in Działdowo and then deported to the Krakow and Radom districts of to the General Government, while their houses were handed over to German colonists as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. A minority of citizens of Ostrołęka declared themselves as Volksdeutsche and signed the Volksliste. Jews that survived the Holocaust emigrated to Israel. Several local Jews were rescued by Poles, who hid them from the Germans in nearby villages. The German occupation ended in September 1944, and the city was restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which then stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s.

===People&#x27;s Republic of Poland===
Ostrołęka recovered very slowly from the war. A plan created by communist authorities, which allowed for an improvement of the economic situation in Poland, gave Ostrołęka a chance for redevelopment. Ostrołęka became a central city of Warsaw&#x27;s region. In 1959, a cellulose and paper factory was built. Next, a sewage refinery was built along the banks of the Narew, which was supposed to keep water in the Narew clean without destroying its biological life. In 1973 a cellular concrete factory was built in the district of Wojciechowice. New jobs brought people to the city and caused a development of alimentary industry. During the 1970s a new factory, &quot;Future&quot;, producing wooden articles was opened. A new swimming pool, a stadium for 5000 people, and a holiday resort were built. A new hospital was built. From 1975 to 1998, it was the capital of the Ostrołęka Voivodeship.

===Ostrołęka since 1989===

In 1989 the city entered a new era of capitalism, which has lasted until the present day. The same year Ostrołęka was granted provincial rights. The paper factory Cellulose downsized en masse after privatisation. The factory Future went bankrupt but small service establishments were opened for average people to invest their money. A new hospital was built in the new century. The economy also developed. Three new trade pavilions were built. &quot;Cellulose&quot; changed its name to &quot;Intercell&quot; (later purcharsed by finnish company Stora Enso) and the cellular concrete factory was bought by the Ytong company. The centre of the city began to fulfill trade functions. 

In 1996, a second permanent bridge, &quot;Most im. Antoniego Madalińskiego&quot;, was built. In 1999 the city became a district city. A new aquapark was opened in September 2010. A modernisation of the city stadium or even a completely new stadium is planned to be built in this decade, while two new modern training grounds for football are currently being built. A new power plant is currently being built and planned to open by 2015, generating 1,000 MW of power. Also, the existing power plant is planned to undergo modernisation in the next decade.

<doc id="162143" wikidata="Q1131260" url="?curid=162143" title="Keloid">
<text>Keloid, also known as keloid disorder and keloidal scar, is the formation of a type of scar which, depending on its maturity, is composed mainly of either type III (early) or type I (late) collagen. It is a result of an overgrowth of granulation tissue (collagen type III) at the site of a healed skin injury which is then slowly replaced by collagen type I. Keloids are firm, rubbery lesions or shiny, fibrous nodules, and can vary from pink to the color of the person&#x27;s skin or red to dark brown in color. A keloid scar is benign and not contagious, but sometimes accompanied by severe itchiness, pain, and changes in texture. In severe cases, it can affect movement of skin. In the United States, keloid scars are seen 15 times more frequently in people of sub-Saharan African descent than in people of European descent. There is a higher tendency to develop a keloid among those with a family history of keloids and people between the ages of 10 and 30 years.

Keloids should not be confused with hypertrophic scars, which are raised scars that do not grow beyond the boundaries of the original wound.

==Signs and symptoms==

Keloids expand in claw-like growths over normal skin. They have the capability to hurt with a needle-like pain or to itch, the degree of sensation varying from person to person.

Keloids typically form within scar tissue. Collagen, used in wound repair, tends to overgrow in this area, sometimes producing a lump many times larger than that of the original scar. They can also range in color from pink to red. Although they usually occur at the site of an injury, keloids can also arise spontaneously. They can occur at the site of a piercing and even from something as simple as a pimple or scratch. They can occur as a result of severe acne or chickenpox scarring, infection at a wound site, repeated trauma to an area, excessive skin tension during wound closure or a foreign body in a wound. Keloids can sometimes be sensitive to chlorine. If a keloid appears when someone is still growing, the keloid can continue to grow as well.


==Location==
Keloids can develop in any place where skin trauma has occurred. They can be the result of pimples, insect bites, scratching, burns, or other skin injury. Keloid scars can develop after surgery. They are more common in some sites, such as the central chest (from a sternotomy), the back and shoulders (usually resulting from acne), and the ear lobes (from ear piercings). They can also occur on body piercings. The most common spots are earlobes, arms, pelvic region, and over the collar bone.

==Cause==
Most skin injury types can contribute to scarring. This includes burns, acne scars, chickenpox scars, ear piercing, scratches, surgical incisions, and vaccination sites.

According to the US National Center for Biotechnology Information, keloid scarring is common in young people between the ages of 10 and 20. Studies have shown that those with darker complexions are at a higher risk of keloid scarring as a result of skin trauma. They occur in 15–20% of individuals with sub-Saharan African, Asian or Latino ancestry, significantly less in those of a Caucasian background. Although it was previously believed that people with albinism did not get keloids, a recent report described the incidence of keloids in Africans with albinism. Keloids tend to have a genetic component, which means one is more likely to have keloids if one or both of their parents has them. However, no single gene has yet been identified which is a causing factor in keloid scarring but several susceptibility loci have been discovered, most notably in Chromosome 15.

== Genetics ==

People who have ancestry from Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, or Latin America are more likely to develop a keloid. Among ethnic Chinese in Asia, the keloid is the most common skin condition. In the United States, keloids are more common in African Americans and Hispanic Americans than European Americans. Those who have a family history of keloids are also susceptible since about 1/3 of people who get keloids have a first-degree blood relative (mother, father, sister, brother, or child) who also gets keloids. This family trait is most common in people of African and/or Asian descent.

Development of keloids among twins also lends credibility to existence of a genetic susceptibility to develop keloids. Marneros et al. (1) reported four sets of identical twins with keloids; Ramakrishnan et al. also described a pair of twins who developed keloids at the same time after vaccination. Case series have reported clinically severe forms of keloids in individuals with a positive family history and black African ethnic origin.
==Pathology==
Histologically, keloids are fibrotic tumors characterized by a collection of atypical fibroblasts with excessive deposition of extracellular matrix components, especially collagen, fibronectin, elastin, and proteoglycans. Generally, they contain relatively acellular centers and thick, abundant collagen bundles that form nodules in the deep dermal portion of the lesion. Keloids present a therapeutic challenge that must be addressed, as these lesions can cause significant pain, (itching), and physical disfigurement. They may not improve in appearance over time and can limit mobility if located over a joint.

Keloids affect all sexes equally, although the incidence in young female patients has been reported to be higher than in young males, probably reflecting the greater frequency of earlobe piercing among women. The frequency of occurrence is 15 times higher in highly pigmented people. People of African descent have increased risk of keloid occurrences.

==Treatments==
Prevention of keloid scars in patients with a known predisposition to them includes preventing unnecessary trauma or surgery (such as ear piercing and elective mole removal) whenever possible. Any skin problems in predisposed individuals (e.g., acne, infections) should be treated as early as possible to minimize areas of inflammation.

Treatments (both preventive and therapeutic) available are pressure therapy, silicone gel sheeting, intra-lesional triamcinolone acetonide (TAC), cryosurgery (freezing), radiation, laser therapy (pulsed dye laser), interferon (IFN), fluorouracil (5-FU) and surgical excision as well as a multitude of extracts and topical agents. Appropriate treatment of a keloid scar is age-dependent: radiotherapy, anti-metabolites and corticosteroids would not be recommended to be used in children, in order to avoid harmful side effects, like growth abnormalities.

In adults, corticosteroids combined with 5-FU and PDL in a triple therapy, enhance results and diminish side effects.

Cryotherapy (or cryosurgery) refers to the application of extreme cold to treat keloids. This treatment method is easy to perform, effective, safe, and has the least chance of recurrence.

Surgical excision is currently still the most common treatment for a significant amount of keloid lesions. However, when used as the solitary form of treatment there is a large recurrence rate of between 70 and 100%. It has also been known to cause a larger lesion formation on recurrence. While not always successful alone, surgical excision when combined with other therapies dramatically decreases the recurrence rate. Examples of these therapies include but are not limited to radiation therapy, pressure therapy and laser ablation. Pressure therapy following surgical excision has shown promising results, especially in keloids of the ear and earlobe. The mechanism of how exactly pressure therapy works is unknown at present, but many patients with keloid scars and lesions have benefited from it.

Intralesional injection with a corticosteroid such as triamcinolone acetonide (Kenalog) does appear to aid in the reduction of fibroblast activity, inflammation and pruritus.

Tea tree oil, salt or other topical oil has no effect on keloid lesions.

A 2022 systematic review included multiple studies on laser therapy for treating keloid scars. There was not enough evidence for the review authors to determine if laser therapy was more effective than other treatments. They were also unable to conclude if laser therapy leads to more harm than benefits compared with no treatment or different kinds of treatment.

Another 2022 systematic review compared silicone gel sheeting with no treatment, treatment with non-silicone gel sheeting and treatment with intralesional injections of triamcinolone acetonide. The authors only found two small studies (36 participants in total) that compared these treatment options so were unable to determine which (if any) was more effective.

==Epidemiology==

Persons of any age can develop a keloid. Children under 10 are less likely to develop keloids, even from ear piercing. Keloids may also develop from pseudofolliculitis barbae; continued shaving when one has razor bumps will cause irritation to the bumps, infection, and over time keloids will form. Persons with razor bumps are advised to stop shaving in order for the skin to repair itself before undertaking any form of hair removal. The tendency to form keloids is speculated to be hereditary. Keloids can tend to appear to grow over time without even piercing the skin, almost acting out a slow tumorous growth; the reason for this tendency is unknown.

Extensive burns, either thermal or radiological, can lead to unusually large keloids; these are especially common in firebombing casualties, and were a signature effect of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

The true incidence and prevalence of keloid in the United States is not known. Indeed, there has never been a population study to assess the epidemiology of this disorder. In his 2001 publication, Marneros stated that “reported incidence of keloids in the general population ranges from a high of 16% among the adults in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to a low of 0.09% in England,” quoting from Bloom&#x27;s 1956 publication on heredity of keloids. Clinical observations show that the disorder is more common among sub-Saharan Africans, African Americans and Asians, with unreliable and very wide estimated prevalence rates ranging from 4.5 to 16%.

==History==

Keloids were described by Egyptian surgeons around 1700 BCE, recorded in the Smith papyrus, regarding surgical techniques. Baron Jean-Louis Alibert (1768–1837) identified the keloid as an entity in 1806. He called them , later changing the name to to avoid confusion with cancer. The word is derived from the Ancient Greek , , meaning &quot;crab pincers&quot;, and the suffix &quot;-oid&quot;, meaning &quot;like&quot;. In the 19th century it was known as the &quot;Keloid of Alibert&quot; as opposed to &quot;Addison’s keloid&quot; (Morphea).

The famous American Civil War-era photograph &quot;Whipped Peter&quot; depicts an escaped former slave with extensive keloid scarring as a result of numerous brutal beatings from his former overseer.

Intralesional corticosteroid injections were introduced as a treatment in the mid-1960s as a method to attenuate scarring.

Pressure therapy has been used for prophylaxis and treatment of keloids since the 1970s.

Topical silicone gel sheeting was introduced as a treatment in the early 1980s.

<doc id="162144" wikidata="Q751814" url="?curid=162144" title="The Sisters of Mercy">
<text>The Sisters of Mercy are an English rock band formed in Leeds in 1980. After achieving early underground fame, the band experienced a commercial breakthrough in the mid-1980s, sustaining their success until the early 1990s, when they halted the release of new records in protest against their record company, WEA. Currently, although the band operates primarily as a touring outfit, they continue to perform new and unreleased music live.

The group has released three original studio albums: &quot;First and Last and Always&quot; (1985), &quot;Floodland&quot; (1987), and &quot;Vision Thing&quot; (1990). Each album was recorded by a different line-up; singer-songwriter Andrew Eldritch and the drum machine known as Doktor Avalanche are the only constant elements throughout. Eldritch and Avalanche were also involved in the Sisterhood, a side project linked to Eldritch&#x27;s disputes with former members.

The Sisters of Mercy ceased recording activity in the early 1990s when they went on strike against East West Records, whom they accused of incompetence and withholding royalties, while pressuring the group to release at least two more studio albums. Instead, the label released the album &quot;Go Figure&quot; under the name SSV in 1997. Although the Sisters of Mercy were eventually released from their contract with East West, they have never signed with another label nor released any new material. They have continued to perform new songs live.

Former members of the group went on to establish the bands Ghost Dance and the Mission.

==History==
===Early years (1980–1983)=== 
The Sisters of Mercy were formed in Leeds, England, in 1980 by Gary Marx and Andrew Eldritch, driven by their desire to hear themselves on the radio. In their inaugural year, the band experienced several lineup changes. One early formation included vocalist Keith Fuller and keyboardist Claire Shearsby, who accompanied Eldritch on drums and Marx on guitar. After this lineup disbanded, only Marx and Eldritch remained involved, both taking on vocal duties. During this period, Jon Langford played keyboard in the band but left due to infrequent attendance at practice.

At the end of 1980, the single &quot;Damage Done/Watch/Home of the Hit-men&quot; was recorded and released. On this single, Marx played guitar through a practice amplifier while Eldritch played drums, which he had purchased from Langford. Each member contributed to the songwriting: Eldritch penned &quot;Damage Done,&quot; while Marx wrote &quot;Watch&quot;. The band&#x27;s name was inspired by Robert Altman&#x27;s film &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; (1971), which featured Leonard Cohen&#x27;s song &quot;Sisters of Mercy&quot; from his album &quot;Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot;, as they believed that &quot;[calling ourselves] the Captains of Industry wouldn&#x27;t have been as funny&quot;.

The band later regrouped with Craig Adams on bass, while Eldritch&#x27;s drumming was replaced by a drum machine, allowing him to focus solely on vocals. The drum machine was named &quot;Doktor Avalanche,&quot; a title that continued with its numerous successors. Eldritch assumed responsibilities for lyric writing, Doktor programming, and record production, while co-writing the music with Marx and, occasionally, Adams.

This lineup is generally recognized as the first definitive Sisters formation. It commenced with the Doktor/Eldritch/Marx/Adams incarnation of the band performing a gig at the Riley Smith Hall of the Leeds University Union building in early 1981. Since the exact date remains unrecorded, for historical purposes, both the band and fans often celebrate the anniversary of the concert on 16 February 1981 at Alcuin College, York, which marked the band&#x27;s second performance; however, during this time, the band cycled through two additional members: guitarists Tom Ashton and Dave Humphrey. Later in 1981, Ben Gunn was recruited as the Sisters&#x27; second guitarist. Eldritch&#x27;s melancholic baritone, Craig Adams&#x27;s pulsating bass, Doktor Avalanche&#x27;s beat, and Marx&#x27;s flowing guitar contributed to the band&#x27;s early underground success. In 1982, the band recorded the &quot;Body Electric&quot; b/w &quot;Adrenochrome&quot; single for the CNT label.

The band&#x27;s singles regularly featured in UK independent charts, with some being named single of the week in various UK indie magazines. John Ashton of the Psychedelic Furs produced the early classic &quot;Alice.&quot; &quot;The Reptile House E.P.&quot; exemplifies the Sisters&#x27; early work and highlights the maturation of songwriter Eldritch, who wrote, produced, and reportedly played all instruments on the release.

Their live performances included many cover versions; among these was a medley consisting of &quot;Sister Ray&quot; (by the Velvet Underground), &quot;Ghostrider&quot; (by Suicide), and &quot;Louie Louie&quot; (by Richard Berry), which became a live staple. Only four covers, the Stooges&#x27; &quot;1969,&quot; the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Gimme Shelter,&quot; Hot Chocolate&#x27;s &quot;Emma,&quot; and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door,&quot; were eventually recorded and released as B-sides on Sisters records.

In late 1983, following the highly successful &quot;Temple of Love&quot; single, the band signed a contract with major record label WEA. Simultaneously, Gunn departed amidst an atmosphere of widespread discontent. Gunn expressed his disagreement with the direction Eldritch was steering the band, which, in Gunn&#x27;s view, had started as a humorous take on serious rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll outfits but had ultimately transformed into one. He also cited personality conflicts with Eldritch as a reason for his exit.

===&quot;First and Last and Always&quot; era (1984–1985)===
Gunn was succeeded by Wayne Hussey, who focused on 12-string electric and acoustic guitars while also contributing as a songwriter. His studio experience with Dead or Alive proved invaluable as the Sisters set out to record their first full-length album. The &quot;Black October&quot; UK tour (October–November 1984) solidified the band’s underground cult status; however, the growing estrangement between Eldritch and the rest of the group became increasingly problematic during the recording of the debut album &quot;First and Last and Always&quot;. Eldritch&#x27;s declining health and psychological issues further exacerbated the situation. The causes of these problems were frequently discussed in the gossip columns of the music press, including &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, and &quot;Sounds&quot;.

Most songs on the album were written and rehearsed by Marx, Hussey, and Adams, with Eldritch stepping in at the final stage to write lyrics and provide vocals.

Following the release of &quot;First and Last and Always&quot;, produced by David M. Allen, Marx departed from the band in the midst of a supporting tour, citing an inability to continue working with Eldritch. The Sisters of Mercy completed the tour as a three-piece act, bidding farewell to fans with their final performance at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall on 18 June 1985. Video recordings of this show were later released as &quot;Wake.&quot; A music video for the song &quot;Black Planet&quot; was also produced, featuring the Monkeemobile. Promotional videos were created for the singles &quot;Body and Soul,&quot; &quot;Walk Away,&quot; and &quot;No Time to Cry,&quot; but none of these videos, including &quot;Black Planet,&quot; have been officially released by the band to date.

===The split: the Sisterhood and the Mission (1985–1986)===
Shortly after the last gig, Eldritch relocated to Hamburg, where he was soon joined by Hussey. Their intention was to begin working on a follow-up album, tentatively titled &quot;Left on Mission and Revenge&quot;. Hussey had written several songs for the album, including &quot;Dance on Glass&quot; and &quot;Garden of Delight&quot;. Demo versions of both songs featuring Eldritch on vocals have since surfaced, suggesting that the band worked on the material together.

When Adams and Hussey left the band, they were replaced by the American singer and bass guitarist Patricia Morrison of the Bags and the Gun Club. 

Hussey and Adams went on to form a new group called the Sisterhood. Their setlists featured songs Hussey had intended for the Sisters of Mercy; he would later record and release many of them with his new group. Meanwhile, Eldritch protested against their use of the &quot;Sisterhood&quot; name as being too similar to the Sisters of Mercy and the name of his band&#x27;s fan community. In an attempt to stop Hussey&#x27;s band, Eldritch released the single &quot;Giving Ground&quot; by his own band, the Sisterhood. The single was later followed by the album &quot;Gift&quot;. Hussey&#x27;s band eventually named themselves the Mission. Hussey has since expressed regret about the entire incident.

According to some sources, with these releases, Eldritch allegedly won, over Hussey and Adams, a race for a £25,000 advance (a sum opening the song &quot;Jihad&quot; on the &quot;Gift&quot; album) offered by the publishers to the first member of the Sisters of Mercy to release any output. This would tie Eldritch to WEA and release Hussey and Adams from their contract with the same record company. According to the Mission&#x27;s manager Tony Perrin, the case never went to court, and Hussey&#x27;s new band was able to release their material through an independent outlet. However, Eldritch stated elsewhere that the &quot;2-5-0-0-0,&quot; which opens &quot;Jihad&quot; on the Sisterhood LP, represents the sum of money he won from the Mission in the civil courts. He stated in an interview recorded in Boston that the English courts did not recognize either his or the other members&#x27; legal right to the name &quot;the Sisterhood.&quot; He said the courts required a release for anybody to claim ownership of the band name, which was the motivation for the initial Sisterhood single. After that single had been released, Eldritch officially owned the name and could sue, which he did, winning £25,000 in the lawsuit.

===&quot;Floodland&quot; era (1987–1989)=== 
Left to his own devices, Eldritch recorded &quot;Floodland&quot;, marking a shift away from guitar-based rock toward atmospheric, Wagnerian rock and keyboard-oriented explorations pioneered on &quot;Gift&quot;. The album was produced by Eldritch and Larry Alexander, with contributions from Jim Steinman on two songs, one of which is &quot;This Corrosion&quot;. 

&quot;This Corrosion&quot; was a composition that Eldritch had already recorded (if not released) with his Sisterhood collaborators. The B-side featured &quot;Torch,&quot; the last song from the previous line-up. Then-manager Boyd Steemson maintained that the chart success was no surprise for the band. 

Eldritch later considered producer Steinman to have been more pivotal in securing funding for additional production than the songs themselves. 


The band did not perform live during this period but did mime on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, among other shows. &quot;This Corrosion,&quot; &quot;Dominion,&quot; and &quot;Lucretia My Reflection&quot; were released as singles, with their videos compiled in the 1988 VHS release &quot;Shot&quot;, alongside a video for &quot;1959.&quot;

===&quot;Vision Thing&quot; era (1989–1993)=== 
The next incarnation of the Sisters of Mercy featured an unknown German guitarist, Andreas Bruhn, whom Eldritch allegedly discovered playing in a Hamburg pub and brought into the band in April 1989. Joining him were bassist Tony James, former guitarist of Sigue Sigue Sputnik and bassist/songwriter for Generation X, and last-minute recruit Tim Bricheno, formerly of All About Eve, on guitars. The new line-up kicked off with the &quot;Vision Thing&quot; album, released in October 1990, produced by Eldritch (one song, the single &quot;More,&quot; was a co-production and co-written with Steinman). The album also featured guitarist John Perry, with backing vocals by Maggie Reilly. The title is derived from a quotation by then-Vice President George Bush in 1987 and marked another change of direction, this time toward guitar-oriented rock. 

The band launched a world tour from 1990 to 1991 to promote the album. In 1991, they organized a controversial North American tour in a double act with Public Enemy. Fearing a clash between the predominantly white fans of the Sisters and the primarily Black following of Public Enemy, several cities banned the performances, leading to the tour being canceled halfway through. Late in 1991, bassist James left the group to pursue a solo career, and the band continued by using a pre-recorded backing track. The US tour fiasco did not help the already strained relationship between Eldritch and the Sisters&#x27; new record company EastWest, a WEA subsidiary (the band was assigned to it in 1989 following an internal shuffle within WEA). Conflicts with WEA led to the termination of the band&#x27;s US record distribution deal circa 1991–92, meaning later recordings became available in the US only as imports. 

Under the insistence of the record company, the band re-recorded their early single &quot;Temple of Love&quot; (with Ofra Haza on additional vocals and Tony James on bass) to promote the collection of their early independently released singles, entitled &quot;Some Girls Wander By Mistake&quot; (1992). Early in the year, the band performed the track on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; with Haza and Tony James, marking the final time the recording line-up for *Vision Thing* shared the stage.

In June 1992, Eldritch dismissed Boyd Steemson, the band&#x27;s manager for ten years. 

Around this time, Bricheno began focusing on his other band, XC-NN (originally, CNN). Meanwhile, Bruhn released his debut solo album, &quot;Broon&quot;. Bruhn claimed that the songs on the album were offered for the next Sisters release, only to be rejected by Eldritch. Eldritch denied these allegations, stating he was never offered the songs. 

Bricheno left by the end of the year and was replaced in 1993 by Adam Pearson. Pearson was the only guitarist on the single &quot;Under the Gun,&quot; which also featured former Berlin lead vocalist Terri Nunn on backing vocals. The track was co-produced by Billie Hughes, co-writer of the song. The single was recorded to promote the &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilation, &quot;A Slight Case of Overbombing&quot; (1993). A third video album, &quot;Shot Rev 2.0&quot;, was also released, containing all videos from the original &quot;Shot&quot; in 1988, the videos for the &quot;Vision Thing&quot; singles &quot;More,&quot; &quot;Doctor Jeep,&quot; as well as the videos for &quot;Under the Gun,&quot; the 1992 re-recording of &quot;Temple of Love,&quot; and a video for the album track &quot;Detonation Boulevard.&quot; Bruhn left the band in 1993. These releases turned out to be the last commercial recordings until the 2021 release of the &quot;BBC sessions 1982-1984&quot; on vinyl for RSD and CD, containing the 1982 and 1984 Peel Sessions and the 1983 David &#x27;Kid&#x27; Jensen session.

===Feud with EastWest Records and continued activity (1993–2005)=== 
Following their last concerts in December 1993, the Sisters of Mercy entered what Eldritch referred to as a &quot;strike against EastWest.&quot; He was reported to have been preoccupied with legal matters surrounding the band; although Eldritch has never clarified the meaning behind this, various parties have suggested that the issues stemmed from either the short-lived tour with Public Enemy in 1991 or Eldritch&#x27;s ongoing disputes with EastWest Records, as the band still owed them two original studio albums. 

In 1995, Eldritch remixed two songs for the German group Die Krupps and appeared on the Sarah Brightman single &quot;A Question of Honour&quot;. 

Eldritch&#x27;s associates approached Gary Marx, a co-founding member, to write tracks for a new studio album. Marx then met with Eldritch, and the two agreed upon the terms under which the backing tracks would be produced. After Marx delivered a total of eleven tracks, Eldritch backed out of the project &quot;without uttering a single word.&quot; 

In 1996, the band was revived for several gigs supporting the Sex Pistols, with Bruhn&#x27;s place initially taken by Chris Sheehan. During subsequent tours, the guitarist position rotated between Sheehan and Mike Varjak. 

In late 1997, the contract with EastWest was terminated after the company agreed to accept material recorded under the SSV name instead of the two albums for which the Sisters of Mercy had contractual obligations. The company consented to accept the material (techno-like droning featuring mumbling vocals by Andrew Eldritch, without drums) without listening to it first. The recordings were never officially released and circulated only through pirate MP3s.

Following the release, the official Sisters of Mercy website contained the same &quot;update&quot; for several years: 

===Recent history, developments and ongoing touring activity (2005–present)=== 
In 2005, The Sisters of Mercy recruited Chris Catalyst as a guitarist, followed by the addition of Ben Christo on guitar in 2006. Christo recalled, &quot;I got a call one afternoon from an unknown number. With very little preamble, the caller, without introducing himself, stated, ‘We might want you to be in our band.&#x27;&quot; Subsequently, in 2006, The Sisters of Mercy embarked on a world tour that spanned North America, Europe, and South America. The band has maintained an active touring schedule, performing at headline shows and music festivals almost every year, showcasing both released and unreleased material. 

In 2019, frustrated with Eldritch&#x27;s slow-paced work ethic, Catalyst left the band. Shortly thereafter, Australian guitarist Dylan Smith was recruited. 

In 2023, Smith was dismissed on the first day of their Autumn European tour. Consequently, Kai from Esprit D&#x27;Air was quickly recruited mid-tour as their new guitarist. In the same year, Chris Catalyst rejoined the band, taking on the role of the Doktor Avalanche operator. 

In 2024, The Sisters of Mercy announced an upcoming North American tour scheduled for Autumn, with performances planned across the USA and Canada.

====Possible fourth studio album==== 

In October 2006, Side-Line Music Magazine announced that the band was in talks with the Universal sublabel W14 Music. In the same year, three Sisters of Mercy reissues were released on 3 November in Europe (and 30 October in the USA) via WEA International: &quot;First and Last and Always&quot; (1985), &quot;Floodland&quot; (1987), and &quot;Vision Thing&quot; (1990). All contained bonus tracks taken from related single releases. 

The Sisters of Mercy have not released new recorded material since 1993. In 2010, Eldritch confirmed that he saw no reason to release an album in an interview with &quot;Classic Rock&quot; contributor Joel McIver. In August 2010, when asked to elaborate, Eldritch cited time constraints and a lack of available material as some of the issues involved. 

Speculation about a new release was renewed in November 2016 when Eldritch mentioned he might release a new album if Donald Trump were elected president: &quot;I don&#x27;t think I could keep quiet if that happened.&quot; The band has yet to release any new material, but in 2017 they embarked on a European tour in August and September. The band has performed thirteen new songs during concerts held between 2019 and 2024, such as &quot;There&#x27;s a Door&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Drive on Ice&quot;, &quot;I Will Call You&quot;, &quot;Show Me (On the Doll)&quot;, &quot;When I&#x27;m on Fire&quot;, &quot;On the Beach&quot;, &quot;But Genevieve&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s a Monster&quot;, &quot;Here&quot; and &quot;Quantum Baby&quot;, but no studio recordings have been made available. Since 2012, some of the shows have featured a guest appearance by the Irish singer Lisa Cuthbert, who performs her cover version of &quot;This Corrosion&quot; on piano.

==Influences==
Eldritch cited the Psychedelic Furs, Slade, Pere Ubu, and David Bowie as his primary influences; and noted Motörhead, the Cramps, and Siouxsie and the Banshees among his early influences. 

According to Jennifer Park, the band has also mentioned Leonard Cohen, Hawkwind, Gary Glitter, Lou Reed, the Velvet Underground, Iggy and the Stooges, Suicide, the Birthday Party, and the Fall as additional influences.

While the band enjoys a considerable fan base with overlapping interests in so-called dark culture, the Sisters of Mercy consider themselves first and foremost a rock band. They have consistently discouraged associations with &quot;goth&quot; through regular public statements in the press and stipulations in their standard contract riders. Nevertheless, this has not prevented them from regularly appearing at festivals featuring this genre of music, such as M&#x27;era Luna.

===Timeline===
===Line-ups===
===Doktor Avalanche===
The original incarnation of Doktor Avalanche was a BOSS DR-55 (&quot;Doctor Rhythm&quot;); the Doktor was later replaced by a Roland TR-606, soon followed by a TR-808, and, briefly, a TR-909. On one album, &quot;First and Last and Always&quot;, an Oberheim DMX bore the Doktor name.

With increased financial resources from sale of the album, the Doktor was upgraded to a Yamaha RX5, and subsequently reinforced by Akai S900 and S1000 samplers. An Akai S3200 has been used as studio equipment. Soon after, the first digital Doktor appeared in the form of a set of Compaq portable PCs, which had to be scrapped when it became impossible to maintain them because of a lack of spare parts.

In recent years the &quot;Digital Doktor&quot; has been moved to a custom-built laptop designed by Eldritch and constructed by an English military software and hardware company. For a time there was some division in the band whether or not the Doktor should be moved to a Mac running Logic or remain as is.

In a 2011 interview with a New Zealand radio station, Eldritch said Doktor Avalanche was now a MacBook Pro laptop running Steinberg Cubase.

Doktor Avalanche also &quot;runs&quot; the on-line advice column on the group&#x27;s website.

<text>Vladimir Vladimirovich Mayakovsky (; – 14 April 1930) was a Russian poet, playwright, artist, and actor. 
During his early, pre-Revolution period leading into 1917, Mayakovsky became renowned as a prominent figure of the Russian Futurist movement. He co-signed the Futurist manifesto, &quot;A Slap in the Face of Public Taste&quot; (1913), and wrote such poems as &quot;A Cloud in Trousers&quot; (1915) and &quot;Backbone Flute&quot; (1916). Mayakovsky produced a large and diverse body of work during the course of his career: he wrote poems, wrote and directed plays, appeared in films, edited the art journal &quot;LEF&quot;, and produced agitprop posters in support of the Communist Party during the Russian Civil War of 1917–1922.

Though Mayakovsky&#x27;s work regularly demonstrated ideological and patriotic support for the ideology of the Bolsheviks and a strong admiration of Vladimir Lenin, his relationship with the Soviet state was always complex and often tumultuous. Mayakovsky often found himself engaged in confrontation with the increasing involvement of the Soviet state in cultural censorship and the development of the State doctrine of Socialist realism. Works that criticized or satirized aspects of the Soviet system, such as the poem &quot;Talking With the Taxman About Poetry&quot; (1926), and the plays &quot;The Bedbug&quot; (1929) and &quot;The Bathhouse&quot; (1929), met with scorn from the Soviet state and literary establishment.

In 1930, Mayakovsky committed suicide. Even after death, his relationship with the Soviet state remained unsteady. Though Mayakovsky had previously been harshly criticized by Soviet governmental bodies such as the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers, Premier Joseph Stalin described Mayakovsky after his death as &quot;the best and the most talented poet of our Soviet epoch&quot;.

==Life and career==

Vladimir Vladimirovich Mayakovsky was born in 1893 in Baghdati, Kutais Governorate, Georgia, then part of the Russian Empire, to Alexandra Alexeyevna (née Pavlenko), a housewife, and Vladimir Mayakovsky, a local forester. His father belonged to a noble family and was a distant relative of the writer Grigory Danilevsky. Vladimir Vladimirovich had two sisters, Olga and Lyudmila, and a brother Konstantin, who died at the age of three. The family was of Russian and Zaporozhian Cossack descent on their father&#x27;s side and Ukrainian on their mother&#x27;s. 
At home the family spoke Russian. With his friends and at school, Mayakovsky spoke Georgian. &quot;I was born in the Caucasus, my father is a Cossack, my mother is Ukrainian. My mother tongue is Georgian. Thus three cultures are united in me,&quot; he told the Prague newspaper &quot;Prager Presse&quot; in a 1927 interview. For Mayakovsky, Georgia was his eternal symbol of beauty. &quot;I know, it&#x27;s nonsense, Eden and Paradise, but since people sang about them // It must have been Georgia, the joyful land, that those poets were having in mind&quot;, he wrote later.

In 1902, Mayakovsky joined the Kutaisi gymnasium. Later as a 14-year-old, he took part in socialist demonstrations in the town of Kutaisi. His mother, aware of his activities, apparently did not mind. &quot;People around warned us we were giving a young boy too much freedom. But I saw him developing according to the new trends, sympathized with him and pandered to his aspirations,&quot; she later remembered. His father died suddenly in 1906, when Mayakovsky was thirteen. (The father pricked his finger on a rusty pin while filing papers and died of blood poisoning.) His widowed mother moved the family to Moscow after selling all their movable property.

In July 1906, Mayakovsky joined the 4th form of Moscow&#x27;s 5th Classic gymnasium and soon developed a passion for Marxist literature. &quot;Never cared for fiction. For me it was philosophy, Hegel, natural sciences, but first and foremost, Marxism. There&#x27;d be no higher art for me than &quot;The Foreword&quot; by Marx,&quot; he recalled in the 1920s in his autobiography &quot;I, Myself&quot;. In 1907 Mayakovsky became a member of his gymnasium&#x27;s underground Social Democrats&#x27; circle, taking part in numerous activities of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party which he, given the nickname &quot;Comrade Konstantin&quot;, joined the same year. In 1908, the boy was dismissed from the gymnasium because his mother was no longer able to afford the tuition fees. For two years he studied at the Stroganov School of Industrial Arts, where his sister Lyudmila had started her studies a few years earlier.

As a young Bolshevik activist, Mayakovsky distributed propaganda leaflets, possessed a pistol without a license, and in 1909 got involved in smuggling female political activists out of prison. This resulted in a series of arrests and finally an 11-month imprisonment. It was in solitary confinement in the Moscow Butyrka prison that Mayakovsky started writing verses for the first time. &quot;Revolution and poetry got entangled in my head and became one,&quot; he wrote in &quot;I, Myself&quot;. As a minor, Mayakovsky was spared a serious prison sentence (with associated deportation) and in January 1910 was released. A warden confiscated the young man&#x27;s notebook. Years later Mayakovsky conceded that was all for the better, yet he always cited 1909 as the year his literary career started.

Upon his release from prison, Mayakovsky remained an ardent Socialist, but realized his own inadequacy as a serious revolutionary. Having left the Party (never to re-join it), he concentrated on education. &quot;I stopped my Party activities. Sat down and started to learn… Now my intention was to make the Socialist art,&quot; he later remembered.

In 1911, Mayakovsky enrolled in the Moscow Art School. In September 1911 a brief encounter with fellow student David Burlyuk (which nearly ended with a fight) led to a lasting friendship and had historic consequences for the nascent Russian Futurist movement. Mayakovsky became an active member (and soon a spokesman) for the group (), which sought to free the arts from academic traditions: its members would read poetry on street corners, throw tea at their audiences, and make their public appearances an annoyance for the art establishment.

Burlyuk, on having heard Mayakovsky&#x27;s verses, declared him &quot;a genius poet&quot;. Later Soviet researchers tried to downplay the significance of the fact, but even after their friendship ended and their ways parted, Mayakovsky continued to give credit to his mentor, referring to him as &quot;my wonderful friend&quot;. &quot;It was Burlyuk who turned me into a poet. He read the French and the Germans to me. He pressed books on me. He would come and talk endlessly. He didn&#x27;t let me get away. He would subsidize me with 50 kopeks each day so that I&#x27;d write and not be hungry,&quot; Mayakovsky wrote in &quot;I, Myself&quot;.

===Literary career===

On 17 November 1912, Mayakovsky made his first public performance at Stray Dog, the artistic basement in Saint Petersburg. In December of that year his first published poems, &quot;Night&quot; () and &quot;Morning&quot; () appeared in the Futurists&#x27; Manifesto &quot;A Slap in the Face of Public Taste&quot;, signed by Mayakovsky, as well as Velemir Khlebnikov, David Burlyuk and Alexey Kruchenykh, calling among other things for... &quot;throwing Pushkin, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, etc, etc, off the steamboat of the modernity.&quot;

In October 1913, Mayakovsky gave the performance at the Pink Lantern café, reciting his new poem &quot;Take That!&quot; () for the first time. The concert at the Petersburg&#x27;s Luna-Park saw the premiere of the poetic monodrama &quot;Vladimir Mayakovsky&quot;, with the author in a leading role, stage decorations designed by Pavel Filonov and Iosif Shkolnik. In 1913 Mayakovsky&#x27;s first poetry collection called &quot;I&quot; () came out, its original limited edition 300 copies lithographically printed. This four-poem cycle, handwritten and illustrated by Vasily Tchekrygin and Leo Shektel, later formed Part One of the 1916 compilation &quot;Simple as Mooing&quot;.

In December 1913, Mayakovsky along with his fellow Futurist group members embarked on the Russian tour, which took them to 17 cities, including Simferopol, Sevastopol, Kerch, Odessa and Kishinev. It was a riotous affair. The audiences would go wild and often the police stopped the readings. The poets dressed outlandishly, and Mayakovsky, &quot;a regular scandal-maker&quot; in his own words, used to appear on stage in a self-made yellow shirt which became the token of his early stage persona. The tour ended on 13 April 1914 in Kaluga and cost Mayakovsky and Burlyuk their education: both were expelled from the Art school, their public appearances deemed incompatible with the school&#x27;s academic principles. They learned of it while in Poltava from the local police chief, who chose the occasion as a pretext to ban the Futurists from performing on stage.

Having won 65 rubles in a lottery, in May 1914, Mayakovsky went to Kuokkala, near Petrograd. Here he put the finishing touches to &quot;A Cloud in Trousers&quot;, frequented Korney Chukovsky&#x27;s dacha, sat for Ilya Repin&#x27;s painting sessions and met Maxim Gorky for the first time. As World War I began, Mayakovsky volunteered but was rejected as &#x27;politically unreliable&#x27;. He worked for the Lubok Today company which produced patriotic lubok pictures, and in the &quot;Nov&quot; (Virgin Land) newspaper, which published several of his anti-war poems (&quot;Mother and an Evening Killed by the Germans&quot;, &quot;The War is Declared&quot;, &quot;Me and Napoleon&quot; among others). In the summer of 1915 Mayakovsky moved to Petrograd where he started contributing to the &quot;New Satyrikon&quot; magazine, writing mostly humorous verse in the vein of Sasha Tchorny, one of the journal&#x27;s former stalwarts. Subsequently, Maxim Gorky invited the poet to work for his journal, &quot;Letopis&quot;.

In June of that year, Mayakovsky fell in love with a married woman, Lilya Brik, who eagerly took upon herself the role of a &#x27;muse&#x27;. Her husband Osip Brik seemed not to mind and became the poet&#x27;s close friend; later he published several books by Mayakovsky and used his entrepreneurial talents to support the Futurist movement. This love affair, as well as his ideas on World War I and Socialism, strongly influenced Mayakovsky&#x27;s best known works: &quot;A Cloud in Trousers&quot; (1915), his first major poem of appreciable length, followed by &quot;Backbone Flute&quot; (1915), &quot;The War and the World&quot; (1916) and &quot;The Man&quot; (1918).

When his mobilization form finally arrived in the autumn of 1915, Mayakovsky found himself unwilling to go to the frontlines. Assisted by Gorky, he joined the Petrograd Military Driving school as a draftsman and was studying there until early 1917. In 1916 Parus (The Sail) Publishers (again led by Gorky), published Mayakovsky&#x27;s poetry compilation called &quot;Simple As Mooing&quot;.

====1917–1927====

Mayakovsky embraced the Bolshevik Russian Revolution wholeheartedly and for a while even worked in Smolny, Petrograd, where he saw Vladimir Lenin. &quot;To accept or not to accept, there was no such question… [That was] my Revolution,&quot; he wrote in &quot;I, Myself&quot; autobiography. In November 1917 he took part in the Communist Party&#x27;s Central committee-sanctioned assembly of writers, painters and theatre directors who expressed their allegiance to the new political regime. In December that year &quot;The Left March&quot; (, 1918) premiered at the Navy Theater, with sailors as an audience.

In 1918, Mayakovsky started the short-lived &quot;Futurist Paper&quot;. He also starred in three silent films made at the Neptun Studios in Petrograd he had written scripts for. The only surviving one, &quot;The Lady and the Hooligan&quot;, was based on the &quot;La maestrina degli operai&quot; (&quot;The Workers&#x27; Young Schoolmistress&quot;) published in 1895 by Edmondo De Amicis, and directed by Evgeny Slavinsky. The other two, &quot;Born Not for the Money&quot; and &quot;Shackled by Film&quot; were directed by Nikandr Turkin and are presumed lost.

On 7 November 1918, Mayakovsky&#x27;s play &quot;Mystery-Bouffe&quot; premiered at the Petrograd Musical Drama Theatre. Representing a universal flood and the subsequent joyful triumph of the &quot;Unclean&quot; (the proletariat) over the &quot;Clean&quot; (the bourgeoisie), this satirical drama&#x27;s re-worked, 1921 version enjoyed even greater popular acclaim. However, the author&#x27;s attempt to make a film of the play failed, its language deemed &quot;incomprehensible for the masses.&quot;

In December 1918, Mayakovsky was involved with Osip Brik in discussions with the Viborg district party school of the Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) (RKP(b)) to set up a Futurist organisation affiliated to the party. Named Komfut, the organisation was formally founded in January 1919, but was swiftly dissolved following the intervention of Anatoly Lunacharsky.

In March 1919, Mayakovsky moved back to Moscow where &quot;Vladimir Mayakovsky&#x27;s Collected Works 1909–1919&quot; was released. The same month he started working for the Russian State Telegraph Agency (ROSTA) creating—both graphic and text— satirical Agitprop posters, aimed mostly at informing the country&#x27;s largely illiterate population of the current events. In the cultural climate of the early Soviet Union, his popularity grew rapidly, even if among the members of the first Bolshevik government, only Anatoly Lunacharsky supported him; others treated the Futurist art more skeptically. Mayakovsky&#x27;s 1921 poem, &quot;150 000 000&quot; failed to impress Lenin, who apparently saw in it little more than a formal futuristic experiment. More favourably received by the Soviet leader was his next one, &quot;Re Conferences&quot; which came out in April.

A vigorous spokesman for the Communist Party, Mayakovsky expressed himself in many ways. Contributing simultaneously to numerous Soviet newspapers, he poured out topical propagandistic verses and wrote didactic booklets for children while lecturing and reciting all over Russia.

In May 1922, after a performance at the House of Publishing at the charity auction collecting money for the victims of Povolzhye famine, he went abroad for the first time, visiting Riga, Berlin and Paris, where he was invited to the studios of Fernand Léger and Picasso. Several books, including &quot;The West&quot; and &quot;Paris&quot; cycles (1922–1925) were created as a result.
From 1922 to 1928, Mayakovsky was a prominent member of the Left Art Front (LEF) he helped to found (and coin its &quot;literature of fact, not fiction&quot; credo) and for a while defined his work as Communist Futurism (). He edited, along with Sergei Tretyakov and Osip Brik, the journal &quot;LEF&quot;, its stated objective being &quot;re-examining the ideology and practices of the so-called leftist art, rejecting individualism and increasing Art&#x27;s value for the developing Communism.&quot; The journal&#x27;s first, March 1923, issue featured Mayakovsky&#x27;s poem &quot;About That&quot; (). Regarded as a &quot;LEF&quot; manifesto, it soon came out as a book illustrated by Alexander Rodchenko who also used some photographs made by Mayakovsky and Lilya Brik.

In May 1923, Mayakovsky spoke at a massive protest rally in Moscow, in the wake of Vatslav Vorovsky&#x27;s assassination. In October 1924 he gave numerous public readings of the 3,000-line epic &quot;Vladimir Ilyich Lenin&quot; written on the death of the Soviet Communist leader. Next February it came out as a book, published by Gosizdat. Five years later Mayakovsky&#x27;s rendition of the third part of the poem, at the Lenin Memorial evening in the Bolshoi Theatre ended with 20-minutes ovation. In May 1925 Mayakovsky&#x27;s second trip took him to several European cities, then to the United States, Mexico and Cuba. In the US, he visited New York, Cleveland, Detroit, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia, and planned a trip to Boston that was never realized. His book of essays &quot;My Discovery of America&quot; came out later that year.

In January 1927, the first issue of the &quot;New LEF&quot; magazine came out, again under Mayakovsky&#x27;s supervision, now focusing on the documentary art. In all, 24 issues of it came out. In October 1927 Mayakovsky recited his new poem &quot;All Right!&quot; () for the audience of the Moscow Party conference activists in the Moscow&#x27;s Red Hall. In November 1927 a play called &quot;The 25th&quot; (and based upon the &quot;All Right!&quot; poem) premiered at the Leningrad Maly Opera Theatre. In summer 1928, disillusioned with LEF, he left both the organization and its magazine.

====1929–1930====

In 1929, the publishing house Goslitizdat released &quot;The Works by V. V. Mayakovsky&quot; in 4 volumes. In September 1929 the first assembly of the newly formed REF group gathered with Mayakovsky in the chair. But behind this façade the poet&#x27;s relationship with the Soviet literary establishment was quickly deteriorating. Both the REF-organized exhibition of Mayakovsky&#x27;s work, celebrating the 20th anniversary of his literary career and the parallel event in the Writers&#x27; Club, &quot;20 Years of Work&quot; in February 1930, were ignored by the RAPP members and, more importantly, the Party leadership, particularly Stalin whose attendance he was greatly anticipating. It was becoming evident that such experimental art was no longer welcomed by the regime, and that the country&#x27;s most famous poet was increasingly losing favor with the higher echelons of the Party.

Two of Mayakovsky&#x27;s satirical plays, written specifically for Meyerkhold Theatre, &quot;The Bedbug&quot; (1929) and (in particular) &quot;The Bathhouse&quot; (1930) evoked stormy criticism from the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers. In February 1930 Mayakovsky joined RAPP, but in Pravda on 9 March, a leading member of RAPP, Vladimir Yermilov, writing &quot;with all the authority of a 23 year old who had not seen the play but had read part of the script&quot; categorised Mayakovsky as one of the &#x27;petit bourgeois revolutionary intelligentsia&#x27;, adding that &quot;we hear a false &#x27;leftist&#x27; note in Mayakovsky, a note which we know not only from literature...&quot;. This was a potentially deadly political accusation, in that it implied an intellectual link between Mayakovsky and the Left Opposition, led by Leon Trotsky, whose supporters were in exile or prison. (Trotsky was known to admire Mayakovsky&#x27;s poetry). Mayakovsky retaliated by creating a huge poster mocking Yermilov, but was ordered by RAPP to take it down. In his suicide note Mayakovsky wrote &quot;Tell Yermilov we should have completed the argument.&quot;

The smear campaign continued in the Soviet press, sporting slogans like &quot;Down with Mayakovshchina!&quot; On 9 April 1930 Mayakovsky, reading his new poem &quot;At the Top of My Voice&quot;, was shouted down by the student audience, for being &#x27;too obscure&#x27;.

===Death===
On 12 April 1930, Mayakovsky was seen in public for the last time: he took part in a discussion at the Sovnarkom meeting concerning the proposed copyright law. On 14 April 1930, his current partner, actress Veronika Polonskaya, upon leaving his flat, heard a shot behind the closed door. She rushed in and found the poet lying on the floor; he had apparently shot himself through the heart. The handwritten death note read: &quot;To all of you. I die, but don&#x27;t blame anyone for it, and please do not gossip. The deceased disliked that sort of thing terribly. Mother, sisters, comrades, forgive me – this is not a good method (I do not recommend it to others), but there is no other way out for me. Lily – love me. Comrade Government, my family consists of Lily Brik, mama, my sisters, and Veronika Vitoldovna Polonskaya. If you can provide a decent life for them, thank you. Give the poem I started to the Briks. They&#x27;ll sort them out.&quot; The &#x27;unfinished poem&#x27; in his suicide note read, in part: &quot;And so they say – &quot;the incident dissolved&quot; / the love boat smashed up / on the dreary routine. / I&#x27;m through with life / and [we] should absolve / from mutual hurts, afflictions and spleen.&quot; Mayakovsky&#x27;s funeral on 17 April 1930, was attended by around 150,000, the third largest event of public mourning in Soviet history, surpassed only by those of Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin. He was interred at the Moscow Novodevichy Cemetery.

====Controversy surrounding death====

Mayakovsky&#x27;s suicide occurred after a dispute with Polonskaya, with whom he had a brief but unstable romance. Polonskaya, who was in love with the poet, but unwilling to leave her husband, was the last one to see Mayakovsky alive. But, as Lilya Brik stated in her memoirs, &quot;the idea of suicide was like a chronic disease inside him, and like any chronic disease it worsened under circumstances that, for him, were undesirable…&quot; According to Polonskaya, Mayakovsky mentioned suicide on 13 April, when the two were at Valentin Katayev&#x27;s place, but she thought he was trying to emotionally blackmail her and &quot;refused to believe for a second [he] could do such a thing.&quot;

The circumstances of Mayakovsky&#x27;s death became a matter of lasting controversy. It appeared that the suicide note had been written two days before his death. Soon after the poet&#x27;s death, Lilya and Osip Brik were hastily sent abroad. The bullet removed from his body didn&#x27;t match the model of his pistol, and his neighbors were later reported to say they&#x27;d heard two shots. Ten days later, the officer investigating the poet&#x27;s suicide was himself killed, fueling speculation about the nature of Mayakovsky&#x27;s death. Such speculation, often alluding to suspicion of murder by State services, especially intensified during the periods of first Krushchevian de-Stalinisation, later Glasnost, and Perestroika, as Soviet politicians sought to weaken Stalin&#x27;s reputation (or Brik&#x27;s, and by association, Stalin&#x27;s) and the positions of contemporary opponents. According to Chantal Sundaram:

===Private life===
Mayakovsky met husband and wife Osip and Lilya Brik in July 1915 at their dacha in Malakhovka nearby Moscow. Soon after that Lilya&#x27;s sister, Elsa Triolet, who&#x27;d had a brief affair with the poet before, invited him to the Briks&#x27; Petrograd flat. The couple at the time showed no interest in literature and were successful coral traders. That evening Mayakovsky recited the yet unpublished poem &quot;A Cloud in Trousers&quot; and announced it as dedicated to the hostess (&quot;For you, Lilya&quot;). &quot;That was the happiest day in my life&quot;, was how he referred to the episode in his autobiography years later. According to Lilya Brik&#x27;s memoirs, her husband too fell in love with the poet (&quot;How could I have possibly failed to fall for him, if Osya loved him so?&quot; – she once argued), whereas &quot;Volodya did not merely fall in love with me; he attacked me, it was an assault. For two and a half years I didn&#x27;t have a moment&#x27;s peace. I understood right away that Volodya was a genius, but I didn&#x27;t like him. I didn&#x27;t like clamorous people ... I didn&#x27;t like the fact that he was so tall and people in the street would stare at him; I was annoyed that he enjoyed listening to his own voice, I couldn&#x27;t even stand the name Mayakovsky ... sounding so much like a cheap pen name.&quot; Both Mayakovsky&#x27;s persistent adoration and rough appearance irritated her. It was, allegedly, to please her, that Mayakovsky attended a dentist, started to wear a bow tie and use a walking stick.

Soon after Osip Brik published &quot;A Cloud in Trousers&quot; in September 1915, Mayakovsky settled in the Palace Royal hotel at the Pushkinskaya Street, Petrograd, not far from where they lived. He introduced the couple to his Futurist friends and the Briks&#x27; flat quickly evolved into a modern literary salon. From then on Mayakovsky was dedicating every one of his large poems (with the obvious exception of &quot;Vladimir Ilyich Lenin&quot;) to Lilya; such dedications later started to appear even in the texts he had written before they met, much to her displeasure. In summer 1918, soon after Lilya and Vladimir starred in the film &quot;Encased in a Film&quot; (only fragments of which survived), Mayakovsky and the Briks moved in together. In March 1919 all three came to Moscow and in 1920 settled in a flat at the Gondrikov Lane, Taganka.

In 1920, Mayakovsky had a brief romance with Lilya Lavinskaya, an artist who also contributed to ROSTA. She gave birth to a son, (1921–1986), later a Soviet sculptor. In 1922 Lilya Brik fell in love with Alexander Krasnoshchyokov, the head of the Soviet Prombank. This affair resulted in the three months&#x27; rift, which was to some extent reflected in the poem &quot;About That&quot; (1923). Brik and Mayakovsky&#x27;s relationships ended in 1923, but they never parted. &quot;Now I am free from placards and love&quot;, he confessed in the poem called &quot;For the Jubilee&quot; (1924). Still, when in 1926 Mayakovsky was granted a state-owned flat at the Gendrikov Lane in Moscow, all three of them moved in and lived there until 1930, having turned the place into the LEF headquarters.

Mayakovsky continued to profess his devotion to Lilya whom he considered a family member. It was Brik who in the mid-1930s famously addressed Stalin with a personal letter which made all the difference in the way the poet&#x27;s legacy has been treated since in the USSR. Still, she had many detractors (among them Lyudmila Mayakovskaya, the poet&#x27;s sister) who regarded her as an insensitive femme-fatale and cynical manipulator, who had never been really interested in either Mayakovsky or his poetry. &quot;To me, she was a kind of monster. But Mayakovsky apparently loved her that way, armed with a whip&quot;, remembered poet Andrey Voznesensky who knew Lilya Brik personally. Literary critic and historian Viktor Shklovsky who resented what he saw as the Briks&#x27; exploitation of Mayakovsky both when he lived and after his death, once called them &quot;a family of corpse-mongers&quot;.

In summer 1925, Mayakovsky traveled to New York, where he met Russian émigré Elli Jones, born Yelizaveta Petrovna Zibert, an interpreter who spoke Russian, French, German and English fluently. They fell in love, for three months were inseparable, but decided to keep their affair secret. Soon after the poet&#x27;s return to the Soviet Union, Elli gave birth to daughter Patricia. Mayakovsky saw the girl just once, in Nice, France, in 1928, when she was three. 

Patricia Thompson, a professor of philosophy and women&#x27;s studies at Lehman College in New York City, is the author of the book &quot;Mayakovsky in Manhattan&quot;, in which she told the story of her parents&#x27; love affair, relying on her mother&#x27;s unpublished memoirs and their private conversations prior to her death in 1985. Thompson traveled to Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union, looking for her roots, was welcomed there with respect and since then started to use her Russian name, Yelena Vladimirovna Mayakovskaya.

In 1928, in Paris Mayakovsky met Russian émigré Tatyana Yakovleva, a 22-year-old model working for the Chanel fashion house, and niece of painter Alexandre Jacovleff. He fell in love madly and wrote two poems dedicated to her, &quot;Letter to Comrade Kostrov on the Essence of Love&quot; and &quot;Letter to Tatiana Yakovleva&quot;. Some argued that, since it was Elsa Triolet (Lilya&#x27;s sister) who acquainted them, the liaison might have been the result of Brik&#x27;s intrigue, aimed at stopping the poet from getting closer to Elli Jones and especially daughter Patricia, but the power of this passion apparently caught her by surprise.

Mayakovsky tried to persuade Tatyana to return to Russia but she refused. In late 1929, he made an attempt to travel to Paris in order to marry his lover but was refused a visa for the first time, again, as many believed, due to Lilya&#x27;s making full use of her numerous &quot;connections&quot;. It became known that she &quot;accidentally&quot; read out a letter from Paris to Mayakovsky, alleging that Tatiana was getting married, even though, as it turned out soon, the latter&#x27;s wedding was not on the agenda at that very moment. Lydia Chukovskaya insisted it was the &quot;ever-powerful Yakov Agranov, another one of Lilya&#x27;s lovers&quot; who prevented Mayakovsky obtaining a visa, upon her request.

In the late 1920s, Mayakovsky had two more affairs, with student (later &quot;Goslitizdat&quot; editor) Natalya Bryukhanenko (1905–1984) and with Veronika Polonskaya (1908–1994), a young MAT actress, then the wife of actor Mikhail Yanshin.

It was Veronika&#x27;s unwillingness to divorce the latter that resulted in her rows with Mayakovsky, the last of which preceded the poet&#x27;s suicide. Yet, according to Natalya Bryukhanenko, it was not Polonskaya but Yakovleva whom he was pining for. &quot;In January 1929 Mayakovsky [told me] he … would put a bullet to his brain if he didn&#x27;t see that woman any time soon&quot;, she later remembered. Which, on 14 April 1930, he did.

==Works and critical reception==

Mayakovsky&#x27;s early poems established him as one of the more original poets to come out of the Russian Futurism, a movement rejecting the traditional poetry in favour of formal experimentation, and welcoming the social change promised by modern technology. His 1913 verses, surreal, seemingly disjointed and nonsensical, relying on forceful rhythms and exaggerated imagery with the words split into pieces and staggered across the page, peppered with street language, were considered unpoetic in literary circles at the time. While the confrontational aesthetics of his fellow Futurist group members&#x27; poetry were mostly confined to formal experiments, Mayakovsky&#x27;s idea was creating the new, &quot;democratic language of the streets&quot;.

In 1914, his first large work, an avant-garde tragedy &quot;Vladimir Mayakovsky&quot; came out. The fierce critique of the city life and capitalism in general was, at the same time, a paean to the modern industrial power, featuring the protagonist sacrificing himself for the sake of the people&#x27;s happiness in the future.

In September 1915, &quot;A Cloud in Trousers&quot; came out, Mayakovsky&#x27;s first major poem of appreciable length; it depicted the subjects of love, revolution, religion and art, written from the vantage point of a spurned lover. The language of the work was the language of the streets, and Mayakovsky went to considerable lengths to debunk idealistic and romanticized notions of poetry and poets.
&quot;Backbone Flute&quot; (1916) outraged contemporary critics. Its author has been described as &quot;talentless charlatan,&quot; spurning &quot;empty words of a malaria sufferer&quot;; some even recommended that he&#x27;d &quot;be hospitalized immediately.&quot; In retrospect it is seen as a groundbreaking piece, introducing the new forms of expressing social anger and personal frustrations.


The period from 1917 to 1921 was a fruitful one for Mayakovsky, who greeted the Bolshevik Revolution with a number of poetic and dramatic works, starting with &quot;Ode to the Revolution&quot; (1918) and &quot;Left March&quot; (1918), a hymn to the proletarian might, calling for the fight against the &quot;enemies of the revolution.&quot; &quot;Mystery-Bouffe&quot; (1918; revised version, 1921), the first Soviet play, told the story of a new Noah&#x27;s Ark, built by the &quot;unclean&quot; (workers and peasants) sporting &quot;moral cleanness&quot; and &quot;united by the class solidarity.&quot;

From 1919 to 1921, Mayakovsky worked for the Russian Telegraph Agency (ROSTA). Painting posters and cartoons, he provided them with rhymes and slogans (mixing rhythm patterns, different typesetting styles, and using neologisms) which were describing the currents events in dynamics. In three years he produced some 1100 pieces he called &quot;ROSTA Windows&quot;.

In 1921, Mayakovsky&#x27;s poem &quot;150 000 000&quot; came out, which hailed the Russian people&#x27;s mission in igniting the world revolution, but failed to impress Lenin. The latter praised the 1922 poem &quot;Re Conferences&quot; (), a scathing satire on the nascent Soviet bureaucracy starting to eat up the apparently flawed state system.

Mayakovsky&#x27;s poetry was saturated with politics, but the love theme in the early 1920s became prominent too, mainly in &quot;I Love&quot; (1922) and &quot;About That&quot; (1923), both dedicated to Lilya Brik, whom he considered a family member even after the two drifted apart, in 1923. In October 1924 appeared &quot;Vladimir Ilyich Lenin&quot; written on the death of the Soviet Communist leader. While the newspapers reported of highly successful public performances, the Soviet literary critics had their reservations, G. Lelevich calling it &quot;cerebral and rhetorical,&quot; Viktor Pertsov described it as wordy, naïve and clumsy.

Mayakovsky&#x27;s extensive foreign trips resulted in the books of poetry (&quot;The West&quot;, 1922–1924; &quot;Paris&quot;, 1924–1925: &quot;Poems About America&quot;, 1925–1926), as well as a set of analytical satirical essays.

In 1926, Mayakovsky wrote and published &quot;Talking with the Taxman about Poetry&quot;, the first in a series of works criticizing the new Soviet philistinism, the result of the New Economic Policy. His 1927 epic &quot;All Right!&quot; sought to unite heroic pathos with lyricism and irony. Extoling the new Bolshevik Russia as &quot;the springtime of the human kind&quot; it was praised by Lunacharsky as &quot;the October Revolution set in bronze.&quot;

During the last three years of his life, Mayakovsky completed two satirical plays: &quot;The Bedbug&quot; (1929), and &quot;The Bathhouse&quot;, both lampooning bureaucratic stupidity and opportunism. The latter was extolled by Vsevolod Meyerhold who rated it as high as the best work of Moliere, Pushkin and Gogol and called it &quot;the greatest phenomenon of the history of the Russian theatre.&quot; The fierce criticism both plays were met with in the Soviet press was overstated and politically charged, but still, in retrospect Mayakovsky&#x27;s work in the 1920s is regarded as patchy, even &quot;Vladimir Ilyich Lenin&quot; and &quot;All Right!&quot; being inferior to his passionate and innovative 1910s work. Several authors, among them Valentin Katayev and close friend Boris Pasternak, reproached him for squandering enormous potential on petty propaganda. Marina Tsvetayeva in her 1932 essay &quot;The Art in the Light of Conscience&quot; left a particularly sharp comment on Mayakovsky&#x27;s death: &quot;For twelve years Mayakovsky the man has been destroying Mayakovsky the poet. On the thirteenth year the Poet rose up and killed the man… His suicide lasted twelve years, not for a moment he pulled the trigger.&quot;

==Legacy==
After Mayakovsky&#x27;s death the Association of the Proletarian Writers&#x27; leadership made sure the publications of the poet&#x27;s work were cancelled and his very name stopped being mentioned in the Soviet press. In her 1935 letter to Joseph Stalin, Lilya Brik challenged her opponents, asking personally the Soviet leader for help. Stalin&#x27;s resolution inscribed upon this message, read:Comrade Yezhov, please take charge of Brik&#x27;s letter. Mayakovsky is the best and the most talented poet of our Soviet epoch. Indifference to his cultural heritage amounts to a crime. Brik&#x27;s complaints are, in my opinion, justified...

The effect of this letter was startling. Mayakovsky was instantly hailed a Soviet classic, proving to be the only member of the artistic avant-garde of the early 20th century to enter the Soviet mainstream. His birthplace of Baghdati in Georgia was renamed Mayakovsky in his honour. In 1937 the Mayakovsky Museum (and library) were opened in Moscow. Triumphal Square in Moscow became Mayakovsky Square. In 1938 the Mayakovskaya Metro Station was opened to the public. Nikolay Aseyev received a Stalin prize in 1941 for his poem &quot;Mayakovsky Starts Here&quot;, which celebrated him as a poet of the revolution. In 1974 the Russian State Museum of Mayakovsky opened in the center of Moscow in the building where Mayakovsky resided from 1919 to 1930.

As a result, for the Soviet readership Mayakovsky became just &quot;the poet of the Revolution&quot;. His legacy has been censored, more intimate or controversial pieces ignored, lines taken out of contexts and turned into slogans (like the omnipresent &quot;Lenin lived, Lenin lives, Lenin shall live forever&quot;). The major rebel of his generation was turned into a symbol of the repressive state. The Stalin-sanctioned ization dealt Mayakovsky a second death, according to Boris Pasternak, as the communist authorities &quot;started to impose him forcibly, like Catherine the Great did with potatoes.&quot;
In the late 1950s and early 1960s Mayakovsky&#x27;s popularity in the Soviet Union started to rise again, with the new generation of writers recognizing him as a purveyor of artistic freedom and daring experimentation. &quot;Mayakovsky&#x27;s face is etched on the altar of the century,&quot; Pasternak wrote at that time. Young poets, drawn to avant-garde art and activism that often clashed with communist dogma, chose Mayakovsky&#x27;s statue in Moscow for their organized poetry readings.

Among the Soviet authors he influenced were Valentin Kataev, Andrey Voznesensky (who called Mayakovsky a teacher and favorite poet and dedicated a poem to him entitled &quot;Mayakovsky in Paris&quot;) and Yevgeny Yevtushenko. In 1967 the Taganka Theater staged the poetical performance &quot;Listen Here!&quot; (), based on Mayakovsky&#x27;s works with the leading role given to Vladimir Vysotsky, who was also much inspired by Mayakovsky&#x27;s poetry.

Mayakovsky became well-known and studied outside of the USSR. Poets such as Nâzım Hikmet, Louis Aragon and Pablo Neruda acknowledged having been influenced by his work. He was the most influential futurist in Lithuania and his poetry helped to form the &quot;Four Winds&quot; movement there. Mayakovsky was a significant influence on American poet Frank O&#x27;Hara. O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s 1957 poem &quot;Mayakovsky&quot;(1957) contains many references to Mayakovsky&#x27;s life and works, in addition to &quot;A True Account of Talking to the Sun at Fire Island&quot; (1958), a variation on Mayakovsky&#x27;s &quot;An Extraordinary Adventure that Happened to Vladimir Mayakovsky One Summer at a Dacha&quot; (1920). 1986 English singer and songwriter Billy Bragg recorded the album &quot;Talking with the Taxman about Poetry&quot;, named after Mayakovsky&#x27;s poem of the same name. In 2007 Craig Volk&#x27;s stage bio-drama &quot;Mayakovsky Takes the Stage&quot; (based on his screenplay &quot;At the Top of My Voice&quot;) won the PEN-USA Literary Award for Best Stage Drama.

In the Soviet Union&#x27;s final years there was a strong tendency to view Mayakovsky&#x27;s work as dated and insignificant; there were even calls for banishing his poems from school textbooks. Yet on the basis of his best works, Mayakovsky&#x27;s reputation was revived and attempts have been made (by authors like Yuri Karabchiyevsky) to recreate an objective picture of his life and legacy. Mayakovsky was credited as a radical reformer of the Russian poetic language who created his own linguistic system charged with the new kind of expressionism, which in many ways influenced the development of Soviet and world poetry. The &quot;raging bull of Russian poetry,&quot; &quot;the wizard of rhyming,&quot; &quot;an individualist and a rebel against established taste and standards,&quot; Mayakovsky is seen by many in Russia as a revolutionary force and a giant rebel in the 20th century Russian literature.

Bernd Alois Zimmermann included his poetry in his &quot;Requiem für einen jungen Dichter&quot; (&quot;Requiem for a Young Poet&quot;), completed in 1969.

There is a Mayakovsky monument in Kyrgyzstan, in a former Soviet sanatorium outside the capital Bishkek.

Poet Yegor Letov dedicated a poem titled &quot;Self-withdrawal&quot; to his suicide and has included verses of his in his poetry.

<text>Batman Fights Drácula is a 1967 Filipino superhero film directed by Leody M. Diaz and scripted by Bert R. Mendoza. The film, which was not authorized by DC, is thought to be lost.

==Plot==
The story concerned the mad scientist named Dr. Zorba who, after repeatedly being defeated by Batman, finds a way to resurrect the wicked Count Dracula, control him, and even make him stronger, rendering him invincible towards traditional ways of killing him, such as Christian crosses.

Dracula sneaks into the Batcave, and attacks Batman. Batman attempts to use holy water and a cross to injure the vampire, but due to Zorba&#x27;s machinations, they have no effect. Dracula throws Batman against a wall and then flees, leaving Batman knocked out. When the unconscious Batman is found by his butler, Turko (a character based on Alfred Pennyworth), he tends to the crime fighter&#x27;s wounds and then calls for Batman&#x27;s girlfriend and sidekick to aid in tracking down his attacker.

After tracking down Zorba at his underground fortress, Ruben (a character based on the existing sidekick Robin) and the beautiful Marita manage to kill the evil doctor by turning the vampire against him. The vampire then is investigated by a recovering Batman within a cage in the Batcave, and the film ends with Batman lecturing Dracula about justice.

==Credited cast==
* Jing Abalos as Batman/Bruce Mabuto
* Ramon d&#x27;Salva as Dr. Zorba
* Vivian Lorrain as Marita Banzon
* Nort Nepomuceno as Alan &quot;Turko&quot; Turkentop

<text>Stephen Gregory Yzerman ( ; born May 9, 1965) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player currently serving as executive vice president and general manager of the Detroit Red Wings, with whom he spent all 22 seasons of his NHL playing career. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, he is a Detroit sports icon and a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame. After his retirement as a player, he served in the front office of the Red Wings, and then as general manager of the Tampa Bay Lightning, while also being executive director for Team Canada in two Olympics.

Prior to the 1986–87 season, at age 21, Yzerman was named captain of the Red Wings and continuously served for the next two decades (dressing as captain for over 1,300 games), retiring as the longest-serving captain of any team in North American major league sports history. Once voted to be the most popular athlete in Detroit sports history, locals often simply refer to Yzerman as &quot;Stevie Y&quot;, &quot;Stevie Wonder&quot;, or &quot;The Captain&quot;. Yzerman led the Wings to five first-place regular season finishes and three Stanley Cup championships (1997, 1998 and 2002).

Yzerman won numerous awards during his career, including the Lester B. Pearson Award (Most outstanding player) in the 1988–89 season, the Conn Smythe Trophy (Most Valuable Player of the Stanley Cup playoffs) in 1998, the Selke Trophy as the league&#x27;s best defensive forward in 2000 and the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for perseverance in 2003. He played in ten All-Star Games, and was a first team All-Star in 2000 and a member of the All-Rookie Team in 1984.

On July 3, 2006, Yzerman officially retired from professional hockey, finishing his career ranked as the sixth all-time leading scorer in NHL history, having scored a career-high 155 points (65 goals and 90 assists) in 1988–89, which has been bettered only by Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux. Yzerman&#x27;s #19 jersey was retired on January 2, 2007, during a pre-game ceremony at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit. On November 4, 2008, he was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame. He also became an honoured member of the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2009, his first year of eligibility, inducted alongside 2001–02 Red Wing teammates Brett Hull and Luc Robitaille. In 2017, Yzerman was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest NHL Players&quot; in history.

On September 25, 2006, Yzerman was named as a vice president and alternate governor of the Red Wings, winning a fourth Stanley Cup championship as an executive in 2007–08. In May 2010, he left the Red Wings organization to become general manager of the Tampa Bay Lightning, serving in that capacity until September 2018. On April 19, 2019, Yzerman was named the general manager of the Red Wings.

Yzerman has represented his country in several international tournaments as a member of Canada&#x27;s national hockey team (Team Canada). In 2002, Yzerman won an Olympic gold medal, making him one of few players to win an Olympic gold medal and the Stanley Cup in the same year. Yzerman was the general manager of Team Canada for the 2007 IIHF World Championship, which they won. Yzerman was appointed executive director of Team Canada on October 7, 2008, for the 2010 Winter Olympics. Team Canada went on to win the gold medal by defeating the United States. Yzerman was again appointed executive director of Team Canada on March 5, 2012, for the 2014 Winter Olympics. Canada went on to win their second-straight gold medal after defeating Sweden. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2014.

==Playing career==

===Early years in Detroit (1983–1986)===
Yzerman was born in Cranbrook, British Columbia. As a youth, he played in the 1977 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Nepean, Ontario. He attended Bell High School and played for his hometown Nepean Raiders Junior A hockey team. After one season with the Raiders, the Peterborough Petes of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) drafted him, and he played centre for the Petes from 1981 to 1983.

The 1983 NHL Entry Draft was the first for Mike and Marian Ilitch, who had purchased the Detroit Red Wings in the summer of 1982. Jim Devellano, the Red Wings&#x27; general manager at the time, wanted to draft Pat LaFontaine, who had grown up outside Detroit and played his junior hockey in the area. However, when the New York Islanders selected LaFontaine third overall, Devellano &quot;settled&quot; on Yzerman, drafting him fourth.

The Red Wings were prepared to send Yzerman back to Peterborough for one more year, but &quot;after one (training camp) session, you knew he was a tremendous hockey player&quot;, said Ken Holland, the former Red Wings general manager who was then a minor league goaltender for the Wings during Yzerman&#x27;s rookie training camp. Yzerman tallied 39 goals and 87 points in his rookie season and finished second in Calder Memorial Trophy voting. That season, Yzerman also became the first 18-year-old and youngest player to play in an NHL All-Star Game (18 years, 267 days) since the current format was adopted in 1969. This stood as an NHL record for 27 years until Jeff Skinner broke it by eight days.

===Rise to stardom (1986–1996)===
Following the departure of Red Wings captain Danny Gare during the 1985–86 season, Red Wings head coach Jacques Demers named Yzerman captain of the team on October 7, 1986, making him the youngest captain in the team&#x27;s history. Demers said he &quot;wanted a guy with the Red Wings crest tattooed on his chest&quot;. During the next season, Yzerman scored his then-career high 50th goal against the Buffalo Sabres on March 1, 1988. However, during the same game, Yzerman suffered a knee injury which caused him to miss the rest of the regular season. Despite his absence, the Red Wings would win their first division title in 23 years.

During the 1988–89 season, Yzerman recorded 155 points (65 goals and 90 assists), finishing third in regular season scoring behind Mario Lemieux and Wayne Gretzky. He won the Lester B. Pearson Award, the MVP as voted by the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association, and was a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy, the MVP as voted by the NHL writers.

When Scotty Bowman took over as head coach in 1993, Yzerman initially chafed under Bowman&#x27;s stern coaching style. Bowman, for his part, felt that Yzerman was not concentrating enough on defence; Bowman had long expected his forwards to be good back-checkers as well. Relations between the two became so strained that at one point, the Red Wings seriously considered trading him to the Ottawa Senators. However, Yzerman gradually became a better defender and was considered one of the best two-way forwards in the history of the game.

In 1995, Yzerman led Detroit to its first appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals since 1966, but the Red Wings were swept by the New Jersey Devils. The next season saw Detroit finish with a then NHL-record 62 regular season wins and were heavily favoured to win the Stanley Cup. Yzerman scored perhaps the most memorable goal of his career in the 1996 playoffs, stealing the puck from Wayne Gretzky and beating St. Louis Blues goaltender Jon Casey with a slap shot from the blue line to win the Western Conference Semifinals in double overtime of Game 7. However, the Red Wings fell short of their ultimate goal, losing in six games to the Colorado Avalanche in the Western Conference Finals.

===Stanley Cup titles (1996–2002)===
In 1997, Yzerman put to rest all doubts of his ability to lead a team to a championship as Detroit won its first Stanley Cup in 42 years after sweeping the Philadelphia Flyers. The following year, Detroit repeated the feat, sweeping the Washington Capitals and winning their second consecutive Cup title. Yzerman earned the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP. He handed the Cup first to Vladimir Konstantinov, who had been severely injured in a car accident just six days after the Cup victory in 1997 and was using a wheelchair.

On November 26, 1999, Yzerman became the 11th player in NHL history to score 600 goals. In 2000, he made the NHL All-Star first team and won the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the league&#x27;s top defensive forward.
In 2001–02, Yzerman re-aggravated a knee injury, forcing him to miss 30 regular season games, though nonetheless still finished sixth in team scoring. Yzerman&#x27;s knee greatly pained him during the 2002 playoffs, but this did not stop him from leading the Red Wings from an early 2–0 deficit in their opening round series to defeat the Vancouver Canucks and St. Louis Blues en route to Detroit&#x27;s fifth playoff series with Colorado, and the third time the two teams had battled to decide the Western Conference Championship. Detroit defeated Colorado in a seven-game series and moved on to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they defeated the Carolina Hurricanes to win their tenth Stanley Cup championship in their history. Rather than raising the Stanley Cup first, Yzerman passed the Cup to head coach Scotty Bowman, who announced his retirement following the game.

===Final years (2003–2006)===
During the offseason, Yzerman underwent a knee realignment surgery known as an osteotomy. He missed the first 61 games of the 2002–03 season, but returned on February 24, 2003, at home against the Los Angeles Kings. After the season, Yzerman won the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for perseverance.

On May 1, 2004, Yzerman was hit in the eye by a deflected slapshot by the Calgary Flames defenceman Rhett Warrener in a playoff game, breaking his orbital bone and scratching his cornea. Yzerman underwent eye surgery following the incident, and was sidelined for the remainder of the 2004 playoffs. The eye injury also forced Yzerman to miss the 2004 World Cup of Hockey. Joe Thornton (then of the Boston Bruins) and Joe Sakic (Colorado), who each wore the number 19 for their respective NHL clubs and who were now eligible to wear it for team Canada due to Yzerman&#x27;s enforced absence, both refused the number out of respect for their injured countryman. Yzerman returned in the 2005–06 season, following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, wearing a visor.
On August 2, 2005, Yzerman signed a one-year deal with the Red Wings; this was his last contract signed as a player. On March 31, 2006, he scored his 691st NHL career goal, passing Mario Lemieux for eighth place all-time. Yzerman&#x27;s humility was evident in an interview prior to his achievement when he was quoted saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t really know the significance. If anything, it shows how good [Lemieux] is; he played almost five years less than I did.&quot; He scored his final NHL goal, the 692nd of his career, on April 3, 2006, in a game against the Calgary Flames. Yzerman played his last professional hockey game on May 1, 2006, a loss to the Edmonton Oilers in Game 6 of the first round of the 2006 playoffs and knocking Detroit out of the playoffs.

On July 3, 2006, Yzerman announced his retirement from the NHL. Shortly afterwards, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; published a special commemorative edition dedicated to Yzerman entitled &quot;Yzerman: A Salute to Stevie Y.&quot;

Yzerman holds the NHL record as the longest-serving captain of a single team – he spent 19 seasons and 1,303 games wearing the &quot;C&quot;. In addition to being eighth all-time in NHL regular-season goals and sixth in overall scoring, Yzerman finished his career seventh all-time in regular season assists and eighth in all-time playoff scoring. He also ranks second in nearly every significant offensive category in Red Wings history behind Gordie Howe, except for assists – Yzerman has 1,063 assists to Howe&#x27;s 1,020. At the time of his retirement, only Howe (1,687 games) and Alex Delvecchio (1,550 games) had played more games as a Red Wing than Yzerman&#x27;s 1,514. He is now fourth in games played for the franchise, behind Howe, Delvecchio, and Nicklas Lidström (1,564 games), who was his teammate for the final 12 seasons of his career.

==Managerial career==

===Detroit Red Wings===
On September 25, 2006, the Red Wings named Yzerman team vice-president and alternate governor.

On January 2, 2007, the Red Wings retired Yzerman&#x27;s jersey #19 before a game against the Anaheim Ducks. As an additional honour, the captain&#x27;s &quot;C&quot; was added to the corner of his banner to forever commemorate him as &quot;The Captain&quot;. The official retirement ceremony was hosted by Yzerman&#x27;s long-time friend, former NHL goaltender and ESPN hockey analyst Darren Pang, and featured such Red Wing luminaries as Gordie Howe, Ted Lindsay, Alex Delvecchio and Scotty Bowman. For the ceremony, active Red Wings players wore Yzerman throwback jerseys representing the Red Wings, Team Canada (Canada won gold at the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympic Games), the Campbell Conference All-Star team and the Peterborough Petes. Former teammate Vladimir Konstantinov attended the ceremony, walking across the ice for the first time without a wheelchair since his last game in the 1997 playoffs.

On January 2, 2007, Yzerman was presented the key to the city of Detroit by Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick at a luncheon prior to the jersey retirement ceremony. On January 13, 2007, Governor of Michigan Jennifer Granholm, another Canadian–American, visited Detroit and the Joe Louis Arena and proclaimed the day as &quot;Steve Yzerman Day&quot; in Michigan.

On January 11, 2008, when the Red Wings visited Ottawa to play the Senators, Yzerman was inducted into the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame. Yzerman received another honour when he was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame on February 11, 2008.

On June 23, 2009, it was announced that Yzerman would be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. He was honoured during the November 6–9 induction weekend alongside his former Red Wings teammates Brett Hull and Luc Robitaille, as well as Brian Leetch.

Yzerman had expressed his desire to run a team while with the Red Wings front office since the latter part of his playing career, and had gained experience in running a team through his work with Hockey Canada, having assembled several rosters between 2007 and 2010 for Hockey Canada. However, after both general manager Ken Holland and assistant general manager Jim Nill received contract extensions, it became clear that the opportunity would not happen with the Red Wings. It was later reported by &quot;The Detroit News&quot; in 2016 that Red Wings owner Mike Ilitch attempted to promote Holland to make room for Yzerman to become the team&#x27;s general manager, but Holland declined the promotion.

===Tampa Bay Lightning===
Not long after Ken Holland received his contract extension, Craig Leipold, owner of the Minnesota Wild, and Jeffrey Vinik, the then-new owner of the Tampa Bay Lightning, sought to hire Yzerman as general manager. After turning down the Minnesota job before the 2009–10 season concluded, Yzerman accepted the Lightning job and was named the team&#x27;s new vice-president and general manager on May 25, 2010. In the off-season, and early in his new reign, he re-signed Martin St. Louis, signed defenceman Pavel Kubina for his second tenure with the team, signed free agent goaltender Dan Ellis to a two-year contract, signed defenceman Brett Clark and brought in left-winger Simon Gagné in a trade that saw Matt Walker and a fourth-round pick in 2011 depart Tampa Bay. In the middle of the season, he also traded for goaltender Dwayne Roloson as the Lightning progressed to the Eastern Conference Finals just one year after the team had not even qualified for the 2010 playoffs. For his part, Yzerman was nominated for the NHL General Manager of the Year Award, losing out to Vancouver&#x27;s Mike Gillis.

While the Lightning would miss the playoffs in each of the next two seasons, Yzerman would draft Nikita Kucherov, Andrei Vasilevskiy, Brayden Point, Ondřej Palát, Anthony Cirelli, and Cal Foote, signed undrafted players Tyler Johnson and Yanni Gourde, and acquire Ryan McDonagh, Mikhail Sergachev, and Erik Černák via trade as future cornerstone roster pieces. The team would reach the Stanley Cup Finals in 2015, where they were defeated by the Chicago Blackhawks. On June 24, 2015, Yzerman won the NHL General Manager of the Year Award; he was the first Lightning general manager to receive the honor. The team built by Yzerman set franchise records with 50 wins and 108 points during the regular season, and also led the league with 262 goals and 32 home wins.

In the 2017–18 season, the Lightning finished in first place in the Atlantic Division and made it to the Eastern Conference Finals before losing to the Washington Capitals. On September 11, 2018, with one year remaining on his contract, Yzerman announced that he would not be re-signing as the Lightning general manager, but would remain with the team as a senior advisor. Yzerman was succeeded by assistant general manager Julien BriseBois.

===Return to Detroit===

On April 19, 2019, the Red Wings announced that Yzerman had been hired as general manager of the team, while the existing general manager, Ken Holland, was promoted to a senior vice president role, though Holland would soon depart the organization and become the general manager and president of hockey operations of the Edmonton Oilers.

===Team Canada===
On January 30, 2007, Hockey Canada named Yzerman the general manager of Team Canada for the 2007 IIHF World Championship in Moscow (April 27 – May 13), where the team beat Finland 4–2 on May 13 to win the Championship.

On October 18, 2008, Yzerman was named executive director for the Canadian men&#x27;s hockey team at the 2010 Winter Olympics. The Canadian team he put together went on to win the gold, the first gold won by a home team in ice hockey since the 1980 USA Olympic hockey team. Yzerman said he would consider coming back as head of the Canadian team in 2014. Yzerman went on saying, &quot;I loved it, but it was very stressful. Given the chance to represent Canada and be the guy in charge, if somebody offered it to me, I didn&#x27;t hesitate the first time, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate again.&quot;

In 2012, Yzerman was named executive director for the Canadian men&#x27;s hockey team at the 2014 Winter Olympics. The Canadian team he put together went on to win their second straight gold medal for the first time since 1948 and 1952. They also became the first country to accomplish the feat since the Soviet Union/Unified Team won three consecutive gold medals in 1984, 1988, and 1992. Following Canada&#x27;s 3–0 victory over Sweden in the gold medal game, Yzerman announced that he would not return as the executive director for Canada for the 2018 Winter Olympics.

==International play==
Played for Canada in:

*1983 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships

*1985 World Ice Hockey Championships
*1989 World Ice Hockey Championships
*1990 World Ice Hockey Championships
*1996 World Cup of Hockey
*1998 Winter Olympics
*2002 Winter Olympics

Yzerman was considered a leading candidate for the captaincy of Team Canada in 1998, along with Wayne Gretzky and Ray Bourque. Yzerman had led the Detroit Red Wings to the Stanley Cup during the previous season and was one of the longest-serving team captains. However, general manager Bobby Clarke instead selected Eric Lindros.

In late 2005, after Yzerman ruled himself out of a third Olympic appearance, Wayne Gretzky announced that no one would be allowed to wear jersey #19 for Canada for the 2006 Olympics in Yzerman&#x27;s honour (#19 was later &quot;unretired&quot; by Yzerman when he managed Team Canada for the 2010 Olympics).

==Personal life==
Yzerman and his wife Lisa Brennan have three daughters. They reside in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Yzerman resided in Hillsborough County, Florida, during his tenure with the Lightning. Yzerman has acquired naturalized United States&#x27; citizenship as a result of his many years of residence in Michigan.

Not far from where Yzerman grew up, the Nepean Sportsplex named one of its indoor ice surfaces the Steve Yzerman Arena in 1997 in his honour. This is the home rink of the CCHL&#x27;s Nepean Raiders, the Tier II Junior &quot;A&quot; team Yzerman played on during the 1980–81 season. The Raiders currently play in the Yzerman Division.

The CCHL divisions are named the Robinson and Yzerman Divisions after two of its most prominent alumni, Yzerman and Larry Robinson.

<text>The Andrews Sisters were an American close harmony singing group of the swing and boogie-woogie eras. The group consisted of three sisters: contralto LaVerne Sophia Andrews (1911–1967), soprano Maxene Anglyn Andrews (1916–1995), and mezzo-soprano Patricia Marie Andrews (1918–2013). The sisters have sold an estimated 80 million records. Their 1941 hit &quot;Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy&quot; can be considered an early example of jump blues. Other songs closely associated with the Andrews Sisters include their first major hit, &quot;Bei Mir Bist Du Schön (Means That You&#x27;re Grand)&quot; (1937), &quot;Beer Barrel Polka (Roll Out the Barrel)&quot; (1939), &quot;Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar&quot; (1940), &quot;Don&#x27;t Sit Under the Apple Tree (with Anyone Else but Me)&quot; (1942), and &quot;Rum and Coca-Cola&quot; (1945), which helped introduce American audiences to calypso.

The Andrews Sisters&#x27; harmonies and songs are still influential today and have been copied and recorded by entertainers such as Patti Page, Bette Midler, Christina Aguilera, Pentatonix, and others. The group was among the inaugural inductees to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame upon its opening in 1998. Writing for &quot;Bloomberg&quot;, Mark Schoifet said the sisters became the most popular female vocal group of the first half of the 20th century. They are still widely acclaimed today for their famous close harmonies. They were inducted into the Minnesota Rock/Country Hall of Fame in May 2006. 

== Early life ==
The sisters were born to Olga Bergliot &quot;Ollie&quot; (née Sollie; 1886—1948) and Peter Andreas. Peter Andreas (later &quot;Andrews&quot;), (1890—1949) was Greek and his wife Olga Andrews was of Norwegian ancestry raised in the Lutheran faith. The Sollie family disapproved of Olga&#x27;s marriage, but the relationship was repaired once their first child, LaVerne, was born July 6, 1911. Their second daughter, Anglyn, died at eight months of age on March 16, 1914. Maxene arrived on January 3, 1916, and Patty was born February 16, 1918.

Patty, the lead singer of the group, was 7 when the trio was formed, and 12 when they won first prize at a talent contest at the local Orpheum Theatre in Minneapolis, where LaVerne played piano accompaniment for the silent film showings in exchange for dancing lessons for her and her sisters. Following the collapse of their father&#x27;s Minneapolis restaurant, the sisters went on the road to support the family. All three attended Franklin Junior High School and North High School, both in Minneapolis.

== Career ==
===History===

They started their career as imitators of an earlier successful singing group, the Boswell Sisters, who had been popular until their breakup in 1936. After singing with various dance bands and touring in vaudeville with Leon Belasco (and his orchestra) and comic bandleader Larry Rich, they first came to national attention with their recordings and radio broadcasts in 1937, most notably via their major Decca record hit, &quot;Bei Mir Bist Du Schön&quot; (translation: &quot;To Me, You Are Beautiful&quot;), originally a Yiddish tune, the lyrics of which Sammy Cahn had translated to English and &quot;which the girls harmonized to perfection.&quot; They followed this success with a string of best-selling records over the next two years and, by the 1940s, had become a household name.

Instrumental to the sisters&#x27; success over the years were their parents, Olga and Peter, their orchestra leader and musical arranger, Vic Schoen (1916–2000), and Jack and David Kapp, who founded Decca Records.

==== World War II ====

In the years just before and during World War II, the Andrews Sisters were at the height of their popularity, and the group still tends to be associated in the public&#x27;s mind with the war years. They had numerous hit records during these years, both on their own and in collaboration with fellow Decca Records artist Bing Crosby. Some of these hits had service or military related themes, including &quot;Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy&quot;, &quot;Three Little Sisters&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Sit Under the Apple Tree (with Anyone Else but Me)&quot;, &quot;A Hot Time In the Town of Berlin&quot; and &quot;Rum and Coca-Cola&quot;. The sisters performed their hits in service comedy films, such as &quot;Buck Privates&quot; and &quot;Private Buckaroo&quot;.

During the war, they entertained the Allied forces extensively in Africa and Italy, as well as in the U.S., visiting Army, Navy, Marine, and Coast Guard bases, war zones, hospitals, and munitions factories. They encouraged U.S. citizens to purchase war bonds with their rendition of Irving Berlin&#x27;s song &quot;Any Bonds Today?&quot;. They also helped actress Bette Davis and actor John Garfield found California&#x27;s famous Hollywood Canteen, a welcome retreat for servicemen where the trio often performed, volunteering their personal time to sing and dance for the soldiers, sailors, and Marines (they did the same at New York City&#x27;s Stage Door Canteen during the war).

While touring, they often treated three random servicemen to dinner when they were dining out. They recorded a series of Victory Discs (V-Discs) for distribution to Allied fighting forces only, again volunteering their time for studio sessions for the Music Branch, Special Service Division, of the Army Service Forces, and they were dubbed the &quot;Sweethearts of the Armed Forces Radio Service&quot; for their many appearances on shows such as &quot;Command Performance&quot;, &quot;Mail Call&quot;, and &quot;G.I. Journal.&quot;

The sisters&#x27; 1945 hit &quot;Rum and Coca-Cola&quot; became one of their most popular and best-known recordings, but also inspired some controversy. Some radio stations were reluctant to play the record because it mentioned a commercial product by name, and because the lyrics were subtly suggestive of local women prostituting themselves to U.S. servicemen serving at the naval base on Trinidad. The song was based on a Trinidadian calypso, and a dispute over its provenance led to a well-publicized court case. The sisters later told biographers that they were asked to record the tune on short notice and were unaware either of the copyright issue or of the implications of the lyrics.

=== Interruption ===

An ad in the 1951 &#x27;Radio Annual&#x27; showed photos of the Andrews as children, as contemporary singers, and as old women in the then-future year of 1975, although the act would not make it that long. In the 1950s, Patty Andrews decided to break away from the act to be a soloist. She had married the trio&#x27;s pianist, Walter Weschler, who became the group&#x27;s manager and demanded more money for Patty. When Maxene and LaVerne learned of Patty&#x27;s decision from newspaper gossip columns rather than from their own sister, it caused a bitter two-year separation, especially when Patty sued LaVerne for a larger share of their parents&#x27; estate. Patty attributed the breakup to the deaths of their parents: &quot;We had been together nearly all our lives,&quot; Patty explained in 1971. &quot;Then in one year our dream world ended. Our mother died (in 1948) and then our father (in 1949). All three of us were upset, and we were at each other&#x27;s throats all the time.&quot; In 1951, they recorded &quot;The Windmill Song&quot; which is an adaptation of the French song &quot;Maître Pierre&quot; written in 1948 by Henri Betti (music) and Jacques Plante (lyrics). The English lyrics were written by Mitchell Parish. The Andrews Sisters formally broke up in 1953.

Maxene and LaVerne tried to continue the act as a duo and met with good press during a 10-day tour of Australia, but a reported suicide attempt by Maxene in December 1954 put a halt to any further tours (Maxene spent a short time in the hospital after swallowing 18 sleeping pills, an occurrence that LaVerne told reporters was an accident). Maxene and LaVerne did appear together on &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot; on October 26, 1954, singing the humorous &quot;Why Do They Give the Solos to Patty&quot; as well as lip-synching &quot;Beer Barrel Polka&quot; with Skelton in drag filling in for Patty. This however did not sit well with Patty, and a cease-and-desist order was sent to Skelton. The sisters&#x27; private relationship was often troubled, and Patty blamed it on Maxene: &quot;Ever since I was born, Maxene has been a problem, and that problem hasn&#x27;t stopped,&quot; she said.

The trio reunited in 1956 and signed a new recording deal with Capitol Records, for whom Patty was already a featured soloist. By this point, however, rock-and-roll and doo-wop were dominating the charts, and older artists were left by the wayside. The sisters recorded a dozen singles through 1959, some of which attempted to keep up with the times by incorporating rock sounds. None of these achieved any major success. In addition, they produced three hi-fi albums, including a vibrant LP of songs from the dancing 1920s with Billy May&#x27;s orchestra. In 1962, they signed with Dot Records and recorded a series of stereo albums until 1967, both re-recordings of earlier hits which incorporated up-to-date production techniques as well as new material, including &quot;I Left My Heart in San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Still&quot;, &quot;The End of the World&quot;, &quot;Puff the Magic Dragon&quot;, &quot;Sailor&quot;, &quot;Satin Doll&quot;, &quot;Mr. Bass Man&quot;, the theme from &quot;Come September&quot;, and the theme from &quot;A Man and a Woman&quot;. They toured extensively during the 1960s, favoring top nightclubs in Las Vegas, California, and London, England.

Eldest sister LaVerne died in 1967 at the age of 55 after a year-long bout with cancer, during which she was replaced by singer Joyce DeYoung (May 24, 1926 – March 7, 2014). DeYoung fulfilled concert appearances, including an appearance on &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; on November 30, 1967, but she did not record with Patty and Maxene. LaVerne had founded the original group and often acted as the peacemaker among the three during the sisters&#x27; lives, more often siding with her parents, to whom the girls were extremely devoted, than with either of her sisters. Their last appearance together as a trio was on &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; on September 29, 1966.

After LaVerne died, Maxene and Patty continued to perform periodically until 1968, when Maxene became the Dean of Women at Tahoe Paradise College, teaching acting, drama, and speech, and working with troubled teens; and Patty was once again eager to be a soloist.

In 1969, Patty appeared in Lucille Ball&#x27;s third series &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, in the sixth episode of the second season, titled &quot;Lucy and the Andrews Sisters&quot;. The episode has Patty enlisting the help of Lucy, her daughter Kim (played by Lucie Arnaz), and her son Craig (Desi Arnaz Jr.) to perform a medley of Andrews Sisters hits for the Andrews Sisters Fan Club reunion. Lucy played LaVerne, Kim (Lucie Arnaz) played Maxene, and Craig (Desi Arnaz Jr.) played Bing Crosby. She also had a cameo as herself along with many other stars in the 1970 film &quot;The Phynx&quot;.

==== Comeback ====
Patty and Maxene&#x27;s careers experienced a resurgence when Bette Midler covered &quot;Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy&quot; in 1973. The next year, the pair debuted on Broadway in the Sherman Brothers&#x27; nostalgic World War II musical: &quot;Over Here!&quot;, which premiered at the Shubert Theatre to rave reviews. This was a follow-up to Patty&#x27;s success in &quot;Victory Canteen&quot;, a 1971 California revue. &quot;Over Here!&quot; starred Maxene and Patty (with Janie Sell filling in for LaVerne and winning a Tony Award for her performance) and was written with both sisters in mind for the leads. It launched the careers of many now notable theater, film, and television stars, including John Travolta, Marilu Henner, Treat Williams, and Ann Reinking. It was the last major tour for the sisters and was cut short owing to a conflict with the show&#x27;s producers over pay for the sisters, resulting in the cancellation of an extensively scheduled road tour. &quot;Over&quot; &quot;Here!&quot; lasted only a year, and its end marked the last time the sisters would ever sing together.

Patty continually distanced herself from Maxene, until her death, and would not explain her motives regarding the separation. Maxene appealed to Patty for a reunion, personally if not professionally, both in public and in private, but to no avail. Maxene suffered a serious heart attack while performing in Illinois in 1982 and underwent quadruple bypass surgery, from which she successfully recovered. Patty visited her sister while she was hospitalized. Now sometimes appearing as &quot;Patti&quot; (but still signing autographs as &quot;Patty&quot;), she re-emerged in the late 1970s as a regular panelist on &quot;The Gong Show&quot;. Maxene had a successful comeback as a cabaret soloist in 1979 and toured worldwide for the next 15 years, recording a solo album in 1985 entitled &quot;Maxene: An Andrews Sister&quot; for Bainbridge Records. Patty started her own solo act in 1980 but did not receive the critical acclaim her sister had for her performances, even though Patty was considered to be the &quot;star&quot; of the group for years. The critics&#x27; major complaint was that Patty&#x27;s show concentrated too much on Andrews Sisters material, which did not allow Patty&#x27;s own talents as an expressive and bluesy vocalist to shine through.

The two sisters did reunite, albeit briefly, on October 1, 1987, when they received a star on Hollywood&#x27;s Walk of Fame, even singing a few bars of &quot;Beer Barrel Polka&quot; for the &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; cameras. The 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake had shaken the area that morning and the ceremony was nearly cancelled, which caused Patty to joke, &quot;Some people said that earthquake this morning was LaVerne because she couldn&#x27;t be here, but really it was just Maxene and me on the telephone.&quot; Besides this, and a few brief private encounters, they remained somewhat estranged for their remaining years, with Maxene dying in 1995.

Shortly after her Off-Broadway debut in New York City in a show called &quot;Swingtime Canteen&quot;, Maxene suffered another heart attack and died at Cape Cod Hospital on October 21, 1995, making Patty the last surviving Andrews Sister. Not long before she died, Maxene told music historian William Ruhlmann:I have nothing to regret. We got on the carousel and we each got the ring and I was satisfied with that. There&#x27;s nothing I would do to change things if I could...Yes, I would. I wish I had the ability and the power to bridge the gap between my relationship with my sister, Patty.Upon hearing the news of her sister&#x27;s death, Patty became distraught. Several days later, Patty&#x27;s husband Wally fell down a flight of stairs and broke both wrists. Patty did not attend her sister&#x27;s memorial services in New York City, nor in California. Bob Hope said of Maxene&#x27;s death, &quot;She was more than part of The Andrews Sisters, much more than a singer. She was a warm and wonderful lady who shared her talent and wisdom with others.&quot;

=== As musical innovators ===
They found instant appeal with teenagers and young adults who were engrossed in the swing and jazz idioms, especially when they performed with nearly all of the major big bands, including those led by Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, Buddy Rich, Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Gene Krupa, Joe Venuti, Freddie Slack, Eddie Heywood, Bob Crosby (Bing&#x27;s brother), Desi Arnaz, Guy Lombardo, Les Brown, Bunny Berigan, Xavier Cugat, Paul Whiteman, Ted Lewis, Nelson Riddle, and Gordon Jenkins.

=== Many styles ===
While the sisters specialized in traditional pop, swing, boogie-woogie, and novelty hits with their trademark lightning-quick vocal syncopations, they also produced major hits in jazz, ballads, folk, country, seasonal, and religious titles, being the first Decca artists to record an album of gospel standards in 1950. Their versatility allowed them to pair with many different artists in the recording studios, producing Top 10 hits with the likes of Bing Crosby (the only recording artist of the 1940s to sell more records than The Andrews Sisters), Danny Kaye, Dick Haymes, Carmen Miranda, Al Jolson, Ray McKinley, Burl Ives, Ernest Tubb, Red Foley, Dan Dailey, Alfred Apaka, and Les Paul. In personal appearances, on radio and on television, they sang with everyone from Rudy Vallee, Judy Garland, and Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole, to Jimmie Rodgers, Andy Williams, and The Supremes. Some of the trio&#x27;s late-1930s recordings have noticeable Boswell Sisters vocal influences.

== Marriages, family, and deaths ==
LaVerne Andrews married Lou Rogers, a trumpet player in Vic Schoen&#x27;s band, in 1948. The two remained together until LaVerne&#x27;s death from liver cancer on May 8, 1967, at the age of 55. Lou died in 1995.

Maxene Andrews married music publisher Lou Levy in 1941, separating in 1949. They adopted a girl and a boy, Aleda Ann and Peter. Levy was the sisters&#x27; manager from 1937 to 1951. Later in life, according to her adopted daughter, Maxene entered a thirteen-year relationship with a woman and later spent many years with her manager Lynda Wells as life partners. &quot;To me, being gay was not a central focus of Maxene&#x27;s life at all,&quot; Wells told radio station The Current (KCMP) in a 2019 interview. &quot;Her art was. Her singing was.&quot; But Wells says that their status as companions, and Maxene&#x27;s health issues as she got older, led Maxene to adopt her as a daughter. &quot;There was no such thing as being married at that time,&quot; she said. &quot;During her lifetime, there was no such thing that existed for us.&quot; Maxene died October 21, 1995, at age 79. The ashes of LaVerne and Maxene Andrews are interred in the Columbarium of Memory of the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California, close to the ashes of their parents.

Patty Andrews married agent Marty Melcher in 1947 but left him in 1949, when he pursued a romantic relationship with Doris Day. She then married Walter Weschler, the trio&#x27;s pianist, in 1951. Patty died of natural causes at her home in Northridge, California, on January 30, 2013, at the age of 94. Weschler, her husband of nearly 60 years, had died on August 28, 2010, at the age of 88.

Joyce DeYoung Murray, who replaced LaVerne from late 1966 to 1968, died in March 2014 at the age of 87.

== Legacy ==
The Andrews Sisters were the most imitated of all female singing groups and influenced many artists, including Mel Tormé, Les Paul and Mary Ford, the Four Freshmen, the Supremes, the Beach Boys, the McGuire Sisters, the Lennon Sisters, the Pointer Sisters, the Manhattan Transfer, Barry Manilow, and Bette Midler. Their style was even emulated internationally; the Harmony Sisters, a popular Finland group that performed from the 1930s to the 1950s, was one such example.

Most of the Andrews Sisters&#x27; music has been restored and released in compact disc form. Over 300 of their original Decca recordings, a good portion of which was hit material, has yet to be released by MCA/Decca. Many of their Decca recordings have been used in such television shows and Hollywood movies as &quot;Homefront&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Agent Carter&quot;, &quot;The Brink&#x27;s Job&quot;, &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot;, &quot;Swing Shift&quot;, &quot;Raggedy Man&quot;, &quot;Summer of &#x27;42&quot;, &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, &quot;Maria&#x27;s Lovers&quot;, &quot;Harlem Nights&quot;, &quot;In Dreams&quot;, &quot;Murder in the First&quot;, &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;, 
&quot;American Horror Story&quot;, &quot;Just Shoot Me&quot;, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;, &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;, &quot;Jakob the Liar&quot;, &quot;Lolita&quot;, &quot;The Polar Express&quot;, &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;, and &quot;Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don&#x27;t Come Back!!)&quot;. Comical references to the trio in television sitcoms can be found as early as &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and as recently as &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;. In 2007, their version of &quot;Bei Mir Bist Du Schön&quot; was included in the game &quot;BioShock&quot;, a first-person shooter that takes place in an alternate history 1960, and later in 2008, their song &quot;Civilization&quot; (with Danny Kaye) was included in the Atomic Age-inspired video game &quot;Fallout 3.&quot; The 2010 video game &quot;Mafia II&quot; features numerous Andrews Sisters songs, with &quot;Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy&quot;, &quot;Strip Polka&quot; and &quot;Rum and Coca-Cola&quot;. The 2011 video game &quot;L.A. Noire&quot; features the song &quot;Pistol Packin&#x27; Mama&quot;, where the sisters perform a duet with Bing Crosby. The sisters were again featured in a &quot;Fallout&quot; game in 2015, when their songs &quot;Pistol Packin&#x27; Mama&quot; and &quot;Civilization&quot; were featured in the game &quot;Fallout 4&quot;.

Christina Aguilera used the Andrews Sisters&#x27; &quot;Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy&quot; to inspire her song &quot;Candyman&quot; (released as a single in 2007) from her hit album &quot;Back to Basics&quot;. The song was co-written by Linda Perry. The London-based trio the Puppini Sisters uses their style harmonies on several Andrews Sisters and other hits of the 1940s and 1950s as well as later rock and disco hits. The trio has said their name is a tribute to The Andrews Sisters. The National WW2 Museum&#x27;s Victory Belles are proud to pay tribute to the Andrews Sisters performing their music daily in the Stage Door Canteen in New Orleans. The Manhattan Dolls, a New York City-based touring group, performs both the popular tunes sung by the Andrews Sisters and some of the more obscure tunes such as &quot;Well Alright&quot; and &quot;South American Way&quot;.

In 2008 and 2009, the BBC produced &quot;The Andrews Sisters: Queens of the Music Machines&quot;, a one-hour documentary on the history of the Andrews Sisters from their upbringing to the present. The North American premiere of the show was June 21, 2009, in their summer vacation enclave of Mound, Minnesota. In 2008, Mound dedicated &quot;The Andrews Sisters Trail&quot;. The sisters spent summers in Mound with their uncles Pete and Ed Solie, who had a grocery store there. Maxene Andrews always said that the summers in Mound created a major sense of &quot;normalcy&quot; and &quot;a wonderful childhood&quot; in a life that otherwise centered on the sisters&#x27; careers. The Westonka Historical Society has a large collection of Andrews Sisters memorabilia.

In 2019, the Great American Songbook Foundation held an exhibition titled &quot;The Andrews Sisters: Queens of the Jukebox,&quot; which led discussions about the lives and impact of the Andrews sisters&#x27; careers on the music industry alongside a collection of archival artifacts and historic memorabilia. The Songbook Library &amp; Archives houses most comprehensive collection of Andrews Sisters memorabilia available today. 

== Filmography ==
Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne appeared in 17 Hollywood films. Their first picture, &quot;Argentine Nights&quot;, paired them with another enthusiastic trio, the Ritz Brothers. Universal Pictures, always budget-conscious, refused to hire a choreographer, so the Ritzes taught the sisters some eccentric steps. Thus, in &quot;Argentine Nights&quot; and the sisters&#x27; next film, &quot;Buck Privates&quot;, the Andrews Sisters dance like the Ritz Brothers.

&quot;Buck Privates&quot;, with Abbott and Costello, featured the Andrews Sisters&#x27; best-known song, &quot;Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy.&quot; This Don Raye-Hughie Prince composition was nominated for Best Song at the 1941 Academy Awards ceremony.

Universal hired the sisters for two more Abbott and Costello comedies and then promoted them to full-fledged stardom in B musicals. &quot;What&#x27;s Cookin&#x27;?&quot;, &quot;Private Buckaroo&quot;, &quot;Give Out, Sisters&quot; (in which they disguise themselves as old women as part of the zany plot) and &quot;Moonlight and Cactus&quot; were among the team&#x27;s popular full-length films.

The Andrews Sisters sing the title song as the opening credits roll and also perform two specialty numbers in the all-star revue &quot;Hollywood Canteen&quot; (1944). They can be seen singing &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Know the Language&quot; with Bing Crosby in Paramount&#x27;s &quot;Road to Rio&quot; with Bob Hope, that year&#x27;s highest-grossing movie. Their singing voices are heard in two full-length Walt Disney features: &quot;Make Mine Music&quot;, in a segment which featured animated characters Johnny Fedora and Alice Blue Bonnet; and &quot;Melody Time&quot;, in the segment &quot;Little Toot&quot; (both of which are available on DVD today).

== Stage and radio shows ==
The Andrews Sisters were the most sought-after singers in theater shows worldwide during the 1940s and early 1950s, always topping previous house averages. The trio headlined at the London Palladium in 1948 and 1951. They hosted their own radio shows for ABC and CBS from 1944 to 1951, singing specially written commercial jingles for such products as Wrigley&#x27;s chewing gum, Dole pineapples, Nash motor cars, Kelvinator home appliances, Campbell&#x27;s soups, and Franco-American food products. The western-themed &quot;The Andrews Sisters&#x27; Show&quot; (subtitled &quot;Eight-to-the-Bar Ranch&quot;), co-hosted by Gabby Hayes, began in 1944 and featured a special guest every week.

== Setting records ==

They recorded 47 songs with crooner Bing Crosby, 23 of which charted on &quot;Billboard&quot;, thus making the team one of the most successful pairings of acts in a recording studio in show business history. Their million-sellers with Crosby included &quot;Pistol Packin&#x27; Mama&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Fence Me In&quot;, &quot;South America, Take It Away&quot;, and &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;.

The sisters&#x27; popularity was such that after the war they discovered that some of their records had actually been smuggled into Germany after the labels had been changed to read &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Marching Songs&quot;. Their recording of &quot;Bei Mir Bist Du Schön&quot; became a favorite of the Nazis, until it was discovered that the song&#x27;s composers were of Jewish descent. Still, it did not stop concentration camp inmates from secretly singing it, this being most likely since the song was originally a Yiddish song &quot;Bei Mir Bistu Shein&quot;, and had been popularized within the Jewish community before it was recorded as a more successful &quot;cover&quot; version by the Andrews sisters.

Edward Habib in the CD program notes for &quot;Songs That Won the War Vol. 2 The Hollywood Canteen&quot; states that the Andrews Sisters&#x27; radio transcription of Elmer&#x27;s Tune was &quot;so popular it even played on German radio,&quot; noting that &quot;the opposition embraced the Andrews Sisters and their songs in the same way the Allied Forces adopted Lili Marlene.&quot;

Along with Bing Crosby, separately and jointly, The Andrews Sisters were among the performers who incorporated ethnic music styles into America&#x27;s Hit Parade, popularizing or enhancing the popularity of songs with melodies originating in Brazil, Czechoslovakia, France, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Russia, Spain, Sweden and Trinidad, many of which their manager chose for them.

The Andrews Sisters became the most popular female vocal group of the first half of the 20th century.

* 75–100 million records sold from a little over 600 recorded tunes
* 113 charted &quot;Billboard&quot; hits, 46 reaching Top 10 status (more than Elvis Presley or The Beatles)
* 17 Hollywood films (more than any other singing group in motion picture history)
* record-breaking theater and cabaret runs all across America and Europe;
* countless appearances on radio shows from 1935 to 1960 (including their own)
* guest spots on every major television show of the 1950s and 1960s, including those hosted by Ed Sullivan, Milton Berle, Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Johnny Carson, Joey Bishop, Art Linkletter and Jimmy Dean.

Early comparative female close harmony trios were the Boswell Sisters, the Pickens Sisters, and the Three X Sisters.

<doc id="162158" wikidata="Q465232" url="?curid=162158" title="Jedediah Smith">
<text>Jedediah Strong Smith (January 6, 1799 – May 27, 1831) was an American clerk, transcontinental pioneer, frontiersman, hunter, trapper, author, cartographer, mountain man and explorer of the Rocky Mountains, the Western United States, and the Southwest during the early 19th century. After 75 years of obscurity following his death, Smith was rediscovered as the American whose explorations led to the use of the -wide South Pass as the dominant route across the Continental Divide for pioneers on the Oregon Trail.

Coming from modest family background, Smith traveled to St. Louis and joined William H. Ashley and Andrew Henry&#x27;s fur trading company in 1822. Smith led the first documented exploration from the Salt Lake frontier to the Colorado River. From there, Smith&#x27;s party became the first United States citizens to cross the Mojave Desert into what is now the state of California but which at that time was part of Mexico. On the return journey, Smith and his companions were likewise the first U.S. citizens to explore and cross the Sierra Nevada and the treacherous Great Basin Desert. The following year, Smith and companions were the first U.S. explorers to travel north from California overland to the Oregon Country. Surviving three Native American massacres and one bear mauling, Smith&#x27;s explorations and documented travels were important resources to later American westward expansion.

In March 1831, while in St. Louis, Smith requested of Secretary of War John H. Eaton a federally-funded exploration of the West, but to no avail. Smith informed Eaton that he was completing a map of the West derived from his own journeys. In May, Smith and his partners launched a planned paramilitary trading party to Santa Fe. On May 27, while searching for water in present-day southwest Kansas, Smith disappeared. It was learned weeks later that he had been killed during an encounter with the Comanche – his body was never recovered.

After his death, Smith and his accomplishments were mostly forgotten by Americans. At the beginning of the 20th century, scholars and historians made efforts to recognize and study his achievements. In 1918, a book by Harrison Clifford Dale was published covering Ashley-Smith&#x27;s western explorations. In 1935, Smith&#x27;s summary autobiography was finally listed in a biographical dictionary. Smith&#x27;s first comprehensive biography by Maurice S. Sullivan was published in 1936. A popular Smith biography by Dale Morgan, published in 1953, established Smith as an authentic national hero. Smith&#x27;s map of the West in 1831 was used by the U.S. Army, including western explorer John C. Frémont, during the early 1840s.

==Early life==
Smith was born in Jericho, now Bainbridge, Chenango County, New York, on January 6, 1799, to Jedediah Smith I, a general store owner from New Hampshire, and Sally Strong, both of whom were descended entirely from families that came to New England from England during the Puritan emigration between 1620 and 1640.
Smith received adequate English instruction, learned some Latin, and was taught how to write decently. Around 1810, Smith&#x27;s father was caught up in a legal issue involving counterfeit currency after which the elder Smith moved his family west to Erie County, Pennsylvania.

At age 13, Smith worked as a clerk on a Lake Erie freighter, where he learned business practices and probably met traders returning from the far west to Montreal. This work gave Smith an ambition for adventurous wilderness trade. According to Dale L. Morgan, Smith&#x27;s love of nature and adventure came from his mentor, Dr. Titus G. V. Simons, a pioneer medical doctor who was on close terms with the Smith family. Morgan speculated that Simons gave the young Smith a copy of Meriwether Lewis&#x27; and William Clark&#x27;s 1814 book of their 1804–1806 expedition to the Pacific, and according to legend Smith carried this journal on all of his travels throughout the American West. Smith provided Clark, who had become superintendent of Indian affairs, much information from his own expeditions to the West. In 1817, the Smith family moved westward to Ohio and settled in Green Township in what is present-day Ashland County.

==Smith joins &quot;Ashley&#x27;s Hundred&quot;==


Coming from a family of modest means, Smith sought to make his own way. He may have left his family in search of a trade or employment a year prior to their settlement in Green Township. In 1822, Smith was living in St. Louis. The same year Smith responded to an advertisement in the Missouri Gazette placed by General William H. Ashley. General Ashley and Major Andrew Henry, veterans of the War of 1812, had established a partnership to engage in the fur trade and were looking for &quot;One Hundred&quot; &quot;Enterprising Young Men&quot; to explore and trap in the Rocky Mountains. Superintendent of Indian Affairs William Clark had granted Ashley and Henry license to trade with Native Americans in the upper Missouri River, and he actively encouraged them to compete with the powerful British fur trade in the Pacific Northwest. Smith, a 6-foot-tall, 23-year-old with a commanding presence, impressed General Ashley to hire him. In late spring, Smith started up the Missouri on the keelboat &quot;Enterprize&quot;, which sank three weeks into the journey. Smith and the other men waited at the site of the wreck for a replacement boat, hunting and foraging for food. Ashley brought up another boat with an additional 46 men and upon proceeding upriver, Smith got his first glimpse of the western frontier, coming into contact with the Sioux and Arikara. On October 1, Smith reached Fort Henry at the mouth of the Yellowstone River, which had just been built by Major Henry and the men that he had led up earlier. Smith and some other men continued up Missouri River to the mouth of the Musselshell River, where they built a camp from which to trap through the winter.

==Arikaras attack==
In the spring of 1823, Major Henry ordered Smith back down the Missouri River to the Grand River with a message for Ashley to buy horses from the Arikaras, who, because of a recent skirmish with Missouri Fur Company men, were antagonistic to the white traders. Ashley, who was bringing supplies as well as 70 new men upriver by boat, met Smith at the Arikara village on May 30. They negotiated a trade for several horses and 200 buffalo robes and planned to leave as soon as possible to avert trouble, but weather delayed them. Before they could depart, an incident provoked an Arikara attack. Forty Ashley men, including Smith, were caught in a vulnerable position, and 12 were killed in the ensuing battle. Smith&#x27;s conduct during the defense was the foundation of his reputation: &quot;When his party was in danger, Mr. Smith was always among the foremost to meet it, and the last to fly; those who saw him on shore, at the Riccaree fight, in 1823, can attest to the truth of this assertion.&quot;

Smith and another man were selected by Ashley to return to Fort Henry on foot to inform Henry of the defeat. Ashley and the rest of the surviving party rode back down the river, ultimately enlisting aid from Colonel Henry Leavenworth who was the commander of Fort Atkinson. In August, Leavenworth sent 250 military men along with 80 Ashley-Henry men, 60 men of the Missouri Fur Company and a number of Lakota Sioux warriors to subdue the Arikaras. After a botched campaign, a peace treaty was negotiated. Smith had been appointed commander of one of the two squads of the Ashley-Henry men and was thereafter known as &quot;Captain Smith&quot;.

==First expedition, grizzly bear attack, and South Pass==
After the campaign, in the fall of 1823, Smith and several other of Ashley&#x27;s men traveled downriver to Fort Kiowa. Leaving Fort Kiowa in September, Smith and 10 to 16 men headed west, beginning his first far-western expedition, to make their way overland to the Rocky Mountains. Smith and his party were the first Euro-Americans to explore the southern Black Hills, in present-day South Dakota and eastern Wyoming. While looking for the Crow tribe to obtain fresh horses and get westward directions, Smith was attacked by a large grizzly bear. Smith was tackled to the ground by the grizzly, breaking his ribs. Members of his party witnessed him fight the bear, which ripped open his side with its claws and took his head in its mouth. When the bear retreated, Smith&#x27;s men ran to help him. They found his scalp and ear ripped off, but he convinced a friend, Jim Clyman, to sew it loosely back on, giving him directions. The trappers fetched water, bound up his broken ribs, and cleaned his wounds. After recuperating from his injuries, Smith wore his hair long to cover the large scar from his eyebrow to his ear. The only known portrait of Jedediah Smith, painted after his death in 1831, showed the long hair he wore over the side of his head to hide his scars.

The party spent the rest of 1823 wintering in the Wind River Valley. In 1824, Smith sent an expedition to find an expedient route through the Rocky Mountains. Smith was able to retrieve information from Crow natives. When communicating with the Crows, one of Smith&#x27;s men made a unique map (consisting of buffalo hide and sand), and the Crows were able to show Smith and his men the direction to the South Pass. Smith and his men crossed through this pass from east to west and encountered the Green River near the mouth of the Big Sandy River in what is now Wyoming. The group broke into two parties—one led by Smith and the other by Thomas Fitzpatrick—to trap upstream and downstream on the Green. The two groups met in July on the Sweetwater River, and it was decided that Fitzpatrick and two others would take the furs and the news of the identification of a feasible highway route through the Rockies to Ashley in St. Louis. Scottish-Canadian trapper Robert Stuart, employed by John Jacob Astor&#x27;s Pacific Fur Company, had previously discovered the South Pass, in mid-October 1812, while traveling overland to St. Louis from Fort Astoria, but this information was kept secret. Smith later wrote a letter to Secretary of War John Eaton in 1830 making the location of the South Pass public information.
Major Henry returned to St. Louis on August 30, and Ashley began making plans to lead a caravan back to the Rockies to regroup with his men. Henry declined to return with Ashley, instead choosing to retire from the fur trade.

After Fitzpatrick left, Smith and six others, including William Sublette, again crossed South Pass, and in September 1824 encountered a group of Iroquois freemen trappers who had split off from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company Snake Country brigade led by Alexander Ross. Smith told the Iroquois they could get better prices for their furs by selling to American traders and accompanied the brigade back to its base at Flathead Post in Montana. Smith then accompanied the brigade led by Peter Skene Ogden back southeast, leaving Flathead Post in December 1824. In April 1825, on the Bear River in what is now Utah, Smith and his companions split from the brigade and joined a group of Americans that had wintered in the area. In late May 1825, on the Weber River near present Mountain Green, Utah, 23 freemen trappers deserted from Ogden&#x27;s brigade, backed up by a group of American trappers led by Johnson Gardner. Several of the deserters were among the Iroquois trappers Smith had assisted in September 1824. Smith may have been present at the confrontation, but the extent of his involvement in the desertion of the freemen, if any, is unclear.

==First Rendezvous of 1825==
Ashley left St. Louis late in 1824 and after an exploring expedition in Wyoming and Utah, he and Smith were reunited on July 1, 1825, at what would become the first rendezvous. During the rendezvous, Ashley offered Smith a partnership to replace Henry. Smith returned to St. Louis for a time, where he asked Robert Campbell to join the company as a clerk.

==Second Rendezvous of 1826==
During the second rendezvous in the summer of 1826, Ashley decided no longer to be directly involved in the business of harvesting furs. Smith left a cache near the rendezvous site at what would become known as Cache Valley in northern Utah, and he and Ashley traveled north to meet David E. Jackson and Sublette at Bear River area near present-day Soda Springs, Idaho. Ashley sold his interest in his and Smith&#x27;s partnership to the newly created partnership of Smith, Jackson &amp; Sublette but agreed to continue to send supplies to the rendezvous
 and broker the sale of furs brought to him in St. Louis.

The new partners were immediately faced with the reality that beaver were rapidly disappearing from the region where the two previous partnerships had traditionally trapped. Contemporaneous maps promised untrapped rivers to the west,
such as the non-existent Buenaventura. The legendary Buenaventura was thought to be a navigable waterway to the Pacific Ocean possibly providing an alternative to packing loads of furs back to St. Louis. The previous spring, Smith had searched for rivers flowing to the Pacific west and northwest of the Great Salt Lake. Although he pushed into eastern Nevada, he failed to find the Humboldt River, the probable source of the legend of the Buenaventura. Having determined the Buenaventura must lie further south, Smith made plans for an exploratory expedition deep into the Mexican territory of Alta California.

===First trip to California, 1826–27===

Smith and his party of 15 left the Bear River on August 7, 1826, and after retrieving the cache he had left earlier, they headed south through present-day Utah and Nevada to the Colorado River, finding increasingly harsh conditions and difficult travel. Finding shelter in a friendly Mojave village near present-day Needles, California, the men and horses recuperated. Smith hired two refugees from the Spanish missions in California to guide them west. After leaving the river and heading into the Mojave Desert, the guides led them through the desert via the Mohave Trail that would become the western portion of the Old Spanish Trail. Upon reaching the San Bernardino Valley of California, Smith and Abraham LaPlant borrowed horses from a rancher and rode to the San Gabriel Mission on November 27, 1826, to present themselves to its director, Father José Bernardo Sánchez, who received them warmly.

The next day, the rest of Smith&#x27;s men arrived at the mission, and that night the head of the garrison at the mission confiscated all their guns. On December 8, Smith was summoned to San Diego for an interview with Governor José María Echeandía about his party&#x27;s status in the country. Echeandía, surprised and suspicious of the Americans&#x27; unauthorized entrance into California, had Smith arrested, believing him to be a spy. Accompanied by LaPlant, Smith&#x27;s Spanish interpreter, Smith was taken to San Diego while the remainder of the party remained at the mission. Echeandía detained Smith for about two weeks, demanding that he turn over his journal and maps. Smith requested permission to travel north to the Columbia River on a coastal route, where known paths could take his party back to United States territory. Upon intercession of American sea Captain W.H. Cunningham of Boston on the ship &quot;Courier&quot;, Smith was released by Echeandía to reunite with his men. Echeandía ordered Smith and his party to leave California by the same route they entered, forbidding him to travel north along the coast to Bodega Bay but giving Smith permission to purchase needed supplies for an eastern overland return journey. Smith boarded the &quot;Courier&quot; sailing from San Diego to San Pedro, to meet his men.

After waiting for almost another month for an exit visa and then spending at least two more weeks breaking the horses they had purchased for the return trip, Smith&#x27;s party departed the mission communities of California in mid-February 1827. The party returned on the path it had arrived, but once outside the Mexican settlements, Smith convinced himself he had complied with Echeandía&#x27;s order to leave by the same route he had entered, and the party veered north crossing over into the Central Valley. The party ultimately made its way to the Kings River on February 28 and began trapping beaver. The party kept working its way north, encountering hostile Maidus. By early May 1827, Smith and his men had traveled north looking for the Buenaventura River, but they found no break in the Sierra Nevada range through which it could have flowed from the Rocky Mountains. On December 16, 1826, Smith had written in a letter to the United States ambassador plenipotentiary to Mexico his plans to &quot;follow up on of the largest Riv(ers) that emptied into the (San Francisco) Bay cross the mon (mountains) at its head and from thence to our deposit on the Great Salt Lake&quot; and appeared to be following that plan. They followed the Cosumnes River (the northernmost tributary of the San Joaquin River) upstream, but veered off it to the north and crossed over to the American River, a tributary of the Sacramento that flowed into San Francisco Bay. They tried traveling up the canyon of the South Fork of the American to cross the Sierra Nevada but had to return because of deep snow. Unable to find a feasible path for the well-laden party to cross and faced with hostile indigenes, he was forced into a decision: since they did not have time to travel north to Columbia River and be on time for the 1827 rendezvous, they would backtrack to the Stanislaus River and re-establish a camp there. Smith would take two men and some extra horses to get to the rendezvous as quickly as he could and return to his party with more men later in the year, and the group would continue on to the Columbia.
After a difficult crossing of the Sierra Nevada near Ebbetts Pass, Smith and his two men passed around the south end of Walker Lake. After meeting with the only mounted natives that they would encounter until they reached the Salt Lake Valley, they continued east across central Nevada, straight across the Great Basin Desert as the summer heat hit the region. Neither they nor their horses or mules could find adequate food. As the horses gave out, they were butchered for whatever meat the men could salvage. After two days without water, Robert Evans collapsed near the Nevada–Utah border and could go no further, but some natives Smith encountered gave them some food and told him where to find water, which he took back to Evans and revived him. As the three approached the Great Salt Lake, they again were unable to find water, and Evans collapsed again. Smith and Silas Gobel found a spring and again took back water to Evans. Finally, the men came to the top of a ridge from which they saw the Great Salt Lake to the north, a &quot;joyful sight&quot; to Smith. By this time they had one horse and one mule remaining. They reached and crossed the Jordan River. Local natives told him the whites were gathered farther north at &quot;the Little Lake&quot; (Bear Lake on the border between present-day Utah and Idaho). Smith borrowed a fresh horse from them and rode ahead of the other two men, reaching the rendezvous on July 3. The mountain men celebrated Smith&#x27;s arrival with a cannon salute, for they had given up him and his party for lost.

==Third Rendezvous of 1827 and second trip to California, 1827–28==
As agreed, Ashley had sent provisions for the rendezvous, and his men took back of Smith, Jackson &amp; Sublette furs and a letter from Smith to William Clark, then in the office of the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the region west of the Mississippi River, describing what he had observed the previous year. Smith left to rejoin the men he had left in California almost immediately after the rendezvous. He was accompanied by 18 men and two French-Canadian women, following much of the same route as the previous year. In the ensuing year, the Mojave along the Colorado River who had been so welcoming the previous year had clashed with trappers from Taos and were set on revenge against the whites. While crossing the river, Smith&#x27;s party was attacked; 10 men, including Silas Gobel, were killed, and the two women were taken captive. Smith and the eight surviving men, one badly wounded from the fighting, prepared to make a desperate stand on the west bank of Colorado River, having made a makeshift breastwork out of trees and fashioned lances by attaching butcher knives to light poles. The men still had five guns among them, and as the Mojave began to approach, Smith ordered his men to fire on those within range. Two Mojaves were shot and killed, one was wounded, and the remaining attackers fled. Before the Mojave could regroup, Smith and eight other surviving men retreated on foot across the Mojave Desert on the Mohave Trail to the San Bernardino Valley.

Smith and the other survivors were again well received in San Gabriel. The party moved north to meet with the group that had been left in the San Joaquin Valley, reuniting with them on September 19, 1827. Unlike in San Gabriel, they were coolly received by the priests at Mission San José, who had already received warning of Smith&#x27;s renewed presence in the area. Smith&#x27;s party also visited the settlements at Monterey and Yerba Buena (San Francisco).

Governor Echeandía, who was at the time in Monterey (capital of Alta California), once again arrested Smith, this time along with his men. Yet despite the breach of trust, the governor once again released Smith after several English-speaking residents vouched for him, including John B. R. Cooper and William Edward Petty Hartnell in Monterey. After posting a $30,000 bond, Smith received a passport, on the same promise – to leave the province immediately and not to return. Also as before, Smith and his party remained in California hunting in the Sacramento Valley for several months. Upon reaching the northern edge of the valley, the party scouted the route to the northeast afforded by the Pit River but determined it to be impassable, so veered northwest toward the Pacific coast to find the Columbia River and return to the Rocky Mountain region. Jedediah Smith became the first explorer to reach the Oregon Country overland by traveling north on the California coast.

===Trip to the Oregon Country===
When Smith&#x27;s party left Mexican Alta California and entered the Oregon Country, the Treaty of 1818 allowed joint occupation between Britain and the United States. In the Oregon Country, Smith&#x27;s party, then numbering 19 and over 250 horses, came into contact with the Umpqua people. The tribes along the coast had monitored the party&#x27;s progress, passing news of conflicts between the group and indigenes, and the Umpqua were wary. One member of Smith&#x27;s party, Harrison Rogers, described a conflict between the party and the Umpqua that took place on July 11:&quot;Had several Inds. along; one of the Ind. stole an ax and we were obliged to seize him for the purpose of tying him before we could scare him to make him give it up. Capt. Smith and one of them caught him and put a cord round his neck, and the rest of us stood with our guns ready in case they made any resistance, there was about 50 Inds. present but did not pretend to resist tying the other.&quot; On July 14, 1828, while Smith, John Turner and Richard Leland were scouting a trail north, his group was attacked in its camp on the Umpqua River by a group of Umpqua people. 

On the night of August 8, 1828, Arthur Black arrived at the gate of Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) post at Fort Vancouver, exhausted and almost destitute of clothing. He believed himself to be the only survivor of the men at camp but did not know of the fate of Smith and the two others. Chief Factor John McLoughlin, superintendent at the fort, sent word to the local tribes that they would be rewarded if they brought Smith and his men to the fort unharmed, and began organizing a search party for them. Smith and the two others, having been alerted to the attack, had climbed a hill above the camp and witnessed the massacre; they arrived at Fort Vancouver on August 10, two days after Black.

McLoughlin sent Alexander McLeod south with Smith, Black, Turner, and Leland, and 37 HBC men to rescue any other men that had been in the camp that had possibly survived, and their goods. After recovering several horses in bad condition, Black and Leland remained with some HBC men to care for them, and the HBC horses and Smith, Turner, and 18 HBC men proceeded to the massacre site. On October 28, they reached it and found 11 decomposed bodies, which they buried. They ultimately confirmed that all 4 of the unaccounted-for men had died and recovered 700 beaver pelts, 50 river otter pelts, 4 sea otter pelts, and 39 horses, as well as Harrison Rogers&#x27; journals.

On October 25, 1828, while McLeod&#x27;s recovery expedition was in the field, HBC Governor George Simpson coincidentally arrived at Fort Vancouver on an inspection tour. When Smith returned, he and Simpson negotiated the purchase of the recovered property by the HBC. Simpson estimated that the recovery expedition had cost the Company £1,000 in lost revenue, and the salaries of the HBC men who spent three months on the trip cost an additional £171, yet HBC turned the recovered property over to Smith at no charge. Then Simpson paid Smith generous prices for the recovered furs and horses, totaling £582, and added a lump-sum bonus of £400; the payment totaled £982. In return, Smith apparently agreed that the firm of Smith, Jackson, and Sublette would confine its operations to the region east of the Great Divide. Smith remained at Fort Vancouver until March 12, 1829, when he and Arthur Black traveled up the Columbia River with the HBC&#x27;s York Factory Express to Fort Colvile, where they acquired horses and supplies for the trip east to meet up with his partners in Pierre&#x27;s Hole, on the west side of the Grand Tetons.

===Blackfeet expedition, 1829–30===

In 1829, Captain Smith personally organized a fur trade expedition into the Blackfeet territory. Smith was able to capture a good quantity of beaver pelts before being repulsed by hostile Blackfeet. Jim Bridger served as a riverboat pilot on the Powder River during the profitable expedition. In the four years of western fur trapping, Smith, Jackson, and Sublette were able to make a substantial profit and, at the 1830 rendezvous on the Wind River, they sold their company to Tom Fitzpatrick, Milton Sublette, Jim Bridger, Henry Fraeb, and John Baptiste Gervais who renamed it the Rocky Mountain Fur Company.

===Return to St. Louis===
After Smith&#x27;s return to St. Louis in 1830, he and his partners wrote a letter on October 29 to Secretary of War Eaton, who at the time was involved in a notorious Washington cabinet scandal known as the Petticoat Affair and informed Eaton of the &quot;military implications&quot; of the British allegedly alienating the indigene population towards any American trappers in the Pacific Northwest. According to biographer Dale L. Morgan, Smith&#x27;s letter was &quot;a clear sighted statement of the national interest&quot;. The letter also included a description of Fort Vancouver and described how the British were in the process of making a new fort at the time of Smith&#x27;s visit in 1829. Smith believed the British were attempting to establish a permanent settlement in the Oregon Country.

Smith had not forgotten the financial struggles of his family in Ohio. After making a sizable profit from the sale of furs, over $17,000 (more than $ in ) Smith sent $1,500 () to his family in Green Township, whereupon his brother Ralph bought a farm. Smith also bought a house on First Avenue in St. Louis to be shared with his brothers. Smith bought two African slaves to take care of the property in St. Louis.

The partners&#x27; busy schedules in St. Louis also found them and Samuel Parkman making a map of their discoveries in the West, to which Smith was the major contributor. On March 2, 1831, Smith wrote another letter to Eaton, now a few months away from resigning because of the Petticoat Affair, referencing the map and requesting to launch a federally funded exploration expedition similar to the Lewis &amp; Clark expedition. Smith requested that Reuben Holmes, a West Point graduate and military officer, would lead the expedition.

Smith and his partners were also preparing to join into the supply trade known as the &quot;commerce of the prairies&quot;. At the request of William H. Ashley, Smith Jackson and Sublette received a passport from Senator Thomas Hart Benton on March 3, 1831, the day after Smith wrote his letter to Eaton, and they began forming a company of 74 men, twenty-two wagons, and a &quot;six-pounder&quot; artillery cannon for protection.

==Death==


Having no response from Eaton, Smith joined his partners and left St. Louis to trade in Santa Fe on April 10, 1831. Smith was leading the caravan on the Santa Fe Trail on May 27, 1831, when he left the group to scout for water near the Lower Spring on the Cimarron River in present-day southwest Kansas. He never returned to the group. The remainder of the party proceeded on to Santa Fe hoping Smith would rendezvous with them, but he never did. They arrived in Santa Fe on July 4, 1831, and shortly thereafter members of the party discovered a comanchero with some of Smith&#x27;s personal belongings. It was relayed that Smith had encountered and communicated with a group of Comancheros just prior to his approaching a group of Comanche. Smith tried to negotiate with the Comanche, but they surrounded him in preparation for an attack.

Most likely, the death of Jedediah Smith occurred in Northern Mexico Territory, south of present-day Ulysses, Grant County, Kansas at Wagon Bed Spring. None of his colleagues were witness to his death and the following accounts are conjectural or imagined, although possibly based on hearsay and third-hand information. According to Smith&#x27;s grand-nephew, Ezra Delos Smith, there were 20 Comanches in the group. Smith attempted to conciliate with them until the Comanches scared his horse and shot him in the left shoulder with an arrow. Smith fought back, ultimately killing the chief of the warriors. The version written by Austin Smith, Jedediah&#x27;s brother, in a letter to their brother Ira four months after Jedediah&#x27;s death says that Jedediah had killed the &quot;head Chief,&quot; but nothing about any other Comanche being wounded or killed. Josiah Gregg wrote in 1844 that Smith &quot;struggled bravely to the last; and, as the Indians themselves have &quot;since&quot; related, killed two or three of their party before he was overpowered.&quot; Ezra Delos Smith stated that his grand-uncle had fought so valiantly that the Comanche believed &quot;he had been more than mortal, and that he could be immortal it would be better to propitiate his spirit; so they did not mutilate his body, but later gave it the same funeral rites they gave its chief&quot; Austin Smith, who along with another Smith brother, Peter, was a member of the caravan, was able to retrieve Jedediah Smith&#x27;s rifle and pistols that the Indians had taken and traded to the Comancheros.

==Aftermath==
In the aftermath of Smith&#x27;s death, President Andrew Jackson, during his second term in 1836, launched the federally-funded oceanic United States Exploring Expedition, led by Charles Wilkes, from 1838 to 1842. One of the expedition&#x27;s accomplishments was the exploration of the Pacific Northwest and to lay claim on the Oregon Country, which Smith had previously explored, dominated by the British Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company at Fort Vancouver on the Columbia River. The federally-funded overland exploration of the West that Smith had requested in 1831 took place starting in 1842 commanded by Lieutenant John C. Frémont under President John Tyler and President James K. Polk. It was Frémont&#x27;s first two documented and published explorations of the West during the 1840s that opened the West to American expansion. Frémont was popularly known as the &quot;Pathfinder&quot; until the late 19th century, while Smith&#x27;s life and reputation were nearly forgotten by his countrymen. In 1846, the disputed joint occupancy of Britain and the United States of the Oregon Country where Smith stayed at Fort Vancouver was ended by the Oregon Treaty. In 1848, Mexico ceded California (where Smith had twice been arrested by Governor Echeandía) to the United States under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, ending the Mexican–American War.

==Personal characteristics and beliefs==
Jedediah Smith had a dry, not raucous, sense of humor and was not known to use the profanity common to his peers. Smith&#x27;s immediate family were practicing Christians; his younger brother Benjamin was named after a Methodist circuit preacher, and his letters indicate his own Christian beliefs. Barton H. Barbour asserted in 2009 that the legend of Smith as a &quot;Bible-toter&quot; and a missionary grew only after his death, and that assertions that he carried a Bible with him in the wilderness have no basis in any accounts by him or his companions. Further, that the only documentation of any public demonstration of faith was a prayer said at the burial of one of the Arikara massacre victims. However, the 2023 biography, &quot;Throne of Grace,&quot; indicates Smith to be deeply religious. While he rarely attended church, &quot;it was said of him he made the mountaintop his confessional, the forest glade his altar.&quot; As such, author Tom Clavin describes Smith&#x27;s life as a kind of parable illustrate God’s munificence to any man willing to keep the Christian faith through the many trials. All accounts of Smith describe him as strongly self-controlled, never drinking alcohol to excess or bedding Native American women, indicating he had the discipline often associated with a strict moral code. He owned at least two slaves, which conflicted with his northern Methodist upbringing, and his behavior was not always honorable when dealing with those he considered his antagonists. He was known to be physically strong, cool under pressure, extremely skilled at surviving in the wild, and possessed extraordinary leadership skills. Smith&#x27;s true character is an enigma open to interpretation.

===Views of Native Americans===
While traveling throughout the American West, Smith&#x27;s policy with the Native Americans was to maintain friendly relations with gifts and exchanges, learning from their cultures. As he traveled through northern California for the first time, then part of Mexican territory Alta California, he tried to maintain that policy, but the situation quickly deteriorated. The Maidu were fearful and defensive, and Smith&#x27;s men killed at least seven of them upon his orders when they refused peaceful advances and demonstrated aggressive behaviors. He later wrote that they were &quot;the lowest intermediate link between man and the Brute creation&quot;.
Later, during his trek across the Great Basin, he said of the desert indigenes he came upon &quot;children of nature...unintelligent type of beings...They form a connecting link between the animal and intellectual creation...&quot; Upon returning to Mexican California, even after suffering the Mojave massacre, he continued to try to maintain good relations, punishing two of his men, albeit lightly, who had unnecessarily killed one native and wounded another. But as the party continued north, the natives continued the aggressive actions, and Smith&#x27;s men wounded at least two more and three were killed. By the time the party reached the Umpqua River in the British-American shared Oregon Country, their tolerance was at an ebb, leading to the ax incident and resulting in disastrous consequences.

==Historical reputation==
Smith for the most part was forgotten by his countrymen as a historical figure for over 75 years after his death. In 1853, Peter Skene Ogden had written about the Umpqua massacre in &quot;Traits of American Indian Life and Character by a Fur Trader&quot;, and the Oregon Pioneers Association and Hubert Howe Bancroft wrote versions of it in 1876 and 1886, respectively. There are mentions of him in memoirs by other fur trappers, and mentions by George Gibbs and F. V. Hayden in their reports. &quot;Recollection of a Septuagenarian&quot; by William Waldo, published by the Missouri Historical Society in 1880, discussed Smith, focusing on hearsay evidence of his piety. There was no mention of Smith in the 1891 volume 5 publication of &quot;Appletons&#x27; Cyclopædia of American Biography&quot; edited by James Grant Wilson and John Fiske. The first known publication solely about Smith was in the 1896 &quot;Annual Publication of the Historical Society of Southern California&quot;. In 1902, Hiram M. Chittenden wrote of him extensively in &quot;The American Fur Trade of the West&quot; The same year Frederick Samuel Dellenbaugh wrote about Smith&#x27;s exploits with the Mojave Indians in his book &quot;The Romance of the Colorado River: The Story of Its Discovery in 1540 with an Account of Later Explorations&quot;. Smith, however, again was not listed in the 1906 volume 9 publication of American Biographical Society&#x27;s &quot;Biographical Dictionary of America&quot;, edited by Rossiter Johnson. In 1908, John G. Neihardt and Doane Robinson lamented the obscurity of Smith; afterward, more extensive efforts were initiated to publicize his accomplishments.

In 1912, an article about Smith written by a grand-nephew, Ezra Delos Smith of Meade, Kansas, was published by the Kansas Historical Society. Five years later, Smith&#x27;s status as a historical figure was further revived by Harrison Clifford Dale&#x27;s book,&quot;The Ashley-Smith Explorations and the Discovery of a Central Route to the Pacific, 1822–1829: With the Original Journals&quot;, published in 1918.
During the 1920s, Maurice S. Sullivan traced descendants of Smith&#x27;s siblings and found two portions of the narrative of Smith&#x27;s travels, written in the hand of Samuel Parkman who had been hired to assist in compiling the document after Smith&#x27;s return to St. Louis in 1830. The narrative&#x27;s impending publication had been announced in a St. Louis newspaper as late as 1840, but never happened. In 1934, Sullivan published the remnants, documenting Smith&#x27;s travels in 1821 and 1822 and from June 1827 until the Umpqua massacre a year later, in &quot;The Travels of Jedediah Smith&quot;, giving a new documented perspective of Smith&#x27;s explorations. Along with the narrative, Sullivan published the portion of Alexander McLeod&#x27;s journal documenting the search for any surviving members of Smith&#x27;s party and the recovery of his property after the Umpquah massacre. The &quot;Dictionary of American Biography&quot;, Volume 17, edited by Dumas Malone, published in 1935, contains an article on Smith authored by Joseph Schafer. The next year, the first comprehensive biography of Smith: &quot;Jedediah Smith: Trader and Trail Breaker&quot; by Sullivan was posthumously published, but it was Dale Morgan&#x27;s book, &quot;Jedediah Smith and the Opening of the West&quot;, published in 1953, that established Smith as an authentic American hero whose explorations were overshadowed by the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

According to Maurice S. Sullivan, Smith was &quot;the first white man to cross the future state of Nevada, the first to conquer the High Sierra of California, and the first to explore the entire Pacific Slope from Lower California to the banks of the Columbia River&quot;. He was known for his many systematic recorded observations on nature and topography. His expeditions also raised doubts about the existence of the legendary Buenaventura River. Jedediah Smith&#x27;s explorations were the main basis for accurate Pacific West maps. He and his partners, Jackson and Sublette, produced a map that, in a eulogy for Smith printed in the &quot;Illinois Monthly Magazine&quot; for June 1832, the unknown author claimed: &quot;This map is now probably the best extant, of the Rocky Mountains, and the country on both sides, from the States to the Pacific.&quot; This map has been called &quot;a landmark in mapping of the American West&quot; The original map is lost, its content was overlaid and annotated by George Gibbs on an 1845 base map by John C. Frémont, which is on file at the American Geographical Society Library, at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

==Author of journal==
Another important piece of the Jedediah Smith story was discovered in 1967, when another portion of the 1830–31 narrative (again in Parkman&#x27;s hand) was found amongst other historical papers in an attic in St. Louis. This portion documented Smith&#x27;s first California trip (1826–27), and immediately preceded the portion of the narrative found by Sullivan 35 years earlier. George R. Brooks edited and introduced the narrative portion, along with the first &quot;journal&quot; of Smith companion Harrison Rogers, in 1977.

==Legacy==

===Geographic namesakes===
Smith&#x27;s exploration of northwestern California and southern Oregon resulted in two rivers, the Smith River (California) and Smith River (Oregon) being named for him. Smith&#x27;s Fork of the Bear River, in southwest Wyoming, is named for him. and Smith&#x27;s Fork of Blacks Fork of the Green River may also be named for him.
The Jedediah Smith Wilderness in Wyoming bears his name.
Smith Valley, NV is named after him.
