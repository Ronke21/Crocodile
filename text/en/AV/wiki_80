<text>Juho Kusti Paasikivi (, 27 November 1870 – 14 December 1956) was a Finnish politician who served as the seventh president of Finland from 1946 to 1956. Representing the Finnish Party until its dissolution in 1918 and then the National Coalition Party, he previously served as senator, member of parliament (1907–1909, 1910–1914), envoy to Stockholm (1936–1939) and Moscow (1940–1941), and Prime Minister of Finland (1918 and 1944–1946). He also held several other positions of trust, and was an influential figure in Finnish economics and politics for over fifty years.

Paasikivi is remembered as a main architect of Finland&#x27;s foreign policy after the Second World War; for example, the Paasikivi Society (&quot;Paasikivi-seura&quot;), founded in 1958 under the leadership of Jan-Magnus Jansson, sought to nurture Paasikivi&#x27;s political legacy, especially during the Cold War, by promoting &#x27;fact-based foreign policy thinking&#x27; in Finland and making Finland&#x27;s policy of neutrality internationally known.

== Early life and political career ==
===Birth and childhood===
Paasikivi was born Johan Gustaf Hellsten () in 1870 at the smoke sauna of the Kulma-Seppälä house in the Huljala village of Koski Hl (today Hämeenkoski) in Päijänne Tavastia in Southern Finland, to Tamperean travelling merchant August Hellsten and his wife, Karolina Wilhelmina, née Selin. Hellsten&#x27;s parents lived in Tampere, but the son was born on their business trip to the Lahti market. After returning home, Hellsten was officially entered in Tampere&#x27;s church books. Hellsten&#x27;s mother died when he was four, and his father died in debt when Hellsten was 14. Hellsten&#x27;s half-sister Karolina died soon after. Upon his father&#x27;s death, Hellsten&#x27;s aunt, Kaisa Hagman, assumed responsibility for his raising. Hellsten Finnicized his name to &quot;Juho Kusti Paasikivi&quot; in 1885. His surname literally means &quot;flagstone&quot; in both languages.

===Education===
The young Paasikivi was an enthusiastic athlete and gymnast. His father had recognized his son&#x27;s academic talent and enrolled him at a top elementary school in Hämeenlinna following brief attendance at Hollola. Paasikivi exhibited an early appetite for reading, and was the best pupil in his class. He entered the University of Helsinki in 1890, graduating in May 1892 with a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Russian language and literature, a course of studies that proved useful in later life. The following winter, Paasikivi changed his major to law, earning a Master of Laws degree and eventually, in 1902, his Doctor of Law. During his schooling, Paasikivi supported himself by working variously as a teacher, lecturer, court bailiff, and lawyer in private practice in Lahti. It was also during his university studies, around 1894, that Paasikivi first became involved in the Fennoman movement, assuming leadership roles in its student organization.

===First marriage and family===

On 1 June 1897 Paasikivi married Swedish-born Anna Matilda Forsman (1869–1931). Together they had four children, Annikki (1898–1950), Wellamo (1900–1966), Juhani (1901–1942), and Varma (1903–1941). Upon earning his doctorate in law in 1901, Paasikivi took on an associate professorship of Administrative Law at Helsinki University from 1902 to 1903.

===Introduction to politics===
Paasikivi left this post to become Director-in-Chief of Treasury of the Grand Duchy of Finland, a position he retained until 1914. For practically all of his adult life, Paasikivi moved in the inner circles of Finland&#x27;s politics. He supported greater autonomy and an independent Cabinet (&quot;Senate&quot;) for Finland, and resisted Russia&#x27;s panslavic intentions to make Russian the only official language everywhere in the Russian Empire. He belonged, however, to the more complying Finnish Party, opposing radical and potentially counter-productive steps which could be perceived as aggressive by the Russians. Paasikivi served as a Finnish Party member of Parliament 1907–1909 and 1910–1913. He served as a member of the Senate 1908–1909, as head of the finance division.

== Independence and Civil War ==

During the First World War Paasikivi began to doubt the Finnish Party&#x27;s obedient line. In 1914, after resigning his position at the Treasury, and also standing down as a member of Parliament, Paasikivi left public life and office. He became Chief General Manager of the &quot;Kansallis-Osake-Pankki&quot; (KOP) bank, retaining that position until 1934. Paasikivi also served as a member of the City Council of Helsinki 1915–1918.

After the 1917 February Revolution in Russia, Paasikivi was appointed to the committee that began formulating new legislation for a modernized Grand Duchy. Initially he supported increased autonomy within the Russian state, in opposition to the Social Democrats in the &quot;coalition-Senate,&quot; who in vain strove for more far-reaching ; but after the 1917 Bolshevik October Revolution, Paasikivi championed full independence—in the form of constitutional monarchy.

During the Civil War in Finland Paasikivi stood firmly on the side of the White government. As prime minister from May until November 1918, he strove for a continued constitutional monarchy with Frederick Charles of Hesse, a German Prince, as king, intending to ensure German support for Finland against Bolshevist Russia. However, as Germany lost the World War, the monarchy had to be scrapped for a republic more in the taste of the victorious Entente. Paasikivi&#x27;s &quot;Senate&quot; resigned, and he returned to the KOP bank.

Paasikivi&#x27;s &quot;Senate&quot; was in power during the existence of the prison camps following the Civil War in Finland, where 12,000 prisoners died in total. Starvation was seen as a principal cause of mortality in the camps which housed men and women who had fought on the side of the Reds.

Paasikivi, as a political conservative, was a firm opponent of Social Democrats in the cabinet, or communists in the Parliament. Tentatively he supported the semi-fascist Lapua movement, which requested radical measures against the political Left. But eventually the Lapua movement radicalized further, even assaulting Ståhlberg, liberal former president of Finland; and Paasikivi like many other supporters, turned away from the radical right. In 1934 he became chairman of the conservative National Coalition Party, as a champion of democracy, and successfully rehabilitated the party after its suspicious closeness to the Lapua movement and the failed coup d&#x27;état, the Mäntsälä Rebellion.

== Envoy in Stockholm ==

Widowed in 1931, he married Allina (Alli) Valve (1879–1960) in 1934 and resigned from politics. However, he was persuaded to accept the position of Envoy to Sweden, at the time regarded as Finland&#x27;s most important foreign embassy post. The threats from totalitarian regimes that had seized power in Germany and the Soviet Union made Finland increasingly isolated. With the gradual weakening of the League of Nations, and France&#x27;s and the United Kingdom&#x27;s apparent lack of interest in supporting Finland, Sweden was the only notable power left that could possibly provide Finland any support at all. Since around the time of the failed Lapua coup, Paasikivi and Mannerheim had belonged to a close circle of conservative Finns discussing how Sweden&#x27;s support could be obtained.

In Stockholm Paasikivi strove for Swedish defence guarantees, alternatively a defensive alliance or a defensive union between Finland and Sweden. Since the Civil War, relations between the Swedes and Finns had been frosty. The revolutionary turmoil at the end of World War I had led to Parliamentarism in Sweden, increased Swedish democracy, and a dominant role for the Swedish Social Democrats. In Finland, however, the result had been a disastrous Civil War and a total defeat for Socialism. At the same time that Paasikivi arrived in Stockholm, it became known that Finnish President Svinhufvud retained his aversion to parliamentarism; and (after pressure from Paasikivi&#x27;s National Coalition Party) had declined to appoint a cabinet with Social Democrats as Ministers. This didn&#x27;t improve Paasikivi&#x27;s reputation among the Swedish Social Democrats dominating the government, who were sufficiently suspicious due to his association with Finland&#x27;s Monarchist orientation in 1918, and the failed Lapua coup in 1932.

Things actually improved, partly due to Paasikivi&#x27;s efforts, partly due to President Kallio being elected. As president, Kallio approved of parliamentarism and appointed Social Democrats to the cabinet. But the suspicions between Finland and Sweden were too strong: During the Winter War Sweden&#x27;s support for Finland was considerable, but short of one critical feature: Sweden neither declared war on the Soviet Union nor sent regular troops to Finland&#x27;s defense. This made many Finns, including Paasikivi himself, judge his mission in Stockholm a failure.

== Envoy in Moscow ==

Prior to the Winter War, Paasikivi became the Finnish representative in the negotiations in Moscow. Seeing that Joseph Stalin did not intend to change his policies, Paasikivi supported compliance with some of the demands. When the war broke out, Paasikivi was asked to enter Risto Ryti’s cabinet as a minister without portfolio—in practice in the role of a distinguished political advisor. He ended up in the cabinet&#x27;s leading triumvirate together with Risto Ryti and Foreign Minister Väinö Tanner (chairman of the Social Democrats). Paasikivi also led the negotiations for an armistice and peace, and continued his mission in Moscow as Envoy. In Moscow he was necessarily isolated from the most secret thoughts in Helsinki; and when he found out that these thoughts ran in the direction of revanche, of retaking, with Germany&#x27;s aid, territory lost in the Winter War, he resigned. Paasikivi retired for the second time.

== Prime minister and president ==

In summer 1941, when the Continuation War began, Paasikivi took up writing his memoirs. By 1943 he had concluded that Germany was going to lose the war and that Finland was in great danger as well. However, his initial opposition to the pro-German politics of 1940–1941 was too well known, and his first initiatives for peace negotiations were met with little support from either Field Marshal Mannerheim or Risto Ryti, who now had become President.

===From prime minister to president (1946)===

Immediately after the war, Mannerheim appointed Paasikivi prime minister. For the first time in Finland a Communist, Yrjö Leino, was included in the cabinet. Paasikivi&#x27;s policies were those of a intended to be &quot;realistic&quot; radically different from those of the previous 25 years.

Paasikivi sought to understand why Moscow had ordered the invasion of Finland in 1939. He concluded that interwar Finnish portrayals of the Soviet Union were &quot;heedlessly Russophobic&quot;, and that the Soviet attack was legitimate, strategic, and even &quot;defensive&quot; rather than ideological or expansionist. Consequently, he ensured that negative references to the Soviet Union were expunged from school textbooks and that books containing &quot;hostile&quot; representations of the Soviet Union were removed from public libraries.

Paasikivi had to comply with many Soviet demands, including the war crimes trial. His main effort was to prove that Finland would present no threat to the Soviet Union, and that both countries would gain from confident peaceful relations.

When Mannerheim resigned, Parliament selected Paasikivi to succeed him as President of the Republic. Paasikivi was then age 75.

===Political evolution===
Paasikivi had thus come a long way from his earlier classical conservatism. He now was willing to co-operate regularly with the Social Democrats and when necessary, even with the Communists, as long as they acted democratically. As president, he only once accepted his party, the Conservatives, into the government; and even that government lasted only about six months and was considered more a caretaker or civil-servant government than a regular parliamentary government. Paasikivi even appointed a communist, People&#x27;s Democrat Mauno Pekkala, as prime minister in 1946.

====Dealing with communists====
Paasikivi&#x27;s political flexibility had its limits; this was shown at the time of the communists&#x27; alleged coup attempt or coup plans in spring 1948. He ordered some units of the army and navy to Helsinki to defend the capital against a possible communist attack. Any attempted takeover failed before it had even started, and the communists were defeated in the next parliamentary elections.

Most modern Finnish historians deny that most communists wanted a violent coup, especially not without Soviet support. Later in the spring when the Finnish parliament passed a no-confidence motion against Communist Interior Minister Leino because of controversy over Leino&#x27;s treatment of some mostly White Russian emigrant prisoners whom he had ordered deported to the Soviet Union, Paasikivi had to dismiss Leino when he refused to resign at once. After the 1948 parliamentary elections, when the communists dropped from the largest to the third largest party, Paasikivi refused to let them into the government; and the communists remained in opposition until 1966.

===&quot;Paasikivi doctrine&quot;===
As President, Paasikivi kept the foreign relations of Finland in the foreground, trying to ensure a stable peace and wider freedom of action for Finland. Paasikivi concluded that, all the fine rhetoric aside, Finland had to adapt to superpower politics and sign treaties with the Soviet Union to avoid a worse fate. Thus he managed to stabilize Finland&#x27;s position. This &quot;Paasikivi doctrine&quot; was adhered to for decades, and was named Finlandization in the 1970s.

====Knowledge of Russian helped====
Paasikivi&#x27;s ability to speak some Russian helped his relations with the Soviet leaders; he did not have to use interpreters all the time, as his successor Kekkonen did. Having studied in Russia as a young man, Paasikivi also knew classic Russian literature and Russian culture.

===1950 presidential election===
Paasikivi stood for re-election in the presidential election of 1950, and he won 171 out of the 300 electoral college votes. The priorities of his second term were centred largely on domestic politics, in contrast to his first term. Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death made Paasikivi&#x27;s job easier.

As a lover of sports, and a former athlete and gymnast, Paasikivi had the great pleasure, during his second term of office, of opening the 1952 Summer Olympics held in Helsinki. On the eve of the Summer Olympics, it was only appropriate for the cultured statesman to hold a speech in a world language, English. However, English was not Paasikivi’s strong language, as French had long been the predominant language of diplomacy. Still, Paasikivi wanted to extend his greetings to foreign guests arriving in Helsinki. The President&#x27;s speech was as follows:

By the end of Paasikivi&#x27;s six-year second term, Finland had rid itself of the most urgent political problems resulting from the war. The Karelian refugees had been resettled, the war reparations had been paid, rationing had ended, and in January 1956 the Soviet Union removed its troops from the Porkkala naval base near Helsinki.

===Last minute 1956 candidacy===
Paasikivi did not actively seek re-election from his second term ending 1 March 1956, when he was age 85. However, Paasikivi was willing to serve as president for about two more years if a great majority of politicians asked him to do so. He appeared as a dark horse presidential candidate on the second ballot of the electoral college on 15 February 1956, but was eliminated as the least popular candidate. His last-minute candidacy was based on a misunderstood message from some conservatives which made him believe that enough Agrarians and Social Democrats would support him.

After his unsuccessful last-minute presidential candidacy, Paasikivi felt betrayed by those politicians who asked him to participate in the election. He even denied giving his consent to the presidential candidacy in a public statement. He died in December, having not yet finished his memoirs.

== Paasikivi on banknotes ==

Paasikivi, who had a strong background in banking, has featured on various Finnish banknotes. He is one of three Finnish presidents whose portrait has appeared on markka-denominated banknotes of Finland. The others were Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg, the first president of Finland, and Urho Kekkonen, Paasikivi&#x27;s successor as president.

<doc id="164617" wikidata="Q214009" url="?curid=164617" title="Lauri Kristian Relander">
<text>Lauri Kristian Relander ( , ; 31 May 1883 – 9 February 1942) was the second president of Finland (1925–1931). A prominent member of the Agrarian League, he served as a member of Parliament, and as Speaker, before his election as President.

Relander is widely regarded as the most unknown of Finland&#x27;s presidents, as he has been considered a colorless and weak president who, during a domestic politically broken period, allowed himself to be guided without a clear line of his own. In foreign policy, the policy of isolation was continued during Relander&#x27;s term, although on the other hand the president did valuable work in representing Finland abroad and establishing relations at the head of state level with neighboring states, such as the other Nordic countries. Also during his presidency, Relander emphasized the preservation of social peace and otherwise required the left wing to accept the rules of the democracy, the right wing to accept the rules of the republic, and the nationalists to agree on the Finnish language policy.

==Early life and career==
Relander was born in Kurkijoki, in Karelia, the son of Evald Kristian Relander, an agronomist, and Gertrud Maria Olsoni. He was christened &quot;Lars Kristian&quot; (), but he Finnicized his forenames to &quot;Lauri Kristian&quot; during his time at school. Relander followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps by enrolling at the University of Helsinki in 1901 to study agronomy.
He gained his first bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy in 1905, and his second, in agronomy, the following year. That year also saw his marriage to Signe Maria Österman (1886–1962). They had two children, Maja-Lisa (1907–1990) and Ragnar (1910–1970).

The major subjects for Relander&#x27;s master&#x27;s degree, which he gained in 1907, were agricultural chemistry and agricultural economics. After obtaining his degree, Relander worked from 1908 to 1917 as a researcher at a state agricultural experimental institution, carrying out some important research in his field. He also continued his studies, gaining his Doctorate in 1914. However, his attempts at this time to gain a lectureship at the University of Helsinki failed. At this time Relander was also politically active in the Agrarian League. He was elected to Parliament in 1910, serving until 1913, and again from 1917 to 1920. By 1917, he had become one of the leaders of the party.

==Politician==
After independence, his political career went well. He was a prominent member of his party and served on a number of parliamentary committees. Relander was elected as Speaker of the Eduskunta for its 1919 session and part of its 1920 session. Later that year, he was appointed Governor of the Province of Viipuri. However, in the 1920s he did not have enough support in his own party to become a minister.

In 1925, Relander was nominated as his party&#x27;s candidate for that year&#x27;s presidential election, which was confirmed only days before election day. Relander was only 41 at the time, and his nomination came as a surprise. It was further guaranteed by the fact that some of the party&#x27;s key figures, such as Santeri Alkio and Kyösti Kallio, declined to stand.

Relander was elected in the third ballot of the electoral college, defeating the National Progressive Party candidate Risto Ryti by 172 votes to 109. He was elected largely due to the fact that he attracted less opposition than Risto Ryti. According to some contemporaries, at least the Swedish People&#x27;s Party electors more eagerly voted for Relander because his wife happened to be a Finland Swede. That story may be partly apocryphal because also Ryti had a Finland-Swedish wife. On the other hand, Ryti had campaigned as a &quot;Finnish peasant&#x27;s son.&quot; Strong right-wing opposition to the outgoing Progressive (liberal) President K. J. Ståhlberg, Ryti&#x27;s membership in the same party, and at least some career politicians&#x27; desire for a more approachable and less independent President may partly explain Relander&#x27;s victory.

Two other important factors should be mentioned. Relander was an active member of the &quot;Suojeluskunta&quot; (Civil Guard) voluntary military organization, and he accepted the right-wing worldview typical of White veterans of the Civil War clearly more wholeheartedly than Ryti. Also as people, Relander and Ryti were notably different: despite having a doctorate, Relander was much more talkative and social than the intellectual and thoughtful Ryti.

==President==

As President, Relander was politically inexperienced and young. Politicians and other opinion leaders could not take him seriously. Relander had no political base to speak of, and he was deemed to have no particular program for his presidency, which further decreased his support. Even Relander&#x27;s continual state visits and trips drew criticism, leading to him gaining the nickname of &quot;Reissu-Lasse&quot; (Travelling Lasse). He was continually compared to Ståhlberg and his performance as president, which was the almost complete opposite of Relander. Ståhlberg, of course, did not appreciate his successor at all but would have preferred to have seen Ryti as his successor; when Relander was elected, he muttered: The cabinets during his term tended to be weak, short-lived minority cabinets, like in most European democracies of the time. All in all, Relander is remembered as a weak leader. On the other hand, Relander was an idealist, deplored the toughness of political game and preferred minority governments of supposedly excellent individuals over majority governments of unprincipled individuals.

Relander can not be considered a strong president, but he did a few notable things during his single term. He allowed the Social Democrats to form a minority government (1926–1927), appointed Finland&#x27;s first female cabinet minister, Miina Sillanpää (as Assistant Minister of Social Welfare), dissolved Parliament twice (in 1929 over a dispute on the civil servants&#x27; salaries and in 1930 to have the Parliament outlaw the Communist Party, which required a constitutional amendment and thus a two-thirds majority), and generally supported the far-right Lapua Movement until it started to kidnap various political opponents. Relander himself considered his worst mistake to be shaking hands with the leader of the movement, Vihtori Kosola, in connection with a peasant march in the summer of 1930, which was considered to be a good example of Relander&#x27;s indiscretion. He maintained a rather close friendship with the Social Democratic leader, Väinö Tanner.
In the late autumn of 1930, Relander realized he would not be re-elected and during the winter of 1930–31 sabotaged the prospects of his former Agrarian League colleague and rival Kyösti Kallio so that Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, Relander&#x27;s former Prime Minister, was elected. In Relander&#x27;s opinion, Kallio did not talk straight to him and schemed behind his back to weaken his presidency and help his political opponents. In Kallio&#x27;s opinion, Relander was a rather inexperienced politician who had high ideals but not enough common sense to implement them. As it is, the dispute between Relander and Kallio was due to personal chemistry and political line differences, as Relander, for example, was more positive about right-wing radicalism, a nationalist movement like the Lapua Movement, which marked his presidency so badly that his own party representatives were not worth defending. Even later, the battle for the party was later personified by Kallio and J. E. Sunila, the latter of whom was supported by Relander.

After his term as president, he served from 1931 to 1942 as the General Manager of &quot;Suomen maalaisten paloapuyhdistys&quot;, a fire insurance company for rural people. Relander died on 9 February, 1942 of heart failure. He was buried in the Hietaniemi Cemetery.

==Legacy==

The Relander Square (&quot;Relanderinaukio&quot;) in Helsinki&#x27;s Kulosaari was named after Relander in 1959. An abstract Relander Memorial sculpture by Matti Peltokangas was erected on Helsinki&#x27;s Hesperia Esplanade in 1996.

<doc id="164618" wikidata="Q209435" url="?curid=164618" title="Risto Ryti">
<text>Risto Heikki Ryti (; 3 February 1889 – 25 October 1956) was a Finnish politician who served as the fifth president of Finland from 1940 to 1944. Ryti started his career as a politician in the field of economics and as a political background figure during the interwar period. He made a wide range of international contacts in the world of banking and within the framework of the League of Nations. Ryti served as prime minister during the Winter War and the Interim Peace, and as president during the Continuation War.

Ryti penned the 1944 Ryti–Ribbentrop Agreement – named after himself and Joachim von Ribbentrop – a personal letter to Nazi German Führer Adolf Hitler whereby Ryti agreed not to reach a separate peace in the Continuation War against the Soviet Union without approval from Nazi Germany, in order to secure German military aid for Finland to stop the Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive against Finland. His resignation soon afterwards allowed his successor, Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, to bypass the agreement and make peace with the Soviet Union once the offensive had been stopped.

After the war, Ryti was the main defendant in the Finnish war-responsibility trials (1945–1946), which resulted in his conviction for crimes against peace. He was sentenced to ten years&#x27; imprisonment but was pardoned by decision of President Juho Kusti Paasikivi in 1949. His reputation was largely unscathed, but his health had suffered and he never returned to public life.

==Early life and career==
Risto Ryti was born in Huittinen, Satakunta, one of seven sons, among 10 siblings. His parents were Kaarle Evert Ryti, a farmer, and Ida Vivika Junttila. Although he came from a peasant farming background, during his childhood Ryti hardly participated in work on the family&#x27;s large farm, being a bookish and academically inclined boy. He was educated briefly at Pori Grammar School, and was then tutored at home, before enrolling in the University of Helsinki in 1906 to study law. Ryti was the only one among his brothers to pass the university entrance examination; however his three sisters also matriculated.

Ryti graduated in autumn 1909 as Finland was moving into the second period of Russification. Escaping an oppressive political atmosphere in the capital, Ryti returned to his roots in Satakunta, where he established himself as a lawyer in Rauma. During this period he became acquainted with Alfred Kordelin, one of Finland&#x27;s richest men. Ryti became Kordelin&#x27;s lawyer, and eventually the two men became close friends. During this period Ryti also undertook further studies, becoming a Master of Laws in 1912. In the spring of 1914 he moved to Oxford to study maritime law, but the outbreak of World War I forced him to return to Finland. In 1916 he married Gerda Paula Serlachius (1886–1984). They had three children, Henrik (1916–2002), Niilo (1919–1997), and Eva (1922–2009).

In the period after the outbreak of World War I, before Finland achieved its independence, Ryti&#x27;s business relationship with Kordelin grew even closer, and it appeared likely that Kordelin would ask Ryti to become general manager of his numerous business enterprises. However, in November 1917 Ryti and his wife witnessed the murder of Kordelin at the hands of a Russian Bolshevik. Russian seamen led by a Finnish tailor took Kordelin&#x27;s party hostage, with the intent to rob them. Ryti, Kordelin&#x27;s lawyer, refused to legally authorize the robbery despite being threatened at gunpoint. Armed White Guard soldiers were however present and the situation deteriorated into a gunfight. 20 people including Kordelin were killed. Ryti was saved by a malfunction in the enemy&#x27;s firearm.

==Politician and banker==

=== Member of parliament and finance minister ===
During the Finnish Civil War Ryti played no active part, remaining in hiding with his family in Red-dominated Helsinki. Afterwards, however, he would become deeply involved in politics, being elected a National Progressive member of Parliament in 1919, at the age of thirty the second youngest member. In the same year, the party candidate, an admirer of Ryti, Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg, was elected the first president of Finland. Ryti served as a member of Parliament from 1919 to 1924 and from 1927 to 1929. During his first few years in Parliament, Ryti served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and later the Finance Committee. He also served as a member of Helsinki City Council from 1924 to 1927.

According to the Finnish historian Martti Turtola, Ryti succeeded in politics in the first few years after the Finnish Civil War because his liberal, democratic, and republican ideals were popular then. Moreover, Ryti&#x27;s personal political success continued even after his liberal-oriented National Progressive Party shrank to a fringe party, because he was considered an expert especially in economic policy and, very importantly, an impartial servant of the fatherland who refused to play partisan politics (see Martti Turtola, &quot;Risto Ryti: A Life for the Fatherland&quot;).

In 1921, the thirty-two-year-old Ryti was appointed finance minister in the government of Juho Vennola. He served in that position twice until 1924. In 1923 President Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg appointed him governor of the Bank of Finland, a post he remained in until he became prime minister in 1939. Ryti only began to exercise his duties as chairman of the Bank of Finland after he resigned as finance minister in January 1924. During his early years in parliament, Ryti succeeded in bringing order to the government budget. Although he was a Ståhlbergian, Ryti did not approve of pardoning Red prisoners. In his opinion, the Reds were criminals. Ryti refused to see the social background of the Finnish Civil War.

=== Governor of the national bank ===
In 1925 Ryti was also nominated as a presidential candidate at the age of 36. In the second round of voting, he received the most support. However, in the third round the Swedish People&#x27;s Party, which held the balance, moved their votes to Lauri Kristian Relander, and Ryti lost to Relander by 109 votes to 172. Ryti&#x27;s support increased over the years but was never enough in elections. During the 1930s he withdrew from daily politics, but influenced economic policies. Ryti was an orthodox supporter of classical liberal economics. He made his goal to tie the value of Finnish markka to the gold standard. Unlike many other European countries, Finland did not choose deflationary solutions under his leadership; and in 1926 the country shifted to the gold markka. However, after the Great Depression in 1929, Finland was forced to abandon the gold standard following the example of Great Britain.

In the 1920s, Ryti established international contacts with the banking world of Scandinavia, and with Great Britain and the United States. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; recognized his success. In 1934 he was awarded a British honour, being created a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) due to his great merits in Anglo-Finnish relations. He had excellent relations with the leaders of the Bank of England, due to his similar economic policies, such as the belief in the gold standard until the Great Depression, and due to his excellent command of English. In fact, Ryti could regularly telephone the Bank of England&#x27;s leaders when he wanted to discuss economic or financial policies with them (see Martti Turtola, &quot;Risto Ryti: A Life for the Fatherland&quot;). Ryti participated in the activities of the League of Nations as a member of many committees dealing with economic questions and monetary policy.

In the politics of the 1930s, Ryti was an important background figure. His social policy was two-minded. Ryti opposed work programmes for the unemployed and spending on assistance for poor. On the other hand, he thought that the benefits of the strong economics should be distributed evenly over the whole population, not just a few. Ryti played an important part in creating the social welfare of the late 1930s. In general, Ryti was opposed to state intervention in business and industry. He opposed Socialist economics and especially its Soviet forms. Furthermore, Ryti had experienced the Russification period and the Civil War, making him anti-Soviet. Ryti approved of neither German national socialism nor right-wing extremism, and he also opposed the Lapua movement. Ryti was an admirer of British civilisation and culture and of American free enterprise.

==Prime minister and president==

===Ryti–Tanner government during the Winter War===
Ryti had built up relations of trust with leading Social Democratic Party politician Väinö Tanner and President Kyösti Kallio. In late autumn 1939, Ryti was offered the post of prime minister, but he tried to turn down the offer. However, when the Winter War broke out on 30 November, Ryti agreed. He took his post on 1 December. Ryti concentrated on a realistic analysis of the situation, instead of pessimism or over-optimism. He and foreign minister Tanner agreed that the war must be brought to an end as quickly as possible. They both spoke fluent English and had close contact with the Western powers.

At the beginning of the war, the Soviet Union formed a puppet government and cut connections with the Ryti–Tanner government. The Finnish Army fought defensively in battles during December 1939 through February 1940. This gained time and freedom for diplomatic manoeuvering. The Soviet Union was forced to drop the Terijoki Government and accept negotiations via Stockholm. The Western allies&#x27; planned intervention influenced the Soviet government to seek an agreement. Ryti persuaded the rest of the cabinet to settle for peace and signed the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940. The peace agreement, in which Finland lost large land areas and faced the burden of resettling 400,000 refugees, was generally considered crushing.

===From prime minister to president===

Ryti had proved to be a strong prime minister, in contrast to his predecessor Aimo Cajander. President Kallio suffered a stroke in August, and also he had no great experience in foreign policy, so the heavy responsibilities of state leadership were shared by Ryti, Field Marshal C.G.E. Mannerheim, industrialist and general Rudolf Walden, and Tanner. Considering this and the fact Ryti had signed the peace treaty, Ryti became an acceptable figure for the post of president in December 1940 when Kallio resigned.

The exceptional circumstances, such as the lack of a permanent place of residence for many Karelian refugees (see Turtola, &quot;Risto Ryti: A Life for the Fatherland&quot; and Virkkunen, &quot;The Finnish Presidents II&quot;), prevented the election of presidential electors, so a constitutional amendment was enacted by the parliament to enable the electors of 1937 to elect a successor to Kallio. Ryti was chosen with 288 votes out of 300.
On the day of his retirement, 19 December 1940, Kallio suffered a fatal heart attack during a farewell gathering; on the same day, Ryti became the holder of the presidency.

===Towards German orientation===

Finland&#x27;s changed policy from a Scandinavian orientation up to, and during, the Winter War, to a German orientation after the Winter War, was not in the least pursued by the confirmed Anglophile Risto Ryti. He had no illusions about the true nature of Germany. Traditionally Finland had been associated with Britain by stronger commercial ties, but as the Baltic Sea was dominated by the Germans and Soviets, lost markets had to be found elsewhere, and the Germans were willing to trade.

In August 1940 Ryti also agreed to secret military cooperation with Germany. Over time it became increasingly likely that the peace between Germany and the Soviet Union would end, and the experts&#x27; opinion - even among the enemies of Germany - was that in case of invasion the Soviets could not stop the German war machine. Ryti apparently turned, step by step, to being in favour of seizing the opportunity to secure Finnish claims to areas he saw to be in the country&#x27;s interests, in case the great realignment of ownership of East European territory by force were to materialize.

Thus the cooperation begun in late 1940 ultimately developed in 1941 into preparations for re-annexation of the territories lost after the Winter War, in case Nazi Germany were to realize the rumoured plans for an assault on the Soviet Union. The Continuation War, when it commenced, would also come to include occupation of East Karelia, which nationalist circles had championed since the 1910s.

== Continuation War ==
=== Early success and second term ===
When Germany&#x27;s assault on the Soviet Union began in June 1941, Finland remained formally neutral until Soviet air raids gave an expected reason to fulfill the invasion plans some days later. Ryti made his famous radio speech after the outbreak of the Continuation War where he announced that Germany would win the war against the Soviet Union: The speech was later used against him at the War-responsibility trials. Afterwards Ryti stated he did not believe Germany would win as a whole but that its forces would defeat the Soviet Union.

Finnish troops soon regained the territory lost in the Winter War and a substantial buffer zone beyond. A considerable number of members of parliament were not excited by the idea of crossing the old borders, but obviously Ryti convinced Tanner and the Social Democrats to remain in the cabinet despite their opposition to the conquest of East Karelia. Ryti&#x27;s ability to thus maintain a broad coalition government strongly contributed to morale and perceived national unity. In fact, from January 1941 to March 1943, even the far-right Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement (IKL) participated in the government (see, for example, Martti Turtola, &quot;Risto Ryti: A Life for the Fatherland&quot;, Sakari Virkkunen, &quot;The Finnish Presidents II&quot;, and &quot;The Republic&#x27;s Presidents 1940-1956&quot; / Tasavallan presidentit 1940-1956).

Ryti&#x27;s mandate as president was intended to extend only through the rest of Kallio&#x27;s term, i.e., to 1943, but as the government could not organize elections during the Continuation War, the electors from 1937 gathered to re-elect him. This exceptional procedure was mandated by a constitutional amendment passed by the Parliament of Finland. Ryti was elected by an overwhelming majority. Ryti was willing to continue as president because he was among those who led Finland into the war, even though during the winter of 1942, both Ryti and Mannerheim had their doubts about German victory.

=== Attempts at peace negotiations ===

Ryti wanted the government of Jukka Rangell to continue in office. However, the time had arrived for a &quot;peace government&quot;, and it was formed after long negotiations by the chairman of the National Coalition Party, Professor Edwin Linkomies. He started preparations aimed at achieving peace with the Soviet Union in spring 1943. The Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement was excluded from the government. The Soviet Union&#x27;s major counter-offensive began on 9 June 1944, in a situation when Finland&#x27;s relations with Germany were strained due to Finland&#x27;s earlier attempts to secure a separate peace. There were speculations that a change of both government and president would ensue, but Marshal Mannerheim was unwilling to take the job of post-war prime minister even temporarily. Soon, Viipuri, the second biggest city of Finland, fell to the Red Army on 20 June.

The Finnish government tried to create a link for negotiations via Stockholm. The Soviet government replied that it was ready to negotiate, but only after an assurance that Finland would surrender unconditionally. The demand divided the Finnish government as Ryti and Tanner were in favour of replying, but Mannerheim and Linkomies opposed it. The situation was tense, as Finland was in dire need of food as well as weapons and ammunition.

=== Ryti–Ribbentrop Agreement ===
At the same time, the German foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop arrived in Finland on an unexpected visit. He called the Finnish government to commit itself to continue to fight against the Soviet Union. In return he promised military aid. Ryti had wanted parliament to decide on the matter. Mannerheim proposed the sending of a private letter. Finally, Ryti and Mannerheim compromised. The creation of a private letter from Ryti of the kind Mannerheim had envisioned was dealt with at a meeting of the Council of State. The compromise satisfied the Germans, and they expanded their military and food assistance. The military assistance helped the Finns stop the Red Army in the battle of Tali-Ihantala. Afterwards, the letter was named the Ryti–Ribbentrop Agreement.

By mid-July the front situation was stabilized. Ryti signed a letter of resignation in which, against his will, he referred among other things to health reasons. The letter was presented to the cabinet; and it went into effect 4 August 1944. The Finnish parliament appointed Mannerheim president in early August 1944. Peace negotiations could begin again, this time from a stronger position although most territorial gains had been lost by this time. Probably neither Hitler nor any other German authorities had read Ryti&#x27;s previous letter carefully enough, because Finland&#x27;s decision at the start of September 1944 to end its informal military alliance or &quot;brotherhood-in-arms&quot; with Germany surprised and angered the Germans. Probably none of them thought that Ryti would resign soon, and thus give his successor a free hand to break ties with Germany and to start peace negotiations with the Soviet Union.

==Last stages of career==

===War-guilt trials===

After Ryti resigned from the presidency, he was reappointed governor of the Bank of Finland. Jukka Rangell stepped aside to clear the way for Ryti. In autumn 1944, he used tough measures, as he had done during the Great Depression ten years earlier, in the nation&#x27;s monetary policy. The policy was to fight inflation and boost exports. However, in spring 1945 Finnish communists and the Soviet Union demanded he be tried as &quot;responsible for the war&quot;. His defence lawyer was the former foreign minister Hjalmar Procopé.

Ryti was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. Along with Ryti, seven other high officials were sentenced to prison, although for shorter terms. The group was convicted using an ex post facto law, which had been instituted for the purpose by the parliament. Although the Finnish constitution prohibited such legislation, the act in question was passed as a constitutional amendment, with a qualified majority in the parliament. Both the court and the parliament faced severe pressure from the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom during the process. Ryti&#x27;s health failed during his sentence. Most of his stomach had to be removed due to a tumour; in addition, he developed arthritis during his first winter of imprisonment. By 1949, all the other convicts of the war-responsibility trials had been released on parole, while Ryti was hospitalized. He was pardoned by President Juho Kusti Paasikivi that year.

===Final years===
After being freed, Ryti never returned to public life. He concentrated on writing his memoirs but was not successful due to ill health. In 1952, he attended a university students&#x27; celebration where he accepted a badge of honour.

Although he refused to return to politics, Ryti voted regularly. In May 1956, just five months before his death, he received an honorary doctorate in political science from the Helsinki University.

Risto Ryti died in October 1956 and was buried with full presidential honors.

== Post-Soviet legacy ==

After the Soviet Union collapsed, Ryti&#x27;s reputation was publicly, but not officially, restored. The government&#x27;s position on the propositions for the rehabilitation of Ryti and his fellow convicts has been that an official rehabilitation is unnecessary as the honour of the convicted has never been lost. The idea of annulling the sentences or the act retroactively has been considered to be unnecessary and contrary to Finnish judicial practice.

In 1994, a statue of Ryti was unveiled near the Parliament House. In 2004, in the YLE TV-series Suuret suomalaiset (&quot;Great Finns&quot;) Risto Ryti got the second highest number of votes.

== Freemason and believer in Fate and spirituality ==
Risto Ryti was a Freemason, but after his prison sentence, was required to give up membership in his lodge, as convicts were barred from membership. He had become a Freemason in 1924, but according to the Finnish Grand Lodge&#x27;s assistant grand scribe Reijo Ahtokari, he did not very actively participate in Masonic activities. In January 1941, he appointed a fellow Freemason, Johan Wilhelm &quot;Jukka&quot; Rangell, as prime minister only after his secretary Lauri Puntila suggested that he do so.

Ryti did, according to some of his friends and acquaintances, strongly believe in fate. After a dinner in the 1930s at the home of a friend, Alvar Renqvist, in Helsinki, Ryti told the other guests, according to , Alvar Renqvist&#x27;s grandson: &quot;In my life, fate has been the ruling force. If it had not been benevolent, I would not sit here now.&quot;

One of Finland&#x27;s most famous clairvoyants, Aino Kassinen, recalled in her memoirs that she met Ryti in the 1930s in Helsinki, and got the understanding that Ryti strongly believed in people&#x27;s being guided by the higher divine powers, and that he strongly believed in God, and had studied theosophy and anthroposophy. Ryti&#x27;s wife Gerda was a much more active spiritualist and theosophist than Ryti himself; she even claimed to have a spirit guide.

==In popular culture==
Ryti was played by Pertti Sveholm in the 2001 television film &quot;Valtapeliä elokuussa 1940&quot;, directed by Veli-Matti Saikkonen.

<doc id="164619" wikidata="Q214029" url="?curid=164619" title="Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg">
<text>Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg ( , ; 28 January 1865 – 22 September 1952) was a Finnish jurist and academic who was one of the most important pioneers of republicanism in the country. He was the first president of Finland (1919–1925) and a liberal nationalist.

Ståhlberg was an important figure in the drafting of Finland&#x27;s republican constitution. As a jurist, he anchored the state in liberal democracy, guarded the fragile germ of the rule of law, and embarked on internal reforms. In implementing the form of government of 1919, Ståhlberg piloted an independent Finland towards acting in world politics; in presidential-led foreign and security policy, he relied on international law and diplomacy.

It was only after the opening of private archives of President J. K. Paasikivi that it was realized that Ståhlberg had a very significant political role as an “éminence grise” until his death. He was asked for advice and opinions, which were also followed. Paasikivi highly valued Ståhlberg, and even described his predecessor in exaggerated words: “Ståhlberg was a man who never made mistakes”.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Ståhlberg was born in Suomussalmi, in the Kainuu region of the Grand Duchy of Finland, back when Finland was an autonomous principality under the rule of the Russian Empire. He was the second child of Johan (Janne) Gabriel Ståhlberg, an assistant pastor, and Amanda Gustafa Castrén. On both sides of his family, Ståhlberg&#x27;s male forebears had been Lutheran clergymen. He was christened &quot;Carl Johan&quot; (), but later Finnicized his forenames to &quot;Kaarlo Juho&quot;, as did most Fennomans (i.e. the supporters of Finnish language and culture instead of Swedish).
Ståhlberg and his family lived in Lahti, where he also went for grammar school. Ståhlberg&#x27;s father died when he was a boy, leaving his family in a difficult financial position. The family moved to Oulu, where the children entered school. Kaarlo&#x27;s mother Amanda worked to support the family until her death in 1879. Ståhlberg&#x27;s family had always spoken and supported the Finnish language, and the young Ståhlberg was enrolled in Oulu&#x27;s private Finnish lycee, where he would excel, and was the primus of his class. In 1889 he graduated as a Bachelor of Arts in Law from the University of Helsinki. He gained his Doctorate in Law in 1893.

===Career as academic and civil servant===
Ståhlberg soon began a very long career as the presenter and planner of the Senate&#x27;s legislation, during the period when Finland was a Grand Duchy under Czarist rule. He was a &quot;&quot;constitutionalist&quot; – supporting the already existing Finnish constitutional framework and constitutional legislative policies, including legislative resistance, against the attempted Russification of Finland. He also came to support the call for women&#x27;s suffrage, and had a moderate line on Prohibition.

Ståhlberg served as secretary of the Diet of Finland&#x27;s finance committee in 1891 before being appointed as an assistant professor of Administrative Law and Economics at the University of Helsinki in 1894. It was at this time that he began his active involvement in politics, becoming a member of the Young Finnish Party.

In 1893, Ståhlberg married his first wife, Hedvig Irene Wåhlberg (1869–1917). They had six children together: Kaarlo (1894–1977), Aino (1895–1974), Elli (1899–1986), Aune (1901–1967), Juho (1907–1973), and Kyllikki (1908–1994).

In 1898, Ståhlberg was appointed as Protocol Secretary for the Senate&#x27;s civil affairs subdepartment. This was the second-highest Rapporteur position in the Finnish government. This appointment to a senior position in the Finnish administration was approved by the new Governor General of Finland, Nikolai Bobrikov, whose term in office saw the beginning of the period of Russification, and whose policies represented all that the &quot;constitutionalist&quot; Ståhlberg was opposed to. Ståhlberg was elected in 1901 as a member of Helsinki City Council, serving until 1903. In 1902, he was dismissed as Protocol Secretary, due to his strict legalist views, and his opposition to legislation on compulsory military service.

===Career as politician===
Ståhlberg participated in the Diet of Finland (1904–1905) as a member of the Estate of Burgesses. In 1905, he was appointed as a Senator in the newly formed Senate of Leo Mechelin, with responsibility for trade and industry. One of the most important tasks facing the new &quot;constitutionalist&quot; Senate was to consider proposals for the reform of the Diet of Finland and, although initially sceptical about some of the proposal, Ståhlberg played a role in the drafting of the legislation which created the Parliament of Finland. Ståhlberg resigned from the Senate in 1907, due to Parliament&#x27;s rejection of a Senate bill on the prohibition of alcohol.

The following year he resumed his academic career and was appointed as Professor of Administrative Law at the University of Helsinki, a position he retained until 1918. During his time in that post he wrote his most influential piece of work, &quot;Finnish administrative law, volumes I &amp; II&quot;.&quot; He also remained active in politics, being elected to the central committee of the Young Finnish Party. In 1908, Ståhlberg was elected as a member of Parliament for the Southern Häme constituency, which he represented until 1910. He also served as a member for the Southern Oulu constituency from 1913 until his appointment as President of the Supreme Administrative Court in 1918. Ståhlberg also served as Speaker of the Parliament in 1914.

After the February Revolution in 1917, Ståhlberg was backed by the majority of the non-socialists members of Parliament as a candidate to become Vice-Chairman of the Economic Department of the Senate. However, he did not receive the support of the Social Democrats, which he had made a precondition of his being elected. Instead, the Social Democrat Oskari Tokoi was elected, with Ståhlberg being appointed as chairman of the Constitutional Council. This body had been set up earlier to draw up plans for a new form of government for Finland, in light of the events surrounding the February Revolution and the abdication of Nicholas II as Emperor of Russia and Grand Duke of Finland.

The new form of government approved by the council was largely based on the 1772 Instrument of Government, dating from the period of Swedish rule. The proposed form of government was rejected by the Russian Provisional Government, and was then left largely forgotten for a time due to the confusion and urgency of the situation surrounding the October Revolution and the declaration of Finland&#x27;s independence.

===Architect of the Finnish constitution===
After Finland gained its independence in December 1917, the Constitutional Committee drafted new proposals for a form of government of an independent Republic of Finland. As chairman of the council, Ståhlberg was involved in the drafting and re-drafting of constitutional proposals during 1918, when the impact of the Finnish Civil War, and debates between republicans and monarchists on the future constitution, all led to various proposals. His proposals would eventually be enacted as the Constitution of Finland in 1919. In 1918, Ståhlberg supported the idea of republic instead of a constitutional monarchy which was supported by more conservative victors of the civil war. Ståhlberg&#x27;s appointment as the first President of the Supreme Administrative Court in 1918 meant that he relinquished his role as a member of Parliament, and was therefore not involved in the election by the Parliament of Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse as King of Finland in October of that year. As it became clear that Finland would be a republic, Stålberg also championed direct election of the President of Finland, but the Council of State chose the electoral college system, although the first President would be elected by Parliament.

===First President of Finland===

Ståhlberg emerged as a candidate for president, with the support of the newly formed National Progressive Party, of which he was a member, and the Agrarian League. In the 1919 Finnish presidential election, he was elected by Parliament as President of the Republic on 25 July 1919, defeating Carl Gustaf Mannerheim (the candidate supported by the National Coalition and Swedish People&#x27;s parties) by 143 votes to 50.

Ståhlberg was inaugurated as the first President of the Republic on the following day, and reluctantly moved out of his home in Helsinki to take up residence in the Presidential Palace.

Ståhlberg had been a widower since 1917, but in 1920, as president, he married his second wife, Ester Hällström (1870–1950). He was also very formal and, due to his shyness, wrote everything he had to say in public beforehand. He also had a distaste for official occasions, and he did not like travel or state visits, which is why, despite invitations and exhortations, he made no visits abroad during his presidency and received only one guest, Estonian President Konstantin Päts in May 1922. The Estonian head of state&#x27;s visit was the first official visit to independent Finland. Finland&#x27;s Ambassador to Stockholm, Werner Söderhjelm, repeatedly offered Ståhlberg a visit to its western neighbor Sweden, but Ståhlberg maintained his position:The first official visit of the President of Finland abroad was made only by his successor, President L. K. Relander.

As the first President of the Republic, Ståhlberg had to form various presidential precedents and interpretations of how the office of President should be conducted. His term in office was also marked by a succession of short-lived governments. During his time as president, Ståhlberg nominated and appointed eight governments. These were mostly coalitions of the Agrarians and the National Progressive, National Coalition and Swedish People&#x27;s parties, although Ståhlberg also appointed two caretaker governments. Importantly, Ståhlberg generally supported all the governments that he nominated, although he also sometimes disagreed with them.
He forced Kyösti Kallio&#x27;s first government to resign in January 1924, when he demanded early elections to restore the full membership of Parliament – 200 deputies – and Kallio disagreed. The Parliament had lacked 27 deputies since August 1923, when the Communist deputies had been arrested on suspicions of treason.

Ståhlberg supported moderate social and economic reforms to make even the former Reds accept the democratic republic. He pardoned
most of the Red prisoners, despite the strong criticism that this aroused from many right-wing Finns, especially the White veterans
of the Civil War and several senior army officers. He signed into law bills that gave the trade unions an equal power with the employers&#x27; organizations to negotiate labour contracts, a bill to improve the public care for the poor, and the Lex Kallio law which distributed land from the wealthy landowners to the former tenant farmers and other landless rural people.

In foreign policy Ståhlberg was markedly reserved towards Sweden, largely as a consequence of the Åland crisis, which marked the early years of his presidency. He was also cautious towards Germany, and generally unsuccessful in his attempts to establish closer contacts with Poland, the United Kingdom and France.

===Post-presidential life===
Ståhlberg did not seek re-election in 1925, finding his difficult term of office a great strain. He also believed that the right-wing and the monarchists would become more reconciled to the republic if he stepped down. According to the longtime late Agrarian and Centrist politician Johannes Virolainen, he believed that the incumbent president was too much favoured over the other candidates while standing for re-election.

Ståhlberg did not appreciate his presidential successor, Lauri Kristian Relander, at all, because Relander was the almost complete opposite of Ståhlberg. He would have preferred to have seen Risto Ryti as his successor; but when Relander was elected, he muttered: 

He was offered the post of Chancellor of the University of Helsinki, but declined it, instead becoming a member of the government&#x27;s Law Drafting Committee. He also served as a National Progressive member of Parliament again, as a member for the Uusimaa constituency from 1930 to 1933.

In 1930, activists from the right-wing Lapua Movement kidnapped him and his wife, attempting to send them to the Soviet Union, but the incident merely hastened the Lapua Movement&#x27;s demise.

Ståhlberg was a National Progressive Party candidate in the 1931 Presidential election, eventually losing to Pehr Evind Svinhufvud by only two votes in the third ballot. He was also a candidate in the 1937 election, eventually finishing third.

In 1946, Ståhlberg retired and became the legal adviser of President J. K. Paasikivi. Paasikivi often consulted Ståhlberg; for example, under the 1950 presidential election an emergency plan was planned to extend Paasikivi&#x27;s term in parliament as president, which Ståhlberg condemned angrily in his letter to Paasikivi:Their last discussion occurred less than two weeks before Ståhlberg died. He died on 22 September, 1952, and was buried in Helsinki&#x27;s Hietaniemi cemetery with full honours.

Among Finnish Presidents, Ståhlberg has retained a remarkably impeccable reputation. He is generally regarded as a moral and
principled defender of democracy and of the rule of law, and as the father of the Finnish Constitution. His decision to voluntarily
give up the presidency is also generally speaking admired as a sign that he was not a power-hungry career politician.

<text>Pehr Evind Svinhufvud af Qvalstad (, 15 December 1861 – 29 February 1944) was the third president of Finland from 1931 to 1937. Serving as a lawyer, judge, and politician in the Grand Duchy of Finland, which was at that time an autonomous state under the Russian Empire’s rule, Svinhufvud played a major role in the movement for Finnish independence. He was the one who presented the Declaration of Independence to the Parliament.

From December 1917, Svinhufvud was the first head of government of independent Finland as Chairman of the Senate. He led the White government during the Finnish Civil War while Mannerheim led their armies. After the war, he served as Finland&#x27;s first temporary head of state with the title of Regent during the project to establish a German-aligned monarchy in the country, until late 1918 when he stepped down in favour of Mannerheim. He later served as Prime Minister from 1930 to 1931, before being elected to the presidency. As president, he was notable for putting an end to the Mäntsälä rebellion.

As a conservative and nationalist who was strong in his opposition to communism and the Left in general, Svinhufvud did not become a President embraced by all the people, although as the amiable &quot;Ukko-Pekka&quot; (&quot;Old Man Pekka&quot;), he did enjoy wide popularity. Svinhufvud&#x27;s sharp line as a defender of Finland&#x27;s legal rights during the period under Russian rule was especially valued in the early years of independence until the end of the World War II, unlike in later decades. Ever since communism and the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s, appreciation of Svinhufvud has begun to increase.

==Family background and early life==
Pehr Evind Svinhufvud af Qvalstad was born in Sääksmäki. He was the son of Pehr Gustaf Svinhufvud af Qvalstad II, a sea captain, and Olga von Becker. His father drowned at sea off Greece in 1863, when Pehr Evind was only two years old. He spent his early childhood at the home of his paternal grandfather, Per Gustaf Svinhufvud af Qvalstad (a provincial treasurer of Häme), at Rapola, where the family had lived for five generations. The Svinhufvuds (literally translated as &quot;Swine-head&quot;) are a Finland-Swedish noble family tracing their history back to Dalarna, Sweden. Pehr Gustaf Svinhufvud af Qvalstad, an army lieutenant in the reign of Charles XII, had moved from there to Rapola after the Great Northern War. The family had been ennobled in Sweden in 1574, and it was also introduced to the Finnish House of Nobility in 1818. Rapola was sold when his grandfather shot himself in 1866, and Svinhufvud moved to Helsinki with his mother and his sister.

He attended the Swedish-language high school in Helsinki. In 1878, at the age of 16, he enrolled at the Imperial Alexander University of Helsinki. There he gained a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1881, and then completed a Master of Arts degree in 1882; his main subjects being Finnish, Russian and Scandinavian History. After this, he took a Master of Laws degree, graduating in 1886. In 1889, Svinhufvud married Alma (Ellen) Timgren (1869–1953). They had six children, Yngve (1890–1991), Ilmo Gretel (1892–1969), Aino Mary (1893–1980), Eino (1896–1938), Arne (1904–1942), and Veikko (1908–1969).

==A lawyer and a politician==
Svinhufvud&#x27;s career in law followed a regular course: he worked as a lawyer, served at district courts, and served as a deputy judge at the Turku Court of Appeal. In 1892 he was appointed as a member of the Senate&#x27;s law-drafting committee at the relatively young age of 31. For six years he worked in the committee, initially redrafting taxation laws. As head of his family, Svinhufvud participated as a member of the Estate of Nobles in the Diet of Finland in 1894 and 1899–1906.

He found his work on the law-drafting committee tedious and moved to the Court of Appeal as an assistant judge in 1902, his long-term goal being the easy life of a rural judge. Svinhufvud stayed mainly in the background until 1899, when Imperial Russia initiated a Russification policy for the autonomous Grand Duchy. The Finnish answer was mainly legislative and constitutional resistance, of which Svinhufvud became a central figure as a judge in the Court of Appeals.

When some inhabitants of Helsinki lodged a complaint with the Turku Court of Appeal in 1902, concerning violence employed by the Russian Governor of Uusimaa to break up a demonstration against military call-ups, the court initiated proceedings against Governor-General Bobrikov. Bobrikov demanded that they be stopped, and when this did not happen, he used a decree which the Finns regarded as illegal to dismiss sixteen officials of the court, including Svinhufvud.

Originally a moderate of the Finnish Party or Old Finnish Party, after his dismissal Svinhufvud became a strict constitutionalist who regarded the resistance of judges and officials as a question of justice, not believing that political expediency offered compromises. He moved to Helsinki to work as a lawyer and participated in the political activities both of the Diet and of a secret society, &quot;Kagal&quot;.

Svinhufvud played a key role in the birth of a new parliamentary system in 1905 and he was elected as a Young Finnish Party member of the new Parliament in 1906. Svinhufvud went on to serve as a member of Parliament on four occasions (1907–1908, 1908–1914, 1917, and 1930–1931).

After being appointed as a judge in Heinola in 1906, he attempted to keep out of the front line of politics. However he was elected Speaker of the Parliament in 1907, largely because the majority Social Democrats considered him &quot;the best-known opponent of illegality&quot;. Svinhufvud&#x27;s parliamentary opening speeches, in which he laid emphasis on legality, led to the Tsar dissolving Parliament in both 1909 and 1910. He served as Speaker until 1912. Svinhufvud also served as a judge in Lappee 1908–1914.

During the First World War Russia replaced various Finnish officials with Russians. Svinhufvud refused to obey the orders of the Russian procurator Konstantin Kazansky, which he considered illegal, and this led to his removal from office as a judge and being exiled to Tomsk in Siberia in November 1914. In his Siberian exile, he spent his time hunting and mending his clothes, still keeping secret contact with the independence movement. When he left Finland, he had promised to return &quot;with the help of God and Hindenburg&quot;. When news of the February Revolution reached Svinhufvud, he walked to the town&#x27;s police station and bluntly announced, &quot;The person who sent me here has been arrested. Now I&#x27;m going home.&quot; In Helsinki he was greeted as a national hero.

==Independence and the Civil War==
Svinhufvud was appointed as Chairman of the Senate on 27 November 1917, and was a key figure in the announcement of Finland&#x27;s declaration of independence on 6 December 1917. He also personally went to Saint Petersburg with Carl Enckell and Gustaf Idman to meet Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, who gave his official recognition of Finnish independence. This is how the meeting is told in Svinhufvud&#x27;s biography &quot;Svinhufvud ja itsenäisyyssenaatti&quot; written by Erkki Räikkönen: 

Svinhufvud&#x27;s Senate also authorized General Mannerheim to form a new Finnish army on the basis on White Guard, the (chiefly Rightist) volunteer militia called the &quot;Suojeluskunta,&quot; an act simultaneously coinciding with the beginning of the Civil War in Finland.

During the Civil War, Svinhufvud went underground in Helsinki and sent pleas for intervention to Germany and Sweden. The conflict also turned him into an active monarchist, though not a royalist. In March 1918 he managed to escape via Berlin-Stockholm to the Senate, now located in Vaasa, where he resumed his function as head of government. In this role he pardoned 36,000 Red prisoners in the autumn of 1918. On 18 May, Svinhufvud became Protector of State or Regent, retaining this post as head of state after he stood down as Chairman of the Senate on 27 May.

After Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I, and the failed attempt to make Finland a monarchy under the King of Finland (Frederick Charles of Hesse was elected), Svinhufvud withdrew from public life and was active only in the anti-communist &quot;Suojeluskunta&quot; militia.

==Prime Minister and President==

In 1925 he was the presidential candidate for the conservative &quot;Kokoomus&quot; party, but was not elected. After the emergence of the anti-communist Lapua Movement, President Relander appointed him as Prime Minister of Finland on the Lapua Movement&#x27;s insistence. Svinhufvud was elected president in 1931, and appointed Mannerheim as Chairman of the Defence Council, not least of all as an answer to the Lapua Movement&#x27;s fear of having fought the Civil War in vain.

He resisted both communist agitation and the Lapua Movement&#x27;s exploits. All Communist members of parliament were arrested. In February 1932 there was a so-called Mäntsälä Rebellion, when the &quot;Suojeluskunta&quot;-Militia and the Lapua Movement demanded the Cabinet&#x27;s resignation. The turning point came with the President&#x27;s broadcast radio speech, in which he called on the rebels to surrender and ordered all Civil Guard members who were heading for Mäntsälä to return to their homes:

 His speech stopped the rebellion before anything serious happened.

Svinhufvud was not a supporter of Parliamentarism, or to put it differently, he believed that the President had a right to choose the Cabinet ministers after first consulting the parliamentary parties. Evidence of this semi-presidential attitude was the minority government of Toivo M. Kivimäki, which survived for 3 years and 10 months (December 1932 – October 1936). Svinhufvud strongly supported it, because he believed that it could effectively fight the Great Depression (which it did, generally speaking), he believed that Kivimäki had a strong personality like himself, and possibly because he hoped that the Agrarians and Swedish People&#x27;s Party would let the Kivimäki government remain in office as a lesser evil, the greater evil being an Agrarian-Social Democratic government.

On the other hand, when a right-wing Conservative member of Parliament, Edwin Linkomies, proposed in 1934 that Finland abandon parliamentarism in favour of a government led by the President and that the President be given an absolute veto power over the laws passed by the Parliament, Svinhufvud opposed his ideas. In Svinhufvud&#x27;s opinion, the Finnish President had enough power to lead the country, provided that the President had a strong personality. He believed it to be better for Finland if the Social Democrats could be kept outside of the Cabinet. In his opinion, they would implement too radical reforms that would lead the Finnish society into chaos or Marxism. On the other hand, he was realistic enough to admit privately to the German Ambassador to Finland, Wipert von Blücher, that if he was re-elected, he would be unable to keep the Social Democrats in the opposition.

They were, after all, Finland&#x27;s largest political party with over 40% of the deputies (see, for example, Seppo Zetterberg et al., ed., &quot;A Small Giant of the Finnish History&quot; / Suomen historian pikkujättiläinen, Helsinki: Werner Söderström Publications Ltd., 2003; Virkkunen, &quot;The Finnish Presidents I&quot;). It was due to this that, in the presidential election of 1937, the Social Democrats and the Agrarian party voted against him. He was not re-elected.

At the end of Winter War, he unsuccessfully sought audience with both Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini but met only Pope Pius XII. During the Continuation War he supported the idea of an expansionistic war.

Svinhufvud&#x27;s most important and beloved hobbies were hunting and precision shooting. His grandson Jorma Svinhufvud describes: 

Svinhufvud died at Luumäki in 1944, while Finland was seeking peace with the Soviet Union.

He refused to Finnicize the name of his 500-year-old noble house.

<text>Lauri Allan Törni (28 May 1919 – 18 October 1965), later known as Larry Alan Thorne, was a Finnish-born soldier who fought under three flags: as a Finnish Army officer in the Winter War and the Continuation War ultimately gaining a rank of captain; as a &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; captain (under the alias Larry Laine) of the Finnish Volunteer Battalion of the Waffen-SS when he fought the Red Army on the Eastern Front in World War II; and as a United States Army Major (under the alias &quot;Larry Thorne&quot;) when he served in the U.S. Army Special Forces in the Vietnam War.

Törni died in a helicopter crash that occurred on October 18, 1965, during a covert mission in Laos amidst the Vietnam War. Serving with the U.S. Army Special Forces, Törni was involved in operations conducted by MACV-SOG when the helicopter he was on crashed under unclear circumstances. The crash site was difficult to locate due to the rugged terrain and adverse weather conditions, delaying recovery efforts. Törni&#x27;s remains, along with those of other soldiers aboard, were eventually found three decades later.

==Early life and education==
Christened Lauri Allan Törni, he was born in Viipuri, Viipuri Province, Finland, to ship captain Jalmari (Ilmari) Törni, and his wife, Rosa Maria (née Kosonen). He had two sisters: Salme Kyllikki Rajala (b. 1920) and Kaija Iris Mikkola (b. 1922). An athletic youth, Törni was an early friend of future Olympic Boxing Gold Medalist Sten Suvio. After attending business school and serving with the Civil Guard, Törni entered military service in 1938, joining Jaeger Battalion 4 stationed at Kiviniemi; when the Winter War began in November 1939, his enlistment was extended and his unit confronted invading Soviet troops at Rautu.

==Career==

===World War II===
During the battles at Lake Ladoga, Törni took part in the destruction of the encircled Soviet divisions in Lemetti.

His performance during these engagements was noticed by his commanders, and toward the end of the conflict, he was assigned to officer training where he was commissioned as a Vänrikki (2nd lieutenant) in the reserves. After the Winter War, in June 1941, Törni went to Vienna, Austria for seven weeks of training with the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;, and returned to Finland in July; as a Finnish officer, the Germans recognized him as an Untersturmführer.
Most of Törni&#x27;s reputation was based on his successful actions in the Continuation War (1941–44) between the Soviet Union and Finland. In 1943, a unit informally named &quot;Detachment Törni&quot; was created under his command. This was an infantry unit that penetrated deep behind enemy lines and soon enjoyed a reputation on both sides of the front for its combat effectiveness. One of Törni&#x27;s subordinates was future President of Finland Mauno Koivisto. Koivisto served in a reconnaissance company under Törni&#x27;s command during the Battle of Ilomantsi, the final Finnish-Soviet engagement of the Continuation War, during July and August 1944. Törni&#x27;s unit inflicted such heavy casualties on Soviet units that the Soviet Army placed a bounty of 3,000,000 Finnish marks on his head. He was decorated with the Mannerheim Cross 2nd Class on 9 July 1944.
The September 1944 Moscow Armistice required the Finnish government to remove German troops from its territory, resulting in the Lapland War; during this period, much of the Finnish Army was demobilized, including Törni, leaving him unemployed in November 1944. In January 1945, he was recruited by the Pro-German resistance movement in Finland and left for saboteur training in Germany, with the intention of organizing resistance in case Finland was occupied by the Soviet Union. The training was prematurely ended in March, but as Törni could not secure transportation to Finland, he joined a German unit to fight Soviet troops near Schwerin, Germany. He surrendered to British troops in the last stages of World War II and eventually returned to Finland in June 1945 after escaping a British POW camp in Lübeck, Germany.

As his family had been evacuated from Karelia, Törni sought to rejoin them in Helsinki but was arrested by Valpo, the Finnish state police. After escaping, he was arrested a second time in April 1946, and tried for treason for continuing to serve in the German military during the Lapland War. A trial in October and November resulted in a six-year sentence in January 1947. Imprisoned at the Turku provincial prison, Törni escaped in June, but was recaptured and sent to the Riihimäki State Prison. President Juho Paasikivi granted him a pardon in December 1948.
===Emigration to the United States===
In 1949, Törni, accompanied by his wartime executive officer Holger Pitkänen, traveled to Sweden, crossing the border from Tornio to Haparanda (Haaparanta), where many inhabitants are ethnic Finns. From Haparanda, Törni traveled by railroad to Stockholm where he stayed with Baroness von Essen, who harbored many fugitive Finnish officers following the war. Pitkänen was arrested and repatriated to Finland. In Sweden, Törni fell in love with a Swedish Finn, Marja Kops, and was soon engaged to be married. In order to secure employment, Törni traveled under an alias as a Swedish seaman aboard the SS &quot;Bolivia&quot;, destined for Caracas, Venezuela, where he met one of his Winter War commanders, the Finnish colonel Matti Aarnio, who was in exile in Venezuela after the war. Törni hid on a Swedish cargo ship, the MS &quot;Skagen&quot;, which traveled from Caracas for the United States in 1950.

While in the Gulf of Mexico, near Mobile, Alabama, Törni jumped overboard and swam to shore. Now a political refugee, Törni traveled to New York City where he was helped by the Finnish-American community living in Brooklyn&#x27;s Sunset Park &quot;Finntown&quot;. There he worked as a carpenter and cleaner. In 1953, Törni was granted a residence permit through an Act of Congress that was shepherded by the law firm of &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Donovan, former head of the Office of Strategic Services.

====United States Army====
Törni enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1954 under the provisions of the Lodge-Philbin Act and adopted the name Larry Thorne. In the U.S. Army, he was befriended by a group of Finnish-American officers who came to be known as &quot;Marttinen&#x27;s Men&quot; (fin. &quot;Marttisen miehet&quot;).

With their support, Thorne joined the U.S. Army Special Forces. While in the Special Forces, he taught skiing, survival, mountaineering, and guerrilla tactics. In turn he attended airborne school, and advanced in rank to sergeant. Receiving his US citizenship in 1957, Thorne attended Officer Candidate School, and was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the Signal Corps. He later received a Regular Army commission and a promotion to captain in 1960. From 1958 to 1962, he served in the 10th Special Forces Group in West Germany at Bad Tölz, from where he was second-in-command of a search and recovery mission high in the Zagros Mountains of Iran, which gained him a notable reputation. When he was in Germany, he briefly visited his relatives in Finland. In an episode of &quot;The Big Picture&quot; released in 1962 and composed of footage filmed in 1959, Thorne is shown as a lieutenant with the 10th Special Forces Group in the United States Army.

===Vietnam War===
Deploying to South Vietnam in November 1963 to support Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces in the Vietnam War, Thorne and Special Forces Detachment A-734 were stationed in the Tịnh Biên District and assigned to operate Civilian Irregular Defense Group (CIDG) encampments at Châu Lăng and later Tịnh Biên.

During a fierce attack on the CIDG camp in Tịnh Biên, he received two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star Medal for valor during the battle.

Thorne&#x27;s second tour in Vietnam began in February 1965 with 5th Special Forces Group; he then transferred to Military Assistance Command, Vietnam – Studies and Observations Group (MACV–SOG), a classified US special operations unit focusing on unconventional warfare in Vietnam, as a military advisor.

On 18 October 1965, as part of the operation Shining Brass, Thorne was supervising the first clandestine mission to locate Viet Cong turnaround points along the Ho Chi Minh trail and destroy them with airstrikes. Two Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) CH-34 helicopters launched from Kham Duc Special Forces Camp and rendezvoused with a United States Air Force Cessna O-1 Bird Dog Forward Air Controller in inclement weather in a mountainous area of Phước Sơn District, Quảng Nam Province, Vietnam, from Da Nang. While one CH-34 descended through a gap in the weather to drop off the six-man team, the command CH-34 carrying Thorne and the O-1 loitered nearby. When the drop helicopter returned above the cloud cover, both the CH-34 and the O-1 had disappeared. Rescue teams were unable to locate the crash site. Shortly after his disappearance, Thorne was promoted to the rank of major and posthumously awarded the Legion of Merit and Distinguished Flying Cross.

In 1999, Thorne&#x27;s remains were found by a Finnish and Joint Task Force-Full Accounting team and repatriated to the United States following a Hanoi Noi Bai International Airport ceremony that included Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Ambassador Pete Peterson.
Formally identified in 2003, his remains were buried on 26 June 2003 at Arlington National Cemetery, along with the RVNAF casualties of the mission recovered at the crash site. He was memorialized on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial at Panel 02E, Line 126. He was survived only by his fiancée, Marja Kops.

===Distinguished Flying Cross citation===

Citation:

The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 2, 1926, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Flying Cross (Posthumously) to Major (Infantry), (then Captain) Larry Alan Thorne (ASN: 0-2287104), United States Army, for heroism while participating in aerial flight on 18 October 1965 in the Republic of Vietnam. Major Thorne was operations officer responsible for launching a small, combined reconnaissance patrol on an extremely hazardous mission into a suspected Viet Cong stronghold. Due to the extreme hazards attending this mission, including weather and enemy action, Major Thorne volunteered to accompany submission aircraft during the introduction of the patrol in place of the assigned individual. After delivering the patrol to the landing zone, Major Thorne remained with one aircraft in the immediate area to receive an initial report from the patrol on the ground. This report was mandatory since only the vaguest information was available about enemy disposition near the landing zone. If the patrol were immediately confronted by a superior force, Major Thorne would land and extricate the patrol under fire. This was done with total disregard for the inherent dangers and with selfless concern for the ground forces. In so doing, he exposed himself to extreme personal danger which ultimately led to his disappearance and the loss of his aircraft. He had, however, guaranteed the safe introduction of the patrol into the area, the successful accomplishment of this mission and had positioned himself to react to any immediate calls for assistance from the patrol. Due to Major Thorne&#x27;s efforts, the mission was accomplished successfully and contributed significantly to the overall mission of interdicting Viet Cong activities within the area. Major Thorne&#x27;s actions were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service, and reflect great credit upon himself and the United States Army.

==Commemoration==
In the 1965 book &quot;The Green Berets&quot; by Robin Moore, the &quot;Sven Kornie&quot; (or Captain Steve Kornie) main character in the first chapter was based on Thorne.

In the 1990s, Törni&#x27;s name became better known, with numerous books being written about him. He was named 52nd in the &quot;Suuret Suomalaiset&quot; listing of famous Finns; in the 2006 &quot;Suomen Sotilas&quot; (&quot;Soldier of Finland&quot;) magazine listing, he was elected most courageous of the Mannerheim Cross recipients.

In Finland, the survivors, friends, and families of Detachment Törni formed the Lauri Törni Tradition Guild. The Infantry Museum (Jalkaväkimuseo) in Mikkeli, Finland, has an exhibit dedicated to Törni, as does the Military Museum of Finland in Helsinki.

Even before his death, Thorne&#x27;s name was legendary in US Special Forces. His US memorial is the Larry Thorne Headquarters Building, 10th SFG(A), Fort Carson, Colorado. 10th Group honors him yearly by presenting the Larry Thorne Award to the best Operational Detachment-Alpha in the command. The Special Forces Association Chapter 33 in Cleveland, Tennessee is named after him.

In 2010 he was named as the first Honorary Member of the United States Army Special Forces Regiment and in 2011 he was inducted into the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Commando Hall of Honor.

In their 2013 book &quot;Tuntematon Lauri Törni&quot; [&quot;Unknown Lauri Törni&quot;], authors Juha Pohjonen and Oula Silvennoinen write that Törni&#x27;s conviction for treason was justified because the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; training he received at the end of World War II was provided to help achieve a National Socialist coup in Finland. This view has been challenged by Törni Heritage Guild members Markku Moberg and Pasi Niittymäki, who acknowledge that Törni faced pressure from the war and alcohol consumption, but contend that he did not support Germany. Furthermore, Finnish historian and later Minister of Defence (2015–2019) Jussi Niinistö of the right-wing populist Finns Party argued that Törni&#x27;s training was actually motivated by patriotism towards his native country, and accused Pohjonen and Silvennoinen of stirring up hatred in order to promote sales of their book while disregarding &quot;the fact that in Finland there was a genuine fear that Russia would occupy Finland.&quot;

<text>Mika Toimi Waltari (; 19 September 1908 – 26 August 1979) was a Finnish writer, best known for his best-selling novel &quot;The Egyptian&quot; (). He was extremely productive. Besides his novels he also wrote poetry, short stories, crime novels, plays, essays, travel stories, film scripts, and rhymed texts for comic strips by Asmo Alho.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Waltari was born in Helsinki on 19 September 1908. His parents were Toimi Waltari and Olga Johansson; Toimi was a Lutheran pastor once, teaching religion in Porvoo, and Olga one of his pupils. A scandal caused by their relationship had forced them to move to Tampere and the two married on 18 November 1906. At the age of five Mika Waltari suddenly lost his father to illness on 5 July 1914, and the 25-year old Olga Waltari was left, with crucial help from Toimi&#x27;s brother Toivo, to support her three children: Samuli (7 years), Mika (5 years) and Erkki (6 months). As a boy, Waltari witnessed the Finnish Civil War, during which his White-sided family fled to the home of his mother&#x27;s aunt at Laukkoski in Pornainen, near Porvoo, which was relatively peaceful and where the Whites were predominant.

Later he enrolled in the University of Helsinki as a theology student, according to his uncle Toivo&#x27;s wishes, but soon abandoned theology in favour of philosophy, aesthetics and literature, graduating in 1929. While studying, he contributed to various magazines and wrote poetry and stories, getting his first book &quot;Jumalaa paossa&quot; published in 1925. It was a success, selling 3000 copies despite being only 72 pages long. In 1927, he went to Paris where he wrote his first major novel &#x27; (&#x27;The Grand Illusion&#x27;), a story of bohemian life. In terms of style, the novel is considered to be the Finnish equivalent to the works of the American writers of the Lost Generation. (In Waltari&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The Adventurer&quot;, taking place in the 16th century, the protagonist is a Finn who goes to study in Paris at much the same age that the author went to the same city in the 20th century). &#x27; was a surprise hit, selling 8000 copies and turning Mika Waltari into a famous author. Waltari also was, for a while, a member of the liberal literary movement Tulenkantajat, though his political and social views later turned conservative. He was married on 8 March 1931 to Marjatta Luukkonen, whom he had met during military service the preceding year, and on 4 January 1932 they had a daughter, Satu. Satu also became a writer.

Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Waltari worked as a journalist and critic, writing for a number of newspapers and magazines and travelling widely in Europe. He published articles in the official magazine of the Association of Finnish Culture and Identity, &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Finnish Finland&#x27;), which was later renamed as &quot;Kanava&quot;. He directed the magazine &quot;Suomen Kuvalehti&quot;. At the same time, he kept writing books in many genres, moving easily from one literary field to another. He had a very busy schedule and strict work ethic. He also suffered from manic-depressive psychosis and became depressed after completion of a book, sometimes to the extent of needing hospital treatment; in his manic phases he did his writing. He participated, and often succeeded, in literary competitions to prove the quality of his work to critics. One of these competitions gave rise to one of his most popular characters, Inspector Palmu, a gruff detective of the Helsinki police department, who starred in three mystery novels, all of which were filmed (a fourth film was made without Waltari involved). Waltari also scripted the popular cartoon &quot;Kieku ja Kaiku&quot; and wrote &quot;Aiotko kirjailijaksi&quot;, a guidebook for aspiring writers that influenced many younger writers such as Kalle Päätalo.

===World War II and international break-through===
During the Winter War (1939–1940) and the Continuation War (1941–1944), Waltari worked in the government information center, now also placing his literary skills at the service of political propaganda. According to historian Eino Jutikkala, through this experience as a propagandist Waltari became more cynical as he realised the prevalence of historical half-truths shaped by propaganda, later a recurrent theme in his historical novels. Although Waltari saw Soviet bolshevism as dangerous, he was attracted at first to the National Socialist theories about a new man. He visited Germany in 1939 and wrote a mostly favourable article titled &quot;Tuntematon Saksa&quot; (&#x27;Unknown Germany&#x27;). In 1942 he and 6 other Finnish writers visited Germany to attend the Congress of the European Writers&#x27; Union in Weimar and wrote yet more favourable coverage; a story goes however that he, being slightly drunk, refused the pocket money brought by their &quot;patient and attentive German hosts&quot; to their hotel by tearing it in half and throwing it away through the window.

1945 saw the publication of Waltari&#x27;s first and most successful historical novel, &quot;The Egyptian&quot;. Its theme of the corruption of humanist values in a materialist world seemed curiously topical in the aftermath of World War II, and the book became an international bestseller, serving as the basis of the 1954 Hollywood movie of the same name. Waltari wrote seven more historical novels, placed in various ancient cultures, among others &quot;The Dark Angel&quot;, set during the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. In these novels, he gave powerful expression to his fundamental pessimism and also, in two novels set in the Roman Empire, to his Christian conviction. After the war, he also wrote several novellas. He became a member of the Finnish Academy in 1957 and received an honorary doctorate at the University of Turku in 1970.

=== Later years ===
Waltari&#x27;s last two novels tell about early history of Christianity: Valtakunnan salaisuus (English title: The Secret of the Kingdom 1959), and Ihmiskunnan viholliset (English title: The Roman 1964). As a member of Academy of Science and Letters he guided younger writers. He was also involved in re-publishing and editing his early works, and gave long interviews to which were published as a book.

Waltari was one of the most prolific Finnish writers. He wrote at least 29 novels, 15 novellas, 6 collections of stories or fairy-tales, 6 collections of poetry and 26 plays, as well as screen plays, radio plays, non-fiction, translations, and hundreds of reviews and articles. He is also internationally the best-known Finnish writer, and his works have been translated into more than 30 languages.

In his later years, Waltari wrote less and less. This is partly due to the enormous fees he received from foreign editions of &quot;The Egyptian&quot; and his other books, allowing him to stop &quot;writing to live&quot;.

Mika Waltari died on 26 August 1979 in Helsinki, the year after his wife Marjatta&#x27;s death in 1978.

==Literary themes and style==
 (who translated many of Waltari&#x27;s works into Czech and wrote a biography about him) identifies nine common elements in Waltari&#x27;s historical novels:
#Journeys: The protagonist goes on journeys in foreign lands, is a &quot;foreigner&quot; in the world instead of having a home, and often has a comic sidekick. They can be called picaresque novels. Waltari himself travelled a lot, wrote two travelogues and researched his material on his trips.
#Isolation: The protagonist often is an orphan, has unknown parents, or was born out of wedlock. His origins are mysterious but possibly from the highest ranks of society.
#Power: The main character becomes acquainted with mighty power-holders, becoming their adviser and often admirer, and gains status and property. This kind of story of rags-to-riches via hard work is common in Finnish literature - and even mirrors Waltari&#x27;s own life, as he at first relied on the help of his friends and relatives but later became a world-famous author.
#A Turning Point: All novels take place at the time of a major and significant turning point in world history. The manner in which these are explored is influenced by similar turning points in Waltari&#x27;s time.
#Conflicts and Violence: Many kinds of battles, wars and other acts of violence are depicted (often in gruesome detail), within and between societies. Attention is devoted to multiple conflicts in a novel instead of specific single ones, and no side is portrayed as more righteous as the other. Waltari viewed that the violence of medieval torture sprung from the religious suppression of sexuality.
#Rejection of Ideologies: All manipulative ideologies, which on the surface have noble goals but cause people to die in their name, are criticised. There are two common character types: The idealist, who has good intentions but brings about chaos and mayhem, and the realist, who is more immoral or even greedy and power-hungry but gets things done and achieves order and peace. According to Hejkalová, this tension between idealism and realism reflects post-World War II Finnish foreign policy: President Urho Kekkonen is the realist, who maintained the Paasikivi–Kekkonen line and preserved Finnish independence, whereas Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim she sees as possibly the prototypical idealist.
#Good and Wicked Women: The main character has relationships with two kinds of women: There is a good but imperfect woman, who tragically dies before the hero&#x27;s love for her can be fulfilled; and a beautiful but wicked femme fatale.
#Witchcraft: The supernatural, mysticism and witchcraft are featured - not rationally explained away but treated as part of everyday life, as understood by the characters. There is a profound, personal relationship with God (or equivalent divine power).
#Optimism: Counterintuitively in light of the above points, Waltari nonetheless holds the view that there is good among people, and that slowly, imperceptibly but inevitably humanity is headed towards goodness and salvation. Waltari paid special attention to the final parts of his novels and what mood or message they conveyed, providing a suitable uplifting catharsis.

==Legacy==
===Recognition===
Waltari received the State literature award five times: 1933, 1934, 1936, 1949, and 1953. The Pro Finlandia Medal was given to him in 1952.

The 100th anniversary of Mika Waltari&#x27;s birth was celebrated by selecting the writer as the main motif for a high value commemorative coin, the €10 Mika Waltari commemorative coin, minted in 2008. The reverse depicts a vigilant Pharaoh watchdog referencing his famous book. The obverse is decorated with Waltari&#x27;s signature and a stylized pen nib that symbolizes the diversity of the writer&#x27;s production.

Waltari&#x27;s memorial in Töölö by Veikko Hirvimäki was unveiled in 1985.

Two asteroids have been named in honour of Waltari: n:o 4266 Mika Waltari and n:o 4512 Sinuhe.

===Influence===
Waltari&#x27;s historical novels have been cited by G. R. R. Martin and Jean Auel as an influence.

<text>Mämmilä is a full-page comic strip by Finnish cartoonist Tarmo Koivisto and co-written by Hannu Virtanen.

Mämmilä is a fictional small country municipality, supposedly in the Häme region, and was originally modeled on the municipality of Orivesi. The cartoon depicted various contemporary issues in Finnish life, from various social changes to the coming of African refugees and membership in the European Union. The municipality has numerous colorful characters, from local political leaders and potentates to Varpu-Viljami (local dowser) and Mohammed al-Zomal (Somalian refugee), nicknamed &quot;Mukku&quot; after his pronunciation of the Finnish word &quot;muikkukukko&quot;.

Unusually for comic strips, the storyline happens in real time, and the characters in &quot;Mämmilä&quot; age normally, at the same pace as the comic strip in real life. For example, a girl called Sari was born in the comic in 1980, and is now an adult punk-style girl.

The strip was originally published 1974 in a Swedish-Finnish magazine, &quot;Suomen Sanoma&quot; (Finnish News) in Sweden. The magazine was published only a couple of times per year, so the strip moved to Finnish magazine called &quot;Me&quot; (We) in 1976. In 1983, &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; began its monthly magazine, and &quot;Mämmilä&quot; moved in there. &quot;HS&quot; dropped the strip after 13 years, because the readers wanted a strip about life in Helsinki. Tarmo Koivisto still draws &quot;Tää kaupunki&quot; (&quot;This city&quot;) strip, written by various &quot;HS&quot; journalists.

In 2002, Tarmo Koivisto published a comic album &quot;WWW.MAMMILA.FI&quot; in which the Internet and shady business practices come to Mämmilä. It was under work for five years.

In late 2006, &quot;Suomen Kuvalehti&quot;, a weekly magazine wanted to publish &quot;Mämmilä&quot;. Because Koivisto has had many pages done for the next album after 2002, the storyline is not in real time right now, but eventually it will be.

<doc id="164624" wikidata="Q453666" url="?curid=164624" title="Chief Joseph">
<text>Hin-mah-too-yah-lat-kekt (or hinmatóowyalahtq̓it in Americanist orthography; March 3, 1840 – September 21, 1904), popularly known as Chief Joseph, Young Joseph, or Joseph the Younger, was a leader of the wal-lam-wat-kain (Wallowa) band of Nez Perce, a Native American tribe of the interior Pacific Northwest region of the United States, in the latter half of the 19th century. He succeeded his father Tuekakas (Chief Joseph the Elder) in the early 1870s.

Chief Joseph led his band of Nez Perce during the most tumultuous period in their history, when they were forcibly removed by the United States federal government from their ancestral lands in the Wallowa Valley of northeastern Oregon onto a significantly reduced reservation in the Idaho Territory. A series of violent encounters with white settlers in the spring of 1877 culminated in those Nez Perce who resisted removal, including Joseph&#x27;s band and an allied band of the Palouse tribe, fleeing the United States in an attempt to reach political asylum alongside the Lakota people, who had sought refuge in Canada under the leadership of Sitting Bull.

At least 800 men, women, and children led by Joseph and other Nez Perce chiefs were pursued by the U.S. Army under General Oliver O. Howard in a fighting retreat known as the Nez Perce War. The skill with which the Nez Perce fought and the manner in which they conducted themselves in the face of incredible adversity earned them widespread admiration from their military opponents and the American public, and coverage of the war in U.S. newspapers led to popular recognition of Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce.

In October 1877, after months of fugitive resistance, most of the surviving remnants of Joseph&#x27;s band were cornered in northern Montana Territory, just from the Canadian border. Unable to fight any longer, Chief Joseph surrendered to the Army with the understanding that he and his people would be allowed to return to the reservation in western Idaho. He was instead transported between various forts and reservations on the southern Great Plains before being moved to the Colville Indian Reservation in the state of Washington, where he died in 1904.

Chief Joseph&#x27;s life remains an iconic event in the history of the American Indian Wars. For his passionate, principled resistance to his tribe&#x27;s forced removal, Joseph became renowned as both a humanitarian and a peacemaker.

==Background==
Chief Joseph was born &quot;Hinmuuttu-yalatlat&quot; (alternatively &quot;Hinmaton-Yalatkit&quot; or &quot;hin-mah-too-yah-lat-kekt&quot; Nez Perce: &quot;Thunder Rolling Down the Mountain&quot;], or &quot;hinmatóoyalahtq&#x27;it&quot; [&quot;Thunder traveling to higher areas&quot;]) in the Wallowa Valley of northeastern Oregon. He was known as Young Joseph during his youth because his father, Tuekakas, was baptized with the same Christian name and later become known as &quot;Old Joseph&quot; or &quot;Joseph the Elder&quot;.

While initially hospitable to the region&#x27;s white settlers, Joseph the Elder grew wary when they demanded more Indian lands. Tensions grew as the settlers appropriated traditional Indian lands for farming and livestock. Isaac Stevens, governor of the Washington Territory, organized a council to designate separate areas for natives and settlers in 1855. Joseph the Elder and the other Nez Perce chiefs signed the Treaty of Walla Walla, with the United States establishing a Nez Perce reservation encompassing in present-day Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. The 1855 reservation maintained much of the traditional Nez Perce lands, including Joseph&#x27;s Wallowa Valley. It is recorded that the elder Joseph requested that Young Joseph protect their 7.7-million-acre homeland, and guard his father&#x27;s burial place.

In 1863, however, an influx of new settlers, attracted by a gold rush, led the government to call a second council. Government commissioners asked the Nez Perce to accept a new, much smaller reservation of situated around the village of Lapwai in western Idaho Territory, and excluding the Wallowa Valley. In exchange, they were promised financial rewards, schools, and a hospital for the reservation. Chief Lawyer and one of his allied chiefs signed the treaty on behalf of the Nez Perce Nation, but Joseph the Elder and several other chiefs were opposed to selling their lands and did not sign.

Their refusal to sign caused a rift between the &quot;non-treaty&quot; and &quot;treaty&quot; bands of Nez Perce. The &quot;treaty&quot; Nez Perce moved within the new reservation&#x27;s boundaries, while the &quot;non-treaty&quot; Nez Perce remained on their ancestral lands. Joseph the Elder demarcated Wallowa land with a series of poles, proclaiming, &quot;Inside this boundary all our people were born. It circles the graves of our fathers, and we will never give up these graves to any man.&quot;

==Leadership of the Nez Perce==
Joseph the Younger succeeded his father as leader of the Wallowa band in 1871. Before his death, the latter counseled his son:

Joseph commented: &quot;I clasped my father&#x27;s hand and promised to do as he asked. A man who would not defend his father&#x27;s grave is worse than a wild beast.&quot;

The non-treaty Nez Perce suffered many injustices at the hands of settlers and prospectors, but out of fear of reprisal from the militarily superior Americans, Joseph never allowed any violence against them, instead making many concessions to them in the hope of securing peace. A handwritten document mentioned in the Oral History of the Grande Ronde recounts an 1872 experience by Oregon pioneer Henry Young and two friends in search of acreage at Prairie Creek, east of Wallowa Lake. Young&#x27;s party was surrounded by 40–50 Nez Perce led by Chief Joseph. The Chief told Young that white men were not welcome near Prairie Creek, and Young&#x27;s party was forced to leave without violence.
In 1873, Joseph negotiated with the federal government to ensure his people could stay on their land in the Wallowa Valley. But in 1877, the government reversed its policy, and Army General Oliver O. Howard threatened to attack if the Wallowa band did not relocate to the Idaho reservation with the other Nez Perce. Joseph reluctantly agreed. Before the outbreak of hostilities, General Howard held a council at Fort Lapwai to try to convince Joseph and his people to relocate. Joseph finished his address to the general, which focused on human equality, by expressing his &quot;[disbelief that] the Great Spirit Chief gave one kind of men the right to tell another kind of men what they must do.&quot; Howard reacted angrily, interpreting the statement as a challenge to his authority. When Toohoolhoolzote protested, he was jailed for five days.

The day following the council, Joseph, White Bird, and Looking Glass all accompanied Howard to examine different areas within the reservation. Howard offered them a plot of land that was inhabited by whites and Native Americans, promising to clear out the current residents. Joseph and his chieftains refused, adhering to their tribal tradition of not taking what did not belong to them. Unable to find any suitable uninhabited land on the reservation, Howard informed Joseph that his people had 30 days to collect their livestock and move to the reservation. Joseph pleaded for more time, but Howard told him he would consider their presence in the Wallowa Valley beyond the 30-day mark an act of war.

Returning home, Joseph called a council among his people. At the council, he spoke on behalf of peace, preferring to abandon his father&#x27;s grave over war. Toohoolhoolzote, insulted by his incarceration, advocated war. In June 1877, the Wallowa band began making preparations for the long journey to the reservation, meeting first with other bands at Rocky Canyon. At this council, too, many leaders urged war, while Joseph continued to argue in favor of peace. While the council was underway, a young man whose father had been killed rode up and announced that he and several other young men had retaliated by killing four white settlers. Still hoping to avoid further bloodshed, Joseph and other non-treaty Nez Perce leaders began moving people away from Idaho.

==Nez Perce War==
The U.S. Army&#x27;s pursuit of about 750 Nez Perce and a small allied band of the Palouse tribe, led by Chief Joseph and others, as they attempted to escape from Idaho became known as the Nez Perce War. Initially they had hoped to take refuge with the Crow Nation in the Montana Territory, but when the Crow refused to grant them aid, the Nez Perce went north in an attempt to obtain asylum with the Lakota band led by Sitting Bull, who had fled to Canada following the Great Sioux War in 1876. In &quot;Hear Me, My Chiefs!: Nez Perce Legend and History&quot;, Lucullus V. McWhorter argues that the Nez Perce were a peaceful people that were forced into war by the United States when their land was stolen from them. McWhorter interviewed and befriended Nez Perce warriors such as Yellow Wolf, who stated, &quot;Our hearts have always been in the valley of the Wallowa&quot;.

Robert Forczyk states in his book &quot;Nez Perce 1877: The Last Fight&quot; that the tipping point of the war was that &quot;Joseph responded that his clan&#x27;s traditions would not allow him to cede the Wallowa Valley&quot;. The band led by Chief Joseph never signed the treaty moving them to the Idaho reservation. General Howard, who was dispatched to deal with Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce, tended to believe the Nez Perce were right about the treaty: &quot;the new treaty finally agreed upon excluded the Wallowa, and vast regions besides&quot;.

For over three months, the Nez Perce deftly outmaneuvered and battled their pursuers, traveling more than across present-day Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana. One of those battles was led by Captain Perry and two cavalry companies of the U.S. Army led by Captain Trimble and Lieutenant Theller, who engaged Chief Joseph and his people at White Bird Canyon on June 17, 1877. The Nez Perce repelled the attack, killing 34 soldiers, while suffering only three Nez Perce wounded. The Nez Perce continued to repel the Army&#x27;s advances, eventually reaching the Clearwater River, where they united with another Nez Perce chief, Looking Glass, and his group, bringing the size of their party to 740, though only 200 of these were warriors. The final battle of the Nez Perce War occurred approximately south of the Canadian border where the Nez Perce were camped on Snake Creek near the Bears Paw Mountains, close to present-day Chinook in Blaine County, Montana. A U.S. Army detachment commanded by General Nelson A. Miles and accompanied by Cheyenne scouts intercepted the Nez Perce on September 30 at the Battle of Bear Paw. After his initial attacks were repelled, Miles violated a truce and captured Chief Joseph; however, he would later be forced to exchange Chief Joseph for one of his captured officers.

General Howard arrived on October 3, leading the opposing cavalry, and was impressed with the skill with which the Nez Perce fought, using advance and rear guards, skirmish lines, and field fortifications. Following a devastating five-day siege during freezing weather, with no food or blankets and the major war leaders dead, Chief Joseph formally surrendered to General Miles on the afternoon of October 5, 1877. The battle is remembered in popular history by the words attributed to Joseph at the formal surrender:

The popular legend deflated, however, when the original pencil draft of the report was revealed to show the handwriting of the later poet and lawyer Lieutenant Charles Erskine Scott Wood, who claimed to have taken down the great chief&#x27;s words on the spot. In the margin it read, &quot;Here insert Joseph&#x27;s reply to the demand for surrender&quot;.

Although Joseph was not technically a war chief and probably did not command the retreat, many of the chiefs who did had died. His speech brought attention, and therefore credit, his way. He earned the praise of General William Tecumseh Sherman and became known in the press as &quot;The Red Napoleon&quot;. However, as Francis Haines argues in &quot;Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce Warrior&quot;, the battlefield successes of the Nez Perce during the war were due to the individual successes of the Nez Perce men and not that of the fabled military genius of Chief Joseph. Haines supports his argument by citing L. V. McWhorter, who concluded &quot;that Chief Joseph was not a military man at all, that on the battlefield he was without either skill or experience&quot;. Furthermore, Merle Wells argues in &quot;The Nez Perce and Their War&quot; that the interpretation of the Nez Perce War of 1877 in military terms as used in the United States Army&#x27;s account distorts the actions of the Nez Perce. Wells supports his argument: &quot;The use of military concepts and terms is appropriate when explaining what the whites were doing, but these same military terms should be avoided when referring to Indian actions; the United States use of military terms such as &#x27;retreat&#x27; and &#x27;surrender&#x27; has created a distorted perception of the Nez Perce War, to understand this may lend clarity to the political and military victories of the Nez Perce.&quot;

==Aftermath==
By the time Joseph had surrendered, 150 of his followers had been killed or wounded. Their plight, however, did not end. Although Joseph had negotiated with Miles and Howard for a safe return home for his people, General Sherman overruled this decision and forced Joseph and 400 followers to be taken on unheated rail cars to Fort Leavenworth, in eastern Kansas, where they were held in a prisoner of war campsite for eight months. Toward the end of the following summer, the surviving Nez Perce were taken by rail to a reservation in the Indian Territory (now Oklahoma); they lived there for seven years. Many of them died of epidemic diseases while there.

In 1879, Chief Joseph went to Washington, D.C. to meet with President Rutherford B. Hayes and plead his people&#x27;s case. Although Joseph was respected as a spokesman, opposition in Idaho prevented the U.S. government from granting his petition to return to the Pacific Northwest. Finally, in 1885, Chief Joseph and his followers were granted permission to return to the Pacific Northwest to settle on the reservation around Kooskia, Idaho. Instead, Joseph and others were taken to the Colville Indian Reservation in Nespelem, Washington, far from both their homeland in the Wallowa Valley and the rest of their people in Idaho.

Joseph continued to lead his Wallowa band on the Colville Reservation, at times coming into conflict with the leaders of the 11 other unrelated tribes also living on the reservation. Chief Moses of the Sinkiuse-Columbia, in particular, resented having to cede a portion of his people&#x27;s lands to Joseph&#x27;s people, who had &quot;made war on the Great Father&quot;.

In his last years, Joseph spoke eloquently against the injustice of United States policy toward his people and held out the hope that America&#x27;s promise of freedom and equality might one day be fulfilled for Native Americans as well. In 1897, he visited Washington, D.C. again to plead his case. He rode with Buffalo Bill in a parade honoring former President Ulysses Grant in New York City, but he was a topic of conversation for his traditional headdress more than his mission.

In 1903, Chief Joseph visited Seattle, a booming young town, where he stayed in the Lincoln Hotel as guest to Edmond Meany, a history professor at the University of Washington. It was there that he also befriended Edward Curtis, the photographer, who took one of his most memorable and well-known photographs. Joseph also visited President Theodore Roosevelt in Washington, D.C. the same year. Everywhere he went, it was to make a plea for what remained of his people to be returned to their home in the Wallowa Valley, but it never happened.

==Death==

An indomitable voice of conscience for the West, still in exile from his homeland, Chief Joseph died on September 21, 1904, according to his doctor, &quot;of a broken heart&quot;. Meany and Curtis helped Joseph&#x27;s family bury their chief near the village of Nespelem, Washington, where many of his tribe&#x27;s members still live.

== Legacy ==
The Chief Joseph band of Nez Perce who still live on the Colville Reservation bear his name in tribute.

<doc id="164629" wikidata="Q326950" url="?curid=164629" title="Linji Yixuan">
<text>Linji Yixuan (; &quot;Rinzai Gigen&quot;; died 866 CE) was a Tang dynasty (618-907) Chinese monk and teacher of the Hongzhou school of Chinese Chan (Zen). Linji was the leading figure of Chan Buddhism in the Tang, and the &quot;Recorded Sayings of Linji&quot; (&quot;Línjì yǔlù&quot;), which contains his teachings, is seen as a major Zen text which exemplifies the iconoclastic and antinomian spirit of Zen. He is also known by the posthumous title Huizhao Chanshi (慧照禪師, “Meditation Master of Illuminating Wisdom”).

Linji was a student of Huangbo Xiyun and is also considered to be the founder of the influential Linji school of Chan. This school actually developed in the Song dynasty (960-1279) among descendants of Linji, who created various mythic stories about Linji in the process of founding their new school of Zen. Today he is seen as the founder of the various Linji regional traditions, including the Japanese Rinzai school, the contemporary Korean Seon schools (all which consider themselves to be of the &quot;Imjae&quot; line, i.e. Linji) and the Lâm Tế school of Vietnamese Zen. 

==Biography==

===Sources===
Information on Linji is based on the &quot;Línjì yǔlù&quot; and other sources like the &quot;Zutang ji,&quot; &quot;Jingde chuan-denglu&quot;, &quot;Song gaoseng zhuan&quot; (&quot;Song-dynasty Biographies of eminent monks&quot;), and the &quot;Tiansheng guang-denglu (Tiansheng-era Extensive record of the transmission)&quot;. However, the composition of these sources, like the &quot;Línjì yǔlù&quot;, occurred over various stages of historical development, culminating in the Song dynasty version of the &quot;Línjì yǔlù&quot; published by the Linji school. This text thus includes stories and passages attributed to Linji by later authors. As such, according to Albert Welter, &quot;the life of the historical person Linji is shrouded in legend.&quot; Yanagida Seizan also writes &quot;If we construct a chronology of the master’s life it must be a tentative one only, based for the most part upon traditional material rather than upon facts that can be substantiated with historical accuracy. 

===Life===
According to the sources, Linji was born during the Yuanhe era (806–820) into a family named Xing () living in Nanhua (南華), Cao (曹) Prefecture (modern Yanzhou 兖州 in Shandong Province). Little is known of his early life. According to the &quot;Guzunsu yulu&quot; (&quot;Recorded sayings of the ancient worthies&quot;), &quot;After shaving his head and receiving the full precepts, he frequented the lecture halls; he mastered the vinaya and made a thorough study of the sutras and śāstras.&quot; Yanagida Seizan writes that his teachings indicate that Linji was knowledgeable in the Mahayana sutras and also &quot;show the influence of works of the Huayan 華嚴 (Avataṃsaka) and Weishi 唯識 (“Consciousness-only”; Yogācāra) schools.&quot; Seizan also mentions that he seems to have been expert in the teachings of Yogācāra, since the &quot;Zutang ji&quot; depicts Linji&#x27;s first meeting with Dayu as being a discussion on the &quot;Treatise on the stages of Yogācāra practice&quot; (&quot;Yuqie lun&quot; 瑜伽論). 

After this period of study however, Linji turned to meditative practice, as sermon 18 of the &quot;Record of Linji&quot; states &quot;But later, when I realized that they were only remedies to help the world and displays of opinion, I threw them all away, and, searching for the Way, I practiced meditation.&quot; Linji then traveled to Jiangnan where he met Chán master Huángbò Xīyùn (), at some point between 836 and 841. He likely stayed with Huangbo at Mount Huangbo for about three years until he had a great enlightenment. According to sources like the &quot;Record of Linji&quot;, Linji questioned Huangbo three times about the central meaning of Buddhism and Huangbo struck him three times. Then Huangbo sent Linji to meet the reclusive monk Dàyú (). After exchanging some words with this monk, Linji attained an awakening or (見性, jianxing). He then returned to Huangbo and told him what had occurred. Huangbo slapped Linji, saying “You lunatic, coming back here and pulling the tiger’s whiskers!” Then Linji responded with a loud shout. After this event, Linji stayed with Huangbo for some time, or he may have traveled to practice with Dayu for a time as well. The various sources differ on this issue. 
In around 849 or 850 Linji, an older forty year old, left on a pilgrimage. Little is known of this pilgrimage, though the Chuandeng lu mentions that he visited Bodhidharma’s memorial tower in Henan. In about 851, Linji settled in Zhenzhou, Hebei where he led a small temple located southeast of the city of Zhenzhou. It was known as the Linji yuan (臨濟院, “Temple Overlooking the Ford”) since it was on the banks of the Hutuo River. It is the name of this temple which gave Linji his name. Linji&#x27;s temple may have been supported by the Wang family patriarch Wang Yuankui 王元逵 (d. 855) or one of his sons. 

Linji lived and taught in this temple for about ten years. Linji&#x27;s students included Zhaozhou Congshen, Puhua, Sansheng Huiran, Baoshou Yanzhao, Xinghua Cunjiang, Mayu, Longya Judun, Dajue, and Xingshan Jianhong. In about 863 or 864, Linji left Linji temple to accept an invitation by Lord Jiang Shen, regional commissioner of Hezhong, who had his seat at Puzhou (蒲州). From Puzhou, Linji traveled to Weifu on the invitation from Grand Marshal and President of the Grand Imperial Secretariat, Lord He. At Weifu, he stayed at Jiangxi chanyuan temple (江西禪院), of Guanyin si (觀音寺). He stayed at this temple for a year, receiving visitors, until his death. The Linji Lu describes his death as follows:

Suddenly one day the master, although not ill, adjusted his robes, sat erect, and when his exchange with Sansheng [Sansheng Huiran] was finished, quietly passed away. It was on the tenth day of the first month in the eighth year of Xiantong [18 February 867] of the Tang dynasty. 

=== Posthumous influence ===

After Linji&#x27;s death, his disciples then cremated him and built a memorial pagoda for the master&#x27;s remains in the capital of Daming Prefecture. The Chinese emperor decreed that Linji was to receive the posthumous title &quot;Huizhao Chanshi&quot; (慧照禪師, “Meditation Master of Illuminating Wisdom”).

According to Yanagida Seizan, &quot;Linji died probably in his early or mid-fifties, and thus did not reach the advanced age of many of the illustrious masters of his time. Nor did he leave a large body of notable disciples to disseminate his style of Chan.&quot; 

Of Linji&#x27;s small body of disciples, only Xinghua Cunjiang&#x27;s line of transmission survived. Very little is known of Cunjiang&#x27;s heir Nanyuan Huiyong. The three succeeding figures from Nanyuan: Fengxue Yanzhao, Shoushan Shengnian, and Fenyang Shanzhao, all remained in the Yellow river area. According to Albert Welter, &quot;While the inspiration for the Linji Chan faction was, of course Linji Yixuan, the real founder of the movement was, as noted previously, Shoushan Shengnian (926-993), a fourth-generation descendant.&quot;

Fenyang Shanzhao&#x27;s heir, Shishuang Chuyuan, transmitted the Linji lineage to Southern China. Shishuang was instrumental in promoting and expanding the influence of the Linji school. Over time, this tradition became one of the largest and most influential schools of Chan in East Asia, with branches in Japan (Rinzai), Korea and Vietnam. 

Linji&#x27;s students compiled and passed on his teachings in various sources, the most famous of which is the &quot;Recorded Sayings of Linji (Línjì yǔlù)&quot;.
== The &quot;Record of Linji&quot; and other sources ==

The &quot;Línjì yǔlù&quot; (臨濟語錄; Japanese: &quot;Rinzai-goroku&quot;, &quot;Recorded Sayings of Linji&quot;) or &quot;Línjìlù&quot; for short, is a collection of sayings and anecdotes attributed to Linji which is traditionally considered to be the main source of Linji&#x27;s teachings. The full title is &quot;Zhenzhou linji huizhao chanshi yulu&quot; (鎭州臨濟慧照禪師語錄, &quot;Recorded Sayings of Chan Master Huizhao of Linji in Zhenzhou&quot;). 

The standard edition of the &quot;Línjì yǔlù&quot; (c. 1120) was not completed until two hundred fifty years after Linji&#x27;s death (866).&quot; Thus parts of the text likely reflects the concerns of the Song dynasty Linji school rather than that of Linji in particular. The standard edition was first included within the massive &quot;Tiansheng guangdeng lu&quot; by the lay believer Li Zunxu (a student of Guyin Yuncong) in 1036 and it was independently printed in 1120 by Yuanjue Zongyan at Mount Gu in Fuzhou (present-day Fujian). 

Yanagida Seizan writes that &quot;we have no way of determining exactly what the earliest version of the &quot;Linji lu&quot; was like or when it was compiled.&quot; In spite of this, Yanagida Seizan still held that the main twenty two sermons in the &quot;Línjì yǔlù&quot; &quot;provide us with an account of the man and his teaching&quot;. 

Furthermore, earlier passages from Linji&#x27;s sermons can be found in texts compiled before the 11th century, such as the &quot;Zutang ji&quot;, the &quot;Zongjing lu,&quot; the &quot;Jingde Chuan-deng lu&quot; and the &quot;Tiansheng guang-denglu (Tiansheng-era Extensive record of the transmission)&quot;. These passages contain minor differences with the parallel passages from Linji&#x27;s sermons found in the &quot;Línjì yǔlù&quot; according to Yanagida. 

Albert Welter also notes that the earliest fragments of Linji&#x27;s teachings are found in the &quot;Zutang ji&quot;, which was compiled in 952. However, regarding the contents of the &quot;Linji-lu&quot;, he writes: 
Ultimately, the story of the Linji lu is the story of a movement that found its voice and identity through the image and alleged teachings of Linji. What these teachings represent are not the words of one man, which are in any case irretrievable, but the combined aspirations of the movement as a whole, projected onto the persona of Linji as founder. Linji wrote nothing himself. Our knowledge of his teachings allegedly depends on notes taken by students of his sermons, lectures, dialogues, and other interactions. The names of those who originally kept such notebooks are unknown to us. Eventually, fragments of Linji&#x27;s teachings were included in Chan transmission records.

The &quot;Línjì yǔlù&quot; contains stories of Linji&#x27;s interactions with teachers, contemporaries, and students. The recorded lectures are a mixture of the conventional and the iconoclastic; those who resented the iconoclastic nature of Linji discourse saw him as “one of the most infamous Chinese Chan masters who censored traditional Buddhist practices and doctrines.” Despite the iconoclasm, however, the &quot;Línjì yǔlù&quot; reflects a thorough knowledge of the &quot;sūtra&quot;s. Linji&#x27;s style of teaching, as recorded in that text, exemplifies Chán development in the Hongzhou school () of Mazu and his successors, such as Huangbo, Linji&#x27;s master.

==Teachings==
=== Iconoclasm ===
The &quot;Linju lu&quot; presents Linji as an iconoclastic teacher who used shocking language in vernacular Chinese to disrupt the tendency of his listeners to grasp at concepts such as buddhas, patriarchs, bodhisattvas, stages of practice and levels of attainment. He famously said, &quot;If you meet a buddha, kill the buddha.&quot; While Linji&#x27;s language may sound extreme, it reflects an attitude which considers grasping at buddhas, bodhi, nirvana, Dharma, and other such related Buddhist concepts, as a kind of delusion. As Burton Watson observes:

Such sentiments can already be seen in earlier Chan sources. For example, Shenhui points out that while lust for wealth and sex is &quot;gross falsity,&quot; activating one&#x27;s intention to grasp bodhi, nirvana, emptiness, purity, and concentration is &quot;subtle falsity.&quot; Likewise, Huangbo said that to conceive of a buddha is to be obstructed by that buddha, while the &quot;Bloodstream Sermon&quot; criticized the worshipping of buddhas as holding onto appearances.

===Non-dependency ===
According to Linji, Zen students fail to make spiritual progress because they lack faith in themselves and are thereby &quot;twisted and turned&quot; by whatever environment they encounter. They cling to phrases and are obstructed by words like &quot;common mortal&quot; and &quot;sage,&quot; and for Linji, this is to still be dependent on something. Rather than rely on buddhas, bodhisattvas, and the Chan patriarchs, Linji taught his listeners that they should be non-dependent persons of the Way: 
===True person===
Although we may be &quot;twisted and turned&quot; by dependencies and externals, Linji taught that the true person, the one who &quot;has the ability to speak dharma and listen to it,&quot; is a &quot;solitary brightness&quot; (or the one &quot;shining alone&quot;, Ch: &quot;gū míng&quot;, 孤明) who is not swayed by various situations or environments:
Similarly, Linji described the mind as a &quot;single bright essence&quot; (or &quot;one pure radiance&quot;, Ch: 一精明) which is formless and penetrates all directions. According to Linji, because this mind is formless, it is everywhere emancipated, and thus there was no need to go &quot;rushing around everywhere looking for something.&quot; Instead, Linji advised his listeners to stop and take a good look at themselves.

Another way in which Linji referred to the true person was &quot;the true man with no rank&quot; (&quot;wúwèi zhēnrén&quot;, 無位真人). According to Welter, all early sources agree that the notion of &quot;the true man with no-rank&quot; (which can also mean &quot;a sage without any location&quot;) was a major teaching of Linji. In what is perhaps the earliest source of this teaching, the &quot;Zutang ji&quot;, it is presented as follows: 
Other sources contain similar statements. In the &quot;Chuandenglu&quot;, for example, Linji says, &quot;within your lump of red flesh there is a true man with no rank, constantly entering and exiting the openings of your face.&quot; When a monk asks who the true man is, Linji responds by saying, &quot;The true man with no rank—what a dried lump of shit!&quot;

===Faith===
Linji criticized relying on methods and practices in order to realize this true person. He said that to engage in religious practice was to generate karma keeping one bound to the realm of birth and death, while &quot;the real person,&quot; &quot;this person who is right now listening to the Dharma,&quot; was without any adornments or practices. Instead of reliance on practices to see our innate nature, Linji taught that we should simply have faith (&quot;xìn&quot;, 信) in it: &quot;Just have faith in this thing that is operating in you right now. Outside of it, nothing else exists.&quot;

According to Buswell, faith for Linji was not blind acceptance, but an inherent faculty emanating constantly from the enlightened nature, and was thus equivalent to the &quot;innate functioning&quot; of the mind-essence. Buswell also notes the striking difference between Linji&#x27;s teachings, in which faith plays a prominent role, and the teachings of the later Linji School master, Dahui, who valued doubt over faith.

=== Nothing to do ===
In addition to faith, Linji also emphasized non-seeking and &quot;wú shì&quot; (無事), a term often translated as &quot;nothing-to-do,&quot; but which also has the meaning of no affairs, no concerns, no matters, and no business. He says:

Accordingly, Linji taught that there was no need to make any special effort. Instead, we have simply to be ordinary: &quot;Followers of the Way, as to buddhadharma, no effort is necessary. You have only to be ordinary, with nothing to do—defecating, urinating, wearing clothes, eating food, and lying down when tired.&quot; As Jinhua Jia points out, this recognition of the fundamental value of the human being echoes the teachings of Mazu Daoyi, for whom everyday ordinary activities were the function of buddha-nature.

Linji further connects non-doing with &quot;turning one&#x27;s light around&quot; (Ch. &quot;fǎn zhào&quot; 返照), a term that occurs throughout various Chan texts, such as Zongmi&#x27;s &quot;Sub-commentary to the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment&quot; (where it refers to recognizing one&#x27;s original enlightenment). According to Linji, when we stop our seeking and turn our own light in upon ourselves, we will on that very instant have nothing to do.

However, &quot;turning one&#x27;s light around&quot; does not necessarily imply anything like staring at the mind or concentrating within. Linji quotes Shenhui&#x27;s well-known criticism of such things as arresting the mind, staring at silence, summoning the mind to focus it on externals, controlling the mind to make it clear within, and concentrating the mind to enter into meditation. Moreover, Linji says that looking for something within is just as wrong as seeking externally, since there&#x27;s nothing within that can be grasped: &quot;Outside the mind there is no Dharma, and even inside the mind it can&#x27;t be grasped. So what is there to seek for?&quot;

<text>Transcendental is the debut album from UK progressive metal band To-Mera, released 11 September 2006. Their style is characterised by female vocals, long, multi-sectioned songs, heavy riffs and jazzy sections. The album has been likened to the works of bands such as Symphony X, SikTh, The Dillinger Escape Plan and Opeth.

==Work on the album==
The album was recorded and mixed between May and July 2006 in Hungary (drums, vocals, guitars), England (keyboards, bass) and France (Audio mixing and mastering). The cover was created by Eliran Kantor. The band liked the website he made for them so much that they took the album artwork directly from it.

The band chose Transcendental as the album title to reflect the emotional effects of their music. The idea that the title was chosen to hint at the &quot;Transcendental Études&quot; written by Hungarian composer Franz Liszt - which were considered some of the most technical musical pieces of their time - has been denied by the band.

<text>A wavenumber–frequency diagram is a plot displaying the relationship between the wavenumber (spatial frequency) and the frequency (temporal frequency) of certain phenomena. Usually frequencies are placed on the vertical axis, while wavenumbers are placed on the horizontal axis.

In the atmospheric sciences, these plots are a common way to visualize atmospheric waves.

In the geosciences, especially seismic data analysis, these plots also called &quot;f&quot;–&quot;k&quot; plot, in which energy density within a given time interval is contoured on a frequency-versus-wavenumber basis. They are used to examine the direction and apparent velocity of seismic waves and in velocity filter design.

==Origins==

In general, the relationship between wavelength formula_1, frequency formula_2, and the phase velocity formula_3 of a sinusoidal wave is:

:formula_4

Using the wavenumber (formula_5) and angular frequency (formula_6) notation, the previous equation can be rewritten as

:formula_7

On the other hand, the group velocity is equal to the slope of the wavenumber–frequency diagram:

:formula_8

Analyzing such relationships in detail often yields information on the physical properties of the medium, such as density, , etc.

<doc id="164632" wikidata="Q167894" url="?curid=164632" title="Zazen">
<text>Zazen is a meditative discipline that is typically the primary practice of the Zen Buddhist tradition. 

The generalized Japanese term for meditation is 瞑想 (&quot;meisō&quot;); however, &quot;zazen&quot; has been used informally to include all forms of seated Buddhist meditation. The term &quot;zuòchán&quot; can be found in early Chinese Buddhist sources, such as the Dhyāna sutras. For example, the famous translator Kumārajīva (344–413) translated a work termed &quot;Zuòchán sān mēi jīng&quot; (&quot;A&quot; &quot;Manual on the Samādhi of Sitting Meditation&quot;) and the Chinese Tiantai master Zhiyi (538–597 CE) wrote some very influential works on sitting meditation.

The meaning and method of zazen varies from school to school, but in general it is a quiet type of Buddhist meditation done in a sitting posture like the lotus position. The practice can be done with various methods, such as following the breath (anapanasati), mentally repeating a phrase (which could be a koan, a mantra, a huatou or nianfo) and a kind of open monitoring in which one is aware of whatever comes to our attention (sometimes called shikantaza or silent illumination). Repeating a huatou, a short meditation phrase, is a common method in Chinese Chan and Korean Seon. Meanwhile, nianfo, the practice of silently reciting the Buddha Amitabha&#x27;s name, is common in the traditions influenced by Pure Land practice, and was also taught by Chan masters like Zongmi.

In the Japanese Buddhist Rinzai school, zazen is usually combined with the study of koans. The Japanese Sōtō school makes less or no use of koans, preferring an approach known as shikantaza where the mind has no object at all.

==Practice==

===Five types of Zazen===
Kapleau quotes Hakuun Yasutani&#x27;s lectures for beginners. In lecture four, Yasutani lists five kinds of zazen:
* &quot;bompu&quot;, developing meditative concentration to aid well-being;
* &quot;gedo&quot;, zazen-like practices from other religious traditions;
* &quot;shojo&quot;, &#x27;small vehicle&#x27; practices;
* &quot;daijo&quot;, zazen aimed at gaining insight into true nature;
* &quot;saijojo&quot;, shikantaza.

=== Sitting ===
In Zen temples and monasteries, practitioners traditionally sit zazen together in a meditation hall usually referred to as a &quot;zendo&quot;, each sitting on a cushion called a &quot;zafu&quot; which itself may be placed on a low, flat mat called a &quot;zabuton&quot;. Practitioners of the Rinzai school sit facing each other with their backs to the wall, while those of the Sōtō school sit facing the wall or a curtain. Before taking one&#x27;s seat, and after rising at the end of a period of zazen, a Zen practitioner performs a &quot;gassho&quot; bow to their seat, and a second bow to fellow practitioners. The beginning of a period of zazen is traditionally announced by ringing a bell three times (&quot;shijosho&quot;), and the end of the period by ringing the bell either once or twice (&quot;hozensho&quot;). Long periods of zazen may alternate with periods of kinhin (walking meditation).

=== Posture ===
The posture of zazen is seated, with crossed legs and folded hands, and an erect but settled spine. The hands are folded together into a simple mudra over the belly. In many practices, the practitioner breathes from the &quot;hara&quot; (the center of gravity in the belly) and the eyelids are half-lowered, the eyes being neither fully open nor shut so that the practitioner is neither distracted by, nor turning away from, external stimuli.

The legs are folded in one of the standard sitting styles:
* &quot;Kekkafuza&quot; (full-lotus)
* &quot;Hankafuza&quot; (half-lotus)
* &quot;Burmese&quot; (a seated posture in which the ankles are placed in front of the sitter)
* &quot;Seiza&quot; (a kneeling posture using a bench or zafu)

It is not uncommon for modern practitioners to practice zazen in a chair, sometimes with a wedge or cushion on top of it so that one is sitting on an incline, or by placing a wedge behind the lower back to help maintain the natural curve of the spine.

====Samadhi====
The initial stages of training in zazen may resemble traditional Buddhist samatha meditation. According to some appraoches, the student begins by focusing on the breath at the &quot;hara/tanden&quot; with mindfulness of breath (&quot;ānāpānasmṛti&quot;) exercises such as counting breath (&quot;sūsokukan&quot; 数息観) or just watching it (&quot;zuisokukan&quot; 随息観). Mantras are also sometimes used in place of counting. Practice may be continued in one of these ways until there is adequate &quot;one-pointedness&quot; of mind to constitute an initial experience of &quot;samadhi&quot;. At this point, the practitioner might move on to koan-practice or shikantaza.

While some teachers such as Dainin Katagiri Roshi taught watching the breath, and Shunryū Suzuki taught counting the breath, others such as Kōshō Uchiyama and Shohaku Okumura taught neither counting nor watching the breath. According to Okumura, one does not put one&#x27;s focus on the breath (nor any object at all): &quot;We don’t set our mind on any particular object, visualization, mantra, or even our breath itself. When we just sit, our mind is nowhere and everywhere.&quot;

While Yasutani Roshi states that the development of (Sanskrit &quot;&quot;), the power of concentration, is one of the three aims of zazen, Dogen warns that the aim of zazen is not the development of mindless concentration.

====Koan introspection====
In the Rinzai school, after having developed awareness, the practitioner can now focus their consciousness on a koan as an object of meditation. While koan practice is generally associated with the Rinzai school and Shikantaza with the Sōtō school, many Zen communities use both methods depending on the teacher and students.

====Shikantaza====
Zazen is considered the heart of Japanese Sōtō Zen Buddhist practice. The aim of zazen is just sitting, that is, suspending all judgemental thinking and letting words, ideas, images and thoughts pass by without getting involved in them. Practitioners do not use any specific object of meditation, instead remaining as much as possible in the present moment, aware of and observing what is occurring around them and what is passing through their minds. In his &quot;Shobogenzo&quot;, Dogen says, &quot;Sitting fixedly, think of not thinking. How do you think of not thinking? Nonthinking. This is the art of zazen.&quot;

<text>Atmospheric science is the study of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and its various inner-working physical processes. Meteorology includes atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric physics with a major focus on weather forecasting. Climatology is the study of atmospheric changes (both long and short-term) that define average climates and their change over time climate variability. Aeronomy is the study of the upper layers of the atmosphere, where dissociation and ionization are important. Atmospheric science has been extended to the field of planetary science and the study of the atmospheres of the planets and natural satellites of the Solar System.

Experimental instruments used in atmospheric science include satellites, rocketsondes, radiosondes, weather balloons, radars, and lasers.

The term aerology (from Greek ἀήρ, &quot;aēr&quot;, &quot;air&quot;; and -λογία, &quot;-logia&quot;) is sometimes used as an alternative term for the study of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere; in other definitions, aerology is restricted to the free atmosphere, the region above the planetary boundary layer.

Early pioneers in the field include Léon Teisserenc de Bort and Richard Assmann.

== Atmospheric chemistry ==
Atmospheric chemistry is a branch of atmospheric science in which the chemistry of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and that of other planets is studied. It is a multidisciplinary field of research and draws on environmental chemistry, physics, meteorology, computer modeling, oceanography, geology and volcanology and other disciplines. Research is increasingly connected with other areas of study such as climatology.

The composition and chemistry of the atmosphere is of importance for several reasons, but primarily because of the interactions between the atmosphere and living organisms. The composition of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere has been changed by human activity and some of these changes are harmful to human health, crops and ecosystems. Examples of problems which have been addressed by atmospheric chemistry include acid rain, photochemical smog and global warming. Atmospheric chemistry seeks to understand the causes of these problems, and by obtaining a theoretical understanding of them, allow possible solutions to be tested and the effects of changes in government policy evaluated.

== Atmospheric dynamics ==

Atmospheric dynamics is the study of motion systems of meteorological importance, integrating observations at multiple locations and times and theories. Common topics studied include diverse phenomena such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, gravity waves, tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones, jet streams, and global-scale circulations. The goal of dynamical studies is to explain the observed circulations on the basis of fundamental principles from physics. The objectives of such studies incorporate improving weather forecasting, developing methods for predicting seasonal and interannual climate fluctuations, and understanding the implications of human-induced perturbations (e.g., increased carbon dioxide concentrations or depletion of the ozone layer) on the global climate.

== Atmospheric physics ==

Atmospheric physics is the application of physics to the study of the atmosphere. Atmospheric physicists attempt to model Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and the atmospheres of the other planets using fluid flow equations, chemical models, radiation balancing, and energy transfer processes in the atmosphere and underlying oceans and land. In order to model weather systems, atmospheric physicists employ elements of scattering theory, wave propagation models, cloud physics, statistical mechanics and spatial statistics, each of which incorporate high levels of mathematics and physics. Atmospheric physics has close links to meteorology and climatology and also covers the design and construction of instruments for studying the atmosphere and the interpretation of the data they provide, including remote sensing instruments.

In the United Kingdom, atmospheric studies are underpinned by the Meteorological Office. Divisions of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) oversee research projects and weather modeling involving atmospheric physics. The U.S. National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center also carries out studies of the high atmosphere.

The Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and the solar wind interact with the atmosphere, creating the ionosphere, Van Allen radiation belts, telluric currents, and radiant energy.

== Climatology ==

Is a science that bases its more general knowledge of the more specialized disciplines of meteorology, oceanography, geology, and astronomy, which in turn are based on the basic sciences of physics, chemistry, and mathematics. In contrast to meteorology, which studies short term weather systems lasting up to a few weeks, climatology studies the frequency and trends of those systems. It studies the periodicity of weather events over years to millennia, as well as changes in long-term average weather patterns, in relation to atmospheric conditions. Climatologists, those who practice climatology, study both the nature of climates – local, regional or global – and the natural or human-induced factors that cause climates to change. Climatology considers the past and tries to predict future climate change.

Phenomena of climatological interest include the atmospheric boundary layer, circulation patterns, heat transfer (radiative, convective and latent), interactions between the atmosphere and the oceans and land surface (particularly vegetation, land use and topography), and the chemical and physical composition of the atmosphere. Related disciplines include astrophysics, atmospheric physics, chemistry, ecology, physical geography, geology, geophysics, glaciology, hydrology, oceanography, and volcanology.

== Aeronomy ==
Aeronomy is the scientific study of the upper atmosphere of the Earth — the atmospheric layers above the stratopause — and corresponding regions of the atmospheres of other planets, where the entire atmosphere may correspond to the Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere or a portion of it. A branch of both atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric physics, aeronomy contrasts with meteorology, which focuses on the layers of the atmosphere below the stratopause. In atmospheric regions studied by aeronomers, chemical dissociation and ionization are important phenomena.

== Atmospheres on other celestial bodies ==
All of the Solar System&#x27;s planets have atmospheres. This is because their gravity is strong enough to keep gaseous particles close to the surface. Larger gas giants are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases hydrogen and helium close by, while the smaller planets lose these gases into space. The composition of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is different from the other planets because the various life processes that have transpired on the planet have introduced free molecular oxygen. Much of Mercury&#x27;s atmosphere has been blasted away by the solar wind. The only moon that has retained a dense atmosphere is Titan. There is a thin atmosphere on Triton, and a trace of an atmosphere on the Moon.

Planetary atmospheres are affected by the varying degrees of energy received from either the Sun or their interiors, leading to the formation of dynamic weather systems such as hurricanes (on Earth), planet-wide dust storms (on Mars), an Earth-sized anticyclone on Jupiter (called the Great Red Spot), and holes in the atmosphere (on Neptune). At least one extrasolar planet, HD 189733 b, has been claimed to possess such a weather system, similar to the Great Red Spot but twice as large.

Hot Jupiters have been shown to be losing their atmospheres into space due to stellar radiation, much like the tails of comets. These planets may have vast differences in temperature between their day and night sides which produce supersonic winds, although the day and night sides of HD 189733b appear to have very similar temperatures, indicating that planet&#x27;s atmosphere effectively redistributes the star&#x27;s energy around the planet.

<text>Pune ( ; , ISO: ), previously spelled in English as Poona (the official name until 1978), is a city in the state of Maharashtra in the Deccan plateau in Western India. It is the administrative headquarters of the Pune district, and of Pune division. According to the 2011 Census of India, Pune has 7.2 million residents in the metropolitan region, making it the seventh-most populous metropolitan area in India. The city of Pune is part of Pune Metropolitan Region. Pune is one of the largest IT hubs in India. It is also one of the most important automobile and manufacturing hubs of India. Pune is often referred to as the &quot;Oxford of the East&quot; because of its educational institutions. It has been ranked &quot;the most liveable city in India&quot; several times.

Pune at different points in time has been ruled by the Rashtrakuta dynasty, Ahmadnagar Sultanate, the Mughals, and the Adil Shahi dynasty. In the 18th century, the city was part of the Maratha Empire, and the seat of the Peshwas, the prime ministers of the Maratha Empire. Pune was seized by the British East India Company in the Third Anglo-Maratha War; it gained municipal status in 1858, the year in which Crown rule began. Many historical landmarks like Shaniwarwada, Shinde Chhatri, and Vishrambaug Wada date to this era. Historical sites from different eras dot the city.

Pune has historically been a major cultural centre, with important figures like Dnyaneshwar, Shivaji, Tukaram, Baji Rao I, Balaji Baji Rao, Madhavrao I, Nana Fadnavis, Mahadev Govind Ranade, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Mahatma Jyotirao Phule, Savitribai Phule, Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, Tarabai Shinde, Dhondo Keshav Karve, and Pandita Ramabai doing their life&#x27;s work in Pune City or in an area that falls in Pune Metropolitan Region. Pune was a major centre of resistance to British Raj, with people like Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Bal Gangadhar Tilak playing leading roles in struggle for Indian independence in their times.

==Etymology==

The earliest reference to Pune is an inscription on a Rashtrakuta Dynasty copper plate dated 937 CE, which refers to the town as Punya-Vishaya, meaning &#x27;sacred news&#x27;. By the 13th century, it had come to be known as Punawadi.

During the Rashtrakuta dynasty, the city was referred to as Punnaka and Punyapur. The copper plates of 758 and 768 CE show that the Yadava dynasty had renamed the city Punakavishaya and Punya Vishaya. &#x27;Vishaya&#x27; means land, and &#x27;Punaka&#x27; and &#x27;Punya&#x27; mean holy. The city was known as Kasbe Pune when under the command of Maratha king Shivaji&#x27;s father, Shahaji. Mughal emperor Aurangzeb renamed a small neighbourhood in central part of the old city as Muhiyabad (the only divergent naming) some time between 1703 and 1705 in memory of his great-grandson Muhi-ul-Milan, who died there. The name Muhiyabad was reverted soon after Aurangzeb&#x27;s death. Anglicized to Poona in 1857 by the English during British rule, the city&#x27;s name was changed to Pune in 1978.

==History==

=== Early and Medieval Period ===

Copper plates dated 858 and 868CE show that by the 9th century an agricultural settlement known as Punnaka existed at the location of the modern Pune. The plates indicate that this region was ruled by the Rashtrakuta dynasty. The Pataleshwar rock-cut temple complex was built during this era. Pune was part of the territory ruled by the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri from the 9th century to 1327. Pune was under control of various Muslim sultanates until the late 1600s.

=== The Maratha Empire ===

Pune was part of the Jagir (fiefdom) granted by the Nizamshahi (Ahmadnagar Sultanate) to Maloji Bhosale in 1599. Maloji Bhosale passed on Jagir of Pune to his son Shahaji Bhosale.
The town was destroyed by Murar Jagdeo, a general from the rival Adil Shahi dynasty in 1636.Soon Shahaji himself joined Adilshahi and got his Pune jagir back.At that time he selected the town for the residence of his wife Jijabai, and young son Shivaji, the future founder of the Maratha empire. Shahaji appointed Dadoji Konddeo to help Jijabai in the administration of Jagir and in the reconstruction of the town.The Lal Mahal residence of Jiajabai and Shivaji was completed in 1640 AD. Shivaji spent his young years at the Lal Mahal. Jijabai is said to have commissioned the building of the Kasba Ganapati temple. The Ganesha idol consecrated at this temple has been regarded as the presiding deity (&quot;Gramadevata&quot;) of the city. Pune changed hands between the Mughals and the Marathas many times during the rest of the 1600s.Recognizing the military potential of Pune, the Mughal general Shaista Khan and later, the emperor Aurangzeb further developed the areas around the town. Pune was occupied again by Marathas in June 1670, four months to the battle of Sinhagad and remained in the hands of Marathas. From 1703 to 1705, towards the end of the 27-year-long Mughal–Maratha Wars, the town was occupied by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb and its name was changed temporarily to Muhiyabad. This name was abandoned and reverted to its original name soon after Aurangzeb&#x27;s death.

=== Peshwa Rule ===
In 1720, Baji Rao I was appointed Peshwa (prime minister) of the Maratha Empire by Shahu I, the fifth Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire. As the Peshwa, Bajirao moved his base from Saswad to Pune in 1728, marking the beginning of the transformation of what was a &quot;kasbah&quot; into a city. He also commissioned the construction of the Shaniwar Wada on the high grounds of right bank of the Mutha River. The construction was completed in 1730, ushering in the era of Peshwa control of the city. Bajirao&#x27;s son and successor, Nanasaheb constructed a lake at Katraj on the outskirts of the city and an underground aqueduct to bring water from the lake to Shaniwar Wada and the city. The aqueduct was still in working order in 2004.
The patronage of the Maratha Peshwas resulted in a great expansion of Pune, with the construction of around 250 temples and bridges in the city, including the Lakdi Pul and the temples on Parvati Hill and many Maruti, Vithoba, Vishnu, Mahadeo, Rama, Krishna, and Ganesh temples. The building of temples led to religion being responsible for about 15% of the city&#x27;s economy during this period. Pune prospered as a city during the reign of Nanasaheb Peshwa. He developed Saras Baug, Heera Baug, Parvati Hill and new commercial, trading, and residential localities. Sadashiv Peth, Narayan Peth, Rasta Peth and Nana Peth were developed. The Peshwa&#x27;s influence in India declined after the defeat of Maratha forces at the Battle of Panipat but Pune remained the seat of power. In 1802 Pune was captured by Yashwantrao Holkar in the Battle of Poona, directly precipitating the Second Anglo-Maratha War of 1803–1805. The Peshwa rule ended with the defeat of Peshwa Bajirao II by the British East India Company in 1818.

Historian Govind Sakharam Sardesai lists 163 prominent families that held high ranks and played significant roles in politics, military, and finance in 18th century Pune. Of these 163 families, a majority(80) were Deshastha Brahmins, 46 were Chitpawan, 15 were Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu(CKP) whereas Karhade Brahmin and Saraswat accounted for 11 families each.

=== British Rule (1818–1947) ===

The Third Anglo-Maratha War broke out between the Marathas and the British East India Company in 1817. The Peshwas were defeated at the Battle of Khadki (then spelled Kirkee) on 5November near Pune and the city was seized by the British. It was placed under the administration of the Bombay Presidency and the British built a large military cantonment to the east of the city (now used by the Indian Army).The old city and the cantonment areas followed different patterns of development, with the latter being developed more on European lines to cater for the needs of the British military class. The old city had narrow lanes and areas segregated by caste and religion. The settlement of the regiments of the 17 Poona Horse cavalry, the Lancashire Fusiliers, the Maratha Light Infantry, and others, led to an increase in the population. Due to its milder weather, the city became the &quot;Monsoon capital&quot; of the Governor of Bombay, thus making it one of the most important cities of the Bombay Presidency. 
The Southern Command of the Indian Army, established in 1895, is headquartered in Pune cantonment.

The city of Pune was known as Poona during British rule. Poona Municipality was established in 1858. A railway line from Bombay to the city opened in 1858, run by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR). Navi Peth, Ganj Peth (now renamed Mahatma Phule Peth) were developed during the British Raj.

====Centre of Social Reform and Nationalism====

Pune was prominently associated with the struggle for Indian independence. In the period between 1875 and 1910, the city was a centre of agitation led by Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Bal Gangadhar Tilak. The city was also a centre for social reform led by Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, Mahatma Jyotirao Phule, feminist Tarabai Shinde, Dhondo Keshav Karve and Pandita Ramabai. They demanded the abolition of caste prejudice, equal rights for women, harmony between the Hindu and Muslim communities, and better schools for the poor. Mahatma Gandhi was imprisoned at the Yerwada Central Jail several times and placed under house arrest at the Aga Khan Palace between 1942 and 1944, where both his wife Kasturba Gandhi and aide Mahadev Desai died. Savarkar used to study in Fergusson College and performed the &quot;Holi&quot; of foreign items near Mutha river bank .

=== Pune since Indian Independence === 
After Indian independence from the British in 1947, Pune saw enormous growth, transforming it into a modern metropolis. The Poona Municipal Council was reorganised to form the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) in 1950. The education sector in the city continued its growth in the post-independence era with the establishment of the University of Pune (now, Savitribai Phule Pune University) in 1949, the National Chemical Laboratory in 1950 and the National Defence Academy in 1955.

The establishment of Hindustan Antibiotics in 1954 marked the beginning of industrial development in the Hadapsar, Bhosari, and Pimpri areas. MIDC provided the necessary infrastructure for new businesses to set up operations. In the 1970s, several engineering companies were set up in the city, allowing it to vie with Chennai. In the 1990s, Pune began to attract foreign capital, particularly in the information technology and engineering industries. IT parks were established in Aundh, Viman Nagar, Hinjawadi, Wagholi, Kharadi and Balewadi-Baner region. As a result, the city saw a huge influx of people due to opportunities offered by the manufacturing, and lately, the software industries.

The breach in the Panshet dam and the resulting flood of 1961 led to severe damage and the destruction of housing close to the river banks. The mishap spurred the development of new suburbs and housing complexes. To integrate urban planning, the Pune Metropolitan Region was defined in 1967 covering the area under PMC, the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, the three cantonments, and the surrounding villages.

In 1998 work on the six-lane Mumbai-Pune expressway began; it was completed in 2001. In 2008, the Commonwealth Youth Games took place in Pune, which encouraged development in the northwest region of the city. On 13 February 2010, a bomb exploded at the German Bakery in the upmarket Koregaon Park neighbourhood in eastern Pune, killing 17 and injuring 60. Evidence suggested that the Indian Mujahideen terrorist group carried out the attack.

=== 21st-century ===
Pune has evolved greatly since Indian Independence, from notable universities, colleges and management schools, earning it the nickname of the &#x27;Oxford Of The East&#x27;, to being one of the most important automobile manufacturing hub. Pune is also home to the world&#x27;s largest vaccine manufacturer, Serum Institute of India.

==Geography==

Pune is situated at approximately 18° 32&quot; north latitude and 73° 51&quot; east longitude. The city&#x27;s total area is 15.642 km2, and the municipal corporation area covers 518 km2. By road Pune is south-east of Mumbai, south-west of Indore, west of Nagpur, south of Delhi, north of Bangalore, north-west of Hyderabad.
Pune lies on the western margin of the Deccan plateau, at an altitude of above sea level. It is on the leeward side of the Sahyadri mountain range, which forms a barrier from the Arabian Sea. It is a hilly city, with Vetal Hill rising to above sea level. The Sinhagad fort is at an altitude of .

The old city of Pune is at the confluence of the Mula and Mutha rivers. The Pavana, a tributary of Mula river and Indrayani river, a tributary of the Bhima river, traverse the northwest Neighbourhoods of Pune.

===Cityscape===
The modern city of Pune has many distinct neighbourhoods. These include the numerous peths of the old city on the eastern bank of the Mutha river, the cantonment areas of Khadki and Camp established by the British, and numerous suburbs. There are several Peths in usual localities of the Pune city. The industrial growth in the Pimpri, Chinchwad, Akurdi, Nigdi and nearby areas allowed these areas to incorporate a new governing municipal corporation.

The Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR), initially defined in 1967, has grown to 7,256 km2 made up of the ten &quot;talukas&quot; of the Pune district. The areas of PMC and PCMC along with the three cantonment areas of Camp, Khadki, and Dehu Road form the urban core of the PMR, which also includes seven municipal councils and 842 villages.

Rapid industrialisation since the 1960s has led to large influx of people into the city. Housing supply has not kept pace with demand, causing the number of slum dwellings to increase. Approximately 36% of the population lives in 486 slum areas. Of these, 45% slum households do not have in-house toilet facilities and 10% do not have electricity. One third of the slums are on mixed ownership land. The living conditions in slums varies considerably, depending on their status (formal/informal) and in how far non-governmental organisations (NGOs), community organisations (CBOs) and government agencies are involved and committed to improving local living conditions. Since the 1990s a number of landmark integrated townships and gated communities have been developed in Pune such as Magarpatta, Nanded city, Amanora, Blue Ridge, Life Republic and Lavasa. They also offer business opportunities and access to infrastructure. According to the PMC, six townships with up to 15,000 housing units existed in Pune in 2012 and 25 more were in the planning process.

The Mercer 2017 Quality of Living Rankings evaluated living conditions in more than 440 cities around the world and ranked Pune at 145, second highest in India after Hyderabad at 144. The same source highlights Pune as being among evolving business centres and as one of nine emerging cities around the world with the citation &quot;Hosts IT and automotive companies&quot;. The 2017 Annual Survey of India&#x27;s City-Systems (ASICS) report, released by the Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy, adjudged Pune as the best governed of 23 major cities.

==== Peths in Pune ====

Peth is a general term in the Marathi language for a locality in Pune. Seventeen peths are located in Pune, which today constitute the old city of Pune. Most were established during the Maratha empire era under the Maratha and Peshwa rule of the city in the 18th century, before the arrival of the British. Pune is home to many distinctive peths, or place names, for various neighbourhoods. The majority of them bore the names of their founders and days of the week.

===Climate===
Pune has a tropical wet and dry (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;) climate, closely bordering upon a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;) with average temperatures ranging between . Pune experiences three seasons: summer, monsoon, and winter. Typical summer months are from mid-March to mid-June, with maximum temperatures sometimes reaching . The warmest month in Pune is May. The city often has heavy dusty winds in May, with humidity remaining high. Even during the hottest months, the nights are usually cool due to Pune&#x27;s high altitude. The highest temperature recorded was on 30April 1897.

The monsoon lasts from June to October, with moderate rainfall and temperatures ranging from . Most of the of annual rainfall in the city falls between June and September, and July is the wettest month of the year. Hailstorms are not unheard of.
For most of December and January the daytime temperature hovers around while overnight temperatures are below . 
On 11 May 2023, Koregaon Park recorded a temperature of 44.4 °C (112 °F) 

Pune has been ranked 23rd best “National Clean Air City” (under Category 1 &gt;10L Population cities) in India according to &#x27;Swachh Vayu Survekshan 2024 Results&#x27; 

===Seismology===

Pune is north of the seismically active zone around Koyna Dam. The India Meteorological Department has assessed this area as being in Zone 3, on a scale of 2 to 5, with 5 being the most prone to earthquakes. Pune has experienced some moderateand many lowintensity earthquakes in its history.

==Demographics==
The city has a population of 3,124,458; while 5,057,709 people reside in the Pune Urban Agglomeration . The latter was 4,485,000 in 2005. According to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), 40% of the population lived in slums in 2001.

Since Pune is a major industrial metropolis, it has attracted migrants from all parts of India. The number of people migrating to Pune rose from 43,900 in 2001 to 88,200 in 2005. The sharp increase in population during the decade 1991–2001 led to the absorption of 38 fringe villages into the city. The top five source areas of migrants are Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. The Sindhis in the city are mostly refugees and their descendants, who came to the area after the partition of India in 1947.

<text>Walking meditation (Chinese: 經行; Pinyin: &quot;jīngxíng&quot;; Romaji: &quot;kinhin&quot; or &quot;kyōgyō&quot;; Korean: &quot;gyeonghyaeng&quot;; Vietnamese: &quot;kinh hành&quot;) is a meditation practice done while walking common in Buddhism. It can be done as a standalone practice or as a break in between long periods of sitting meditation. In different forms, the practice is common in various traditions of both Theravada and in Mahayana Buddhism. The term &quot;kinhin&quot; consists of the Chinese words , meaning &quot;to go through (like the thread in a loom)&quot;, with &quot;sutra&quot; as a secondary meaning, and , meaning &quot;walk&quot;. Taken literally, the phrase means &quot;to walk straight back and forth.&quot;

== Theravāda ==

In Theravāda Buddhism, walking meditation is frequently performed in conjunction with seated meditation. Walking meditation is particularly emphasized in forest monastic traditions and in vipassana traditions, where meditators alternate between sitting and walking to sustain mindfulness and balance energy levels. In Theravāda, walking meditation involves walking a straight path back and forth, often around 20–30 steps in length. The meditator may walk slowly, placing attention on the sensations in the feet as they touch the ground. In the Vipassana movement traditions, the meditator silently notes the various walking sensations with phrases like &quot;lifting&quot;, &quot;moving&quot;, and &quot;placing&quot; (the foot). The goal is to develop sati (mindfulness) by staying present with the act of walking. 

This practice cultivates concentration and calms restlessness while training the mind to observe phenomena without attachment or aversion. In Vipassanā, or insight meditation, walking is used to deepen awareness of impermanence (anicca), suffering (dukkha), and non-self (anattā). The sensations experienced while walking—such as the contact of the feet, the rise and fall of the body, or environmental sounds—are observed as fleeting and insubstantial. Walking meditation thus becomes a tool for observing the arising and passing of phenomena, leading to direct insight into the nature of reality.

== Mahāyāna ==
East Asian Mahāyāna Buddhism integrates walking meditation with devotional and samādhi-oriented practices. Among its many forms, devotional circumambulation and specific methods such as the Tiantai four samādhis, and the Pure Land practice of walking nianfo hold significant importance for specific traditions. In the Tiantai (Jp: Tendai) school, they follow the &quot;Móhē zhǐguān&quot; of patriarch Zhiyi as the main meditation guide. This tradition practices two kinds of walking meditations: &quot;Constantly Walking Samādhi&quot; (&quot;chángxíng sānmèi&quot; 常行三昧) which consists of 90 days of mindful walking and meditating on Amitabha and &quot;Half-Walking Half-Seated Samādhi&quot; (&quot;bànxíng bànzuò sānmèi&quot; 半行半坐三昧) which includes numerous practices like chanting, penance, prayer, reciting the Lotus sutra, etc. In the Pure Land school, there is a common practice of circumambulating a Buddha statue of Amitabha and reciting his name during nianfo retreats.

In Zen Buddhism, kinhin is often done in between stretches of sitting meditation (zazen) as a break from prolonged sitting. The idea is to maintain the same meditative Zen mind throughout the walking period. Practitioners typically walk clockwise around the meditation hall or zendō while holding their hands in a gesture with one hand closed in a fist while the other hand grasps or covers the fist (; rōmaji: &quot;shashu&quot;). During walking meditation each step is taken after each full breath. The pace of walking meditation can be either slow (several steady steps per each breath) or brisk, almost to the point of jogging.

<text>Dickinson College is a private liberal arts college in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States. Founded in 1773 as Carlisle Grammar School, Dickinson was chartered on September 9, 1783, making it the first college to be founded after the formation of the United States. Dickinson was founded by Benjamin Rush, a Founding Father and signer of the Declaration of Independence. The college is named in honor of John Dickinson, a Founding Father who voted to ratify the Constitution and later served as governor of Pennsylvania, and his wife Mary Norris Dickinson, who donated much of their extensive personal libraries to the new college.

==History==

===18th century===

The Carlisle Grammar School was founded in 1773 as a frontier Latin school for young men in Western Pennsylvania. Within years Carlisle&#x27;s elite, such as James Wilson and John Montgomery, were pushing for the development of the school as a college. In 1782, Benjamin Rush, a physician who was a prominent leader during and after the American Revolution, met in Philadelphia with Montgomery and William Bingham, a prominent businessman and politician. As their conversation about founding a frontier college in Carlisle took place on his porch, &quot;Bingham&#x27;s Porch&quot; was long a rallying cry at Dickinson.

Dickinson College was chartered by the Pennsylvania legislature on September 9, 1783, six days after the signing of the Treaty of Paris that ended the Revolutionary War; it was the first college to be founded in the newly independent nation. Rush intended to name the college after the president of Pennsylvania John Dickinson and his wife Mary Norris Dickinson, proposing &quot;John and Mary&#x27;s College.&quot; The Dickinsons had given the new college an extensive library which they jointly owned, one of the largest libraries in the colonies. The name Dickinson College was chosen instead. Dickinson College&#x27;s location west of the Susquehanna River made it the westernmost college in the United States at the time of its 1783 founding. Rush made his first journey to Carlisle to attend the first meeting of the trustees, held in April 1784. The trustees selected Charles Nisbet, a Scottish minister and scholar, to serve as the college&#x27;s first president. He arrived and began to serve on July 4, 1785, serving until his unexpected death in 1804.

Among Dickinson&#x27;s 18th century graduates were Robert Cooper Grier and Roger Brooke Taney, both of whom later became U.S. Supreme Court justices, serving together on the court for 18 years.

===19th century===
A combination of financial troubles and faculty dissension led to a college closing from 1816 to 1821. In 1832, when the trustees were unable to resolve a faculty curriculum dispute, they ordered Dickinson&#x27;s temporary closure a second time.

The law school was founded in 1834, the third school of law established in the United States and the first in Pennsylvania. It became a separate school in 1890, although the law school and college continued to share a president until 1912. The law school is now affiliated with the Penn State University.

During the 19th century, two noted Dickinson College alumni had prominent roles in the lead-up to the Civil War. They were James Buchanan, the 15th president of the United States, and Roger Brooke Taney, the 5th chief justice of the United States. Dickinson is one of three liberal arts colleges to have graduated a president and a chief justice (Bowdoin and Amherst are the others). Taney led the Supreme Court in its ruling on the &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; decision, which held that Congress could not prohibit slavery in federal territories, overturning the Missouri Compromise. Buchanan threw the full prestige of his administration behind congressional approval of the Lecompton Constitution in Kansas. During the Civil War, the campus and town of Carlisle were occupied twice by Confederate forces in 1863.

Carlisle was also the location of the Carlisle Army Barracks, which was converted in the late 1870s for use as the Carlisle Indian Industrial School. In 1879, Dickinson College and the nearby Carlisle Indian School began a collaboration, when James Andrew McCauley, president of the college, led the first worship service at the Indian School. The collaboration between the institutions lasted almost four decades, from the opening day to the closing of the Indian School in 1918. Dickinson College professors served as chaplains and special faculty to the Native American students. Dickinson College students volunteered services, observed teaching methods, and participated in events at the Indian School. Dickinson College accepted select Indian School students to attend its Preparatory School (&quot;Conway Hall&quot;) and gain college-level education.

When George Metzger, class of 1798, died in 1879, he left his land and $25,000 () to the town of Carlisle to found a college for women. In 1881, the Metzger Institute opened. The college operated independently until 1913, when its building was leased to Dickinson College for the education of women. The building served as a women&#x27;s dorm until 1963.

In 1887, Zatae Longsdorff became the first woman to graduate from Dickinson.

===20th century===
In 1901, John Robert Paul Brock became the first black man to graduate from Dickinson; in 1919, Esther Popel Shaw was the first black woman to graduate.

Dickinson also admitted Native American students directly: Thomas P. Marshall, a Sioux from Pine Ridge agency, S. Dakota, was one of the first such students at Dickinson (his grave can be found in the Carlisle Indian Industrial School /CIIS/ cemetery). In 1910, Frank Mount Pleasant was the first Native American to graduate from Dickinson College.

In the 1990s, the college experienced financial troubles stemming from poor management and acceptance rates climbed upwards. Henry Clarke, an alumnus who developed the Klondike bar into a national brand for an ice cream bar, founded the Clarke Forum for Contemporary Issues at Dickinson College, and in 1994 established the Clarke Center. William Durden, who became the 27th President in 1999, was credited with improving financial climate and revamping the school academics.

===21st century===
Dickinson&#x27;s acceptance rate is 35%, and the institutional endowment has more than doubled since 2000.

In 2000 Dickinson opened a new science building, Tome Hall, a state-of-the-art interdisciplinary facility to host astronomy, computer science, math, and physics. Tome houses Dickinson&#x27;s innovative &quot;Workshop Physics&quot; program and was the first stage of a new science complex. Opened in 2008, the LEED Gold certified Rector Science Complex serves as a place of scientific exploration and learning in an environment that is artful and sustainable.

Dickinson acquired Allison United Methodist Church for college expansion in 2013. The building, located at 99  Mooreland Avenue, provides the college with more than for events, guest speakers, student presentations, meetings, ecumenical worship, and additional offices.

Dickinson aims for campus environmental sustainability through several initiatives. In the Sustainable Endowments Institute&#x27;s 2010 green report card Dickinson was one of only 15 schools in the United States to receive an A−, the highest grade possible. In the same year, Dickinson was named a &quot;Sierra&quot; magazine &quot;Cool School&quot; in its &quot;Comprehensive Guide to the Most Eco-Enlightened U.S. Colleges: Live (Green) and Learn&quot;. The college&#x27;s commitment to making study of the environment and sustainability a defining characteristic of a Dickinson education was also recognised through being top of The Princeton Review&#x27;s 2010 Green Honor Roll.

In 2008, the college bought 100% of its energy from wind power, had solar panels on campus, owned and operated an organic garden and farm, and had signed the American Colleges &amp; Universities Presidents Climate Commitment. The college&#x27;s emphasis on sustainability education recognizes its importance for innovation and the lives of tomorrow&#x27;s graduates. The college had made a commitment to being carbon neutral by 2020. This involved a mixture of increased energy efficiency on campus, switching energy sourcing, promoting behavior change and carbon offsetting.

==Campus==

Dickinson&#x27;s campus is three blocks from the main square in the historic small town of Carlisle, the county seat of Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, and the site of the nation&#x27;s second oldest military base, Carlisle Barracks, which is now used as the U.S. Army War College. The campus is characterized by limestone-clad buildings and has numerous trees.

The frontier grammar school was founded in 1773 and housed in a small, two-room brick building on Liberty Avenue, near Bedford and Pomfret streets. When Dickinson College was founded in 1783, this building was expanded to accommodate all the functions. In 1799 the Penn family sold on the western edge of Carlisle to the nascent college, which became its campus. On June 20 of that year, the cornerstone was laid by founding trustee John Montgomery for a building on the new land. The twelve-room building burned to the ground on February 3, 1803, five weeks after opening its doors. The college operations were temporarily returned to their previous accommodations.

Within weeks of the fire, a national fundraising campaign was launched, enticing donations from President Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of State James Madison, Chief Justice John Marshall, and others. Benjamin Latrobe, soon-to-be named as Architect of the Capitol, designed the building now known as &quot;West College&quot; or &quot;Old West.&quot; It was finished in 1822. Old West is today the ceremonial heart of the college, as all students march through the open doors during convocation and march out the same doors at graduation.

Throughout the 19th century, Dickinson expanded across what has now become its main academic quadrangle, known formally as the John Dickinson Campus. Dickinson expanded across College Street to build the Holland Union Building and Waidner-Spahr Library, which along with several dormitories, makes up the Benjamin Rush Campus. Across High Street (U.S. Route 11) lies the Charles Nisbet Campus, home to the largest grouping of dormitories. The Dickinson School of Law, part of Penn State, lies directly to the south of the Nisbet Campus. Together these three grass-covered units compose the vast majority of the college&#x27;s campus.

==Academics==
In addition to offering either a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in 22 disciplinary majors and 20 interdisciplinary majors, Dickinson offers an engineering option through its 3:2 program, which consists of three years at Dickinson and two years at an engineering school of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute or Case Western Reserve University. Upon successful completion of both portions of the program, students receive a B.S. degree from Dickinson in their chosen field and a B.S. in engineering from the engineering school.

Dickinson School of Law, founded in 1834 as the college&#x27;s law department, ended its affiliations with the college in 1917 and has been part of Penn State University since 2000. The college participates in a 3+3 program where fourth-year students can begin studies at the law school prior to their graduation from Dickinson College.

Dickinson College&#x27;s most popular majors, by 2021 graduates, were:
::International Business/Trade/Commerce (58)
::Political Science &amp; Government (35)
::Psychology (32)
::Biology/Biological Sciences (25)
::Economics (25)
::Neuroscience (23)
::Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Biology (21)

===Reputation and rankings===
In 2006, Dickinson decided to stop publicizing its ranking in &quot;America&#x27;s Best Colleges&quot; from &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;; however, in 2015 rankings Dickinson placed #40 among National Liberal Arts Colleges. In May 2007, Dickinson President William G. Durden joined with other college presidents in asking schools not to participate in the reputation portion of the magazine&#x27;s survey.

The Institute of International Education (IIE) ranked Dickinson No. 5 for a yearlong study abroad and No. 11 for semester-long study abroad in the baccalaureate category of its most recent Open Doors report (for the 2013–2014 academic year).

Dickinson is a perennial producer of Fulbright Scholars, and the Department of State&#x27;s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs has named Dickinson a Top Producer every year for the last six years. It is also a top producer of Peace Corps Volunteers, ranking 8th among small colleges and universities in 2014.

In Howard and Matthew Greene&#x27;s 2016 Edition of &quot;The Hidden Ivies&quot;, Dickinson College was named one of &quot;63 Top Liberal Arts Colleges and Universities&quot;.

In 2021, the Princeton Review ranked Dickinson College number two on their 2022 &#x27;Top 50 Green Colleges&#x27; List In 2010, Dickinson was one of only 15 schools to receive an A− in the Sustainable Endowments Institute&#x27;s 2010 green report card. The college was named a Sierra magazine &quot;Cool School&quot; in its Comprehensive Guide to the Most Eco-Enlightened U.S. Colleges. The college&#x27;s commitment to making a study of the environment and sustainability a defining characteristic of a Dickinson education landed it at the top of The Princeton Review&#x27;s 2010 Green Honor Roll.

<doc id="164640" wikidata="Q11662" url="?curid=164640" title="Steffi Graf">
<text>Stefanie Maria Graf ( , ; born 14 June 1969) is a German former professional tennis player. Widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time, she was ranked as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s singles by the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA) for a record 377 weeks, and finished as the year-end No. 1 a record eight times. Graf won 107 singles titles on the WTA Tour, including 22 major women&#x27;s singles titles, the second-most since the start of the Open Era in 1968 and the third-most of all time. She is the only tennis player, male or female, to have won each major singles tournament at least four times — a quadruple career Grand Slam.

A teen phenom, Graf became the youngest-ever player to appear in the main draw of a major at the 1983 French Open aged 13. She gradually improved over the following years and emerged as the player who ended Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova&#x27;s dominance on women&#x27;s tennis, winning her first major at the 1987 French Open. In 1988, Graf ascended into dominance, becoming the first tennis player to achieve the Golden Slam by winning all four major titles and the Olympic gold medal in the same calendar year. The following few years saw her remain the best player in the world, but struggle with injuries and the rise of young rivals, especially Monica Seles. Following the stabbing of Seles in 1993, Graf returned to dominance on the women&#x27;s tour for the next several years. Following more injury struggles in 1997 and 1998, in 1999 Graf captured her 22nd and final major title at the French Open, reached the Wimbledon final, and retired from the sport thereafter, aged 30 and ranked as the world No. 3.

Notable features of Graf&#x27;s game were her versatility across all playing surfaces, footwork, and powerful forehand drive. Graf&#x27;s athletic ability and aggressive game played from the baseline have been credited with developing the modern style of play that has come to dominate today&#x27;s game. Billie Jean King said, &quot;Steffi [Graf] is definitely the greatest women&#x27;s tennis player of all time.&quot; Graf was named the greatest female tennis player of the 20th century by the Associated Press and when asked in 2016 to name the greatest players of all time, Serena Williams answered Graf and Roger Federer. Graf was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame in 2004. Along with Boris Becker, Graf is considered instrumental in popularizing tennis in Germany. She has been married to fellow tennis player Andre Agassi since 2001. They have two children.

==Early life==
Stefanie Graf was born on 14 June 1969, in Mannheim, Baden-Württemberg, West Germany, to Heidi Schalk and car-and-insurance salesman Peter Graf (18 June 1938 − 30 November 2013). When she was nine years old, her family moved to the neighboring town of Brühl. She has a younger brother, Michael. 

Her father, an aspiring tennis coach, first introduced her to the game, teaching his three-year-old daughter how to swing a wooden racket in the family&#x27;s living room. She began practising on a court at the age of four and played in her first tournament at five. She soon began taking the top prize at junior tournaments with regularity, going on to win the European Championships 12s and 18s in 1982.

==Career==
===Early career===
Graf played in her first professional tournament in October 1982 at Filderstadt, Germany. She lost her first round match 6–4, 6–0 to Tracy Austin, a two-time US Open champion and former world No. 1 player.

At the start of her first full professional year in 1983, Graf was 13 years old and ranked world No. 124. She won no titles during the next three years, but her ranking climbed steadily to world No. 98 in 1983, No. 22 in 1984, and No. 6 in 1985. In 1984, she first gained international attention when she almost upset the tenth seed, Jo Durie of the United Kingdom, in a fourth round Centre Court match at Wimbledon. In August as a 15-year-old (and youngest entrant) representing West Germany, she won the tennis demonstration event at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. No medals were awarded as this was not an official Olympic event.

Graf&#x27;s schedule was closely controlled by her father Peter Graf, who limited her play so that she would not burn out. In 1985, for instance, she played only ten events leading up to the US Open, whereas another up-and-coming star, Gabriela Sabatini, played 21. Peter Graf also kept a tight rein on his daughter&#x27;s personal life. Social invitations on the tour were often declined as Graf&#x27;s focus was kept on practicing and match play. Working with her father and then-coach Pavel Složil, Graf typically practiced for up to four hours a day, often heading straight from airports to practice courts. This narrow focus meant that Graf, already shy and retiring by nature, made few friends on the tour in her early years, but it led to a steady improvement in her play.

In 1985 and early 1986, Graf emerged as the top challenger to the dominance of Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert. During that period, she lost six times to Evert and three times to Navratilova, all in straight sets. She did not win a tournament but consistently reached tournament finals, semifinals and quarterfinals, with the highlight being a semifinal defeat to Navratilova at the US Open.

On 13 April 1986, Graf won her first WTA tournament and beat Evert for the first time in the final of the Family Circle Cup in Hilton Head, South Carolina (she never lost to Evert again, beating her seven more times over the next three and a half years). Graf then won her next three tournaments at Amelia Island, Indianapolis, and Berlin, culminating in a 6–2, 6–3 defeat of Navratilova in the final of the latter. Illness caused her to miss Wimbledon, and an accident where she broke a toe several weeks later also curtailed her play. She returned to win a small tournament at Mahwah just before the US Open where, in one of the most anticipated matches of the year, she encountered Navratilova in a semifinal. Navratilova prevailed over Graf in the semifinal 6–1, 6–7(7–3), 7–6(10–8), saving three match points in an epic spread over two days. Graf then won three consecutive indoor titles at Tokyo, Zurich, and Brighton, before once again contending with Navratilova at the season-ending Virginia Slims Championships in New York. This time, Navratilova beat Graf 7–6, 6–3, 6–2.

===Breakthrough year: 1987===
Graf&#x27;s Grand Slam tournament breakthrough came in 1987. She started the year strongly, with six tournament victories heading into the French Open, with the highlight being at the tournament in Miami, where she defeated Martina Navratilova in a semifinal and Chris Evert in the final and lost only 20 games in the seven rounds of the tournament. In the French Open final, Graf defeated Navratilova, who was the world No. 1, 6–4, 4–6, 8–6 after beating Sabatini in a three-set semifinal.

Graf then lost to Navratilova 7–5, 6–3 in the Wimbledon final, her first loss of the year. However, in the Federation Cup final in Vancouver, Canada, three weeks later, she defeated Evert easily 6–2, 6–1. The US Open ended anti-climactically as Navratilova defeated Graf in the final 7–6, 6–1.

Graf had a win–loss record of 75–2 for a 97.4 winning percentage in 1987, both losses coming to Navratilova as they split the four matches they played during the year. On 17 August, after defeating Evert in a straight set final in the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles, Graf overtook Navratilova for the world No. 1 ranking for the first time in her career, a ranking she would hold for the next 186 consecutive weeks, a record (it was tied by Serena Williams in 2016). Graf was the first player other than Navratilova or Evert to hold the top spot since Tracy Austin in 1980.

===Grand Slam: 1988===

Graf started 1988 by winning the Australian Open, defeating Chris Evert in the final 6–1, 7–6. Graf did not lose a set during the tournament and lost a total of only 29 games.

Graf lost twice to Sabatini during the spring, once on hardcourts in Boca Raton, Florida, and once on clay at Amelia Island, Florida. Graf, however, won the tournament in San Antonio, Texas, and retained her title in Miami, where she once again defeated Evert in the final. Graf then won the tournament in Berlin, losing only twelve games in five matches.

At the French Open, Graf successfully defended her title by defeating Natasha Zvereva 6–0, 6–0 in a 34-minute final. The official time of the match given on the scoresheet was 34 minutes; however, just 32 minutes of that was spent on the court, as a rain break split the match into two periods of play, of nine and 23 minutes. That was the shortest-ever and most one-sided Grand Slam final ever and the only double bagel in a Major final since 1911. Zvereva, who had eliminated Martina Navratilova in the fourth round, won only thirteen points in the match.

Next came Wimbledon, where Martina Navratilova had won six straight titles. Graf was trailing Martina Navratilova in the final 7–5, 2–0 before winning the match 5–7, 6–2, 6–1. She then won tournaments in Hamburg and Mahwah (where she lost only eight games all tournament).

At the US Open, Graf beat Sabatini in a three-set final, 6–3, 3–6, 6–1, to win the Grand Slam, a feat previously performed by only two other women, Maureen Connolly Brinker in 1953 and Margaret Court in 1970. Graf&#x27;s 1988 Grand Slam remains the only one in history completed on three surfaces (grass, clay, hard court), as all other Grand Slams in tennis history were achieved prior to the introduction of hard court at the US Open in 1978.

In reaching and winning all four Grand Slam finals, Graf became the first player in history to contest and win 28 Grand Slam singles matches in a single year; albeit including the unplayed walkover against Evert in the US Open. Even discounting that result, no other player had played and won 27 Grand Slam matches in a single year before. Since then, five players managed a 27–1 win–loss record, meaning all of them failed to win the Grand Slam: Graf in 1989 and 1993, Monica Seles in 1992, Martina Hingis in 1997, Roger Federer in 2006, and Novak Djokovic in 2015, 2021 and 2023.

Graf then defeated Sabatini 6–3, 6–3 in the gold medal match at the Olympic Games in Seoul and achieved what the media had dubbed the &quot;Golden Slam&quot;, the first tennis player to do this. Graf also won her only Grand Slam doubles title that year—at Wimbledon partnering Sabatini—and picked up a women&#x27;s doubles Olympic bronze medal. Graf was the first tennis player to achieve this.

At the year-ending Virginia Slims Championships, Graf was upset by Pam Shriver, only her third loss of the year. The loss deprived her of the Golden Super Slam. She was named the 1988 BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year.

At the end of the year, the municipality of Brühl, her hometown, gave her the title of honorary citizen.

===New challengers and personal challenges===
====1989====
Speculation was rife at the beginning of 1989 about the possibility of Graf winning another Grand Slam. Some noted observers, such as Margaret Court, suggested that Graf could achieve the feat a couple more times. And the year began as expected, with Graf extending her Grand Slam tournament winning streak to five events at the Australian Open, defeating Helena Suková in the final. Her 6–3, 6–0 defeat of Gabriela Sabatini in a semifinal was described by veteran observer Ted Tinling as &quot;probably the best tennis I&#x27;ve seen&quot;. He went on to add, &quot;I saw what Steffi did to Sabatini at the Australian Open this year, and that was it. She is better than them all.&quot;

Graf followed this with easy victories in her next four tournaments at Washington, D.C., San Antonio, Texas, Boca Raton, Florida, and Hilton Head. The Washington, D.C. tournament was notable because Graf won the first twenty points of the final against Zina Garrison. In the Boca Raton final, Graf lost the only set she conceded to Chris Evert in their final seven matches.

In the subsequent Amelia Island final on clay, Graf lost her first match of the year to Sabatini but returned to European clay with easy victories at Hamburg and Berlin.

Graf&#x27;s Grand Slam tournament winning streak ended at the French Open, where 17-year-old Spaniard Arantxa Sánchez Vicario beat Graf in three sets. Graf served for the match at 5–3 in the third set but lost the game and won only three more points in the match. Suffering from food poisoning, she had struggled to beat Monica Seles in their semifinal 6–3, 3–6, 6–3 and said that she had menstrual cramps in the final. Graf, however, recovered to defeat Martina Navratilova 6–2, 6–7, 6–1 in the Wimbledon final after defeating Monica Seles 6–0, 6–1 in a fourth round match, Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in a quarterfinal, and Chris Evert in a semifinal.

Graf warmed up for the US Open with easy tournament victories in San Diego and Mahwah. In her semifinal match at the US Open, Graf defeated Sabatini 3–6, 6–4, 6–2. The match was notable for its dramatic ending. Having suffered from leg cramps since the middle of the third set, Graf ran off the court seconds after match point to seek medical treatment. In the final, Navratilova led 6–3, 4–2 before Graf rallied to win 3–6, 7–5, 6–1 for her third Grand Slam singles title of the year.

Victories at Zurich and Brighton preceded the Virginia Slims Championships, where Graf cemented her top-ranked status by beating Navratilova in the four-set final. Graf ended 1989 with an 86–2 match record and the loss of only 12 sets. Her 0.977 winning percentage is the second-highest in the open era behind Navratilova.

====1990====
Graf defeated Mary Joe Fernández in the final of the Australian Open, which was her eighth Grand Slam singles title in the last nine she contested. She survived an intense three-set battle with Helena Sukova in the semis, breaking in the tenth and final game to win the third set 6–4. Her winning streak (unbeaten since the 1989 French Open loss to Arantxa Sánchez) continued with victories in Tokyo, Amelia Island, and Hamburg. Shortly after winning in Tokyo, Graf injured her right thumb while cross-country skiing in Switzerland and subsequently withdrew from the Virginia Slims of Florida and the Lipton Championships. In Berlin, she extended her unbeaten streak to 66 matches (second in WTA history to Navratilova&#x27;s 74) before losing the final to Monica Seles, 4–6, 3–6.

While the Berlin tournament was being played, the largest-circulation German tabloid, &quot;Bild&quot;, ran a story about an alleged scandal involving Graf&#x27;s father. The difficulty of answering questions about the matter came to a head at a Wimbledon press conference, where Graf broke down in tears. Wimbledon authorities then threatened to immediately shut down any subsequent press conferences where questions about the issue were asked. Whether this scandal affected Graf&#x27;s form is open to debate. In an interview with &quot;Stern&quot; magazine in July 1990, Graf stated, &quot;I could not fight as usual.&quot;

Graf again lost to Monica Seles in the final of the French Open 6–7, 4–6. Seles was behind 2–6 in the first-set tiebreaker, but then came back to win six points in a row and take the set. At Wimbledon, Graf lost in the semifinals to Zina Garrison, who with this victory broke Graf&#x27;s string of 13 consecutive major finals. This was a major upset as Garrison had to save a match point to defeat Monica Seles in the quarterfinal, and was expected to easily fall to Graf, whom she had not beaten in four years. After victories in Montreal and San Diego, Graf reached the US Open final, where she lost in straight sets to Sabatini. Graf won four indoor tournaments after the US Open, including a pair of straight-set wins over Sabatini in the finals of Zürich and Worcester. Although Sabatini got the best of Graf in the semifinals of the season-ending Virginia Slims Championships, Graf still finished the year as the top-ranked player.

====1991====
A mixture of injury problems, personal difficulties, and loss of form made 1991 a tough year for Graf. Seles established herself as the new dominant player on the women&#x27;s tour, winning the Australian Open, French Open, and US Open and, in March, ending Graf&#x27;s record 186 consecutive-weeks hold on the World No. 1 ranking. Graf briefly regained the top ranking after winning at Wimbledon but lost it again after her loss to Navratilova at the US Open.

Graf lost an Australian Open quarterfinal to Jana Novotná, the first time she did not reach the semifinals of a Grand Slam singles tournament since the 1986 French Open. She then lost to Sabatini in her next three tournaments before winning the U.S. Hardcourt Championships in San Antonio, beating Monica Seles in the final. After losing a fifth straight time to Sabatini in Amelia Island, Florida, Graf again defeated Seles in the Hamburg final. Following her tournament victory in German Open in Berlin, Graf suffered one of the worst defeats of her career in a French Open semifinal where she won only two games against Sánchez Vicario and lost her first 6–0 set since 1984. At Wimbledon, however, Graf captured her third women&#x27;s crown, this time at Sabatini&#x27;s expense. Sabatini served for the match twice, and was two points away from her first Wimbledon title. After breaking Sabatini&#x27;s serve to even the third set at 6–6, Graf defeated Sabatini by winning the next two games to take the match 6–4, 3–6, 8–6. Martina Navratilova then defeated Graf 7–6, 6–7, 6–4 in a US Open semifinal, the first time she had beaten Graf in four years. Graf then won in Leipzig, with her 500th career victory coming in a quarterfinal against Judith Wiesner. After winning two more indoor tournaments at Zurich and Brighton, she failed once again in the Virginia Slims Championships, losing her quarterfinal to Novotná. Soon after, she split with her long-time coach, Pavel Složil.

====1992====
A bout of rubella forced Graf to miss the first major event of 1992, the Australian Open. Her year continued indifferently with losses in three of her first four tournaments, including a semifinal loss to Jana Novotná in Chicago. It was Graf&#x27;s second consecutive loss to Novotna, and dating back to their 1991 Australian Open quarterfinal match, Jana had won three of their last five meetings. It would also be the last loss Graf would ever have to Novotna in a match she completed (she did have a loss after withdrawing with injury after the first set of a late 1996 match). Chicago was notable, however, for being the first tournament Graf played with her new coach, former Swiss player Heinz Günthardt. Graf&#x27;s father had approached Günthardt during the 1991 Virginia Slims Championships. She would work with him for the remainder of her career. In Boca Raton, Florida, Graf reached her first final of the year, where she faced Conchita Martínez for the title. In their five previous head-to-head matches, Graf had defeated Martínez each time. Even though she lost the opening set, Graf went on to prevail in three sets. She lost twice to Sabatini in the early spring at the Lipton International and the Bausch &amp; Lomb Championships, which now brought her to seven losses in her last eight matches against Sabatini; however, the Bausch &amp; Lomb loss would be Graf&#x27;s final loss to Sabatini, winning her next, and last eight matches against Sabatini.

Victories at Hamburg and Berlin (beating Sánchez Vicario in the finals of both) prepared her for the French Open, where she defeated Sánchez Vicario in the semifinals after losing the first set 6–0. Graf then lost a closely contested final to Monica Seles, 2–6, 6–3, 8–10. Seles won the match on her fifth match point; Graf came within two points of winning the match a few games earlier. At Wimbledon, after struggling through early-round three-setters against Mariaan de Swardt and Patty Fendick, she easily defeated Natasha Zvereva in the quarterfinal, Sabatini in the semifinal, and Seles in the final, 6–2, 6–1, with Seles playing in almost complete silence because of widespread media and player criticism of her grunting. Graf then won all five of her Fed Cup matches, helping Germany defeat Spain in the final by defeating Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, 6–4, 6–2. At the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Graf lost to Jennifer Capriati in the final and claimed the silver medal. At the US Open, Graf was upset in the quarterfinals by Sánchez Vicario 7–6, 6–3. Four consecutive indoor tournament victories in the autumn helped improve her season, but for the third consecutive year, she failed to win the Virginia Slims Championships, where she lost in the first round to Lori McNeil.

===Second period of dominance===
====1993====
Graf began 1993 with four losses in her first six tournaments of the year: two to Sánchez Vicario and one each to Seles and the 36-year-old Martina Navratilova. Seles defeated Graf at the Australian Open 4–6, 6–3, 6–2. She struggled at the German Open in Berlin where she lost a 6–0 set to the unheralded Sabine Hack before defeating Mary Joe Fernández and Sabatini in three-set matches to claim her seventh title there in eight years.

During a quarterfinal match between Seles and Magdalena Maleeva in Hamburg, Seles was stabbed between the shoulder blades by a mentally ill German fan of Graf, Günter Parche. He claimed that he committed the attack to help Graf reclaim the world No. 1 ranking. More than two years elapsed before Seles competed again. Shortly after the stabbing, during a players meeting at the Italian Open in Rome, 17 of the world&#x27;s top 25 WTA members voted against preserving Seles&#x27; world No. 1 ranking while she was sidelined. Since Graf skipped the Italian Open, she did not take part in the vote.

During Seles&#x27;s absence, Graf won 65 of 67 matches, three of four Grand Slam events and the year-end Virginia Slims championships. She won her first French Open title since 1988 with a three-set victory over Mary Joe Fernández in the final. Fernandez had two break points to take a 3–0 and double break lead in the third set. The win elevated Graf to the world No. 1 ranking for the first time in 22 months. At Wimbledon, Graf defeated Jana Novotná to win her third consecutive, and fifth overall, ladies&#x27; title. In the third and deciding set, Novotná had a point to go up 5–1 on her serve. After breaking Novotná&#x27;s serve, Graf won the next four games to take the match 7–6, 1–6, 6–4. Graf had a bone splinter in her right foot during this tournament (and for the next few months), finally resulting in surgery on 4 October.

In the meantime, she lost surprisingly to Nicole Bradtke of Australia in a Fed Cup match on clay before winning the Acura Classic in San Diego and the Canadian Open in Toronto in preparation for the US Open. She won there, comfortably beating Helena Suková in the final after needing three sets to eliminate Gabriela Sabatini and Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere in the quarterfinals and semifinals respectively. In the fall, Graf won the Volkswagen Card Cup in Leipzig a day before her foot operation, losing only two games to Jana Novotná in the final. Graf lost to Conchita Martínez in her comeback tournament a month later in Philadelphia. However, she finished her year with a highlight, winning her first Virginia Slims Championships since 1989 by beating Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in the final despite needing painkillers for a back injury.

====1994====
Seemingly free of injury for the first time in years, Graf began the year by winning the Australian Open, where she defeated Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in the final with the loss of only two games. Graf later stated it was the best tennis she had ever played in a Grand Slam final. She then won her next four tournaments in Tokyo, Indian Wells, Delray Beach and Miami respectively. In the Miami final, she lost her first set of the year—to Natasha Zvereva—after winning 54 consecutive sets. In the Hamburg final, she lost for the first time in 1994 after 36 consecutive match victories, losing to Sánchez Vicario in three sets. She then won her eighth German Open, but there were signs that her form was worsening as she almost lost to Julie Halard in a quarterfinal. As the defending champion Graf lost in straight sets to Mary Pierce in the French Open semifinal. This was followed by a first-round straight-sets loss at Wimbledon to Lori McNeil, her only loss at Wimbledon between 1991 and 1997 and her first loss in a first round Grand Slam tournament in ten years. Graf still managed to win San Diego the following month but aggravated a long-time back injury in beating Sánchez Vicario in the final. Graf developed a bone spur at the base of her spine due to a congenital condition of the sacroiliac joint. She began to wear a back brace and was unsure about playing the US Open but elected to play while receiving treatment and stretching for two hours before each match. She made it to the final and took the first set against Sánchez Vicario but lost the next two sets — Sanchez Vicario&#x27;s last victory over Graf. In the middle of the second set, Graf suffered back spasms while reaching for a ball in the ad court. She took the following nine weeks off, returning only for the Virginia Slims Championships where she lost in straight sets to Pierce in the quarterfinal. Although Graf ended the year ranked No. 1 on the computer the ITF named Sanchez Vicario its World Champion for the year, while the WTA backed their official rankings and named Graf.

====1995====
A strained right calf muscle forced Graf to withdraw from the Australian Open. She came back in February, winning four consecutive tournaments in Paris, Delray Beach, Miami and Houston. She then beat Sánchez Vicario in the finals of both the French Open and Wimbledon. The 1995 Wimbledon final is regarded as one of the most dramatic women&#x27;s major finals in history as Graf and Sánchez Vicario battled in a tight third set that included a 16-minute long, 13-deuce game on Sanchez Vicario&#x27;s serve at 5–5. In August Monica Seles made her much anticipated return to tennis at the Canadian Open. It was decided to grant her a joint number-one ranking with Graf who took her first loss of the year in the first round to Amanda Coetzer. The US Open was Monica Seles&#x27;s first Grand Slam event since the 1993 attack, with much anticipation again around a potential Seles-Graf final. After surviving a scare in a three-setter against Amanda Coetzer in the first round, Graf reached the final with relative ease, while Seles went through her side of the draw in even more convincing fashion. Seles and Graf met in the final, with Graf winning in three sets, saving a set point in the first set. Graf then capped the year by beating countrywoman Anke Huber in a five-set final at the season-ending WTA Championships in 2 hours and 46 minutes.

=====Tax issues=====
In personal terms, 1995 was a difficult year for Graf, as she was accused by German authorities of tax evasion in the early years of her career. In her defense, she stated that her father Peter was her financial manager, and all financial matters relating to her earnings at the time had been under his control. Her father was arrested in August and was sentenced to 45 months in jail. He was eventually released after serving 25 months. Prosecutors dropped their case against Graf in 1997, when she agreed to pay a fine of 1.3 million Deutsche Marks to the government and an unspecified charity.

====1996====
Graf again missed the Australian Open after undergoing surgery in December 1995 to remove bone splinters from her left foot. Graf came back to the tour in March, winning back to back titles in Indian Wells and Miami, followed by a record ninth title at the German Open in May and a quarterfinal defeat in Rome against Martina Hingis. She then successfully defended the three Grand Slam titles she won the year before. In a close French Open final, Graf again overcame Sánchez Vicario, taking the third set 10–8. Graf had led 4–1 in the second set tiebreak, only to lose six points in a row and force a decider. Twice in the third set Sánchez Vicario served for the championship but was broken each time by Graf. It was the longest French Open women&#x27;s singles final in history, both in terms of time (3 hours and 3 minutes) and number of games played (40). Graf then had a straight-sets win against Sánchez Vicario in the Wimbledon final. That was the last competitive match Graf and Sánchez Vicario would ever play against one another. In July, a left knee injury forced Graf to withdraw from the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Graf played only one warm-up event ahead of the US Open, the Acura Classic in Manhattan Beach, California, where she lost to Lindsay Davenport in the semifinals. She then successfully defended her title at the US Open, defeating Monica Seles in the final. Her toughest battle came against rising star Martina Hingis in the semifinal, with Hingis unable to convert on five set points. Graf did not lose a set the whole tournament. She also won her fifth and final WTA Tour Championships title with a five set win over Martina Hingis, with Hingis cramping up in the fifth set.
In 1988, Graf became only the second tennis player in history to win a Slam on hardcourt, clay, and grass all in the same season. She repeated the feat in 1993, 1995, and 1996.

===Final years on the tour: 1997–99===

The last few years of Graf&#x27;s career were beset by injuries, particularly to her knees and back. She lost the world No. 1 ranking to Martina Hingis and failed to win a Grand Slam title for the first time in ten years in 1997. That year Graf lost in the fourth round of the Australian Open in straight sets to Amanda Coetzer.
She subsequently withdrew from the Pan Pacific Open and had arthroscopic surgery performed on her left knee. After several months injury lay off, Graf returned to play in the German Open in Berlin in front of a home crowd and had the worst defeat of her career in the quarterfinal, when Amanda Coetzer beat her in just 56 minutes 6–0, 6–1. In the French Open Graf was again beaten by Amanda Coetzer in straight sets, 6–1, 6–4. Only one week later, she underwent reconstructive knee surgery in Vienna and subsequently missed the 1997 Wimbledon and US Open championships. The treatment was for a fracture of the cartilage as well as a shortening and partial rupture of the patellar tendon of her left knee.
After missing almost half of the tour in 1998, Graf lost in the third round at Wimbledon and in the fourth round at the US Open. Shortly after the US Open, she underwent surgery to remove a bone spur in her right wrist. Upon her return Graf defeated world No. 2 Hingis and world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport en route to the Philadelphia title. At the first round of the season-ending Chase Championships, Graf defeated world No. 3, Jana Novotná, before losing in the semifinal to first-seeded Davenport.

At the beginning of 1999 Graf played the warm up event to the Australian Open in Sydney; she defeated Serena Williams in the second round and Venus in the quarterfinals before losing to Lindsay Davenport in the semifinal. Graf then went on to reach the quarterfinals of the Australian Open before losing to Monica Seles in two sets. In Indian Wells Graf lost to Serena Williams in three sets.

At the French Open, Graf reached her first Grand Slam final in three years and fought back from a set and twice from a break down in the second set to defeat the top ranked Hingis in three sets for a memorable victory. Graf became the first player in the open era to defeat the first, second, and third ranked players in the same Grand Slam tournament by beating second-ranked Davenport in the quarterfinals and third-ranked Seles in the semifinals. Graf said after the final that it would be her last French Open, fueling speculation about her retirement.

Graf then reached her ninth Wimbledon singles final, losing to third-seeded Davenport in straight sets. She had to overcome three difficult three set matches en route to this final, against Mariaan De Swardt in the second round, Venus Williams in the quarterfinals and Mirjana Lučić in the semifinals.

On 13 August 1999, shortly after retiring with a strained hamstring from a second round match against Amy Frazier in San Diego, Graf announced her retirement from the women&#x27;s tour at age 30. She was ranked No. 3 at that time and said, &quot;I have done everything I wanted to do in tennis. I feel I have nothing left to accomplish. The weeks following Wimbledon [in 1999] weren&#x27;t easy for me. I was not having fun anymore. After Wimbledon, for the first time in my career, I didn&#x27;t feel like going to a tournament. My motivation wasn&#x27;t what it was in the past.&quot;

===Doubles career===
From the beginning of her career until 1990, Graf regularly played doubles matches in Grand Slams and other tournaments, winning a total of 11 doubles titles. In 1986, she formed a partnership with rival Gabriela Sabatini. The pair was moderately successful, winning the 1988 Wimbledon Championships together and reaching the finals of the French Open in 1986, 1987 and 1989. The partnership was the subject of much discussion, as the two women, both known to be shy, usually kept communication to a minimum during changeovers and between points, a highly unusual situation in doubles. Sabatini said of the partnership: &quot;doubles is all about communicating with each other, and we didn&#x27;t communicate that much. We would just say the basic things, but nothing else.&quot; The pair played their last major tournament together at the 1990 Wimbledon Championships, losing in the quarterfinals. From 1991 until the end of her career, Graf would only play doubles sporadically, forming short-term partnerships with a variety of players, including Lori McNeil, Anke Huber and her best friends on the tour, Rennae Stubbs, Patricia Tarabini and Ines Gorrochategui. She played her last Grand Slam doubles tournament at the 1999 Australian Open with Gorrochategui, losing in the second round.

Graf also occasionally played mixed doubles, although she never won a title. She partnered with doubles specialist Mark Woodforde at the Australian Open in 1994, with Henri Leconte at Wimbledon in 1991 and at the French Open in 1994, and with Charlie Pasarell at the US Open in 1984. In an unusual arrangement, she paired with her coaches Pavel Složil at Wimbledon in 1988 and Heinz Günthardt in 1992 and 1996, also at Wimbledon. At the 1999 Wimbledon Championships, Graf formed a much-publicized partnership with John McEnroe, with whom she reached the semifinals before withdrawing due to concerns that her uncertain hamstring, coupled with a bout of bronchitis, would affect her in the singles final.

===Post-career exhibition matches===

In late 1999 and early 2000, as part of her Farewell Tour, Graf played a series of exhibition matches against former rivals in New Zealand, Japan, Spain, Germany and South Africa. She played Jelena Dokic in Christchurch, New Zealand, Amanda Coetzer in Durban, South Africa, and her former rival Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in Zaragoza, Spain. It was Graf and Sánchez Vicario&#x27;s first head-to-head meeting since 1996. In February 2000, Graf played against Kimiko Date at Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium in Tokyo, Nagoya Rainbow Hall in Nagoya, winning in three sets. In September 2004, Graf dispatched her former doubles partner Gabriela Sabatini, in straight sets, in an exhibition match played in Berlin, Germany. She was also in Berlin to host a charity gala, as well as inaugurating a tennis stadium renamed the &quot;Steffi Graf Stadion&quot;. Proceeds from her match against Sabatini went to Graf&#x27;s foundation, &quot;Children for Tomorrow&quot;.

In July 2005, Graf competed in one tie of World Team Tennis (WTT) on the Houston Wranglers team. She was beaten in two out of three matches, with each match being one set. Graf lost her singles match to Elena Likhovtseva 5–4. She teamed with Ansley Cargill in women&#x27;s doubles against Anna Kournikova and Likhovtseva but lost 5–2. She was successful, however, in the mixed doubles match. Graf completely ruled out a return to professional tennis. In October, Graf defeated Sabatini in an exhibition match in Mannheim, Germany, winning both of their sets. Like the exhibition match the previous year against Sabatini, proceeds went to &quot;Children for Tomorrow&quot;.
In 2008 Graf lost an exhibition match against Kimiko Date at Ariake Colosseum in Tokyo. As part of the event, billed as &quot;Dream Match 2008&quot;, she defeated Martina Navratilova in a one-set affair 8–7, with Graf winning a tiebreaker 10–5. It was the first time in 14 years Graf had played Navratilova. Graf played a singles exhibition match against Kim Clijsters and a mixed doubles exhibition alongside husband Andre Agassi against Tim Henman and Clijsters as part of a test event and celebration for the newly installed roof over Wimbledon&#x27;s Centre Court in 2009. She lost a lengthy one-set singles match to Clijsters and also the mixed doubles.

In 2010, Graf participated in the WTT Smash Hits exhibition in Washington, D.C. to support the Elton John AIDS Foundation. She and Agassi, her husband, were on Team Elton John, which competed against Team Billie Jean King. Graf played in the celebrity doubles, women&#x27;s doubles, and mixed doubles before straining her left calf muscle and being replaced by Anna Kournikova.

===Summary of career===
Graf won seven singles titles at Wimbledon, six singles titles at the French Open, five singles titles at the US Open, and four singles titles at the Australian Open. Her overall record in 56 Grand Slam events was 278–32 (90 percent) (84–10 at the French Open, 74–7 at Wimbledon, 73–9 at the US Open, and 47–6 at the Australian Open). Her career prize-money earnings totalled US$21,895,277 (a record until Lindsay Davenport surpassed this amount in January 2008). Her singles win–loss record was 900–115 (88.7 percent). She was ranked world No. 1 for 186 consecutive weeks (from August 1987 to March 1991; tied with Serena Williams, a record in the women&#x27;s game) and a record total 377 weeks overall.

==Playing style==
The main weapons in Graf&#x27;s game were her powerful inside-out forehand drive (which earned her the moniker &quot;Fräulein Forehand&quot;) and her intricate footwork. She often positioned herself in her backhand corner and although this left her forehand wide open and vulnerable to attack, her court speed meant that only the most accurate shots wide to her forehand caused any trouble. Graf&#x27;s game was versatile across multiple playing surfaces, and she excelled at her footwork and powerful forehand drive.

Graf&#x27;s technique on the forehand was unique and instantly recognizable: generating considerable racquet head speed with her swing, she reached the point of contact late and typically out of the air. As a result, she hit her forehand with exceptional pace and accuracy. According to her coaches Pavel Složil and Heinz Günthardt, Graf&#x27;s superior sense of timing was the key behind the success of her forehand.

Graf also had a powerful backhand drive but over the course of her career tended to use it less frequently, opting more often for an effective backhand slice. Starting in the early 1990s, she used the slice almost exclusively in baseline rallies and mostly limited the topspin backhand to passing shots. Her accuracy with the slice, both cross-court and down the line and her ability to skid the ball and keep it low, enabled her to use it as an offensive weapon to set the ball up for her forehand put-aways. However, Graf admitted in 1995 that she would have preferred having a two-handed backhand in retrospect.

She built her powerful and accurate serve up to , making it one of the fastest serves in women&#x27;s tennis and was a capable volleyer.

An exceptionally versatile competitor, Graf remains the only player, male or female, to have won the calendar-year Grand Slam on three surfaces or to have won each Grand Slam at least four times. Eighteen-time Grand Slam champion and former rival Chris Evert opined, &quot;Steffi Graf is the best all-around player. Martina [Navratilova] won more on fast courts and I won more on slow courts, but Steffi came along and won more titles on both surfaces.&quot; Her endurance and superior footwork allowed her to excel on clay courts, where, in addition to six French Open titles, she won 26 regular tour events, including a record eight titles at the German Open. Meanwhile, her naturally aggressive style of play, effective backhand slice and speed around the court made her even more dominant on fast surfaces such as hard courts, grass and carpet. Graf stated that grass was her favorite surface to play on, while clay was her least favorite.

==Equipment and endorsements==
Early in her career, Graf wore Dunlop apparel, before signing an endorsement contract with Adidas in 1985. She had an Adidas sneakers line known as the St. Graf Pro line. Early in her career, Graf used the Dunlop Maxpower Pro and Maxpower Kevlar racquets and then played with the Max 200G racquet from 1984 to 1993 before switching to Wilson from 1994 to 1999. She first used the Wilson Pro Staff 7.0 lite, then switched to the Pro Staff 7.5 in 1996 and to the Pro Staff 7.1 in 1998. Graf&#x27;s racquets were strung at 29 kilograms (64 pounds), significantly above the 50–60 pound range recommended by Wilson. In 2006, she signed an endorsement deal with Head. In 2010, Graf and Agassi collaborated with Head and developed the new line of Star Series tennis racquets.

Graf has signed many endorsement deals throughout the years including a ten-year endorsement deal with car manufacturer Opel in 1985, and Rexona from 1994 to 1998. Other companies she has endorsed include Barilla, Apollinaris, Citibank, Danone and Teekanne. She has appeared in many advertisements and television commercials with Andre Agassi including Canon Inc. and Longines in 2008 (Agassi became Longines ambassador in 2007). In 2015, she was appointed as the brand ambassador of Kerala tourism, for promoting Ayurveda in North America and Europe.

==Personal life==
In 1997, she left the Catholic Church, citing personal reasons. During her career, Graf divided her time between her hometown of Brühl; Boca Raton, Florida; and New York City, where she owned a penthouse in the former Police Headquarters Building in SoHo.

From 1992 to 1999, Graf dated racing driver Michael Bartels. She started dating Andre Agassi after the 1999 French Open, and they married on 22 October 2001, with only their mothers as witnesses. They have two children: a son, born in 2001; and a daughter, born in 2003. Agassi has said that he and Graf are not pushing their children toward becoming tennis players. The Graf-Agassi family resides in Summerlin, a community in the Las Vegas Valley. Graf&#x27;s mother and her brother also live there.

In 1991, the Steffi Graf Youth Tennis Center in Leipzig was dedicated to her. She is the founder, and chairperson, of &quot;Children for Tomorrow&quot;, a non-profit foundation established in 1998 for implementing and developing projects to support children that have been traumatized by war or other crises.

In 2001, Graf indicated that she preferred to be called &quot;Stefanie&quot; instead of &quot;Steffi&quot;.

==Legacy==
In December 1999, Graf was named the greatest female tennis player of the 20th century by a panel of experts assembled by the Associated Press. Graf was ranked as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s singles by the WTA for a record 377 weeks, and finished as the year-end No. 1 a record eight times, and she won 22 major women&#x27;s singles titles. Graf&#x27;s athletic ability and aggressive power game played from the baseline have been credited with developing the modern style of play that has come to dominate today&#x27;s game.

In the year of Graf&#x27;s retirement, Billie Jean King said, &quot;Steffi [Graf] is definitely the greatest women&#x27;s tennis player of all time.&quot; In March 2012, Tennis Channel picked Graf as the greatest female tennis player ever in their list of 100 greatest tennis players of all time. In November 2018, Tennis.com polled its readers to choose the greatest women&#x27;s tennis player of all time and Graf came in first. In December 1999, Graf was named the greatest female tennis player of the 20th century by a panel of experts assembled by the Associated Press. When asked in a 2016 interview to name the greatest players of all time, Serena Williams answered Graf and Roger Federer.

In July 2020, &quot;The Guardian&quot; polled its readers to determine the greatest female tennis player of the past 50 years, and Graf was the clear favorite, picking up nearly twice as many votes as any other player. Along with Boris Becker, Graf is considered instrumental in popularizing tennis in Germany, where it remains one of the foremost national sports. Tennis writer Steve Flink, in his book &quot;The Greatest Tennis Matches of the Twentieth Century&quot;, named Graf as the best female player of the 20th century. Flink said in 2020 that the jury was still out on (Serena) Williams as the greatest ever, but Williams&#x27; consistency over the long span did not match that of Graf or Navratilova.

==Awards and honours==
Graf was voted the ITF World Champion in 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1993, 1995 and 1996. She was voted the WTA Player of the Year in 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, a record 8 times. She was elected as the German Sportsperson of the Year in 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989 and 1999. Her unprecedented Golden Slam saw her receive the 1988 BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year.

In 2004, the &quot;Berliner Tennis-Arena&quot; was renamed &quot;Steffi-Graf-Stadion&quot; in honor of Graf.

Graf was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2004 and the German Sports Hall of Fame in 2008.

In 2015, Graf was the recipient of the International Club&#x27;s Jean Borotra Sportsmanship Award.

In 2022, Graf was an honoree by the Carnegie Corporation of New York&#x27;s Great Immigrant Award.

<text>Armistead Jones Maupin, Jr. ( ; born May 13, 1944) is an American writer notable for &quot;Tales of the City&quot;, a series of novels set in San Francisco.

==Early life==
Maupin was born in Washington, D.C., to Diana Jane (Barton) and Armistead Jones Maupin. His great-great-grandfather, Congressman Lawrence O&#x27;Bryan Branch, was from North Carolina and was a railroad executive and a Confederate general during the American Civil War. His father, Armistead Jones Maupin, founded Maupin, Taylor &amp; Ellis, one of the largest law firms in North Carolina. Maupin was raised in Raleigh.

Maupin attended Ravenscroft School and graduated from Needham Broughton High School in 1962. He attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he wrote for &quot;The Daily Tar Heel.&quot;

==Career==
Maupin worked at WRAL-TV in Raleigh, a station managed by future U.S. Senator Jesse Helms. Helms nominated Maupin for a patriotic award, which Maupin won. Maupin said he was a typical conservative and segregationist at this time and admired Helms as a hero figure. Maupin later changed his opinion and condemned Helms at a gay pride parade on the steps of the North Carolina State Capitol. Maupin is a veteran of the U.S. Navy and served several tours of duty including one in the Vietnam War.

Maupin worked at a Charleston newspaper and the San Francisco bureau of the &quot;Associated Press&quot; in 1971. In 1974, he began what would become the &quot;Tales of the City&quot; series as a serial in a Marin County-based newspaper, the &quot;Pacific Sun,&quot; moving to the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; after the &quot;Sun&quot; San Francisco edition folded.

In 1978, Maupin publicly accused San Francisco Police Inspector Dave Toschi of faking one of the Zodiac Killer&#x27;s taunting letters to the media, seriously and irreparably damaging Toschi&#x27;s career and reputation. Maupin claimed to have noticed a similarity between anonymous fan mail Toschi had sent him after Maupin based one of his &quot;Tales of the City&quot; characters on him, and a Zodiac letter received by the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; on April 24, 1978. Although the USPS crime lab cleared Toschi of being the Zodiac letter&#x27;s author, Toschi admitted to writing the fan mail and was removed from the case, destroying his chances of succeeding Charles Gain as chief of the San Francisco PD. The incident is portrayed in the 2007 David Fincher film &quot;Zodiac&quot;.

===&quot;Tales of the City&quot;===

&quot;Tales of the City&quot; is a series of novels, the first portions of which were published initially as a newspaper serial starting on August 8, 1974, in a Marin County newspaper, &quot;The Pacific Sun&quot;, picked up in 1976 by the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, and later reworked into the series of books published by HarperCollins (then Harper and Row). The first of Maupin&#x27;s novels, entitled &quot;Tales of the City&quot;, was published in 1978. Five more followed in the 1980s, ending with the last book, &quot;Sure of You&quot;, in 1989.

A seventh novel published in 2007, &quot;Michael Tolliver Lives&quot;, continues the story of some of the characters. It was followed by an eighth volume, &quot;Mary Ann in Autumn&quot;, published in 2010 and a ninth volume, &quot;The Days of Anna Madrigal&quot;, in 2014. In &quot;Babycakes&quot;, published in 1984, Maupin was one of the first writers to address the subject of AIDS. Of the autobiographical nature of the characters, he says &quot;I&#x27;ve always been all of the characters in one way or another.&quot;

The &quot;Tales of the City&quot; books have been translated into ten languages, and there are more than six million copies in print. Several of the books have been adapted and broadcast on BBC Radio 4.

====Television miniseries====
The first three books in the series have also been adapted into three television miniseries starring Olympia Dukakis and Laura Linney. A co-production with the UK&#x27;s Channel 4, the first miniseries was on PBS; subsequent miniseries appeared on Showtime. Dukakis, Linney, and various other cast members from the original series, reunited for the 2019 &quot;Tales&quot; miniseries on Netflix which was not based directly on one of Maupin&#x27;s novels but used elements from several, including the latter three.

====Musical projects====
He collaborated on &quot;Anna Madrigal Remembers&quot;, a musical work written by Jake Heggie and performed by choir Chanticleer and mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade on August 6, 1999, for which Maupin provided a new libretto. He also participated in a concert series with the Seattle Men&#x27;s Chorus entitled &quot;Tunes From Tales (Music for Mouse)&quot;, which included readings from his books and music from the era.

In May 2011, a theatrical musical version of &quot;Tales of the City&quot; had its premiere at American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. The musical has a score and lyrics by Jake Shears and John Garden of the rock band Scissor Sisters, and a book by Jeff Whitty. It was directed by Jason Moore.

===&quot;Maybe the Moon&quot; and &quot;The Night Listener&quot;===
Maupin wrote two novels, &quot;Maybe The Moon&quot; and &quot;The Night Listener&quot;, which are not part of &quot;Tales&quot;.

&quot;Maybe The Moon&quot; is a story Maupin describes as &quot;partly autobiographical&quot;, despite the main character being a female heterosexual Jewish dwarf. The character was also based on his friend Tamara De Treaux, who played the title character in the 1982 film &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;.

&quot;The Night Listener&quot; is a roman à clef, inspired by Maupin&#x27;s experiences concerning the Anthony Godby Johnson hoax. He says he wanted to create a psychological thriller, while being able to put autobiographical elements in it. The issues he addresses include the ending of his relationship with his long-term partner and his relationship with his father. The book very lightly references the &quot;Tales&quot; world via Gabriel Noone&#x27;s assistant, who is one of DeDe Halcyon-Day&#x27;s twins from &quot;Tales&quot;. It was serialized on the internet, on Salon.com, prior to its print publication. &quot;The Night Listener&quot; was adapted into a movie that was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in late January 2006 and released by Miramax the following August.

===&quot;Michael Tolliver Lives&quot;===
Prior to the 2007 release of &quot;Michael Tolliver Lives&quot;, Maupin had been quoted on his website as saying that another &quot;Tales of the City&quot; novel was unlikely. Although Maupin originally stated that this novel was &quot;NOT a sequel to &quot;Tales [of the City]&quot; and it&#x27;s certainly not Book 7 in the series,&quot; he later conceded that &quot;I&#x27;ve stopped denying that this is book seven in &quot;Tales of the City&quot;, as it clearly is ... I suppose I didn&#x27;t want people to be thrown by the change in the format, as this is a first person novel unlike the third person format of the &quot;Tales of the City&quot; books and it&#x27;s about one character who interrelates with other characters. Having said that, it is still very much a continuation of the saga and I think I realised it was very much time for me to come back to this territory.&quot;

The novel is written from the first-person perspective of &quot;Tales&quot; character Michael &#x27;Mouse&#x27; Tolliver, now in his fifties and living as an HIV-positive man. It also features appearances by familiar &quot;Tales&quot; characters, such as Anna Madrigal. Maupin said: &quot;I was interested in pursuing the life of an aging gay man, and Michael was the perfect vehicle ... However, as soon as I started writing, I found that, one by one, all the other characters stepped forward and asked to be present. It felt natural, so I went with it.&quot; He calls it &quot;a smaller, more personal novel than I&#x27;ve written in the past.&quot; The book was released on June 12, 2007, which was declared &#x27;Michael Tolliver Day&#x27; by the mayor of San Francisco.

&quot;Mary Ann in Autumn&quot; was published November 12, 2010 by Harper/HarperCollins, continuing the series. It was reviewed by Joseph Salvatore in the &quot;New York Times&quot; Sunday Book Reviews on November 14. It was followed in January 2014 by &quot;The Days of Anna Madrigal&quot;, which Maupin said would be the final novel in the series.

==Personal life==

Maupin has stated that he recognized his sexual orientation as gay from a young age, although he did not engage in sexual activity until he was 25, and decided to come out in 1974. For 12 years, he was in a relationship with Terry Anderson, a gay rights activist who co-authored the screenplay for &quot;The Night Listener&quot;. The couple lived together in both San Francisco and New Zealand.

After his breakup with Anderson, Maupin married Christopher Turner, a website producer and photographer, whom he met through a dating website. The couple was married in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on February 18, 2007. In 2012, Maupin purchased a home in Tesuque, New Mexico, previously owned by shoe designers Lynne and Dennis Comeau. In 2019, Maupin and Turner relocated to London, settling in Clapham. In November 2023, Maupin became a British citizen.

Maupin&#x27;s life and work are explored in the documentary &quot;The Untold Tales of Armistead Maupin&quot;. Early in his career, he was mentored by writer Christopher Isherwood, who had a significant influence on his writing. Maupin identifies as an atheist and is related to English singer Sarah Jane Morris.

<text>Lytta vesicatoria, also known as the Spanish fly, is an aposematic emerald-green beetle in the blister beetle family (Meloidae). It is distributed across Eurasia.

The species and others in its family were used in traditional apothecary preparations as &quot;Cantharides&quot;. The insect is the source of the terpenoid cantharidin, a toxic blistering agent once used as an exfoliating agent, anti-rheumatic drug and an aphrodisiac. The substance has also found culinary use in some blends of the North African spice mix &quot;ras el hanout&quot;. Its various supposed benefits have been responsible for accidental poisonings.

== Etymology and taxonomy ==

The generic name is from the Greek λύττα (&quot;lytta&quot;), meaning martial rage, raging madness, Bacchic frenzy, or rabies. The specific name is derived from Latin &quot;vesica&quot;, blister.

&quot;Lytta vesicatoria&quot; was formerly named &quot;Cantharis vesicatoria&quot;, although the genus &quot;Cantharis&quot; is in an unrelated family, Cantharidae, the soldier beetles. It was classified there erroneously until the Danish zoologist Johan Christian Fabricius corrected its name in his &quot;Systema entomologiae&quot; in 1775. He reclassified the Spanish fly as the type species of the new genus &quot;Lytta&quot;, in the family Meloidae.

== Description and ecology ==

The adult Spanish fly is a slender, soft-bodied metallic and iridescent golden-green insect, one of the blister beetles. It is approximately wide by long.

The female lays her fertilised eggs on the ground, near the nest of a ground-nesting solitary bee. The larvae are very active as soon as they hatch. They climb a flowering plant and await the arrival of a solitary bee. They hook themselves on to the bee using the three claws on their legs that give the first instar larvae their name, triungulins (from Latin &quot;tri&quot;, three, and &quot;ungulus&quot;, claw). The bee carries the larvae back to its nest, where they feed on bee larvae and the bees&#x27; food supplies. The larvae are thus somewhere between predators and parasites. The active larvae moult into very different, more typically scarabaeoid larvae for the remaining two or more instars, in a development type called hypermetamorphosis. The adults emerge from the bees&#x27; nest and fly to the woody plants on which they feed.

The defensive chemical cantharidin, for which the beetle is known, is synthesised only by males; females obtain it from males during mating, as the spermatophore contains some. This may be a nuptial gift, increasing the value of mating to the female, and thus increasing the male&#x27;s reproductive fitness. Zoologists note that the conspicuous coloration, the presence of a powerful toxin, and the adults&#x27; aggregating behaviour in full view of any predators strongly suggest aposematism among the blistering meloid beetles.

== Range and habitat ==

The Spanish fly is found across Eurasia, though it is a mainly a southern European species, with some records from southern Great Britain and Poland.

Adult beetles primarily feed on leaves of ash, lilac, amur privet, honeysuckle and white willow. It is occasionally found on plum, rose, and elm.

== Interaction with humans ==

=== Preparation of cantharidin ===


Cantharidin, the principal active component in preparations of Spanish fly, was first isolated and named in 1810 by the French chemist Pierre Robiquet, who demonstrated that it was the principal agent responsible for the aggressively blistering properties of this insect&#x27;s egg coating. It was asserted at that time that it was as toxic as the most violent poisons then known, such as strychnine.

Each beetle contains some 0.2–0.7 mg of cantharidin, males having significantly more than females. The beetle secretes the agent orally, and exudes it from its joints as a milky fluid. The potency of the insect as a blistering agent has been known since antiquity and the activity has been used in various ways. This has led to its small-scale commercial preparation and sale, in a powdered form known as &quot;cantharides&quot; (from the plural of Greek κανθαρίς, &quot;Kantharis&quot;, beetle), obtained from dried and ground beetles. The crushed powder is of yellow-brown to brown-olive color with iridescent reflections, is of disagreeable scent, and is bitter to taste. Cantharidin, the active agent, is a terpenoid, and is produced by some other insects, such as &quot;Epicauta immaculata&quot;.

=== Toxicity and poisonings===

Cantharidin is dangerously toxic, inhibiting the enzyme phosphatase 2A. It causes irritation, blistering, bleeding and discomfort. These effects can escalate to erosion and bleeding of mucosa in each system, sometimes followed by severe gastro-intestinal bleeding and acute tubular necrosis and glomerular destruction, resulting in gastro-intestinal and renal dysfunction, organ failure, and death.

Preparations of Spanish fly and its active agent have been implicated in both inadvertent and intentional poisonings. Arthur Kendrick Ford was imprisoned in 1954 for the unintended deaths of two women surreptitiously given candies laced with cantharidin, which he had intended to act as an aphrodisiac. It has been suggested that George Washington was treated with Spanish fly for epiglottitis, the condition which caused his death.

Currently the cantharidin in US, in the form of collodion, is used in the treatment of warts and molluscum.

=== Culinary uses ===

In Morocco and other parts of North Africa, spice blends known as &quot;ras el hanout&quot; sometimes included as a minor ingredient &quot;green metallic beetles&quot;, inferred to be &quot;L. vesicatoria&quot;, although its sale in Moroccan spice markets was banned in the 1990s. &quot;Dawamesk&quot;, a spread or jam made in North Africa and containing hashish, almond paste, pistachio nuts, sugar, orange or tamarind peel, cloves, and other various spices, occasionally included cantharides.

=== Other uses ===

In ancient China, the beetles were mixed with human excrement, arsenic, and wolfsbane to make the world&#x27;s first recorded stink bomb.

In ancient Greece and Rome, Spanish fly was used to attempt to treat skin diseases, while in medieval Persia, Islamic medicine applied Spanish fly, named &quot;ḏarārīḥ&quot; (ذراریـح), to attempt to prevent rabies.

In the 19th century, Spanish fly was used externally mainly as blistering agent and local irritant; also, in chronic gonorrhoea, paralysis, lepra, ulcers therapy. &quot;L. vesicatoria&quot; was used internally as a diuretic stimulant

An extract from Spanish fly was thought to be a strong aphrodisiac, and various love potions were named thusly.

<text>Albert Ghiorso (July 15, 1915 – December 26, 2010) was an American nuclear scientist and co-discoverer of a record 12 chemical elements on the periodic table. His research career spanned six decades, from the early 1940s to the late 1990s.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Ghiorso was born in Vallejo, California on July 15, 1915, of Italian and Spanish ancestry. He grew up in Alameda, California. Living near the Oakland International Airport, he became interested in airplanes, aeronautics, and other technologies. After graduating from high school, he built radio circuitry and earned a reputation for establishing radio contacts at distances that outdid the military.

He received his BS in electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 1937. After graduation, he worked for Reginald Tibbets, a prominent amateur radio operator who operated a business supplying radiation detectors to the government. Ghiorso&#x27;s ability to develop and produce these instruments, as well as a variety of electronic tasks, brought him into contact with the nuclear scientists at the University of California Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley, in particular Glenn Seaborg. During a job in which he was to install an intercom at the lab, he met two secretaries, one of whom, Helen Griggs, married Seaborg. The other, Wilma Belt, became Albert&#x27;s wife of 60+ years.

Ghiorso was raised in a devout Christian family, but later left the religion and became an atheist. However, he still identified with Christian ethics.

===Wartime research===
In the early 1940s, Seaborg moved to Chicago to work on the Manhattan Project. He invited Ghiorso to join him, and for the next four years Ghiorso developed sensitive instruments for detecting the radiation associated with nuclear decay, including spontaneous fission. One of Ghiorso&#x27;s breakthrough instruments was a 48-channel pulse height analyzer, which enabled him to identify the energy, and therefore the source, of the radiation. During this time they discovered two new elements (95, americium and 96, curium), although publication was withheld until after the war.

===New elements===
After the war, Seaborg and Ghiorso returned to Berkeley, where they and colleagues used the 60&quot; Crocker cyclotron to produce elements of increasing atomic number by bombarding exotic targets with helium ions. In experiments during 1949–1950, they produced and identified elements 97 (berkelium) and 98 (californium). In 1953, in a collaboration with Argonne Lab, Ghiorso and collaborators sought and found elements 99 (einsteinium) and 100 (fermium), identified by their characteristic radiation in dust collected by airplanes from the first thermonuclear explosion (the Mike test). In 1955, the group used the cyclotron to produce 17 atoms of element 101 (mendelevium), the first new element to be discovered atom-by-atom. The recoil technique invented by Ghiorso was crucial to obtaining an identifiable signal from individual atoms of the new element.

In the mid-1950s it became clear that to extend the periodic chart any further, a new accelerator would be needed, and the Berkeley Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator (HILAC) was built, with Ghiorso in charge. That machine was used in the discovery of elements 102–106 (102, nobelium; 103, lawrencium; 104, rutherfordium; 105, dubnium and 106, seaborgium), each produced and identified on the basis of only a few atoms. The discovery of each successive element was made possible by the development of innovative techniques in robotic target handling, fast chemistry, efficient radiation detectors, and computer data processing. The 1972 upgrade of the HILAC to the superHILAC provided higher intensity ion beams, which was crucial to producing enough new atoms to enable detection of element 106.

With increasing atomic number, the experimental difficulties of producing and identifying a new element increase significantly. In the 1970s and 1980s, resources for new element research at Berkeley were diminishing, but the GSI laboratory at Darmstadt, Germany, under the leadership of Peter Armbruster and with considerable resources, was able to produce and identify elements 107–109 (107, bohrium; 108, hassium and 109, meitnerium). In the early 1990s, the Berkeley and Darmstadt groups made a collaborative attempt to create element 110. Experiments at Berkeley were unsuccessful, but eventually elements 110–112 (110, darmstadtium; 111, roentgenium and 112, copernicium) were identified at the Darmstadt laboratory. Subsequent work at the JINR laboratory at Dubna, led by Yuri Oganessian and a Russian-American team of scientists, was successful in identifying elements 113–118 (113, nihonium; 114, flerovium; 115, moscovium; 116, livermorium; 117, tennessine and 118, oganesson), thereby completing the Period 7 elements of the periodic table of the elements.

===Inventions===
Ghiorso invented numerous techniques and machines for isolating and identifying heavy elements atom-by-atom. He is generally credited with implementing the multichannel analyzer and the technique of recoil to isolate reaction products, although both of these were significant extensions of previously understood concepts. His concept for a new type of accelerator, the Omnitron, is acknowledged to have been a brilliant advance that probably would have enabled the Berkeley lab to discover numerous additional new elements, but the machine was never built, a victim of the evolving political landscape of the 1970s in the U.S. that de-emphasized basic nuclear research and greatly expanded research on environmental, health, and safety issues. Partially as a result of the failure to build the Omnitron, Ghiorso (together with colleagues Bob Main and others) conceived the joining of the HILAC and the Bevatron, which he called the Bevalac. This combination machine, an ungainly articulation across the steep slope at the Rad Lab, provided heavy ions at GeV energies, thereby enabling development of two new fields of research: &quot;high-energy nuclear physics,&quot; meaning that the compound nucleus is sufficiently hot to exhibit collective dynamical effects, and heavy ion therapy, in which high-energy ions are used to irradiate tumors in cancer patients. Both of these fields have expanded into activities in many laboratories and clinics worldwide.

===Later life===
In his later years, Ghiorso continued research toward finding superheavy elements, fusion energy, and innovative electron beam sources. He was a non-participating co-author of the experiments in 1999 that gave evidence of elements 116 and 118, which later turned out to be a case of scientific fraud perpetrated by the first author, Victor Ninov. He also had brief research interests in the free quark experiment of William Fairbank of Stanford, in the discovery of element 43, and in the electron disk accelerator, among others.

===Legacy===
Albert Ghiorso is credited with having co-discovered the following elements:
* &quot;Americium&quot; ca. 1945 (element 95)
* &quot;Curium&quot; in 1944 (element 96)
* &quot;Berkelium&quot; in 1949 (element 97)
* &quot;Californium&quot; in 1950 (element 98)
* &quot;Einsteinium&quot; in 1952 (element 99)
* &quot;Fermium&quot; in 1953 (element 100)
* &quot;Mendelevium&quot; in 1955 (element 101)
* &quot;Nobelium&quot; in 1958–59 (element 102)
* &quot;Lawrencium&quot; in 1961 (element 103)
* &quot;Rutherfordium&quot; in 1969 (element 104)
* &quot;Dubnium&quot; in 1970 (element 105)
* &quot;Seaborgium&quot; in 1974 (element 106)
Ghiorso personally selected some of the names recommended by his group for the new elements. His original name for element 105 (hahnium) was changed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) to dubnium, to recognize the contributions of the laboratory at Dubna, Russia, in the search for trans-fermium elements. His recommendation for element 106, seaborgium, was accepted only after extensive debate about naming an element after a living person. In 1999, evidence for two superheavy elements (element 116 and element 118) was published by a group in Berkeley. The discovery group intended to propose the name &quot;ghiorsium&quot; for element 118, but eventually the data were found to have been tampered and in 2002 the claims were withdrawn. Ghiorso&#x27;s lifetime output comprised about 170 technical papers, most published in The Physical Review.

Ghiorso was famous among his colleagues for his endless stream of creative &quot;doodles,&quot; which define an art form suggestive of fractals. He also developed a state-of-the-art camera for birdwatching, and was a constant supporter of environmental causes and organizations.

Several obituaries are available online, and a full-length biography is in preparation.

<doc id="164646" wikidata="Q331563" url="?curid=164646" title="Transcendentalism">
<text>Transcendentalism is a philosophical, spiritual, and literary movement that developed in the late 1820s and 1830s in the New England region of the United States. A core belief is in the inherent goodness of people and nature, and while society and its institutions have corrupted the purity of the individual, people are at their best when truly &quot;self-reliant&quot; and independent. Transcendentalists saw divine experience inherent in the everyday. They thought of physical and spiritual phenomena as part of dynamic processes rather than discrete entities.

Transcendentalism is one of the first philosophical currents that emerged in the United States; it is therefore a key early point in the history of American philosophy. Emphasizing subjective intuition over objective empiricism, its adherents believe that individuals are capable of generating completely original insights with little attention and deference to past transcendentalists. Its rise was a protest against the general state of intellectualism and spirituality at the time. The doctrine of the Unitarian church as taught at Harvard Divinity School was closely related.

Transcendentalism emerged from &quot;English and German Romanticism, the Biblical criticism of Johann Gottfried Herder and Friedrich Schleiermacher, the skepticism of David Hume&quot;, and the transcendental philosophy of Immanuel Kant and German idealism. Perry Miller and Arthur Versluis regard Emanuel Swedenborg and Jakob Böhme as pervasive influences on transcendentalism.

==Origin==
Transcendentalism is closely related to Unitarianism, a religious movement in Boston in the early nineteenth century. It started to develop after Unitarianism took hold at Harvard University, following the elections of Henry Ware as the Hollis Professor of Divinity in 1805 and of John Thornton Kirkland as President in 1810. Transcendentalism was not a rejection of Unitarianism; rather, it developed as an organic consequence of the Unitarian emphasis on free conscience and the value of intellectual reason. The transcendentalists were not content with the sobriety, mildness, and calm rationalism of Unitarianism. Instead, they wanted a more intense spiritual experience. Thus, transcendentalism was not born as a counter-movement to Unitarianism, but as a parallel movement to the very ideas introduced by the Unitarians.

==Transcendental Club==

Transcendentalism became a coherent movement and a sacred organization with the founding of the Transcendental Club in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on September 12, 1836, by prominent New England intellectuals, including George Putnam, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Frederic Henry Hedge. Other members of the club included Sophia Ripley, Margaret Fuller, Elizabeth Peabody, Ellen Sturgis Hooper, Caroline Sturgis Tappan, Amos Bronson Alcott, Orestes Brownson, Theodore Parker, Henry David Thoreau, William Henry Channing, James Freeman Clarke, Christopher Pearse Cranch, Convers Francis, Sylvester Judd, Jones Very, and Charles Stearns Wheeler. From 1840, the group frequently published in their journal &quot;The Dial&quot;, along with other venues.

==Second wave of transcendentalists==

By the late 1840s, Emerson believed that the movement was dying out, and even more so after the death of Margaret Fuller in 1850. &quot;All that can be said&quot;, Emerson wrote, &quot;is that she represents an interesting hour and group in American cultivation.&quot; There was, however, a second wave of transcendentalists later in the 19th century, including Moncure Conway, Octavius Brooks Frothingham, Samuel Longfellow and Franklin Benjamin Sanborn. The transcendence of the spirit, most often evoked by the poet&#x27;s prosaic voice, is said to endow in the reader a sense of purpose. This is the underlying theme in the majority of transcendentalist essays and papers—all of which are centered on subjects which assert a love for individual expression. The group was mostly made up of struggling aesthetes, the wealthiest among them being Samuel Gray Ward, who, after a few contributions to &quot;The Dial&quot;, focused on his banking career.

==Beliefs==
Transcendentalists are strong believers in the power of the individual and are primarily concerned with personal freedom. Their beliefs are closely linked with those of the Romantics, but differ by an attempt to embrace or, at least, to not oppose the empiricism of science.
===Transcendental knowledge===
Transcendentalists desire to ground their religion and philosophy in principles based upon the German Romanticism of Johann Gottfried Herder and Friedrich Schleiermacher. Transcendentalism merged &quot;English and German Romanticism, the Biblical criticism of Herder and Schleiermacher, the skepticism of Hume&quot;, and the transcendental philosophy of Immanuel Kant (and of German idealism more generally), interpreting Kant&#x27;s &quot;a priori&quot; categories as &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge. Early transcendentalists were largely unacquainted with German philosophy in the original and relied primarily on the writings of Thomas Carlyle, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Victor Cousin, Germaine de Staël, and other English and French commentators for their knowledge of it. The transcendental movement can be described as an American outgrowth of English Romanticism.

===Individualism===
Transcendentalists believe that society and its institutions—particularly organized religion and political parties—corrupt the purity of the individual. They have faith that people are at their best when truly self-reliant and independent. It is only from such real individuals that true community can form.

Even with this necessary individuality, transcendentalists also believe that all people are outlets for the &quot;Over-Soul&quot;. Because the Over-Soul is one, this unites all people as one being. Emerson alludes to this concept in the introduction of the &quot;American Scholar&quot; address, &quot;that there is One Man, – present to all particular men only partially, or through one faculty; and that you must take the whole society to find the whole man&quot;. Such an ideal is in harmony with Transcendentalist individualism, as each person is empowered to behold within him or herself a piece of the divine Over-Soul.

In recent years, there has been a distinction made between individuality and individualism. Both advocate the unique capacity of the individual. Yet individualism is decidedly anti-government, whereas individuality sees all facets of society necessary, or at least acceptable for the development of the true individualistic person. Whether the Transcendentalists believed in individualism or individuality remains to be determined.

===Indian religions===
While firmly rooted in the western philosophical traditions of Platonism, Neoplatonism, and German idealism, Transcendentalism was also directly influenced by Indian religions. Thoreau in &quot;Walden&quot; spoke of the Transcendentalists&#x27; debt to Indian religions directly:
In 1844, the first English translation of the Lotus Sutra was included in &quot;The Dial&quot;, a publication of the New England Transcendentalists, translated from French by Elizabeth Palmer Peabody.

===Idealism===
Transcendentalists differ in their interpretations of the practical aims of will. Some adherents link it with utopian social change; Brownson, for example, connected it with early socialism, but others consider it an exclusively individualist and idealist project. Emerson believed the latter. In his 1842 lecture &quot;The Transcendentalist&quot;, he suggested that the goal of a purely transcendental outlook on life was impossible to attain in practice: 
=== Importance of nature ===
Transcendentalists have a deep gratitude and appreciation for nature, not only for aesthetic purposes, but also as a tool to observe and understand the structured inner workings of the natural world. Emerson emphasizes the Transcendental beliefs in the holistic power of the natural landscape in &quot;Nature:&quot;In the woods, we return to reason and faith. There I feel that nothing can befall me in life, – no disgrace, no calamity, (leaving me my eyes,) which nature cannot repair. Standing on the bare ground, – my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite space, – all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or particle of God.
Influenced by Emerson and the importance of nature, Charles Stearns Wheeler built a shanty at Flint&#x27;s Pond in 1836. Considered the first Transcendentalist outdoor living experiment, Wheeler used his shanty during his summer vacations from Harvard from 1836 to 1842. Thoreau stayed at Wheeler&#x27;s shanty for six weeks during the summer of 1837, and got the idea that he wanted to build his own cabin (later realized at Walden in 1845). The exact location of the Wheeler shanty site was discovered by Jeff Craig in 2018, after a five-year search effort.
The conservation of an undisturbed natural world is also extremely important to the Transcendentalists. The idealism that is a core belief of Transcendentalism results in an inherent skepticism of capitalism, westward expansion, and industrialization. As early as 1843, in &quot;Summer on the Lakes,&quot; Margaret Fuller noted that &quot;the noble trees are gone already from this island to feed this caldron&quot;, and in 1854, in &quot;Walden,&quot; Thoreau regarded the trains being built across America&#x27;s landscape as a &quot;winged horse or fiery dragon&quot; that &quot;sprinkle[d] all the restless men and floating merchandise in the country for seed&quot;.

==Influence on other movements==

Transcendentalism is, in many aspects, the first notable American intellectual movement. It has inspired succeeding generations of American intellectuals, as well as some literary movements.

Transcendentalism influenced the growing movement of &quot;Mental Sciences&quot; of the mid-19th century, which would later become known as the New Thought movement. New Thought considers Emerson its intellectual father. Emma Curtis Hopkins (&quot;the teacher of teachers&quot;), Ernest Holmes (founder of Religious Science), Charles and Myrtle Fillmore (founders of Unity), and Malinda Cramer and Nona L. Brooks (founders of Divine Science) were all greatly influenced by Transcendentalism.

Transcendentalism is also influenced by Hinduism. Ram Mohan Roy (1772–1833), the founder of the Brahmo Samaj, rejected Hindu mythology, but also the Christian trinity. He found that Unitarianism came closest to true Christianity, and had a strong sympathy for the Unitarians, who were closely connected to the Transcendentalists. Ram Mohan Roy founded a missionary committee in Calcutta, and in 1828 asked for support for missionary activities from the American Unitarians. By 1829, Roy had abandoned the Unitarian Committee, but after Roy&#x27;s death, the Brahmo Samaj kept close ties to the Unitarian Church, who strove towards a rational faith, social reform, and the joining of these two in a renewed religion. Its theology was called &quot;neo-Vedanta&quot; by Christian commentators, and has been highly influential in the modern popular understanding of Hinduism, but also of modern western spirituality, which re-imported the Unitarian influences in the disguise of the seemingly age-old Neo-Vedanta.

==Major figures==

Major figures in the transcendentalist movement were Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Margaret Fuller, and Amos Bronson Alcott. Some other prominent transcendentalists included Louisa May Alcott, Charles Timothy Brooks, Orestes Brownson, William Ellery Channing, William Henry Channing, James Freeman Clarke, Christopher Pearse Cranch, John Sullivan Dwight, Convers Francis, William Henry Furness, Frederic Henry Hedge, Sylvester Judd, Theodore Parker, Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, George Ripley, Thomas Treadwell Stone, Jones Very, and Walt Whitman.

== Criticism ==
Early in the movement&#x27;s history, the term &quot;transcendentalists&quot; was used as a term by critics, who were suggesting their position was beyond sanity and reason. Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote a novel, &quot;The Blithedale Romance&quot; (1852), satirizing the movement, and based it on his experiences at Brook Farm, a short-lived utopian community founded on transcendental principles.

In Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s satires &quot;How to Write a Blackwood Article&quot; (1838) and &quot;Never Bet the Devil Your Head&quot; (1841), the author ridicules transcendentalism, elsewhere calling its followers &quot;Frogpondians&quot; after the pond on Boston Common. The latter story specifically mentions the movement and its flagship journal &quot;The Dial&quot;, though Poe denied that he had any specific targets. Poe attacked the transcendentalist&#x27;s writings by calling them &quot;metaphor-run mad&quot;, lapsing into &quot;obscurity for obscurity&#x27;s sake&quot; or &quot;mysticism for mysticism&#x27;s sake&quot;. In Poe&#x27;s essay &quot;The Philosophy of Composition&quot; (1846), he offers criticism denouncing &quot;the excess of the suggested meaning... which turns into prose (and that of the very flattest kind) the so-called poetry of the so-called transcendentalists&quot;.

<doc id="164652" wikidata="Q166362" url="?curid=164652" title="Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm">
<text>&quot;&quot; is the national anthem of Estonia, originally adopted in 1920.

The lyrics were written by Johann Voldemar Jannsen and are set to a melody composed in 1848 by Fredrik Pacius, which is also that of the Finnish national anthem &quot;Maamme&quot;, then the unofficial anthem of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The only differences between the two anthems are their key signature and the repetition of the last four lines of each verse in the Finnish anthem. The melody is also used as an ethnic anthem of the Livonian people, titled &quot;Min izāmō&quot;.

==History==
The song was first presented to the public as a choral work in the Grand Song Festival of Estonia in 1869 and quickly became a symbol of the Estonian National Awakening.

&quot;Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm&quot; was officially adopted as the national anthem of Estonia in 1920, after the Estonian War of Independence.

In 1944, the Soviet Union occupied Estonia, and &quot;Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm&quot; was subsequently banned by the Soviet government. The Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic had its own official regional anthem. However, the Estonians could often hear their former national anthem, as Finland&#x27;s state broadcaster Yleisradio, whose radio and television broadcasts were received in northern Estonia, played an instrumental version of the Finnish national anthem, identical to this song (except for an additional repetition of the last verse in the Finnish version), at the conclusion of its broadcast every night.

<text>Physical restraint refers to means of purposely limiting or obstructing the freedom of a person&#x27;s or an animal&#x27;s bodily movement. 

==Basic methods==
Usually, binding objects such as handcuffs, legcuffs, ropes, chains, straps or straitjackets are used for this purpose.
Alternatively different kinds of arm locks deriving from unarmed combat methods or martial arts are used to restrain a person, which are predominantly used by trained police or correctional officers. This less commonly also extends to joint locks and pinning techniques.

==Purpose in humans==
Physical restraints are used:
* primarily by police and prison authorities to obstruct delinquents and prisoners from escaping or resisting British Police officers are authorised to use leg and arm restraints, if they have been instructed in their use. Guidelines set out by the Association of Chief Police Officers dictate that restraints are only to be used on subjects who are violent while being transported, restraining the use of their arms and legs, minimising the risk of punching and kicking. Pouches carrying restraints are usually carried on the duty belt, and in some cases carried in police vans.
* to enforce corporal punishment (typically a form of flagellation) by impeding motions of the target (usually prisoner), as is still practiced in penal functions of several countries
* by specially-trained teachers or teaching assistants to restrain children and teenagers with severe behavioral problems or disorders like autism or Tourette syndrome, to prevent hurting others or themselves
:# approximately 70% of teachers who work with students with behavioral disabilities use a type of physical restraint (Goldstein &amp; Brooks, 2007)
:# often used in emergency situations or for de-escalation purposes (Ryan &amp; Peterson, 2004)
:# many educators believe restraints are used to maintain the safety and order of the classroom and students, while those who oppose their use believe they are dangerous to the physical and mental health of children and may result in death (McAfee, Schwilk &amp; Miltruski, 2006) and (Kutz, 2009).
:# Individuals with Disabilities Education Act has stated that &quot;Restraints may not be used as an alternative to adequate staff&quot; (McAfee, Schwilk &amp; Miltruski, 2006, p. 713). Also, &quot;restraint may be used only when aggressive behavior interferes with an individual&#x27;s own ability to benefit from programming or poses physical threat to others&quot; (McAfee, Schwilk &amp; Miltruski, 2006, p. 713).
* by escapologists, illusionists and stunt performers
* to restrain people who are suffering from involuntary physical spasms, to prevent them from hurting themselves (see medical restraints)
* controversially, in psychiatric hospitals
:# restraints were developed during the 1700s by Philippe Pinel and performed with his assistant, Jean-Baptiste Pussin in hospitals in France
* by a kidnapper (stereotypically with rope or duct tape and a gag) or other material
* for eroticism

==Misuse and risks==
Restraining someone against their will is generally a crime in most jurisdictions, unless it is explicitly sanctioned by law. (See false arrest, false imprisonment).

Restraint has been misused in special education settings resulting in severe injury and trauma of students and lack of education from spending school hours restrained.

The misuse of physical restraint has resulted in many deaths.
Physical restraint can be dangerous, sometimes in unexpected ways. Examples include:
* postural asphyxia
* unintended strangulation
* death due to choking or vomiting and being unable to clear the airway
* death due to inability to escape in the event of fire or other disaster
* death due to dehydration or starvation due to the inability to escape
* cutting off of blood circulation by restraints
* nerve damage by restraints
* cutting of blood vessels by struggling against restraints, resulting in death by loss of blood
* death by hypothermia or hyperthermia whilst unable to escape
* death from deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism due to lack of movement

For these and many other reasons, extreme caution is needed in the use of physical restraint.

Gagging a restrained person is highly risky, as it involves a substantial risk of asphyxia, both from the gag itself, and also from choking or vomiting and being unable to clear the airway. In practice, simple gags do not restrict communication much; however, this means that gags that are effective enough to prevent communication are generally also potentially effective at restricting breathing. Gags that prevent communication may also prevent the communication of distress that might otherwise prevent injury.

===Medical restraints===

A survey in the US in 1998 reported an estimated 150 restraint related deaths in care environments (Weiss, 1998). Low frequency fatalities occur with some degree of regularity. An investigation of 45 restraint related deaths in US childcare settings showed 28 of these deaths were reported to have occurred in the prone position. In the UK restraint related deaths would appear to be reported less often. The evidence for effective staff training in the use of medical restraints is at best crude, with evaluation of training programmes being the exception rather than the rule. Vast numbers of care staff are trained in &#x27;physical interventions&#x27; including physical restraint, although they rarely employ them in practice. It is accepted that staff training in physical interventions can increase carer confidence.

====Japan====
Japanese law states that psychiatric hospitals may use restraints on patients only if there is a danger that the patients will harm themselves. The law also states that a designated psychiatrist must approve the use of restraints and examine the patient at least every 12 hours to determine whether the situation has changed and the patient should be removed from restraints.
However, in practice, Japanese psychiatric hospitals use restraints fairly often and for long periods. Despite being required to certify every 12 hours whether a patient still needs restraints, Japanese psychiatric hospitals keep patients in restraints for a much longer time than hospitals in other countries. According to a survey conducted on 689 patients in 11 psychiatric hospitals in Japan, the average time spent in physical restraints is 96 days. Meanwhile, the average time in most other developed countries is at most several hours to tens of hours.

The number of people who are physically restrained in Japanese psychiatric hospitals continues to increase. In 2014 more than 10,000 people were restrained-the highest ever recorded, and more than double the number a decade earlier. It is thought that some of that increase includes older patients with dementia. As a result, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has revised its guidelines for elderly people in nursing homes to have more restrictions against body restraints. The changes will take effect on 1 April 2018.

Deaths have been reported from their use, including that of Kelly Savage, an Assisted Language Teacher from New Zealand, in 2017.

====United Kingdom====
The Millfields Charter is an electronic charter which promotes an end to the teaching to frontline healthcare staff of all prone (face down) restraint holds. Despite a UK government statement in 2013 that it was minded to impose a ban on such techniques in mental health facilities, by 2017 the use of restraints in UK psychiatric facilities had increased.

Face down restraints are used more often on women and girls than on men. 51 out of 58 mental health trusts use restraints unnecessarily when other techniques would work. Organisations opposed to restraints include Mind and Rethink Mental Illness. YoungMinds and Agenda claim restraints are &quot;frightening and humiliating&quot; and &quot;re-traumatises&quot; patients especially women and girls who have previously been victims of physical and/or sexual abuse. The charities sent an open letter to health secretary, Jeremy Hunt showing evidence from &#x27;Agenda, the alliance for women and girls at risk&#x27;, revealing that patients are routinely restrained in some mental health units while others use non-physical ways to calm patients or stop self-harm. According to the letter over half of women with psychiatric problems have suffered abuse, restraint can cause physical harm, can frighten and humiliate the victim. Restraint, specially face down restraint can re-traumatise patients who previously suffered violence and abuse. &quot;Mental health units are meant to be caring, therapeutic environments, for people feeling at their most vulnerable, not places where physical force is routine&quot;.

Government guidelines state that face down restraint should not be used at all and other types of physical restraint are only for last resort. Research by Agenda found one fifth of women and girl patients in mental health units had suffered physical restraint. Some trusts averaged over twelve face down restraints per female patient. Over 6% of women, close to 2,000 were restrained face-down in total more than 4,000 times. The figures vary widely between regions.

Some trusts hardly use restraints, others use them routinely. A woman patient was in several hospitals and units at times for a decade with mental health issues, she said in some units she suffered restraints two or three times daily. Katharine Sacks-Jones director of Agenda, maintains trusts use restraint when alternatives would work. Sacks-Jones maintains women her group speak to repeatedly describe face down restraint as a traumatic experience. On occasions male nurses have used it when a woman did not want her medication. &quot;If you are a woman who has been sexually or physically abused, and mental health problems in women often have close links to violence and abuse, then a safer environment has to be just that: safe and not a re-traumatising experience. (...) Face-down restraint hurts, it is dangerous, and there are some big questions around why it is used more on women than men&quot;.

<doc id="164654" wikidata="Q374965" url="?curid=164654" title="Joseph B. Soloveitchik">
<text>Joseph Ber Soloveitchik ( &quot;Yosef Dov ha-Levi Soloveychik&quot;; February 27, 1903 – April 9, 1993) was a major American Orthodox rabbi, Talmudist, and modern Jewish philosopher. He was a scion of the Lithuanian Jewish Soloveitchik rabbinic dynasty.

As a &quot;rosh yeshiva&quot; of Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS) at Yeshiva University in New York City, The Rav, as he was known, ordained close to 2,000 rabbis over the course of almost half a century. Some Rabbinic literature, such as sefer &quot;Shiurei HaGrid&quot;, refers to him as הגרי&quot;ד, short for &quot;The great Rabbi Yosef Dov&quot;.

He is regarded as a seminal figure by Modern Orthodox Judaism and served as a guide and role-model for tens of thousands of Jews, both as a Talmudic scholar and as a religious leader.

Joseph Ber Soloveitchik was born on February 27, 1903, in Pruzhany, Imperial Russia (later Poland, now Belarus). He came from a rabbinical dynasty dating back some 200 years: His paternal grandfather was Chaim Soloveitchik, and his great-grandfather and namesake was Yosef Dov Soloveitchik, the &quot;Beis HaLevi&quot;. His great-great-grandfather was Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin (&quot;The Netziv&quot;), and his great-great-great-great grandfather was Chaim Volozhin. His father, Moshe Soloveichik (note different spelling of last name), preceded him as head of the RIETS rabbinical school at Yeshiva University.
On his maternal line, Soloveitchik was a grandson of Eliyahu Feinstein and his wife Guta Feinstein, née Davidovitch, who, in turn, was a descendant of a long line of Kapulyan rabbis, and of the Tosafot Yom Tov, the Shelah, the Maharshal, and Rashi. Rabbi Soloveitchik&#x27;s mother, Pesha, was a first cousin of Rav Moshe Feinstein.

==Early years, education, and immigration==
Soloveitchik was educated in the traditional manner at a Talmud Torah, an elementary yeshiva, and by private tutors, as his parents realized his great mental prowess. According to a curriculum vitae written and signed in his own hand, in 1922, he graduated from the liberal arts &quot;Gymnasium&quot; in Dubno. In 1924, he entered the Free Polish University in Warsaw, where he spent three terms, studying political science. In 1926, he came to Berlin, Germany, and entered the Friedrich Wilhelm University. He passed the examination for supplementary subjects at the German Institute for Studies by Foreigners, and was then given full matriculation at the University. He took up studies in philosophy, economics, and Hebrew subjects, simultaneously maintaining a rigorous schedule of intensive Talmud study.

According to the CV, among his &quot;highly honored&quot; teachers in university, bearing the title &quot;Geheimrat&quot; (literally: Privy Counselor), were Heinrich Maier and Professor Max Dessoir, along with Eugen Mittwoch and Professor Ludwig Bernhard]. He studied the work of European philosophers, and was a life-long student of neo-Kantian thought.

He wrote his Ph.D. thesis on the epistemology and metaphysics of the German philosopher Hermann Cohen.
Contrary to most biographies, which erroneously state that in 1931, he received his degree, he actually passed his oral doctor&#x27;s examination on July 24, 1930, but graduated with a doctorate only on December 19, 1932, as he had requested an extension to allow him to expand his thesis. Documents exist to support this assertion, located by Marc B. Shapiro in the University of Berlin archives.

In 1931, he married Tonya Lewit (1904-1967), who had earned a Ph.D. in Education from Jena University. Chaim Ozer Grodzinski officiated at their wedding in Vilna.

During his years in Berlin, Soloveitchik became a close disciple of Chaim Heller, who had established an institute for advanced Jewish Studies from an Orthodox perspective in the city. He also made the acquaintance of other young scholars pursuing a similar path to his own. One such figure was Yitzchak Hutner, who would become the rosh yeshiva of the Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin, also in Brooklyn, New York. Both of them developed a system of thought that bridged the Eastern European way of traditional scholarship with the new forces of modernity in the Western World. Among the other personalities with whom he came into contact were the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Professor Alexander Altmann, Yehiel Yaakov Weinberg, Rector of the Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary, and Professor Yeshayahu Leibowitz.

===Boston===
In 1932, Soloveitchik emigrated to America and settled in Boston, where he referred to himself as &quot;The Soloveitchik of Boston.&quot; 
In that year, he opened a yeshiva known as Heichal Rabbeinu Chaim HaLevi or the Boston Yeshivah. Initially it mainly served lay people and their children, but starting in 1939 it was augmented by advanced students and staff who had fled the outbreak of World War II in Europe.

Soloveitchik pioneered the Maimonides School, one of the first Hebrew day schools in Boston in 1937. When the school&#x27;s high school was founded in the late 1940s, he instituted a number of innovations in the curriculum, including teaching Talmud to boys and girls studying in classes together. He involved himself in all manner of religious issues in the Boston area. He was at times both a rabbinical supervisor of kosher slaughtering - &quot;shechita&quot; - and an educator, gladly accepting invitations to lecture in Jewish and religious philosophy at prestigious New England colleges and universities. Rabbi Soloveitchik was also the head of Boston&#x27;s Council of Orthodox Synagogues (also called the Vaad Ha&#x27;ir). His son-in-law, Isadore Twersky, was an internationally renowned expert on the writings of Maimonides, and succeeded Professor Harry Austryn Wolfson to the Nathan Littauer chair of Jewish History and Literature at Harvard University.

===New York===
Soloveitchik succeeded his father, Moses (Moshe) Soloveichik, as the head of the RIETS rabbinical school at Yeshiva University in 1941. He taught there until 1986, when illness kept him from continuing, and was considered the top Rosh Yeshiva (never, however, a formally recognized position at YU) from the time he began teaching there until his death in 1993. He was the first occupant of the Leib Merkin Distinguished Professorial Chair in Talmud and Jewish Philosophy at RIETS.

He ordained over 2,000 rabbis, many of whom are among the leaders of Orthodox Judaism and the Jewish people today. In addition, he gave public lectures that were attended by thousands from throughout the greater Jewish community, as well as regular classes at other New York institutions.

Soloveitchik advocated more intensive textual Torah study for Jewish women at the Stern College for Women, giving the first class in Talmud inaugurated at Stern College. He attracted and inspired many young men and women to become spiritual leaders and educators in Jewish communities worldwide. They, in turn, went out with the education of Yeshiva University to head synagogues, schools, and communities, where they continue to influence many Jews to remain - or become - committed to Orthodoxy and observance. Meir Kahane was highly influenced by his lectures.

==Philosophy and major works==
===&quot;Torah Umadda&quot; synthesis===
During his tenure at Yeshiva University, in addition to his Talmudic lectures, Soloveitchik deepened the system of &quot;synthesis&quot; whereby the best of religious Torah scholarship would be combined with the best secular scholarship in Western civilization. This later became known as the &quot;Torah Umadda&quot; - &quot;Torah and secular wisdom&quot; philosophy- the motto of Yeshiva University.

However, Rav Ahron Soloveichik disputes this claim, saying: &quot;That the Rav had a positive attitude toward worldly wisdom is beyond question. The same positive attitude towards worldly wisdom was expressed by all the Gedolei Yisrael from Rav Saadia Gaon up to the Gaon of Vilna. A talmid of the G&#x27;ra says in the translation of the Euclidean geometry that the G&#x27;ra had said &#x27;Ka&#x27;asher yechsar lo I&#x27;Adam yad achat b&#x27;Chochmat haolam kein yechseru lo meah yados baTorah.&#x27; If a person is deficient in worldly wisdom he will inescapably be deficient in one hundred measures in Torah wisdom. However, there is a great divergence between having a positive attitude towards worldly wisdom and being committed to mada. Being committed to mada implies a belief that mada is an ikar in life. My brother did not consider mada as an ikar in Yahadut. As a matter of fact my brother never in his lectures mentioned the expression Torah Umada; nor did he ever mention in his essays Ish Hahalacha and Ish Emunah. If anyone who has a positive attitude towards worldly wisdom tries to synthesize Torah with philosophy then Rav Saadiah Gaon, the Chovat Halevavot and the Rambam and the Gaon of Vilna were also attempting to synthesize the Torah with philosophy. Obviously such an allegation would reflect chutzpah and foolish nonsense.&quot; He argues that the Rav used his worldly knowledge to enhance his Torah and his teaching, but did not agree that Mada was Ikar that must be synthesized with Torah. (See below &quot;Debate over world view&quot; under &quot;Other views and controversy&quot; for more on this issue.)

Through public lectures, writings, and Soloveitchik&#x27;s policy decisions for the Modern Orthodox world, he strengthened the intellectual and ideological framework of Modern Orthodoxy.

In his major non-Talmudic publications, which altered the landscape of Jewish philosophy and Jewish theology, Soloveitchik stresses the normative and intellectual centrality of the halakhic corpus. He authored a number of essays and books offering a unique synthesis of Neo-Kantian existentialism and Jewish thought, the most well-known being &quot;The Lonely Man of Faith&quot; which deals with issues such as the willingness to stand alone in the face of monumental challenges, and &quot;Halakhic Man&quot;.
A less known essay, though not less important, is &quot;The Halakhic Mind - An essay on Jewish tradition and modern thought,&quot; written in 1944 and published only 40 years later, without any change, as the author himself stresses.

===&quot;The Lonely Man of Faith&quot;===

In &quot;The Lonely Man of Faith&quot;, Soloveitchik reads the first two chapters of Genesis as a contrast in the nature of the human being and identifies two human types: Adam I, or &quot;majestic man,&quot; who employs his creative faculties in order to master his environment; and Adam II, or &quot;covenantal man,&quot; who surrenders himself in submission to his Master. Soloveitchik describes how the man of faith integrates both of these aspects.

In the first chapter, Adam I is created together with Eve, and they are given the mandate to subdue nature, master the cosmos, and transform the world &quot;into a domain for their power and sovereignty.&quot; Adam I is &quot;majestic man&quot; who approaches the world and relationships—even with the divine—in functional, pragmatic terms. Adam I, created in the image of God, fulfills this apparently &quot;secular&quot; mandate by conquering the universe, imposing his knowledge, technology, and cultural institutions upon the world. The human community depicted in Genesis 1 is a utilitarian one, where man and woman join together, like the male and female of other animals, to further the ends of their species.

In chapter two of Genesis, Adam II, on the other hand represents the lonely man of faith - bringing a &quot;redemptive interpretation to the meaning of existence.&quot; Adam II does not subdue the garden, but rather tills it and preserves it. This type of human being is introduced by the words, &quot;It is not good for man to be alone&quot; - and through his sacrifice (of a metaphoric rib), he gains companionship and the relief of his existential loneliness - this covenantal community requires the participation of the Divine.

===&quot;Halakhic Man&quot;===
In &quot;Halakhic Man&quot;, Soloveitchik propounds the centrality of halakha in Jewish thought. His theological outlook is distinguished by a consistent focus on halakha, i. e., the fulfillment and study of the divine law. He presents the halakha as the &quot;a priori&quot; basis for religious practice and for the theological foundation for Jewish thought. Soloveitchik emphasizes halakha&#x27;s &quot;this-worldly, here-and-now grounding,&quot; as opposed to religious approaches that focus on the nature of the transcendent realm. This work argues that Jewish piety does not, therefore, fit familiar models of Western religiosity, and presents a phenomenology of this religious type. Here, &quot;Halakhic man,&quot; as a result of his study of Torah and his observance of the commandments, develops a set of coherent attitudes towards intellectual activity, asceticism, death, esotericism, mysticism, creativity, repentance, and providence. He also underscores the necessity for individual self-creation as the divinely assigned task of the human being.

&quot;Halakhic Man&quot; has become well read in the Orthodox Jewish community, but its psychology and model of Jewish law was rejected by most of non-Orthodox Judaism; one of the most prominent critiques is from Abraham Joshua Heschel, who wrote:

&quot;Ish Ha-halakhah? Lo haya velo nivra ela mashal haya!&quot; [Halakhic Man? Such a Jew has never existed!] Soloveitchik&#x27;s study, though brilliant, is based on the false notion that Judaism is a cold, logical affair with no room for piety. After all, the Torah does say &#x27;Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and soul and might&#x27;. No, there never was such a typology in Judaism as the halakhic man. There was - and is - an Ish Torah &quot;[Torah man]&quot; who combines halakhah and aggadah, but that is another matter altogether. When I came to Berlin I was shocked to hear my fellow students talking about the problem of halakha as a central issue. In Poland it had been a foreign expression to me. Halakhah is not an all-inclusive term, and to use it as such is to restrict Judaism. &#x27;Torah&#x27; is the more comprehensive word.

===&quot;Halakhic Mind&quot;===
&quot;Halakhic Mind&quot; is a four-part analysis of the historical correlation between science and philosophy. Only in its fourth and last part does the author introduce the consequences on the Halakha of the analysis performed in the previous three parts.

==Other views and controversy==
===Departure from the traditional Brisker view of Zionism===
Despite their religious disagreements, Soloveitchik was proud of his connections to the Soloveitchik rabbinic dynasty, speaking fondly of his &quot;uncle&quot; Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik (the &quot;Brisker Rov&quot;). To his relatives and namesakes who now lived in Jerusalem, where they had established their own branch of the Brisk Yeshiva, he was respected for his genius in Talmudic scholarship which few could challenge or disparage, despite their very differing views on Zionism (the &quot;Briskers&quot; in Jerusalem being staunch anti-Zionists). See the paragraph on &quot;Zionism&quot; below for a discussion of Soloveitchik&#x27;s Zionist viewpoint.
Recent research published by Shlomo Pick indicates that his father Moshe Soloveitchik maintained a close relationship with Religious Zionist (Mizrachi) circles in Warsaw, prior to the father&#x27;s departure for Yeshiva University and the son&#x27;s departure for the University of Berlin in 1923.

===Relations with Agudath Israel===
After Soloveitchik left Agudath Israel, the organization&#x27;s leadership was mostly quiet when it came to public statements involving Soloveitchik. Moshe Feinstein, who was Soloveitchik&#x27;s cousin, maintained very warm and profoundly respectful relations with him. They corresponded and spoke (at least) on the eve of every Jewish holiday. Yitzchak Hutner referred to him as a &quot;gadol&quot; (a foremost Torah scholar of the time). Aaron Kotler, whose public policy in relation to American Jewry was far more right-wing than Soloveitchik&#x27;s, was introduced by Soloveitchik at a Chinuch Atzmai dinner, and this later became famous as an instance of unity among the Orthodox leadership. Agudath Israel&#x27;s mouthpiece, the &quot;Jewish Observer&quot;, also mentioned Soloveitchik as one of the greatest rabbis of the generation when detailing a cable which was sent by various leading Rabbis to former Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol requesting the government to put a stop to Christian missionary activity in Israel. In May 1993, Nisson Wolpin penned an obituary for Soloveitchik in the &quot;Jewish Observer&quot;. The article was criticized for being a mere page long as instead of the &quot;Jewish Observer&#x27;s&quot; usually comparatively long obituaries, for the obituary not being mentioned in the table of contents, and portraying Soloveitchik as not clarifying his views enough. Moshe David Tendler, a son-in-law of Moshe Feinstein, wrote a scathing attack on Wolpin&#x27;s piece, which was published both in The Community Synagogue of Monsey&#x27;s newsletter and the &quot;Algemeiner Journal&quot;.

Soloveitchik did not sign Feinstein&#x27;s proposed ban on interfaith dialogue. Instead, he published a path-breaking essay expounding his views on the subject, entitled &quot;Confrontation.&quot; He also did not sign the ban by America&#x27;s foremost rabbis against participating in the Synagogue Council of America. It has been debated whether his refusal to sign was because he believed in participating in the SCA, or because he was not happy with the way the ban was instituted.

Despite the Agudah&#x27;s comparative silence on Soloveitchik and his stances, the &quot;Jewish Observer&quot; has often criticized the Rabbinical Council of America in which he served and his more modern students, including Rabbi Norman Lamm, Shlomo Riskin and Lawrence Kaplan.

===Relations with Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson===

Herschel Schacter, Sholem Kowalsky, Julius Berman; Menachem Genack, and Fabian Schoenfeld (all students of Soloveitchik) have asserted that Menachem Mendel Schneerson and Soloveitchik met for the first time while they both studied in Berlin. Soloveitchik told Kowalsky he &quot;was a great admirer of the Rebbe.&quot; Schoenfeld quoted Soloveitchik as having told him that when he was studying at the University of Berlin, &quot;I can testify that [Schneerson] never missed going to the mikva one single day.&quot;
In 1964, Soloveitchik paid a lengthy visit while Schneerson was mourning the death of his mother. Their conversation during this visit lasted approximately two hours. Soloveitchik later visited again following the death of Schneerson&#x27;s mother-in-law.
In 1980, accompanied by his student Herschel Schacter, Soloveitchik visited Schneerson at Chabad headquarters in Brooklyn on the occasion of a celebration marking the 30th anniversary of his leadership. The visit lasted close to two hours after which Soloveitchik told Schacter his opinion of Schneerson: &quot;He is a gaon (genius), he is a great one, he is a leader of Israel.&quot;

===Debate over world view===
Many of Soloveitchik&#x27;s students became leaders in the Modern Orthodox community. These students tend to espouse very distinct world views.

One of the most iconoclastic is David Hartman of Jerusalem, whose support for pluralism has gained him serious backing in non-Orthodox streams and who has brought Soloveitchik&#x27;s thinking to the non-Orthodox. The institution he founded, the Shalom Hartman Institute, is a home for serious thinkers from Orthodoxy, Conservative/Masorti, Reform and even secular scholars, and trains hundreds of Jewish community leaders annually. Avi Weiss and Saul Berman, who represent liberal Modern Orthodox institutions such as Yeshivat Chovevei Torah and Edah, are somewhat further to the right of Irving Greenberg, Riskin and Hartman, but still very liberal in comparison to most Orthodox thinkers (Weiss has classified this approach as &quot;Open Orthodoxy&quot;).

Many students of Soloveitchik represent a centrist approach to Modern Orthodoxy (which Lamm has coined &quot;Centrist Orthodoxy&quot;) such as Rabbis Aharon Lichtenstein, Benjamin Blech, Henry Hoschander, Lawrence Kaplan, and Norman Lamm. The &quot;Torah UMadda Journal&quot;, &quot;Tradition&quot; magazine, the Rabbinical Council of America, Efrat, Yeshiva University, Bnei Akiva, the Orthodox Union, and various post-high school yeshivot and seminaries in Israel (i.e. Yeshivat Hakotel and Yeshivat Har Etzion) are largely, if not mostly (but almost never monolithically) populated by &quot;Centrist Orthodox&quot; Jews.

Further to the right in the spectrum of Orthodoxy lie Rabbis Yehuda Parnes and Abba Bronspiegel, both of whom resigned from teaching positions in Yeshiva University to join right-wing alternative Lander College. A few of Soloveitchik students identify themselves and Soloveitchik&#x27;s teachings with the Haredi world, such as Moshe Meiselman, Soloveitchik&#x27;s nephew and Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshiva Toras Moshe in Jerusalem; Mosheh Twersky, one of Soloveitchik&#x27;s grandchildren and a teacher at Toras Moshe; Michel Shurkin, also a teacher at Toras Moshe. And Rabbi Chaim Ilson who had a Yeshiva called Yeshivas Derech Hatalmud.

====Integration with secular society====
Since his death, interpretations of Soloveitchik&#x27;s beliefs have become a matter of ongoing debate, somewhat analogous to the long-standing debate about Samson Raphael Hirsch. Some Haredim and some on the right wing of Modern Orthodoxy believe that Hirsch only wanted Jews to combine an observant Jewish lifestyle with learning the surrounding gentile society&#x27;s language, history, and science, so that a religious Jew could operate in the surrounding secular society. However, this is not a universally held opinion among right-wing Orthodox Jews (see, for example, the writings of Shimon Schwab and the biography of Hirsch by Eliyahu Klugman). Similarly, some scholars of Soloveitchik&#x27;s philosophy maintain that an eclectic pragmatic approach was adopted by Soloveitchik as well. According to this view, Soloveitchik did not approve of Jews learning secular philosophy, music, art, literature or ethics, unless it was for purposes of obtaining a livelihood or outreach.

In contrast, liberal leaning scholars believe that this understanding of Soloveitchik&#x27;s philosophy is misguided. This issue has been discussed in many articles in &quot;Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Thought&quot;, published by the Rabbinical Council of America. According to this view, Soloveitchik believed that it was permissible for Jews to learn secular philosophy, music, art, literature and ethics for their own sake and encouraged this.

Professor Yitzhak Twersky, a son-in-law of The Rav, pointed out in a eulogy published in the journal &quot;Tradition&quot; in 1996 that Soloveitchik&#x27;s philosophy could be paraphrased as follows: &quot;When you know your [Jewish] Way—your point of departure and goals—then use philosophy, science and the humanities to illumine your exposition, sharpen your categories, probe the profundities and subtleties of the &quot;masorah&quot; and reveal its charm and majesty; in so doing you should be able to command respect from the alienated and communicate with some who might otherwise be hostile or indifferent to your teaching as well as to increase the sensitivity and spirituality of the committed.&quot;

====Own criticism of his students====
Soloveitchik stated that although he felt that he successfully transmitted the facts and laws of Judaism to his students, he felt that he failed in transmitting the experience of living an authentic Jewish life. He stated that many of his students &quot;act like children, and experience religion like children. This is why they accept all types of fanaticism and superstition. Sometimes, they are even ready to do things that border on the immoral. They lack the experiential component of religion, and simply substitute obscurantism for it ... After all, I come from the ghetto. Yet, I have never seen so much naïve and uncritical commitment to people and to ideas as I see in America ... All extremism, fanaticism, and obscurantism come from a lack of security. A person who is secure cannot be an extremist.&quot; (&quot;A Reader&#x27;s Companion to Ish Ha-Halakhah: Introductory Section&quot;, David Shatz, Yeshiva University, Joseph B. Soloveitchik Institute).

====Revisionism====
Shortly after Soloveitchik&#x27;s passing, Lamm, in a eulogy for Soloveitchik delivered on April 25, 1993, urged his audience to &quot;guard ... against any revisionism, any attempts to misinterpret the Rav&#x27;s work in both worlds [the world of Torah and the world of Madda(Science)]. The Rav was not a lamdan who happened to have and use a smattering of general culture, and he was certainly not a philosopher who happened to be a talmid hakham, a Torah scholar ... We must accept him on his terms, as a highly complicated, profound, and broad-minded personality ... Certain burgeoning revisionisms may well attempt to disguise and distort the Rav&#x27;s uniqueness by trivializing one or the other aspect of his rich personality and work, but they must be confronted at once.&quot; (Lawrence Kaplan &quot;Revisionism and the Rav: The Struggle for the Soul of Modern Orthodoxy&quot;, Judaism, Summer, 1999).

===Relations with non-Orthodox Judaism===
Soloveitchik was a life-long critic of all forms of non-Orthodox Judaism, including Reform Judaism and Conservative Judaism. He believed that these denominations were in significant error where they differed from Orthodox Judaism. He compared religious dialogue with Reform and Conservative leaders to dialogue between Pharisees and Karaites, considering it ridiculous. One of the major differences was in regard to the mixed seating in the synagogue. Consistent with the traditional rabbinic understanding of this issue, Soloveitchik ruled that it was forbidden to pray in a synagogue without a separation between the sexes (mi-d&#x27;orayta, a Pentateuchal prohibition), and without the use of a mechitza, a divider between the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sections (mi-derabbenan, a rabbinical prohibition). The effect of this was to prohibit prayer in any Reform synagogue and in many Conservative synagogues. His responsum on this question was also directed at the small number of Orthodox synagogues that were adopting mixed-sex seating. He was vociferous on this issue.
Soloveitchik believed that Reform and Conservative rabbis did not have proper training in halakha and Jewish theology, and that due to their decisions and actions, they could not be considered rabbis, as Orthodox Jews traditionally understood the term. However, in practice, he sometimes granted non-Orthodox rabbis some degree of validity with respect to communal affairs (see examples below).

Soloveitchik developed the idea that Jews have historically been linked together by two distinct covenants. One is the &quot;brit yi&#x27;ud&quot;, &quot;covenant of destiny,&quot; which is the covenant by which Jews are bound together through their adherence to halakha. The second is the &quot;brit goral&quot;, &quot;covenant of fate,&quot; the desire and willingness to be part of a people chosen by God to live a sacred mission in the world, and the fact that all those who live in this covenant share the same fate of persecution and oppression, even if they do not live by halakha. Soloveitchik held that non-Orthodox Jews were in violation of the covenant of destiny, yet they are still bound together with Orthodox Jews in the covenant of fate.

In 1954 Soloveitchik issued a responsum on working with non-Orthodox Jews, &quot;Orthodox, Conservative and Reform Jews in the United States: Second article in a series on Responsa of Orthodox Judaism in the United States&quot;. The responsum recognized the leadership of non-Orthodox Jews in Jewish communal institutions (but not their rabbis in the Orthodox sense of the term), and concluded that participation with non-Orthodox Jews for political or welfare purposes is not only permissible, but obligatory.

The &quot;Council of Torah Sages&quot; of Agudath Yisroel countered with a ruling that such cooperation with non-Orthodox Jews was equivalent to endorsement of non-Orthodox Judaism, and thus was forbidden. In 1956 many Yeshiva leaders, including two rabbis from his own Yeshiva University, signed and issued a proclamation forbidding any rabbinical alumni of their yeshivot from joining with Reform or Conservative rabbis in professional organizations.

Soloveitchik declined to sign the proclamation, maintaining that there were areas, particularly those relating to problems that threatened all of Judaism, that required co-operation regardless of affiliation. His refusal emboldened other Modern Orthodox rabbis, and the Rabbinical Council of America and Union of Orthodox Congregations then joined the Synagogue Council of America, a group in which Orthodox, Reform and Conservative denominations worked together on common issues. (The Synagogue Council of America ceased operating in 1994.)

In the 1950s Soloveitchik and Saul Lieberman, in parallel with other members of the Rabbinical Council of America and Conservative Judaism&#x27;s Rabbinical Assembly, engaged in a series of private negotiations; their objective was to found a joint Orthodox-Conservative beth din that would be a national rabbinic court for all Jews in America; it would supervise communal standards of marriage and divorce. It was to be modeled after the Israeli Chief Rabbinate, with only Orthodox judges, but with the expectation that it would be accepted by the larger Conservative movement as legitimate. Conservative rabbis in the Rabbinical Assembly formed a &quot;Joint Conference on Jewish Law&quot; and devoted a year to the effort.

For a number of reasons, the project did not succeed. According to Orthodox Rabbi Bernstein, the major reason for its failure was that the Orthodox rabbis insisted that the Conservative Rabbinical Assembly expel some Conservative rabbis for actions they took before the new Beit Din was formed, and the RA refused to do so (Bernstein, 1977). According to Orthodox Rabbi Emanuel Rackman, former president of the RCA, the major reason for its failure was pressure from right-wing Orthodox rabbis, who held that any cooperation between Orthodoxy and Conservatism was forbidden. In an account prepared in 1956, Rabbi Harry Halpern of the Rabbinical Assembly&#x27;s &quot;Joint Conference&quot; wrote that negotiations between the Orthodox and Conservative were completed and agreed upon, but then a new requirement was demanded by the RCA: that the RA &quot;impose severe sanctions&quot; upon Conservative rabbis for actions they took before the new beth din was formed. The RA &quot;could not assent to rigorously disciplining our members at the behest of an outside group.&quot; Per Halpern, subsequent efforts were made to cooperate with the Orthodox, but a letter from eleven Rosh Yeshivas was circulated declaring that Orthodox rabbis were forbidden to cooperate with Conservative rabbis (&quot;Proceedings of the CJLS of the Conservative Movement 1927-1970&quot; Vol. II, pp. 850–852).

Until the 1950s, Jews of all denominations were generally allowed to use the same communal mikvaot (ritual baths) for the purposes of converting to Judaism, observing the rules of niddah in regard to laws of marital purity, ritually cleansing dishes, etc. However the Haredi movement increasingly denied the use of mikvaot to non-Orthodox rabbis for use in conversions. According to Walter Wurzburger, Soloveitchik counselled Orthodox rabbis against this practice, insisting that non-Orthodox have the option to use mikvaot (Wurzburger, 1994).

===Zionism===
Soloveitchik was the pre-eminent leader of politically conscious pro-Zionist modern Orthodox Judaism. Out of respect for his stature, many leaders and politicians from Israel sought his advice and blessings in state affairs. Reputedly, he was offered the position of Chief Rabbi of Israel by Prime Minister Ben Gurion but quietly declined. Despite his open and ardent support for the modern State of Israel, he only visited Israel once, in 1935, before the modern state was established. Yosef Blau has written that Soloveitchik&#x27;s non-messianic Zionism was philosophically similar to that of Yitzchak Yaacov Reines (see &quot;Tradition&quot; 33.2, Communications).

On Yom ha-Atzma&#x27;ut (Israel&#x27;s Independence Day), 1956, Soloveitchik delivered a public address at Yeshiva University entitled, &quot;Kol Dodi Dofek; The Voice of My Beloved Knocks.&quot; The address, which has become a classic of religious Zionist philosophy, enumerates and elaborates upon the instances of God&#x27;s tangible presence in the recent history of the Jewish people and the State of Israel. It also issues a clarion call to American Orthodoxy to embrace the State of Israel, and to commit itself and its resources to its development.

===Affiliated organizations===
In his early career in America, Soloveitchik joined with the traditional movements such as Agudath Israel of America and the &quot;Agudat Harabanim&quot; - the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of North America. In fact, Soloveitchik was on the first Moetzes Chachmei HaTorah of America. However, he later removed himself from the former organizations, and instead joined with the &quot;Mizrachi&quot; Religious Zionists of America (RZA) and became Chairman of the centrist Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America&#x27;s (RCA) Halakhah Commission (the other two members are the time were Rabbis and Samuel Belkin).

==Family and last years==
During the 1950s and 1960s, until his wife&#x27;s death in 1967, Soloveitchik and some of his students would spend summers near Cape Cod in Onset, Massachusetts, where they would pray at Congregation Beth Israel.

After the passing of his wife in 1967, Soloveitchik began giving additional lectures, open to the public, during the summer months in Boston.

Soloveitchik&#x27;s daughters married prominent academics and Talmudic scholars: his daughter Tovah married Aharon Lichtenstein, former Rosh Yeshiva at RIETS who made Aliyah to become Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivat Har Etzion in Israel; his daughter Atarah (died February 24, 2023) married Isadore Twersky, former head of the Jewish Studies department at Harvard University (who also served as the Talner Rebbe in Boston). His son Haym Soloveitchik is a University Professor of Jewish History at Yeshiva University. His siblings included Samuel Soloveichik (1909-1967), Ahron Soloveichik (1917-2001), Shulamith Meiselman (1912-2009), and Anne Gerber (1915-2011). His grandchildren have maintained his heritage and also hold distinguished scholarly positions, such as Mosheh Lichtenstein, Yitzchok Lichtenstein, Esti Rosenberg and Mayer Twersky.

As he got older he suffered several bouts of serious illness (Alzheimer&#x27;s disease preceded by Parkinson&#x27;s disease).

<text>Psittacus is a genus of African grey parrots in the subfamily Psittacinae. It contains two species: the grey parrot (&quot;Psittacus erithacus&quot;) and the Timneh parrot (&quot;Psittacus timneh&quot;).

For many years, the grey parrot and Timneh parrot were classified as subspecies; the former as the nominate, the latter as &quot;P. e. timneh&quot;. However, in 2012 the taxa were recognized as separate species by BirdLife International on the basis of genetic, morphological, plumage and vocal differences.

These parrots are found in the primary and secondary rainforest of West and Central Africa. They are among the most intelligent birds in the world. They feed primarily on palm nuts, seeds, fruits, and leafy matter, but have also been observed eating snails. Their inclination and ability to mimic speech and other sounds have made them popular pets.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Psittacus&quot; was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The genus name is Latin for &quot;parrot&quot;. Linnaeus included all 37 of the then-known parrots in the genus and of these George Robert Gray designated the grey parrot (&quot;Psittacus erithacus&quot;) as the type species.

===Species===
The genus now contains only two species:



Some aviculturalists recognize third and fourth species, but these are not distinguishable in scientific studies.

==Behavior and ecology==
===Breeding===
Grey parrots are monogamous breeders which nests in tree cavities. The hen lays 3-5 eggs, which she incubates for 30 days while being fed by her mate. Young leave the nest at the age of 12 weeks. Little is known about the courtship behaviour of this species in the wild.

===Longevity===

Like many large parrots, greys are long-lived birds. The Animal Ageing and Longevity Database states the longest reliably recorded longevity for the species in captivity as 49.7 years. Also acknowledged are claims of captive grey parrots reaching the ages of 73 and 93, whereas the World Parrot Trust lists a longevity of 50–60 years for a grey in captivity. The Guinness Book of World Records listed a grey parrot that allegedly lived in captivity for 72 years as the longest-lived specimen for the species.

===Illness and disease===

The grey parrot (&quot;Psittacus erithacus&quot;) has been known at times to contract a non-infectious inflammatory lung disease called lipid pneumonia. Lipid pneumonia can be classified as exogenous or endogenous depending on whether or not the animal inhaled outside material. A necropsy shows that the lungs of a grey parrot with endogenous lipid pneumonia (EnLP) are firm with a diffuse grey discoloration. EnLP is a common illness in other animals as well. The grey parrot is also one of the three parrots that scientists found to commonly suffer from dehydration. Scientists have used plasma osmolality to find more information about the form of dehydration grey parrots have. Another disease that the grey parrots get is cardiomyopathy, which is a heart disease usually presented at a young age. The cause is having parents of the same breed. Some other common symptoms in these birds are weakness, coelomic cavity, and retardation. The grey parrot has been known to contract beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) which causes a highly contagious, and sometimes fatal, psittacine beak and feather disease in parrots. In a PCR-based study, Chlamydiosis, an infectious disease of avians, was found to infect the grey parrot. In the study 253 clinical samples were taken from 27 bird species belonging to seven orders. Thirty-two (12.6%) samples were positive for Chlamydi and two new genotypes were discovered: &quot;Chlamydophila psittaci&quot; and &quot;Chlamydophila abortus&quot;.
Another ailment that grey parrots commonly suffer from is hypocalcemic-induced seizure activity. Birds between 2–15 years of age contract it, due to a lack of calcium. A symptom of the syndrome can be unsteadiness while standing or falling off a perch along with neurological anomalies or problems.

===Intelligence===


Unlike other parrots, wild greys have been documented imitating the calls of several other species.

Irene Pepperberg&#x27;s research with captive greys, most notably with a bird named Alex, has scientifically demonstrated that they possess the ability to associate simple human words with meanings, and to intelligently apply the abstract concepts of shape, colour, number, zero-sense, etc. According to Pepperberg and other ornithologists, they perform many cognitive tasks at the level of dolphins, chimpanzees, and even human toddlers. As well as labeling objects, Alex could verbally express what his wants were, suggesting that grey parrots know the difference between features and feelings. In general, it has been shown that grey parrots are able to learn relatively quickly, though they are limited to simple and non-abstract mediums of thinking. They have been shown to be able to make cognitive inferences, but, like apes, have inter-individual differences in intelligence. For example, in one experiment involving food hidden under cups, it was shown that greys can identify where the food is, usually if shown its original location at first.

Pet greys may learn to speak within their first year, but many don&#x27;t say their first word until 12–18 months old. Timnehs are generally observed to start speaking earlier, some in their late first year. Both subspecies seem to have the same ability and tendency to produce human speech, but vocal ability and proclivity may range widely among individual birds. Grey parrots tend to use more specific calls for different species coming their way which can be known as stimulus specificity, since there is a stimulus vocalization the birds have.

A study published in 2011, led by Dalila Bovet of Paris West University Nanterre La Défense, demonstrated grey parrots were able to coordinate and collaborate with each other to an extent. They were able to solve problems set by scientists—for example, two birds could pull strings at the same time to obtain food. In another example, one bird stood on a perch to release a food-laden tray, while the other pulled the tray out from the test apparatus. Both would then feed. The birds in question were observed waiting for their partners to perform the necessary actions so their behaviour could be synchronized. The parrots appeared to express individual preferences as to which of the other test birds they would work with.

In an experiment about local enhancement in grey parrots, food was visibly hidden under two separate cups. The experimenter then lifted the first cup and either removed what was under it or put it back. This was then done again in several different combinations, the cups were lifted in a different order and the food was removed or put back in a different order. Instead of remembering which cup had the food, the birds would show preference to the one that was touched last.
Another series of experiments further tested grey parrots&#x27; cognitive abilities. In general, most animals cannot associate sounds with objects, such as food, placed into a cup. While originally only the great apes and young human children were known to make this association with ease, it was found that grey parrots, under most conditions, can also associate sounds with the presence of an object. For the most part, grey parrots performed more successfully if the cup was shaken horizontally before it is given the choice of selecting which contained food; however, further experimentation indicated that it is not a requirement and proved that grey parrots have very high cognitive abilities.

=== Vocalisation ===
Wild grey parrots often whistle, click, or make other sounds. A grey&#x27;s owner should expect to hear regular renditions of microwave ovens, telephones, alarm clocks, video games, and other electronic sounds, as well as dripping water, wild birds, and any other sound often heard by the parrot. Greys have even been known to repeat the profanity they heard from an owner even after they no longer live with that owner. Greys also have the ability to mimic, and distinguish between, the different voices they hear. Grey parrots use different alarm calls for different predators coming their way.

In an experiment to test the vocalizations of grey parrots, four bred in captivity were placed in an aviary. Throughout the day they spent time in a room with toys and came into fairly regular contact with the humans taking care of them. The noises that these parrots could hear consisted of the calls of canaries in the laboratory, people cleaning, doors squeaking, etc. In the next 3 years, the parrots made over 50,000 vocalisations. What was interesting was that, although they were bred in captivity, the sounds they made were not only ones of their immediate surroundings. They also made calls similar to those of other captive grey parrots in different locations and even wild grey parrots.

==Status and conservation==

More rare than previously believed, the grey was uplisted from a species of least concern to near threatened in the 2007 IUCN Red List. A recent analysis suggests up to 21% of the global population may be taken from the wild annually, primarily for the pet trade. In 2012, the species was further uplisted to vulnerable. 
The species is endemic to primary and secondary rainforests of West and Central Africa. Grey parrots depend on large, old trees for the natural hollows they use for nesting. Studies in Guinea and Guinea-Bissau have found that greys&#x27; preferred species of nesting trees are also species preferred for timber. The relationship between the status of the species and the status of primary forest is positive: where the forests are declining, so too are populations of grey parrots.
The grey parrot is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This requires both that exports be accompanied by a permit issued by a national authority and that a finding be made that the export is not detrimental to the species in the wild. With exports totaling more than 350,000 specimens from 1994 to 2003, the grey parrot is one of the most heavily traded CITES-listed bird species. In response to continuing population declines, exceeded quotas, and unsustainable and illegal trade (including among range states), CITES included the grey parrot in Phase VI of the CITES Review of Significant Trade in 2004. This review has resulted in recommended zero export quotas for several range states and a CITES decision to develop regional management plans for the species.

In the United States, importation of wild-caught grey parrots is prohibited under the US Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992. In the European Union, an EU Directive of 2007 prevents importation of this and any other wild-caught birds for the pet trade.

==Relationship with humans==

===Aviculture===

These intelligent mimics can make interesting pets and companion parrots. They have a devoted following among parrot owners. However, the same qualities mean they require a special commitment by their owners to provide frequent one-on-one interaction and supervised time out of their cages. They must be kept stimulated and busy by people and toys or they may become stressed and develop self-destructive behaviors. Greys require large cages, varied diets that include fresh foods, and plenty of safe and chewable toys. If not provided with these items, these parrots can quickly develop unpleasant behaviours and may eventually develop health problems (such as feather-plucking) that are difficult to remedy.

Even the healthiest, happiest pet parrot will generate a fair amount of mess and noise. Like most parrots, they are not domesticated, and even a well-socialized, hand-raised, aviary-bred bird is usually only one or two generations removed from its wild predecessor. Despite this, there is a long history of these parrots being kept at pets by the ancient Greeks, wealthy Roman families, King Henry VIII, Portuguese sailors, and others.

<text>A jet aircraft (or simply jet) is an aircraft (nearly always a fixed-wing aircraft) propelled by one or more jet engines.

Whereas the engines in propeller-powered aircraft generally achieve their maximum efficiency at much lower speeds and altitudes, jet engines achieve maximum efficiency at speeds close to or even well above the speed of sound. Jet aircraft generally cruise most efficiently at about Mach 0.8 () and at altitudes around or more.

The idea of the jet engine was not new, but the technical problems involved did not begin to be solved until the 1930s. Frank Whittle, an English inventor and RAF officer, began development of a viable jet engine in 1928, and Hans von Ohain in Germany began work independently in the early 1930s. In August 1939 the turbojet powered Heinkel He 178, the world&#x27;s first jet aircraft, made its first flight. A wide range of different types of jet aircraft exist, both for civilian and military purposes.

==History==
After the first instance of powered flight, a large number of jet engine designs were suggested. René Lorin, Morize, Harris proposed systems for creating a jet efflux. 

After other jet engines had been run, Romanian inventor Henri Coandă claimed to have built a jet-powered aircraft in 1910, the Coandă-1910. However, to support this claim, he had to make substantial alterations to the drawings which he used to support his subsequently debunked claims. In fact the ducted-fan engine backfired, setting the aircraft on fire before any flights were ever made, and it lacked nearly all of the features necessary for a jet engine - including a lack of fuel injection, and any concern about hot jet efflux being directed at a highly flammable fabric surface.

During the 1920s and 1930s a number of approaches were tried. A variety of motorjet, turboprop, pulsejet and rocket powered aircraft were designed. Rocket-engine research was being carried out in Germany and the first aircraft to fly under rocket power was the Lippisch Ente, in 1928. The Ente had previously been flown as a glider. The next year, in 1929, the Opel RAK.1 became the first purpose-built rocket aircraft to fly.

The turbojet was invented in the 1930s, independently by Frank Whittle and later Hans von Ohain. The first turbojet aircraft to fly was the Heinkel He 178, on August 27, 1939 in Rostock (Germany), powered by von Ohain&#x27;s design. This was largely a proof of concept, as the problem of &quot;creep&quot; (metal fatigue caused by the high temperatures within the engine) had not been solved, and the engine quickly burned out. Von Ohain&#x27;s design, an axial-flow engine, as opposed to Whittle&#x27;s centrifugal flow engine, was eventually adopted by most manufacturers by the 1950s. 

The first flight of a jet-propelled aircraft to come to public attention was the Italian Caproni Campini N.1 motorjet prototype which flew on August 27, 1940. It was the first jet aircraft recognised by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (at the time the German He 178 program was still kept secret). Campini began development of the motorjet in 1932; it differed from a true turbojet in that the turbine was driven by a piston engine, rather than combustion of the turbine gases - which was a much more complex solution.
The British experimental Gloster E.28/39 first flew on May 15, 1941, powered by Sir Frank Whittle&#x27;s turbojet. The United States Bell XP-59A flew on October 1, 1942, using two examples of a version of the Whittle engine built by General Electric. The Meteor was the first production jet, with the first orders for production examples being made on 8 August 1941, the prototype first flying on 5 March 1943 and the first production aircraft flying on 12 January 1944, while the first orders for production Me 262 aircraft were not issued until 25 May 1943, and the first production Me 262 did not fly until 28 March 1944 despite the Me 262 program having started earlier than that of the Meteor, as Projekt 1065, with initial plans drawn up by Waldemar Voigt&#x27;s design team in April 1939.

The Messerschmitt Me 262 was the first operational jet fighter, manufactured by Germany during World War II and entering service on 19 April 1944 with &quot;Erprobungskommando 262&quot; at Lechfeld just south of Augsburg. An Me 262 scored the first combat victory for a jet fighter on 26 July 1944, the day before the British Gloster Meteor entered operational service. The Me 262 had first flown on April 18, 1941, but mass production did not start until early 1944, with the first squadrons operational that year, too late for any effect on the outcome of the World War II. While only around 15 Meteors were operational during WW2, up to 1,400 Me 262 were produced, with 300 entering combat. Only the rocket-propelled Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet was a faster operational aircraft during the war.

Around this time, mid 1944, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Meteor was being used for defence of the UK against the V-1 flying bomb – the V-1 itself a pulsejet-powered aircraft and direct ancestor of the cruise missile – and then ground-attack operations over Europe in the last months of the war. In 1944 Germany introduced the Arado Ar 234 jet reconnaissance and bomber aircraft into service, though chiefly used in the former role, with the Heinkel He 162 &quot;Spatz&quot; single-jet light fighter appearing at the end of 1944. USSR tested its own Bereznyak-Isayev BI-1 in 1942, but the project was scrapped by leader Joseph Stalin in 1945. The Imperial Japanese Navy also developed jet aircraft in 1945, including the Nakajima J9Y Kikka, a modified, and slightly smaller version of the Me 262 that had folding wings. By the end of 1945, the US had introduced their first jet fighter, the Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star into service and the UK its second fighter design, the de Havilland Vampire.

The US introduced the North American B-45 Tornado, their first jet bomber, into service in 1948. It was capable of carrying nuclear weapons, but was used for reconnaissance over Korea. On November 8, 1950, during the Korean War, United States Air Force Lt. Russell J. Brown, flying in an F-80, intercepted two North Korean MiG-15s near the Yalu River and shot them down in the first jet-to-jet dogfight in history. The UK put the English Electric Canberra into service in 1951 as a light bomber. It was designed to fly higher and faster than any interceptor.

BOAC operated the first commercial jet service, from London to Johannesburg, in 1952 with the de Havilland Comet jetliner. This highly innovative aircraft travelled far faster and higher than propeller aircraft, was much quieter, smoother, and had stylish blended wings containing hidden jet engines. However, due to a design defect, and use of aluminium alloys, the aircraft suffered catastrophic metal fatigue which led to several crashes, which gave time for the Boeing 707 to enter service in 1958 and thus to dominate the market for civilian airliners. The underslung engines were found to be advantageous in the event of a propellant leak, and so the 707 looked rather different from the Comet: the 707 has a shape that is effectively the same as that of contemporary aircraft, with marked commonality still evident today for example with the 737 (fuselage) and A340 (single deck, swept wing, four below-wing engines).

Turbofan aircraft with far greater fuel efficiency began entering service in the 1950s and 1960s, and became the most commonly used type of jet.

The Tu-144 supersonic transport was the fastest commercial jet aircraft at Mach 2.35 (). It went into service in 1975, but was withdrawn from commercial service shortly afterwards. The Mach 2 Concorde entered service in 1976 and flew for 27 years.

The fastest military jet aircraft was the SR-71 Blackbird at Mach 3.35 ().

==Other jets==

Most people use the term &#x27;jet aircraft&#x27; to denote gas turbine based airbreathing jet engines, but rockets and scramjets are both also propelled by jet propulsion.

Cruise missiles are single-use unmanned jet aircraft, powered predominantly by ramjets or turbojets or sometimes turbofans, but they will often have a rocket propulsion system for initial propulsion.

The fastest airbreathing jet aircraft is the unmanned X-43 scramjet at around Mach 9–10.

The fastest manned (rocket) aircraft is the X-15 at Mach 6.85.

The Space Shuttle, while far faster than the X-43 or X-15, was not regarded as an aircraft during ascent as it was carried ballistically by rocket thrust, rather than the air. During re-entry it was classed (like a glider) as an unpowered aircraft. The first flight was in 1981.

The Bell 533 (1964), Lockheed XH-51 (1965), and Sikorsky S-69 (1977-1981) are examples of compound helicopter designs where jet exhaust added to forward thrust. The Hiller YH-32 Hornet and Fairey Ultra-light Helicopter were among the many helicopters where the rotors were driven by tip jets.

Jet-powered wingsuits exist – powered by model aircraft jet engines – but of short duration and needing to be launched at height.

==Aerodynamics==
Because of the way they work, the typical exhaust speed of jet engines is transonic or faster, therefore most jet aircraft need to fly at high speeds, either supersonic or speeds just below the speed of sound (&quot;transonic&quot;) so as to achieve efficient flight. Aerodynamics is therefore an important consideration.

Jet aircraft are usually designed using the Whitcomb area rule, which says that the total area of cross-section of the aircraft at any point along the aircraft from the nose must be approximately the same as that of a Sears-Haack body. A shape with that property minimises the production of shockwaves which would waste energy.
==Jet engines==
There are several types of engine which operate by expelling hot gas:

*turbojet
*turbofan (which come in two main forms low bypass turbofan and high bypass turbofan)
*ramjet
*turboprop 

The different types are used for different purposes.

Rockets are the oldest type, and are mainly used when extremely high speeds are needed, or operation at extremely high altitudes where there is insufficient air to operate a jet engine. Due to the extreme, typically hypersonic, exhaust velocity and the necessity of oxidiser being carried on board, they consume propellant extremely quickly, making them impractical for routine transportation.

Turbojets are the second oldest type; they have a high, usually supersonic, exhaust speed and low frontal cross-section, and so are best suited to high-speed, usually supersonic, flight. Although once widely used, they are relatively inefficient compared to turboprop and turbofans for subsonic flight. The last major aircraft to use turbojets were Concorde and Tu-144 supersonic transports.

Low bypass turbofans have a lower exhaust speed than turbojets, and are mostly used for high sonic, transonic, and low supersonic speeds. High bypass turbofans are relatively efficient, and are used by subsonic aircraft such as airliners.

==Flying characteristics==
Jet aircraft fly considerably differently than propeller aircraft.

One difference is that jet engines respond relatively slowly. This complicates takeoff and landing maneuvers.
In particular, during takeoff, propeller aircraft engines blow air over their wings and that gives more lift and a shorter takeoff. These differences caught out some early BOAC Comet pilots.

==Propulsive efficiency==

In aircraft &quot;overall propulsive efficiency&quot; formula_1 is the efficiency, in percent, with which the energy contained in a vehicle&#x27;s propellant is converted into useful energy, to replace losses due to air drag, gravity, and acceleration. It can also be stated as the proportion of the mechanical energy actually used to propel the aircraft. It is always less than 100% because of kinetic energy loss to the exhaust, and less-than-ideal efficiency of the propulsive mechanism, whether a propeller, a jet exhaust, or a fan. In addition, propulsive efficiency is greatly dependent on air density and airspeed.

Mathematically, it is represented as formula_2 where formula_3 is the cycle efficiency and formula_4 is the propulsive efficiency. The cycle efficiency, in percent, is the proportion of energy that can be derived from the energy source that is converted to mechanical energy by the engine.

For jet aircraft the &quot;propulsive efficiency&quot; (essentially energy efficiency) is highest when the engine emits an exhaust jet at a speed that is the same as, or nearly the same as, the vehicle velocity. The exact formula for air-breathing engines as given in the literature, is

:formula_5

where &quot;c&quot; is the exhaust speed, and &quot;v&quot; is the speed of the aircraft.

==Range==

For a long range jet operating in the stratosphere, the speed of sound is constant, hence flying at fixed angle of attack and constant Mach number causes the aircraft to climb, without changing the value of the local speed of sound. In this case:

formula_6

where formula_7 is the cruise Mach number and formula_8 the local speed of sound. The range equation can be shown to be:

formula_9

which is known as the &quot;Breguet range equation&quot; after the French aviation pioneer Louis Charles Breguet.

<doc id="164658" wikidata="Q3055939" url="?curid=164658" title="Just Enough Education to Perform">
<text>Just Enough Education to Perform is the third studio album by Welsh rock band Stereophonics. Released on 11 April 2001, the album topped the UK Albums Chart with 140,000 copies sold. and spawned three top-ten singles in the form of &quot;Mr. Writer&quot;, &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot;, Step on My Old Size Nines&quot; and &quot;Handbags and Gladrags&quot;. The album&#x27;s title comes from a line in the song &quot;Mr. Writer&quot;.

When the album was originally released it had 11 tracks; it was then re-released in 2002 to include &quot;Handbags and Gladrags&quot; after it was released as a single.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Just Enough Education to Perform&quot; received generally mixed to positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 68 based on 10 reviews. Despite some negative reviews, it had their highest score on Metacritic until 2022&#x27;s Oochya! exceeded it by one point with a score of 69.

Writing in &quot;Observer Music Monthly&quot;, Tony Heyman commented on the title of the album, claiming &quot;regardless of their level of education, the Stereophonics clearly have no performing qualities whatsoever. If they are suggesting a connection between formal education and musical ability, they must be four [sic] illiterate morons who were expelled from playschool for being too thick.&quot; Heyman launched a rant against the group, referring to the album as &quot;musical excrement, scooped unhygienically from a poorly-maintained squat toilet in an area without adequate sanitation.&quot; He suggested that if it wasn&#x27;t laminated, the CD insert booklet could be distributed to third-world communities as toilet paper.

===Commercial performance===
On its initial release in 2001, &quot;Just Enough Education to Perform&quot; reached number 1 in the UK charts where it stayed for two weeks, it topped the charts for another two weeks in the second week of January 2002, nine months after its initial release. The album then went on to re-enter the charts several times: it peaked at number 27 during June 2002, number 37 in July 2003 and number 34 in August 2003, until finally disappearing from the top 100. In 2001 it was the 4th biggest selling album in the UK, and in 2002 it was the 24th biggest selling album in the UK, as well as being the 39th biggest selling album of the decade. It went on to be certified 5× platinum in the UK. As of 2009 it has sold 83,000 copies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan.

<doc id="164659" wikidata="Q544627" url="?curid=164659" title="Terence Rattigan">
<text>Sir Terence Mervyn Rattigan (10 June 191130 November 1977) was a British dramatist and screenwriter. He was one of England&#x27;s most popular mid-20th-century dramatists. His plays are typically set in an upper-middle-class background. He wrote &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot; (1946), &quot;The Browning Version&quot; (1948), &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot; (1952) and &quot;Separate Tables&quot; (1954), among many others.

A troubled homosexual who saw himself as an outsider, Rattigan wrote a number of plays which centred on issues of sexual frustration, failed relationships, or a world of repression and reticence.

==Early life==
Terence Rattigan was born in 1911 in South Kensington, London, of Irish extraction. He had an elder brother, Brian. They were the grandsons of Sir William Henry Rattigan, a notable India-based jurist and later a Liberal Unionist Member of Parliament for North-East Lanarkshire. His father was Frank Rattigan CMG, a diplomat whose exploits included an affair with Princess Elisabeth of Romania (future consort of King George II of Greece) which resulted in her having an abortion. The Royal House of Romania is considered to be the inspiration of Rattigan&#x27;s play &quot;The Sleeping Prince&quot;.

Rattigan&#x27;s birth certificate and his birth announcement in &quot;The Times&quot; indicate he was born on 9 June 1911. However, most reference books state that he was born the following day; Rattigan himself never publicly disputed this date. There is evidence suggesting that the date on the birth certificate is incorrect. He was given no middle name, but he adopted the middle name &quot;Mervyn&quot; in early adulthood.

==Education==
Rattigan was educated at Sandroyd School from 1920 to 1925, at the time based in Cobham, Surrey (and now the home of Reed&#x27;s School), and Harrow School. Rattigan played cricket for the Harrow First XI and scored 29 in the Eton–Harrow match in 1929. He was a member of the Harrow School Officer Training Corps and organised a mutiny, informing the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. Even more annoying to his headmaster, Cyril Norwood, was the telegram from the Eton OTC, &quot;offering to march to his assistance&quot;. He then went to Trinity College, Oxford.

==Life and career==
Success as a playwright came early, with the comedy &quot;French Without Tears&quot; in 1936, set in a crammer. This was inspired by a 1933 visit to a village called Marxzell in the Black Forest, where young English gentlemen went to learn German; his time briefly overlapped with his Harrow classmate Jock Colville.

Rattigan&#x27;s determination to write a more serious play produced &quot;After the Dance&quot; (1939), a satirical social drama about the &quot;bright young things&quot; and their failure to politically engage. The outbreak of the Second World War scuppered any chances of a long run. Shortly before the war, Rattigan had written (together with Anthony Goldsmith) a satire about Nazi Germany, &quot;Follow My Leader&quot;; the Lord Chamberlain refused to license it on grounds of offence to a foreign country, but it was performed from January 1940.

During the war, Rattigan served in the Royal Air Force as a tail gunner; his experiences helped inspire &quot;Flare Path&quot;. In 1943 Rattigan, then an RAF Flight Lieutenant, was posted to the RAF Film Production Unit to work on &quot;The Way to the Stars&quot; (a substantial reworking and adaption for film of &quot;Flare Path&quot;) and &quot;Journey Together&quot;.

After the war, Rattigan alternated between comedies and dramas, establishing himself as a major playwright: the most successful of which were &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot; (1946), &quot;The Browning Version&quot; (1948), &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot; (1952), and &quot;Separate Tables&quot; (1954).

Rattigan&#x27;s belief in understated emotions and craftsmanship was deemed old fashioned and &quot;pre-war&quot; after the overnight success in 1956 of John Osborne&#x27;s play &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; began the era of kitchen sink dramas by the writers known as the Angry Young Men. Rattigan responded to this critical disfavour with some bitterness. His later plays—&quot;Ross&quot;, &quot;Man and Boy&quot;, &quot;In Praise of Love&quot;, and &quot;Cause Célèbre&quot;—although showing no sign of any decline in his talent, are less well-known than his earlier works. Rattigan explained that he wrote his plays to please a symbolic playgoer, &quot;Aunt Edna&quot;, someone from the well-off middle-class who had conventional tastes; his critics frequently used this character as the basis for belittling him. &quot;Aunt Edna&quot; inspired Joe Orton to create &quot;Edna Welthorpe&quot;, a mischievous alter ego stirring up controversy about his own plays.

Rattigan was homosexual, with numerous lovers but no long-term partners, a possible exception being his &quot;congenial companion ... and occasional friend&quot; Michael Franklin. From 1944 to January 1947 he enjoyed a volatile affair with the politician Henry &quot;Chips&quot; Channon who detailed the relationship in his diary published posthumously in 2022.

It has been claimed his work is essentially autobiographical, containing coded references to his sexuality, which was known by some in the theatrical world but not known to the public. There is some truth in this, but it risks being crudely reductive; for example, the repeated claim that Rattigan originally wrote &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot; as a play about male lovers, turned at the last minute into a heterosexual play, may be unfounded, though Rattigan said otherwise.

On the other hand, for the Broadway staging of &quot;Separate Tables&quot;, he wrote an alternative version of the newspaper article in which Major Pollock&#x27;s indiscretions are revealed to his fellow hotel guests; in this version, those whom the Major approached for sex were men rather than young women. However, Rattigan changed his mind about staging it, and the original version proceeded.

Rattigan was fascinated with the life and character of T. E. Lawrence. In 1960, he wrote a play called &quot;Ross&quot;, based on Lawrence&#x27;s exploits. Preparations were made to film it, and Dirk Bogarde accepted the role. However, it did not proceed because the Rank Organisation withdrew its support, not wishing to offend David Lean and Sam Spiegel, who had started to film &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;. Bogarde called Rank&#x27;s decision &quot;my bitterest disappointment&quot;. Also in 1960, a musical version of &quot;French Without Tears&quot; was staged as &quot;Joie de Vivre&quot;, with music by Robert Stolz of &quot;White Horse Inn&quot; fame. It starred Donald Sinden, lasted only four performances, and has never been revived. 

Rattigan was diagnosed with leukaemia in 1962 but seemingly recovered two years later. He fell ill again in 1968. He disliked the so-called &quot;Swinging London&quot; of the 1960s and moved abroad, living in Bermuda, where he lived off the proceeds from lucrative screenplays including &quot;The V.I.P.s&quot; and &quot;The Yellow Rolls-Royce&quot;. For a time he was the highest-paid screenwriter in the world.

In 1964, Rattigan wrote to the playwright Joe Orton congratulating the latter on his very dark comedy &quot;Entertaining Mr Sloane&quot;, to which Rattigan had escorted Vivien Leigh in its first week. He had invested £3,000 in getting the play transferred to the West End. Although an unlikely champion of the &quot;risqué&quot; Orton, Rattigan recognised the younger man&#x27;s talent and approved of what he considered a well-written piece of theatre. He also acknowledged in retrospect that, &quot;in a way, I was not Orton&#x27;s best sponsor. I&#x27;m a very unfashionable figure still, and I was then wildly unfashionable critically. My sponsorship rather put critics off, I think.&quot;

Rattigan was knighted in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours of June 1971 for services to the theatre, being only the fourth playwright to be knighted in the 20th century (after Sir W. S. Gilbert in 1907, Sir Arthur Wing Pinero in 1909 and Sir Noël Coward in 1970). He had previously been appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), in June 1958. He moved back to Britain, where he experienced a minor revival in his reputation before his death.

==Death==
Rattigan died in Hamilton, Bermuda, from bone cancer on 30 November 1977, aged 66. His cremated remains were deposited in the family vault at Kensal Green Cemetery.

==Legacy==
In 1990, the British Library acquired Rattigan&#x27;s papers consisting of 300 volumes of correspondence and papers relating to his prose and dramatic works.

There was a revival of &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot; in 1993, at the Almeida Theatre, London, directed by Karel Reisz and starring Penelope Wilton. A string of successful revivals followed, including &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot; at the Chichester Festival Theatre in 2001 (with David Rintoul, and subsequently on tour in 2002 with Edward Fox), &quot;Man and Boy&quot; at the Duchess Theatre, London, in 2005, with David Suchet as Gregor Antonescu, and &quot;In Praise of Love&quot; at Chichester, and &quot;Separate Tables&quot; at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, in 2006. His play on the last days of Lord Nelson, &quot;A Bequest to the Nation&quot;, was revived on Radio 3 for Trafalgar 200, starring Janet McTeer as Lady Hamilton, Kenneth Branagh as Nelson, and Amanda Root as Lady Nelson.

Thea Sharrock directed his rarely seen &quot;After the Dance&quot; in the summer of 2010 at London&#x27;s Royal National Theatre. She directed a major new production of Rattigan&#x27;s final and also rarely seen play &quot;Cause Célèbre&quot; at The Old Vic in March 2011 as part of The Terence Rattigan Centenary year celebrations. As well as this, Trevor Nunn marked the occasion with a West End revival of &quot;Flare Path&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, between March and June 2011, starring Sienna Miller, James Purefoy and Sheridan Smith.

In 2011, the BBC presented &quot;The Rattigan Enigma by Benedict Cumberbatch&quot;, a documentary on Rattigan&#x27;s life and career presented by actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who, like Rattigan, attended Harrow.

A new screen version of &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot;, directed by Terence Davies, was released in 2011, starring Rachel Weisz and Tom Hiddleston.

<text>Cultural diversity is the quality of diverse or different cultures, as opposed to monoculture. It has a variety of meanings in different contexts, sometimes applying to cultural products like art works in museums or entertainment available online, and sometimes applying to the variety of human cultures or traditions in a specific region, or in the world as a whole. It can also refer to the inclusion of different cultural perspectives in an organization or society.

Cultural diversity can be affected by political factors such as censorship or the protection of the rights of artists, and by economic factors such as free trade or protectionism in the market for cultural goods. Since the middle of the 20th century, there has been a concerted international effort to protect cultural diversity, involving the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and its member states. This involves action at international, national, and local levels. Cultural diversity can also be promoted by individual citizens in the ways they choose to express or experience culture.

== Characteristics ==

In the context of national and international efforts to promote or preserve cultural diversity, the term applies to five overlapping domains:

* &quot;economic&quot;: the availability of diverse cultural goods or services,
* &quot;artistic&quot;: the variety of artistic genres and styles that coexist,
* &quot;participatory&quot;: the participation of diverse ethnic groups in a nation&#x27;s culture,
* &quot;heritage&quot;: the diversity of cultural traditions that are represented in heritage institutions such as museums, and
* &quot;multicultural&quot;: the variety of ethnic groups and their traditions that are visible in a country.

Of these five, the economic meaning has come to dominate in international negotiations. Nations have principally looked to protect cultural diversity by strengthening the ability of their domestic cultural industries to sell goods or services. Since the 1990s, UNESCO has mainly used &quot;cultural diversity&quot; for the international aspects of diversity, preferring the term &quot;cultural pluralism&quot; for diversity within a country.

Governments and international bodies use &quot;cultural diversity&quot; in both a broad and a narrow sense. The broad meaning takes its inspiration from anthropology. It includes lifestyles, value systems, traditions, and beliefs in addition to creative works. It emphasises an ongoing process of interaction and dialogue between cultures. This meaning has been promoted to the international community by UNESCO, since the 2001 Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity. In practice, governments use a narrower, more traditional, meaning that focuses on the economic domain mentioned above. 

In the international legal context, cultural diversity has been described as analogous to biodiversity. The General Conference of UNESCO took this position in 2001, asserting in Article 1 of the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity that &quot;cultural diversity is as necessary for humankind as biodiversity is for nature.&quot; The authors John Cavanagh and Jerry Mander took this analogy further, describing cultural diversity as &quot;a sort of cultural gene pool to spur innovation toward ever higher levels of social, intellectual and spiritual accomplishment.&quot;

==Quantification==

Cultural diversity is difficult to quantify. One measure of diversity is the number of identifiable cultures. The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs reports that, although their numbers are relatively small, indigenous peoples account for 5,000 distinct cultures and thus the majority of the world&#x27;s cultural diversity.

Another aspect of cultural diversity is measured by counting the number of languages spoken in a region or in the world as a whole. By this measure, the world&#x27;s cultural diversity is rapidly declining. Research carried out in the 1990s by David Crystal suggested that at that time, on average, one language was falling into disuse every two weeks. He calculated that if that rate of the language death were to continue, then by the year 2100, more than 90% of the languages currently spoken in the world will have gone extinct.

In 2003, James Fearon of Stanford University published, in the &quot;Journal of Economic Growth&quot;, a list of countries based on the diversity of ethnicities, languages, and religions.

== International legal context ==
At the international level, the notion of cultural diversity has been defended by UNESCO since its founding in 1945, through a succession of declarations and legal instruments.

Many of the international legal agreements addressing cultural diversity were focused on intellectual property rights, and thus on tangible cultural expressions that can be bought or sold. The World Heritage List, established in 1972 by UNESCO, mainly listed architectural features and monuments. In the late 20th century, the diplomatic community recognised a need to protect intangible cultural heritage: the traditions, social structures, and skills that support creative expression. International efforts to define and protect this aspect of culture began with the 1989 UNESCO Recommendation on the Safeguarding of Traditional Culture and Folklore. UNESCO&#x27;s Proclamation of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity began in 2001, highlighting specific masterpieces to promote the responsibility of nations to protect intangible cultural heritage. Further proclamations were added in 2003 and 2005, bringing the total number of masterpieces to ninety. In 2001, UNESCO also hosted expert meetings to create a definition of intangible cultural heritage and a more legally binding treaty to protect it, resulting in the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage. This was passed in 2003 and came into force in 2006. One result of this convention was the 2008 creation of UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Heritage, which incorporated the masterpieces from the 2001, 2003, and 2005 proclamations.

The first international instrument enshrining the value of cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue was the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity, adopted unanimously in 2001. It calls on nations and institutions to work together for the preservation of culture in all its forms, and for policies that help to share ideas across cultures and inspire new forms of creativity. UNESCO no longer interpreted &quot;culture&quot; in terms of artistic masterpieces. With the Universal Declaration, it adopted a more expansive understanding based on anthropology. This defined cultural diversity as &quot;the set of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual, and emotional features of society or a social group&quot;, including lifestyles, value systems, traditions, and beliefs. The twelve articles of the Universal Declaration were published with an action plan for ways to promote cultural diversity. This action plan connected cultural diversity explicitly to human rights including freedom of expression, freedom of movement, and protection of indigenous knowledge. The declaration identifies cultural diversity as a source of innovation and creativity, as well as a driver of both economic development and personal development. UNESCO made a submission to a 2002 UN report on Human Rights and Cultural Diversity, quoting part of the declaration to emphasise that cultural diversity must not be used to infringe the rights of minorities and that cultural diversity requires the protection of individual freedoms.

Citing the Universal Declaration, the United Nations General Assembly established the World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development in December 2002. This continues to be celebrated on May 21 each year.

The Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage drew attention to increasing cultural homogenization by economic globalization and motivated UNESCO to negotiate a treaty protecting cultural diversity. The resulting Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions (the &quot;2005 Convention&quot;) was adopted in October 2005. This was the first international treaty to establish rights and obligations specifically relating to culture. The convention builds on the 2001 declaration by naming linguistic diversity as a fundamental part of cultural diversity and stating that cultural diversity depends on the free flow of ideas. To date, 151 signatory states, as well as the European Union, have registered their ratification of the convention, or a legally equivalent process.

The 2005 Convention created an International Fund for Cultural Diversity (IFCD), funded by voluntary contributions. This makes funding available to developing countries that are parties to the convention for specific activities that develop their cultural policies and cultural industries. As of April 2023, UNESCO reports that 140 projects in 69 developing countries have been carried out with funding from the IFCD.

== Factors ==
Cultural policy scholar Johnathan Vickery has observed that cultural diversity, like biological diversity, is continually under threat from various factors. Cultural diversity, linguistic diversity and species diversity show a partially comparable pattern. These threats often come from other cultural expressions, as when imported entertainment undermines interest in a nation&#x27;s own culture. Other examples he mentions include religious revivals and modern Western education systems. Factors that promote a country&#x27;s cultural diversity include migration and a nation&#x27;s openness to discussing and celebrating cultural differences (which is itself an aspect of culture).

The actions of governments, international bodies, and civil society (meaning non-governmental and cultural sector organisations) can promote or restrict cultural diversity. As part of the international effort to promote and preserve cultural diversity, the 2005 Convention established processes to monitor progress towards a favourable environment, including global reports every four years and national reports from individual states.

=== Imperialism and colonialism ===

Colonialism has frequently involved an intentional destruction of cultural diversity, when the colonising powers use education, media, and violence to replace the languages, religions, and cultural values of the colonised people with their own. This process of forced assimilation has been used many times in history, particularly by the European colonial powers from the 18th to 20th centuries, taking the form of forced conversion to the coloniser&#x27;s religion, privatisation of community property, and replacement of systems of work. The protection of indigenous peoples&#x27; rights to maintain their own languages, religions, and culture has been enshrined in treaties including the 1965 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

=== Artistic freedom ===
Artistic freedom, as defined by the 2005 Convention, includes the freedom of artists to work without government interference, and also the freedom of citizens to access diverse cultural content. Governments can repress these freedoms through censorship or surveillance of artists, or can choose to actively protect artists and their free expression. According to the 2017 and 2022 global reports, attacks against artists — including prosecution, imprisonment, or even killing — have increased in recent years. In 2020, 978 cases were reported around the world, compared to 771 in 2019 and 673 in 2018. Musicians are the most threatened group, especially rap musicians, whose lyrics tend to be provocative and politically challenging. While online services have provided new ways for artists to distribute images, music, and video to large audiences, they have brought their own threats to freedom in the form of censorship, surveillance, and trolling. The 2022 global report found that some countries had repealed laws restricting free expression, including blasphemy and defamation laws, but that in practice artistic freedom was not being better monitored or protected.

=== Mobility of artists and cultural professionals ===

Mobility restrictions present challenges to professionals in the cultural and creative industries, specifically to those from the Global South. Artists and cultural professionals need to travel to perform to new audiences or to attend a residency or to engage in networking. Their ability to do so depends on their country of origin; the holder of a German passport can travel to 176 countries without a visa while for an Afghan passport the number of countries is 24. Travel restrictions, including difficulties in obtaining visas, often impede artists from the Global South to participate in art biennales or film festivals, even when invited to receive an award or to promote their works. The 2022 global report found that, despite governments and civil society organisations taking this inequality more seriously, concrete improvements are lacking. Thus, the ability of artists from the Global South to reach audiences in the Global North &quot;remains extremely weak&quot;.

=== Governance of culture ===
As well as protecting free expression and free movement, governments can promote cultural diversity by recognising and enforcing the rights of artists. The working conditions of artists are affected by their rights to organise labor unions, to workplace safety, and to social security protections for times when their work does not produce income. These economic and social rights are formally recognised by the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights passed by the UN in 1966 and by the 1980 Recommendation concerning the Status of the Artist adopted by UNESCO in 1980. Social security in particular allows a more diverse range of citizens to take part in artistic activities, because without it, financially insecure people are discouraged from working in a field with unstable income.

=== Gender equality in cultural and creative industries ===

A gender gap persists worldwide concerning equal pay, access to funding and prices charged for creative works. Consequently, women remain under-represented in key creative roles and are outnumbered in decision-making positions. As of 2018, women made up only 34% of Ministers for Culture (compared to 24% in 2005) and only 31% of national arts program directors. Generally, women are better represented in specific cultural fields such as arts education and training (60%), book publishing and press (54%), audiovisual and interactive media (26%), as well as design and creative services (33%). The 2022 global report found that cultural industries were increasingly making gender equality a priority, but that actual progress was slow. Though 48.1% of the work in cultural and entertainment sectors is done by women, the report concluded that they are still under-represented in leadership positions, get less public funding, and get less recognition for their work.

=== Trade and investment in cultural goods and services ===
Between 2015 and 2017, at least eight bilateral and regional free trade agreements have introduced cultural clauses or list of commitments that promote the objectives and principles of the 2005 Convention. Despite the lack of the promotion of the objectives and principles of the 2005 Convention with regard to the negotiation of mega-regional partnership agreements, some parties to the Trans Pacific Partnership (TTP) have succeeded in introducing cultural reservations to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions. The growth of online digital content has increased the diversity of culture that a person can get immediate access to, but also increased the threat to cultural diversity by making it easier for a small number of large companies to flood markets with their cultural products. Digital delivery of culture has also given a great deal of power to companies in the technology sector.

=== Cultural platforms ===
Organisations that promote access to culture can reflect diversity in what they choose to host or to exclude. Google Arts and Culture and Europeana are among the platforms who state a commitment to promoting cultural diversity. For Google Arts and Culture, diversity implies &quot;working with communities that have historically been left out of the mainstream cultural narrative&quot; while Europeana acknowledges that &quot;stories told with/by cultural heritage items have not historically been representative of the population, and so we strive to share lesser-told stories from underrepresented communities.&quot;

=== Individual choices ===
Individual citizens can experience and promote cultural diversity through their own choices, including the choice to share their own culture. The &quot;Do One Thing for Diversity and Inclusion&quot; campaign has been run annually since 2011 by the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC) as a way to commemorate the World Day for Cultural Diversity. It encourages people to explore the music, literature, art, and traditions of unfamiliar cultures and to share their own culture with strangers.

The American lawyer Juliette Passer describes the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity as prompting each individual to consider their own and others&#x27; diverse identities:

&quot;We need social and educational experiences plus reflection on the experience to go beyond reliance on stereotypes. The more we interact with diverse others and mindfully reflect on the experience, the more we can improve our competency with differences.&quot;

== National and local initiatives ==
In September 2002, the city of Porto Alegre in Brazil organized a world meeting for culture, bringing together mayors and technical directors of culture from different cities of the world, with observers from civil society. The cities of Porto Alegre and Barcelona have proposed the drafting of a reference document for the development of local cultural policies, inspired by Agenda 21, created in 1992 for the environment. The Culture 21 was thus designed with the aim of including cultural diversity at the local level. The document was approved on May 8, 2004 during the first edition of the Universal Forum of Cultures in Barcelona.

<text>Dominique Marie François René Galouzeau de Villepin (; born 14 November 1953) is a French politician who served as Prime Minister of France from 31 May 2005 to 17 May 2007 under President Jacques Chirac.

In his career working at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, De Villepin rose through the ranks of the French right as one of Chirac&#x27;s protégés. He came into the international spotlight as Minister of Foreign Affairs with his opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, one year after his appointment to the office, which culminated with a speech to the United Nations. Before his tenure as prime minister, he also served as Minister of the Interior (2004–2005).

After being replaced by François Fillon as prime minister, De Villepin was indicted in connection with the &quot;Clearstream&quot; affair; he was subsequently cleared of charges of complicity in allowing false accusations to proceed against presidential rival Nicolas Sarkozy regarding bribes paid on a sale of warships to Taiwan. De Villepin enjoyed a modest return to public favour for his public critique of President Sarkozy&#x27;s style of &quot;imperial rule&quot;.

De Villepin has written poetry, a book about poetry, and several historical and political essays, along with a study of Napoleon. He is an honorary member of the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation.

==Early life and education==
Villepin was born in Rabat, Morocco, and spent some time in Venezuela, where his family lived for four years. He then lived in the U.S., and has said that he &quot;grew up in the United States&quot;. During his teenage years, &quot;the &#x27;Beat generation&#x27; movement left its mark on me, so did the hippie movement&quot;. He was inspired by Jack Kerouac and other American poets. He graduated from the Lycée Français de New York in 1971. He has three children: Marie (b. 1986), Arthur, and Victoire (b. 1989).

Contrary to what his surname suggests, Villepin is not from an aristocratic background. His ancestors added the particle &quot;de&quot; to the family name. His great-grandfather was a colonel in the French army, his grandfather was a board member for several companies, and his father Xavier de Villepin was a diplomat and a member of the Senate. Villepin speaks French, English and Spanish.

When his mother died, Villepin gave a eulogy &quot;full of the grandest and most sonorous cadences of the French language&quot;, wrote &quot;The Independent&quot; (UK) in 2010. He &quot;spoke of his mother&#x27;s passionate belief in the greatness and the destiny of France, and, implicitly, the greatness and destiny of her son&quot;. One mourner stated that he seemed to speak &quot;of France and of himself as being the same thing&quot;.

==Career==
===Diplomat===
Villepin studied at the Institut d&#x27;Études Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po) and went on to the (ENA), France&#x27;s highly selective post-graduate school which trains its top civil servants. Villepin also holds degrees in Civil law and French literature from the universities of Panthéon-Assas and Paris X Nanterre. At the end of his studies, he completed his military service as a naval officer on board the Aircraft Carrier Clemenceau. Villepin then entered a career in diplomacy. His assignments were:
*Advising Committee on African affairs (1980–1984)
*The French embassy in Washington, D.C. (1984–1989), as &quot;premier secrétaire&quot; until 1987 and then &quot;deuxième conseiller&quot;
*The embassy in New Delhi (1989–1992), as &quot;deuxième conseiller&quot; until 1990 and then &quot;premier conseiller&quot;
*Foreign Ministry&#x27;s top adviser on Africa (1992–1993)

===Early political positions===
Villepin was introduced to Jacques Chirac in the early 1980s and became one of his advisers on foreign policy. In 1993 he became chief of staff (&quot;directeur de cabinet&quot;) of Alain Juppé, the Foreign Minister in Édouard Balladur&#x27;s cabinet, who was Chirac&#x27;s political heir apparent.

Villepin then became director of Chirac&#x27;s successful 1995 presidential campaign and was rewarded with the key job of Secretary-General of the Élysée Palace during Chirac&#x27;s first term as President of the Republic (1995–2002). He advised the president to hold an early general election in 1997, while the French National Assembly was overwhelmingly dominated by the president&#x27;s party. This was a risky gamble, and Chirac&#x27;s party went on to lose the elections. Villepin offered Chirac his resignation afterwards, but it was turned down. Villepin&#x27;s flawed advice on the election increased the perception among many politicians on the right that Villepin had no experience or understanding of grassroots politics, and owed his enviable position only to being Chirac&#x27;s protégé.

Villepin has had an uneasy relationship with the members of his own political side. He has in the past made a number of demeaning remarks about members of parliament from his own party. In addition, the mutual distaste between Villepin and Nicolas Sarkozy, head of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) majority party, is well known.

===Foreign minister===
He was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs by Chirac in the cabinet of Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin at the beginning of Chirac&#x27;s second term in 2002.

During the 2004 coup d&#x27;état in Haiti, Villepin obtained the backing of the United States Secretary of State, Colin Powell, in his bid to oust Jean-Bertrand Aristide from power.

Villepin&#x27;s most famous assignment as Chirac&#x27;s foreign minister was opposing the U.S. plan to invade Iraq, giving France a leading role in the grouping of countries such as Germany, Belgium, Russia and China that opposed the invasion. The speech he gave to the UN to block a second resolution allowing the use of force against Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime received loud applause.

During mid-2003 Villepin organized the Opération 14 juillet that attempted to rescue his former student, Ingrid Betancourt, who was being held by FARC rebels in Colombia. The operation failed, and because he had neither informed Colombia, Brazil, nor President Chirac of the mission, it resulted in a political scandal.

===Interior minister===
During the cabinet reshuffle that made Nicolas Sarkozy Finance Minister, Villepin was appointed to replace him as interior minister on 31 March 2004.

His actions against radical Islam included mandatory courses for Muslim clerics, notably in the French language (as indications were that one-third of them may not have been fluent in the national language), in moderate Muslim theology and in French secularism: &quot;laïcité&quot;, Republican principles and the law. While Sarkozy created the French Council of the Muslim Faith, an official body which is now dominated by Orthodoxes, Villepin would have preferred a &quot;Muslim foundation&quot;, in which mosque-based representatives would be balanced by secular Muslims.

He also cracked down on radical Muslim clerics, causing an uproar when he tried to expel Abdelkader Bouziane, an imam alleged to have said to the press that, according to Ancient Islamic texts, adulterous people could be whipped or stoned. When the decision to expel him was overturned by the courts, because of the journalistic reporting of LyonMag was deemed biased, Villepin pushed a change of the law through Parliament, and Bouziane was sent home.

===Prime Minister of France===

President Chirac was at one point thought to have turned his eye on Villepin as a possible successor, assuming that he himself would not enter the 2007 presidential contest. However, Nicolas Sarkozy was chosen to represent the centre-right UMP party.

On 29 May 2005, French voters in the referendum on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe turned down the proposed document by a wide margin. Two days later, Raffarin resigned and Chirac appointed Villepin as Prime Minister of France.

====Villepin&#x27;s cabinet====
In an address to the nation, Chirac had declared that the new cabinet&#x27;s top priority would be to curb unemployment, which was consistently hovering above 10%, calling for a &quot;national mobilization&quot; to that effect.

Villepin&#x27;s cabinet was marked by its small membership (for France), and its hierarchical unity: all members had the rank of Minister, and there were no Secretaries of State, the lowest cabinet member rank. The aim of this decision was for the cabinet to form a close-knit and more efficient team to combat unemployment.

The economy was growing sluggishly and a significant drop in unemployment was yet to be seen. Villepin&#x27;s aim was therefore to restore the French people&#x27;s trust in their government, an achievement for which he publicly set himself a deadline of a hundred days from the appointment of cabinet.

Another issue was the European Constitution, rejected by France and the Netherlands in referendums.

After Pope Benedict XVI was widely chastized for appearing to criticize Islam in a speech on 12 September 2006, French author Robert Redeker came to the pontiff&#x27;s defense, in response to which he received death threats that forced him and his family to go into hiding. Villepin commented that &quot;everyone has the right to express their opinions freely – at the same time that they respect others, of course&quot;. The lesson of this episode, according to Villepin, was &quot;how vigilant we must be to ensure that people fully respect one another in our society&quot;.

Some had speculated that Villepin, with his diplomatic experience and the prestige associated with the job of prime minister, would negotiate a new treaty with the European Union, while Sarkozy would run the country at home. However, Villepin obtained favorable reviews from the press and temporarily increased popularity in polls. In particular, he was increasingly cited as a possible presidential candidate for 2007, although Nicolas Sarkozy had publicly stated that he himself was giving considerable attention to that election. Villepin and Sarkozy initially avoided any open division.

Villepin declared that lowering unemployment was the number one objective of his government (which had also been stated by other prime ministers before him, albeit to no avail). He, as well as the UMP party, believed that France&#x27;s workforce rules were too rigid and discouraged employment, and that some liberalizing reforms were necessary in order to &quot;correct&quot; the French social model.

On 2 August 2005 he issued ordinances establishing a new kind of work contract (called &quot;CNE&quot;) for small enterprises, with fewer guarantees than ordinary contracts. While Villepin&#x27;s measures would surely have been approved by his wide UMP majority in Parliament. Villepin said the government needed to act fast, especially when Parliament was going on its summer recess.

On 16 January 2006 he announced a similar kind of work contract (called &quot;Contrat première embauche&quot;, or &quot;CPE&quot;) for young people (under 26). The parliament approved on 8 February. Subsequently, students started to protest. This wave of protest eventually forced the government to give in. Although the law on the &quot;CPE&quot; is formally still valid, the government promised to hinder its application and initiated a new legal initiative which will abolish the key points of the &quot;CPE&quot;. During the protests, Villepin was widely perceived as stubborn and arrogant. As a consequence, his popularity rates went down rapidly and he was no longer regarded as a serious contender for the 2007 presidential election.

Another major issue in Villepin&#x27;s government was the state of the national budget. France runs high deficits, which run afoul of the rules set in the EU Maastricht Treaty. Villepin&#x27;s margin of maneuver in that respect was extremely slim.

====&quot;Contrat Première Embauche&quot; and strikes====

On Thursday, 16 March 2006, tens of thousands of French university and school students marched to demand the government scrap a contentious youth jobs clause, known as First Employment Contract (CPE). The law, intended as a response to the 2005 riots, was intended to stimulate job growth and reduce the country&#x27;s high youth unemployment rate by allowing employers to fire employees aged under 26 within the first two years of their employment for any or no reason. Supporters of the law argued that such probationary arrangements are not unusual in Western countries and that the current system in France discourages employers from hiring people whom they may be unable to fire if they prove unsuitable for the job. Critics argued that the CPE discriminated unnecessarily against the young and decreases job security. The union movement issued an ultimatum to Villepin to scrap the law by 20 March or face a general strike. This ultimatum expired without concession. A general strike was called for 28 March.

On 28 March, between one and three million people demonstrated across France. The protests were accompanied by some violence and 800 people were arrested, 500 of them in Paris. Prime Minister Villepin refused to withdraw the CPE but called for negotiations on adapting it. The demonstrators for the most part called for the complete withdrawal of the CPE.

The CPE was withdrawn by Jacques Chirac on 10 April.

====2006 National Assembly debate====

On 20 June 2006, during the questions to government in the National Assembly, Dominique de Villepin accused the head of the Socialist Party François Hollande of cowardice. Hollande had questioned the Prime Minister about the recent &quot;insider trading&quot; scandal involving the aerospace company EADS and executive Noël Forgeard. This triggered an incident in the Assembly, with Socialist deputies converging on the government benches until they were stopped by the Assembly ushers. Hollande demanded apologies and the resignation of the Prime Minister; the next day, Dominique de Villepin apologized. This event resulted in criticism even from Villepin&#x27;s own UMP party, with UMP parliamentarians including Assembly vice-president Yves Bur suggesting that president Chirac should appoint another prime minister.

====Clearstream affair====
In 2004, French judges were given a list by an anonymous source containing the names of politicians and others who, it was alleged, had deposited kickbacks from a 1991 arms sale to Taiwan into secret accounts at Clearstream, a private bank in Luxembourg. The most prominent name on the list was that of Nicolas Sarkozy, Villepin&#x27;s rival for power in the UMP. The list was later shown to be fraudulent, a discovery Villepin kept from the public for 15 months at a time when the two men were vying for party supremacy. Meanwhile, the source of the list was later revealed to be a longtime associate of Villepin&#x27;s, one Jean-Louis Gergorin, an executive at EADS. Critics claimed that Villepin, perhaps with the support of then-president Jacques Chirac, had tried to defame his rival. Sarkozy, in turn, filed a suit against whoever was behind the creation of the Clearstream list. Villepin was eventually acquitted in 2010 (see #Clearstream trial below).

====Possible presidential bid====
There was speculation that Villepin might be a candidate in the 2007 Presidential election; Interior minister Nicolas Sarkozy was selected unopposed as the UMP&#x27;s presidential candidate on 14 January 2007. On 12 March 2007 Villepin formally endorsed Sarkozy for President.

===Resignation===

On 15 May 2007, the last full day of President Jacques Chirac&#x27;s term, Villepin tendered his resignation from the office of prime minister and it was accepted by the President. He was replaced two days later by François Fillon.

==Post-prime ministerial career==
===Context of De Villepin&#x27;s political career===
De Villepin has never held elected office; the French Constitution allows the president to appoint unelected ministers. This is a political liability for him, because he is periodically accused of being out of touch with the realities of ordinary citizens. He is also reported to despise elected officials, calling members of Parliament &quot;connards&quot; (assholes). Villepin is not the first &quot;unelected&quot; prime minister, even in the relatively short history of the Fifth Republic: notable predecessors include Georges Pompidou, who was a banker before being called to office, and Raymond Barre, who had a previous career as a professor and appointed official, and started an elected career only after being Prime minister.

===Clearstream trial===
On the first day of the civil trial for his part in the Clearstream affair, Villepin accused President Sarkozy of pursuing him for political reasons. Sarkozy has the status of a civil plaintiff in the case.

On Thursday, 28 January 2010, the judgement was finally handed down and Villepin was acquitted of every accusation against him in the affair.
The following morning the prosecution announced that it would file an appeal against this verdict, thus further dragging out the affair another year. Villepin was finally cleared by an appeals court in September 2011.

===Career as advocate===

Soon after his exit from daily political life, on 9 January 2008 de Villepin returned to legal practice. Since then, he has travelled on business to Iran, Argentina, Venezuela and Colombia. Over its first two years, the bureau had revenues of 4.65 million euros and earned profit of 2.6 million. Alstom, TotalEnergies and Veolia and the Bugshan family conglomerate have all been clients. and he has a close relationship with Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani and her mother Moza bint Nasser. He advocated forcefully the Palestinian cause during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, at the request of the Qataris, and protested the French legal ban on Islamic facial veils for women in 2014. De Villepin counsels the Qatar Investment Authority. He is president of the advisory board of Universal Credit Rating Group, a Sino-Russo-American bond credit rating agency, and international advisor to China Minsheng Bank.

From November 2008 until June 2009, de Villepin chaired a six-member panel of EU experts advising the Bulgarian government. Set up by Bulgaria&#x27;s prime minister Sergei Stanishev, the advisory board was mandated to recommend ways to help the country adjust to EU membership.

=== République Solidaire and presidential run===
In 2010, Villepin quit the UMP and set up a new party, République Solidaire, with the aim of running for president in the 2012 elections. He advocated the rewithdrawal of France from the NATO integrated military command. However, he failed to secure the 500 necessary &quot;parrainages&quot; endorsements from elected officials in the preliminaries to the presidential race, and his candidacy did not proceed.

In 2016, the French investigating judge Sabine Kheris requested that a case be referred to the Court of Justice of the Republic. Three former ministers, Dominique de Villepin, Michel Barnier and Michèle Alliot-Marie, were suspected of having allowed the exfiltration of the mercenaries responsible for the attack on the Bouaké camp in 2004, killing nine French soldiers. The operation was allegedly intended to justify a response operation against the Laurent Gbagbo government in the context of the 2004 crisis in Ivory Coast.

===2017 presidential election===
In the 2017 presidential election, De Villepin endorsed centrist Emmanuel Macron before the first round and not fellow right-winger François Fillon, candidate of The Republicans.

===Art gallery===
In March 2020, Dominique de Villepin opened a commercial gallery in Hong Kong together with his son, Arthur de Villepin. The gallery is located on Hollywood Road in Central, and opened with an inaugural exhibition of work by the Chinese painter Zao Wou-ki.

===2024 legislative election===
In the wake of the dissolution of the National Assembly by Emmanuel Macron, de Villepin, architect of the 1997 dissolution, lamented his decision to seek new elections, and said that his second quinquennat merely &quot;float[ed in the] absence of clear ideas,&quot; but nonetheless called for a moderate coalition. Distancing himself from Éric Ciotti and his decision to cooperate with the far-right, while de Villepin did not explicitly specify he would vote for the New Popular Front over the National Rally, he did say that &quot;I consider that priority must be given to the struggle against the National Rally[, ] the real threat to our country.&quot;

==Personal life==
Villepin enjoys traveling through the U.S., and has spoken of Route 66 as giving a feeling of the &quot;wide open spaces of America&quot; that signify &quot;dreams and opportunities&quot;. He has said that the U.S. is a source of inspiration for &quot;every lover of liberty and democracy&quot;. 

De Villepin has been living in an apartment near the Place de l’Etoile in Paris since 2022. His art collections includes works by Anselm Kiefer, Miquel Barceló, Zao Wou-Ki and Yan Pei-Ming.

==Quotes==
*&quot;L&#x27;option de la guerre peut apparaître a priori la plus rapide. Mais n&#x27;oublions pas qu&#x27;après avoir gagné la guerre, il faut construire la paix.&quot; &quot;The option of war might seem at first to be the swiftest. But let us not forget that having won the war, one has to build peace.&quot; ( at the United Nations Security Council on 14 February 2003, shortly before the US-led invasion of Iraq)
*&quot;With the collapse of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime, a dark era is drawing to a close. And we welcome it... Together we must now build peace in Iraq and for France this has to mean the United Nations having a central role. Together we must build peace throughout the region and this can be done only through the determined search for a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.&quot;
*&quot;Let us have the courage to declare a first truth: International law does not give a right to security which engages, in return, a right to occupy and even less so, a right to massacre. There is a right to peace, and that right is the same for all peoples. The security which Israel seeks today, is done so against peace and against the Palestinian people.&quot;

<text>Prefect (from the Latin &quot;praefectus&quot;, substantive adjectival form of &quot;praeficere&quot;: &quot;put in front&quot;, meaning in charge) is a magisterial title of varying definition, but essentially refers to the leader of an administrative area.

A prefect&#x27;s office, department, or area of control is called a prefecture, but in various post-Roman Empire cases there is a prefect without a prefecture or &quot;vice versa&quot;. The words &quot;prefect&quot; and &quot;prefecture&quot; are also used, more or less conventionally, to render analogous words in other languages, especially Romance languages.

==Ancient Rome==

&quot;Praefectus&quot; was the formal title of many, fairly low to high-ranking officials in ancient Rome, whose authority was not embodied in their person (as it was with elected Magistrates) but conferred by delegation from a higher authority. They did have some authority in their prefecture such as controlling prisons and in civil administration.

==Feudal times==
Especially in Medieval Latin, &quot;præfectus&quot; was used to refer to various officers—administrative, military, judicial, etc.—usually alongside a more precise term in the vernacular (such as &quot;Burggraf&quot;, which literally means &quot;Count of the Castle&quot; in the German language).

==Ecclesiastical==

The term is used by the Catholic Church, which based much of its canon law terminology on Roman law, in several different ways.
* The Roman Curia has the nine Prefects for the Congregations as well as the two of the Papal Household and of the Economic Affairs of the Holy See.
* The title also attaches to the heads of some Pontifical Council (central departments of the Curia), who are principally titled president, but in addition there is sometimes an additional &quot;ex officio&quot; position as a prefect. For example, the president of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue is also the prefect of the Commission for Religious Relations with Muslims.
*Traditionally these Curial officials are Cardinals, hence often called &quot;Cardinal-Prefect&quot; or &quot;Cardinal-President&quot;. There was a custom that those who were not cardinals when they were appointed were titled &quot;Pro-Prefect&quot; or &quot;Pro-President&quot;. Then these officials would be appointed prefect or president after their elevation to the Sacred College. However, since 1998, this custom has fallen into disuse.
* A Prefect Apostolic is a cleric (sometimes a Titular Bishop, but normally a priest) in charge of an apostolic prefecture, a type of Roman Catholic territorial jurisdiction fulfilling the functions of a diocese, usually in a missionary area or in a country that is anti-religious, such as the People&#x27;s Republic of China, but that is not yet given the status of regular diocese. It is usually destined to become one in time.

==Academic==
In the context of schools, a prefect is a pupil who has been given certain responsibilities in the school, similar to the responsibilities given to a hall monitor or safety patrol members.

* In some British, Irish and Commonwealth schools (especially but not exclusively private schools), prefects, usually students in fifth to seventh years (depending on how many years the school in question has), have considerable power. They were once allowed to administer school corporal punishment in some schools (now abolished in the UK and several other countries). They usually answer to a senior prefect known as the &quot;Head of School&quot; or &quot;Head Prefect&quot; or &quot;Head Boy&quot; or &quot;Head Girl&quot; or &quot;Senior Prefect&quot;. Larger schools may have a hierarchical structure with a team of prefects, a team of senior prefects, and a Head Boy and Girl. The Head Prefect may also be the &quot;School Captain&quot; if that is an appointed position in the school. This system is also practised in Hong Kong, a former British colony. Today, prefect roles in the U.K. are largely perfunctory and are mostly used to reward the better students in the year groups that qualify for prefect roles. Duties tend to be limited to door monitoring during break and representing the school at various extra-curricular events.
* In India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Singapore and Malaysia, prefects are student leaders in primary and secondary schools, often along the lines of other Commonwealth schools, but with superior powers. The prefect systems in these countries have changed little from when they were under the British, as the present governments have seen them as effective.
* In Bangladesh, Prefects are the leaders in Army based educational institutions namely Cadet Colleges.
* In Mexico, Prefects (in Spanish, &quot;) is an adult head of a grade of a school, a US equivalent would be a dean.
* In Sweden, a prefect (&quot;) is the head of a university department.
* In Jesuit and other Catholic schools this title was given formerly to members of the faculty, a prefect of discipline in charge of student attendance, general order and such, and a prefect of studies in charge of academic issues.

Many college preparatory boarding schools utilize the position of prefect as a high student leadership position.

==Modern sub-national administration==
*In Albania a prefect (&quot;Prefekti&quot;) is the State&#x27;s representative in a region (&quot;qark&quot;). His agency is called the &quot;Prefektura&quot;. Albania has 12 prefects in 12 prefectures, appointed by the Prime Minister of Albania and the Government.
* In France the prefect is a top-ranking public servant who belongs to the so-called &quot;Corps préfectoral&quot;. The function was created on 17 February 1800 by Napoleon Bonaparte after his successful coup d&#x27;état of 9 November 1799 which made him head of state with the title &quot;Premier Consul&quot;. The prefect&#x27;s role at that time (until the reform of the function in the 1980s) was to be the top representative of the national government as well as the chief administrator in a department (which can be compared to a county in most English-speaking nations). The prefect&#x27;s office is known as the prefecture (&quot;préfecture&quot;). Subprefects operate as assistants in the arrondissements (departmental subdivisions).

In the 1980s, under the presidency of François Mitterrand (1981–1995), a fundamental change in the role of the prefect (and subprefect) took place. The previously extremely centralized French Fifth Republic was gradually decentralized by the creation of administrative regions and the devolution of central state powers into regions, departments, and communes (municipalities). New elected authorities were created (e.g. the &quot;Conseils régionaux&quot;) in order to administer the subdivisional entities (&quot;collectivités territoriales&quot;) of the nation (law from 2 March 1982). The changes have gradually altered the function of the prefect, who is still the chief representative of the State in a department, but without the omnipotent function of chief administrator. Instead, the prefect has acquired the non-titular roles of chief controller of regional, departmental, and municipal public accounts, and of chief inspector of good (i.e. law-abiding) governance of the authorities of the respective territorial entities.

A &quot;préfet maritime&quot; (maritime prefect) is a French admiral (&quot;amiral&quot;) who is commissioned to be the chief commander of a &quot;zone maritime&quot; (i.e. a section of the French territorial waters and the respective shores).

In Paris, the (prefect of police) is the head of the city&#x27;s police under the direct authority of the Minister of the Interior, which makes him unique as usually in French towns and cities the chief of the local police is subordinate to the mayor, who is the local representative of the minister in police matters.

* In Italy, a prefect (&quot;prefetto&quot;) is a high-ranking public servant who belongs to the so-called &quot;Corpo prefettizio&quot; and is the State&#x27;s representative in a province. His office is called &quot;Prefettura – Ufficio Territoriale del Governo&quot;. The prefects have political responsibility and coordinate the local head of the State Police (&quot;Questore&quot;), who has technical responsibility to enforce laws when public safety is threatened. Similar offices already existed under various names before Italian unification (1861) (e.g., in the Kingdom of Two Sicilies it was named &quot;intendente&quot;); in Northern Italy, it was imported from France during the Napoleonic occupation (1802). Its current form dates back to 1861, when the government of Bettino Ricasoli extended the Kingdom of Sardinia&#x27;s administrative system to the entire country. In the early years the job entailed a more vigorous and vigilant application of central state authority, by enforcing regulations and dispositions in the fields of education, public works, public health, and the nomination of mayors and provincial deputies. He also plays the role of intermediary between the government and municipalities and other local governments.
* In some Spanish-speaking states in Latin America, following a French-type model introduced in Spain itself, prefects were installed as governors; remarkably, in some republics (like Peru) two levels were constructed from the French model: a prefecture and a department, the one being only part of the other.
*In Greece a prefect (nomarhis, νομάρχης) used to be the elected head of one of the 54 prefectures (nomarhies, νομαρχίες), which were second-level administrative divisions, between the first-level Peripheries (periferies, περιφέρειες) and the third-level Municipalities (demoi, δήμοι), until their abolition with the Kallikratis reform in 2010. The Prefectural elections (popular ballot) would be held every four years along with the Municipal elections. The last Prefectural elections in Greece were held in October 2006.
* In Romania, a prefect (&quot;prefect&quot;) is the appointed governmental representative in a county (&quot;județ&quot;) and in the Municipality of Bucharest, in an agency called &quot;prefectură&quot;. The prefect&#x27;s role is to represent the national government at local level, acting as a liaison and facilitating the implementation of National Development Plans and governing programmes at local level.
* In Québec, a warden (French: &quot;préfet&quot;) is the head of a regional county municipality.
* In Brazil, a prefect (&quot;prefeito&quot;) is the elected head of the executive branch in a municipality. Larger cities, such as São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Curitiba, etc., also have sub-prefects, appointed to their offices by the elected prefect.
* In Georgia, the nation in the Caucasus region, a prefect (პრეფექტი) was the head of the executive branch in a municipality, appointed by the President of Georgia from 1990 to 1992.
*In Iran, a prefect () is responsible for the administration of a sector in Iran&#x27;s political and administrative system.
* In China the leader of a prefecture is called an administration commissioner (行署专员). Leaders of leagues (the Inner Mongolian equivalent) are league leaders (盟长). Both are equivalent to prefects. But far more common is prefecture-level cities (municipalities are equivalent; there are no province above them), who have &quot;shizhang&quot; (市长) which are often misleadingly translated as mayors, but are always responsible for the full prefecture rather than just the urban districts or actual urban core, and are thus prefects, not mayors (unless no country-level division exists in the prefecture, such as Dongguan, in which case the officeholder is prefect-mayor). If the urban area belongs to only one urban district, the head of the district is the effective mayor, otherwise there is none (like Paris during the time of department of Seine). In all cases actual leadership is exercised through the party committee.

==Police==
In Paris, the prefect of police (&quot;préfet de police&quot;) is the officer in charge of co-ordinating the city&#x27;s police forces. The local police in Japan are divided among prefectures too.

In several countries of Latin America, the rank of prefect is still in use. In the Investigations Police of Chile (Policia de Investigaciones de Chile) the rank of prefect is reserved for the highest-ranking officers. Similarly, in Argentina the Argentine Federal Penitentiary Service (Servicio Penitenciario Argentino) also use the rank of prefect as a high-ranking officer.

==Coast guard==
Several countries of Latin America use the term &quot;prefecture&quot; (prefectura) to denominate a coast guard service, whether these are independent organizations or as a part of a navy. The Argentine Naval Prefecture is a federal coast guard service of Argentina independent from the Argentine Navy. On the other hand, the National Naval Prefecture of Uruguay has similar duties to the ones of a regular coast guard but it is subordinated to the National Navy of Uruguay.

<doc id="164664" wikidata="Q63263" url="?curid=164664" title="Jean-Pierre Raffarin">
<text>Jean-Pierre Raffarin (; born 3 August 1948) is a French politician who served as Prime Minister of France from 6 May 2002 to 31 May 2005 under President Jacques Chirac.

He resigned after France&#x27;s rejection of the referendum on the European Union draft constitution. However, after Raffarin resigned, he said that his decision was not based on the outcome of the vote. Opinion polls following his resignation suggested that Raffarin was one of France&#x27;s least popular prime ministers since the Fifth Republic was established in 1958. However, according to the book &quot;France: 1815–2003&quot;, written by Martin Evans and Emmanuel Godin, Raffarin was &quot;a remarkably popular Prime Minister&quot; despite his ability &quot;to state the obvious and to make empty statements&quot;.

He was also Vice President of the Senate from 2011 to 2014.

==Early life==
Born 3 August 1948, Raffarin grew up in Poitiers, the son of a prominent national figure: his father Jean Raffarin was vice-minister of Agriculture in the government of Pierre Mendès France (1954–1955). He studied law at Université Paris-Panthéon-Assas and later graduated from the École Supérieure de Commerce de Paris. He started his professional career in marketing.

In the 1970s, his first political commitment was in the association of Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s young supporters. Defining himself as a &quot;giscardien&quot;, he joined the staff of Lionel Stoléru, Secretary of state for Manual Workers and Immigration, and the Republican Party, the liberal-conservative component of the centre-right confederation the Union for French Democracy (UDF).

==Political career==

In the 1980s, he started a career in local politics in Poitou-Charentes region. With the support of René Monory, the local political leader, he took the chair of the regional council in 1988.
Seven years later, he was elected senator of Vienne &quot;département&quot;.

===In Government===
During the 1995 presidential campaign, while most UDF politicians supported Édouard Balladur, he chose the winning candidacy of Jacques Chirac. In return, he was nominated Minister of Small and Medium-sized Companies, Commerce and Craft Industry in Alain Juppé&#x27;s cabinet (1995–1997).

At the same time, the pro-Chirac UDF members founded the Popular Party for French Democracy. Then, he returned in the Republican Party, became Liberal Democracy (DL) in 1997. He was vice-president of DL until 2002.

===Prime minister===
During the 2002 presidential campaign, he advocated the union of the right behind the incumbent President Chirac. After his re-election, Chirac wished to give a sign of political renewal. Furthermore, elected in a special second round by a majority of left-wing voters, he searched for a moderate to lead the cabinet and the June 2002 legislative campaign. Raffarin participated in the formation of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). He criticized the American-led intervention in Iraq.

His political policies combined authority and moderate economical liberalism – that is, the support of laissez-faire economic policies. In 2003 he launched reforms of the public retirement scheme and of decentralisation, which led to many strikes. During the summer of 2003 the country experienced an unusual heat wave which caused the death of nearly 15,000 people. The perceived late reaction of the government was blamed on his administration. In 2004 he began a reform of the French state-run health-care system.

Raffarin&#x27;s governments were known for their internal quarrels with various ministers taking opposite positions in public. The alleged lack of authority of the Prime Minister was mocked by the media.

On 28 March 2004 the ruling UMP party suffered an important defeat during the regional elections, with all but one &quot;région&quot; out of 22 of mainland France going to the opposition (PS, PCF, Les Verts). This was generally interpreted, including by Raffarin himself in his post-election speech, as &quot;a sign of distrust against the government from the electorate&quot;. On 30 March 2004 Jean-Pierre Raffarin tendered the resignation of his government to president Jacques Chirac, who immediately re-appointed him prime minister, with the delegation to form a new government. This major cabinet reshuffle removed some of its most controversial ministers like Luc Ferry (education) or Jean-François Mattei (health).

===Resignation===
Raffarin&#x27;s resignation was accepted by President Chirac on 30 May 2005, after the &quot;no&quot; victory at the European Constitution referendum, and he was replaced as prime minister by Dominique de Villepin.

On 18 September 2005, he was elected Senator in the Vienne &quot;département&quot;. Speculation were that he could eventually try to become President of the Senate or President of the Union for a Popular Movement if Nicolas Sarkozy won the 2007 presidential election. He became one of the Vice presidents of the UMP in 2007. In September 2008, he sought the Senate UMP fraction&#x27;s investiture to become President of the Senate, but was defeated by Gérard Larcher.

Raffarin is Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour and Grand Cross of National Order of Merit.

===International policies===
During a state visit to China on 21 April 2005 he avoided opposing the new &quot;anti-secession&quot; law on Taiwan, stating that &quot;The anti-secession law is completely compatible with the position of France&quot; and &quot;The position of France has always been to &#x27;one China&#x27; and we will remain attached to this position&quot;. On the embargo on weapons, he stated that &quot;France continues to ask for a lifting of the embargo, and does not see what could lead the European Council to change position on that question&quot;. By convention, foreign affairs are one of the President&#x27;s—and not the Prime Minister&#x27;s—sole responsibilities.

==Raffarinades==
Jean-Pierre Raffarin was often teased for his optimistic aphorisms, known colloquially and ironically as &quot;raffarinades&quot;, the best known being &quot;La route est droite, mais la pente est forte&quot; (&quot;The road is straight, but the slope is steep&quot;). Some consider that the word &quot;raffarinade&quot; was created in reference to the other French word &quot;mazarinade&quot;. However, &quot;mazarinade&quot; refers to the songs that the &quot;frondeurs&quot; (French revolutionaries during the &quot;Régence&quot; of Queen Anne – Archduchess of Austria – and chief minister Cardinal de Mazarin, before king Louis XIV&#x27;s personal reign) sang to mock the unpopular chief minister.

Raffarin also tried his English prior to the referendum on the European draft Constitution but this turned out to be an ill-advised idea, as shown in this famous excerpt from his speech: &quot;Win the yes needs the no to win against the no.&quot; The referendum itself was eventually nicknamed &quot;le Raffarindum&quot; by its opponents while &quot;Journée de solidarité envers les personnes âgées&quot; (&quot;Day of solidarity with the elderly&quot;) is sometimes referred to as &quot;la Saint-Raffarin&quot; by discontented workers (following a decision by Raffarin, French workers are supposed to work on Whit Monday for free, but public transportation still uses its &quot;Sundays and holidays&quot; timetable).

<doc id="164670" wikidata="Q410884" url="?curid=164670" title="Cantharidin">
<text>Cantharidin is an odorless, colorless fatty substance of the terpenoid class, which is secreted by many species of blister beetles. Its main current use in pharmacology is treating molluscum contagiosum and warts topically. It is a burn agent and poisonous in large doses, and has been historically used as aphrodisiacs (Spanish fly). In its natural form, cantharidin is secreted by the male blister beetle, and given to the female as a copulatory gift during mating. Afterwards, the female beetle covers her eggs with it as a defense against predators.

Poisoning from cantharidin is a significant veterinary concern, especially in horses, but it can also be poisonous to humans if taken internally (where the source is usually experimental self-exposure). Externally, cantharidin is a potent vesicant (blistering agent), exposure to which can cause severe chemical burns. Properly dosed and applied, the same properties have also been used therapeutically, for instance, for treatment of skin conditions, such as molluscum contagiosum infection of the skin.

Cantharidin is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States, and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities that produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.

==Chemistry==

===Structure and nomenclature===
Cantharidin, from the Greek &quot;kantharis&quot;, for beetle, is an odorless, colorless natural product with solubility in various organic solvents, but only slight solubility in water. Its skeleton is tricyclic, formally, a tricyclo-[5.2.1.02,6]decane skeleton. Its functionalities include a carboxylic acid anhydride (−CO−O−CO−) substructure in one of its rings, as well as a bridging ether in its bicyclic ring system.
The complete mechanism of the biosynthesis of cantharidin is unknown. Its framework formally consists of two isoprene units. However, feeding studies indicate that the biosynthetic process is more complicated, and not a simple product of geranyl pyrophosphate or related ten-carbon parent structure, as the seeming monoterpene nature would suggest. Instead, there is a farnesol (15-carbon) precursor from which certain carbon segments are later excised.

===Distribution and availability===
The level of cantharidin in blister beetles can be quite variable. Among blister beetles of the genus &quot;Epicauta&quot; in Colorado, &quot;E. pennsylvanica&quot; contains about 0.2 mg, &quot;E. maculata&quot; contains 0.7 mg, and &quot;E. immaculata&quot; contains 4.8 mg per beetle; males also contain higher levels than females.

Males of &quot;Berberomeloe majalis&quot; have higher level of cantharidin per beetle: 64.22 ± 51.28 mg/g (dry weight) and 9.10 ± 12.64 mg/g (d. w.). Cantharidin content in haemolymph is also higher in males (80.9 ± 106.5 μg/g) than in females (20.0 ± 41.5 μg/g).

==History==
===Aphrodisiac preparations===
Preparations made from blister beetles (particularly &quot;Spanish fly&quot;) have been used since ancient times as an aphrodisiac, possibly because their physical effects were perceived to mimic those of sexual arousal, and because they can cause prolonged erection or priapism in men. These preparations were known as &quot;cantharides&quot;, from the Greek word for &quot;beetle&quot;.

Examples of such use found in historical sources include:

* The ancient Roman historian Tacitus relates that a cantharid preparation was used by the empress Livia, wife of Augustus Caesar, to entice members of the imperial family or dinner guests to commit sexual indiscretions (thus, providing her information to hold over them).
* The German emperor Henry IV (1050–1106) is said to have consumed cantharides.
* The French surgeon Ambroise Paré (1510–1590) described a case in 1572 of a man suffering from &quot;the most frightful satyriasis&quot; after taking a potion composed of nettles and a cantharid extract. This is perhaps the same man of whom Paré relates that a courtesan sprinkled a cantharid powder on food she served to him, after which the man experienced &quot;violent priapism&quot; and anal bleeding, of which he later died. Paré also cites the case of a priest who died of hematuria after swallowing a dose of cantharides, which he intended to fortify his sex drive.
* Cantharides were in widespread use among the upper classes in France in the 1600s, despite being a banned substance. Police searches in connection with a rash of poisonings around 1680 turned up many stashes of &quot;bluish flies&quot;, which were known to be used in the preparation of aphrodisiac potions.
* The French sorceress Catherine Monvoisin (known as &quot;La Voisin,&quot; c. 1640–1680) was recorded in the 1670s as having prepared a love charm made from Spanish fly mixed with dried mole&#x27;s blood and bat&#x27;s blood.
* Aphrodisiac sweets presumably laced with cantharides were circulated within libertine circles during the 1700s in France. They were multicolored tablets nicknamed &quot;pastilles de Richelieu,&quot; after the Maréchal de Richelieu, a notorious libertine (not to be confused with his great-uncle, the Cardinal Richelieu) who procured sexual encounters for King Louis XV.
* The French writer Donatien Alphonse François ⁠— ⁠notoriously known as the Marquis de Sade (1740–1814) ⁠— ⁠is said to have given aniseed-flavored pastilles laced with Spanish fly to two prostitutes at a pair of orgies in 1772, poisoning and nearly killing them. He was sentenced to death for that (and for the crime of sodomy), but was later reprieved on appeal.
===Non-aphrodisiac uses===
* The Spanish clergyman Juan de Horozco y Covarrubias (es) (c. 1540–1610) reported the use of blister beetles as a poison as well as an aphrodisiac.
* Preparations of dried blister beetles were at one time used as a treatment for smallpox. As late as 1892, Andrew Taylor Still, the founder of osteopathy, recommended inhaling a tincture of cantharidin as an effective preventative and treatment for smallpox, decrying vaccination.

===Pharmaco-chemical isolation===
Cantharidin was first isolated as a chemically pure substance in 1810 by Pierre Robiquet, a French chemist then living in Paris. Robiquet isolated cantharidin as the active ingredient in pharmacological preparations of &quot;Lytta vesicatoria&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Spanish fly&quot;, a species of blister beetle. This was one of the first historical instances of the identification and extraction of a simple active principle from a complex medicine.

Robiquet found cantharidin to be an odorless and colorless solid at room temperature. He demonstrated that it was the active principle responsible for the aggressively blistering properties of the coating of the eggs of the blister beetle, and additionally established that cantharidin had toxic properties comparable in degree to those of the most virulent poisons known in the 19th century, such as strychnine.

===Other uses of the pharmacological isolate===
* Diluted solutions of cantharidin can be used as a topical medication to remove warts and tattoos, and to treat the small papules of &quot;molluscum contagiosum&quot;.
* In Santería rituals, cantharides are used in incense.

==Veterinary issues==
Poisoning by &quot;Epicauta&quot; species from cantharidin is a significant veterinary concern, especially in horses; species infesting feedstocks depend on region—e.g., &quot;Epicauta pennsylvanica&quot; (black blister beetle) in the U.S. midwest; and &quot;E. occidentalis, temexia, and vittata&quot; species (striped blister beetles) in the U.S. southwest—where the concentrations of the agent in each can vary substantially. Beetles feed on weeds, and occasionally move into crop fields used to produce livestock feeds (e.g., alfalfa), where they are found to cluster and find their way into baled hay, e.g., a single flake (4–5 in. section) may have several hundred insects, or none at all. Horses are very sensitive to the cantharidin produced by beetle infestations: the for horses is roughly 1 mg/kg of the horse&#x27;s body weight. Horses may be accidentally poisoned when fed bales of fodder with blister beetles in them.

Great bustards, a strongly polygynous bird species, are not immune to the toxicity of cantharidin; they become intoxicated after ingesting blister beetles. However, cantharidin has activity also against parasites that infect them. Great bustards may eat toxic blister beetles of the genus &quot;Meloe&quot; to increase the sexual arousal of males.

==Human medical issues==

===General risks===
As a blister agent, cantharidin has the potential to cause adverse effects when used medically; for this reason, it has been included in a list of &quot;problem drugs&quot; used by dermatologists and emergency personnel. However, this references unregulated sources of cantharidin. In July 2023, the US FDA approved a topical formulation of cantharidin (Ycanth) for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum.

When ingested by humans, the is unknown, but fatal doses have been 
recorded between 10 mg and 65 mg. The median lethal dose appears to be around 1 mg/kg but individuals have survived after consuming oral doses as high as 175 mg. Ingesting cantharidin can initially cause severe damage to the lining of the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts, and may also cause permanent renal damage. Symptoms of cantharidin poisoning include blood in the urine, abdominal pain, and (rarely) prolonged erections.

===Risks of aphrodisiac use===

The extreme toxicity of cantharidin makes any use as an aphrodisiac highly dangerous. As a result, it is illegal to sell (or use) cantharidin or preparations containing it without a prescription in many countries.

==Research==

===Mechanism of action===

Topical cantharidin is absorbed by the lipid membranes of epidermal cells, causing the release of serine proteases, enzymes that break the peptide bonds in proteins. This causes the disintegration of desmosomal plaques, cellular structures involved in cell-to-cell adhesion, leading to detachment of the tonofilaments that hold cells together. The process leads to the loss of cellular connections (acantholysis), and ultimately results in blistering of the skin. Lesions heal without scarring.

===Pharmaceutical use===
VP-102, an experimental drug-device combination that includes cantharidin delivered via a single-use applicator, was studied for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum, common warts, and genital warts. The efficacy of cantharidin was formally established for the treatment of molluscum in patients 2 years and older in two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. It is now FDA-approved for the treatment of molluscum contagiousum under the brand name Ycanth and is marketed by Verrica Pharmaceuticals. 

===Bioactivities===
Cantharidin appears to have some effect in the topical treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis in animal models. In addition to topical medical applications, cantharidin and its analogues may have activity against cancer cells.
Laboratory studies with cultured tumor cells suggest that this activity may be the result of PP2A inhibition.

<text>The Union Pacific Railroad is a Class I freight-hauling railroad that operates 8,300 locomotives over routes in 23 U.S. states west of Chicago and New Orleans. Union Pacific is the second largest railroad in the United States after BNSF, with which it shares a duopoly on transcontinental freight rail lines in the Western, Midwestern and West South Central United States.

Founded in 1862, the original Union Pacific Rail Road was part of the first transcontinental railroad project, later known as the Overland Route. Over the next century, UP absorbed the Missouri Pacific Railroad, the Western Pacific Railroad, the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad and the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. In 1995, the Union Pacific merged with Chicago and North Western Transportation Company, completing its reach into the Upper Midwest. In 1996, the company merged with Southern Pacific Transportation Company, itself a giant system that was absorbed by the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad. The Union Pacific Railroad Company is the principal operating company of Union Pacific Corporation, which are both headquartered at the Union Pacific Center, in Omaha, Nebraska.

==History==
===Union Pacific in the 19th century===
The original company, the &quot;Union Pacific Rail Road&quot;, was incorporated on July 1, 1862, under the Pacific Railroad Act of 1862. President Abraham Lincoln had approved the act, which authorized railroad construction from the Missouri River to the Pacific to ensure the stability of the Union throughout the American Civil War, but construction did not complete until after the conflict&#x27;s conclusion.

Under the original bill that formed the basis of the 1862 Pacific Railroad Act, the Union Pacific Railroad was to be built from the Nevada–Utah border in the west to the Colorado–Kansas border in the east. However, due to intense lobbying by Dr. Thomas Clark Durant, the eastern terminal was moved to a location where the Union Pacific could link up with the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad in Iowa. Following the Act&#x27;s passage, commissioners appointed by Congress began selling stock in the federally chartered Union Pacific Railroad Company. By 1863, Durant had organized the purchase of 2,000 shares, the prerequisite amount of stock sold in order to begin the railroad&#x27;s construction.

The resulting track ran westward from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to meet in Utah the Central Pacific Railroad line, which had been constructed eastward from Sacramento, California. The combined Union Pacific–Central Pacific line became known as the first transcontinental railroad and later the Overland Route.
The line was constructed primarily by Irish labor who had learned their craft during the recent Civil War. Under the guidance of its dominant stockholder, Thomas C. Durant, the namesake of the city of Durant, Iowa, the first rails were laid in Omaha. The two lines were joined at Promontory Summit, Utah, west of Ogden on May 10, 1869, hence creating the first transcontinental railroad in North America. Leland Stanford, founder of the Central Pacific Railroad which itself eventually was merged with Union Pacific, himself drove the golden spike, inscribed with the words &quot;to span the continent and wed the oceans.&quot;Subsequently, the UP purchased three Mormon-built, narrow-gauge roads: the Utah Central Railroad extending south from Ogden to Salt Lake City, the Utah Southern Railroad extending south from Salt Lake City into the Utah Valley, and the Utah Northern Railroad extending north from Ogden into Idaho. The UP also purchased the Utah Eastern Railroad and Utah Western Railroad, both Mormon narrow-gauge lines.

The original UP was entangled in the Crédit Mobilier scandal, exposed in 1872. As detailed by the &quot;New York Sun&quot;, Union Pacific&#x27;s largest construction company, Crédit Mobilier, had overcharged Union Pacific; the railroad would then pass the inflated costs on to the United States government. To convince the federal government to accept the increased costs, Crédit Mobilier had bribed multiple congressmen. Several prominent UP board members (including Durant) had been involved in the scheme. The ensuing financial crisis of 1873 led to a credit crunch, but not bankruptcy.

As boom followed bust, the Union Pacific continued to expand. A new company, with dominant stockholder Jay Gould, purchased the old on January 24, 1880. Gould already owned the Kansas Pacific (originally called the Union Pacific, Eastern Division, though in essence a separate railroad), and sought to merge it with UP. Through that merger, the original &quot;Union Pacific Rail Road&quot; transformed into &quot;Union Pacific Railway&quot;.

Extending towards the Pacific Northwest, Union Pacific built or purchased local lines to reach Portland, Oregon. Towards Colorado, it built the Union Pacific, Denver and Gulf Railway: a system combining narrow-gauge trackage into the heart of the Rockies and a standard gauge line that ran south from Denver, across New Mexico, and into Texas.

The Union Pacific Railway would later declare bankruptcy during the Panic of 1893. The resulting corporate reorganization reversed Gould&#x27;s name change: Union Pacific &quot;Railway&quot; merged into a new Union Pacific &quot;Railroad&quot;.

===Union Pacific in the 20th century===
In the early 20th century, Union Pacific&#x27;s focus shifted from expansion to internal improvement. Recognizing that farmers in the Central and Salinas Valleys of California grew produce far in excess of local markets, Union Pacific worked with its rival Southern Pacific to develop a spoilage-resistant rail-based transport system. These efforts came culminated in the 1906 founding of Pacific Fruit Express, soon to be the world&#x27;s largest lessee of refrigerated railcars.

Meanwhile, Union Pacific worked to construct a faster, and more direct substitute for the original climb to Promontory Summit. In 1904, the Lucin cutoff opened, reducing curvature and grades. The original route would eventually be stripped of track in 1942 to provide war scrap.

To attract customers during the Great Depression, Union Pacific&#x27;s chairman W. Averell Harriman simultaneously sought to &quot;spruce up&quot; the quality of its rolling stock and to make its unique locations more desirable travel destinations. The first effort resulted in the purchase of the first streamlined train: the M-10000. The latter resulted in the Sun Valley ski resort in central Idaho; it opened in 1936 and finally was sold in 1964. Despite the fact that the M-10000 and its successors were among the first diesel locomotives, Union Pacific completed dieselization relatively late. In 1944, UP finally received delivery of its last steam locomotive: Union Pacific 844.

As the 20th century waned, Union Pacific recognized—like most railroads—that remaining a regional railroad would only lead to bankruptcy. On December 31, 1925, UP and its subsidiaries operated routes and tracks; in 1980, these numbers had remained roughly constant (9,266 route-miles and 15,647 track-miles). But in 1982, UP acquired the Missouri Pacific and Western Pacific railroads, and 1988, the Missouri–Kansas–Texas. By 1993, Union Pacific had doubled its system to routes.

By then, few large (class I) railroads remained. The same year that Union Pacific merged with the Chicago and North Western (1995), Burlington Northern and ATSF announced merger plans. The impending BNSF amalgamation would leave one mega-railroad in control of the west. To compete, UP merged with Southern Pacific, thereby incorporating D&amp;RGW and Cotton Belt, and forming a duopoly in the West. The merged railroad took the Union Pacific name. As of 1999, the UP had of track, about 33,000 employees, nearly 7,000 locomotives and over 155,000 rail cars.

===Union Pacific in the 21st century===

In March 2024 Union Pacific layoffs caused concern at the Federal Railroad Administration to the extent that the FRA, in a letter to UP&#x27;s CEO, said &quot;safety of railroad operations is paramount ... decisions that comprise that fundamental ... are unacceptable. You must ensure that highly trained and experienced personnel perform critical inspections and repairs ... Your railroad (layoffs) are far outpacing any of your Class 1 peers.&quot;

In 2024 the railway celebrated 150 years of having its headquarters in Omaha.

The railway&#x27;s Big Boy #4014, the world&#x27;s largest operating steam locomotive, will visit 14 states in middle America in 2024. Twenty-five locomotives of Big Boy&#x27;s size were fabricated during World War II, but only Big Boy survives. Its &quot;Heartland of America&quot; tour begins in August 2024 in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and visits Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas through October.

Another locomotive, UP No. 4141, is named in honor of George H. W. Bush, the US 41st President and is exhibited at the George H. W. Bush Presidential Center at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas. The locomotive is custom painted in the colors of GWH Bush&#x27;s Air Force One. The engine also pulled the president&#x27;s funeral train on his final journey to College Station in 2018.

==Facilities==

The Union Pacific system includes hundreds of yards. Most are flat yards used for local switching. Other types of yards include intermodal terminals and hump yards. Most UP intermodal terminals are typically ports, but UP also has inland terminals for transfers to trucks, such as the terminal in San Antonio that opened in 2009 or the one in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, that opened in 2014.

===Hump yards===
In 2006, Union Pacific had 11 major active hump yards:

*Bailey Yard in North Platte, Nebraska
* Beaumont Yard in Beaumont, Texas
* Davidson Yard in Fort Worth, Texas
* Davis Yard in Roseville, California
* Englewood Yard in Houston, Texas
* Gateway Yard in East St Louis, Illinois, owned by subsidiary Alton and Southern Railway
* Livonia Yard in Livonia, Louisiana
* North Little Rock Yard in North Little Rock, Arkansas
* Proviso Yard in Northlake, Illinois, owned by Chicago and North Western Transportation Company until 1995
* Strang Yard in La Porte, Texas
* West Colton Yard in Bloomington, California

In the late 2010s, Union Pacific began deactivating hump yards in favor of flat switching. In this, Union Pacific followed the industry-wide trend towards Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR); railway executive Hunter Harrison explained that under PSR, few yards receive enough variegated traffic to necessitate a hump. Union Pacific also closed facilities in Kansas City (&quot;Neff yard&quot;), Hinkle, Oregon, and Pine Bluff, Arkansas in 2019.

==Locomotives and rolling stock==
Union Pacific has owned some of the most powerful locomotives. These include members of the Challenger-type (including the 3985), and the Northern-type (including the 844), as well as the Big Boy steam locomotives (including the 4014). Union Pacific ordered the first diesel streamliner, the largest fleet of turbine-electric locomotives in the world, and the largest diesel locomotives ever built (including 6936).

===Paint and colors===
The yellow paint scheme was introduced in the spring of 1934. Engineers claimed the visibility of yellow would reduce grade crossing accidents. In 1941, UP introduced its yellow and gray color scheme with red highlights, which remains in use today.

The middle two-thirds of the locomotive body is painted &quot;Armour Yellow&quot;, a color used by Armour and Company on the packaging of its meat products. A thin band of &quot;Signal Red&quot; divides this from the &quot;Harbor Mist Gray&quot; (a light gray) used for the body and roof above that point. There is also a thin band of Signal Red along the bottom of the locomotive body, but this color has gradually become yellow as new Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations for reflectorized tape came into effect in 2005; the trucks (painted Aluminum from 1955 to 1982), underframe, fuel tanks and everything else beneath that line are also Harbor Mist Gray. Lettering and numbering are in Signal Red, with black outlines. Most locomotives have white-outlined blue &quot;wings&quot; on the nose, on either side of the renowned shield featuring white lettering on a blue background and, below it, red and white vertical stripes. Beginning in early 2002, a number of units were repainted with a large, billowing American flag with the corporate motto &quot;Building America&quot; on the side, where the &#x27;UNION PACIFIC&#x27; lettering is normally positioned.

====Merger partner locomotives====
Until 2017, UP operated some locomotives still in the paint scheme of their former railroads. In addition, some locomotives were renumbered by UP, varying in the degree of the previous railroads&#x27; logos being eradicated, but always with a yellow patch applied over the locomotive&#x27;s former number and a new UP number applied on the cab. That allowed UP to number locomotives into its roster without spending the time and money necessary to perform a complete repaint. In May 2015, UP rostered 212 &quot;patches&quot;, consisting of:
* 22 Chicago and North Western (whose CNW logos have been hidden by the &quot;patches&quot;),
* 174 Southern Pacific (AC4400CW, GP40-2, MP15AC, and GP60)
* 14 St. Louis Southwestern (GP60)
* 2 Denver and Rio Grande Western (GP60)
*While not technically a predecessor locomotive in the traditional sense, UP also rostered a single SD40-2 (3564, since retired) still in the 1970s paint scheme, not counting DDA40X No. 6936, which was part of the Union Pacific Heritage Fleet until 2022.

In 2017, Union Pacific decided to repaint all locomotives which were not in the current corporate colors. only 41 locomotives remained unpainted.

====Commemorative color schemes====
From the second half of 2005 to the summer of 2006, UP unveiled a new set of six EMD SD70ACe locomotives in &quot;Heritage Colors&quot;, painted in schemes reminiscent of railroads acquired by the Union Pacific Corporation since the 1980s. The engine numbers match the year that the predecessor railroad became part of the Union Pacific system. The locomotives commemorate the Missouri Pacific with UP 1982, the Western Pacific with UP 1983, the Missouri–Kansas–Texas with UP 1988, the Chicago and North Western with UP 1995, the Southern Pacific with UP 1996, and the Denver and Rio Grande Western with UP 1989.

In October 2005, UP unveiled SD70ACe 4141, commissioned in honor of George Bush. The locomotive has &quot;George Bush 41&quot; on the sides and its paint scheme resembles that of Air Force One. It was sent into storage in 2007, but returned in 2018 to power Bush&#x27;s funeral train. It was donated to the George H. W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum on November 8, 2019.

On March 31, 2010, UP dedicated a specially painted GE ES44AC locomotive commemorating the centennial of the Boy Scouts of America.

On September 28, 2010, UP dedicated a specially painted GE ES44AC locomotive, as a tribute to Susan G. Komen for the Cure.

On October 19, 2017, Union Pacific unveiled SD70AH 1943, &quot;The Spirit of the Union Pacific&quot;, which is painted in a scheme to honor the United States armed forces.

On June 6, 2019, Union Pacific unveiled SD70ACe 1111, the &quot;Powered By Our People&quot; unit.

In April 2021, Union Pacific repainted an SD70M into a commemorative paint scheme called &quot;We Are ONE&quot; to honor Juneteenth and Pride Month.

UP also has a collection of locomotives painted for Operation Lifesaver, a rail safety organization founded in 1970.

===Locomotive roster===
As of December 2023, the Union Pacific had 7,175 locomotives on its active roster consisting of 42 different models.
====Heritage equipment====
Union Pacific continues to use a small number of &quot;heritage&quot; steam locomotives and early streamlined diesel locomotives. This equipment is used on special charters (excursions).

====Low-emissions locomotives====
Union Pacific maintains a fleet of low-emissions locomotives. Most are used in Los Angeles basin rail yards, to satisfy an air quality agreement with the local authorities.
==Facts and figures==

According to UP&#x27;s 2007 Annual Report to Investors, at the end of 2007 it had more than 50,000 employees, 8,721 locomotives, and 94,284 freight cars.

Broken down by specific type of car, owned and leased:
* 35,437 covered hoppers
* 12,272 boxcars
* 18,647 open-top hoppers
* 13,780 gondolas
* 14,148 &quot;other&quot; types of cars

In addition, it owns 6,950 different pieces of maintenance of way work equipment. At the end of 2007, the average age of UP&#x27;s locomotive fleet was 14.8 years, the freight car fleet 28 years.

UP was ranked 134th on the 2019 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue and had 41,967 employees. The Chief Executive Officer of Union Pacific since August 14, 2023, is Jim Vena, the President is Beth Whited, and the chairman of the board is Mike McCarthy.

In 2019, Union Pacific has been rated the worst company to work for by 247wallst.com, citing Past CEO Lance Fritz&#x27;s 12% approval rating and the 22% recommendation rating from Glassdoor.com.

==Passenger service==
===Commuter services===
When Union Pacific bought out the Chicago &amp; North Western in 1995, it inherited the railroad&#x27;s Metra commuter rail services in the Chicago metropolitan area: the Union Pacific North Line to Kenosha, Wisconsin, Northwest Line to Harvard, Illinois, and West Line to Elburn, Illinois, all of which operate from Ogilvie Transportation Center (the former North Western Station–a name still used by many Chicago residents). In order to ensure uniformity across the Chicago area commuter rail system, trains are branded as Metra services and use Metra equipment. However, Union Pacific crews continue to operate the trains under a purchase-of-service agreement. In 2023, UP announced its intentions to surrender the control and operation of commuter rail services and trains in Chicago to Metra, however the UP would retain ownership and control of the right-of-ways of former Chicago &amp; Northwestern lines radiating from Chicago.

===Former services===

Between 1869 and 1971, Union Pacific operated passenger service throughout its historic &quot;Overland Route&quot;. These trains ran between Chicago and Omaha on the Chicago &amp; Northwestern trackage starting in 1936. Disputes over trackage rights and passenger revenues with the C&amp;NW prompted the UP to switch to the Milwaukee Road for the handling of its streamliner trains between Chicago and Omaha beginning in late 1955. The last intercity passenger train operated by UP was the westbound &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot;, arriving at Los Angeles Union Station on May 2. Since then, Union Pacific has satisfied its common carrier requirements by hosting Amtrak trains.

===Hosted trains===
Many Amtrak and commuter rail routes use Union Pacific rails. This list excludes the commuter services the company directly operates in Chicago (see above).

====Amtrak====
* &quot;Amtrak Cascades&quot;
* &quot;California Zephyr&quot;
* &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot;
* &quot;Coast Starlight&quot;
* &quot;Lincoln Service&quot;
* &quot;Missouri River Runner&quot;
* &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot;

==Notable accidents and safety==
===21st century===
* September 4, 2007: a Union Pacific train derailment split the small town of Sergeant Bluff, Iowa. About 16 cars derailed, most carrying salt that spilled into snow-like piles. The derailment interrupted traffic for about two hours.
* June 24, 2012: three crew members died and caused a property damage of $15 million when two Union Pacific trains collided head-on just east of Goodwell, Oklahoma. The eastbound train passed a stop signal on the main track and struck the westbound train in a siding about east of the meeting point. The NTSB provided the probable causes as eastbound train&#x27;s operator&#x27;s vision problems and failure by the conductor to get backup assistance as required. NTSB stated UP did not comply with its own policies when it medically recertified the operator. The company only had six color tests despite the policy requiring a color test for 10 signals. 
* November 15, 2012: A UP train struck a parade float in Midland, Texas, killing four and injuring 16 passengers on the parade float.
* May 25, 2013: in Chaffee, Missouri, a Union Pacific train collided with a BNSF train at a level junction, injuring seven, and causing damages exceeding $10 million. The accident caused a Missouri Route M overpass to partially collapse and caused a fire. The investigation concluded the engineer most likely fell asleep, due to sleep apnea. The uncontrolled train violated four progressively more restrictive signals before colliding with the BNSF train at roughly . Three months later, the Route M overpass reopened with a new design.
* June 3, 2016: a 96-car oil train derailed in the Columbia River Gorge near Mosier, Oregon. Eleven cars derailed, at least one caught on fire, and of Bakken crude oil spilled, some going into the Columbia River. Some were eventually recovered.
* Mid-late 2018: the Niland Geyser, a moving mud pot, encroached on the railroad near the eastern shore of the Salton Sea, requiring extensive engineering work to first delay the movement and then build a temporary diversion.
* September 7, 2019: a Union Pacific train of two locomotives and three tank cars carrying liquefied petroleum gas derailed and crashed into an overpass support column at the Albina Yard in Portland, Oregon. The support column is for the eastbound lanes of the six-lane Going Street overpass, which is the only public access to the major industrial area Swan Island for cars and trucks. Four lanes were left unsafe after the derailment. Two of six lanes remain closed as of November 14, 2019. The cause of the crash was broken rails. There was nobody on board the train which was remotely operated at the time of crash. In May 2020, another Union Pacific derailment damaged a different overpass which &quot;The Skanner&quot; described as an ongoing safety concern.
* March 21, 2022: A Union Pacific freight train derailed and fell from a viaduct in Colton, California.
*September 2023: The railroad furloughed 138 workers, a small fraction of its 50,000 employees, but enough to cause a reprimand from the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) that indicated its inspection of UP trains determined the rates of defects in locomotives and cars was double the national average, which the FRA said, was caused by a dearth of personnel.
*December 18, 2024: A Union Pacific train crashed into a semi-truck that was hauling an oversize load in Pecos, Texas, resulting in all four locomotives and multiple freight cars with metal shipping containers derailing, including three that were carrying potentially hazardous materials (lithium-ion batteries and airbags), but none were released. Leaked diesel fuel was also contained. The Pecos Chamber of Commerce was also damaged as it was hit by the train during the derailment. Two Union Pacific employees were killed and 3 others were injured.

====San Antonio area====
On June 28, 2004, a UP train collided with an idle BNSF train in a San Antonio suburb. In the course of the derailment, a 90-ton tank car carrying liquified chlorine was punctured. As the chlorine vaporized, a toxic &quot;yellow cloud&quot; formed, killing three and causing 43 hospitalizations. The costs of cleanup and property damaged during the incident exceeded $7 million. 
Investigations of the Macdona incident revealed several serious safety lapses on the part of the Union Pacific and its employees, including employees not following the company&#x27;s own safety rules. While the immediate cause of the derailment was the UP crew&#x27;s &quot;fatigue&quot;, chlorine tank cars had been improperly placed near the front of the train, a danger in the case of derailment.

The Macdona incident was not the first derailment in the San Antonio area. Between May and November 1994, Union Pacific trains derailed five times, killing at least 4 people. Between June 2004 and March 2005, 10 trains derailed, killing as many people.

In the aftermath of Macdona, the Federal Railroad Administration signed a compliance agreement with the railroad in which the railroad promised to rectify the &quot;notable deficiencies&quot; that regulators found. But the relative impunity UP seemed to exhibit regarding the derailment led to suggestions that the FRA was far &quot;too cozy ... to the railroads.&quot; In March 2005, Texas Governor Rick Perry supported a plan to reroute trains around large urban population centers in Texas, including San Antonio, but such a plan was purely voluntary and had no timetable associated.

Trains have continued to derail in the area including an incident in June 2009 where tank cars containing chlorine and petroleum naptha xylene derailed, but did not spill.

==Community responsibility==
===Transient camp and graffiti issues===
The City of San Jose, California, threatened Union Pacific with a lawsuit in 2019 after years of complaints about transient and graffiti blight going unaddressed. For the first time in many years, Union Pacific cleaned out along the tracks starting in November 2019. San Jose Councilman Sergio Jimenez said &quot;The reality is that Union Pacific has not been a good neighbor&quot;.

San Jose&#x27;s mayor Sam Liccardo said&quot;At any given conference of mayors, you won&#x27;t hear anyone expressing confidence that Union Pacific will respond nimbly or collaboratively,&quot; and &quot;But we are hopeful that the (memorandum of understanding) will turn a page on Union Pacific&#x27;s behavior in the past to enable a more collaborative relationship going forward.&quot;&quot;The Mercury News&quot; reports that company has been uncooperative and non responsive to working together, such as failing to come through with graffiti abatement as Union Pacific had promised the city.

===2022 Utah legislative action===
In 2022, legislators in Utah brought forth two separate bills specifically aimed at Union Pacific. The first, HB181, was raised after some municipalities encountered resistance from Union Pacific when attempting to upgrade rail crossings. In Logan, Utah, Union Pacific altered a construction agreement to require the city to pay maintenance fees in perpetuity for an upgraded crossing, a mandate which was against state code. The proposed legislation would make it easier for municipalities to get crossing improvements approved, and clarifies which party must pay associated maintenance costs. HB181 was ultimately passed.

==Environmental record==
In Eugene, Oregon, where pollution from a century-old rail yard has been seeping into groundwater, the UP and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality launched a study of ground contamination in 2008. The pollutants are mostly petroleum hydrocarbons, industrial solvents, and metals.

In 2007, Union Pacific Railroad worked with the US EPA to develop a way to reduce locomotive exhaust emissions. They discovered that adding an oxidation catalyst filtering canister to the diesel engine&#x27;s exhaust manifold and using ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel would reduce particulate emissions by about half, unburned hydrocarbons by 38 percent, and carbon monoxide by 82 percent.

The company&#x27;s Fuel Master program rewards locomotive engineers who save the most fuel each month. The program has saved the company millions of dollars, much of which has been returned to the engineers. In 2006, the program&#x27;s founder, Wayne Kennedy, received the John H. Chafee Environmental Award, and the program was recognized by Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta.

In January 2018, a former waste water operator at Union Pacific Albina Yard in Portland, Oregon, employed by the railroad&#x27;s contractor Mott MacDonald negligently released thousands of gallons of oil into the environment. The operator was distracted by a cell phone and allowed the tank to overflow for over an hour. An engineering firm hired by Union Pacific estimates of it was released into nearby Willamette River, not including the spill that was captured by the containment booms. Employees of United States Environmental Protection Agency who were working at facilities nearby placed booms to contain the oil spill. Federal prosecutors have charged the operator Robert LaRue Webb II with violation of the Clean Water Act for releasing the oil into the environment. Webb pleaded guilty in August 2019, and was sentenced to two years probation and a $2,500 fine.

In 2016, the Union Pacific Railroad Co. was named as a defendant in a lawsuit seeking cleanup of a contaminated rail yard site that operated in Lafayette, Louisiana, from the late 1800s until the 1960s.

In 2020, Houston residents living near a Union Pacific Railroad Company rail yard filed lawsuits against the Union Pacific. These lawsuits followed the finding by the State of Texas of a higher-than-expected incidence of certain cancers in residents living close to the yard. A State of Texas report released in 2021 identified an additional cancer cluster of lymphoblastic leukemia in children.

In 2022, the state of Utah proposed bill, HB405, which would have required Union Pacific to replace their aging fleet of Tier 0 switching locomotives with hydrogen or electric engines by 2028, due to Utah having very poor air quality in winter months. According to Utah Senator Schultz, Union Pacific was uncooperative on the switching locomotive bill if Utah did not drop the railroad crossings bill. HB405 was dropped after Union Pacific made voluntary commitments to replace several tier 0 switching locomotives with less polluting tier 2 locomotives, as well as to test some all electric ones in the Utah Roper Rail Yard.

Wabtec is modernizing 600 older Union Pacific locomotives over a three-year period through 2025. The modernizations will improve fuel efficiency and reliability of these locomotives while also reducing emissions.

== Equipment Management Pool (EMP) ==
Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern are the largest owner-partners of Equipment Management Pool (EMP), a domestic freight interline intermodal freight transport service that rents and moves more than 35,000 53-foot containers and chassis throughout North America. Other partners in the freight company include Canadian National Railway, I&amp;M Rail Link, Iowa Interstate Railroad, and Wisconsin Central Ltd. In 2022, the Canadian Pacific Railway, one year prior to its merger with the Kansas City Southern Railway, was dropped from the pool, leaving CN as the only Canadian member.

==Union Pacific Railroad Museum==
The Union Pacific Railroad Museum is a former Carnegie library in Council Bluffs, Iowa, that houses artifacts, photographs, and documents that trace the development of the railroad and the American West. The company pays upkeep on the privately owned building, which houses part of Union Pacific&#x27;s corporate collection, one of the oldest in the United States. Holdings include weapons from the late 19th and 20th centuries, outlaw paraphernalia, a sampling of the immigrants&#x27; possessions, and a photograph collection comprising more than 500,000 images.
